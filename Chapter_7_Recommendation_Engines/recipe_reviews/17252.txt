Excellent!  We've made this several times and have found that baking it in a bundt pan makes it extra pretty and you need use just one pan.  We bake it for about 90 minutes.

Fabulous!  I had some sour cream and very ripe bananas to use up, so I tried this recipe.  So glad I did!  Both the banana and chocolate flavors came through.  Modifications:  1) Used regular sour cream and mini chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand.  With mini chocolate chips, chocolate flavor is more evenly distributed.  Since my bananas were small, I used 7.  2) Whisked dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, and cocoa powder) together in one bowl and created a hole in the middle.  In another bowl, mixed the wet ingredients (margarine, white sugar, eggs, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract).  Then poured the wet mixture and sour cream in the middle of the dry ingredients and mixed by hand until just incorporated.  Finally, stirred in the chips.  This method will prevent tough bread.  3) Instead of two big loaves, I made 8 mini loaves with the batter and baked them for 35 minutes.  Less time and easier to share with friends.  This tastes more like a loaf cake than traditional banana bread, so this will not replace my tried and true banana nut bread recipe.  However, this will be a wonderful addition to my repertoire, especially when I want to impress guests with an unique homemade baked treat.  *Update on 9/22/06: Made bread with regular semi-sweet chocolate chips and mini chips many time with great success.  Today used white chips, and they dissolved into gooey, sticky mess that stuck to the bottom of the pans and left ugly holes throughout the loaves.

I've been meaning to rate this recipe for a while...let's just say that it's one of my FAVORITE things to bake.  First of all, if you love chocolate, you need to try this.  Second, if you want a spin on traditional banana bread, this is it!  I personally did not find the chocolate overwhelming (you can definitely tell it's banana bread), in fact, I threw in extra chocolate chips!  I also added some walnuts for texture.  The recipe is simple, and quick to throw together...I did extend the baking time a little though.  Try it...you won't regret it!  :)

This is wonderful!  Definitely a 5 star bread!  I made it for a school bake-sale....I am sure it will be a big hit.  Warning: make sure you use a BIG mixing bowl....there is a LOT of batter!

This was absolutley incredible!  So moist and soft.  I added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of salt to balance the flavors, but we will DEFINATELY make again when I have leftover bananas.

Just a tip for people who change the recipe -- you won't want to substitute baking powder for the soda (they work in TOTALLY different ways and react with ingredients differently). However, if you use brown sugar, you may want to add a half teaspoon more of the baking soda in order to balance out the extra acid in the brown sugar (brown sugar has molasses added, making it more acidic than white sugar). Just a tip!

Very good!  I halved the sugar and combined brown and white and still found it sweet enough in the end.  It makes a great dessert and a naughty breakfast!

I love bananas and chocolate combined, so I had to give this a try....it was so moist and so delicious - a really nice take on traditional banana bread!  I cut the recipe in half and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I added an extra banana, subbed non-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream, kept the cocoa powder at 1/4 cup and to enhance the chocolate flavor I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  It smelled wonderful and tasted even better!

if i were just making this for myself, i would have added cocoa, but i omitted it b/c i think most people prefer without (I LOVE chocolate!) i used brown sugar instead of white and dusted the bottom with brown sugar/cinnamon mixture before pouring in batter, i don't have loaf pans so just used a 9 by 13 baking tray.  I used a whole 16 oz container of fat free sour cream, and used all other fat free products like egg beaters, free promise :)

I made 1 big loaf and 4 mini-loaves with this recipe, which by the way, is only 
the second time I tried to make banana bread.  It was yummy!!  I just love the combination of the banana and cholcolate flavors.  Its a keeper because of the taste and how easy it is to make.  I did have to bake it longer than what is suggested tho'.  Probably the fault of my oven.

YUM!  Since my husband and I both like chocolate, we didn't mind that it was the dominant flavor.  You could add one more banana if you really wanted the banana flavor to come through.  A definite keeper!

It was very good, but the chocolate kind of overtook the banana..I would recommend less cocoa powder and possibly walnuts as well.

I always read the lowest reviews for a recipe first-that tells me what NOT to do. In this case, I think all the bad reviews may be user error. I too followed the recipe exactly except for the chocolate chips. I also cut the recipe in half to make just one loaf. It was so good, I may throw out my tried and true banana bread recipe I've had for over 5 years. I love banana bread with chocolate chips, this was so much better, with chocolate in every bite. The key with this bread (and any other quick bread calling for butter or margarine) is to cream the butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes. This gives the bread a lighter texture and prevents the dreaded "dense" loaf. Thanks for the recipe and keep 'em comin!

This recipe was huge hit at out house.  I cut the recipe in half and made 1 1/2 dozen muffins.  I simply baked at the same temp for 18 minutes.  They came out perfect.  Moist and fluffy with a great chocolate taste.  I will make again.

I thought this turned out very moist and tasted great.  I did have to bake mine for about an additional 15-20 minutes to get it fully done in the middle.  I think the chocolate added a good sweetness to it without it being overly sweet.

I had a bunch of old bananas to use up-so I decided to stray away from my usual recipe and got funky with this one..I'm so glad I did.  DELICIOUS!  I used butter instead of margarine, 7 or 8 med sized bananas(very ripe ones), 1/2 cup cocoa, regular sour cream(I mean why skimp on fat when there's choc involved),a few more chocolate chips and 3/4 cup walnuts.  I also mixed my sour cream with the baking soda and let that sit a moment to take away the heaviness of the sour cream(it makes it more fluffy)- then added as directed.  I always bake in the disposable aluminum loaf pans(I think breads cook in them the best) and it made four with this batch.  I baked for 53 minutes and they were so moist and perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

I discovered this recipe two months ago and I have already made it three times.  It is easy, attractive and so delicious.  The recipe makes two loaves, so it's perfect to make one for your family and give the other away.

Excellant & VERY well met at the office.  Halved the recipe since I only had 3 bananas.  Easily one of the most MOIST loaves I've made ever.  Can definitely tell it's a banana loaf, but the balance of chocolate to banana is really good.  Might substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate though.  Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana... works for me & mine :)

Thanks Tracie P!

Great bread. I have used half the bananas and there is still a strong banana presence. Also used instant hot chocolate mix when I was out of baking cocoa and reduced sugar. Still very chocolaty!

I used this recipe to make muffins... it worked great! Makes a moist, cake-like muffin. I also didn't have any chocolate chips so i used walnuts. Yum! Definetly a keeper recipe.

I made little loaves and gave them to friends.  Everyone loved it.  The bread was moist and rich.  My 6 yr old son help me make it, so it was pretty easy.

Mine never rose properly and ended up being a very odd, dense texture, almost like fudge. I didn't care for it, but the hubby and kids ate it anyway...

Holy smokes, this is GREAT! Incredible taste and so moist! Some modifications I made: I used butter instead of margarine (I never bake with margarine anyhow); no cocoa powder on hand so just replaced that with flour; half white sugar and half brown sugar; double the amount of chocolate chips. One more thing: I cannot emphasize enough the importance of letting your bananas get overripe for any sort of banana baking. I don't doubt that underripe bananas account for the lack of banana taste that some people have mentioned. Let them ripen - that means completely brown skins! Don't let it scare you :).

Delicious. I usually add chocolate chips and walnuts to banana bread recipies and adding the cocoa makes it taste like a moist brownie. Was short on sour cream so I added vanilla yogurt and also added a touch more cocoa. I've done this with Zuchinni Bread recipie also with Reeses Peanut Butter Chips. Good! Will make again.

This was a pretty good recipe, tasted a little too much like banana cake for my taste. But then we did add quite a few chocolate chips! :)

This bread is nice and moist. Mine was sans chocolate chips because I did not have them on hand. As far as the taste, it was so-so. I'll probably just go back to making regular banana bread.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  Every time I make it my friends, coworkers and neighbors rave over it and beg me to make more.  It's so rich that it's more like a cake/dessert than a bread.  The only change I make is that I double the amount of cocoa used because it just isn't chocolately enough otherwise.

Pretty good!  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 applesauce in lieu of margarine, used egg substitute, subbed 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat, and used nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I also used mini chocolate chips.  It was a nice blend of banana and chocolate; neither flavor overpowered the other.

This recipe is excellant!  I halved it b/c I only had 3 large bananas and only needed one loaf.  The only other changes I made was to use 3 T of cocoa for a chocolatier bread and add 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  This bread is AWESOME!

Good Lord.  How could anyone come up with a recipe this good??  The best banana bread recipe I have tried.  I did take some others advice and use half white sugar and half brown.  All I had was regular sour cream, and it didn't seem to make a difference.  Next time, I'll use mini chips. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I thought this was really good but I would make some changes.  Double the chocolate, add some nuts and maybe not as many bananas.  It seemed a little mushy (too moist)I have always bought this at the local bakery but theirs is so much more chocolaty.  I wonder if it would be better adding 2 squares of chocolate instead of the powder.

I have made this recipe 3 times in 3 weeks and I keep getting raves about it!

I have served it iced and plain.  After the first time, I used 1 extra banana for each loaf, and I found that the banana flavour was more prominent that way.  I also saved some chocolate chipes and sprinkled them on top before baking (for presentation).
Thanks for submitting this recipe- I will definitely keep making it!

This is a big favorite for everyone I know who has tried this bread.  I made mini-loaves for our bake sale (recipe yields six small loaf pans instead of two regular-sized) and had to cut the baking time almost in half.  I also use miniature chocolate chips for this recipe.  I always leave the loaves in the pans to cool for about 10-15 minutes after removing them from the oven before take them out and placing on cooling racks for another 30 minutes.  Great recipe!!!!!

Considering past reviews I put half the cocoa powder and sugar and though it was a moist caked, which I love... it got very hard on the outside. Not bad, but definitely, I have baked better ones.

This is delicious!  The addition of the chocolate really makes for a great change in banana bread.  I cut the recipe in half to make one big loaf, and the 60 minute cook time was perfect.  Make this one!

Absolutely decadent! Rich, moist, & delicious banana bread that's perfect for a chocolate fix, too. :) Followed the directions exactly & this bread baked up nicely in exactly 1 hour. Will definitely be making this one again & I might try adding chopped walnuts next time for additional yuminess. Thank you for sharing the recipe! We love it!

Made allergen free and turned out great. Quite a few changes, of course, and cut in half - flax seed meal for egg, canola oil, 1 cup sorghum flour, 1/2 cup potato starch, and 2T corn flour, 1/2 t xanthan, added 1 t salt, 1 t baking powder, heavy shake cinnamon and 1 t espresso powder. Instead of fake sour cream, I added a couple tablespoons of coconut milk. Baked at 350, 8 mini loaf pan, 30 minutes.

absolutely delicious, I have never had a better banana bread.  It's great for the chocolate lover. I didn't change a thing other than use a bundt pan, and baked for 80 minutes.  It was done to perfection. Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely be using this one for potlucks.

This is my new favorite recipe for using up overripe bananas!  I only made 1/2 a batch, and I used muffin tins instead of loaf pans.  I ran out of sour cream and so I only put in 1/2 of what the recipe stated.  They still turned out very very moist and delicious, and not at all too soft as some other raters reported.  For the chocolate, I used 1/2 cut up milk chocolate bars (leftover from making S'mores!) and 1/2 cut up dark chocolate bars.  I filled the muffin tins maybe 1/3 of the way full and baked them for 15 minutes.  I got 20 muffins, although I think I would've had more if the raw batter weren't so yummy!  Some of it didn't make it into the pans.  :)

This recipe is super moist, and so good.  I'll add extra cocoa next time to make a more chocolatee flavor.  I also subsituded yogert for sour cream since I had none on hand.

Yum! I used half brown sugar rather than all white, added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and a dash of salt and a little cinnamon. I also used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I used a vegan egg subsitute powder and the loaves still baked up beautifully. Great flavor, great texture. Thanks :)

Needs a bit more cocoa or melted chocolate to make it truly chocolaty. Otherwise, SO good. Moist, strong banana flavor and delicious.

This recipe is awesome.  I usually hate to share it, but I must otherwise my clothes wouldn't fit.  I do cut the recipe in half, and substitute part of the butter with applesauce.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  So moist-- unbelievable, especially if you wrap it in foil and let it sit a day or two before cutting!

I have made this twice now.  The first time was good, but it was more like a chocolate cake with banana flavour, which I thought didn't work so well.  The second time I separated the two flavours, and it was the best banana cake I've ever tasted - no joke.  My husband doesn't like banana cake & he even commented it was the best I'd ever made (I've made a lot :-) So, I omitted the cocoa powder entirely, used brown sugar instead of white, added an extra banana & doubled the chocolate (I used dark chocolate chunks).  Oh, and I sprinkled the top with brown sugar before putting it in the oven.  The result was a moist banana cake with gushy chocolate chunks, and a crunchy sugary top.  So good.  It's even better the next day (I warm it in the microwave for a few seconds).  Yumm!  I'll be making this again - alot!

Here's a neat twist I tried...I left out the cocoa, melted the chocolate chips.  Then mixed the melted chips with about a cup + of the banana batter.  Poured the rest of the banana batter in the pan, layering in the chocolate batter. Swirl with a knife and ta da!  Marbled Banana Bread.

I was expecting this to be dynamite but it was just okay, which really surprised me. I love banana bread, love chocolate, this should have been a slam dunk. I re-read the recipe after making it and realized what was missing - no salt! I think that would have made all the difference in the world. I might try this again and add a little salt next time.

Seeing as how banana has a fairly overpowering taste in baked goods, I used a giant spoonful of peanut butter in lieu of half of the banana called for.  It was good.

I halved the recipe in my head, but by accident added the regular amount of baking soda (yikes!!) and cocoa.  Still delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

YUMMY. Cut the recipe in half and had to leave out the chips because I didn't have them. Subbed Greek yogurt for the sourcream and they came out great. 1/2 recipe made 12 muffins. Baked at 350 for 25 min.

Very yummy and easy to make! I used 2 cups white wheat flour and 1 cup AP flour.  I didn't have sour cream, so I used 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt (1 - 4oz container Activia) and 1/2 cup half & half.  Tasted great and nice to change up the regular banana bread!  I made 6 mini loaves and two 8 x 4 1/2 in pans.

I've made this 3 times over the past few months it is soooo delish! Since the recipe makes 2 Breads once they cool down I wrap them in wax paper then tightly in foil and I freeze one I find it tastes even better out of the freezer (I defrost in the fridge overnight) thank you for posting this is a keeper!

I thought this bread was good but a bit to dense and heavy for my liking.  I found it didn't rise a lot and found looking at pictures a lot of people had the same experience.  It is definitely a good combo of banana and chocolate though.  When I have made chocolate zucchini all you taste is chocolate where here there is definitely lots of banana flavor.  Think all in all I like plain banana bread better.  Thanks anyway.

First time I made these sugar free by substituting splenda for the sugar.  Also used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 2 cups AP flour.   2nd time I made these, *not sugar free*, used 1 cup WWP flour and 2 cups AP flour, 1 cup toasted chopped walnuts, 1 cup packed brown sugar plus 1 cup white sugar and a 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Really delicious.  Everyone loved this banana bread.  I did follow the advice of one reviewer and combined dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately, made a whole in the center of the dry ingredients and added the wet along with the sour cream.  I halved the recipe and made only 1 loaf.  It turned out great.

I love this bread! I did change it a bit to make it more healthy by using 1 cup Splenda, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup wheat flour and 2 cups white flour. Although I changed the original recipe I can say that it is a solid recipe to use. Moist and chocolatey this one is definitely a keeper!

This was easy to make and a nice change.  With all the mashed bananas in this, I didn't think it really needed a cup of fat (margarine, whatever you want to use).  I ended up using a half cup of oil and it was fine - no need to add in unnecessary calories.  I went by the recipe for everything else - and used the mini-chocolate chips for better distribution.  Will serve this at the B&B occasionally.

I have made this recipe twice and both times got great reviews. I don't think there is enough cocoa powder though so I double it now that I have madeit once per directions. I also used 1 cup of mini chocolate chip since I had those on hand but I don't think it made much difference.

DEEELISH! I still like the Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins from this site better, but only barely. This recipe is moist, just sweet enough without being over the top, and irresistable! Mmm...

No kidding! I get requests for this recipe whenever I make it... and you will too, believe me! Not only is it moist and flavorful, it's got that perfect combination of cocoa, choco chips and banana. Too delicious for words, so go ahead a make this bread today! Not to mention, it's such a great bread to freeze for that future potluck or "go-to" gift for a friend.

I made this recipe using a bundt pan as recommended by another individual.  It came out good and everyone at work like it but it was a bit heavy for me.  I'd make it again for a pot luck or such.

Awesome! Definitely use 6 large bananas. You could really cut back on the butter as it does come out oily.  It is extremely moist, esp. after freezing it  for 1-2 weeks (it was even better). I will make it again and again. Thank you!

I made two loaves of this bread for our baby shower.   All I heard were rave reviews and there weren't any leftovers- unfortunately!  The only change I made was to use 2/3 cup of butter instead of 1 cup.

You've got to love chocolate to love this recipe and luckily, I do!  Rich and dense, this is almost like a pound cake.  I used individual fluted tube pans and reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes.  It yielded roughly ten (10) individual loafs, perfect for Christmas gifts for the neighbors.  This will be an annual recipe for our family!

The only thing that could make make my family enjoy banana bread more is the addition of chocolate.  I also added a few pecans.  This recipe is very easy and very tasty.

This bread is soooo good!  It definitly has more of a chocolate taste than a banana taste, which is fine with me.  I used mini chocolate chips and it came out great.  My loaf pans are smaller that 9x5, so I made a few muffins as well as the two loaves of bread.  This is a super moist bread, YUM!

I take baked goods into work quite frequently.  This is BY FAR my most requested recipe!  This is the most moist, yummy bread that I have ever had!  Very easy to prepare, also.  I have used 4-6 bananas (depending on what I have had on hand) and still have come out with great results each time!  
I do have to note, though, that since this is such a dense and moist bread, you MUST use good (aka sturdy, heavy duty) bread pans.  Do NOT try to put this into two small (8x4)loaf pans- they must be the 9x5 pans, otherwise it will not cook properly!  I do not usually cook it all of the way till a toothpick comes out clean, just till it doesn't come out gooey looking!  It will continue to set up after baking and you will have a very moist bread.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Almost too moist, although it is still very good. An extremely heavy bread that is more like a dessert.

I was a bit worried about how this rather unusual banana bread would turn out, but it was a big hit.  I didn't use ripe enough bananas, though, so I found the banana flavour a bit muted.  I also had some problems during the baking process - I took it out too soon and ended up having to put it back in after it sank in the middle.  I don't know if this was the reason for its texture, which I found slightly disappointing as it was more like a pudding than a cake.  So don't take it out until it passes the toothpick test!

My family loved this bread!  I also used 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla and sprinkled my pans with cinnamon sugar before pouring in the batter.  I also used chocolate chunks instead of chips.  It turned out great!

This recipe was great. I added one teaspoon of salt, and added one tsp. of vanilla. I tried it the original way, and it seemed a little bland. After I made the changes it was perfect. It was fun to make and my neighbors love me for it.

This is a great change from the everyday banana bread.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted vanilla yogurt and it was excellent.  Very moist.

This was the best chocolate banana bread recipe I have ever tried!  It was very easy, and the results were incredible.  It's a very moist cake. I made one large loaf and four mini loaves for friends.  I baked the mini loaves for 40 minutes.  I added an extra half cup of chocolate chips, so the end result was very chocolatey.  The kids loved it too.

This Chocolate Banana Bread is wonderful!  I've made it so many times.  It's the first thing my grandchildren ask for when they walk through the door.  I haven't rated this before as I wasn't a member of allrecipes.com but now I am, mainly because I wanted everyone to know how delicious this is. I've cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, also used equal amounts of brown and white sugar, also use mini choc chips.  It's not just the kids who enjoy this tasty loaf!

Edit:  I just made this again the past weekend; same awesome results, didn't change a thing.  It makes two pans, but they don't last long in my house.  I can't count the times I have made this delicious banana bread, for the cottage in the summer, for school lunches..... for sweet 16 birthday parties.   It is requested every time I go somewhere and it is the first thing to be eaten every time!  Smells awesome in the oven, so moist and the chocolate chips gives it a nice texture.  I never change a thing and the recipe is perfect how it is.  I think people put bananas in my freezer just so I can make it again!!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe... my friends and family thank you.  Hot out of the oven, umm.....I can smell it now.  I also love how it makes two pans so you can freeze one for later and it keeps perfectly! 

EDIT:  I made this last weekend and realized I didn't have margarine so I had to use butter.  The butter bubbled up the side of the pan and I thought it was ruined but it turned out a lot moister.  I think next time, I'll stick with the original recipe but even with the butter, you just can't fail.  This is AWESOME!!!

This recipe is great. It is kind of more like a pound cake and less like banana bread but still very good. Not gooey at all like some recipes I've had. I liked the chocolate flavor a lot. Banana bread is not my favorite, so this is good for me because it is not just banana flavor! I used butter (added salt as well) instead of margarine and full-fat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and both worked out really well. I like the slight crunch on the outside of the loaf the yogurt provides. I will make this again!

This is delicious bread.  I made half the recipe and was generous with the cocoa.  Will definately make again.  Really gives banana bread a new twist.

Made this for the 1st time last week!!! Lemme say...it is AWESOME!!!!!! I've gotta so many raves from my family and my work. Note: This mix/batter makes a lot. I was able to make 1 9 x 13 pan and a loaf pan.

Changes I made:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
7 bananas (might do 8 next time or add banana extract)
1 cup REGULAR sour cream
2 tsp cinnamon

Really good! I halved the serving size to better suit my family. It came out very moist, very tasty. My husband looked like he was about to melt in a gooey puddle of rapture when he tried it, haha.

I think I was expecting it to be more chocolaty.  If I was blindfolded, I would guess banana bread with chocolate chips.  It was good but I would add more cocoa next time.

My 7 year old thinks it's great!  So do I!  I halved the recipe because I never have that many bananas to bake with.  Perfect for one loaf; although I think we would be able to eat 2 loaves easily :-)  I also cut the amount of sugar in half as I had read from another review.  Perfectly balanced sweetness, chocolate, and banana.  Finally I used butter instead of margarine.  So yummy!  I saved this recipe and will definitely make it again.

This is the best bread ever!  My family raved about it.  I used real butter in place of the margarine, but everything else was the same as the recipe.  Excellent!

I love it as written. I read all the reviews and said enough. Just make it once as written, then decide what additions if any you'd like. I'm glad I didn't not add anything, it really is great how it is. Maybe, just maybe next time I may add coconut or white chocolate chips.

I made this bread yesterday afternoon, and I love it! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  Aside from scaling it down to make only one loaf, the only things I did differently were to replace 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat, use mini chocolate chips (I prefer them in breads), and to replace the sour cream with strawberry flavored kefir.  I did the last because I thought I had sour cream but realized too late that I didn't.  Oops.  I used 1/2 c of the kefir, and it turned out fine.  I just had to bake it for an extra 10 min because of the extra moisture.

I also found that heating slices in the microwave for 15-20 sec helps bring out some of the banana flavor, for those who were complaining that the chocolate covered it up.

So rich and chocolatey! The only change I made to the recipe was to use wheat flour instead of all purpose. A little bit better for you, but still sinfully good!

I had a lot of old bananas sitting around but wasn't in the mood for regular banana bread, so I gave this recipe a try. I used slightly less regular sour cream and fewer chocolate chips, only because that was all I had on hand, but the bread turned out wonderfully nonetheless. I love the fact that both flavors come through and neither overpowers the other. Thinking of serving one of the loaves as a dessert by drizzling some chocolate sauce over each slice and serving with a scoop of ice cream.

i really liked this recipe. I halved it down to 6 servings (i didn't have enough bananas) got 24 mini muffins out of it. (baked 12 mins)  I did add a bit more cocoa (which i probably won't do next time) I didn't have chips but i know that they'd be great with them, i think pb chips sound good with it too.

I made this tonight and all I want to add to the wonderful reviews is that I used whole wheat flour and it still turned out great!  (I try to sneak extra fiber in for us whenever I can)  I didn't tell my husband and he didn't notice the difference.  

I also added about a cup of freeze dried strawberries and walnuts and called it banana split bread.  Although, as many other reviewers have stated, it turns out more like cake than bread.  Moist, wonderful cake.

Great recipe, it adapts well to changes and additions.

My husband and boys gave this banana bread a 5-star rating!  I was not as impressed and thought the chocolate was a little overpowering - but I'm not a huge chocolate fan.  Overall the bread was very easy to throw together and was very moist.  Not sure if it was my oven or not but it took about 20 minutes longer to cook than what was in the directions.  Note - this makes 2 VERY BIG loaves.  Could probably do 3 smaller loaves if you wanted.  Definately will make again for the family.

My daughters soccer team scarfed this down in record time!  The next day four mom's and 1 dad called me for the recipe!  I always make the recipe as is if I am rating it.  Having said that we are Celiac at our house so I have to exchange gluten free flour for every flour recipe.  Not one of the girls noticed any difference.  This is delicious!

Loved this recipe.  I cut it in half, and then made it into muffins/cupcakes.  I got 18 muffins out of 1/2 of a batch.  I used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 butter in place of the margarine, and they were very moist.  The banana chocolate flavor combination was excellent - neither flavor over-powered the other.  I frosted these with banana butter frosting, also from this site, and that was the perfect frosting for these.

Adding my own rave review here.   This bread is insanely, ridiculously good.   DBF said it was like the chocolate part of a banana split.  His co-workers inhaled both loaves (except for the two pieces I cut for us).  I was skeptical about the combination but with six bananas taking up freezer space the temptation was too great.   I'm so glad I did.  The flavor combination is terrific, with neither banana nor chocolate overwhelming the other.   A definite keeper.   Thanks for sharing, Tracie.   PS, I cut each loaf into 8 slices and then in half down the middle for a total of 32 servings.

Great recipe!  I made it into muffins and substituted coconut oil for margarine and whole wheat pastry flour for the AP flour.  They turned out a tiny bit flat, but that may be from the coconut oil.

This is great, but for a lower cal version I: use splenda instead of sugar, and applesauce instead of margarine... I also added peanut butter chips AND choc. chips, and change 1tsp baking powder in place of one of the baking soda tsp. Oh and I added an extra banana. Turned out good! Next time I'll add walnuts.

Excellent! I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of cocoa and vanilla, and baked in a "Perfect Brownie Pan" to get 18 individual "square muffins", I suppose you'd call them.  This moist, chocolatey  bread is just delicious, and one I will make again for sure! Thanks, Tracie!

Very nice bread!  I will begin by saying that this was neither dominant in the chocolate or the banana flavour, so it was a nice change!  I made a few modifications as I typically do with any muffins/loaves, but I am sure this loaf does not need changing.  I just like to cut some calories and fat if I can!  That said, I only used one egg with 5 whites (had a carton open), 1/4 cup becel along with 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 7 bananas (this is what I use when I make my normal loaf that I double!) and I did not measure my choc chips, just threw in a couple of handfuls of mini (these work best!) semi sweet ones.  I also reduced the sugar to only about 2/3 cup (yes, it's drastic from 2 full cups).  I always find that the overripe bananas add sweetness, as do the choc chips, so to me, 2 cups is way too much, but that's just my opinion!  Will make this again, thanks for the post!

Very good.  The choc. chips make it more of a dessert.  You could just leave them out and let the cocoa powder add a subtle taste.  I like it both ways.

Not too chocolatey, just right. I personally would have given it 4 stars because I thought it was good, but not to die for. I brought it to work and everyone scarfed it down, loved it, so hence the crowd-pleasing 5 stars! I had to bake it a little longer than the directions said. I adjusted the recipe to use 4 bananas since that is what I had and with that amount, I made a large loaf and two mini loaves. Used mini chocolate chips too. I highly recommend trying this recipe for a change to the usual banana bread!

I halves the recipe (cause i only have 4 medium bananas - i use em all). I only use 150gr of sugar and use dark chocolate chip, but its sweet enough for me. The end result is not as smooth though (it has lots of cracks) but the taste is superb! It was moist and you could actually taste the banana and the chocolate. Divine. Would make it again soon.  But if your oven is fan forced, i recommend putting it on 160C on lower rack (coz mine burnt a bit on top, and i have to lower it to 130C for the last 30mnts and move it to the lower rack).

I always have over-ripe bananas on hand because I just pop them in the freezer when I have one or two laying around.  When I get enough I make banana bread.  We thought the banana flavor came through very nicely, even though it is a chocolate banana bread.  I added walnuts and a teaspoon of salt (I was suprised it didn't call for salt.)  By far one of the best quickbreads I've made.

December 2011...Made this again and added one cup of coconut...  WOW!!!

This is "THE BEST" banana bread.  Did not change a thing except I added chopped walnuts.  The recipe made two breads.  I gave one to my neighbor who loved it!!  I gave half of mine to my boyfriend's mother and she loved it.  She also gave some to her neighbor who raved about it.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Thank you for sharing it!

This recipe is awesome.It's really moist and the chocolate flavor doesn't overpower the taste of the banana. I made some substitutions to make it a little bit healthier. I used half white sugar and half splenda. Non-fat yogurt instead of the sour cream and half whole wheat flour and half regular all purpose flour. Let me tell you, it came out fantastic. Don't be afraid to substitute to make it a little bit healthier. The end product came out excellent. I'll be making it again and again. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. Most everyone enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed in that it wasn't the flavor I wanted or expected. I think next time I'll make it without the cocoa so I'll have more of the banana flavor.

I used 1/2 c. cocoa, 1/2 c. walnuts, and 1/2 c. cinnamon-raisin peanut butter. This bread was very moist and the flavor was pretty good. I'd definitely make it again.

There just aren't words for how awesome this bread is! It disappears every time I make it! Super moist and delicious!

I haven't had any problem making it in a full-size loaf. About halfway through the cooking, I rest a piece of foil gently over the top of it, and that keeps the top from getting too browned while the inside cooks.

This is more like a dessert bread. I found it took a long time for the center to cook while the outside edges got overcooked and my oven was set at 350. It is so moist in the inside of the loaf that its almost wet. Not appetizing at all.

This is a decadently rich-tasting *chocolate* cake/bread. I'm getting raves over the flavour, but if you're looking for banana bread per se, this is not it. I will definitely make this again, but for dessert or a snack. It is absolutely wonderful. I used fat-free sour cream, white and brown sugars, and reduced the total sugars by about half, and it is still delicious.

My mother proclaimed this bread excellent and ended up eating it and only it for dinner last night.  It was still warm when she tried it and she said that with a little butter, it was like a dessert.  I accidently bought milk chocolate chips but they were delicious anyways!  I did cook it for about 10 minutes longer then suggested and it turned out perfectly done.  P.S.  She ate it for breakfast also!

FANTASTIC!! I halved the recipe to make only one loaf.  I usually only make regular banana bread but this was so good, I'm only going to make this from now on!  Only one thing....like other reviewers, I found it toooo moist/wet, even though cooked.  I think next time I will use less mashed banana and a little less sour cream.

Mmmm!!!  This is absolutely the best banana bread recipe I've ever tasted!  It's really moist, and the chocolate and banana combination is incredible.  I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, doubled the chocolate chips and increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon, and it is fantastic!  This one gets an A+!!

Dear Tracie,

We really enjoyed your recipe. My children loved the moist loaves this recipe made. We halved it the first time just to test.  We omitted the cocoa, replaced it with flour, and used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream(because we did'nt have any on hand).  Then we added a handful of chocolate chips.  Mmmm! Next time we will double it!
Thank You.

If you don't realize (i know, i know!) that baking soda and powder are two different things, this recipe can be unwittingly mutated to produce an inedible, gel-filled banana brick, though nicely studded on the outside with chocolate chips.  One obviously has to try again...

I have used this recipe several times and each time I have been told, "This is the BEST banana bread EVER", "This is the most moist banana bread I have ever tasted", "This bread is amazing"; to name a few. The comments that it is gooey and it takes longer to bake than the directions indicate, should take in account that with any baking there are several variables, oven, altitude, ripeness of the bananas, etc. Use the one hour as a benchmark. I have found it takes between an hour and 1 hour 15 minutes. Don't forget to do the toothpick test. Also, if you don't want chocolate taste in your banana bread. Don't make "Chocolate Banana Bread" and stick with the standard banana bread recipe. If I could give this over 5 stars I would.

I have made this a few times now and my kids love it! I've used the sour cream with great results, but I have also subbed it for yogurt and canned coconut milk and they all taste great! Just realize that if you use more cocoa powder you will end up with more of a chocolate cake texture, the cocoa powder makes it a lighter loaf. I always half this recipe and it fits in my 9x5 loaf pan with no leftover batter. I don't add the extra chocolate chips either and the kids still love it! A great after school treat!

I subbed in butter because I refuse to use margarine.  I also left out the sour cream because I can't eat cream.  It was still delicious.  My dad, his wife, and my boyfriend couldn't keep their hands off the loaf and I gobbled the muffins (bake about 20 minutes).  My family put whipped cream on it for an extra treat.
I ended up making a loaf, 12 muffins, and a cake because I only have one loaf pan and I didn't feel like cleaning it between loafs.  I prefer the muffins, so next time I'll make more of those.

This is an excellent combination of bananas and chocolate.  I used a bit of dark spicy chocolate pieces instead of the choc. chips.

Not much to say except...YUM...I added a bit of salt to punch up the chocolate flavors, a bit more cocoa  and mini chocolate chips instead of regular ones, but these were small changes. Will be keeping this recipe for a long time.

This bread is delicious! Ive made it twice, and found that if I use mini-chocolate chips there is a little more yum in every bite.

I used half brown sugar and 3/4 cup of whole milk because I didn't have any sour cream or yogurt.  And I made one of the loaves into muffins (bake about 15 minutes).  So delicious!  My kids loved it, too, of course.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe, I added 1 tsp salt, and 1 cup chopped walnuts, I just like walnuts or pecans in banana bread.  I also reduced baking time to 45 minutes.  I made this again, just loved it so I made a little change again, instead of chocolate chips, I put in peanut butter chips, wow.  If you like chocolate, peanut butter and banana, you will love this!

I would normally not try a banana bread with chocolate but this one is very good.   Do suggest at least half the margarine is substituted for butter because you get a richer flavor.   When adding the sour cream and dry ingredients do not overmix or you will have a tough result.

Great bread and I used many of the suggested changes from other reviews.  Butter, instead of margarine, 1/2 white - 1/2 brown sugar, and I used full fat sour cream, not light.  My co-workers loved it!

Very moist. I made a few changes based on personal preference but I don't think any of them would effect the original recipe. Instead of 1c butter I used 1/2c butter and 1/2c applesauce, cut the sugar by half and then did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.

Absolutely delish!!  Hubby is not big on sweets & he came back for 2nd's of this.  Used butter & 1/2white-1/2brown sugar as others suggested.  Personally, I would have preferred a little more banana flavor, so may add banana/decrease cocoa next time.  Neighbor said it was perfect as is... Also, took about 1 hr 20 mins to bake & just about overflowed 2 loaf pans.

This was so moist and delicious! We only put half the amount of sugar, used half a cup more chocolate chips (used milk chocolate because that's what we preferred over semisweet), and added a cup of walnuts. It was a hit.

This was an incredibly moist, very delicious banana bread. I replaced the margarine with half butter and half applesauce, replaced the flour with whole wheat and only used 1.5 cups of sugar. Even after the healthy alterations it still tasted wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

I just loved this version of banana bread -- it's actually more like a chocolate banana cake -- moist, kinda rich.  I will make it in a bundt pan next time -- I followed the recipe exactly and results were fabulous.  Definitely a keeper.

At first I thought that 6 bananas was a lot, but now that the bread is made I'm so glad that I went all out--it is very moist and the banana flavor is just right. I did not have any cocoa in the house so did not add that to the recipe. Also, I used whole grain flour and the bread turned out wonderful. I ended up making 22 muffins and 4 mini loaves. I really wish I did have the cocoa and will make this again with it. Thanks to whoever mentioned that I should use a BIG bowl--there really was a lot of batter.

This was easy to make for a first timer and came out soft and nice. I skipped the sour cream though, and added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips for a more chocolate taste, which was was not over powering.

My substitutions were somewhat dictated by circumstance.  I substituted 1 cup of unsalted butter & 1 cup plain low fat yogurt. Instead of white sugar I used 1 cup dark brown sugar topped with Turbinado Sugar. I only had 3 eggs & 4 bananas, so that meant 1 egg and 2 bananas were omitted.  I added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 additional tsp. of vanilla.  The extra bonus ingredient was  1 cup Milk & Dark chocolate covered almonds coarsely chopped & 1/2 cup 60% cocoa chips (in place of the semisweet chocolate chips).  Thanks for offering up such a great recipe. Yum.

This turned out excellent! Instead of margarine (since I didn't have any) I used about 1/4C crisco and 1/2C vegetable oil. It was very good! My kids loved it too! I made half of it in a muffin tin and cooked for 20 mins and the other half will be in a loaf pan, I have yet to cook it though, its still in the fridge!

delicious!  to reduce cholesterol, i used 1/2 cp of egg beaters instead of eggs, replaced margarine w/ i can't believe it's not butter, and replaced sour cream with plain greek yogurt.  mine finished in less than 60 min., so watch when you cook.

Very good.  I put in 3/4 c. maple syrup/honey mix instead of sugar, added maybe 3/4 c. quick oats and a few Ts of flax seed.  They turned out great!

DELISH! I JUST made this recipe and hurried on to review! I made this recipe into a muffin pan because I didn't have a loaf pan on me. The muffins baked for 30 minutes and came out just perfect! I added some chopped almonds since I had some on hand and it gives a nice crunch! I will definitely make this again.

So much better than reg. banana bread. I used butter instead of margarine.  Used 1/4 less sugar (don't miss it).  Used the new blended 1/2 white 1/2 wheat flour.  Added about 1 cup semi-sweet choco chips and about 1 cup macadamia dark choc mixture.  New stuff I found an WM.  Also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sourcream.  So moist.  Done in 1 hr.  Don't know whether to keep or give the second loaf.  Try it!

Awesome bread! Made as is, except halved the recipe. You won't be disappointed. I'm not even a banana bread fan, but am a chocolate fan. So yummy! You'll be going back for more! :)

Great cake, very moist with a nice crunchy exterior (baked for about 65-70min.). I used butter instead of margarine and yogourt instead of sour cream. I also added chopped walnuts. Came out delicious!

OMG! This is awesome!  I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and plan to cut it down to 1 cup next round.  I also used 1 stick of margarine and 1/2 cup of applesauce and it came out perfect!

Really good and forgiving!  I did not have sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt and it worked just fine.  I also used less sugar (1 1/2 cups)and bananas (3), baked it for an hour in a bundt pan.  Yum!

This is an awesome chocolate banana bread recipe. I've made it at least two dozen times and it's my fiance's absolute favorite. If you use larger bananas, you'll get more moist bread and vice versa. I think it's plenty sweet already so I only use 1/3 cup of sugar (for 1 loaf). Also depending on what I have on hand, I use bittersweet or milk chocolate chips sometimes. The bread always come out great!

I love this recipe.  Anytime I have extra bananas, this gets made.  Sometimes I'll halve the recipe for one loaf, other times it will be as written and I'll make one 9x5 loaf and four mini loaves.  Remember the mini's cook quicker, but it just means you can eat that much quicker!

Delicious!  I agree that the banana comes through nicely but subtly, and I only used the 6 bananas.  I also used a bundt pan but at 350F, my bread was just slightly overcooked at 60 minutes, but slightly undercooked at 45.  So start checking at 45 minutes!  It smelled so amazing that I didn't let it cool long enough before trying to get it out of the pan, so it broke in half, but that was my bad!  However, having the hot gooey chocolate banana mess in a bowl was amazing, and if I weren't lactose intolerant I would have put a little vanilla ice cream on top and been in heaven!  I froze half of the bundt to keep myself from devouring the whole thing in 4 days or something ;)  Will let you know how it defrosts!

Delicious! I left out the chocolate chips and doubled the cocoa powder.  Mine turned out very chocolatey with a beautiful texture.  I made this yesterday afternoon and right now I'm waiting for the coffee to brew so I can have this for breakfast :)

Absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was using splenda instead of sugar and I couldn't even tell in the slightest.  It had just enough chocolate and really moist.  Thanks for the submission.  I will definitely make this again.

Very Yummy!!! I did the half brown and white sugar as suggested. I used regular sour cream. And did the heaping cocoa powder. It had to cook 1 hour and 12 minutes before it was done. Well worth the wait!!!!

This is a really good recipe. After reading some of the reviews though, I halved the amount of cocoa and chocolate chips and thought it was just the right amount of chocolate.

Very moist and delicious!  Use real butter instead of margarine because it's so much better for you.  It was so good!  It would probably be very good with walnuts in it too.

Delicious and moist!  I used regular sour cream, mini chocolate chips and only 5 small bananas (because that's what I had on hand).  Next time, I would use 6+ bananas to up the flavor.  A great recipe!

Great recipe.  I had to substitute butter for the margarine and yogart for the sour cream.  I also used Hershey's special dark cocoa (adding a little more then what was called for) and a half cup of walnuts.

The recipe turned out just fine, but the taste of the bread wasn't anything spectacular.  I think the flavors just didn't combine well.  My boyfriend and I had a slice or two each and the rest went to waste.  I was hopeful, but I think it just isn't a flavor combination I like.

This was wonderful! I didn't have choc chips so cut up a dark chocolate bar. The only problem with this was the pieces were bigger than chips and most sank to the bottom. Still great though. Thanks :-)

Very good flavour and really moist.  My kids (and their friends) request this bread often.  Freezes well.

Wow... I never would've thought of this, so THANK YOU, Tracie P.!  Okay, I wanted to make this a little less guilty, so I nixed all the butter (I don't buy margarine), and used a full cup of applesauce.  Cut the sugar in half, and did 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 white.  Only had about 1/2 cup of lite sour cream so I just tossed in some milk.  Alright:  I thought the chocolate chips were totally unnecessary.  It was chocolaty and plenty sweet enough (Next time, I may even cut the sugars more!). And, finally: I added about a tsp of salt.

All thumbs up on this one from my kids and husband. This is a tough feat! The only change I had to make was to bake 2 loaves for 90 minutes, nto the recommended 60 minutes.

My family raved and raved about this bread. I substituted apple sauce for half the fat (used butter instead of margarine) and walnuts for the chocolate chips. I love that it makes two loaves, because the first loaf disappeared in a couple of hours.

I made this bread this morning for something different from your usual banana bread. I make one with a chocolate
cake mix that my husband liked, but I wanted to cut out some of the processed flavor.
I cut this recipe in half to make one loaf. I omitted the chocolate chips (I didn't have any) and used light vanilla yogurt. I was pleased at how nicely this cooked up, it wasn't wet like some banana breads can be. (Like the outside will cook quicker than the inside and you have a half-done banana bread.) This 
made my whole house smell wonderful. 

I plan on frosting it with the Mocha Icing from this site and leaving it out
for my husband when he gets home. I'll
update how it blows over with him.

EDITED: This bread is my-tee-fine. Really moist and flavorful. And even better with the Mocha Glaze. I wouldn't 
make it every day, but it's yummy every once in a while.

I used real butter instead of margarine, and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, because that's what i had on hand. I also used leftover mashed bananas that I had frozen . Came out really moist and delish! The kids and I loved them. I also used a combination of white and semisweet chocolate chips. Most of the changes were not really by choice,(except for the butter) but more by what I had on hand, however, even with all the changes, it came out great! Thanks for sharing!

This was so good. Like others, I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, used part whole wheat flour, and non-fat plain yogurt because I didn't have any sour cream.  I substituted "Lighter Bake," a fat replacement from Sunsweet.com for the margarine.  Everyone loved it!

This was a great recipe.  I changed a few things about it.  I added more vanilla because I am a vanilla freak.  I also added cinnamon and ground cloves for a bit of spice.  I did half brown sugar/half white sugar and added a little more baking soda to compensate for that.  I didn't have chocolate chips, so I took some Hershey's Kisses and Hugs from my candy dish and chopped those up.  It worked well!  I used the KitchenAid to mix everything up.  The bread was moist and delicious, but it is quite dense.  I could taste the bananas and the chocolate, and I thought the flavors blended together nicely.  Tastes great with a little cream cheese!

Wonderful recipe.  I subbed butter for the margerine and used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  The bread is very rich, but worth the calories!

I found this recipe and made it last night.  I was somewhat nervous considering all the vast reviews, but I'm very glad I tried.  This "bread" (I call it cake) is absolutely delicious.  I made a couple of changes.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar (and so glad I did) and used low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Straight from the oven, with the steam and melted chips and small bits of banana...Yum!  This is a monster of a recipe, IMO.  You do need a very large bowl when mixing this.  I also do everything by hand, so it took me well over 10 minutes to prepare it, but I placed it in a 13X9 inch baking pan and it was done at 45 minutes.  Can't wait to go grab another piece now. It is sweet, but not sickenly so.  I highly recommend it.

I may have done something wrong, but this banana bread was so thick...it seemed like it was 99% banana and 10% everything else. I will have to try it again, though.

Unbelievably delicious!! So easy to make and everyone is always super impressed. I prefer butter instead of margarine and ended up using plain yogurt this past go-round instead of sour cream because it was all I had in the fridge. Still delicious. People rave!

So this is the best banana bread I've ever had! I think it must be the cocoa and sour cream that make the difference. It came out beautifully. If you only want a small loaf that will keep fresh, I'd recommend cutting the recipe in half. I like that this called for so many bananas, in case you have a bunch that are over-ripe.

I have to admit when I first tried this fresh out of the oven I wasnt all that impressed.. however that night I stuck it in the fridge and the next morning it was delicious! I think eating it cold just made it a lot more moist than eating it at room temp. Everyone loved this..my boyfriends mother(who is a pro at cooking) even asked for the recipe! I followed the recipe to the "T" except for I added a few extra chocolate chips. Make sure you use a good quality chocolate chip (I used Gheradelli and they seemed to melt in my mouth, every after refridgeration.) Thanks for the recipe.. Im sure Ill be making this again!

Easy on the liquid if you are using frozen bananas.  The bread is excellent but I feel the mixture is on the edge of too wet - if you are using your 6 bananas from the freezer, defrost them and drain extra liquid out of the bowl they defrosted in - otherwise your bread may not bake through.  I am not a walnut lover, but I have found I do like the bread better with 2 cups of crushed walnuts (maybe it's that 'something' that some say is missing).   Haven't tried adding salt - I feel it turns out fine without it (and I use unsalted igredients).

I've been searching for the ultimate banana bread recipe, and after trying about six from this site, this recipe has proved to be head and shoulders above the rest! It is so moist and dense, yet it bakes up high in the pan. So many of the other recipes turned out to be squat little loaves. I left the chocolate chips out, and it still had a nice deep cocoa flavor. Our family loves nuts in everything, but this recipe is perfect without any add-ins - the texture is that good. I doubt I'll bother to bake any other kind of banana bread again. It makes two generous loaves of heavenly bread.

This is such an easy recipe to make.  The only suggestion I had is to add some salt.  I added just a pinch to enhance the taste little more.  I also sprinkled the top of the settled batter with crushed walnuts.

My husband also enjoyed it - and he does not eat anything with sour cream and/or chocolate.  I think I had him the minue he walked in the door and he inhaled the scrumptious aroma.  

Delicious!  I can't say it enough.  I will definitely make this again.  I think I will experiment and use peanut butter morsels next time.  It will be a new adventure!

OH MY GOSH! Heaven in a muffin tin. Well, a cake pan, really. My husband helpfully ruined my loaf pan so this got halved and baked in a tall 8" diameter cake pan (tall was important!) for a little less than an hour. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 teaspoon salt because I never cook with cocoa without adding salt (enhances flavor a lot). Any ripe banana would be proud to become this "bread."

Fantastic. I used extremely ripe bananas, so I didn't notice an overpowering chocolate taste at all; there was a great balance between the two flavors. The only changes to the recipe were to halve it, substitute butter for margarine, and use regular sour cream. Due to my limited pan selection, I had to use an 8x4. This turned out just fine after I omitted what I thought was an appropriate amount of batter for the pan size. I found this single, slightly smaller loaf was completely cooked after about 50 minutes. This recipe was a success and I would most definitely make it again!

I thought this recipe was okay, nothing spectacular.I thought the chocolate was too overpowering, maybe just use the cocoa and not the chocolate chips or visa vera. I will probably try again because I think it could be really great!

Yummy!  A nice change on the traditional banana bread!  This is the first time my banana bread was actually cooked all the way through and not burnt on the bottom.

OH MY GOSH!!! This is just as fun as being a kid again!  First of all I have been bringing dishes to work like crazy and every chance my co-workers get; they sneak into the breakroom like little mice.  This is better than the regular banana nut bread. I suggest for everyone to stick to the exact recipe and eat until it's gone.  Enjoy! and Thx for the experience.

This was ok. It had a lot of "crust" on the top and was very thick and dense. The kids liked it because of the choc chips but I think I will keep searching for another recipe.

Very good banana bread.  We made some just before going on vacation and put it in the freezer, when we got home my daughter had some frozen and said it tasted even better frozen.

Very yummy, very moist bread. Make sure to let the loaf cool completely before attempting to slice it! It's so tender when still warm that it falls apart. Cuts beautifully once fully cooled.

Excellent!  Used an extra banana and half of the butter - still very moist, and had a well-balanced banana and chocolate flavor.  Added 1 cup walnuts.  Also froze the chips before adding to batter to keep them intact.  Cooking time was 1 hr 15 min. using a dark loaf pans.

This is a great recipe.  My husband and I are both chocoholics and we love this for mid-afternoon snack or dessert.  During the holidays my husband will eat this mid-morning!  The only alteration I make is to add 1 cup chopped pecans and I'll add full-fat sour cream is that's all on hand.  I've made this a half-dozen times and always use my kitchen aid.  I also cook it about 1 hour for the small loaf pans.

Very moist, but you don't get a distinctive flavor of chocolate or bananna.  I prefer either bananna bread or chocolate muffins.  I was disappointed because I love the flavors of chocolate and banannas together.

This tastes really really good for a chocolate cake/bread, but it doesn't satisfy the urge for the banana bread my Nana used to make.  As a chocolate lover, I loved this recipe.  I read the reviews, and the cooking time was off for me, too.  To avoid burning, I baked at 325 for 1 hour 20 min., and it came out perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend using a high quality cocoa powder (like Scharfenberger)... if you use Hershey's or something like that then you won't get the rich, chocolately taste. It really makes a difference!

I too am an odd-ball like below, but this recipe just didn't work out well for me at all. I agree that the bake time was way off.  It took longer than an hour and still seemed to be loose in the middle. I was so excited to try this as I love chocolate banana bread and haven't been able to find a recipe to keep.  I guess all I can say is, just be prepared to possibly not have it turn out that well.

Very moist, fudgy and delicious!  I used smaller pans for tea bread size slices and mini chocolate chips for better distribution of chocolate.  I've made this several times - each with perfect results.  Elegant!

This is absolutely the best banana bread I have ever tasted!  I have baked it in mini loaves and given as gifts and have gotten rave reviews from everyone.  It's got just a hint of chocolate that's not overpowering, yet it will satisfy a chocolate lover as well.  I added the new Hershey's Dark Chocolate Chips to it the last time and it made it even better!

This bread was dense, sweet, chocolately, and good-tasting.  I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup.  And I baked them in mini loaf pans, which left absolutely not one smidgen of goo in the loaf.  They were baked perfectly.  I suggest making the recipe called Banana Crumb Muffins and adding chocolate chips.  Those are still my favorite, but I may make these loaves again.

Very moist - nice change from regular banana bread. I sliced it and spooned canned cherries over the top when I served it - reminded everyone of black forest cake.

This was just okay.  Not bad tasting but alittle bland.  My kids didn't even really like it and usually anything with chocolate gets gobbled up as soon as it's out of the oven.  I might try it like one of the reviewers suggested, adding a little more vanilla and salt to add more flavor.

This recipe was a big hit at our house.  Even my daughter who doesn't like bananas very much said to give it 5 stars!  I will definitely make this again and again.

My daughter and I mixed this together and had a great time.  She is 5.  I have shared this bread with my co-workers and freinds and all love it.  I am also sharing the recipe.   This recipe changes banana bread in our house forever.  We love it....

I used a bunt pan, had to cook for 1 hr. 45 min. but it turned out fabulous. Cooking this long seemed to cause a slight “crust” on the outsides, but we liked this texture - a lot!

This recipe is great! I followed it exactly as written, but instead of baking it as two loaves, I put all of the batter into one bundt pan. It took about 90mins at 350, and it came out perfectly! I finished it by drizzling a simple glaze over it (approx. 1 1/2c icing sugar, 1 1/2T milk, 1 1/2t vanilla) - it's deeelish! Will definitely be making this one again.

This is an excellent banana bread/cake.  Very rich and great flavour.  My husband couldn't stop eating it and he is a guy who doesn't like sweets.  I made a few loaves and reviews were all the same. People raved and had multiple pieces. This I will make over and over.

Very yummy recipe!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I also cut back on the sugar (I do on most recipes) - using about 1/2 of the amount.  And I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  It came out wonderfully.  The office and friends loved it!  I will keep this as a staple recipe.  You can also use mini loaf pans and bake for about 40 minutes.  Makes a great gift in this size.

Great recipe!  Like Kchoskins I added a tsp and a half of cinnamon and a tsp of salt.  I also substituted applesauce for half of the Margarine and Butter for the other half.  I used Splenda/Brown Sugar mix instead of white sugar, (lets me, a pre-diabetic, enjoy the Banana Bread as well.  And, I added two bananas more because I had them.
Guess I don't understand the reviewer who gave the recipe two stars because he/she doesn't like the combination of chocolate and bananas.  The answer seems obvious, don't make it!  But giving it a poor rating because of individual taste differences hardly seems fair.

This is one of my goto recipes. Unless there's a dietary restriction, I'm morally against all things 'light' and have always used full fat sour cream. My loaves and 'muffins' produce equally lovely results. The recipe is large so, if possible, use a 5qt mixing bowl or bigger. Halving the recipe works too. Also, FYI-I'm no longer at the mercy of the banana! If you have bananas that aren't ripe enough to bake with, they can be put in the oven (at the lowest temp) for an hour or so and pull them out when black.

I loved this chocolate banana bread.  So moist!  I cut the recipe in half, except for the chocolate chips... I used a bundt pan, and baked for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect!

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it is DYNAMITE. The bread is moist and fluffy, and the chocolate is a delicious touch. I substituted the margarine for coconut oil, cuz I have some, and it gives the bread a light coconutty taste. I also used 0% Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream cuz it was all I had and my gallbladder doesn't like too much fat. I added nuts for texture and left out the chocolate chips and it's still amazing! This is definitely a new favorite.

So EASY to make, whenever I see 'managers markdown' bananas I make this. Quick, healthy and delicious. I turn them into muffins (or mini muffins) and get a TON of muffins... but they are devoured in a day or so. We take them to baseball games because they play during dinner time, and the kids are held over until our late dinner. If you've never baked before, make these first and you'll have the confidence to take over the world- one baked good at a time. This is, truly, a no fail recipe.

Sensational recipe!  I made this for my family and now I have to make it periodically for them because it has become a favorite.  Good thing - it's easy!  No need to change the recipe... but I most often use the mini chocolate chips.  And, since ovens and pans differ, start checking yours at around 50 minutes. Use any pans you want, but it's perfect in the two loaf pans - one to keep and eat, and one to share!

My bad, only used 1/4 cup of butter by mistake as I was making one loaf and cut recipe in half then halved the butter again, oops ..but to my surprise it came out wonderfully, maybe it was the regular sour cream used instead of lite =)  I will definitely try again, already eating my 2nd slice & enjoying very much.

Easy and delicious. I usually use unsalted butter when baking but opted for salted butter since the recipe doesn't include additional salt. Half the recipe made 24 smaller muffins that baked perfectly in 15 minutes.

super yummy!  I used all whole wheat flour, substituted applesauce instead of margarine, used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2 and it is so good and slightly healthier!  I had no problems with it rising and it is super moist and chocolaty.

Chocolatey heaven! From nibbling on the batter,I knew this bread was going to be delicious! I even added a good amount of raspberries to mine. It gave the bread a more complex flavor, with tarty sweet deliciousness in every bite!! Also, I used plain Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream to make it healthier.

I cut the recipe in half for one loaf.  Also used half the sugar (1/2 cup) and 1/4 c butter, 1/4 c shortening (my preference).  Froze well.  Very moist and tasty with a subtle banana flavor.   This recipe should not be graded low because of the combination of bananas and chocolate as one person did.  It was their choice to make this recipe which clearly by the title combines chocolate and banana!  I don't get how one can give a low grade based on that!  Would make again.

Just baked mine in a glass 9x13 for 85 minutes. Generous with the sour cream, probably 1.5 cups, added a bit of cinnamon and subbed butterscotch chips for chocolate chips....oh.my.goodness!

Great! I made it as per the recipe except I only used 1cup sugar which was plenty, especially since I used very ripe bananas! Also, it says to use 6 bananas but that can largly vary with the size of the bananas used, so I used 2 cups of mashed bananas and it turned out very moist :) And one final note about the chocolate chips...use normal or small ones. I used large ones and it was a little 'mushey' around the chips!

I cut the recipe in half and only made one loaf and used only one banana.. It was absolutely delicious.. The banana gave just the right amount of sweet taste without being 'banana over-powering'. The chocolate taste really came through. Very Moist!! We ate it as soon as it came out of the oven - didn't last more than 15 or 20 minutes. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Wow. I'm not a huge fan of banana bread, but this one is amazing! I substituted butter for the margarine and only had 5 bananas on hand and it came out so delicious that I am tempted to eat the whole loaf. This is a keeper and will probably be my go to recipe for left over bananas going forward. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

I truly enjoyed this recipe. I didn't taste like banana but was very moist and the choc chips stayed creamy which was a nice treat.  I will be making this recipe again for sure!

I tried to make it a little healthier. I did 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups white flour. I also used dark chocolate cocoa and dark chocolate chips! It was delicious! I think next time I will add 1.5 cups of each flour--it's moist enough to handle it!

I didn't want the same ol' banana bread, but I had to use the bananas up. I did come major no-no's like I didn't have sour cream so I use yogurt and I found out at the last minute I didn't have baking soda so I had to use baking powder. And it still came out great so I know when I have all the right ingredients it will be wonderful!!!

This has to be the best banana bread I have ever made! I am a chocolate lover, and regular banana bread doesn't usually do it for me. This hit the spot! I cut the recipe in half, and didn't have any sour cream so I used cinnamon applesauce instead. It came out wonderful! I will be using this recipe many times over!

This tastes more like a dessert than a quick bread.  I cut the recipe in half and made only 1 loaf, as I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was very good.  I cut large pieces and froze them individually in ziplock sandwich bags so that we can take them out for bag lunches.

Made this recipe yesterday, all bread is gone today!  Wonderful recipe, even daughter ate it, and she cannot stand bananas.  Took a loaf to work, had to come home and email recipe to 5 who tried it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! 
I didn't have two bread pans so I used a bunt cake pan and added 15 min of baking time.
I can't stay away from it!

Dangerously addictive. Especially if you are generous with the banana, sour cream and chocolate, which I highly recommend.

I thought this was pretty good.Other family members just raved about it but I just couldn't decide if I really liked the chocolate and banana together.I guess I prefer regular banana bread and as far as chocolate I like the chocolate zucchini combo a little better.I did love the texture of the bread it turned out extremely moist.I left the chocolate chips out which I'm glad I did because I think it would have been too rich.I also added a little cinnamon which I love with chocolate.I always use plain yogurt in place of sour cream in my bread recipes.This is a really good recipe if you like chocolate and banana together in bread.

The flavor of this was amazing, however it turned out more of a cake consistency than a bread.  But will definitely make again!

This recipe is fantastic! It was my first attempt at banana bread and it was a huge hit. The flavor was wonderful and the bread was so moist. I used fully black bananas that I'd frozen a few weeks before and they worked beautifully.

Tried this recipe today.  Came out great.  And all of you are right.....it makes A LOT of batter.  I ended up with 3 regular loaf pans and 4 small individual loaf pans.  Also, I did not think the chocolate overpowered the banana.  I even added a little more chocolate powder to make the batter a little darker plus a pinch of salt.  Hint:  The small sour cream container turns out to be just about a cup so next time I won't need to measure that ingredient.  I will be making this again and again (gonna try mini muffins next).

This is a wonderful bread. I am not a fan of bananas by themselves but in my world chocolate is it's own food group. I loved this bread, just enough banana to make it more interesting that a plain chocolate bread.

Delicious! I subbed fat-free vanilla yogurt for the sour cream (because I didn't have any sour cream on hand). Also, I left out the chocolate chips the second time I made it, because they were just too much for me. Even with these changes, it was phenomenal! Great way to use up some old bananas and satisfy my chocolate craving at the same time. Really struggled to not eat the whole pan with this one!

This was awesome! I was afraid the cocoa would be overpowering but made it exactly as instructions call for and would not change anything. It was incredibly moist. Definately a keeper.

5  stars for sure!!!  What a great recipe.  Very moist and just the right amount of Chocolate.  I put all of the batter in a bundt pan and next time I will either split it between two or make an extra loaf.  It was a little much for one bundt pan.  I will be making this again very soon.

This was really excellent warm right out of the oven.  It's good with or without chocolate chips.  I made half with and half without.  Also good served with a cream cheese frosting! Yummy, will make again!

I think you have to really love the chocolate banana combo to appreciate this recipe.  I guess I'm more of a purist when it comes to both.  My husband loved it though!

Mmmmm... this is good!  I made a lot of modifications, and the texture was a little off, but certainly my fault and not the recipe's.  I replaced one cup of flour with quinoa flour, only used 1 cup of sugar, and replaced the eggs with 4 T flax meal soaked in 8 T water.  I left out the sour cream which may have been the biggest contributor to my bread being on the dense and chewy side, but I may have also over mixed the batter. I will be making this again next time I have overripe bananas. Thanks!

I made this as the recipe called for except I left out the choco chips and added walnuts instead.  I really loved this banana bread.  I like the fact that even though it has cocoa in it, the flavor isn't overwhelming.  The texture is great.  This is a keeper.

Delicious!  I only had four bananas to use, but it still turned out wonderful.  The balance of chocolate and banana flavors is perfect.  The loaves are moist, light and airy.  It's just an all-around great recipe.  I did notice that some of the chocolate chips sank to the bottom, so next time I will use mini chocolate chips.  I ended up baking my loaves for 70 minutes.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is a winner!  I had a bunch of ripe bananas and decided to make this recipe.  I halved it to make one loaf because I wasn't sure if anyone would like it.  My husband took it on a hunting trip.  When he got back, I asked how it was so I would know whether or not to keep the recipe.  He said all of the guys gave it a thumbs up and it was a big hit.  I made it again this weekend and had a slice, he's right, it is so good and easy to make.

Some people mentioned the chocolate totally overtook the banana- I didn't have that problem at all. Maybe because I absolutely love chocolate? This bread is fantastic! I didn't alter it at all- perfect as-is!

really good, moist chocolaty and bananay. I used half butter half applesauce. I halved the sugar as suggested and it was the perfect sweetness (my two year old called it cake even though it had less sugar than called for) and i used half whole wheat flour.

Loved this recipe!!! I added 7 banana's instead of 6.  I did 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, and regular sour cream (not light)  It was so yummy- thanks for the great new recipe.  I will still use my traditional banana bread recipe.  This is just a nice change!

I made this for the first time and it is wonderful! I did not have sour cream so used light vanilla yogurt and added walnuts.  This will be made all the time.  I gave this to a friend that fell and is recovering and she is in love with this.

Excellent!  I followed a suggestion from another reviewer and baked in a bundt pan.  Easy to make and tastes wonderful.  Next time I will add more chocolate chips. Two of my favorite things, chocolate and banana bread.

Eat this warm and it's like Heaven. Still good when it cools down too. I wanted to do something different with my ripe bananas. In the first bite, I definitely taste banana. Then I start to feel the smooth chocolate taste each bite after that. The recipe can easily be halved to make 1 loaf. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and 4 small to medium bananas for the one loaf. I'd use 7 bananas for the full recipe. Mini chocolate chips are a must so they don't sink to the bottom. A moist sweet bread that I will definitely make again. Thanks Traci P!

This banana bread recipe is one of the best that I have tried. It is super moist and has a fantastic flavor. My husband took some to work his employees gobbled it up. One employee begged me to make a loaf just for her. I will certainly be making this again.

Good flavor and I do think I will make this again. Two things though: one it seemed to make a LOT. I was worried it might overfill the pans while baking and both loaves did collapse. These things won't prevent me from making it again though. Tasty.

So delicious!!!!  I have been looking for an "alternative" banana bread and this is it!!!  I had only 3 bananas so I halved the recipe and made 4 mini loaves.  It is so moist and chocolatey.  You can definately still taste the bananas.  I will definately make this one again and again.

These are SO good!! I did make some changes due to ingredients I had on hand. I used butter, b/c I never use margarine. I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I did a heaping 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. I did half sour cream and half FF vanilla yogurt b/c that's all I had. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp salt. I also added 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips. I baked these in a mini muffin tin for 13 mins. I used my little cookie scoop to fill muffin tins. They are SO yummy! I will be making this often!

Amazing! I added some cinnamon to the recipe. Also I drizzled each piece with cream cheese icing. Soooo good!

This was really awful. There was way too much batter (we have a quite large loaf pan) & it should have been broken up into smaller loaves. The muffin size cooked up better. The part that did cook was flavorless, and certainly NOT chocolate. We cooked it for well over an hour and it was still completely goo in the middle. I thought I would give it another go, as I usually don't write off recipes after the first time, but I'd rather find a more chocolate-y, banana-y bread or one or the other and tweak it.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was very good. Both the banana and the cocoa flavors are light and not overpowering.

I have probably made this every week for 2 months, I just love it!  I've made a few alterations: I've added up to 8 bananas...just whatever I have on hand.  I use dark chocolate chips, instead of semi-sweet, and put a little over half the bag in, so maybe more like 1.5 cups.  I also add in a cup or so of chopped pecans.  I used the Splenda sugar blend the last time I made it and it turned out WAY too sweet.  I would maybe even cut the amount of that in half.  I find that the baking time is really much longer.  Probably closer to 1 hr 20 minutes, even in a convection oven.

This is terrific--I made a half batch and it was THE best I've had.  Can't compare it with regular Banana Bread because it's not.  Super easy to make, too.

This was a very moist and delicious no-guilt chocolate loaf! I had no sour cream and used plain yogurt instead. I think I will opt out the chocolate chips next time though- they were smeared into the carpet, clothes, couch... kids and cake. This is my new recipe for those old nanars.

YUMMY, This was very good.  Now I added Dark Cocoa pwdr instead of cocoa pwdr. Plus I only had Peanut Butter chips and Chocolate Mint Chips. Since the mint didnt sound good..Used the PB Chips.  It was YUMMY.  Although you couldn't taste much Peanut Butter.

This is now a favorite.  I made a loaf for the neighbor who snow-blowed our driveway after a blizzard as a thank you, and now we can hardly stop him from beating us out to clean up after a snowfall.

This was a wonderful banana bread.  I did half the recipe and stir in approx. 1/2 sliced almonds.  This is the recipe I will use from now on to make use of those browning bananas!

As someone said, the chocolate and banana flavours blended in really well. I could taste both without one overpowering the other. I used three medium sized-smallish bananas and was afraid I wouldn't be able to taste them but it came out really well. The flavour is really really good!

OMG!! This was very good!! The first time I made as stated in the recipe. Then a week later (yeah its that good!) i made again only with a few alterations. Instead of margarine i used applesauce, I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar. Then for the 1 c. chocolate chips and 1/2 c. cinnamon chips..WOW and i used reg. sour cream because that was all i had...then i made a cream cheese glaze for the top of it. Note: i baked in a bundt pan for 65-70 minutes. Came out great...EVERYONE loved it!  In fact I'm making again for a get together tonight!  Thanks a bunch!

I followed this recipe exactly as listed except I follwed another reviewer's advice and mixed the dough by hand (mixed dry ingredients and created hole in the middle and then added the mixed wet ingredients (mixed sugar with wet)and sour cream in the center and mixed by hand). This made the bread SUPER MOIST. Next time I might leave the chocolate chips out since I thought the bread would be better without them and add a little extra cocoa powder. Worth the effort!

Outstanding!  I took pieces of this bread to work for some of my co-workers, and they all wanted the recipe!  I did not have 6 bananas, so I used 3 large bananas and added a drizzle of oil.  I thought it had plenty of banana flavor and came out nice and moist.  I can't wait to make it again!

Amazing. I didn't have any loaf pans (What can I say? College student's apartment!) so I used one large casserole dish for all of it. This bread was so good! I'm pretty sure one of my roommates single handedly ate half of it herself. I'll for sure make this again!

WOW!I've always loved banana bread and chocolate & banana taste really great together.My 8-yr old daughter loves it. I put 1 cup of brown sugar & 1 cup of white sugar because I love the taste & flavour of brown sugar & I put 1/2 teaspoon of salt like someone suggested. Simply wonderful. The bread is moist & chocolaty with all the lil bits of chocolate chips. Definitely going to make this over & over again.

Very Good.  I cut the recipie down to 1/2 for just 1 loaf.  I only had 2 banana's, so I added 3/4 cup sour cream and left out the cocoa powder.  Baked at 350 for 50 minutes, let cool for about 15 minutes.  Very moist, excellent.

Very yummy!  I cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups and it still turned out good.  I also only used about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips,  just because that was all I had, but the chocolaty taste was perfect.

This is so good!  I don't worry about how many bananas I have, I just use up what I have.  Of course, more bananas will make for stronger banana flavor.  Sometimes I add chopped pecans, sometimes not.  I do agree with others that mini chips are the way to go.  I have made this so many times.  My girls love it and request it often.  Tonight I made it for the first time in muffin pans, and it made 24 perfect muffins.  I baked them for 15 minutes at 350.  Do give this a try and enjoy!

Although I changed the recipe so that I could cut some calories I don't think I changed the outcome, which was delicious! I used applesauce for the oleo, cut the sugar by one fourth and used no fat sour cream. I also added some chopped walnuts. Thanks for the post!

I'd give this 4.5 stars because I think the chocolate chips are a bit too much, but my daughter and husband loved it as is.  If you like sweets and chocolate, you will like this!  Very moist and so yummy.  This recipe makes 2 loaves - we ate one and froze the other.  Will be making this again, possibly with fewer chocolate chips or none at all.

Fantastic!  Made the recipe as it and it was delicious.  If you prefer smaller chunks of chocolate then the mini-chips would work wonderfully.  This one is a keeper.

Best banana bread ever!  I made a few modifications: I used lowfat butter instead of margarine, whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and Splenda baking blend in place of sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It came out really well!  The consistency was much better than other banana breads I've made.

What a fantastic recipe!  The bread is very moist and has such a unique flavor.  I halved the recipe and used mayonnaise instead of sour cream.  Turned out perfectly--I'd recommend this to anyone.

Yummmm...only marginally healthier than chocolate cake, but it's so good! I added a few more chocolate chips and a littie more cocoa. Also, I halved the recipes but it still make 21 muffins. 

It's a keeper!

Very good, very chocolatey.  I added extra milk chocolate chips and a little extra cocoa.  Baking time is a little off - 70 minutes will get the center cooked through.  (I baked for 65 minutes and center was still a little wet.)  Delicious, though.

LOVE THIS! I used butter as I did't have margarine on hand, worked out just fine. Also added the pinch of salt someone else recommended. I will FOR SURE make this again. Very moist and full of flavor. Worth the calories.

I CHANGED THIS RECIPE A LITTLE AND I GOT RAVES FROM MY COWORKERS WHEN I SHARED A LOAF WITH THEM.  Prior to making this recipe the first time, I read the first page of reviews.  I too wondered if the ingredient of salt had been erroneously omitted so added 1/2 tsp. of salt to my SINGLE loaf recipe the FIRST TIME I baked this banana bread.  As I was assembling my ingredients, I realized I didn’t have any unsweetened cocoa powder but I did have a box of Hershey’s all natural unsweetened bakers chocolate bars.  I added 2 bars/oz. to a stick of butter, (I never use margarine), and melted them very slowly together over the simmer burner on my gas stove turned all the way down in a stainless steel mixing bowl.  I added the sugar to the butter cocoa mixture and once this cooled down I added the eggs.  I also used regular sour cream and added a cup of chopped walnuts and instead of 1/2 c. of chocolate chips, I added 3/4 c. Ambrosia semisweet chocolate chips that can be purchased at Costco in a 6 lb. bag, (I’m a serious chocoholic).  I felt the loaf was just a bit too chocolaty because you could barely taste the bananas.  Everyone asked me what kind of cake it was.
The SECOND time I made this SINGLE loaf recipe I added 1 tsp. of salt, 1.5 oz. of Hershey’s all natural unsweetened bakers chocolate bars, 1 c. of the Ambrosia semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 c. of chopped pecan’s.  I like the second version a little better but both versions were very good.

my family loves this bread and we've made it many times.  i suggest using the mini-chocolate chips.  we keep frozen bananas in the freezer in batches of three... then when we want some bread, i thaw them, drain them a little and dump them right into the standing mixer.  i have not used the lite sour cream, only regular.

My daughter made this bread for the county fair and got a trophy! It is a very moist, rich bread that is not too sweet and is VERY delicious! She made 5 small loaves and ate about 3 of them herself! A wonderful bread to serve for breakfast with a healthy smoothie!

My youngest son just loves this stuff...so do I! I use regular sour cream just because it's a personal preference; and I always stir in frozen Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips, they don't sink to the bottom of the pan and they don't melt. (And I just can never add enough chocolate to anything!) Fantastic recipe! Tastes like a gourmet banana cake. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I admit to being a chocoholic... I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and made it a heaping quarter cup of cocoa and it made my end product much darker than the picture and oh so chocolatey! I also went "scant" on the sugar (my bananas were soooo ripe and sugary.) I couldn't wait for bread to bake, so I made them into muffins.  They turned out magnificently!  Everyone loved them and they were gone in no time.

Some have said that there is not much banana flavor, which is true. This is not your classic banana bread. It has a rich, moist chocolate flavor.

I have made this recipe three times now. It is definitely a keeper, and I continue to tinker with it.

The first time I made it, I had to bake the 8-cup loaves for 1 hour 15 minutes, vs. the 1 hour that the recipe indicated. Even after the additional time in the oven, there was a fudgy streak in the center of the loaf. I know my refrigerator is colder than most. Maybe the sour cream and eggs were too cold, increasing the bake time. I used full fat sour cream.

The second time I made it, I halved the recipe, keeping the cocoa powder the same (1/4 cup). I divided the dough into two 4-cup loaf pans, and the bake time was still 60 minutes, despite the smaller loaves. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. This time, the loaves were perfect. I prefer smaller loaves anyway.

If you follow my changes and additions, you will probably need to reduce the bake time to 45 minutes. This is just a guess.

Awesome.  I chopped up a candy bar instead of morsels because thats what I had on hand.  This is so good.  Remember the more ripe the banana the better the bread.

Excellent bread that is more like a cake than a bread!  It's very moist and chocolatey.  I would have preferred a little more banana taste, but I really can't complain.  Really good!

EXCELLENT recipe!  I used my KitchenAid mixer to blend all the ingredients, which was so easy.  I had to bake it longer than it calls for (about 10 minutes), but because I had read previous reviews I knew this was a issue sometimes.  I gave some to my neighbors and they were back at my door a few hours later wanting more!  My husband now has a favorite banana bread forever!

This chocolate banana bread is AWESOME!
It has to be the best recipe I have tasted so far.
I like the taste of the chocolate with the banana bread.
Good Job with this recipe Tracie P.

This appears to be a very versatile recipe.  I was out of margarine so I used half butter flavored Crisco and half plain Crisco.  I also only used 4 bananas instead of 6.  I put in the fridge overnight just as I do with pumpkin bread.  This is delicious!!

I don't use the cocoa, and always substitute flour with whole wheat flour.  It's great! The kids love it.

I got nothing but rave reviews on this baked goodness. I was able to get 12 small muffins and two large muffins out of the recipe.  I followed someone's suggestion to mix the choc chips into the dry ingredients and it definitely helped to keep the chips from sinking. Very tasty.

Yummy!  I halved the recipe and made muffins and they are very tasty.  I baked at 350 for 32 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  The chocolate is a nice twist :)

THIS BREAD ROCKS! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Tracie. I also suggest adding 1 cup of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips. Or use 1/2 a cup of PB chips and only mix in one of the loaf pans (recipe makes 2 loafs). I never tried chocolate banana bread before and now I can't live without it. :-) It always comes out very moist and doesn't dry out fast. It can last for a week and still be very moist...if you can resist that long!

Wow!!! I am impressed!! I used 2 c WW flour and 1 cup white flour, only 1 cup of BROWN sugar, added cinnamon and baking powder instead of baking soda, and also used more applesauce than margarine (3/4-1/4 split).  Add in 1 cup each of mini Hersheys Kisses and SKOR toffee chips and your old recipe will be replaced.  Delicieux :)

Served this at a church brunch.  It was very well received.  My first taste of chocolate banana bread and my husband and I were not disappointed.  Made 2 loaves.  They sank a little right in the middle, not sure why.
That why the 4 star.  This recipe is a keeper.

Wow this was sooo good!  I have made it twice since I found the recipe 2 weeks ago.  I used 2 smaller loaf pans & had enough batter left over to make 3 muffins too.  Yummy!  This is one that I will make to share withj others when I need to send something to cheer someone up.  The whole family loved it!

I substituted nonfat buttermilk for the margarine and fat free sour cream for the regular and it turned out great.  VERY moist- more like a cake than a bread, even for banana bread.  I will definitely make this again.

I agree with MATTSMUM27.  The cooking time was off.  I even read the instructions wrong and baked it for 1 hour & 10 minutes.  I still found certain parts of the bread very moist (wet)!  I also found that the chocolate over powers the banana so will cut down on the chocolate chips next time.  Overall, it was quite good!  Thanks :)

This is one of the most delicious banana bread recipes I have ever tasted!  It is moist and light. Of course, the chocolate never hurt.  The cocoa doesn't make a huge impact but the choclate chips add a nice boost of chocolate.
I prepared a half recipe, using only 2 bananas and substituting half butter for the margarine. Also adding a bit of whole wheat flour for part (maybe a third) of the called for flour worked out great.

This recipe was absolutely amazing- I used the ingredients to the dot and it turned out soo irresistable! The sour cream adds the perfect touch to make it not-too-sweet and still moist and great.
This recipe was incredibly easy to make, and I just stuck it in the oven, practiced piano, and came back after exactly an hour .. and it was perfect.
No complaints whatsoever!

I made this last night and was very happy with it. I made quite a few changes, for diet purposes. I used 5 bananas, 1 cup of applesauce, and only a 1/2 cup of butter, a mix of sugar and splenda, an extra 1/4 cup cocoa, and a 12oz bag of jumbo chocolate chips. It made 12 filled, extra-large muffins, baked for approx 40 minutes.

We enjoyed this dense, clunchy recipie, though it is much more a cake than a bread.  I used half the amount of sugar (2 cups seemed like way too much).

Wonderful bread Tracie! I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I placed cottage cheese into the food processor with a bit of lemon juice and gave it a whirl. Worked out fine. I also added english toffee bits to the batter. Everyone really loved this and thanks!

I hate to be the odd-ball here, but this recipe just didn't work out well for me at all. First off, the bake time is off, this definitely needs to bake longer than an hour. Now, I followed this recipe to the "T", except used butter instead of margarine, and regular sour cream instead of lite. It didn't come out like "bread" at all. It's way too heavy. It's not light and moist...It's heavy and moist, but VERY moist...almost under-baked looking. Was pretty dissapointed with how this turned out after all the great reviews.

This bread tasted strangely bland to me, and the bottom came out rubbery.  It might be better with a little bit of salt, but there's a much better chocolate chip banana bread recipe on this site where you add a tablespoon of mayonnaise to the batter - I think I'll just stick with that one.

This is an AMAZING recipe: I've given 4 or 5 loaves as gifts, and my roommate and I went through one loaf weekly (I would either half the recipe or freeze the other loaf; both are still great).  I once tried to substitute mayonnaise for sour cream when I didn't have any SC on hand -- bad idea.  Thanks, Tracie!

Very good!  Used 5 bananas and didn't add the suggested brown sugar.  It was fabulous!!  I wish I would have followed the advice to add one egg at a time and blend well because the batter looked lumpy, but it turned out great!  I'll definitely make this again!

This tastes good, but it seems more like chocolate cake than a banana bread. The chocolate in this quick bread overpowers the taste of bananas, though. I did use full size chocolate chips, not the minis.  Maybe the minis would be better for this recipe? You must let this quick bread bake for a full 70 minutes or it will not be done on the inside.  Test it with a cake tester before you remove it from the oven.  If it's not done, retest it in 5 minutes intervals until the cake tester comes out clean of banana batter (melted chocolate is okay on the tester).   I used regular sour cream and the results were fine.

My 8 yo daughter LOVED these!  I took other reviewers suggestions and made some small changes, but nothing major.  The one thing I do recommend is making them as muffins (but don't use paper liners as they really stick!).  I made mini muffins, regular muffins and a small loaf.  All turned out great, except the mini loaf.  It would NOT bake in the middle.  I ended up scooping out the gooey middle, because I didn't want to overbake the rest of the loaf.  All in all a great muffin!  I'm going to make these next week for a school bake sale.

This banana bread is very good. It came out nice and moist. It could have used more chocolate chips but that is probably because I am a BIG chocolate lover. I will be making this again but next time with more chocoalte chips.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe although not as good as I expected from the other reviews.  I was concerned that it would be too chocolaty, but in fact I will probably increase the chips to 1 1/2 or 2 cups next time.  Mine had a very prominent banana flavor, and I wonder if those who didn't maybe didn't use ripe enough bananas.  It was not, however, as good a flavor as I get in my usual banana bread recipe.  As for the chocolate flavor, if the loaves weren't brown I wouldn't have even know it was there.  I plan on incorporating more of my usual banana bread recipe into this one as well as adding more chocolate chips and maybe even more cocoa, and with that I hope to get a really delicious bread.

This bread is delicious.  I made a large loaf and three small loaves with one batch.
The directions did not call for flouring the pans, however, I would recommend doing so.

I plan on making several of these and giving them as gifts.

I was skeptical about making this over a traditional banana bread but I’m so glad I did! I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 and a half cups whole wheat and about 3/4 of the sugar it called for and it still turned out great! Will definitely make again!

I have tried other chocolate banana bread recipes,  but none compare to this one.   My new favorite.   Very moist and you could still taste the banana with the chocolate.  Family and co- worker approved.

It was tasty, but even though I baked it for the recommended time, and although toothpicks came out clean, as they cooled, the centers fell in considerably. Turns out they were still  gooey-runny on the inside. I had to rebake and then microwave on top of that just to be edible.

Great take on banana bread. The chocolate flavor was just right and did not over power the banana flavor. It baked up very moist. I, like some others, did not have low fat sour cream so I used the full fat version I had on hand but everything else was just as written. The loaves turned out wonderfully.

I had to bake it for 90 minutes in the 2 loaf pans and they were still a bit underdone. There was too much moisture, it made for too much batter and it was hard to judge doneness because you can't do a good toothpick test with all the chips in it. Seems that 5 bananas would have been plenty to fill the pans and cook properly. Still great tasting loaves tho, just too much batter.

Fabulous! I love banana bread and baby was demanding chocolate...voila! Incredibly moist, tender loaf. Only change was to use half melted chocolate and half coaco powder blended with melted butter. (Read the coaco pack for substitution amounts). I made this 6 days ago and, wrapped in plastic it is still moist and flavourful. This is a keeper and will be perfect for camping trips.

This is my favorite.  It is definitely dominant on the chocolate side, I can still taste the banana.  Easy to make and is a favorite among co workers and family.  Turns out beautifully by following the directions.

Really like this as a slight switch from our usual banana chocolate chip bread recipe. A nice bit of chocolate flavor and bakes up nicely. I only made half the recipe and got one loaf + 5 small muffins from this. Muffins I baked 20-25 minutes and bread about 60 min. I also added an extra banana and a bit of cinnamon.

I’m a chocoholic so this recipe hit home with me. I of course added a tad more cocoa, used a couple more bananas than called for and had milk chocolate chips on hand. The sour cream made this so moist and delicious. I’m in chocolate banana heaven!

I’ve made this recipe as written, and it turns out FANTASTIC. Rich, moist and full of flavor, this is definitely a dessert instead of breakfast or snack like I sometimes like to eat banana bread.     Most recently I tried the recipe with the following modifications: half the white sugar, eliminated the cocoa powder and added a little extra flour, used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and butter instead of margarine. So good! I made one loaf and kept the chocolate chips in the recipe, and I used the other half of the batter to make muffins with crushed walnuts and spices. You can’t go wrong with this recipe!!!

I was hoping that we would love this, judging by so many great reviews.  We thought that it was good, but not amazing.  I was expecting a richer, stronger chocolate flavor.  It was very moist and I liked the chocolate chips in it, but the overall chocolate flavor was a little weak and I don't think I'll bother with this recipe again.

Easy to make! I had exactly six overripe bananas and this fit the bill perfectly! My family is enjoying the first loaf and I froze the second. I substituted 1/2 of the semi sweet chocolate chips for sugar free chocolate chips. Still awesome!

This was good. It needs about 3/4 tsp. of salt to counter all of that sweet. It needs more chocolate flavor as well, for my taste. So I also upped the cocoa by 1/4 cup the second time I made it. These changes made the recipe much better to me. Four stars after the changes. Thank you for posting the recipe!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I made a loaf of it and left it in the teachers lounge this morning. I've already had three emails asking for the recipe!  I used butter and regular sour cream instead of margarine and lite sour cream just because that's what I had in the house.  The bread was really moist and the flavor of both the banana and the chocolate really came through.  The best part was that I was using one of those fancy-dancy Williams Sonoma bundt pans, so I had extra batter and made a bunch of mini-muffins with the extra.  My family loved, loved, loved them.  I'm using this recipe again for sure!

Made it just like the recipe said, only I used regular sour cream and mini chips.  We liked it so much I made again the next day!

Moist.  The combination of rich chocolate and banana is irresistible.  Can easily be a cake or cupcakes.

I made this as a bundt as another reviewer did and my family absolutely loved it!  It almost fills the bundt tin, but it cooked perfectly in 90 minutes. This is 100% a keeper. I will say that even with all the cocoa and chocolate chips, it’s still very banana-y. Moist and perfect, make this!

I was looking for something a little different to do with my banana bread. This was delicious! The only difference I made was I only had three large bananas, also I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder cuz I love true chocolate flavor. I'll be making this again with more bananas as the recipe suggests.

This is an awesome recipe! Easy to make! As cupcakes, it works awesome 20 minutes at 350. When I cooked in the 5 x 9 pans the center of my bread was not cooked while the outside was too cooked. I think if you cooked it at a lower temperature for a longer time you would have more even doneness throughout. Also, I have non stick pans and I lightly coated with olive oil spray and it stuck like glue. I am thinking next time I would butter and lightly flour the bottom. Still a very good recipe and the family loves it every time I make it.

Delicious! I only had 3 large bananas so I halved the recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine, 5% Fage yogurt instead of sour cream, full portions of vanilla and cocoa, and over a cup of milk chocolate chips. I also swirled in some peanut butter which made it very pretty and added some yummy richness. The combination was divine. I will definitely make it again!

Delicious! My mom has made this a few times and we all love it, so I decided to try my hand at it. I left out half the sugar (which my mom does, partially because we use overripe bananas so they are really sweet already). I also used only 3/4 of the butter, and substituted whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour. Used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It was still goopy inside after 60 minutes so I baked it for 80. Still very tasty despite my variations!

Really delicious.  I'll definitely remember next time that you do need a big bowl to finish it.  I also made it in the smaller break pans.  I found that you have to wait for it to completely cool before cutting otherwise it does crumble a bit.  Simply delicious..!!

Only change made was using milk chocolate chips as We we’re out of semi sweet. Very good bread, better even I am sure with good chocolate chips.  I prefer walnuts in my sweet breads, definitely will make again and experiment with chocolate chips & nut combinations.

This is excellent. I had 3/4 cup mashed bananas, so used the ingredient amounts for 6 and baked the batter in 2 mini loaf pans for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick came out clean.

I've made 5 loaves so far but I changed a few ingredients to my own. Instead I used 1 cup brown sugar and one cup white. I also used two bars of Hershey almond candy bars, chopped very fine. Used two packs of chocolate pudding cups also instead of sour cream. I have also done a few loaves using the sour cream and not pudding. All came out delicious!!!! I'm addicted!

My kids like bananas, but had never cared for regular banana bread. Thought I'd give chocolate banana bread a try since I had some over ripe bananas I didn't want going to waste. They loved it! Made into muffins for easy serving. Replaced 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour to make healthier. My husband would have preferred leaving out the chocolate chips, but the kids loved them as is and couldn't even tell they were banana right away. This is now my go-to banana bread recipe.

I made it a little healthier--I replaced the margarine with half butter, half apple sauce. I replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat. I used regular sour cream because that's what I had. I baked it in my bundt pan and the kids and hubby loved it!

This bread was ok, I expected a bit more of chocolate flavor in it, but like other reviewers said, banana was the leader here. ...maybe I'll add more chocolate chips next time. 
I also decided to make it in a bundt tin, and it came nicely.

Really delicious. I love banana bread. My family do not. But this, they'll eat any time! I halved the recipe and 2 tbs of cocoa powder wasn't enough for me, so this time I used 1/4 cup and it is perfect. Also used full fat sour cream and butter instead of margarine. And probably more than 3 bananas... I had 4 but there were bad bits on 2 of them, so less than 4 but more than 3. It has a rich chocolate flavor and just enough banana to remind you where it came from.

I made cupcakes instead of loaves (it made approx 30 cupcakes), baked in my convection oven at 325F for 25-30 minutes.  WOW.  Beautiful texture: crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  My modifications: 1 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar; added 1 extra banana; replaced half the white flour with whole wheat; was a bit short on the sour cream so topped it off with mayo; and added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  I can't stop eating these!

I used what I had...3 lg. bananas instead of 6 whatevers...small?   And only had 1/2 cup of sour cream so I added 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese to top it off
.  Oh and 1 c. white flour and 1 cup of brown.      Nothing changed the flavor or texture...added walnuts too but 10 min. for prep????  Not likely.

My freezer's top shelf is "weaponized" with frozen bananas that shoot out at me and land on my toes.  (I'm in the habit of throwing all my aging brown ones that no child will eat in there.)  I got tired of making my mother-in-law's very good recipe I've been using for over 30 years.  So I tried this.  WOW!  Here is my only "criticism": it's so sweet, you may want to make it into muffins or mini-loaves.  Here is my only change: after my first batch left a little crumb and a few chocolate chips in the pan, I tried flouring one in addition to greasing the pan.  It popped out easier and cleaner than its sibling but the sides didn't look as dark.  Not sure it's necessary.  Thanks for a delicious new option in banana bread!

I followed the recipe and it made two delicious loaves. I found that I needed to bake it for 75 minutes for the middle to be completely finished, so trust your knife. :)

Followed the directions, turned out a little dry.  Didn't taste the banana/vanilla flavor, chocolate chips/cocoa overpower it.  Maybe add some walnuts??  50 min?

I live  in the Caribbean and get fresh local bananas in huge bunches at a time. So I have become quite the connoisseur of banana bread recipes. This is the first chocolate banana bread I've made and it is outstanding. Crazy moist and a great balance between banana and chocolate. I made the recipe exactly, except I did add a teaspoon of salt. I also chop up chocolate bars instead of using chocolate chips as it feels a little more homemade. If you like super chocolatey, you can add more chips and cocoa powder. But this recipe is perfect just the way it stands.

This is a tasty way to use overly ripe bananas. I only had 2 but the recipe worked. I only had chocolate chunks on hand so I cross-chopped them...once across horizontal and once vertical. 
My brother loved it and so did the neighbors . I will be making this every time I have the bananas

This is wonderful & very moist bread.  I had to cook the bread 15 minutes longer because the toothpick was still damp when I stuck in bread for the time allowed.  I figured it was due to using frozen bananas.  My hubby said it was EXCELLANT! =)

I made this chocolate banana bread, which should be called a cake.  This recipe makes a huge delicious cake.  The only change I made was to bake it in an angel food pan.  The recipe is definitely  a keeper, it is delicious!  Very moist, with all the flavors coming thru, banana and chocolate galore, delish!!!  Would have given ten stars if I could.   Louise Nj

Absolutely  delicious, but the first time I made it, it came out undone in the middle, and took about another half hour in the oven.  My second loaf is in the oven right now, and I'm expecting great results!! :)

Very moist and delishious bread. I made it lower in fat and decreased the recipe to make one loaf. Substituted applesauce for margarine, used 1/2 C brown sugar + 1/4 C Splenda (after reading the reviews I took others suggestions to reduce sugar, it was plenty sweet), used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, added 1-1/4 tsp Cinnamon. Used dark chocolate cocoa. Very good... will definitely make again.

Delish! Made this instead of my usual bread just for something different.  So moist and tasty. I scaled down the recipe slightly because I only had 5 bananas and didn't want to take the chance of the bread being dry. Came out perfect. Not overly sweet either so don't worry about that.

Very good bread.  The only thing I would change if I make this in the future is to add more cocoa to make it more chocolatey tasting.  Overall, it's good but not great.

Amazing! I halfed the recipe, and made it in one 10x6 pan for 45 minutes. 
DIRECTIONS/INGREDIENTS:
1. I mixed dry ingredients first, with one sub and a couple additions: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1.5 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 2 tablespoons cacao powder, + dash of sea salt, + cinnamon. 
2. I made a well in the center, and added in wet ingredients AFTER I mixed them in a separate bowl: 2 eggs, only TWO bananas, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup regular (non-lite) sour cream, + ~2 tablespoons of milk for texture to compensate for the lack of a third banana. 
3. Added about 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. This spread the chocolatey-ness a bit better throughout the bread. I also used about 1/4 cup to sprinkle on top of the batter.
RESULTS: Delicious! I still taste plenty of banana, and the chocolate is not overwhelming. I'll make it just like this next time :)

This was a good basic recipe.  If you start out w/ room temp butter and eggs, and get a really fluffy creaming going on, and don't over mix after that,  the rest falls into place for a nice texture and rise to the final product.  I tweaked the recipe for my personal taste (yogurt instead of sour cream, extra milk-choc. chips along w/ the semi-sweet, about 1/4c extra cocoa powder because I wanted a richer choc. and less banana flavor, nuts, 1TBSP espresso powder in the banana to darken the flavor, a dash of cinnamon).  None of my tweaks should make a difference to the success of the final product as written, it's a good, solid recipe in my opinion.  If you are looking for a slight variation, try my little changes!

This was a great spin on traditional banana bread. As previous reviewer suggested, I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and baked in a bundt pan for 90 minutes. Turned out perfect and I can't stop eating it.

This recipe worked really well!! Just the right texture - not too crumbly, not too dense. I followed the recipe, with 1 change: I halved the sugar. At the end of the mixing, I added choc chunks from whatever chocs I had in my fridge. My hubby LOVED it. 1 thing I'm not sure why... 1 pan rose beautifully, the other did not rise as equally along the edges. They were baked side by side.

I love this recipe!  Co-workers & kids love it too.  This is a large recipe, I cut it in half & bake in a 9x13 pan for 35 mins.  I cut back the sugar (3/4 cup when making a half recipe), it's very sweet if you use the full amount.  I dust the top with cinnamon & raw sugar before baking.   Quick and easy, the sour cream keeps it so moist.

I chose this recipe because I was looking for something that counted as a dessert for the week. Unfortunately the chocolate chips and cocoa powder in this one quite overpowered the banana. That being said, if chocolate with just a little banana is what you're looking for, this was really very tasty and I recommend it. Next time I crave banana bread I will use this recipe and skip the cocoa powder and cut a little sugar for a better balance of flavors.

Prepared recipe as written except scaled down to half batch, made it as mini muffins at a reduced time.  Used muffin liners and they tended to stick quite a bit right out of the oven, but peeled off better the next day.  Very good.  If anyone is missing the banana taste or says it's not chocolate-ty enough.  Add a small amount of banana extract, or grate some chocolate bar into the dough/batter mix.

Moist and very good, I will definitely make this again. Entire family ate it up. Chose this because it was chocolate and also because no nuts (both my kids have nut allergies) and because it uses a larger quantity of bananas and I had 6 brown ones sitting on the counter.  I made the following changes: 1) had no margarine so used butter  2) replaced all the sugar with 1/2 c brown sugar Splenda baking blend and I could have even reduced that to 1/3 c - will do that next time.  3) used fat free sour cream   4) baked the entire batch in a classic bundt pan.  

Because of my ingredient changes, it flattened slightly while cooling (but kept its nice bundt shape overall). No one cared after it was sliced! Great recipe. Makes lots of cake.

Loved this bread. Made it for a dinner party and everyone really enjoyed it. Read the other reviews and made a few adjustments before making it:
I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. It was amazing. Highly recommend.

I've made this recipe twice, the first time I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, and it was still great. The second time I made it with the chocolate chips and it was WONDERDUL! This is my new go to banana bread recipe. My sister liked it so much she suggested buying 2 batches of bananas from now on. One batch for eating and the second batch to simply sit and brown for making this bread. It really is that good!

This recipe is what the doctor ordered, especially when you are tired of the same ol boring banana bread. Very chocolatey but doesn't over power the banana flavor. They delicately dance together on your taste buds. We used the tip that some one mentioned to use a bunt cake pan and to cook for 90 min. Worked without a flaw. Just wait to cool before popping it out of the pan. Yummy

It was very good.  Stayed moist even after 4 days of  sitting on countertop I omitted the sour cream because all I had was sour cream with chives and I don't think that would have been very good lol.  So instead, I added 1 c  of heavy cream.  Worked out fine.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but ran out of white sugar, so used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I like the moistness and boost of flavor that the sour cream adds. My kids LOVE that it's chocolate-banana! Overall, this one was a hit in our family.

Fantastic recipe. I use real butter, tiny chocolate chips, and also grease and coat pans with sugar to give the outside a sweet crunchy touch.

I will be making this again! It is very moist and delicious. My bananas were extra ripe(black) so I added about 15-20 minutes more to my baking time. Also you can still taste the banana flavor even though it is so chocolatey. The chocolate chips melted.

This was REALLY GOOD!  I did not change a thing!  Be sure and put this in the LOWER PART of the oven.  I put it on my 5th rack.  I cooked it at 350 for exactly one hour and it turned out MOIST and DELICIOUS!  :-)

Wow, this was amazingly good, and I even used "healthy" ingredients...I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I left out the chocolate chips because I didn't have any, and I doubled the amount of cocoa.  This will be going into my "best recipes" file!  It's a moist nicely-textured bread and the favors are balanced well ... Neither the bananas nor the chocolate are overpowering.

Very moist. Layer two slim slices with raspberry jam between and dollop of whipped cream on top, takes to another level.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy to make, light and yummy. I cut the recipe in half since I wasn't sure how good it'd be. I used butter instead of margarine because it was all I had and only two large over ripe bananas, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  I used my ice cream scoop and filled it about 3/4 full of batter and it made 19 cupcakes. I baked them at 350 degrees for 21 mins(my oven runs quite hot) and they were perfect. Will definitely make these again!

Was great! Going to be my go-to banana bread recipe. 

Didn't have sour cream so I used mayonnaise. Worked out really well. Not sure what the sour cream is supposed to do for the recipe anyway, but the mayo gave it that bit of extra moisture and the whole thing was insanely moist and dense in a great way. 

Second time made muffins -- albeit without the cocoa powder, since I just wanted straight up banana muffins. Used brown sugar just to test. To see if it would make any kind of difference, and as far as I could tell, it did not.  Worked out really well still.

All in all it is a great recipe! Very versatile.

AMAZING! My first time making banana bread and it turned out perfect. Coworkers devoured it and then asked for the recipe.  this is super decadent though so I'm good to attempt a "healthy" version and see how it goes.  Try this recipe as is though and you won't be disappointed!

My guests and I loved this banana bread.  Like another reviewer I used a bundt pan.  I used only about 1 3/4 cups of sugar, and I would not have liked it any sweeter.  In fact I served it as desert.   I also used regular sour cream, and reduced the oil by about 2 TBS.  I baked it for 90 minutes.  The bread was a wonderful combination of chocolate, banana, and vanilla flavors. It was rich and moist, delicious warm or cold.   I will be making this again!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Moist, delicious, a must try recipe!  My kids were head over heels for this bread, and so was I, for that matter.  Added a full bag of chocolate chips instead of measuring, and only had 5 large bananas, but it tastes awesome!

love this recipe!  I even think I'd add sour cream to my next non-chocolate banana bread recipe.  I didn't want two loaves so I split the recipe.  However, after making it the first time I decided it could be a little more chocolate-y so I didn't cut the cocoa.  I've since made it for friends who also loved it.  Even one girl who doesn't typically like banana.

So delicious. I made this for a breakfast potluck and it was a hit! I didn't have sour cream so substituted 1 cup Vanilla Greek Yogurt and didn't add vanilla since it was already in the yogurt. I don't have loaf pans but baked it in a bundt pans and made sure I greased it well. I turned out beautiful and tasty.

My boys helped me make this and we had so much fun! We halved the sugar and used brown instead of white, also used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. Since my 4 year old added the cocoa we ended up with more than called for. The chocolate banana flavor is great.

Everyone wants this recipe!!  Wow is it good.  The only change we make is to use Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. Feels healthier.  LOL.  Also, butter instead of margarine. Sometimes we add some cinnamon.  Typically after the bread cools we cut it down the center and then into slices.  Very moist.

This is by far one of mine and all the kids favorite bread over the years.  Not the healthiest, but home made is always better than store bought.  Very moist and not too much banana flavor to over-power the chocolate.  I always add extra pinch more cocoa powder and half cup of more choc chips.

This recipe was a huge hit! Chocolaty and moist, this had the perfect ingredient proportions. I'm going to try it with a peanut butter and milk mixture instead of the sour cream (just for fun, the recipe was great as is). I'll let you know how that goes :)
***addendum: I made the recipe again substituting a mixture of peanut butter and the defrosting banana liquid (to give it a lighter consistency) for the sour cream. It worked out absolutely amazing! I also want to mention that when I made the original recipe, as well as the peanut butter version, I used butter instead of margarine and I used half brown sugar and half granulated. I found the cook time had to be 1 hour 10 minutes.

Wonderful moist, rich bread.   I had sugar beads (King Arthur Flour carries them) and placed them on top before baking.  They made a nice white "snow" effect on top of the dark bread and added a bit of crunchy while consuming- yum.

I made 1/2 a recipe since I only have one loaf pan and I have to say this is the best banana bread I've had. It's dense, moist and oh so wonderful. I didn't have sour cream and subbed greek yogurt. My husband was upset that I was taking half of it to work and he didn't get to eat the whole thing. I reminded him of his waistline. It is a great recipe.

I made this in a bundt pan and had enough mix left over to also bake a small loaf.  It turned out very good.  I will definitely add walnuts next time.

I cut the sugar in half because I find bananas and chocolate chips add enough sweetness. I also baked the loaves in parchment paper...smells sooo good!

I made this and gave it to someone as a thank you gift.  I didn't get to eat any, but tasted a fingerful of the crumbs that were left in the bottom of the pan...and they were very good.  The texture was good and made a beautiful loaf.  So, I'm giving it a score of 5 stars.  Now, I'll make a loaf to keep.

Made this today for the first time, ate it like cake, with vanilla ice cream- yum! I understand what some reviewers are saying, about not wanting chocolate when they crave banana bread, but this is just so good! The cocoa does over-power the banana taste- but we are chocolate lovers, so that was okay! I'm sure it will be a go-to recipe for us. I used 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar, and it was still plenty sweet enough, will cut the white to 1/2 cup next time.

I have made this several times and it has always been a hit! Yes it tastes like chocolate, duh! It's supposed to. As a small change recipe I usually add peanut butter chips as well as chocolate chips. It is to die for!

I have made these several times now. My husband likes banana bread and I like these, so I halve the recipe and omit the cocoa and chocolate chips for him (sometimes adding pecans) and make mine by the recipe, then I freeze them. Take a couple out of the freezer, let them thaw, then heat in microwave for 10 seconds...oh my gosh...they taste like they just came out of the oven! We love these!

Chocoholics, this one's for you! It is chocolately! YUM!! However, next time, I'll either add more banana or use less cocoa powder because the chocolate flavor overwhelmed the banana to the point where I couldn't taste the banana! I'll also omit the mini chocolate chips, unless they start making them in milk chocolate. (The semisweet ones are a bit too bitter for my taste.) I made just a few minor changes. I cut the recipe in half as I wanted only one loaf. I used one-quarter cup butter and one-quarter cup unsweetened applesauce, and I used about a half cup of regular sour cream, which made the bread wonderfully moist. Bake for about 90 minutes. I will definitely make this again! :^) (P.S. Eat this with peanut butter spread on top of the slice!)

I made a change used butter instead but follow the recipe to a T. It was so moist and excellent in taste. Instead of chocolate chips in batter i sprinkle them on top. Plan on making more for the Holidays and freezing them for gifts. Love it. I for got to mention i used 6 Bananas sorry.

I didn't change anything in this recipe at all  and it turned out perfect! My family couldn't stop eating it! It was so moist and yummy! I was able to make 3 loaves from it though instead of two, that was the only difference.  This is going to be my new go to banana bread recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

I've made this several times, and it has consistently been a great recipe! Today I changed things up and baked it in my cupcake pan. I halved the recipe and got 24 muffins/cupcakes out of it (I used liners btw). Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.

Absolutely delicious. I used this recipe for a bunch of bananas that we had to use up at work. We didn't need all of those loaves right away, so I froze several. Even after being frozen they were still really moist. Definitely will be making this again.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried! Everybody keeps asking when I will make the "chocolate cake" again. (I like to bake mine in a Bundt pan.) My husband has even asked for it as his birthday cake. He wants whipped topping and fresh strawberries on top. Sounds yummy. Can't wait to try it. 
Hint: Try substituting an equal amount of vanilla Greek yogurt if you don't have sour cream.

I really like banana cake with chocolate frosting.  I thought I'd like this about as much, but didn't.  'Wasn't crazy about the cocoa in the bread; like the idea of the chips though.  They were chocolate-candy-ish-tasting.  Again, thought I'd like, but didn't.  Sooo, pretty good bread, but didn't wow.

I think this is a good recipe. Mine turned out to be a bit chewy on the outside (and perfectly moist on the inside), but I read online that it could be my greasing method (margarine) or over-mixing. I did have to bake the two loaves for 80 minutes total. I don't think it is too sweet, though, it is certainly dessert-worthy. I would like to try adding salt and cinnamon next time. I'm not convinced the chocolate is the best, but I was more making it for others to enjoy, so hopefully they will like it.

This recipe tastes wonderful. I made it in one bundt & cooked for 120 minutes.  Overcooked on edges, but moist on the inside. I will warn you this recipe yields two bundts or three loaves. If you want a smaller portion, cut the recipe in half. Cooking bundt for 90 minutes is too much. I suggest 60 & check every 5 minutes until done.

Love this recipe!  all leftover bananas go in freezer in anticipation of making this!  Only change I've ever made is Hershey's special dark cocoa, as I had 4 tubs of it.  This bread gets rave reviews and anyone who has tasted it wants the recipe!!!  Delicious!!!

Everyone in my house loved this.  I lightened up the recipe by using nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt in place of the butter and sour cream, stevia for half the sugar, and two egg whites for each of the whole eggs.  Mini chocolate chips and a bit extra cocoa powder.  Yum!

This recipe is very good and makes a huge batch! I used three loaf pans and still had some batter left over to put in another pan. My bananas were very ripe and sweet so I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup. I also melted the chocolate chips in the microwave before adding them to the batter. It turned out great! Will definitely be making this again.

I thought this tasted alright. It did seem more like a soft chocolate cake than banana bread tasting in taste or texture.  However, I also made some changes to make it a based on what I had in the house. I made 1/2 recipe, used butter instead of margarine. Part oil would have been fine too. I had to sub non fat Greek plain yogurt for the sour cream and did 1/3 of the flour, or 1/2 cup, as white whole wheat. With a full cup of sugar, I opted to just sprinkle approximately 3 tablespoons of mini chocolate chips on top. To up the chocolate flavor I doubled the unsweet cocoa powder. It seemed like way too much batter for 1 loaf. So, I chose to make muffins. I got 18 muffins.  They took 23 minutes to bake in a greased muffin tin.

Delicious! I changed the serving size from 24 to 6 and followed the recipe from there. I only needed one loaf pan and I still put it in for an hour. However, I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and for 6 servings it called for 1/4 cup but I think I will ad 1/2-1 cup next time-I like a lot of chocolate chips!

This was really great! I had a lot of bananas getting overly mushy and I didn't want to throw them out. Very easy to make, even with my 4- and 6-year-old sons "helping." I used butter and regular sour cream, and made it in a Bundt pan. I didn't find it too chocolatey or too banana-y, but just right. THANK YOU!

This recipe had mixed reviews in our house.  You could taste banana and some of the chocolaty taste, but, it didn't have enough chocolate for me.   I would increase the cocoa powder.  My husband, however, thought it was very flavorful.  The bread was very moist and the flavors did meld together better the next day.

Wonderful banana bread recipe!  This has been my go-to recipe for years, any time I have over-ripe bananas to use.  It's true that the blacker and softer the bananas, the better the flavor of the bread.  I take this to work regularly, and everyone always raves, asks for the recipe, and the whole loaf will be gone in minutes.  I usually make just a half recipe, as I don't normally have 6 black bananas on hand at once.

I used 5 overripe bananas and dark chocolate instead of semisweet..maybe it hurt my outcome, but I wasn't too thrilled with it.  I may try again in the future with semisweet.

Made once with the chocolate & chocolate chips and then again without any chocolate & chocolate chips.  Both went over very well and probably one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever made.  I can't find anything wrong with this recipe.

This recipe is delicious! I had exactly six very ripe bananas that I needed to use and I wanted something closer to dessert--this hit the spot! I subbed plain nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream (I was low on sour cream) but other than that followed the recipe exactly. My hubby and stepson really loved it too! This will definitely be made again.

I leave out the cocoa and the chips. I also make it gluten free by using Bisquick Gluten Free pancake mix instead of flour. Super sweet and moist. 1st loaf gone 1st day and 2nd gone by day 3 every time. I make this about every other month.

I've made this bread at least five times.  It is a no fail recipe.  I scaled it down for 12 servings.  I always slice into individual servings and freeze.  After thawing, it taste just like it was freshly baked.  It is wonderful and a great way to use overripe bananas.

This was delicious! Made it in several cupcake pans. Easy for kids to grab muffins as snacks and they live them. It's a hit at our house!

Yummy! To avoid the problem of being undercooked, as many others commented,  I made this in a 9"x13" pan.  It turned out light and cakey, not dense like I was expecting.  We really enjoyed it!

Tasted great and was nice and moist! I didn't add the chocolate chips but it still had a subtle chocolate flavour from the cocoa powder. I put chopped pecans on top and it looked like the kind of loaf you'd buy in a bakery.

We gave this recipe 5 stars for the idea because we changed it quite a bit. Added one 5.6 oz cup of lemon whipped greek yogurt and changed the margarin to 3/4 stick of butter. For the sugar, changed it to 3/4 cup white sugar and 2/3 cup agave nectar. We then used one 5.6 oz cup of lime whipped greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Poured the batter into a cupcake pan and cut the cooking time in half (30 min). Finally, used half dark chocolate chips. The changes were made to attempt to make a healthier version and it really worked. Loving them!

Do you want a deliciously moist, banana bread  with rich chocolate flavour make this! Only change was butter because that is what I had and I added extra coco powder. The loaves weren't done at 60 min so I ended up baking then for 80 min total but that could just be my oven.

I wish I had never started making this. Now anytime someone has very ripe bananas they give them to me and ask me to make them bread! 

In all seriousness this bread is very tasty, although not a healthy breakfast alternative which is what I always use it for!

Every time I make this it always gets rave reviews!  Always use good cocoa powder - I never get cheap because it makes a huge difference!  I also use a heaping 1/4 of cocoa powder.  So delicious!

I made this recipe as muffins instead of loaves.  I did not like this at all the day it was made.  The banana and chocolate flavors were too distinct and didn't work together.  I almost tossed them, but my boys liked them okay.  I stored them in a freezer bag and by the next day, the flavors had melded together into a delicious muffin!  I've since had trouble keeping my hands off them!  So, I would completely recommend this recipe, just make it a day in advance of when you want to eat/serve it.

Amazing! This is a keeper. I didn't add chocolate chips because I didn't have any. I also used homemade yogurt in place of the sour cream, added in some baking powder and used a little less sugar. The bread was perfect!

my kids devoured these. I made muffins instead of loaves.
I only had 4 bananas and no cocoa powder so I added about 1/4 c. nutella, and 2 tsp. of my cinnamon plus spice blend from pampered chef.I mixed the flour,soda and cinnamon in one bowl, then I creamed the butter and sugar and mixed in the bananas, eggs, vanilla, sour cream and nutella. Then I poured it into the flour mixture and mixed just untill it was all incorporated together. They were awesome!!
(I also used regular sour cream)

Excellent recipe that makes great moist muffins too! The only change I made is I used regular sour cream, rest of ingredients same.  Still bake at 350, but 25-30 mins (for convection ovens closer to 25 mins).  Place (Reynolds) baking cups in cupcake/muffin tins.  Fill muffin cups 3/4 full.  Yields 30(+) muffins.  Easy fill tip:  Put batter in gallon ziploc and cut off very tip of one bottom end.  Squeeze batter through tip into cups.  *If you have an icing bag tip, put tip in corner before batter for more stability.

Fabulous! I've made it as written, but this last time, I only had two bananas, so I added one whole shredded zucchini to make up for it. Turned out great, with added nutrients!

I'm not a big fan of typical banana breads, so I was happy to try this recipe to use up some ripe bananas.  I'm glad I did - it was excellent!  The only changes I made were I used 1 stick butter and 1/2 c. Coconut oil in place of the margarine and I used mini chocolate chips.  I made 2 loaves and 12 muffins from the batter.  Next time I'll use part whole wheat flour.  Great recipe!

This bread is so good! Moist and my banana flavor really came through surprisingly (I didn't think it would). I used overly riped bananas and added walnuts and a little salt.. Perfection! I will definitely make this again!

Just made this. Simply delicious. I only had 4 bananas so I needed to decrease amts of most ingredients. i wanted a balance of chocolate and banana tastes without overkill on sugary sweetness, so i kept cocoa amt and reduced choc chips. i used: 2.5c flour, 1c sugar, 3 eggs, 1.5tsp b soda,  1/3c mini choc chips, and kept same amt on remaining ingredients.  I made muffins and a loaf....muffins came out dry but loaf was insane! I probably over baked the muffins. Will def make this again.

A perfect morning treat, I'll definitely make this again.  I baked exactly by the recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.

This was an excellent recipe.  Made two loaves and they went quick.  For my tastes, I went with a tbsp and a half more cocoa powder and some more chocolate chips, and it came out amazing.

Mmmm! This is an excellent recipe. I just ran out of white sugar and used all brown, and they turned out wonderfully. I also put the batter in muffin tins and baked them for 20 minutes and they make an outstanding muffin!

Man , this was easy ,easy to make , and the family went crazy over it. Chocolate and banana go great together !! I lightly added some walnuts to it , for a little extra texture. Very moist , and more cake like.

This may be a 5 star recipe but I didn't make it exactly as posted - I cut the recipe in half and used  cinnamon chips instead of chocolate (because I didn't have any). I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. It is fantastic bread! There's just a hint of chocolate and cinnamon - so good!

I was dying for a chocolate banana bread recipe and decided to try this one. I got to the "add cocoa" part and realized i didn't have any in the house! It still tastes great and I can't wait to make it with the cocoa added next time :)

A freind was making this and sent me the link to the recipe.  In looking through the reviews I noticed some people said the batter was pretty runny and it took a while to cook.  I did have to cook it an extra 15 minutes and was worried because it was very moist still- but it was great!  I took a loaf to work and everyone loved it.

My husband always ask me to make this rather than regular banana bread. Love this recipe. I sometimes use frozen bananas and I think they come out better.

YUMMY!!!!!!!  This is the most requested treat that the kids ask for and as it has bananas and chocolate in i'm happy to see them eating fruit in some format.....I tend not to mix in the chocolate chips however as I find they have sunk to the bottom during cooking...what I do is layer the batter in 3 layers with chocolate chips in between

I would love to try this,  but we live in Guatemala and sour cream is runny, expensive, and nasty (tastes like rotten milk)! Any tips on how to adjust the recipe if leaving out the sour cream?  Thank you!!

OMG!  Absolutely the best.  I will not be making any other banana bread again.  I made it into minimuffins and baked for 15 minutes.  I also added toasted chopped pecans.  These are the most moist and delicious banana muffins EVER!

I used the recipe as is.  No changes.  I only had 4 bananas but I must say that you do not lose any of the banana flavor!  These are excellent and easy!  I made one loaf of bread and then made almost 2 dozen mini-muffins with what I had left.  I used the 350 degree setting for 15-20 minutes on a convection setting for the muffins!  Defiintely a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site. I remember finding it several years ago, and I always kept the other ingredients on hand so that I could use up the inevitable overripe bananas that showed up. Even when I've mixed the ingredients poorly, and I end up with banana lumps concentrated in the bottom of the loaf, it has been a tasty treat. I make it almost exactly as the recipe states, though I often use butter and regular sour cream in place of margarine and lite.

I'm a dummy and this is me-proof!  I had to switch the margarine for equal amount veg oil.  I didn't add the chocolate chips because (a) didn't have any, and (b) didn't want it too sweet, anyway.  The result was outstanding and I plan to make this every single time our bananas go too long.  Which is often.

Very easy.  I halved the recipe so I wouldn't have a bunch of it if it wasn't good.  However, it was very moist and flavorful.  A good balance of chocolate and banana.  The loaf was gone the day I made it and my husband has already put in a request for more.

I really liked this banana bread.  It is a nice change from the one I was usually making.  I halved the recipe.  I am going to try making it into muffins the next time.  Anything with chocolate is great!!

I thought this turned out wonderful, love both the flavors together.  Only thing I changed was adding chopped walnuts.  Next time I might try half wheat flour.  The sour cream was something I'd never used before so I think it made it very moist. Loved it!

This is a wonderful variation of banana bread~ I loved it, my husband did not. But who cares it had me at chocolate! I used real butter, ommited the chocolate chips (didnt have any), used 8 bananas (why not use them all) and topped with fresh whipped cream! O M G! I kept this one to myself, I told my employees about it but I could not part with it. It kept great covered on the counter (4 days). Very moist, chocolate was not overpowering (maybe because I added 8 bananas). Def a keeper! Thanks Tracie.

This is a 5 Star Recipe!  I used real butter, not margarine, just my preference and the mini-chocolate chips that another reviewer suggested.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and had enough left over for a loaf pan too! I drizzled a chocolate ganache frosting over the bread, and sprinkled with left-over mini choco-chips.  There is a pic of it on my profile, for some reason it hasn't been posted here yet.

This bread is very yummy.  Used butter instead of margarine, 2 1/2 cups flour instead of 3, (2 cups wheat flour and 1/2 all pur-purpose) and up the cocoa to 1/2 cup. I used yoghurt instead of sour cream and I mixed it with the mashed bananas I guess to avoid it getting darker. Also added 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup of raisins instead of choc chips. Very yummy.

Great recipe, very easy to make I needed to pans.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and cut down the cocoa powder to 2 Tbsp. Did not have walnuts but would be good. This is a keeper.

This is a good recipe. I don't quite understand all the hype about them being to chocolatey?? Mine tastes like banana bread with chocolate chips...nothing more or less. For those of you who want to double the recipe be sure you have a very very big bowl and the mixing power to mix it. I doubled it and my hubby was laughing at me as I had to use a huge pasta pot to mix it all up in and I also needed his help and I am not a whimp at all lol. I made two loaves and one round cake pan and a dozen muffins. I took the others advice and also increased the baking time and I think one hour would have been sufficent enough. Over-all god recipe but I will continue my mission to find my staple banana bread. Thanx

I loved this recipe.  It was moist and just a hint of chocolate.  I actually used real hot chocolate powder and it was great.  It did need 10 minutes longer to cook and I have a new oven.

This was certainly the hit of a New Year's Eve casino party dessert table. So glad I made it. No changes except OF COURSE to use butter instead of margarine, like I always do in my baking. I will always make this when I have some overripe bananas on hand instead of tossing them. Even when I don't!! Just delicious!

Came out really good!  Mixed everything by hand so I think my next investment will be for a hand mixer!

Next time i'll make 1 full sized loaf to cut up and freeze in individual pieces and then the rest in mini loafs or maybe muffins.

I really do need to try substitutions to make it healthier since I LOVE Banana bread, especially this one!

Excellent banana bread recipe! Very moist, and not an overpowering banana OR chocolate flavor. I followed it almost exactly - my only changes were to use unsalted butter instead of margarine, so I added a tsp. of salt, and I didn't have quite a cup of lite sour cream left, so filled up the rest of the cup with nonfat vanilla yogurt. I made 12 regular sized muffins, one mini loaf and one big loaf! This is a BIG recipe, so either halve it if you don't want a lot of bread/muffins, or make sure to use a really big bowl! Next time I may add a tsp. of cinnamon, I think that would be great with this combination of flavors. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread was delicious! My only modifications were: 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 cup Splenda instead of white sugar, and a 50/50 whole wheat and white flour combination...just to make them a little healthier! I used mini-sized chocolate chips. The banana and chocolate flavors were terrific together and it was very moist. Will definitely make this again for my family and friends!

Excellent!  Mine came out very chocolately-looking, much more brown than the photo.  It was chocolately, with rich banana flavor, and delicious!  You could still tell when you had found a piece of banana while eating it, even with the chocolate.  Yummmmm!

This banana bread is by far the most moist I've ever had. It was soooo good. I added some white chocolate chips since I only had a few dark ones and it just added a hint more sweetness then the semi sweet was offering.

Great flavor and texture, but it did stick badly to the bread pan, and took forever to cook. I think next time I will use wax or parchment paper to line the bottom, or make muffins and cut the time to cook dramatically.
But as for the recipe the only thing I did different was used regular sour cream and used 1/2c to 3/4c of both brown and white sugar.

LOVED this! I've never really even heard of chocolate banana bread...omg this was so good. My birthday cake is always chocolate with a layer of bananas in the middle...so this was right up my alley! I added some pecan pieces to one of the loaves for the nut lover hubby of mine...he really liked it too. THANK YOU! I am sure I will be making again and again!

I wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe.  It seemed to be lacking something.  Perhaps it needed more banana flavor, I'm not sure.  I made it as a loaf and also as muffins.  The muffins were a little dense for muffins, but the taste was better.

This is amazing!  My friend had made for me last year, so I finally made it for myself.  I used yogurt instead of sourcream.

Great recipe.  I am always looking for a way to get my kids to eat bananas.  I used dark chocolate chips which made it even sweeter.

I made this recipe last night with my 2 and 3 1/2 yr old daughters. It was very easy to make with them, and it is very good! My kids are pretty picky about sweets and breads, and they both thought that it was delicious. The only thing that I didn't like was that some of the bottom of the bread is not quite done. However, the top of it was already done. It still tastes good though. I think that we will make this one again!

It was really good! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it needed more chocolate chips than what the recipes called for, IMO. Other than that it was perfect!

This is an excellent banana bread! Very moist, very good taste. I made this recipe one morning which makes two loaves. I sliced both loaves up and took them to work. The plate was empty before noon. Everyone at work still asks for more!

This turned out really good, but just as a personal preference, I thought it was a little too sweet.  I loved the banana flavor but the chocolate flavor just seemed off for some reason.  Very moist though, and my sweet loving DH really enjoyed it.  Thanks.

I personally think this would be much better if the cocoa was omitted. I cut it back to 3 tbp but it was still too much, in my opinion. I used real butter instead of margarine.  It was moist & tasty, I just think the cocoa added an "off" flavor. I made these into 5 half loaves (they were still about to overflow) & baked them in a 325 degree oven for 45 minutes. Thanks for the recipe Tracie P.!

This recipe is good and it definitely stays moist and yummy for days after baking, but i didn't oooh and ahhh when it hit my mouth - which I am not sure if any banana bread would do.. but because it is chocolate it almost deceived me into thinking I was getting chocolate cake. Not sure if that makes any sense. Anyways, I used chocolate chunks instead of chips and a little extra and those were the best bites, so I highly recommend that.

Decided to try something besides plain old banana bread and this sounded delicious. And it turned out delicious. I felt that something was missing, though, and now reading other reviews realize I should have added a pinch of salt. Also, this recipe can be easily halved for one loaf. I started making a full, 2 loaf batch and realized my bowl was not big enough. If I make it again, I will probably only make one loaf at a time as it gets pretty unmanageable at the current quantity.

A new twist on banana bread. I shared at the office. Everyone loved it. I made only 1 loaf, but kept the 1/4 cup cocoa and it was great. A definite keeper!

This is the BEST Banana Bread I have ever had.  I have made it for my daughter's school bake sale and for my husbands office.  Everybody loves it and I have shared the recipe with many.  Great to give to poeple over the Holidays. If you are watching your waste line then this recipe is not for you.  It is hard to eat just one piece.

Mine came out too mushy.  I made the mistake of making it in a round bunt pan.  I cooked it FOREVER and it never seemed to cook fully.  I ended up cutting it into slices and putting it back in the oven.  It was still mushy.  I don't think that I added too many bananas.  The over all flavor was good.  My kids loved it.  Just don't make it in a bunt pan!

A classic chocolate banana bread.  Has that spreadable banana-bread texture, but it's as rich and chocolatey as a cake - I bet that caused the cake-like complaints (you could spread something on it, but you won't want to).  Used exact ingredients (though any sour cream would be fine) but I combined the dry seperately, creamed margarine & sugar then added eggs, then bananas & vanilla, then the dry, sour cream and chocolate chips all at once (that's the way most muffin & bread recipes I've seen work).  Can bake as 24 muffins for about 30 minutes if you're in a rush or want a more portable treat.  Also, I bet adding 1/4 cup cocoa powder or subbing it for 1/4 cup flour would make your favorite b. bread recipe into a good chocolate b. bread if you add a bit extra sugar (1/4 c?).

We thought this was okay, but we have decided to stick to a traditional banana bread. We just felt it could do without the chocolate. Sorry!

This is sooo good! I am abandoning my old choc chip banana bread recipe, I could never get it to cook through all the way. This one was completely done and still moist and delicious. I had it in the oven for 60 min, then for 5 min more after checking.

Super easy recipe to make.  Very moist and tasty.  The chocolate kind of overshadows the banana flavor, but it was delicious and a wonderful change from the traditional banana breads.  Baked exactly 60 min.  Dark in color, but mmmmm.... so good!

This recipe is delicous!!  I have made a lot of times and I had raved about it to my older sister and now she makes it all the time!  The only thing I changed was the amount of cocoa powder...I had made only half a batch of banana bread and I used 1/4 cup of cocoa powder instead of 2 Tablespoons.  My other older sister LOVED it!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It's AWESOME!!

This bread turned out yummy.  I had to bake it a bit longer than the 60 minutes stated in the recipe.  Don't be deceieved by the dark color that the bread turns in the oven, it does have cocoa powder in the batter.  My husband couldn't wait to slice it when it came out of the oven, he had two thick pieces slathered with butter.  I'm sure I'll be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family looked at me a bit strangely when I said what I was making until they tried it. A big hit. I used plain yoghurt instead of sour cream and scaled down to make just one loaf and this makes a big loaf. Great combination of flavours. Thanks

This recipe is delicious.  I made a few modifications.  I used butter instead of margarine, regular sour cream instead of lite, and I also used large bananas.  I didn't cut the amount of bananas I used because some reviewers said that the banana taste was masked, but I did double the amount of cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey.  Perfect substitute for dessert.

Quite moist and flavorful.  I cut down the fat to 1/2 cup and used butter, cut down the sugar to a heaping cup and used an extra very ripe banana.  I also used milk chocolate chips ans few extra tablespoons of Droste cocoa powder (Dutch process makes for a smoother richer flavor compared to Hersheys).  My husband thought it was too chocolatey (men!) and gooey.  It is nice change from the standard banana bread.

This is a wonderful recipe!  What is great is that it yields 2 loaves.  One loaf to keep and one loaf to give away.  I mixed the ingredients in a food processor and it yielded a well-mixed batter.

I liked it, but I think the banana taste needed to be stronger.  I don't know if the bananas I used weren't ripe enough.  I am going to try riper bananas next time or use more bananas.  But it was a good, moist sweet desert bread!

The bread was more of a dessert than bread.  Deliciously moist and flavorful.  Great with a cup of coffee!  I cut the recipe into a third and increased the eggs to 2 eggs and it was still great.

This bread is incredible.  If you are thinking about cutting back the recipe, reconsider, since you will be kicking yourself later when you want more.  I added a little more chocolate chips than what the recipe called for (I'm a chocoholic) and it was perfect.  Even skeptical relatives loved it.  Very moist.

It was tasty and a good recipe, but I didn't really care for the cocoa color in the bread. If I make it again it will be without the cocoa powder.

This recipe is wonderful! I made one loaf of bread and one pan of muffins. I added more chocolate chips than what was called for, and in the 1/2 of the batter that I made into muffins i added a package of raspberries. Amazing!

This was fabulous! I have had an aversion to banana bread since my first pregnancy, but this one is great. I added more chocolate chips, but kept the rest of the recipe the same.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried.  It is SO moist even when you substitute whole wheat flour.  I would not change a thing about the ingredients, although I did bake for an additional 10 minutes. Superb!!!

Great recipe!  Nice and moist, not too sweet.  I did add 1-1/4c. chocolate chips instead of 1 c.  Liked it so much I gave some away as gifts to friends.

Instead of mashing the bananas, I just put pieces of the banana in the mixer and blended slowly.  This way I have bigger pieces of banana in the bread.  Next time I make, I will add another cup of chips (per our taste)  Thanks Tracie

I've made this several times and it is very well liked by everyone who has tried it.  My boyfriend's daughter liked it so much that she requested it for her birthday.  I've substituted white chocolate chips (because I was out of reg.) and actually preferred that..it went well with the banana flavor.

This is a very moist and delicious banana bread.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but I halved the recipe and made 8 mini loaves.  I loved the addition of cocoa to make it a chocolate bread, but I would have prefered more of a 'banana' flavour.  I brought it to work and everyone that tried it, LOVES it!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe, but will modify it for a lower fat version the next time I make it.  Thanks!

Fantastic!  The flavor and moist texture of this bread is wonderful.  The recipe is perfect as is.  Kids love this chocolately change from traditional banana bread.  UPDATE:  I make this all the time now to use up old bananas.  Recently I cut it in half and used it to make mini muffins with mini chocolate chips.  Great!

This was a nice change from the standard banana bread.  It was not too chocolately or sweet, which we enjoyed.  One change I made was using mini chocolate chips.  

Excellent...  It definitley worth trying.

I don't care for regular banana bread, but this is sooooo good! I halved the recipe to make one loaf, but still used the 1/4 cup of cocoa and 1 cup of chocolate chips and I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream. I did have to bake it for an additional ten minutes, but it turned out perfectly! I will definitely make this again.

This was good, but in my opinion it didn't taste much different than regular banana bread with chocolate chips added.  The cocoa flavor didn't come thru in the bread.  And there are a lot less fattening banana bread recipes than this.  I'll just stick to adding choc. chips for now.

This bread is so yummy - I can hardly stop myself at one slice at a time!  I did end up baking it for 85 - 90 minutes in order to get it cooked in the middle, but maybe that's because I was using a glass pan.

We'll be making this again and again!

The bread came out very moist and the mixture of bananas and chocolate...Mmm Mm! I used Ghiradelli chocolate for it and it was superb. I cut the recipe in half but my baking time took a lot longer, about 60 minutes to get the middle of the bread cooked. Thanks for a great recipe!

If you like banana loaf & if you like chocolate you'll definately like this delicious loaf!!
No changes needed =)
This is the 2nd time making this and this time I decided to add coconut to both loaves and walnuts to one of them.
I also used 1/2 cup dark cocoa powder and no chocolate chips(had none!!).
Just as good and just as moist...

love chocolate, but this was way too chocolatly. It made me sick to my stomach. I only had three bananas so maybe that was the problem that it wasn't balanced. I will stick to my regular banana bread by itself. Thanks anyway.

I halved the recipe to get just one loaf, but frankly, I think the whole recipe could be baked in one loaf pan with a longer cooking time.  Very tasty and moist!

The end result was quite tasty, but the cooking time was WAY off.  I had to cook it an extra 15+ mins just so it wasn't raw in the middle, and then the edges got quite hard and I had to trim them off.  Will make again tho.

This is my new Banana Bread recipe. My family LOVED it. Its amazing what a little chocolate can do. I think the sour cream did wonders too, its moist like a cake. Great for breakfast with coffee. I followed recipe to the t except I halfed it. Wasn't sure if I wanted 2 loaves of something I never tried, but next time, I will make the whole recipe and freeze a loaf.

I dont like strong banana flavor so I took off 3 of the bananas, added 1 cup of oats and 3/4 cup buttermilk and upped the chocolate chips by 1/2 cup and the cocoa to 3/4 cup. Got great response and texture was awesome

This was a really great recipe.  I didn't have the cocoa powder, so I am sure it would be even better with that. Next time I will include nuts.

The only time of the year I make quick breads is for the holiday season for gifts. I made this recipe last year for the first time and everyone RAVED about it.  I even had requests for it this year.  Normally I make several types of bread including the traditional banana nut bread.  This year I passed on the traditional banana nut and went straight for the Chocolate Banana Bread.  I have passed this recipe onto several others to have in turn passed it on as well.  It's a hit with everyone.

AWESOME!!!!  I substituted Splenda for baking and made my own sugar free chocolate chips by chopping up some Russel Stover's sugar free candy bars.  You can also lessen the amount of the Splenda to one cup and it is STILL fantastic!!  I have also made it with Equal for baking as well.

I tried this recipe and it turned out so delicious and moist.  It took exactly 60 minutes to bake to perfection.  I will definitely keep this recipe and use it often.  Next time I will probably increase the amount of chocolate chips though.
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I loved this recipe!!  It was incredibly moist and a perfect texture.  I used one packet of Nestle instant cocoa mix as I didn't have the unsweetened cocoa and it was fabulous.  I baked the bread in 3 smaller tins rather than 2 9x5" pans, and it was done in 55 minutes.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I thought this bread had great flavor. My 11 year old son absolutely loved it. More like a dessert than a breakfast bread. It seemed a little greasy/heavy. I think I will try and cut back on the amount of fat and substitute applesauce like other posts have stated.

Very good and moist.  One question, do you measure flour then sift or sift then measure?  I made muffing, baked in about 1/2 the time as cake pan.  Didn't rise up as much as I'd like.  Maybe needed to use more flour?  Will be making another batch soon!  2 yr old loved it!

wow, so yummy!  I accidently shorted the recipe on flour by 1/2 cup, but if you like it almos brownie like, that would be the way to go.  My kids loved it!! I made a bundt cake, and also made some mini muffing, which were just great size for the kids. Thanks!

This was yummy.  I decided to make it because my bananas were gonna go bad if I didn't do something with it soon!  Thus, I made chocolate banana bread!  I added only 1/4 c of maragarine and 1/4 c of applesauce, which turned out great.  Then I also added walnuts but not as much chocolate chips.  This was awesome, will make again!

This is an awesome treat! I made it with mini chocolate chips and since I had no butter on hand I used shortening with a few tablespoons of water. The recipe made 1 regular loaf, 9 mini loaves, and 24 mini muffins. It was very moist and fluffy. The family loved it. Next time I will experiment with lowering the fat in the recipe (egg whites, half margarine/half applesauce, etc.). I highly recommend mini chocolate chips because they don't over-power it like the regular sized chips do.

Usually I make banana bread so I don't have to throw old bananas away, but from now on, I will let them get old on purpose!  This was great!  The only problem was all my chocolate chips sank to the bottom.

This tasted great but it was a little rubbery at the bottom---I read once what makes that happen to quickbreads, but I don't remember what the reason was.  My husband, kids and I all agree I should try it again.

This banana bread brought was a nice change from the regular banana bread I am used to making.  It was very moist and had good banana flavor. I did not have 6 bananas so I halved the recipe and used 4 bananas.  I also I did not have chocolate chips so I put a bit more cocoa powder to give it a nice chocolate flavor.  I substituted 1/2 of the butter for apple sauce, something I do often to cut down on fat.  Next time, I will add a pinch of salt to bring out all the flavors.

Well, i loved this recipe.. but to account for the gooeyness people had mentioned .. i cut down on the sour cream a tad ( only used half a cup) i also added cinnamon, which i also really enjoy. i changed the recipe a bit for my tastes and it turns out great every time.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the very best way to eat bananas! Everyone here absolutely loved this recipe.Only problem was it disappeared too quickly. Great with a cup of hot coffee or a glass of cold milk.

This was awesome.  My hubby and kids can't get enough of this.  Actually, I make this as muffins.  It makes 24 generous sized muffines, and I bake them for about 25 minutes at 375F.  Delish!

This chocolate banana bread is good!  It is really moist, thanks to the sour cream and really chocolatey.  I did have to bake it 10 extra minutes and even then it was not completely baked through.  I also added the aluminum foil to the top when it started to get dark- thanks for the great idea!  Overall, it is good, the kids love it, just beware, it is very chocolatey!

The bread was very moist, but I didn't particularly care for the combination of chocolate and banana.  And, I'm a chocoholic, but there was also a little to much chocolate.  It was almost as if I was eating a chocolate bread.  I may make this again, though I probably would play with the ingredients...possibly add more bananas and less chocolate.

This recipe has a great mix of flavors, but the baking directions didn't work for me at all. After 60 minutes at 350, both of my loaves were burned on the outside and still too gooey on the inside. I ended up having to bake the loaves for a total of 75 minutes and then cut off the tops, bottoms and sides before serving. No fun. If I use this recipe again, I will use muffin tins as others have suggested.

This recipe is deliciously dangerous!  I recommend making muffins so you can just grab one or two, because I couldn't stop slicing off pieces from the loaf!  My roommate and I devoured all of it for breakfast, snack, and dessert within 2 days.  YUM YUM YUM!

Disappeared quickly. One friend who said he hates anything banana said this was the 2nd thing he'd ever enjoyed that contains banana. I think the chocolate overpowers the banana flavor a bit, however. I will add less chocolate chips next time.

T just didn't care for this bread.  It wasn't chocolatey enough and not enough banana flavor either.  I even doubled the amount of cocoa.

We used yogurt instead of sour cream and it was absolutely wonderful!!!  Will make this again and again, maybe some Christmas gifts as well.
