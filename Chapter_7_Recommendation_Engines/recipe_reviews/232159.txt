I had great expectations for this recipe, but it didn't work for me.  After reviewing 5 other similar recipes, I was drawn to this one due to the use of lemon juice.  While it tasted great as I licked the beaters for the cream cheese mixture, the lemon juice overpowered the pie so much that I couldn't even taste the bananas.  I followed the recipe, but assembled it differently.  I didn't fold the whipped cream with the cream cheese, instead I spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of the pie (without the whipped cream), added the sliced bananas, then the blueberry pie filling, and topped it off with 8 oz. of Cool Whip.  I'd eaten a pie like this when I visited family in Louisiana at age 14.  It was so delicious, I took careful note of how it was made (I was a cook even then), but haven't made it until now at age 58.  I will make this pie again, but will substitute sour cream for the lemon juice.  I do use lemon juice in a blueberry crumble cookie bar I make, and that's why I thought it would work nicely here, but, for me, it didn't.  Live and learn.

Just put it in the refrigerator. Used the leftover blueberry sauce from breakfast.  I gave it 5 stars because the sauce is good from another AR recipe and the cream cheese filling is finger licking good.

Great recipe!  I needed to use up some cream cheese, blueberries, etc., and this was the perfect pie to make.
