This recipe also works in the oven...  Just put the packet on a baking sheet and leave in the same time specified at 400-450.  It's so tender and full of flavor!

This was delicious!  I baked it in the oven for about 35-40 minutes on 425.   I added a few shakes of spicy Mrs Dash, and used a frozen bag of "stir fry mix" that had three kinds of peppers plus onions.  This will definitely be on our regular menu rotation- thanks for sharing!

Excellent summer recipe, very easy to make changes for wide variety of meals, e.g. salsa for tomatoes & marinade & serve on tortillos; bbq sauce for tex-mex; pork or chicken for Chinese, etc.

Easy and delicious. Nothing left.  Next time will serve over rice because it makes its own sauce.

Wow, what a versatile recipe.  Just use your imagination.  I doubled the steak, added some sliced potatoes, used regular and onion steak sauces and cooked it in the oven as a previous reviewer mentioned.  An entire meal in one packet that was really delicious!  My husband loved it.  Thanks Dan - we'll be making this again!

This recipe was really great and easy!  I added mushroom and BBQ sauce to the packets and omitted the tomatoes they came out really flavorful and tender.  Great recipe!  Will definately prepare again.

This is a staple in our house.  I can have it in the oven 15 minutes after I get home from work.  It takes 30-40 minutes to cook, which is plenty of time to help with homework and take care of a few chores.  Clean up is a breeze with the foil wrappers and we never have left overs.  The meat is tender and the steak sauce butter combination works great.

Super easy & very versatile! I usually only cook these for 20-30 minutes on a medium-high heat gas grill, and they are med. well to well done. I serve this with "Classic Fried Rice" from this website. Delicious!  The whole family loves this meal!

Begs for mushrooms and more spices, but good and easy. I used some stew meat I got on discount and it worked well.

For something SO simple this has amazing flavour!  I love that you can easily change up the veggies.  I added in some broccoli, and baby carrots.  I chose to cook this in the oven and before doing so I seared the sirloin in a mixture of grapeseed oil seasoned w/ granulated garlic, and black pepper.  I served this w/ jasmine rice b/c it made me think of being a stir fry.

Great idea!  Better than Hobo Dinners made with hamburger.  Individual packets can be made with personal favorite sauce/seasonings and veggies.

Absolutely phenomenal! Best steak recipe ever! The only thing I recommend is to definitely get heavy duty aluminum foil... Thin foil just won't cut it with all those veggies and meat.

This was okay.  The vegetables came out soggy and overcooked.  If I made this again, I think I would separate the meat from the veggies so that wouldn't happen.  It could have used some more spices too.

Absolutely delicious.  I did add some BBQ sauce along with the Steak sauce and I put some sliced mushrooms in too.  My husband loved it and thought I had slaved for hours.  I will make this for company next time.

I omitted the tomatoes and used a soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil sauce. I cooked it on my gas grill on med. high and it overcooked the veggies. I ended up with mushy veggies. It's too hard to control the temp on a bbq so next time I will try the oven.

I'm sure this was delicious as listed, but these are the changes I made based on my feelings about the quantities when assembling the packet. 

I love steak, so I upped the amount to 1 lb. I used a red and green pepper only, and I cut them into small chunks. Used 1/2 an onion since mine was huge. Did not add zucchini, and only 1/2 the cherry tomatoes. For steak sauce, I used Heinz 57 sauce, and I sprinkled it all with salt and pepper. Then I baked the packet in the oven at 425 as suggested for about 45-50 minutes.

This wasn't that great to me. The A-1 sauce taste was to strong. Maybe I should have used another kind a steak sauce. But my first pass at packet cooking and really enjoyed the Vege's done that way!
