Great recipe. Lovely combination. If you can get tarragon, make the Bearnaise sauce yourself; it's so much better than a package.

If you must use packaged sauce mix, Wagners is by far the best. Also, try using jumbo lump crab, it makes the world of difference. I added some deep fried spaghetti noodles for a fun garnish. This recipe is a classic, and a keeper.

This was VERY rich, but made a delightful Valentine's supper for my husband & son.  They were blown away by how "fancy" it was.  I served it with wild rice, and a fresh pear and apple salad.

I used the blender hollandaise sauce from this web site (with a bouillon cube added) and this came out great! Thank you for the easy recipe.

I LOVED IT! I have never, in my life, made such an amazing steak! I did it as a special dinner for my Husbands' Birthday and made sure to get a great cut from my local meat processing market and WOW! I separated the potatoes and the asparagus from the steak, but covered the asparagus with sauce, too. Thank you so much Ms. Jessica for such a great recipe that even a novice can make amazingly  ;-)

Excellent recipe! As this isn't the healthiest of meals, I paired it smashed cauliflower to save on calories lol. It was a hit at home!

Used these exact ingredients although I changed the order of assembly considerably, since we like our steaks rare, it wouldn’t be good to have them sitting so long.  I made the Bernaise sauce first, then stir fried the asparagus in garlic butter and when all was ready, we BBQ the steaks.  Our company raves about the steaks as well. Sublime!  Thank you for a great recipe.

I was a little skeptical about using a packaged béarnaise sauce recipe, so I used the microwave recipe on All Recipes. I also cooked the steak on the grill but did not add extra smoke. It all turned out very good.
