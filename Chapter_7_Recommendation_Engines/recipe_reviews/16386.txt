This is a good recipe, I used vidalia onions which made it pretty sweet--that is even after leaving out the sugar. I did CARMELIZE my onions, though, as I feel this is what a true FRENCH onion soup should be.  Carmelizing actually causes a chemical change to many vegetables in that it changes a complex carbohydrate to a simple carbohydrat--therefore, sweetness!  Carmelizing also makes things taste richer.  Therefore I spent over 30 minutes frying my onions instead of the recipe's 10 minutes.  There is no hard definite time in carmelizing as it depends on your cookware--I use a 9" cast-iron dutch oven because again the cast-iron provides depth to your food.  I would also recommend using butter if you possibly can because margarine and oleo are oil whipped with water, so it will change your outcome and your amounts should probably be adjusted if using those.  Butter has a personality of its own and when it is cooked and part of the carmelizing process it adds a whole different dimension of flavor and richness that provides a heady sumptuousness about it that oil just can't match. If using very sweet onions like I did, I would suggest not adding the sugar and using a wine that was dry and not sweet also a more bland or aged cheese or a cheese like swiss to counter the sweetness of the onions.  Enjoy it like I did and Happy eating!!

I've made this a couple of times and it's great. I love the thyme and parsley. A few changes I've made ... I use 48 oz beef broth, I don't water it down at all. I sprinkle the sugar on onion slices right away and I cook the onions for 45 until dark and caramelized. I use Port wine, not white. No restaurant version can compare to this recipe.

So fantastic and delicous! I slow cooked the onions for nearly an hour, it really builds the flavor.  I substituted one red onion for a yellow, because reds give this soup an excellent complex flavor.  Slipped a few tablespoons of sherry in when adding the beef broth and didn't dilute the broth with water.  This has to be the best onion soup I have tried, and I have had many over the years.

When I saw this was submitted by a Canadian I had to check it out.  It was the best Onion Soup recipe that I have had.  I scaled it for 2 (made it as a starter for New Year's Dinner)and it turned out great! Highly recommend. I will make this more often as it was soo easy and delicious! From ONTARIO

Great French Onion Soup recipe.  I only used 3 large onions instead of 4.  Also, I didn't use any wine (didn't have any) put 2 tbsp. of Worchestire instead.  Turned out wonderful.  I will be making this again. Thanks!

I did caramelize the onions first as I have always done (makes for a better colour and flavour) Otherwise as per recipe, very good.  You must use strong flavoured onions to achieve the best taste.

This soup turned out so delicious, my husband made the most satisfied sounds as he ate it!  I made it for 4 servings and it was enough for 2 large crocks and one leftover for another time.  Used mozzarella instead and added the wine as I sauted the onions so it cooked with all the other flavors.  It was better than any restaurant.

This recipe was as good as any I have had in a restaurant.  We love onions so I added more than called for. I also did not add any water and added additional beef stock and used red wine instead of white (thats all I had in the house).  My girls asked if I would make it once a week from now on. This one is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

This was a good, fast onion soup. However, to make really delicious french onion soup, the onions need to be caramelized to provide a complex, deep flavor & color. The bread should be lightly toasted in the oven -- 350 degrees for 5-7 minutes per side.  Also, for a special treat, use Gruyere cheese. Grate some -- 2T or so -- into the broth. Slice the rest & top the toasted bread with it. Grated Parmesan can also be added before broiling.

This was excellent! My husband buys french onion soup at every restaurant and said this was better than a lot of them, we both really enjoyed it. I omitted the wine, and scaled it for 2 people. I also put less onion than called for. Thanks for a great recipe, I will definatly be making it again!

My daughter and I decided to present "French Night" to the family as a special summer dinner and chose your recipe as the soup course.  Wow!  My two sons and husband couldn't stop saying how good it was!  The only change we made was to leave out the sugar, and that was by mistake!  The soup was so good (even without the sugar); absolutely better than any we've had in a restaurant.  We cut up the bread into pieces (like croutons) and smothered them with the mozzarella cheese.  Soooooo... yummy! And so easy..... Thank you!

Great recipe. I serve this in soup mugs with swiss cheese floated on top.  I then cover the mug with thawed puff pastry; put the mugs on a cookie sheet and bake until the pastry is golden brown. Wonderful taste and presentation.

this is a good base--but I found it to be bland, as is. Maybe I didn't use the right onion--but I had to add some sugar, some kosher salt and also some worchesire sauce (several dashes) to give this dish some added depth and richness. I served in a bread bowl with melted mozz cheese. It was delicious after I tinkered with it.

Sorry, I really was looking forward to this because of the good reviews and the ease of preparation.  However, there was very little depth to the flavor.

This recipe was great... the closest one I have found to restaurant style.  I will definitely make this again :) My husband likes meat in his soup so I browned some beef chunks and added them in... makes for a perfect dinner.

This was REALLY good soup. I made a few changes to the recipe though. We used organic chicken broth instead of beef broth. It made it a little lighter. We used swiss cheese instead too. With the bread, I grilled it in olive oil and thyme before I put it in the soup. I will definatly make this again, though I will probably cut the amount of pepper in half and add some additional spices.

Tasted great.  I caramelized the onions (about 35 minutes), and used red wine instead of white, and really enjoyed the flavor.  I just used more beef broth instead of adding any water.  Turned out fantastic, and my husband loved it, too.

Really good, especially with a couple of minor changes:  I used about a teaspoon of fresh minced thyme instead of dried, and sauteed it along with the onions so that the essential oils and flavor would be brought out.  I omitted the sugar because the onions were already plenty sweet for me.  I omitted the parsley because I find that dried parsley just doesn't impart that much flavor to anything; and I didn't like the look of all those specks floating around in the soup.  I reduced the white wine slightly and added 2 Tbsp of sherry.  The sherry took this soup from really good to RESTAURANT quality.  Definitely try it with a splash of sherry!  I also used Provolone cheese instead of mozzarella.  Thanks for the recipe!  With these changes, it will be a regular in our house!

I've been searching for a great French Onion soup recipe, and this is the one!  Here are the few modifications I made: I cooked the onions for 30 minutes in a cast iron dutch oven to carmelize them really well.  Also, I like my bread toasted with my French Onion soup.  Here's a great recipe for "Parmesan Croutons" that not only toasts the bread, but also adds a bit of flavour to the soup: Combine 3 Tbsp butter (room temperature), 1 clove garlic, 3 Tbsp parmesan and 1 tsp oregano (Oregano is optional).  Cut French bread into 1" pieces.  Spread butter mixture on the bread and bake at 350 degrees until toasted (about 3 to 4 minutes per side).  You can do this ahead of time because the bread will re-heat when you put it into your soup bowls and broil the cheese. Delicious!

I really love french onion soup and I decided to try this recipe.  It turned out very well but I made some substitutions.  I didn't add that much water and added more beef broth.  I also added Worcester, garlic powder and basil and I think it really added a lot of flavor and everyone loved it.

Excellent.  I cubed the slice of bread on top to make it easier to eat and I used shredded Monterey Jack cheese.   Careful with the thyme, it can be overpowering.  Will definitely make again.

I really liked the idea of adding flour to make it thicker.  Here are the changes I made to it:  I slow cooked it for a few hours to make the onions soft (if you do this add more beef broth or water, depending on how salty you want it).  I used provolone cheese instead of mozzarella.  I also broiled the bread by itself with the cheese on it, then placed it into the bowl and broiled it again with more cheese on top.  It came out really good!

Wonderful! I saw the raving reviews for this recipe, and I had to try it! It was so easy, and so delicious! My husband, who doesn't like onions, even liked it! I didn't dilute the broth as much as the recipe calls for, but I don't think it would have been any less good the original way. I also sprinkled a little bit of parmesan cheese over the mozarella. YUM! I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

I'm on a quest to find a match to my favorite French Onion soup which is served at a restaurant in my home town.  This came pretty close! I think next time I may simmer it longer and not add as much thyme. Thanks for sharing it!

This is an excellent, simple recipe that my husband cannot get enough of. I took the advice of one reviewer and caramelized vidalia onions and skipped the sugar and it added the perfect amount of sweetness. I also used a homemade broth rather than a can of soup. This recipe is easy and flavourful but taking more time to cook the soup will ultimately provide a tastier result

This recipe is delicious! The only thing i would change is the amount of Thyme that goes into it. 1/4 tsp is definitely WAY too much. As soon as i opened the lid to give it a stir, that was all i could smell. I then gave it a taste, and thyme was way too over powering. So i added more beef broth. The smell of the onions caramelizing was amazing! I will make this again, only with a tiny pinch of thyme.

Delicious! And pretty easy. I ended up using red wine instead of white, but turned out good anyway. Might use a little less sugar, at least with yellow onions. Other than that, should totally try it! :)

I love this recipe. I made one change but only because I used what I had at home. I had no French bread so I used some green chile cheese bread  (toasted) and it was awesome! Hmmm...the only thing French, besides the name) was the wine. Love it!

I have been making this soup for years and it is awesome! I use 3 onions, 3 beef bouillon and 4 cups of water instead of the beef broth, and only 1/2 t. of pepper.  The longer you cook the onions, the better the soup tastes.

Wonderful recipe- will definitely make again!!  This is now a staple for my fall/winter diet.  Made it exactly as recipe described except that I did fry my onions in the butter for longer...until good and carmelized because I absolutely gree that this is vital for a good French Onion soup.

Great recipe! Très bonne recette du Québec!  I made the following modifications:  - caramelized the onions for 30 min., really a must for French onion soup!  - used home made beef broth  - used fresh parsley instead of dried  - substituted 1/2 cup of port for the white wine  - toasted the bread beforehand  - substituted a gruyère / emmenthal blend for the mozzarella  It was great!

This soup tasted good, but it wasn't like what I order at a restaurant.  It was cloudy because of the flour and I am used to a clear beef broth.  Something was off and I don't know what it was.  I will keep searching for a French Onion Soup that is closer in taste to what I have had in a restaurant.

this is a great recipe! i did carmelize my onions for a lot longer than the suggested 10 minutes. i cooked mine in the butter on low heat for around 45 minutes stirring occassionally. i also put a TBLS of beef broth in towards the end because the pan was dry. i did not use water, instead just all beef broth. i added garlic powder. a little extra wine. be careful with the sugar if your onions are already sweet, they might not need sugar at all. my soup was too sweet so i had to add a little more wine, the garlic, and the salt to even it out.

This is a very tasty French Onion soup, and has become one of my winter staples. The first time I made it I didn’t have any white wine, so I substituted apple juice instead; this worked well and I have continued to use the juice instead of wine.  I also sauté my onions for much longer, usually close to 30 minutes to really bring out their flavour.

This is a really good recipe, but to make it taste the best, you MUST cook the onions for longer than it calls for.  I cooked them for about 30 minutes then added the flour, etc.  
Instead of 4 onions I used 2 very large sweet onions.  

I used a dry red wine instead of white and it gave the soup a deeper taste, which I really enjoyed.  
I also used croutons instead of bread and provolone instead of mozzarella.  

This is a very good soup, and I'll be making it often.

I made this because i had a bunch of green onions from the garden.  What I changed: 
used Cabernet Sauvignon instead of white wine and i added the wine after adding the flour.  I also used 2 cans beef broth and 2 cans vegetable broth.  I think this balanced out well with the taste of the wine.
I used some fresh oregano because i had it as well as the thyme and parsley.  Also, added some garlic.  The flour worked well in this soup.  I always put the flour in a glass and add some hot water to it first and stire vigorously before adding to the  recipe to avoid clumpiness.  I used provolone instead of mozarella and a little bit of parmesan on top.

This is a delious soup!  Turned out great first time even though I cut recipe in half and didn't add as much thyme as called for.  I will make a full batch next time as I think this is one of those soups that will taste even better as left-overs.  Thanks for sharing.

This was my first time making a french onion soup.  My husband liked a local restaurant's version, so I thought why not?.  We were both happy with the results of this soup.  The only change I made was to serve the bread separate...build your own style.  I don't like soggy bread.  I will definately be making this again!  Thanks.

I used consomme instead of beef broth and the flavor was very strong. I added more water, about 1 1/4 cup more and it tasted great.

This soup was great!  I do want to point out the obvious though - if you use red wine, you will have a burgundy-colored soup.  I didn't have any white wine at the time, and I wasn't having company over or anything, so I used red wine.  Still tasted great though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super soup!  I use Gruyère cheese instead and whole wheat bread slices instead of a baguette. Otherwise, I follow this recipe as given, and it's my new favorite onion soup.

This recipe can be a good starter recipe if you've never made FO soup before, but it doesn't come close to the depth and flavor of proper FO soup. The recipe doesn't even call for salt, so adjust as needed. It comes out sort of bland otherwise. It tastes pretty good, but I would personally like to see more depth to this soup. Also the fact that it uses white wine instead of read gives it a pale color compared to some other soups. In my opinion the bread should either be day old, kind of stale or toasted to stand up to the liquid while covered with cheese. Otherwise it can get a bit soft and mushy.

This soup was so yummy!! My husband loved it and said that this recipe was definitely a keeper!! I did make just a few minor changes. I took the advice of others, and did not add the extra water, but did add a little bit extra beef broth. I also only used 3 onions instead of 4.

I'm sorry, I only gave it a 3 because I will never make it again. It's basically a good soup and it will fill you up but I guess I just like the creamy version of this soup.

I don't keep broth on hand so I used beef bouillon to make my broth.  Like another reviewer, I didn't add water which kept the flavor stronger.  I improvised on the bread, using the country white I had in my fridge, but the end result - even in my unskilled hands - was delicious!   It's a keeper! Thanks for sharing it.

My husband and I loved this soup - better than any restaurant!  Because I'm a vegetarian, I used Maggi vegetarian vegetable boullion to substitute for the beef broth.  Also threw in a little bit of kosher salt.  It wasn't the color of traditional French onion soup, but incredibly good.  I had a snow day from school so had time to bake my own bread.  I baked the soup at 450 till the cheese melted - about 5 minutes - and then broiled for another 2 minutes.  It looked and tasted perfect.

Delicious!! Best I have tasted so far.  I made this soup with modifications - some from the reviews I read and one of my own.  I did not use any water and doubled the broth.  I also used Cab Sav instead of white wine (didn't have any) which gave the broth a nice flavor. I opted for aged provolone and alpine swiss for the cheeses.  The provolone was great, but the alpine swiss was not such a good choice as it does not have the greatest scent when browned in the oven.

This was the best french onion soup that I've ever had - granted, this was only the fourth time that I've had French Onion soup. I sauteed the onions for about 30 mins until they were fairly carmelized.  I deglazed the pan with the beef broth.  Then I used Pinot Grigio as the wine.  At the end, I used gruyere and mozzarella cheese on top.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe.   Changes I made: 1. Instead of water I used chicken stock (I read in a gormet cookbook that using both chicken stock and beef stock was the best.  2. I used cooking sherry instead of traditional white wine.  3. I carmelized the onions.    Great recipe!

Excellent base recipe. A good quality white wine or vermouth is essential. The onions take a bit longer to saute than suggested so just feel that out. I added a splash of worcestershire and swiss cheese instead of cheddar. I do like to toast the french bread prior to adding it to the soup, it seems to hold a nice consistency. This is YUMMY! And soooo simple to pull together! Hubby loved it and so didn't I.

I let the onions carmalize for about a half hour, that was the only change I made.  Next time I would cut down on the pepper a little, but other than that it is a great recipe!

This soup was delicious!!!!!  A few slight variations I made were - using beef soup base instead of canned stock and omitting the water.  Also, I added the sugar to the onions in the beginning because I find that the carmelization is richer.  Instead of all white wine I used 1 part white wine and 1 part sherry.  The finishing touch was a dash of worcestershire.  My husband ate 3 bowls, 2 w/ cheese, 1 without!  Really marvelous, thank you.

Yum!!!!  I have never had french onion soup before, but I wanted to try making some, and this recipe was just wonderful.  Even my onion hating husband made "yummy noises" while eating it and requested I make it again. :) I used swiss cheese for the top and homemade french bread from this site, and I also added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the broth before adding to the onions. I cooked the onions longer than 10 minutes (more like 30) to give them color, and it really hit the spot on a cold winter night!

I love this recipe! It is a great starter for french onion soup lovers everywhere. I would say though that the secret to an amazing pot of soup everytime is always slow cooking. I cooked my onions on low for about an hour and then simmered the soup for a about two more and there is no lack of flavor there at all. It's always great to put your own spin on a simply great recipe. I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce for flavor and I used homemade Elderberry wine in place of the white, YUM! I also subbed Tony Chacherie's White Gravy mix for the flour. You can never go wrong changing up the little bits here and there and making a recipe to own tastes, especially one with such great bones as this one.

My family and I really didn't like this soup at all. We've had it from many fine dinning restraunts, and from many different people and this recipe is not very good at all to our standards.

I had to knock this down a notch because almost everyone who wrote a review has changed the recipe a bit from the way it's written.  I tried making it before reading the reviews and found it tasty, but lacking something  Next time I'll try carmelizing the onions and do something to make the soup darker.

This recipe was so yummy! I didn't add any sugar because I didn't think it was necessary, or white wine (just because I didn't have any). I also had homemade turkey stock on hand so I used that instead of canned beef broth. Also, since I don't have any individual bowls to broil the soups, I just toasted up some organic flour-free flax bread with mozza cheese in the oven and placed on top of the bowl of soup before serving. Another change was I used fresh thyme and parsley instead of dried. I also cooked the onions WAY longer than the 10 minutes, to caramelize them like so many other people have advised to. I even accidentally burnt them a bit, but I think that just made the flavour even better! I know that seems like quite a few changes but in my opinion, they are very minor. Very yummy, thanks for sharing! I didn't realize how easy french onion soup could be! :) Oh yes, and I probably let the soup simmer longer than the recipe advises which I think just develops the flavour even more.

Great soup.  Added worchestershire for taste and coloring. wasn't cloudy at all. did do the wine although I normally wouldn't def. adds demension to the flavor.  this is supposed to be a sweet and lightly flavored soup because it is soaked up in the bread and is usually with a salty cheese like swiss. I made my beef stock homeade and my french baguettes homeade off of this sight...yummy!  I cooked my onions on low for an hour and used red onions because they are universally known to have a deeper flavor.

I have used this recipe as a base for a few years now. To me, this is a good introduction to the French Onion Soup. It's not daunting at all.

I made this a couple of days ago.  Used one spanish onion and one sweet onion.  Also added the sugar right away as per another reviewers suggestion.  My son-in-law loved it.  I made it for him as he broke his jaw a couple of weeks ago and went through surgery.  He's on a liquid diet for 6 weeks.  Used half cheddar and half mozzarella cheese but did not put under broiler only melted it.  He said he had been craving bread and this he could eat without chewing.  Thanks, from Ontario

This was an ok recipe, The broth didnt have much flavor, i had to doctor it up a bit with worshtishire and garlic and tons of salt. It wasnt the best FOS but it satisfied my craving. tasted much better with the cheese and bread added.

This was really tasty after a few tweaks.
I caramelized the onions with butter and sugar( I was using yellow onions) over low heat.
I added 2 small bay leaves, a teaspoon of garlic powder,eliminated the water and went with all beef broth(low sodium),added a teaspoon of worstershire sauce and a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar(to cut the flour butter mixture).  During the cook I was tasting, and I felt the thyme was a little overpowering but a nice change for this soup. After adding the wine and tasting, the thyme fit right in, I added 1 teaspoon of beef bouillon(so much for the low sodium), but the soup as I prepared it absolutely needed it).

Good recipe, will do again.

Amazing dish! Even my picky boyfriend, who is an Onion Soup connoisseur said this dish was the best homemade French Onion Soup he'd ever had. I did spend a bit longer on caramelizing the onions and changed the herbs a bit to ones I had more readily available, but I will be making this again in the very near future!

This is perfect.  Carmelize the onions if possible - and use a really high quality crusty baguette.  Delicious, delicious, delicious.

It was delicious!

BUT, needs stronger broth. I only had cubes, so I used five cups of water and five cubes...I'll use same water next time, but use about 7 cubes. also added about 1/4  cup of worcestershire sauce to give a little more zip. 

I've never used wine in a recipe and normally don't like soups and sauces with wine, but this was excellent. I used just cooking wine and now I think I know why they should tell you to use good wine, because while it was still good, I think it would be sooo much better with a reall y dry decent white wine.

it's a keeper!!

I had such a craving for French Onion Soup.  The weather was lousy and didn't want to go out.  I decided to try this recipe.  I did it exactly the way the recipe said with no changes.  My husband and I at all of it!  This one's a keeper.

This soup was great!  I ended up only using two and a half onions, because a vidalia I used was HUGE.  I used reduced-sodium beef broth, but next time I will use regular beef broth, because I ended up adding salt.  I used red wine instead of white and added a little garlic powder.  My husband loved it.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent.  I used reduced sodium beef broth, used more broth instead of water and about 6oz of white wine I had.  I added a little salt as it cooked.  I used a little more sugar while cooking the onions.  I had provolone cheese and cuban bread on hand and it came out wonderful.

I made this recipie with some left over prime rib added (about 6 oz) and it turned out great. If you don't have prime rib on hand, try some deli roast beef. I made it for my wife on Valentine's day and paier it with a salad, and it was the perfect mid winter dinner. I also substituted Gryere cheese instead of Mozerella for a bit more bite and a little less "stringyness".

I did not particularly care for this recipe. I cooked it according to the directions and it came out flavorless and the onions were way undercooked. I Would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Excellent recipe. I decreased the wine to about 3 oz and used red wine instead of white. And added a 1/2 tsp or so of worcestershire sauce too. Yum yum! I eat it without the bread and cheese and it is still very filling.

Lovely soup. For a change try replacing the white wine with red, it adds even more depth. Also a dash of worcestershire sauce adds a lovely subtle kick.

This recipe's broth turned out great!  Next time I think I would carmelize the onions before adding the broth though.  I used fresh basil instead of thyme and parsley.  Also, I prefer jarsburg or a sharp cheese over mozzarella.  This was a perfect soup for a cold, rainy night.

This is now a staple in my house!!  I've made this so many times now, that I've got some additions that make it even better!!  I don't add any water; I add a can of beef consomme, and increase the amount of wine.  I still add the dried thyme for presentation, but I also add a few sprigs of fresh thyme and just remove before serving.  We've tried another French Onion soup from this site, the Gratinee I think it was, and there's no point in doing so after this recipe.  This will definitely be a family recipe from now on!  Thanks!

Hands down, the very best french onion soup I have ever had. So delicious! I used havarti for some of the bowls, and parmesan on others. I definitely recommend havarti (sliced) rather than grated parmesan-it changed the flavor of the soup. I did not try mozzarella, but imagine it would be much the same result as the havarti.

This soup was good, but too bland, I thought.  Next time I make it I'll try adding a beef boullion.  Also, I would leave out the sugar.

I made this recipe with only 2 changes.  I added a slice of swiss cheese to be melted on top of the bowl and I used slightly less wine than was called for (3/4 cup).  My husband and I loved it.  Very tasty and the wine seemed to give the soup a very interesting depth of flavours.  Very nice and will definitely   make again!!

Very yummy soup.  Made some small changes: used only two onions instead of four and sauteed them until they were limp and browning (about 20 minutes).  Added a boullion cube with the water.  Substituted dried oregano and garlic powder for the parsley (not a parsley fan).  And finally used Havarti instead of mozzarella.  Will definately make again.

My husband and I went out to dinner with our girls a week or so ago. We had onion soup and I then found out my girls liked it. So I came here looking for a recipe for the soup. I tried this one and it was even better than the one at the restaurant. We will be making this again and again....

Well it's about a year since I wrote the above and we still enjoy this recipe at least once a week. My girls don't even like the restarunt onion soup anymore

This onion soup recipe desperately needs salt. I also will omit the flour the next time I make it. This recipe need to be much more, “brothy.”

Great. Fried onions in pan until carmelized (maybe 15 mins), added flour, then put in pot. Deglazed pan with white wine. Added a couple beef boullion cubes to soup. Warmed in oven with nice bread on top and cheese. NOTE: Was salty.

Red wine instead of white.  Veg and/or beef stock.  Worschester or Maggi sauce  deepens flavour.
We used Asiago and Parmesan cheeses.

A good starter recipe especially since I've never made French onion soup before. I do however have to agree with several other folks here. This recipe is a bit more on the sweet side rather than savory, probably due to the white wine. Next time I'll use red wine and add more beef broth, and not add water. I also used provolone cheese instead of mozzarella (didn't have any Gruyere , sadly).

Pretty good.  Used a few more onions than originally called for (6 small).  Put in a touch of salt (to taste) and a dab of worcestershire sauce as well

Well I kinda changed a lot...but this was a great base. I only used 3 big onions instead of four (one red, one white, one yellow as that's what I had on hand). I let them caramelize in the butter for a good 45 mins before adding the flour and sugar, and I only used 1/2 the pepper. I used two big 32 beef broth cartons, and then tossed in about 6-7 beef bouillon cubes and about a cup and 1/2 of water and the parsley and thyme. I let that simmer for about 30-45 mins before adding the white wine, a few splashes of Worcester sauce and about 4 tablespoons of a Shiraz. I let all of that simmer together for about an hour and then topped with toasted baguette pieces, provolone and swiss and broiled. DELICIOUS! I would give it 4.5 stars if I could - only thing holding me back from 5 stars is if I would have had some Gruyere cheese instead.

I don't know if I'm missing something, but after two attempts, this just isn't that great; I'm getting nothing great like other reviewers are rating it. My guests didn't ask for seconds, which is a telling sign. I'll try another recipe next time for French onion soup.

perfect, I also add a tad of red wine to the mix which is something french cooks typically do, usually only half a cup with the white wine.

Only gave 4 stars because I thought the recipe was missing a few things.  I made the recipe exact, but found I had to add some ingredients to make it pop. Worcestershire was a must!  It was missing a bit of something else, just haven't figured it out yet.  However, the recipe itself is agreat starting point!  I used Gruyere cheese and french baguette to top it off!

You really should use Swiss Ementhaler or a Gruyere  for the cheese and FRESH Thyme and Parsley. I also used the more traditional Red Wine and I used one and a half cups of just a middle of the road red, you could also use Marsala. This version should be called the Canadian onion soup.

Made this for my boyfriend and he LOVED it. It was more flavorful and complex than anything we've had in a restaurant.   I doubled the recipe and used 4 large white onions and 2 med sweet onions, which I cooked til they just started to caramelize. I left out the sugar, added a few dashes of Worcestershire, used Marsala wine, and topped it with cheese and garlic croutons and mozzarella cheese. We skipped the broiling and just poured the soup over shredded cheese.

This soup was pretty good and pretty easy to make. It wasn't wow! I guess it was pretty classic but wasn't bursting with flavor. I added quite a bit of salt as well to make it a little more flavorful. Looking at other recipes, I added Worchestershire sauce to the leftovers and it did give it a better flavor.

I loved this recipe...I got two red onions & two yellow onions and I didn't chop them...I sliced them then i halfed the slices, liked it better that way! I also put the sugar in with the butter to cook the onions first! I added 48oz. beef broth and cut out the water, I also added more wine too, prolly about two cups  :)  Very YUMMY!!!

I made this soup tonight for dinner. Everybody LOVED it! I just found the pepper flavor to bit a be overpowering so if you don't enjoy things with a strong peppery flavor, you may want to adjust the pepper amount to half of what it says here. Other than that this recipe definitely desevres five stars!

I used fresh parsley (because I had it) and I took the time to caramelize the onions. I used Provolone to melt on top. I have never had french onion soup before so I guess I really do not like it. My husband said it was good and it tasted like normal french onion soup.

I skipped the thyme and added bay leaf instead. Also added a little more stock and wine and a little less H2O. Made for a richer soup. Also, if you toast the bread before putting it on the soup it tend to retain a firmer texture and not become so mushy so quickly. Great recipe!

this was very good. the thyme and white wine really give it a nice flavor. i had leftover beef au jus so i used that. i also made croutons out of some leftover homemade bread. i dont have individual soup crocks so i used a soup terrine and served it family style. i added a salad w/ the creamy french dressing recipe from this site to make it a meal.

Very tasty and easy to follow.  This is the first time I made French onion soup and it turned out as tasy as restaurant versions.

I'm going to rate this in the middle because I'm a NEW cook... lol... I used sodium free beef broth - it was horrible, so that's on me, but the recipe called for shredded mozzeralla... not a good idea! It sunk to the bottom and didn't want to melt... probaby will make it again...

I followed the recipe exactly & found it to be on the sweet/bland side.  I added a little Worcestershire sauce to my bowl of soup & it improved the flavor a little.  I probably won't make it again as the consistency was kind of thick & it seems to need a darker, richer beef broth than the canned variety.

This was really good - but I felt there were too many onions in it - maybe my onions were just really big! Next time I make it I will use much more broth!

This soup turned out good, but It seemed a little watered down in taste when I used beef broth from a can. I am going to richen up the beef flavor next time with bouline cubes.

The flavor in this soup is phenomenal (and I didn't even have wine to add - I can't imagine how it could be better!).  I didn't have parsley, but I did add a bay leaf while it was simmering on the stove.  I also used vidalia onions and cooked them for a good 30-45 minutes in order to caramelize them and sweeten the deal.  I'll definitely make this again - it tasted just like it was from a restaurant.

A very easy recipe yielding a very tasty soup.  This was my first time cooking french onion soup and it was a snap.  The soup came out very tasty.  I substituted a 1/2 cup of red cooking wine for the recommended 1 cup of white wine and my wife and I really enjoyed it.

My onion-hating husband and son both enjoyed this soup. I LOVED it! Sauted onions until carmelized (sp?) and omitted wine as I did not have any on hand. Next time will use wine, but probably red-definitely needs it. Will also chill and skim fat before re-heating as I found it really thick, fatty.

My family really enjoyed this.  I had to get used to the thyme in it...I don't think the onion soups I've had before had any thyme in it, so I just wasn't accustomed to the flavor...but it turned out excellent.  My husband loved it and even my two young girls - who don't eat ANYTHING - kept coming back to me to try more.  Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe is really tasty. I too let the onions cook longer then 10 minutes. Allowing the onions to caramelize will bring out the darker color of the soup that is desired. Just be careful not to burn the flour,butter, onion mixture. I omitted 1/4 c. of water and the sugar. I would definitely have this recipe again.

WOW! I was looking for onion soup that was easy to prepare as well as tasty. This was perfect. I made a few minor changes: used beef bouillon cubes instead of cans and let it simmer until they dissolved, a little less wine, and added just a touch of Gravy Master because the color looked too light to me - that was purely mental, I'm sure! Very good.

Like others, I sauteed the onions for around 45 minutes until they were carmelized, and it turned out good. I used 3 large sweet onions and am very glad I decided to omit the sugar -- given how the onions were carmelized the soup was already sweet; some sugar would have put it into dessert territory. Also added the garlic powder some suggested - gave it a little more flavor. Overall - YUM!

It was a little light on flavor, so I had to add some Au Jus powder. But then it tasted just like what I get at a fancy restaurant in town here.

Easy but on the bland side. I added salt to taste and some Tuscan herbs and a smidge more thyme. Hubby loved it. He said it was even better the second day.

Excellent!!  My significant and I loved it.  Served with a steak and wedge salad.  Only changes I made were that I sautéed the onions for 35 min., in the last 5 minutes of sautéing I added two cloves of chopped garlic and 4 diced mushrooms.  I also omitted the water.  Did I say this was excellent!

I thought this was excellent.  I am always scared to make soups but this one I will make a lot!  Very easy and quick to make.  I used 3 onions instead of 4 and didnt add any water, although next time I'll put in half a cup or so.  I didnt have any thyme so I just left that out. I cooked the onions for awhile so they were very soft and translucent.  I also didnt have a baguette, so I just cut up a piece of whole wheat sandwhich bread and it was awesome!  Glad I made the whole recipe even though there is only 2 of us.

I really like this soup recipe now that I have tried others.  The addition of the wine I feel is a must and I really like the flavor of thyme.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is better then any French onion soup I've tasted! I added a little to much thyme, but it still came out delicious! I will defiantly be trying other recipes, but keeping this one around!

Pretty much followed it to a T and it came out great! The only thing I did was that I floated garlic/butter crutons on top of the soup and then put the cheese on them before a brief broil

I thought this recipe was really good although it turned out pretty spicy.  I don't know if it was the thyme or the beef broth I bought but my son almost couldn't eat it because it was so spicy.  It was a really easy, quick meal that was delicious though and my husband loved it.  Next time I'll check the beef broth flavor and maybe cut the thyme in half.  All in all a great recipe.  Makes the house smell good while cooking too!

I am hesitant to review this because I made so many changes.  First of all I used olive oil instead of butter, vegetable broth, no flour, and a cup of ESB (extra bitter beer) instead of white wine.  I didn't put the bread and cheese on top of the soup.  I sliced a baguette in half, topped it with shredded swiss and parm, paprika, and broiled it.  It was so good!  Perhaps not classic, but I highly recommend it.  : )

My husband and kids loved this soup, but I found it rather sweet and lacking that rich, dark broth of by favorite restaurant french onion soups.  It wasn't bad, mind you, just not my favorite.

Excellent.  I have been searching for the perfect French Onion Soup recipe and have finally found it.  My husband thinks it is as good as Le Papillion Restaurant's (Toronto, Ontario)French Onion Soup.  A definite keeper!!!
