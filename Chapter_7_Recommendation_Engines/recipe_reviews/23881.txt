This recipe was very tasty, however next time I would do some things differently.  For one, you don't need a half cup of butter, in fact because I watch my weight, I won't use any butter or butter substitute at all.  The cheese makes more than enough oil.  Nevertheless, the bourban is the bomb!!  Meaning, the recipe is great, I would tweek it a little bit and make it over and over again!!

EASY AND SUPER!  As I was throwing this dish together, I thought it would never work because it was way too easy.  It turned out to be fantastic!  Chicken was super-moist and the over all flavor delicious.  The whole family, including two picky kids, loved it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be going into the 'rotation'. :)

This was quite good and very easy to prepare. I used only cream of chicken soup(all I had on hand), and added two stalks of chopped up celery.  Also reduced the amount of butter a lot and served dish over white rice.  The bland rice balanced out the richness of the sauce nicely. Also, it did not need to be baked quite as long a recipe states to get chicken fully cooked(was 195 degrees at center after about 45 minutes).

It's way too fattening and the sauce is a little too thick for our liking.  It needs to be smoother and thinner.  It did have good flavor, however.  I would make it again for my husband but my kids didn't care for it.

This was just so-so; glad I tried it but doubt I'll make it again (I was really excited about this, too!). It just turned out bland, even with using 1/2 c bourbon; I felt like it was a waste of good spirits. The chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork, but didn't pick up any flavor. I wonder if result would be different if bourbon was mixed in with the soup & cheese mixture. This was definately worth trying, though!

My whole family loved this dinner. It was fabulous. It was easy to make and comes out perfect without having to add anything else to it. I served it with butter and herb noodles.

This is a winner!  I only used one can of cream of chicken soup based on other reviews that the sauce was "gloppy" and too thick.  My sauce was perfect.  I also seasoned my chicken with a little garlic powder before topping with the soup and cheese mixture.  Baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees and the chicken was melt in your mouth tender.  Next time, I'm going to add sliced mushrooms to the dish.  But the recipe is great even without making modifications.  Try it - - you'll enjoy it!

Tastes fine but the bread crumb coating didn't turn out so hot. The parts that the melted butter came into contact with made a soggy stuffing like topping. What didn't get wet stayed dry and fell apart. While it tasted good, I don't think I will make this again. Maybe the thing to do it mix the crumbs, butter and bourbon in a seperate bowl and the spead the mixture over the top of the chicken and reaming surface of the dish. Just a thought.

definitely not the dish we make in the south... very bland & tasted as if just poured cans of condensed soup on top & heated..  would recommend if you try this, you add other ingrediants to cut the soupy taste,,

I only used one can of cream of chicken and no cream of celery.  I also used more cheese...probably about a cup of a parmasan blend.  I also mixed the burbon (maybe a tablespoon or so..I didn't measure) in with the soup/chicken.  I then melted the butter (about 1/4 cup) and mixed in bread crumbs in until it was crumbly.  I added some garlic and onion powders then sprinkled it all over.  It was pretty good!  I will be making it again.

I added a little cajun seasoning to the chicken before putting the sauce and toppings on.  Very tasty!  Will make again!

Bland is the verdict on this one and the sauce was so thick it was sticky. Served over rice made a colossal mess of what looked like slop. The only good thing was the chicken breasts came out wonderfully tender and juicy, albeit not too flavorful. Am deleting this one from my box.

I've made this recipe quite a few times in the past two years, and the only real change that I usually make is to cube the chicken, rather than throwing the whole chicken breast in.  This allows people to better pick their portion size, and lets more people enjoy it.

Good recipe, but I agree with skipping on the butter. I also made this dish with a can of ettoufee mix, one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of shrimp. I added various herbs and spices and I love it this way also. You can definitely play this recipe up. Thanks. Also, my 2 year old will actually eat meat this way, YEAH!!!

While this dish was very good, It seemed a little heavy for us.  I made because I found the recipe using the ingredient search feature since I had chicken and mozzerella cheese to use.  It was delicious, but I won't make it again.

This turned out great.  I stuffed 8 chicken breast in the pan without increasing the other ingredients and it turned out fine.  I used fontina cheese instead of mozzarella.  This only took 40 minutes to cook, instead of 1 hour.
Excellent served over rice.

I did not like the texture of this dish. I think it would have been better to   have a breaded chicken cutlet wit a bourbon sauce.

VERY good & tender!  I seasoned the chicken first, though.  Substituted cream of mushroom soup & cheddar cheese soup because I didn't have the other ingredients.  I imagine there are many subs & variations to this recipe - and all delicious.

A very easy recipe!  I made this for a few friends on New Year's Eve, & they really liked this dish.  I served it with steamed rice, which worked wonderfully with the sauce.  I did not have cream of celery, but used a can of cream of chicken with about a 1/2 can of milk to help keep it liquidy.  I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because I really did not like the bourbon in the sauce - it made it a bit bitter.  Next time, I think I'll try it without the whiskey.

This smelled heavenly while cooking! We all really enjoyed it. Very yummy! Will definitely make again! I wonder how it would taste with crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs.

Very rich but very good.  House will smell like fresh baked bread.

I ommitted the butter altogether when making this, as I thought it would be way to oily with the cream soup and cheese.  It tasted pretty good over hot white rice.

What a great dish!  I did do some substituing though.  I substitued reisling for the bourbon and also added more cheese.  I had 1/2 block of fresh mozzerella and used the remainder which I'm guessing was well over a cup.  Once I added the cheese in with the soup I realized it was a bit too clumpy so I added some milk and it turned out great!  The wine really gave it a nice touch too.  Next time I think I will substitute stuffing mix instead of bread crumps and see how that turns out.  This is a keeper recipe and I definitely will make it again!
