Cynthia's Famous Chili Haiku: "Dropped the pinto beans. But the rest I kept the same. What's up with spices?" It was hard to tell if the spices were accidentally duplicated in the ingredient list, but I didn't see much point to seasoning the ground beef w/ all of that, followed by adding everything to the pot while measuring all the spices out again, so I just added it all at once after the meat was browned and drained, which incidentally, the recipe doesn't indicate to drain. I can't say that this chili blew our minds, but I thought it would be way more flavorful w/ all of those spices, not to mention also including a McCormick packet of chili seasoning; if anything, the packet plus the 1 TB seasoning salt made this awfully salty, so we didn't get as much enjoyment over dragging Frito Scoops through it. Maybe w/ some changes here and there I'd make it again, but otherwise, won't live on as a famous recipe in our house.

This recipe turned out amazing. Everyone enjoyed it. I made a few small changes based on what I had in my pantry. I left out the annatto seed and added more paprika. I left out the red beans and included a can of corn.  I served it with shredded cheese and blue chips.
