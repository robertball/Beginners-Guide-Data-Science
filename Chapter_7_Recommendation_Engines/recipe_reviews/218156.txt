I'm not really sure why none of the 900-some people who have saved this recipe haven't reviewed it because it is amazing! I've never made ice cream before and my mom wanted lemon ice cream for her birthday, so I researched a ton of recipes and decided this is the one I would attempt. What a great decision that was! This recipe was easy to make and tastes absolutely delicious!

OMG! Yum!!! I got an ice cream maker for Mother's Day and have used it to make sorbet so far. This was my first ice cream recipe. Lemon is one of my favorite flavors, so I was super excited to try this one! It is ridiculously good! Even though I had to substitute 1/2 cup of Splenda for the sugar because I managed to run out with all the baking I've been doing, it came out with a nice balance of tart and sweet. Creamy, delicious, a winner!

My grandmother would always make homemade lemon ice cream when she was alive.  Sadly, since she passed away no one has made lemon ice cream at gatherings.  To fix the lemon ice cream craving, I searched Allrecipes for a recipe that would give a strong lemon essence and...I found it!  I was momentarily hesitant to try it because of the low number of reviews, but with the high number of saves and the use of natural lemon zest/juice, I decided to try it.

This ice cream is AMAZING. It is so delicious and is better than anything bought in the store.  I only had 1/2 cup of the lemon juice, it was still very present in the ice cream!  My daughter, who loves lemons on their own, this is awesome ice cream.  She's eating a scoop right now trying to make it last.  I wonder how even more delicious this would have been with the actual amount of juice it called for in the recipe.

The only negative for her, but not for me, is one that is easily remedied.  She would have preferred less zest.  The zest is needed to give a strong lemon flavor but you can always strain it out after cooking if you don't want it in your ice cream.  (Think of it as lemon flavored coconut.)

This recipe is the only recipe I will use for lemon ice cream.  No artificial flavors or ingredients, just pure lemon deliciousness!

Mmmmm, refreshingly tart, but not too tart.  Just right sweet.  A GREAT after dinner dessert because of it.  But...I made a couple of (minor) deviations. I made a lemon-lime version, using half of each.  Also, after juicing enough lemons and limes to get that 3/4 cup of juice I found I only had about half the zest required.  I wasn't about to have "naked" limes and lemons laying around, so I used the 1-1/2 T. of zest and called it a day.  It was perfect!  In fact, I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed this any more using twice as much zest and may even have enjoyed it less.  I loved that the recipe called for my preferred ratio of 2:1 heavy cream to half-and-half and, while I was a little concerned about how the added large amount of lemon juice would affect the mouth feel, I needn't have worried.  In spite of adding essentially 3/4 cup of "water" to the mix, the resulting ice cream was still creamy and rich, with no unpleasant iciness.  This tasted darn close to a Key Lime or lemon pie and I'm thinking some coarsely chopped graham crackers folded in at the end would be awesome good.

My mom bought me an ice cream maker, so I told her I'd bring ice cream for Easter. I made three kinds: marshmallow, blueberry, and this lemon recipe. This was BY FAR everyone's favorite. The tartness and creaminess are so delicious! I did strain the zest out, but I would definitely let it steep for awhile, as most of the flavor comes from the zest. Also, it would not thicken in the ice cream maker, which made me really nervous, but after 25 minutes, I took it out and put it in the freezer. After three hours it had set up so nice. It was almost like a gelato. I've already had requests to bring this one again for future birthday parties. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!
UPDATE: I tried it again, and this time whipped the heavy whipping cream until the soft peak stage before adding, and that did the trick! It set up a lot nicer. YUM YUM!

Fan flippin TASTIC! I have made this several different ways, beside just as written. It's great like it is, but we prefer to reverse the proportions of heavy cream and half-and-half, meaning one cup heavy cream and two cups of half-and-half. It's a bit less unctuous that way, with less cholesterol and fewer calories, allowing that fresh, clean taste to shine. It's still wonderfully creamy this way, and quite rich enough. I especially like to use Meyer lemons from our back yard, harvested just before making the base. Subbing 1/4 cup limoncello for 1/4 cup of the lemon juice keeps it scoopable right from the freezer. I have also steeped 1 cup of roughly torn basil leaves in the heated cream/sugar mix for an hour, straining the leaves out before proceeding with the custard. SPECTACULAR, as well as quite chic. We love it topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries. Any which way you make this, however, you're going to love it even more than you think you will. It's the type of thing that sneaks up on you. After it's all gone, you'll be pining for more.

This is the second summer I've used this recipe and I can't get enough! I use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest and steep for more like 30 mins before adding the eggs. I refrigerate everything overnight, then strain the lemon zest before adding the juice and freezing. I also use a whole cup of fresh lemon juice. If you are a lemon fan, this is the best ice cream you'll ever taste!

Didn't change a thing!  If you don't like it lemony, you can reduce the amount of lemon juice.  Tastes like a lemon meringue pie filling but in ice cream form.  Will try using it to make a lemon ice cream pie in graham cracker crust with sweetened whipped cream topping for a frozen dessert!

Truly haven't made this yet, but wanted to share a trick to wring the best flavor from the zest. Place the zest in a small bowl and sprinkle with the granulated sugar and let it sit for about an hour before adding it to the liquids to heat. The oils will be extracted and give a very intense lemon flavor.  I can't wait to try this recipe. Lemon is my absolutely favorite flavor.

This is a fantastic lemon ice cream with a frozen custard-like consistency.  The only change I made was to double the half-&-half.  For a six-quart (1-1/2 gallon) ice cream freezer, double the recipe.

I loved this ice cream.  The lemon flavor was great.  I used juice with no zest as  I didn't have any actual lemons.  A definite keeper!

Of course you have to strain it.  The recipe should have said so.  But the flavor is really lovely.  I'm a professional pastry chef and I have adapted this recipe to use in one of my fancy desserts (a lemon ice cream sandwich using lemon cookies.)  I used about 15% more egg yolks and added vanilla bean to the mixture.  I also added a good pinch of salt.

Loved this recipe however, I had wanted a lemon/ginger ice cream recipe.  this is what I did!  Near the end of the freezing time in my ice cream machine, I added crushed ginger snaps with minced candy ginger.  It was sooooo good!!!

Superb lemon flavour and very creamy! I strained the lemon zest as I like ice cream to melt in my mouth, not to be chewed! If you like lemon, this is a keeper.

Excellent lemon ice cream.  I may have done something off, but mine did not come out creamy.  Will try again in a bit.

Great recipe! I made this with the intention of sharing with friends and neighbors at a block party. However, after tasting it as I cleaned the dasher, my partner declared "We're not sharing!" We took a salad to the party instead. :-D

OMG!!! If heaven tastes like lemon ice cream, then I just ate it! This turned out so smooth and creamy and lemony lovey! 

I used organic lemon juice rather then the real stuff, simply because I had some. I also strained the mixture through a sieve before putting it in my refrigerator over night. 

My husband agrees that this is the best home made ice cream he has ever had, and said a person could make money selling that stuff! 

Yummy- 10,000 stars to you AOSWALT

LOVE this ice cream! Never had lemon ice cream before (lemon sorbet, yes, but not ice cream). We raise chickens of our own, so have plenty of eggs for this recipe. It is absolutely wonderful and a naturally beautiful yellow hue! Not too sweet and not too tart. 3 lemons yielded just enough juice but 2 of the 3TB of zest. Seems to work out fine. We don't mind the zest in the ice cream but as others have mentioned, can strain it, if it bothers you.  We've made this recipe twice now and it's perfect each time.

This is the best ice cream I've EVER made. It is delicious and refreshing, it's creamy and has a very clean, fresh finish. Keep the zest in, as it adds a kick and you don't really notice it if it's been grated finely enough. Cannot recommend this enough!

I am a 100% lemon fan but I have to say this ice cream was just ok. I followed directions to the tee, and even strained the lemon zest like others suggested. It was good. I'm glad others enjoyed it but I will not be making it again. It did not taste like ice cream but reminded me of lemon sherbet type thing.

Absolutely fantastic. We saved some of the lemon zest to sprinkle on top right before serving, and garnished with mint--it looked and tasted amazing. Rave reviews from guests, and disappeared in a flash.

This was the most lemony lemon ice cream I've ever tasted.  It has a very bright and very tart flavor; it is not subtle at all.  Like many others,I strained the zest after I steeped it.  I also used all half and half instead of heavy cream, so my ice cream was less creamy than it could have been.  It reminds me of a really good sherbet.  I also added two Tbl of lemoncello for added flavor and to help keep the ice cream nice and scoopable.  Next time I will probably use some heavy cream for a creamier final product.

My husband said this was so good you could sell it...and that is high praise from him.  It is very good.  The only thing I did differently was to strain it before cooling it just to make sure there were no lumps.

This was my first time making ice cream, and I was very impressed. There was pieces of egg yolk in it, but that is something I need to figure out. The only thing I would change about this is I would definitely stain out the zest after cooking. It kind of ruined the texture for me.

I made this as directed with the additional steps adding in some limoncello (about a 1/3 cup) on top of 1/2 cup of lemon juice (reduce amount of juice and replace with limoncello) and using a chinois to strain out the zest prior to refrigerating the custard.  Very smooth, very creamy.  I am making a second double batch this weekend for guests.

My family loves lemon ice cream so we made this recipe, following it exactly.  It was way to rich and so tart.  Nobody liked it, unfortunately.

Wow! Didn't have any half-and-half so I substituted some milk and melted butter. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it is amazing! My 12 year-old step-son said it was some of the best ice cream he's ever eaten. This will definitely be our go-to recipe for ice cream.

Don't: Skimp on the cream or sugar. They're needed to balance the tartness of the lemons.
Do: Substitute 3 Tbl Karo Light Corn Syrup for 1/8 c sugar. Karo prevents the formation of larger ice crystals and you'll get a softer, creamier finished product. Beware, other brands may contain HFCS.

Tastes like lemon chiffon pie.  Delicious and refreshing.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe. I regret not making a double batch. I only added 5 ounces of lemon juice because that was all I could squeeze out, but it was plenty.

This was super creamy, tart and delicious!  I have also made it with one cup each whole milk, heavy cream and half and half, incorporating a about 1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum.  Both ways resulted in a refreshing, delicious ice cream.

Love the amount of tart for this treat. I highly recommend straining at least twice. The only change I made was that I added limoncello to the lemon juice towards the end.

Excellent ice cream, incredible consistency and flavor.  Next time I would follow another reviewer's advice and reverse the proportions of half and half and heavy cream as this was *very* rich tasting.

Ooohhh... This is fantastic!  I saw a review where the person switched around the amounts of half and half with the heavy cream.  The reviewer cited the weird ice crystals that form when the fat content is too high.  I, too, have had this happen so I did the same thing.
My ONLY negative comment is that the lemon zest should be strained out.  I did not strain it and although I don't mind the mouthfuls of lemon peel that get left behind after swallowing this lemony goodness, I will definitely strain this next time!
Other than that, Bravo!

Very bold and sweet lemon taste.  I might try it again with milk instead of half and half as it has a cream aftertaste.  I put the lemon zest in the food processor with the sugar so I did not have to strain the zest out.

Phenomenal ice cream! I haven't been on AllRecipes in ages, but I had to come back and thank you for this recipe. I needed a vehicle for a lemon-elderflower ice cream to celebrate the Royal Wedding. I replaced part of the lemon juice with elderflower syrup, and it was heavenly. I'm going to keep these same proportions, when I make other ice cream flavors in the future.

I give it a 5.  I have made a lot of no cook ice cream trying to make a little healthier version compared to store bought.  

Organic Cream, Organic 1/2 and 1/2, organic sugar, etc.  I decided to try this and used organic lemons and organic eggs.  It came out awesome.

I think I will add some orange or lime zest next time just to have a small amount of color.

We made it for a BBQ yesterday, swapped the amounts for the cream and 1/2 and 1/2 to make it a little lighter, and it was still very rich and creamy. Very refreshing on a 90 degree day.

I love this recipe. I've made it twice following the recipe exactly (I thought). The first time I mistakenly used the egg whites instead of the egg yolks but it was still good. Next time, I'm going to try using 5 eggs instead of 10 egg yolks.

I double the recipe for a traditional ice cream freezer.
I do not strain the lemon zest.

I also want to try with lime juice, with mint and with ginger.

Great for a refreshing summer treat!!

Perhaps my favorite ice cream these days. Wonderful recipe as written,  though I typically use whole milk in lieu of the h&h (only because I'm rather stingy with my h&h & it's $$ in our little town) and 2-3 egg yolks rather than 5.  The ice cream is still creamy and wonderfully delicious with these changes.

DH said this was the single best thing he's ever put in his mouth!   I used two lemons and one lime, all large, which yielded 1 C of juice...and I used every drop.    After cooking the custard, I left the zest in and let it continue steeping overnight in the fridge, then stirred in the juice and strained it into my Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker, which is the standard 1.5 quart size.   I don't know why the recipe (as written for ten servings) instructs us to use a 4-5 quart ice cream freezer.

Holy $@@&! Batman, this stuff is GOOD. This was my first time using my new ice cream maker. The recipe was a bit of work to be sure, but nothing so difficult or time consuming that I wouldn't make it again. If you love lemon, you MUST try this.

Tart Lemon Lovers... you NEED to make this ice cream!

This is the BEST ice cream I have ever had. Summer and lemons are the perfect pair - add ice cream to the mix and it's a triple win! This recipe will not disappoint if you like a tart lemon flavor.

I researched other recipes online and after landing on this one, and reading several helpful reviews (thank you fellow reviewers!), I made a few slight modifications;
* I added more lemon zest - about 5 tablespoons
* Steeped for 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes to bring out the lemon zest
* Added about 1/8 tsp of salt during the cooking process
* Strained through a fine mess sieve before refrigerating the base for extra creamy texture
* Added nearly one cup of lemon juice (instead of 3/4 cup) prior to putting in the ice cream maker.
* Next time I'm trying Limoncello (subbing 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice). Has anyone tried adding a tiny bit of lavender to the base during the cooking phase, then straining out? 

Other things I did to follow the recipe (and probably why it turned out so amazing!); 
* Refrigerated the base overnight
* Used really fresh lemons and zest
* Made sure the freezer bowl was rock hard frozen
* I have a Cuisinart ice cream maker and it says to pour in the base and churn for 25 - 30 minutes. After 15 minutes it was the perfect soft-serve consistency with no crystallization around the inside of the freezer bowl. So I stopped churning at 15 minutes, poured into a container and put in the freezer. The next

This was my first time making a custard based ice cream. Super easy recipe, very lemony, very delicious. I made it for Easter and everyone raved about it (21 people). The batch was devoured!  Followed the receipt and didn't make any substitutes. A must try.

I played with the amount of milk to cream ratio, playing down the cream. Nevertheless, it netted a  stellar result. This was    dessert made using homegrown Lisbon lemons as  the base. YUM! Kudos to the author.

I made the recipe almost as written. Just strained out zest  prior to adding the lemon juice.  Absolutely wonderful.   Will be one of my top 3 ice cream recipes. Served with blueberries and shortbread cookies.

Flavor very good.  Unfortunately because of the high fat content, my electric ice-cream maker started turning it to butter after half an hour of churning. I think I'll try reversing the amounts of half and half and heavy cream!

This is not only the best ice cream I have ever made, it is one of the best ice creams I have ever eaten! Delicious!  I love lemon and this had the perfect amount of tart and sweet lemon flavor.  It was wonderfully creamy and had the right "mouth feel".  I followed the recipe exactly, except I strained out the zest before cooling and prior to adding the zest to the cream mixture, added some sugar and let it sit for a few minutes to help draw out more of the oils and flavor.  Not sure if that made any difference but it was amazing ice cream.  I also only had 1/2 c fresh lemon juice, so the remainder was bottled.  I will definitely be making this again....and again....and again!!!

This lemon ice cream was wonderful! I love the flavor of lemon but not so much the tartness (just a personal preference), so I only used 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice. The result was an ice cream that was smooth, flavorful, and refreshing. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!

This is the BEST ice cream recipe I ever encountered. It is super smooth, lemony and just overall delicious. No modification was necessary. Also made a strawberry version using the same base with added 1/3 cup of strawberry puree when letting the base sit in the fridge overnight and substituting the 3/4 cup of lemon juice with chopped strawberries when churning in the ice cream maker. This was also fantastic. For strawberry version, a little less sugar and lemon zest would have been better though since strawberries are naturally sweeter than lemon. I have already made several batches of the lemon ice cream. One friend was inspired to go ahead and buy an ice cream maker after tasting it, and other are looking to buy now.

I just made the ice cream and it came out great!  I did, however, put only 1/2 cup of lemon juice in. The taste is perfect.  I felt it had enough lemon taste.  I also strained the mixture.  I am a pastry chef,  and that is how we did it in the restaurants.  I also suggest to put it in an ice bath, before you put in the refrigerator. When the mixture was cool, I then put in lemon zest.  I may experiment and put some lavender in it next time, if I can find.  Hard in SC.  I did find a recipe where they put chopped candied lemon peel in the ice cream. That maybe something to try.

I have always been partial to frozen lemon custard, and this recipe hits the spot exactly! I don't mind the lemon zest at all, but others who tried my recipe weren't so keen on it even though they snarfed down my first batch without hesitation. Needed to make a second batch and hide it in the deep freeze. Hands down, the best recipe for ice cream I have made to-date.  This is a keeper, and I'm not changing a thing. Now all I need to do is buy a bigger ice cream freezer to make double batches.

WAY too lemon-y! Tastes more like sorbet than ice cream! Consistency is great and looks like ice cream but the flavor is way too intense and off-putting. I did as other reviewers had suggested straining the lemon zest and reducing lemon juice from 3/4 cup to 1/2 and it was still too lemon-y.

Absolutely delicious.  I used semi-skimmed milk instead of the half and half cream, otherwse kept to the recipe.  Lemon zest was very finely grated and kept in the mix and it is fine in the resulting ice cream. Can't see any of my children having a problem with it.  Looking forward to serving this with ginger snap baskets or with hot ginger sponge puddings. Think it will go down exceptionally well.

Delicious.  I love lemon ice cream and this hit the spot.  I didn't strain out the zest, though most of it seemed to get caught on my ice cream churn paddle, so not much ended up in the ice cream I ate, but I didn't mind the bit that did at all.  Will be making again!

I had gotten an ice cream maker and lots of lemons around Christmas, and thought I would try this recipe even though I am more of a Chocolate person. I loved it and everyone including those who weren't into lemons loved this recipe.  It is a keeper.

I picked this recipe for my first try with my new Ice Cream maker.  I had some lemon basil in my herb garden and added a 2-3 T. chopped with the rind.  I used 2 c half and half and one cup heavy cream.  Still plenty creamy and rich.  It was the most wonderful ice cream!  My kids and neighbors LOVED it.

Hi I work in a restaurant kitchen and wanted to use up some lemons I had!  Modified the recipe to use in a commercial ice cream machine by mixing lemon juice w/ egg yolks, combining w/ cream, and pouring in the machine.  Awesome recipe.  Very refreshing and light.  Is now on our menu.  5 stars

I was sure it'd be too sour. I hate lemons! But my auntie Ruthi asked for lemon ice cream for her 85th birthday, so I tried it. I did strain the mixture before refrigerating, and I covered it while it was in the fridge, but besides that I followed the recipe exactly. It still seemed too sour when I pulled it out of the ice-cream machine, but once it was in the freezer even I loved it. My mother who never eats more that two scoops of any ice cream ate three bowls. It was such a huge success that apparently I'm now required to make this every holiday for the whole family!

A great lemony ice cream.  I followed everything exactly except that I strained the cream/egg/zest mixture through a fine mesh before storing it in the fridge overnight to remove the zest and give the ice cream a very smooth texture.  The only thing I may do different next time is add a tiny bit of vanilla and potentially subtract an egg yolk.  But overall an excellent blend of creamy, sweet and tang.  I love it!
