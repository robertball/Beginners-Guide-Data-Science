I'm giving this recipe 4 stars for taste.  However, it turned out a bit like chocolate mousse instead of frosting.  I have to admit it was humid here today and they may have been some of the problem.  I would definitely triple the recipe for a filled 9x9. Also, make sure to use a GOOD BRAND of chocolate...that is what will make or break this recipe!

This frosting was great on the "Double Yummie Yellow Cake"; next time, I'll double the recipe so there'll be enough to cover an entire two layer cake.

Great frosting for brownes.  I had no problems with the recipe. I would have liked it to make a little more frosting then it did for one layer.  If I use this for a two layer cake I more than likely will triple it.

This is very runny, but after cooking I find that if you put in the fridge for 1/2 hour, then take out and use electric mixer it is thick, creamy and won't run off the cake, I have made flowers, it is incredible, same texture as regular buttercream frosting

I followed the directions to the letter, but the frosting was still very runny and ran off the sides of the cake.  It tasted good though.
