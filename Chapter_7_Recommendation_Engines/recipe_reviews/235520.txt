I liked the sound of these so I whipped some up the night before to keep in the fridge.  Loved how easy they were to do in the blender.  They smelled so good cooking....however, I don't know what I did wrong.  Maybe it's because I refrigerated the batter?  Or used canned sweet potato instead of pumpkin? They did NOT turn out well.  They were bland, gummy, way too dense--not fluffy or a pancake consistency at all.

Do not refrigerate these. The oats will get soggy and turn to mush instead of flour like. They were good, and healthy.

These pancakes were delicious. And Yes, the person with a 1-star rating should not have let the oats get soggy in the fridge. The pumpkin adds so much nutritional value. These are so healthy!
