Let me know if any substitutions work! This recipe itself is an adaptation of a scone recipe I was given :)

I had some fresh cranberries hanging around so I was looking for a recipe to use them.  First off, note that this recipe has a discrepancy with the amount of vanilla. It says 1 tsp above but then talks about adding 1 tablespoon at a time. Don't let that scare your off.  I used 3 tablespoons of vanilla, adding it to the dry ingredients - it came perfect so I would say add vanilla to your taste. Also, I used fresh cranberries, white chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips. I also used 2% milk because that's what I had. I don't press down on my scones before baking because I like that rustic look. Try this recipes, it is wonderful and flexible. Thank you for sharing it KLang436!

I used 2% Milk, and only used a quarter of a bag of mini chocolate chips. It actually proportioned out well in the mix, I did it all by hand and was a little discouraged when my mix didn't look like bread crumbs at one point but i pushed through and they came out amazing! Very tasty, not to dry, came out great!

These scones were rich and dry, exactly the way I like them! In order to make them vegan, I used coconut oil instead of butter, and I used vegan mini chocolate chips.
