This was pretty easy and very tasty. I was afraid that my husband wasn't going to like it, so I made a few modifications. Instead of the Four Cheese sauce, I used Garlic and Herb and I also seasoned the ground beef a bit. Overall, this was an easy recipe to follow and I got some good feedback.

Great!  I mixed the pasta and sauce together before I layered.

Very simple.  I prefer a little garlic and onion with the meat, and ricotta cheese.  I also think it is better to mix pasta with sauce to prevent pasta from becoming dried out in spots.

This was super easy to make. I think I may have tripled the pasta requirements, but I thought it needed it. I didn't think there would be enough of the meat mixture, but there definitely was. My children even enjoyed this, and they hardly eat anything.

Simple enough... for me to screw up.  LOL!  Seriously though, what I did wrong was NOT cook the pasta.  Not a biggie really since this is how I make my lasagna.  I usually rinse out the sauce jar and add that water to the casserole and it comes out perfectly.  Takes longer to bake but on this day I had the time.
Fewer dirty dishes, quicker prep time.  I used a bit more mozz and added garlic powder and parmesan.  I also used a spaghetti sauce of personal choice and a store brand tomato paste.
Next time I would be inclined to add a couple cloves of fresh garlic and maybe a 1/4 lb of sweet or mild Italian sausage, ricotta cheese mixed with egg and a can of stewed tomatoes.  :-9

Made 5/7/2015 with veggie italian sausage instead of beef and regular pasta instead of 4 cheese. All of us enjoyed.
