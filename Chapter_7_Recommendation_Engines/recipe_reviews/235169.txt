Made as written and I really like the flavor the beer gave this. My only complaint is that it came out a little dry compared to my go to recipe. I think it would better slow cooked in a crockpot with an additional beer.

Making tonight but added two table spoons chili power seasoning and one and a half table spoons brown sugar. Browned all sides and used hard apple cider beer. Can't wait to eat!

we liked the flavor of the beer, but felt it needed more spice, it was bland. Also, suggest it be cooked much longer and at a lower temp
