I used regular baking potatoes and cut into pieces. Also did not have red onion, so sliced regular white onion. Roasted in the oven(took longer than 22 minutes, actually about 45 minutes) Used the blu cheese dressing I had and forgot to sprinkle with parsely or chives. No extra blu cheese crumbles either, but will make sure I have them next time. They were fabulous and different. Will make again for sure!

The cooking time is way off.  People thinking this will be done in 22 minutes will end up with an undercooked dish.  Listen to the first reviewer expect to double the cooking time.

Very good. Did double the cooking time. Used 2 medium sized yellow onions. I also sprinkled Italian seasoning on the mixture. Will certainly make again.

I may have cut my potatoes up too small because I thought they were a bit too soft.  I also cooked them twice as long as  the recommended time.  All the flavors mixed together were fabulous!  I used yellow onion instead of red and it was great.  The crumbled blue cheese is a very nice addition to the recipe.

I used regular sized potatoes cut into french fry-sized pieces and roasted a bit longer, as suggested by others.  Also, I used my homemade blue cheese dressing (blue cheese crumbles, yoghurt, seasonings).  They were altogether wonderful.  

I gave four stars instead of 5 because I dislike using processed food, as called for in the recipe.

Very good. I used crumbled gonzola cheese instead of blue cheese over the top at the end it was just as good

I really liked this recipe.  I probably shouldn't rate it as I didn't use the specific ingrediants but it just goes to show that the recipe is versatile.  I used plain potatoes and white onion.  It was perfect as the rest of my family are not fan's of blue cheese, I was able to to add the dressing to only mine they they were happy with the roasted potatoes and onion.  Will definitely make it again.

My review is probably not 100% fair because I left out the onions and parsley and chives, because I was looking for a recipe just to use up some fingerling potatoes I had and roasting them then adding the blue cheese was just wonderful!!  Will try again making the recipe as written, I'm sure it would be fabulous!

These were AWESOME (and very rich, lol)!I used regular idaho potatoes that I cut into larger chunks, and vidalia onion because I had no red on hand. Marzetti(R) Ultimate Blue Cheese Dressing is the only blue cheese dressing that I buy, so I did have that on hand. These did take longer to roast, as others have said...more like 40-45 mins., but I planned for that, knowing that there was no way that the potatoes would be cooked in 17-22 mins. The whole family gobbled these up! I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved these potatoes!!!!  Very easy dish to make.  I used regular sized red potatoes and cut them into smaller chunks.  For added flavor I sprinkled them with McCormick's Perfect Pinch Parmesan Herb seasoning.  Baking time was about 40 minutes I and topped them with Marzetti's chunky blue cheese dressing.  Very good recipe and will definitely make these again!

We really enjoyed this potato recipe.  Bleu Cheese is a favorite of mine, so after roasting the potatoes for 38 minutes I split the recipe.  Half of the potatoes were made as written, the other half had feta cheese with Ranch dressing for my husband.  I know oven times vary, but I had to add an additional 15 minutes to the baking time.  Not a problem for my dinner that night, but could have been.  Potaotes had great flavor, and I would make these again.

Loved this recipe! Very easy to put together and a great combination of flavors. You will need to add about 15 minutes to the baking time.
