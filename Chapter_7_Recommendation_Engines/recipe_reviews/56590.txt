To anyone who will be making my recipe for nut bread, please make sure you mix everything by hand. Using a mixer will change the texture of the bread and it will not turn out as good. Also something I always do is wait a couple minutes after you take the loaves out of the oven and wrap in aluminum foil. This will keep them moist.  My family always eats it with butter on it. Enjoy!  :0) Also bake it for 45 minutes and test it to see if it needs to bake a little longer. Everyones oven is different.

Yummy! I followed the instructions exactly and I didn't have any trouble with it being too dense. I just made sure I kept the stirring to a minimum and they turned out wonderfully. I'm so glad it made two loaves so I could share!

I really liked it.  I printed the recipe months' ago so I just now saw the note about mixing by hand.  I made one loaf using a mixer being careful not to mix too much.  I liked the taste and texture.  Next time I'm going to try adding a streusel topping.

My family really enjoyed this nut bread. The recipe will go in my keep box and be made over and over. It is great to make for gifts also. Thank you for sharing. It tastes great.

I tried this recipe with great hopes...and was very disapointed!  The flavor is good, very sweet and mild, but the texture was very dense and hard.  I DID  NOT overmix, and I used a wooden spoon, not my mixer, when mixing.  Nevertheless, the loaves were very pale and did not brown at all  on top, and they are so heavy and dense I could build a house with them!  What a waste of a cup of nuts...

I had no problems with prep or the quality of the bread, it was just very bland. I guess I'm used to quick breads with more ingredients (fruit, chocolate, etc.) in them.

Good old fashioned dense nut bread! Lost my motherinlaws recipe, and I think this is it! Yummmmm! Making my second batch, adding more nuts this time, but not because it wasn't incredible the first batch (my hubby just likes more nuts) . Thanks for sharing this! ( note: this is not like nutbreads from the store , this has an old fashioned texture....try it!  Butter is great on it.)

This comes together very quickly, and the flavor is pretty good---maybe a little bland for our tastes.  I'm thinking that slathered with butter after toasting will make a difference!  My oven is calibrated correctly, and I do think I should have taken this out at 45 minutes.  As it was, I took it out at 50 minutes and it was already dry even though I mixed everything by hand.  EDIT:  This edit from a 3 to a 5 comes the next day from making the bread.  My family all loved the bread, and I must admit that the flavors are much better the second day.   Toasted with butter made a lot of difference, and there is no way that I can overpower the votes of family members!  :)

Wooden spoons are especially useful when stirring on a non-stick surface. Metal spoons can scratch nonstick coatings, while smooth wooden spoons will not harm non-stick surfaces. Even when stirring in a regular pot, metal spoons can leave scratches, and they make a scraping noise that can become bothersome over time. Again, wooden spoons to the rescue. They won’t scratch your copper, aluminum or stainless steel pots and are nice and quiet to use.

Yummy. Tried not to mix to much as what others comments. I did use a mixer (hand issues). I did use plain yogurt no BM,coconut oil for oil, pumpkin spice (out vanilla), also added orange juice (1tbsp) and zest and dried cranberries. Anyway will try again

I followed the recipe exactly (except I used two cups of nuts and reduced fat buttermilk because the store was out of whole ) and the bread came out perfect. Moist and delicious!

I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups, and ground the nuts in my blender before adding because the kids don't like lumpy nuts.  It was delicious, everyone liked it!
