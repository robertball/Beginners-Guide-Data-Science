cut the lemon juice in half (or use red wine vinegar) - it's too lemony otherwise. I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp seasoning salt and managed to salvage the first batch.

I agree with Lalli, I have researched many combinations and 2 Tsp is consistent with her recommendation. 
Suggestion: for a healthier substitute, use light olive oil, walnut or avocado. My family really likes walnut oil, but it is hard on the blender. You need to invest in sturdy equipment. Blender, food processor, or blender can be used.

Look out! Too much lemon! 2 Tbsp is more than enough. Really don't understand the point of the paprika, if you want white mayo, don't use it.

I was excited about this recipe until I got to the part about refrigerating for up to 3 days. Only way to use 2+ cups of mayo would be to make 2 cakes and 10 sandwiches.

I make half of this.  It keeps for a couple of weeks.  The trick to getting a nice thick spread is the speed of the pour.  You want a thin stream. The  runny messes i had i turned into salad dressing by adding garlic and herbs or powdered hidden valley ranch mix.  It does take practice.  I did find online what to do if it turns out runny.  Google is my friend.

I did not like this dressing. The taste of it made my stomach literally roll.

I guess I must be doing something wrong.  I tried to make this recipe twice and each time just ended up with an egg colored oily mess.  It would not emulsify into mayonnaise.  I tried first with a stick blender in a cup, then a Kitchenaid Blender. I followed the directions both times, slowly adding the oil.  Still made just an egg yolk colored greasy mess.  I only gave this one star because it is apparently my fault that the recipe did not work, nothing against the recipe. I hated wasting all those ingredients though.

I was surprised how easy it was to make. My wife usually makes our own mayo, so I found this recipe that sounded simple enough for my first try.  I varied it slightly, using two yolks instead, remnants from another dish I had just prepared,  rather than just one whole egg.  I also added some Siriachi sauce to taste.  I didnâ€™t bother to measure out the oil, but rather just watched until I felt that I had reached the right consistency.  I used a mini food processor to mix it all together and trickled the smallest steady stream of oil into the previously added ingredients until the consistency was just right.

I just made this and it turned out fabulous! I used a stick blender and a quart jar, just tossed all ingredients in the jar and in a couple of minutes I had fresh mayo. Now I did add garlic powder after blending and a bit more lemon over what others suggested as I like lemon flavor, I just used a whisk to add the extra ingredients. I used this mayo to make chicken salad and it turned out great! Don't be afraid to add your own flavors to, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

guess I should have read the reviews first.  way too much lemon juice now I have to figure out how to salvage it. It also did not thicken up well I don't know if I didn't blend long enough or over blended or what the problem was but  I think I will add some seasonings to fake it into ranch dressing

I made this with EVOO.  The end product is yellowish, very runny and off flavored.

I needed to make my husband a tuna sandwich, but realized I had no mayo, so, of course, I turned to all recipes for a quick blender mayo.
This was the only recipe I saw but the reviews pointed out some recipe flaws.... so this is how I repaired the problem.  
First I soaked the eggs, pasture raised,  in some warm water, not hot, to warm them to room temp.  This is key! Cold ingredients won't emulsify.  Then I used 2 T of Champagne vinegar.  Its kinda mild compared to lemon juice or red wine vinegar.  I added 1/2 teaspoon pink salt and a pinch each of garlic and onion powder.  Also, and this is key, I added 1 teaspoon or so of dijon mustard.  So I blended everything except oil in my BlendTec blender. till creamy.  Since this was a spur of the moment thing, I only had about 3/4 c EVOO so I added the rest in pure Olive oil. I must say I was concerned the taste would be too strong, but thats what I had at the time. I had some grapeseed oil but it was past its prime to that hit the trash.
So, I began adding the oil in a THIN stream till the blender stopped.  It was just too thick.  So, I added 1/2 cup of warm water in three batches till all the oil was added.
It was great! It was thinner than B*** F***s but perfect for blender mayo.  Check out my photo to see the results.  Very creamy, a little yellow, with flecks of pepper.  Herbs would be nice too for something special. (It's in a white crock in front of my blender on granite counter.)

I was very disappointed in this recipe.
