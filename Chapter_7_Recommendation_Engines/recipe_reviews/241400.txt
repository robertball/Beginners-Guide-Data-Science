I made these cookies for a bake sale. Unfortunately the chocolate seized on me when I was melting. I had some vanilla melts so I used them as a coating instead. They were good, but I likely won't make them again.

If I make this and the peanut butter haystacks again, I will definitely wear gloves!  And I would buy a dipping fork.
