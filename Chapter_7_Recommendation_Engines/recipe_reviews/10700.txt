Being a patissier who was interested by the absolute simplicity of the recipe I gave it a whirl, and after the first few came out of the oven, tried to make a few sensible corrections in order to see if the recipe could be altered for improvement.  In the end, it's just not a very good recipe.  Made as is, these cookies are dry and floury tasting.  For the sort of texture you end up with, you'd be better off flavour-wise by going for a variation on shortbread with citrus.

I added about 1/2 t each of vanilla and baking powder and did not let the batter rest out of impatience. They turned out quite well-very tender and light.

Although this cookie was very easy and tasty, I was looking for a crispier, thinner cookie.  Probably won't make it again.

I liked this recipe. I tweeked it a little by adding a tad more sugar and some almond extract. I also made a lemon glaze for the top. Yum!

Loved this cookie. Not too sweet. Just right tartness. When I refrigerated it, I put it in a gallon size zip loc bag and made it into a roll and then sliced it like a refrigerator cookie.

My daughter made these, using oat flour and sucanat.  As is ussually the case with oat flour cookies, they got very flat.  However they tasted pretty good, but I think they would be better with a little salt.
