This was so easy and delicious.Everyone loved it.  I made the strawberry version exactly as written but will make again with mangoes since they are plentiful right now.

This pie was AMAZINGLY good.  SO easy to make. I used frozen strawberries and crushed them and used fresh sliced strawberries as well.   I will definitely make it again as is and using different flavors for different people.

UPDATE:  I made this again for my husbands b-day but I made in chocolate.  I used 8oz of whipped cream cheese to make it easier to blend. Instead of strawberries I used fudge syrup, mixed in white chocolate chips, Spanish peanuts and chopped up Snickers. Then added more chopped Snickers and cherries on the top.  SO GOOD!!! (And still easy.)

This recipe is very easy & my Honey loves it! I did make a few changes to the recipe. 
I only added 1 8oz container of Cool Whip and I added a 1/2 cup of mashed strawberries to the mixture before folding in the strawberries.

This was soooo easy and everyone loved it!!  I did make one change ONLY because I thought it wouldn't be strawberry flavored enough when I was mixing it up.  I sprinkled about half a package of strawberry Kool-Aid in it and mixed it up real good.  It gave it the pink color and I suppose a little boost of flavor.  I may not have needed it, but since it was the first time and I didn't get to read others reviews, I tried it.
