This recipe was very disappointing. The consistency of the dough was very sticky and could not be rolled into logs like the recipe suggested - not even after chilling it for hours. I ended up just dropping the dough by spoonfuls (a horrible process with the sticky dough) onto cookie sheets. Though they rose perfectly turned a perfect golden color and are nice and soft they taste nothing at all like the promised "toffee"! (The most distinct flavor I can pick out when eating them is SALT!)

Today my local paper published a letter from Heloise declaring a "swan song" for this recipe. Reason? There doesn't seem to be any way to control their consistency. I agree but I will continue to make them once a month because they are so yummy...
