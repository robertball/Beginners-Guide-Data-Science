This was really delicious. My only change was using dried herbs as I didn't have fresh at home. I made half of this thicker.. just rolling out like a pie crust and half thin, rolling out on the foil. They tasted great both ways. I baked the thicker ones 25 minutes

It just didn't work. I think there was too much butter and the cornmeal was over powering and it could not be rolled out and even under plastic wrap, it was like I was rolling out just butter.
