We both really liked this salad which was just a little different from others.  I took a couple of shortcuts that got this good to go in no time.  Canned sliced beets shaved off a lot of time and effort.  And my wife and cooking partner prepared our favorite lemon vinaigrette which I drizzled over the salads just before serving.  Finally, I darn near pass out at the sight of feta cheese so bocconcini (little balls of fresh mozzarella) filled in nicely, and contributed a certain balance and mellowness to the salad. A delicious, attractive and different alternative to the ho-hum tossed green salad.

I had never cooked with beets prior to making this salad, and although preparing them is labour-intensive, it is well worth the effort.  When I first made this salad, I didn't bother reserving any of the lemon dressing, and simply tossed all of the dressing with all of the beets.  The salad tasted quite "lemony", but very good.

It was when I made a second salad the next day, using the "marinated" beets, that I absolutely feel in love with this recipe.  The flavours, having had time to blend together, were absolutely wonderful.  My friend who I served the salad to (Day #2 version) said it was "the best".

This recipe is just excellent, I will be making it again very soon!

I wanted to try this but didn't have arugula on hand, so I used mixed field greens. I followed some of Spunky Buddy's tips and used canned beets which worked great. I also made a lemon vinaigrette and added fresh minced garlic. The flavors all came together for a wonderful dinner salad. Thanks Vegetarian, for the recipe!

Love it! I use less arugula and make it more about the beets.

Liked it a lot as is. Had to use canned beets and spinach that I had on hand. Second try I added some onion and toasted walnuts for crunch. Next I will add some celery, too. Thanks for recipe.

This was a very tasty salad--my daughter and I made it with our first grilled steak of  the season and was a great complement to the meal!  I would cut back on the salt due to the lemon juice in the recipe.  Thanks for a great salad recipe!

This salad is so delicious! The Inquisitive Vegetarian has been my go to for a very long time.  The flavors in the recipes are so well thought out.  I would highly recommend this recipe and urge you to try her other recipes too!  You won't be disappointed.
