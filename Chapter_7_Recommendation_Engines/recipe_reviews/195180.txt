OK, I hate to be the first to review this when I altered the recipe somewhat; but it was SO GOOD that I had to share.  I cut the pork into medallions then pounded thin, then sprinkled the meat with the cumin and garlic pepper.  I made the glaze in a bowl; but didn't have orange juice on hand, so I used triple sec (orange liqueur). I melted the pepper jelly in the microwave before adding the other ingredients to make it easier to stir.  My pepper jelly didn't quite have the kick I was looking for so I added a dab of chili garlic sauce to spice it up.  I doubled the glaze and used half of it to marinate the pork medallions for 2 hours before grilling (instead of frying).  I poured the other half of glaze (after heating in the microwave) over the grilled pork before serving. Fantastic!! The glaze has a wonderful flavor... I highly recommend it.

This was good but the sauce was too thin.  I added some cornstarch to thicken it up.

This was so GOOD and Quick.  I used a dried garlic and chile blend I had for the "garlic pepper seasoning" and everything else I followed to the letter.  Cook time after the initial browning was about 12 minutes.

This is a really great recipe.  However if you are expecting it to be spicy, I suggest adding some cayenne or a fresh jalapeno or two.  I do plan to make it again, my family loved it, just wanted a little more kick to it.

I have to agree that the sauce for this is too thin - so I also added cornstarch. I made this recipe with homemade jalepeno jam that I'd been given. Very tasty, thanks!

I tried this recipe using medium thickness boneless pork chops because I had them on hand. Everything else was prepared as directed. The spices and glaze were all very tasty together, so much so that the flavor of the pork didn't come through at all. Next time I try this recipe I'll use an extra thick cut of meat.
