"Grandmaw Cain" sure has a great recipe - kept to the recipe w/o any changes.  Thinking next time I'll season the flour w/ some garlic powder, and seasoning salt.

I cut the water back by a quarter cup and replaced it with red wine. I made no other changes. I did not try this myself but the husband and kids told me they liked it. They must have, they ate every single bite of it.

I was looking for a way to use beef stew meat other than in stew or stroganoff and came across this recipe. It was pretty easy and good enough. My problem was the meat didn't quite get the chance to cook long enough to be tender. It wasn't terribly chewy but not quite the way the way I like it to turn out. Will make this again however, if I can figure out a way around that one small chewy problem.

LOVED the idea.  I didnt use the pre-made rice packets at all.  I had some stew meat and it was too hot out to make a stew..rice is always light and easy.  I DID sub one cup water with a cup merlot. Makes all the diff in the WORLD.  Coudlnt even tell you the measurments...but seasoned the flour for the meat with garlic salt and lemon pepper, then let the butter and oil simmer for a bit with Safron, Thyme, Rosemary (my fave) and a Ginger Seasame seasoning. It was an absolute throw together that doesnt even really belong on this board...but thought the OP deserved the post because she gave me the idea to begin with, but my family loved it so  much-they request it TOO often.  It has now become a Hill family traditional thing that only I can make because I NEVER DO right it down! HA. I give BIG PROPS to the OP because although I didnt follow the original recipie by any stretch of the imagination, I would have never thought to use the stew meat in this fashion w/ the rice! I've done this with stew meat with noodles hundreds of times.  Funny how our minds get stuck in a rut and thats where they follow....guess thats why Im not on Food Network. HA.  I STILL THINK PIE STYLE SHOULD HAVE WON AND PAULA SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN FIRED! THAT WAS SOME DIRTY WORK THERE!!!!

Seasoned the flour with garlic, salt and pepper.  Added onion.  I used a packet of McCormick brown gravy since I used plain wild and brown rice that did not have seasoning packet. Also added one can of Cream of Mushroom soup. Turned out great!

Really yummy... made almost exactly as directed, except cut in half. The only change I made was adding pepper to the flour before browning the meat. It was like a meaty rice pilaf. Served with asparagus. This is definitely going in my rotation.

No matter how we make it, we just don't care for beef tips unless they are in stew.

Did as some others suggested and cut the beef smaller and added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and ground pepper to the flour, and added a bit of Better Than Boullion to the water. We loved this. Thank you.

Very good - a few adaptations - I used beef broth instead of the water & cooked up fresh morels & added them at the end of the cook time. I used Uncle Ben's wild rice & it was delicious!!!

My family liked this recipe.  I did not have mushrooms so I used onions and I substituted regular rice and used the beef broth as others suggested. I was surprised the meat was actually pretty tender not as tender as slow cooking in a slow cooker but it wasn't tough. I think I will make it again it was a nice change from regular stew.

Amazing!!! Of course I did add some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour, but it is amazing!!! I made more than what the recipe called for, and trust me when I say there is hardly any left... Especially with teenage boys!! Totally recommend it!!

Next time I make this I will add some seasonings to the meat. It was kinda bland. Not what I was expecting.

Husband and I both enjoyed this.  I agree with the reviewer who said she would season the flour next time--just my preference.  I cut the stew meat at least in half to make it more tender.  When it was done cooking, I added some salt and beef bouillon for a little more flavor.
