I prepared this recipe exactly as written. I like the spicy bite which probably comes from the cayenne pepper. I also appreciate that it is a low-fat, heart healthy recipe. I cooked the ground turkey/vegetable/spice mixture in a wok. The only problem is that the final product came out too dry. Though I can't say definitively how much, I will consider adding more tomato juice, or tomato soup to prevent the casserole from being too dry next time.  With that fix, this dish could easily move from three to four stars.
