Tasty! I followed the recipe exactly with the BC cookie mix and everything. However the filling was a tiny bit too much so if I were to make it again I would use 3 cups sugar. Also, the chocolate on top ended up a little thin and hard to spread, so I would use 18 oz. (1 1/2 bgs) of chocolate  and 3/4 cup butter. Still... they were sooo good.
