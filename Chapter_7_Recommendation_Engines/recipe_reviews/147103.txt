This is my recipe, and it states 1/4 cup of green onion, but my recipe is only about 2tbs or to your preference. Oh and its a simple recipe, open to add any other things you would like to it if you are a veggie lover.  Hope you like

Very good!  I subbed pickels for the green onion and used dijon mustard.  I liked the addition of paprika.  Served it on a bun with lettuce, tomato, and a few more pickle planks.  Thanks Wifey!!

Wonderful recipe starting with a good base that is great "as is" or with additions.  The ratio of egg/mayo/mustard are perfect in this.  I have had this twice.  The first try was just as the recipe states and the second time I added a little celery and dill.  Both times were very good!  I will be making this again! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

My Mother taught me the secret to great egg salad is to mix the cold mayo with the still hot yolks.  This makes a much creamier base to add the rest of the ingredients to.

My original plan was for an egg salad recipe I had chosen that was a little fussier than this.  However, after an earlier experience today with a recipe with a more "complicated flavor," I decided to play it safe and go on the basic side with this recipe instead.  It IS delicious, taking me back to earlier days and a simpler style of cooking. (For me that would mean waaaay back in the day :)  I mean, didn't everyone's mom make egg salad just like this?  This is good just as is, but you can doll it up any way you like.  For me, that meant adding celery, because for us it just isn't egg salad without it.  But in the end, this is an egg salad recipe for what it is -  a good, basic, classic, egg salad, and not for all the fussier things it isn't.

Perfect...... after some tweaking.  I hate when people drastically change recipes, but I couldnt find anything on here with all the KEY ingredients for great egg salad.  This recipe had a great start.  I just added some finely diced celery for crunch, 1 tsp dill weed (gotta have dill in your egg salad sandwich), 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of the green onions (didnt have any on hand) and used dijon mustard for a little more flavor.  Turned out great, I ate half of it before it even made it to the fridge for lunch the next day.

it was ok.  i would consider it a base recipe.  my egg salad was begging for additions, i.e., celery, red bell peppers, or anything with more flavor and color

Update: left in the frig for a bit, but I wouldn't suggest this because it got very runny. It was best when I first mixed it up. Still, a great egg salad/spread! I am going to use the filling for deviled eggs for Father's Day. Original review: I wanted a cold salad/spread for sandwiches for lunch today. I chose this one, and my husband said it tasted like his grandmother's egg salad, which is high praise indeed! Thanks for the post!

Good basic recipe (which is what I was looking for).  I left out the onion on personal preference.  I added a tiny bit of pickle juice to give it some oomph, next time I think I'll add more.

To heck with dicing the eggs by hand (it takes FOREVER), I used my Pampered Chef chopper.  Took just minutes to chop up all the eggs!

For perfect hard-cooked eggs, the Broiler & Egg Association of Minnesota says to place eggs in single layer in covered saucepan in cold water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let stand for 15 minutes.  Once the time has elapsed, place eggs in ice water until cool.  This works beautifully - the eggs are done to perfection, there's no green edges, and they peeled quite easily, no tearing!

What can you say about a basic Egg Salad recipe... you like it or you don't! This is the way I have made mine, forever, except I add very finely sliced celery because I like a little crunch. I read all the reviews and some say it's bland but that's a matter of taste. Not everyone likes highly seasoned food and for those who do, you can easily spice it up to suit your taste. Personal preference, as far as seasonings go, should never be a reason to down rate a recipe.

I use 3-4 oz of cream cheese and 2 tbsp of mayo instead of just mayo. Doesn't get runny and the taste/texture is better.

I love this with lettuce on sandwiches. (I don't care for paprika so I left it out) You could also add some curry powder to make it very different.

I am also hopping on the "gotta use up easter eggs" bandwagon with this recipe. I love egg salad sandwiches, and this recipe is pretty good, except being a huge fan of dried dill weed, I had to add a generous amount (a little over a tablespoon's worth) to my mixture. I also omitted the salt and pepper. Thanks wifeyluvs2cook.

This recipe is a prime example of how the most basic ingredients can make something filling and comforting. I cut this in half, added one rib of chopped celery (I like crunch in my egg salad) and use dijon. I ate this on potato bread. So good.

Great basic recipe. A tip: peel the eggs immediately (the shells come off more easily then).  I added curry powder (always a "must-have ingredient" for egg salad in our house), and I went lighter on the scallions. I also added a bit of tumeric, which heightens the yellow color and adds a valuable nutrient. (Tumeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and an anti-carcinogenic).

This is a good base recipe! I liked the mustard in it. I always like to dress up egg salad, so with this recipe I put it in Garlic with Olive Oil pita bread with some lettuce. THX, it's a keeper!

HIGHLY recommend finding a different cook time.  All I did was ruin 8 eggs cooking them this way.  I usually just rolling boil them for 5 minutes, and let them sit for another 10 but I decided to follow the recipe.  

Boil them as usual if you have a way that works.

Great base recipe.  Go w/ low fat mayo or my pref fat free miracle whip (I like MW better).  A bit of garlic salt & pepper in the finish.  Extra onion, use spicy mustard, I might try spicy paprika next time.  I also like the addition of some diced red/green peppers in the mix.

Absolutely spot on! Made as directed.  used Dijon because I thought that was a given. Does not make as much as you would think. Like my sandwiches full. I would say two, three at best. Perfect for bridal/ baby shower. But you will need to quadruple recipe at least. Would be great paired with the cucumber dill recipe here as choices on a tray.

Yum, great "base recipe" for egg salad. I used 10 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 teaspoons mustard, 1/4 cup relish, and two stalks of celery (finely chopped). I didn't use salt and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper. Once on the bread, I sprinkled with paprika. Yum, yum, yum!

this was a fairly delish recipe. I made soo many boiled eggs for Superbow Sunday...I didn't want not one bite to go to waste or just to be deviled eggs. I found this recipe and quickly put it all together rather fast. I didn't change anything with the recipe and followed it to a T...thanks for the delish recipe.

Good basic recipe for egg salad. I also added celery & dill to mine. For those who hate chopping eggs by hand - if you have a pastry cutter/blender, use that to mash the eggs! Goes quickly and gives small uniform pieces. You can also use the large holes on your cheese grater, although it takes a wee bit longer.

Perfect combination. My family loves egg salad and I tend to forget about it. This made them really happy. Thanks for the recipe.

Tastes great much better than my original recipe. I actually used Dijon mustard instead of yellow && it tastes much better WITH the green onions! Love this recipe!!

Didn't change a thing about this when I first made it, but after tasting I thought it needed a little something... added garlic powder and celery salt really helped! Great on toasted bread.

I was pleasantly surprised by how simple and tasty this was.  There's not too many ingredients listed but the end result is still very tasty.  I added dill to the egg salad and served it on top of white bread topped with lettuce.  Very good!

Awesome recipe.  This is the first egg salad I ever made and it was delicious.  It's very simple and yummy as is. I will definately make this again and try adding some things that other reviewers suggested.

Yum! Deliciously satisfying! I didn't have green onions, so onion powder served as the pinch hitter today. I also added an eyeballed amount of Old Bay (although sometimes I use Lawry's). I used my standard method for boiling my eggs 14 minutes and giving them a 10 minute ice bath afterward before peeling them under cold, running water. I served this egg salad on honey-wheat bread with a slice of swiss cheese and a generous handful of spring greens on each sandwich. A serving of sweet potato fries and iced tea rounded out this lovely Mother's Day lunch, and was a hit with my hubby and 3 year-old daughter!  This is definitely a nice recipe on its own, but is certainly open to variation depending on what you have on hand, or your mood! Thanks for the submission, wifeyluvs2cook!

I used Ken's Perfect Hard Boiled Egg recipe which was great. Changes: I used 11 eggs instead of 8, though I only used 5-6 of the yolks. I also subbed sugar-free relish for the green onion. Overall nice and tasty. I was looking for a way to use up the Easter eggs and there it was on the front page :* Thanks!

This is a quick way to make a filling lunch for days that seem to go faster than they should. It's no trouble to make in the morning, and ensures that you have something great to look forward to at lunchtime. I made this with low-fat mayonnaise, stone-ground mustard, and leeks since they were what I had at hand. Although my sandwich fell apart because the egg salad was a little runny, it still was very delicious. I'd use less mayo next time, and probably make it the night before and chill it so it holds together better. Thanks for the recipe!

I've never eaten egg salad sandwiches before, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but I thought it was very good.  It's super easy and diet friendly if made with low-fat mayo.  I only made 1 serving for myself, which made 2 sandwiches.  Glad to have a new lunchtime recipe to add to the rotation.

The simplicity of this recipe is appreciated on so many levels. There are no over the top flavors and the ingredients not only compliment each other, but they can be found in most households! Not to mention, it's so easy to make! My three year old daughter helps me whip this together EVERY TIME! 

**I have omitted the green onion each time I've made it thus far, just b/c I've not had it on hand. I do look forward to adding it one of these days - I couldn't imagine it hurting the taste at all!**

This was a good, basic egg salad.  I did add a little chopped celery, because I think egg salad has to have a little crunch.  I also thought that this could use a bit more mustard.  Will tweak just a little next time, but I'll be making this again!  Thank you!

This is a good salad recipe to have on hand when groceries are low in the kitchen.  We added some about 1/2 t. of dill.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is similar to the recipe I use for egg salad. I usually use a couple tsp of dijon mustard and sometimes I add a tbsp or so of horseradish for a litle zip. Yummy on soft bakery rolls.

I made this egg salad last night to get rid of some of the hard boiled easter eggs. It was super simple to make and tasted delicious!!! The only thing I added was a small amount of sugar.

Perfect egg salad. Made it for 2 baby showers and used Hawaiian rolls and was a big hit. Baked my eggs in cupcake pans 350' for 25 minutes. Great texture and creamy when u bake your eggs!

The only things I added/changed was: I used finely diced sweet onions instead of green onion (didn't have any), I diced up a celery rib to throw in there for that crunch that I love, and I also added 1 tsp of dill weed. I made it while the eggs were still very warm, and that made it very thick and creamy. It made enough to last us almost 3 days total, and it didn't get runny in the fridge at all. Actually, somehow, it got better and better as the days passed. Thank you....it is definitely a keeper!

Delicious as written! But if you want to step it up a notch and really wow your family, guests, whatever, crisp cook some bacon, drain it, let it cool, then crumble into your egg salad - scrumptious!!

I agree that it's tasty, but I also agree that it needs something. I changed the servings to 6 for my 11 eggs, and I ended up using more like 2 TBS of mustard because it was bland. I also used celery salt and white onion as that is how I remember egg salad from my childhood. I added a LOT of celery salt and pepper, and then a little vinegar since it was still lacking. Maybe it was my mayo, though. Next time, I'll have to use Miracle Whip (another childhood flavour!) Definitely a good base, but a little tweaking is in order! Thanks for sharing!

The title of this recipe says it perfectly, it's a "delicious egg salad".  I just made this but didn't have green onions on hand so I sprinkled some dried chives and it was still very yummy.

My husband and I love this recipe! I've made it several times in the past month. I make two changes--spicy brown mustard in place of yellow mustard, and a few tablespoons of dill relish in place of the onion. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this egg salad sandwich for lunch and it was great! I only used four eggs so that it made 2 servings, and halved all of the other ingredients. I also used relish instead of the green onion.

Fabulous!! What a great way to use up the Easter eggs. We love Vegenaise (the one with the purple lid), so no mayonnaise in my batch, nor paprika, but I added 1/4 cup chopped celery.

My feeling about egg salad is the simpler the better (such as Wifey's recipe) and with the freshest, highest quality ingredients. And I prefer whole wheat  bread, with a little butter on each slice.

Perfect for a quick lunch- I did not have green onions so I used 1/4 yellow onion and it is very tasty!

I have been making egg salad just like this for years, except I add about 1/2 cup or so of grated cheddar cheese. It is out of this world!

UPDATE: Made it again this year using regular onion and chopped celery. Left out the paprika but used salt and pepper and added some dried dill weed. I used vegan canola mayo this time because I had it on hand and you get enough egg from, well, the eggs! Amazing again. This is my 'go to' recipe when Easter is over and I have a dozen eggs to use!

Hubby devoured this!  Used regular onion since I didn't have green onion and used croissants instead of sliced bread.

I altered this recipe to be a healthier version.  I used only the egg whites and light mayo.  I didn't measure the mayo or mustard, but I'm sure I reduced the amount of mayo and increased the mustard.  I left out the onion because I didn't have any.  I also added chopped celery and dill pickles.  Very tasty!

This is a great recipe! I have tried it as written and also with various substitutes, but the liquid ratios are just right. After that, pretty much all seasoning is to taste. My boyfriend raves about it every time. Thank you!

The recipe is too bland as is. I added lemon juice and upped the mustard a bit. I left out the green onions as I will be adding onions to my sandwich. So, as is it is 3 stars with changes I would give it a 4.

Easy to make, very tasty. I have made it twice now and devour it very quickly. I leave out the green onions and leave the rest of the recipe as-is. I take 2 slices of bread in a separate container to work with a small container of egg salad for a tasty sandwich that does not get soggy.

This is a good basic Egg Salad.  I tasted this as written and thought it need something else in it. The reason I give it four stars is because I added more ingredients.  I choppped some celery really fine and added a little pickle relish to this.

When looking for a recipe that would harken back to my mom's egg salad sandwhich, this one stood out and fit the bill perfectly!  Not a culinary masterpiece obviously, I don't know what everyone is expecting with an egg sald, but this one is classic and hits the spot.

I love this egg salad recipe.  It is wonderfully creamy.  I used Miracle Whip in mine, just a personal preference.  Also, do not skip using the green onions.  They are awesome in this!

This is a great, simple recipe.  The less you mess with an egg salad sandwich the better it is.  I left out the onion but did everything else the recipe called for and was happy with the results.

This was yummy! I liked the green onions in it. I usually put in regular onions, so it was a nice change. I also added some finely chopped celery for a bit of a crunch and like the reviewer {Heidi} I love dill too, so I put in a few pinches of dried dill. Thanks for sharing!

The concern I have is, the instructions on how to boil the eggs.  I used these directions several times and it would take me an hour to peel the shells off the eggs.  The issue is the putting the eggs into the water and bring to a boil.  It's left up to interpretation WHEN the water is "boiling".  Leaving the eggs in for 10-12 min. to too vague.  My daughter came home for a visit and actually showed me a easy...fail proof way to hard boil an egg. 
   Sara’s hard boiled eggs:
•	Fill colander about ¾ full
•	Add salt
•	Set to high, bring water to a rapid boil
•	Reduce to medium, to a steady boil and wait 2 min.
•	Carefully add a dozen eggs
•	Partially cover colander with the lid and wait 15 min.
•	Remove colander and eggs from heat and let sit for 2 min.
•	Add eggs to a bowl and immediately put into fridge
•	Let stand in fridge for at least 1 hour before shelling
•	Tap the large end of the eggs and a couple of times on the side
•	Egg shells are super easy to peel
•	Grate eggs and add onions, celery, mayonnaise and season as you like.

Trust me...this method works much better than what is posted on google.

I wasted eggs on this because, as others have said, the cook time is too short. I had soup, even after opening the first egg and realizing they were way too soft and I microwaved them for a minute to try to finish them off. Didn't work. I still tried mixing it all up and included some crushed saltines to help thicken it but no luck. I reluctantly threw it out.

I did not have green onions. I substituted dill relish to taste, and to crunch. I also used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow prepared. Great googly moogly, this was delicious! I will be making it again, and again. For the low carbers, it can be served over lettuce, on slices of cheese, or cold cuts, or it will stand well as a side dish. Try it with slices of cheese, and avocado for a completely hunger crushing lunch.

This was great!  I needed to make egg salad for a party....and I had never made it before.  I was looking for a good solid recipe, one that I could serve to a crowd, yet good enough to be better than average.  This was it.  I'm sure some cooks think it's silly that there are recipes on here for things that they just make from memory. To those of us who have never made them before and want to get it right on the first try, these recipes are a lifesaver. Thanks so much!

Very good BASE recipe. The ratio of egg/mayo/mustard were spot on. Tasted great after several hours in the refrigerator. I added a few pinches of dill, on large stalk of chopped celery, and roasted red peppers. Very yummy with the additions. Personally it would be a bit bland for me without my additions. Next time, I will add jalapenos and bacon!

I made it for the 3rd time. It did not have enough flavor so, I added 1/4 tsp of Curry, 1/4 tsp of hot sauce,  1 Shallot diced, and 3 stalks of Celery. I switched out the mayo with avocado mayo and yellow mustard with Grey Poupon.

I modified this recipe and it turned out to be the best egg salad I've ever had. I kept the paprika and green onion. I made sure to use heavy-duty mayonnaise instead of regular mayo which adds to a lot of the flavor. However if you don't work in a restaurant it might be hard to get heavy duty mayo. I also used a tablespoon of mustard instead of a teaspoon, I added a tablespoon of fresh organic dill, and half a teaspoon of turmeric. I absolutely suggest this!! So good!

As is, this recipe is REALLY bland.  I cut the mayo a little bit and added more mustard.  Instead of onions I added chopped celery, sweet relish, added celery salt and nearly doubled the paprika.  It turned out tasty good!

Great starter recipe. Never made egg salad and this recipe was very helpful. I substituted onion powder for the green onions and used relish instead for celery for a sweet crunch in taste!! Turned out delicious and will definitely make this again tweaking different ingredients for new ones, thanks for the simple recipe....love it!!!

This was very bland, despite my being very generous with both the black pepper and the paprika.  It definitely needs more than 1 tsp. of mustard.

This recipe is an absolutely great tasting, wonderful basic egg salad recipe. I haven't read any of the other reviews but I followed it to a T and it came out awesome. I have made this a handful of times before, and just now came in to rate it. I will keep this recipe around for any time I need to make egg salad!

this is awesome! i make it just like this most of the time for my family. I can suggest a few things to pep it up! Once, in a pinch I added hidden valley ranch dressing when i was low on mayo.. AMAZING change up.. I always add a tbsp of butter thats been melted in the microwave.. it takes the taste subtlely to the next level... I like to add a squeeze of Sriracha hot sauce or any brand of chili garlic sauce. and if it gets too hot just add a squeeze of kectchup .. i have had people come to my home and take JUST the sandwiches back with them... dont let it be too dry, cuz the bread will soak up some moisture from the mayo etc...

Egg salad is a tricky thing, because so many people have different variations on what they like in it. That being said, I think this is a perfect base recipe to jump from for any starter cook. I usually just threw the basic mayo/mustard/spices in to taste without measurement and it came out differently each time. This gives me good consistency in acquiring my start mixture every time. I like the paprika.

Since I have basically used this as only a base, and it is decent on its own, I have made alterations to spice it up better to my tastes. Green pepper is not always available in my house, but dill pickles almost certainly are, so a 1/4 cup of chopped pickles gives the salad a good boost and a little crunch. I add a few shakes of celery seed when I don't have celery to add for flavor. Also a little finely chopped onion is a good addition at times as well.

Excellent recipe, egg salad sandwich as it should be. Using real mayo a must. Salad dressing will make it watery. I increased the paprika to 1/2 tsp. added 1/3 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced red peppers and 1 1/2 tsp chopped fresh dill and used Dijon mustard. Great with any type crackers or on toast.

When making egg salad, potatoe salad, pasta salad etc, use mayonnaise, not Miracle Whip, as it becomes runny when refrigerated.

The Beasts gobbled their scrumptious salade del eggios. They would like to send out a personal, very prestigious, "thank you" to the user: "wifeyluvs2cook". Fluffy, moist, and succulent eggs bounced across the taste buds as if they were juveniles in a so-called "moon-walk". You could almost hear the celery-a-screamin' as it was torn from its pillowy bed of may-o-nnaise. As the stars show, the Beasts "Loved" it! The Beasts felt it was necessary to end this review with some advanced humour: Who wrote the book, Great Eggspectations? CHARLES CHICKENS!!! HA HA A HA!!

This is an amazing recipe for egg salad.  I'm a picky eater, so simpler is usually better for me.  It was the perfect amount of everything.  I can see how it could be a little bland if you use regular mayo, but I used Miracle Whip and didn't have that problem at all.  I'm so excited about this recipe!  I've been looking for a go-to egg salad recipe for a long time.

This wasn't that great, it didn't have very much flavor at all. But I do have to admit that I used egg whites instead of whole eggs. B/c there is no way we were going to eat 8 whole eggs! So I wonder if taking away the yolks took a lot of flavor out of the salad. I also think I accidentally added too much onion. But still, it was very bland. I know I know, you shouldn't rate a recipe if you made alterations that possibly ruined it, but I wanted to share what I did so others can take my advise that my alterations didn't work out so well! lol

Perfect! Exactly the way my mom made it when I was a kid. I used mini dill pickles instead of onions for more crunch and that dill flavor. I am going to make it in a pita pocket for lunch tomorrow.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Any changes made are due to personal preferences.
We like gherkins so we add one to two tablespoons of chopped gherkins and reduced the green onions  to one-fourth cup and switched the yellow mustard to one-half teaspoon dry mustard.
To those who add red or green peppers, due to their water content, egg salad will be runny the next day.

This is a all around great recipe.  To add a little crunch I finely cube a celery stick and add it.  It adds something to the overall texture and taste.  Try it, you'll like it.

This recipe for egg salad is great! I have always winged it when it came to measurements.. but this was a good guide. I over cooked my eggs a bit(I forgot about them for about 10 minutes too long while they were sitting in the pot with the hot water on the counter.. oops.) and when I was peeling a lot of the egg whites stuck to the shell on 2 of the eggs. BC of this my ratio of egg to mixture was a little off- it looks a little creamy. My fault. I added a pinch of celery seed and heaping teaspoon of dill. I sampled the finished product before putting it in the fridge and it's very yummy and eggy:) Thanks for the recipe! I can't wait to make a sandwich!!

I used to always mess up my egg salad and husband wouldn't touch it. Then I tried this recipe, and he asked for more, and then proceeded to finish it all!! This is a keeper for me! Excellent egg salad sandwich. (To avoid the problem of having the salad become watery, I just wiped them dry after peeling and before chopping them up.)

This sandwich was absolutely delicious! Best egg salad sandwich I've made by far! The Directions were so helpful considering i always have trouble boiling the perfect egg. the only thing i changed was no paprika because i didn't have any on hand and added relish instead of onions, again because i didn't have them! i will make this again! yumm!

PERFECT recipe! I followed it EXACTLY as written and my family and I are all totally pleased with this recipe.  YAY!!  The little bit of onion is SO great with the eggs.  I highly recommend finely mincing the green onion so that the subtle flavor is all throughout the recipe.  

SUPER good egg salad!!  I will most definitely be making this again... and again... and again..

Great recipe for egg salad.  I got a craving for egg salad one day since the tea house I go to has these great mini egg salad sandwiches that I love so much.  I was looking for a recipe that would match and this one pretty much did the trick!  I left out the onion though b/c I am not a fan.  I actually *forgot* to add the paprika which I'm bummed about because I think it would be a great touch.  I will add that next time for sure.  Otherwise-great recipe, very tasty!  I will make this again.

I left out the green onions since I was preparing this for my kids, and they don't care for onions.  The ratio of mayo and spices to the eggs was just perfect.  What didn't fit on the sandwiches, we were scooping out of the bowl on crackers!

Amazing egg salad.  I added one small, chopped kosher dill pickle to the recipe to add a little crunch.  With the pickle, the recipe only needed a teeny bit of salt and some pepper.  I will definitely be making this again.

It was runny and while ok as a base recipe, I had to add relish and a bit more seasoning to it.  I would not make it again.

I thought this was really good!  I boiled the eggs for 8 minutes, then let them set in the hot water another 2 before rinsing them in in cold water.  I omitted the green onions but added a little dried onion, celery seed, and dill along with some homemade sweet pickles.  Along with some lettuce on toasted whole grain bread, this was a delicious lunch!  Thanks!

Very, very good. Used spicy brown mustard because that's just what I like in egg salad sandwiches, other than that, followed recipe to T and I can say it's very, very good although uninspired as it's just basic egg salad with no extras. But still...perfect basic egg salad sandwich recipe. Try it with spicy brown!

Yum! I pretty much followed the directions, however. I used 1/4 c light mayo and 1/4 regular mayo, added some chopped celery (family preference), and I used Dijon instead of yellow mustard since I like the flavor better. LOVED this recipe. Will make again. Thanks!

Perfect!  All my attempts at egg salad are always too heavy in something, so I finally have the right proportions with this recipe.  We don't like crunchy in the egg salad so I left out the onion, but I'd definitely consider experimenting with some spices for different flavors.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is very good. Made it right after I read it. I did add relish and 1 tbsp of miracle whip because I like it a little sweet but the original is very good. Definitely a keeper

This is exactly how I've made egg salad for over 45 years, and I can honestly say that I love it, as did my husband.  As a matter of fact, this is what I prepared for my dinner last night.  Deliscious on toasted Pita!RDAVIS012

I am a huge egg salad fan so this was perfect. Just a little hint though. If you are lazy as I am. Don't bother chopping up the eggs. Just put all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and go at it with a potato masher.

This is the BEST egg salad recipe I've come across and believe me I've tried a lot!  It absolutely leaves things open to add or take away what ever your family prefers. I used about half the mustard since we're not big mustard fans, added about 2tbs finely chopped white onion, a pinch of dill and sprinkled paprika over the top. Even after eating a big sandwich we couldn't help but stand over the bowl with a spoon to finish it off. Will use again and again.

This is a wonderful basic egg salad. It's great on crackers or as a sandwich. I followed some of the other suggestions and added a stalk of chopped celery and a few chopped sweet pickles. It was exactly what I was looking for.

Amazing!!!!! I don't even like egg salad, but made this by request of my husband.  Instead of green onions, I used about 1/4 of a raw yellow onion very finely chopped (I hate biting right into an onion peice) and used Miracle Whip instead of mayo for a more tangy taste.  We also added two pickles again finely chopped.  Totally a keeper!!!

Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper. I didn't have green onions on hand so I used bell pepper instead and liked it. I also added a dash of garlic powder, celery salt, and onion powder. It was wonderful.

I thought this was great!  The amount of mayo and mustard was right on in my opinion.  I did add a little chopped sweet pickle (personal preference) and left out the paprika.

My mother always added chopped green olives to the hard-boiled eggs and mayo, thus my 69 year devotion to “Egg and Olive”! Try it!

Just made this today for my 16 yr old son and myself. He loves deviled eggs and potato salad (his favorite). Anyway, we don’t eat green onions so I just used regular white onion and probably only about a tbsp. Then I added 2 tbsp of chopped pickles, we put it on regular lightly toasted white bread. It was really good, I’ve never actually had egg salad. I was impressed. My son said it needed a touch more mustard, just for his taste but he liked it and then ate the leftover straight out of the bowl. My 12 yr old daughter who doesn’t like deviled eggs, tried this and she actually liked it, go figure!  I will definitely be making it again...probably soon if my son has any say in it.

This is an excellent recipe for breakfast lunch or dinner! Everything you need is probably already in your pantry and refrigerator. Not everyone in my family likes onion. I add 1 finely chopped stalk of celery and 2-3 mini-carrots finely chopped for that delicious crunch.

Took a simple egg salad sandwich to a higher level. The proportions for this recipe are spot on.  Followed the recipe with adjustments based on reviews.  Added celery, dill weed and 1/8 tsp cumin.  Consistency was perfect and the taste delicious.  Next time I will add a bit more dill weed and omit the cumin - just to try a different variation.  Four stars for a great basic recipe that was made a  5 star with reviewer suggestions.  Thanks to wifeyluvs2cook.

I like what I call "real" egg salad. Simple has always been my family's favorite. My husband and kids LOVE this salad. I also use this recipe for deviled eggs and get raves when I bring them to a party.

This has been my recipe for 65 years!!!  It was what we served in out little diner in the 50's.  Fresh batch made every day was always empty at the end.  My parents always buttered the bread before adding egg salad filling.  PERFECTION AT ITS BEST!!!

Sometimes simple is perfect.  Depending on the crowd, I add the green onions or not. I have added celery, but almost prefer without. This basic recipe just works and seems to please everyone.  Thanks!

I've made my egg salad with these ingredients for about 60 years, however, I use less mayonnaise and more mustard.  3-4 years ago, I was at my daughter's home, and teaching my 9 year old grandson how to make it.  The good news is that we had all the ingredients, the bad news is, there wasn't enough regular mustard.  So, we improvised!  My daughter is a mustard aficionado!  So, Alex & I picked Grey Poupon Dijon mustard, added 2/3rds French's mustard (all we had!) and 1/3rd Dijon mustard.  It was a *hit*!!!  We prepared the eggs the same, except for chopping them.  I've found that using a large grater works better for my family, but if you prefer a finer chop than pictured, try using the egg slicer once, then chop against the slices (after transferring slices intact to your less dominant hand) and gently chop quarter inch chunks.  Later, Michelle's family wanted it spicy, so I now add a small amount of cayenne (shades of Chef John!) or horseradish.  Taste for salt, pepper and spice & try on any kind of bread.  I prefer sourdough French, but for friends I often use freshly made croissants.  HTH! Blessings!!!

I'd never thought to add mustard, and it was a good addition.  
When my eggs are done cooking I dump the hot water and crack the shell of each egg as I add it to cold water - then I shell them under running cold water, laying them on a towel and wiping dry before using the pastry blender to chop them in a bowl - makes the job so much easier!  Also, use cooking onion instead of green onions.  I do prefer the stronger taste.  At 72 yrs old it's still nice to learn new ways of doing things.

OMG!!! AMAZING!! I did tweak the recipe based on the user input..I love this community!!! I brought eggs in cold water to a roiling boil and then boiled for 5 minutes then took off heat and covered 10 mins. perfecto!! I used 10 eggs and added about an extra 2 tsp of mayo to compensate. then I added extra 1 tbs of chives, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp of parsley. heavenly!!

The point of my review is that following the first part of the instruction, I wound up with half raw yolks, which is not the way I like to make egg salad. I have my own style of egg salad,  but I just wanted to know the right way to cook the eggs.  I still don't know.

I tried to make the egg salad this way, and it didn't work.  I ended up calling my Mom, asking what to do.  She said to boil the eggs for twenty minutes, and it worked.  Why isn't this stated here?

When you finish this recipe and it is chilled add 2 slices of fresh out of the pan hot bacon. I like mine limp somewhat but you can do it how you like.

Did everything that the recipe says... boiled the water, took the eggs off and let them sit for 10-12 minutes in the hot water and then let them cool. Once I went to crack the eggs, they were NOT done. What a mess. Personally, I'll never listen to that 'take them off the burner' advice again.  
Thanks for the recipe but no thanks for the bad directions.

I used minced onion instead of green onions and it was delicious! As another person recommended, I also mixed the warm yokes with the mayo first, then combined everything else, which I will continue doing, def makes it creamier

I only had low fat mayo on hand, and only enough for about a third of a cup. So, I only used 5 eggs instead of 8. Turned out great! I added jalapenos, diced pickles, and more paprika. So good! I'm addicted to egg salad and deviled eggs now. FYI, this kept in the fridge just fine for several days. I had egg salad rollups for lunch all week long.

My hubby has issues with vinegar and asked me to find a recipe for egg salad without it.  I have never made egg salad (or deviled eggs) without it so I tried this recipe since it does not have it.  He  LOVED it!!  And it was even better the second day.  I also never put onions in egg salad but this was really good!!  Am making it again tonight for lunch tomorrow.

Great base recipe to tweak to your own personal tastes. I separated the yokes from the whites so I could hear them up before adding the mayo. It gives it a very creamy base and helps it stick together. I also did half celery and half onion, added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder (fresh would be better but I didn't have it on hand), 2 teaspoons of diced pickles (claussen), 1 teaspoon of pickle juice, and literally just a sprinkle of cayenne powder on top right before serving.

Great tip for ensuring the eggs are hard boiled when you're ready to remove the shells!  Not sure if it's just me, but more times than not, I have to go to plan B with the eggs because they're mushy inside and not a good thing for egg salad!
The only ingredient I left out of this recipe was the mustard.  Not sure what it adds to the egg salad -- anyone care to comment?

Good! I omitted onion & used some dill relish, sometimes I add a dash of cayenne pepper (just a dash) or it will get too hot, I like Heinz dark mustard. thanks! 

@nanacooks loved the idea of using some cream cheese, tky

My husband is a bit of a picky eater so finding the right ratio of mayo & mustard can be tricky but this recipe was perfect. I added the green onion to a smaller batch for myself since my 2 yr old doesn't like it. A definite keeper. Simple but delicious.

This is the first time I've tried to make this myself. I love egg salad but have never made it. This is an amazing recipe! Thank you! I made some changes, I added half a sweet onion, 2 stalks of celery, I only put in 1/4 cup mayo (I'm not a fan of mayo), and I put in 1 tbsp Dijon mustard instead of a tsp, and I added a tbsp of relish. It has the perfect texture (for me, like I said, I hate mayo lol), and crunch! Ate it on a potato bun, delicious!!

Yum! Had some hard-boiled eggs to use up, and this fit the bill. Husband requested egg salad sandwiches for dinner on a Friday during Lent - nice change from the usual fish dinner. I, too, added a dash of paprika, and some chopped celery for some crunch. Husband loved it! Thanks for posting! I'll be making this one again!

Classic.  Just like how my mom used to make (but better, shhhhhh... Don't tell her).  Just kidding, she knows!  I made it for her right away.  If you're a fan of egg salad, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was great and so simple. I used yellow onion b/c I had no green ones, but I'm sure green onions are ideal for this. I also used Dijon mustard and used more mustard and less mayo. I also added some fresh parsley that I had laying around. My husband, who is pickier than my son, loved this. He ate 2 sandwiches before I even finished one!

YUMMMMY. I used spicy brown mustard, because it is what I had. Added chopped up jalapeno for crunch and kick. It is probably important to note that the cook time is based off smaller eggs. Add three or four minutes for large eggs.

Used chopped pickle instead of onion.  Added a generous pinch of sugar, a few shakes of paprika and a few pinches of dried dill weed.  Yum!!

It is a very good egg salad, indeed, just as it is. I didn't have green onions, so I added a couple of tablespoons of very finely chopped red onion plus one stalk of celery, finely chopped (just because I had it). It bulked up the salad a little, since I didn't have that many eggs as well. It is very good, both ways. Thanks for publishing it.

I loved. I did it almost exact, but subbed red onions for the green( that's what I had). It is nice and creamy, looking forward to trying it as many different ways as possible.

I never liked egg salad until I tried this recipe, it was really good. I didn't change anything except that I didn't add green onion because I didn't have any.

My dad said that he loved it!!.. He said it was the best thing he had since he was married (casting a mischievous glance towards my mom). My mom liked it too. I added mixed herbs , some olives and corriander... And wrapped some of it up in taco bread. I wish I could share a picture , but I m unable to upload one out here. I used normal onions and not green onions. And I made the  mix with 4 eggs and adjusted proportions accordingly. It tasted superb, so that means your proportions are awesome!!!

Other than having to use white onion instead of the green (because that's what I had), this was exactly the flavor I was looking for.  It reminded me of my dad's egg salad.  He was always the cook in our house, and from what I remember, he used to use white or yellow onion.  I can't remember ever having green onion in house growing up.  So, I really like the crunch that the onion added, but as others suggested you could also use celery for that crunch your looking for.  Bottom line, this is hands down my favorite egg salad sandwich recipe.  Thank Wifeyluv!  Luv your recipe!

I just made the recipe and love, love,  love it! I spent the day working out hard and knew that I could splurge on the calories.  I just don't want to tell my boyfriend that I ate without him because it was soooo good! I made one small substitution. I left the onions out and added 2 Tbs of dill pickle relish.  Mmmmnn.

This is a really nice basic egg salad recipe.  I've made this twice.  Once exactly as the recipe states.  The second time I added 1/2 tsp. of dill.  You can dress this up anyway you like.  Delicious!

This is a basic recipe.  One hint for any salad sandwich, egg, ham, chicken,egg, etc., if the dressing is runny add a few bread crumbs or fine cracker crumbs and it will absorb the moisture and you cant tell it is there.

Good basic recipe but my eggs didn't cook through.  I always add a little hot dog relish to my egg salad.  Sounds strange but it adds such flavor and crunch.

Eating this sandwich right now as I post a comment.  I added 1 celery stalk, chopped fine, as we like a little crunch in our salad.  Added 1/8 tea of red pepper in lieu of black pepper and 1/8 tea of sweet smoked paprika and a 1/4 tea of salt.  This tastes just like the egg salad they serve at The Masters and it does not get any better than that.

Great recipe. I loved it the way it was the first time. The second time I added relish and celery and it was even better. But still great the way it is.

Excellent recipe! Very similar to how I make my deviled eggs! The only changes I made was that I used Dijon mustard and smoked paprika! Thank you for the recipe!

Add 1/2 cup of water to a rice cooker. Measure water from bottom of meniscus. Add a dash of vinegar. Prick seven eggs. Place 7 eggs in the steaming basket of a rice cooker. When the cooker dings, the eggs are finished. You have perfect hard-boiled eggs in roughly 12 minutes. Place eggs in bowel and run water on eggs for one or two minutes. Then place eggs in ice water for ten minutes. Roll eggs on table till it is covered with cracks. Start cracking shell at the to top of the egg, the wide part. Then carefully break shell away under running water. Use an egg slicer to slice the hard boiled eggs first in one direction, then in another. To the above recipe add a little less mayonnaise. Use Spectrum Canola mayonnaise purchased from Whole Foods Grocery store. Add half a sweet onion finely chopped. Use fancy paprika. Double the quantity of paprika. Use fresh coarsely ground Tellicherry peppercorns. Add one clove of minced garlic. Add Dijon mustard and Honey Cup honey mustard. Add half a cap (not half a cup) of lemon juice, and a little red wine vinegar. Add dried or fresh dill weed and celery seed. Add a little garlic powder and onion power. Add a dash of Mrs. Dash. Optional: add chopped celery and/or a tiny amount of chopped pickle and/or a tiny amount of pickle relish. Or add a little curry powder in place of pickle or pickle relish. Or add chipotle powder. Start with a little bit of each added ingredient, then add a little more to taste. Don't overpower with spices.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! I usually love onions, but ran out and used pickles instead. Also I took the advice to use Dijon Mustard and the verdict...Yummy!

This was a good basic egg salad recipe. However, I think it needs celery! Also, I used the white onions that I had in my kitchen. BIG mistake! Next time I will use the recommended green onions, or I will use sweet Vidalia. I might try it without additional salt next time.

This is delicious! I made it almost exactly as written, except that I didnt have regular mustard so I used dijon mustard. Yum! I will definitely make this again. Very quick and easy and great for those of us on a budget!

Great recipe! Everyone loved it and it was not runny at all - nice firm consistency and great flavor.  I added a little more paprika for more of a kick.  Next time I might add some celery as well.

I was looking for an egg salad recipe that used basic ingredients that I already had around the house so I could use up some eggs.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  It was easy to make and tasted quite good.

I cut the mayo in half and added 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar. Also double the paprika. My changes made it 5 stars, but as is only a 4 star recipe. Oh and I agree with the other user who suggested mixing hot yolks with cold mayo to make it creamier.

My whole family loved it!  Variations we tried were adding dill relish, and/or celery, bacon, ham, and diced pickles.  Highly recommended.  And very easy to adjust for the number of people.

I made this yesterday, following the recipe exactly.  It was very good!   Then I decided to add a bit of onion powder and a tbs of diced sweet pickles.  It was delicious!  I just wanted a little "crunch" with it and the pickles did the trick.  I put the leftover salad in fridge and it was perfect the next day too.  Not watery at all as someone else mentioned. Thanks wifeyluvs2cook.  I love it.

Good starter but needs some dressing up, finely chopped celery, and about a teaspoon of dried dill weed along with some pickle relish, dill or sweet to your own taste.

This egg salad is so yummy. I made the recipe exactly as noted and it is just like grandma used to make. I have made it a more than a few times and it has become the gold standard. I used Hain mayo because it is non-gmo and tastes like the mayo I ate as a child before all the chemicals took over our foods. This is the BEST egg salad I have ever tasted...........This is delish on home-made toasted bread and it is decadent when used as a dip on crunchy pita chips.

It was very basic but I suppose a good place to start.  I had hoped with the number of reviews that this would be a really good recipe, not one that would benefit from tweaking.
And it just seemed as if there were a small number of egg salad recipes posted so I didn't have much to decide from.
Gonna add this to my recipe box and review a few other recipes to see what type of additions, other than dill weed or pickle, would really make this an exceptional recipe.

Very basic.  Not much flavor.  Used 1 whole white onion.  Added 2 small pickles.  Doubled mustard (djion.)  Still very mild flavor.  But good.

Pretty much exactly what I was looking for.  A simple, no-fuss egg salad.  The only change I'd make in the future is to use dijon mustard for a bit of a kick and extra flavor. Thanks!

My husband is not a big fan of mayonnaise based salads, but he did recommend making this more than once! Thanks! I can add something new to my lunch menu.

This was a great recipe to make in a large quantity (I made 20 servings), but the end result was really kinda bland.  I would think though that if I used a sweeter mayo, such as Hellman's Mayonnaise, it may have had a better result.  I used Kraft Mayonnaise with Olive Oil, which I normally prefer...but it just doesn't have the same taste sometimes.  I ended up adding a lot of celery seed just to sweeten it up some, and I was much more happy with it after that.

Yummy egg salad.  I did not use paprika.  Maybe next time I will.  I instead used Indian Relish.  Gave it a great flavor.  I will make this often now that is summer!

I added 10 eggs and 1/4 cup mayo, 2 tsp spicy brown mustard, 1 Tbsp chopped chives, sprinkled salt and pepper in but forgot to add the paprika.  I loved this and so did my daughter, but my friend said he wanted to be able to taste the mayo and that I hadn't added enough. lol, maybe next time.

This is a great recipe that really just needs tweaked to your personal taste. I used less green onions and added one stalk of celery. We like to eat ours with tomatoes and lettuce.

To make this a little more healthier I switched out and added a few things.  I used Vegenaise instead of Mayo, also added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, and a Tbsp of relish.

Great recipe and easy to make if you prepare the eggs the night before and keep them in the fridge.  Instead of the green onion, I substituted fresh chives from the garden and omitted the paprika.  My son said it was the best egg sandwich ever...

Yum! Made this yesterday and the consistency was great! Just the right ratio of mayo to egg. I added white onion since I didn't have green, and it was very good - just the right amount of crunch. Didn't have paprika, so didn't use that, but still delicious!

This is a great basic egg salad recipe.  I made it like written the first time.  The second I added some dill pickle relish, a little celery salt and onion powder.  I like a little "crunch" and the pickles added just a little zing.  Thanks for sharing

Very tasty (although I left the green onion out cause I did not have on hand).  I have just recently began making things from scratch instead of buying prepared foods.  I wanted something that was like I had growing up and this was actually better and suprisingly easy to prepare.  I will make this many more times.

Great recipe!!! Per suggestions from other reviewers, I added about 1 tsp of celery seed and dried dill. I also added about 2 tbs. of sweet salad cubes, a dash of tobasco, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I cut the recipe in half, so it called for 4 eggs, but I used 5, as i prefer my egg salad a little thicker. Thanks so much for sharing!

I must admit that I am not an egg fan however, I found this egg salad to be quite tasty. My husband had a sandwich for lunch and he loved it.  My two year old likes it as a dip with Sun Chips. As always, I prepared the recipe as written. Next time, I'll add a little cayenne pepper.

amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I think you could easily do 9 eggs though(it was quite saucy). I highly recommend this recipe.

Good recipe.
Great starting point for basic egg salad. I added roasted garlic, less onion and it turned out great.

This recipe is the perfect traditional egg salad.  I made this for 1 serving and added some diced celery, I like some crunch in mine.  I served it on a toasted kaiser roll. I think this needed some extra kick of some sort, but I haven't figured out what that is yet.

One of my FAVORITES!  I add chopped celery and chopped carrots if i have them, and I tend to go a little lighter on the mayo.  Oh and I added pickles once, that was great!  DELICIOUS in a sandwich with toasted bread, colby jack cheese, and lettuce!

Just made this recipe.  A couple changes, though...  Didn't have green onions or yellow mustard.  Substituted 1/2 a yellow onion, rinsed, and 1 small pickle instead of the green onion ~ and used Dijon mustard instead of the yellow.  I also added an extra hard boiled egg to make it a little thicker...  Thanks for a terrific recipe...

I made this for lunch today, and my husband and I both loved it. Great, simple, very few ingredients make for a quick lunch! I liked the mustard in this egg salad, it gives it a little kick that my mom's egg salad never had. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good.  After I made the egg salad I added some chopped celery as one person mentioned and I added a little bit of dill to taste.  I did make it with the 1/4 cup chopped green onion.  I will use this recipe for my egg salad from now on.

Excellent egg salad recipe!  Thanks!  Easy peel eggs...boil the water, pierce the rounded part of the egg with an egg piercer, lower the eggs into the boiling water with a slotted spoon.  Cover and boil for 12 min. Drain - shake the pan to crack the shells.  Run very cold water on the eggs and start peeling.  Sometimes an egg will 'peel' itself when you have shaken the pan!

Great basic recipe. I added relish instead of green onion & celery for a crunch.  Will probably make with dijon next time for added flavor.

nomnomnom this is gooooood. the eggs, first off, turned out perfect. made the fluffiest egg salad ever. i actually was being lazy and just making a single serving, so i used 2 of the eggs, approx 2 tbls of hellmans and just a teeny bit more then 1/4 tsp of mustard. i didnt put the onion in though it would of been even better im sure. then all i added other then that was a few twists of the mcormick garlic and pepper seasoning grinder ( it already has sea salt in it ). this is a great sandwich, even on this somewhat bland low sodium wheat bread. TY, love this recipe.

I made this for lunch today. Thought I was searching for a nice tuna melt or a grilled cheese recipe, and found this one. I used smoked paprika, and added bacon bits I fried up. I sandwiched the egg salad with thick bread, and cheese, fried it in the pan to melt and added a touch of sea salt. Very tasty!

Perfect egg salad, basic but simply delicious and it's a classic. I don't like a lot of flavors going on with egg salad, and this fits the bill. I make my egg salad like this all the time, but unfortunately I didn't have any green onions, so I had to do without. This still turned out great. If you don't have any green onions, a dash of onion powder would work also. I used herbed wraps and some iceberg lettuce and this was a wonderful lunch. Honestly, my favorite way to have egg salad is between 2 slices of toasted white bread, but the wraps was a nice change. Simplicity at it's best! :)

I used Heinz sweet relish instead of the pickles and It was very good. I have made this a few times now and I find that I need to add a little more relish than what the recipe calls for with the pickles. This is my 'go to' egg salad now.

Easy recipe with classic taste. I used no-fat mayo and it still tasted wonderful.

Love this!  Easy, Simple, and fool proof!  Best egg salad I've had so far!!!  I did alter the recipe a bit.  Used the base recipe as is, and then added in about 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, nearly 1/2 tbsp paprika, 1 tsp onion powder (s/o won't eat anything if it clearly has onions in it! lol) and about 1 1/2 tbsp of sweet pickle relish.    Great stuff!!!

This is a very good recipe. My husband had been begging for some egg salad and this was the closest to his description. I didn't have any onion so I didn't get to add it. I'm looking forward to trying it again with the onion.  The only change that I made to it was I added 2 TBS of sweet relish to it.  Very Good!!!! ;)

I think the onions are better left out.  By the next a.m. this was very very runny,  and I think it's due to the eggs as I haven't had it happen without. But the flavor is great!

For a low calorie option, I use romaine leaves instead of bread and roll the egg salad in them like stuffed cabbage leaves.  I also added dill pickle relish.  If you can find fresh brown eggs, they add to the flavor and color.

This came out really good. Ive never been much of an egg salad eater but it sounded good to me so I made it. I did make a couple changes though. Instead of mayo i used fat free mayo as well as light sour cream. I diced up some celery and picked some dill from my garden... and since I just bought a dozen bagels I decided to have it on an egg bagel. Then topped off with some capers. Mmmmm...

It was a good basic recipe, and thats what I was looking for. The lil one wanted egg salad so it cant have to much zing so I left out the onions. Hubby said it would be better with celery, but I didn't have any.

This is great egg salad...just like what I grew up with!  Hint:  I always use brown eggs when making egg salad, so you can see the shells & make a shell-less salad.  =)

Thanks for the recipe Wifey! I didn't grow up eating Egg Salad & to be honest it's never sounded very appealing, but this was an easy, tasty breakfast. Served it on whole grain bread. Didn't have any green onion & used my homemade Cajun Seasoning for a kick. Thanks!

I have used many recipes from this site and loved most of them. This was just a basic recipe, nothing spectacular about it. Egg salad is basically simple to make. I did try this recipe and added a stalk of chopped celery and cut down on the mayo. It was good, but again nothing spectacular.Therefore, I gave it a 3 since I did have to modify it.

OH! I am SO IMPRESSED. Egg salad that is so delicious. I used freeze dried chives and onion powder and miracle whip. I cut this in half so I could take some for lunch the next few days and sure wish I hadn't after sampling half a sandwich. Well...it started out just a bite then I had to make a little sandwich it was so good. Thanks wifeyluvs2cook, this is eggscellent!

I have always made my egg salad "eggsactly" this way except I used diced pickles instead of onions. I like the green onions, nice change of pace. The only thing this recipe needs for me to give it a 5 star is a bit of garlic. So, after a few bites, I added a touch of garlic and it was very good. Thank you!

I love the method for boiling the eggs. That's what I do and they come out perfect every time. I liked this egg salad, however, it needs a little kick. Next time I'm going to add some cayenne for more flavor.

I scaled the recipe for 1 serving and used only 1 egg, 1 tbsp light hellmans, and substitued dried minced onion for the green onions, the rest of the recipe was followed as is.  Perfecto.

A very good and easy egg salad. I had previously hard cooked eggs my own way. Didn't have green onions so I diced up some sweet onion. This is perfect as is without the sandwich or crackers.

These are great except...I cooked the eggs as stated and they weren't done. I put eggs in a pan and covered with cold water, brought them to boil, put lid on it and turned it down to low for 25 minutes. They were perfect. I also didn't have any green onions so I just sprinkled some minced onions in and it was fine. I used miracle whip instead of mayo and it was the perfect combo of mayo/mustard and great flavor. I will be making these for lunch several times a week.

I love a good egg salad sandwhich. This recipe hits the spot with not too much mustard. I did add dill weed after reading other reviews and I added a pinch of cayenne because I cant live without it. Thanks for sharing this recipe. My kids loved these sandwhiches too.

Very tasty as is. I scaled it down to 1 serving for my hubby’s lunch. Only thing I did differently the first time was used a small sprinkle of onion powder instead of the green Onion since I didn’t have any. I did tweak it a little the 2nd time based on the comments: sliced up real fine a little celery and a little dill pickle, ended up needing to add a touch more mayo, added a tiny sprinkle of garlic powder for good measure. But like I said, was also very tasty as it was written!

This was yummy. I used a dozen eggs and 3/4 C of mayonnaise, which is the same ratio as the recipe, just more. Used stone ground Dijon for the mustard, everything else per the recipe. Creamy, satisfying with good flavor. I’m trying to wean myself off putting sugar in anything, especially savory things, and I liked this better than my teaspoon-sugar-added recipe. Thank you so much!

I was tasked with making egg salad for my boyfriends mom coming over tomorrow. This seemed easy and so I settled on it. I woulda went 3 but boyfriend says 4 so I went to that due to him and well inspiration. I realized with never making it before I needed to do it like we like deviled eggs basically. First go I made as is (hence the 3) then second time dialed back the mayo and added way more mustard and vinegar. Way more like our taste. Thank you for sharing. Won’t make as it says but will to our personal taste more tangy.

Made this as written with the exception of the addition of half a diced cucumber. My wife is an egg salad snob, and the cucumber was her idea, and we both really loved this easy to make recipe. I also used a potato masher on half of the eggs, and rough chopped the rest. This made it both creamy and chunky.
This recipe is now part of my arsenal... Thank you!

I added a splash of hot sauce for a little spiciness. It's a versatile dish so definitely add additional spices to suit your personal taste.

I made this as written, except I doubled the mustard. it's a great basic recipe to use to add your preferences as you wish. next time, I may add celery and a little onion for some texture.

I have made this numerous times and it is wonderful!  Directions are good. The only change I have ever made was to use one Tablespoon diced onion  when I did not have green onions. I use my hand held pastry blender to chop the eggs which works great. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!

Very nice recipe.  Works great for sandwiches.  Like other reviewers had said, you can add just about anything to this recipe to make your own.  

For all the Instant Pot owners,  add water to the IP, place trivet on the bottom of the pan.  Place eggs on trivet.  Place lid on pot and make sure it's on sealing position.  5 minutes under pressure and 5 minutes natural release.  Remove eggs and put in ice water.  Best eggs ever....easy to peel and perfect every time.

I had been craving a good egg salad sandwich (I’m currently 38 1/2 weeks pregnant) my whole pregnancy and today I couldn’t take it anymore! I HAD to have it one way or another. I followed the recipe but cut it down to half since it’s just for baby and I and let me tell you...ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I slathered it onto a very light toasted wheat bread and added a Spring Mis to it and OMG, craving satisfied!! I will definitely be using this recipe over and over and over again ‘till death do us ‘part!

This was perfect ratios. Used Dijon for the mustard and omitted green onions because my husband doesn’t like them. So very plain Jane, but perfect for on bagels in the morning. Used a dozen eggs, so made 1.5x recipe. Good tip I learned recently, if you run cold water over freshly boiled  eggs while you crack them (do a bunch of cracks) they peel super easily!

This is a very good recipe for egg salad. I didn’t have green onions so I followed someone else’s suggestion and added pickles instead. I used bread and butter pickles so it gave the salad a slightly sweet flavor. I also skipped the salt since the pickles were salty enough.  I’ll probably make it again this way, except less mayonnaise. I might also try with green onions if I have any on hand. I’m sure it’ll be good either way.

Egg-cellent base recipe! I’ve never been successful at making egg salad which seems incredibly simple. Turns out I’ve always added too much mustard. I steamed my eggs for 12 minutes then followed the recipe then added bacon and avocado because I had them on hand. So delicious.

This is a very tasty egg salad sandwich recipe! Only thing I would say is I ended up using 9 eggs and there was a bit much on the mayo side even with an extra egg using the specified amount. If you love mayo make it as is.... if you don’t like so much I would scale it back a bit as I will next time.

Good recipe!  I added celery and chopped dill pickles cause I like the crunch.  Also,  I added fresh green chives instead of onion, being I just ran out of onions.

This is THE BEST egg salad I’ve ever had!  Notice, not best I’ve ever “made”, this is the best I’ve ever HAD anywhere, hands down!  I don’t even normally like egg salad that much, I fixed it for my husband. But I’m hooked, make this “as is” before changing anything!

I didn't have enough green onion so I made up the difference with chives. It was great. The recipe has the perfect amount of mayonnaise so that the salad isn't too dry nor to saucey. It's very simple and quick to make. I would make this again.

As I'm sitting here eating a plate of this, I thought hhmmm, maybe I should rate it. The hubby and I love this stuff! The only thing I changed was I added a tad of dill pickle relish and used a spicy sweet mustard. Phenomenal for sure!!

Made this recipe twice now with amazing results. The first and second time i made as written. The first time was delicious and the second time i sprinkled in some real bacon bits. Thats in the fridge now chilling for lunch. Hope the addition of bacon bits didn't screw it up. Will be making this recipe often because it is so easy. thanks for the recipe.

This is versatile and easy. I used a pastry cutter after slicing the eggs to chop them. I also drained the relish using a strainer. Added a little mustard and extra paprika. I made it with nine eggs instead of eight. Other than aforementioned tweaks, all good. Heaven on pumpernickel.

I would give it 5 stars after my modifications (obviously it's personal preference). I followed the recipe as is then added some diced celery, pickles and Cholula hot sauce. it gave it a little extra flavor and crunch that we loved

Added a bit extra paprika to taste I am from Louisiana and also the tip on horseradish mustard was on point for more of a deviled egg salad appeal.

Simple and easy. Added garlic powder and a bit more paprika....need to double up cause it will be gone in 24! Hint--eggs in, when boiling count to 9 min, out, ice and wait 5-7 min to peel. They should peel no problem!

Delish!  The only change that I made was to omit the green onions, substituting two tablespoons of finely chopped Vidalia onion.  Serve on croissants!

This is so yummy! I just had a tooth pulled and was looking for something soft but filling to eat. This was perfect. I used less paprika and substituted fresh chives for the green onion.

Delicious. Tastes like deviled egg on a sandwich. I do add just a tad more mustard. Just personal preference.

I have been making this for over 50 years.  But I call it "Egg and Olive Sandwich".  And I learned this from my mom.  
Can't imagine eating this without sliced olives.  The combination of egg and olives makes this a great sandwich. 
Extremely simple and filling. Goes great with a cold glass of milk.

I'm giving this a 3/5 because it lacked flavour. It could have needed more salt than I used, but I don't like to rely on salt alone. I'll probably try it a few times more, since it's a good base, and tweak the herbs and spices a bit each time.

this was so easy but not a fan of olives so omitted them and as others added some dijon mustard.  Also added some celery for that crunch.

I cooked the eggs exactly as instructed and for 12 minutes but they were nowhere near hard boiled. Second try, I used my egg steamer to cook the eggs and followed the rest of the recipe instructions. The egg salad was delicious as a sandwich.

I did add smoked paprika and celery and miracle whip and grey poupon in place of the mayonaisse and yellow mustard. I sliced up chives from out of my garden and added fresh ground black pepper and omitted the salt altogether. It's amazingly yummy :)

Love egg salad and this was great  with the elimination of onions (don't care for them) and the addition of celery and dill and a sprinkle of onion powder. I also make a different type called egg and olive with well chopped hard boiled eggs, halved or chopped Spanish olives, and mayo. This our family favorite.

This is a great recipe, but I didn’t really appreciate the onion. My mother, and my favorite drug store soda fountain always put halved or chopped green olives in egg salad, so that’s what I did as well. Great on toasted sourdough bread with some crispy fresh lettuce.

Perfect as written, creamy, fast and easy.

Used an Instant Pot to hard boil the eggs and now "zero to delicious lunch" takes  no time at all.

Made it 2 days in a row.  It' that good. Looks like there won't be left overs today either.

Good ‘ol basic egg salad that is very “forgiving”, ie, I didn’t have green onions so I minced Vidalia sweet and it was delish. Also you can dump a blob of pickle relish too and it’s good no matter what.

Great Egg Salad recipe just as it is written - five stars!  Easy to adjust for personal taste preferences and/or additions.  This is a fantastic base for multiple variations but is also has a wonderful classic egg salad flavor for those not looking for something spicy or complex.  Thanks wifeyluvs2cook!

Love this salad both with and without the scallions! I made it with Dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard and it was delicious! I also mixed the yokes with the mustard, mayo etc and then folded the cutup egg  whites in. Definitely my favorite go to egg salad both on its own and with crackers or on bread.

This recipe was so simple and tasty. I made as is except that I replaced 2 Tbls green onions with 2Tbls chopped dill pickles. So yummy. I might add celery for a little crunch next time.

This recipe is so super easy! I did make 2 substitutions and it was delicious! I used honey Dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard and because I love pickles so much, I substituted pickles for the green onions. So good!

I agree with the other reviews on here, this is a really great egg salad base to which you can add your own twist to it. I added dill and thinly sliced celery to my egg salad. I didn't have any yellow mustard, but I had left over sweet hot mustard from Hickory Farms. I think it tasted even better with that. 

In terms of cooking the eggs, I followed a tip another reviewer left on here, and the eggs came out beautiful and vibrant yellow in the center. The key was to cook it in boiling water 5 minutes,  take it off the heat, and then let it sit for an additional 10 minutes. Definitely adding this to the recipe book.

Really good! I put about 1/2 teaspoon of stone ground mustard in after the mustard the recipe called for. When there was only enough left for one sandwich, my family argued over who would get it in their lunch!

I liked this recipe on top of a piece of swiss-green onion bread. I used Miracle Whip and Grey Poupon instead of mayonnaise and yellow mustard. Good for lunch.

Wonderful recipe! I never knew to add mustard to egg salad. I did not have green onions on hand, so used yellow onions which also worked.

Easy and tasty!  I used Coleman's English mustard for extra oomph.  Also, I only boiled the eggs for 8 minutes.  Will make again. Perfect proportion of mayo/egg/mustard.

I absolutely love this recipe. I never made egg salad before until I seen this recipe. I used to buy them at the deli in grocery stores on a lunch break. I have stopped buying them and eat this instead. I can't believe I thought those store bought were even half decent! I cook my eggs in an instant and trying different breads now.  
Thanks for sharing!

Reminded me of my moms. I made this but left out the paprika and I used white onion. I added 1 tsp of relish  for color and more crunch.

Was pretty good. 

Didn't have green onions, so substituted onion powder. 
Also added parsley and dill.

As others have said I loved this as a base recipe. 
These are the changes/additions I made:
Use 1/3 cup mayo (vs. 1/2)
Use 1 Tablespoon Grey Poupon Mustard (vs. 1 tsp yellow)
Use 1/3 cup chopped Vidalia onion
Add 2 dash's Franks hot sauce and a dusting of cayenne pepper, 
Add dried (or fresh) parsley; 
Next time I'll add celery too.  :)

I made this exactly as recipe stated except for that I did not have green onions in the house. I put chopped yellow onion in as a substitute. This was delicious and very easy to make. I will try with the green onions as stated the next time I make this. Thanks for this simple yet delicious recipe!??

We really like this recipe. As some others have mentioned, the ratios are spot on. We added some celery and splash of lemon juice (approx 1 TBS). This recipe is a keeper.

I prefer a baseline for salt with the addition or to taste, but anyway a very good basic recipe. I did note that people have trouble peeling the eggs. I have a method that has yet to fail me. Steam the eggs. Bring water to boil on med-high then add the eggs. For 8 eggs, steam them 15 minutes. Then put them in ice water immediately and let them cool about 15-20 minutes. I have never had trouble peeling the eggs using this method. For 6 eggs I steam them 12 minutes.

This is a good basic recipe. But, because I was quadrupling the recipe and making it the day before for a crowd, and because I like some crunch and zip to my egg salad, I made these changes:  I used onion powder so the onions wouldn't weep, added some chopped celery (dried well on paper towels) and some pickle relish well-drained and blotted on paper towels.  The salad stayed a nice thick texture that way. I also added a light shake of cayenne pepper to the mix!

As others have reviewed, the proportions of ingredients is perfect!  I always have a hit and miss with that.  My only deviation is that I added a little sweet pickle relish which my family is used to and prefers.  A protein backed treat!

Not a fan, needed more mayo wasn’t creamy enough, I find egg salad better when the eggs are mashed not chopped and the paprika turned the egg salad red which was off putting as well. It was edible but won’t make again

I HATE pealing eggs. So I came up with a faster easier way. I scrambled for eggs. Just cook them a little bit longer just until you can see they’re dry then I took them off the stove put them on a plate and folded the ingredients. I used a quarter cup of mayo I  still used 1 teaspoon of mustard then I diced up some onions.  you cannot tell the difference and it only took me 11 minutes and I was eating my sandwiches.

Family loved it.  I didn't have the green onion, so I used a few dashes of onion powder.  It was still good.  Even my 5 year old liked it.   This recipe helped me use up the less than perfect boiled eggs that I made for deviled eggs.

I gave it 4 stars because I had to change just a couple small things. I added 3 more eggs because it was too... creamy... for my liking. I also added just a bit of dry mustard as well as regular yellow mustard and I didn't have onion (and husband hates the texture of them) so I used onion salt. Other than that, I made it according to recipe and its exactly what I wanted.

Our chickens are laying eggs faster than we can eat them. My husband suggested I make egg salad with them for lunch. I have never tried egg salad before and honestly it didn’t sound like something I would care for. I don’t care much for hard boiled eggs, mayonnaise, or mustard but I figured I’d try it since I was making it for him. I was surprised. I really liked it and my husband liked the recipe as well. I omitted the celery and onions and added chopped bacon instead. Will definitely make again.

Made this for my boyfriend, since he never had time to make his own lunch.  Said he likes egg salad.  Since I made a chef salad with some hardboiled eggs on top, I had some left over.  Tasted a bit myself, tweaked the ingredients slightly.  Used spicy paprika, and a little less mayo.  I thought it tasted good.  My boyfriend was very excited to have a lunch prepared for him, loved the sandwich made with potato bread.  I plan to use this recipe for tea sandwiches, combining it with tuna salad for a two layered finger sandwich.  I have a feeling that my tea party sandwiches will be a big hit!

It was good and easy to make.  I thought it had slightly too much mayo so I would use less next time.  I also used relish instead of green onions because that's what I had.  I think the green onions would be good in it though.  Good egg salad recipe.

This is by far the best egg salad I have ever made (or ate)!
Your "note" on making the perfect hard boiled egg is priceless.  Thank you so much.  Alma

Excellent recipe, very flavorful (let sit in refrigerator over night before serving).  I added 1/2 of a cup of chopped celery for added crunch and it was great!

Absolutely amazing egg salad recipe!! I made this about a year ago for just myself and it instantly became my favorite! Best egg salad I have ever had! I made it again a few days ago and shared it with my mother. She absolutely loved it, finished it off very quickly and couldn't wait for me to make more! So, I am, right now, making it again. This time I am making a double batch so it will last longer! My mother and I both love this egg salad and simply can not get enough!!

I pretty much followed recipe but as suggested by others used Dijon Mustard and 1/2 tsp dill weed.  I did not have green onion so used red onion.  I also added Mt. Olive Simply Relish Deli Style Dill undrained, about 1-2 Tbsp.  Don’t forget the paprika!  It was very good!

Had no trouble with the cook time on the eggs, I made sure they were covered and left in boiling water for 12 minutes. They came out perfectly cooked and the addition of the green onions, mustard, and paprika took my base recipe up a notch.  I will make this again for sure!

For full disclosure... I never cared for egg salad.  But my husband loves it. I thought this would be a great recipe to try.  I made it exactly as is and before I called my husband in to taste it, I took a bite..then a second bite. Figured I'd best call him before I ate more.  Needless to say, I'm converted and my husband loved it too!!

Great recipe, followed others suggestions and added celery and green onions.  I did add dried tarragon as I think it adds and if adding pickle I always use dill relish, just because we like it better than sweet.  If you do this you can use less mayonnaise.  Sometimes I also use dill weed or sprinkle it on top of deviled eggs.  I use my pastry blender to mash up the eggs before adding other ingredients.

This has always been the way I made my egg salad but I sometimes add celery depends on if my husband is going to be eating it or not.  He doesn't like celery.

I make this repeatedly. I use a small, diced sweet onion instead of green onions and 1/4 teaspoon of hot paprika rather than regular paprika.

It's a very basic simple recipe that's easy to customize.  I substituted finely chopped vidalia onions for the green onions and it turned out great.

This is a very good basic recipe as is and as noted in recipe I used less green onion and rated it at this point as 5 stars. But I  needed some punch so added sweet and dill relish along with 1 small rib of finely minced celery and ate it open-faced on toasted mild rye bread - VERY GOOD.   Probably depending on  eggs (they are sold by weight not necessarily by size or count) they should boil for 2-3 minutes to avoid not being fully cooked then covered and removed from heat to rest for about 15 min.  Have a container of iced water ready and immediately plunge eggs in for about 5 minutes.  Crack initially on the small end of the egg (where the air gathers) then crack entire shell all about gently and peel under small stream of running cold water (be sure to get peeling started under that layer of film that can sometimes be present).  I had struggled for years blaming the eggs for ragged peeling but since I've been using this method I rarely ever have that trouble - they are beautiful every time!  With this method I can't recommend waiting to peel them after they have been refrigerated for a time since I haven't tried it. I hope this is helpful .  Thank you for submitting the recipe.

So, I rarely do anything per instructions.  I used this recipe because I wanted to do something savory with eggs.  My minor modification to this is 1 tsp of Salt, 1 tsp ground black pepper, and swap out the paprika for smoked paprika and then kick it up to 1 tsp.  Then add one chopped bread and butter pickle for some sweet and sour.  Best egg salad sammich I have ever had.

Had never added green onion to my egg salad. Totally ruined it.  I'll go back to my old way. Dry mustard, a bit of  sugar with the mayo, salt pepper and paprika.

Made it and it was gooder!  Probably would have tasted better if the rest of my family actually liked green onions.  It was omitted against my wishes.

Delicious and simple. Great for a quick dinner or lunch. I did not have green onion so I used some finely chopped red onion instead and tasted great. Also used low fat mayo. Served on rye bread.

This is an amazing egg salad! I’m 37 and I’ve never liked any egg salad I’ve tried until this. I made some changes. I used slightly less mayo and a whole lot more Dijon mustard. I need to measure it next time I make it, but I’d say probably 1/4-1/2 cup. I also used sweet onion since I did t have any green onions. It was so good I ate it almost every day for lunch that week. Thanks!

Just made this recipe.  It's a great basic recipe and you can add your personal touches.  I used honey Dijon mustard instead of the yellow.  I also added about 2T of celery, and the same amount of onion (I didn't have green onions.) I threw in a couple table spoons of cream cheese, and reduced mayo by that much, and a dash or two of  Worcestershire sauce.  Absolutely delicious!  I may try adding dill next time.

Hello Yall!!! Recipe is nice and good. I used an extra tablespoon of Best Foods Olive Oil Mayo with a tablespoon of sugar also.I like it on the sweet side, tasting like most sandwich spreads.I did not dd salt since most mayos are already salted.
Diced black olives is probably a good addition if you like it on the salty side and to balance the sugar.   
 Enjoy&Cheers everyone!

I didn’t add the onions or paprika and it was the perfect egg salad. The ratio of mayo to egg to mustard was perfect. Simple, delish.

I used red onion as I’m not a fan of green onions. This recipe is so easy and delicious! It also keeps well for a few days. Great idea for meal prep!

my family loves this... I made with 10 eggs, and still think it had plenty of mayo/mustard. kids will eat it with or without green onions (I had only a tbsp or so in the freezer so added those).

It was a very good egg salad! I would add less mayo and more mustard. It was a very good starter recipe and I sprinkled more paprika on top. This would be a good place to start if you wanted to add peppers, celery, or other vegetables. I would definitely make it again with variations.

3.27.18  My favorite sandwich as a kid was an egg salad sandwich (typically what was in my brown paper lunch bag during the summer going to Girl Scout day camp), and even today, as an adult, it’s still one of my favorites.  This is a pretty basic recipe, but the addition of the green onions was new, and I liked it.  Enjoyed today on toasted English muffin bread.

Great base recipe for egg salad. I like dill weed and fresh chopped flat leaf Italian parsley in mine. Like other reviewers, I think the ratio of mayo, mustard and eggs is just right.

I was making it just for myself so I didn't want to make too much, so I reduced the measurements for each ingredient by half.  Had leftovers for two more sandwiches.  I didn't have any green onions, so I left that out and it still tasted good.  Maybe next time I'll add them.

This is a good basic recipe!  I added 2 + times the paprika that the recipe calls for.  In addition, I added chopped fresh English cucumbers, a few slices of sweet white onion instead of green onions, some chopped pickled cucumbers and grey poupon dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard.   I served the egg salad on multigrain bread with sliced English cucumbers and spinach. After these additions/changes I would give the recipe 5 Stars.

I made this exactly as directed except for how I hard-boiled my eggs and I didn't have green onions on hand. As others have mentioned, the ratio of mayo to eggs is perfect. I used smoked paprika as that is what I have in the house and it added a nice smokey flavor to the dish. This is definitely going to be my go-to egg salad recipe from now on!

I made it exactly like the recipe and it was great.  As a kid growing up my mom added dill pickles to her egg salad. I also added them to this recipe and it added crunch without hurting the recipe.

Very good traditional type egg salad recipe. I would add more mustard and chopped celery in the future. Maybe diced dill pickle or dill seasoning. I didn't have green onion on hand and used onion powder instead. I love green onion and believe the recipe would have been even better with the green onion.  I will make this again.

I added tuna and a half a spoon more of mayonnaise to even it out. I also subbed sweet pickle relish instead of the green onion. I also use smoked paprika. Still very good and great job with measurements.

My husband has problems with his teeth so I'm always looking for recipes that I can use for his sandwiches.  I asked if he would be interested in egg salad sandwiches.  His response was depending on what it tastes like.  I made this recipe using "grandmas" tip of mixing the yolk with the mayonnaise first in order to have a creamier egg salad.  It was wonderful and my husband loved it.  The only problem is I continued to dip into it so there isn't much left for his sandwiches.  I guess it's off to the store for more eggs.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

I have made this recipe twice and loved it both times.  Now, based on other reviewers I will be brave  and add other ingredients;  finely chopped celery, finely chopped onion instead of the green onion, course mustard, and others.   With lettuce, tomato and Rye bread, I'm going to love it more I'm sure.

Great egg salad! Didn't need quite as much mayo (Dukes of course) because  I added a tad bit more mustard (Dijon). Green onion was a great touch.  Added a sprinkle of dill weed along with the paprika. Hubby loved it. I'll make again!

Excellent. I prefer deli pickles over green onion so I did that substitution. Perfect amount of mayo/mustard/paprika.

I just made this, and as I'm finishing my last bite I'm very happy with this recipe as is. As others have said this is a great base recipe, great flavor. I do think I might add something for some more crunch to my next batch though as that's what I'm used to and it feels like something is missing without it.

Love the recipe, I did add celery for a little bit of crunch , other than that I made it exactly as stated. Refrigerating it for a while really brought out the flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Great basic recipe, if I am making this for lunches , I put the boiled peeled eggs, wrapped in a couple of paper towels, in a ziplock bag and place in the fridge to make the salad mix the next day. This helps the finished recipe not get so watery! Although this is great as is, I  sometimes add a bit of chopped celery leaves, Mrs Dash  and chopped black olives!

I added Dill Weed, along with the green onion (scallions) and used Boars Head Yellow Mustard...also put some red onion from the farm market.   I used a small mandolin to slice the egg whites, then cross sliced them to make that part go quickly!

Made very good egg salad sandwiches. Left out the green onions due to not having them (but will use next time), used toasted seedless rye bread, and topped with Old Bay seasoning. This is my new egg salad recipe.

This is EXACTLY the egg salad I was looking for. I wanted to make an egg salad that was simple, not filled with tons of ingredients. Because you never know what your guests really like to eat. ( This was for tea sandwiches)  My pic came out dark, but the taste was delish. The only thing I did different was puree the eggs ( chop key) so there weren't any chunks.

A real AH-HA moment! I figured out what I've been doing wrong all this time.. I've been mucking up egg salad with too much stuff!! pickles, celery, etc.... THIS IS THE BEST... just plain simple egg salad, you can taste the eggs, the texture is beautiful. I didn't have green onions only a red so i diced it super fine and its very good. Thank you for setting me and my egg salad straight!!

This is a good eggsalad.  I made it 2 ways, with the minced onion and no onion with celery and onion powder. Both were good, but it is the minced onion that puts it over the top delicious.   Next time I make it I'll try dijon mustard.

Great. I followed the recipe pretty much on point. Just used Dijon mustard and added some baby dill. Delicious! I ate it with some cloud bread. (Keep it low carb) Definitely recommend.

Delicious! I only tweaked it a bit. I added some chopped pickles and jalapeno peppers for a little more crunch and spice.  It was amazing without the tweaks as well. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I didn't have fresh onion on hand so I subbed in 1.5 tsp of onion powder, also I like mustard so I just squirted a ton of that rather than the wimpy suggested 1 tbsp, oh and about 3 tsp of dill relish (I'd have done more but it was what was left of that jar).  pretty good tasting, not great on the breath I'm sure but you knew that going in for an egg salad sandwich.

This is a great base. I substituted with dijon mustard and ground dried onion since I did not have any green onions. I also added paprika, pepper and lemon dill seasoning. Also, a touch of sweet relish. Served it on a toasted onion bun. Yummm!

I liked it.  It's a good basic recipe.  There are a couple of things I find also work:  instead of boiling the eggs, I steam them in a vegetable steamer for about 20 min, they come out very easy to peel.  I use plain yogurt instead of mayo, because that's what I always have on hand.  Then I  add celery to give it a bit of crunchiness.  And it all works out fine.

Been making a similar recipe for years but add in fine diced celery, bell pepper, dill pickle, and other fruits and vegetables.   (Yes, peppers and pickles are fruits.)  Also, use no salt as the mayonnaise and mustard should contain  sufficient and never, ever use white bread in any form.  Suggest the demonstrator does not put finger along the top of knife blade as this action reduces wrist flexibility and takes away the ability to use more pressure when needed when cutting.

This is a good recipe. I like Dijon mustard in my egg salad. Great idea to bring the eggs to a boil and turn off the heat. The yolks never turn dark when you do this. Also, put about 1/2 tsp baking soda in the water this makes them easy to peel. Thanks for sharing

For me this was ok as written, my son ate it with no complaints, just said it was ok.  I made the recipe as written except for the green onions, I added a lil bit of onion powder for those. 

After initial tasting and taking a pic, I needed to do some tweaking to get the flavor right for me. The mayo to egg portion was good but I needed a bit more mustard and a bit of sugar to balance it all out.

This is the perfect recipe for egg salad. Eat it as is or add to it. Make sure your eggs are dry before adding them or you could mess up the perfect portions of wet to dry.

I had never made egg salad before, but after making two dozen hard boiled eggs for a deviled egg platter, I had numerous eggs left that just didn't come out of the shell like they should have. :( I didn't want to waste the eggs, so I thought I'll try some egg salad. Gave it to a friend who is a vegetarian, and she said it was delicious. :) Easy , simple, recipe and no extra trip needed to go to the store for extra ingredients.
I did add some pickle relish , and used Vandalia onion, only because I usually have to add a little something to almost everything I make.

It turned out perfect considering i only was able to use 6 eggs put i cut down a little on mayonnaise and mustard. As for paprika i used the full amount it asked for, and i used salt and pepper. Pepper i used the perfect amount i always like when people say how much they used for salt and pepper so i get a better idea, but unfortunately I didn't measure the amount i used this time. Overall the taste was wonderful after i hard boiled the eggs i take out the inside and put it in the bowl and mash it using a spoon or fork. Next i cut the white of the eggs. I know people who just mush it all together i think you get a better looking appearance of the food by doing it separately. All in all i added to much salt in the end sadly but i know my husband can complain i do not put enough sometimes so we will see how he looks it.

Good! Good! Good!  Made almost as written except just two eggs and a bit of celery. And, of course, less mayo, etc. Eggs are on sale everywhere right now so you know what I'll be eating.  -:)

I made it with all the left over easter eggs from my kids egg hunts.  It's a very basic recipe that I altered to my liking.  I will use this again for sure .

Followed the recipe, except I used dijon mustard because that's what I had, and it was excellent.  I am a huge fan of green onions and it was such a nice addition to the other flavors.

So delicious! I'm 8 months pregnant and I was craving egg salad sandwiches so bad. I didn't use green onions as I didn't feel like it, but I added a dash of lemon juice for an extra kick instead. I used my panini press as I like my sandwiches hot and it was so good! Will definitely make it again!

I really liked this.  I added 1/2 tsp of Dill and a pinch of Lawry's Seasoning Salt.  I divided it in half and added an avocado to one.  Amazing!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe and it was good; however I was hoping for a bolder flavor and not sure best way to achieve maybe stronger mustard flavor or? Also, no second day for this, the mixture turned to water.

So easy and so delicious! I don't know why I don't make this more often.  Takes no time at all (after boiling).  I did find it easier to peel the boiled eggs the next day after being in the fridge overnite.

Made this as an easy quick supper for a weekend when it was just me and the hubby. I tripled the recipe the next time I made it because hubby loved it so much. It must be a southern thing to use scrambled eggs in egg salad, because everyone I know makes it that way. I was looking for a better version and this was it.??

I picked up an egg salad sandwich on a road trip last week that completely devoid of any taste and it left me craving a good one. I made this recipe with 6 eggs but all other measurements as written.  I added 1/4 tsp celery salt and some salt and pepper. The very first bite sent me spiraling back to my childhood!  This is an excellent recipe Wifey! Well done!

I LOVED this recipe!!  I have made it exactly as is before, and it was wonderful. :) 

This time, however, I did make a few minor changes.  I actually tripled this recipe (birthday party!), and I  wanted to play around a bit.  My tripled recipe called for 1-1/2 cups mayonnaise; I used 1 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup plain non-fat yogurt.  I did not have green onions, but I did have a package of chives, so I chopped them up in place of the green onions. 

Also - I have learned that the secret to the best egg salad possible is CELERY SEED.  I added about 1 tbsp or so to my tripled recipe, and I let the finished egg salad set in the fridge for a couple of hours so that the flavors could meld well.  

YUMMY!!!

This was easy, simple, and amazing. The mayo/mustard/egg balance is perfect. I added a little diced celery.  I left out the onion and paprika and added a pinch of celery salt, a few shakes of regular salt, and a few shakes of pepper. It was delicious on plain white toast. I wish my Gram was still here because she would have LOVED this!

This was great!!! Made it for last night's dinner, and everyone loved it. I only added a bit more mustard and paprika and omitted the green onions for onion power. Wish I had had some dill and purple onion on hand to add as well.

This is the basic recipe my Mom and Grandma made though they add 1 T sweet relish.  I also used 1 tsp deli style brown mustard.  Our preference is no onions for digestive reasons though could add dehydrated onion if you like the taste. Delicious!

Awesome Egg Salad!! Just like Mom used to make – simple and with most everything I keep in stock. And another great part about it is that cooks can add/subtract what they want (for their taste). Thanks for sharing such an TRUE "Staple"!

I thought this was really delicious.  I added diced pickles, Dijon mustard, red onions, had no green ones on hand and a little pepper flakes.  I grilled my bread in brown butter.   Perfect light meal after shopping.  My husband who isn't picky and likes everything really liked this recipe.

This turned out perfectly creamy. I did not add the green onions, but I did add dill pickle relish (personal preference). I think I will add celery next time because it does need a little texture. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My family absolutely loves this! I don't add the green onions or paprika though just because I know the kids wouldn't eat it. But just with the other ingredients alone it come out great. Simple and delicious!

I made this for a birthday brunch, and it tasted great.  I followed the recipe, except I read the comment about mixing the mayo/mustard with the yolks first making it creamier.  It was creamy, but it looked disgusting.  So if you're looking for a good presentation, ignore that comment :)

Great basic recipe! I added things like fresh dill and a pinch or two of cumin and chilli powder. I also added about 1/2 of powdered Coleman's yellow mustard, not as tangy as Dijon but more spicy than yellow mustard.

I woke up with a mighty need for egg salad sandwiches,  and this fit the bill perfectly. Just moist enough,  so the bread didn't crumble,  and good flavor. I added hot sauce,  cus to me, everything needs a lil hot sauce.

Made this as directed, with my lone tweak being to double the paprika. DELICIOUS! Creamy and so so good. Let it rest overnight in the fridge and it's perfect!

Good basic recipe.  I added only 1 tsp. mustard, 1/2 stalk diced celery and a little more mayo than the recipe calls for.

I am pregnant and have been desperately craving egg salad since last night. I made this but used Miracle Whip instead of mayo (I'm English living in the states and am obsessed with the stuff :/ )

I used green onions as suggested ( I used a lot) but also added a bit of celery. 

This is perfect!

I didn't really measure the ingredients since I was using a little more than double the eggs called for. But it's basically the same as what I make anyways. But I did add smoked paprika to it since it's the only paprika I had. And I really liked the addition. Will do that again next time.

This was a good start with basics. I did add a finely chopped stalk of celery and changed the paprika to smoked. I started with 1-dozen eggs since dishes like this disappear quick. I also used it on a griddle which was very good as well. I am about to make it for the fourth time now and really enjoy it.

Thank u for this recipe. I only ever made egg salad with just egg and mayonnaise. Boring I know. I was looking to jazz it up a little and found this recipe. I followed the recipe only change was not as much mayonnaise only because I don't like mayonnaise like that. Will be making my egg salad this way from now on.

I cut the amount in half, and only "added" about 2 tbs of green onions. It was simple, and delicious! I will be making this recipe again.

As for onions supposed to be 2tbs or to taste, 1/4 cup is definitely to taste in my house. My only changes/additions: Cabot Greek yoghurt instead mayo, 4 slices of crisp bacon, and the always necessary Texas Pete hot sauce.

This is delicious ~  the only thing I added was chopped celery because I needed a little crunch.  I put it in soft croissants ~ Wow!  My guests loved it.  I will only use this to make egg salad sandwiches from now on.

This was a very good egg salad recipe.  I added celery as suggested and substituted Dijon mustard as suggested.  I also substituted onion powder for green onion.  These changes added the yummy crunch and zip I like.  My family really enjoyed this!

This recipe was easy and very tastey! I only put 2Tbps onions and  I only had 6 eggs. I didn't find that there were too many condiments for 6 eggs. I will keep this on my favorites.

I liked this simple, basic egg salad, but my husband had to go to the spice cabinet and the fridge to  add little bit of this and that  to it.

I loved the recipe for its simplicity, but my eggs were hard to peel, and the bread I used was dry. I recommend a soft bread or toasted, but nothing grainy or wheaty. I made no alterations otherwise. My son loved it!

This is probably the best egg salad ever had! I can't give it that 5th star because 1/4 C of green onion is WAY too much. I used 2 Tbsp of fresh chives from the garden. I think you could add celery and peppers and fresh herbs, but I was so satisfied with the simple recipe version on rye (as suggested by the submitter).

I'm not a fan of egg salad, but my husband loves it. I made this recipe for him, and went nuts over it! It sounds weird, but his favorite way to eat it is in a hard taco shell. To each his own... :)

I made this as written, just made a larger batch. My family all really enjoyed it and I will make it again. Personally, I would add more mustard, some diced celery and pickle relish, and a tad less paprika.

Made this just as the recipe called for and it was delicious! Added a little sweet relish to the leftovers, even better! Perfect proportions, nice and light and fluffy...just what I was looking for! We can't eat enough eggs to keep up with all our backyard chickens produce (family of 5, about a dozen eggs a day we collect). This is just the recipe to use up all those eggs when the surplus is more than we can keep in the fridge! Thanks for sharing!

I added a couple basil leaves and a 1 teaspoon of lemon juice based on another recipe also a handful of cashews for some crunch. I think next time I'll add a little celery. The base recipe is a good start. Also my egg yolks were not all the way done and I left them sit for 12 min. Might try 15 next time.

Great recipe- and you can add whatever you like.  I like to add garlic scares (chopped), and white salad beets for a little extra crunch as well as flavor!

instead of prepared mustard I have used  1/2 tsp dry mustard for years.  Prepared mustard gives too much of a bitter bite whereas dry mustard is more mellow in taste.

I've never used a recipe for egg salad because I didn't think you had to. However, I never liked my egg salad. My son made this recipe yesterday and it was incredibly good. I'll be using this recipe from now on!

We have made this recipe a couple times now, and it is delicious!  After trying it as written the first time, I was happy with consistency and appearance, but wanted a bit more flavour.  All it took was changing regular paprika for smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp of dill to liven it up.  This is a new favourite in our house!

Delicious! I was taught to make egg salad with miracle whip which is also good. For perfect easy to peel eggs every time start with cold water, bring to a boil, cover and continue to boil for 10 minutes then run under cold water.

Nice base. I made a few tweaks myself for the sake of flavor- doubled the amount of yellow mustard and added some dijon and a bit of horseradish, threw a bit of red onion in, added some cayenne to the paprika and, just to round the flavor with a bit more bite, a generous dash of Kikkoman soy sauce. 

Will experiment with peppers and Sriracha soon :)

The only change I made to this recipe was that I added a little seasoned salt to it and I left out the onion. In the future I would probably add just a little more mustard but, otherwise, I really liked this recipe. It was yummy and simple. It serves as a great base for customization or  is tasty as is.

This recipe makes delicious egg salad and also has the perfect way to make hard boiled eggs. I thought it had a bit too much green onion, but that is just personal preference. Otherwise, I think all the proportions of ingredients are perfect.

I made this a few times.  I've never made egg sandwiches before but we were having a lot of people over for an event and needed something quick.  Followed this recipe to a T.  It received rave reviews.  I do use low fat hellman's mayonnaise and add a pinch more paprika.

I'd say this is more so a good base recipe than an full one. Everyone's tastes are different and are bound to want to add new things. As far as a base though, it was good.

This was my first time making egg salad sandwiches. I'd never even boiled an egg before. The recipe was simple, easy to follow, and delicious. I like it with the full amount of green onion, but I do love green onions. I found this to be a fantastic recipe, and in the future, I could see myself adding red pepper or pickles or celery,  but this recipe is also a perfect classic as is.

This is a good egg salad. The second time I added 2 tbs of dill pickle relish and it was even better.

Turned out well.  I added diced red and green bell peppers since I love them so much, and it complimented the main recipe quite nicely.

Let me thank fellow reviewers. Because of your tips this was FANTASTIC! So read the reviews and tweak to your tastes. We used a dozen eggs, added yellow instead of green onion, celery and red bell pepper. Added more Mayo and mustard to adjust to more ingredients.

Made for my little guy who just got a palette expander. Looking for soft foods for him to eat that won't get stuck in it. This was perfect and he loved it! It was my first time making egg salad and I was very happy with it. When Davey gets his expander out I will certainly add other things but smooth and creamy is just right for now. Thanks for the recipe

Delicious as is!  I actually used 6 whole eggs and 6 egg whites (lots of Easter eggs to use up!) and the ratio of eggs to the listed mayo and mustard measurements was still delish!  A dash of salt, pepper, and the lovely paprika and the 1/4 cup of green onions was perfect! I will definitely make this again.  So easy and delicious!

I made this with leftover colored Easter eggs I had kept refrigerated. I halved the recipe for just my husband and me. I ended up adding another egg because there seemed to be too much dressing for my taste. A very basic egg salad to which other ingredients like pickles or celery could be added.

I'm on the have-to-use-up-Easter-eggs bandwagon.  This is a wonderful base recipe as it is.  Because it's such a great base, you can do almost anything with it.  Like some crunch?  Add some chopped celery.  Like a little more tang?  Add some extra mustard, some relish, or some pickle juice.  Want more color?  Add some red bell peppers and/or the aforementioned celery.  A little more heat, maybe?  Pinch of cayenne will do just the trick.  Like dill in your egg salad?  Add some if you want it!  I like recipes like this that taste wonderful as is, but have enough versatility to let you do whatever you like with it and still end up with a great result.

Great egg salad!  The only change I made was to use Dijon mustard as that's what I had in the fridge.  This will be my 'go to' egg salad from now on.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Very simple and easy to follow. My 13 y/o daughter loves egg salad sandwiches. I told her she could learn to make it and she tried this one. She loved it and her friends love it as well, since she has made sandwiches to take to school with her.  We added a bit of Tabasco sauce just to give it a bit of a kick.

This was so good!  I Tom some recommendations from the other reviews and chopped up a stick of celery and a pickle spear and left out paprika.   I love it. Just what I was looking for- a basic recipie for egg salad I can build on.

My mom loves egg salad but never likes the store bought pre-made egg salads. I made this for her and she loved it! The taste is very nice and mild, and not too pickley which she doesn't like. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good but I used smoked paprika and I think it could use a bit more flavor in it. Maybe celery. Very nice on white bread or cracked wheat

Easy and simple egg salad. Delicious as is and easy to jazz up. I like my egg salad with very basic flavours that do not over power the taste of the egg. This is perfect. Thank you for sharing.

First time making this and it turned out great! I like how simple it is and the versatility the recipe has. I added some lemon juice with the mixture at the end and it gave it a nice twist. Overall I really liked how it turned out, bravo!

First time and turned out great! So easy and yummy! Only thing I'd add would be some minced onion or celery for crunch. Also, a little bit more mustard wouldn't hurt.

Love it! Classic egg salad with a good balance of flavor. I used spicy brown mustard and doubled it, and a sweet onion since I didn't have green!

A very delicious egg salad.  I love the "adjust servings" feature which was changed to a single serving;  the amounts were correct. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and combined the hot egg yolks with the mayonnaise and it did make a creamier egg salad. Also I substituted sweet pickles for the onions (another reviewer's suggestion) because I did not have onions. Delicious!

For my first time making it, I halved the ingredients for a two person portion and added chicken and white onion. I put it through the blender for around forty seconds to retain the texture - this worked very well and it was absolutely delicious!

My only comment would be that even halving these ingredients made enough for 3-4 people, but if you're looking for some leftovers for the next day, that's not a problem at all.

I love the Whole Foods egg salad but it is ridiculously expensive. This is a perfect substitute, and best of all, I can make a large batch for less than $3, probably 1/4 of the price I'd pay at Whole Foods, and that is using organic ingredients. WF is not organic.

This recipe is a classic and delicious as is, or with your favorite additions as some reviews have written. I boil my eggs for 10 minutes and rinse in cool water before peeling, it doesn't work for me as directed in this recipe. I use fresh brown eggs from a local farm, I can't believe the difference it makes from store bought white eggs.  The yolks are very yellow and the eggs taste great!  This is my "go to" recipe every time I make egg salad.

I'm one of those picky, texture people. I don't ever use celery or raw onion so this recipe is perfect. I didn't use green onion. So creamy and good.  Wr put this in our cooler on our road trip to Niagara falls. Perfect for sandwiches at rest stops!

I made this today and the name says it all, delicious!  This is the simple egg salad I grew up with.  I didn't have paprika, so I left it out. I used regular onion as well.  I put it on a French baguette.  I think it would pair well with two cans of tuna fish packed in olive oil.

I added a stalk of celery to make it a little more substantial as a standalone salad instead of putting it on bread.  Turned out great that way (doubled the mayo and mustard).  Makes a nice, crunchy low carb cold salad.

I didn't have any green onion in the house, so I used yellow onion instead. Also, Dijon mustard tastes much better in egg salad than yellow mustard, in my opinion. I made a bunch of different samples of egg salad (having no choice, but to alter this recipe a bit with the lack of green onion). I used different ingredients in each sample. So far, my favorite combination is Mayo (I used "Just Mayo"), dijon mustard (Grey Poupon) and paprika. Although, I also really like the combination of mayo (again, I used "Just Mayo"), dijon mustard, yellow onion and dill weed. I would not recommend using curry. I tried it and didn't like it at all.

This recipe is very good, and I make it often for lunches, but I much prefer to use a fork to mash up the boiled eggs instead of just chopping the eggs.

This is the ONLY way to enjoy a true egg salad sandwich.  My grandma taught me this recipe over 60 years ago.   Now I use a steel pastry cutter to chop the eggs....saves lots of time when making potato or macaroni salad too.

It's definitely a good recipe to get you where you needed to be! I used miracle whip instead of mayo and added a half cup of salsa to give it a little bit of zip! Came out great!

Pretty basic recipe, was very good. I added a tbs of relish to mine and turned out really good. I might add some chopped celery and red onion next time.

This is the tastiest egg salad I have ever eaten.  My mom introduced it to me, and I seriously cannot get enough of it.  Super delicious! :)  Just an FYI, I didn't have green onions, so I just used a chopped up yellow onion.  Next time I'll try with the green onion to see if the flavor is much different.

OMG this is so yummy!  I used 10 eggs, substituted white onion for the green onions because I love onion and added 1 celery stalk.  It's my new favorite recipe!  I like the combination of mayo to mustard.  Thanks!
Update: I just realized I forgot the salt/pepper. But it turns out I don't need it! It's SO GOOD!

I'm not a huge fan of egg salad but I had a lot of eggs on hand that I wasn't sure what to do with.  I really enjoyed this recipe and will certainly make again.  I didn't have any green onions so I used 2 tbsp of red onion and I followed CrazyCatLady's suggestion and added some dill.

Just made this and was pleasantly surprised. Great base recipe. I'm not a fan of egg salad/sandwiches at all but needed to make some sandwiches to give away. I lessened the onion to about 2 tbsp or 1/8 cup only to be safe (in case some of those eating it aren't fans of onions). I think I might give egg salad a second chance after this.

This is my second time making this salad. My partner loved it and I thought it was great. No additions needed, perfect as is. I always use fresh bread, good butter, shredded iceberg lettuce and extra salt and pepper on the sandwiches I make. My partner actually had these sandwiches for dinner at home after a day at the park with the kids and I. He told me he liked egg salad and after I made him one, he scoffed it down and promptly asked for another. It lasts 2 or 3 days at the latest in the fridge in an airtight container.

This is my go to egg salad recipe.  I first made it as written and it has a great blend of flavors.  I have made it a dozen+ times since. My husband gets a hankering for egg salad and this is the recipe he wants.  I typically add a dash or two of cayenne and a tablespoon of dill relish. I don't have any problems with it turning runny when it is stored in the fridge.

Finally, the perfect egg salad recipe!  I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted to make 2 sandwiches and didn't want loads of leftovers, but I wish I'd made the full amount. the egg/mayo/mustard ratio is perfect, and I love that it leaves optional additions like parsley, paprika, dill, pickle relish, etc. as optional additions. Sometimes, you just want a nice, simple egg salad, ya know?

I just made this but it tastes to much like plain eggs and mayonnaise. As is it doesn't taste very good. I added 2 globs (is that a measurement?) of ranch dressing and just a little vinegar to tame the onion taste. That made it taste a lot better. :)

Delicious and plain 'ole egg salad. Nothing added to take away the simple good flavor. Probably like our Moms made it back in the day. I just added some chopped celery which I usually do. Had on some lightly dressed baby spinach. Light and healthy!

Great base egg salad. I cooked 6 eggs and deleted 2 of the yolks. Light mayo worked fine. A grated garlic clove added a bit of flavor. Otherwise, I like it w/ yellow mustard and the listed seasonings.

This is a great basic. My husband loves egg salad. I have an Instant pot that I cook a dozen eggs in every week. I always have hard boiled eggs on hand.

He likes this with sweet pickle relish added in. A mountain of baby lettuce from the garden, all piled on an onion bun. I have to admit, it tastes pretty good.

I have made this many times. before without the green onion and I absolutely love it. The paprika adds a great flavor. Next time I will definitely try it with the scallions.

The recipe is very good... Something I've added to it, are green olives on the side, they go along perfectly with it. 

I've used them for years as a garnish on my deviled eggs (Just cut them and put them on top), and they go real well with this sandwich. If you have people in your household who don't like them, obviously just put them out as a side, but if everyone likes them just chop them up and add them to sandwich itself.

I was making this for my son's lunch, but I myself am not a fan of egg salad. Therefore, I was a little squirmy about taste testing it. To my surprise, I liked it. I did decide to add a Tablespoon of finely chopped celery because I do like some crunch and I think I do like it a little better, but the basic recipe is excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

Warm egg salad on soft bread... this tastes just the way "mom" used to make it, only even better with the green onion. The mayo/ mustard ratio is perfect.  Will definitely make again!

It's a lot like a deviled egg base recipe, but I love the green onions in stead of pickles. So easy and simple and yet so delicious. My kids ate it and my husband had seconds, so it will definitely become a staple in our house. Thanks for this recipe!

Exactly what I needed - Perfect texture & flavor, 'classic', not 'gourmet'. I couldn't find a suggestion for the Salt & Pepper, so I used 1/2 t Salt, and 1/8 t Pepper, 1 green onion. I was able to double easily, thanks to the exact measurements above. Loved it!  Thank you Wifey! pm

Great recipe. I tried it with miracle whip, and I did not like it as much as with mayo. If I could, I would make this all the time.

Used pickles instead of onions and although I love pickles, the crunchiness was a little jarring. Otherwise DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe as is the first time and it was great. The second time, I added cayenne pepper to spice it up for my husband's incessant desire for everything to be spicy. Definitely a keeper.

Super yummy!! I didn't have green onion so I put in celery and diced pickles. I also added just a tad of cayenne as my husband likes a little heat. The star of this recipe though is the ratio of egg, mayo and mustard :) love it on white or potato bread.

On my own at 57 yrs old, never boiled an egg and look, I made lunch.  Very simple but tasty egg salad sandwich with toasted Arnold sandwich thins (whole wheat, flax and fiber).  Now let's open a bottle of merlot.  Yum yum

This is a very great base! I took out the onions because I just want that creamy smooth texture.  I added another two teaspoons of mustard. Being that I am from Maryland, I added two tablespoons of Old Bay.  My husband wants more already!

I made this exactly according to the recipe. I've never made egg salad before and I don't eat it often so I don't have too much to compare it to, but I thought it was a tasty basic recipe, a keeper that could be made this way all the time or could be tweaked for variety. I ate it on sandwiches with lettuce and white bread. Yum!

Love this recipe!! Left out the onion and mashed the egg yolks in the mixture and then added the diced egg whites last. It's delicious and simple.

I used green olives instead of green onions & garlic mustard instead of yellow. Perfect portions of mayo to egg! I thought this was much tastier the next day! Great to make the night before.

I loved that I could use this recipe for the basics and then add or subtract as needed.  I used another reviewers suggestion and used cream cheese (actually neufchatel for fewer calories) along with the mayo to retain creaminess.  I added a little pickle relish for flavor.  It was great!  My first attempt at egg salad and I really appreciate this recipe for making it a success!  Thanks!!!

My husband has been asking me to make this for YEARS.  I didn't like the sound of it and never had it before, so after 30 years ... I gave it a try and he loved it!  Guess I will be making this again soon.

Very tasty and so easy. I made a hallf sized recipe and added a touch of horseradish sauce for a little heat. Used relish instead of green onions.

This'll probably be my "go to" recipe for egg salad now.  I thought it was pretty tasty.  I did add celery due to preference.  And based on another comment I read I mixed things together while the egg yolks were still warm.  I do think it gave the salad a creamier texture.

Egg-cellent!!!! I added a few things like celery, fresh dill, red onion, and topped the toasted sandwich bread with heirloom tomato slices and red leaf lettuce. It was so scrumptious! A great alternative for dinner during Lent.

I have always loved egg salad and was surprised to find how good it was with a little mustard and green onion mixed in!  This has the perfect ratio of eggs, mayo and mustard and I took the advise of another and mixed cold mayo with the still hot yolks.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks!

I use dill in mine.  To Tanaquil, sometimes the onions and celery make it watery because of their water content.  Wrap the onions and celery in a paper towel to absorb some of the water.

Thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich! Most egg salads seem to have too many "crunchy bits" and that always makes me leery to try store bought or pot luck style salads (I guess its a texture thing!) My kids loved this too. They said it tasted fresh and sweet.

Loved this recipe. The base recipe is wonderful, and the proportions of ingredients are just right. I followed the suggestions from two reviews: I added the mayo to the warm eggs, substituted dijon and added some celery. Thanks :)...Sherry

Very tasty as written, but I use 2 T of finely chopped green onion and 2 T finely chopped dill pickle.  Omit the salt.  The pickles are salty enough, and this addition gives the salad a tad more flavor and crunch.

I have used this recipe for over forty years I sub the mayo with Miracle Whip (picnic friendly) and add a couple of teaspoons of sweet pickle relish even sometimes add leftover bacon crumbled up !!!

This is a great recipe. I have made hundreds of egg salad sandwiches in my day. (I cater receptions) It is almost the same as mine. The only difference is I use Miracle Whip not Mayo but that is just a personal preference.

Lovely basic egg salad recipe. Love it on fluffy white bread. d. Try making it with Miracle Whip instead and it'll have the zip you're craving. I've never liked celery in my egg salad, but a little green onion or chives is just wonderful.

this is a great base recipe but I like to add chopped celery, chopped vidalia onion, finely shredded carrot and a tablespoon of sweet relish.  Zucchini relish is the best.  Add as much or as little of the carrot and relish to suit your taste.  The carrots and relish add colour and flavour.

Just perfect! I wanted an egg salad recipe without a lot of other things in it, and this is exactly what I've been looking for. I didn't have green onions, so I substituted a little yellow onion instead. I love this with a little bit more paprika. Thank you for the definite keeper!

It was great, I went with fat-free mayo and added a little bit more green onions. I forgot to pick up the peprika though. I also went with sour dough so yes the bread was bigger but I just cut it in half and toasted it. It's definitely worth trying with a decent sourdough!

This was simple and good. Perfect for those days when you you don't have much time to cook. Would be great for picnics or finger foods. 
It tasted just like the egg salad my dad would fix us on those days he had to cook for us :)

Just finished an egg sandwich with this recipe.  I have been under the weather, so I just couldn't find anything that sounded good enough to bring me off of my sick bed.  This seemed quick with fairly limited effort, so I drug myself into the kitchen for the soul purpose of enjoying a delicious egg sandwich.  Ok, so there was no wow! factor for me, but it was tasty.  I will make it again in the future with some modifications.  I did leave out the salt as I have to watch salt in my diet.   Other than that, it was made by the book.  I think it needed some dill, or very small amount of sweet relish to give it just the right taste for me.

First time making egg salad I made almost as-is (left out the raw onion), second time used a little cream cheese and chopped celery - what a great way to use up eggs - great to take to work as a potluck with some pita bread - thank you.

This was a really good, simple recipe. The only thing I changed was the green onions, because I didn't have any.  I substituted with a few chopped slices of banana peppers for a twist.

Husband loved it!  I am not an egg salad eater but made it for him and he said throw your others out and keep this.  I used dijon mustard instead of yellow (my husband is French)and used onion powder instead of actual onion as he is not a big onion fan.  Easy to make and I'll take that any day!

This is a good basic recipe. I was concerned about the comments about it getting runny because I was making ahead for sandwiches for a ladies tea party. I followed the advice of another reviewer and did half mayo and half cream cheese. I also used freeze dried chives instead of green onions. I made too much for my tea and the next day it is still not runny and still tastes great. Keeping this recipe with those changes.

So good!  I accidentally put in a tbsp of mustard as opposed to a tsp by accident (yes I had been drinking and I read it wrong) but I think I liked it better that way.  Thanks for this!

great base recipe with perfect ratio of mayo and mustard. To accommodate my low carb/low sugar diet,I added about an ounce of caramelized onions to replace the sweetness of sweet relish I would normally use. Loved it!

This was so delicious! I made it according to the recipe. If you don't like onions in yours, I can see finely chopped celery for the added crunch. Very easy recipe!

Great recipe base for egg salad. I didn't have any mustard or paprika but I did sub a pinch of curry in its place and thought it was great. Can't wait to try it again with mustard and paprika

Good base recipe, made some minor changes though.

Horseradish dijon / celery / smoked paprika / cilantro / dill.  Turned out fantastic, herbs were from my garden, and spices from penzys, not the store bought old dried out spices.

Just made this recipe and it is so delicious. I added about two tablespoons of dill relish an I put in about a table spoon of mustard because I love mustard. Also I used cayenne pepper. I estimated measurements I may put in a tiny bit less mayonnaise next time. Great choice for a recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.  I added nothing more than the recipe called for and it was absolutely perfect!  You can always add extra veggies if you have the time.  The combo of ingredients in the sauce will make anything taste good.  Thanks for sharing.

this egg salad is actually very delicious!...i did substitute the green onions with bacon bits...to give it a little bit of crunch and just because i don't care for onions in egg salad. spread this on some toast and add a tomato...and yum yum! thanks for the great recipe. will be making this again.
a great quick and easy lunch.

Yum! I had a ton of hard boiled eggs and got a craving for egg salad. This is the best combo and amount. I did add some celery and dill, but before I added it, it was yummy! My husband is looking forward to having some for lunch tomorrow.

This was really good basic egg salad.  I added celery for some crunch, might also chop some pickles to add next time.  Used white onion instead of green.  Ate on whole wheat bread with some romaine lettuce.  Very good. Will definitely make again.

Definitely a great "base" recipe for egg salad!  I know what I like in an egg salad, but needed some general measurements for the base ingredients like mayo and mustard and this recipe was perfect.  I ended up adding in some chopped dill pickle with a little bit of pickle juice added in as well, onion powder instead of green onions (I didn't have any) and a little bit of garlic powder.  Loved the paprika in this too!

This is a quick and easy egg salad.  I enjoyed the variety of flavors.  Egg salad does not have to taste like eggs mixed with mayonnaise and this recipe proves that.

Made this the other day and I have to admit that it needed a few adjustments.  First, the egg boiling method threw me for a bit of a loop but I tried it anyway.  Eggs came out okay but the yoke was much darker yellow than I had expected.  They seemed firm enough but maybe I needed to let them cook a bit longer.  Ended up letting the whole thing sit for a day and it did fine, but when tasted the whole thing seemed rather bland.  Ended up adding some salt (which improved the taste even though I added a little too much) and still needed something.  Remembered that my mom used to put relish in her egg salad and that was what I was missing.  Didn't have any on hand so made due with chopping up some dill pickle slices and it was better.  Going to make it again (with proper ingredients on hand) and will probably let the eggs boil for a couple of minutes before taking them off the stove.

This is a great recipe that is perfect as-is, but also lends itself well to tweaking. I used light mayo instead of regular, and dijon mustard instead of yellow. I also added some chopped celery, ground coriander, dill weed, caraway seed, and a small splash of worchestershire sauce. YUM!!

This was simple, classic and delicious! I was trying to think of things I could make for my husband's lunches this week and all of a sudden egg salad popped into my head. This was the first recipe that sounded good and contained basic ingredients I already had at home. The result was perfect!

Delicious, I used pickle relish instead of the onions and more mustard (Dijon) than called for. I added dill and parsley to mine.

The Egg Salad Sandwich tasted delicious! I made it for the first time today and it tastes just like I have always had it at parties. I recommend refrigerating the mix a few minutes before putting it on the bread because that is better than room temperature. Great recipe :)

This is a great recipe for the ratio; however, I like less mayo - so add only 1 Tablespoon of mayonnaise AND 1/4 cup sour cream or 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt. 1/4 cup of Yellow Mustard. Add a scant teaspoon of Vinegar. Add a dash of Celery Salt. If it is too "liquidic", then use 10 hard boiled eggs instead of 8. (f you do not like green onions, then substitute celeryOR chopped dill pickles)

I love this recipe! I don't always have fresh onions handy to chop up in it, but I always use a squirt of spicy brown mustard and it adds just the right kick to make the sandwich stand out :-)

I leave out the onion and have found that the mustard is a little overwhelming. Additionally, it takes a bit longer than recommended here for the eggs to finish boiling. Otherwise, this is great.

This is a delicious, simple recipe. I ran cold water over the eggs to cool them, but would probably leave them in the fridge overnight next time after boiling for easier peeling. I omitted the green onion and added 1 diced up stalk of celery instead. It was wonderful, and I will definitely be making this again!

If you like classic egg salad this is perfect.  However, I did add a little finely chopped celery for texture and crunch.

My husband and I thought that this was just ok. It is very simple and does not have a lot of flavor. I give this three stars because it is a good base for egg salad. I will try this again but next time I will put more mustard in it as well as some relish.

I love basic egg salad without celery. I read the recipe wrong and added 2 tablespoons of yellow mustard!! OOps it was still really good though.  Great for a couple days worth of lunches.

I'd give this three and a half if possible - it's an awesome Base - but not really great as is.  It's just bland as written.  The second time I made it I went made it about 1/4mustard and 3/4mayonnaise - and replaced the green onion with relish.  This was a great improvement - but next time I'm going to make it half mustard and half mayonnaise for the base.  (in other words 1/4 cup of each).  I'll also probably double the paprika - or add a 1/4 tsp of chili powder or cayenne - something to give just a tiny kick.  I'll let you know how that comes out. It was definitely better with more mustard and the relish the second time around. This is a great base - but be ready to experiment (though that's half the fun or a recipe to me)

This is my first time trying this recipe and I absolutely love it! One thing I might suggest before putting the egg salad on bread - refrigerate it for awhile to let the flavors mix and the salad to become more firm.

Egg-cellent recipe!  To add a bit of a different flavor I added some celery seed and left out the onion, otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Amazing!

Great recipe! I didn't have any onions, so left those out, and used spicy brown mustard.  Great on toasted bread with fresh baby spinach.

I love this recipe.  We love egg salad sandwiches.  Try adding some finely chopped celery to it for a little crunch.  I would give it a little less paprika.  Also finely chopped dill pickles are great mixed into it. dlawfromidaho

An excellent recipe that I have made for years. I have experimented from time to time and now use Dijon mustard rather than yellow. A little more zip. Also, as others have suggested, I sometimes add celery for a little extra crunch.

Very simple and good recipe. I would suggest doubling the paprika.  After removing the eggs, I placed in the refigerator to speed up the cool down process, or else the eggs are hard to peel

Chris and I made this one night during the week, (Actually I made this and Chris supervised!) and it came out awesome!!! It was super tasty!!! I took the leftovers to work the next day and it was just as good as the night before.   As for the directions on how to boil the eggs, the way the author of this recipe instructed did not work. The eggs we only partially cooked. We suggest keeping it on the burner for 15-20 minutes. It allows for easy peeling and a well cooked egg.   As many of the other cooks that reviewed this delicious recipe suggested, we too added small chunks of dill pickle.   We will most certainly will keep this easy and mouthwatering recipe handy!!!

This was just so-so for me. I've never been a huge fan of egg salad, but I will eat it on occasion, hence my desire to try Wifey's recipe. The taste of this was decent, but it didn't WOW me. I love my mom's deviled eggs (a passed down recipe from my Grandma), so I tried to incorporate a few elements of her recipe with Wifey's. Although my attempt did not turn out as expected, it didn't "ruin" the outcome either. My only change (again, to mimic my mom's recipe) was to add another t of (plain) mustard and 4 t distilled white vinegar. Oh, and I added one small rib of celery, mainly because I wanted to use it up. I've been eating this on wheat bread with a slice of Boston lettuce for lunch so far this week. It is certainly simple and satisfying but, I don't think it will be a repeat with me. I guess I don't like egg salad that much after all. Thanks for sharing :)

This was my first egg salad to ever make and it turned out pretty well. I agree that is really a good base salad- but you need to add more to it for crunch and color. Overall we enjoyed it and will likely use it again as a base.

Recipe was easy and very good.  A little to much mayo for my taste.  I would recommend adding the mayo slowly until it's at the right consistancy.  I tried the scallions and diced them, since I'm partial to relish, but I thought it tasted good so far.

This was good and I liked the added bite of the green onions. I put in a ziploc in the fridge to eat for lunches and it came out great - not runny like another mentioned.

I've always winged it when making egg salad so can never be sure how it will turn out.  Decided I needed to be more consistent, so I chose this recipe as a a touchstone.  It's perfect.  I find that I like adding a couple tablespoons of sweet relish but otherwise I don't usually change anything (unless I don't have green onions on hand, in which case I finely mince a couple tablespoons of yellow onion). Very good served in pita pockets with lettuce.

I loved this recipe. I added a bit of creole seasoning, extra green onion (love green onion!), and some dill weed. It's absolutely delicious.   Thanks for the recipe! :)

Very good egg salad. The paprika makes it a different colour than some egg salads, but that's ok. Great on 12 grain bread with a crispy lettuce leaf on it. Thanks!

I had to come back here and edit my previous review... Just have to add that I made this again, but this time, I made my own mayonnaise, too.  Super terrific yummy great!  Love this recipe!!  I really loved this and found it a great way to kill the inexplicable egg salad craving I've been having lately (I hate eggs!).  Only thing I did was add some bacon pieces to the leftovers.  Very nice with or without the bacon.  :)  Thanks for sharing!

just made this. used less mayo, and spicy mustard instead of regular mustard. also used more mustard than the recipe called for bc i like the tang. the green onions gave nice color but 1/4 cup was too much of a raw onion flavor for me. overall i found it to be okay.

I'd never had egg salad before because it just looked so gross but I decided to make this for my husband so he can have a different sandwich for lunch.  All I can say is that it was fabulous!!!  This was sooooo good.  I didn't use onions because I can't stand them so I used onion powder instead.  Dee-li-cious!

I LOVED this recipe. I also substituted dill pickle instead of green onion since that is what my boys prefer, and the result was a comment that all moms love to hear! "Wow Mom, that was delcious! Can I have another!" (And trust me, my boys are picky eaters!) I even decided to make a second serving with hard-boiled eggs I had made to use for another event. I will definitely put this recipe into my 'keepers' file! Thanks wifey!

Simple and tasty. I didn't take the time to add onion...didn't miss it at all.  I've made this with both mayo and "salad dressing", and I think I prefer the salad dressing:  a bit more tang and reminds me of deviled eggs.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I used light mayo. (I find that light mayo has a creamier and richer taste than low fat mayo - where you need to add lots more mayo - adding lots more calories to the food.)

I rarely follow recipes for egg salad--I generally just add whatever and taste until I'm satisfied.  So I used this recipe as more of a jumping off point.  I used about 10 eggs instead of 8, but I used about the same amount of mayo.  I used a lot more mustard, but I love the flavor, and I also love paprika so added more of that as well.  I used pickles and cucumber for crunch and didn't have green onions.  I also tossed in a bit of parsley.  I served as finger sandwiches at a volunteer appreciation event at work, and they were completely finished before the event.  Other sandwiches were served as well, but the egg salad was by far the most popular.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous egg salad! I cut the amount of mayo (used lite mayo), added dill weed, and just a toss of lemon juice and it came out delish!  A local deli makes egg salad, and this one tastes nearly exactly like it! They serve theirs on egg bread with swiss cheese - something I might try next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is the perfect mix of ingredients. For years I would just add enough "looks good"; this removed the guesswork ;-) I didn't have mayo but used salad dressing and it was great!

I did add couple tbs of lemon juice since it was too thick.  Pretty good overall.

Really good recipe, I added pickles instead of onions and i added 1/2 cup instead of 1/4. I put it on some bread, it was sooo good. This recipes a keeper.

It seemed way too creamy...and I used 9 eggs. Is it possible to "over stir" egg salad? lol Maybe it was my fault. Still yummy, thanks!  Update: I found it actually was better after being in the fridge for a bit; it helped solidify the mixture.

This was the first time that I had ever made egg salad.  I added horseradish to it to give it some extra zing..and loved it!

I was really in the mood for an egg salad sandwich. This really hit the spot.  My only complaint was that it was a little plain.  I did add some dill weed and I liked that.

Threw a sandwich wrap party and this was the topping everyone loved the most. I used japanese mayonnaise (as its cheaper than american here) so I added a little sugar to it. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for. Very basic but very good. Celery would be a nice addition however since I didn't have any on hand, I sprinkled in some celery seed for the flavor. Very good, Thank You!

(much better than PB&J)

Not bad.  A little too much mayo for our liking, so we'll cut it back in the future.  My mom's recipe back in the day used regular onion and she always added pickles, which we all loved.  Easy to change to your liking.

Really good. I only used 1 egg yoke for every 6 eggs to cut down on the fat content. Adding celery would probably be a good addition. Got runny after a day.

I use this recipe all the time and make sandwiches with the "Italian Bread Using a Bread Machine" recipe from this site. This doesn't need much salt but I do add plenty of black pepper. If I have red peppers or celery I throw those in too. Make sure to check out the "Divine Hard-Boiled Eggs" recipe on this site for instructions on the cold-water start method for hard-boiling the eggs.

Very good egg salad! I omitted the green onion, and added a few tablespoons of dill pickle relish. I think next time I'll use just a little less mayo. Was too creamy almost...a little runny.

This recipe was good...I thought it could use more mustard and less mayo and will try that next time.  But it is mostly because I am a huge mustard fan!  I also love onion so next time I will add more of that.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good.  My usual way of making egg salad is with mayo, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  The green onions were a good addition, but you really couldn't taste the paprika and mustard.

I made this egg salad two nights ago for dinner. I don't eat egg salad often but my brothers really liked it. I added about 2 tablespoons of extra mayonnaise because my brother loves the stuff. Great recipe!

This was good but I still prefer mine better. I used mirical whip not mayo. I liked the green onions but I don't think I prefer the mustard.

This is good and very easy!  I used onion flakes and then added about a tsp or so (a few shakes) of Woostershire Sauce.  Yummy!  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe file!
