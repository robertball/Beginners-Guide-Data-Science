Love this recipe....though I increased the almond flour and skipped on the coconut flour.  I have made it a few times before and coconut flour makes the batter very thick....more like cookie dough.  Was always doubling up on the wet ingredients....so this time left the coconut flour out.  It was awesome.....very light.  Will keep making it...Family loves.

These were very yummy hotcakes. I eliminated the salt, meringued egg whites in order to avoid dense hotcakes, and I used only almond flour. 
I also enjoy my hotcakes with a smear of almondbutter and sf syrup. 
I have already added this to my keto folder and I look forward to making these again!

Please do not use a tablespoon of salt. I can only hope that's an error. I should have known better than to use even half that. I don't cook. This is all new to me. I also used Chinese five spice with the cinnamon. Would have been wonderful without all the salt. My ankles are going to swell today. Use maybe a half a teaspoon of salt!!!

I made this. The salt measurement has to be wrong. They taste like salt biscuits. The texture is edible, so I'll try these again, but what a disappointment.

It was very good.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used sour cream thinned slightly with milk, then added a scant 1/4 t. baking soda.  I was afraid it would taste really eggy with 6 eggs in it but  it made the right consistency and texture.  My husband even liked them!  Next time will add a few blueberries!! Note: Dry ingredients measured up to 1 1/2C dry mix in case you make up a couple batches dry to have on hand like regular pancake mix.  Not sure of shelf life though.

I made this just as the recipe specified.  I have made paleo pancakes before and although they tasted great, they were hard to "flip" and heavy.  I didn't hold out much hope for these.  I was amazed.  They were sooooo fluffy and flipped just like a boxed mix or non-keto recipe flips.  My family loved these and we will definitely be making them a weekly item at our house.

These came out super thick.  Not tasty.  Sadly I'll probably end up throwing a lot of them out.  I made them exactly to the recipe.    Then,  I did add almond milk to the second half after I realized they were not good.  I think those will be better.  No one wanted to try another one but the consistency seems better with the added liquid.

Absolutely delicious!!! A keeper! Can't be without. I usually make two or more batches and put in the fridge to have ready for a morning breakfast. My husband loves these as well and he is the most picky eater in world!!!

I omitted the coconut flour and increased the almond flour accordingly.  No sweetner added and the pancakes turned out fluffy and savory.

Not bad. I’ve tried several Keto pancake recipes now and this is one of the better ones. Though I can’t seem to get away from using almond flour and the grittiness associated with using it. But love being able to eat pancakes!

I must say after going without any type of breads this recipe was a big treat.  I did do a little tweaking but used a ingredients listed.  My tweaks were 1/3 cup heavy cream instead of 1/4, 1Tablespoon swerve instead of 2, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg also added.  My husband said... Yum!

Kids loved these. I added more sweetener to sweeten them up just a bit more. This really hit the spot. I hadn't had pancakes in so long.

For keto, these are good! You can make waffles out of them too. I top mine with a couple tablespoons of butter and a quarter cup of raspberries. Waffles are much easier with this batter. You kind of have to spread out the pancakes to get them to be flat like pancakes. This is because of all the fiber in the flour. It absorbs the liquid. You cannot let this batter sit. It will thicken if you do. Immediately pour it into your waffle maker or make the pancakes.

As others have mentioned the coconut flour does cause the batter to thicken up quickly. I usually add a little water between batches to keep the consistently to what I want.

I was afraid the texture would be weird, but they are fantastic! Very fluffy and the taste is better than regular pancakes. I used trivia for the sweetener, didn’t have swerve. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

These were delicious.  I was out of heavy whipping cream so I used organic plain yogurt and I added two teaspoons of psyllium husk to them.  I am going to try them without or a smaller amount of sugar to use to make a sandwiches.
