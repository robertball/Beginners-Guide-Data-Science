I actually changed this recipe quite a bit.  I used all 8oz of cream cheese, 3/4 cup XXX sugar, 1/2+ peanut butter.  To thin out the peanut butter mixture I added just a splash of milk (1-2 T).   I also used  about 4 cups of heavy whipping cream instead of the frozen stuff, I think it has a better flavor and consistancy for this recipe.  After that was whipped up I folded it into the peanut butter mixture and filled the pie shell.  Wonderful recipe!  Hope these suggestions help out!  Thanks for sharing.

I found this pie to be very peanut-buttery and rich - almost too rich.  I definitely wouldn't agree that it needs more peanut butter and less cream cheese.  Also, my filling came out pretty fluffy.. if it doesn't, maybe the problem is your folding technique?

When I put the filling in the pie shell, it looked really empty, so I made another batch of filling and made a nice full pie (it was overkill though - too much to fit in the pie shell).  I think next time I'll just put the rest of the tub of cool whip on top, and then top that with the peanuts.. it'll look nicer, fill out the pie, and cut down on the richness.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars if those had been the instructions.

Oh - I also added mini chocolate chips to the top for a little different flavor.

**This is an update since I first wrote this review.. I looked back at my recipe, and saw that I had written down 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of 1/3.. not a huge difference, but that could be why it was very peanut-buttery.

My oldest son and I made this peanut butter pie together. We made our own graham cracker crust from scratch. After spreading the filling into the graham cracker crust, I drizzled a little chocolate syrup over the pie before sprinkling with the chopped peanuts. Though this pie is good, it needs more cream cheese and peanut butter--both for flavor and to fill up the pie crust a little more. If I make this again, I'd increase both.

This is an exceptionally good pie!
But I would recomend doubling it to make it a nice thick pie.

Delecious peanut butter cream pie, I love peanut butter and creamcheese so this is such a perfect dessert in my books! I made a lower-fat version (low fat cream, low fat cream cheese, splenda etc) and it still turned out great so I'm sure the full fat version  would be even more amazing. :)

Absolutely wonderful!  Have made it 2x for work and everyone loves it.  Am making 2 of them tonight for a coworker who doesn't even like peanut butter that well but just loves this pie!  I substitute grated chocolate on top in place of the peanuts for a little difference

I made this with a chocolate graham crust, and I ended up having to add another cup of Cool Whip ("extra creamy") because there wasn't really enough filling. This was SO good! Not too sweet, not too rich, but surprisingly decadent and satisfying. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

The taste is ok but the filling wasn't enough to fill a pie- I had to keep adding more and more measurements to fill my pie. Good base recipe...

Awsome recipe! I allready had a frozen pie shell in the freezer so I baked that for 15 min, let it cool and used that instead....It turned out well but I could imagine it would be better with a weightier crust, like graham cracker :P ....I also topped it with sliced Bananas which made it pretty and helped balance out the sweetness a little. I found I had to double the recipe to fill the shell aswell.

Deliciously yummy! I used 1 brick cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2/3 cups pnb, 2 cups cool-whip, and a chocolate cookie crust. Perfect amount of filling if using a ready made crust. Layered the remaining cool- whip on top and shaved chocolate and sprinkled on top with finely chopped nuts.

I made this for Christmas Dessert .. because of how rich it is instead on making a pie I filled the pre-baked fillo dough shells, drizzled chocolate and added green and red M&Ms.  Big hit and great finger dessert  food.

I made a few changes to this recipe: 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter (instead of 1/3) and add 1/2 cup of milk. The crunchy peanut butter gives the mixture texture and a bit of color so I don't bother with sprinkling anything on top. I was having trouble finding my original recipe so I went looking for it online. I love my original recipe so much that when I found where I had misplaced it, I had to share it. It's very easy and I've always gotten great feedback!

I was aske to make this pie for an elderly couple and I didn't want to give it up after tasting the filling.  I made a few simple changes for presentation.  I used 8oz of cream cheese, 2 Tbs of canned milk, 1 8oz tub of frozen whip topping 1/2 for the filling the other 1/2 for the top.  Hersheys syrup drizzled on the top with the peanuts.  Awesome and easy to make.  It took less than 30 min.

This is great and can be made lower in fat by subbing in low fat ingredients without sacrificing the taste.

We melt chocolate chips and do a layer of chocolate on the pie crust, let it sit a few minutes while preparing the filling, then drizzle the rest over the top of the finished pie, instead of the peanuts.  I'm sure you could still use them though

This pie was awesome but I made changes. I used a full 8oz cream cheese and 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I used a chocolate crust and spread a layer of cool whip over entire pie. I also garnished the top with mini peanut butter cups and drizzled hot fudge and peanut butter over the top.  I know that was changing pretty much the whole recipe but it was to die for. The pie was so creamy and the amount of peanut butter was just right. Brought to my office party and it was gone in no time.

We first made this pie the way the recipe said than we decided that there was too much peanut butter for us so instead of using a graham cracker crust we used a chocolate cookies crust and sprinkled so of the remaining crust about 1/4 cup on to the top. It turned out real well and my family justed loved it.

Not bad.  Not great.  It was just like peanut butter fudge in a pie shell, only a little less candy-like and a little more filling like.  It wasn't the light and fluffy texture I was hoping for.

Very easy to make.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup as it was too sweet for my taste.  I topped it with chopped peanut butter cups.

Yum delicious.  Made it for the band supper fund raiser.  I used a chocolate crust and added a little Cool Whip topping.  Doubled the ingredients as suggested by others and it filled the crust nicely.  Thanks for an easy pie with great taste and looks.

next time I will add a couple TBL. of milk as the filling was very thick. Also I might add a little less peanut butter and a little more cream cheese as the cream cheese flavor was lost.
