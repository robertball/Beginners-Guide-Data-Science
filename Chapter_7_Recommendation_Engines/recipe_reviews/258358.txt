Very tasty, simple breakfast recipe. It’s easy to add whatever you like to this one. I added bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, a little cheese on top, and hot sauce.

It was delicious! I added Sausage, and sour cream with chives for garnish and avocado slices on the side and breakfast was awesome!

Great recipe, I added cheese on top because cheese is the perfect topping to any dish.

Great starting point.  I added peppers; a couple varieties.  And topped with cheese, chopped tomato, and cilantro.  Next time I’ll add ground sausage too!

Delicious! I used coconut oil in place of the olive, and added some Muenster cheese at the end, just long enough for it to melt in. This really helped add flavor I think. Next time I’ll garnish with green onions.

Everyone really likes this. I don’t use any oil at all, I wait to drain the grease after the potatoes and onions are fully cooked. I then drain the vast majority of the grease and add bacon and the eggs. I think I would like to add some fresh sliced mushrooms to this next time (but my son wouldn’t eat it if I did.) Other than that, the recipe is great as is and it’s pretty easy to make.

Made it exactly, except I sprinkled thyme and Lawry’s Seasoned Salt on my potatoes. Also, after I put it in a bowl, I sprinkled shredded cheese, squirted some Sriracha all over, and topped with sliced avocado. So yummy!!!

I make potatoes like this all of the time but had never thought to add the egg in with them. Great idea! Super simple and perfect for those breakfast for dinner nights too.
