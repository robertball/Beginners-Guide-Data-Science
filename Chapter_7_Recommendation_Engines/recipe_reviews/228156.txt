No need to buy those expensive cuts of meat!  I bought an 8 lb pork shoulder roast for $1.19 per #.  Trimmed off the little bit of excess fat before putting into cooker, and I turned it over every couple of hours because it was so big.  End result was juicy & tasted great.  This made a huge amount - at lest 36 servings- and cost less than $10 for the meat. It freezes well & if you freeze it flattened out in a freezer bag it thaws quickly & makes a good last minute meal.  Eat it on buns or not,  have extra bbq sauce for those who like lots of sauce.

Soo here's stumbling through this recipe ;-) End result was great. However getting there was like getting Little Red Riding Hood to go to Grandma's ;-) And I grin on this because, I made everything on this recipe, from scratch...no kidding. Went for dry onion soup mix, was out...came to AR, got the recipe and made it..YES! Then was out of BBQ sauce, crud-ola'! Okay made that too from scratch as well, thanks to another AR'er here named Georgi, that's a dear friend of mine, and gave me a recipe she's been making for 30+ years, and it was prefect, just made enough to complete this recipe. It's all good, had I had just the basics already, when I was making this..it couldn't have been any simplier. The only draw back I saw, was this morning, when pulling the meat out to shred it, was the meat on the very bottom had scrotched and I had to discard those pieces. I could have easily put on low and been able to save some of the meat durning the night by moving the meat around to prevent that, but that wasn't the case. Do watch the meat closely. However, the recipe turned out great, even though I had to take additional steps to get this recipe done. And it was worth it because my family asked for me to make it again. And I have soo much. This batch makes alot. I also used boneless country still ribs verses bone in because it's what I had purchased. There wasn't much discarded or wasted at all. TY it's a repeater.

This is a really good, no fail, simple crock pot recipe that I've used many times.  It's one I always point newer cooks and party givers to.  Over time I've developed a couple of tweaks based on experimenting with other recipes.  I usually use about 1/2 of a large bottle of barbecue sauce (at  least 12-16 oz), 8 oz of non-diet cola (plain ol' Coke works best), and the onion soup mix to cook the meat in.  The cola adds a little sweetness and helps to tenderize the meat. When the meat is done, I drain off the liquid, saving it, and shred the meat and put it back in the cooker. I pour about a cup of strained reserved meat liquids and the other 1/2 bottle of sauce over the meat and mix well. Let the meat heat through about 30 minutes more. Serve additional barbecue sauce on the side. The key is to taste your end product after you shred the meat and add more sauce to your family's taste.

Made this using a 6.5 lb. package of Pork Shoulder Boneless Country Ribs. Followed the recipe, but used more BBQ Sauce in the initial mix due to my larger amount of ribs. Added a heaping teaspoon of Harissa (Chili Paste) and let it cook in the slow cooker all day. I did not add the full amount of BBQ Sauce at the end of shredding. We don't like our pork swimming in sauce. I did not add it back into the slow cooker for the second time. It was time for dinner and once shredding was done - I served this. Easy. Good. Worked great! Thanks for the recipe!

I have used this recipe a number of times and love it.  I live in Moscow, Russia and this recipe gives me a taste of home.  I love anything I can cook in in the Slow Cooker.    I have learned that my Slow Cooker cooks hot so I have to reduce the time to prevent overcooking.  alike the previous reviewer I also make my Barbecue sauce from scratch (thanks to AllRecipe cook SUZANNE2802).  My question about this recipe is what is the need to use a second bottle of barbecue sauce? What do you do with the sauce placing into a bowl after cooking the meat? There is plenty of Barbecue sauce left.  Could it not be placed back in the Slow Cooker after pulling the meat?

You discard the sauce when removing from crockpot because after cooking it will have too much grease/fat in it.
This is the reason you use a second bottle of sauce with a little water added to it.
I use Cattlemens BBQ Sauce, and I always add a little bit of water to it for drizzling.

I have made this many times. I donâ€™t bother with onion soup mix- too much salt! I slice a couple onions, place part in the bottom of the crock, add a couple ribs of celery. This keeps the pork roast off the bottom of the crockpot. Place pork loin roast on onions and celery. Season roast with black pepper and garlic. Top with the rest of the onion slices. Cook on low for 8 hours. Remove roast and celery. Drain excess liquid if desired. Shred pork and leave onions with it in crockpot.  Add a bottle of barbecue sauce and reheat for about an hour.

This came out sooo good!  I used to only use a boneless pork roast which was dry and didn't pull apart very well.  Adding the ribs made a huge difference.  I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce.  I bought a pre-cut coleslaw kit and let it sit for an hour in a little mayo and apple cider vinegar.  The tartness of the slaw was a perfect complement to the sweetness of the meat on my sandwich.  I also put a few Wickles on top.  Heaven!

Too much hassle. Not easy and have too pour ingredients in another bowl. I like it cooked in the crock and served out of the crock, and kept warm all day.

Really loved this recipe! At first I was hesitant about the onion soup mix. I was afraid it would be too salty. It really turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

no need to discard those juices, let them sit so the fat rises and slide them in the freezer for half an hour, they solidify the fats on the top and you can skim it off leaving all that tasty juice

I LOVE this recipe. It's my favorite food now, and I've made it at least a dozen times - it never fails to please a crowd. I usually serve on Hawaiian rolls with some cheese. 
While it is perfect as is (the bbq sauce that you use will make the most difference), over the many times I've made it, I've  tried a few extra things. Toss in some minced garlic, your favorite spices. Yum for days!

Cooked it too long and chops shrunk up. Next time will cook at 350 for one hour. Should have checked the chops.

It took longer to cook than stated in the recipe. May have been the size of my crockpot.  It was simple to make and very flavorful when completed. My 23 year old grandson loved it and my son in law wants to know where his is.  I used my vacuum sealer to freeze the extra servings.  A thumbs up, for sure.

This turned out really delicious however, next time I would use  boneless pork spareribs with the porkloin roast. I was very worried that little pieces of bone would remain in the sauce that could cause a choking hazard.

Making this was easy but it lacked flavor. I used a bottle of Kraft Hickory Smoked barbecue sauce. I do think it needed maybe some brown sugar or molasses? Next time I will do that.

Easy and fantastic! I cook almost everything on my Weber Kettle BBQ, and this was no exception. I placed the meat in the sauce (I used home made sauce and I omitted the onion soup mix) in a dollar store aluminium pan and cooked it on indirect heat at 300 degrees with lots of smoke (sage and hickory wood). It took 5 hours to get the meat to fall off of the bone, and I only added fuel twice. I did not use a loin, and instead opted for just ribs (pulled). My wife and I served it on sweet Hawaiian rolls as sliders with slaw and dill pickles ;)

This was an easy, quick prep. I used a pork roast and boneless ribs. The results were moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe as written. I used a 5 qt. Oval cooker, and I thought it might burn on high.  It didn't.  The only change I would make would be to add 2 bottles of BBQ sause instead of 1 in the ingredients list.
  It's not clear at first that you actually need 2.
