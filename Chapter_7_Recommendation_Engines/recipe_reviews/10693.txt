These should be called plain "Almond cookies". I'm a chinese cookie or cake "monster" and am sorry to say that these are far from being chinese. Two things for sure, if they would be chinese, lard would have been used instead of butter and of course yellow food colouring would have been added.
Although very easy to do this recipe, I find that these cookies are very bland, they lack a certain pizzazz. I guess I'll have to keep on searching the web for the real chinese almond cookie recipe.

Not the most authentic Chinese almond cookie recipe, but they're pretty good and certainly the closest I've found thus far.
