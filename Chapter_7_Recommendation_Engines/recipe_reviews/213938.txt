i liked it ok but loved it after i made some changes. first i left out the oil and water as they were not needed. i poured 1/4 of the beer in a glass oven pan then 1/4 can of chicken broth to follow. then placed the chicken in the pan surrounding it with red potatoes(quartered), baby carrots, and half an onion (sliced), poured the remaining beer and both over it all. then i seasoned the chicken and vegetables with pepper, garlic powder, seasoned salt and zatarans. then i zested the orange on top of the chicken, poked holes in the orange then put it in the opening. i followed the baking instructions and it came out awesome, although the vegetables may need to cook a little longer(remove chicken and cover, cook veggies 15 mins at 450 for electric oven) its a must have at least twice a month in my household!

I make Roasted Chicken all the time and this recipe was boring and really had no taste. With the two temperture changes, and it being covered the first hr., it did come out moist. Moist is always good   but, bland is not. For those who have not tried this yet,,,add some spices of your choice and I'm sure it would get a better rating.

I love chicken. Never tried a chicken recipe I didn't like, but I "loved" this one. All I added were 2 tsps. of minced fresh rosemary. 1 on the chicken and 1 on the vegi's.

Making it again tomorrow night - my husband loves it and it makes great sandwiches too.  

IMPORTANT NOTE... I have tried this recipe with different lager's and it makes a BIG difference in the taste. You need to use a lager with "bite" too it - if you can not find FostersÂ® then the green bottles usually work and are easier to find in the  supermarket.

Like many others I added fresh herbs (Sage/Rosemary/Thyme) for a bit more flavour.  We stuck with the oil as it increases the browning. To stick with an October/Halloween theme we used "Vampire Maple Lager!"  It was quite strong to drink but for this chicken it was superb.  We will definitely make this one again.

A bit bland even though I noticed the other reviews and added fresh rosemary, oregano and sage. And it needed way more salt and pepper than I thought. I used Blue Moon beer which goes really well with orange and I thought that aspect turned out pretty good. Tasty, but add seasonings!

I liked this recipe, but not much flavor right away. It tasted better the next day.  Next time will try adding more spices, but will definitely make again.

I have to admit...I never liked mixing fruit with meat, but thought I would give this one a go. Very moist but also bland with the exception of the very slight  sweetness from both the lager and the orange. This one is not for us.

I used a lemon instead of an orange and zested it first for coating the outside of the bird.  I also used a hefeweizen instead of lager (lemon and hef is a natural combo) I also threw in some sweet potatoes instead of carrots and used boxed chicken stock instead of the bouillon cube.  I would recommend a cast iron dutch oven as the cooking vessel if you have it.  It works really well for this sort of recipe.

This was amazing. My husband thought it was the best chicken I've ever made. It was really easy and delicious.

The chicken was moist and tender, which was great. But I have to agree with some of the other reviews in that this recipe was a bit bland. I even added some oregano and it was still a little dull. It was a good dinner, but kind of lacked the wow factor.

I made this but added seasoning to the chicken when I made it, and added fresh rosemary sprigs all over. It was very yummy!

This one is a good base, but it's a little bland. The orange was a nice twist instead of traditional lemon, but we didn't get any of the beer flavor (I used Sam Adams Boston Lager). The veggies didn't have much flavor and the chicken could definitely use more than just salt and pepper.

Absolutely delicious, I read the other reviews and added a mix of rosemary, sage and thyme. Also used Guinness black lager. It was absolutely wonderful. Even the vegetables were a hit! Made gravy from the drippings - yum!

We used a session IPA and lots of rosemary and orange zest coating the outside. Some Salt and pepper. Garlic, parsley, and orange inside. For veggies we did blue potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and onion. I think cooking it covered at the lower temp helped keep it from over cooking. It was moist and juicy and even made great leftovers after feeding 6.

This recipe is a good starter. Agreeing with what most reviewers said, it needs lots more seasoning. Personally, it is very rare that I follow a recipe like this to the letter. I view recipes as a guide for the most part. For this I used Shocktop (since it has hints of orange in it) and soaked it for 24 hours. I sprayed the veggies of choice with my WeightWatchers mister and seasoned both meat and veggies w/ - Paprika, Trader Joes Everything Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Salt and Pepper. Amounts to your tastes. I then misted the chicken with sprayer and baked as suggested (for the most part). I only roasted 1/2 a chicken.
