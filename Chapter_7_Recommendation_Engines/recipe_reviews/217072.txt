this recipe was delightful, simple to make and beautiful results!  I followed the rosewater substitution that you provided and it worked beautifully.  Unless you're making enormous meringues, I would guess the yield is closer to 20+ per batch.  These were perfect for people trying to avoid high fat, white flour or gluten.  The guests all seemed to really enjoy these and they were very easy to make.  Thank you.

i used 2 Tbsp of rose syrup instead of water or extract and just accounted for it by decreasing the water.  so easy and such lovely delicate flavor.  thank you for this wonderful recipe!

The flavor is out-of-this-world amazing!  However, I had trouble keeping my meringues from browning.  I lowered the temp to 225 and still they got toastier than I like.  Hence the 4 stars.

Ohhhhh, Chikalin, thank you for this unique, special and yet soooo easy recipe!  I had just bought a bottle of rose water on a whim, having no idea what to do with it and then I happened to come across your recipe referenced on a Passover dessert blog (no flour!).  I folded in a couple of handfulls of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I ended up with 15 quite large cookies, would have made them smaller but I was too lazy to take out a second cookie sheet.  they are lovely, yummy, sophisticated, and different.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!

This Cardamom Rose Meringue recipe is a keeper! I love the classical Persian flavors of rosewater and cardamom together. I replaced the rose extract (2 teaspoons) with rose water (2 tablespoons) and reduced the liquid in the recipe (water) as per the Cook's Notes. Thank you Chikalin for sharing your recipe.

Superb!!  Made approx 60 mini rosette.  Very delicate, light pink, airy...  Like little fairy cookies!  The cardamon is the finishing touch! Serving these with our Birthday Tea at work!

Yummy! You have to love the taste of rose (did not have rose extract, sub with rose water) to enjoy, others in my family said it tasted like soap.  However I will make again for myself and those that did enjoy!
