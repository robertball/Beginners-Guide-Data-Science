Awesome!!! I did add some black beans and corn, and finely chopped kale to mine for added nutrition and fiber. After baking   I topped it off with a big dollop of Greek yogurt...yum!! I will be making this again and again while my garden is producing my yellow zucchini.

This was delicious!!! I added sour cream to the rice mixture as well as shredded cheddar and shredded mozzarella since I didnâ€™t have the cheese the recipe called for.

I added ground breakfast sausage as we did not feel like vegetarian that night.  Will definitely make again.  I made homemade Mexican rice as I need to watch my salt intake.
