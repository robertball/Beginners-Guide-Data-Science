This sounds nice as a marinade, but it is nothing like Worcester Sauce.  Where is the tamarind, the anchovies, cardamons etc.  I have a recipe that I have been making for years and it rivals the original Lea & Perrins.  It is quick to make, but has to be left for a month before straining.

This is simple to put together with ingredients that I usually have around the house. I used tamari soy sauce to keep it gluten free. I like the idea of a Worcestershire that is fish free too. The only thing iI didn't care for was the cinnamon. I thought that was too evident. I ended up making a second batch without the cinnamon completely and I liked that so I mixed them together. This was better for me. I also added a bit of tapioca powder to help it thicken. This is definitely a sauce to keep handy. Thank you mlally for your recipe.

After reading other reviews, I made this by not including cinnamon, and cutting back the vinegar to 2T., because I could always add more if needed.

This version, with 2T. vinegar and no cinnamon worked out perfectly.

It tastes like too much apple cider vinegar, even the smell. I agree with the previous reviewer that the cinnamon should be omitted. It's a weird flavor/smell.

I liked it, even though I made some changes to the ingredients and didn't add a lot of the powder things, but I don't know what the proper kind if actually supposed to taste like, so... yeah.

I tried this reciep last weekend! It works well! Because I am from China, the garlic, onion and mustard powders have nowhere to buy, so I replaced them with  chopped garlic and onion and it turned out amazing. I didn't add mustard product, because it is pretty spicy here. I did add the cinnamon powder, I think it increases the flavor, not like the hot comments said. My sauce is not thicken as the picture shows, but it is enough for me to dip eggs or any veggies!

The sauce itself wasn't terrible, but it didn't taste anything like Worchestershire sauce. It actually reminded more of a weird teriyaki with lots of vinegar. But I'm giving it 1 star because I was hoping for something resembling a Worchestershire substitute, and it didn't fit the bill.

Smelled wonderful while simmering and tasted good with our steak. I added a tablespoon of fish sauce to add more flavor.

I recently moved to Belgium where you are lucky to find one kind of Worcestershire sauce.  My husband is allergic to fish, so I decided,to give this a go.  So glad I did, I may never buy it in the store again.

This doesn't have the ingredients to make Worcestershire sauce. It's more like a marinade of some type.
