Dish is easy to put together and tastes like it came from a good Chinese restaurant. I made it with whole wheat spaghetti noodles. Will definitely be a repeat! Thank you!

My husband & I loved this recipe!  I didn't have spaghetti noodles, so used fettuccine noodles instead.  If I did this again, I would increase the noodles to 8 oz.  The pasta was gone, and we still had meat and sauce left.  I used ground turkey in place of the ground beef, doubled the snow peas, used 1/4 tsp. crushed red chili  and added about 1 C julienne carrot strips.  I made the sauce exactly as stated, and wouldn't change a thing next time.  We'll definitely be making this again!

This was good. I had some ground beef and no idea that appealed to me.  I don't eat ground beef very often and I was just not sure how I wanted to prepare it, I found this recipe and tried it. I thought it was very good. I had about 3/4 lb meat and used angel hair pasta. I would make this again

So good! Easy to put together once everything is chopped up. Leaves room to add more heat if you like. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty! Even my picky hubby said the recipe was a keeper! I used different veggies. It was the perfect way to use up  cauliflower and mushrooms. I used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti. the flavor of the sauce was more prominent.

I substituted ground turkey and topped the fish with chow mein noodles for a crunch. Delicious! This will be in our menu rotation often.

I made this exactly how the recipe was written. It was excellent.  The sauce is so flavorful; like something from a really good Chinese restaurant.  The vegetables came out great too and really complimented the dish. I was so happy that there was plenty of sauce with these measurements. I would highly recommend.

I didn't have snow peas so I added thinly sliced carrots and a cup of frozen peas a couple of minutes before recipe was removed from heat.  I think the most important thing I did was use an organic high grade ground beef and drained off the fat. The flavor was excellent. The sauce was great and easy to make ahead of time.

I liked this recipe.  I thought it was too sweet and will not use the brown sugar next time.  I had to add more water to loosen the sauce a bit but will make this again.

The snow peas were not available yesterday so I made carrot matchsticks instead. We all loved the colors and the sauce.

This recipe is delicious.  The sauce is very well balanced and flavorful.
I didn’t have snow peas, so I substituted Frozen green peas instead.
I also had a yellow pepper that needed to be used up, so I tossed it in, too.
Don’t skip the sherry, it adds a unique flavor to Asian food, which is incredible.

Who needs chinese take out!!! This was super good. I used frozen oriental vegetable mix(Unseasoned) instead- other wise followed the recipe. A winner for sure
