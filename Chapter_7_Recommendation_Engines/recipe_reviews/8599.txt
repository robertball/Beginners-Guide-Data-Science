Nice basic "casserole" dish to make. However I changed this recipe quite a bit. First I am vegetarian so I omit the chicken. Because the recipe calls for 3 cups of vegetables to begin with and most people said that it's not enough I usually use 5-6 cups of vegetables. I use everything from broccoli to mixed veggies to corn basically whatever I've got in my freezer at the time. Also I cook the biscuits while making the stove top portion then when the stove top portion is done I dump that into a serving platter/baking tray and put the cooked biscuits right on top. Now it's ready to serve without needing to be baked in the oven.

This was delicious but next time I'll use an 8"x8" dish and half a can of biscuit dough or else double everything except the dough. There wasn't enough of the chicken mixture for a 9x13 pan.

I cooked the biscuits a bit before adding the "casserole" mixture to it so it wouldn't be soggy. I also added some carrots and potatoes (already cooked) to make it more filling. I didn't think that this had enough flavor and it did take a while to prepare. I will make again but tweak the spices to suit our tastes. Thanks for the post.

This is my favorite casserole!! The mustard and sage give this great flavor. It's also good with cooked carrots and onions added-it bulks it up and also adds more healthy veggies. My family doesn't like casseroles but LOVE this one. Try it. Yummy!

A BIG hit for the whole family! Only changes I made were I added minced garlic to the pan w/ some canola oil to saute the chicken cubes then removed chicken and proceeded w/ the margarine flour etc..AND bc I was making about double the amount I threw in a can of cream of mushroom soup but added the other ingredients as written. Soooo creamy and delicious and easy!

This recipe is DELICIOUS. Got a 'mmm this is GOOD' from the boyfriend instead of the usual 'yeah it's alright...'. Forgot to buy the mushrooms and greenbeans but I'm sure this would make it all better. I would definately agree about baking the biscuits separately then adding them together later. The only thing was I had trouble making the flour/butter mixture melt into the milk - it stayed clumpy throughout...Still good though....THANKS!!!

Yummy! I used canned mushrooms green beans and cubed potatoes. Increased the cheese and used Bisquick. Everyone liked in my family. The only problem was the biscuits were still doughy after 14 minutes.

I thought this was wonderful! My family could not stop raving. I read the previous review and doubled up the recipe so that it would work in a 9x13in. dish. Still used the one can of biscuit dough. Very tasty and lots of sauce to go around. Reminded me of a very easy chicken and dumpling casserole. Next time i may cut back on the sage a wee bit. I doubled it and thought it was a little strong. However the rest of the family thought it was great that way and it didnt seem strong to them. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe. My 12 y/o son loved it! I made a few substitutions to the original recipe. I used a can of chicken broth and 1/4 c. Coffee Rich creamer in place of the 1-1/2 c. milk and 2 bouillon cubes. I also used frozen broccoli 1/2 an onion sliced and baby carrots instead of the beans & mushrooms. This is a definite keeper.

Very tasty dish and easy to change to your taste. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the recipe but I made my own biscuits and cooked them separately. I used one can of cream of chicken soup with added milk to make the 3c of liquid and omitted the bouillon. I also omitted the sage since I didn't have any and added some fresh broccoli and topped with extra cheddar (though i'm sure I added more than the recipe stated for the sauce). The sauce was really creamy and yummy! Will definitely use this again!

Excellent recipe. As did some reviewers preceding me I made biscuits and served them alongside cutting out the baking entirely. The mustard and sage add a nice depth to the test although I felt that the bouillon was a bit too much salt for my taste. I would halve it next time. All in all a great-tasting recipe that is simple and quick to make.

This was good and really easy. I used broccoli in place of the green beans and it was really good. Next time I think I'll at LEAST double and maybe triple the gravy chicken and vegetables though as there wasn't NEARLY enough--it barely fed my daughter and me. If my husband had been home that night we'd have been in trouble!:-)

Not the greatest...the bisquits were very soggy underneath and the green beans weren't cooked enough. Reheating the next day was even worse. Next time I will follow the suggestion of cooking the bisquits seperate. Reheating the next day was even worse.

What a fast and tasty meal. I took some shortcuts and used canned green beans and mushrooms. This dish can be prepared using different veggies and I want to try it next time without the cheese. I am sure it will taste great. My family really enjoyed this casserole.

Absolutely Perfect! I didn't have refrigerated biscuits so I made the Bisquick biscuit recipe and spread that on top. Perfect the first day or re-heated days later. (Biscuit mix doesn't go soggy.) Also I boiled the chicken breasts for the most tender/moist chicken. A keeper for generations to come!

I cooked the mixture for about 10 minutes longer than it said (before putting into the casserole dish) and the green beans were still crispy. Maybe would be best to use canned or pre-cook the green beans. I also used a half recipe of drop biscuit dough on top rather than the refrigerated biscuits so the sauc to biscuit ratio was good and it cooked just fine (sort of like a cobbler). Overall good flavor but I'll have to make some changes before making it again.

My Hubby loves this recipe! I make this for dinner and then he takes the leftovers the next day for a "cream chicken sandwhich" We love it! the only thing i do different is i dont add the mushrooms... not cause i dont like them just cause they kind of get lost in the dish so theres really no reason to add them.

Mmmmm this was really good! I didn't have any sage so used some thyme and marjoram. We also aren't big green bean fans here so I just added some cooked/cubed red potatoes to the mix. I doubled the recipe as was suggested and I used the flaky layers biscuits baked for 10 minutes beforehand. The kids loved it which is always a plus!:)

Was tasty but I would precook the biscuits to keep the bottoms from staying mushy and use a smaller baking dish. I will try this again.

Just as advertised... chicken cheese and biscuits in a cassrole. Good down-home comfort food. I replaced the green beans with broccoli. I found I needed a little more milk added (my mixture got too thick) and that it fits best in an 8"x8" pan. Don't even try a 9"x13".

This was gobbled up by two of us for dinner no leftovers. I made it in a 9x9 Pyrex casserole and used a small (4 biscuit) can of biscuits. I split the biscuits in two to be sure they got done. I used a pint of home canned green beans drained. I also used a mixture of chicken broth and milk and added one packet of Swanson's Flavor Boost. The sauce really did taste like cream of mushroom soup but was homemade!

This was a nice change from chicken pot pie. I didnot have ground mustard so I added about 1 1/2 tsp. honey mustard. Also I added diced carrots and canned green beans I would have added more veg. but my DH would never have gone for that.

Oh man! I saw this recipe and honestly wasn't sure about it. I was a little worried the biscuits would basically turn it into a mushy-nastiness casserole. I was definitely wrong. I improvised a bit. As suggested by other comments I added a can of cream of mushroom doubled the sauce ingredients (I didn't fully double the milk and flour since I added the soup) and added garlic. Sauteed the mushrooms roasted/pulled dark meat chicken and used frozen broccoli. Flavors were perfect! There are a couple things I would do differently next time. I think I'll add more chicken broc and mushrooms to add more filling. I might also cut the biscut dough in half and basically make a thinner biscuit crust on the top. the biscuits are a good idea but even with the sauce doubled it was still a bit too dense and bready for me.

This has been a family fav for about 20 years. I sub frozen carrots for the mushrooms. You can either do biscuits as directed or slice in half and stand up along the outside of pan. This makes it more attractive.

As it's written this is pretty bland. I was looking for something with the ingredients I had on hand and since the weather is cold right now I thought it would be a good option. In my opinion this needs a lot more seasoning and I try to stay away from too much salt. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cooked the biscuits about 80% beforehand. I added salt-free spice mix and more bouillon plus a few drops of Sriracha but it didn't improve it much. I won't be making this again.

This is a weekly standard in my household! It's such a great basic recipe that lends itself very well to tweaks. Some times we throw in some corn sometimes diced broccoli sometimes thin roasted ham! One caveat the biscuits can be very doughy so I find it's best to use the widest shallowest casserole dish possible and make sure the biscuits are torn very thin.

I like this recipe a lot. I used asparagus and pre-made baking powder biscuits. I heated the biscuits separately and then put them on for the last 3 minutes. I also used chicken broth and milk and only one bullion cube.
