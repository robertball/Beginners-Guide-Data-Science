Was easy to make and since the first review said it was a tad dry i added a can of enchilada sauce to it. I'm not big on this type of food but would make it again for something different.

This was actually very easy and very good.  I wish there would have been more sauce to go on the top and I needed to use a bigger baking dish because the tortillas were too big.  Other than that, very good and the flavors were right on.

It's really good. My family really likes it. Like one of the reviews said. It does need a bit more water then it says in the recipe but besides that. Really good.

Yum malicious! Great recipe! Wouldn't change anything except load on the cheese at the end! Everything is better with lots of cheese! Great for a family meal!

This recipe was pretty good. I like that the sauce is creamier than some tomato base sauces in other recipes. Only change I made was using salsa instead of green chilies because I had that on hand.

This was a nice change from traditional flavored enchiladas. The only change I made was slightly less cayenne pepper since my kids are not into spicy foods. These had a unique flavor. The mixture filled 8 8-inch tortillas.

My whole family of picky eaters loved this. I followed the recipe as written. Very easy, however, it was a tad dry. i think i will add a little more liquid next time. otherwise, very easy, very good.

I followed the recipe exactly but cut it in half and used corn tortillas. Very tasty and easy to put together.

Didn't have green onions,  substituted 1/2 of a yellow  onion diced. Also substituted red kidney beans for  black because that's what I had. Delicious!!

It was very good....and filling. I made as stated....but had no green chili's so I also subbed Rotel. My only future change would be to make double the sauce part (2 cans soup, etc). But the flavors were great!

The taste was excellent! The only problem was it was a little spicy for my 8 yr old so next time I think I'll take the taco seasoning down to 1/4 cup. I always leave out cayenne pepper anyway so that wasn't the problem. To make it healthier, I use whole wheat tortillas, plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and ground turkey instead of beef.

This was amazing!  It's amazing as written but can be modified to suit your taste. I've made this with shredded chicken, added chopped bell peppers to the onion saut√© and subbed a drained can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies for the chopped green chilies.   All were excellent, especially with extra cheese on top!   Thanks for a great recipe- this is definitely a keeper.

Good recipe!   I used a can of drained Rotells in lieu of the chopped chillis because I didn't have any.   I also put chopped black olives over the top.

I loved these!  The recipe was easy, but a bit time consuming.  I followed the recipe exactly except cut the cayenne in half in hopes of serving this to my 2 year old, but still a little spicy for him.  I will definitely make again!

My family loved this!   I make my own cream soups and used my homemade cream of chicken instead of mushroom and omited the marjoram because I didn't have any but otherwise made no changes.  I had taco sized soft tortillas and used 10 of them.  I will be making this again...thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent enchiladas!  Perfect just as they are written.  I made these for Christmas dinner along with chicken enchiladas and these were gone long before the chicken.
