This was really good! I made it with a chocolate graham cracker crust and added a thin layer of chocolate pie filling (chocolate pudding) to the bottom before adding the peanut butter filling. I added a bit of vanilla to the filling and skipped the extra whipped topping and the peanut butter cups. My husband is absolutely in love with this pie and says he wants one a week!

To make this even more decadent, freeze the pie after you spoon the filling in the crust. After it is frozen solid, add a layer of hot fudge sauce before adding the whipped topping.

This is a great and easy recipe.  Sets up much better than other peanut butter pie recipes I've tried which turn out way too soupy.

This is the one! My coffee crew devoured this in less than 30 minutes! Extremely quick to make. It was the best. I choose to use an Oreo crust as I'm a chocoholic. I doubled the amount of peanut butter.  It was plenty rich without using extra sugar.  Everything else was the same amounts. I did add 1/3 of a 12 ounce jar of Smuckers HOT FUDGE sauce to the bottom of the crust. Do not use chocolate syrup. It is too thin! I also drizzle some on top. You have to melt it to drizzle as it is very thick. This is the 2nd recipe I tried in the last 3 days. Everyone asked for the recipe - even the guys! Kudos for recipe!

This was a wonderful pie. Light and airy, sweet with the light salty flavor from the peanut butter. Now, the next time I make this, I will make sure it refrigerates over night. Two to 3 hours just doesn't hold up every well. I only got one nice standing piece out of the pan, the other peices flopped on the plate. I guess I'm glad it was just for my family. But all in all it was simple to make, flavors were great. And it diffently makes your mouth water.

Made this last night and it was a big hit! The whole family loved it (9 people)! I made a few changes based on other reviews and my personal preference. I upped the peanut butter to 3/4 cup, used only about 4 oz. of whipped topping on the top, and put a layer of hot fudge on the bottom of the crust before putting anything else on it. The fudge added a LOT! I drizzled some on the top too. I froze it and we all liked it better that way. Before eating I pulled it out and let it thaw for a few minutes. The fudge was gooey and so yummy on it! I will make this again and again!

I used an Oreo choc. crust and then shaved a Hershey bar over the top.  Beautiful presentation. My Father swore this is his new favorite b'day treat.  Easy to make, great taste, will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I made this exactly as written, because I was hankering for something dessert-wise to eat. (I ate the whole thing in 3 days.)
I thought this was pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of things with cream cheese in them, but it's growing on me. I did think that there was too much whipped topping on top of the pie. Maybe 8 oz. in the pie filling, and 4 oz. (half as much) on top would be better. Also, I didn't find the peanut butter flavor very strong, so I'd up the amount of that. But this was indeed pretty easy to make (I've only made a couple of pies of this type.) The miniature peanut butter cups on top were a nice addition, too.

Really good and can be made lower in fat and calories by subbing in lite cream cheese and whipped topping.

Very Simple!!!  My family loves peanut butter so I increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup.  I didn't have peanut butter cups, so I grated a Hershey bar on top of the Cool Whip.  This can be dressed up or down.... Simply delicious!

I listened to some of the other comments and upped the peanut butter to 3/4 cup, I used a chocolate crust, and didn't put the extra whipped topping on top--just pounded some Hershey's chocolate bars in a baggie and sprinkled them on top.    Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving! Even the guy who doesn't like sweets, and the girl who doesn't usually go for peanut butter.  Its not very peanut butter colored, but it definitely tastes amazing!

One of my kids favorite pies.  I add chocolate pudding to the bottom of the pie shell and then put the peanut mixture on top of it.  A favorite of all that have tried it.

This is WONDERFUL! I did make the changes that other reviewers have suggested - make the crust out of nutter butter cookies, increase the amount of PB (I put in around 3/4 cup), and I chopped the entire small bag of Reece's miniatures and placed 1/2 on the crust bottom before adding the filling. My son-in-law LOVES PB cups and he said this was the best pie he has ever eaten.

This was really good. I think it really needed the peanut butter cups as I didn't think it was all that rich.  I crumbled them up all over the top and just let my guests put extra Cool Whip on top if they desired.  Most did not.  Super easy!  Tastes great.

I found this recipe not even a week ago and as of right now I am making my 3rd pie already! My husband has eaten 3/4 of one on his own and now all my family and friends are begging me to make them one. It's so easy and it tastes so wonderful!!! instead of using the peanut butter cups I use peanut butter chips and put them on top! It's so delicious!!!

This is a nice and easy recipe. I made some modifications for a birthday bash. Made a pretzel crust (1 1/4 C crushed pretzels, 1/4 C sugar, 1/2 melted butter - combine all and put into pie pan). Added layer of homemade chocolate sauce (1/2C heavy whipping Cream, 1 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, 3 Tbsp sugar dash of salt, 1/4C bittersweet -60% cacao - choc. chisp, 1 tsp vanilla extract. Bring first 4 items to boil, remove from heat, add choc. chips let sit, return to med. heat for one min. remove from heat, add vanilla). Layer chocolate over crust and put in freezer for 5-10 min. Made homemade whipping cream (2C heavy whipping cream, 1/4 powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract. Whip cream to slightly stiff and add sugar and vanilla, beat till firm peaks). Did 3/4C of creamy peanut butter - made it very peanut buttery - might just do 1/2C next time. Served with remaining chocolate sauce. Huge hit. Might try with marshmallow fluff next time, well see.

This is so easy and so delicious!  I made this for a family gathering and everyone raved about it.  My brother thought he could make a better one so we did a blind taste test.  This recipe won hands down, even my brother thought so!  This is usually the first pie to disappear during a holiday get together.  I followed the recipe exactly, no need to change a thing!

This pie is fantastic!!  My family requests I make it often.  It is soooo easy also.  The only change I made was I put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while preparing the pie and then I chopped them up in a food processor to make crumbs and sprinkled them over the top (I used only 6 for this).  It is a rich dessert but awesome with a glass of milk.

This was a simple but outstanding weeknight dessert pie. I used Dream Whip (the topping you make yourself from a powdered mix) since I did not have frozen topping, and it turned out great. I used slightly less cream cheese (from a block where I had already used a couple tablespoons) and a bit more peanut butter. I did not have any peanut butter cups on hand, so I put a small glaze of bottled chocolate syrup on the crust before adding the filling as well as a decorative pattern on the topping along with some peanuts. 

This is a quick, cheap and outstanding recipe using pantry staples - A+++!

MMM! Really good dessert. I loved the fluffy texture. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Skippy natural peanut butter (has less sugar but doesn't need stirring). I bought the wrong size whipped topping container so I only had enough to mix in with the peanut butter and cream cheese but it was fine. I didn't miss it on top. I think I would either increase the peanut butter or decrease the whipped topping in the mixture because I wanted a stronger peanut butter flavor. Instead of putting the peanut butter cups on top I chopped them up and put them in the bottom of the crust and covered them with the filling. Next time I might mix them in with the filling and sprinkle more on top because they were so good with the cool smooth filling! I also drizzled chocolate syrup over the whole thing when serving. Yum! Really light and fluffy, didn't taste overly sweet or rich like some peanut butter desserts. Probably would be great with a chocolate crust or maybe even chocolate whipped topping instead of regular. Great recipe, easy and fast to prepare. Just be sure to chill overnite!

I made this and my guests and family agreed it there is far too much Cool Whip.  Even my kids complained it was too rich (and that never happens)!  I think it will be better with half the Cool Whip...I will try it again and omit the top layer.

I was a bit late in beginning my preparations for a company meal, and this looked good and easy.  I made it according to the recipe, and it was good, but not wonderful.  We all agreed that we would like more peanut butter flavor, so I made it again and reduced the cream cheese to 4 ounces, and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup.  We loved it!  I also used chunky peanut butter, and we liked that, too.  I also would wait until I served the pie to put the peanut butter cups on top.  I bought the tiny ones already unwrapped, and they looked cute.  They made slicing the pie more of challenge than I wanted, so putting them on right before serving worked best for me.

This pie was just as good as one I get at a local bakery.  It was amazing.  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust and i also put a layer of chocolate pudding on top of the peanut butter layer.  I will be making this again and again!!!

excellent recipe.  I decided to mix all the whipped topping onto it because I didn't feel like doing 2 layers.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was super easy to make and it tasted amazing.  My husband was overjoyed to eat it.  I used mini graham cracker crusts and made individual pies instead of making a huge pie.  I also crushed up Reese's cups on top of the pie for a cute little extra touch.  Definitely using this again!

This was very good.  Smooth, creamy, velvetly rich.  I used a homemade graham cracker crust (trying to save money) and only used one 8 oz. container of whipped topping.  I didn't add the extra whipped topping on top just for personal preference.  I topped each serving with chocolate syrup.  Very good and easy.  I keep mine in the freezer as well because I like the texture better frozen.

1/4 of my cream cheese was missing when I went to make this recipe, but went ahead anyway.  This is probably why mine wasn't too cream cheesey like most reviewers say.  I think this pie tastes like Reese's Pieces!  Next time I will chop the PB cups b/c leaving them whole is too rich.

I didn't think the peanut butter/cream cheese layer was sweet enough.  Still a good dessert, but if I had to make it again, I would add more powdered sugar.

I made this at Christmas, and I think everyone really liked it except me. It wasn't really as firm as I wanted--I think I really needed a freezer pie, rather than a fridge pie. It wasn't un-firm, but it was no firmer than your average cheesecake. 

It did not hold up well to heat (unlike the other three no-bake cheesecakes I made). That's not a fault with the recipe, just a warning for others--it really needs to be kept quite cold.

My hubby is a PB freak! He willneat it on almost anything. I made this and he just loved it! It is a keeper for sure. I did however increase the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and only put about half of the whipping cream on the top. It was a personal taste thing for us. So good!

Did the chocolate crust, doubled the pb, omitted the pb cups. Didn't even do the cool whip topping. Oh. My. GOSH. Super rich though, we got 16 servings.

I made this yesterday for a Sunday night Game of Thrones get-together.  I nearly doubled the peanut butter, I switched the confectioners sugar for fine granulated sugar (what was on-hand) and omitted the peanut butter cup decoration.
The pie was a HUGE hit  :)
Next time I might fold in the whole tub of Cool Whip and have no topping.

I'm eating this right now. I'm in heaven. It's delicious. My first that I've made, so I don't know how it compare to others. The only thing I didn't follow was I crushed up the pb cups, and covered them in powdered sugar (an accident, but I'll go with it) and add half to the filling, and used a shortbread crust since that's what I had. This won't last long around here, and I will be making it again for sure.

Very good, but very sweet also.  I used light cream cheese and FF cool whip and still plenty of flavor.  It stood up nicely, too.

Prefer to mix all of topping into pie, but good either way. Top with crushed peanuts, shaved chocolate or both.

Also works great with Nutella instead of peanut butter.

I love peanut butter pie more than anything and this pie is awesome!

Peanut butter pie recipe. I even made a few modifications to make it lighter...and more peanut buttery!

My modifications:
I used about 1/4 cup extra PB, crushed up the PB cups and used light cream cheese that was whipped and light cool whip.

Wow! You don't get any easier or any better than this!! Like other reviewers I doubled the peanut butter and halved the whipped topping. I didn't have any peanut butter cups, so I just drizzled a little chocolate & caramel syrup over it. The pie was sooo peanut buttery and held together really well. I will be making this a lot!!

Very good pie - every bite of it went tonight at a pie social, where it was up against some yummy pies. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a bit more peanut butter and a few more spoonfuls of the whipped topping to the blended mix. I don't really care for whipped topping by itself, so I just topped the pie with crumbled Reese's peanut butter cups. It was like a peanut butter cheesecake - very rich!

Good recipe.  Very easy to make.  My only suggestion would be to chop the peanut butter cups and sprinkle them over the top.  This way you get Reese's in every bit, instead of in one or two bites per slice.

This is delicious!! I am sugar sensitive, so I substituted Light Cool Whip, Splenda instead of confectioner's sugar. (Just whizzed it in the magic bullet to make it very fine and measured out 1/2 cup.) I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Topped w/ Hershey's Sugar Free chocolate chips. My family ate it up!! They wouldn't have known that it was a healthier version if I hadn't told them. I would make this for a holiday or social gathering.

Fast, easy, and fabulous.  Everyone who tries this recipe says it's to die for.  I drizzle chocolate sauce over the finished product, and use a chocolate cookie crust instead of graham cracker.  Perfect.

I brought this pie to a potluck and there wasn't a crumb left! I did manage to get a piece before it was gone. It's a very rich and decedent dessert.   I added more peanut butter then the recipe called for to enhance the peanut butter flavor. I also put it on a chocolate crumb crust.

This tasted too much like cream cheese. I give a 3 for ease but that's about it.

Great and simple pie! Very very rich. Our family has loved it for years. Just for ease I put the whole tub of cool whip in when mixing instead of spreading some on top. I’ve used a pecan crust, chocolate graham, regular graham, Oreo... they all turn out to be hits. If I make it days ahead and freeze (then just thaw the day you will serve) I add milk to keep it moist. (1/4 cup or so). I always add a splash of vanilla to add depth.

Hi All
If you love peanut butter, chocolate, cheesecake this is a winner! Husband's birthday today made this as his birthday treat. He is diabetic so used Splenda in place of sugar. Dark chocolate chips over whippedu topping. He gave it a 9 of out 10 stars.

I'm not sure there's anything so enjoyable as peanut butter & chocolate--and this recipe honors that. I make with an oreo pie crust and store-bought whipped cream, and it is so incredibly easy for such an awesome payoff.

made this yesterday for my dad's bday & it was great.  Used an chocolate crust and followed the directions except I used about 3/4 cup of peanut butters which I thought was the perfect PB flavor.  I also didn't pay attention and bought a smaller 8oz container of cool whip.  I put almost all of it in the PB mixture and left just a little to smear on top so that way the top would be white.  This worked perfectly.  I'm actually not sure how you would use a large 16oz container because my pie crust was full to the top.  I cut up 4 large reese's and put on top of the cool whip.  The pie was truly amazing.  Will definitely make again!

I get lots of recipe requests for this pie. It's so crazy, easy too. I double the miniature peanut butter cups and add a layer between the pie filling and Cool Whip as well as on top, also drizzle sugar free fudge sauce. I serve this frozen as I prefer the consistency better,

I agree with reviewers who said it needs more peanut butter - I used roughly a cup's worth, and that was just about perfect for us. Since I never have pb cups in the house, I top it with crushed salted peanuts, and a drizzle of hot fudge sauce that comes in a jar. This is a very rich dessert, so a little goes a long way (perfect for a family of six on a budget.) Thanks, Lisa G!

Yummy yummy. If you like peanut butter you will love this pie! Very rich. I chopped up whole Reese's cups and put them on top, since they were cheaper than the  tiny ones.

Delicious!  Added 3/4 cup of peanut butter and 8 oz container to pie.  Garnished with chocolate/caramel sauce, dallop of cool whip and crushed peanut butter cups.
Update: 6/30/18- made pie again this time added about 2 cups of peanut butter, 12 0z of cool whip, and 1 & 1/2 blocks of cream cheese.   Placed in chocolate pie crust, topped with cool whip and placed in fridge to cool for at least 6-7 hours before our party this evening.

Update 7/5/18- delicious.  Next time add more recent cream cheese (2 blocks). Will make 2 pies

This is surprisingly light and really smooth.  I decided to add all of the whipped cream in at once, not creating a separate layer.  I also added just a bit more peanut butter.  Yum!

We loved this!  I think next time that I'll make adjustments to lower the fat and calories by switching out low fat whipped topping and reduced fat cream cheese.

Followed other reviews and increased peanut butter to 3/4 cup, used a 12 oz. container frozen whipped topping divided, chopped peanut butter cups and sprinkled on top.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat graham cracker crust, and light whipped topping.  Every little bit helps, right?  Sooooo good!

We made this for my daughters 13th birthday, and it was perfect!  We used a regular pie crust and poured herseys syrup on the bottom, before putting the peanut butter filling in, we also made our own whipped cream.

this was a big hit with my whole family. really easy and really good. I didn't change anything and I left the crumbled peanut butter cups on the side and let everyone put what they wanted on it. The peanut butter cups really make a differance on the sweetness. So I am glad I let my family choose.

Over all this is pretty good i agree that there maybe a little to much whip cream on top also when i first made it i had a slice after about 8 hrs and the cream cheese(i used store brand that could be why) was a little over powering then i had a second piece the next day and it tasted much better. I will make this again and be sure to let it set in refrigerator over night before serving. thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was awesome! I did the "light" version to make myself feel better about snarfing it up (let's face it, it's no healthier). But it was great! I did a nice little drizzle on the top with Caramel and Chocolate and it looked as good as it tasted. Thank you for adding this!

I've been meaning to make a peanut butter pie for just about forever and finally made this one tonight...it was very good!!! I used a chocolate crust, added a bit more peanut butter and did not use the additional cool whip for the top...will definitely make this again :)

Well yes, this is quite yummy!  I added a layer of chocolate pudding to the bottom of the crust, but it doesn't really need it.  It is rich, but I found it perfect.  I chopped up the candy for the top and that worked nicely.  An easy pie that will impress guests!

I thought it was very good. I used 2 cans of off cool whip instead of 1 tub. I think it had too much of a peanut butter taste because of this. I will make it again and use the tub cool whip instead.

First dessert I've ever made, very very easy to do. I added some chocolate syrup on it just for looks, but overall it was great. Only real flaw is you have to see it in the fridge for at least 2 hours and cant eat it yet, haha.

This peanut butter pie is awesome.  It's rich and has a strong peanut butter flavor.  I make it for church dinners and family get-togethers.  Everyone loves it and it is so easy to make.  I top mine with a little chocolate sauce.

I'm in love!! So easy, and incredibly yummy & peanut-buttery. Perfect! I made this in a 9 x 9 Tupperware square & just made my own graham cracker crust, so it wasn't in the pie shape, but one you'd cut in squares. My mom was putting it together & accidentally put some peanut butter cups on top of the peanut butter mixture before we had the top whipped cream layer done, and that was actually kind of nice - the chunks of cups within it were a tasty surprise. Huge hit!

Delicious! We don't have pre-made crusts or frozen whipped topping where I live, so I made my own crust with 200 g Oreo cookies and 100 g melted butter, and whipped topping from 3 dl cream and 3 tbsp powdered sugar (I only used 1/3 of it in the filling, and the remaining 2/3 on the top).

I was worried the tartness of the cream cheese would be weird with the peanut butter, but it only gave it a smooth and silky texture. A really quick an easy dessert with a mild peanut flavor. Will most definitely make again!

I added a dark chocolate layer at the bottom of the pie before putting the filling in and bumped the peanut butter up to 3/4 cup. It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving, bringing it back for Christmas! Super easy and delicious

Was easy and good. But I feel like it needed more chocolate.  I would make again but I would look ar other suggestions of others adding chocolate pudding layer or chocolate fudge on bottom of crust. (As the first layer) )

Brought this to Thanksgiving and my whole family devoured it and raved about it! The only change I made was added 3/4 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2, and a little extra sugar to compliment the extra peanut butter. A+!

I made a nutter butter cookie crust and topped the pie with dark chocolate sauce as well as the ground up Reese’s. Absolutely delicious, about the best peanut butter pie ever.

This was SO easy and yummy!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I think the next time I'll cut back on the powdered sugar.  It was a little sweet for me, but that's just me.

I loved this pie! Easy to make. Followed directions as written. I may cut back on the 8oz of cool whip used in the receipt and increase the peanut butter by 1/4 cup.

I used a regular pie crust (pastry) instead of graham cracker.
I also used a heaping tbsp. of peanut butter extra and will probably add a 1/4 cup extra next time. Followed recipe to the tee and it came out excellent. Only used 1 Reese's pb cup in middle and 8 around the pie to give on per 8 serving.
I also used light cool whip and neufchatel cream cheese..you would never know the difference.

I used 6 oz of cream cheese, 1/3 cup of powdered sugar, 3/4 cups of PB, and 4 oz of whipped cream topping in the mix. The original recipe was too dairy tasting for me, and I prefer a bit more of the PB texture and flavor! Dessert recipes usually tend to be a bit sweet for me so 1/3 c sugar was perfect.

I used cool whip instead of whipping cream, and I omitted the cool whip on top. I drizzled chocolate syrup on top and added chopped up Reeses. It was an absolute hit!

Great recipe!! You can even make this sugar free and diabetic friendly by substituting a sugar free crust (I make mine with sugar free sandwich cookies), Splenda/stevia for the powered sugar, sugar free cool whip and natural peanut butter.  My family request this every year (even those that are not eating sugarless love it)!!!

Based on other reviews, we used 3/4 cup of peanut butter. This gave the filling a great peanut flavor. I chopped 6 miniature Reese's peanut butter cops and placed them onto the chocolate pie crust. Next we added the filling & topped it with 6 more chopped peanut butter cups. I forgot the extra whipped topping for the top of the pie. It doesn't actually need the extra topping. This is so good that the hubby told me it was all he could do to not bury his face in the pie tin! Thanks for the great recipe!

I added a bit more PB - in place of peanut butter miniature cups, I encircled the pie rim with mini-pie sliced from the peanut butter cups - it was cute. I topped the cool whip topping with drizzled warmed peanut butter fudge topping
Gave a modern look and was yummy!

Loved it.  As others said it is a little rip h on cream cheese.  I'll reduce that about 2/3 of a brick of cream cheese next time. Another idea would be to add more of the whipped topping to the mix instead of so much on top.  I, as many other reviewers said, used an Oreo cookie crust.  Drizzling ice cream topping (hot fudge or caramel) when serving is also great.

I made this pie just the way the recipe said to make it. I thought it came out well. My husband loved it as well. This pie tastes much better than the frozen peanut butter pie from the grocery store. I would rather make this myself. I am going to pass the recipe along to a few friends and family members!

A go-to recipe.  I tend to use a chocolate crust and a thin layer of chocolate pudding underneath the peanut butter layer.  I skip the whipped topping that is used as garnish... it's not necessary

This is the best peanut butter pie ever!  I accidentally blended all of the whipped topping into the pie instead of saving some for the top.  The consistency was even creamier than the original recipe.  So now I always make it like that.  It's a family favorite and I can make it ahead of time and freeze it, so it's my favorite, too.

Peanut butter perfection. We usually double the recipe to make a fuller pie.

This was an incredible dessert. It's very rich but that only makes the goodness last longer as you only need a small piece to enjoy it. I used a pre-made shortbread crust because that's what I had on hand. So good! I will absolutely be making this again. 
What I love most about this recipe is that it only takes minutes to make...but it does have to chill before eating, and that's ok.

I would have given it 5 stars but I was helping my grandson make it for his mother's birthday and I just skimmed the recipe. So instead of folding part of the cool whip in the peanut butter mixture we put the whole carton of Cool whip in.  Even though it was a mistake it still tasted wonderful.  So I will have to try it the right way next time and it will get t 5 stars

Oh so delicious!  I used a pre-made Oreo pie crust and drizzled Hershey's chocolate syrup on the crust before adding pie and again over whipped topping. I will definitely be making this easy pie again and again!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I actually licked the spoon like a child the filling was so good!  The only changes I made were to follow other reviews and put a layer of chocolate fudge on the bottom, freeze 10 mins, and the filling, freeze 30 min, then a layer of chocolate fudge on top instead of the whip topping.  I did use the whip topping to make a design on the outer edges.  Everyone loved this.  I can't wait to make it again!  I just froze the whole pie until it was time to leave and by the time dinner was done, the pie was thawed enough to eat.

Very easy to make. I love peanut butter so much I added 3/4 cups. Though it still wasn't as powerful as I'd hoped for.
Maybe less cream cheese?
I expected to love it but, it was just ok.
 Still have half a pie left.

This pie was so easy and delicious!  I used an Oreo crust, and drizzled the top of the pie with chocolate, rather than garnish it with peanut butter cups.  My family loved it!  Thank you!

I have tried several peanut butter pies on here and this, by far, has been my favorite.  I also like that this recipe makes just one pie at a time.

Made it exactly as called for, but used a 12 oz. tub of whipped cream which was plenty. Tasting the batter, I'd add a splash of vanilla flavoring. And I found tiny bit-sized Reeses Cups which I'm sure the kids will love. Next time, I'll get more creative, but for half an hour prep, this was a no-brainer and a crowd pleaser.

Loved it, but also added more Peanut Butter.  Tip to those, like me, who don’t care for the sour flavor of cream cheese, use Mascarpone instead!

Made crust with butter and gluten free  double chocolate cookies crushed. Also from other suggestions, used hot fudge sauce over crust. Finished peanut butter jar...maybe 3/4 cup. Only  mixed in  4 oz cool whip in pie and used 4 oz spread on top.  Had left over chocolate sauce,  so dripped that all over the  top of cool whip along with grated chocolate bar sprinkled on top. Double foiled and froze.  Will thaw 20 minutes before serving tomorrow. Can't wait to serve  to company so I can try it. Looks delicious!

Love this easy recipe.  We live in hot & humid florida.  I made this for my boyfriend's birthday which is in August.  The only slight change I made was adding about a third of a tsp. of vanilla to my preference. Otherwise this is awesomely easy  recipe. Everyone thought it was store bought!

Made this for our family dinner once and it was a huge hit! very easy to make and it say to make it the night before or refrigerate it 2 hours before but I didn't put mine in the fridge that long and it worked fine. Over all very few ingredients (most you probably already have at home) and easy to make in just a short amour of time. A+

I made this for dessert when old friends dropped by, and they love peanut butter, so I thought this would be a shoe -in.  Not nearly enough peanut butter at all, and I added more; and maybe because I used homemade whipped cream it didn't hold it's shape, golly, it was a mess! The only good part were the chopped choc. peanut butter cups!!

Made for daughter that loves and craves peanut butter. She loved it. Used 3 small pkgs of grandma's  peanut butter cookies . Crushed them and added a small amt of butter. Tasty but not a good crust,stuck more in pan than on pie. I cut up some small  Reese cups and put over crust than did the rest as written. Very easy.

Loved it. I took suggestions and added 1 cup of PB. Made crust out of Nutterbutter cookies. Made it in a springform pan and froze it. Easy and delicious.  Not too rich. I did not use the PB cups but I grated a bit of dark chocolate on top.

I made just the peanut butter filling for this pie and piped it into small chocolate cups & drizzled with chocolate. The filling was amazing. This is a really good recipe whether you use it for pie or any other peanut butter dessert.

I will start by saying I don't normally leave reviews, but this is one of my favorite recipes! I add an extra helping of crunchy peanut butter and use a chocolate cookie crust, but this recipe really is a must try! Thank you for sharing.

We enjoyed this pie. I made a few alterations. My son is allergic to peanut products so I substituted sunflower seed butter and used chopped dark chocolate peanut cups only upon serving to those who are not allergic. I used 3/4 of a cup instead of 1/2 cup of the seed butter. I added a layer of dark chocolate pudding on top of a prepared Oreo cookie crust. I made it the night before I wanted to serve it and it set up beautifully. Would do it again.

The filing tasted too much like cream cheese.  I kept adding peanut butter and powdered sugar.  I also used an Oreo crust.

Fabulous! I only used an 8 oz container of the whipped topping, using about 2/3 of it in the pie and the remainder for the top. That worked perfectly! I drizzled the bottom and sides of the graham shell with a couple of tblsps of chocolate syrup. Loved the results! I put the pie into the freezer, and after 5 hours, it was perfect! Great texture and not hard as a rock like ice cream. I'm planning to just store it in the freezer.  I would even add a little more peanut butter the next time I make this, and there will be a next time! I didn't do this, but you could use fat-free ingredients to make it a little more 'healthy'. Delicious, very rich-tasting for so little effort! Great recipe! UPDATE the next day: Not surprising this was hard as a rock 24 hrs later. I will now place in refrig and only use freezer for the first 5-6 hrs after made.

To make it more like Marie Calendar's, use an Oreo crust. Either way though, this is delicious!

This was really easy to make.  I usually go exactly by the recipe the first time I try it, but after reading the reviews, I used a chocolate pie crust and used 3/4 cups of peanut butter.   My son-n-law said it was good but rich.  My daughter-n-law stated that it needed more peanut butter.  My daughter said it was good but she could taste the cream cheese.  This is definitely a keeper, but the next one I make will be with less of the cream cheese and hope it sets up.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.  I will definitely make again.

The family loved it after our Thanksgiving feast. They thought it was full of flavor, but lighter than many other pies, making it a perfect ending to a huge mean.  I'll be making it again for Christmas.  My only change was to use a chocolate cookie crust.

Great recipe that is easy to make. I did mine by hand instead of using a mixer and I have a broken wrist. IT IS THAT SIMPLE!!! Yummy pie even without the peanut butter cup garnish.

I really like this recipe for the peanut butter filling part, I made it with a premade chocolate Oreo crust, and then made homemade ganache for the topping and piped fresh whipped cream on the outside and sprinkled mini chocolate chips. Definitely one of my favorite desserts!

When I made this, it tasted like there was too much cream cheese and it over powered the peanut taste. I personally, the next time try it this recipe, would experiment with different amounts of peanut butter to try and fix it.

I have made this exact pie many times.  It is super easy! I now get it requested from my 2 kids and husband for each of their birthdays as their special dessert! They are the only ones that are allowed to eat it. :-)  I usually add another few heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter and lots of Reese's cups on top. It turns out great every single time! I always use an Oreo premade crust.

This recipe is great! I made it for my dad on Father's Day, and I made several changes based on his preferences. 
1. I didn't mix the PB/cream cheese/powdered sugar mixture with an electric mixer. I didn't realize it was supposed to be kind of whipped, so I mashed it all together with a spatula. Lol!
2. I used more than 1/2 C. of PB. Dad loves it so I wanted to make sure there was enough PB in the pie. 
3. After I put the PB mixture in the pie crust, it wasn't very full. My fam isn't a huge fan of cool whip on top of stuff, so I just made another batch of the PB mixture (again, mashing with a spatula and using more PB). Before I spread it on top, though, I chopped up some Reese's peanut butter cups and sprinkled them ontop of the first layer, and then spread the second layer on top. 
4. The double-batch of PB mixture was perfect! It fit in the crust wonderfully. Then I chopped up some more Reese's and put them on top. I refrigerated overnight and served the next afternoon. It was delicious! The pie was very rich, so small pieces were preferred, but it as fantastic!! Definitely will make again. ?? The only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is bc I'm not a huge fan of so much cool whip on top and it could use a little more PB. Otherwise, great, easy, delicious recipe!

This was delicious! I think it a great base recipe that you can adjust. I used a chocolate cookie crust, fat free cool whip, reduced fat pb, and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Makes me feel a little better about how much I'm going to eat of it. I also only used an 8 oz  tub of cool whip. I mixed a little more than half in the pb mixture and spread the remainder on top and that was perfect m. I also used about 3/4 cup pb based on other reviews. I got a little nervous it would be overpowering since I was using much less cool whip but it was perfect. I crushed the pb cups on top. I also froze it for 2 days prior to eating then let it sit at room tempature for about 3 hours before cutting and the consistency was perfect. I'll make this again!

I followed Ottercoon's suggestion of putting a layer of chocolate pudding in there. 

I made it for our Super Bowl party (dumb Panthers) and everyone loved it .  So super easy to assemble even a caveman could make it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used a chocolate cookie crust and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup. We added into the filling chopped Reese's cup chunks and chopped Keebler dark chocolate cookies. We didn't have more than 8 oz of Cool Whip, so put real whipped cream on top. We topped it with the chopped Reese's cups and dark chocolate cookies. Very good, light and fluffy!

I made this for the first time and it's AMAZING! I altered the recipe slightly by adding hot fudge right out of the jar, directly onto the crust. Then added the filling and topped it with the crushed up Reese's. I went a little heavy on the peanut butter because I love the stuff. Great recipe

Perfect - except I added all of whip topping in at once and mixed.  Sprinkle chocolate chips, sparingly, on top.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and I made my own graham cracker crust. I garnished it with Miniature recees cups. People at the potluck I brought it to told me it was amazing and there was none left at the end of the night.

Very easy and rich tasting, while still light. Peanut butter taste was a little too light.  I added a sprinkling of chopped salted peanuts on top. Chill overnight for best results.

This pie is delicious. In fact my husband, who is one of those people who tastes things more intensely than the average person, actually can't eat more than a bite or two because it's so powerfully flavorful.

This pie is truly AMAZING! I decided to make this for a group at a BBQ. Because of the creaminess of the peanut butter filling, we opted to have the whipped topping as an option (along with the chocolate sauce, Reese's, and peanuts) instead of as an established pie topping. The guys at the BBQ ate it all up in a couple of minutes and really liked having the options! Thank you for this recipe!

This is a super quick and easy desert to make! The second time I made it, I added a little more peanut butter and added chopped Reese's peanut butter cups to the filling and it was even more delicious! Definitely a recipe to keep.

Try melting peanut butter chips and add that over the crust .It will give that extra flavor some other reviewers were looking for.

Fantastic recipe! It's also easy to adjust to personal preference or just to try something new. I'm making this for the fourth time and after the first time as-is, I wanted less of a peanut butter cheesecake taste.  My personal favorite ratio is 8 oz pb, 8oz cream cheese, 8 oz cool whip. I save just a bit of the cool whip to spread a thin layer on top of the filing.   After that, tons of options.  This will be my first time with a chocolate cookie crust instead of a graham cracker crust.

I would recommend using mini Reese's and making a layer at the bottom of the pie then out the mix. Also if you really like peanut butter add more of that. For presentation I sprinkled a small amount of Hersey powder. Delicious

I added 3/4 cup of Reeses peanut butter chips and swapped out real whipped cream for whipped topping, 'cause I just can't eat fake food.  After the pie was assembled, I sprinkled 1/2 cup of crushed peanuts over the top and melted 1/2 cup of chocolate morsels and drizzled that over the top.  When the chocolate hardens, It adds a great texture.  OMG - 'Nuff said.

this is great -I did some changes- we doubled the peanut butter and reduced the sugar a bit - omitted the whip cream and pb cups but did drizzle with chocolate, it was sweet enough- went with a honey graham cracker crust and it was superb!

This. Is. THE. BOMB.  Wow, this is really delicious....very rich, but delicious.  The only substitution I made was I used the package of really tiny peanut butter cups...they come unwrapped.  Loved the graham cracker crust, the peanut butter/cream cheese layer...the whole thing.  The only change I will make next time is to drizzle a layer of chocolate syrup over the top.  5+ stars for sure!

Very light and tasty! I made it exactly like the recipe, with one exception...I spread Nutella in the bottom of the graham crust. It was delicious.

Tasted excellent. Topping ended up very soupy though. If I make again, I'll stick it in the freezer for a bit. The fridge overnight just didn't cut it.

So I pretty much followed the above Recipe, just uesd the following: Smuckers 100% natural peanut butter, whipped cream cheese and extra creamy cool whip. This turned out great. Very solid. I didn't mix it with the blender, used a large spoon. But next time I may use the blender to get some air into it. Very good. Followed the directions other than those changes.

This pie is amazing! I used 3/4 cup pb and an oreo crust. At the bottom of the crust I put pb cups chopped up fine. Then after the whipped cream topping I sprinkle on more finely chopped pb cups and drizzled the Magic Shell Chocolate Fudge that hardens in a lattice pattern. I like to serve this frozen or nearly frozen. Devine!

Great!
Tips -
Take an extra 1/4 cup of pb heated for 45 seconds in microwave and drizzle on top 
I used only half of the sugar it called for 
I also made a brownie crust by baking a brownie in the pie shell and hallowing out the centre

I used a chocolate cookie crust, piped the top layer of coolwhip on it (to make it pretty)and put coarsely chopped white and milk chocolate reese's peanutbutter cups on it. Everyone raved about it. Thanks for the recipe! Almost forgot,  I also heated up a little chocolate fudge sauce and drizzled it on each piece as I served it.

Love this. I made it with Wowbutter (a peanut butter substitute since I'm allergic to peanuts), fat free cream cheese, and fat free whipped topping.  I used a oreo crust and added about a half a teaspoon of vanilla.  and of course I left off the candies.... Yummy!

I made a homemade graham cracker crust that I found on this site (so easy to make and a hundred times better than store bought!) with chocolate graham crackers and the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. It came out pretty good but not enough peanut butter taste for me. It tasted like a peanut butter cheesecake, which is NOT a bad thing but, not exactly what I wanted. Next time I'll use this recipe as more of a guideline and the only change I'll make is to use less cream cheese and/or more peanut butter. Other than being to cheesecake-like for me, it came out perfect! The texture was great and it set up wonderful in the refrigerator after only 3 hours (we couldn't wait any longer to eat it lol). When I feel like having cheesecake I'll definitely make this because it was so good!

My husband loves Reese's Peanut Butter cups. So when he took his first bite of this pie and said it tasted like one I was pretty impressed. I took advice of other reviewers and made my own chocolate crust and added a thin layer of schmuckers chocolate fudge.

I tried this and loved it. I did a variation by first layering chocolate pudding and then the peanut butter pie mixture. I used graham cracker and dark chocolate to decorate the top and placed it in the freezer! The family loves it! So easy!

Wow, wow, wow, WOW!!!!!!  I made it exactly as directed by the recipe and it was AMAZING!!!!!!! I did find it easier to mix the peanut butter, cream cheese and sugar by hand. Even though it was a little messy it made it really smooth. We will make this again many times and I would recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!

My family loves this.  It is simple, I told my husband he could even do it.  He loved it so much I made 2 of them back to back, because when he the last piece was gone, he was whining that there wasn't anymore.  I melted peanut butter and drizzled it on the top with chocolate syrup.

Very good!  I substituted light cream cheese and only used one 10 oz, container of whipped topping, which was plenty for both the filling and topping.  I let the pie set for over 24 hours and it was soft, but still held together.  The filling is mousse-like, so it was light and not cloyingly sweet.  Small slices go a long way and is plenty.

Great peanut butter taste, but quite sweet so be warned if you don't like rich, sweet desserts. Really only needed 8 oz of whipped topping - about 5 in the pie mix and 3 on top was more than enough. My 14-yr old son made it with very little help from Mom so you know it's easy!

I just made this recipe and haven't tried it yet. It is in the freezer right now. I added some crunched up peanuts into it and chocolate on the top. It looks pretty. Just waiting for it to get ready to eat. We cleaned the bowl out before we washed it and it sure tasted good.

This was sooooo yummy! I used a chocolate cookie crust and topped the pie with a drizzle of chocolate ganache and some salty peanuts. I made this for my mom's birthday and everbody loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loves this recipe. It has become my "must bring" dessert for holidays and special occasions. This year I tweaked it and cut about 1/4 of the cream cheese out and added that much more peanut butter, just to make it a little more "nutty" and it was preferred by many.

Someone made this for me the other day, but mixed the cream layer into the mix rather than on the top.  It was delicious, but I could defiantly only eat one slice!  The only other improvement that she made was using a base made of crushed oreos, bound with egg and then baked for 5 minutes.  Yum!

I followed theis reipe with only a few minor changes: I used a nutter butter crust recipe from a reviewer in the recipe No Bake Peanut Butter Pie, I didn't put candy on top of the pie (it would've been too much, it's already rich enough), and I used dark chocolate syrup in between the peanut butter filling and the whipped cream. The pie was very rich, creamy, and delicious. My family loved it and I will make it again =)

Yum! This was so good. I made it for my fiance and his grandmother and it was gone by the end of the night.  I did change a few things however.  I misread the recipe and got a smaller sized cool-whip so I omitted the topping of cool-whip and it was still great, I also didn't put the peanut butter cups on top.  All in all very good.
