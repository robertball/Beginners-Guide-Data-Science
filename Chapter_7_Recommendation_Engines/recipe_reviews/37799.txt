4/25/06---I have been eating this for lunch a couple of times a week all my life! I use egg noodles, fresh parmesan, garlic, ground black pepper, butter, crushed red pepper flakes, parsley flakes  & a bit of seasoning salt. Sometimes I throw in some bacon bits. I could literally live off of this stuff. Next time I will take Taylor's suggestion & use the enhanced pasta recipe to cook my egg noodles. UPDATE--5/30/06 I was feeling adventurous today & tried the enhanced pasta recipe using chicken cubes instead of beef, & using spaghetti instead of my usual egg noodles. Then I topped it w/ some browned butter, fresh chopped basil, fresh parmesan cheese (I also tried some w/ feta but my heart will always belong to parmesan LOL) & then I it hit w/ a couple of sprinklings of a quality balsamic vinegar...DELISH!

This was outstanding. I used half parmesan cheese and half asiago and tossed in chopped tomatoes and fresh basil. It was delicious. My husband and I ate every bite of it and I NEVER have seconds. Very easy and yummy.

I make this for my son (who WAS the pickiest 4 year old..but he's getting better) and he thought it was just OK.  I usually use egg noodles because they are relatively healthier, but it doesn't help the taste.  He's working his way up to spaghetti and he just graduated from this dish.

I am VERY proud of my boyfriend!! Not wanting to spend any time in the kitchen during lunch (just too darn nice outside) I printed off this recipe and instructed my roommate and boyfriend to take care of lunch while I took my daughter on a walk. However, I left tips for them, including to grill a couple chix breasts and steam some broccoli and carrots. I'm not sure if they added anything else but the result was pretty good...esspecially since my boyfriend is cooking inept! Granted, I have been making this recipe since grade school but I was proud of my boys! The grilled chicken, broccoli and carrots made this better and with a side of ham sandwiches and lemonade, we enjoyed eating this lunch outside on our patio! This recipe proves that men can master the basics!! Thanks Kraft!

For using just a couple very basic ingredients, this was SUCH a good side dish! I'm sure it would go with just about everything too. I used rigatoni, cuz it's all I had, and it worked just fine. I will deffinetly be making this one again and again! My boyfriend LOVED it.

This is an easy recipe that anyone  can do.  I also prefer the egg noodles and sometimes use butter instead of olive oil.  Turns out delicious every time...you can't go wrong.  Thanks Kraft.

First, I gotta tell ya that my 12 year old daughter eats this EVERY day after school, not only with spaghetti noodles, but any that are on hand.  Most of the time she subs olive oil for the butter as well.  It's a no brainer.  Anyway, I made this tonight (with the hopes of having a nice sauce to go with it, but when that fell through, there was the ol' stand by).  I used rotini, added steamed broccoli & julienned carrots and subbed olive oil for the butter.  It worked great with chicken.  Thanks K-R-A-F-T

This has always been my favorite way to eat spaghetti.  I feed it to my daughter now when I don't feel like or have time to make a red sauce.  It is my we are running late, I forgot to take meat out of the freezer, I don't feel like cooking, and it is already 6 o'clock meal.  Add some veggies, fruit, and bread and I have a complete meal.  I prefer it with fresh grated parmesan, but the stuff out of the can will work too if in a pinch.  I know it probably shouldn't qualify as a meal by itself, but I am a firm believe my daughter won't suffer any great losses from eating one incomplete meal.  It serves its purpose.

This was a very simple and quick recipe. There was a bit too much butter and parmesan for my taste. It would definitely be better with a little more added to it (meat, veggies, etc.).

Very tasty! To make this more filling, I added grilled chicken strips to the garlic and while cooking the pasta, I added some frozen broccoli to the water during the last five minutes of it cooking. I tossed the drained pasta/broccoli with the garlic/chicken before tossing with parmesan. Excellent.

This was pretty good, I made it with tomatoe, fresh basil, brocolli and chicken so that it was a complete meal. I will add a little more spice and salt next time.

I've been making this for year and it's one of my favorite pasta dishes!  It's so simple and delicious!  You can substitute spagetti squash for pasta noodles and it's still delicious!  I use fresh Parmesan usually and you can add some basil and oregano.

Sorry, we found this a little plain even with the reviews for the enhanced pasta.  Flavors didn't do it for us. Guess we like more of a flair of Italian flavors or Irish.

I personally thought the recipe called for too much parmesan cheese, which dried out the noodles quite a bit. The flavor was great though. Next time I will cut back on the parmesan and I'm sure it will be a winner.

This recipe is fast! I used olive oil, onion, and brocolli.  If I would have had any meat, chicken or shrimp would be good in this recipe also I think. I'm sattisfied.

This is very quick and easy to prepare and the whole family loved it.  The only thing I did different was to add more garlic (3 cloves) and more Parmesan cheese. I will add this to my permanent recipe collection.
