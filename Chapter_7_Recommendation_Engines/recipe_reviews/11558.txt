These are terrific cookies, they disappeared in a flash at my house.
The only difficulty I ran in to was keeping my kid out of the cherry
chips!  I also think these would make good Christmas cookies,
they look very festive with the cherry chips in them.  I know
I will be making these many more times in the future.

I used 1c cherry chips and 1c milk chocolate chips and after the first couple of batches, I baked them for about 13 minutes rather than 10 (we like our cookies a bit more golden & slightly crispy).  A very nice cookie.  Thanks for the recipe, Lisa!

These are a perfect cookie!!! I didn't have shortening so I used lard in place of. You really need to measure the butter with a measuring cup and I think its why some people have been having trouble with this recipe. The first time I have used cherry chips and we adored the cookies. They are like a sugar cookie with a cherry flavor.

This recipe was a horrible disaster. I followed the directions exactly to the T yet the cookies came out soggy in the center and crispy on the edge. It looks like there was too much fat in the mix or maybe the cookies should be baked at 350 for a longer cooking time, I really don't know. What I do know is that I make cookies on a regular basis, I know my oven, and I have never had any cookie come out this terrible..EVER.

good to mix things up a bit and not always do the same old choc chip or sugar cookies.  we made ours into a valentine's day giant cookie cake and frosted with chocolate.

I used a bit less shortening and peppermint extract instead of vanilla extract. Make sure all the butter and shortening is room temperature

So easy to make. Followed recipe to a “T” and the cookies came out great. Delicious! Had a yield of 11 dozen. Chips were expensive but the taste of these cookies were worth it! Thanks, Lisa. Will definitely make these again.

This recipe is wonderful. It is a big "hit" with the whole family. I didn't have shortening, so I used all margarine and they were still wonderful.
