I tried this recipe with chicken wingettes and absolutely loved them! The perfect wings to satisfy those that like dry wings and those that like wet wings. I will definitely be making these again, YUM!!!

This is tasty but very strong. I liked the old bay on the chicken but the sauce was a little intense for me. next time I think I'll use it on the side to dip into rather than coat the whole chicken

I liked this dish, it really picked up the Old Bay seasoning. I did add about half of the hot sauce called for.

Yum. I double the amount of Old Bay but that's because I love Old Bay.

This was a good recipe, my family liked it but also found the sauce a little too intense. If you don't like spicy you will find it has a kick. Definitely a good 4 star recipe and I will make again. I could see this as a good wing recipe as well

I was introduced to this at a restaurant in florida. Had to find a recipe to add to my repertoire. Turned out delicious.

This was easy and delicious. I used thin sliced chicken cutlets and saut√©ed them instead of baking. My family loved the Old Bay seasoning and for the sauce I used only half the Tabasco for just the right amount of heat. This recipe is a weeknight winner!

I used chicken with the bone and Cajun seasoning and a old bay because I didnt have enough Old Bay. It was a delicious dish I made mashed potatoes and green beans marinated in butter and salt and old bay. Yummy!!

I made the wings and they came out awesome. Followed the recipe exactly and cooked them at 400 for an hour flipping them halfway. Seriously the crispiest wings in the oven I've ever had.

This is soo easy and delicious! My kids hate spicy so I dip their pieces first then add the hot sauce for the adults. It has become one of our favorites.

Loved the sauce for dipping. (since most of the family doesn't like spicy)  The chicken seemed pretty flat by itself but with the sauce, the chicken coating really didn't matter much.  I'll probably use the sauce again.  This was worth trying, but there is no WOW factor.  Those who ate just the chicken liked it though so 4 stars seems fair.
