I love Win Schulers Bar Cheese as I was growing up in Southeastern Michigan.  Gordon Food Service used to have their version called 'Tavern Cheese Spread' in their retail stores here in Florida.  I'd buy it a case at a time but when I went back to resupply, they discontinued it..

OH NOOOOO!!! I gotta have my fix, especially with upcoming football parties.

Now that I've found the recipe, I'll just make my own!!

Tasty cheese spread I made with a block of Kraft extra sharp cheddar cheese. I melted the cheese on the stove and added a splash of milk. Since the cheese block was 8 ounces, I made half the recipe, so I estimated the garlic powder. It's a good imitation of Win Schuler cheese.
