This is a must-have at the holidays for my family.  My mother always made it - so it's a tradition.  I would suggest raising the temp to 350 for 45 min., so you can cook it along with other dishes.  I would definitely recommend lightly sprinkling some 'Accent' on each layer of oysters (it especially brings out the flavor of oysters).  I've always made it with milk, and be sure to let it set for an hour to absorb the liquid.  It doesn't fluff up during baking if you skip this step.

Even though I had some doubts about this recipe I finally decided to make it for a prime rib dinner I was making. What a nice surprise, this dish is fabulous. Now I make it any time I get the chance. Thanks so much for sharing Audrey!

This recipe did not work out at all!  I used two 8 oz containers of oysters, 35 crackers & 2 cups half & half.  I let it sit for an hour b4 baking it but it was really runny.  After baking it was just slop!  Doesn't souffle need eggs & egg whites to help it set up? I would guess about 3 eggs seperated & beaten.  Maybe I should have used just one cup of H&H? Maybe add a pinch of nutmeg for subtle flavor, too.  OK- revision to previous tirade - After this souffle sat for about half an hour to 45 minutes it did set up into a souffle like consistency, but it was cold.  I still think it was bland & tasted more like crackers than oysters.

We have done this on Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. However, we do it a little different first off, we call it Oyster Casserole. We use a jar of fresh oysters (instead of canned), which I cut  up, if the oysters are big, to make them cover more area of the crackers, reserve half of the oyster liquid (so then cut down the 1/2 and 1/2) and mix it with about a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup diced celery and salt and pepper. We also use saltines instead of Ritz type crackers. It is FABULOUS if you are an oyster lover like we are!
