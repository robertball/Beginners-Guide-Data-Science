I can't believe the person before me said this was just so-so!  This was MARVELOUS!  Perhaps better suited for the more sophisticated palate.  So rich and flavorful!  I used boneless skinless thighs and it was heavenly.  I served it with mashed redskin garlic potatoes and grilled aspargus.  My guests thought I was possessed by Martha Stewart, they were so impressed!  Thank you Tiff for this wonderful recipe!

You've done a great job on this recipe.  I was looking for a tasty dish to try for my first attempt with prosciutto and it was superb.  The only thing I changed was the same as the advise from many others, mushrooms on the bottom of the dish along with an onion.  I went a bit lighter on the garlic but that is a personal choice.  I left the lid on the casserole dish and cooked it for 1.5 hours then, reduced the resultant liquid by half before adding the cream.  Beautiful and thanks.

Had Christmas at my house for the first time and wanted something to wow the inlaws and my husbands family...this was it.  This turned out great.  I made this the night before and put it into the oven for about 1 hour and 10 minutes and it turned out delicious.  It was moist and everyone raved...thanks for making my Christmas dinner easy.

What a simple and delicious way to prepare chicken!  I used boneless chicken breasts that I pounded down to 1/2 inch thick.  I also put the mushrooms on the bottom of the baking dish as others had suggested. The sauce was perfect.  I used light sour cream and to thicken it, I used a little cornstarch and I had some Asiago cheese on hand so I grated a little of that into the sauce.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and it was a hit.

This was o.k. I used chicken breast tenders and added artichokes.  Half way through the cooking I had a lot of liquid and the mushrooms and prosciutto were not browning. I suggest putting the mushrooms on the bottom of the chicken (or saute them separately if you like 'em brown) or you'll be wasting $6.00 worth of prosciutto. Flavor was good though and the sauce was delicious. I reduced drippings & 3/4 cup white wine by half before adding sour cream. Great over angel hair pasta with some fresh lemon juice on top.

Very delicious. I used chicken cutlets, sliced very thin and I lightly browned them in butter before assembling everything because they didnt have the skin like the thighs would have. Because I made this for 16 people I used virginia ham instead of prosciutto, just to save on the cost and I didnt want to use bacon because it sounded too rich that way. Everyone loved it, I should have made much more it went so fast. I served this with a mushroom and artichoke risotto. Very delicious, easy to prepare and tasted like I cooked all day. Thank you.

This is a terrific recipe and provides a base to experiment until you find your perfect mix of textures and tastes. We like chicken thighs well done. They are fatty enough to lend themselves to the well done side and we cook this dish until the prosciutto and chicken skin bind and provide a crispy crust (almost 2 hours with the last half hour at 325 degrees). I also place the schrooms on the bottom and use Chardonnay as the wine type. The extra cooking time reduces the liquid skightly, but rather than reducing it further I take out a little of the liquid before I put it in the saucepan and make a slurry with corn starch (heaping TBS)to thicken the cooking juices, sour cream, wine mixture. I have extra the next day when I serve any leftovers with steamed Jasmine rice.

Very rich sauce.  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs wrapped in prosciutto and completed the sauce with a dry white wine. I enjoyed this delicious chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and its rich sauce! A new dish for those that have tried everthing!!! I love it! I can't wait to make it for my friends!!

I loved this recipe it was great and got great revews. I also used flattened chicken breasts. I added more than the 1 cup of recomended mushrooms, 5 different kinds of mushrooms, including portobella, italian brown, white button, shitake, annd morales. I made sure that almost all of the chicken was covered by mushrrom to prevent dryness and it worked. I had to add a tbsp of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce but other than that I followed the recipe. Thanks

This was just okay.  I prefer chicken breast so I used them instead of thighs.  We also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top when they came out of the oven for extra flavor.  I will try them again though and add some additional seasoning.  If you use breasts it cuts the cooking time down to about 20 minutes.  Pound them flat and just lay the prosciutto on top.

I've made this a couple of times now.  It has become a new family favorite.  The only thing I changed was technique. I used a casserole dish that could be used on the stove.  I melt the buter and garlic together.  After wrapping the chicken with the prosciutto I dip the bundles in the garlic butter to coat, and place them in the casserole pouring any remaining butter over the chicken.  Cover with foil and bake as directed, removing the foil for the last 10 minutes so the prosciutto could brown. After putting the chicken on the platter, I place the casserole on the stove.  Now I added the mushrooms to the pan drippings and reduce the broth a bit adding the wine and sour cream as directed. DE-lish.

My entire family loved this chicken. The only change I made was using boneless chicken breasts and stuffing them with Gouda before baking. So yummy!

I gave this 5 stars, but did improvise on a few things only because it's what I had on hand.  I used 4 chicken breasts, pounded thinner, and seasoned slightly with salt, pepper and fresh basil.  I used prosciutto ham wrapped in moz. cheese, sliced.  I sauteed 1/2 c. onion, 1 Tbs. garlic with the fresh mushrooms for 5 minutes.  Put the prosciutto on top of the chicken, then layered the slightly cooked mushrooms, onions and garlic on top.  Baked for 40 minutes and it was done to perfection.  I omitted the sauce, only because of hungry boys waiting, and it was awesome just like that.  I will make this again and I will make the sauce next time because it sounds so good that way.  It received raved reviews by all.

I agree completely with Cyn D.  If I could give this 10 stars I would.  One of the best I have tried from this site and I have tried alot!!  Only thing I did different was I fried extra mushrooms and added them to the sauce and I used skinless boneless chicken breast and covered the casserole dish when cooking.  My husband literally licked his plate!!  Awesome awesome!  I can't wait to serve this to my in-laws!  Thanks for the recipe!!  Update:  one reviewer said sauce is horrible and tastes like eating sour cream by the spoon.  It will taste like this if you don't reduce your sauce down quite a bit.  Also, to avoid dried mushooms, I covered the dish and cooked for one hour.  I fried the garlic in the fry pan before adding the sour cream, wine and juice from the chicken.  If this recipe  is absolutely wonderful if done correctly.  I had it again last night for all my family, and everyone love it!

This was very good, thank you so much to Koala Girl for he recommendation!  I made this for 2, using 4 small thighs.  I didn't want to wait for it to bake for 1 hour in the oven, so I first browned the thighs in a bit of evoo and butter w/s&p.  The I took the partially cooked thighs and rolled them in the prosciutto and poured the drippings into a baking dish and put them in the oven at 400 for just 15-20 minutes.  I followed the rest but used sherry instead of wine (I drank it!) and also added shallot to the garlic mix.  My mushroom choice was baby bellas.  BF usually does not like thighs but loved this dish.  Thanks so much for a keeper!

WOW, this recipe is AMAZING!  This is absolutely company worthy, trust me.  I didn't salt the chicken since the proscuitto is salty to begin with and I did add a pinch of garlic powder to the cream sauce.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!  Tiffuhny, outstanding recipe!  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I thought this was really tasty and easy! I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I used bacon instead of prosciutto, used chicken breasts instead of thighs, and used chicken stock instead of wine. The result was perfectly tasty. I'm definitely adding this to my menu rotations. Thank you!

Absolutely SUPERB!  My husband dubbed this my best chicken dish EVER, which is saying a great deal.  My 4 and 6 year olds were begging for seconds  This meal was a hit!!  I increased the garlic and used boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  I put the mushrooms under the chicken as per others' recommendations.  It was a great idea!  This will go down in  a short list of chicken recipes that we can't live without!!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

WOW!!  DOUBLE WOW!!!  This was AMAZING!  My husband likes to guess how much a certain dish would have been if we had ordered it in a restaurant.  He says this is a $19.95 dish! :)  I didn't have mushrooms, so I did the chicken (boneless breasts) with the garlic, butter, S&P and prosciutto for an hour (perfect!) and then used a can of cream of mushroom soup for the base for the sauce.  To the soup I added the sour cream, white wine, a little milk and the drippings from the chicken.  We served the sauce over the chicken AND mashed potatoes.  It was terrific!  Definitely a keeper, a 5 star recipe, and one of our new favorites.  THANKS!!

Excellent recipe.  Very easy, but looks like you fussed.  Used center cut bacon in place of the prosciutto as that is what I had on hand.

Chicken, mushrooms, prosciutto, garlic, wine, and sour cream?? How can this possibly be bad? I did this exactly as the recipe said, and it was not good. The sour cream doesn't make a sauce, more like a soup. Next time I would use heavy cream and flour to make an actual sauce. My boyfriend of 4 years said "this is the first dinner you've made that I haven't liked." And I totally agreed. A great start to a recipe, but don't make it as is!

I thought this was ok, but it needed some work.  For starters I would probably make again but with chicken breast.  I melted the butter with the garlic then tossed the mushrooms and laid in the bottom of the casserole dish.  I would probably cook covered if I made again and then remove cover during the last few minutes.  Also the sauce was way too watery.  Had to add some cornstarch to thicken it up.

this was so good!  i used chicken breast instead of thighs and cut the recipe to feed 2 people instead of 6.  i was iffy about using the wine for the sauce since im not a huge alcohol fan, even the taste of it in my food.  i decided i would try it with the wine and im very glad i did.  came out perfect.  i made some mixed veggies with it and just tossed those in the remaining sauce with some salt and pepper.  this is going in my  keeper box for sure.  might try it with thighs next time just to see if theres any difference in taste.  but certainly a 5 star with the breasts.

4 stars may be a little conservative. Great recipe!   Probably better with chicken breats, but still very good with thighs.   I added extra garlic because I love garlic and it was outstanding!   I used buttered noodles as a side with bread and all was good!

We enjoyed this very much.  The chicken was very moist and the proscuitto added so much flavor.  I did as other suggested and put the mushrooms underneath the chicken and they were beautifully cooked.  Next time I will try with chicken breast instead of the thighs.

This recipe tastes really good.  I especially liked the sauce which is also a really good sauce on noodles, although a little more white wine wouldn't be amiss.  
One thing, is that I thinkthe chicken could've stayed in the oven another 10-15 minutes.  The meat bordered on being done.

Company-worthy!  Easy!  Delicious!  I have been using allrecipes.com for a few years.  This was the first recipe that was SO good, I had to JOIN!  I made it as described with one small exception:  I used a cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce to make it a gravy.

If you choose to use some wine for the sauce, make sure to add some cornstarch-water solution to it, or it will be too runny.

We loved this!  Don't add salt because the prosciutto is plenty salty.  I may even omit the butter at the bottom of the pan and just spray a bit of Pam or use olive oil for a healthier way.  I used 3 medium portobellos and about 12 button mushrooms...don't cut too small because they shrink.  I used 12 boneless chicken thighs and baked in a 9 x 13 glass pan.  Will make again for sure!  Would be great for guests too!

Great dish!  We really enjoyed this one...I left out the butter as i figured the juices from the chicken and prosciutto would be enough - and they were!  I used cremini mushrooms and placed in the bottom of the dish with fresh garlic and fresh chopped rosemary (since I had some to use up and it does go so well with chicken!).  Baked as called for and used light sour cream with the white wine for my sauce...excellent!  My mushrooms stayed nice and tender, will definitely make again, but I think next time I would use boneless chicken instead of thighs since thighs tend to be a bit heavier and rich.  The prosciutto with cream sauce is rich enough that I think boneless chicken might be a better complement!  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe :-). A nice addition to my collection. A bit of an upgrade from my chicken and cream of mushroom if you know what I mean.  I cooked my chicken in a casserole dish. Coated with olive oil and minced garlic. Baked for the proper amount of time and it turned out perfect.  A suggestion is to cover the chicken with a mild-strong cheese I used Smoked Gouda thinly sliced to cover the chicken before covering with sauce. My side was angel hair pasta. To finish I used Asiago cheese much like Parmesan this cheese is aged longer and gives a stronger more intense flavor.

Champagne taste on a beer budget!  This was wonderful.  I followed others suggestions of putting the mushrooms on the bottom, and I also added one diced onion and a spinkle of dried rosemary.  The skin/prosciutto wasn't as crispy as I would like it, so I turned the oven onto broil for the last 5 minutes of cooking, which made a huge difference.  As others had mentioned, there was a lot of liquid, so I cooked it down to less than half before adding the wine.  I also substituted Crema Mexicana (Mexican Cream) for the sour cream for extra richness.  This is one that will WOW the crowds for dinner parties while staying on a budget.  Thanks so much for the recipe, and to everyone else who has taken the time to review it.

We love dark meat, and I thought we were going to find a new favorite recipe in this one.  We were disappointed, however, and I think it was probably my fault.  I used extra sliced mushrooms, and they totally dried out on top of the chicken and became quite rubbery.  Had I read all the reviews more carefully, I would have put them on the bottom.  Because of the extra mushrooms, I had extra liquid that I should have reduced before adding the wine and the sour cream.  Also, I tried to save some fat and calories by using low fat sour cream. The sauce was very thin due to my foolhardy changes.  I think this recipe has the potential to be five stars, if the mushrooms are either chopped or cooked underneath the chicken.  I will try it again!

I used 4 chicken breasts, rather than 6 chicken thighs.  Pounded the breasts, seasoned with S&P, plus a tiny touch of garlic powder, along with the fresh minced garlic. Then I rolled each breast up, wrapped in a slice of prosciutto, and held it together with a toothpick, placed it in the buttered baking dish, & topped it off with chopped portabello mushrooms.  Used a chardonnay for the sour cream sauce. This was my first time cooking anything with prosciutto; the flavor it lends to this dish, along with its drippings in the wine-sour cream sauce, are intense and SO good!  Thank you so much, Tiffuhny!  This is a great recipe!

Not bad.  But I think the chicken was a tad dry and the sauce could have used a bit more flavor.  I think next time I will skip the butter and use olive oil, and rub the chicken down with it before wrapping in the prosciutto.  I also recommend basting the chicken during cooking, and when it's done, reduce the sauce by half or so to intensify the flavor, as the sauce is missing "something"...hard to say what, but it needs a bit more flavor.   Otherwise, a great, easy meal for a weeknight, as long as you get home early enough to cook it!

Wow!  What a great recipe.  Only minor changes to the recipe were substituting chicken broth for the wine and adding a bit of flour to thicken the sauce at the end.  It was enjoyed by all and I will definitely be making this again!

I browned the chicken first in a skillet (3 chicken breasts halved and pounded flat) then placed 2 cups of mushrooms and one sliced onion at the bottom of the buttered baking dish.  I placed the ham-wrapped chicken on top of that.  I found it only took about 50 minutes to cook this way.  I used the juices from the skillet in which I browned the chicken plus the juices in the baking dish (which wasn't much) and I added about a cup of chicken broth, dash of apple juice and vinegar bc I didn't have any wine on hand, along with a tablespoon of chopped garlic.  Reduced this to about 1/2 then blended in only 1/4 cup of sour cream, and later sifted in about 1/2 tbsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce up (the original sauce amounts didn't yield as much sauce as I wanted).  This may be my favorite recipe on this website!  It's pretty simple and soooooo yummy- the savoriness of the mushroom with the tangy kick from the sauce and the chicken cooked just right.  It was a hit!

everyone liked it, but it was not a "wow" dish.  It took a little while for them to appreciate the flavor.  It had a great presentation, but I would have preferred if the sauce was thicker.

This recipe was so flavorful and delicious. I used regular thick cut bacon instead because that is what I had and it tasted amazing nonetheless. using the chicken oil to make the sauce made it kind of oily but it was still yummy. afterwards, I used the remaining sauce, cut more mushrooms up and put it on some pasta. the bacon added a great flavor and made the dish almost taste like pasta carbona. Devine.

OH MY DEAR GOD! This is amazing. I am a HUGE fan of Prosciutto and when I bought probably too much at the deli, I decided to try something new and Im so glad I did. This recipe had everything I love, prosciutto, garlic and mushrooms, and mind you, I did use ALOT more garlic and mushrooms then said on the recipe (I always tend to because I love strong garlic flavor in my food.. Used a clove of elephant garlic, and those suckers are HUGE)

But besides that everything else was the same. I know people hate when you dont use the exact measurements or substitute ingredients and then review food here, but Im sure that it tastes just as good if I followed the recipe exactly. 

TRY IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT! Im mad I even stopped eating to write this...

Made this tonight for dinner.  Used 2 large boneless skinless chicken breast which of courses decreases the amount of drippings for sauce.  First I partially split the breast and filled each with mushrooms, a slice of parmesan, fresh basil and minced garlic.  Then I wrapped the chicken breast in the prosciutto, topped with more basil, rest of garlic, other italian type seasonings and the mushrooms. To offset the lack of drippings I used 1 pack of chicken flavor boost and 1/3 C. water - mixed.  Next time I would only use 1/2 packet flavor boost as it is pretty salty. I poured this in the bottom of the baking dish and baked according to directions.   I made the sauce and added more mushrooms, basil, and a little cornstarch(mixed with a little warm water) to thicken.  It was yummo!  Next time, and there will be a next time, I may take some spinach, mushrooms, garlic, parmesan, and mushrooms - wrap that in another piece of prosciutto and stuff that inside the chicken breast before baking.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars as I think the additional spices gave it much more flavor than it would have otherwise had, but it is a great base recipe.

Delicious! Even teenager loved this and commented how yummy it was. The only changes I made was to saute the mushrooms first and add shredded Parmesan and a little cornstarch water mixture to thicken the sauce. The Parmesan gave it a wonderful mellower creamy flavor.

Very good and fairly easy recipe.  I did make a few minor adjustments, I browned the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms and garlic first.  Other then that, followed the recipe.

Excellent recipe. I sauteed the mushrooms in butter, garlic & rosemary before and put them on the bottom of the dish.  Everything came out wonderful and hubby gobbled it down and he usually isn't very fond of chicken.  Will make again.

Rich and delicious and pretty to look at.  I agree with someone who said not to put the mushrooms on top.  I tucked them in all the spaces between and around the chicken instead of on top.  Next time I'll use more butter to make more drippings!  And I think I'll add a little cracked pepper to the creamy  sauce (mmmmmmmm, creamy).
Thanks for sharing!

A definite "keeper".  My family loved it.  I used boneless/skinless thighs, so the cooking time was a bit less (about 40 minutes).  Served with buttered noodles and green beans.

I made this for my stepmother and dad. They said it was so-so (dad recommended wrapping it in bacon instead). I marinated the chicken in beer for an hour before cooking. I will be making this again at home.

This was dinner tonight and it was pretty good. I thought the end results was very pretty. I didnt like the idea of my mushrooms baking for an hour so i sauted seperately and topped it after the chicken was cooked. Other than that followed directions.

OMG this is amazing. Skip the whole sour cream part and just use a good jar of your favourite alfredo sauce. We didnt add the alfredo to the casserole dish, we just put the chicken breast on each persons plate, and then poured the alfredo over top! IT WAS INCREDIBLE. Thanks for the great recipe.

I had been wanting to make this recipe for a couple weeks and I finally got a chance to last night.  The presentation was nice and the chicken was good but I was really disappointed by the sauce.  It was like a stroganoff sauce.  Not really what I was expecting, but my fault for not realizing that with the ingredients listed that it was going to turn out that way.  Will try again with a different/lighter sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Ahh where to start. This recipe is just wrong on many levels. First, the sauce is desgusting. It tastes just like eating sour cream by the spoon. Second, in the time it takes for the chicken to cook through, the mushrooms and garlic will burn. While I am fine with shrunken chewey mushrooms, the burnt garlic turns bitter. Just do yourself a favor and skip this one.

I used chicken breasts and pounded them just a bit. Rolled them with motzerella cheese inside and wrapped with two slices of Prosciutto.  Add another cup of mushrooms with more galric to the bottom of the casserole dish before placing the breasts in the dish. Baked for 1 1/2 hours. Served it with angle hair pasta (sauce is amazing!) and asparagus.  WONDERFUL and so easy.

I made this recipe last night, and I can't stop thinking about how great it was! My family loved it.
I did put my chicken ontop of an onion and rosemary. I also used creamy havarti rolled in the chicken.
And I used a whole lot of mushrooms!
Great recipe I cant wait to make it again!

This was a good recipe. I followed all instructions except for using chicken breasts instead of thighs. I also seasoned the chicken before wrapping it in bacon with italian seasoning and basil. I thought the sauce was a little tangy, so next time I may use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 half and half. I served it over whole wheat penne, and my husband and I really liked it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. Easy to prepare. Be sure to have some "soppin bread" for the sauce. More mushrooms would be good too.

This is, by far, the best new recipe that I have found in a long while.  I prepared this chicken as a weekday meal for myself and my husband and we were both amazed with the depth of flavors from such a simple recipe.  I made a couple of modifications to fit our tastes, such as using a low-fat sour cream, using sliced portobella mushrooms, and garnishing with shaved Romano cheese (yum!), and got great results.  I will definitely be making this great chicken again and hope that everyone who finds this recipe will give it a try!

it was ok...not bad...but not great.  it lacked something but we couldn't figure out what.  my 12 year old daughter rated it a 4 star and my 15 year old daughter rated it a 3 star.  i'm giving it a 4 because i appreciate your sharing this recipe - thank you!  things i did different from recipe:  i wrapped 2 slices of bacon around each thigh, used lots of fresh sliced mushrooms and i didn't transfer back and forth from casserole dish etc. i cooked it all up in an ovenproof high sided skillet (would that be a chicken fryer?) and only transferred chicken over to a plate when i added the wine and sour cream.  i must say the cooking time for the chicken was perfect - i surprised myself as i usually end up with overcooked chicken; it was moist and juicy but fully cooked!  i was able to slice it up so nicely.  we ate ours with rice.  again, thank you for sharing!

I had to come back to this website to say thank you for this recipe.  I had to cook dinner for my new girlfriend and I really wanted to impress her. This was totally easy and my girl and I thought it was great.  If I can cook it and make it turn out, ANYONE can cook it!

What a lovely meal!  Quite simple to make and very elegant.  I liked the suggestions others had of using different types of mushrooms.  Bread for soaking up the sauce is a must.

DELICIOUS! I bet would be even better with portabellos - definetely opted to use the wine.  Did add a little more butter and turned chicken couple times during baking (worried it would be dry - I used breasts instead of thighs).  Served with mashed potatoes and french bread to make sure none of the delicious sauce went to waste!

Wow. Even though there are one or two things I will do differently next time, this was AMAZING. I used chicken breasts that I had pounded to an even thickness, and wrapped them in 3 slices of prosciutto that I secured with toothpicks. I used a turkey baster to moisten the chicken and chestnut mushrooms throughout the baking time (they were still just a touch too dry though). The cream sauce is absolutely fantastic - the flavors of the chicken and prosciutto juices are so subtle yet SO insanely flavorsome. I could drink it like soup... This recipe is so easy to make yet it looks and tastes like you spent all day on it. Thanks so much, Tiffuhny!

I did as others suggested and put some onions & mushrooms on the bottom of the pan. I also reduced the liquid before adding the sour cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe. The sauce could be more flavourful, but this is definitely a "keeper", I'm serving it for guests next weekend!

SPECTACULAR!!!  I followed all instructions precisely with one exception.  I made the chicken in my La Crueset dutch oven which I then took out of the oven and set on the stovetop.  After removing the chicken I made the cream sauce right in the pan (using the wine to deglaze).   

This has to be one of the greatest, most simple recipes I've EVER come across.  Kudos to the person who dreamed this up!  I'm definitely planning to make this for a dinner party.

To the person who said "This was just okay", perhaps you monkeyed with it a bit too much?  Chicken breasts tend to be larger and dryer, and there's very little fat in thinly sliced prosciutto.  Also I'm not sure adding cheese would be a recommendation.  The flavors of the original concept should definitely be tried before changing it up (imho ;)

And I, also, used boneless skinless chicken thighs like the person with the 8/21/2006 review.

I would not make it again. The flavor was pretty good but the sauce was VERY runny and the chicken and mushrooms dry. The mushrooms did plump up in the sauce but the chicken was still dry. The directions never said to cook with a cover but maybe that would have helped. We ate some of it and threw the rest away.

I should have known, making a cream sauce with sour cream...the sauce broke of coarse. It was OK, but something about a pallid oven baked chicken breast is just unappealing. Best to saute on the stove top and brown it and use real cream for the cream sauce.

Use bacon. Prosciutto is tough and not worth the additional expense.

Great easy meal. Used chicken breast cut in half, and 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of the wine. Added 1 tablespoon corn starch to the sauce to thicken it. Pairs well with broccoli and rice. So yummy a 7 year old liked it!

Very good! I especially loved preparing the meal. I seasoned my chicken with Mrs Dash table seasoning placing spinach on the chicken then wrap the prosciutto around the chicken. Can't go wrong with adding healthy greens. My boys loved it!

I think ham would have worked just fine in place of the prosciutto.  For the price, I didn't think the flavor was worth it.

I really enjoyed this! I added onions and put them on the bottom with the mushrooms like most people said. The sauce was perfect. Not watery at all. I cook almost every night but my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about this recipe! Thanks!

This was really good, but I think mine suffered a bit because I didn't use a high quality prosciutto. I'll definitely try this again though.

One word...YUMMY! This is the first review I have written on allrecipes. I am pretty picky about my food and I crave this. I usually serve it with basmati rice but have been making it with sautéed spinach and it ROCKS!

I used chicken tenders instead of thighs (I just really dislike thighs) and sprinkled parmigiano reggiano on the chicken in addition to the garlic, salt and pepper.  It of course took much less time to cook.  I served it with risotto and it was a huge hit.  Even my most picky eater loved it.  So good!

Very easy, indeed.   Had to double recipe as thighs were small.  Sauce was a bit then and very salty (which I like) so suggest reducing drippings with white wine quite a bit before adding Sour Cream.  I used portabello mushrooms, worked fine.

I made a few tweaks to use what I had on hand. I sauteed 2 portabello mushrooms along with cubed, firm tofu in olive oil, added a splash of rice vinegar while cooking with the garlic, threw in cooked, diced chicken and chopped cilantro at the end just before the sour cream. Boosted the protein while keeping the calories & carbs down to comply with Atkins. Excellent!

The family loved this one. The prosciutto provided such good flavor. Think I would have liked the sauce better without the drippings from the pan - but it was quite good and the chicken was very tender.

Absolutely fantastic. Used Hickory smoked bacon instead of Prosciutto, topped with portabella mushrooms. Served with a Italian flavored pasta. Left everything else the same. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious chicken but the prosciutto gets a little dried out during the baking process, making it very tough. Probably won't put this one in the regular rotation.

This was incredibly good! I used chicken breast since I had them on hand, and mixed some sliced onions in with the mushrooms. This was delicious served with garlic mashed potatoes and California blend veggies. The sour cream gave a different flavor to your typical cream sauce.

This will go in my recipe book as one of my all time favorties!!!  Fantastic  - and to top it off it is sooo easy.  The  thing that made it easier was that I cooked it right in a roasting pan so I could then just remove the chicken and do the sauce right in the pan over the stove.  I added a bit of flour to make it a bit thicker and would add more mushrooms becuase I love them.  (I also used light sour cream) Other than that it got rave reviews and I will definitely add it to my favorties!!

This is an excellent recipe! It looks difficult but is actually very easy to make. Use this one to impress a date! I rubbed  little garlic salt on the chicken thighs before wrapping in the prosciutto. I used imported prosciutto, which makes a difference. I cooked the chicken in an oven safe skillet, then reduced the sauce after adding 1/2 cup of wine and a little corn starch before adding the sour cream. The sauce came out fabulous--thick, creamy, and flavorful. Served it with a veggie and brown rice, which soaked up a bit of the sauce. Fantastic!

Very nice!  My family loved it.  I used chicken thighs, bone in, but removed the skins.  Bought some lovely Prosciutto di Parma from Whole Foods and a very good quality Chardonnay (used 1/2 c). I used clarified butter, roasted garlic, cremini mushrooms (doubled the amount), pure sour cream and fresh parsley.  Also tossed in some leftover sliced onions (1/3 c).  The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce rich yet not too heavy.  I'll make more sauce next time but other than that, will keep everything the same.  For those that didn't care for the recipe, make sure you are using quality ingredients.  In other words...a decent drinking wine.  It really does make a difference. Thanks Tiffuhny, nice recipe!

Nothing exceptional about this dish.  There are better recipes for chicken with cream sauce that are less expensive as well (minus the prosciutto).  Pretty bland.

Very tasty!  I only made a few minor changes:  I added one onion (sliced), doubled the amount of mushrooms, and laid both on the bottom of the pan before putting chicken on top to bake. I also used garlic powder b/c I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand, and the flavor came through just fine. I also pPut a little bit of flour in the sauce to thicken a little bit. Also, if you use chicken breasts, don't forget to cut your bake time to 20-30 minutes. Thanks again for a yummy and quick recipe!

My husband loved this, the flavor was really good, I just can't enjoy chicken on the bone (as much as I want to because of the $$$ savings). I used heavy cream instead of sour cream but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I will try with boneless, skinless chicken breast and cook it for less time. If you like chicken on the bone, highly recommend this recipe.

This dish was VERY easy to prepare and looked wonderful when it was done.  So wonderful, in fact, my husband said this was something that we need to make when we have company, and that was before he even tried it!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, just because I wanted to lighten it up, but I can tell it would be wonderful with thighs.  I also used a whole 8oz container of sliced mushrooms, and light sour cream.  I also covered the dish about halfway through baking, to encourage more drippings and to help it cook faster.  I thickened the sauce a bit with flour...it was perfect!  Serve with a long grain and wild rice mixture, and steamed asparagus--a meal fit for a king!

WINNER!  Keeper!  Oh, yum.  This I made as written with the exception of putting most of the mushrooms on the bottom on top of the butter.  I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce at the end, and I spooned it over capellini pasta.  I used three boneless skinless thighs and two boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded out to an even thickness, and for three of us I had enough for leftovers for tomorrow.  You could add something else to it, but I'm not sure why you would.  So good!  Thank you!

SUPER, finely a recipe with chicken thights the tastiest part of the chicken. And for all you that used tasteless chicken breasts and said the meal was just OK what do you expect that's what seasoned cardnoard tastes like.

I didn't have prosciutto, so I used bacon. I also added half a sliced onion to the bottom of the baking dish with the butter and garlic. The chicken made
a lot of liquid and didn't seem to be cooked all the way through after 45 minutes, so I ladled it out and cooked it another 20 minutes on a baking sheet.
Other than that, this dish was cake. AND SO DARN GOOD. I served it with buttered noodles. 

I would give it five stars based on how my kids and I loved it, but my husband was not as enthusiastic about it. Shame
because it's definetely a great dish.

Oh my God, the taste of this was amazing.  Best new dish I've cooked in a long time.  Didn't get much drippings so I added a chicken broth ice cube to the butter. I didn't know if this should bake covered or not and the recipe did not state, so I went uncovered.  Maybe that was the problem.  Also added another broth cube to the sauce.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Used breast instead of thigh.  This was a great tasting meal.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely add this recipe to my favorites list !!

A true gourmet recipe! I made everything in a pan since I was using the oven for something else and added fresh rosemary. My boyfriend said twice that he really liked it (usually, he's more of the silent kind!).

This was so delicious!  I did make a few changes though.  I used chicken breast and will agree it was slightly dry (would probably be excellent in a crock pot), used turkey bacon, baby bella mushrooms and lite sour cream.  The sauce makes this dish!  Using the drippings gave it so much flavor.  Sauce was thin and enough to put over noodles as a side dish!

Everyone loved this. I thought it a little bit rich but it got good reviews with my guests. I made it exactly as stated except there was so much oil/fat in the drippings that I separated it out. My only problem was the sauce was very thin and I used corn starch to thicken it.

Everyone loved this recipe! I used bacon instead of the prociutto (sp?) and 3 kinds of mushrooms (baby bellos, shiitake, and italian brown). Will definately make again.

Loved this recipe.  I used bone-in breasts and they came out super tender and delicious.  I would recommend using the wine, though, as I felt it really gave the sauce an excellent taste.

Very easy, with good flavor. Used bacon instead of proscuttio - chicken came out well flavored and tender. Added a little worchestershire sauce and lemon juice to the sauce, along with the wine, since it was a bit bland for our tastes, and added a dash of fresh parsley. Tasted great!

This dish is delicious, made it this evening. I did cover the dish in the oven as I do not  like it when the mushrooms dry out. I found there was a lot of liquid, I brought the mixture to the boil and rendered it down until it thickened. I did not have prosciutto so I used bacon and removed the skin off the chicken thighs.

Excellent.  I placed sliced onions, garlic and sliced mushrooms on bottom of pan.  Placed 4 browned pounded chicken breasts on top and baked covered for 30 minutes.  The sauce needs to be thickened.  Definitely will cook this again!

Followed recipe exactly as it said. Cheese sauce came out a little thin, but very tasty! My family loved the dish! Next time I will cook down liquid before adding sour cream in order to make a thicker sauce. Otherwise a quick and easy meal.

I made this with boneless chicken breasts and Gouda cheese.  I cooked it about 30 minutes.  It was very good, chicken stayed moist.  I served it with angel hair pasta and poured the sauce over it all.

Delicious, made this for my keto diet and by far one of my favourite keto recipes yet. Cheap, quick and easy to make and comes out so delicious. Only thing I changed was I used 1 tablespoon garlic instead of 2 only because that’s all I had. Next time I’ll use 2. Thank you for this recipe I’ll be making this again for sure.

This dish was barely edible. The ham & mushrooms turned black by the time the chicken was cooked.

An amazing meal; as elegant in presentation as it is delicious! My only deviation from the recipe was that I made my own white sauce w/ mushrooms. It turned out great!

My only deviations from the recipe are that I used two chicken breasts instead of  six thighs, and I placed the mushrooms on the bottom as other reviewers recommended.

I thought it was just ok. The chicken was a little bland. Required a lot sauce for flavor. And the sauce was pretty good, but needed something else. It kind of tasted like what you would expect if you mixed sour cream with white wine. Missing some depth, even after adding the pan drippings. Like maybe some grated parmesan and garlic, and some more salt.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs also. To make up for the lost flavor from the juices that would be from the skin, I substituted a couple of chicken bouillon cubes and dissolved in the butter for the dish which preserved a lot o the extra flavor. Also added a good bit more black pepper which made it a little spicy hot too.

Didn't make any changes, it was awesome.  The thighs were on the small side so I made two per person and they were a hit.  the wine was a good addition and then of course served a glass of white with the meal.  Served it with a nice Greek Salad on the side and the plates were clean before they went in the dishwasher.  Definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again.

This is delicious.  I followed the suggestions of others and put the chicken on top of the onions and mushrooms.  I used garlic, salt and pepper to my liking and omitted the cooking wine.  My kids LOVED it.  I am trying with pork chops tonight.

Definitely needed more mushrooms for my taste but otherwise pretty yummy. I think I'll try  putting a rack in the pan so the chicken crisps a bit more next time.

OMG! My hubby and I loved this recipe! I even messed up on directions and was worried, but it still came out a 10 star rating!!!! I used boneless chicken breasts as well, mushrooms on the bottom, and as mushroom lovers, sautéed extra in the oils and garlic and added that to the top. AMAZING!!!! Will definitely make it again and again. Oh, and the sauce is amazing over both the chicken and with angel hair pasta!

This was a very good recipe and I would make it again. The only difference I did was put the mushrooms on the bottom of the pan along with an onion, per comment suggestion and it was great. I thought it turned out a little salty so I would use less salt to season the chicken since the prosciutto is also salty. However if you pair this dish with a side of mashed potatoes or bread that will help tone down the saltiness. Overall very pleased with the outcome. Thanks for the recipe!!

Might have been good with a different cream sauce recipe, but the sour cream/white wine just did not work for me & my family.  Ended up tossing most of it out.

Sauce was truly decadent. I used regular white cooking wine. My boys loved this dish as well. I followed it pretty much as is. Very rich and flavorful. I did use chicken breasts instead of thighs because it was what I had on hand.  I poured the mushrooms into the pan when I whisked in the wine and sour cream to make the sauce. A divine dish. I served it with baked potatoes (sauce was delicious over the baked potatoes) and had also sauteed garlic with asparagus and red peppers. A great meal! Thanks!

What a great dinner!  I served this dish with buttered egg noodles and roasted brussel sprouts. I covered the dish with foil for about 25 minutes and then pulled the mushrooms out of the chicken pan because they were not cooked enough for me.  I sauted the mushrooms with white wine.  I then put the mushrooms to the side and poured the drippings from the oven pan into the cast iron with all the good mushroom flavor.  I added homemade chicken stock, white wine and the sour cream.  At the last minute I put the chicken under the broiler to crisp up the pancetta.   We will make this again.

Absolutely fantastic!  I was amazed at how quick and easy it is to prepare.  The sauce is also great on pasta.  When I made it the second time I had to use canned mushrooms but it was still great tasting and an elegant presentation.  I did use chicken breasts and put the garlic under the skin for  better flavor.

This was delicious. I used chicken breast tenders because that was all I had at the time.  I only baked at 350' for about 40 minutes.  I will definitely make this again with chicken thighs.

"Easy" is an understatement.  For a change, I actually followed a recipe to the letter, using 4oz thighs I deboned and portioned myself.  The slight tang of the sour cream and the  wince in the sauce complemented the prosciutto-wrapped chicken perfectly.

Aside from the fact that my sauce-to-chicken ratio resulted in leftover sauce, I have no complaint about this recipe. My family loved it.

This turned out good.  Like others, I put the mushrooms on the bottom and glad I did.  The cream sauce was good but I have tried others that I liked better.  Could have been the white wine I used that only made it good, but not great.  What was nice about this recipe is that I made 4 of the chicken breast and we had 2 of them with the cream sauce for dinner and then the next day I cut the other two in rounds and put them of top of a salad which my hubby and I thought was really good.  Thanks for recipe!

Just OK. I sprinkled onion powder on the chicken at the same time as the salt, pepper, and garlic. The prosciutto; (which is pretty expensive) didn't really add a lot of flavor. For the sauce, I added a lot of pepper, and a pinch of tarragon. I did use dry sherry, instead of dry white wine. Overall, if I make it again, I would add some different seasoning, and I think I would try using pastrami instead of prosciutto.

This was so easy and tasted great. My husband was sure I had worked hard to make it, little did he know how simple it was! I will be making this again and may put some swiss cheese in the middle of the chicken before I wrap them. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

I liked it but agree with others that this recipe would be better with chicken breast. I used a little olive oil in the bottom of the casserole for 1/2 of the butter. I did like the way it browned on the bottom.

I used bone-in, skinless thighs and followed the recipe except I used chicken broth instead of wine. The drippings made a perfect sauce, delicious!! To keep dinner low crab, I roasted fresh broccoli and garlic with EVOO the last 30 minutes while the chicken was baking??

This was quick and easy to make. The presentation was pretty but it lacked in flavor a little. Next time I will use a thicker cut of prosciutto or use regular bacon. Which will also add more flavor. The sauce was to thin so I thickened it up with a little corn starch. I will give it another try.

I will definitely make this recipe again!  I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The only change I made, a few extra mushrooms and next time I will add a few more seasonings like herb de provence.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing that I did differently was I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil, and next time I will use half and half instead of heavy cream-(less fat) I don't think it will affect the overall flavor of the dish. Enjoy!

I covered the dish for most of the cooking, and next time I'll only uncover it for the last 5 minutes.  Because at that heat it dries out fast.  Loved the sauce especially.

Can't wait to make again! Hubby wants me to make it for a family dinner with the in laws.  He rarely asks for a dish again so for me this was a hit.  Quick, easy, love using theigh meat.  It's moist and flavorful.  I used a dry reisling in the sauce as that's what I had on hand.  The sauce really makes this dish taste gourmet!  winner winner!

This is very good! I added some heavy whipping cream (and corn starch for thickening) to the sauce and served with angel hair multigrain pasta. Oh, and I used Marsala because I had no white wine on hand. My husband loved it!

I found this recipe to be that sweet spot of recipes....  Easy to prepare, yet tastes like it's not!    My husband, who is not a fan of cream sauces, said "wow -- this is really good chicken" after just one bite.   So this little gem is a keeper and going into my favorites box for sure.   I flash cooked the thighs on the stove top first just to quickly brown each side.   Then wrapped them in bacon and set them atop the bed of butter and mushrooms.   Doing this allows for a faster cook time that does not require covering the pan with foil at all (50 minutes) AND the bacon cooks more evenly on all sides of the chicken.   Since others had complained of a runny sauce, I cooked my down to reduce it to about half the liquid before adding the sour cream.   Came out perfectly.     I did use 8 thighs instead of 6 because they are so small.    A wonderful dish with beautiful presentation!!

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I prepared it as written, however next time I may sauté the mushrooms on top of  the stove then add them to the sauce.  They were kind of dried when put on top of chicken and in the oven.

I followed all the instructions true to the recipe except that I tried it with a few boneless, skinless breasts as well as a few thighs. I also cooked them for a half hour uncovered, then another hour covered, and they all were excellent! Juicy and very tender. Great recipe!

Will add to my rotation! Put the mushrooms on bottom as suggested by other members and added sweet onions and red bell peppers with them. I did add some chives to the sauce for both taste and color. Very pleased!

Yummy. Anything with bacon is good, Did not have prosciutto so just used bacon. Add some flour with sauce to make a roux. I like  my sauces on the thick side.  I wanted a little color, so I added some orange bell pepper with mushrooms. I will be making dish again.

Easy to make, has good flavors and a lot of possibilities. Too much garlic, even for a garlic lover like me - it can be cut in half. The sauce becomes too thin if the chicken renders a lot of juices, so it might be wise to use just half of it, and add it on as seen fit. The sauce will thicken a bit as it sits. The sliced mushrooms shouldn't stay on top of the chicken in the oven, or they will get too dry. Try to put them beside or under the chicken pieces. Other than those details, simple, easy and flavorful dish. Goes well with a side of mashed potatoes.

This was excellent! and I will certainly make it again. I love that you have plenty of time to do other things while it is in the oven.  I started it off in an oven-proof pan rather than dirty a casserole dish.  My sauce didn't thicken quite the way I wanted but was so good anyhow I forgave myself.  A word of warning though, plus the reason for 4 stars rather than 5.  The prosciutto is, of course, very salty. I think it would have been a bit better to specify using "unsalted butter" to prevent the dish being too salty. There is no need to salt the chicken prior to cooking - just the pepper is fine.  Well done Tiffuhny!  Excellent post and thank you!   Just want to add I am so happy to find another recipe to use sour creme - so another Thank You to Tiffuhny!  Would also like to hear from others whether they chose skinless/boneless or full on. Did they think it made a difference.

I didn't make any changes. Thought it was great. The sauce was good over the asparagus I made with the chicken. 
I will make this again 
Thanks

This was a BIG hit with my family - super delicious.  I used thin sliced chicken breast and cooked at 450 for 25 minutes.  I added a bit of Parmesan cheese to the sauce.

This turned out amazing!  Thank you to all that said that you should put the mushrooms on the bottom.  I used extra garlic and the sauce had a great flavor.  Chicken thighs are pretty small, I used just the six that it called for so, each guest only had one.  Next time I will make sure there is enough for everyone to have 2 ????. Great dish!

Made it for a small dinner gathering and it was very good, and so easy!  I used chicken breast ( not pounded) and covered the whole top w mushrooms.  I baked longer than stated until the mushrooms and prosciutto bound together w the chicken, about 1.5 hrs.  My sauce was thin as I had very little sour cream but we used what we had and it was delicious.  Next time I would not salt the chicken as the prosciutto adds that anyway.   Certainly easy to make, looks great, and easy to play w as others have suggested

This was good enough. I think some of the mistakes were mine, but I also think it would have been pretty tasteless just prepared as written. I used boneless skinless thighs, because it's easier and healthier. Also skipped the melted butter. I did prepare the mushrooms (a LOT of mushrooms) ahead of time by sauteing them with garlic in an ounce of bacon and a tiny bit of oil. Then after they were soft, I added 1/4 cup sherry. I put this and some water-packed diced artichoke hearts in the bottom of the pan.I used 10 boneless skinless thighs and about 1/4 lb prosciutto, sliced very fine. I would use a bit more next time. It took longer than I expected in the oven (maybe 45 minutes - a lot for boneless!) and then when I added the drippings/mushrooms to my pan with the (fat free) sour cream and more sherry, I got distracted and it boiled, breaking the sauce. I'm not sure if it would have broken anyway since it was fat free, but I've never had that problem before. It was still tasty, just ugly. I served it with quinoa risotto and garlicky green beans. It was a tasty meal, but not as healthy as most of my food. It also took more work. I'm not used to salting my food, since I usually use strong spices like curry, but it was a nice "bistro" moment. My boyfriend said he liked it, but we'll see if we finish all the leftovers...

this was great! instead of adding mushrooms to the chicken, i took a spoonful of the cooking liquid and sauteed the mushrooms and an onion then added the rest of the liquid, wine, and sour cream.  it was great and easy! i also used prosciutto on half the chicken, and pancetta on half. it was great!

This recipe was wonderful!  I usually totally follow directions the first time I make a recipe, but I had 1 hour and 20 minutes to throw this recipe together last night, so I had to make some modifications.  I doubled the recipe to start with and used chicken breast tenders.  I seasoned the chicked with seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I then minced about 5 cloves of garlic and mixed it with the mushrooms and placed that in the bottom of the 9x13 dish, then placed the wrapped chicken on top.  I baked the chicken at 375 using a convection oven, so it was finished in about 40 minutes.  I used fat free sour cream for the sauce so as to cut back on the calories.  I also ended up adding about 1/2 tsp granulated chicken broth and a few dashed of black pepper to the sauce just to give it a little more flavor.  The dish smelled heavenly cooking and my family loved it.  Next time I make it, I will add a slice of fontina cheese to the chicken/proscuitto wrap.  Definately a simple, delicious, and relatively quick meal.  Thanks for sharing and I look forward to making this many times in the future!!

I would have to say, definitely sauté the mushrooms versus baking them.  They were a little dry.  With out the sauce, the whole dish would've been dry.  Make sure to use plenty of prosciutto too.  I could've used more!  The was a "B" in my book.

Didn't have prosciutto, did without.  Added the following to the sauce:  salt (1/4 t), pepper (1/8 t), poultry seasoning (few shakes).  Cooked the thighs in a skillet for about 20 minutes, then scraped the drippings into the sauce.  Yum!  Served sauce on the side, so even my pickiest eater thought it was fine.

My husband and I had never tried prosciutto but had bought some to try this recipe. turns out we don't like it. I realized I didn't have white wine (and being Sunday I guess we were SOL) I used red and the sauce came out great.

This was the first time I tried this recipe.  It turned out great!   I used chicken breasts and like a few of the other reviews recommended I wrapped the chicken with the prosciutto and then put some of the mushrooms in the bottom of the pain to help crisp them up a little more.  Turned out awesome, and I got lots of compliments!

Maybe I missed something here, but I thought this was "OK".  My mistake may have been that I used thighs that were not boneless.  The thighs took 1 hr and 20 minutes to cook.  The cream sauce was marginal.

I made this recipe as is.  My guests really liked it.  I thought it was just okay because I didn't really care for the chicken thighs.  I would probably like it better with chicken breasts, but that may make it too dry.

Very nice, and it looked pretty on the plate.  I prepared this for two, and baked the chicken in a small cast iron skillet.  When done baking, I simply set the meat aside and finished the sauce in the skillet (cleanup was a snap).  I'll make again, but will add something extra to give it a bit more punch, perhaps even just a few more grinds of pepper.  Could be served with an arugula salad and that would be perfect.

Passed the 1 yr and 3 yr old test. Husband thought it good but didn't rave about it. I thought it was very good. I comes out very, very tender: almost falling apart which I like. Used bacon and a touch of cornstarch to thicken.

I have been making this recipe now for about 7 months. It has become my "special occasion" meal. It is a perfect recipe, tastes truly amazing and is so impressive. Sometimes I make it with whole chicken breasts if we are really hungry. I know this recipe off by heart and thank you so much for posting it! I serve it with garlic mash and steamed asparagus.

This was good, I didnt use the sour cream tho, I had bought heavy cream for it instead, think I had confused it with another recipe. The heavy cream worked out fine, think it would taste better than the sour cream, just my opinion. I did the mushrooms on the bottom of the chicken like others did, and thickened with cornstarch at the end.

This was super good & easy!! I added 2 shallots and 2 cups shitake and button mushrooms and 2 more tablespoons of butter to make more sauce.  I also added some salt and pepper to the sauce and tiny bit of parmesan cheese when I spooned the sauce over the chicken.  Served with brown rice. Im going to try breast next since Im not a fan of thight meat.  A good gourmet dish for company.

This was good, but I'll add to the sauce nest time.  I made this in my cast iron skillet, and substituted chicken broth for the wine.  I was really annoyed when I got home from the deli and was given cooked ham instead of proscuitto.  It still worked okay, but proscuitto would have been better.

This was a good recipe.  I almost didn't make it because of the cost of prosciutto, but I found that by getting it cut at the deli at my local grocery store it was a lot cheaper than buying the pre-packaged stuff.  I only paid 1.18 for all the prosciutto I needed.  I used jarred alfredo sauce instead of making the sauce with wine and sour cream.  I was in a rush and it worked great.

very good and very easy to make. I decided to cook it as a special going away dinner for my husband. He was impressed. I still feel that it could have used "something" else, but I dont know what.

This recipe is outstanding!  I didn't change a thing, even the amounts of the other ingredients when I only cooked 2 thighs.

Absolutely fantastic!!  Next time I will add some cornstarch or flour at the end to thicken the sauce a little, but otherwise this is a delicious recipe.

I really enjoyed this one - the sauce is great!  I personally think it needs more muchrooms so I added some to the sauce while it was cooking and I also added a bit of corn starch.  I will also try covering it next time to keep the mushrooms moist.   There are so many things you can do to add your own little twist to the recipe, I can't wait to try it again!

This was one of the best recipes I have tried from this website!  I added onions and mushrooms at the bottom of the dish.  I added 1 TBSP of cornstarch and thought the sauce was still runny until I actually poured it on the chicken.  It was perfect!  Next time, I am not going to add the cornstarch.  This is a must try!

Really good! I used smart-balance instead of real butter, as well as low fat sour cream. The chicken tasted really good, however I got some bites that tasted rather chemically. I blame the smartbalance for this, and next time I'll use real butter (but still low fat sour cream.)

Very tasty! The sauce came out way too thin but that can be easily remedied with a little corn starch and water.  Leftovers the next day were just as good.  I will make this one again!

This was great!  I used it for the first time I cooked my boyfriend and his son dinner.  I was so nervous, but it turned out great!  I used bacon and chicken thighs instead, and served it with garlic mashed potatoes.  Yay awesome recipies!

I made this recipe based upon all the rave reviews.  Had some chopped green onions on hand, so tossed them in the casserole.  This was very tasty, but I felt the sauce needed to be thickened a little.  I did, and mixed a little corn starch & water and made a more desireable looking sauce.

Really good - I like it with thighs but prefer breasts. I saute the breasts in a pan then add the mushrooms and create the sauce. The sour cream is added last, stirred and served immediately to prevent the grainy look and butter separation.

This recipe is one of the best chicken recipes ever!  It's a cross between chicken cordon bleu and a stroganoff.  I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch and 1/4 cup of chicken broth to thicken up the sauce.  A perfect chicken dish.

Very tasty! I used light butter and fat free sour cream, just to make it a tad lighter, but it was still great! We didn't have mushrooms on hand, so I just omitted them, but next time I will make it a point to go to the store and get some! Very simple and very elegant.

My husband and I both liked the chicken recipe but the sauce left a little to be desired. I normally don't care for sour cream very much except sparingly but hubby is a fanatic for it. I thought the wine would make it better along with the pan drippings. The sauce was edible but was a bit sharp tasting and the wine only made that more pronounced. The chicken was VERY good. I served the leftovers the next day with alfredo sauce and now have a company worthy recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. However, I doubled the mushrooms, since they shrink quite a bit. I spooned them over the chicken and poured the rest of the sauce over all. Also, I used skinless thighs with bone in. Came out great !

Didn't really like this one. I added the garlic & the mushrooms to the sauce rather than baking them in the oven with the chicken. The sauce had an over powering taste of wine, it needed something else to balance the flavour of the wine & sour cream.

This was really good. My boyfriend loved it and couldn't stop raving! I thought it was good (I'm not a huge fan of cream sauces) but his response warrants a 5 star review. I didn't really change anything except to sautee the mushrooms rather than cook them with the chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and the leftovers were excellent! I added lemon juice and worchestershire to the sauce for zing, and I put the mushrooms on the bottom layer to absorb the flavour more. Yum!

I gave this a 3 or 4 while DH says it's a 5. First time I cooked it, I threw everything in a crock pot and used Turkey Bacon instead. Second time was to the letter. DH prefers it cooked in the crock pot.

To me this meal was just ok. It really was'nta 5 start to me.. the sauce was not too diffrent from a thinned out alfredo sauce.. 
I'll try it again to see if there was anything i did wrong...
