This is really yummy and easy to make. I only had a 40 oz can of sweet potatoes though, so I just added a bit extra of all the other ingredients. I also didn't have cloves, so I added some nutmeg instead. I thought it was just a touch too sweet though. Next time I'll probably add a bit of orange juice, to offset the sweetness. And since the recipe didn't say whether or not to drain the sweet potatoes, I drained most of the juice and put in about 1/3 cup. Overall, a fantastic recipe. =)

This recipe is similar to the sweet potato recipe my mother used to make. She is from Barbados and they know how to use sweet potatoes. The difference is in her recipe-- she uses coconut milk (which can be found in a can in most grocery stores in the "ethnic" section instead of milk and we add about a cup of raisins which have been soaking for several weeks in rum! If you don't have that much time, soaking them in rum overnight will work, too! Instead of lemon juice we use lime juice plus using the zest of half of the lime right in the mix. The lime juice gives it a real Caribbean taste.  I will substitute all spice or pumpkin spice for the ginger, cloves and cinnamon.  This dish sure beats the boring sweet potatoes and marshmallow dish seen in most American homes. Give it a try for something special and different.

This dish was a huge hit at a Thanksgiving-themed potluck.  I tweaked it a little by adding 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg.  I also garnished it with chopped pecans.  I agree with the prior reviewer that the dish is very sweet and I may try the orange juice as well.  Definitely a staple for Thanksgiving dinners to come!

Not too bad making it for the first time, I'm sure it'll turn out better next time! I used regular sugar and fresh sweet potatoes (boiled and peeled).

Good recipe. I also used some of the juice from the yams and it came out pretty good. I did triple the recipe and forgot to triple the time so we had this for dessert with cool-whip and everyone loved it!

This recipe came out ok.  It wasn't sweet enough for my taste.   I will make it again and sweeten it up a little.

I heard about Sweet Potato Pudding, on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Then I looked it up and found this scrumptious recipe on your site, thank you, and will let you know how it was when I cook it. Blessings to all.
