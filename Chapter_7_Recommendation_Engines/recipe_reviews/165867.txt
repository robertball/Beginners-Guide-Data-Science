Very nice.  Couldn't have been any easier. Love that it doesn't have all that 'junk' like bottled salad dressings.

Really quick and easy!  I have made this several times and varied the herbs and seasonings at my whim.  It is excellent as printed, although I prefer slightly less vinegar, maybe 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Another time I added fresh dill, freshly chopped garlic, and fresh snipped parsley along with the basic sour cream, mayo, milk, and vinegar recipe.  This is a nice basic creamy dressing recipe.
