I love kimchi, so I was excited to try this. I thought it was great! I had a small corned beef, so I cut most of the ingredients in half. I used half of the spice packet. I also used about 3/4 lb. of mild kimchi, which came in a fancy pouch, and 1/4 lb. of spicy kimchi, thinking my kids might eat it (they weren't fans). Next time I'd up the spicy kimchi. I kept the full amount of potatoes, though, and added a softball-sized green cabbage cut into wedges. I cooked the corned beef in the pressure cooker, let the pressure come down naturally, then pressure cooked it again with the potatoes for about 5 minutes. When the pressure came down, I added the other vegetables and simmered until tender. Great meal, and terrific leftovers.
