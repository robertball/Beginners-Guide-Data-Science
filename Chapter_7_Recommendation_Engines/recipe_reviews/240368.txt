I used two summer squash and zucchini so it took a little longer to saute the vegetables, only because there were too many in the pan.  I may saute them separately next time. But the final product was a huge hit.  I fed 7 people, then 3 more afterward, and still had some left over. Everyone loved it! 
I confess I didn't have Red Gold brand so I used store brand.  But thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

EXCELLENT Ratatouille!  I made three changes based on taste and preferred texture:  While sauteeing the veggies I added about two teaspoons of curry powder.  Based on some of the reviews that said it was too mushy, I checked it after 4 hours and determined it was done.  I also reduced the tomatoes to just 14 oz.  This recipe brought back wonderful memories of my mom's ratatouille.  As kids we LOVED saying the word and joking that we were eating stewed rats!  Kids can be strange.

Delicious!  Very flavorful!  Used as a side dish rather than entree, as I did not think it was filling enough.

I didn’t sauté the veg prior to cooking in the slow cooker and they came out full of flavour, soft but still in shape and not mushy.
I used fresh parsley and thyme instead of dried, left out zucchini,( as it wasn’t available) and added mushrooms. I used tomato and mushroom pasta sauce instead of tinned tomatos for added flavour. I also added aduki beans for superfood and protein! So delicious!

This was delicious! My 11 year old hates eggplant and I have to hide vegetables in order to get him to eat them. He loved this dish and ate it all. I hoped to have leftovers but not a chance. I'm not sure what you're supposed to serve this dish with, but I served it over ravioli. YUM

This was ok. I found the squash, egg plant and red pepper was to soft. Having never had ratatouille, I am not sure if that is the way its supposed to be, but would have preferred them to have some substance. However, it was very flavorful. I printed this recipe to go shopping but never noticed there is any reference to green bell peppers until you get to the directions to add it.

Loved this recipe. A very healthy dinner. I added turkey Italian sausage links that I fried and cut into bite size pieces. It was delicious.

I have already made this delicious dish a second time!  The flavor is wonderful!  I used half of the amount of crushed tomatoes and didn’t include peppers to suit several family members’ preferences.  Very good the first day and makes super leftovers!

Have made this so many times, we love it. I found that replacing the summer squash with sweet. potato really made this dish pop. The little extra effort to saute your veggies first is well worth it. Cast iron skillet does a great job.

I always make recipes exactly as written the first time.   This turned out well.  As other reviewers mentioned it does take quite a lot of time to saute the veggies, and next time I would use two pans to do this step.

Tasty but I made changes. I don’t like things too “tomato-e”, so I added only one 15 oz can of drained petit diced tomatoes and used half a jar of sun dried tomato spread with a tablespoon of curry powder. Cooked the rest according to the directions and it turned out super yummy. Will make again.

Basically it's a very good recipe. I did make a few adjustments for our tastes. I omitted the peppers and tomato sauce.
Decided to make in my oven instead of crock pot, which was  a perfect alternative. Baked @350° for about two hours. It was very tasty and I made it again today because I had more vegetables to use up.
Like most tomato based dishes it becomes tastier over a few days in frig.  It didn't taste quite the same as a dish of similar veggies I had in Italy yrs. ago, but we ate all of it, ??.
I'm going to make for friends later this summer.

I did make two changes in that I broiled the vegetables rather than  sauteing them and I added additional fresh basil and fresh thyme to the crock pot. It was good - but not great. Way, way too tomato-y for us. It was like spaghetti sauce on vegetables. I served with fresh basil, fresh parsley, and three different types of cheeses to top off the portions.

Too mushy, tomato flavor overbearing.  I am looking for another recipe.

This was really good! I did not have zucchini or yellow squash, used Mexican squash that is similar, fresh thyme and Tom sauce instead of paste. Will definetly make this again!
