This was a delightful surprise.  I'm the one in the house who normally can't stand beets, so I picked this on a whim.  Imagine my shock to find myself absolutely loving a beet dish for the first time ever!!

I liked the taste of fresh cooked beets. A nice change from the usual tinned variety. However did not like the ginger in this at all. It didn't work well with the beets. It made them too spicy / peppery. Mustard with the orange juice would work much better instead of ginger.

This was pretty good.  I used dried pineapple instead of the candied ginger based on another reviewer's complaint about the spiciness of the ginger.  The pineapple worked well.  The recipe mostly tastes like beets in thick orange juice.  Not hugely exciting, but not bad either.  It might actually be more fun with pineapple juice instead of the orange juice.  The pineapple and nuts (I used pecans instead of walnuts) were an added bonus.

I thought I did not like beets in any recipe.  This one is good and my husband liked it too.
