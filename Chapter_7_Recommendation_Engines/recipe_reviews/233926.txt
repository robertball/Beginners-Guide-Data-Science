I loved this recipe! I used 12 oz. of tuna from a can (drained) instead of a 7-oz. packet. I also added a can of Italian stewed diced tomatoes because my marinara sauce can was 24 oz., not 28 oz. I also used shell pasta since that's what I had on hand. Everything else stayed the same, and it was so great! Highly recommend it!

It was good, nothing fabulous.  But it was about as good as I could expect canned tuna to taste in a main course meal.  I was afraid the fishy taste would overtake the flavor of the recipe but it really didn't.  I recommend this recipe for an easy & quick weeknight recipe.

I made this for my kids and I when my non-tuna loving husband was away on business.  I was skeptical, because although my kids and I like tuna, I remember not really being a fan of tuna casseroles when I was younger.  Anyhow, it looked like a relatively quick & easy mid-week meal and I had all the ingredients on-hand, so I tried it.  We all really liked it....that inclues a 9-y.o. who would happily survive on PB&J & pizza for the rest of his life.  He's not a fan of zucchini, but said he really liked it in this dish.  I halved the recipe and it made enough for the three of us to eat it two nights in a row.  I love meals like this that don't have an extensive amount of ingredients and yet are still super flavorful.  This is definitely a repeat!

I made this using a rotisserie chicken instead of tuna, and it was delicious.  I’m sure it’s just as goo with tuna.  Use what you have.  It’s good and easy. Thanks Chef

I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of marinara sauce and seasoned it with korma curry paste. Also instead of tuna I used smoked tofu. There are so many different fun ways to change up simple recipes like this.

This was a very good everyday dish.  I froze several serving and took it for lunch.

I must admit this was the first Chef John recipe I have made that did not "wow" me. It was okay, but I  really was not able to taste the tuna at all. For me I think a full pound of pasta was too much and overpowered the rest of the ingredients. I may try again with less and pasta and more tuna.

Family loved the taste and texture. Great alternative from the usual dinners. Kids loved the zucchini and tuna.

It was easy, quick, and pretty good.  I couldn’t taste the tuna which I was happy about.  I’ll make again.

Good foundation, TOO much pasta. Reduce the pasta and liven it up anyway you see fit and you'll end up with a decent dish. :)  Myself? I intend to try again with the tuna and  some sliced, stuffed sausage to really bring it to life! Maybe some ground sausage...we'll see.

Easy and very tasty.  I thought 6 large zucchini was a bit much so used  3 large and one small.    Will make again but will increase zucchini to 6.

I loved this. I added some more chilli flakes, herbs, olives and some red wine. Will definitely make this again. Just waiting to see if it freezes well because it makes a HUGE quantity!

Changes I made: no Italian spice (didn't have it), 2 large zuchinnis (worried 6 was too much), 1 can of tuna (only had 1 on hand)

I tried the recipe because I wanted to use canned tuna and almost every recipe was super cheesy. I like that this one wasn't. I thought it was really good. Gave it 5 stars because my husband thought it was awesome and even asked me to start making it regularly.

Thank you for this nutritious and affordable recipe!

This was good, but I needed to jazz it up a notch. I added wine, lots more tuna, tomato paste and more herbs. Next time I'll add onions before the garlic, and black olives at the end. Yummy!

This pasta is so simple and delicious! I use whole grain pasta and canned tuna, but everything else is the same. I am not a great cook, but I can easily make this (even with my two young children running around) and have a dinner that's healthy and a hit with my family. I make this at least once a month now because it's so easy and I usually have the ingredients on hand. Thanks for a great recipe Chef John!

This was not a hit in my household. It's something I would make again if I needed to use up some ingredient and had no better ideas, but I certainly won't put it in the regular rotation.
