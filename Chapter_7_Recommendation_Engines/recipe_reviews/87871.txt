Honestly, I MUST have done something wrong---the sausage mixture made the macaroni and cheese sort of greasy, so we had a creamy macaroni and cheese mixed with a greasy sausage mixture.  Maybe it is just because our tastebuds are not accustomed to the flavor.   I felt like I had (wrongly) combined leftovers from 2 different meals - fajita meat combined with macaroni and cheese.  I will keep checking the reviews on this because I am curious as to whether I did something wrong or if others agree with me.  Sorry, we just did not like it and our kids would not touch it.

To previous poster: instead of frying up the sausage meat on its own, try cutting the sausages into 1/4 in. slices and then frying them. Either way, if you lift them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and let them rest on some paper towel for a few minutes, you should get rid of a lot of the grease. I agree that the loose sausage meat might make the texture a bit strange. I've always used sausage slices and everyone seems to like it, kids and adults alike!

This one looked great! It wasn't. It was terribly greasy. I wonder if there might have been a step left out. I did slick cook and drain the sausages before adding them to the pasta. I'm afraid I  wouldn't try this one twice. :(

My family ate it right up! It was a delicious combination of flavors... my mom called it "coma food" because it was so comforting it put her to sleep :p It was a little greasy, but my family doesn't want any changes to the recipe!

Tried this out for the kids I had over and they scarfed it down like crazy. 
Mine wasn't greasy as I usually boil and then drain the grease from any meat I cook.
I think it would have tasted better with a little spice in it to liven the dish up.

We are not Mac and Cheese experts by any means.    Hubby liked this - I liked the Sausage, Peppers and Onions but that isn't the recipes fault. It was a good recipe to use what I had on hand.  It fed everyone and I am glad I made it.

I simply drained the sausage mixture and it was fine. Simple and good. Not meant to be extravagant, just easy and flavorful

Obviously, though not stated, you need to drain the sausage.  On a paper towel would be good.

YUM.  I was going to make mac and cheese with broccoli rabe and sausage but the supermarket was out of broccoli rabe, so I came upon this in a frantic search for a decent replacement to fulfill my mac and cheese craving... this definitely fit the bill!!  I will absolutely be making this one again.
