I made this on firday and served it as the alternative to cranberry sauce for thanksgiving dinner yesterday. It was fantastic, tasted great with poultry. About about to share the recipe on facebook now at the insistance of my guests . I folowed the recipe pretty closely except that I used 1/2 cup cider vinegar and 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and i used rasins instead of dried cherries.

This recipe was so good, since there werent ANY mangos at my local market I added extra dried cherries and some currants. SO GOOD. Thanks! Also....I made one batch with Cider Vinegar, one with White vinegar. Both were awesome.

I think this would be very good with turkey for the holidays , but not so good as an everyday more savory chutney.
