Perfect for a quick and easy dinner! My husband is addicted to bacon and thinks it should be a food group. I didn't mix the ingredients together in a bowl, I just spread light mayo on the warmed tortillas and layered everything then added a little shredded cheddar cheese. These went great with tomato soup!

I made this exactly as the submitter directed and we really LIKED everything all chopped up! It made this just a little different from the expected.  Besides, it was convenient to have it all ready to go so that the minute Hubs walked in the door I could get supper on the table. A BLT salad in a (low carb) tortilla and "Hearty Chicken Soup I," also from this site, made for a quick, no-fuss, nutritious mid-week supper.

Little too hot to cook last night, I whipped these up in a flash. I did use turkey bacon and a Roasted Onion mayonnaise (which is also from this site). Because I am eating low carb, I skipped the tortillas and ate mine as a quick side salad. Everyone thought this was great. With leftover potato soup from a couple nights before, this was a filling dinner.

I have been on Allrecipes for years, but this is my first time leaving a review. These BLT Burritos were so good that I just had to. I made these for dinner last night, but I scaled it down to make just one burrito since it was just me. It was so good, I had to make another. I used turkey bacon, fat free Miracle Whip, and whole wheat tortillas. I also omitted the pepper (I don't like it). These were absolutely wonderful. I woke up this morning and made another one for breakfast. Thanks Dorothy.

This was okay - nothing special but it all got eaten.  Just wasn't sure about the mayo  - I felt like it needed a bit more of a kick.  Something like Miracle Whip (If you can find it) or a creamy ranch dressing etc would give it the lift it needs.

Forget dirtying another bowl, I just built these into the wrap as I went. I am not a big mayo fan, but give me Ranch and I'm in heaven! I used some healthy (low carb, higher fiber) wrap, while my boyfriend stuck with the mayo and toasted white bread (...and just 4 measily, very thinly sliced tomato... Southern boy!!) :)  Both of us really enjoyed our light dinner tonight. Can't go wrong with a classic!

What's not to like when you combine a classic sandwich with a tortilla?  I followed the recipe exactly.  The mixture holds together very well for an easy to handle wrap.  I served this for a luncheon along with baked potato soup and it was an all around hit.

I make mine with MorningStar Farms bacon, sliced grape tomatoes, organic mixed baby greens, and light Miracle Whip.  I love them and have to have them at least twice a week.

We made this for lunch and DH just loved them. I used ranch in place of the mayo just for a change and added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese. Made for a nice tasty lunch!!

Fun, tasty twist on the regular BLT. Made these with the leftovers I had after making the BLT dip found on this website.

I only made one of these with 4 slices of leftover bacon. I didn't mix everything together instead I melted some shredded cheese on my whole wheat tortilla in the microwave, then I chopped half a roma tomato and put that on. Put my 4 slices of bacon on then some chopped lettuce and topped it with  BBQ sauce because that was what my boyfriend requested. He ate it without any complaints!!! Will make again thanks....

This was such a great recipe! Not as fast as a regular BLT if you think about it. There's more chopping and assembling, but it's worth it. The leftovers kept really well too.

What a fun recipe. Wish I could give it another half star since not quite a five star but I loved it. I'm a big BLT fan and love avocadoes so the simplicity of rolling them into a pita with ranch is brilliant in my opinion.
