Very good chocolate cake!  It's definitely much better than a cake mix!  I didn't have cake flour and found that I could use  1 3/4 c. of all purpose flour and 1/4 c. of cornstarch as a substitute for the 2 cups of cake flour.  I also couldn't find Dutch process cocoa powder at the store.  It can be substituted with unsweetened cocoa.  The substitution is as follows: for every 3 TBS. of unsweetened cocoa powder, add 1/8 tsp. of baking soda.

After making this cake a second time and following the directions to the letter(with the slight exception of adding a 1/4 cup more dutch processed cocoa to the batter)I still have to say this is THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD. I love it without the frosting, but with a layer of it, it's over the top chocolatey. WOW, am I glad I have this recipe. Some people have remarked about the 300 degree temperature. Trust me, if your oven is accurate it turns out perfect. ENJOY.
