This soup is absolutely delicious! I checked to see if Ms Tarasiewicz has any other recipes & she doesn't! I just know you are going to be the next Martha Stewart!

This was a really wonderful recipe.  I made it over the holidays for my husband and company and it was a big success. Also enjoyed using a couple of ingredients I hadn't tried before.  This may turn out to be my annual holiday soup.

So good I don't know if I can wait until tomorrow (Thanksgiving) to serve it. Sweet and nutty - unbelievable. Used Minerve brand chestnuts (Whole Foods) because they were highly rated in our newspaper food section. One thing I did differently was to add the wine to the vegetables, to finish them and to cook off some of the alcohol, before adding vegetable stock and the chestnuts. I think the garnishes (sour cream, cayenne, perhaps some parsley) can help the eye appeal, although I don't mind it.

It tasted okay, but the color and texture were unappealing.

I made this soup as a first course on Thanksgiving Day.  I wanted to impress my company...specifically, my sister, she's an excellent chef.  She gave me the biggest complement....she asked me for the recipe...Thanks, allrecipes.com
