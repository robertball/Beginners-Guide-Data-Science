Great recipe! I made it exactly as written and thought it was great. I may add shrimp or chicken for a protein boost next time.

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that you don't mention when to put the milk in.  I put it with the flour.
My husband loves it and wants to have it every weekend.

The recipe is good, but there is no indication of when to add the milk in. I added it with the flour. Also, I added vegi sausage and zucchini.
