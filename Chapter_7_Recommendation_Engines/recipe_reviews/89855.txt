My boyfriend LOVES when I make this, and it was a big hit at my work's holiday party. A few modifications I made: for the topping, I use 1/2 c  oatmeal AND 1/2 c chopped walnuts & pecans.. it makes it extra crunchy & extra nutty. Also, I use 3 c fresh pears & 3 c fresh apples. Where the recipe calls for boiling the pear syrup, I make my own syrup with 1 c water, 1/2 cup sugar, & 1/4 brown sugar. I use nutmeg in place of cloves, and added in  about 1 tbsp cinnamon. Served HOT with vanilla ice cream.. absolutely delicious :)

I've made this twice in the last five days.  The first time was for a funeral at church, so I tripled the recipe, and the second time was for dessert for our Bible Study group.  The first time I processed the ginger snaps finely and used almonds in the topping.  I didn't think the top was crispy enough, so today I left some chunks in the ginger snaps and I used oatmeal instead of the almonds.  I preferred that topping.  Since there is a good bit of juice that accumulates in the bottom of the bowl of chopped pears, I drain off as much as possible, but both times I put some extra corn starch in the sauce to make sure it thickens enough.  I found it baked up perfectly that way.  I also added a little more ground ginger to the sauce to give it a little more kick.  I thought this was delicious, as did everyone else who tried it.  This may be my new favorite fall recipe.

Not bad but a bit bland, even with the ginger and cloves. If I try this again I'd add cinnamon and kick up the ginger and cloves a touch. I had a LOT of juice in the pan after baking.

Delicious! The gingersnaps I used gave plenty of spicy flavor so I will use less clove and ground ginger next time. Nutmeg sounds like a good addition. I will use both nuts and oatmeal next time in the topping. Pears and gingersnaps... great combination. Baked up well, no extra juice for me.

The crumble topping was just amazing! Really crispy, rich & flavourful. I used flaked almonds in mine. However, just like others, I found the pears were bland. They just didn't stand up to the bold flavour of the topping. Would like to try this again using apple instead.

We love this recipe!  I'm making it again to bring to dinner with my grandparents-in-law.  We like lots of spices so I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.

It was kinda good, but really pretty bland. It would probably be good with apples, or fresh pears. One good thing about this recipe, though, is it was good left-over, and cold.

I've made apple crisp for years and when I saw this, I knew I would love it...and it was so good. It was a little runny, so I will likely reduce the amount of pear juice or let it thicken and reduce longer next time. I used 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup oats and the crispy topping was fantastic. Loved the gingersnaps! Topped with butter pecan ice cream, this is a dreamy dessert!

I added less water, but still water on the bottom after baking.  Not tons, but I wondered why?  Added cinnamon (as per others opinions) Kicked up the ginger & cloves.  It turned out amazing, must make again! The topping is delicious!

This recipe received rave reviews from family and requests for the recipe after taking it to a picnic. It is delicious warm with ice cream or the next day icy cold for the fridge. We like ginger so I substituted 3 tablespoons of finely minced candied ginger for the ground ginger. Otherwise, I would increase the ground ginger to 1/2 tsp for our tastes.

We found some canned pears without added sugar. This recipe is a winner because it is fast and an affordable off-season treat. We made ours with walnuts and oatmeal, as well as generic gingersnaps. I'm planning on getting Trader Joe's gingersnaps for a third batch. We love this recipe!  --We doubled the spices! Don't miss that step.

I really enjoyed this but like others it's a little bland.  The spices need to be upped and then it would be a 5 star.  I can't wait to try this with fresh pears, I think the flavor would be outstanding.

Great! I did have to sub nutmeg for ginger because I don't keep ginger handy. Also my pears were sliced canned pears and I only needed 3 cups.
