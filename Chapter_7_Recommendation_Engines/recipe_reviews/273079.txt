Very good smoothie! I used Silk Coconut milk, 6 frozen strawberries in place of the ice cubes and Truvia instead of Splenda. Thank you for sharing your recipe. I will be making this again.

I used plain Greek yogurt, little extra ice & frozen strawberries. Found taste to be good, and even my granddaughter enjoyed it. Plus itâ€™s easy to make,
