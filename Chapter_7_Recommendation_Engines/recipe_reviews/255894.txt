11.7.16 Didn t have any Italian seasoning on hand so I used Italian-style panko bread crumbs This is plenty easy for a weeknight dinner but good enough for company too. Simple enough to make and it baked up crispy tender and juicy. Keeper recipe!

We loved this! It was so easy and the directions were perfect as far as cooking time. The 25 minutes was exactly precise. I liked that the recipe did not have to even be flipped adding to the ease while busy. I made a few changes based on what I could find at the store. I could not find the specific seasoning. So I used an equal amount of Italian seasoning and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a very small pinch of salt. The store I went to did not have any small packs of chicken breasts left. I went with thin cut turkey cutlets. It was about a 1 lb package and it worked perfect. They almost sort of tasted like a pork chop. I would recommend trying this poultry also. I was able to to bread six pieces and line them up with space on a baking sheet. I lined my sheet with foil and sprayed with cooking spray and there was no real issues with sticking. I will definitely make this again. It was flavorful the meat was tender and the coating was nice and crunchy. Ty

Thanks Baking Nana for our dinner tonight. The ingredients are spot on with one exception---it needed salt and pepper. Next time I will use some of my favorite Papa's Seasoning from this site before dipping into the butter. Other than that this recipe was declared by the two of us as a total winner! My husband "stole" some of my chicken and that tells me that he meant it when he said it was a 5! EDIT 11/13/16 I was one of those who bought the huge bag from Costco of the crispy onion rings. So I added some of those to this recipe tonight and think it was a very tasty addition. If you have any left from that (awful but traditional) green bean casserole just use it here!:)

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used an Italian seasoning with red pepper flakes which went so well with the cheese! The method and timing is perfect. The chicken was so tender and juicy my family could hardly believe I'd made it! Awesome recipe! I used rice crackers instead of panko to keep it gluten free. The coating was crispy and crunchy. Yum.

I used freshly grated parmesan as I can't get Borden products here. Very quick to put together and very moist and tender. They were a bit anemic mine were a bit on the larger size so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes. Thanks for sharing.

This is one terrific recipe! I made this for my family with the granddaughters and it was completely finished and had lots of compliments. Would definitely make this again as I also found this recipe made the chicken very moist and tasty.

Made No changes. Taste was good but way too oily. Might try an egg wash instead of butter next time.

Perfect easy weeknight dish! I had the butcher at Publix cut boneless skinless breast in half across the breast to make them like cutlets and followed the recipe as written. I did add a bit of extra shredded Parmesan cheese at the end and stuck the pan under the broiler for a couple of minutes to get a nice cheese-crunchy topping! Very selfish!!

This is a great weeknight recipe. Served with a salad or spaghetti squash and marinara it pays to keep the ingredients on hand.

The cook time was perfect. I added Rosemary and garlic to the recipe for some extra flavor. I really enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe. I would definitely make this again!

Gave it a five because it is incredibly easy and yet company worthy. The chicken is so moist! I meant to take another reviewer's suggestion to use salt & pepper also and forgot. It lacked a little something so I will definitely give that a try next time; because I will be making this again.

Winner winner chicken dinner! No changes made and I loved this recipe didn t rely on salt & pepper for seasoning. This is perfect enough for every day dinner or with minor tweaking can be converted to a stuffed chicken breast (saut√©ed onions cheese etc. )

This chicken was pretty good. I served over a salad for a light meal. I did sprinkle the chicken with some salt and pepper before the breading. But it was soggy on the bottom. If I make this recipe again I will bake on a cooling rack to allow the bottom side of the chicken to crisp up too.
