Absolutely fabulous!! I have been making sorullitos for years and experimented with the proportions with varying results, so I wanted to try this recipe. I am very happy to report that the particular ratio of ingredients here is SPOT ON. If you are looking for a sorullito that is crunchy outside and tender soft on the inside, with a taste on the sweeter side,  THIS IS IT!!! (but of course you can reduce the sugar and increase the salt a bit if you want it to have more of a savory taste).  I did put a stick of extra sharp cheddar cheese inside of each piece for an extra YUMMMM Thanks for the recipe Marisa!!!

Fantastic!!! So easy to make, So Super Yummy to eat. OFF the chain on star ratings. I was looking for something to go with the fried fish dinner that I was making for my family other than corn bread, came on site and under corn fritters I found this wonderful recipe. IT was PERFECT. My entire family raved about it. I was not too sure about the mayo/ketchup sauce but it compliments the sticks beyond belief, I made exactly as directed and would not change a thing I would not even add the cheese as it said could be done, THESE ARE PERFECT THE WAY THEY ARE> Thank you for sharing a divine side item.

My sister makes these all the time, but it's the only time we get to eat them! My daughter begged me to make some so I took a chance with this recipe and not only was it simple they are perfect crunchy outside and moist inside. I also added 1tsp vanilla extract and 1tbls extra sugar, I also added a small piece of cheddar cheese to the center of some and they were great!  Thanks for sharing recipe.

I think that this recipe was delicious! It's 4/5 stars simply because I'm from a Puerto Rican household and I've had my fair share of sorullos so well, my standards are high. But this is a really nice recipe! Really crispy when fried, but soft inside. Oh and in terms of the mayo ketchup, I just make it to taste. Start with a dollop or two of mayo and a squirt of ketchup. Adjust to your taste. It's very forgiving. Yummy! Buen provecho!

Best recipe for sorullos I have ever done. I just add 1 more tbsp of sugar because I like them sweeter and i add "bacalao guisado con tomate" inside of some of them. Delicious!

I made no changes to this recipe, as my husband who is Puerto Rican looked it over, we made it, and ate every single one of these delicious sticks of heaven...with ketchup/mayo sauce, of course! I think these would work well as a freezer appetizer as well, we just never have enough to try it out!

We used vegan mayo instead of the regular stuff. Other than that we didn't change a thing and it was great.

Pretty close to how my dad makes them. I was craving sorullitos  & I'm not in Puerto Rico so I had to prepare them myself.

We had never heard of these until I spotted this recipe, so I have no idea if mine came out like the authentic ones or not. But that doesn’t really matter because, authentic or not, we enjoyed them. Mine came out closer to 1” diameter and 4 Inches long, and at that size I got 17 of them out of this recipe. They tasted great dipped in the dipping sauce, which did not sound nearly as good as it was. Glad I made it! We also tried them rolled in cinnamon sugar, and they were a lot like a cinnamon donut. Yummy!

My father used to make these when I was little. He kind of lost his touch making them and he stopped. So I decided to surprise the family and this recipe was perfect! Now I wonder how they would taste if I baked them because we can't have too many fried foods. But as a little appetizer or snack this was great. Brought back good memories of my childhood.

Finally a good recipe! Now I can make them at home whenever I get a craving since there isn't anywhere to get real sorullitos in my area. I added an extra tablespoon of butter this time and it made the dough a little more manageable. The more it cools though the harder it is to keep its shape so work quickly as soon as it's cool enough to handle. Filled with cheese and served with my own mayo-ketchup which me make with a lot more than just a hint of garlic powder ??

These were pretty good.  U took them to a party and got mixed reviews.  I added mozzarella but not enough, and I felt a little more sugar would have been good.  Some of the guests loved them.

We made this two ways. We made the "dough" and added mixed cheeses and rolled them up like  popcorn chicken. Also made them plain and at the end rolled them in cinnamon and sugar. Kids loved them!

I just did this recipe, I personalized it adding cheddar cheese to it. I cut a small piece of cheese and place it on the inside of the sorullito...mmm, once it's done and you take a bite of it...you're in paradise

Easy and good. Don't overcook.
