Not impressed.  A lot of work with little flavor.  Just as good steamed.

This recipe is a good starting point/base. However, you definitely need to add some other complimenting flavors/spices to get it where it needs to be in terms of flavor. (I have added the following: lime juice,Tabasco & garlic powder)

Added garlic salt to taste. I agree with the previous post, nothing to write home about.
