Peanut butter fudge has always been a tradition in our family, but when my great-grandmother died, the recipe was lost. Of all the recipes I have tried, this tastes the closest to what she made. I did however make changes. I do not add the peanut butter to the boiling mixture, I boil the sugar/milk on medium/high until it reaches soft ball stage (around 234 degrees); use a candy thermometer. I would not recommend just guessing with the soft ball stage unless you are truly a professional- fudge is extremely fickle and can turn out or not for even the most seasoned baker. As soon as that stage is reached, immediately take it off the stove and add the peanut butter/vanilla. I mixed with a regular mixer on low for around 6 minutes and it turned out perfect. Great recipe, the best I have found so far.

I've never had peanut butter fudge so this was a nice surprise.  After seeing that some reviewers ended up with hard, gritty fudge, I was worried about over cooking this, so I cooked it to 240 degrees on my candy thermometer and it was too soft.  Perhaps a specific temperature would help people obtain the right fudge consistency.  I don't know what it is, but it's more than 240 :)  Anyhow, I ended up with a substance that tasted like and was the same consistency as peanut butter cookie dough. This recipe yields alot, it made a 7x11" pan and probably could be stretched to a 9x13" too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just tried making it and I don't know what happened.  I ended up with a dried crumbled mess, so I thought I'd add a little milk to make it creamy again and it looked like taco meat.  I am the one girl who cannot make peanut butter fudge to save my life!

This fudge is absolutely phenomenal.  I was skeptical that the syrup mixture wouldn't cream up, but I put it in my Kitchen Aid along with the peanut butter and butter (the only substitute I used) and vanilla - it was great, I didn't time how long I had it beating but it was at least 6 minutes and then I poured it into a 9x13 pan.  I can't stop eating it, in fact I need to make more because it's part of the goodie trays for the holidays.

This fudge is awesome.  It's one of the best peanut butter fudge recipes I've made.  If you're high altitude, be sure to get the mixture to "soft ball" stage - it might take a little longer.  I had to mix 'vigorously' for quite a while, but the end result was scrumptous!

Thanks for the great "TRADITIONAL" recipe.  I really hate it when people add marshmellow cream and then call it fudge.  Our great grandmothers would roll over in their graves...... This recipe rates a 12 on the 1 to 10 scale.

I can't belive it!  I cannot make fudge it is the one thing that I can't make.  This recipie rocks, it was setting, which in my experience never happens for me.  I shut the burner off after it reached 234 degrees, then added the Peanut butter, butter and vanilla, I mixed gently which brought the temp down around 180, I poured into my kitchen aid which I had read to do in other reviews, and started to mix, only mine was setting before I even started the mixer, so I only mixed for about 10 minutes on number 2 speed, and then patted it into my pre-prepped pan.  The flavor is awsome, and is one of the best fudges I have ever tasted.  I am totally not sure how people are getting PB carmels out of this, becuase I got fudge, and I suck at fudge.  The only changes I made was that I used 2 TB of butter, and I used half and half instead of milk cause that was what I had and I needed to use it up.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  This is going to be a family christmas tradition from now on!

This is a great recipe for fudge beginners. I did use whipping cream instead of milk only because I wanted to use it up what I had on hand. Not a big deal. Anyone making fudge, really let the mix boil and stir. You'll see the mix thicken and go from grainy to smooth as water evaporates and the sugar dissolves. Just be patient. Before I start making fudge I spray my wooden spoons with cooking spray as well as wipe the pot with cooking spray to keep any undissolved sugar from sticking around (which leads to fudge not setting). I also pour heated ingredients into another pot over butter and vanilla. And stir low heat like a mad woman. Those are my lucky rituals.

Hey!  This is my recipe exactly - do we have the same Grandpa? :)  One thing I do which seems to bring it to the soft ball stage quicker is add a little bit of almost any type of syrup - corn syrup, maple syrup, honey, anything along that line - about 1 Tbsp.  Don't ask me why that helps, but it seems to.  I love the suggestions to use a beater - I'm going to try that next time.  I've also never tried adding the peanut butter right at the beginning - I think I'll give that a try also.

I would have to give this a one.  At least for me, this did not turn out at all.  After reading the reviews, I used a candy thermometer and tried to use my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I started the mixer and went to the sink with the pan to put it in hot water, when I turned back to check on the candy, it was powdery.  I was very careful measuring the ingredients, even used my digital scale to make sure the sugar amounts were correct.  The only thing is, I do live at about 7300 foot level in the mountains of Southern California.

Too sweet, WAY WAY too sweet. Even for fudge, which is sweet, this is over the top. Too bad there's no less than 1 star rating.

This is not really fudge at all. More of like a chewy toffee. Not exactly the creaminess I was looking for.

I am a first time fudge maker, this recipe was quick and easy. I did add an extra 1/2 cp of peanut butter and waited to add the peanut butter until after I brought the sugar & milk to 240. My husband went crazy over the fuge. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I did not like this recipe at all. While it was cooling, it tasted great, but once cooled it was pure sugar! Too sweet. No one at my work or in my house wanted it. I would not recommened this recipe.

Easy as pie! First time I've ever attempted making my own fudge and I have to say I'm quite pleased! I've just poured it into their respective tubs to cool down, and when it's done I'll take another pic. I decided to make sweets as gifts for my Dad and Husband this year rather than buying any, as I wanted to show them how good they've made my year and how glad I am that they are my family, and this recipe turned out absolutely perfect for the sentiment. Thank you so much for sharing, this is fabulous. And if I can do it, it can be done!

This was my first time making fudge of any kind. I followed the directions exactly and used a candy thermometer, as suggested by reviewers. I cannot believe how easy this was and how good my results are. I will make again but next time use my mixer for the final stage. I probably had to stir the fudge for 10 minutes. Thank you for this recipe.

Ive never had peanut butter fudge before, but my boyfriend loves it so i thought id try to make it. I followed the recipe exactly, tested the sugar milk mixture for the softball stage in a glass of cold cold water, and mixed peanut butter in after i took it off the heat.
it turned out great! 
not grainy at all, super smooth. Might be my favorite fudge!

I'm not a big fan of fudge myself, so I made this for my girlfriend.  She said it was delicious, but next time I will make it in a more shallow pan - it was waaayyy too rich to be so thick.

This fudge is so easy to make and it tastes great. I cooked the sugar milk to a boil and used my hand  mixer after adding the peanut butter. I topped the fudge with 2 handfuls of chocolate chips and pressed them in.

This was my first attempt ever in making fudge, so I was concerned how it would turn out. No worries with this recipe though! I followed the directions exactly (with the exception of using almond milk instead of regular milk), and it turned out beautifully. I made this for an annual Halloween party, and everyone devoured it! This will be my go-to recipe for fudge forever. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Followed the recipe and it turned out the best I've ever made! You can actually taste the peanut butter!  Hope I don't eat all 36 servings.

For extra crunch use crunchy peanut butter delicious! I have made peanut butter fudge alot but this recipe is by far the best and the ingredients were easy to find just around the house.

I was seriously debating whether or not to try this recipe. I love peanut butter, but, for some reason, I was afraid this wouldn't showcase the PB to it's fullest potential. I was wrong. This fudge is AMAZING. Tasted like peanut butter cookie dough and WHO DOESN'T LOVE THAT??? I followed another reviewers suggestion and added the peanut butter, butter, and vanilla after taking the sugar/milk mixture off the heat. This was after I reached a temperature of 234 degrees. (Please use a thermometer.) I was fearful that it might not set up right, as some others had experienced, but it came out wonderfully! The only thing I would like to do differently in the future is use baker's sugar (I don't remember the correct name for it) so that the texture is as creamy as possible. But, with all that scrumptious brown sugar, it might not make a difference. This recipe is a keeper! Seriously addicting.

I have always been scared to try a fudge recipe that doesn't have marshmallow creme since its so easy to make that way.  This recipe is fantastic. I have been looking for a good recipe to make for a friend of mine who loved her mother's PB fudge, buther mother passed away before writing it down for her.  I followed another users advice to use my kitchenaid mixer since I thought I couldn't ever mix it for as long as it needed to be mixed.

My first time making fudge, and it tasted just like my grandmas fudge when i was growing up. it was thick, and so rich i was having a memory rendezvous with each bite. It is very important to mix it as long as it says or it will not set.

thanks to another review I used my kitchen aid to do the mixing (15 mins on 2 was perfect), and this was wonderful!!! I too hardly ever have marshmallow fluff on hand, so this was a great recipe to find. I will cut back on the white sugar by about 1/2 cup next time though... it is so sweet we can only have a "tiny" piece and with milk or coffie at one time.. will make again.

Great creamy peanut butter flavor and really easy to make. If you've never made fudge before and want to give it a try this is the perfect recipe. It can also be made using chunky peanut butter if you want to add some crunch.

I followed the recipe and ended up with caramels that tasted like peanut butter.  Ended up pouring melted chocolate over the top and calling it peanut butter candy.

This is still setting (I can tell it's going to without a problem most likely) but I tasted the fudge in its non set state and it was really good! Very easy to make for me as a first time homemade fudge maker (on my own)

Good recipe. I made the mistake of ignoring the STIR-IN-ONE-DIRECTION rule. The parts that actually solidified were delicious. The corners would have made a really good ice cream topping. Follow the directions exactly and you will be fine.

Delicious!  The only changes I made were to add 2 T light corn syrup and then cook to 234 degrees.  I took it off the stove, dropped in the butter and let it cool to lukewarm, then beat it until the gloss was gone.  It was creamy and perfect!

WOW! I made this fudge today and it's more than half gone already. I was kind of concerned since I woke up to rain. And we all know what we've heard about making fudge in the rain.
It does not ring true for this recipe. This is so way cool. Now, I have a new treasured recipe for peanut butter fudge, come rain or shine. Thank you so much for sharing your Grandpa's recipe with all of us.

Awesome!  As another review said, I used my Kitchenaid Mixer for 15 minutes and it came out great!  I can't imagine having to do it by hand, because it got awfully thick around the 5 minute mark...

I just made this fudge and it is great! I followed other reviews and added the butter,vanilla, and peanut butter after I brought the milk and sugar to soft ball stage and removed from heat. I used my hand mixer on 1 for 5 minutes and 2 for 1 minute. The fudge isn't grainy at all and set beautifully. I did reduce the sugar by 1 cup total (1/2 white and 1/2 brown). Will definately make again and not use marshmallow cream recipe.

This is excellent and easy to make. I was wanting to make fudge, but out of marshmallow creme, this is the first time I've been successful making fuge without marshmallow creme. Will keep this recipe. Am considering adding cocoa powder next time.

My Husband is a "HUGE" fan of just about anything with peanut butter. I have been trying to make my grandmothers recipe and it never turns out to be fudge. More like a sauce. The recipe worked. I hope he enjoys it as much as my son did when he scraped the pan sides and the stirring spoon!! 

                       Thanks, 
                         Melinda
                                  P.S. 
                                 I used home made brown sugar 
                                 and crunchy PB.

I had to make 3 batches of this before I could get it to set. It simply would not get hard! Then when it did set, it was too firm. I finally realized I wasn't cooking it long enough, but for all the waste and constant stirring over a hot stove, the taste was realy no better than the easy marshmallow creme kind in my opinion.

Tasty recipe but I made a few cha
Use evaporated milk in place of regular milk.  Evap. milk has less water and fudge cooks faster.  When fudge is at softball stage take off stove. At this point I let the fudge cool some then start beating (reduces beating time.).  DO NOT let the fudge harden in the pan.  It is a nightware.  Beat fudge until the glossy top changes  to dull.  You will ge able to tell when it changes.  THEN pour into prepared buttered pan to harden.  Delicious recipe with minor changes

The best peanut butter fudge recipe I ever made. Perfect. Great tasting. I did put the peanut butter in with the butter and vanilla. Mainly because that is the way I have always done it and was afraid to cook the peanut butter in it.

Tastes great but I too followed the recipe exact and it is more like a caramel. From now reading all the reviews I think the problem with it not setting is we are following the recipe and adding the peanut butter when it comes to a boil. Most of the 5 star ratings say they added it after the softball stage. I also used my kitchen aid mixer so this is the only difference I see.

This fudge was good but it was gritty and the mixture was REALLY runny so I added more peanut butter,I think that the sugar to milk and peanut butter ratio left a bit to be desired.

I have made this exact recipe for the last two Christmas' and without a doubt this is the best I have ever tried.  I use a candy thermometer, so no guesswork as to the soft ball stage and an electric mixer, which saves the hand beating.  Everyone that tries it has to have the recipe.  Thanks Grandpa for this special treat!

I made this recipe last night and it was absolutely the best peanut butter fudge ever!  I looked for a recipe that did not use marshmallow fluff because I don't like that kind.  This one had really good reviews so I tried it.  I will use this recipe from now on!!  I didn't follow the instructions exactly after learning a lot about fudge-making recently.  I used a candy thermometer and boiled to 225 (mine is not accurate--about 7-10 degrees off).  Then I cooled it before stirring the butter and vanilla in.  Stirring in the same direction is something I had not heard before.  I will try that when making chocolate fudge as well.

I made this today instead of my regular recipe except I used crunchy P.B.instead of smooth. I'm an old time believer that cooked candies are much better than "easy recipe"candies and this is a good example. It came out great. Not too sweet or heavy.Will definetly use it from now on.

This recipe was great, althought I took another reviewers advice and used a candy thermometer to get the mixture to softball stage, which took about 5-10 minutes. I then put the peanut butter mixture into my stand mixer and mixed for 10-12 minutes. My co-workers loved it and it was gone in no time.

4 stars only because some people prefer a creamier textured fudge, but not me! This fudge is great. It had a slightly grainy texture similar to See's butterscotch squares only peanut butter flavored. I'm dipping small squares in chocolate as an extra special treat for my mom. Be sure to keep wrapped tight as it dries out. Grandpa had good taste :)
Thanks for the recipe!

I JUST MADE THIS FUDGE ON A RAINY DREARY SATURDAY. IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I USED MY MIXER TO MIX IT AND IT IS WONDERFUL. I HAVE A GOOD RECIPE FOR PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE BUT I ONLY MAKES A SMALL AMOUNT, THIS MAKES ENOUGH TO GIVE AS GIFTS WHICH IS WHAT I ALWAYS DO WITH MY CHRISTMAS CANDY. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE AND USED A CANDY THERMOMETER. WILL ADD TO MY CHRISTMAS MUST HAVES.

This is just like the PB fudge I had when I was a little girl.  The recipes differ a little (like others wrote about adding the peanut butter in the end)... but I think the end result will be the same!  I tried it GRANPAS way this time!  This fudge is WAY, WAY better than the fudge that is made with marshmallow cream!

I followed this recipe almost to a T WITHOUT a candy thermometer and barely any brown sugar, and i used homemade peanut butter.

About the the balls in cold water, i think they're more like balls with tails, i just used a spoon to drop some into cold water and when it formed little balls with tails taht quickly sank to the bottom i thought it was time.

I used 3 3/4 cups of white sugar and 1/4 of brown (lol, thats all i had left) and i added some molasses when i put everything in the pot.
Other then than i followed everything, stirring the right way etc. And it turned out great. First time making fudge and i'm pretty satisfied. Not to mention this recipe is one of out of the 3 that DONT use offbeat ingredients that no one usually has.

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!  This tastes exactly like the fudge I remember from childhood.  It's also very easy to make, as I've never before made fudge.  Thanks to all the reviewers who gave me some great tips to make this turn out so well!  I would say definately use a candy thermometer.  You can't go wrong that way.

This is the first time I've ever made fudge so I was very nervous but it turned out well. I used the Kitchenaid mixer as one user suggested and was able to do my clean up while the fudge essentially made itself (this was after the cooking stage which does require close attention). I used butter instead of margarine and used crunchy peanut butter which I wouldn't recommend, not because of the texture, I don't mind nuts in my fudge, but because peanuts have a very distinct flavor and they overwhelm the fudge more than walnuts or pecans would. Next time I'll try creamy as the recipe suggests.

I tried t his recipe...The very very first time I've ever made fudge in my life! I was looking for something simple, that didn't require ingredients I don't always carry. I wasn't expecting such a dark colored p/b fudge. However...it tastes justs as good if not better than any other fudge out there. THIS is a great recipe!! Especially for first time candy makers. In my honest opinion! Thanks!

This was such an easy recipe recipe and turned out so great! I did read a lot of the reviews and used some of the recommendations to tweak it a bit. I realized a bit too late that I didnt have enough peanut butter, so I used only 1 cup. Then I added a 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder since the person I made them for likes chocolate best. I used a candy thermometer which helped so much! I also waited and added the peanut butter, vanilla, and milk as soon as I took the other ingredients off the stove. I then just used my hand mixer for about 5 minutes until it thickened to the consistency of melted fudge. Then I poured the mixture in a glass sheet pan lined with wax paper and put it in the fridge to set! was so quick and easy. I will definitely be making this again!

My father in law loves peanut butter fudge and buys it everywhere, but it's never peanut buttery enough for him.  He's told us about the wonderful fudge his grandmother used to make so I decided I'd try this one.  HE LOVES IT! I have made it several times and I typically add extra peanut butter for him.

Just finished pouring onto plate. Looks nice. My concern is that I wasn’t sure how hard it was suppose to get Before I poured onto plate.  I couldn’t stir any longer because it was so thick so I poured. I’ve never made fudge before so we will see.  Batter tasted yummy for sure though.

I am not a fudge maker but this was very easy and turned out great.  The only change to ingredients I made was to use evaporated milk.  I don’t own a candy thermometer so I attempted the softball test.  Putting the peanut butter, butter and vanilla in the mixing bowl ahead

I followed the reviews. Used my candy thermometer got to soft ball and dumped the sugar mixture into my kitchen aide with the peanut butter, butterz and vanilla. I started washing up the dishes. After about 20 minutes I check the fudge and its dust! Its not smooth or creamy in the slightests. Not to sure what to do with this. Im sure I can find a creative way to use it though.

I changed nothing. It stayed creamy long enough to use as icing on a sheet cake with enough remaining for some fudge snacks on the side.   It is a good and easy recipe. Made it without a candy thermometer, mit’s more fun!  Pan licking good!

I made this fudge recipe tonight and it turned out perfect.  I have attempted making fudge a  few times in my 54 years, but it would never set for me.  Not sure what I was doing wrong, but tonight it set perfectly.  I did add walnuts and it is delicious!  I even got to cut it with a knife this time!!  GREAT RECIPE FOR FUDGE!! 
 Cool cool double cool  :o)   Thanks Pam for sharing your moms recipe with us!!!

I made this exactly like the recipe. After reading some of the comments, I would like to add a few tips. First I’m a great grandmother and have been cooking for many years.  My Peanut Butter candy came out perfect although I was Leary about only 1 cup of milk to 4 cups of sugar. Most cooked fudge is 1 c of sugar to 1 cup of milk.. after it’s cooked, you have to beat the hell outofit. I use a wooden paddle.  Beat it until it starts to really thicken. If it gets too hard before you pour it out, DONOT add any liquid to it. Either put it back on the stove or over a pan of hot water to warm it a bit. Good luck and good cooking.

My 6 yr old grandson and I decided to give this recipe a go. I’ve never made fudge before and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this recipe was. Not to mention very delicious! I stirred the mixture by hand after it was brought up to temperature (candy thermometer is a must). Next time I’ll pour the mixture into a bowl and use a hand mixer. The texture was perfect! After chilling it overnight in the fridge, even better !!! I am planning to make this fudge a part of my homemade holiday gifts! Thanks for a great recipe!!

something went horribly wrong! all the reviews made is sound fool proof...it is not! it all went downhill when I put it into the kitchen aid and it hardened almost immediately when I added the peanut butter and butter...didnt even make it to the vanilla before it was crumbling. maybr it will be great over ice cream? It's not grainy though, just crumbly. and almost fits into 10x15 cookie sheet

This is almost the exact recipe that my grandma used to make for our family. She now has Alzheimer's and has forgotten the recipe. We all thought it was lost for good. I'm making this for christ ma's presents for my family this year. Thank you for sharing.

I  changed up two things after cooking:  I used a 7x11 pan for this (recipe says pour it on a plate?) and also, after cooking I set the pan in some cold water to speed up the process of cooling while stirring. It came out perfect!

Thank you for this recipe. I used to watch my mother make peanut butter fudge and beat it by hand until her bicep bulged. ( An impressive woman). I have made this many times the way it is written. I always like using the soft ball method without a problem. It's like writing in cursive. Try it to see if you remember how. For the reviewers who had bad results; an old friend used to say "The arrows don't miss the target, It's the Indian" Try it again. You will end up with great fudge and a feeling of accomplishment. Isn't that what cooking is about. :)

It tastes just like my Grandma's! I had to go old school and use the soft ball method. (I'm too cheap to buy a thermometer here) I enjoy the experience of a classic method and a classic taste. This recipe nailed both. Thank you!

I have made this 3 times now and the first two, it didn't set. This time, instead of whipping it by hand, I put it in my stand mixer and turned it on slowly progressing to high speed for 7 minutes. It finally set! 

I gave this a 3, because without my strand mixer, I wouldn't have ever been able to get it to set up. However, based on taste it is my favorite, which is why I always come back to it!!

I was trying to find a recipe close to my grandpa's classic peanut butter fudge (I only have his chocolate written down) and this was quite close. My only issue with the instructions is cooking the peanut butter during the initial candy making process, as he always told me to cook the milk and sugar to soft ball, remove from heat, then add your fats and vanilla while stirring until your arm feels like it's going to fall off.  Using his technique I came to the desired consistency of fudge I was looking for and am pleased with the results. I had to take a star off for the directions because I believe adding the peanut butter too soon is why others are experiencing issues with the final product.

I have not made fudge for years, but I wanted peanut butter fudge.  It's really hard to find a recipe that doesn't use marshmallow cream  it turned out great. The only change I made was butter instead of marg.

Sadly I didn't have access to a candy thermometer and I'm pretty sure i didn't get things hot enough so it didn't set up quite right.

Still turned out delicious though and I'll definitely make again.

This rating is not so much for the dish but for the instructions.  I made it and it never came out of liquid form.  After reading reviews I discovered it needed to boil for a while at 235 degrees with a candy thermometer and then it had to be beaten with an electric mixer for 10-14 minutes.  I put the whole mess back in the pot and started over boiling with all ingredients.  I have fudge, not sure what it tastes like, I'm sick of dealing with it all day and really don't care to try it.

I read some of the reviews. I always add the vanilla and butter be for I do a "soft ball test", and when it was finally ready (for those who find it easier w/a candy thermometer: 230-250 degrees ferenheight) id quickly add the peanut butter, stir it vigurously, and quickly transfeer it to a pan lines with wax or parchment paper. Ive never had a setting issues that way. I love the ingredient ammounts, Plus im thankfull it dosent include fluff-so messy! Great recipe. Thank you.

Excellent. First time making fudge. Improvised a bit last minute, cut back on the white sugar, only used about 1 & 1/2 cups, but still used the full 2 cups of brown. I used a whole jar (16.3 oz) of Skippy Creamy PB.  I also added some flour to the mix (after melting sugar in pot) and in my case used white rice flour because my sister cannot eat wheat. I'm guessing I used around 1/4 cup of the flour, I just went with it... I didn't check the temp, just used my best judgement--I got it up to a boil and kept stirring. The mixture after a few minutes of a pretty good bubble started changing and I knew "it was getting there." I'd say I let it boil like that for at least 5 minutes... It started to burn on the bottom of pan so I took it off the stove... I used a whisk to stir and I beat the hell out of it for like 5 minutes. I felt like I was making caramel, and the bubbling brew reminded me of something you'd see at the Willy Wonka factory. Set it, forget it, and in 1 & 1/2 hours you're good to go. I was nervous it wouldn't come out good and that I would have wasted all that sugar and peanut butter, but fortunately it was freakin delicious I had some for breakfast. ;) Next time I'm going to cut down sugar even more.. I love fudge, but it's too sweet, all of it not just this recipe, but if you like it like that then use the full amount of sugar I guess.

READ Reviews before making. This is great.  I only gave it 4 stars though, because if you don't follow previous advise (boil to 234 to 240 degrees) this comes out very grainy.  Also the use of a mixer for the last 3 ingredients (peanut butter, butter & vanilla) is a time saver on your arms. I made my first batch as written, and threw it out. Made the 2nd batch from reviews, and it is GREAT :) If you don't have a thermometer (mine is digital) bring to a GOOD boil, then keep boiling for a bit longer.

This was my first attempt at making fudge. I followed another reviewers' tactic of putting it in the kitchen aide mixer for 15 minutes, and not adding the peanut butter until that stage. I also added a small amount of cocoa, because I can't resist chocolate and peanut butter together. Next time, I will make strait peanut butter fudge, using this recipe. I also used powedered sugar (confectioner's sugar) since I had read in other recipes that you should use powdered sugar instead of granulated. I make treats for my husband and his coworkers 3-4 days a week, and I get tired of making the same cookies over and over, so I thought I would try something else for a change. This recipe was so easy, it definitely overcame my fears of making fudge. The finished product was wonderful! Thanks!

This tastes okay but was grainy.  I did cook it to the correct stage with my cooking/candy thermometer but it still came out grainy.

First I have to note that I knocked the recipe down to 1/3 of the original. Even though I messed up while stirring the ingredients (it was boiling over before I could add the PB, and I did NOT get the drop-in-cold-water thing) it turned out ok in the end!  I've never had PB fudge before and it was quite tasty!

I formed it into little balls using measuring spoons.  It is only crumbly if you try to shape or cut it when it's hardening (I guess it was a little crumbly while eating it too, but not as noticeably).  I would recommend cutting or shaping it into bite-size pieces not right out of the boiling pot, but while it's still pretty warm and flexible.

I made this with my 10-year-old sister one day as an activity. So easy to do with kids, and delicious to boot. We followed someone's tip and sprinkled in a bit of cocoa. Will make again.

This was great!  I was so excited when I got to taste the final product!  It is exactly what I had been looking  for..I took the previous reviewer's advice, and mixed the peanut butter in after the boiling was done...came out perfect!!

A complete waste of ingredients. Tried it once following instructions exactly and it would not set up. Tried it again with suggestions by other members and still didn't work.

Very good; but I wanted it with a more peanut butter taste and less grainy.  My husband thought it was just what we were looking for.  A little adjusting and it will be perfect.  NOTE: this was not overly grainy, I just wanted it a little smoother than it was.

I hate giving this recipe two stars, but my fudge was hard and grainy.  It still tasted good, but the texture wasn't that great...and I had a HARD time cutting it in the dish.  I don't really know what happened, I followed the directions exactly.  But this was my first time making fudge, so I'm sure that it was my error, but I don't know what I did wrong.

I made this recipe for co-workers about a year ago, and it was a hit.  Very delicious, and so easy to make!  I even caught some co-workers going back for thirds, so what does that say about the recipe!

I got the oddest result from this fudge.  I poured it out into a large round pan, and the center of the fudge set up nicely, but the outside stayed really soft.  Also, it had more of a caramel flavor than a peanut butter flavor.  I won't be making this again.
