Keeper alert!  This is going on rotation!  I did not have sloppy joe seasoning so I used 1/2 teaspoon each:  cornstarch, onion powder and dry mustard.  And used green can parm instead of good shredded.  Thanks!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. One of the best stuffed pepper recipes I've had in a long time.

Thank you this was a nice change to regular stuffed peppers.  I like how the meat is crumbled so it's not like a solid meatball and you don't have to wonder if they are cooked all the way through.
