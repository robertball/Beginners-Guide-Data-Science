This is so easy and flavorful!  I added more types of vegetables such as asparagus, carrots, and mushrooms.  I also tried it with a bottled Balsamic Vinaigrette marinade/dressing for added ease.  I will definitely make this again and suggest you try it too!  So good!!

Oh. My. Goodness!  Almost too pretty to eat, but that would a shame because the flavors are amazing!  I didn’t change a thing!  I highly suggest making this by the recipe the first time you make it...then, if you are so inclined, change it up on your second time (and, oh yes, there WILL be a second time)!

Even my sons commented on how good this was.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  This will become a regular meal in our house.

This was so good I had to write my first review! I doubled the "sauce" and the veggies, but that's because I have 3 hungry boys at home and they all gave it 5 stars too. Follow the recipe, it is seriously perfect as is.

I would use a little less balsamic vinegar, and add mushrooms and cherry tomatoes next time around, but great healthy, bold flavor!

Like a previous reviewer I'm not in the habit of reviewing, but I had to this time.
Outstanding! I doubled the thighs. Everybody loved it. And there was so little clean-up.

This recipe was amazing!  My only change was to add in a teaspoon of granulated garlic and I also threw in some artichoke hearts!  It tastes as good as it looks!

I used boneless chicken thighs and they were tender and juicy. I baked the dish for 43 minutes and the seasonings were delicious. I cut the baby potatoes in half but they were a bit too crunchy -- not quite done. I will definitely make this recipe again but will parboil the potatoes. I think that will take care of the thorough cooking.

High marks! Limited  prep, came out of the oven looking like a photo on a food blog.  Divinely delish. Will make a million times.
