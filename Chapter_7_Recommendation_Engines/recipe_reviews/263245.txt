I made this recipe using 2 salmon filets so I reduced the ingredients by half. The sauce for basting the fish was delicious.  I did not have honey mustard so I used a teaspoon of yellow mustard and a teaspoon of honey.  Alas, I did not have enough of the sauce left over to make the wine sauce, but will definitely plan to make it next time.  I cooked the fish in my Waring toaster oven on broil with great results.  Fish was moist and perfectly cooked.  I look forward to making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.
