My mom made these for our reception when we got married 14 years ago. I've since made them and they are a crowd pleaser. I add a little extra cayenne pepper, as I like them a little spicier. They make a good Christmas gift packaged in a decorative tin or jar.

These are good, they do need some sort of heat (I used red pepper flakes).  But they do not stay together AT ALL.  And the Rice Krispies are hard little nuggets in the otherwise soft crumbs.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  Although the flavor was good, they turned out so crumbly as to be nothing like a cracker.  I guess they'll make a good casserole topper.  Very disappointed.

I always appreciate a cheese straw type snack around the holidays, and made these this year because the Krispies sound good.  Disappointed.  I followed the recipe except for about 1 1/2 tablespoons more shortening than called for. My crackers came out WAY too delicate. I will go back to a traditional rolled and cut cheese cracker in the future.

I had no trouble with these being too crumbly as I made sure the butter was softened  ALMOST, but not quite, to the point of melting.   Donâ€™t be afraid of the cayenne pepper I used a bit less than the 1/2 tsp - wished I had used the full 1/2 tsp.  Will definitely make again.

This is the best cheese cracker recipe I have used ever! These come out just like the picture and are crispy and cheesy. You can't tell there are Rice Krispies in it but that's what keeps it light and crisp. I would recommend a little more red pepper added. They came up in one piece and last.

So great!!!! I used salted butter and cut back the amount a smidge. Let chill in the fridge as a log and cut up into disks which I fried lightly on each side. Heaven.

Extra spice is a good idea.  I used Ancho Chile Powder.
Not sure the rice crispies stay crisp. Might try chopped pecans and see how that works. Great flavor though!

Don't make these unless you are ready to give them as gifts or eat them all! These are terrific. I'll make some changes in my next batch ... maybe more cheese, a little less flour (a little crumbly) but make no mistake these are the bomb .... Perhaps think perfect with the perfect martini? Don't skimp on the hot stuff..it makes all the difference in the world !
