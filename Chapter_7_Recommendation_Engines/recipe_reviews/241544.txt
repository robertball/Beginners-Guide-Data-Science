I think this recipe had several flaws in the directions.  You would be better stirring with a wooden spoon.  The recipe does not state what size cutter you should use. I used a 2-1/2" cookie cutter and a large frosting tip to cut the whole out of the center. My yield was nine doughnuts. The recipe also did not state if the baking sheet should be greased or ungreased. Definitely grease your baking pan. The texture and taste is more like a sweetened biscuit instead of a doughnut. The doughnut was very moist. I made some rolled in sugar as the recipe stated and some in cinnamon sugar.  We thought the doughnuts were too sugary.

These are not a fried cake donut, so they’re not going to taste like that. More like a sweet biscuit, as another reviewer pointed out. I liked them quite a bit. Used my own homemade baking mix, so I needed to add a bit more to get the dough to the right consistency. I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon in the dough, and added a tsp of vanilla. I baked these on parchment. I used the butter-cinnamon sugar topping as written. These would be awesome with a glaze, I’m going to try an eggnog and powdered sugar glaze next time. Good recipe to make as is, but tweaking it will be fun too.

i made these for my mother's  friends in the U.P. they all said they are amazing. i had to agree. what i would do is double glaze the doughnuts by mixing confectioners sugar with water and add some orange, lemon,apple,or lime juice to the glaze which will bring out the great taste of a apple fritter,lime fritter,orange fritter, or lemon fritter.  :) ;)

I made these but increased the milk because I made them in a donut pan. Very yummy!

I think you should rename this recipe to "Pancake Bites" as the taste and texture of this recipe remind me nothing of donuts and entirely of pancakes. Serve with maple syrup to get the full effect.
