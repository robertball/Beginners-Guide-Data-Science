Great quiche! My whole family loved it! I put a little cheese on the bottom of the crust and it was yum. :)

I have made many quiche recipes over the years and this was absolutely the best!. I used Krusteaz pie crust mix for the crust, and Trader Joe's mediteranean cheese mix. (Provolone, Fontina, Kasseri) The quiche took longer, maybe because I used a pottery quiche dish, not a pie pan. OOOOH so worth the wait. My family loves this and I will make it again as soon as I have some leftover steamed broccoli......thanks

In a word "yummy". I think this was one of the best quiches I ever made, and my husband, who is a "real man" liked it too.

Very nice quiche. Great flavor. It was a little wet the first time I made it, even though I drained the broccoli well, so the next time I added just a bit of flour to the egg mixture, and it was perfect!

I made this despite my husband's claims that he doesn't like quiche :) It was very good, loved the provolone & garlic. Instead of crust, I always use prepared stuffing mix. Make up according to directions & press into bottom of baking dish. It is a little different, and is lower calories than regular pastry. Very tasty!

This was the first quiche I'd ever made. The results were so-so, but I think it was my error. It certainly was yummy.
The broccoli probably needed to be drained more - it made the quiche a bit runny. Next time I might try tossing the sauteed broccoli in Bisquick or flour to absorb any excess water before adding it to the quiche pan.

I made this for christmas morning and it was a HUGE success!!!  I used a Marie Calendar (sp?) pre-made pie crust that was soooo good everyone thought I had made it from scratch:) I added mushrooms too....this is such a GREAT recipe...I can't wait to email it to my friends and family.

This is a great and easy quiche! I've made it at least three times with different variations, and it turns out nicely each time.  I would suggest sprinkling a little flour over the veggies to absorb remaining moisture...and I have found that it really makes TWO quiches, so I split the ingredients between two ready-made crusts.  Green pepper and spinach work equally well as broccoli.  YUMMMMMM!

This is fantastic, can't wait to mess with this one. Kids even liked it.I made as directed but only had 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream used milk for the rest. Had to use cheddar it was all I had. It took a little less time to cook for me.Thank you, this is a keeper.

OH MY GOSH. soooooo good. i did a couple of things different - i didnt use actual garlic, i used garlic powder. i also put about half a cup of cheese in the egg mixture, as well as on top. then, when i was sauteing the broccoli and onions, i added salt and pepper, as well as in the egg mixture. i will definitely make this again. it was amazing, better than any quiche ive ever tasted.

The broccoli needs to be chopped really small. Big florets take up too much space. As written, this is just OK. With a bunch of changes it can be good. Make sure you chop up the broccoli small and drain it really really well. To combat some of the blandness, add some cumin to the egg mixture. I also left off the crust. You really don't need a crust. It's just extra calories. I greased my glass pie pan really well before adding the stuff.

I used half and half instead of cream. I didn't need the whole pint and I only used 3 eggs plus one egg white. I did add a little flour - I think I'd put even more in, as it was still a little wet. As another reviewer suggested, I put cheese on the bottom and top of the quiche. We enjoyed this dish. YUM!

Perfect! I made this recipe exactly as written adding only a sprinkling of flour to the broccoli to absorb excess moisture. I used a Pillsbury crust in my own 9" pie plate and the amount was perfect. Took it to a bridal shower brunch and got raves!

The broccoli filling yielded two quiches. Used a bit of fresh red pepper instead of pepper flakes. Used only 1/2 onion. Only one garlic clove. Added some cheese to bottom of crust as well as top. Used cheddar/gruyere.  Used the following proportion for each quiche: 4 eggs, 1 yolk, 1/2 pint cream. Cooked for 50 minutes. Used my own pie crust.

made this twice so far. The first time was perfect, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I substituted half and half for cream and had to bake almost 25 minutes longer to have it set in the center. The flavor was still great, but it took a long time.

I really enjoyed this quiche and so did my family which says a lot.  The only thing I changed was using whole milk in lieu of cream, and cheddar cheese instead of provolone.  Try this recipe!

BEST, BEST quiche I have ever eaten.  Substituted a whole wheat crust, added sauteed mushrooms and carmelized onions and doubled the garlic.

Cream makes it so fattening but LIGHT!!!

It struck me that this recipe would be a bit bland if it weren't for the rich heavy cream. I didn't want to make it so fattening so I made it with half the volume 1/2 + 1/2 and half milk, added some nutmeg, and put a layer of mustard on the bottom of the pie shell (I always do that with quiche) and it still was a little bland...maybe it needs the cream. I dunno. It was okay, I've made better with really sharp cheddar.

This was really good.  I was skeptical at first because it seemed like too much cream for the amount of eggs but it was perfect.  I left out the onion because I don't like onions but otherwise everything was the same.  Definately don't leave out the red pepper because I think that made the dish.  And make sure all the water is drained from the broccoli.  I added some flour like the other reviewers suggested but if you pat them dry with a paper towel I think you should be fine.

This is one of my favorite quiche recipes!  I have made it twice now.  The second time I used only 1/2 the onion because the first time it was a little overpowering.  Also, I use the Kraft crumbles cheese with provolone, feta, and one other.  I used the whole bag.  Very moist and tasty!  Even my 3 and 7 year old liked this one!

I was looking for a recipe to use some beautiful organic provolone cheese.  This was a good choice.  I made a wheat/gluten free version with a crust made a brown rice - just press boiled brown rice into the bottom and sides of the pie dish brushed with olive oil - as my little boy can't eat wheat.  I also used half cream and half ricotta cheese.  The quiche looked and tasted delicious.

I used two whole eggs and maybe 1/4 cup of cream. I also ended up adding some extra-sharp Cheddar cheese for a little more flavor. It turned out ok but I wish I had cut the broccoli smaller. Next time I will add more of the Cheddar. Thanks!

I made this for a Christmas morning brunch, and it was fairly underwhelming.  It's tough to put my finger on what made it so bland; I love garlic, onions, and chili powder, but something was . . . off.

Delicious! Everyone raved! Said it was the best quiche they ever tasted! Used bacon grease instead of olive oil (not as healthy but really good)! Used 3/4 of a pint of Half and Half and the rest 2% milk! Amazing!

Made this today as written with the exception of adding more seasoning to my taste and decreasing the amount of cream slightly. Was delicious and not wet, set perfectly at 35 minutes. Kids even liked it lol. Thanks

Good recipe. Substitute different cheeses, I used Swiss and Gruyere, to give this more character.

I just finished making it. It's very yummy. Only thing is i followed the measurements exactly but I still had egg mixture left over. I an definitely going to make it again but I think I'll add some other kind of pepper with the pepper flakes for some extra kick.

I'm giving this 3 stars, but it is probably because I didn't have some of the ingredients and tried to sub them.  I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used a substitute of butter and milk (I found the substitution online) - this made it very greasy on the top - however I put about 1/2 c seasoned bread crumbs sprinkled on top to soak it up and that turned out yummy!  I didn't have a pie crust, so just put the egg mixture right into the pan (this is lower fat anyways and I like my quiches without the crust).  I also had no provolone cheese so used medium cheddar instead, and I mixed half in with the egg mixture and sprinkled the rest on top.  I followed everything else in the recipe.  Next time I make it, I will prob go buy heavy cream and try it with that.  Overall, it was pretty good, just very wet. ****If you want to make it lower fat, cut the crust out of the recipe and top it with seasoned bread crumbs (I used garlic powder and Italian seasoning - it's really yummy and crispy!)****

O..M..G..! Beautiful results. Lots of compliments. I made this quiche last nigh just for fun, and let me tell you: it was a hit! Now everybody wants the recipe. The only thing I did was I left out the egg yolk that the recipe called for. That's it. It turned out delicious! Thanks for sharing. Monica

I am pretty surprised by all of the 5 star ratings.  This quiche was just okay for me.  Served it at a brunch and no one really commented and there was plenty left over.  It was just a bit bland; nothing 5 star worthy.

This is one of the best I've tasted.  I used evaporated milk for the cream.  YUM! And used shredded Swiss and Italian cheese. Layered it on the crust and top.  Make sure you let it sit for at least 5-10 minutes before cutting.

The reason this did not come out so good was probably my fault.  I did not have heavy cream on hand so I used about 2 cups of milk.  I am pretty new to cooking so I am not sure if maybe I put too much milk in or what but it made my crust soggy.  If I make this again I will use the cream and mix in the provolone cheese instead of putting it on top.

This is another successful recipe! We did make it a bit healthier by adding fat free milk instead of the heavy cream. It still tasted great :) We had a little of the mixture left that wouldn't fit into the pie crust, and not wanting it to go to waste, we just put it in a couple small pyrex dishes and cooked it without the crust. So even without the crust, it was still yummy. Thanks for sharing!

I increased the egg mixture and made two deep-dish quiches-- one broccoli and one cauliflower.  I used frozen vegetables instead of fresh, because that's what I had on hand.  The quiches needed 10-15 minutes more cooking time, possibly because I had two in the oven at the same time. I used thyme as the main seasoning in the cauliflower one, which was okay, but not fantastic.  The seasonings with the broccoli (as in the recipe) were just about right.

Only change I made was to only use 2 cups of tiny cut 3/8" pieces of broccoli and to increase the onion to 1 cup chopped (I love grilled onions).  A 1/4 tsp of salt was perfect.   The provolone cheese topping was delicious!  And the baked quiche had a pretty presentation.

Very good.  My family loved it.     I used a gluten free crust and half and half instead of cream.   I also roasted the broccoli instead of steaming it.  I just broke the broccoli into small florets, spread them on a cookie sheet, sprayed with EVOO, added salt and pepper and roasted just until starting to brown.

Turned out great.  I will make this again.

Very tasty, very simple. To make just one, I used 3C broccoli and titrated the eggs back to 3, the milk to 12 oz. Next time, I'd use even just a tad less milk because it still spoiled over a bit. And, beginner cooks, do yourself a favor and put the pie plate on a baking sheet first before you even pour the ingredients in!

Used a little less onion and garlic than the recipe states. Excellent bunch dish! Leftovers (if you have any) reheat well in the oven.

Once this was finally done it tasted pretty good.  But it took way longer than the directions said and I ended up having to nuke it for about 6 minutes to get the eggs to a barely set stage.  I'll make this again but noting that 35 minutes in the oven wasn't even close to enough cooking time. Update: Made this again tonight and had to use sliced provolone so followed someone else's suggestion and lined the pie crust with cheese first.  Way too much egg mixture for one pie crust but I cooked it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes this time, added more slice provolone and cooked it another 10 minutes.  Then let it sit for 5 minutes. It was AWESOME!!  We loved it.

This had a great flavor! I let it cook 40 minutes and it was still a tad wet. Made the crust and used a ceramic deep dish pie pan, and it came out of the oven looking like a picture--I'll make it again!
