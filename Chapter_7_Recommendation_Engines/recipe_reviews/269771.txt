Love love love  this pasta recipe!  I followed the recipe and noticed the cooks notes to add serrano peppers for added spice. I have roasted hatch Chile so I added 1-1/2 peppers instead of the serrano and it was fantastic. 

Don't skip on sprinkling  parmesan cheese on top when serving.

 I also suggest saving some of the pasta water in case you need to add a bit to the pasta. Mine needed a little after it sat in the pan waiting for us to get a second serving.

This is now my favorite pasta sauce. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
