My two star rating is for the sauce as is.  Here is my advice: Cut the vinegar to one tablespoon!  This sauce will make you pucker if made as written, the vinegar takes over the taste of anything you put it on!  Then add one tablespoon of white sugar or honey.  Now you've got a dipping sauce!

WOAH HOLY VINEGAR BATMAN!  The vinegar is just too much, I even added some honey to cut it and it's still way too much.

I do prefer sweet and sour sauce with my egg rolls, but I thought that this was a tasty alternative that made for a nice change of pace.  Wouldn't this also make a good marinade for grilled chicken and pork or tofu???

Made this to go with homemade crab wontons.  The sauce was great.  Instead of onion powder, I used green onion and I used balsamic rice vinegar.  It really had a nice balance.  Will make this again.

Loved this sauce!  I taught an Egg Roll making class last week and we made 3 different dipping sauces, and this one was everyone's favorite!  Super easy and quick.

Very good... I didn't have the onion but it still tasted good! Also for people complaining about the vinegar, Mirin (sweet cooking wine) is a great substitute

Great dipping sauce!  I needed a super-quick sauce for egg rolls and this literally took about a minute to toss together.  I'd just run out of rice vinegar so I substituted plain white vinegar instead and it was still great!  Also, some of us put some sriracha sauce in to heat it up... good with or without.  Thanks!

Was ok.  Better then not having a dipping sauce.  Quick & easy!  If you don't like vinegar much, you may want to skip this one.

Tasty sauce. I like it a lot and so does my family. I tend to make a second, mustard-based, sauce as well.

Danickstr here.  I am now realizing many years later that I had meant this for pot stickers as opposed to egg rolls. I hope it turned out OK for egg rolls as well.  I would probably add something sweeter for egg rolls, but maybe not. :)

I love vinegar so I loved this sauce.  No one else used it in my family.  They used the bottled sweet & sour instead.  I'll make this again for myself because I LOVE vinegar on almost everything!  I love sesame oil too!

This wasn't the best sauce it had way too much soy sauce and the porportions were off. I didn't have any ginger on hand, which may have made a difference. Either way it didn't set right with the egg rolls I had.

Good, but not great.  This sauce tastes more like dipping sauce for pot stickers.  If I ever made pot stickers, then I would definitely make this sauce to go with it, but I prefer a less tangy sauce for my eggrolls.

We buy packages of frozen Chinese Dumplings and always run out of the included dipping sauce before we run out of dumplings.  This recipe absolutely perfect and so easy to put together...no more dry dumplings!

I doubled the soy sauce as it had a little too much vinegar and sesemee oil taste for my liking, and gave us a little extra sauce. Off hand it was good but I can't compare it to a purchased sauce as I have never bought any.

I should have read the reviews before I tried this. The proportion of vinegar is way off in this as written. I'd suggest mixing the other ingredients and then adding a bit of vinegar at a time otherwise the vinegar is just way to overwhelming

I have to agree with other posters on this one: too vinegary. Also, if you're a fan of the usual plum sauce, this will be quite different from what you are expecting. I would add sugar and cut the vinegar for starters. Maybe play around with fresh garlic. But at that point, you might as well look for another recipe.

Very good sauce. I love vinegar, but my husband doesn't so I sweetened it up by adding two tablespoons of brown sugar and he like it much better. We bought sushi and used it for dipping as well as egg rolls. Yum!!

This is SO good!  I made crab rangoon and used this as a dipping sauce!  My kids couldn't get enough!  It would be good as a marinade too!  I did decrease the vinegar to 1.5 tbs.

Good recipe and quick.  I made it for some steamed dumplings that were begging for a dipping sauce. It had a nice tang to it which everyone liked, maybe next time I'll play around with it and add some honey to sweeten it up.  I did only add 1/2 tsp of ginger powder though, which for me was plenty.

I used this dipping sauce to go with the mexican egg rolls I made. The sauce had good flavor and was simple to make but this wasnt the exact sauce I was anticipating. I didnt change anything. Thanks for the recipe.
