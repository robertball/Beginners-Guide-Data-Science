These little goof balls are delish! I was looking for something new for a charity bake sale and these worked out great.  I will definately make them again.  I used toothpicks to dip and coat my marshmallows.  I left the toothpicks in and because it is close to Easter and I had them on hand, I topped each toothpick with one of those cute bunny shaped marshmallows.  The recipe makes a lot of sauce; I stopped at 60 marshmallows and had sauce left over.  Bonus- this sauce, once cooled, is perfect for apple dipping! I think I'll try crushing the rice crispies next time, my kids left a trail of crispies leading right to the tv.

These are always a big hit. I don't really like marshmallows but I can't resist these treats. I use crushed oreos, crushed golden grams or toasted coconut as toppings and make multiple flavors for each batch for a twist.

Nice and gooey, yet easy to make. I used Fruity Pebbles to make them pretty, an idea I got from a reader's photo. That was my only mistake. I thought the cereal made them taste disgusting! But they did look very pretty and colorful! If I made them again I'd definitely stick with regular rice krispies.

These are so great!  Especially if you have kids running around, they're easy and the kids can even help you make them.   I started out making these as the recipe stated and I just wasn't happy with how they were looking, so I ended up cutting the marshmallows in half... they turned out MUCH better and tasted better than the big ones as well!  I only made it through one bag of marshmallows before I ran out of caramel though!

These were surprisingly delicious!  It does make a lot of sauce and next time I might cut back on the margarine.

These were fun to make! My kids formed an assembly line, which worked well. We made our own caramel, used real butter and coated half with fruity pebbles. We left the toothpicks in and topped with bunny shaped marshmallows. We didn't make the whole batch...we topped apples with the left over caramel..two treats in one! Thanks for sharing.

Only about half the kids liked these - and I, who love condensed milk and caramel, did not like them either.  :(

My husbands Grandma always made them at Christmas and so we make them as they bring Memories. We like them and they always disappear at School parties where you are supposed to bring goodies.
