I felt that the banana pudding fake banana taste overwhelmed the cake.   Next time I'll use one vanilla and one banana pudding.  I sliced one banana over the pudding, under the cool whip, and next time I'll add more.  It was good the day we made it but soooooo much better the next day so I really would suggest making this in advance

I added a pack of cream cheese and crushed pineapples to the cool whip. It was delicious. 
.... oh yeas I also sprinkled coconut flaked over the top, which after I had done so I wish I had toasted the coconut   first. 
HOPE YOU ENJOY MY LITTLE TWIST TO THIS.

I think the trick is, as soon as the pudding begins to thicken, stop whisking it, and dump it onto the cake. It was just fine. Overall it was good. It wasn't "oh wow" ...but I'd make it again. I didn't bother with a picture because it looks identical to the first main photo on the recipe.

If you like bananas (which I do) this is a pretty good recipe. I will make it again. HOWEVER, you need to add 4 cups of milk! I'm glad I already knew that or it wouldn't have turned out right.

I tweaked it a little and used vanilla pudding instead of banana and put slices strawberries between the pudding and shipped cream and a few on top and it was AMAZING!!! This is 1 of my new favorite cakes :)

I used banana nut bread, added 2 extra packages of pudding and made it kind of soupy, poured it over cake mix so it would get the bread really moist inside, put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, then proceeded with the remaining prep, adding bananas on top of the pudding, then the whipped topping and vanilla wafer crumbs. It turned out absolutely delicious. It actually happened by mistake the first time, as the pudding would not set up, so I put it in the fridge to get it to set up. That didn't work, so I added two more packages of pudding that did thicken up. The rest, as they say, is history.

I poked the cake and lathered on the pudding,  then put down a layer of banana slices, covering the pudding layer. Topped that with whipped topping, crushed nilla wafers, whole nilla wafers(mini) and additional banana slices. Beautiful and delicious! Make with the recipe on the pudding box for pie filling, which uses less milk, making a thicker pudding.

Okay I made this yesterday and you must make it a day ahead. Last night I was like it’s okay but today it’s so good!!! Next time I will use a name brand cake mix instead of a store brand. I added a 8 oz cream cheese (room temp) thanks to another review) to the pudding it has a curdled look but you don’t see that in the layers. also do a total of 4 cups of milk (measure it) because otherwise it’s too thick. I might even add a little more because it didn’t run down into the cake like I wanted. I sliced 3 bananas and put in single layer on top of the pudding then put the cool whip. I put cookies around the edges and added more than a cup of crumbs on top more like 2 cups. I let it totally cool down and I think that was a mistake it should have still been warm when I put the pudding on top and it just stayed on top instead of seeping into the cake.  Very good!!!!!

Made it and everyone LOVED it.  Simple to make.  I put the wafers on before whip topping and let people put it on if they wanted as I served it.

After reading the reviews I made this with a few additions. First I decided to mash up some ripe bananas I had and added them to the cake mix along with a  few chopped toasted walnuts and a drop of vanilla.  When done I poked the cake and poured on the pudding ( I used vanilla only), I then spread a can of drained pineapple on top.  At this point my pan was too small so when we were ready to eat it I put cool whip on top along with a few vanilla wafers. I must say it got Fantastic raves from all who at it!  I will definitely  make this again but use a 4 quart dish.

I loved it.. Wife thought it was ok. Followed directions exactly The trick is getting pudding consistency just right before pouring over cake.  too runny and it soaks through making cake wet, too thick and it just sits on top. I too added several banana slices on top.  I will make again..

It was really great, but I did make some changes.

I used 3 cups whole milk and 1 cup condensed milk for my pudding. 

Added a teaspoon of vanilla amd lemon juice (eyeballed) to my cake mix, so it wouldn't taste like a boxed cake.

Baked on 350 for 20 minutes instead of the recommended time on the box.

Added sliced bananas and crushed vanilla wafers to the top.

I made this and it was okay. Followed the directions but the pudding didn't thicken up and so the bottom of the cake was really moist and runny.

Folks, it doesn't get any easier than this.  And talk about a CROWD PLEASER! I've made this one several times since finding it 8 months ago and done different variations now.  The two favorites have been lemon and oreo with chocolate cake.
Thanks for posting, this is now my go-to!

Really great, simple recipe. Made for work potluck, everyone loved it. Made with light cool whip. Put bananas between the pudding and the coolwhip and then over the cookies on top.

My family loved this. Made just as the recipe. No alterations. A very different take on banana pudding. Will definitely make again. Thanks!!!

The pudding was too thick to spread and not enough to cover the cake.

Big hit with the family!  I added strawberries to the top with the Nilla Wafers, which gave it a great, light, summertime taste.  Would definitely make this again!
