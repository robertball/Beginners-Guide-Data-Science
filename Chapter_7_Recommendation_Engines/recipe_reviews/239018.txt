This is delicious, and the perfect meal to impress company!  I've never seen pork loins come in 1lb roasts, so I'm assuming this recipe is for tenderloins - they usually are between 1-1.25 lbs each.  Also, 1 lb of meat does not serve 6 people, so I highly suggest making at least 2.  I didn't have honey dijon, so I used regular dijon with great results. I also added some olive oil to roast the vegetable mixture. I didn't use the full amount of thyme because it sounded like a lot, but that is personal preference. After reading through the directions, 45 mins + 25 mins of roasting at 450* seemed excessive for vegetables, so this is what I did: I roasted them for 20 mins, added the pork, then roasted an additional 30 minutes until the pork was at 145*. Everything was done to perfection! Thank you starsmed for the wonderful recipe! I can't wait to make it again!

I added Yukon gold potatoes because I had a few. Was very good. However, I used both tenderloins and more veggies than it called for. I started it all at the same time instead of the veggies first. I think the veggies would've been way over cooked had I started them earlier. I also added some water to the pan during cooking as the pan was dry. Awesome flavor though!! Will definitely make this again.

Am making it right now and the veggies are done but the pork nowhere near done. Next time i'll roast the veggies for a much shorter time, then add the pork. Took the veggies out and will put them back in for the last 10 mins.

this was my first encounter with fennel, it was delicious, roast was moist, and flavorful. I'm guessing the recipe is calling for fresh thyme cause I used dried and only used half and it seemed like a lot. I would make this again.

Followed the recipe but did remove the vegetables early as they were done. Otherwise, this was a great recipe and I have made it several times.  I would not recommend replacing the fennel with potatoes, as you lose the great flavor of the fennel.

It smelled great while cooking but there actually wasn't much flavor in the end. I mostly followed the recipe... used potatoes instead of fennel because that's what I had on hand, tossed the veggies with olive oil for roasting. I lowered the oven temp to 400 and roasted the veggies alone for 20 min, then added the pork and left it in for about 40 mins (flipping halfway through). Everything was cooked well, just missing some flavor.  Maybe needed to salt and pepper the pork loin before adding the honey mustard?

Amazingly good, but needed additional honey mustard thyme sauce added just before serving.

This is fantastic. This is the first time we had fennel and it was absolutely delicious. I read the reviews and followed LilSnoo's suggestion regarding the cooking time and olive oil. We were so pleased with the outcome: the pork was incredibly moist and tender, and the carrots and fennel complimented it beautifully. I can't imagine swapping out the fennel for anything else because the flavour it added was just divine. Thanks for the recipe!

Enjoyed this a lot.  Cooked pork and veggies at the same time as others suggested, but I'll have to play with the cooking time to get both properly done at the same time.  My one variation was due to my distaste for honey mustard so I used regular mustard and added a chopped (unpeeled) sweet apple to the veggies.  That worked great for me.

The pork was amazing, but I think the oven temp was too high for the veggies at 425. After 45 minutes mine were burned to crisps. After adding the pork for another 25 minutes, they were inedible. I would do the veggies separately next time.

This was really good.  I only used half a tablespoon of salt and that was plenty.

Great recipe! Followed the ingredients but added 2 gold potatoes. I also did a small drizzle of olive oil over the vegetables before putting them in the oven. 

I followed the advice of other reviewers and only baked the vegetables for 20mins before adding the pork and baking for an additional 30mins. Vegetables came out tender and the pork was at a perfect temperature.

I loved the taste of this pork loin.  Very easy to make and delicious!  I added potatoes to the vegetable mixture, skin on, diced.  They cooked up perfectly with everything else.  I didn't have honey mustard on hand so I rubbed the pork loin with dijon mustard and drizzled it with real honey.  I did have to bake it for about 13 minutes longer than called for to finish the pork.  Worth the wait!  My kids liked it, too!

My family liked it but said it needed a smidge more flavor. Everything cooked perfectly. Next time I am going to add more of the honey mustard sauce as well as sprinkling fennel seeds over the pork.

Loves this! Made no changes,  but next time I'll cut back the cooking time on the veggies.  A little bit too soft for me.

An excellent recipe, but when roasting vegetables I have always tossed them in a bowl with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Olive oil should be included in your recipe.

OMG, who puts a tablespoon of salt on that many veggies?!? We love our salt, but these were inedible they were so salty. I should have trusted my instincts when prepping and gone with a teaspoon instead.

I loved this but left out the fennell, which I detest.  I know that's not the way to review a recipe, but there you are.  I used potatoes instead, and some celery.   It was delish.

Very good & easy to make.  I made extra marinade to put on at the end.  It was delicious
