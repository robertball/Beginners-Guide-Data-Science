This was absolutely delicious!  I've made this one several times now.  Sometimes, I add melted dark chocolate chips plus Nesquik...for the chocoholics in my family!  Thanks!!!

This is a really good recipe. I love it on a hot day. I like to add chocolate syrup and a little more ice cream/powder. Also, I use carnation instant breakfast chocolate powder so it is somewhat healthy. Delicious!

Really good and easy. This is the first homemade milkshake my son has tasted, and he asked if we could have it everyday! I used large scoops of ice cream and hot cocoa mix.

I didn't have chocolate icecream so I used vanilla icecream and some hot coco mix. It was delicious! I definitally will make it again for my parents.

I used 2 individual Blue Bell cups and it was yummy. I would probably use half a cup of milk so that it's a little thicker for me. Quick, easy, cheap, and good...can't beat it.

The question is "how big is a scoop?"  I added 2 huge scoops and less milk because I like a nice and thick chocolate shake.  It was just right with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Yummy!  I might add some Peppermint drops next time for a minty version.

This recipe was way too thin, and was closer to chocolate milk than a shake.  I had to use 3x the ice cream called for and even then it wasn't really thick enough.

Followed the recipe and it came out great. Not too thick, not too thin; perfect drinking consistency,  rich chocolate taste.
