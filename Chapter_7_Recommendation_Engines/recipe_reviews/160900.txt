You can't lose with this recipe.  Everyone will love it.  Pecans, butter, eggs, brown sugar and pasta.  There won't be any leftovers!  I use a 2.5 liter Pyrex baking dish (also called a casserole dish) and bake the kugel with the cover on.  Enjoy!

This was a BIG HIT at my table for Shabbat lunch. The pecan and brown sugar topping was soooo good, and it looked beautiful. A great side dish to put on the table when having guests.

The noodle puddling was delicious. It was very sweet however.  I would cut the sugar in half. The presentation was beautiful and everyone liked it.
