I took negative review to heart (the pesto-crab combo seemed too much to me also) and cut out pesto and shrimp to get pure crab taste.  I rep[lced the pesto with lemon butter (lightly spread).  Examine type of cheese to suit your taste; nothing too strong to preserve crab flavor.  I used provalone.

We served this strata for Christmas brunch, and unfortunately, it didn't go over too well.  There were a LOT of steps to prepare the dish; it took longer than I expected to put it together.  The taste was just okay; it seemed to be missing something, but I don't know what since there are so many ingredients already in it.  I really wanted to like this; sorry.

Excellent dish.  I used a sundried tomato pesto and it worked beautifully.  A great company dish as you can make it ahead.  This dish, a green salad and glass of white wine - Yummy!

I made this for an Easter gathering along side 2 other egg pies and it was a huge hit!  Definately worth the work.

My whole family loved this!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I had already cut up the bread into small chunks, so I just mixed the pesto in with the egg and cream mixture.  It made the house smell wonderful!

I liked this.. first bite I wasn't sure, but hen second bite it was good. I used skim milk, a little less cheese and no butter. The cheese was a little tart.. not a big fan of swiss anyway, so next  time I think I might use Monterey Jack or another milder cheeese

Because of previous reviews and the fact that our family did not want a lot of basil, I used shrimp sauce with horseradish as my seasoning..  It was ok, but not something I would make again.

What a great success!  My suggestion is to raise the cooking temperature to 400/425. wait until it starts to bubble, then you are guaranteed that the middle will be cooked and hot.  Cooking time varies with each oven.
