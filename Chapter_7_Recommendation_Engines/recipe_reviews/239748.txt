These are my kids favorite! I make at least 2 batches every year during the holidays. I like to just add some colored sprinkles on top to decorate them. So pretty, and delicious too! Hard to eat just one!

These are delicious.  I made these and the Oreo cookie truffles and everyone loves them.  I made the truffles, then froze them on a cookie sheet.  I then put them in a ziplock bag until I was ready to dip them.  I read somewhere not to dip cold chocolate, but they turned out perfect.

Yummy and easy. Looks like I slaved in the kitchen making these. Great with chocolate/peanut butter sandwhich cookies and a  peanut butter coating.

Very good and easy! I put them in the freezer for about an hour before dipping them.

I've made these several times now and I keep getting requests! I use milk chocolate and an extra row of cookies because my boyfriend doesn't care for cream cheese. I just bought a set of candy dipping tools to make these even easier to make today. I also found that putting the rolled balls in the freezer before dipping made them much easier to handle. Thanks for a great recipe!

I only set aside 1/4c cookie crumbs for putting on the truffles later.  1/2c was too much.  DELICIOUS!!!
