Please forgive me for being the person who completely changes the recipe but this also serves as my record of what I did. :) 

First, I used bottom round roast instead of ground beef. I cut it into small chunks, browned it with some olive oil and the simmered it in one can of beef broth for about 20 minutes. When the beef was finished, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 T chopped garlic, pepper and seasoning salt to taste, and stirred/cooked until combined. I then added about a cup of sour cream and cooked / stirred until combined. I added my cooked noodles and wa-la! Perfection.

I followed other reviewers' suggestion and added a dash or two of Worcestshire sauce.  Also, I used fresh mushrooms.  My husband  loves comfort food, and this is an easy and tasty comfort food meal.

I liked that this recipe combined simple ground beef with some white wine. Very good flavors and a nice comfort food. Made as written

Flavor was really tasty. Next time I make, I'll reduce the beef broth by a 1/2-1 cup, as I prefer my sauce thicker than what is the end result with this recipe.

This is a very basic recipe for seasoning that you can adjust to your family's likings. I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup, Herbox no sodium beef bouillon and 8 oz fresh mushrooms. I added onion powder, garlic powder, garlic & herb Mrs Dash, Worchestire sauce and Dijon mustard. I served over egg noodles, my husband really enjoyed it! This is a fast weeknight dinner.
