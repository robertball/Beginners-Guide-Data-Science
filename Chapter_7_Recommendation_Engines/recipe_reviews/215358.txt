I made this months ago when shorecook first shared this recipe. It's really tasty. I served it with Snyder's pretzels and my family at the whole bowlful. I commented back then that I think this would make a great glaze for chicken or pork, too. Kind of sweet and sour-y.

Great dip for pretzels!  I made this as a last minute appetizer to take to our neighbor's house and everyone loved it!  I of couse loved that it was so quick and easy plus it's ingredients that I always have on hand.  I served it with an assortment of pretzels (sourdough, honey wheat, regular, etc.) and those new crackers that are half pretzel and half cracker.  The sweetness of the raspberry preserves and honey really balance out the mustard nicely - I will definitely make this again.  Thanks SHORECOOK for such a great recipe!

Excellent! I originally made only 1/2 the recipe to make sure we liked it....not even 10 minutes later I was back in the kitchen making more, lol! I didn't have mustard seeds on hand, so I omitted those. We really LOVED the flavor that the raspberrry preserves added to this, and I agree w/ tat2, this would make a wonderful glaze for chicken or even pork chops. Thnks, SHORECOOK for yet another GREAT recipe! :)

Don't know just why it has taken me so long to add my review to this!  I make it every time we have my soft pretzels or pretzel dogs!  My daughter is a pretzel addict so I try to make extra for her and she takes a little container to school some days in her lunch with crispy pretzels.  Yeah - it is that good.  So simple to put together, takes no time to do.  It is well balanced in flavors.  Sometimes I make a half a batch without the raspberry and add jalapeno powder - about 1/2 teaspoon - for a very spicy dip.  Good recipe - you should try it!

OMG! I made this dip last weekend for our family game night. It was such a huge hit! I loved it so much, that I am going to put the dip in pretty jars and give it out as a little Christmas Treat along with a bag of Snyders pretzels! Thank you for the great recipe!

I wish I could give this a higher rating!  We loved it and will be making it many more times to come.  Not having any mustard seed on hand I added about 1/8 tsp of ground dry mustard for a bit of kick.  I am so glad this finally was published!

Very yummy! Just like the pretzel dip I bought from Target. I used Blackberry instead of raspberry preserves b/c that is what I had on hand it's delicious! Great for lunches, snacks and get togethers.

Excellent Dip! Everyone loved it and commented on it. A little spicy, a little sweet and a little tart. Perfect balance of flavors. Thanks for sharing, Shorecook!

I just had the "original" of this dip at a party on Sunday.  I immediately searched for a recipe once I got home and saw how much it cost per jar from the maker.  I just mixed up this recipe and it is AWSOME!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  NO changes necessary.  I love the idea of putting it in fancy jars to give as a gift at Christmas with a bag of pretzels as another post mentioned.  I will definitely be doing that this year. Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Made this dip for a party we had and it was a big hit.  Left out the mustard seeds cause I didn't have any but followed the rest of the recipe. Made it a second time to take to work and had multiple people ask for the recipe so I printed a copy from AR, made copies and passed it out.   Thanks for sharing!!!

I usually purchase Rothchilds raspberry honey mustard pretzel dip.  This is very close to that recipe.  I put this mixture over meatballs in a crackpot.  It is fabulous. It is very simple to make.  I have subistuted boysenberry jam for the raspberry and it is just as good.

Husband went crazy over this, asking the kids to put it away for him.  Really yummy.  I didn't realize how much I was enjoying it until the moderate amount I had put onto my plate ran out, and I sure enough, I was wishing I could have more.  Really, really yummy!  Who knew pretzels could be this wonderful?  I might try a pretzel and veggie bar for a Christmas decorating party or some other event some time.  Celery goes well with at least some of the dips I have in mind, and anyone who enjoys turnips at all would be glad to have them included.  Apples or pears would be natural as well.  This mustard dip would be the hit of the party, I'll bet, but Ruby-Red Pretzel Sauce is a close second (from this site, though we make our own cranberry sauce, using stevia, which avoids a lot of carbs and calories).  Also want to try to find a peanut dipping sauce, which would likely contrast in yet another nice direction.  ......., but this dipping sauce?  Tops in our book!  Thanks for sharing!

This is addicting! I'm not all that familiar with using mustard seeds, but they are so good in this. The only jelly I had was a homemade jalapeno jelly that I got at the farmer's market, so I used that. Yummy!!

I had made this dip for tomorrow, Thanksgiving.  Unfortunately I taste tested it which was my downfall.  Now I can’t stop eating it.  This is a wonderful pretzel dip.  I suspect at the rate I’m going my guests will not have the opportunity to taste how delicious it is.

1/30/11:  I halved this as I'm the only one who likes mustard in this house, and I'm glad I did because I didn't have quite enough spicy mustard--I ended up grabbing a jar of stone ground mustard and adding that in to get to 1/4 cup of mustard, so I left out the mustard seeds.  I tried this with soft pretzels and Pretzel Dogs (What's for Dinner Mom's personal recipe) and I do really like it.  I'm a huge yellow mustard fan, though, so for the Pretzel Dogs I prefer regular mustard.  But for other pretzels, this is a nice, sweet dip when you want to cut the tang of mustard a bit.  And it is so extremely easy and fast to whip up. Thanks for the recipe! Update 10/23/11:  I had some of this leftover and was making Aimee's Quick Chicken from here, so I pulled an extra chicken breast out and used the rest of this to top the chicken along with bacon bits and parmesan cheese.  Really really good!  I'll use it again when I have leftover of this.  Thanks again!

This was so good that I wanted to just drink it! And don't bother making 1/2 the batch because you will be back in the kitchen making more within minutes! This doesn't make a large amount, so just go for it! I didn't have mustards seeds so I omitted that. I also added a few rings of jarred jalapeno for some heat. I mashed them and added it to the other ingredients. This does thicken up when chilled for a few hours...if you can wait that long! I'll be using this dip for soft pretzels next time. Thanks Shorecook!

Oh wow, this tastes just like those sample dips at the gourmet grocery stores. I had no idea how simple it would be to mix up. I actually had near all of the ingredients in the house. The only thing I didn't have was the mustard seed and it was fine without it. I also had to substitute strawberry jam for the raspberry, but it was no big deal. I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings, but it came out to be more like 2. This was an interesting recipe, to use up a too large bag of pretzels I bought for another recipe.

Super easy and quick to put together from things already on hand.  Not stellar or amazing, but a solid good, hence the 4 stars.

This was easy to make and quite good, but I didn't just flip over it...thus, 4 stars instead of 5.  Worth trying though for something different.

Very good!  The higher quality the preserve you use, the better the dip will be.  Can be adjusted using different fruit flavors.  Try some out, and taste test to see if it needs more honey or mustard.

I thought this was pretty good. I did not have raspberry jelly so I used grape. Boyfriend did not care for it. Quick dip to make though.

Excellent!  I didn't have raspberry jelly but it worked well with apricot.  Seems to me it would make an excellent glaze for ham as well!  Good stuff.

I will be making it for Christmas.  I did discover that there is a discrepancy between the written recipe and the shopping list that might clear up problems for some people.  The recipe calls for raspberry preserves however, the shopping list calls for raspberry jam.  This is probably the reason that some people had trouble with the recipe.  Preserves would give the dip a better thicker dip  consistency.  I will use preserves. Rated it high because it sounds so yummy.

I followed this recipe as written, but the dip is really runny and does not stick to the pretzel.   Any ideas on a good way to thicken it up?  The flavor is great, but the consistency leaves a lot to be desired.  ***UPDATE ON THE RUNNINESS ISSUE****  12/1/15    This was driving me crazy..... so I took 3 sheets of gelatin, soaked in cold water for 5 mins and then shook out the excess water when removing the sheets.  Microwaved for 5 sec and then added to my runny dip and let set for about 1/2 hour - it was perfect!

The flavor is delicious, I just wish it wasn't so runny. I agree that it would make a great sauce for chicken fingers, pork, etc.  I refrigerated it overnight, then whisked in some corn starch, & still not thickened enough for me.  Any recommendations on what to blend in to make it thicker?

Great dip for pretzels or chicken nuggets etc… Kids and Adults alike seem to love this dip..the flavour and texture keep them coming back until it's all gone.  I've made this a few times for gatherings and It has never disappointed. A keeper for me…thanks Shorecook!

Loved this!  I used Trader Joe's Spicy Brown Mustard and otherwise followed the recipe.  It wasn't quite spicy enough for me, so I added another little bit of mustard that I have that has a little more bite to it.  This is excellent!  I made it to serve alongside some pork chops that we had for dinner.  I can't wait to share this with friends!  Thank you so much, SHORECOOK!

This was really good. I substituted hot pepper jelly for the raspberry preserves. We rarely use fruit spreads, so I was trying to find uses for a jar that's been hanging around and wasn't sure if it would work in this. I read through some reviews and saw that it had worked for another person so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did.  This had a slight drip to it before chilling, but was not runny for me. It did thicken more after refrigerating. I still have more jelly and honey to use up so we'll be making this again.

This recipe saved me tonight.  I made another pretzel dip and it didn't taste very good.  So I really quick looked up more pretzel dip recipes and this one popped up.  Yummy.  I buy this dip all the time.  So happy to find the cloned one.

A very nice dip. So much better then plain mustard. I enjoyed the sweet and spicy taste of the dip and then when you add the saltiness of the pretzel it is yummy. Good for gatherings and parties or just as an every day snack that is a cut above the rest.

This is a very tasty dip, easy to adjust to your tastes. I thought it was a bit too sweet for my tastes, so added more mustard. I ate this with "Jan's Pretzel Dogs" from this site -- the sweetness level might've been perfect with regular pretzels. Can't wait to try, thanks for sharing!

So yummy!  I served this by pouring it over a block of cream cheese and it was a HUGE hit!!  The cream cheese just adds a little creamy texture to it.  I had always bought this from the store, but I will definitely be making it from scratch now!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I made a half of the recipe, but I have a feeling I will have to make another half. I will have to get mustard seeds to try in it next time. We can't stop eating it. Even my 2 year old loves it! Thanks Shore for a definite keeper!

Great tasting dip that went over well at my office.  I had to give the recipe to two coworkers and I'm putting it in our office cookbook.  I think this would also be great with cubed beer bread.

I made this to dip pretzels dogs in as many reviewers suggested this dipping sauce.  However, if I make it again, I would cut back on the sweet (honey) and make it more (savory) mustardy.  I was afraid it would be too sweet and it was,  I even added mustard powder to combat the sweetness.  :/   It makes quite a bit of dipping sauce, so half a recipe would be plenty.  Now...what to do with a surplus of sauce that I really didn't love?

I loved it as shown in recipe.  My kids thought it was a little too mustardy.  Next time I'll probably slightly reduce the mustard.  I did add a bit more jam and honey after initial tasting to please the kids.  Don't think I'll need to buy it online in the future

I used Dijon mustard which was all I had.  Whoa!  Too strong mustard flavor.  Added more honey.   Good thing I only made half the recipe.

part 1 of 2 reviews: I mixed up corn starch and flour and added the garlic powderr and Italian seasoning to that. I dipped the cold cheese into this mixture and let stand at room temp while I did the rest of them. once I finished I added the rest of the flour mix to the breadcrumbs and mixed well with a fork. I dipped my cheese sticks into the egg then rolled in the crumb mix. These look like restaurant or boxed cheese sticks at this point! I double dipped only some of these but they took to it well. Also for folks that have crumbs leftover just pour into a mesh strainer and sift the big chunks out and only toss that part. Now you can put the "cleaned" crumbs into a freezer safe container-don't forget to label and date. 
I will post again after I cook them.

Flavor was excellent, but even with chilling it stayed too thin to work as a good dip.

Only OK.  I made this and a different honey mustard dip for the pretzels and very few people liked this one. Nothing special in my opinion.
