I make homemade peanut butter all the time and NEVER use oil.  If you let your food processor run long enough, the natural oils are released and it gets very creamy.

2 Tablespoons of oil is not enough.  Here is what we did:  2 cups peanuts, 3 Tablespoons oil, and 2 Tablespoons of water.  It was still chunky but the kids liked it.  Actually, the kids made it!

I just made the homemade peanut butter and is was so easy and taste awesome!! I made a couple of changes 1. I used canola oil and 2. I added a tablespoon of honey. I put everything in the blender an let it go. It looks as creamy and smooth as store bought and taste so much better. I used no salt roasted peanuts and it was still so good.

I posted this recipe & wanted to clear some things up. I have heard from numerous sources NEVER to add oil...that the nuts have enough natural oils. I now use  the Magic Bullet. Unfortunately I went through 8 blenders/food processors b/c the motor burns out after running for a given amt of time. So cannot let it run long enough to turn peanuts into smooth PB. I still use this recipe on a weekly basis (im a huge PB fan) and stand by it. I now use 1 jar Planters Honey Rst and 1 jar of Planters 5 Alarm (spicy) and everyone still loves it. 
Does anyone have a recommendation for an affordable food processor (Vitamix is out of my price range and too big) whose motor will not burn out after 2 or 3 min of use? Also like compact appliances b/c live in apt w/ limited counter space.

I tried this recipie, followed it to the letter, unfortunately it was dry and pasty, I let my processer run for a very long time but it was not getting any better. I decided to add 100 grams of butter and some maple syrup to sweeten and it turned out ok.
I would definately not make this recipie again, one star without modifying the recipe, after modifications two stars, I will however, keep trying different varieties until I get it right :-)

This was very easy to make in my Vitamix. I had some unsalted roasted peanuts I had on hand so I used them. I didn't add oil and am glad I didn't. I recommend trying peanuts on their own before adding the oil. My peanuts gave off enough oil on their own that the addition would have made it too oily.

I don't eat peanut butter so I didn't want to buy a jar. I made a 6 oz. batch in the small jar of my Ninja Master Pro to use in a recipe. It really sticks to the top of your mouth but my husband, grandson and I like the taste. But I will still only make it in very small batches in my cooking. 4 stars because I still don't like peanut butter.

I did not think this was good at all. Maybe I did something wrong. I followed recipe as directed and it had a horrible taste. Sorry, will not be making this again.

This turned out ok but might be due to a recommendation to add syrup. That was a bad mistake as it bound into a ball of what looked like peanut butter fudge. Taste was good but had to add additional oil then water to break it back down.  Wish I would a stuck with the original so I could have given a rating based on the actual recipe. Also after adding syrup I seen smoke come from my unit when I turned it off from what I suspect was from the syrup sugars causing it to over thicken
