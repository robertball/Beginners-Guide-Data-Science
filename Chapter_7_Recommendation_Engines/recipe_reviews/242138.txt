Very nice!  I used quick cooking oats rather than instant, and that worked very well.  For me the syrup was an interesting change because I usually do add a touch of brown sugar.  I was thinking that maybe just a dash of salt for the quick cooking oats could have heightened the flavor.  It does thicken as it stands for a few minutes, but we (my granddaughter and I) do prefer the thicker version.  She will be trying it in the morning, and if needed I will update this review.  Thanks, Deborah J Bell!

This is now my favorite breakfast!  I use frozen blueberries and cook it an additional 30 seconds.

I made with quick oats and on stove top it was absolutely delicious. I did use 1/4 c blueberries and cooked everything together then drizzled the syrup on at the end. This was so delicious I had it for breakfast and my night snack. Thanks for the recipe.
