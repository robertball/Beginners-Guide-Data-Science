I have tried several different recipes for Chocolate Pecan Pie (my husband's favorite!!).  This is by far the best recipe out there!  The change I made to the recipe is I beat the eggs. Put a bit of the hot chocolate mixture in a separte bowl and whisk the eggs into the bowl of chocolate to prevent the eggs from cooking (the "scramble" effect), pour the remaining hot chocolate mixture into the bowl of chocolate/egg mixture, whisking constantly, until throughly mixed. Then I will add the vanilla and salt and pecans.  I probably use more that 1 cup of pecans.

An absentee guest sent this pie to our home for Thanksgiving dinner.  I was too busy and too full to try the dessert and, when cleaning up the kitchen, I decided to pack up the few leftovers and send it back home with her husband (I was trying to save space in the fridge).  When my other guests learned that I had returned the remaining pie, they were sooooo disappointed, saying it was the best pie they had ever eaten and I was crazy to have given it up.  When I tried the pie a day later, I have to admit that it was fantastic.  I should let you know that she mistakenly used 1 cup of butter (instead of only 1/2) and I don't know if that error added even more to its "fantasticness".  I can't wait to make this myself!
update: I made this last night and made the terrible error of adding the eggs to the hot chocolate mixture and taking my time before mixing it all together.  What happened?  Some of the eggs cooked, resulting in chunks of scrambled eggs in the pie!  Gross!!!  I picked out the chunks of egg, ruining the look of the pie, but it still tasted fine.  How does this pie taste hot out of the oven?  Ugh.  How does it taste after a night of chilling in the refrigerator?  Deeelish.

This was my first time eating a chocolate pecan pie.  While the pie was very good, I prefer the original pecan pie.  It was a quick and easy dessert, though, and my kids enjoyed it.  If you aren't really, really into a chocolatey taste, then I'd suggest cutting back on the cocoa powder a bit.  It wasn't an overpowering taste, I just felt the pecan pie taste was lost in it.

Edited to add:  I just pulled this out of the fridge to try it again, and it was SO much better after it was chilled for a few hours.  The middle became a lot more creamy and smooth, almost a hot fudge consistency.  I will make this again but make sure it's been well chilled before serving.

This is excellent pie. I normally find pecan pie (and any chocolate varieties) far too sweet for more than a sliver, but this recipe makes a delicious chocolate pecan pie. The filling has a gooey, fudgy consistency and tastes incredible. My husband (a chocoholic) said this is the best pecan pie he's had. I used 1 stick of butter instead of margarine and used a refrigerated ready-made pie crust. Simple and delicious!

This pie was extremly tasty and had  great flavor. I followed the recipe excatly how it said and it came out perfect. the center was gooey and the pecans added a nice crunch. I will be making this thousands of times more.
WARNING: this was extremly fatning and filling. if your watching your waist STAY AWAY.(but your tastebuds will thank you.)

You may think this sounds crazy, but try adding a little Bourbon Whiskey on top of the pecans prior to baking.  The alccohol potency will dissipate after baking, but adds just the right amount of flavour!

We liked this pie a lot. I wouldn't say it has a "hint" of chocolate though, it is very chocolately but not overwhelmingly sweet. I read some reviews and just couldn't believe some people expecting this pie to taste like a regular pecan pie, it is NOT a regular pecan pie , it is not supposed to taste like one. I used pecan halves instead of chopped ones. I heated up the mixture in MED/LO stirring constantly, it takes a little while but you'll know it is ready when the mixture thins, it will not thicken up like pudding and such things do. I let it cool for a while and then i put it in the refrigerator overnight. It might be kind of watery otherwise. Enjoy!

I’ve made this pie for various Thanksgivings and holiday parties and it is always a huge hit. I make a few small adjustments. I use butter rather than margarine and I add about 2-3 oz of chopped dark chocolate into the sugar, cocoa, corn syrup mix right before adding the eggs. I also add about 3 TBSP of good bourbon into the mix right before adding the pecans. I put a full cup of chopped pecans into the pie.   A few other suggestions: Use the best chocolate and cocoa powder you can get your hands on. I switched to Valrhona cocoa powder a while back and it makes all the difference in the world for recipes using cocoa powder. Temper the eggs before adding them. Quickly whisk a little of the hot chocolate/syrup mix into the eggs first then add the eggs to the remainder of your mix. Just dumping in the eggs will give you little bits of scrambled egg in your pie. This pie, especially if you add the bourbon, is best made a day ahead of time so the flavors have time to meld.   I really prefer this recipe using cocoa powder to those calling for chocolate chips. The flavor is so much richer with the cocoa powder! A staple in my holiday cookbook.

So delicious! I recommend using a deep dish pie crust b/c there is so much yummy filling. Also, I opted to use butter sticks instead of margarine. A very tasty spin on classic pecan pie. Many asked me for the recipe when I made this for a work function and even said they were not big fans of pecan pie, but loved this recipe.

Absolutely delicious. Everyone in my family was teasing that we got this pie from a fancy bakery!!! I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site and was very pleased with the results. It was very easy and very delicious!

yummmyyyyy! I used chopped pecans because it is easier to cut through... no other changes.  But beware if you are looking for a jelly filled middle, like your used to with pecan pie, this ain't it. It's somewhere between that a brownie like substance. My husband gripped about that but I loved it! I'm very untraditional/ traditional.... If that make any sence ...he's just traditional. My 3 boys killed it in under an hour :)

What did I do wrong? The taste gets a 5, but my pie was more like soup! I am an experienced baker and followed recipe exactly except I used a very dark cocoa powder and I baked the pie an additional 15 mintues because I could tell it was not setting up. I could not really call it a pie. It really was a mess. Again, the flavor was there, but I would not make again without major revisions. Perhpas adding some flour?

A rich, chocolately, crunchy concoction!  If you like to eat a lot, it's impossible with this pie.... each bite is scrumptious!  I initially split the pie into 6 pieces, however, my friends and I could only eat half of our pieces, so I re-sliced into (what would have been 12 slices) halves.  It's very, very rich, and very good.   A+   Thanks for the recipe!  -- I made this again, only using 3 eggs (as thats all I had), and 1/3 cup of half-n-half with everything else, and the filling was much tastier as well as being a lot more 'creamy'.  I recommend using only 3 eggs and in place, use 1/3 cup of half-n-half of the other egg.  It makes the filling much better.

Exactly what you'd expect. I used a deep dish crust and it NEVER cooked all the way through the middle. Even after chilling, it was the consistency of hot fudge in the center. I recommend a regular-sized pie crust (even if it takes 2) to ensure thorough cooking.

Oh yeah, this definitely hit the spot, Ruth.  Thanks for sharing this, we all enjoyed it very much.  I'm making it again for our Thanksgiving dessert but we're going to use walnuts instead (I used up all my pecans!).  UPDATE: Walnuts don't work well with this recipe, my mistake.  They're too heavy and the textures don't compliment one another.  Stick with pecans, and if you're out - wait until you can buy more.  This recipe is awesome as is.

This pie is easy to make.  I took the suggestions of others and used a deep dish pie crust instead of a regular crust.  There is a lot of filling, so the deep dish crust works better.

This pie is AMAZING. Only alteration is to add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the stove top ingredients - have made it several times for family and all agree that it really results in a richer chocolate taste.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this pie the reviews all over the place. I read about "hot fudge filling" and runny centers, to just a hint of chocolate. Make no mistake this is a simple pecan pie with extra layer of flavor. My pie turn out with that perfect pecan pie consistency, a little gooey with the gelatinousness filling studded with nuts. In other words it was not runny or "fudgey" in the least. However like others I used a deep dish pie plate, so I increased the cooking time by about 15-20 minutes- I waited for the center of the pie to rise like the edges before I removed it from the oven. As for the taste, brother could not quite figure out what that extra layer of flavor was- was it coffee? What is that? I told him it was a chocolate pecan pie, and he ahhh yeah, that's it.    Anyway, it is delicious and it was well appreciated at Thanksgiving. I made this night before and is a five star recipe- but only after a day or so in the fridge. Therefore I highly recommend making this pie at least a day or two ahead of time and letting it sit in the chill box for a while. It seems this pie only gets better with time.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome!  The description says it has a "hint" of chocolate but I thought it was very chocolatey which I loved.  I poured half of the chopped pecans in the batter as the recipe says and then followed the picture and put whole pecans in a circle on top of the pie starting from the outer edge and going in to the middle.  It looked and tasted wonderful.

this was by far the best pecan pie I've ever had - not to mention the first one I've ever made!  Usually pecan pie is so sickenly sweet that you can't eat more than one bite, I keep snacking on the leftovers throughout the day and even for breakfast (shhh!).  Substitute butter for margarine - the real deal always tastes better, and better for you.

I have always made a pecan pie as one of my Thanksgiving desserts. I tried this recipe out about 3 years ago, and now my family and extended family do not consider Thanksgiving complete without at least 2 of these waiting! Of course, if we visit their homes for Thanksgiving, this is all they want us to bring along. They all seem to rush through the dinner just to get to these scrumptious pies :)

This pie was unbelievably good!  If you like gooey chocolate and pecans, you will love it.  I made a few changes though.  I used half a bag (6oz) semisweet chips and melted it all together.  I used some of the chocolate to temper the eggs before adding them to the pot.  I like a lot of nuts, so I used a cup of chopped pecans.  This ended up filling TWO Marie Callendar's frozen crusts.  I decorated the top of both with a few whole pecans and they were beautiful!  Definitely making this one every Thanksgiving.

This is very delicious! I took some others' advice and made the following changes: used 3 eggs and 1/2 c. half & half, I ran out of cocoa powder and used only about an 1/8th c of cocoa powder and 2 oz of semi sweet baking squares. I had enough to make a pie and 12 mini tartlets using cupcake liners in a cupcake pan. The mini tarts are great to take to work/bake sale, etc.

I followed this recipe to the letter with great results.. after reading other reviews I was careful adding the egg... I let the coco mixture cool a bit and added the first 1/2 cup of pecans to the coco before adding the egg. No problems with the eggs cooking in the hot liquid. Also let it cool completely and then placed in the fridge overnight before serving. Came out perfect, enjoyed by everyone. Many thanks to chef Ruth,

Delicious!  I have to say I didn't follow the recipe totally, though.  I only had dark corn syrup, and I only used 3/4 cups.  I used chocolate chips instead of cocoa and I used a LOT.  I had to cook it longer than stated, but it was delicious!  This pie has a lot of sugar/corn syrup in proportion to the amount of pecans, though!

Really good! I followed suggestions and used a deep dish pie plate- it was just the right size. I also wisked the eggs and poured the warm ingredients into the eggs- no issues with scrambling.
Hubby loved it. Only thing I would change is that I think it needs more pecans in the filling. Thanks! Will definitely make again!

This is fabulous!
I used a deep dish 9" pan and no overflow, puffed up really high and sank down when cooled like it should.
Really fudgy and delicious, I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar to make it fudgier and 2 tsps of vanilla with a dash of cinnamon, great with vanilla ice cream!

This pie was awesome and the hit of Christmas! My husband dislikes traditional pecan pie, because he thinks its too sweet. However, this pie won him over. This is a fudgy pecan pie - that I will definitely make again. However, if you are particularly fond of traditional pecan pie, this is NOT a replacement, it is just an addition to my pie repetoir.

Very good taste!! It tastes more like a chocolate dish than it does Pecan Pie, which was fine with me since I am a chocohaulic, however if you really want a pecan taste this may not be for you. Mine didn't set up in the center even though I cooked it for 55 min. but aside from that it was a dreamy dish.

The cocoa gave this pie a flavor that was outstanding.  It was of pecan pie consistency with a totally different flavor that left you wanting more.  Undescribably rich.

I made this according to the recipe except I tempered the eggs, and I only had three eggs so that's what I used. It was really good, everybody liked it. It had more of a pudding consistency than pecan pie gooey consistency. I used a large throw away pie tin and it was just the right amount.

My husband and I both loved it. A little of my eggs cooked even though I tried to avoid that problem. I strained out the little that cooked. It baked perfectly. I will make another one tomorrow to take with me to a family gathering for thanksgiving along with other goodies. Hopefully I will solve my egg problem by letting them get to room temp first. I will also re-read what others did to avoid the problem.

I, like many other allrecipe.com enthusiasts, don't like to read how someone changed the recipe only to give it a lower rating. I did, however, make changes because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine (I never use margarine), dark cocoa instead of regular (I love dark chocolate), and dark Karo® syrup instead of light (I had three bottles of dark Karo, no light). This pie is fabulous! I may never bake a regular pecan pie again. Instead of a sweet nutty flavor one gets from a regular pecan pie, this pie offers a rich, nutty chocolate flavor. You are sure to savor each bite! Thanks for the recipe!

SO SO good!  I add a little bourbon (half a shot, and GOOD BOURBON like Gentleman's Jack) before the pecans, and I probably added about half a cup extra pecans.  This also made 2 pies.  If you try to shove all this in one pie crust be prepared to clean your oven. I have been told by my husband, my kids, and my in laws that this MUST be on the table every Christmas.

My southern family loved this pie.  It was Fudgey and RICH...  One change was to not use all white sugar.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.    I'm told it's a new tradition....

EXCELLENT pie!!  It is almost like one that I got at a restaurant in McKinney, Texas.  I made it at Thanksgiving.  I don't know who ate more of it--my brother or our exchange student from Brazil!  I plan on making mini ones to sell at a Bake Sale!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first pecan pie I have made, and I found it very straightforward.  I used the "Pastry for Double Pie Crust" recipe on this site (only using 1/2 the dough) for the crust, adding a Tbsp of brown sugar to the crust. I was also worried about the eggs scrambling when added to the mixture, so I beat the eggs in a separate bowl and added the sugar mixture slowly to the eggs instead of the other way around. It turned out very creamy and delicious. I had to bake it for about 10 extra minutes to help firm up the center. I will be saving this one for Thanksgiving this year!

wow, amazing. Just had to add an extra tablespoon of cocoa (I like it rich) and 3/4 cup of sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet. This is one of the best desserts I have ever made and it was gone in 5 minutes. Great, solid recipe!

All I can say is this is a 5 star plus pie , everyone of my guests wanted the recipe and seconds. I do believe this will make two  9 inch pies , a little thinner but won't overflow. Fabulous just fabulous for sure a sweet lovers delight.

Delicious! I used butter instead of margarine and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I have made this several times and it tastes great with dark corn syrup as well (I was out of light). This is quick, easy, and really good.

I used a 9" glass pie plate and this was the perfect amount of filling. I used butter instead of margarine. Very nice chocolate flavor, not too overpowering at all. I baked it for 1 hour and it was done nicely.

I enjoyed it. I didn't pour about a cup of the batter in, fearing (as others had said) that it was too much. In hindsight I think it needed the whole amount, because after it cooled, it sunk down and was only about an inch thick. Other than that, quick, easy, and very tasty.

Oh yeah - you really need to alter the recipe to say that the batter should be cooled before adding eggs, or to temper them......

Thanks!

This pie is crazy good!  Bring this to a potluck and yours will be the first one gone.  I agree - use a deep dish crust.

I make multiple pies for every holiday dinner and this is by far the new favorite! Everyone absolutely loved it and raved about how delicious it was. It is definitely chocolatey, not a lot of traditional pecan pie flavors other than the actual pecans. Also, I used butter instead of margarine. My one complaint would be that my pie fell in the center, so it didn't look as pretty as I would have liked.

Fabulous pie recipe.  I made two 9 inch regular pies with this recipe. I probably used a cup of chopped pecans in the filling and then filled each pie top with pecan halves.  I brought one to work and it got rave reviews and my husband and I taste tested (a.k.a. ate the whole thing) the other the day before.  Thanks!

Fantastic! Great chocolate flavor and sweet but not tooooo sweet. Followed this recipes as written (using the advice from the "Most helpful positive review" by "Gramma Kelly" to avoid the "scrambled eggs effect"). I'm not a baker by any stretch of the imagination. I made this pie the first Thanksgiving I got married, and my husband has asked me to make it every Thanksgiving since...9 years and counting.

The flavor was good the consistency wasn't great.  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust. It didn't overflow, but it was puffed up when I pulled it out of the oven at 55 minutes. It was too fudgy/gooey even after chilled in the fridge overnight. If I make this again, I'd try others suggestions and maybe cook a little longer.

delicious recipe. I lowered the sugar a tad just because. My family loved it, including my little kids! it's very rich though, so it tasted better the day after Thanksgiving when we weren't as full.

I've made this pie SEVERAL times, and it is a winner! Last year, I even won $100 in a contest at my husband's place of employment! The only problem I have is that no matter how long I leave it in the oven, it usually sinks in the middle!

I made this for Thanksgiving.  We were so curious we dug into it the night before and even the nut-haters in my family loved it! It was gone by Friday, so I made another this week.  Everyone I served this to loved it. Only change was I used unsalted butter instead of margarine. This is an excellent pie that I will be making many many more times.

If I could, I would give this recipe 9.5 million stars. It was that good. The one thing that I will try to fix next time, although I'm not sure how, is that when I added the eggs to the hot mixture, they cooked! I strained it and got most out, but next time (which is now, actually) I'll let it cool a bit first. One extra thing I did was when I added the pecans on the top, I also sprinkled with chocolate chips (because it wasn't chocolately enough :-) ) and it was just BEAUTIFUL!!!

I made this pie the other day and let it sit in the fridge overnight and it was  HUGE success!  I normally don't care for regular pecan pie because it's just too rich and sweet for me.  The cocoa helps cut that a bit and it just melts in your mouth.  Will definitely make this again!

This is a winner!  Made this for Thanksgiving and did an encore for Christmas.  My wife loved it and so did the kids.  The same kids who all looked at pecan pie and said, "whatever" and then thought it was the greatest pie they'd ever eaten once they bit into it.

I had another choc pecan at the in-laws over Christmas and it wasn't nearly as good as this.  I think using the Hershey's cocoa powder was the difference.  It's just high quality chocolate.

I love pecan pie and I love chocolate so I thought this would be the best dessert ever.  However, I found I didn't care for it as much as plain pecan pie.  My brother-in-law who counts on me bringing pecan pie to all the holdays, agreed.
The filling is reminicent of raw brownie batter.  The taste is rich and fairly good, but the texture is not quite right, a bit grainy.
It was fun to try but I think I'll stick with plain pecan pie in the future.

Perfect combination of pecans and chocolate. Very rich, very decadent, very good! The gooeyness of a brownie the butteriness of pecan pie (I use real butter NOT margarine)!

This is so good!  You need to serve it with whipped topping because it's so rich.  My favorite pie!

I was really excited about this but it didn't seem to have the right consistency. It might have been my fault, though. I'm not the best with pies.

it was the first time making a pecan pie and I loved it and so did my hubby:)  btw my hubby is a big pecan pie fan.  the only thing I did different is add more pecan cuz the hubby told me too but it overflowed so maybe next time we wont put as much in and on it.

This was the best pecan pie I've ever eaten!!!  I added a little more chocolate chips than the recipe suggested but other than that I followed it exactly.  I took this to a potluck lunch and it was all gone!

It wasn't quite chocolate(y) enough for us so I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa (I used the Hershey's cocoa that is half regular & half Dutch Processed)  & put mini chocolate chips in the bottom of the crust.  The family went crazy over it.  In my opinion, the added extras made it a 5+ star pie.  It just became one of our favorites.

This was really good.  I read the reviews and added additional pecans and reduced the corn syrup to 3/4 cups since several reviews said it was running.  It was very good this way but I think next time I'll add the full cup of corn syrup along with the extra pecans.  should be perfect then.

Everyone loved this recipe.  It was so easy to make and the compliments kept coming.  I used 1 cup chopped pecans in the pie and used 1/2 c whole pecans for the topping.  Make sure this pie is refrigerated for the best taste.

My husband is the chocolate pecan lover and he said this was great.  It's very sweet and rich.  I'm the regular pecan pie lover and I missed the regular filling.  It could have had more filling and a few less chocolate chips.  But it will stay on our list for best pies.

Excellent! This is the first pie I ever made so I was a little nervous how it would turn out, but everyone loved it. I made one for work and one for Thanksgiving and several asked for the recipie! The only down side is you have to cook longer than stated (mine was a lot longer) But overal, great & will make again for many years to come!!

Different- turns into a whole new pie.  Doesn't taste like Pecan anymore.  Not sure I will do it again.  It tasted good if you want a fudge cake.

I've made this pie twice now, and my husband just loves it. I added all the pecans at once, and because I didn't really want a chocolate pie, halved the cocoa.  Just the right hint of chocolate flavor and color.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I've made pecan pies before that no one touched (and not because I'm a bad cook) but this one had a glowing reception at Thanksgiving and it was requested again for Christmas Day. When I made it with cocoa powder, the chocolate settled to the bottom half of the filling, which was interesting but not intended. Using bittersweet chocolate instead (1/2 cup) solved that.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Only changes I made were to use real butter plus another cup of pecans, 1 seemed too skimpy. I also used xtra dark cocoa and while the flavor was good, it was toooo black, next time I'll use the regular. Thank you, Ruth for this recipe, I SO prefer the flavor of cocoa over chocolate chips.

Yumm!  Mine totally rose out of the crust and fell over.  But it was still delish.  I used bittersweet chocolate instead of cocoa powder.  Don't know if that was the culprit or not.  Don't care.  I had to exercise restraint to not just give everyone a fork and just eat the whole thing together right out of the pan.

Everyone loved this pie, it was very rich and delicious.  I did have a little trouble tempering the eggs (I had never done that before) and had to spoon out a little bit of cooked egg, but it still turned out looking great!  Will definately make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of my traditional pecan pie and it was wonderfully different! You can't really compare it to pecan pie at all. Very fudgy and very rich and very delicious! Everyone loved it...some loved it more than regular pecan pie! Try it!

So rich and delicious!  I followed the recipe except I mixed in about 1 cup of chopped pecans to make the pie a little deeper, then topped with 1/2 cup of pecan halves. It received rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner this year!

I'm not really a pecan pie fan, but even I liked this and my family LOVED it at Thanksgiving. I left the pecans whole and sprinkled 1/2 cup of chocolate chips along with the top pecan layer for extra chocolatey flavor. I suggest prebaking the crust for a few minutes, because the liquid filling seeped in and made the bottom soggy.  I will make this again!

TEMPER YOUR EGGS!!! Or you will have scrambled eggs in your pie mixture!!  This is a really great rich pie, especially when served with real whipped cream!

I chose this recipe from 3 other recipes that I've narrowed my choices down to.  One word: Heavenly! It was the first pie to go at Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it, and it was so quick and easy to make. One thing though: The recipe is too much for a regular pie crust. Next time I will go with a deep dish crust, although I did enjoy "cleaning" out the saucepan, lol!

After reading the reviews, I used a deep dish piecrust, for which there was just enough filling. However, it took longer to bake, as the center was still runny. Loved the chocolate in the pie.

This pie was the hit of Thanksgiving. Everyone loved the way the chocolate did not overpower the pecans. One thing though, DO NOT put an airbake pan underneath to catch spill-overs. It made my second pie not get done inside.But. it taste so good that everyone still loved it though!

I made this yesterday as my first attempt on pecan pie,  OMG it is soooo yummy!!!!  The only change I made is that I used butter instead of margarine.  It was wonderful after being chilled for a few hours, but after being chilled all night it was amazing! Definately will make this one again.

Very good!  This recipe is great because it allows you to get that fudge pecan pie flavor (which I LOVE) without the heaviness of a fudgy pie; it's still fairly light, like pecan pie. I was a bit confused about the pecan size. The recipe says chopped, but so many photos show pecan halves. I roughly chopped pecan halves (so each one was about 1/3 to 1/2 its whole size), and that worked great -- large enough to be identifiable, but small enough to allow the pie to be cut and eaten easily.

Wonderful!  I had to use chocolate chips as I didn't have cocoa and the pie was delicious. Baked beautifully in the high altitude here in the Denver area (just allowed another 10 min. to bake). Everyone loved the pie!

I've made this a few times now and added a few tweaks, and everyone says it is one of the best pies they've had. I've started baking them and giving them as gifts! First off, use 1 stick of real butter instead of margarine. Also, I've been subbing half the white sugar with dark brown sugar, cutting back to 3 eggs and adding  1/3 cup heavy whipping cream. I like it with a full cup of chopped pecans in the pie and then garnishing with additional halves on top before popping into the oven. Two most important things: you HAVE to temper the eggs to get the correct consistency, and you need a deep dish pie crust.  (I prefer Marie Calendar's.) This pie is also much better if you make it a day in advance, but it may require threats to get everyone to leave it alone for 24 hours! :) Thanks for the great recipe!

So delicious! I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with my family! My sister even said it tasted like a boston market pie. I did everything exactly as called for except for slowly adding the egg mixture to the hot chocolate so it doesnt cook.

I should have read the reviews first regarding the eggs, and tried those suggestions first. As it is, I strained out the cooked egg pieces.  Don't know if the missing egg will make a difference.

Chocolate pecan pie is the favourite dessert of one of my closest friends. If he sees it on a menu, he always orders it. I made this for him, and he said it's one of the best he has ever tasted. This never fails to impress at dinner parties or potlucks. And another great thing - it's very easy to make (but they don't need to know that!)

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for my family and in-laws for Thanksgiving, and we were almost licking the plate.  However, this only gets four stars because the crust underneath the pie was very soggy.  I used a frozen Pillsbury crust; next time I may bake the crust first.

This is one of the best pecan pie recipes out there!  I followed it to a tee and it turned out just wonderfully! This was our Thanksgiving pie along with a pumpkin and there were no leftovers of this pie.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thank you for sharing it Ruth!

My new favorite chocolate pecan pie recipe!!  WE LOVED THIS PIE!  My only regret is that I didn't make two.  One just wasn't enough for my family of five.  I agree with others, allow this pie to cool and set to truly enjoy its greatness!

This is the best tasting chocolate pecan pie recipe I have made.  I would suggest whisking the sugar/cocoa/butter mixture over medium/low heat until it reaches close to a boil. This thickens the mixture so it is not so soupy.  Then temper your eggs by adding a little of the mixture to the beaten eggs until you feel comfortable that the eggs aren't going to "cook" when you pour them into the mixture. Be sure to let the mixture cool a bit also.  I added 2 cups of chopped pecans and made two regular pies (used store bought pie crusts) with this. I'll definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was absolutely scrumptious!  Fudgy as described, and believe it or not, not too sweet!  I used a graham cracker crust which, along with the pecans; gave a crunch texture that complimented the smooth filling perfectly.  Yayyyy!!!  and thanks to submitter, a holiday tradition for my family from now on!  (NOTE:  I agree with the reviewer who suggested cooling filling down before adding eggs!!)

I made this pie for my father's birthday. It was my first attempt at a pie, and this recipe was the winner because it was so simple. The results were amazing! I have to say not only was it a great first try, but it was probably the best pie I have ever eaten.

I loved this.  I love chocolate though.  My parents didn't care for it.  I made it for Thanksgiving.  They'd prefer traditional.  Make it for people who like different.

What a great recipe! I really enjoy cooking however baking is something I never really work at except chocolate chip cookies. However, lately I have been making more dessert recipes. Baking can been more challenging since it requires exact measurements. I feel that this is a forgiving recipe in that sense and great for a beginner baker.

This pie was easy to make and looked beautiful when it was done, but it tasted like nothing.  It had really no flavor -- maybe a slight chocolate flavor, but it was just bland and dull.  Even my husband mentioned it.  Guess next year I'll stick to regular (non-chocolate) pecan pie.

Fabulous. I used egg beaters in place of 2 eggs.  I let is bake for a few minutes too long and it was a bit brown on the top but delicious! I was a little worried when the pie 'poofed' way up and then fell as it cooled but all was good and my guests LOVED the pie.  I'm making it again for our Christmas Eve dessert.

Seriously, THE BEST PECAN PIE EVER! Soooo good, and I followed the advice on how to keep the eggs from scrambling. SO SO SO SO SO GOOD! I chilled over night and it was a total hit, I will be making it again for Christmas. My only advice is making more than one of these because trust me, it will go fast!

Delicious and sinfuly decadent! This pie was a little slice of heaven. Chocolate is the perfect addition to pecan pie. It was rich and chocolaty but not too sweet. Perfect! I will be making this pie on holidays from now on! I did add an additional 2T of cocoa as I love chocolate, and it tasted perfect to me. Thanks Ruth!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it recieved rave reviews! The only thing I will do different, is cook it just a little longer next time. The center was less firm than I would have liked... otherwise, an amazing pie!

Delicious - my 8 year old loved it and he is super picky. I did almost lose it to oven overflow though - even in a deep dish. For my oven, I think I may lower to 325 and bake longer. Must let sit in fridge overnight. Excellent w/some vanilla bean ice cream!

I waited about 15 - 20 minutes before adding the eggs to the cocoa mixture so I wouldn't get the scrambled eggs effect. Wonderful pie. Will be making again.

Outstanding recipe! Great twist to the typical pecan pie. I brought this pie to an auction at my church and everyone went crazy over it. I did add extra pecans to the reicpe, probably 1 cup to the pie itself, and put a cup of chopped pecans on top. Will definitely make again.

There was just WAY too much corn syrup in this.  After cooling for several hours the result was an oily, gooey mess.  The pecans did taste good, but I would consider reducing the amount of corn syrup.  That stuff is so bad for you.

This was astounding! I never had a chocolate pecan pie before, and this one was spectacular! It has a taste a little like fudge, while it also tastes a little like plain pecan pie... but who wants the plain version with this gooey pie?

This pie was problematic!  It took more like three hours to bake, though that could be the fault of my non-convection oven.  It was cloyingly sweet and the texture was slightly gelatinous.  I recommend the non-corn syrup pecan pie on this site.

Okay, but not the best.  I would recommend Belguim chocolate chips to make the filline.  Powdered cocoa is not the greatest ingredient.

This was very good.  Quiet dense and the pecan flavor was still predominate.  It had a fudgy texture which was different than I expected but good.  It kind of like a rich brownie with loads of pecans in a crust.  I initially gave this 4 stars but am changing it to 5 because the pie seems to get better after a day or two!

All of my guests gave this one five stars. I would definitely use a deep dish pie crust next time, though. I had a little bit of filling leftover with a regular crust.

This was a little too thick and gooey to really enjoy. It was too sweet and overpowering.

I thought the pie was excellent, but it didn't go over as well with my company.  Although, I loved it, I'm giving it a 4 just because others havent been to impressed with it.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again, for sure!
