Great drink - and yes it does get the job done!  I added a little pineapple juice.  I would recommend this if you're having a bad day and want to forget all about it.

This drink recipe was a good base, but we did make some changes.  At first we made the drink as stated, but felt that it was too strong.  We cut the vodka by half and increased the juice.

This is a good drink, but not for the faint of heart.  It is very strong. I may cut back on the vodka next time.

It's okay.  It is like a screwdriver with a little bit of an apricot flavor.  There are other tropical drinks I prefer.

This is pretty good, it's pretty strong though.

Really what I needed to take the edge off today. I found the amount of vodka was perfect for me because I always usually double it anyway. Great drink to enjoy on such a sunny day! NOTE: I did use Absolut Citron. Made it even better, I think.

i liked this drink. i made a variation on it where i used peach flavored vodka and orange pineapple juice. it turned out really well!
