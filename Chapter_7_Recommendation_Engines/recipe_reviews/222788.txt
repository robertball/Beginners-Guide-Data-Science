Very simple, easy and yummy. I made this as directed on the recipe and liked it very much but because I was making it for breakfast I decided to drizzle some maple syrup on it and eat it with a fork rather than as a sandwich. Another thing I tried and liked very much was using the Dark Chocolate Indulgence spread (by Kraft Philadelphia) instead of the chocolate chips. It is great either way.
