My husband is Mennonite and he was always on my case to make these cookies, but I was apprehensive b/c the thought of adding ammonia to my baking made me cringe. I finally broke down this Christmas and tried out this recipe and he says that these are just like he remembers them! The ammonia will stink up your kitchen while you are making them, but the odour disappears quickly and you can't taste it in the cookies.

Having married into a Mennonite family... I have already tried two other recipes for these cookies. This is by far the easiest one, and in my opinion has the best texture of the three recipes. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, although I made MINOR changes just based on personal preference:                                                 
(1) I reduced the baking ammonia to 1 tbsp
(2) I increased the peppermint oil to 3/4 tsp.
(3) Use parchment paper instead of greasing the sheets.
(4) Because my oven runs warm, and these aren't nearly as good if even slightly overbaked, I baked them at 350 degrees for 11 minutes.
Tips: these should ideally only have a light brown bottom, and very little or no brown around the edges, or they will be overbaked.
Also, the BEST way to eat these is out of the freezer. The fluffy texture and coolness from the freezer, in combination with the peppermint flavour is amazing.

This tasted like shortbread with peppermint oil.  Hartshorn (bakers ammonia-no it's not poisonous...was the first question my husband asked) is a bit difficult to find in Riverside, CA but I found some stuff on Amazon with crazy shipping costs.  You can substitute a mixture of baking soda and baking powder instead (like 2 tablespoons baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda for this recipe - that includes the baking powder listed in the recipe).  The peppermint oil was a bit too strong for me but on my second try; 2 tsp peppermint extract worked just fine.

Growing up, our Mennonite neighbour used to make these. A few years ago I phoned her for the recipe.  The one she gave me is identical to this one except for the baking powder, which she didn't use. I followed another reviewer and cut ammonia to 1TBS and added a half TBS baking powder to flour.   Delicious. 
Dunk hot cookies upside down in a glaze made of: icing sugar, cream and peppermint extract,  then let cool on cookie racks.

I can get ammonia at a European deli as well as a European bakery.

I had purchased baker's ammonia to make Springerle cookies at Christmas.  These cookies are amazing, light, fluffy and wonderful peppermint flavor.  They would be great as a sandwich cookie with chocolate frosting between the cookies.. As another reviewer mentioned, don't over bake them, even by a little. If you have prime membership on Amazon, you can get the baker's ammonia with free shipping. The ammonia smell just about knocked me over when I put it in the boiling water but there is no ammonia flavor in the cookie. Thanks for a really fun and unusual cookie.
