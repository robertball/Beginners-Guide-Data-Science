This is a great recipe. It tastes really good, and it's a little healthier than regular cinnamon rolls.

These have become a staple in my household so I thought it was time to add a review.  They are delicious.  The oatmeal bread is excellent for cinnamon rolls.  I generally use half whole wheat flour and double the recipe.  Once I have shaped the rolls I freeze half of them for another day - I remove them from the freezer, keep them on the counter for 30 or 45 minutes, then bake according to the recipe instructions.

This is the only cinnamon roll recipe that I use. Except I use a buttercream frosting because we like gobs of it. Very good.

Homemade cinnamon rolls are truly the best and worth the time in the kitchen but stay away from the Oatmeal Dough. YUK! Use a potato dough, or sour cream dough (or even just a plain dinner roll dough). The oatmeal added too much texture (like using whole wheat) for a tender roll dough and ruined the rolls.
