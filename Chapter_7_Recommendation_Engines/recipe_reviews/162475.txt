Fabulous recipe! I followed it almost exactly, with just a few changes for health purposes, and it was great. Nutrition info for this is very high in sodium, fat, and cholesterol, but I use reduced sodium chicken bouillon and light coconut milk, as well as Smart Balance as opposed to butter. Easy ways to make this soup healthier without cutting out on taste. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

I made this soup using the peanut butter sparingly because of a review. For our tastes I'm glad I did. Even cutting it by half was too strong for us. So next time I will add the peanut butter by tablespoonfuls at a time, tasting after each addition. Otherwise, it is a good full flavored soup. A little goes a long way and is good with toasted buttered bread points. I feel it's more for a Thai starter dish before the actual main meal because of the richness. The soup takes on a much better flavor after sitting for a few hours. Makes all the difference. Update: After making this a few times now, I only use 1/2 can coconut milk. (We just like the flavor better.) Another update: I've noticed some brands of peanut butter are milder than others, thus taking more.

This was really nice, velvety smooth with a strong curry and peanut flavor. I increased the recipe by 50% to feed the starving Byrdboys. It didn't turn out as thick or sweet as I wanted, so I added a little sugar and some cornstarch mixed with coconut milk near the end. Garnished with peanuts & chopped cilatro. Mixed leftovers with cooked chopped chicken - awesome. Thanks Jennifer!

I had chosen this recipe because of the good ratings but was not pleased. I followed directions completely and it didn't turn out like the Thai restaurant. It tasted too much like peanut butter. My whole family disliked it and we ended up pouring it out.

Amazing recipe we make it frequently in the winter and sometimes even in the Texas summer heat too. I put the onion and the celery in the blender to chop it extra fine before cooking it on the butter so in the end I don't need the blender for the ready soup. Found it more convenient and it gives a good texture to the soup too. Thank you for sharing it.

This soup is freaking amazing.  I am single and live alone, up in the mountains, and I love to make soup.  This is a great one, and it freezes very well also.

I never review recipes and I am not a huge fan of soups.... but I absolutely LOVE this soup! I tweak the recipe by adding a store bought roasted chicken cubed and I really like the peanut butter flavor so I use a little extra and sustitue chunky PB. I don't put it in the blender I like it chunky! Thanks Jennifer!

A very good recipe, especially if you are craving something a little bit different.  Made a few tweaks to give it some extra Thai zing.  Added some cilantro, 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and cooked rice noodles.  The end result was very delicious!

This was delicious!  I wasn't sure which kind of curry powder to us, so I used 1 tablespoon of hot and 1 of sweet and it balanced the flavors nicely.  Don't forget the handful of chopped peanuts for garnish - it was a really nice addition!

I made this today and I really liked it. I did not have curry powder but had Red curry paste ( 1 tablespoon) and that was great. It is rich and so good, added the peanuts on top, just a little  chopped green onion and a little chopped cilantro!

Excellent!!!

We're vegan, so I replaced the butter with soy margarine and used vegetable stock.  I also added a few Middle Eastern spices, as with just the curry powder and red pepper it was still quite bland.

Made this for a Thai themed party and it went over smashingly.  I skipped the pepper and used mild curry.  Lite coconut, reduced sodium broth and reduced fat peanut butter but everyone love it.  I double the recipt and got about 9-10 cups out of it.  Fab...def making again.

This is wonderful !!! I used small pieces of cubed chicken (which I browned of course). I also garnished with green onions. It's heavenly!

Apparently we just do not like this kind of soup.  We eat alot of different kinds of foods (culturally), and the only one who liked it was my husband - and there are six of us.

Best soup ever.  I never write reviews, but this is worth it.  I've made it exactly as is and also customized it by adding carrots, cubed potatoes (at same time as celery) and I always add tiny pieces of broccoli at the end to keep that crisp.  I'm sure one can add other ingredients to customize it.  It's our favorite.  Thanks for the recipe.
