I did not measure the hot sauce in this dish--I just added a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. I did not add the nutmeg (my husband does not care for it) and I doubled the mozzerella cheese on the top. I did take Chef John's suggestion and bake this in a bigger dish--I spread it in a 8x8 glass square baking dish. I served this with crusty garlic bread and tortilla chips for the boys and celery/carrot "chips" for me. This dip literally lasted less than 20 minutes. Everyone loved it, especially my husband who swore up and down he dosen't like spinach-artichoke dip. This is some good eats!

I did love this, but to me it barely made 5 stars because following the recipe exactly leads to a "dip" that is just not creamy enough. I hate all store-bought jarred Alfredo sauces, almost anything involving mayo, and don't like too much of a sour cream flavor. Because this recipe eliminated those, it sounded like the perfect option. However, I cheated and added about 1/4 cup sour cream because it was just too thick. It was absolutely perfect that way (still very thick), but only if you don't plan on using chips to dip (they would break easily). I spooned the dip onto toasted baguette slices and it was awesome. I highly recommend serving it in a crock pot on low or warm heat to keep it continually warm, because as soon as it isn't piping hot, it loses its awesome texture and flare. I served it in a casserole dish, which was nice in order to get a nice brown top in the oven, but next time I'm going to try a crock pot to keep it toasty.

I made this recipe as written and it was a bit too fatty for me.  The second time, I replaced the Gruyere and Mozzarella by using 1 cup fat free Chobani plain yogurt.  For the cream cheese, I used fat free too.  I also excluded the butter.  It made it much lighter as only the Parmesan had fat in it.

Excellent! I used swiss instead of gruyere, and a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach, but I kept the rest of the ingredients the same, even the pinch of nutmeg. Used the microwave, melted the butter and onion and garlic for 2 min in a 2 qt casserole dish, threw in torn fresh spinach until wilted. Mixed in rest of the ingredients and microwaved 3 min more. Stirred and microwaved 4-5 min more until all melted together. I have a high powered microwave so it didnt take long. It came out excellent and was melted and gooey. Taste was mmmmwwwwaaa!

Really great dip. I added a quarter of a cup of sour cream for creaminess and a small can of Ortega fire roasted green chilies (everything here in the SW gets green chili added). The taste and texture was amazing.

This recipe was awesome, and pretty easy for an inexperienced cook!  I did what the other reviews said - i could not find the cheeses in the grocery store so I just used Swiss (instead of Gruyere), parmesan, and mozzarella as well as I added 1/2 a cup of sour cream and the texture was great, perfect for dipping.  I also skipped out on the nutmeg as I was not sure if I would want the flavour and it ended up perfectly!

I tried this recipe as written (splurged for the cheeses and everything) and I wasn't really impressed.  It was a fancy "spread" but not really a "dip".  I thought there was too much spinach and artichokes for the amount it made.  I would probably double the recipe and keep the amount of spinach and artichokes the same.  It was not creamy/liquidy enough for me so you couldn't really dip the tortilla chips in it, which is the way my husband and I like it.  The gruyere has a really smoky and distinct taste.  It added a lot of flavor, but was just a bit over-powering for me.  I was really attracted to the recipe because it doesn't use mayo, which I can't stand.  So, overall I'm disappointed.  I'll try to add something to make it more dip-like if I make it again.

I have become a Chef John fan!  I don't like spinach-artichoke dip, but I made this for a friend's party and even I liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the dish was licked-clean by the end of the night.

I wanted to try this recipe because it seemed so simple, and because it was far healthier than others I've seen.  I am so glad I did. It was amazing. You don't need heavy cream, sour cream or mayonnaise  for this dip to taste delicious. When I make it again, I want to find a was to thin to out just a little. It was very thick.  I also wondered about adding sliced mushrooms or sliced olives to it. This is a flexible recipe. I highly recommend it.

4.5 stars.  I wish it was creamier but it was because of my cheese selection.  I used leftover blue and havarti dill instead of Gruyere.  Even still, this is my new artichoke dip recipe.

AWESOME!  Made quite a bit, so I froze the leftovers in another small dish with mozzerella cheese on top, popped it right into the in the oven at about 325 with foil covering for about 40 min and then took off the foil and cooked for an additional 15 min

I made this tonight for my gathering.  OM!G  By far the best spinach/artichoke 'dip' (spread) ever!!  I love that it was as promised:  not greasy.  I'm allergic to egg, so it's especially nice that there is no mayo called for in this spread.   And I didn't miss the sour cream *at all*.  I wanted a spread for tonight, not a dip, so the consistency was perfect.  I wasn't sure how much salt to add so I was light-handed b/c of the parmesan cheese.  Next time I'll add at least a half tsp.  The hot sauce was a nice (subtle) 'kick' (really made it).    This recipe made three mini hot dip casserole dishes.  Two are in the freezer for subsequent Christmas get togethers.  Thank you, John!

I messed up this recipe up and my guests still loved it. I messed up and used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic - duh - but I was able to fix it by adding some fresh tomato after it came out of the oven. The tomato made the dip just a little lighter and less salty. I'm going to make this again - and will follow the instructions exactly - and I'm sure my guests will still love it.  (Umm, I served it with tortilla chips and perhaps that's where I was getting some of the excess salt taste.)

This stuff is delicious! I got all the compliments at the party. Couldn't find Guyere at the store so i had to settle for swiss. Still good though, and I'm making it again for an upcoming New Years party! Four stars for ingredient availability. It took me forever to gather all the things, and it's pretty pricey compared to other cheaper (but less awesome) options.

Loved this recipe without the sour cream and mayonnaise! I substituted mozzarella for the gruyere because I am not that fancy but otherwise it was delicious. My new favorite spinach and artichoke dip recipe!

I am making this today and am sure it will be great (like everything else of Chef John's that I have made).  However, I have read and re-read the directions.  I am assuming that once the artichoke mixing is complete, THEN, you add the onion garlic mix?  That is what I will do, but the directions probably should be amended to say that.   thanks!

I made this tonight for New Year’s Eve.  It tasted great but was very dry.  Couldn’t dip out without breaking the chips.  We had to use a knife to spread on them.  I will probably make again but try figure out a way to thin it down some.

This dip was very good.  The only ingredient I didn't use was the nutmeg.  I didn't know how that would taste and didn't want to risk it.  Also, I did not add any salt as all the cheeses had enough.  Lastly after cooking the green onion and garlic, I put everything in a crockpot.  Everyone thought it was amazing.

Outrageous! My guests commented “this could be the meal”. I added a can of chopped roasted Ortega chilies. I may add some chopped water chestnuts next time just to add a bit of crunch. This is a fantastic recipe!

We loved this dip. We combined it with tube pizza dough cutout in the shape of a tree for our holiday party. It was absolutely delicious!  It was a crowd pleaser. We will absolutely make again.

very good but it is necessary to cut away back on the cheese unless you like clogged arteries. also not necessary to have so many kinds of cheese

I love this recipe! It's lower calorie content makes it even more enjoyabl! My husband loves spinach and artichoke dip, and he is very picky, this recipe went over very well! I did add a half a cup of greek yogurt, since Chef John's video said he would probably go back and add some sour cream, it turned out beautifully :D

Here is the super fast version: Use dehydrated onion instead of sliced green onions & use garlic powder instead of fresh minced garlic. I know it is not as good as using the fresh ingredients, but I ran out of time & we all still LOVED it! I used all of the cheeses per the recipe & was going to add the sour cream like others suggested but I forgot in my haste.  Now I will just have to make it again to use my green onions, garlic, the rest of the cheese & the sour cream.

This was very good, better than what I've eaten in the restaurants.  I could not find the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese so I just got the fanciest Parmisan mix I could find in the cheese section.  I would agree that it is a little too solid for my chips, so I did like another reviewer and added 1/4 cup of sour cream, which liquified it just enough with no real taste difference.  I kept it in the crock pot so it would not solidify, and to keep warm.  It was fantastic!

Not a favorite. I think it was the cream cheese that made the texture unpleasant. You'd think cream cheese would add to the creaminess, but it almost gave it a gritty texture and I didn't like the cream cheese flavor. I liked the Gruyere but I think it needs other types of cheese instead of the cream cheese. I'm going to try and find an older recipe I liked better. Won't make this again.

This is tasty, but a bit chunky.  The combination was thick and didn’t cook down into a creamy mixture.  If you have something like pita chips or toasted french bread it would work better. 

I have made the conventional version, with mayo, and liked the creaminess of it.

Easy to make excellent soup. Good as is. I usually double the recipe to make a large pot cause family loves it. I do add an apple or a small cup of apple sauce to it to add even more depth of flavor

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and this was excellent.  Splurging on the various cheeses was worth it.  My only change was to follow other reviewers and add a bit of sour cream (maybe a 1/4 cup).  I think it made it just slightly creamier, but this is definitely meant to be a spread, not a dip for chips.  I served with baguette slices.

I adore Chef John and among others-this one's a keeper...recipe I mean ;-).I kept it pretty much the same but only used a half brick of Cream Cheese,cut the butter in half and no Nutmeg or hot sauce.I mixed in 1/2 c. Mozzarella and topped with 1/2 more.Baked for 20 min. and I was thrilled with the results.I only have a portable oven so no broiler but OMG-thank you Chef.Love it!

Excellent dip!  I prefer to bake it, but if oven space is scarce you can use a crock pot.  I’ve made it this way twice and it came out great.  Set to high it was ready in about 45 minutes, I made sure to stir about halfway through, and wait to add mozzarella until the last 15 minutes.  Just remember to heat down to warm or off once heated thoroughly as it will dry out even with the lid on.

Great dip but it was so dry  it lost a lot of its flavor when using baguette slices. I love Chef John and his recipes. I followed this one to the T and it came out just like the video but my wife and I thought it was much to dry. I added some 1/2 and 1/2 the next day making it a moister, (NOT SOUPY) and cheesier. WOW, it was now a 5 star recipe with all the flavors  more intense. Adjust the amount of 1/2 and 1/2 to your preference.

Chef johns recipes are always great! I’ve made this a few times, using what I’ve had on hand, smoked gruyere cheese really add a nice flavor, and I’ve also used chipotle gravy out of the can in place of the hot sauce (I used a table spoon or two instead) and that’s an amazing flavor too. I don’t do those at the same time, but I like each variation. If chef John made it you know it’s good:) always a winner, thanks again!

Excellent! No Gruyere so added provolone with parmesan/reg. Also chopped up some water chestnuts (gotta have em).  It was a huge hit although I wish the pita chips had been softer.  Thank you, Chef John! Have a blessed day .

I've always loved spinach and artichoke dip but every time I make it it's always very oily this one is not oily at all it is very cheesy and gooey.  I  X out green onion and mix in Fontina and gruyere cheese it was truly wonderful gooey gooey gooey like I said and I use fresh spinach and cooked it and squeeze the heck out of it myself I think one of the most important things about this recipe is to be sure to squeeze the spinach aggressively and I cannot stress the word agressive enough and I absolutely love the nutmeg in there I actually added a little extra but you really can't taste it but you know it's there love it love it love it

Brought this to a party last night and everyone loved it!  3 changes:  finely minced onion instead of green onion, mozzarella instead of gruyere, and I added 1 cup of sour cream.  Great flavor and consistency!

I followed the recipe exactly. This is the ABSOLUTE BEST spinach artichoke dip I have ever eaten! I don't have ramekins so I baked it in my glass bread pan. Came out perfectly! The Gruyere cheese is a bit pricey but SO worth it! I made this for my husband over the weekend and decided to try a bite. I'm on a calorie restriction to lose weight (28 lbs so far!) and with that one bite I realized I wasn't following the plan the rest of the afternoon. My husband and I ate 3/4 of the pan that day.  It was amazing on tortilla chips, carrots, celery, and right off a spoon! I will make this again and again and again.  Of coarse I knew it would be great, Chef John NEVER makes anything bad!!!

I've made this five times and it is, by far, the best spin/art dip I've ever tasted--in a restaurant or out. It's hard to find a recipe that doesn't use mayo--which disgusts me-or sour cream-ditto. It's all just super cheesy greatness. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Great combination of cheeses. I softened the cream cheese and dice the gruyere because I could only find a block at the store. After mixing all the ingredients together, I decided I wanted more cheese than veggies. I added an extra 4 oz of parmesan and gruyere. Hated to do it, but I also needed the sour cream for fluffiness. I sprinkled mozzarella lightly over the top after having mixed half in with everything else. I don't like the stringiness off mozzarella once it has all baked together, so I did this to avoid pulling it all off the top on the first dip. Overall the flavor was delicious!

This version of hot artichoke and spinach dip was favorful without being greasy. I served it with toasted bread rounds. I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic. I read several  reviews which said it was too thick, so I added little mayo. I thinly sliced a baguette and put a little olive oil and red pepper flakes then baked it for a couple minutes. Delicious.

Made it according to directions for New Year’s (1st time). Either I used too much of an ingredient (?) or it was a little thicker and not as creamy as we would have liked. I didn’t have hot sauce (maybe the lack of liquid?),  so I subbed a dry hot pepper-type seasoning. and noticed it was hard to stir together. Just seemed it was lacking something. But no fear! I will try 
again  ;-) and maybe add a spoonful of cream before baking.

I made a few substations to this recipe but it turned out great so I thought I would share. I did not have Gruyere cheese so I added some sour cream. It was definitely cheesy enough even without all of the cheese. I did not have mozzarella cheese so I topped it with a blend of cheddar and Monterrey Jack. Turned out fantastic! I would add some Cajun seasoning next time.

Perfect recipe as is! But this is one of those dishes that is fun to mix up. In my most recent version I swapped out some of the cheeses and used mozzarella, Parmesan, and pepper jack! I also added half of one red bell pepper diced, just for some more color. It's also nice to experiment with spice. Sometimes hot sauce, sometimes cayenne pepper, jalapeños, red pepper flakes, you name it! And I doubled he spinach! Most of my friends/family like a thick, hearty dip! Make it as is and then have fun!

I took this to a party and had many compliments! It was the only emptied dish on the buffet. I would like it to be a little moister and will add some sour cream next time. I used 
Emmental instead of Guyere.

We followed the directions precisely.  Flavor is very good, but this was so thick that it certainly isn't a dip, and is almost not a spread.  We had to use spoons to glop it onto toasted baguette slices.  Spinach artichoke dip recipes are so plentiful, we'll use a different one in the future.  Sorry, Chef John: we love so many others of your recipes.

Doubled the recipe and it was gone in no time. I made two substitutions. Firstly, I didn't have gruyere on hand so substituted with New Zealand Cheddar and wanted to used up some fresh spinach so steamed it with a little salt and garlic instead of frozen spinach.  Amazing flavor!

Agree with the other reviews that said there wasn't enough cheese to the amount of spinach and artichoke. I doubled the cream cheese and shredded cheeses that were mixed in, and it came out perfect! I think the extra cream cheese helped make it a light and fluffy dip, not too heavy! I used whole artichoke hearts (canned) and pulsed them in the food processor as I don't like large chunks of artichoke.  Delicious!

The taste of this dip is great but the consistency was off. I followed other reviewers advice and added some plain greek yogurt while mixing everything together. I used swiss instead of gruyere because it's what I had. After baking I gave it a taste. Good but too thick. I added some sour cream and stirred it all together and heated in the microwave. Still very thick but great taste.

Great recipe! So delicious. After reading the comments, I added a couple dollops of sour cream to the mix to make it more of a dip-like consistency. It worked! I didnt have the guyere or mozzarella so I added a cup or two of a four-cheese blend (with Parmesan, asiago). Crowd-pleaser!

If you made this and did not add all the ingredients, and then decided it was only ok, you need to add ALL the ingredients. The nutmeg and hot sauce really do add another layer of flavor. This is a keeper!

The BEST Spinach Artichoke Dip I have ever had. Chef John's approach to reducing the "greasy" factor creates a really flavorful dip.

An outstanding recipe. My wife and daughter do not like spinach and artichoke dip. They reluctantly tried this one, and loved it. Serve it with baguette, tortilla chips, or any other sturdy snack item. It lives up to the Chef's promise.

This was just OK--I was disappointed after I read all the reviews and the ratings.  I have another spinach dip that I will continue making instead of this one.

Loved this one. I use to make another kind but I found this one better and I liked the fact that it didn't have mayo. I did add 1/2 cup sour cream. 
Will make this my permanent dip.

The only change is i doubled the recipe which made a lot. I took it to a Thanksgiving party and it went over very well. 
Any leftovers heat up nicely in the microwave or oven.

Fantastic!  Made it exactly the first time for thanksgiving and it was great!  The next day I wanted more but didn't have all the ingredients, so had to leave out the artichokes and gruyère. Added some cottage cheese for creaminess and it was still delicious! Amazing recipe! Thank you!

Made recipe exactly as written. We loved it as we found it to be less oily than other spinach artichoke dips. If you prefer the large strings of melted cheese then this recipe is not for you.

I thoroughly enjoyed it...so did my friends and family. I didn't change anything. It was a little thick, just as some people stated, but that was such a minor thing...it didn'the affect the taste at all. If I choose to make it thinner (creamier) next time, I'll just use a little sour cream. Excellent!!!

I sauteed spinach first.
I used frozen artichokes the steam kind and cut after cooled.

Used a heavy porcelain dutch oven and transferred all there and baked.
Reserved little mozzarella cheese at the end and left lid off.

Tasted as good as some of restaurants we've been to.

I made this for Superbowl.  It was a big hit.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than using an 8x8 Pyrex baking dish.  I made it the evening before and baked the next day.  Everyone loved it.  As for the reviews about it not being "creamy" enough, the whole idea of this recipe is to be slightly more healthy.  I actually like it better than the run-of-the-mill spinach artichoke dip. Edit:  I had leftovers so I decided to try and freeze.  Froze fine.  I heated it in the microwave and it was delicious!

First time and I nailed it!  My family loved this recipe.  The only things I added was a bit of sour creme and instead of the hot sauce I threw in some red chili flakes.  I used two ramekins as Chef John suggested and they were wiped clean with the fresh baguette slices I put on the side.  Thank you, Chef John!

I actually had some fresh baby spinach I needed to use up so I wilted it and substituted it for the frozen spinach. I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it was delicious! A keeper for sure.

Excellent.. rave reviews. As I have a MSG intolerance I decided to make my own spinach dip to serve at my 60th birthday get together.  Well... the guest could not get enough, they loved that it was warm, they loved the blending of the cheeses, they loved dipping nacho chips and/or bread, they just loved it and so did I.  It will now be a must make for any gathering I have or go to.  Very easy to make.

A huge hit last night! My family loved it! The only change was to use Swiss instead of Gruyere because of cost. Otherwise excellent served with pita chips and multigrain tortilla scoops. Next time I may splurge and buy the gruyere. Thanks Chef John!
