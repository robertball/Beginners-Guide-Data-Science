Ok here are my suggestions: the custard filling is wayyy too much, so I would cut it down by 1/3 next time. Second, I used 3 granny smith apples, which was more than enough. For the crescent pastry, it is very simple. All you do, is unroll it carefully, and pinch all the seams of the triangles together, to restore the rectangular shape, without cuts in it. Then,placed the apple mixture down the center of the dough lengthwise. Cut a few slits perpendicular to the apples (horizontally in direction of the apples), and bring each band to the top of apples one by one to wrap the apples in a nice, almost lattice manner. Pinch sides well to avoid any overflow in the oven.
Also, to minimize cleanup, line your baking tray with parchemint paper, or foil, b4 putting the pastry on it. Tastes wonderfully delicious! Such an easy recipe, and the filling doesnt taste like cheese at all. It tastes more like the custard filling in a danish! Thanks for sharing!

This was FABULOUS!  Not only did it taste wonderful, it looked beautiful too!  The only change I made was to add a little bit more of the cinnamon sugar mixture in with the apples.  This will become a frequently made item in my household...thanks Heidi!

This was very easy, and it was very tasty too.  I had a hard time trying to figure out how to do the lattice work.  I couldn't figure out how to put the two rolls of crescent dough together - it doesn't say anything about rolling it out or anything.  Anyway, I used the cuts in the rolls themselves to criss-cross over the apples and cream cheese mixture.  I've done stuff like this in a wreath pattern using the same technique (Pampered chef recipes), but you lay out the crescent dough in a circle, then fold it over - I think that would be good too.  Also - I used more of the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the apples.

This was a huge hit!  The cream cheese filling firms right up after baking to make a nice filling (so don't be afraid of doing the whole amount).  I also prefer MORE apples (with much more of the sugar and cinnamon mixed in)- there is plenty of dough to cover the apple and cheese filling.  I also pre-cooked the apples for about 5 minutes in the microwave so they would be nice and soft in the pastry.  

Some tips on handling the crescent dough:

First of all make sure your dough is straight out of the fridge and is still cold while handling.  Use a LARGE cookie sheet or jelly roll pan so both cans of dough fit.  Lay them out side by side (longer end of rectangle together) and pinch all seams (or even just buy the new SEAMLESS crescent dough!!).  Before putting filling down the center, make cuts along the two longest sides about 3-4 inches long, and one inch wide.  Then assemble filling to your liking (I liked pouring the cream cheese first and spreading lightly to be even and then spooning the apples over the top of the cheese so the apples peek through the top).  To make a braid pattern- take each strip of dough, twist once and lay across the filling (it doesn't have to go all the way across, just past the middle).  Do this in an alternating pattern switching from one side to the next until the whole pastry is "braided".  

I hope these tips help!

This drove everyone crazy just smelling it cook - let alone eating it. I also put more than 1T of the cinnamin sugar mix on the apples - I put at least half and that still left plenty for the topping. Only problem I had was not getting my crescent seams pinched together enough. When I went to cross the 1" pieces, some broke. I also found 3 apples a little too much to easily cover. Maybe 2 to 2 1/2 would be better - depends on the size of the apples. It looked pretty brown after 35 minutes but it tasted perfect. Really great when it's still warm out of the oven.

This recipe turned out very nice.  Instead of using cresent roll dough, I used the butterhorn recipe from this site as the dough.  I let it chill overnight and then rolled the dough very thin on a cookie sheet.  It puffed up nicely and came out great!  I think next time I make this, I won't brush it with butter, I think I will just drizzle some carmel sauce over the top.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Fantastic dessert!!  Everybody raved over it at my family reunion.  

The only thing I changed was that I substituted canned apples for the fresh ones, and it was still delicious.

Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

This did not turn out well for me. There was to much filling and it was gooping out everywhere. No way to "braid" it with the filling oozing all over, so I finally wrestled it into a pocket of sorts. Wasn't impressed with the final product either. Tasted like apple cheesecake with a cresent roll crust. Leftovers had to be refrigerated and next day were a soggy mess that I ended up just throwing out.

Delicious!  The directions are not clear on the slicing and braiding.  I had trouble with that to start and realized after the first braid that the slits need to go just about all the way to the apples.  My apples (granny smith) were pretty small, so I thought I needed to use 4, which was too much.  I think 3 small apples would be the right amount.  Those saying 3 is too much may have been using big apples, in which case I agree that would be too much.  The apples were a little crunchy (they were chopped into very small pieces) so next time I will pre-cook them a little.  It was good the next day too, not a soggy mess as another reviewer reported.

This was so yummy!  The filling was simple but delicious, and using crescent rolls made it very easy.  It also had an impressive presentation since the criss-crossed dough over the top looked very pretty - I almost hated cutting it!  I made this and another dessert for a gathering and this was definitely the hit.  I'll be keeping this recipe in my favorites!  Thanks, Heidi!

Great recipe.  So good and so easy.  I also put more cinnamon/sugar mixture on the apples.  Plenty left for the topping.  2 large apples or 3 smaller ones is more than enough.  Thanks!

Turned out very well, my wife and I both loved it.  Next time we may go a bit lighter on the cream cheese mixture, but overall very good!

I made this as directed except one major change -I did not have crescent roll dough on hand, so I used a puff pastry sheet. It was super easy this way. I thought it turned out really good. Will definitely make again.

So, I made some changes:
I used two granny smiths and two fujis... I used two sheets of puff pastry, cut into eighths.  I spooned two tablespoons of apple chunks and two teaspoons of cream cheese goo onto one half and folded the other side into a little square... And then I had a little bit left over, so I baked it into a custard to spoon over some shortcakes.  
I made INSTANT friends at this barbeque with my sixteen cute little squares of goodness...

I made this last night, and it is an instant hit. I made half of the cream cheese and only one 8oz Pillsbury Crescent dough sheet, followed Mariam's review and had absolutely no problems. A Keeper. :) it was all gone before i could take a picture.

It wasn't pretty but tasted delicious! I had trouble working with the crescent dough, but it made a huge braid-style pastry.  Followed ingredients and directions pretty closely.  Glad I had lined the baking sheet with parchment as the filling oozed a litlle as it baked.  I made this because my son loves anything apple, & I used to make similar breakfast pastry rings with crescents and cherry pie filling-thought this looked good.  Will put in my special breakfasts file to make again!  It doesn't even need a glaze or frosting.

This is a wonderful recipe, and I highly recommend it.  I plan on making it Christmas Eve so we have a quick and delicious breakfast on Christmas morning!

When I make it again, however, I think I'll switch to a sweeter apple.  I found the Granny Smith to be too tart for this dessert.  With a sweeter apple, there would be less need for 1/4 cup of sugar sprinkled on top.  Or as the others have commented, maybe use more of that sugar mixture with the apples and less on top to sweeten up those Granny Smiths.  I like my idea better though - less sugar, same taste!

I also think the three apples I used were too much.  A cup measurement would be better here since apples come in sizes small to extra large (i.e., 2 cups of chopped apples (or however much), rather than three apples).  I used three large and it was too much.  

Overall I really like this recipe!!

I thought this was very delicious! Used Fat Free cream cheese. I did wish the apples had been a little softer but I will try to cook them a bit first before wrapping them up next time. Thanks!

Pretty good, although I think if I had used a different dough like one reviewer did it would have been 5 stars. I think I just get a little tired of the predictable taste of crescent roll dough. I did not find that there were too many apples or too much filling. I also think that I might have made the cheese filling a tad bit sweeter (and I do not like my treats overly sweet). It cooked up beautifully. My co-workers appreciated it. Thanks to all the people who clarified the braiding technique!

Just o.k. Nothing to make again. I agree with the other reviewer that there was too much oozey filling. As for the dough, store bought is better.  It sure didn't braid either. It was a mess after it baked, it oozed and came unbraided. Def. will NOT make again, sorry

I actually made this quite awhile ago. My daughter and I ate the whole thing by ourselves :) I will definately cut back a little on the custard next time but it was very good. It reminded me of an apple cheese danish. Very good!

i really liked this recipe and would make it again but i did cut back on the apples because i didn't care to put so many in. i think this would also work great with any other fruit filling as well and look forward to trying blueberries next time!

sorry, we didn't like this recipe: the directions on how to put the pastry were confusing, but I compromised producing a strudel of sort. The custard filling was cheesey, not like a Danish filling as I expected. All in all, nothing so special. I'm afraid I won't keep it.

Tried with cream cheese only.  I think it could be good with cherry pie filling.  Instead of cinnamon/sugar, I made a glaze with powdered sugar.

Made this for Easter Brunch with family and not a speck was left! Definite keeper. Only things I would do differently is more cinnamon with sugar that goes on top of chopped apples and  less sugar sprinkles on top.

This was awesome. Loved by my coworkers. She did ooze out a little when I was doing the braid but the filling baked up perfect without oozing out anymore. I felt the measurements were on point. The only change I made was using Honeycrisp apples because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again.

I made it as a dessert and let it cool down before serving. I think it would be better as a breakfast or brunch item served warm.

I did the recipe exactly how it is written! Wonderful and amazing, my husband couldn't stop complimenting me on it :-) I brought it to a coffee with our neighbors and it was a big hit. The cream cheese was a little runny so I made it first, put it in the fridge while I prepared the rest, (peeling and cutting up apples, etc.) I made sure my crescent roll seams were well sealed, poured the mixture over the apples as instructed but I did not cut the edges with scissors, I pulled up the ends and they separated enough to make a pretty braided look on the top and if it ran out the sides, I quickly pinched the dough shut with my fingers and it only happened in 2 spots, so it was not noticeable at all.   This will me a huge hit anywhere I go I am sure! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my daughter to take to a church social.  They all loved it and my daughter now wants the recipe and says it is definitely a keeper.  The Strudel looked amazing, so now I have to make one for the hubby and me;  forgot to take a pic of it :-(.  The only variations that I made from the recipe was I only used 2 medium sized (Granny Smith) apples and they were enough.  Also I used 3 Tbs of the sugar cinnamon mixture in my apples instead of 1 Tbs.  Another reviewer mentioned that her apples wasn't sweet enough and I could see where the extra sugar would be necessary.  The remaining sugar mix was more than enough to sprinkle on top.  The filling did ouse out quite a bit as it cooked so I took it out of the oven mid way of cooking and with a spatula scooped up the filling and spread back on the top of my strudel, didn't want any of the good stuff to go to waste.  It didn't take anything away from the final appearance of the strudel in fact it made kind of a glaze so I didn't need to brush on the butter.

Our family really enjoyed this.  I thought it was fairly simple to put together.  I laid out all of the crescent dough and pushed together the seams.  My 5 yr old daughter had fun helping me.  I didn't read the recipe well enough and mixed all of the apples with the entire amount of sugar/cinnamon mixture, so I just sprinkled a little extra on top afterward.  Some of us had it with ice cream, others without.  Thanks!

Directions on how to lace the pastry was not given well...I had a miserable time trying to figure out how to make it all stay in the cresent roll layout. My end result was definitely not as eye pleasing as the picture.
