Made this for Recipe Group...FANTASTIC! I have a recipe that I just love, but this is definitely gonna replace it, as it was even better than that one, and it took a lot less time to make too! I used Wondra flour in place of the regular flour b/c it blends easier, (I used a tablespoon or 2 more than called for). I did not have any thyme on hand, b/c I'm not a fan of it, so I omitted that. After the soup was done, I added a little more salt (personal preference) and some browning seasoning to make it a richer color. I toasted my bread on both sides and rubbed it w/ garlic before putting it on top of the soup. I am so glad I decided to make this today...it was a hit w/ all of us and my new go-to onion soup recipe~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is the best French Onion Soup we have ever had!!   Wasn't sure of the size of onions, since it was not specified, I used 10 medium (four of them were sweet onions).  Used homemade beef broth and skipped the thyme.  Had some italian bread to use up,  topped it with mozzarella and provolone.  Turned out wonderful.  Served with a simple green salad and a fruit salad. Reheated leftovers for dinner today,  and we were all looking for more.  Thank you so much, Jenny, for sharing a definite keeper for us!!

Recipe Group Selection:  15, September 2012 ~ French Onion is my favorite soup, but I've never tried making it.  Thought this one was very good.  I had to cook my onions for about 45-50 minutes rather than the stated 30 minutes.  For the red wine, I used Pinot Noir and bought cooking sherry for the first time.  My husband, who didn't think he liked French Onion soup, ate 2 bowls.  He said his "taste buds must have changed".  We really liked this recipe, and I will make it again.  Thanks Jenny for sharing.

I used 6 large onions - 3 red and 3 yellow and omitted the wine because I used homemade beef stock with red wine as an ingredient.  The cooking times for the onions was longer - nearly 1 hour 15 minutes.  With onion soup, I think it is more important to pay attention to the onions than to monitor time (look for carmelization in the first stage, and boil off most of the liquid during the second stage).  I also omitted the flour because the stock did not require a thickening agent.  I used about 1/2 cup of sherry to deglaze  Very good, but I highly recommend making beef stock.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I used regular yellow onions and a dry (cheap)red wine and it turned out great.  I also used the cooking sherry but next time might leave that out OR buy a good sherry at the liquor store.  I agree with other reviews that the onions did need a little longer to cook than the recipe stated.

I pretty much just followed the recipe except I have never bought or used sherry so I made it without.  I made a pot roast to go with it and used some of the pot roast dripping to boost the broth in the soup but if I do this in the future I will try to get a really good broth to use.   This puts to shame all  versions of French onion soup I have had in cafes and restaurants that are basically some croutons and onion thrown in some overly salted broth.

Unfortunatly, we didn`t care for this soup. I didn`t like the red wine taste in this soup and together with the onion the taste was boring. I`ve used wine in soups before and liked ther result. Not sure I will try this soup again.

Very good!  However  the prep/cooking time is much longer than stated, at least for me.  It takes more than 30 minutes to "brown" the onions.  Maybe it was the type of onion?  I did the same thing with he bread and cheese: toasted in oven and melted cheese on bread, then placed on top of soup.  Also, didn't have thyme (couldn't believe that!!)

OMGosh! Better than even the restaurants French Onion soup! My family of picky eaters gave it a rating of 10! I am making another double batch because our friends want some also! I did double the recipe, cheap bottle of red wine, I added mushrooms and it is melt in your mouth a delicious piece of heaven! It did take longer to Carmalize the onions and I rubbed the bread with a garlic clove and had to use butter on the bread as I was out of olive oil and it turned out absolutely perfect! Best recipe ever! Thank you so much for sharing!!!?

Quote my very picky husband  "the best French Onion Soup I've ever had."  I followed the suggestion in another review and used half Beef Stock and half Beef Broth.  Besides this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!!!    The wine and sherry did take me quite a bit longer - maybe 30-40min - to cook down, but worth the wait.  All in all, this was an easy recipe.   The only downside is now I can no longer appreciate French Onion Soup in the fine restaurants (well, maybe that's not so bad :)

Made this for recipe group it took a little longer to make  than expected. my family loved it even my 9 yr old DD ate 2 bowls. My soup was a little on the sweet side but I think it was the wine I used was sweet, and I used Vidalia Onions. next time I will make sure I use reg. yellow onions and a different red wine.

Recipe Group selection of 9/16/12.  I made half a recipe as lunch for a friend and I.  I used large sweet onions so I used 3, which may have been too much.  Instead of dry thyme, I used 2 sprigs of fresh and removed them before serving.  I had some Gruyere so I used that on the topping in place of the Swiss and Provolone.  My kitchen smelled great and we both enjoyed our lunch (the rest of which was a green salad and the other half of the baguette.)  This is something I will remember for special occasions.  Thanks, Jenny!

this soup is very good, I cooked the onions for nearly an hour, on lower heat so they would not burn. I used some left over whole wheat bread and did not have provolone cheese and was too far from the store. I used plain havarti and a slice of mozza. Still tasted great. Very tasty, rich broth, we all enjoyed very much

This recipe turned out delicious!!!! Just as it says, “Restaurant-Style French Onion Soup”. My husband loves French onion soup and orders it frequently, he said it was better than the restaurant’s! My kids also loved it. Also, I enjoyed making this beautiful dish, can’t wait to make it again and again and again... You get the picture.

I used a little bit of stock instead of all broth because I’m very bold with flavor. Came out great.

This soup turned out brilliantly. The broth was perfect, rich, flavourful, not too salty. I didn't have red wine on hand so just used a good sipping sherry . . . I think this change will stick because the richness/sweetness complimented the caramelized onions incredibly well. I topped with toasted garlicky baguette croutons, and tons of smoked gruyere.  Delectable!!

Excellent soup.  It took 2 hours for my onions to finally caramelize.  I recommend using a mandolin to make quick work of slicing the onions.  The onions I used were around baseball sized.   When I sliced all 8 onions it seemed like there was going to be way too many.  But they cooked down and were the perfect amount.

I've made this once before and did today too.  I don't know why I didn't rate it before now, so here it goes.  I love this recipe and I love French onion soup, but I never tried to make it, until I found this recipe.  I used the same ingredients, just added more of all of them, tasting as I cooked, without measuring, it came out great!  I will definitely make this again and again as my family loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

We often joke about writing a guide to who makes the best French onion soups and this would be at the top of the list.  Add mushrooms to change it up a bit.

If you have plenty of time, this recipe is worth the effort.  Be sure to continually scrape up the fond on the bottom of the pan for the ultimate flavor.  I used boxed beef broth, and perhaps I would have liked it a little better if I had used my homemade broth.

Great recipe for French Onion Soup. Like other reviewers mentioned it took longer than 30 minutes to brown the onions, about 45 minutes.  We really enjoyed the finished product. Thanks for sharing.

OMG! I love spending time  preparing a  good meal. This recipe was the absolute best.and did not disappoint.Fun to make and absolutely  one one of the best onion soup recipes we have ever had had. Well worth the tears shed getting the onions sliced and  caramelized. This one is a winner.

Next time I will use the low sodium broth and not use quite as much red wine. Other than that it was great.

I could not find my tried and true onion soup recipe. I had some leftover red wine so decided to try it! I will make this again. My husband raved about it.

I've tried other French Onion Soup recipes, and so far this is the best! Cutting onions was the worst part, but I love how you can taste real onion on every bit.

Making it today for a second time, will freeze some for Christmas time.  I used gluten-free flour and beef broth to suit a frequent guest, and it was delicious.  I used swiss cheese and served small quanities in ramekins, just the right amount for before the main course.  Onions took longer to brown, as said by others.  Great recipe!

The thyme was overpowering. Not a spice I expect in really good onion soup, and that is most of what caused a four star rating. I transferred this soup to the electric pressure cooker, added Worcestershire sauce, and Soy Sauce, plus a bit more salt and "bang," Houston we have the real deal onion soup. Obviously I am in a minority here, it definitely is a great recipe whether it tripped my taste triggers or not!

I made a smaller batch and shortened some of the cooking times. The flour adds a creaminess to the broth. Substituted mozza for the provolone - it's what I had on hand. Added a bit of beef bouillon and cut back on salt. Used cooking sherry and a shiraz caberet leftover bottle of wine. All in all, one of the best french onion soups that I have had. Delicious.

There is no point in trying any other recipe for french onion soup!  I thought this was perfect.  I have never made french onion soup and was surprised at how easy and delicious it was.  I halved the recipe and used regular cooking wine, sherry, beef stock, and swiss cheese from my grocery store.  In other words, I didn't go fancy, but it still tasted gourmet to me!  Loved it!!

I think it could use a little less onions, I used 8 small onions and it was a little much, other then that I thought it was very good and quite simple to make. Would deffinitely do it again.

Recipe Group pick September 15, 2012: Loved this french onion soup recipe, hubby raved.  It's a little heavy on prep and cooking time, a special occassion soup, but very worthy.  I made as written with a little more sherry :).  I did cheat on the topper, I made them separately under the broiler and just popped on top and served a couple on the side.  Oh, and I did put a smear of pesto on the baguette slices then the cheese.  Yummy, thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

I added 1 tsp sugar, thought it tasted a little bitter. I also added 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce. Tasted better after those changes. I probably really should just have simmered longer before tasting.

I made this for my wife and daughter for lunch and we all loved it. Made it as written except I cooked down the onions a bit longer. Very easy recipe and was perfect for a winter lunch.
I will be making this again.

Holy cow this is good! I started with 5 pounds of giant sweet onions. I caramelized the onions for well over 30 minutes until they were golden brown. I substituted fresh thyme and a good Sauvignon Blanc (for the red wine). I used shredded gruyere and a slice of provolone over toasted homemade croutons in the soups crocks. This will be my new french onions soup recipe!

I made this for the first time pretty much as written from an ingredient standpoint.  It was delicious.  I wasn't sure what size or type of onion to get so I bought sweet onions, 6 in all as the sizes were med to large.  At first I thought it was too much but after things sweat down it was  a good ratio.

I wasn't in any hurry so I let the soup simmer and meld for probably 4 hours.  I wanted to add more flour early on, but I didn't as I knew it would be on the stove for awhile.  I am glad I didn't, each time I skimmed the top a bit  more thickness and scrapings off the pot mixed right in.

I was maybe a little heavy on the sherry, pepper and salt, but that is just me.   I made it ahead of tomorrow for Bowl Games, so like I said, no rush, if I were not letting things simmer that long, I might have added more flour and / or boiled a little harder.

I did use 1 quart each of  beef stock and beef broth.  We tend to lean to stock when cooking.

I added twice the amount of cheese, just because I feel like there is never enough cheese ever...  Broiled in a good old fashioned crock.  

I am not a huge cook and do not stray too far from a recipe for the first time...but with the additional simmering,  melding, and stirring time involved, this was really as good as I have had anywhere. Looking forward to tomorrows meal.

So delicious!  I didn't have sherry, so I omitted it and it was still wonderful.  The video helped because I would have cooked the onions too long waiting for them to darken, when you add the wine, they darken nicely during that simmer.  I will definitely make this again!

Oh My!  This recipe is delicious!  After making this I felt like a trained chef.  I used beef BONE broth instead of beef broth as I believe is has more flavor and know is has more nutrients.  Bone broth is available almost everywhere now.   Try this one!

So good, but exchanged the Swiss for a mix of Provolone,  mozzarella, and a little Parmigiana.   Will definitely make again.

I really liked this soup! It had lots of flavor and wasn't too hard or long to make. The reason why I did not give this recipe a five star was because I'm not totally into the cooked wine flavor, I feel like it was a bit too strong. Maybe that's just this kind of soup, I don't know, but I wasn't very fond of it.

Great rich soup! I used 4 vidalia onions and 1 red onion, some minced garlic, 32 oz beef broth, 1/2 cup red wine, then added 2 more cups from beef broth concentrate. The onions took almost an hour to get to the level of softness I prefer, but man was it worth the wait!  Fantastic recipe!

I just made this recipe! It's very good. We all tend to add,  subtract or substitute. When I try any new soup recipe I  never add salt until the end. So with this one, because I used salted butter I needed no additional salt. Same with the sugar, add it at the end after a taste test. Thank you. I'll make this recipe again!

We love this onion soup! I have made it several times. We like it so much I make a double batch every time. The only thing I change is that I add more onions than the recipe calls for. I recommend this to anyone who likes onion soup.

This soup is heavenly. It does make a pretty big pot of soup so we have sealed and frozen some for later as well. I found the soup to taste even better day two after it sat in the fridge overnight. Great recipe and so glad I found it!

This is the real thing :-) ...  I had chicken stock & beef stock leftovers in two big pods in the fridge while I read this recipe. Ooops, I though hell yeah let's use this great stock for it. I did not even have to add nay salt or thyme becuase that was already in the stock, I chose some  slices of Asiago cheese, slices of Gouda cheese and  topping it with a Swiss slice. The kicker was the diced Ham Hock peaces I sprinkled in between the cheese slices on top of the bread ... OMG it was the real deal ... GJ with the recipe Jenny :-)

Good, tasty, pretty much per the recipe with perhaps a big more sherry and little less red. Otherwise on target. Not special, not wow, but very good. Next time I'm changing the cheese to gruyere, which I 've seen when dining out.

This is seriously the best french onion soup ever!!! My family and I absolutely love french onion soup and we always order when out to dinner...well no longer because this is better then most restaurants. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe...my kids asked for me to make this at least once a month. I followed the recipe to a T except only using provolone cheese because I didn't have swiss. I used my dutch oven (if you follow it trust me you won't be disappointed)

Great starter recipe. Great instructions.... The soup was too runny as is, i recommed simmering a long time for reduction or use less broth.

I used low sodium broth, which I think was a mistake.  Skipped the wine.  Felt like it was missing a flavor, but not sure what.

I made this two nights ago, and it was one of the yummiest things I've ever made! I made few changes: (1) I omitted the bread (hubby's diabetic, and onions are high enough on the glycemic index!), (2) I only used 6 onions, as the ones I had were HUGE, and (3) I only used Swiss cheese cos that's what I had in the house. Do follow the directions, especially the one that says to cook after adding the wines til all the alcohol smell is gone. HOLY DELICIOUSNESS!!

The flavor of this soup is good. My onions did not get very caramelized or brown in the time given. The next day I used croutons instead of the French baguette and we liked that better.

This is a very good recipe.  I, personally, screwed it up by using Sweet Onions instead of Yellow Onions.  Also, should have used Dry Sherry instead of Cooking Sherry.  I bought my vittles on Sunday at which time we can't purchase alcohol in Tennessee.  
I'll make this again with the above changes. The family enjoyed it.

My family like this soup, but didn't love it. It didn't have a deep flavor. Next time I would add some better than bouillon beef flavor. Otherwise it was easy to make and pretty tasty.

Unfortunately I didn't have any sherry on hand so I just left it out. That was a mistake as the soup would have had more body to the flavour. Great recipe. I will definitely make it again and put the sherry in next time.

I also pan fried some rib eyes that were in the freezer, deglazed the pan with red wine, and put that all in the stock.  I let it simmer for about 3 hours, shredded the beef and put the beef at  the bottom of the bowl for a yummy surprise.

I made this as stated, but I love mushrooms so I diced some up and cooked them with the onions. I also added extra Swiss cheese. Otherwise I made no changes and it was delish!!!

Excellent!!!  A little time consuming but WORTH IT!!  I had to spoon off the liquid from the onions even after an hour to get them to brown but then added it back in with the beef broth.  Only used 1 quart of beef broth just because I like more onion ratio to broth.  Added the dash of worchestershire as some suggested.  Will make often I'm sure!

Only difference was I used Gruyere with the Swiss instead of provolone.

This is an excellent soup! On top of my soup I used a combination of provolone, mozzerella, swiss, and gruyere. I happened to have all of them on hand. I substituted apple juice for the wine and sparkling red grape juice for the cooking sherry, as mine was expired. These gave it a slightly sweet flavor. I would make this soup again any day!

This recipe is just absurdly good. There aren't enough words to describe how good it was.

I've made others and enjoyed them more,  this was slightly sweet.  Wine I used was a Shiraz, maybe better with a different wine.

This is better than the recipe I got from a French cook book. I used 4 Spanish Onions and 1 Sweet onion.  Next time I will used another Spanish one.

For a vegetarian version, instead of beef broth use 2 quarts water with 8 tsp (2.75 T)  "Better Than Bouillon" No Beef Base. Add 2 tsp Porcini mushroom powder and 1/2 tsp Marmite.

This is the best. I did not have any bread or cheese after cooking. I was going out the next the day. The onions melted in my mouth. Can't wait to try with french bread and cheese. Yum.

First ever shot at making FOS. Found this recipe easy and yummy! Used half beef stock and half onion stock and probably more garlic than was called for! A great comfort meal for a cold winter day!

Made this soup for my family and I ended up making too little of it. But I think for next time I would cut down on the onions because I had quite an excess of them. Also the cooking times are a little low and I had to cook a little longer for the right consistincy. But it was really nice and look forward to making it again soon.
