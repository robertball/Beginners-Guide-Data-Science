The recipe is basically the same as the Toll House recipe with half butter and half shortening.  For those that don't know - shortening allows these cookies to remain moist and chewy longer and not get too hard if baked a bit too long (like all-butter ones).  Good recipe - it's what I've started to do with most cookie recipes calling for all butter, if I wanted them to come out a bit chewier.

If follwed as written, this recipe is AWESOME! (I'm a little puzzled how people can change the recipe substantially by substituting ingredients, and expect the same quality in a recipe.  Butter and real eggs are what make it good! Duh.) I have tried just about every 5 star chocolate chip cookie recipe on this site and this one is still the best!!

If I could give this recipe one thousand stars, I would.  If you like bakery style, soft, pale, flat sinful cookies, then you better get ready.  Suggestions: cream butter, vanilla, and sugars very well (3-5 min), use all butter (so, two sticks ROOM TEMP) and no shortening, and watch them like she says and take them out before they brown.  My family had stars in their eyes while eating these!  You can also freeze some to pull out later if you don't have a lot of people to gobble them up.
BTW - people who said this cookie "wasn't soft"  try the recipe again and follow the directions to the T.  If you didn't get a soft cookie something went wrong..

Excellent recipe! I love to bake and cook.  I typically use the recipe found in my Betty Crocker cookbook. It's a decent recipe, but I wanted to find one that was better.  I have tried *so* many recipes.  I was always looking for an Entenmanns-tasting recipe.  This one comes so close, but who cares...it's close enough.  I'll never use another recipe. If you take them out just when the centers do not look "wet" anymore, they will be perfect.  Tip:  To keep them chewy, place them in a ziplock bag with a piece of bread.  Change the bread as it starts to become stale.

Since I last posted about these "WONDERFUL" cookies. I started making these on my day off Wed. so now the kids in the neighborhood will call and ask are we having cookies this week? I even added some white chocolate chips, and mini chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips in these together. It also says something about not doubling the recipe. Well I changed mine to 48 servings in which I think is 12 dozen. I cook them for about 10 mins. and they turn out really chewy and little crunchy. But it can be done because I make LOTS for the kids around here. Thanks so for the recipe...and the kids thank you also.

These were really, really good.  Be sure to watch them in the oven, or they won't turn out as soft.  But they are great either way!!  The salt does need to be increased to 1/2 tsp, though.  Otherwise, perfect!

These are wonderful.  These have definitely replaced my old regular recipe.  I think these are even easier to make.  The key is definitely to remove them from the oven before golden brown and let finish baking on cookie sheet.

I am not the best baker in the world and my biscuits never seem to work but I have my 4th batch in the oven now from trying this recipe for the first time. I do not agree that the cookies are not sweet enough, they are perfect. These are easy to make and I would sincerely recommend them.Most excellent

This recipe was exactly what I needed it to be. I was looking for a soft but sturdy chocolate chip cookie recipe to use for a stacked cookie cake, and this one fit the bill nicely. I successfully doubled the recipe with no problem. I used butter flavored shortening, and mini chocolate chips. Baked in 8" cake pans, stacked with icing and iced like a cake.

I make one change every time I make these and that's to use oil for the "shortening", but I only use about 1/8th cup and I just use more margarine/butter than it says. These are extremely soft cookies. I like the award winning soft cookie recipe on this site, but I find that this one has more of a "homey" taste, rather than a bakery taste, and I loooove homemade cookies taste, so it's good! I've also doubled, tripled, and quadrupled this recipe with no problems!

These are quite possibly the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made! The shortening helps the cookie stay soft and not flatten out. The butter gives it great flavor. I love that it's such a basic  and simple recipe. I used unsalted butter and increased the salt to 3/4 tsp. (I like my cookies a little saltier - makes them more addictive!). I chilled the dough before baking and scooped the cookies into high mounds to help them not flatten out. I also used a full 2 cups chocolate chips, saving the extra 1/2 cup chips to press on top of the cookies right after they came out of the oven. These are definitely soft and stay soft. I just ate one from the batch I made yesterday and yep, still soft and delicious! I'm so excited to have found my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies!

Let me start this off by saying that I'm aware that the perfect chocolate chip cookie is highly subjective. It's like asking what the best book ever written is. You'd ask 100 people and chances are, you'd get dozens of different answers. That said, this is as close to perfection as it comes, IMHO. Definitely soft, not crispy. Not overly chewy, either, so know that in advance if that's your preference. This recipe bakes up tender and moist, with just the right ratio of fat/sugar/flour/chips to make for a very satisfying experience. Even 3 days later, they were still soft and tasty. Not a whole lot more you could ask of a recipe than that. Plenty of chips, too, for our taste, but you might want even more if you're a chocolate fiend. It's also good to mix milk chocolate and semisweet. Use whatever you have on hand, or whatever you like. But whatever you do, make them. Your friends will be in awe of your undeniable baking prowess (but beware, you'll be expected to bring them to every gathering thereafter!) Edited 1/16/11 to add: Replaced all the white sugar with Splenda, and you could not tell any difference, either in taste or in texture. Appearance was slightly altered, in that they did not spread as much as when all sugar was used. I did use the full amount of brown sugar, so they weren't sugar-free. For a reduced sugar goodie, however, they were awesome!

Let me first say that I have always HATED chocolate chip cookies...until this recipe.
My boyfriend loves chocolate chip cookies and I wanted to make him some. I specifically wanted a soft cookie recipe and this is FABULOUS! They bake up nice and soft. We both dislike crunchiness in our cookies, so I bake them for 8 minutes (will vary depending on your oven). I also add a lil extra vanilla.
The flavor isn't overly sweet and the texture isn't dry/hard. It has the right balance of chocolate too. 
To keep them from drying out, I add a slice of bread to each tin/cookie jar. Change the bread when it dries out. You will have perfectly soft cookies for days. Well...if you don't eat them all first!

I changed it a little, but got AWSOME results!  I added 1 teaspoon of raspberry extract and made them with butter flavored shortening and milk chocolate chips. I also added another half cup of flour, because the dough was a little too creamy. I rolled them in a ball and lightly flattened the top and they came out perfectly round. I had to bake them a few more minutes as well. The aroma of the raspberry and chocolate filled the house. These cookies flew off the cooling rack and I only got to try one! Now my kids want me to make more!

Since my preference is for a crunchy cookie and Hubs prefers a soft cookie, these were a much bigger hit with him than me - that speaks well for this recipe because I will say they are indeed soft, yet still with crispy edges.  I wanted a cinnamon cookie and this recipe adapted itself well to that by adding 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dough and swapping out cinnamon chips for the chocolate chips.  Even after chilling the dough a good long while, it was still soft and the cookies spread more than I like.  That criticism is offset, however, by Hubs'remark that these were "Four stars, and darned near a five."

I followed this recipe exactly. In my opinion the recipe calls for too much shortening. I think that was the problem because I could taste the shortening in the cookies.

Great recipe. Like the other testers
said, follow the recipe to a "t".

I made this recipe with Kissables candy
bits and chopped Hershey bars. My
husband loved it.

I followed the recipe and mine turned out exactly as said...soft!  I had a problem with them browning in the oven.  I kept them in the max amount of time, but the still didn't start to brown around the edges, but still tasted pretty darn good anyway.  I will probably make this recipe again and increase the salt by 1/2 tsp. like recommened by someone.  They were quick and easy to make and baked nice and thick.  Yummy!!

I think I need my cookies to taste more buttery. And they didn't brown very well. Guess because of the shortening. I even baked them on a stone. That always browns them up nicely. They were chewy though. I like the Nestle Toll House recipe found on their 6 oz. bag. I just double that recipe but only use 1 stick of butter and bake at 350 for 9-13 minutes on the baking stone. Found this tip on their website for thick and chewy cookies. They really do stay soft too.

Just finished baking these cookies (followed the recipe exactly) -- they were pretty tasty straight out of the oven. I didn't think they were quite as delicious as some of the other reviewers, but they satisfied my sweet tooth. I might make them again, but I'll probably look for another recipe before I return to this one. These needed a little something extra -- nuts, maybe?

Very very good and past my kids' taste test. I forgot about the directions not to double the recipe and did so, and they baked up just fine. A keeper!

I have just started making cookies, and this is my second recipe.  I made Peanut butter ones first, then these.  I thought they were awesome!  I halved the recipe since it's just me and my hubby, and I used Butter flavored crisco instead of butter.  I ended up with 16 cookies.  I don't know why some people think they aren't sweet enough - I thought they were perfect.  I ate one before they were completely cooled, and wow, they were yummy.  My husband thinks I'm Betty Crocker or something... he has no idea how easy they were to make!  I can't wait to try another one.

These cookies are okay.  They are not as soft as I would like them to be.  I do not use this recipe anymore.  If you are looking for semi hard, but still moist cookies, this is a great recipe.

I really like using this recipe.  I follow it to the letter with two exceptions.. I use 2 tsp. vanilla because I like a stronger vanilla taste (personal preference) and I also add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  I use a strong cinnamon from a specialty spice store but when using regular store bought cinnamon, I would use 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.

I *nearly* followed the recipe exact!! Whoo ^_^ I used both shortening an butter, but less than a cup's worth total. That's the only mod. made. From the pic [[that I posted]] you may be able to tell the rather flattened cookies,,not plump. They weren't as soft as Ii was hoping for, ie like the Award Winning on this site, but they were a hit. I made them just a couple days in advance to take camping with us an had frozen them. Come time to leave, there were but 3 left in the ziploc O.o There are pigs here..but they know what they like!! So thank you

Excellent recipe.  I made these time, following the recipe exactly the first time.  With that recipe, you'll get soft, chewy but flat cookies.  If you keep the same amount of shortening but reduce the butter to 5 tbsp, you'll get plump, voluminous, chewy cookies.  I've been looking for a recipe to replace a beloved recipe that I've lost over time.  Someone said these are identical to the Entenmanns cookies- they LOOK identical but taste phenomenal.  Try the reduced butter version.  These are fantastic.

I tried this recipe this morning... It came out like bread.  I don't know why. Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe.  I'll try it again though since I see every body gives it 4 or 5 stars.

I made these cookies recently, and they came out ok.  The texture and appearance are good, but they don't have much flavor. I think it is because of the shortening in the recipe.

This recipe is so good!  They are soft and chewy, they remind me of Keebler Soft Batch.  All my neighbors loved them.  Definitely a keeper.  Just one thing I'll try next time is to use butter flavored shortening to get more buttery flavor.  Otherwise awesome!

These are AWESOME!!!*I'm only 12 years old and these are the BEST ever! My whole family loved them! My mom asked me "Where did you get this recipe from?" and I said "Allrecipes." She thought they were awesome! THese are the only chocolate ship cookie recipe I haved used ever since! I would concider using less butter for your health. Just put 3/4 cup butter and 2 tablespoons of oil for a healthy recipe! All in all perfect recipe!

Wonderful recipe! I used 3/4 cup of butter  (didn't have shortening) and it was fantastic. They did not spread too thin during baking. However, I used two different types of cookie sheets--one that is a normal flat plan with non-stick paper on it, and the other was a silpat silicon cookie sheet. The silpat batch came out thinner, but still delicious and totally soft and chewy. I'll definitely make these again!

OH MY GOSH! I will never make another cookie again!!!!  I have actually made another cookie from this website (involves instant pudding mix) and they turned out good but... This is the best cookie!  It is soft (I don't know about chewy - they didn't last long).  I am currently making the rest of the batch will taste tomorrow but they are great right after they have cooled from the oven yummy! Didn't have shortening so I made with 1 cup of butter and one cup of M&M's with 1/2 cup chocolate chips (add a little color for the kids).  I thought they were going to be to creamy too - but they turned out all right.  I did place the batter in the fridge for about an hour so that the dough was easier to work with - made it a bit more firm so measuring cookies was easier.  Made the first batch on my cooking stone had to add 2 more mins.  Second batch was on my reg. cookie sheet and I still baked for 12 mins.  Found it difficult to tell by looking if they were done.  I would advice a test run to determine the best time for your oven.  Also found that it yeilded 32 cookies if using a scoop that is a little over a tablespoon (special scoop).  Good luck!

Wow, these were great! I didn't have shortening so I just used 1 cup of butter and I made bars instead of cookies. It came out perfect. This recipe is definately a keeper.

These cookies tended to spread out quite a bit.  The edges were darker and crispy while the middle was much lighter in color.  They did taste good, though!  

I enjoy chocolate chip cookies that have more to sink your teeth into.  These were a bit flat, even after I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to stiffen up the batter a bit.

The best choc. chip cookie I've found on this site has been "Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies"  I won't keep this recipe (Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies II) in my file.

This recipe is fantastic. I made the regular chocolate chip recipe and then I tried replacing the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips and dried cranberries and it was terrific! My husband said they were better than subway cookies (that's where his white chocolate cranberry request came from).

These turned out pretty good! I followed a bit of advice from reviewers. Used 1/2 tsp salt, used room temp egg and butter, refrigerated dough a little while to form balls easier. These did spread quite a bit so make sure to leave plenty of room. Next time I will only put 9 per sheet. My batch made 38 or so. I pulled out after 8 mins and let them cool 10 mins or so, still a bit raw so baked another 3 mins. Next time I will refrigerate the dough even longer and bake 10 mins. The 1/4 tsp salt measurement was perfect for me.

VERY good! Needs maybe a touch more salt?  Other than that it was a great recipe.  I'll make again and I'm writing it in my recipe book.
Reminds me of the recipe I used as a kid  :)

No, I won't be making this recipe again.  I can bake in my sleep, but these were weird, they tasted like shortening, were flat as a pancake, and were still raw in the middle.  I think I'll stick to the recipe on the inside of the box of Crisco golden vegetable shortening.  Thanks for the try though.

My fault I didn't like these, I miss took soft for chewy. These were soft, and like many other reviews said refridgerating the dough makes them better. They don't spread at all when baking, soft texture, not overly tastey.

these cookies are excellent!  Soft and chewy.  I didn't have the shortening on-hand and used all butter and it still turned out well.  Good recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

Very good cookies!  If you want them to be softer and chewier, you'll need to take them out before they brown... a little earlier than you would think.  For me, it was between 8-9 minutes.

The best cookies I ever made. They are soft, moist, and chewy. I followed the recipes exactly, but used all butter and no shortening, and they were fantastic. I will definitely make these cookies again.

My goodness, these are fantastic!!  I have tried several Choc. Chip Cookie recipes, and they were okay...they were like cake, though.  When I want a cookie, I want a cookie...not cake!  These are indeed soft, and chewy.  I did have to use all butter because I had no shortening (day before grocery shopping) and they still turned out so good.  There was ALOT of butter flavor though...not that I'm complaining.  Oh, and the tip about beating the butter and sugar for 2-3 min, genious!  Thanks for the tips everyone...

I don't get it either.  My family said the exact same thing...that they had very little taste and were (instead) too floury tasting.  Will not be making these again; too many other good chocolate chip recipes to try!

These cookies are good--I like the 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter so you get back texture and flavor... But, I think I should have added another 1/2 cup of flour to make them make cake-like and not so flat.  I'm not sure if it's an elevation thing (I'm in Utah), but they come out better that way.  UPDATE: I just made this cookies again as-is and was going to rate them with 'add more flour' comment.  Apparently, I've already done that--I should have read my own review!

My kids love soft cookies, so this recipe is perfectly pleasing for them!  The only change I would make would be adding an extra pinch of salt.  Also, I was so afraid of overbaking, I UNDER cooked my first batch and they collapsed.  You actually do have to let them start to turn very light brown at the edges and "peaks".  These also hold up better if you make them on the small side (heaping teaspoon).  Cool for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before putting them on a wire rack to cool completely.  This is my family's new favorite!

Absolutely decadent! I must admit that I added about 1 1/2 cups flour instead of 2 cups, which created hard-to-manage and sticky dough.

However, when the cookies got out of the oven, they were beautifully soft and chewy, even after sitting out in the open air for about 2 days.

In the quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie...I have finally found the Holy Grail!  My husband's favourite food group is Chocolate Chip Cookies, so I tried every recipe on this site, and this one is by far the best!!!

A few tips:
**I make a double batch (24 servings) and make a log (approximately 10cm in diameter) on waxed paper.  
**Pop it into the fridge until chilled, **Use a serrated knife to "slice and bake" bakery-style cookies (1.75 cm thick approximately).  You may have to hold the slice to keep chips from going astray!
**Use parchment paper on baking sheets to make clean-up a snap!
**Bake 6 to a sheet at 350 degress for 10-12 minutes
**Allow to cool on the pan for 5 minutes before moving them to the rack
**Great for bake sales!  
  
Thanks for the great recipe, Deb!

these spread perfectly round.  i've never made perfectly round cookies before.  i just wish they were a little fluffly.  i would chill the batter next time, just so it won't spread as much.

This was a wonderful recipe!!! My cookies turned out beautifully. I did however add 1/4 cup more of white sugar and brown sugar to add sweetenss to the recipe and 1 tbsp more of vanilla, without it I found the cookies had more of a buttery taste. To make them perfectly round I rolled them into a ball and pressed them into 1/2 inch pieces(like small pancakes)and baked @ 350 degrees.

Wow. These are amazing!! Definitely need to watch the oven and take them out before they start to turn dark - in my oven they only needed about 6-7 minutes. Only problem is that it made at least 5 dozen, which is way more than we need for only 2 of us!! Guess we'll have to make excuses to eat more cookies...

Followed the recipe, but these just weren't that good. After baking 10 minutes, they were soft, but practically raw in the middle, and the pale, unappetizing appearance made even my children wrinkle their noses. If you cook them long enough to get them even slightly browned, they are dry and crumbly when they cool. The flavor was alright, but nothing to write home about. We won't be making these again.

I'm making these cookies for the umpteenth time, and they're a hit once again! These are by far my family's favorite, and we're serious chocolate cookie connoisseurs. I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out beautifully. The only thing I will say is that this isn't a recipe you can double. I've tried doing so using my Kitchenaid mixer and by hand, and it never turns out the way it does when I make a single batch. That's ok though, I'm willing to make a few separate batches!

Excellent cookie recipe. I agree with another reviewer who did not like the raw dough and started to worry about the baked cookie, but it is great afterall.  -Also saved me the calories I usually eat from the raw dough!  There isn't much salt and a little less sugar than most recipes; that may be why the raw dough doesn't have the taste I expected.  I wanted a cookie that would work on my new cookie sheets and not thin out, be soft on the inside, crisp on the outside, is not too sweet and this is it. Perfect for me and the whole family agreed.

These were really excellent, I liked them a lot.  A really classic chocolate-chip cookie, nothing fancy or weird, just exactly what you want a chocolate chip cookie to taste like.  I did have leftovers and they did stay soft and delicious for a few days.  After reading the other reviews that said the cookie didn't have much taste, I tasted the dough before I baked it and I kind of agree, so I added an extra tsp of vanilla (I used real vanilla, not extract) and another 1/4 tsp of salt.  It really helped and the cookies were yummy!  My husband and kids loved them.

Perfect cookies!  Nice thick, soft & chewy!! The only change I would make next time is if you use unsalted butter like I did, I would increase the salt from 1/4 up to as much as 3/4 tsp. They needed that little extra so they wouldn't be as flat tasting.  These cookies are definitely our families new favorite.

These cookies were absolutely FANTASTIC!! I'm a firefighter and I made a batch of these for my fellow firefighters and they loved, loved, loved them. They ate every last one and now expect them every week! I followed the recipe exactly! :)

I made these for a friend who was in the hospital after a bike accident.  His face was hurt so he couldn't chew much.  These are exceptional!  So delicious!  Warm them in the oven and serve with vanilla ice cream - decadent!

Extremely yummy! The old recipe I followed, I thought was delicious, but then THIS. Nice and softly crispy on the edges and then the middle..BAM! Chocolatey, gooey, fluffy goodness. I think the brown sugar definitely has a magnificent effect on them. Definitely my recipe for baking in the future.

Amazing! Made them for the kids for Thanksgiving, they are very soft, and stayed that way for a few days. Had to hide a few for the next day! Nobody could believe that they were homemade by me! I doubled this recipe, and they did stay soft, unlike another rating said.

My mom and sisters and I love to bake. We like to bake cakes, brownies, cupcakes, and cookies, and lots more. We like to make them from scratch. Out of all the chocolate chip cookie recipes we've tried (And believe me, we've tried lots!) this is the best one. The problem is my mom will wake up in the middle of the night and eat all of them! And then in the morning it's disappointing. But these cookies are great,  and we will for sure use again! Note: We DID double the batch, and they still turned out just fine! :)

This is my new "go to" cookie recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe says and they were great! I don't like to make alot of cookies at once so I used about half the cookie dough and saved the rest in the fridge for another day. They only lasted about 2 days before we baked and ate them all! Even my picky husband was asking for more!

BEST COOKIE RECIPE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!.....I've made this recipe over 30 times just as it is, taking it to visiting teaching, giving it as little gifts for friends, and I've gotten nothing back but wonderful compliments about the cookies. All I can say is no look further this is the best recipe.

Perfect recipe! The cookies look fantastic and taste great.  I had to bake my cookies for much longer but I took them out before they got dark and let them cool on the sheet for five minutes like the directions said.  I don't know if I made my cookies too big (~1/4 cup balls of dough) or if it is because I have a gas oven, but I ended up baking my cookies for 15 minutes (these were on a thin, dark sheet on the top shelf) and 20 minutes (on a "rolled" sheet in the middle of the oven). I will be using this recipe again and again!

I've been searching every where for a reciped that actually made chewy, soft cookies.  Every other recipe that I'd tried always ended up being cakey.  I absolutely hate cakey cookies.  When I made these, though, they were absolutely perfect.  I think I read that someone thought they were just like Subway cookies, and I absolutely agree.  My sister and her friend really liked themt, too, which is saying something.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular.  They sort of tasted like a chocolate pretzel.  Amazing.  I will most definitely make these again. (:

I love soft cookies and gave this a try. I used 2 sticks of Nucoa margerine and was out of shortening and mixed semi-sweet & dark chocolate chips. Was a little unsure about just using one egg, but followed the recipe. They baked pretty flat and a little uncooked in the center (just the way I like them). My husband said that they were the best cookies that I've made so far. They were very soft and stuck together when I stacked them in a container. Next time, I may increase the flour by 1/4 cup for some height. Otherwise, this may replace my standard cookie recipe that I've been using for decades.

this is the best recipe.  I make them in bar form (13X9) bake at 375 for 18 minutes -  perfect everytime.  We had a handy man last year that decided he would work for cookies after having one of these.  Great for school birthday parties too.

REALLY good cookies.  I've tried recipes with all shortening and all butter.  The combination makes these perfect.  One tip from another reviewer that is essential...store the cookies in a ziploc bag with a piece of bread.  I left these out overnight and they became a bit too crunchy.  Put them in the bag with the bread and they returned to their chewy goodness.

Amazing cookie recipe- the shortening helps keep the cookie chewy even two days after baking. I followed the recipe exactly. Few tips- dallop smaller amounts of cookie dough onto the cookie pan for accurate cooking time. I was aiming for larger cookies and put golf-ball size dough balls and ended up cooking them for closer to 13 mins (originally after 10 mins as the other recs said, the middle was still undercooked). After my first batch, I used 1 tablespoon size dough balls and 8-10 mins was perfect! Also I usually bake cookies around 320 degrees  but this time I baked them at 350 which was perfect. Also since I only had milk chocolate chips, i cut down the amount of chips to 1 cup which was better since they tend be sweeter than semi sweet. Overall great recipe!!!

awesome!! I use Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semisweet - It's a totally different and much better cookie. Place a slice of bread in with the cookies during storage and keeps fresh

These cookies are SOOO greasy!  I've tried using shortening in cookies before, and they just never turn out good.  I thought I'd give this recipe a try because of all the good reviews, but I just don't see how so many people liked these. I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it was written, but the cookies came out flat and they fell apart after cooling.  I am very experienced in making chocolate chip cookies, so this was not due to my own error. I have been searching for the perfect recipe for about 20 years now.  This recipe will not be made again.  There are much better ones out there.

These cookies come out super!  I wanted to do something a little different than plan old chocolate chip so I made them into triple chocolate chip cookies, for thanks giving.  None of them were left at the end of the night.  There is one thing that I will try next time I make these cookies though.  I'll try putting in less shortning, and more butter..I'm not sure if it was just me but I felt like I could teast the shortning a little too much. Hands down these are awesome cookies!

BEST RECIPE EVER.  PERIOD.  My husband has 3 chocolate chip cookies and milk every night (15+years), and he has tried every recipe under the moon.  This one beats them all hands down.  Our decade-long search for the perfect recipe is over, thankfully.

Simply the best cookie recipe EVER. I used a cup of shortening instead of substituting half for butter. I found by doing this it gave the cookies a crispy edge with a soft middle. My favorite type of cookie! Guarantee they'll be gone before the end of the day!

The flavor of these cookies was great; however, they were very thin and flat.  Even though I chilled my dough and cookie sheet, I ended up with something more like chocolate chip pancakes than cookies!  I definitely recommend adding an extra half cup of flour.

Yum!  I had my 10 year old stepdaughter mix all of this together (it was so easy) and I baked them.  These are so soft!  I did bake them about 10-11 minutes and they were still very soft.  I also used butter flavored shortening instead of regular and mini chocolate chips instead of the larger ones only because that's what I had on hand.  We'll be making these again!

I will only use this recipe from now on. I was tired of flat crunchy cookies.  Now we have soft chewy ones. This is the best. I follow it to a "T" and it never fails.

Fantastic. I just increased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and baked each sheet of cookies for 9 minutes exactly. They're like a homemade version of the Pillsbury Cookie Dough! It says to mix well, but it's best to incorporate the ingredients once you've added baking soda to wet ingredients. Otherwise you get a flat cookie (or cake for that matter). Don't overmix and you'll get a great result in all of your baking :)

I love the butter and shortening together.  My usual recipe uses just butter and they flattened a lot more than these.  Which of course, led to them hardening after a few days.  The mix of shortening and butter keeps the cookie from flattening.  Make sure you undercook slightly to keep them soft and chewy.  Oh, and I always add a handful of butterscotch chips along with the chocolate chips!

I gave this cookie 5 stars but my hubby says only a 4 1/2 because they aren't sweet enough for him.  I will definitely use this recipe from now on, though I may tamper with the sweetness of it.

These cookies turned out great! I LOVE chocolate chip cookies that are soft and chewy. This recipe did not disappoint. I didn't add quite as much flour as the recipe listed. I add cup by cup and then hold back once the dough reaches the right consistency. I used butter and Crisco shortening. Just wonderful.

This was just what I was hoping it would be. My three year old helped make them it was so simple, and on top of that, the recipe for 12 cookies gave us 29 (no really, it wasn't eaten before the final count). Thanks!

I made this recipe today.  I had chosen 3 new recipes to try.  I  made it as written except I increased the vanilla because I usually always do that when making cookies.  The results were as  promised, slightly crisp outside, soft inside.  The flavor was good, but I could tell a taste difference using the shortening as I normally use all butter in my cookies.  I'll be trying others, but this one will be kept, it's definately a good basic soft cookie, not cakey at all.  Thank your for sharing with us!

This recipe is excellent.  For an organic alternative to this recipe.  I used Organic Ghee instead of shortening and I substituted xylitol for the white sugar, organic brown sugar, organic flour, organic vanilla extract, organic semi-sweet chocolate chips from Whole Foods Supermarket.  The cookies stayed soft and looked great.  I make this recipe and I look like a genius - thanks!

These were DELICIOUS! I followed the suggestion of reviewer 'outnumbered' and creamed the butter, sugar and vanilla for a good 5 min. or more, used only butter, no shortening. These were perfect! Only problem was they were GONE in a flash! I will make these again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed it to a "tee". The tollhouse recipe on the back of Choc. chip bags is better than this one, IMO.

The only change I made to this recipe was that I used a whole cup of butter, not half butter and half shortening.  Other than that, I followed the directions to the letter.  I'm telling you, I've been looking and looking for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe and THIS IS THE ONE.  I will never bake them any other way as long as I live.  Wow.  Simply divine.  Thank you!

try adding 1/2 cup of instant vanilla pudding- for extra chewy-ness. Adding oatmeal, molasses and coconut powder make them amazing!!!( I also use white chocolate chips and pecans)

these cookies were simply the "best" I switched the ingridients though ... I got home from a stressful day at work and found out I had no chocholate chips so I put in some oatmeal and raisins ... O wow I thought I would ruin the recipe but it was the total opposite .... I even added some walnuts !

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe i have ever had.  The only thing i did different was you 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and i also mixed in milk chocolate chips with the semi sweet.  My husband likes his a little harder so i leave his in an additional 3 or 4 min...I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!!!!!!

everyone loves these cookies, and they're so easy and quick to make.  while the cookies are baking, i usually rotate the baking sheet at 4 minutes,take them out right at 8, and leave on the baking sheet for about 30seconds to 1 minute. these cookies are awesome!!!!

I only use whole wheat flour, so I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I am sure they would have been delicious with white flour...but if you are a wheat eater, DON'T use wheat...they were bready.  They tasted like chocolate chip bread.

I made these into bars, like the recipe suggests, and was very disappointed in the outcome. The bars were far too soft and fell apart. I gave them a 3 because even though they fell apart, they still tasted great! Maybe some extra flour will help, I will experiment and let you know!

These weren't the softest cookies but they were delicious!! These cookies were gobbled up in minutes. I used semi-sweet swirled with white chocolate chips. Mmmm.

I made these cookies one day for my boyfriend, because I knew he liked soft cookies. So I looked around and came across this recipe. The cookies turned out amazing! He thought they were store bought. The only adjustments I made to the recipe were: instead of using 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of butter, I used 1 full cup of softened butter AND I used White chocolate/Dark chocolate swirled chips instead of semi sweet chocolate.  Like I said, they turned out amazing! Best recipe ever, definitely a keeper.

These were OK, but I had too many chocolate chips because the batter was dry.  They also weren't soft or chewy!  I think this may be due to living in a dry climate though so next time maybe I'll add some milk.

This is the recipe I use almost every time I make cookies.  The trick is to not over-bake them.  Bake them until they are puffed up and a little golden brown on the edges.  After you let them sit, they will be perfectly soft.  They are delicious!

These are great, I used mini choco chips and a little more vanilla after reading some reviews. It made 2 dozen however I had to cook them for almost 14 minutes, which was perfect. My husband loves them. Thanks.

ok, i too have searched for the perfect cookie and have stopped with this recipe.  follow this exactly and you won't be disappointed.  one tip i learned from alton brown - i use a large scoop of dough, make a ball, then break into 2, push together slightly, with rough side up, and bake.  they come out looking like you bought them at a store.

This is the best cookie recipe. The cookies were so very delicious even after a few days. I get so many people complementing them. Make sure not to bake too long or else they won't come out soft. i combined regular chocolate chips with peanut butter chips and it was awesome!

I am known for messing up homemade cookies, but these turned out pretty nice. I added an extra tsp of vanilla and extra 1/4 tsp of salt as mentioned by another reviewer. I made sure to take them out as soon as the centers were no longer wet (7 mins on my oven). They were still soft and tasty the next day.

Perfect and yummy! I took the advice of others and used 3/4 tsp of salt as that I used unsalted butter. Came out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

Edit: I now only use The Chewy by Alton Brown on the Food Network. The search is over!

This recipe was really good, however I find that what it misses is the good flavor used from butter like most typical cookies.  If you take a 1/2 tsp of butter extract added to the recipe and use the butter crisco it makes the cookies taste even better.  Make sure that you also take the cookies out as soon as the edges brown so they will turn out nice and soft.  I also added the extra vanilla.  This is a very good soft chocolate chip especially with the added butter extract and extra vanilla.

I have made throughout the years, dozens of chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this is definitely one of  the the best ones. My mother told me to put it with the "to make again" recipes!I felt the dough was a bit dry, so I added a bit of cream to loosen it up...turned out great!

I made this into a cookie cake and it turned out wonderful!  I had to bake it for about 25 mins until the top was golden brown.  Who needs to make individual cookies when these are great.  They were soft and very chocolatey.  I will never buy another cookie cake from the grocery store again.  Thanks a bunch!

These are great.  I like criso cookies, but my husband doesn't.  I always think that soft chocolate chip cookies are boring.  These are an exception.  They please both of us.  I will always use this recipe now.

The flavor of these cookies were good, but they were not soft...not at all!  Because they are called soft choc. chips cookies, I can't give them a very good rating.  I did not use a mixer, so I don't know if that was the problem.

I cannot praise these cookies enough!  I went on a mission one month in search of the perfect chocolate chip cookie-- my husband swears he gained 10 lbs. that month!  This is by far and away THE BEST-- and tried just about all the 5* recipes from this site.  The first time I made them as the recipe is written and they were fabulous.  Then I customized it for our own personal taste by altering the mix of chocolate chips.  I use 1/2 cup semi-sweets, then I coarsely chop a chocolate bar with almonds to equal one cup, plus some.  I can't even begin to describe how good these are.  I have given these cookies to the most sophisticated choc. chip cookie connosieurs and they pass with flying colors!  What an incredible cookie...

While fairly enjoyable to eat (I have yet to find a chocolate chip cookie recipe that wasn't), these were in no way soft or chewy.  They were VERY greasy and flat as pancakes!  I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what happened, but I was very disappointed.  I'll stick with Tollhouse from now on.

I LOVED these cookies.  So did my very picky husband and finicky 2 year old.  I did have to guess at whether to roll into balls and press down or to drop from spoon (did the balls and pressed down) and I used a little over a TBSP for each cookie (this was not noted either)

This recipe is great! A few tips use lard if you like butter try the butter flavored lard, also cream butter and lard and sugars for 5 min. Roll the dough in to balls. take them out a min early and keep on cookie sheet to cool (they continue to bake on the cookie sheet). I love soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies and these stay perfect for a while. Microwave them for 5-10 sec 2x's if you wa t the chips to be melty again after the have cooled.

This is a fool proof recipe if you follow it exactly. I started out my adventures in baking with this recipe. I added M&Ms for more color. These are now a staple in my baking arsenal.

These cookies were very tasty. I was looking for a soft cookie recipe, they were not the kind of soft I was trying to find.  I suppose I need to search for "chewy".  I followed the recipe precisely. These were not rock  hard, but totally crunchy. I tried as few as 7 minutes in the oven and still were not soft and chewy by the time they cooled. I will keep looking, maybe more baking soda/powder. Oh, and everything in this recipe seems right....shortening and mostly brown sugar are important for a softer result.

Very yummy! Just don't use a hand mixer to mix the ingredients, or it makes crumbles. If you just use a spoon, it blends together much better. These are also great with half choc. chips and half peanut butter chips.

First time I made them followed recipe exactly and they are now the only choc. chip cookie I'll make.  So...I decided to tweek it for a twist.  Added 1/4 cup powered chocolate and used 1/4 cup less flour.  Substituted high-quality white chocolate chips and added 1 cup walnut pieces.  Same cook time same everything else.  AMAZING.  Now I have 2 types of choc chip cookies to hand out for Christmas.  Both are a huge hit :>)

I doubled this recipe and it turned out great.  cookie bubbles up then goes down in the middle to make the outside crisp and the inside soft.  I did use 1/2 cup less chocolate chips, since my hubby is not a huge fan of chocolate.

Easy and yummy recipe. I would have given it 5 stars but I made 30 cookies yesterday (I guess I made mine smaller) and there are still 4 in the container that my 3 boys have not eaten yet, so they are not 5 star worthy. I did substitute 1/2 cup of mini m & m's for the chips and I think next time I will try a smidge less white sugar. They are sweet! Good with a cup of coffee though.

Great fresh out of the oven... after they have cooled... still good, but not GREAT!  I make a big batch and then freeze the batter to make fresh when I'm in the mood to eat.

Perfect recipe as is!  The only change I made is that I tossed the chocolate chips in a bit of flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the mixing bowl.  My grandsons love these cookies!  Thanks for a quick, delicious, and easy recipe!

Followed the recipe except only used 1 Cup chocolate chips.  Very tasty and soft! Could use a tad more salt and vanilla to enrich the flavor a smidge.  Will definitely make again.

Great cookies, these are my "One cookie for every year of your life" birthday cookie! Never "failed" once, and in all honesty the very first "Good" cookie recipe I had used. I have never altered it, and if you follow the directions it works great. My first screw up, was using Un-softened butter, my second was making it too soft. If you follow this to the mark, and are not too sure how to make butter soft Google it, or just check this site. Anyway, never ever, ever microwave it. I set it on the stove as it heats up, than mix it well and mix it first. ---Chris---

This is my new go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe.  They are very soft yummy!  People are always asking me to make these...my husband especially!  Be sure to not overcook them.  Even if you don't think they look done, I promise they are and you will regret it if you cook them longer than the recipe specifies.

Good Recipe, I use 1/4 cup shortening and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and left the rest of the recipe the same. They are super soft and you'll never miss the extra fat and calories. My 3 kids love these. Great with butterscotch or white chocolate chips too.

I only had baking powder, not baking soda but they still came out great!  I thought the dough could have been a touch sweeter, but I love the  fact they actually stay soft!

Best cookies I've made in a long time! Since I used regular instead of my usual butter flavored crisco, I added 1/4 tsp butter flavoring and 3/4 tsp vanilla instead of the 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Used eggbeaters instead of egg, white chocolate chips, regular chocolate chips, and finely chopped pecans.  Cooked on regular cookie sheet about 9 cookies per sheet to give room to expand, and took out after 10 mins.  Looked brown on edges but still a little undone in middle, but left on hot cookie sheet to continue cooking.  Cooked next batch on an "air-bake" cookie sheet, and they took longer to cook and did not come out as perfect as my first batch.  Either way, they were both outstanding, but I have now learned to use my regular cookie sheet instead of the air bake type.

Amazing! I havent tried too many chocolate chip cookie recipes but this is by far the best I've made yet! Mine didn't flatten out like most of the ones in the pictures but nobody minded.  They were super soft and gooey.

I tried this recipe but added 1/2 pack of vanilla instant pudding mix and all I can say is WOW.  Not too cakey, but just the right amount of soft with a little crunch!  I also put dark chocolate and nuts in mine, just as a preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I just made these and they were amazing! Me and my sister-in-law couldn't believe how delicious they were. The only thing I did differently was substitute the all-purpose flour for self-rising flour, and left out the baking soda and salt. But, the only reason I done that was because I didn't have the baking soda.  Amazing recipe! I would recommend it to everyone!! Thank you so much!

These are the BEST cookies I have ever made.  They don't last long around the house!  I have substituted the white flour with whole wheat flour, I just reduce the baking time by a few minutes. PERFECT every time.

Noticed that this was similar to the toll house recipe, but tried it just the same. I doubled the recipe even though the original poster suggested not to. They still came out soft. The first batch didn't spread well when baked, so I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour before rolling into flattened balls. Came out great.

Great recipe. The cookies were flavorful. I made the full batch (the recipe states 12), but I made about 20 decent sized cookies. Try cutting down the butter by 1Tbs or 1 1/2Tbs as it was too greasy. I replaced the shortening with butter and added more brown sugar in place of some of the white (about 1/4C more brown sugar and 1/4C less of white). This makes it more chewy, though I found that this recipe is more of a thick soft cookie. I like my cookies chewy on the inside with crunchy edges, but everybody loved it.  With the size I made-smaller than the recipe calls for-8 minutes wasn't enough. It was still a tad too doughy in the center even after cooling; if you eat them the next day, it should be better. I imagine if I made 12 cookies with this recipe, 8 minutes will definitely not suffice. Timing depends on the oven and size of the cookies. Trust the cookie by its color. This recipe stays true to its look ie light = soft and doughy, browned edges= crispy edges chewy center, etc. Nice cookie!

I've been making the Nestle toll house recipe since I was five years old... And never felt the need to try something different until today.  For whatever reason I decided I wanted something different and these were FANTASTIC!  The best chocolate cookies to ever come out of my kitchen.  Forget Toll House- this is a keeper for sure!

I made this recipe to the letter except I did use half bittersweet chips and half semi sweet chips. I took some out just as they were turning brown and others a little bit after they had turned golden brown and both produced a chewy cookie. In my oven they needed 11-13 minutes. My son said not to tell his grandma, but he liked these better than hers! This will be my go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  An easy, no fuss, delicious cookie! ADDED 5/20/10-I HAVE MADE THESE A COUPLE MORE TIMES AND I HAVE DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND THEY STILL WORK OUT GREAT. STILL CHEWY AND WONDERFUL! I DID MIX THE SUGAR/BUTTER/SHORTENING MIXTURE LONGER.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic! Not too flat, not too puffy.. just right. I also like that they are crispy around the edges and soft in the middle.

Extremely tasty. I added M&M's for some color and my husband was thrilled with how soft these cookies were.

This is my first time to write a review and these are the BEST cookies!! I didn't have shortning so i used 1/2 cup of butter instead... I also made one batch with white chocolate chips, M&M's, I topped some of the cookies with marshmallows right after they were out of the oven.. Fun and super yummy cookies! Thanx alot for the recipe!! :)

It was good, but it was a little dry. I felt very accomplished though, I've never made cookies from scratch before!

Didnt care for these cookies...  they tasted oily and not flavorful. I will say they remained rather soft, but I think that is due to the high amount of shortening added. I tossed them out. Thanks.

These are extremely good. Soft, flat, yummy =) Although I made them with whole wheat flour and instead of adding white sugar I added 2 huge tablespoons of honey. Honey made the cookies even more chewier. And healthier...

The best ever, and I did double the recipe before I read #3, using one package of Chocolate chips, and they turned out amazing. I wonder why is says not to double. I can't imagine them being any better!

I chose to make a low fat version by using BALADE light butter to cut the fat instead of the regular butter and shortening. I did everything else as directed. The cookies were more on the crispy side and I had to bake them for a little longer (13 minutes)...but they turned out DELISH!!! My family loves them!

My mom and I had made a batch of cookies (from the chips package) the week before.  Since I didn't want to use all butter I chose this recipe and LOVED IT!  I think I'll be using this recipe from now on.

made these cookies today with my daughter and I absolutely LOVE them! they are so soft and chewy...I didn't have any shortening so I just used 1 cup of butter, but they still turned out amazing. Also-for people who said the cookies weren't soft..(for any kind of cookie) I line my cookie sheet with parchment paper and bake the cookies on the paper..they turn out perfect everytime!

By far the BEST chocalate chip cookie recipe ever!  I have been searching for a recipe for years that was different from the tollhouse cookie bag, and this one definately is! I left everything the exact same and took them out before browned and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes to continue cooking.

These cookies were amazing. I normally hate chocolate chip cookies but I just couldn't stop eating these!! My family also loved them. At first I had some issues with them falling apart and considered adding more egg next time, but just cook them for 10-12 minutes and they turn out perfect.

I agree with other reviewers that this is the best CCC recipe ever. I have been trying to find a chocolate chip cookie recipe for years that tasted this good. I just sent my college son four dozen of these cookies...the kids on his floor in the dorm went crazy. Perfect blend of softness and crispness. I agree that you've got to watch the baking time and not allow them to get too done. Let them finish baking on the cookie sheet. Thanks for sharing SamBuxton1010.

Very good! I substituted 1/2 c shortening for 1/2 c margerine... bc I did not have shortening on hand.  I made this recipe bc I only had 1 egg and all other recipes counted for 2. Also from the advise of others I did 1/2 t of salt. Very soft and delish! I will make again!

I just finished making a batch of this cookies. They turned out great! Awesome texture...a little soft and a little crispy. I will use this recipe from now on when I make chocolate chip cookies. Two thumbs up from Hubby! Revisions I made were: I increased the salt to 1/2 t because I thought the batter was a little bland. I added 3/4 chopped walnuts and baked them for about 14 min. because we like cookies a little dark. Yummy....Thanks for the great recipe!

These are great cookies. I used turbinado in place of white sugar and that gave these a really special flavor and crunch on the outside. The only this is that i wish they didn't flatten out quite as much. I wish they would have been a little thicker.

These cookies are the best cookies I have ever made!  I made them how the recipe said and didn't let them get golden brown like I usually do.  They turned out soft and totally yummy.  I did use 3/4 cup mini choc chips and 3/4 cups mini M&M's.  I will be using this recipe everytime I make cookies.

I did follow the recipe as written. I had some trouble with these though. I really did not want 12 HUGE cookies. I do not understand how you even get 12 big cookies. What is it 1 per pan? I made them smaller like a peanut butter cookie size when I make those and I literally just baked 58 cookies. No lie! These also went flat on me bad and spread out, so then the edges were getting crisp with the centers mushy. I took them out and let them finish baking on the pan, then carefully removed them and they would firm up better on the cooling rack. Still, they are at best fragile and break easy. I could not seem to come up with a set time to take them out. To me, they were greasy too. Oh my goodness to see the baking sheets they are slick. I think I may try them again and cut the shortening and butter both a little. I know that makes them good, but come on! The taste is phenomenal though. My kids said they tasted the best ever and were better than the ones from the bakery.

I made these because my husband got into the chocolate chips, and this recipe is one of the few that calls for less than a full package.  These have a great flavor, but are a little dry.  I made 36 instead of 12 and that may be why.  I didn't realize until I was done they were supposed to be large cookies.

This is a very sweet cookie, if I make again I would reduce the 3/4 cup of brown sugar to half cup. Taste is a litte flat, I prefer a buttery cookie to this. Take them out of the oven before they brown to keep them chewy, they do cook quite nice and hold their shape.

I made this recipe as written.  I usually prefer the big fat chocolate chip cookie recipe from this site for my baking, however this time I was going to make cookies for a school function and I wanted something softer, a little thicker and chewier than that recipe.  These definitely did not disappoint.  They are also a bit sweeter than the other recipe, and a bit more kid friendly than the super rich all butter cookie.

These were excellent straight from the oven and the recipe made more than enough dough to keep my fiance and I happy.  Only draw back was I found they weren't quite as good the next day. Oh well, guess I'll just have to take one for the team and eat them all when they're still warm. Mmm...

By far, one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I have found here! I did double the recipe and they are still soft, chewy and melt in your mouth the next day! I used margarine in place of butter, semi-sweet bakers chocolate chopped up, added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and turned my oven temperature down by 25 degrees (I'm sure its an elevation thing as 350 is way to hot for any cookie here) and baked for exactly ten minutes.   A wonderful recipe and one I will use when I open my first pastry shop. :)

This recipe is to die for!  I adjusted to 48 servings to make for a monthly meeting and it makes almost 150 cookies!  They are perfect everytime!  My husband and kids love them and so do the people I make them for every month!  Awesome recipe!

These were very good. The first time I made them I stuck to the recepie, and I liked them. The second time I changed it to better fit my family, and they were amazing. I always substitute part of the flour with oatmeal and oat and wheat bran, and it turned out amazing with this recepie.

i changed the recipe from shortening/butter to all butter based on other reviews.  the cookies did come out soft and stay soft.  however, they have a really odd after taste and came out of the oven wafer thin.  i did take them out of the oven early enough when they were still puffed, but as they sat on the counter cooling they fell.

I have used this recipe over a half a dozen times and it is still the best yet. My only suggestion that I perfer is All butter and no shortening.  The first Time I made these I had no Shortening and used all butter and it was the best cookie ever! My husband makes me hide them After I make them because he eats them all if he see's them, LOL.  I tried the recipe after with shortening and butter like it calls for and it was still good but not Great for us with all Butter.  I also buy the small chocolate chips for Muffins and they are wonderful they stay melted in the cookie until the end of the batch.

Wonderful.  We didn't have shortening so used 1 cup butter.  Added some ground flax seed and used wheat flour to make them a little bit healthy. Still delicious.

I did not care for this recipe. I had noticed that someone else had the same feeling about this recipe. It had a strange taste. Texture wasn't right either. I used all name brand ingredients too.

I don't know if I did something wrong with this recipe, but they were not chewy. But my kids loved them nonetheless, they said they are better than storebought cookies. And for making them from scratch, it didn't take that much time at all.

These were good cookies but the dough is too soft almost to work with. My husband and the kids loved them, but they weren't my favorite. They taste more like a regular sugar cookie with chips added. I was looking for more of a traditional taste. I also didn't like that they burn on the bottom very, very, very easily assuming it was from the dough being so mushy.

I just made these with my 2 year old and they were absolutely AMAZING!! I changed a few things. I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and used all butter, no shortening. I also made it in a 9x13 pan. Perfect, not too sweet so soft and crispy on the edges. I will make this again as a birthday "cake" for my husband since we don't really like regular cake with frosting.

This recipe yeilds 36 cookies, crispy and not too sweet.  Instead of 1/2butter and 1/2shortening, used crisco shortening w/butter 1cup or one of the loaf of a 4pk. Great taste.

These cookies are more than the 12 listed, more like 18 when all is said and done. They expanded ALOT and thus became large and flat plus they didn't come out as chewy as I expected, very hard and brittle (which my boyfriend loves, but which I don't) but it could have been because I used lard and butter and next time I'll just use butter. I will try them again and they will hopefully be soft and chewy. The taste was good, albeit a bit greasy on the lips (again, it could have been the lard).

Mine turned out okay. Made as recipe stated. Soft. It's hard to brown them.. but when I did (slightly browned) they were definitely overcooked. I like a more flavorful cookie.

1st off this recipe is so good!!!! 2nd "Daibreak" (one of the top reviewers for this cookie) said this recipe is just like the toll house cookie recipe except for the fact that this one uses 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening. SHe's totally wrong; these 2 recipes are COMPLETELY different from each other. the crisco thing is one DIFFERENCE on top of the fact that nestle uses 3/4 cup of both sugars. Also nestle recipe uses 2 eggs whereas this recipe uses 1... iregardless, this is a totally original and good tasting cookie.

Outstanding recipe! Mine needed a bit longer to cook (15 mins), but were a big hit! They were easy to prepare, the dough was extremely easy to handle, and the result was delicious, soft and chewy cookies! I am never gonna use another recipe again! Thanks a lot!

I did double the recipe, but added a small box of instant vanilla pudding and used only butter to help with the softness factor.  They're great, and will be a big hit at our school function this evening.

Every bite of one of these cookies took me back to my grandmas house. They taste just like her old fashioned cookies. I used all butter, due to the fact I didnt have shortening. I also played with it a little bit. My kids love peanut butter so i added 2 tablespoons and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. These cookies are nothign short of amazing. I will never have to look for another recipe.My family and I are completely hooked. Thank you so much :)

Recipe was a hit only that it was a bit too sweet when I made it for the first time so I reduced the white sugar to 1/3 the next time I made it. Everyone loved it and wanted more...

Though the recipe only says "shortening"
it is important that you use the butter flavour shortening. If you only use the plain white stuff, it won't taste as good.
I made these and they were so tender and soft...just the right amount of crispness to the edge (I normally avoid shortening, preferring to use all butter,
but these were just as good, and exceeded my expectations!)

These cookies turned out thick, soft and yummy.  The only change I will make next time is to increase the salt to 1 full teaspoon.  I love the salt/chocolate combination.

These turned out absolutely perfect and yours will too, just follow the recipe as is! Although I'd love to have all butter, the half butter/half shortening combo can't be beat for soft cookies that hold their shape well. A keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe.  I use to have a recipe for soft chocolate chip cookies in my younger days, but this is even better.  I could hardly keep any to put away with the family eating them as fast as I made them.  Follow the directions - even thought they do not look brown enough still pull them out of the oven.  Thanks!

This Recipe was simple fast & perfect results.
Amazing tasting cookie as well! 
Would recommend to anyone.
I used parchment paper. So the bottoms don't burn.

These are great cookies! I changed the recipe just a little. I used 1 cup of butter rather than using shorting. I added an extra 3 tablespoons of brown and white sugar on top of what the recipe called for and 1/2 cup more of chocolate chips.They turned out great!

I will not make these again!!  The first batch I made just as the recipe says and found the cookies very stiff and bland.  I tried again using all butter and still no good.  I will continue my search for the best chocolate chip cookie, but this will be a never make again recipe.

Made this recipe times 2 this evening and followed the directions to the T.  They are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  They didn't get too flat and are chewy and delicious.  Thanks for my new ccc recipe.

This was a great recipe. They keep their shape which helps keep them soft. Sometimes the batter seems a little crumbly if I use all shortening but adding a little heavy cream fixes this with no problem. Using butter flavored criso works well and makes the cookies a beautiful golden color instead of so pale. Everyone loves them and I always get asked to share the recipe. Without a doubt the best cookies ever!!!!!

Yummy, I used all butter instead of butter and shortening just because I didn't have enough shortening. The first batch I cooked crispy on accident, but the second came out nice and soft. I also added walnuts.

Just seemed average to me. I was expecting some really good cookies but was disappointed.  They went pretty hard by the next morning.  I followed recipe to a T.  They were okay but nothing special.

They're ok. Nothing spectacular. Maybe I'm a CCC snob, I dunno. One thing the recipe doesn't specify is how large the cookie dough droppings should be. I used TBS-sized droppings (ha! that sounds funny) and I had to bake them for 15 minutes rather than the time mentioned here. Also, it made much more than 12 servings. I figured 1 serving=1 cookie. It made about 48 cookies.

First time I made these I followed the recipe exactly as instructed and they came out so delicious. Usually I like to make cookies fresh..just a few at a time, so I roll them into logs, wrap up in wax paper and freezer bag then freeze. 
By the way, I think the trick to getting the cookies nice and chewy is to bake until very very lightly browned.
Second time I made these I added peanut butter chips...EVEN BETTER because I'm a big chocolate/peanut butter fan.

Even though I just made batches of oatmeal raisin and gingersnaps last night, I couldn't resist giving this recipe a try. (Especially since I had all the ingredients on hand.) I'm pulling them out of the oven right now and they are incredible! These will definitely be my go-to chocolate chip recipe from now on. I did add a 1/2 tspn of salt like one of the reviewers suggested but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Yum yum.

This was a great recipe. my papino loved them :) he said they were the best he ever ate.  However---not very "soft" as the recipe claims.  Of course if you only leave them in the oven for a couple minutes and take them out before they are cooked, then they will be soft.  A great recipe regardless.

It wasn't my favorite. I made a couple of batches with different ingredients and this batch tasted a bit off beat. The party hosters said they liked them, but they liked the oatmeal cookies better.

This recipe was just OK. Replacing Using shortening took out some flavor/sweetness.  The cookies were soft, but bland.  Will not be making again. We made them 4 days ago and still have a ton left, that usually doesn't happen w/ the recipe on the choco chip bag.

Yum!  Followed the recipe, except I doubled the vanilla.  Cookies came out flat, chewy, soft & crispy on the edges.  Absolutely perfect & just the recipe I've been looking for for years!

This cookies tasted great. they were just sweet enough. But they aren't soft so i couldn't give it all five stars. I added a tiny bit more salt and i just realized i put in 2 cups of chocolate chips so maybe thats why they are chrunchy. Still good but i won't use this recipe again. Thanx have a good Day or Night!!

I have been searching and searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie - and this is it!!  They spread nicely and they're a cinch to throw together.  I used 1 large bars of semi-sweet chocolate in place of the chips and at the end of it all, I had 36 wonderfully tasty cookies.  I did bake them 10 minutes though, so they are a bit more crispy (but still very good), so next time I might try 8 minutes.

I made these into bars, I really like the texture - the outside is nice and kind of flaky with a soft not too chewy middle.  However, they didn't have much taste.  If I made these again I'd probably use milk chocolate morsels instead of semi sweet and play with the amount of sugar.

This is an okay cookie.  I like the taste, not too sweet.  The texture didn't appeal to me, though.  It was a little too grainy for my liking.

I was skeptical at first but these turned out wonderfully.  I didn't have any brown sugar so I used 1/2 cup of honey + 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead.  They turned out perfect.  Baked on baking stones for 10 minutes then left on the stones until cooled.  It's important to let them cool all the way first!  I will definately use this one again.

Deb, these are great, thanks! 

To be a bit different, I added 1 cup of toasted pecans & half of a cup of ground oatmeal (whirled in the food processor), a tsp. of molasses, only 1 cup of Special Dark Chocolate Chips and a bit extra vanilla & low sodium salt, baked as a bar cookie on a stone at 375 for 18 minutes. Rich and VERY YUMMMMMY!

The best cookies ever! I didn't have time to make batches of cookies, so I made them into bars in a 9x13 pan. When they came out of the oven, I sprinkled chocolate chips on the top. When the chocolate had melted a little, I spread it out evenly on top. They were gone quickly.

Finally, I found the cookie recipe that I have been looking for!! I have always had a problem with my cookies looking, well..like a cookie, lol. This recipe was great, and the cookies were soft, and chewy, and my husband loved them, and so did everyone else that had one. Outstanding!

This is now one of my favorite cook recipes! I used white chocolate morsels, and also added some milk chocolate chip morsels along with the white chocolate, but i didnt add as many chips. 
Great recipe, my fiance loved them...he is very picky about his cookies....soft enough for him, cooked great for me....
I've put the rest of the batter in the freezer, since its only the two of us we can't eat too many. I think I will make these cookies with red and green morsels for xmas and the kids at our get-togethers!! THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!! WILL KEEP!!!

I love soft cookies, so thought this would be perfect, but it just doesn't have the flavor chocolate chip cookies are known for. I will be going back to my old recipe.

However, one thing I did like about this recipe was the flavor of the dough. The flavor of the dough is wonderful, so I WILL use this recipe for the dough when I make cookie dough ice cream! It's funny how the flavor changed so much after baking....

Really a great recipe!  The next day they were not chewy....but VERY good dunkers! Almost melt in your mouth even without milk!  (and Im a chewy cookie lover!!)
Used all shortning one time and they were much more crispy, but still great!  My secret for all chocolate chip cookies is using mini chips.....more chocolate per bite ratio!

Ive been making these cookies for years.  Even when i didnt have eggs or the baking soda....they still come out looking and tasting (better) then the soft kind you find in the stores like entenmanns.  I freeze them and then put them in the microwave and therye the best.  Anyone who comes over asks for them.  I find myself making them once a week because when I make them I only get about 20 out of the recipe.  Still the best!

While these were good, it seemed to me that they needed more flour.  Mine spread way too much, and were thin and crisp, not chewy at all.  I followed others' suggestions and used butter flavored shortening.  I'll go back to my old stand-by, Toll House.

These cookies were good but not great. I don't usually bake with shortening in cookie recipes; it gave the cookies sort of an odd flavor at first. They were better as they sat out cooling. Next time I think I'll just use all butter or at least butter-flavored shortening.

I baked mine a little too long... I would suggest baking eight minutes and check. Another suggestion is to bake only one cookie sheet at a time so the air can circulate around the cookies otherwise the bottom of the cookies are done before the tops. I would also use a little less sugar as they were a little to sweet for my taste. However even with my mistakes, the cookies were still good!

Don't waste any more time looking for the best recipe, because THIS IS IT.  These cookies blew everyone away.  At least 10 people at my church asked who made the cookies and wanted my recipe.  AND I AM A GUY.  I gave them this recipe because I think everyone should be able to make great cookies like these.

The reason these cookis are soft is because they aren't cooked in the middle!  I baked my first pan for 8 min., worried I was going to overcook them.  I baked my second pan longer, until they started turning dark.  Both pan-fulls tasted like I was eating raw cookie dough that had been heated up in the microwave.  I followed the directions precisely, so I don't know what the problem was, but I will not be making these again.

These are by far the best chocolate chip cookies I have made.  You have to pull them out of the oven before they start turning too golden to ensure soft cookies.  Also as another reviewer suggested, put them in a ziploc bag with a piece of bread to keep them soft - it totally works!

These cookies are the BEST!!!! I have never been able to make soft cookies. But now, thanks to you Deb, that changed. This one is a keeper.
I substituted 1 cup of white flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour(just to get more nutrition), and it worked very good.

These are very good chocolate chip cookies.  I doubled the recipe, and it came out fine, but made around sixty cookies that way!  Considering that my father keeps talking about them, I think that is not a problem.

I have all but given up on trying to make chewy cookies from scratch, but when i read the good reviews of this recipe, i had to give it one more shot. They turned out absolutely perfect! I will never buy premade dough again! I think the secret to this recipe is beating everything until creamy with every addition of ingredients. And for those who want a more buttery taste, butter flavored shortening is the answer! absolutely scrumptious. I do suggest though, that you keep the dough spoonfuls moderate sized when putting it on the cookie sheet, as the middle will not cook through if they are too big. THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!

This is a good recipe! I bake a lot and I’m always looking for them to be soft and stay soft, the only thing is that they take longer than 10 min, more like 15-20, but other than that I love this recipe!

Soft & gooey every tine! I turn my gas oven down to 330° and bake for 10 mins. Chill in between batches! I make 2 inch balls.

Cooked as directed....wasn’t thrilled with the flavor of the cookie, except that the abundance of choc  chips certainly helped.  My husband liked them, thus the 4 stars.

I have made this recipe multiple times and followed the recipe as wrote. Every time they have turned out to be the best cookies. I decided to try to make them gluten-free using krusteaze gluten-free all purpose flour. This flour is my favorite for baking since we have dietary restrictions for several members of my household. They turned out perfect!!!!!

They turned out awesome.  I did double the recipe but I reduced the flour by a 1/2 cup to keep them soft.  I made a couple of double batches in which I substituted the chocolate chips for Carob chips and added Craisins which I re-hydrated a little bit in some water and drained them before adding them in.  I also kept the temp at  350 degrees and upped the time to 12 mins, which will vary depending on the size of your cookie.

I didn't have any suggestions, so I subbed 1/4 cup Regular Apple Sauce. I also chopped up 1/2 cup Peppermint Snow mints (Hickory farms), with 1 cup white chocolate chips.

I've only tried them warm and gooey so far. They are great.

These were super good and super soft! Tip for baking, actually spread the dough into the shape /size of the cookie you want. With other recipes I've been able to leave dough  "balls" and they spread flat as they bake but not with this recipe.

We were nervous about these after we tasted the dough, because the shortening flavor was very strong. However the baked cookies were delicious and soft. 4 stars for finished cookies, 2 stars for dough, which is, if I'm being honest, a big part of why I make cookies!

They definitely live up to being very soft! The shortening makes them extra sweet, too. I opt for adding a little extra egg too to make them extra soft and delicious.

Best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate morsels and those came out really good. After I baked them for about 7 to 8 minutes, I let them sit on the cookie sheet for another three, then I put them on a cooling rack for the rest of the time.

I agree that these were soft and chewy. However, the taste just wasn't there. They had a slight grainy/greasy taste that I can only ascribe to the shortening. I will try these again but with a ratio of 75%-25% butter to shortening.

Okay I followed the recipe exact as it said and they did not turn out moist  and soft. They are actually on the dry side. The taste is kinda bland. But with a glass of milk they will be okay ..but will not make again. Sorry guys can't agree with you on the 5star reviews.

Best I ever tasted. Will definitely make it a standard in my home. I plan to try substituting Chocolate Chips with White Chocolate Chips and equal parts of cranberries. I suspect they too will be delicious.

Made exactly as written and these cookies came out perfect! I’ve made many chocolate chip cookie recipes before from this site and Pinterest and they came out very flat. I’m glad I found this recipe and I will continue to use it from now on. Very pleased!!

I loved these! Best chocolate chip recipe I've made in a long time!  I doubled the recipe and it was perfect. 

I let my kitchenaid stand mixer beat the  outta the sugars, butter+shortening, vanilla before I added the eggs then dry ingredients.  The perfect bake time for my oven was exactly 10 minutes. They turned golden as they cooled. I'm grateful for this recipe!

Misread the directions and added 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to 1 tsp. baking soda. Cooked for 12 min first batch and 13 min for every batch after at 400 degrees. Came out crisp around the edges. Will see tomorrow if they soften up at all. Also added 1 cup chopped walnuts. Delicious!

These cookies are delicious,  easy to make , soft and just yummy.. I added the 1/2 teaspoon of  salt after reading the other reviews.  I baked mine for about 13 mins only because i have a convection oven that seems to bake a little longer than  normal. The kids and hubby love the cookies.. yummy yummy  . Thanks for sharing .

I loved these! Added a little more butter, a bit more baking soda, and mixed in almond flavoring with the vanilla (probably doubling the flavoring amount). Made heaping ice-cream-scoop rounds (pressing them down a little) and baked at 350 for 10-12 minutes. The result: chewy delicious, melt-in-your-mouth monster cookies! Yes!

This is a pretty good recipe. It turns out nicely. However, be careful when baking them. It takes a bit longer than the recipe says, but that just might be because of an old oven. Changing the distance from the heat source makes a difference though. It took about 7-10 minutes more depending on how far the heat source (in the oven) is. Aside from that, it is a wonderful recipe. 
(It is my first time baking, so take that into mind.)

These a good chocolate chip cookie, but they aren't especially soft.  I have yet to find a recipe that keeps the cookies as soft as the packaged soft cookies I can buy at the store.  I probably need to find a recipe with pudding in it.  Other than that, if you like a cookie with a little bit of a crunch, these are simple to make and have a good flavor.

I have Celiacs and as such, substitute gluten free ingredients when necessary. Other than that, I try to stick to the recipe on the first try to see if it's a keeper. So, on that note... HOLY COW!!! THESE COOKIES ARE FANTASTIC!!! I substituted Pamela's All Purpose Gluten Free flour (and threw in some toffee chips because, hey there's lard in these anyway so I've already committed to charging into a decadent, bum plumping treat). MAKE THESE COOKIES BUT BEWARE, YOU WON'T BE EATING JUST ONE!

I love this recipe! When i first made it i accidentally used baking POWDER rather than baking SODA, (i also use two sticks of melted butter since my house hardly has margerine) and it was the best mistake i made to this recipe, it stays soft and almost cake like. They also blow up after they bake which is pretty rad when you live with a bunch of men

These have been my go-to cookie recipe for the past 4-5ish years. The only mods I do are extra vanilla and instead of shortening I use coconut oil and butter. I've tried with all kinds of chips and they work with anything, my preference is dark choco though and I prefer mini chips and about 1/2c choco chips and 1/2c walnuts. They aren't a magic cookie and will dry out over time, but I've never had them last long enough for that. Coconut oil has a lower melting point than butter or shortening (without the nasty veggie oil taste of shortening..better for your body too), so I imagine they stay soft longer for me than most people. I don't  have the raw issues or the crispy edges issue, normally if I do burn the cookies they're still pretty soft, just black lol.

These turned out perfect! My family loves them and already wants me to make more! I hate hard cookies and the recipe was the perfect amount of softness. The recipe said it was only 12 but I got 24 cookies out of it. No complaints there though! This is my new go to cookie recipe!

This just took the spot of my #1 favorite chocolate ship cookie recipe. I gave it a 4 star because cookies don't spread much in the oven. Next time I will add the flour mixture in small quantities and stop adding when I get the right consistency for my liking.

Absolutely amazing and so easy to make!  I had tried another chocolate chip cookie recipe on here and wasn't too impressed, but this recipe turned out even better than I was hoping for.  I also added a cup of chopped walnuts to mine- I'll definitely be making these again :)

This recipe is perfect!  I am a chocolate chip cookie fanatic and I love these.  My usual go to recipe loses some magic the next day, and since I'm taking these cookies on a road trip, I searched for a new recipe.  I was worried because, in my experience, shorting recipes tend to create a flat cookie.  Not here!  I just ate a second day cookie from my batch and I think its even better than the first day. 

 I followed the recipe exactly as stated, excepted I doubled the salt because 1/4 t didn't seem like enough.  Also, I took the cookies out before they seemed done and browned and they firmed up perfectly as they cooled.  This is my new chocolate cookie recipe!

My family can't wait til I makes these cookies!! Simply perfect, I love them. I always double the recipe and I have had no problems with them coming out hard. I sub the regular sugar for brown sugar and there is no difference. My kids have gotten creative and besides chocolate chips we've used peanut butter chips and plain m & m's. It's great that this recipe is fast and easy. Doe is very soft when first made but don't be alarmed, I sometimes put it in the fridge for a few hrs prior to baking. I never thought making cookies on my own could turn out to be this good!

This is the first ever chocolate chip cookie recipe I have tried that came out soft and chewy and stayed that way even until the next day. I used margarine as I had no butter or shortening on hand and they were better than perfect... FINALLY A KEEPER .... thank you so much for sharing....

Nice recipe!  They baked really well and set nicely.  I used a hand mixer for everything before the chips went in to make things faster and easier.

I'm a pastry chef and I really love this recipe for a soft cookie. However, I doubled the butter and left out the shortening. I used Plugra butter, mexican vanilla, and good chocolate. Higher quality ingredients make a better cookie.

This is my new favorite cookie recipe! My boyfriend is a cookie monster and has me make cookies just about every other day, so we've tried quite a few recipes! I didn't have shortening though so I just upped the butter to a full cup. I put the dough in the fridge and the next day I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes and they came out with a nice satisfying gooey top and a soft crunch on the bottom! Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies are great.  Be sure you do take out of the oven before they get brown otherwise they will not be so chewy.

Made as directed for the 9x13 except that I used 1 C. m&ms and 1/2 C. chocolate chips. Baked for 22 minutes. These were really good. Will definitely make again.

I tried these last night with some minor changes, they were a hit with my roommates! I used baking powder instead of soda (and adjusted it accordingly-- a little more baking powder and a little less salt), and I added a dash more vanilla for flavour. I also separated some of the batter and baked some of the cookies with miniature peanut butter cups inside, which gave the cookie itself a light peanut butter flavour. I'll definitely make these again. :)

Although it did rise well and taste good, the oven instructions were misleading. It says to bake for 15-20 mins on an ungreased pan but within 8 mins of putting the cookies in, they started to burn.

Really good recipe - will probably try this one again. Softest one I've made yet. I used half golden and half dark brown sugar for a little more flavour. I used Hershey's Chipits but will probably use a larger chocolate chip next time, as I think it might go better with this recipe.

Made these exactly per the recipe--they were soft and tasted good, but they had an odd sandy/grainy texture.  If anyone can tell me what I did wrong, I'm all ears!

These are the BEST! I've tried countless different recipes for chocolate chip cookies, and these are jusst my absolute favourite! I always come back. I was only successful one time making this recipe out of 2 times. The 2nd time I forgot the eggs! but still, it came out quite delicious and very crumbly. :D

By far the best chocolate chip cookie I ever tasted!!! They stay soft with a  melt in your mouth texture. Use a medium scoop so the size remains consistent and bake for 10 minutes and they are perfect. They bake to a pale color (do not bake until browned) and remain thick and delicious, thank you AllRecipes.

I have made these both with and without the shortening. I haven't noticed a major difference in the recipe at all. We aren't fans of using shortening (unless I'm making a Wilton frosting for a cake or cookies). I make double batches and they turn out fine.

It was a good recipe to make cookies. My daughters made them last night. I did changed a bit of the recipe though, I put extra chocolate chips in and didnt add the shortening to the recipe. It was very good, everyone loved it.

Interesting recipe - the shortening makes these cookies light and crispy (but not hard at all) and moist and soft in the middle. They are also quite buttery, almost like a cross between shortbread and chocolate chip cookies. They're good but I think that I'm still trying to wrap my head around the different flavors and textures!

These are the best right out of the oven (coooled about five minutes). My husband LOVES these. The combination of butter and shortening makes for a crispy but chewy cookie. I put these all in a air tight container and they last for snacks about a week. Great treat!!

The shortening gives it an artificial taste. But I like that they stayed soft even after cooling.

Quit possibly the best choc. chip cookie recipe ever!!  They are not too crisp, chewy and lots of flavor.  They look great too!!  Tastes like the first time I ever had a chocolate chip cookie when I was little!

The only changes I made is that I always use 2 tsps of vanilla extract in cookie recipes and I had a hint of nutmeg to the flour mixture.
This recipe is a keeper!

This cookies were amazing ! They were soft and chewy days after they were baked. Although all I had was butter flavoured Crisco and it ended up having a really buttery taste. I'm going to definitely use normal next time. Also make sure you leave the cookies on the hot cookie sheet for about 8 minutes or so, definitely no less than 5 minutes.

Unfortunately I overcooked them.  Read the 15-20 minute time instead of the 8-10.  But they had great flavor and next time I bet they will turn out great!

These are melt in your mouth goodness!! I used CountryCrock for the butter melted, creamed the sugars, shortening, egg, & vanilla.  Added the baking soda and used between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp of salt then mixed in the flour to a dough.  Added what little choc. chips I had left in my cupboard and they are amazing!!!! I ended up cooking them for about 12 minutes. Hope they stay moist in an airtight container with a piece of bread...

Seriously, I have tried so many chocolate chip cookie recipes and these are the only ones that worked! They are soooo good!! Follow the recipe exactly - it's perfect as written! I used milk chocolate chips because I didn't have semisweet and they were a bit over-sweet, so with semisweet they would be perfect! Super pretty too! THANK YOU for giving me success - finally - in the kitchen. I am now a real wife :-).

Best chocolate chip cookies ever. I've been making these for a while now and they are super delicious!!!  I don't need another recipe.  I use all brown sugar and smart balance instead of shortening, everything else I leave the same.

I usually make somewhat "healthy" cookies, which these are def. not, but made these for a special day at school for my son to take.  They looked really nice baked and have a soft texture.  I made them just as the recipe said and they were perfect after 10 min. in the oven and leaving them on the pan to bake up a little longer.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I really dislike baking with shortening and can't get over the fact that it's in there!

I actually doubled it on accident since i didn't read the whole thing first...whoops. But they turned out perfect. Nice and soft. First 12 cooked at 375 for 13 min and the rest i cooked at 375 for 10 min since the pan was warm already. worked out perfect. So you can double the recipe just watch your cook time.

I baked these cookies with my 12 year old son for a school project . They were really easy to make and tasted really good. I think I will try the butter flavored shortening next time as other reviews have stated. Will definitely make these again.

I followed your recipe exactly to make these cookies last night and they were EXCELLENT!  I actually made them quite thick too, so they did have a bake an extra few minutes, but nonetheless they were perfect!  They were a huge hit at my office and this will definitely become my regular recipe from now on!   Thanks so much for posting this great recipe.

Made exactly as directed - I did use butter flavored shortening.  I measured out by tablespoonfuls and baked 8 minutes at 350.  All who tried the cookies wanted more and they looked so perfect many thought they came from the bakery!  Very, very tasty and not overly sweet.  I will make this recipe regularly.

These were very successful . I'm known for usually making cookies that turn out a bit on the flat side, but these were very round and full. I saved this recipe and plan on making it my permanent chocolate chip cookie go-to recipe.

Made some substitutions and they still turned out amazingly great!  Used all w.w. flour and 1 cup margarine.  My family absolutely loved them!

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  I used 1 c. butter instead of 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening because I knew I wouldn't enjoy the oiliness of the shortening and because shortening tends to make cookies spread a lot.   I made each cookie from 1 tbsp of dough which made 4 dozen perfectly-sized cookies.   I also chilled the dough while the first 2 dozen baked.  A great basic recipe, and probably really easy to adapt to include other ingredients like nuts, dried fruit, toffee bits or Smarties (or M&Ms for all you Americans!)

I made these cookies for my husband and kids, I mixed chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and the cookies were AMAZING! Im not a fan of making Chocolate chip cookies, but these have changed my mind, they stayed soft for about 2 weeks. I love this recipe and will be using it everytime I make cookies!!

I added another 1/2 cup of white sugar to these cookies. They did spread out thin and became crispier than I anticipated. But I took them to work (a college campus) and they were a hit with the college students and faculty. So, this recipe will be used again!

These came out pretty tasty.  Only thing I did different was I used the chocolate and peanut butter mix chips and it was yummy.  I pulled it out of the oven in 8 mins and let it cooled on the racks.  Very easy to make.

First off let me say " I HATE TO BAKE" because it's sooooo exact. other than tradeing butterscotch for chocolate chips or almond extract for vanilli you pretty much need to follow a recipe exactly if you want it to come out.  That being said; this is the best chocolate chip cookie I've made, I did subsitute 1/2 butterscotch chips They came out wonderfull nice flavour and softness. I baked on parchment makes for easy clean up

my husband loved these, he ate 6 right away. The only changes I made was to use all butter (I always use shortning in place of butter, so I wanted a change this time- half reg. and half butter flavor) and 1/2 semisweet, 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 white chocolate chips. Oh and I always use vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla. But I don't really think any changes would be needed, these are wonderful.

These were nice. I would have to suggest that when creaming the butter and sugars that you whip for at least 3 minutes to be sure that they have the right texture. I would make these again.

Awesome!  They keep shape nicely, didn't spread much at all.  Soft.  I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes.  I used a 12 ounce bag of chocolate chunks.

This is an excellent chocolate chip recipe. I read reviews for several other recipes, and this one seemed to have the best reviews. It is no wonder why. My husband couldn't stop eating them! They are very soft cookies.

I LOVE these cookies. They're very easy to make, and took hardly any time at all. I sent them to work with my husband like I normally do with my baked goods (keeps them out of the house), and everyone there said they were the best chocolate chip cookies they'd had. I did leave them in for a few minutes longer, about 13 minutes. However I was using an air-bake cookie sheet and I like my cookies a little crispier.

The easiest best cookie recipe I've made-substitute 2 sticks of butter for in lieu of shortening.  Soft & chewy for up to 3 days (if they last that long).  Even I can't mess these up.

Good, but mine came out very flat. And they have a bit of a floury taste to them. Still good though.

Wonderful recipie. Only thing I changed was the brown sugar. I only had Splenda Blend Brown Sugar. They are great. Best I have ever had.

To steal a line from someone famous: Yum-O!  I used mini chips and tossed in some pecans. I made the bar version and used an 11x17 cookie sheet. Worked perfectly. I will make these again!

These were just okay. I do have to say though that we did not have any vanilla so that could've played a big part. We didn't think they were any softer than any other cookies we've ever made. We were looking for a chocolate chip cookie similar to soft batch cookies. My family also thought these had a sort of weird floury taste which again could've been because of the lack of vanilla. We added some butterscotch chips to the last pan of them and that seemed to help. Pretty good recipe but I've had much better.

The cookie dough tasted very original. But I'm afraid the the cookies' texture was very crumbly and powdery. Out of my family of 6 only 3 people liked them. I would only give this recipe a 2.5

These were soooooo good, made exactly as the recipe stated. I did use one reviewer's tip and beat the shortening/butter/sugar for an extra long time (5 minutes total). This is my new fave chocolate chip cookie recipe.

These are pretty good, but they aren't the best I've had.  They didn't bake up as nicely as some other recipes, though they did still taste very good.  I made 27 cookies with my 1.5 tbl scoop.

I really loved the flavor of these cookies, but the texture was just so dry. I used egg beaters and splenda so that could be it too, so if you use these just don't use so much flour and you'll be good :-)

These were way too sweet for me and had too many chocolate chips. I halved the recipe and got six large cookies.  Next time I will use half a cup of the chocolate chips, and put in a quarter cup of nuts.  I would also double the salt and the vanilla, and maybe add some spices.  Next time I will also make the cookies smaller as I found these too rich....and that's saying a lot since I'm a huge sweets eater. These have potential and were very easy to make so I'll probably try them again with all the changes I mentioned above.  Another thing: make sure you don't grease the cookie sheet.  There's enough butter and shortening in these cookies that if you do grease the sheet the cookies will have slightly soggy bottoms.

Excellent dependable recipe.  I also suggest using a cookie scoop (Oxo brand, medium size) for uniform cookies that bake evenly.  Also the cookie scoop really spends up the process and lessens the mess.

These are perfect chocolate chip cookies.  They are the ultimate, classic chocolate chip cookie.  If you are craving chocolate chip cookies then this is the recipe for you.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were a HUGE success with everyone who tried them.  I baked for 11 minutes.  Do not let them brown!

I just made these and they are amazing. The ONLY change I made was I used milk chocolate/peanut butter swirled chips (only because I was out of semi-sweet chips). I will absolutely make these again.

These cookies are really easy to make and come out soft and chewy as long as you bake them for the right amount of time.  Just like the recipe says.  I took other's advice and used all butter.  I LOVE them when they are still warm right out of the oven.

These cookies are TASTY!!!  I have been searching for a new chocolate chip cookie recipe other than one on the side of a chocolate chip bag.  They turned out very soft and moist.  It was good advice to take them out of the oven before they looked done, because they firmed up as they cooled.  I will DEFINATELY make this recipe again.  I did use the mini morsels instead of the standard chips, and it made for a very yummy cookie.

These cookies were an instant hit with my family. I used butter-flavored shortening, and bumped the temperature up to 375 for a slightly crisp browned outside with a soft middle.

This is hands down the best choc chip cookie recipe I've ever made. The only change I made was that I used butter flavored crisco....amazing texture, held their shape, huge hit! Thank you!

I think I need to make these again before I pass judgment, but I found that while the texture of these cookies is unbelievable, the flavor is lacking.  The shortening really takes all that buttery goodness right out of the cookie.  They just taste slightly empty - and the sugar never seemed to incorporate, they were slightly grainy.   So, I'll give it another go with butter flavored shortening...I hope I'll be back with another star for this recipe!

These were a big hit with my boyfriend and his family! He likes chewy cookies. I took a bunch of them to his nieces and nephews and they loved them! I had made them with milk chocolate chips.

Probably the best choco-chip cookies I have made yet! They turned out just great, and yes, I *did* double the recipe! I really don't see why doubling the recipe would make your cookies not soft...mine were perfectly soft! Anyway friends and family couldn't get enough of these, even the realtor took some home! Tip - Take cookies out of the oven when you notice the edges start turning the slightest tinge of brown...the cookies may look undone, but if you stick a knife in the centre you will see they are!

This is a great basic chocolate chip recipe you can't go wrong with. They stay soft the next day, too! Follow the instructions exactly, especially the part about pulling them out of the oven before they are golden brown. If you let them finish on the baking sheet they will stay soft. Thanks!!

I made them and gave half to my friends. My husband and I thought they were perfect. Our friends thought they were store bought for some reason. They loved them so much that they're gonna start making them.

I do a lot of baking - this one was ok but it didn't have much flavor. I took them to work and not one person asked for the recipe or commented that they liked them (I normally get lots of feedback from my co-workers when they like something I've brought in).  I agree with one of the other reviews that the Toll House recipe has more flavor.  I doubt I'll make this recipe again.

Best ever (soft) cookies.  Talk about an easy recipe to follow.  I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips and they turned out great!  Thank you!!

These are the best cookies I have ever had. Seriously. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and added semi-sweet and white chocolate chips and chopped walnuts at the end. 

Keep your eye on them in the oven as they don't take long - just until the edges turn slightly golden.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I did double it...no problems with the cookies not being soft at all!  I baked them for about 12 minutes, removing them JUST as they were beginning to brown per other reviewers.  They are delicious however, next time  I make them I will either use all butter or use butter flavored Crisco in place of the regular shortening.  GREAT cookies, I have a feeling that the SIX DOZEN cookies I just made won't last long!

Wow I wish I could give these more stars!!!!!!!! These were amazing, perfect, exactly what I had been looking for! I had a recipe similar to this but lost it two years ago :( Ever since then I have been on a search for a recipe as good as that one and FINALLY I have found it!! These are incredibly soft and sooo good! I took my cookies out at 9 minutes exactly. Using a 1" cookie scoop I got one cookie short of 3 dozen (and no that's not because I ate one :P). I followed this recipe to a "T" however I used 1 Cup normal sized chips (all I had) and the rest were mini sized. My search for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe is OVER!

I followed this recipe exactly but really don't like the taste of the cookies. They're not very sweet and the shortening taste is very prominent. They did turn out soft though.   ***Update*** I originally gave this recipe only 2 stars because I didn't like it very much, but my husband took the cookies to work and all the seasoned bakers were begging for the recipe. Many said they were the best cookies they'd ever tasted. I felt it only fair to update the review. I probably would've liked them much better the next day as well.

Just took a batch out of the oven and they're great. I followed the recipe exactly then added pecans toward the end. My kids love them. Can't wait for my hubby to try them when he gets home. 

This will be my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies now. The cookies are crisp on the outside yet soft and chewy in the center. Perfect!

I had to improvise a bit with what I had on hand and they turned out fantastic! Alterations: 1) subsitituted 1/2 c shortening with 1/2 c Smart Balance 2)used 1 cup large Godiva baking choc chips 3)baked for exactly 8.5 min and each batch turned out flat, chewy and chocolatey even after cooling, not cakey in the slightest (hate cakey cookies). Perfection. Thanks for sharing the awesome recipe!!

Thanks for the recipe, but for some reason we did not like these too much. I used m&m's in place of choc. chips, but other than that followed the recipe. They did not have a very good flavor. We have others we like better. Thanks anyway.

I love these cookies!! mine I just put pecans in them along with the chocolate chips!! I thought that might be a good addition! I also used a whole stick of butter, (I usually don't do a Paula Dean LOL), and three for four table spoons or measurement on the shorting flavored butter
Thanks again!!

Good cookies. Recipe here has only slight differences from the Tollhouse/Hersheys bag recipes.

I liked these cookies but the recipe does not make enough. I will definately have to double it with my brood. But it turned out good tasting.

THE BEST! I used Milk Chocolate Chips, because I perfer it. Soft, and wonderful. Be sure to use butter flavored crisco and real then real butter it makes the world of difference. I ended up cooking them for about 12-13 minutes. Took out before they browned. Even if they don't look cooked take them out and they will continue to cook just leaving them on the pan for a few minutes. Plus, invest in the Pampered Chef stoneware cookie sheet. You'll be amazed. Thanks for a delicous recipe!

Oh. My. GOD!!!! These are the best! I am throwing away all my other chocolate chip cookie recipes!  The cookies turned out perfectly soft and chewy.  I followed the instructions exactly and didn't make any changes.  The cookies took about 15 minutes to bake, but I have an air-bake cookie sheet so maybe that made a difference. I formed golf-ball sized balls and got about 2 dozen cookies out of the recipe (after eating a bunch of dough, of course).

Absolutely the best cookie, and yes its Nestle Toll House cookie recipe minus the salt (I believe) and add Vanilla instant pudding.  But lets face it, the only reason to look for a different recipe in the first place is because you wanted a chewier cookie, and this is the answer...Yummy.

I don't know what happened, but these cookies didn't stay soft and they didn't spread out, and they weren't sweet enough. My uncle said the chocolate chips saved the cookie. Still, they weren't awful, but I'll keep looking for another recipe.

I didn't see the note about not doubling the recipe, and I did double it.  They came out perfectly fine.  Maybe they won't hold up during storage, but for now, they are nice and soft, so not sure what that issue is.  Anyway, I doubled the recipe, and other than adding in some MM bits, I kept it just the same.  Pretty good, nothing spectacular.  I'll probably make them again.

This is a great recipe.  perfect as is.  Make sure you don't overcook though.

For a twist, add about a 1/3 cup of Cointreau orange liquor into the final mixture.  Very delicious.

Look no further!  This is the PERFECT recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Don't change a thing and you WILL have  perfect chocolate chip cookies. Depending on taste, you can leave them in the oven a few minutes longer for crispier cookies.  They do not burn because of the shortening in the dough.  You can underbake them by a minute or so if you want a "doughier" cookie.  Toss your other recipes, especially the one on the choco-chip bag.

These are great after reading the reviews I too used only butter.  I had been using a recipe that I have had for a long time and hubby didn't want me to try anything new, but I did anyways, hehe.  These are now his and my favorite.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a recipe from heaven.  I have never had any luck finding a soft chocolate chip recipe until now.  This is to die for recipe and all should try it.  I used butter instead of shortening, and it makes my cookies taste out of this world.  I also used mini chips which created more of a chocolate taste with every bite.  You should really give this a try, it is easy and takes no time at all.

I have now made these twice, and they are absolutely fantastic!  They are crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside.  Even after a couple days, they are soft.  My 10-year-old says they are "the best cookies" he's ever had!  I used all butter, because that is what I had.  They are still wonderful.  I used 1 C semi-sweet chips, and 1 C milk choc chips.

These cookies are beautiful but not very flavorful.  I'm going to try to up the amount of white sugar next time and maybe use more butter and less shortening.

Very Good Chocolate Chip cookie recipe.  This rivals those cookies from the local bakery.  Soft and just a little chewy and not too flat.  This is my new favorite cookie.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup flour since my cookies always seem to turn out too flat.  These were perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly but they came out bland. After tasting the batter, I added more vanilla to add more flavor but they were still tasteless. I ended up adding more chips so that they would at least have more chocolate flavor. I will not make this recipe again.

they weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  Very bland, and they fell apart when taking them off the baking sheet (even after letting them cool for a few minutes.) I even baked them a little longer because I like my cookies SLIGHTLY on the well done side.  Wont make these again.

First off i just want to say this made way more that 12 but i don't have an exact count since they were getting eaten as they came out of the oven. Anyways, they weren't the best chocolate chip cookie I've made but they were good.

Although these were delicious and I followed the recipe to a T (except substituting butter for shortening) both my parents noticed a strange almost cinnamony taste that came with these cookies.  We found these cookies a liiittle too oily, like they tasted like butter and chocolate more than cookies, but overall they were pretty addictive and enjoyable.

These cookies were ok.  I liked the combo of butter and shortening.  It gave the cookies a crispy and soft texture.  The cookies just lacked flavor.  They were very bland.

These were absolutely the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made!!!!!! I followed the directions exactly (with butter flavored shortening) and they turned out perfect. I dropped about 1/4 cup of dough per cookie, and I ended up with more like 18 cookies instead of 12 (and they were still BIG). Absolutely spectacular!

Really soft, really great cookies.  I followed recipe exactly and had no problems.  Left cookies in for about 9 minutes and they came out perfectly.  A big hit at our house and I will definitely make them again.

Perfection!  My whole family loves these cookies and I will toss out my other CCC recipes.  Recipe says not to double the batch but with four kids who has time to just make 12?  No problems doubling it and I didn't have to grease my pans either.

Made these cookies this evening and they turned out wonderfully. Made a few minor adjustements-- replaced the shortening with butter.. and instead of 1 and a half cups of choc. chips I did 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 a cup Skor Bits. Cookies turned out great! Very chewy. 4 stars instead of 5 because even with less chocolate chips than the recipe calls for, this was a VERY chocolatey cookie. Almost too many. When I make them again (and I will, because they're great), I'll cut back a bit on the chocolate chips. Definitely try improvising a bit with skor bits, though! I am pretty proud of that little stroke of brilliance :)

Been doing a lot of experimenting lately and everyone loves these cookies. They were really a hit with the neighbours, we are now in baking competition against each other. Took them out just as they turned brown on the edges and they are lovely and soft on the inside. yummy!!!!

One of the best cookies I've ever made! They stay soft for at least a few days. I've used butterscotch chips and peanut butter chips in place of chocolate chips and both tasted great. Thanks for the good recipe! It's one of my husband's favorites.

RIDICULOUSLY GOOD.

My friend has a milk allergy so I used 1 C of Earth Balance instead of the butter and shortening and Enjoy Life brand chocolate chips. The cookies came out perfectly! Baked for about 6-8 minutes each batch and they stayed soft for at least 3 days afterward; by the end of the third day they were all gone :D I HIGHLY recommend them!!

This was a great cookie!  I had read some of the other reviews and I almost didn't use the recipe.  But I decided to follow it and give it a try.  The cookie was perfect! The texture reminded me of my kids' fundraiser cookie dough once baked.  It was a soft, crunchy cookie...not hard and crumbly...and not gooey either.  I thought perfect.  Thanks for the recipe...it's saved to my box forever.  (Oh, by the way, I've been using all recipes.com for a least a couple of years now...and this is my first review to write.)

These are a fantastic little cookie.  I used the pampered chef small scoop and then pressed them out just a little.  I did use the suggestion to use the butter and not half and half.  They are great and I will make them again.

I have been searching for many years for great chewy chocolate cookies.  These are the best!! I made them with 3/4 C butter one time ( I was out of shortening) and another time I added maple syrup to my white sugar since I was out of brown sugar - Excellent both times!!

This cookie was very soft, and tasted good.They're not as sweet or puffed up as most chocolate chip cookies.I probably would try out a couple other recipes before I made them again, but enjoyable and worth trying.

These cookies are the best I ever had! Don't let the light color fool you, they are perfectly done. I used mini semi sweet chocolate chips but followed the rest to the tee. The dough even felt perfect, not to sticky! Loved them!

These were perfect! My first batch came out a tad bit undercooked and it left a film on the mouth (the Crisco effect) so I made sure to cook the other batches a bit longer and they were delicious! I kept the dough in the fridge and baked off 2-4 cookies at a time, yum!

Excellent cookie, not quite as soft as I was planning, however most were gone in an hour in this house.  In regards to the taste I used 3/4 c. butter and only 1/4 shortening which left no criso taste at all.  Sweet enough!!

This one is a keeper!!! The first time we made it, we substitued the baking soda with baking powder (out of necessity) and it turned out great somehow! The second time I had to use dark brown sugar. They were just as good!!

I have a yummy crispy chocolate chip cookie recipe that I love, but I was craving soft cookies today, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  These cookies are so wonderful that I will probably never make those crispy cookies again!  This recipe is great!  I didn't change anything, and I made sure I took them out right when they were beginning to turn golden at the edges.  One batch I took out even earlier than that and I let them "bake" on the cookie sheet for a while.  They were not quite done, but now that they've cooled they are my favorite out of the whole batch!  They are so soft and just melt in your mouth.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

This is definitely the recipe for us.  I've searched for years for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe and this is it!  It's even sooo simple to do!  I've made it a twice now, and this time I added a little more salt.  It was better and they're absolutely perfect.  I may add nuts or whatever other goodies to it next time. THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!

Oh not good, not good for me at all. Followed recipe to a T on a non-humid day with calibrated oven temp & good quality ingredients but was suprised by the amount of fat/shortening in the recipe. Creamed shortening & sugar sufficiently & even added 1/2 tsp more vanilla to make up for other comments about lack of taste.  Even tasted the dough prior to baking.  As happened to a previous reviewer, these cookies spread so terribly, possibly due to the amount of shortening, that they were impossible to eat and had to be scraped (or wiped) off my cookie sheet. I'll not try this recipe again.

These are amazing! I just added a bit more salt and doubled the vanilla and they were delicious! Also I take them out at 8 minutes, still not cooked all the way, so that when they are cooled they're still very soft and chewy. Mmmm!

Good cookie -- not too sweet.  First ones were half done in the center but I happen to like them like that.  Don't leave them in too long though.  I added pecans to mine -- DELICIOUS!

This is my new favorite cookie recipe! The cookies were slightly on the flatter side, but still fabulous. Maybe if I made them bigger they would be thicker because they don't spread a whole lot. They didn't seem done after 10 min, but once they cooled they were a perfect texture.

Very yummy!  Stayed soft for three days (which is as long as they lasted on our counter with my husband and kiddos).  Will definitely make again!

These are my new favorite cookies!  They not only come out soft but they stay that way (although I can't say whether they say soft for over a day because the cookies didn't last that long).  I didn't have any problem with them spreading out.  In fact, the first batch stayed pretty thick so I flattened the subsequent batches a bit so they would look better on the plate.  They have a wonderful flavor and texture and are very easy to make.

these spread enormously!  they spread perfectly round and reminded me of mini-pancakes.  for some reason, the batter that my daughter played with didn't spread at all and were more delicious than the one she didn't touch.  go figure.

This one is a winner.  My husband loves cookies, but is actually a little bit picky about them.  He absolutely loved these because they stayed really soft, and had just the right amount of chocolate chips.  I have never gotten so many praises.  I will be making these again!

These cookies were soooo good. The only change I made was that I used butter flavored shortening instead of regular (it was the only kind I had) and the cookies were wonderful. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!!

Awesome cookies, I did not think they were greasy.  I added extra chocolate chips and made them smaller and took the other users advise and baked them exactly as directed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loooved this cookie! I used butter flavored shortening to give them that extra buttery kick. I baked them on a baking stone and increased the cook time to 12 minutes in a gas oven. They came out super soft so be careful transferring them to a cooling rack.
Note: These are extremely dangerous...I could eat 4 to 5 in just one sitting!
Delicious!

Soooo delicous!  I took someone's advice and used 1 cup butter altogether instead of the 1/2 cup shortening.  They turned out wonderful! I have my last batch on the cooling racks now and its hard to keep my hands off of them!

These are the most perfect chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted or made. The taste & texture is perfect.  They are so soft - they just melt in your mouth and they're not overly sweet (which makes you want to eat more!)  Everybody begs me to make these cookies now!  Thank you Deb!  Your cookies are the best! ~Tracey.

These cookies were absolutely fantastic. They baked up perfectly, and were awesomly sweet and buttery. However, I substituted the 1/2 cup shortening for another 1/2 cup of butter, and used mini chocolate chips instead of using the full sized ones; but still these cookies were fabulous.

While these cookies did turn out soft and light, I just couldn't get past how greasy they were.  It was a big turn off to eat one and have grease all over my fingers.  I also thought they lacked taste...like the salt needed to be increased to at least 3/4 t.  I made my cookies on the small side in 3 batches:  the first batch baked for 10 min and they were still raw in the middle.  The second batch baked for 11 min and they still weren't done.  The last batch baked for 12 min and they were a nice golden brown and pretty much cooked through.  Sorry, but I probably wouldn't make these again.

Fantastic cookie!  This is the recipe I have been searching for!!  Soft and chewy - YUM - my fiance and daughter loved them!  The cookies did not spread at all so I flattened out the drops a bit.  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  Thank you!

These cookies were okay.  They didn't look that good cause they were too flat and since they are so soft alot of the chocolate chips sink and don't stay on top.  I don't think i'm gonna make these cookies again.  They lacked taste.

Not bad, not great.  I used a powdered egg substitute by Celemix, and  margarine instead of butter.  They came out almost like shortbread - which is fine if you're sharing, but not a good sign if you end up binging on them.  200cal/cookie!

I'm going to keep looking - but don't be detered, I could see these being the favourite of someone else, just not mine.  The folks at work loved them.

These were very very good.  Very soft. However, I added 2 cups of choc chips so all I could taste was chocolate.  Next time I will follow the recipe and they will definitely get 5 STARS!

these are great basic chocolate chip cookies.  they turned out chewy and soft, and a bit crisp on the outside edges.  they are also very attractive - like store bought cookies!  use dark brown sugar and they will be just the right color.  i like smallish cookies, so i scooped them onto the sheet in rounded 1/2 tablespoons and ended up with about 50 cookies.  when you take them out of the oven they look light and too puffy, but once you set them out to cool they settle down into a flatter (but not too flat) shape.  trust the recipe times, even if they don't look done, or you'll end up with a hard cookie.  the next day they were a little hard, but i put a piece of bread in the container and they softened right up.  i'm not sure how long they keep because my boyfriend and i ate them all up in 3 days.  :-)  but they were definitely good right to the very last!

This cookie was pretty good, however they didn't seem to stay chewy on the second day. I also used "milk chocolate" chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Yummm!

These cookies were absolutely amazing.  I can't believe such an easy recipe can produce such great cookies.  If you don't believe the reviews...give it a try.

Hmmm...soft, mine were not soft, but then I left out the baking soda, so maybe that was the cause? Anyway, these are AWESOME tasting cookies either way. We ate some of them as is and then I used some of them to make another dessert recipe with--and they are REALLY good cookies. (I added a few extra chocolate chips). Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I will never make another chocolate chip cookie recipe besides this one!  Finally, a recipe that really comes out soft and chewy.  I did not double the recipe (too afraid), but did start over after the first batch was done.  Excellent!

These cookies were easy and true to there name. SOFT!! I rarely ever find a cookie that cookes up soft, VERY excited about that. I did double the recipe before I read not to and I'm not sure why that's supposed to affect the softness of the cookie cause it didn't at all!! It was good, Thanks for sharing!!

I made 12 big cookies with that recipe and cooked them for 18 minutes. It might have been too long cause I don't find them very chewy, after 12 sec in the microwave they're softer. I also find them too sweet for my taste and I have a sweet tooth... Does anyone know if I can put less sugar and replace it with something else so that they don't turn out that sweet? Good recipe overall.

These were absolutely delicious cookies!  My boyfriend loves chewy chocolate chip cookeis and wolfed down these in a matter of minutes.  I used one cup of butter instead of using shortening because I don't like how it tastes and they still turned out great.  Very chewy and rich, and they actually stayed that way.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good chocolate chip cookie recipe - it's super easy and super good!  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be making it again soon!!  :)

These cookies are very good. Not too sweet. The best part is that they are really soft and easy to prepare. I added a small amount of milk because i found the mix to be a little dry. Other than that, they were great!

Even unsure about some quantities (we mixed both American and Metric amounts) due to these crazy Europeans using nonsensical measuring devices, my boyfriend and I managed to make a darn good cookie from this recipe.  We had to use crushed M&M's instead because yet another thing Denmark does not have is chocolate chips.  What a shame.
