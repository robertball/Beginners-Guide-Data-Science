I was so excited to try this recipe, because I've always struggled with the texture of my yeast breads. I've never tried Chinese bakery bread, but the description sounded excellent to me. It is easy to make, but I found the texture to be very similar to a regular good homemade yeast bread. It also took longer than an hour to rise...possibly because my house is rather chilly :) The finished bread did not rise up real high...I think the pan size is a bit large. Even though I don't think the texture lived up to the description, my family devoured the loaves. I will be experimenting with this recipe, using different flours/yeasts, and will report here with the results! Thanks again for a yummy recipe!
Update: I've tested the recipe twice, using bread flour and a smaller loaf pan both times. The first loaf, I used the fresh, warm roux, no refrigerating overnight. The second loaf, I chilled the roux overnight, and then heated it in the microwave until it was warm.  Both times, the loaves were super soft, tender, fluffy, cottony, silky, mouth-watering good! I actually think, though, that the fresh roux bread rose a little higher. I am not going to bother with the overnight refrigeration next time. So,to get the ultimate soft bread, just make this recipe with bread flour instead of all-purpose, use a smaller loaf pan than called for, use fresh, warm roux, and your family will thank you! 5 stars for this delicious bread!!!!!

Jan 28, 10.  I tried a new way.  Substituted 1.5 cups Whole wheat flour for 1.5 cups of the white flour.  Used 1/4 cup dark molasses plus 1/6 cup white sugar for the sugar.  Followed remainder of recipe.. Wonderful!. 
Absolutely Wonderful!  I make it twice a week.  Soft, moist, wonderful flavor. Crust is soft.  Please note that the recipe calls for "Active Dry Yeast"  This yeast is the one which requires 2 rise.  Rapid Dry yeast is a different item.  Be sure the yeast is fresh.   Use Gold Medal or Pillsbury flour for best flavor.  This is such an easy recipe to make.  I do knead it with the mixer and dough hook for the 8 minutes. ( Dough is moist.) I don't bother putting the dough on a floured surface prior to placing in bowl to rise; I just dump it in the greased bowl, let it rise.  Punch down and place it in the greased pan or pans.    I find it makes one 5x8 loaf or two smaller loaves.  Either way - - very good.  The roux can also be held for even a week in the frig and is good.  If one needs to bake fresh the next day the second rise can be placed in the refrig over night.  It is called "slow rise."   Take out of refrig - set on counter while oven preheats.  Wonderful. Cooking time ranges from 25 minutes to 30 minutes. If kitchen temperature is below 70°, time for dough to rise will be longer.  I also put more humidity in the air by simmering a pan of water on the stove.   I do use a digital thermometer.  Temp cook to 190° works well.    I am so thankful for this recipe.

I couldn't see how only 1/2 cup of water was called for to make the roux?  It resulted in a really stiff dough and was not enough liquid to incorporate 1 cup of flour.  I ended up having to boil and add another 1/4 to 1/3 extra water.    I used just one packet of rapid rise yeast which is equivalent to 2 1/4 tsp. and it doubled in size within 1 hr. to 1 hr. and 15 minutes.  Though it has doubled in bulk this dough is really soft and doing the indentation test to check that the dough has risen enough is impossible.  That is the stage I am at now and am getting ready to punch it down and form my loaf for (1) 9"x5" pan.  Will update with my results. Results: Per comments, I opted to do just one 9"x5" loaf but I think I easily could have made 2 of the 8"x4" loaves (edit: was perfect for 2-5'x9's) though as this in one BIG loaf of bread!!  (I used less yeast at 2 1/4 tsp, but since I used rapid rise that may account for the large "top".  Only other change I made was to add the extra boiling water to the roux and I used it fresh. Other than that this was an easy and wonderful bread to make!!  The first thing tomorrow morning I will be making more!  Thanks! *edit* I googled for information regarding the "water roux" for bread making and from what I could find the flour should be 1 part to 5 parts water!  I thought this roux was awfully thick! I had only uped my water from 1/2 c to just shy of 1 full cup, but it still came out good. Will try the suggestion of 1:5.

Took forever to rise and my kitchen was plenty warm. I even tried to speed up the rising by setting the dough in a warm/turned-off oven. Obviously there wasn't enough yeast for the amount of flour, so next time I will add another 1/2 teaspoon or so. The end result is a dense, moist bread but a little too sweet forsandwiches. Would taste fine as a dessert bread.  I baked in one 9x5 loaf pan and it was perfect. Dividing this into two loaves would definitely create loaves too small. I also used fresh roux without the overnight and it turned out fine. Unlike a real bread sponge, letting this sit overnight doesn't make a difference.

This is really delicious bread!  I'd never made bread that involved a roux, nor have I ever had bread from an Asian market/bakery so I was intrigued to see what it was all about.  

After reading the other reviews, I also used more water in my roux, starting with the 1/2 cup and adding more until I had the right consistency (I ended up using almost 1 cup total).  My roux had the consistency of a thick milkshake.  I let the roux cool to room temp and proceeded, skipping the overnight part.  Other modifications: I used 1 T of yeast; and since I did not have the milk powder I used 1/4 cup of 2% milk and decreased my water to 1/2 cup.

Using a mixer is a must with this recipe, as the dough is very sticky and not stiff enough to handled.  I used a hand mixer w/dough hooks for about 8 minutes. As it mixed it developed into a good dough, though at first I was unsure if it was going to turn out.  

Even when done being kneaded, it still wasn't as easily handled as other doughs I've worked with (softer, moister than a lot of doughs and will slip through your fingers), but I guess that's just how it is, b/c this dough made an excellent loaf of bread despite it's differences.  

I made one, tall, fluffy 9x5 loaf, instead of 2 and it baked for about 25 minutes.  I also laid a piece of foil across the top for the last 10 minutes to keep it from over-browning.  The bread was very soft & moist, had a finer texture than other breads I've made, soft crust, & was slightly sweet.  DELICIOUS.

The recipe gave a great starting point. If you feel like baking this immediately, you can start the roux/sponge by boiling water in microwave for a few minutes, while creaming the sugar and butter. then mix boiled water, creamed butter mixture and (make sure you use twice sifted flour) flour; hand mix it at a gentle speed to remove lumps, or use hand blender to smooth. Cool to room temperature or tepid warm Should take 20-30 minutes. While cooling the starter, mix twice sifted flour, sugar, dry milk powder. Beat the egg. Take a big bowl and a cloth that can cover the bowl. Run both in hot water or soak it in very hot water.  Activate the dry yeast with warm water, after 8-10 minutes. Wring out water from the damp warm cloth and dry/wipe excess water  from the bowl. Once roux is cooled, yeast is activated, egg beaten, and dry mixture mixed, continue by combining all ingredients except salt and butter. gently knead and fold all ingredients for 4-7 minutes or use bread machine by combining the ingredients  for 8 minutes. Take your warm big bowl, grease very lightly, and proof your dough for an hour. Cover your dough with warm damp cloth, to create humidity.  After an hour of proof, punch the dough down for brief seconds.Cut the dough in half. Take a rolling pin, roll the dough in a thick rectangular shape. roll the the dough into a log or any shape and add filling. lightly grease pans, and place both dough.cover both dough with damp, warm cloth to proof for 20 minutes. bake.

I've made this bread three times so far and am quite pleased with the results but I disagree that this makes the soft loaves that you get at Asian bakeries. All three of my attempts have produced tasty but still somewhat dense loaves. It is soft but not the cottony crumb that Asian breads tend to have.   I love the starter and it is a pleasure to work with. I also agree with other reviews that 1/2 cup water isn't quite enough. To get it to a workable paste, I needed closer to 3/4 cup. I don't let it sit overnight but I do let it cool to room temperature and use it within a few hours. It makes such a beautiful, workable dough! I make this in my stand mixer and it have never found that I need to add more flour.

I made mine in the KA. It  produced two smaller loaves. I was pleased with the rise process as well as the texture of the dough, however a little discouraged as they didn't bake up as large as expected. I read some other reviews after making the bread and I agree with a few things. My roux was a ball of dough, not a paste, but I still pulled off lumps and added it to the dough like the paste. Also adding an extra 1/2tsp of yeast is necessary. I have had this kind of bread from the Asian Market and this is very close, probably the closest you could get at home. A few of the other reviewers said this wouldn't be an ideal sandwich bread but I disagree, the beau loved it with some ham and butter. Will be making this again, not as an every day table bread but certainly a good treat!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! 
 All I had was a small hand mixer so I used that to make the roux the night before.  I refrigerated it over night and brought it out in the morning to warm up.  I made the yeast mixture as per the directions all though I took about a tsp. of the sugar from the dry ingredients and mixed that in with the yeast and water.  Make sure your water is hot enough (around 110 degrees) or your yeast will take a long time to act. 
Since I have a wimpy mixer I added the proofed yeast to the roux and mixed that up.  Then I added the egg and  1/4 cup of milk (since I didn't have any dry milk powder) then the rest of  the dry ingredients slowly until my mixer was about to seize up.  I dumped the remaining dry ingredients on my bread board and turned the semi mixed dough out on top of the dry ingredients and kneaded all of the remaining dry ingredients in to the dough.  It took about 10 minutes and the dough was smooth and elastic.  Covered the dough in a greased bowl with a damp dishtowel, and set the bowl  in a couple of inches of hot water in my sink.  After an hour it had raised to at least double, so I turned it back out on a lightly floured bread board, cut the dough in two and shaped two round loaves which I put on a parchment paper covered baking sheet and covered again with a damp towel.  I let it raise another hour, removed the towel, and baked for 30 minutes.  AWESOME!!!!

When I started beating this in my stand mixer I thought it was a gonner, climbed the beaters and was impossible to do, so I got my hand mixer out and mixed it but only staying on the top of the dough and occasionally turning the dough with a spoon, But it turned out absolutely delicious, like all have said, pillowy  soft.  This will be one of my frequent bread recipes

I made half the recipe. 1/3 cup of water instead of 1/4 for the roux. I followed the recipe as mentionned. Mixed it about 10 minutes in KA. The weather was quite hot today 31°C and it took a couple of hours for first rise and same for second rise. I baked it in a gas oven and it turned out perfect. Very light and tasty. Thanks!!!!!

Excellent bread!  I followed this to the letter, except I took another reviewer's advice, and just went ahead with the roux still warm, rather than chilling it overnight.  Also, I found the 1/2 cup of boiling water was not nearly enough- I mean, it was impossible to even whisk that way.  So I boiled another 1/2 of water, and that did the trick.  The dough rose beautifully the first time, and was plenty to make two loaves.  After the second rise, it filled the two pans nicely.  It baked up beautifully, and tastes delicious!  We all really enjoyed it, and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for sharing  :)

I made this recipe exactly as written. The roux is firm, like play dough. My rising time was doubled from what they suggest. I made buns, and got 20 out of one batch. They are so soft and "squishy" as my son in law says. Will make this recipe again!

I followed the exact recipe without adding extra water for water roux except I didn't refrigerate over night.  The water roux looked like a dough ball but the bread turned out fine and tasty.  I also used a bread machine to make this bread.  It tastes lighter and airier than other breads recipes that I tried from my bread machine booklet.  I have a bigger bread machine and this recipe made one nice big loaf. 

I used the "basic course" and "medium crust" on the machine.  I feel medium crust is a little too brown on this bread so will try lighter crust setting next time.

I usually like to add some kind of toppings on the bread to eat but I didn't need to add anything on the this bread.  It is a little sweet and soft by itself.  I will definitely make dinner rolls with this recipe next time.

I have been making bread for about 40 years - this is, by far, the best white bread recipie ever!  It produces a loaf that is extremely tender and stays fresh for a much longer time.  Can hardly wait for the grandsons to pass judgement.  They like there bread 'soft' Nana.

I have no frame of reference about Chinese bread or Chinese bakeries, so I really don't know what the texture of this bread is supposed to be.  That being said, though, by following the directions, I too, got more of a dough than a roux or a paste.  I just soldiered on, probably out of sheer stubbornness, I guess.  At any rate, I did let it stay in the fridge overnight then made it the next day.  My mixer wasn't too happy with me, probably more bc I doubled this recipe than anything else, but I was able to get a decent dough out of it.  I tried this making 2 loaves out of one batch like the recipe suggested; it did take a long time to rise (about an hour--I can usually get dough to rise in 20-30 mins) and made 2 very small loaves.  I then used my Pullman pan and made one large loaf with the 2nd full batch.  I suppose you need to use small loaf pans, or use a full loaf pan for this bread.  I got a chewy, sweet (but not really dessert sweet) bread.  It's not bad, and it turns out rather pretty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this in bread and it comes out so good , so soft  and fluty it is worth the time. Use fasting acting yeast put on one side of the bool salt on the other side. Use cool water this will take longer to proof , your bread will taste better . Fast proof less flavor . I cut back on the butter and add 2 tablespoons cooking oil and add 1/4teaspoon more yeast. enriched dough needs more yeast in it, I use fast acting yeast . after the first proof punch down the dough, shape the dough ,let rise and back. with any bread that has eggs ,butter milk, you will need more yeast . I put butter ,sugar in the bowl add hot water stir with a fork until all mixed up then add the flour ,stir with fork all comes together .

I made this in a bread machine and didn’t follow directions exactly and it still turned out my best loaf ever. What a great technique! This is my new go-to.

Great taste and texture. I cut the portions back to 10 to make buns for lunches, no other changes were made. Thanks for the recipe.

Agreed about the roux being too thick.  Added a bit more water and added the paste a little at a time.  Used regular (non rapid rise) yeast and read on another post that you should give it a second rise.  Worked fine.  First rise pretty slow. 

The dough was super wet, as mentioned.  I think the people who added a lot of water to get back to a true roux state would have an unworkable dough and might want to consider adding a bit more flour to the recipe.

I was making pulled pork so I made it into rolls.  Used a 9X13-ish square pan and divided the dough equally.  They kept the outline of the rolls, but I had to cut each one.  Did a couple in ball form on another pan and spread a bit too much but rose well.  Again, a little more flour might make it just right for individual rolls.  It was amazing with the pulled pork.  The sweet bread was a nice foil for the smoky pork.  Will certainly make this recipe again.

I let it rise once and punched it down. Divided it into 3 loaves, froze one for later, baked one, and made "hot pockets" with the third.  I cut it into 8 pieces and rolled out sections then stuffed it with Turkey dinner leftovers.  Four of them were frozen for later and 4 cooked until golden brown. Mmmmmm

I am not a yeast-baker (yet!), but the bread turned out great! I don't have a mixer with hook, so I did hand-kneading. I can't wait to make French toast with it :-).

Will definitely make again. I did have to double the water and butter in the first step to get it to mix into a paste. Also, it rises but never gets to a normal dough consistency. Just let it be like that and bake it anyways and it turns out perfect!
