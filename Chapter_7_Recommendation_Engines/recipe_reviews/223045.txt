This was outstanding.  My first use of tarragon.  The tarragon and cumin make such an awesome flavor combination.  I didn't make the harissa sauce (though I think I will in the future), so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used sriracha and some other spices as a substitute.

Once I tasted the yogurt sauce, I knew I couldn't just use it as a marinade and then just toss the rest of it--so instead of grilling, I baked the chicken breasts in the marinade at 375 for about an hour.  The chicken was so ridiculously moist and flavorful!  And then I spooned some of the sauce (it makes a TON) over roasted veggies.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This was very tasty, although I did not have harissa, or the ingredients to make it, so I just added some cayenne to the marinade to try to get some spice.  I will make it again with harissa.

Tasty and didn't make a mess of the grill. I use a different Harissa sauce and next time will add more. Chicken was very juicy

This was SO delicious! Thank you, Chef John! I made the recipe for six servings and baked them at 400 for 20-25 minutes. According to my husband, this ranks in one of the Top 5 meals I've ever made. :) AND thanks to Rex Hutcheson's suggestion, I also made your delicious Braised Black Lentils as well. Perfect pair!

Everyone loved this recipe. My brother even asked for a copy. I used Le Phare du Cap Bon Harissa from the Middle Eastern grocer and Greek yogurt is a must. Yum!

This recipe was wonderful!  It takes a little extra time to marinate, but it's well worth it. The chicken is so juicy! I bought some Moroccan Harissa sauce at a Middle Eastern grocery, and it was just perfect. I used chicken thighs, and that works, too. I will definitely use this again, and am recommending it to a friend, as well!

WOW!!  I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this dish.  I went by the directions exactly.  However, I used "already tenderized" chicken breasts.  Unfortunately I didn't have fresh tarragon available, but even with the dried version, the flavor was outstanding.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Harissa and have been trying to find recipes that incorporate it.  I served it with a side of pine nut couscous mixed in with grilled asparagus, goat cheese and a drizzle of lemon juice/olive oil.  YUMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!

Delicious. The yogurt marinade was so flavorful and had an amazing aroma. I couldn't find Harissa sauce so I used "an Asian chili paste". I grilled the chicken and made some tasted veggies to go along with the yard bird. I will definitely make this again.

I liked it a lot better with cilantro - tarragon is not my favorite herb and is not normally used with yogurt and spicy sauces such as Harissa

Love, love, love this recipe. Chef John thank you so much for this dish. Just the right amount of spice and so, so tender. I serve these as a sandwich with garlic aioli and fresh greens. Mmmmmmm.

I never post reviews but this chicken dish is one of the best I've ever tried on this site. I did not make my own Harissa sauce and instead used Shiloh's Spicy Harissa Sauce. The sauce was so good I am glad that I doubled the recipe as I then simmered the leftover sauce for about 10 minutes so we could have extra to put on the chicken. Can't wait to make it again.

Made specific to John's recipe. Good blend of ingredients and moderately spicy, but needs salt....increase to 3-4 tsps. Chicken is wonderfully moist and makes delicious leftovers sliced in a wrap!

Perfection! And I didn't even have coriander and cardamon seeds for the harissa sauce. I subbed a blend of cilantro, dill, and parsley. I'm lazy in the winter and avoid grills and even grill skillets. I baked at 400 for 25 minutes, covered, like another user.

I have a 2 year-old and a 3 year-old. Even they ate this.

Made this exactly as directed, and it was very tasty. I will probably try baking it next time because I seem to burn things on the grill when it’s a thicker marinade. Instructions did not say to wipe it off so I didn’t. Maybe that was the issue? I cut the chicken up for salads but I wasn’t sure what kind of dressing to use. I made two different kinds by mixing ranch and harissa sauce and another, mixing the Greek yogurt, harissa and a dash of ACV. Husband liked the ranch combo & I liked the yogurt one but neither were great so I’m on the hunt for what to use next time.

This was Great! I made it twice, but instead of grilling I baked it. I made the chicken breast the 1st time and didn't let it marinated, but cooked it in the marinade (like mentioned in one review). It came out good... but the second time I did drummettes and let them marinate for 3 hours and baked them and all I can say is "FANTASTIC"! These turned out Great and the whole family loved them!

I love this chicken, it is moist and tender. I do substitute ingredients I do not have on hand. I used lime juice for the acid, dried Tarragon, Asian Sriracha hot chili sauce and buttermilk along with the garlic, cumin, salt. Then grilled as instructed. This is the most flavorful and juice way I have used to grill chicken.

Amazing. Other than purchasing the harissa sauce at the store because I didn't have time to make it, I followed the recipe exactly. The store bought harissa was not very spicy. Thank you for an amazing recipe.
