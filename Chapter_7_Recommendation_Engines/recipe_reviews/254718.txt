10.23.17  There are times when it’s a good thing to step outside the box and try something totally new and different.  Never had tinaktak before, in fact never even heard of it, but the ingredient listing piqued my curiosity.  We really enjoyed this dish, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Don’t omit the water chestnuts, as I think that crunch is important to this entree.  We opted to serve this with noodles rather than rice and will do that again.  This was a splurge nutritionally, but all things in moderation, right?  I certainly can understand why this is one of Guam’s favorite comfort foods, because it’s just flat out tasty!

Wonderful just as written! I’m always looking for a ground beef recipe that isn’t mixed with the usual tomato sauce or cream of condensed chemical soup and this was perfect! We love coconut and the coconut oil in the rice as suggested by another user here created a great balance! Thank you

Who would have guessed that lemon, soy sauce and tomatoes would combine to make this deliciously different beef dish?
My daughter has dubbed it "Guamburger Helper"!

I have been cooking recipes on this app for 3 years, but I've never left a review until now. Followed the recipe exactly except for substituting a jalapeno for the pepper. An explosion of flavor and unlike anything I've tasted before. Entire family thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you.

OH MAN, THIS is FANTASTIC!  

This was an easy and super tasty dinner.  I literally looked in the pantry and saw some coconut milk and had some  ground beef, this was the only recipe that came up by ingredient search and I'm so glad it did!  

The only thing I omitted were the water chestnuts (didn't have any but would have been great) and the hot pepper/chilis because that's not our thing.  

I cooked it pretty much to spec and it came out wonderful.  The slight changes I did were: 
I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh (didn't have) 2 onions vs 1 
Probably more green onions than suggested
A little more soy 
And instead of regular oil for sautéing, I used raw, unfiltered coconut oil
Also added some of that (coconut oil) to the rice instead of butter to bring that flavor out.

Wow, thank you so much for posting this, we all loved it and I'll keep this as a standby now.  Super easy!

Tonight was the second time that I made this.  The first time I made it without any changes. It was really good!  My family said it tasted better than the restaurant versions they had eaten.  Tonight I made it again but I added a medium sized eggplant and put only 2 small donne hotpeppers, not smashed. And instead of ground beef, I used ground chicken, a little more that a pound.  It came out perfect, not greasy or oily at all.  Finally, instead of using canned string beans, I used the local long beans and cut them into 1 inch bite size pieces.    Next time I will make it for our dinner guests too.  Thank you Sheila!!

Ya'll this recipe is the bomb!! Only thing I changed was I used more meat and used crushed red pepper instead of the chile peppers. We ate it over rice and loved it. I made sure to let it simmer for a good 45 minutes to really get the flavors going. This is a new favorite in my world!!

Really good!!  Easy too!  Didn’t have water chestnuts or lite soya sauce(used regular), didn’t matter, whole family was happy!  Flavour was excellent.  Don’t be shy on the veggies, ate it with rice, very tasty.

Yummy dish. I made some changes. I add ginger instead of chilis, stewed tomato without the sauce because I don't have cherry tomato.

So good and so easy. We loved this. I followed this recipe except for omitting the water chestnuts and the hot pepper but only because I didn't have any  around. Looking forward to making this again and using the other two ingredients. Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent dish using hamburger. I made it just like it said except I used jalapeño peppers because I already had them. I will definitely make this again. Water chestnuts are a must!

Pretty much followed the recipe as written....except that I used coconut oil instead of olive oil.  Didn't have green onions, so used a large yellow onion instead.  Next time, I will try it with both green and yellow onions.   I added some small sliced carrots, too. It was very tasty and all of my family enjoyed it.

Great recipe! I ended up making a couple of minor changes (long story...); I left out the water chestnuts and substituted a thin-sliced jalapeno for the red chili, but it came out great just the same. I would add that the bouillon cube probably isn't optional; it definitely adds needed salt to the mix.

My brother made this the last time I visited Guam (home). Decided to make it (again) but I  added grilled Chinese eggplant. My son doesn't like coconut but he loves this dish and scarfs it up in minutes! A definite keeper!

I've made this half a dozen times for my family and added it to our go-to meals. it's great as written! It's amazing that it has so little seasoning with it yet the tomatoes give the perfect tang to the coconut milk.

Unusual but it was delicious.  We added a little Sriracha and hoisin sauce that made it even better.

Love this dish and will make again. I followed the directions as written except I substituted asparagus because it was on hand and needed to be cooked. I’ve never cooked with coconut milk before because I’m not a fan of coconut but found the blend of these ingredients to be delicious. Next time I’ll serve over basmati rice. Thank you for this recipe.

After reading the recipe and knowing that we love this type of dish, ( Thai, Burmese...)I made it last night since I had all of the ingredients.  The only substitution I made was to use coconut cream rather than milk and a good amount of Sriracha in place of the chilie.  We served it over wild grain rice and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!  Oh, I also threw in a few crimini mushrooms because they needed to be used.

This was so good!  I had to make some changes due to not having everything.  I used a half pound ground venison and 3/4 cup tvp to help get the calories down.  Then I used roma tomato chopped and chopped frozen jalapeno.  No water chestnuts so I chopped some peanuts and sprinkled over the finished dish.  Even hubby loved it.

I was excited to try this, but then end result was really bland. Then you add rice to it and it just gets worse. I’ll keep looking for a recipe similar to this, but this one as is did not hit the spot.
