I loved making these when I was younger but now that I'm an adult they are way too sweet for me, and I like sweet things.  So now I mix fruity pebbles with rice krispies so they aren't too sweet but still really tasty.  By changing the ratio of fruity pebbles to rice krispies, you can make it more or less fruity to suit your tastes.

I really loved these, but like others have said, they are SUPER SWEET!!!! So next time I will try half and half rice crispies and fruity pebbles.  Also, I might try adding some coconut flakes as well just to try it out. I think it might compliment the flavor well.

This was very good, but really sweet and I like sweets.  I changed one thing and that was the marshmallows, I did not have the fruit flavored ones, so I used the regular.

All of my kids and myself  thought these had an AWESOME flavor. The reason that I gave it only 5 stars is because even my kids thought they were far too sweet. Regular rice crispy treats are made without sweetened cereal so I think due to fruity pebbles being pre-sweetened, the end results are too sweet. Maybe to eating a tiny square would be perfect! Thanks, very flavorful!

My children and their friends love these bright colored treats. A nice switch from Rice Krispie treats. I prefer to use plain marshmallows though. With 3 active children I often put together packages of individual snacks for club, sport and school trips. These are such a fast and easy addition. Best part is Iâ€™ve never had any leftovers come home.

I'm a huge fan of Rice Crispy treats, and I love Fruity Pebbles, so they are great to me.  I've been making these for years.

I make these with 2 cups fruity pebbles and 4 cups of gluten free rice krispies, and use the plain marshmellows with the same amount of butter.  Very yummy and gluten free.

When spreading in the pan, it helps to wet your hands and even out the top. You'll get less  stringy finish, and a smoother surface.

MY CHILDREN LOVE THESE TREATS. I DON'T CARE FOR THE TASTE OF FLAVORED MARSHMALLOWS, SO I USED PLAIN ONES INSTEAD. I USED AN 11 OUNCE BOX OF FRUITY PEBBLES. AFTER FOLDING TOGETHER THE INGREDIENTS, I FOLDED IN 2 CUPS EXTRA UN-MELTED MARSHMALLOWS. THANKS FOR SHRARING!

I make this occasionally for get togethers and its a hit. I make a few alterations, however.
- I use marshmallow fluff. Melts better than the minis by a long shot.
- Add a little more butter. Usually a little less than 1/3rd a cup in all.
- Cook them together at low temp for a long period, mixing frequently. 
It'll shrivel a bit after a few minutes, but make sure the butter and marshmallow are blended. Let sit on lowest heat still for a minute or two, and it'll puff up.
- Add 1/4th-1/2 a cup of dried blueberries.
- Add 2 cups of regular rice krispies
- Add 4 cups of Fruity Pebbles.

Rest is as the recipe states! Thanks.

As a side note, excellent for covering up strong tasting butter, and the low temps do not reduce the effectiveness of certain pain relieving substances occasionally cooked in to butter.

I cut the sweetness in half by using 3 cups of plain krispies and 3 cups of cocoa or fruity pebbles - and dry stirred the mix in a large bowl. For the cocoa mix, I used plain mini marhmallows with a 1/2 stick of butter, and for the fruity mix, I used fruity flavored mini marshmallows with 1 stick of butter (the artificial coloring probably affects the melting point). My pan wasn't big enough to stir all 6 cups into it, so I mixed what I could into the pan of melted butter and marshmallows, poured into a wax paper lined aluminum tray and patted down with another sheet of wax paper. I pull up on the entire wax paper to remove it from the aluminum tray and slice with an oiled pizza cutter,for easy slicing without scratching your bakeware.nDelicious treats for Teacher Appreciation week!

These are very good. I'm just not a fan of marshmallow at all - but I had a bag of the mini colorful ones to use up. I tried this with the cocoa pebbles like erikagee recommended because I didn't want them to be too sweet like so many commented on. The flavors go great together. I used a 9x13 pan as well - worked out well, made the squares a good size in my opinion :)

A great basic rice crispy treats recipe. You can switch it up however you like, whatever flavor marshmallows & whatever flavor rice crispies. I used pumpkin spice marshmallows (tis the season) & regular rice crispies.

So easy and very delicious! Made for a school bake sale and they were a HUGE hit. I used regular marshmallows instead of flavored and everything said they were better than regular Rice Krispies. Will absolutely make again!

I used 2 cups rice krispy cereal and 4 cups fruity pebbles to make the recipe less sweet. I also used a 9x13 pan instead which made the treats a little thinner. Great recipe!

With Fruity Pebbles, it was too sweet. So, I made sâ€™mores. I used 4 cups Cocoa Pebbles and 2 cups Cinnamon Pebbles. I added about 3/4 cup of dark chocolate chips to the marshmallows just before adding the pebbles. I also posted a pick. So yummy and still Gluten Free.

I used 2 cups regular rice crispies and 4 cups fruity pebble cereal instead. This change came from necessity as Fruity Pebbles do not last long in my home. Loved them! Can't wait to make them again. Tip* reserve 1/3 of your marshmallows to add in right before the cereal if you want them to look like the picture.

My family LOVES THIS! I use plain marshmallows instead though. I can't seem to keep any in the house. They are gone almost as soon as I make them. SO YUMMY!
