Absolutely delicious! I ran into a few problems that required me to improvise though.  1. I couldn't find pear juice at the store. So I pureed two fresh pears. 2. Instead of using a white cooking wine, I decided to go with Moscato, it's a pear based white wine, and figured it would be perfect for diluting my pear puree. (And it worked great)! 3. Due to horrible weather conditions, I couldn't grill it outside, so I cooked it up in a cast iron skillet... and it still turned out perfect.

My family loves bulgogi.  The recipe I got from a Korean friend doesn't include the wine, pear juice, sugar or mushrooms.  Since I don't cook with alcohol just used more pear juice for the wine.

I had to make a couple of adjustments: I didn't have any pear juice, nor did I have the time or inclination to drive around in 110 degree heat to look for any.  So I used some slightly diluted frozen apple juice concentrate instead.  I also saved the marinade and boiled it in a sauce pan to disinfect and reduce it.  I used flap meat instead of sirloin because that's what I had (again, didn't want to leave the house in this heat).  I seared the meat in a very hot cast iron skillet, removed it and then sauted the vegetables.  This came out fantastic and the reduced marinade made a lovely sauce for some bean thread noodles.  We just loved this and when it gets cooler here, I'll try the pear juice (if I can find some) and the outdoor grill.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I substituted the pear juice with pineapple juice and the white wine with Marsala wine (I really did not want to go to the store.)  I cooked this in a skillet until done and removed meat. Then, I reduced the marinade in the same skillet to pour over white rice. It was very delicious, and I would make it this way again. However, I will definitely be trying this recipe with the pear juice.

Excellent and Easy, I made a few changes also-
I used a large can of pears with juice and pureed all the pears.  It was a bit thick, but turned out just the way I was hoping it would after cooking the meat ( it crytalized on the meat).  I also made it quite sweet ( by around a 1/4 cup more sugar than what the recipe calls for) as the bulgogi I have had before was very sweet and my hubby likes it best that way.  I also substituted Braggs liquid aminos for the soy and added a little bit more garlic.  Since it is winter and we aren't using the grill, I read about how to grill with your oven on ehow and used this method for the dish.  It turned out perfectly "grilled" and was just like the authentic bulgogi I have had.  It took around 25 minutes or so to be crystalized and for the marinade to be more like a sauce than a soup.

Didn't have the green onions or mushrooms so I used broccoli and carrots (pretty colors), and it tasted just as good. We ate ours with japanese noodles. I would love to try it with the original ingredients and on top of rice.

unbelievable!  my plain meat/potato/bread  husband went wild over this and he even knew the ingredients.  using peanut oil, i stir fried beef skirt but added shredded carrots and raw spinach to the mix.  i finished by adding a bit of water, pear juice and soy sauce to the wok and reducing to thicken.  the final step was to serve over jasmine rice.  delish!

Overall I thought this was pretty good.  The kids ate it anyway :)  Next time I am going to cut the sesame oil in half, and maybe increase the sugar, as I couldn't find pear juice and used canned pears instead.

Yum. Pear juice is the secret. I found mine in cans (near the guava and papaya juices) at a Mexican grocery store.

Used this recipe a week ago and following the clear recipe directions, it was a great success! My guest were Korean nationals and it "felt like home" was the general comments. Thanks!

I never had this before, but it sounded really good so decided to give it a try. Glad I did! I had no issue finding the pear juice, it was in the juice isle - Kearns Pear Nectar, it comes in a can. I froze the sirloin for a couple hours to make it easy to slice in thin strips. I marinated it overnight which made the meat really flavorsome. I sautéd the onions and mushrooms, then added the meat after grilling and mixed it together. As another reviewer suggested, I saved the marinade and brought it to a boil in a sauce pan then added rice noodles to serve on the side. I also made the Spicy Korean Red Pepper Cucumbers (also on allrecipes) and the whole meal was just delicious!!

When this recipe showed up in the All Recipes Magazine, my Korean husband asked me to make it.  We both scarfed it up.  Doesn't taste like my mother-in-law's, but it was pretty close.  I think we will try pan frying or baking next time. Something about the grill process just didn't let us get the sear we were looking for.  I used shredded Anjou pears instead of pear juice and it worked just fine. Served with rice and kimchi. It was great!

My two sons lived in Korean with their father for two years.  The only thing they missed was Bulgogi. So I looked it up and used this recipe.  My boys loved it.  They said it taisted just like it did in Korea.  It wasn't hard and I had to admit it is one of my favorites to make.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Tastes great and has become a staple for our household. All those that have a hard time finding pear juice; look in the baby food aisle or in natural foods aisle (I prefers the Gerber Pear Juice-less sugar). As of how I prepare it; start with butter leaf lettuce, white rice, bulgogi (this recipe), top with some broccoli slaw, top with sriracha or a garlic sauce. I have tried some variations but my family prefers this recipe as is. Everyone I have made it for asks for the recipe and for me to make again.

One of my favorite dishes. I made a few changes. left out sesame seeds ( cant eat them) and added some of my house blend seasoning to the meat. I used a roast cant afford a sirloin. sliced very then and marinated longer  so it would be tender. Turned out GREAT. i barely got any!!!! The family and neighbors loved it!!!!!

I made this according to the recipe (Yes, I did find pear juice at the store. It was on the soda isle in a can. I've also seen it in the asian sections, just not in my town.) We loved this at my house. So tasty. The pear juice really makes a difference. Will make this again, and again.

Different marinade but the sweetness sticks with the beef and makes it tasty.  Grilling everything always is a plus. Very good overall.

I have made this twice.  First time I didn't have pear juice, second time I finely shredded a very ripe pear.  I marinated as directed overnight but at the end it was so-so for me.  I needed to add Siracha and some extra soy sauce to make some more flavor.

My thirteen year old daughter is fascinated with the Korean culture. I thought it was just K-Pop, but no, everything. I decided to make this for her tonight. I didn't read the recipe carefully, so I didn't know about the grilling part. The magazine said that they cooked the meat in batches in a frying pan on the oven, so I did that. My whole family loved it. I served it over white rice. It kind of ended up with it's own gravy cooking it this way and they were spooning it over the rice. It didn't look as pretty as the picture, but it had all the flavor and was very tender.  I will definietly make it again, but next time, I want to grilll it.

I think it would be better if you marinated and cooked the meat whole and then sliced it.

Great recipe. I used venison instead of beef and marinated it for 24 hrs. Very tender and flavorful. Served over rice with a little red pepper flake. Thank you, will do again.
