Used for a birthday party for my 5-year old. Went over well with all the kids. Not too sweet. Added much more raspberry sorbet than the recipe called for.

The kids liked this one a lot, but it was not fizzy after going through the blender. We tried it again, on another occasion, by just topping it off in the glass with the soda and it was much fizzier (looked way cooler too, with the foamy top). This works well with other flavors of juice and sherbet. We tried mango sherbet and orange-mango juice as well. We think lemon-lime would be a great one to try also :D

Didn't turn out fizzy at all, but I've tried similar recipes that did retain a fizzy quality. Maybe more carbonated water? It wasn't bad, but isn't much different than plain raspberry sherbet.
