I made this last year and everyone loves it. The only thing I do different is use 2 cans of Cream of Chicken Soup instead of the one chicken and one celery and add a little more cheese....It is great and very easy...

We loved it!  I added about 3/4 cup of dried cranberries to the stuffing mix and sprinkled about 3/4 cup of French fried onions on top.

I used ground turkey instead, but the effect is comparable I'm sure. I also did half cheddar (for the top) and half reduced-fat mozzarella (for the mix). It was phenomenal, especially the next day. The texture is quite bready, which I like, but others may want to add more liquid.

This is really good. I did some minor changes, I used chicken broth instead of water, really pumped up the flavor in my humble word, used chicken instead of turkey ( recipe said I could and used cream of chicken soup. Came out delish! This makes a great meal for anytime, not just Thanksgiving. Happy eating!

I made this last night, staying true to recipe except for adding an additional cup of broccoli. My husband and I both loved it. Will definitely make it again, and will work on ways to reduce sodium. Tasted fine, just want it to be healthier.

It's a winner for me!  In making it, we added velveeta to the stuffing by accident, and used cream of chicken instead of the celery soup.  We also covereed with aluminum foil for part of the cooking time.

Extremely delicious. And I like how the stuffing is on the bottom so it gets steamed to perfection and gets crispy on the bottom. I also coated my baking dish with butter so it wouldn't stick.

Made this according to the recipe except I broke apart a rotisserie chicken instead of turkey.  Only thing I'd do different is put some of the sauce in between the stuffing and broccoli/chicken layer.  This was a hit for my somewhat picky husband

a small box of stuffing (6oz) with probably 1c of water would make this recipe perfect, though it was pretty good on it's first try tonight.

Delicious! Great way to use stuffing in a dish. I added fresh broccoli spears, after briefly steaming in microwave.

First a VERY important tip: DO NOT USE TOO MUCH WATER IN THE STUFFING! I used too much on the first batch and it came out like slop! I am not used to making bagged stuffing/dressing so that was my bad. Luckily I bought two bags so I just started over and used the whole bag with 2 and 1/2 c of water.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, and added some minced garlic and scallions to the broth for flavor.  I cooked boneless/skinless chicken breasts on the GF grill and chopped them up to use.  I also used on large bag of frozen broccoli, and one can of cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken. I doubled the original recipe so we could have it as leftovers.  Overall, it came out well, but a little bland for my taste.  Hubby thought it was a little bland too, but nothing a little seasoning salt can't cure! It will probably taste better tomorrow when I take it for lunch.

I made this for myself and my boyfriend last night, and we both found it strangely addictive. It's like cheesy Thanksgiving in a pan! I was surprised we didn't fight over who got to take the leftovers to work for lunch the next day.  I followed the recipe pretty much as it was written (I used pre-cooked Tyson chicken breast chunks), except to the mixture you pour over the dish, I added a little bit more milk, a couple tablespoons of Miracle Whip, and a dash of paprika.

This recipes was great!  My whole family liked it.  I changed it up a bit by adding some seasoning (garlic & wine, sage, rosemary) to the soup mixture and changing the soup to one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and I doubled the recipe.  My changes were mostly based on what I had on hand but it turned out great.

This was really good!! I liked the idea of the stuffing pressed onto the bottom of the pan, other recipes using Thanksgiving leftovers have the stuffing sprinkled on top, which is okay too but I like it as a crispy but still soft crust in this recipe. I didn't have broccoli, so I used a bag of frozen corn, carrots, peas, and green beans. I also added a few dollops of sour cream into the soup-milk mix bc I felt like it looked a bit thick when I spread it on top of the stuffing. I thought sour cream might be a better option than another can of condensed soup which could make it thicker, or adding more milk which could make it too thin lol. I also used white cheddar cheese bc that's what we had, and I ended up using the whole 2 cup bag because... cheese. ?? I also sprinkled some onion and garlic powder as well as plenty of pepper into the soup mix. This is one of those awesome clean out your fridge and pantry recipes that you can tweak to your liking and it will come out great! Oh and I baked it for 25 min with foil, and then I think 15 more without foil to get it all bubbly and melty. Soooo good!

Great recipe. I didn't have celery soup so I used mushroom; other than that, everything else was exactly as written.  This one's going in the family recipe book for sure.

I made exactly as specified although I did add corn and cauliflower (more leftovers) as I didn't have 2 cups of broccoli.  It was very good!  Will definitely make this again next year.

I made changes, but I started with this recipe.  I used frozen peas and carrots (1/2 a bag), canned sliced mushrooms, and cream of mushroom soup instead of broccoli and cream of celery.  I also added the gravy packet that came with my Thanksgiving turkey breast.  I also didn't add the cheese.

It tasted just like a turkey pot pie, except instead of crust I had stuffing.  It was awesome!  I may make this next Thanksgiving instead of a turkey breast because I still get my stuffing, which is the most important thing for me.

From the reviews, I was really expecting this to be better. But it was honestly rather bland, and it was a struggle to get my kids to eat it at all. I can't say I enjoyed it much, myself. Based on other reviews, I increased the amount of stuffing, soup, and cheese, and added some onion, but I can't say that helped. It needs something more - it just doesn't have much in the way of flavor. Right now, I would not want to make it again, and I'm not sure I would want to try and adjust it myself as there are plenty of other recipes out there to use up leftover turkey.

This was pretty good!!  Did use Cream of Chicken soup, as that is what I had on hand, and just eye balled the broccoli. turkey and cheese.  Was a good easy casserole to use up some leftover bird.

Not was I was hoping for or read about. Just okay. Flavors did not mesh well together in my opinion. Followed the recipe almost exactly since it was my first go around. Good if you have this stuff leftover from the holidays.

My husband would have liked it better if it had more meat in it.  I thought it was ok.  Wasn't crazy about the broccoli in it.

THIS DISH WAS PRETTY GOOD. I MADE IT WITH GROUND TURKEY (BECAUSE THATS WHAT I HAD). I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER IF I WOULD'VE USED CUT UP CHICKEN.

It was ok but turned out a little dry and thought it was kind of a one note type of dish.  Not bad though

I followed some recommendations and added dried cranberries (this is Minnesota after all), an extra can of soup(it definitely needed it) and French fried onions on top. I used the cream of celery since I’d never cooked with it before. It was fine if not a little bland even though I added a little salt and pepper, so I may try the cream of chicken and/or cream of mushroom next time (and there will be a next time). I made a couple errors with the recipe and it still turned out great. I forgot to cook the broccoli before putting in the dish. It was thawed, just not cooked. I increased the cooking time by 15 minutes and it was great. The other mistake I made was I used a cook-in-the-bag turkey breast I bought specifically for the recipe. In following the cooking directions it was way overcooked. But in the final recipe it was fine. This ones a keeper!

I had to use a bigger dish, it filled a 3qt casserole the first time and a 9x13 to the brim the second. I like it saucy so I used 2 cans of soup...celery and chicken with herbs, but not much more milk. I used 15oz of frozen broccoli florets, cooked per pkg and cut up smaller. I tried to follow the other measurements as shown. I save 1/4 of the crumbs and 1/3 of the sauce when I layer. I push and twist my spoon down through the layers to get it just slightly mixed down together, then add the saved crumbs, spread the last of the sauce over it, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. I like to get a little topping crust on top so the 13x9 pan maximized that. I had to take this to an all afternoon buffet, so after it was baked the night before and refrigerated, I spooned it into a crockpot.

This was a delicious way to use our Thanksgiving leftovers.  I used Cream of Chicken soup because that was all I had, but the flavor and texture was very good. It was so easy to make!

Great for using up the meat pickings off the carcass instead of the usual turkey ala king or turkey soup! Easy to put together and very tasty. I added a little extra sage just for my taste buds.

We didn’t have cream of celery, so we substituted cream of chicken and added crisp onion rings to the top. Very good. A great way to get your broccoli!

EASY and DELICIOUS! Didn't have the cream of celery soup on hand, but I always have LOTS of roast turkey in the freezer. Used cream of chicken, and otherwise followed directions exactly.  I am looking forward to making this with the celery soup! I never like the divan recipes with mayonnaise, but this casserole is cheesy goodness with broccoli mixed in. Perfect!

This was a great use of leftover turkey and the family loved it. I used leftover stuffing and I only had cream of chicken soup on hand. I also used steamed fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Turned out great, thanks for the recipe!

I made a early thanksgiving dinner for my house and turkey left over. The only thing i changed was the cream of broccoli to cream of mushroom. That was all I had. It was delicious

My kids loved it! I tried this out with chicken, the low fat cream of celery and no cheese. I like my stuffing a little drier so next time I will use a little more stuffing, but other than that it's a great recipe. Will be making it with my Thanksgiving leftovers!

I made this recipe but didn't have the herb stuffing so I used cornbread stuffing that I had on hand.  My family really enjoyed this recipe and I thought it was even better the next day.  I think I might try to make it with cooked rice next time instead of the stuffing.  It's great with the stuffing, but I thought it seemed like a great combination with some healthy brown rice.  Certainly nice comfort food for our family.
