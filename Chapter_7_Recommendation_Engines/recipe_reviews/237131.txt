Delizioso! My family enjoyed this one. I didn't have as much mozzarella as I thought so I had to sub in a little cheddar. Yum. I only used the 1/2 cup bread crumbs as in the recipe and I think it was the perfect amount. It turned out very moist however it was swimming in grease when it came out so I removed it from the loaf pan quickly. I liked using tomato sauce, thought it added a nice zip to the meatloaf. Thanks Lori!

I searched for this because I had mozerella, but no cheddar needed for the Ribbon Meat Loaf from this side.  We love Italian, and this quickly helped me to enjoy meat loaf, what I NEVER had.  My husband ate so much I was worried we would have a Meatloaf Explosion!!

We found the meatloaf to be very flavorful.  I absorbed the grease with paper towels.

This meatloaf is easy to make and surprised those in the family that thought they could not like meatloaf. Everyone enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe

Tastes great but very oily and messy.  I think I'll stick with regular meatloaf instead of stuffed with cheese.
