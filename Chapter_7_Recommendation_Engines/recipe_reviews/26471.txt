Sooooper-nummy!  I was thrilled to find a recipe with lentils and curry... I was tempted to make it vegetarian (for my BF's sake), but instead relented and added 2 breasts of chicken.  This is the best soup I've made.  I didn't have fresh veggies (except the asparagus), so I added some frozen bagged mixed vegetables (corn, peas, carrots, lima beans), and a bag of stir fry peppers/onions.  I think I need to make this more often.. Who wants to do my dishes?

This came out pretty well, I used prepared lentils which cut down the time spent cooking. I also used a lot more curry and I think it might have over shadowed the other flavors too much. The timing of cooking the vegetables is difficult because in the end there are some that are overcooked. Don't add the peppers until the very last minute!

I never thought I would like lentils but this is wonderful. It does get thick. You can thin it or just leave it alone. I like it thick.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this recipe was just not very good.  Way too sweet.
