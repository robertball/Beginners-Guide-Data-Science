Necessity is the mother of invention. I had no steamer so I put the cake pan on an inverted pie plate in my electric frying pan, filled the pan with water (not quite touching the cake pan), and cooked it for 25 minutes at 325F. Perfect! This cake is so sweet that I would prefer less sugar in the whipped cream, and more than 1 cup of cream.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for two reasons. A 5 for ease. And, a 5 for yummy-ness! After  reading the reviews, I decided to use my electric skillet instead of trying to convert to the baking method. It worked wonderfully. I'm posting a picture of the cooking method, not the the finished product, because i think this is a recipe worth making and cooks should not pass on this recipe or be intimidated to try the ELECTRIC Skillet method. This Shortcake recipe is a WINNER!!! I've made it 3 times now and it has been eaten gone each time. I will NEVER buy those little grocery store shortcakes again!

I didn't steam it. I cooked it for 25 minutes on 325. It turned out pretty good!

I found that this was the worst tasting cake ever. I usually find great recipes from allrecipes.com but not this time. I tried making it as a birthday snack and found that it tasted like rubbery bread and the amound made was not enough. Maybe it is just my opinion since the other reviews gave it a 4.

I changed it a little, by placing my strawberries on top, sprinkling with sugar snd then baking.  The strawberries become sticky and yummy.  Served with fresh strawberries and cream, it was a real hit with my family.

My cake came out very dense and improperly baked. When I flipped it over the center was still raw. I don't think 3 eggs are necessary. The taste of it is very eggy. I would only use 2 eggs or perhaps beat 2 eggs whites with an electric mixer and then add a whole egg. One cup of sugar is too much. I think this recipe could have used some baking powder. I will try this again with some modifications and see if I'm right.

It did not cook properly.  I am trying to resurrect it now, I will not serve a rubber cake to my family.
