This is a great recipe. I added a bit of garlic salt, half of a red onion, and cooked the shrimp in beer and Old Bay to add flavor. I topped it with sprinkled freshly grated parmesan. Yummy:)

It wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  But I used frozen salad shrimp.  I thought that maybe if I grill the shrimp next time, it will taste much better.

This reciope is a good basic start. I added 2T. capers, 1/4c celery, 1/4c onion,1 cup broccoli (lightly steamed) a handful of red and green chopped pepper two dashes of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp dijon mustard and lemon juice, toss it all together and shred cheddar cheese on top and toss again...it was great!

Gosh didn't like this at all..   lacked so much flavor, and didn't like the "soft" texture it had.   I agree it needed celery, and onion for "crunch".     The Mayo did nothing for the taste...   Again just a very  poor receipe..   Sorry..      Best cooking to you.......

Very light salad, as a main dish or side dish.  

May need a little moe mayonaise, depending on taste.

This was just ok, though the kids really seemed to enjoy it, hence the four stars.   I thought it was a little dry and thought it might do better with a flavored mayo.  Roasted pepper maybe??

Simple and elegantly good! I sauted the shrimp in olive oil and butter while the corkscrew pasta cooked. I'll be making this again and again - thanks!

Added more mayo, a little lemon juice, garlic and onion powder, and diced celery. Delicious light salad for dinner. Very easy to make. Will make it again.

This is quite bland. Adding some diced onion, celery and some Cajun seasoning would perk this up.

Recipe is exactly as described in the title. It is simple. 
Nothing fancy.
A great base that you can add your own spices to.

As with most cold pasta salads, if you can, let it sit in the frig for a few hours before serving, or better yet, over night so the flavors can blend is your best choice.

This is by far the best shrimp pasta dish I have ever have. I boiled my shrimp and put the mayo in by taste. I love this dish and will probably be making it for a while.

I made it, it tasted great! You may want to add a secondary sauce along with the mayo to add flavor

Tastes really good.  I added a little more mayo, lime juice, and seafood boil to spice it up.   Will try it again and use diced chicken breast next time.

It was very simple to make. I added more salt and a little bit more mayo and it was a hit.
