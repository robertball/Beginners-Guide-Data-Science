Tried this last night for company.  Everyone really liked it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing I omitted was the celery because I forgot to pick some up.  It definitely had a kick to it, but it wasn't too spicy for any of us. I served it with french bread and it was great.  I agree with the previous reviewer that the sausage should be browned first and then sliced for presentations sake.  I sliced it raw and the sausage fell apart while browning.  Overall, we really enjoyed this recipes and will make again.  Thanks!

This was wonderful!  Full of flavor and perfect for a cold rainy night!  Only change I made was I used kielbasa instead of italian sausage.  My husband said it was just as good as the Gumbo we had in New Orleans!

DEEE-LISH! This was so good and made so much that I shared with many friends. Everyone loved it, and it was so colorful and the most presentable gumbo I've ever seen. (My mom's is tasty but looks gross) I broiled the italian sausage links, then sliced and added to the chicken in the pot. I only used one onion, chicken bouillon granules & water instead of canned broth, and I also spiced it up a bit more with Old Bay seasoning and a Cajun seasoning I use on just about everything. I cooked the rice separately and poured the gumbo over it to serve. I can't wait to make this again, next time I'm keeping it all for my family and not sharing!

I didn't change a thing and made this recipe exactly as posted - it turned out brilliantly!! This is definite keeper, especially for the winter months. It wasn't too spicy, so if you like a little more bite, increase the cayenne pepper. I used 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper and spicy italian sausage and didn't find it too over-powering.

My family loved this.  I cooked the chicken ahead and threw it all in a crock pot.  Added the last 3 ingredients as we walked in the door and by the time the table was set and we were ready to eat it was ready to serve.

My guests and I loved this but I'm saving the fifth star for a roux-based gumbo.  I used Aidels chicken andouille sausage instead of Italian which gave off enough heat to cut back on the cayenne.  Otherwise, made as directed.  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

Awesome!  I made a few minor changes to go with what I had on hand.  It was the very best I've ever had - even my husband who turned up his nose had 2 large bowls and asked for more the following day!  Thanks for the recipe!

Not wanting to spend the time to make an authentic gumbo, and having leftover roasted chicken and kielbasa, I decided this was an interesting dish to make on a cold day. I didn't add okra since we don't like the texture.  This dish was very good and quite easy to make.  I think the kielbasa provided a more authentic taste than Italian sausage.  And because I didn't have all the spices on hand, I used the equivalent of Emeril's seasoning.  The gumbo had a nice combination of broth to "goodies", and had a rich, brown color as if a roux had been made. I cut the kielbasa into rounds, and added the leftover chicken and cooked shrimp last, just long enough to warm them.  The gumbo definitely had some kick, and I will make it again.  Thanks for a very good recipe!

I loved this so much I created a user profile just to review this.  I absolutely LOVED this.  I skipped the Okra only for fear I wouldn't like it.  I also used smoked hot sausage from the deli and this turned out sooooo Good!!!  The only reason I have leftovers is because I doubled the batch.  5 of us put a hurtin' on this!!!!

Wanted something different to make than my usual fare.  Had sausages and chicken, and rice and shrimp, so this sounded perfect.  Had to modify it some, because as usual, I didn't have everything it called for and didn't want to go back out to the store.  Didn't have chicken broth, so used water and beef boullion instead.  Didn't have any celery or okra either, but that's okay because they're kinda gross anyways. (LOL!) Used three cloves of real garlic instead of powder, no marjoram or thyme so used italian seasoning instead.  Used white rice and defrosted some frozen cooked shrimp.  Didn't measure the cayenne, might have added a bit more.

Knew I had to thicken it up with something, as I was omitting the okra, so added a can of Heinz Baked Beans (yes, it was good!).  

When this recipe was almost done, I realized it needed more rice, so I tossed in some Minute Rice as well (too late by then to add and cook more 'real' rice).   

As well, at the very end, I added some Bisto Chicken Gravy granules to thicken it up a bit more.  

With these modifications this wasn't a very runny soup, but was still wet enough to dip toasted bread in but was not as thick as a stew. 

Was too spicy for our 2 year old, and both kids complained about the shrimp (all the more for us!). We both loved it and will make it again.

Although I left out a few items, I don't think it was lacking at all.  One thing to note though, this made SIX good sized bowls of soup, not SIXTEEN as indicated.

This is a good recipe! Plus it is versatile enough to be tweaked to suit your tastes. I have young children so I had to omit the heat. And I wanted to make it healthier so I used brown rice. Plus, I am a Cajun food freak, so I cooked the veggies with the meat and made a rue with the drippings, and instead of plain diced tomatoes I found Huntz makes fire roasted diced tomatoes, which added even more flavor.

We make dinner with friends every weekend and last winter it was decided that we were going to make gumbo.  We compared many recipes and ended up using this one.  We have been making it quite frequently ever since - it is a favorite with everyone.  Where the recipe calls for Italian sausage, we have used everything from Italian sausage to Kielbasa to cheddar bratts - whatever we have on hand.  No matter what we have used, it has always turned out absolutely wonderful.  We also typically use 2 pounds of shrimp - after all, can you really have too many shrimp in anything?  The only real change we make to this recipe is to the amount of brown rice we use.  The first time we made it, we did use 2/3 cup as directed.  There was a lot of liquid, which is probably how gumbo is supposed to be, but we decided to up the amount of rice for more substance.  Since a 14 oz. box of natural whole grain brown rice calls for over 4 cups of liquid, it is perfect with the 3 cans of chicken broth.  I have never tried an authentic gumbo, so I don't have anything to compare this recipe to, but as far as a recipe that just hits the spot with its wonderful flavor and textures - this is a hit!  Try it - you won't be disappointed!

Really, really good, but Gumbo without Rue?  I love this recipe and will make again, but I did make a major change.  After cooking the meat and then veg and removing both to a crockpot to keep warm, I made a nice dark rue out of oil and flour.  I lived in NOLA too long not to make this traditional and as is this is soup and not gumbo.  After the rue was dark stirred in warm broth and then finished out as directed in recipe.  LOVED it!!  Oh and I served over jasmine rice and didn't do the brown rice.

This was a big hit with my family.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but substituted clam juice for some of the broth, and added a touch (no more than 1/2 tsp) of gumbo file at the end.  Andouille would work well for sausage substitute.  Good stuff!

YUM..  this is easy and fabulous tasting.  Cut the recipe in 1/2, used canned okra/tom/corn combo at the end.  As a thickener I used 1/2 cup of Gumbo file.  I served with Uncle Bens steam in bag cooked brown rice.  And used smoke sausage instead of Italian.  Also, 2 tbls  of creole seasoning instead of the spices.  THANKS FOR SHARING

I have made this recipe twice - once with sausage and shrimp and once with just chicken.  This is a really good recipe.  The flavor of the sausage adds so much more to this dish.  It was a great mixture of flavors.    Update:  10/13/09 I made this dish again with the sausage, chicken and shrimp and it was the best!  I removed the casings from my sausage and that made the texture better.  I also cooked the rice separately and poured the gumbo on top.  This is definitely a keeper.  My parents and my friends enjoyed this a great deal!

This is so good! I changed the recipe to use Andouille sausage instead of Italian, and I didn't have marjoram or thyme, so I used basil & parsley but it's a hit with the family. Thanks!

I made just as listed and it was  GREAT.  My wife even likes it and that is the greatest compliment.  She is not like Mikey and is very hard to cook for.

I made this for dinner last night.   It was delicious.  I did change a few things, no okra, so I substituted some zucchini, used fresh minced garlic instead of powder and added some black beans.  Very flavorful and easy.  In fact my husband and I ate the WHOLE thing (I had reduced it to 8 serving, but still!!!)  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was fabulous! My husband who doesn't like gumbo, actually like this. Why? The okra isn't cooked until it's slimy.  I used reduced fat italian turkey sausage, baby shrimp (I hate tails), and it turned out great.  Hearty too!

We really liked this recipe.  My parents thought it was a little spicy as did my 2 & 4 year old, who had to eat something else.  Used spicy Italian sausage and 3 C okra.  Rice took longer than 20 minutes to soften and was all at the bottom of the pot.  Would consider cooking the rice on the side and adding at the end or serving the soup over the rice as another reviewer suggested. Very good soup overall!

I'm usually a failure in the kitchen, but I managed this recipe with ease! Simple and tasty. The only thing to note, I doubled the cayenne because me and my boyfriend like spice... not a great idea in retrospect. It was a bit on the hot side, the 1/2 tsp called for in the recipe is plenty for a nice kick.

This is a really delicious dish.  I used fresh tomatoes and okra, and 3 minced garlic cloves instead of powder.  Also used 64 oz of broth (my containers are 32oz), so I upped the veggies & rice accordingly.  Left everything else the same.  My whole family (toddlers included) loved this gumbo.  This will be going on my monthly menu plan, and I've shared the link on Facebook.

I've had gumbo many times and this was my first time cooking it. I followed the recipe exactly. I only put a full tsp. of Cayenne and garlic powder. It was the best I've ever had. I wanted to invite the world to diner.

I made a few slight changes such as using Italian seasoning in place of the marjoram, adding Tony Cachere's seasoning to taste and using diced tomatoes w/chilies. This gumbo was awesome! I took it to a church function and everyone was raving!!

Not authentic but lower in fat and easier to make than the traditional recipe. I always burn roux so it was nice to find a recipe that didn't require one. Still quite tasty though and will make again.

This is one easy and tasty recipe as is! Thought the heat was just right. Everyone in the family (kids and hubby) ate it up - even the okra! I did add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up though. GREAT recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe several times. Use fresh garlic not powder. I added more chicken broth. Instead of italian sausage I used chorizo and this really makes the Gumbo. Cook the day ahead and let sit over night and the next day the flavor is awesome. Use brown rice...we all could use the extra fiber and truly the kids won't know the difference.  I have high blood pressure and used no sodium chicken broth and tomatoes.  Still tastes awesome because the chorizo has  sodium in it.

I used Italian HOT Sausage and omitted the cayenne.  It would have been fine for me, but not with kids. I cut the sausage before I browned it and it didn't fall apart and presentation didn't look that bad. At first it looked like a minestrone soup, but I let it cook on the stove for a while. What happened was the Okra actually fell apart and thickened the gumbo. Which is good, because when I first added the Okra and tasted it a few minutes later, it still had a nice crunch to it. Then after a little more time went by it started tasting slimy.  I'm glad that it did what it did, because like I said, it made the gumbo thick and YUMMY.  I read some gumbo basics and it said that a roux or okra was necessary for gumbo. I am assuming for the thickening effect. If I were making this for my kids I wouldn't use the hot sausage.  Great recipe though. I will make it for adults next time and add some more heat with the cayenne.

Wow!  This is probably the best recipe I have ever made from allrecipes.com or anywhere.  It was absolutely delicious.  It tastes like restaurant quality.  I made a few slight tweaks.  Added 1t basil, 1t salt, 1/2t pepper, 1t parsley; I used a green bell pepper instead of the red pepper since its more authentic from what I understand.  Then I cooked the rice (Jasmine) separately.  After the rice cooked, I sprinkled a little lemon & lime juice on it, and cut a roma tomato in slices onto the rice --and garnished w/parsley flakes.  Omgsh!

I loved this recipe!  Of course... I'm from New England and I have never had Gumbo but I was very happy because I have always LOVED Okra;  it added a nice thickness to the meal.  If I was to change anything I would have pre-cooked the rice in my rice cooker to speed up the recipe a bit, I think the rice took too long to cook but probably because I stirred it a few times.  I also added some creole seasoning but pretty much stuck to the recipe.  Thank you very much- an easy introductory recipe!

Not quite gumbo but great none the less.  You have to change the ingredients to your taste.  The second time I made it I used Cajun seasoning and not oregano.  i also use a green pepper the second time because I thought the red was a little overpowering or maybe I used to much..  A great recipe to put you own touches on.

I  made this as our Thanksgiving opening course and it was a huge hit!  I grilled the chicken breast and I doubled the brown rice.  It was perfect for us.  If I could give it six stars I would.  Makes a TON.

This recipe is the best gumbo I have ever made.  I have made it several times, my family loves it.  I use andouille sausage and skip the okra and it is still wonderful!!

Good Gumbo. Served with Shrimp Cocktail and homemade Cocktail Sauce - Sweet Chili Sauce, Horseradish, and 1/2 Lemon. (I was too lazy to go out and buy it.)

This is VERY good Gumbo! To think, my day started with the idea of preparing a simple tomato/okra/corn side dish...but when I read the ingredient list, I realized I already had everything and figured I'd just go for it. So glad I did! I followed this recipe to the letter and found that the prep time was alot shorter than I anticipated and overall it was VERY easy to prepare and quite Delicious. The only thing I'd change would be to cut the Cayenne Pepper in half or even into a third. This dish has plenty of flavor even if you didn't add any Cayenne. Serve with a good bread and simple salad. Everyone LOVED it! Even my picky 16 year old!

Great recipe for potlucks, as it is good, but something different. For at home for the family or with guests, I  serve it with corn and/or ginger breads with honey butter. Nothing else is needed for a great meal.

Love it.  After I sautéed everything I put it in the slow cooker for about two hours!!  I will quote my 9 year old son, “this is magical.”  It is even better the second day but there is seldom enough left for leftovers.

This is the best gumbo ever.... every time I make it I love it never comes out wrong. I always use sweet Italian sausage links but I cut them up and make little meat balls out of them, brown them then I throw the chicken in and cook the rest as the recipe says. Pair it with some home made corn bread... perfecto! Family loves it.. although it requires a nap afterwards... :) definitely great comfort food on a cold day.

There were absolutely no leftovers when I made this for a family New Orleans dinner! There was only one minor change I made- I left out the okra. I live in New York and it was very difficult to find it, but the dish worked well without it. Just enough spice to be PERFECT. Making it again for this years Mardi Gras. Also, make sure to either make or buy some fresh Italian bread, it really makes the gumbo.

A little on the spicy side but really good. I used ground italian sausage instead of the links.

My family loves this recipe.  I even cheat a bit and just use ground sausage and ground turkey instead of the chicken.  Not as authentic, but still so yummy!  Leftovers are nearly as good as fresh too.

This was so surprisingly good, I had to leave a review... Haven't had gumbo in over 14 years and have only had it once in New Orleans.  My little girl had just watched 'princess and the Frog' and begged me to make gumbo with her so the search began... This was better than the original gumbo I had and was So easy to throw together, I had all the ingredients on hand aside from the shrimp. Only changed a few minor things...used smoked turkey sausage instead, cut back on the cayenne and added a few dashes of Louisianna hot sauce instead. Also, I cut the raw chicken into big chunks and when it was all cooked, I shredded it into smaller chunks to let the chicken absorb more sauce. Served with sliced tomatoes and Louisianna hot sauce on the side.

This was truly excellent.  I had to make some substitutions based on what I had in the kitchen (fresh tomatoes instead of canned, etc.) and the recipe held up very well.  I highly recommend it!

My family LOVED this!  The only ingredient substitutions I made were 2 fresh garlic cloves sauteed with the onion, bell pepper and celery instead of garlic powder added with the marjoram and thyme, turkey kielbasa, and brown rice.  Dad said this one is a repeat!

So good! I put it all in my crockpot except for shrimp I stirred that in before serving. Also used frozen bag of french cut green beans instead of okra, andouille sausage, and a can of rotel for the diced tomatoes.

This recipe was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! (except the fact that okra is gross and slimy - next time I will omit.)  I followed the directions exactly and it was a HUGE hit with family and friends- they even wanted to take leftovers home! 
I'm not a good cook in any way, but the way my guests raved about this dish made me feel like an expert. This is permanently in my recipe box - and I will make it again...and again...and again.
Oh, and I made some corn bread to go with it. Yum!

quite tasty.  I prepared the rice ahead of time and added chicken broth to the soup to the consistency that I wanted.  I added raw shrimp for the very last few minutes to that they were not over cooked.  Fantastic.

This was such a hit!  I made it for a potluck at work and they decided that they are all going to pool together every month to have me make it.

This is an excellent roux-less gumbo, perfect for when you want gumbo but dont have the time required to make it.

This was my first time making gumbo. As a child watching my Mama make gumbo convinced me to never attempt the task. It isn’t Mama’s recipe but she would be proud. This recipe was very easy to make and delicious. I used half the required amount of cayenne pepper and tripled the ingredients; it served 27 men, women and children. Everyone loved it! This recipe not only made me popular with family, friends, and neighbors it’s given me confidence to join the elite club of “Gumbo Braggers”. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Best gumbo recipe I've made. My husband, who is not a gumbo fan, loved it as well as my 3 year old. Will make this again.

This recipe was delicious!!!  I omitted the brown rice & added some homemade cheesy polenta/grits upon serving, which added an even more hearty element to the gumbo.  I also added some cajun & old bay seasonings.  Made me want to take a trip to the "big easy!"

This was fabulous! Even better the second day.  I used green beans instead of okra & boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts (just what I had on hand).  Will definitely make again!!

The best! I follow the recipe exactly except I use fresh garlic, some of Emeril's Bayou Blast, some Crystal hot sauce (or Tabasco) , fresh parsley and a pinch of sugar. The brown rice takes about 45 minutes to cook in the soup, not 20. This recipe is so great, I always make it for company.

I am sure the recipe would have been great just the way it is written, but I never seem to have all the correct ingredients so I have to make substitutions. I didn't have red peppers so I used green peppers (small change there) I used tomatoes with chipotle peppers and less cayanne pepper. I also used andouille sausage instead of italian sausage. Plus I used regular white rice (a whole cup) instead of brown rice which I didn't have. I didn't have any frozen okra either, but had a can of canned okra so that worked out okay too. Anyhow, my whole family found this recipe really yummy and will make it again in the near future.

My family loved it!! And my 11 year old promptly rewrote her birthday menu to say "Gumbo" as the main dish! That says a lot.  I followed the recipe exactly except:  put in only 1/4 teaspoon cayenne (red) pepper, my cans of chicken broth were only 14 oz., and my bag of frozen okra was 16 oz. (which was more than 2 cups when cut but that was okay), and my bag of frozen uncooked shrimp was 12 oz. (I put the shrimp in frozen). I also simmered the whole pot for about 3 hours after it was ready, but that was fine too.  My husband wanted it more spicy, but my kids (11,14,16) said it was just right.  He brought out the Frank's Hot Sauce and after trying some in her bowl, my 11 yr. old said to make sure I told you to add a few drops to yours :)  I would say the recipe makes about 8 - 10 servings.

This was delicious and so easy. I used precooked andouille sausage and a bag of peeled shrimp. Perfect. Sauteed the sausage with the veggies to start. I added brown rice, but it took 45 mins to cook. White rice would shorten the time.

Holy Moly.  This was incredible!  I omitted the chicken and red pepper because I just didn't want them in it.  I doubled the spices. (I like things spicy.)  Added 3 cups okra.  Added a little more celery.  I was planning on taking this to a work potluck, but now I think I'll keep this and take something else to work.  Boyfriend isn't home yet to try it, but even if he doesn't like it (he won't eat vegetables)  I'll make it again just for me.

I felt like I was doing something good for myself while I was eating this!  I used low-fat, low-sodium broth, turkey sausage, and olive oil.  It was so yummy!  I've never had gumbo, but this was really good.  I also liked that I didn't have to fuss with a roux.  The chicken broth was so easy!  Since I can't handle hot things, I only used 1/8th teaspoon of cayenne.  It wasn't quite enough.  FYI--(in case you, like me, don't know) Cayenne is also called red pepper.
