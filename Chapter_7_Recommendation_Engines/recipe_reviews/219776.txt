This is wonderful, and is a very versatile recipe.  I was looking for something I could make from ingredients on hand, used regular cabbage instead of savoy, no parsnip - so I shredded up some of the cabbage, no Italian dressing - I used italian spices instead.  I went light on the cheese, to keep calories down.  This dish had a real comfort food feel, like lasagne, but with more veggies.  My husband loved it.

I made this vegan by using TVP reconstituted in tomato bouillon. Didn't have a parsnip so added chopped sweet red pepper and some minced garlic. Instead of the paste, sauce and dressing, I used an organic spaghetti sauce. Everyone enjoyed this. Sadly, no leftovers.

This recipe was ok day I made it, fantastic the next days. It doesn't have nearly enough cabbage for me. I will just buy a head of regular and shred to make it easy. We like spicy and I had a hard time not adding, but the next day, it didn't need anything but salt. I did use already precooked rice (2 cups precooked rice = 1 cup instant) so I adjusted the liquid a bit, but not much. My husband got mad because I managed to eat most of it before he got around to it. Making it again tonight.

Took this to a family dinner and it was a huge hit! I only made a few minor changes. I just a full can of tomato paste, I shredded the cabbage (I used about half a head), and used slightly less tomato sauce.

I have always loved cabbage rolls but didn't make them often due to rolling and no one eating the cabbage. This is an awesome, easy, way to have a cabbage roll dinner. And the kids eat the cabbage

Nice meal for during the week! I used low fat cheese and brown rice to keep calorie count down. I also used regular cabbage, I cut the head in half, salted, peppered and and baked on greased cookie sheet for 20 minutes at 420. The leaves peeled off nicely and were delicious, I salted and peppered each layer of cabbage as I built my dish! Yumm

Would use regular cabbage if I made this again as I did not care for the texture of the savoy cabbage, otherwise great flavor.

We enjoyed this. I used one large can of crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and paste. And I used half a head of regular cabbage. I par-boiled it in the microwave for about 10 minutes, before layering.
