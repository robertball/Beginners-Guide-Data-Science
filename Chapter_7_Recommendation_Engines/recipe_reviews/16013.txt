This dip is great anytime - not just March 17 - keep the ingredients on hand and then whip it up when you need dip.  It does need to chill for about 2 hours so the dry spices absorb moisture.  The following changes will reduce the saltiness...  use all sour cream (no mayo), omit the onion salt and MSG, increase the minced onion.  See my photo for a fun way to organize veggies like an Irish Flag.

I didn't use the MSG or the hot pepper sauce.  It was a hit.

Not enough freshness, more sour creme, more dill (I used fresh dill) and a dash of lemon juice made this recipe more appealing.  I would possibly remove the msg from this recipe, as the dip was somewhat overpowering.

This is a great dip.  I used to buy Knorr Herb Dip but they stopped making it, and this recipe is an exact replacement for that mix.  I found it to be a bit too salty for my tastes, so I may reduce the salt next time.  Other than that it is great!

Placing the dip within the green pepper makes it a great presentation for a dinner with an Irish theme.  The dip was wonderful and great on crackers.  It was a big hit with my 2 year old daughter!

This was a very good dip. I used fresh dill, more than was called for in the recipe and it turned out well. I loved the idea of serving the dip in the pepper, it definately added to the presentation! I found the dip a little salty and next time I will use all sour cream and no mayo. All in all a good dip!

This is not only the best dip I have ever made, it is also the easiest. I have made it now three times. Every time I get rave reviews. The best thing about this recipe is that I can make it on a minutes notice. It is great with crackers, chips, and fresh vegis. My husband and friends thank you for submiting it!

I used lowfat mayo, FF sour cream, eliminated the seasoning salt and used just a pinch of sea salt, used onion powder instead of onion salt and didn't add the MSG. Tasty! Used this today to dip my veggies in and plan on thinning down the rest with lowfat buttermilk for our salads tonight. NOTE: After trying it, I added a clove of fresh minced garlic.

This was a delicious and quick dip for chips and veggies at our Rose Bowl party.  I really liked the addition of worcestershire sauce, adds a nice flavor.  I skipped the MSG.  Thanks St. Patty, you brought my Buckeyes a Rose Bowl victory!

I thought this dip was really good. I just couldn't figure out why it says to add MSG. There are so many people who react badly to it, so I just eliminated it. Another great tip... I added dried mint to the dip.... It was fantastic! Mint can be harder to find but worth the search!

I made this and the Ireland Flag veggie tray for my Bunco party on St. Patrick's day. It was easy to make and well liked by all. My husband thought the flavor that the dip absorbed from the green pepper made the dip extra special.

This was very good...a little on the salty side but nothing we couldn't handle.  Next time I think I'll cut back on the seasoning salt. Also, I left out the MSG and hot sauce. Thank you for a dip easy to make with things you have on hand!!

As someone else mentioned, this dip came out very salty, even without adding the seasoning salt.  Next time I may cut the onion salt in half and add some additional minced onion instead.  But it is a tasty dip and a change from your standard fare.  I would make it again.

This is little salty for my taste, and you can really taste the Worcestershire sauce.  It does taste good, but did not go over well at my company potluck.  Too many other options I guess!

No MSG, reduced season. salt to a healthy dash, dash of onion powder in place of o. salt.  Little extra W. sauce.  Mmmm.  Excellent dip, bring on the chips!

We loved this.  Skipped the MSG and added some lemon juice.  Boyfriend was so tickled that I served it in a green pepper.  (I originally wasn't going to, but stuff like that pleases him, so I did.  As soon as he opened the pepper he said, "Oh you do love me!  There is dip!  In a pepper!"  He is kind of weird sometimes.)
