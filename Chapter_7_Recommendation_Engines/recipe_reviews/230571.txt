This was the absolute best recipe!!  I  followed the recipe exactly, did not change a thing,  and it came out wonderful!  The crumb crust was delicious.  This is a pie that I will make again!  A definite keeper!

Used pears and apples since I didn't have enough pears. Added some lemon preserves to the fruit mixture for added flavor and added chopped pecans to the topping. Very flavorful. Only complaint is that it was too juicy. Next time I'll add corn starch to the fruit mixture.

Delicious. Even my dad, who isnâ€™t a big fan of pears, enjoyed it. Ginger can be added instead of nutmeg.

It was very good.  Fresh Nutmeg is a must.  Next time a little less sugar.

This was really good.  My pears seemed a bit juicy, so I added just a little bit of flour to the pears before putting the crumb topping on.  I also added a bit of ginger to the crumb topping.  The only complaint I have is that it was still very wet after baking causing a bit of sogginess, but the flavor was delightful. I love that it wasn't a pear pie trying to be an apple pie.
