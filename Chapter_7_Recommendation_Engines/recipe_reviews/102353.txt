Sinfully delicious chocolatey goodness. The best way to describe this incredibly rich chocolate cookie is like a truffle but it is a cookie. The outside gets a delicate thin crisp shell with the inside keeping an incredible softness that melts in your mouth like fudge. I covered and kept my extra baked cookies in the fridge and the next day they still had this consistency. The batter is very loose until well chilled (you need more than an hour) and then is able to be worked with as instructed (I chilled mine overnight). Don't overbake ... cookies will set up. I didn't have dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder which is acid-neutralized and used Hershey's natural unsweetened which was still good. The nut, chips and raisin combination perfectly compliment one another and there isn't anything I would change for this recipe except to double it to make more, more, more!!

As a cookie...maybe but as a brownie....Perfection!!! crusty yummy outside; fudgey, soft, chewy inside. I put dough in a small baking dish and baked it for about 25 minutes and they are sensational. Chocolate overload heaven! Definitely making the double batch next time. I can hardly keep my hands out of the pan so my girls can have some when they get home from school!

For a chocoholic family, this recipe meets the criteria of very very chocolatey. However, after chilling one hour, the dough was quite sticky to work with. When baked, they were a more "cakey" style cookie. I prefer something crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This cookie is soft all the way, with a tendancy to be crumbly. I still gave this four stars simply because of the uber "chocolatey" flavor. The texture left me feeling that something was missing.

If you are a chocoholic, you will love these cookies!  I omitted both the nuts and raisins however.  The recipe suggests parchment paper, but I strongly recommend it.  I made the first batch having sprayed Pam on my cookie sheet, and the cookies splat because of the grease and were very flat.  The next batch I placed on parchment paper, and these looked like totally different cookies.  By the way, one recipe makes a dozen cookies.  I am thinking that next time I may stir in mini nonpareils instead of the chips.

I loved them, but would leave out the raisins next time for my dh's sake.  The dough is like brownie batter and when chilled overnight it was too hard to scoop, yet when softer is sticky to work with.

Unbelievable!!  Best chocolate cookie I ever ate.  I'm so glad you posted this recipe.  I made it exactly as you said and they came out perfect.  They do spread and they are very soft and gooey but if you put them in the fridge for a bit they are wonderful!!  I like my chocolate on the chilled side anyway and these cookies are perfect for that.  Wonderful ... thank you!!

The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it makes so few cookies.  The batter went together well and baked up well.  Even at high altitude 14 minutes was the perfect baking time.  The only thing I did different was to use chocolate chunks instead of chips, because I like encountering big chunks of chocolate in my cookies.  The first tray I forgot to flatten the balls, but in the end I liked the way that tray came out better than when I flattened them just a little.  I'm still debating whether or not to include the raisins next time I make these - they provide an interesting surprise in the cookies, and in the final analysis I think I like that.  This is a great recipe, a real keeper.  I will be making it again, and definitely doubling it.

These are quite good, but not spectacular.  The dough was scrumptious, but the flavor kind of faded upon baking.  I think to get the really wonderful chocolate flavor in a chocolate cookie, you have to use a lot of the bar chocolate~~the 60-70 per cent cocoa, really expensive chocolate in bars.  But these were pretty good.  The set up nicely and looked attractive.  Don't know if I'd make them again, though.  If I do, I'd add a few more chocolate chips and nuts to make them even chunkier.

These were very chocolaty and very sweet.  It doesn’t make a lot of cookies, however if you are a chocoholic and need a fix – here you go.

This is a dark chocolate cookie with a huge chocolate impact. Delicious! I ended up making 24 cookies and still cooked them for 13 minutes.

The only problem with this recipe is that it didn't make enough of these cookies! I will definitely be making a double or triple serving next time. and I dropped the raisins,, it just doesn't seem to go with the rest of it. and i also indulged a little in more chocolate chips :)

These were a great chocolate cookie. Easy to make. Just be careful, I only cooked 13 minutes. Longer and I think they might have burned.

These are good & very easy to make. They are so rich in flavor that I can only eat one. (maybe thats good) One batch only makes 20 cookies, so if you need more than that, do a double batch.

These cookies were sooo yummy...rich, gooey, chocolaty goodness!  I made them for just me and my best friend, so the small batch was perfect for us.  I would definitely make a double or triple batch if I make it for more people.  Will definitely make these again!

A cookie for the true chocolate lover - these are very rich and very delicious.  They taste kind of like a brownie in cookie form.  Instead of the walnuts and raisins, I used white chips and craisins.  The combination is decadent.  I am adding these to my holiday cookie tray.

WOW!! Excellant Chocolate Cookie. Just like something one would find in a top notch bakery. Made a double batch, which gave me 18 cookies. I chilled the dough for a bit more than an hour and used a scoop that held just over 2 tablespoons.  Just scooping the dough and slighly flattening worked perfectly.  I plan on making these over and over again. Thanks for sharing.

Amazing recipe!  and Low Fat!  I trippled the recipe to make 36 cookies.
(one batch makes a dozen) Only put in 2T lowfat spread, 1/3 cup wheat flour (per recipe), omitted nuts.  Threw it all in the kitchen aid mixer and mixed it together, Did NOT chill.  Scooped with a scooper and they baked up perfectly chocolate!  Thank you!!!

These were great.  I used a #60 (2 tsp.) scoop, and kept the dough in the fridge when I wasn't using it and I had no problems with it being too hard to scoop out while cold.  I mailed some to one of my sons and he thought there were cherries in them, maybe I'll try that next time.

Delicious.  The only problem I have is that they are eaten up too quick!  Next time I will double the recipe because hubby and I like a larger cookie and the recipe only made 10 when I scooped with a heaping tablespoon measuring spoon.

With a son far away at college - I have made MANY cookie recipes to send in care packages and this is the ONLY one I have reviewed because it is so very good. I made the recipe as printed - turned out fabulous, chewy inside, delicate crust outside. My son asked me to send them again - the first time he has asked for an encore!  He asked to make it without the raisans, which of course I will. Other reviewers have ommitted the raisans without ill effect of the cookie's consistancy.  Personally, I could not taste any raisan, so if I were making these for myself, I would include the raisans. You can feel confident when you make these!

I just finished baking these lovely cookies and sampled when cool enough.  They look just like the posted pictures with the glossy sheen and visibility of ingredients.  I made several changes but nothing that I think took away from the original recipe.  I used chocolate chips for melting however I used chocolate chunks as the add in.  I used regular unsweetened Hershey cocoa instead of Dutch and salted butter (omitting salt) instead of unsalted.  I diced the raisins into small pieces and probably didn't use the whole 1/3 cup.  I like the raisin addition but don't like to get a whole raisin in a bite.  I mixed everything with a whisk by hand (very easily done) then put my bowl of dough in freezer for 15-20 minutes as I didn't have time to wait the 1 hour in refrigerator.  I doubled the recipe and got 20 cookies per recipe.  I baked for 15 minutes then removed from oven.  I let them cool on cookie sheet for 5-10 minutes before I moved to cooling rack.  They were crispy soft on outside and fudge-y soft inside.  Yum!!!!  I made them for my son as part of his Father's Day gift (he loves chocolate) but I know I will be making these again to share with co-workers and church family.  I don't usually get excited about cookie recipes but this one is a must try.

Yum!  These were so easy to make and they are something you generally have all the ingrediants on hand.  I did eliminate the nuts and raisins though.  My kids thought these were great!

FANTASTIC! Just as someone else said, double or triple the recipe - it doesn't make many, but they are wonderful!

These are great cookies. My wife has a wheat allergy and I replaced the regular flour with a wheat/gluten free flour and the recipe turned out just as described.

WOW!! These are DELICIOUS.  I didn't change a thing. Only got 12 cookies.  Hubby says they taste like a candy bar. We both love the walnut and raisin combo. I baked them for 15 minutes. Next time I'll double the recipe. Planned to take some to church tomorrow but after tasting them I don't think  there will be enough to share??Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is a very good cookie and very easy to make.  I got 14 cookies out of one batch.  I opted for no raisins but loved the walnut addition.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Excellent chocolate cookie.  The best I've had and very easy to make.  I've made these a few times now and everyone loves them.  I did substitute cranberries for the raisins as I didn't have raisins on hand and they turned out delicious.  Thank you for this recipe.

I found these to be quite tasty once baked but they were very hard to form into balls. Worth the effort though!

Awesome cookies! My favorite so far! I'm not a fan of raisins with chocolate so I omitted the raisins entirely and it's chocolate heaven. My only issue is it baked flat. Not sure why (I'm a novice baker) but I'm guessing the dough may need to be chilled again after forming them into balls? In any case, these are now my go-to chocolate cookies.

Great cookie that's fudgy and chewy with a crunchy outer skin).  Use good quality chocolate for the chunks.  I didn't use raisins or pecans.  They were exactly what I was searching for!! The only reason I rated 5 stars is because they were a bother once cold (there is no way you can shape them before chilling as the batter is similar to a brownie batter at that stage).  Next time, I will pour the batter onto plastic wrap and shape into a cylinder then cut up and bake.  Oh, and the ones that were not flattened out after placing on cookie sheet baked thicker and chewier.  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed all directions and they turned out beautifully. Excellent flavor. They come out of the oven puffy and it was fun to watch them crinkle - watching cookies cool?

Like others, I had to double the recipe ... and they still disappear!  My only change (this time) was to use dark chocolate chips to melt with the butter, and then white chocolate chips to fold in to the batter because that's what I had on hand. One of our favorite cookies - thanks for sharing!

Loved these!  Great texture... soft yet chewy.  Rich flavor.. I used extra brute dark cocoa and Hershey bars for the chocolate chips.  I added a bag of mint chips.  Just wonderful!

Amazing! I made it exactly as is and with my own twist. Super soft the next day and tastes delicious. I didn't care for the raisins. 

For my twist, I added chocolate chunks and macadamia nuts. Next time I am going to add more nuts to it so that they are chunkier. I refrigerated the dough for a few hours. I used an ice cream scoop (the one with the release thing in it) to gather the dough, plopped them on the tray and baked for 15 minutes. I didn't flatten them either, which helped them stay a little chunkier after baking. They seemed kind of gooey but that's the key to not over cooking them. 

Definitely tasted like a professionally made cookie!!!

These were so chocolatey and yummy, they hardly even made it to the oven! I used 60% cocoa chips and only used like 2T of butter and they definitely satisfied my chocolate craving!!

This was a "GREAT" recipe, our entire family loved them. I made the recipe as written.  I don't normally like raisins cooked, but they went well with the chocolate.  Our cookies didn't last long enough to cool completely.  I am now making a triple batch right now.

This is a good cookie. I left out the raisins (I don't like them with chocolate). Due to this you need to reduce the baking time to 10-11 minutes.This cookie tastes very brownie-like.

This cookie really delivers deep chocolate flavor and excellent texture. I only added a tsp of Watkins butter extract, otherwise leaving the recipe as written. It produced an intense, chocolatey cookie with a bit of a crinkle like a good brownie. My family loved them and we're adding this to our favorite cookie recipes! Great job! Thank you for sharing.
