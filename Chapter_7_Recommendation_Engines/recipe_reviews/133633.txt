In my small towns, they never heard of broccoli rabe.  So I used broccoli.  The flavors of this dish are wonderful - the richness of the artichoke with the slight sweetness of the roasted red peppers and the saltiness of the sausage... very nice.  The broccoli gives it a nice contrasting color, too, making it very pretty.  It helps, too, that I could serve it in one of my favorite pottery dishes.   The only difference I made besides the broccoli rabe was I used fresh Romano cheese as that is what I have open.   My husband and son gave it a four but I give it the full five!  I will definitely make this again - especially when I have guests over.  It's pretty, simple and delicious!

We used regular broccoli instead of the rabe and regular white onions sauteed instead of the shallots (just had to use what I had).  It was great!  It was a nice change from the regular old thing.  Many recipes are boring, and I find I have to play with recipes to make them more interesting.  Not with this recipe though, the spicy sausage and other ingredients are all you need for full flavor.

We all really enjoyed this recipe. I used regular broccoli, one fresh red pepper that I sauteed (in butter) before adding pre-cooked link style hot Italian sausage. I also used tri-colored spiral pasta since that was all I had. It was nice having a pasta that wasn't heavy on seasonings or sauce, but still had a great flavor.

With all the ingredients listed, you would think that this pasta is very heavy.  Everything blended together perfectly; not too heavy of a meal and not too light.  I personally made only half the amount of farfalle pasta listed. Perfect dinner with a delicious taste!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Wonderful flavors.  This was the first time I have ever had broccoli rabe - it was quite expensive, and it must be an aquired taste.  It was ok - - -.  But the rest of the dish was wonderful!

I made this the other night and my husband and I totally enjoyed it.  I used our favorite Italian link sausage and just removed it from the cassing for the browning of it.  We love marinated artichokes, so I used a very large jar.  That was the only thing I did differently than the receipe stated.  I will make it again and will diffinately serve it for when we have company over. Thanks so much yankeesfan. mbj

I wasn't sure about this recipe because I have never cooked anything with artichokes before but we were pleasantly surprised. Only thing I did different was add some soy sauce on top after being served into bowls. Will make again!

Great! Will make again. Such nice flavours with the artichokes, parmesean, sausage and roasted peppers... these 4 ingredients are a must. I used broccoli and added grape tomatoes and a splash of low fat cream. Thanks for a quick andd tasty recipe!

This was very tasty, I will definitely make it again.  The only downside is that it is a touch dry.  I think next time I will follow the other suggestions and replace the broccoli with spinach, the texture of the broccoli didn't seem to fit with the rest of the dish.

Note: Spinach ended up being pretty bleh, stick with the brocolli rabe :)

This dish was so easy to prepare. I used frozen broccoli because I forgot the fresh stuff when I was at the grocery store:( I did not add any pasta water to moisten as suggested and liked the clean taste without it.  I will definitely make this again. Thank you

This was a really yummy recipe! Had to add a few additional seasonings and a little butter to add some more flavor, but all in all, it was pretty good! We also used Turkey Italian Sausage and Multi Grain Bowtie Pasta to make it a little healthier. I definitely recommend trying this recipe out! I will be making it again! It was easy, yummy, and filling! :)

We all really liked this - even my  2.5 year old! My only modifications were to use a regular onion instead of a shallot and chicken sausage instead of regular sausage. I will definitely be making this again.

My original review of this recipe was from 2009 and since we're closing in on ten years of making this regularly I thought I'd review it again. My family just calls this "Laura pasta" and it's requested frequently. We LOVE it. 
It handles a substitution well. Any onions work in place of shallots. If you must sub for the rabe, please use spinach as it's closer in flavor. Marinated or not, the artichokes are great. Good without too. I've used bowties, mini bowties and orrechetti and they all work great. This is a wonderful meal!

It was perfect.  I loved it.  Edit: I made this again for company. I wasn't sure if they'd like broccoli rob so I used regular broccoli and it was very good. I think adding a little of the juice from the artichoke hearts would make it even more tasty but even without it was good.

To make this dish more healthy I used turkey sausage and whole grain penne pasta. I didn't have fresh broccoli so I substituted frozen. It turned out great. This is definitely a keeper.

Very good!  I used Kale (it is closer to taste and texture than broccoli), since I couldn't find rabe.  I also used spicy Italian CHICKEN sausage.  YUM!  Double the artichoke hearts on this one!  You can use about 8 oz. jarred roasted red peppers and chop them.

It's a nice light flavor pasta dish.  Perfect for the summer.  My husband does not like cream sauce pasta so this is a nice substitute of having marinara sauce all the time.  I would make sure the sausage cook completely through though before tossing all the ingredients.

I like this pasta dish, and sometimes it comes through to fulfill a craving, but when I make it, I make the following changes: 1) broccoli instead of broccoli rabe, as it is much easier to find and very similar. 2)Mild Italian sausage instead of hot. (not a spice person at all) 3)Cut the red peppers.

I used spinach instead of broccoli rabe due to availability, but otherwise changed nothing, and we really liked this. I think next  time I'd use a mild or even a sweet Italian sausage instead of hot, just to be able to taste the veggies more.

I made this dish for a girls night and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly ( I never make changes the first time I make something) but in future I think I will use the liquid from the marinated artichokes to moisten the pasta rather than using the pasta water.  I will certainly make it again.
