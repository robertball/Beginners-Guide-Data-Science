The lemon in this gives the dish a bright flavor and balances the sugar well.  You could pre-cook your carrots and then re-warm and glaze just before serving.  Thanks!

I have made this both as written and tweaked it a bit as well and liked it both ways.  It's great as written and you should definitely try it that way.
 My tweaks... I tend to use packaged baby carrots since we usually have those on hand and it's less prep time than whole carrots.  If you are on a budget, whole carrots are more economical, though.  I also prefer to steam my carrots instead of boiling them, because I like them to be soft but still have a slight crunch. When making the sauce, I tend to also cut back a slight bit on the brown sugar and add a splash of vanilla, but otherwise follow the directions.

We didn't love this. I felt like it was just too sweet. I had even added additional carrots to this. I felt like I was eating some type of candied vegetable holiday side dish. We ate some of it, but unfortunately the rest got tossed. It needed something and butter and brown sugar just didn't work here for us. I am rating it a 3 because maybe someone might like a candied tasting vegetable. I don't care much for overly sweetened sweet potatoes here. I would love to know how others faired with this dish.

We really, really liked this one!  I gave it 4 stars, though, just because I couldn't get the glaze to thicken up a little bit more, and the carrots were starting to get mushy.  It had a fabulous flavor though!  We made with grilled Ham steaks and roasted brussel sprouts.  Will absolutely make again!

I loved it. I put my carrots in top of my rice cooker and cooked them separate. I left of the salt and very little pepper. I never salt anything. If you want it you can put it in yourself.

I used honey because I did not have any brown sugar and I also added a little ginger.

5.23.18   know often when you see butter and brown sugar listed as ingredients that  you think just ordinary glazed carrots again, been there done that, but trust me, these are not your typical glazed carrots.  You’ll be surprised what that  little bit of lemon juice brings to these carrots.  It enhances the flavor and just brings some freshness to what often is an overly sweet side dish.  While I steamed the carrots for 2-1/2 minutes, I melted the butter and brown sugar in a small skillet (omitted salt and  pepper), then drained the carrots, added them to the skillet, and just coated and heated them for a couple of minutes...DONE!  Just one suggestion:  make more because you’ll WANT more.  Simply quick, easy, and most importantly, delicious!

This was good, however not great for us.  Could have been me.  I do know part of it was I didn't cook the carrots quite long enough, will do that next time.  I couldn't get the sweet sauce to really stick to the carrots, not sure what I was doing there.  I will try it again though, is a nice option for a veggie with dinner.

You need the sugar and butter to make a glaze but the lemon cuts through the sweetness.  I added a pinch of curry to it as well which helped as well but curry is extremely strong so be very careful to just use a pinch or it will overpower the dish.
