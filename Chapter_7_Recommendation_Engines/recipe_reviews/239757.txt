Really delicious! I wish I would've read the recipe better b/c I bought reg. mozzarella cheese instead of fresh but it worked out fine (I will get fresh and try them again!). I also topped them w/ a bit of shredded parm. Hubby wouldn't eat this for a main dish (I would) but it sure did make a great tasty side...I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

It was wonderful, the only thing that I changed was not removing the gills of the mushrooms. This is a great and simple recipe.
