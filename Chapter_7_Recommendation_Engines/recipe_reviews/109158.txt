Danke! Thank you for sharing this recipe! My guests and I loved it. Even kids who are picky eaters and don't like fish enjoyed it.  I used about half the butter because I was running low and it was still prefect. Great on water biscuits, Truiscuts and melba toast.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  Everyone loved it, including my children ages 2-10. I used a 15oz can of Mackerel and it was so simple!

We make this ALL THE TIME.   The only difference is that my wife doesn't much care for smoked meats and fish, so we use the canned mackerel.  Very addictive.  Always the first food to disappear at parties.
