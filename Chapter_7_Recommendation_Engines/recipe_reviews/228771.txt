This recipe lives up to it's title.  It is spicy, sweet and tangy.  It is easy to make and very good.  I halved the recipe as I only had a small amount of cooked chicken breast to use up and mixed this sauce in with to make chicken barbecue for dinner.  I think the recipe needs some Worcestershire but that is entirely my personal preference.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

Very good! Followed the recipe as directed and stored the leftovers in a mason jar.  It's a nice balance of sweet with a kick.

I used this in pulled pork, and loved the tanginess of the sauce.  I didn't add any of the white sugar, and only half of the cayenne.

Delicious! Made it to put on chicken and ended up putting it on everything on our plates. Can't comment on the cayenne pepper - we only used a sprinkle and it was enough to give some heat.

This recipe tastes exactly as it's named-spicy, sweet, and tangy.  It was also super easy to make! Definitely using this recipe again!

Love it!    Followed the recipe exactly and stored the extra - Good for basting and marinating.    Sweet and spicy.
