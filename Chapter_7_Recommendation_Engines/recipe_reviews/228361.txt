I hate to waste anything, and when my husband left for work this morning, he says to me "you better do something with those peaches today, or they're going to go to waste"!  So I went to the handy dandy ingredients search, and plugged in peaches and brown sugar.  Wahlah!  Peach cobbler!  I had everything on hand to make this, and just kind of eye-balled the ingredients to scale it down to 4 ramekins.  The filling did spill over a bit (but I had put my ramekins on a cookie sheet - so no problem).  I did end up turning the broiler on for a few minutes to crisp up the top crust a bit.  Served warm with a nice dollop of whip cream!  Yummo!

have to agree with another review, tis more of a crisp than a cobbler.
love the iron skillet idea, but I think the fruit should be cooked only for a minute or two, then put on topping and stick in oven.  I think the peaches were overcooked.

I just took this out of the oven and am eating some now. It is THE BEST peach cobbler I have ever eaten. My man brought me some peaches from SC two days ago and I wanted to make this recipe because I saw it awhile ago and have been waiting to use fresh peaches in it. I love the pecans inside. I did turn the topping a few minutes in to moisten it and that really made a difference! I used the iron skillet and that worked well. I am making some homemade vanilla ice cream tomorrow to go with this!!

More a crisp than a cobbler - Vunderbar! Cook the fruit for only a minute or two to avoid mushiness. Top and bake as directed but:  After a few minutes in the oven, carefully turn the dough in the peach juices 2 or 3 times to moisten the batter. Then continue baking for a total of 30 minutes. NOTE: Canned, drained peaches may be subbed - use 3 cans.

I found the amount of flour to be way too much, or the butter ratio was way too little. My "batter" was more of a totally dry mixture. The juices from the peaches helped with some of that, but not all.  I should have probably only used only one cup of flour, or even less, and baked it for less time. It ended up being pretty dry. I do love the pecans in it. I made mine in a cast iron skillet. I will try this again, but change the amounts, because I love the idea of it.

Excellent! I used can peaches (3 cans) and drained the syrup and it still came out well. May have to drain some more once, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon are mixed in (depends on how runny you like your peach cobbler). Crust was great. I needed 1/2 cup of melted butter for the crust to get oatmeal-ish but this you will have to spot.  Mine needed an additional 10-15 minutes for the crust to harden (probably because of the butter:).  Definitely a keeper.

I found this recipe very disappointing. It was dry and it stuck to the sides of the cast iron skillet.  I won't make it again

This was just the recipe I was looking for, as I didn't want the dry cake/biscuit texture of cobbler.  It turned out juicy and crisp . . delicious.  The pecans just make it so good!  I did decrease the sugar in the peaches a bit, the fresh peaches I used were plenty sweet enough, and I baked it in a stoneware dish as I didn't have a large iron skillet. It turned out delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought it was more of a crisp than a cobbler and it was too sweet for us.

really good but I am not sure on the whole turn the dough thing. I think I sank some of my dough. No matter! Still good!

While my batter never looked like cooked oatmeal, I decided to just go with it, assuming that all the peach juices bubbling in the skillet would make it work, and I was right!  This was delicious, and I will definitely make it again!
