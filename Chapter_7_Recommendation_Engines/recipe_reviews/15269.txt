Thanks for submitting this recipe.  I've searched for a long time to find my all time favorite french cookie.  Made this 30 years ago in high school french club.  Do you have the french yule log with pudding recipe?

These weren't very hard to make just read the directions fully before attempting them.  The hot pan of water and everything.  However, as previously stated be SURE to have parchment paper, or I imagine you'll never get these off your cookie sheets.  Not really my taste, kind of boring.

The taste was just like brittle but I am not sure if I did something wrong, but they weren't very easy to do and they all melted together when baking.

these were more of a peanut brittle than a  cookie.I did have to omit the nuts due to allergies so that may have affected them.The flavor was good but not very managable.

the cookies tasted ok at the end, but they weren't what i have expected. the first thing that surprised me was that instead of 4 dozen cookies, i ended up with a little over 65, after a few fell victom to the dog. also, when the recipe says to wait for the middle to set, the whole cookie is bubbly, so it may be set before it looks it. i just took it out after 3 min on the top, and 3 min on the bottom, and then put them on my counter so that they would firm up flatly.  they taste kinda like peanut brittle with chocolate on top. rather plain, but still good

I'm not quite sure if I did anything wrong but these cookies came out really hard and no so good tasting. Was I supposed to squish the dough flat before I stuck them in the oven? Because these cookies baked for about 16 minutes, and the didn't really spread that much.

This defintely took trial and error.. by my third batch,  I realized how  they were supposed to be.. My first attempt was not flavorful, doughy and chewy.. I switched from Crisco to real butter for shortening, added 1/4 tsp almond and vanilla extracts, chopped my pecans smaller, used smaller spoonfuls farther apart...and increased bake time to 7 min!! 
I think seizes up quickly so, by my last batch, not so great anymore.. gotta get a groove and work fast!  Didn't take long to perfect it!! Worth the practice.. 
they are exquisite!!

The flavor is not as good as it should be.
