My family loved it.  I put the steak rolls together the night before and refridgerate. Then brown them in the olive oil and onions the next day.  Put the browned beef, onions and other sauce ingredients in a slow cooker and cook on low for 4-5 hours, it melts in your mouth.

The main reason I picked this recipe over all the other flank steak recipes on this sight is because it didn't require it to be marinated. That, I think, is a mistake. Maybe mechanical tenderizing would work as well as marinating but it needed something. It tasted great but was pretty tough. Instead of tomato sauce I used jarred spaghetti sauce & served with a side of linguine.

I made this recipe with the following increases 2.5 lbs of flank and about 1-1/2 hard boiled eggs, and 2 chopped tomatoes.  It was outstanding!!! My only change I would make to this receipe is serving size.  I served this to my husband,two 30 year old men and myself and there were only 2 tiny pieces left!!!  6 servings would have been pushing it. Maybe it was just too good!!!
I would highly recommend this recipe.

The Bracciole is just like Nonna's!  but the sauce lacks flavour and needs basil, garlic, oregano and some parsley. This was a staple at Easter and I've missed it these past few years, Nonna no longer cooks.  I cut the steak in half lengthwise to make it easier to pound and seared it before cooking the onions. This was finished in the oven @ 350 for 2 hours. Thanks for sharing.

I'm hoping  I don't have to rate it. I didn't try it yet;but I wanted to tell  people that my ex husband's family were  true  Italian, and they ate this  for Christmas day. It seems fairly close to authenticate. If it doesn't have the hard boiled egg, it's not. I also remember green or bell peppers in the sauce with the onions.

I only used the part of the recipe that explains how and what to do with the meat as I made my own pasta sauce. It was quite tasty and definitely added more taste to my sauce. Had family over for dinner and they all loved it.
