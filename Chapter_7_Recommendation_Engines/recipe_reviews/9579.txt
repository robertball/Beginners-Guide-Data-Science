Great recipe, but I reduced the butter(used margarine) to 3/4 cup, and DO NOT grease the pan--I think this is why everyone's cookies are coming out so flat. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup regular flour. Instead of 1 cup chocolate chips, I used about 2/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/3 cup raisins, and added no nuts (my granola had nuts). I found they only need to bake for 10-12 minutes. YUM!

Absolutely *perfect* cookies with a few little changes: Used 3/4 cup of margarine instead of 1 cup butter. Increase flour to 1 3/4 cups (equal portions of flour and granola), and drop by rounded teaspoon without flattening cookies. I also used 1/4 cup of Skor chipits and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips instead of the full cup of chocolate chips. 12 minutes was just the right timing. I will definately be making these again!

Fabulous!  I didn't have any unsalted peanuts so I used some chopped cashews and almonds, which were already in my homemade granola.  Tasted great!  Eat warm out of the oven with a glass of milk.  Note:  I only needed about 10 - 11 mins. to bake.  Thanks for a great recipe, "K"!

Wow. These are AMAZING. The taste is absolutely fantastic. We used pecans instead of peanuts, but everything else was exactly the same. The granola we used was nice and chunky. The cookies were baked to perfection at 13 minutes. Like another reviewer said, they are chewy and crunchy at the same. Absolutely delicious! This recipe is a total keeper.

Only ok.  This recipe probably depends on which granola you use.  My granola was fairly powdery and mostly oats, maybe something sweeter or crunchier would be better.  As it was the cookies were like somewhat fancy chocolate chip cookies.  They were totally flat but had the normal cookie texture.  Leave plenty of space between cookies on tray and don't push down at all, just drop.  Followed recipe exactly except I acidentally almost melted the butter instead of just softening.  Only took 10 minutes to bake, would have burnt by 15 minutes.

My first tray of cookies came out flat like a previous reviewer described.  So I added 3/4 cup flour to the remaining batter.  The rest turned out rounded.  I took these cookies to work and most everyone liked the flat ones the best!  If I make them again, I will add only 1/4 cup flour to the 1 1/2 cups already called for.

Good flavor.  A little sweet even though I cut the sugar down a 1/4 C.  I think I will add 1/2 C more flour next time.  After the first batch I turned the oven down to 350 and baked for only 10 minutes.  The cookies were too thin and started to burn at 12 min at 375.

Yum! IThe only change I made was to use walnuts instead of peanuts. They were very tasty cookies, chewy and cruchy at the same time.

Yum! The goodness probably comes from the ton of butter in them... Might give some of the recommendations a try next time, but they were good as is. A great way to use up homemade granola that was just so-so, as a previous comment said!

As written I can only rate this recipe 3 stars :( There is wayyyyy to much butter! My cookies were completely flat. I really loved the concept of this recipe using granola so I thought i would try again with some tweaks!  I followed another reviewers suggestions and only used 3/4 cup butter and 1 3/4 cups flour! With those changes they turned out PERFECT!

Pretty good.  I cut down on the white sugar by 1/4 cup and up-ed the flour by 1/4 cup.  Added dark chocolate and white chocolate chips and skipped the nuts.

They were the perfect consitency when baked 12 mintues on a baking stone. (I used pampered chef).  When I baked it on a metal lpan for 12 minutes they got too brown and they were def flatter.  Stone is the way to go!!

Wow, this is a great recipe.  The only thing better than the flavor is the smell when they are cooking!!!  I used an extra 1/4 cup flour as suggested.  I used half white half whole wheat flour and I used a mixture of walnuts and pecans instead of peanuts.  Wow, these really got rave reviews at work and I will definitely make them again. Thanks!

Well, I agree that the taste was great and I really like the flavor combination. But when I made up this recipe the cookies were completely flat. Not what I expected. So I stirred in another cup of flour and they baked up like your usual chocolate chip cookie. Much better. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if the recipe has a typo, but all's well that ends well.

I, too, wanted to use up some (Bob's Red Mill honey almond) granola that was on hand so that's how I came to this recipe. Was a bit unsure whether to make these particular cookies after reading so many of the reviews. But, most everyone liked the taste just not the flatness of the  cookie. So, I lessened both sugars to a half cup each per others' suggestions and also because my granola was very sweet already. Then, per suggestions here, I increased the flour to equal the amount of granola called for. Also, I reduced the oven temp to three fifty, again, as other bakers had recommended. After my first pan went in I kept the remaining dough in the fridge until each time I needed to prep a new pan.  I think this helped with alleviating the very flat cookie. I did have a little bit of a puff to mine - baking time was nine minutes and although they did not look quite baked through I left them on the pan for several minutes until removing them to cool. I did think the recipe came together nicely, but I am giving this four stars as there were so many adjustments that needed to be made. Everyone was right though, the taste is great!

I loved these! I read the reviews first so I added 100 grams of ground almonds, about 3/4 cup ( several reviewers had added more flour). I put in a little more peanuts cause I like them. Everyone loves the cookies!!

These are excellent!! I made a few changes for dietary reasons. I used coconut oil in place of butter, Splenda white and brown sugar substitutes and walnuts instead of peanuts. (I didn't have peanuts) They kept their shape and are delicious!

These were delicious and a nice option to my regular oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  I didn't have enough granola so added some quick cooking oat to replace what was missing.  I also added about 1/3 cup milk to make them a big chewy.  They turned out nice and flat and chewy!

I've made this cookie recipe several times and the cookie is thin and crispy, sort of like a cookie chip.  To make this cookie with more "substance" I've added 1/2 cup more flour, and the cookie won't be so thin.  I've also tried subbing some of the granola with Kellogg's protein cereal.  My kids liked this thicker cookie (and still crispy) version more than the thin version.  Both versions have their place in my household!

Flavor of these are wonderful but I also found they flattened out a lot. I always use parchment paper so the problem is probably too much butter. I will reduce next time and use butter flavored shortening and see if that helps. I used Maple Nut Granola from this site so didn't add any nuts as called for nor did I put in chocolate chips (would have been overkill with all that was in the granola). I did add 3/4 c of shaved coconut for a bit more crunch. It's definitely a keeper recipe and except for the excessive spreading on the cookies it would be a 5 star.

Great recipe. I also reduced the butter to 3/4 a cup, only 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I don't like cookies too sweet so it was perfect for me. I also like how crispy they are.

Not fond of whole wheat, whole grain, weird grain cookies. Too hippie/natural for me. BUT the doctors all say to get that stuff. Granola is the perfect solution! I found a few brands that weren't 100% sugar, 100% bad fats, and still have whole grains and seeds. Wahoo! These are FABULOUS cookies! A real keeper.

This recipe was a great way to use up some granola and some peanuts I had in the pantry. I did use equal amounts of granola and flour (1 3/4 cups of each) as another reviewer suggested but used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour to make up the total of 1 3/4 cups of flour. My peanuts were salted so I decreased the salt in the recipe to 1/4 teaspoon. These were delicious-- thanks for the recipe.

I have made these a couple times (without the peanuts) and they are some of the best cookies I have ever tried. This recipe is a keeper.

Pretty good. I decreased the sugar by a pinch and used Sprout's vanilla granola, so I didn't use vanilla extract. It turned a little dry in the the beginningand better at the last batch.

Eh. I was hoping this would be more like oatmeal scotchies (the cookie you get from the back of the butterscotch chip bag), but it was not. It was fine, but just not what I was looking for.

These burn easily, only needed 10 mins max for me. Nice buttery taste, not exactly like I was expecting, more classic cookie. Used Hersheys special dark chips, yum

Awesome. Used a little less sugar because the granola was pretty sweet.  Also read reviews saying the cookies were flat, so I melted the butter then put the dough in the fridge for a bit before putting the cookies on the tray.  They were still sorta flat, but in a good way.  They were chewy and just right for me and my fam.

Wonderful cookies! I would reduce the amount of time I cook them the next time we make them. 12-15 minutes is a bit long.

I made these cookies for the second time and melted the butter (in the microwave) instead of just softening it, which made the cookies puff up much more instead of being so flat. I had to turn down the oven to 350 though to make sure they baked thoroughly. Delicious!

We liked the added granola and the fact that it kept it's crunchy texture after cooking.  Rated a little lower than I had hoped bc as written is is very moist and flattens too much even without greasing the pan.  Adding the extra flour might help next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Cookie was deliciously crunchy and sweet.  Was also able to use up our granola cereal which we'd become tired of eating. Both my six year old and myself loved it.
