Delicious - not to mention a great way to perk up dinner rolls! And, while these rolls are great all by themselves the addition of garlic, herbs, and Parmesan cheese really take these over the top.  These are a great accompaniment to soups and salads!

First of all I have to say that these 'Sister Schubert's Rolls' are FANTASTIC as is, but the addition of the oil and seasonings just make them that much better. Definately give these a try...it is such a nice way to dress up a dinner roll! :)

I did not defrost the rolls before I cooked them... I put the oven on 300, and followed the rest of the recipe.  They cooked for 30 minutes, and they were awesome!  The taste was similar to the restaurants where you dip the bread in the oil and seasonings.  The yeast rolls are lighter and soak up more of the seasoned oil. Everyone loved these!

these were very , very good.... the recipe didn't say whether to thaw the rolls prior to use, but I did and eight minutes in the oven was plenty.  Very tasty recipe.

YUM!  These were delicious - can't wait to make them again soon!  I didn't have any fresh parsley so I added more Italian herb blend.  Very good!

So I changed this recipe a little bit. I used Rhodes dinner rolls. This was for Christmas dinner and there were kids present. I thought that the kids may not like all of the spices.... so I left some plain. BIG mistake! The kids loved them!!! In fact everyone ate the seasoned ones, and left the plain ones.  I did serve butter on the side, but everyone liked them as is. Would definatley make again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Good stuff!  My hubby really liked the rolls with this special topping.  We eat these rolls a lot and he is tired of them.  However, when I added this topping he thought they were great and didn't mind eating them at all.

Absolutely delicious rolls.  My family devoured them and ask me to make more.  I am going to infuse evoo with these ingredients (minus parm. cheese) so that I have it on hand anytime. Would be good a good rub on chicken, pork etc... Thank you.

I used the oil and herbs from this recipe on top of the "Tasty Buns" recipe also from Allrecipes .... DELICIOUS!  It was super easy and with the oil and herb mixture, they were delicious with dinner!  WOW!  Will definitely use again and again.

The herb mixture was just a little more than needed but gave the rolls a delightful flavor that complements Alfredo pasta well.

This was good, but next time I will choose a different type of roll. The Sister Schubert Dinner yeast roll was too sweet for my taste. Also, I'd like to compare the results using butter instead of olive oil.

These were wonderfully tasty! Will definitely make again. If you don't have the time to bake your own rolls, this is a great alternative for a weeknight dinner roll.

I used this recipe on a bag of  frozen yeast rolls. Everyone really liked the bread.
