Wowie, this was amazing!! I completely left out the butter to make it healthier, and it was still just totally yummy. We also used half Miracle Whip (instead of mayo) and half regular mustard (we don't like dijon). This is so light and fresh and flavorful and I highly recommend it. YUM!

This is a scrumptious way to serve orange roughy - I didn't change a thing. Make sure you have it at least six inches from the broiler, because otherwise it will start smoking like crazy. I give it 5 stars for taste, but took away one star overall for high fat content and calories.

Delicious!  Yum yum yum.  Next time though, I will use much less mayo in the dijonaisse, and more dijon to make up for it.  I also won't add any salt, and not quite as much parmesan.  Hopefully that still turns out as tasty, because it was great but seemed a little too "greasy".

This recipe is really good if you want to somewhat camouflage the taste of the fish.  My husband called it a 'Crab Imperial for Fish'.  Probably would not make it again as we don't like heavy sauces for seafood - but I can see the appeal for others.  I will say that the reviews on this site piqued my interest about endangered fish.  I had no idea that Orange Roughy was amongst those - no wonder it has been more and more difficult to find.  It is worth doing some research regarding other species.  For instance, others to avoid include Red Snapper, Chilean Sea Bass, and Atlantic Salmon, just to name a few.  Hard to figure out what to and what not to eat these days :)

This is wonderfully easy, FAST and fool-proof!  This recipe can be used on any light flavored fish very well.  I actually broiled some bay scallops and sprinkled them on top of the fish for an extra dimension of sea-food :-)   Orange Roughy is a delicious fish with a light and buttery flavor.  The fish guy at Wild Oats said that their population is weak which is why Wild Oats doesn't sell them anymore.  He recommended Cod as substitute.  Whenever I can get some Orange Roughy, I love to use this recipe, but Cod is good as well.

OK, my husband and I DEVOURED this tonight - great recipe.  I "tweeked" the topping a little and it was still awesome.  Serve with a salad and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and you've got a winner!!!!

Just made this on a whim and it is delicious and quick! I used Olive Oil instead of butter and added a few extra seasonings and just loved it!

I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter", garlic powder, Lite Canola Mayo, dijon mustard, and salt.  This was AWESOME!!  Even my son son who says he doesn't like fish said "I'll eat that".

Very tastey and SO EASY!!  Love this recipe!!  The only thing that I did differently was I used a mixture of about 1/2 TBSP yellow mustard mixed with 2 TBSP mayo (I didn't actually measure, so I am guestimating).  I will definitely make this again.

DH actually said "out of the orbit" - never heard him say that before!  Terrific recipe, I may cut the topping down to cut back the fat but we will be making this alot.  Thank You chibi chef!

Delicious! and very easy. 2 suggestions/comments - You don't need all this topping for 1 pound of fish, its way too much. The second time I made it I only made about a 1/4 of the topping for almost 1 pound of orange roughy and it was enough. Excellent flavor but you could still appreciate the fish. Also, I salt and peppered the fish before broiling it.  Its a must try - perfect with some fresh broccoli or green beans

My boyfriend is allergic to shell fish, so can no longer eat it... but still loves it... I cooked this for him and he raved that it tasted like crab meat and would pay to eat this in a restaurant... the entire time he ate it... This will definately stay on the menu rotation. Thanks.

This recipe was so incredibly easy and the taste was fantastic!  I made it for the first time last night and my husband has already asked me to make it again next week!

I did not have any Dijonaise so I simply used 1/8 cup mayonnaise and 1/8 cup Dijon mustard instead.  It came out beautifully!

Thanks for posting such an awesome and easy recipe!

O.M.G. This is sublime!!  I made this in individual dishes.  When they were done, I took the vegetables (steamed medley) and placed around the fish.  I served with a nice salad on the side.  This recipe is a keeper, thank you!!

this was delicious! I am only giving 4 stars because the topping overpowered the fish a little bit, but it was still tasty.. next time, I will use less of the mixture.  I omitted the butter and didn't miss it. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will also omit the salt. I could also maybe use more garlic too

My hubby & I tried this recipe this evening, and it is WELL worth trying!  I left out the salt (there's plenty of salt in parm--didn't miss it.  It was oh-so-yummy!  Had it with a spinach souffle, parm noodles & cut-up fresh fruit.  A definate repeater!

DELICIOUS!!!  Mine came out a *little* on the tart side since I didn't measure the lemon juice, but it was still great!  Since I had extra lemon juice in the baking tray around the fish, I stirred in of the extra parmesan topping mix I had.  After a few minutes in the broiler, the result was a very tasty cream sauce that was EXCELLENT over pasta.  I will definitely make this again soon!

WOW! We have a winner! I used this recipe for Orange Roughy and for chicken tenders.  My son even used the topping on fish sticks. The whole family loved this.

I was disappointed in this one. I used tilapia instead of orange roughy, so I don't know if that made a major difference. The mixture was too tangy and salty. I would salt and pepper the fish before cooking and leave out the salt from the cheese mixture.

My husband really liked this dish but I thought it was alright.  I think I didn't like the cheesy/creamy taste on fish.

Excellent!  I added a little extra salt, but NOT necessary.  Next time I will make it exactly like the directions.  Thanks for a great Friday night supper.

Wowie wow wow!  as my kids would say!  We all loved this one - and my girls are only 6 and 9.  We ate every bite!  My husband and I had to share part of ours with the girls, in fact!  Don't change a thing!  Thank you so much for the great recipe! Can't wait to have it again!

Very good for people who do not like fish.  The topping got my daughter to eat it and like it even though we only needed half of it. Next time I will use the topping for my daughter only, to get her to eat fish, and my husband and I will eat the fish with lemon and garlic salt only.

In these times, value means even more.  Flash frozen roughy, properly prepared, like any fish, is fine.  With this recipe, it is outstanding.  Try it. It's very easy.  If you don't have fresh garlic, already minced, then "smushed" with rest, is great. My compliments to the chef!

Did not like it! To much garlic and butter in recipe. Recipe needs to be revamped. Using yogurt is more healthier, but was not good either. Making next time just adding lemon juice on top of really ant fish fish and put the paprika on top.

The mustard overpowered the fish. If I were to make it again I would skip that ingredient and I think it would be good.

Delicious! As others said, it makes more topping than you need so next time will make about a third less of the mixture. I used what I had on hand: shredded parm instead of grated, and I mixed mayo, brown and regular mustard together to taste instead of dijonaise. Followed cook times exactly and it was perfect.

Super easy, super good! I didn’t have Dijon, substituted stoneground mustard and mayo combo.  Came out perfectly. Nothing leftover. That says a lot in our household of two...  Thanks for sharing.

This was a tasty fish! Based on other reviews, I tweaked the ingredients. I used no salt, 1/2 tbsp Dijon, 2 tbsp mayo and 2 tbsp butter for 3 filets. (I didn’t want to coat the tops with a whole lot). Cooked as stated and it was just right. Will definitely be making this again!

Huge hit for the entire family! I used tilapia, since that was freshest at my seafood market, made the Dijonaise heavy on the Dijon, substituted veganaise for mayo and didn’t add salt, but otherwise changed nothing. It was perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. I served it with spinach risotto and asparagus, which balanced the richness of the fish very well.

I did make some changes. I did not have dijon mustard so I used yellow mustard and added worcestershire, horseradish. and extra parm cheese. It was amazing.

We didn't have the mayo/dijon mixture so I used half mayo with half course ground mustard, and used Asiago cheese because that is what we had on hand.  My 16 yr old foodie daughter told me she actually dreamed about this dish, we have had this 3 times in the last 6 weeks! Delicious!

My husband and I loved this!  I didn't modify any part of the recipe, and we devoured it.  I see where some people don't like how it conceals the fish flavor, but orange roughy is pretty mild anyway.  It's a delicious, unique fish recipe compared to all the other options out there!  Definitely will try making again, although next time I will modify for it to be healthier.

This dish was outstanding.  I made this for my wife and deviated very little from the recipe.  I may have cut back on the mayo and added a bit more paprika.  My wife was extremely impressed.  I will certainly make this again.

Excellent flavours.  I did a variation as I didn't want to use the broiler for just one serving.  Dried the roughy filet, then dipped it in a beaten egg white.  Made a breading of the Parmesan cheese and panko crumbs (about half and half) and added some granulated garlic, white pepper, and ground Aleppo chiles.  Sautéed the breaded filet in a bit of olive oil, then brushed some Dijon mustard on top.  Delicious!  The mustard was not at all overwhelming to the fish and worked well with Parmesan and garlic crust.  The Aleppo chiles add a bit of fruity depth with mild heat.

Amazingly delicious.  I used mayo and whole grain dijon.  We have had this twice in the last month.  Works on frozen fish too, so perfect for a weeknight that you forgot to pull something from the freezer.

I love fish but do not make it that often and this recipe was fast, east, and rediculously delish. Make sure it is 6in from broiler. I cooked for 5 minutes first, then did spread, and cooked about another 3 until top looked toasty.  I added a sprinkle of plain Panko breadcrumbs for a little crunch.

Very tasty. The recipe made way more topping than was probably necessary. Next time I will cut way down on the butter or eliminate it all together. Very good and easy.

Very good, easy recipe, but I did alter a bit.  I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, and the lemon squeeze and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  Also, I forgot to add mayonnaise and used straight dijon for that ingredient, then used garlic powder instead of garlic b/c I felt lazy.  Stirred it up, it seemed lacking so added a splash of white wine.  This turned out excellent, although next time I would half the butter because that was the only ingredient which seemed a bit overpowering.

My wife actually made this for me one night and it was amazing. Very simple to make, and the taste is very good. Any fish with a mild taste goes well with the topping, and almost any side pairs well with the fish.

Nice and flavorful! My husband really liked it, too!  However, I'm always concerned when I see mayonnaise AND butter together in a recipe b/c of fat/calorie content so I took out the butter and created my own dijonnaise along with the other ingredients and it was not greasy at all.

This is an excellent dish. I've made it twice. The second time I used a apckage of hidden valley buttermilk ranch dressing, subbing the dijonaisse for the mayonaise. Not better, just different. There was some dressing left over, so i just used poured it into the caraffe and used it to dress salads.

This was an awesome topping for fish!  I used Flounder rather than Orange Roughy and used spray butter to cut the calories and it was delicous!  For the dijon/mayo spread I used 1/8 cup of dijon and an 1/8 cup of fat free mayo to come to the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for.  Will definatley make again!

Loved this recipe :))  Even my daughter ate it and she complains every time I cook fish!  The only changes I made were reducing the parmesan to 1/4 cup and omitting the butter - for diet reasons.  I'm sure it's better with the butter, but it also tasted great without it!
