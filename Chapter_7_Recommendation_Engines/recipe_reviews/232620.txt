I had tons of fresh figs from a tree out back, so I used about two plus cups of fresh diced figs. I also have some fancy balsamic vinegars: traditional balsamic, black cherry balsamic and Sicilian lemon white balsamic which I used in 3 parts. I used a sweeter scotch since I didn't have  bourbon. I reduced on low for quite a while, maybe 40

My favorite brand of fig spread is discontinued! This recipe is just the replacement I needed. I will never go fig spreadless again. Okay, so I modified the recipe a tiny bit: we used up all our bourbon for Manhattans, but I had some brandy on hand. Whisky, brandy, orange liqueur, Southern Comfort, I bet any of these would work. If you can find LaPanzanella Black Pepper Crackers, spread the fig compote on the cracker with some Beechers Flagship cheese. Mmmmmmm...

Just added a little water at the end to get the consistency right.

I had a sackful of figs to get through so I quadrupled this recipe. Very tangy! I'll probably add less balsamic vinegar next time. Great with butter and toast. I have some to a friend who plans on using it to cook chicken.

This was rather dry. I had to add water to really moisten the figs and try to get the mixture more syrupy. The bourbon flavor really disappeared. I thought it was just okay, but husband really liked it. We had it on sliced baguette with chevre. It was especially good when the fig jam was still warm.

Super easy to make! Used it over my Thanksgiving baked Brie instead of the lingonberry jam I traditionally use. Followed all the directions and ingredients to a T. Set off the Brie really nicely.

Tastes very good, sweetness of dates plus the bourbon flavour makes for a great match

This was a great little treat!  I bought some beautiful fresh figs, thinking of some sort of appetizer but found this recipe and gave it a try.  It's delicious and also a way to impress your guests when you tell them you made it yourself!  Don't tell them how simple it was!  Yummy!

This is so delicious.  However I didn't have whiskey so I used coconut rum. Great with cheese and very addictive. It also tastes better and better as days go by.  Thanks for sharing @JSchubert
