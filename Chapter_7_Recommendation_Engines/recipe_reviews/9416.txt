I think the low ratings on this recipe can be attributed to people thinking they will get something rich and sweet like pumpkin pie or a fast food chain pumpkin milkshake, but this is really good. I agree it needs sweetener, so I added 1 1/2 Tbsp Splenda and that did the job perfectly (as would the same amount of sugar I presume). I also just used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate spices and I used approximately double (about 2 tsp for the whole recipe). It turned out pretty good and my mom, who doesn't like anything out of the ordinary, really enjoyed it as well.

fantastic! i was looking for a recipe like this and finally found it. but make sure you take a look at how many it serves... i didn't; and made way too much! otherwise it is incredible. i do suggest adding a few ice cubes in there to make it a bit colder. all the blending warms it up, even with the ice cream in it. also i left out the mace, i didn't have any and it was perfect without it.

Eight thumbs up from all the members in my family. Even my husband, which surprized me. No mace, so I used 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. I made no other changes. This is very similar to a pumpkin pie shake which is beyond awesome. My kids thought I was the coolest mom ever.

Having made several milkshakes before, I made a minor modification without reading the other reviews.  If you half the milk and double the ice cream, it gives it that perfect sweetness that doesn't require additional sugar.  I also substituted allspice for the mace (I didn't have any mace on hand).  I also halved the recipe in order to have it serve me, my husband, and my 3 kids (5 servings).  It made 2 adult servings (about 1 3/4 c) and one 8oz child serving.  While the full recipe might be too much, it doesn't serve 10 good-sized milkshakes.  It will make 10 8 oz shakes.

Wasn't a big hit.  Needed about 1/2 cup sugar, and I had to make it in batches because not all the milk would fit in the blender.  Kids liked it, but adults didn't care for it too much.  Don't think I'll be making this again.

I started by following the recipe as written with the exception of the milk which wouldn't all fit into my blender. We all agreed that it was very bland.I added nearly a cup of sugar and more ice cream. I ended up using much less milk than what the recipe calls (about 1/2). The final product with all of my modifications was yummy, but not worth repeating.

Yummy!! I really shouldn't review this, as i didn't follow the recipe to the tee. But I will say, I did a Half batch as it is just my husband and small son so we didn't need a lot. So I used half the pumpkin, a Pint of Ice cream, and 2 cups of milk, I put in about 5 TBS of Brown Sugar, and twice the amount of Spice, and 1 tsp vanilla. this would be just like one you would get at a fast food Joint. It was Oh so yummy

This recipe was really disappointing, but a couple of small tweaks made this recipe something the who family loved, even me who doesn't like pumpkin!  It wasn't near sweet enough so on a whim my partner added about 2-3 Tbsps of cinnamon and sugar mix and about a half cup of sugar, but he likes his pumpkin sweet.  It's like drinking pumpkin pie or pumpkin pudding in milkshake form.

It is exactly as advertised, the way people think of milkshakes in New England or what you'd think of with the term "nog".  It's got about the consistency of eggnog, but pumpkin pie flavored!  You could easily make this into a frappe if you simply reduced the milk to...I'd say about a cup?  And added three more cups of ice cream.  You could probably swap out the pint for a half-gallon, or a gallon if you wanted it really thick and that would do the trick.

In short, few little tweaks and this became a fantastic family favorite.  I actually liked it well enough without modifications (and I really don't like pumpkin flavored anything!) but the family voted on sweeter.

It makes way too much for a family. May be a small party? I did buy mace, but I donâ€™t think it added much flavor. The texture of the nog was little grainy. I think from the mace. The overall flavor was good though. Instead of the blender I just a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. I would make it again but just a half batch.

The name says it all as far as flavor, of course it's an intense pumpkin drink.
