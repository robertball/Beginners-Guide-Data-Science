This is easy and delicious.... and is good reheated if you have leftovers, too.  I halved the recipe (there are only two of us) and used a red pepper instead of green.  I also added 1 cup of green beens, upped the curry powder (we like spice) and used lower fat mushroom soup and no-fat ham.  It lowers the calories, fat and cholesterol count considerably without compromising taste.  I also found one teaspoon of oil sufficient for frying the veggies.  A great way to use leftover wild and white rice.  Enjoy!

I halved the recipe except for the ham & veggies, used brown rice instead of wild and halved the cooking time by microwaving the rice & veggies.  Turned out great!

I was looking for something other than potatoes to mix with my leftover ham.  This was super!!!  Took one reviewer's idea and made with white sauce (with cayenne and nutmeg) instead of the soup.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms and I didn't see any lack in flavor.  I thought this had a ton of it!  Wild rice alone adds a lot.  Wouldn't change anything other than what I've noted.  Have added to my recipe box and will make anytime I have leftover ham.  Thanks ALN!!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I used a home made white sauce instead of condensed soup and served with peanuts and raisins.  Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly. Way too salty for my taste--maybe if low sodium cream of mushroom soup was used it would be better.  I probably won't make again.

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical, mostly because the last ham and wild rice casserole we tried was mostly mayonnaise and tasted like it.  But, this casserole turned out excellent. We added extra curry and ate it with raisins and peanuts for a middle-eastern flair. The flavor combination was very good and we liked having lots of vegetables. We were worried that the soy sauce would make it too salty, but no problem there! Thanks for a delicious and (fairly) healthy ham casserole recipe!

This was very good.  I doubled the amount of ham and used just wild rice.  We don't like curry so I substituted paprika and didn't have wine so used chicken broth.  Nice, hearty casserole.  I saw some of the comments about the mushrooms - I used sliced baby portobellos and thought they worked well in the recipe.

We just didn't like this enough to make it again. The fresh saut√©ed mushrooms added nothing to this dish. The argument can be made that they were used to compliment the cream of mushroom soup..but to us, it did not. Also, I would advise anyone who makes this to be careful with how much soy sauce you use. Most hams are fairly salty. My leftover ham did not need the additional salt which 1/4 cup of soy sauce would have added therefore I cut it down to 2Tbls of soy sauce and added chicken broth to bring up the required 1/4 cup of liquid. Although I wouldn't make this again, I would suggest leaving out the fresh mushrooms, adding instead 1apple, peeled and diced and adding an additional 1/2 tsp of curry. Also, fearing that it would be dry, I added 1/4of half and half to give it some creaminess.

Flavors are good. It ended up taking 3 hours to make!  First off I couldn't find wild rice in my local grocery store.  I ended up having to buy a mix of 4 rices that included wild rice.  I then tried to follow the directions for the recipe instead of just use the 4 rice mix and make according to the directions.  So the 4 rice mix cooked in way under the original estimated time and over cooked by absorbing all the liquid.  Then I added the long grain white and had to continually add more broth and then water.  Used a yellow bell pepper instead of green.

This was the perfect recipe base for today; I found this recipe while I was looking for a use for all of our leftovers.   I made lots of substitutions since I used what was on hand including Cream of Celery soup and Mape Burbon ham smoked on the Big Green Egg.  Like another reviewer, I used red bell peppers.  The carrots I had on hand were sliced, dill carrots grilled with coconut oil.  The next time I make this, I am going to follow the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper - substitutions or not.

This was good, but I agree with another reviewer who said it was a lot of work (and ingredients) for something that tasted like Cream of Mushroom soup!  I did love the chopped veggies, so I don't consider that too complicated, but adding the soy sauce, wine, curry powder and mustard didn't seem to do much for the flavor, so just extra steps and cost.  And I actually didn't read carefully enough and only used ONE can of soup... I can't imagine if I had used two!!  Not sure if it would be too dry if those ingredients just got omitted, but if I make this again, I'd probably just skip from step #3 to #5 and add a cup of water in #6.

I believe this came out like it was supposed to. A lot of steps for a recipe that tastes like anything else you put Cream of MR soup in. I made my own curry but it still needed more spice. Baked right at 30 minutes and went over well with the family.
