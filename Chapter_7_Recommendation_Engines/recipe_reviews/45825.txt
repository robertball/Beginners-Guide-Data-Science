We thought this was excellent. It reminds me of chow mien. We served over white rice! I used pre-packed pre-shredded cole slaw which saves on chopping time and an extra packet of chicken noodle soup mix. Very good and would make again!

This is a good recipe. I make it differently. I use oil not butter and add 1 grated carrot. 2 tablespoons of curry powder or to taste (most important ingredient) I also cook it differently. Soften onion. Add carrot celery curry powder and meat and cook until meat browned. Add soup mix and 2 cups of water (or half the quantity specified on the soup packet). Simmer for 15 mins. Add beans and very very very finely sliced cabbage. Stir well. Cook with lid on for about 5 -10 mins or until cabbage cooked as you like it. I serve it with steamed rice or noodles and it makes oodles! The curry powder really makes it.

This dish was absolutely delicious. I had never used cabbage before for anything but soup and stuffed cabbage but this recipe definitely enlightened me to some more possibilities. Thank you for sharing!

Very good. It didn't need bread or rice to be a complete meal. This is the sort of thing you like to have again and again. The sauteed cabbage was good prepared this was not bitter.

Pretty good. My husband and daughter loved it I just thought it was alright. Kind of bland even though I added more soy sauce pepper and garlic powder. It needs something I'm just not sure what. Maybe even more soy sauce.

This was a great recipe even my 2 year old loved it! I used light soy sauce and onion soup mix. My husband added tobasco sauce to his (he complained that there were too many vegetables but he went back for seconds!). I will definately make this again!

This was a great meal! It made enough to feed 6 people. I omitted the butter and just simmered the veggies in the water/broth mix. Broccoli slaw is great mixed in as well! Definately will make again

a good kid dish-- bland but tasty. i browned the sirloin first then drained it on paper towels while the veggies cooked. i did add extra veggies extra soy sauce pepper and just a dash of sesame oil and i reduced the water by one-half cup. i don't know about serving it with bread or rice--you'll have a bunch of noodles in the dish already from the soup mix and adding more rice seems like carb overload...

This was delicious but a little oily so next time I'll drain some of the oil out of the bottom of the pan befor I add the liquid. I followed another reviewer's advice and added some cyanne pepper which really added to the flavor. I also used frozen peas instead of green beans because it was what I had on hand and they worked very well.

I too cooked this a little differently. I browned the meat first then drained it. I then added the veggies plus about 1/2 tsp of chopped garlic and 1/2 bag of bagged coleslaw mix. I also used a ramen noodles package because that's all I had and I used a can of beef broth instead of water. Added the meat back in and viola! Done very quickly. Tasty and makes alot. My son didn't care for it so I'll have plenty of leftovers for lunch for the week. Thanks for the post I will make again.

Very Good although I changed it a bit. Used oil not butter. Omitted the green beans & subbed about 1 cup shredded carrot. Used leftover turkey - no sirloin. I didn't have the soup mix so subbed 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon added 2 heaping tablespoons curry powder & omitted soy sauce since it detracted from the curry flavor. Enjoy!

This has become a family favorite and it is probably my kids' favorite family meal. It's very homey and comforting. If you are looking for a recipe to get your kids to eat more vegetables try this one. I make it exactly as written and serve it with French bread or rolls with butter and oranges.

I like this because it is so versatile and makes a good week-day dinner. I added grated carrot and green pepper for lots of veggies. Another time I used broken up "Top Ramen" and its flavor packet. We liked it both ways.

This meal may not look pretty but it is full of flavor and an inexpensive favourite in our family. I add 1 cup of rice and add 2 cups of water to make my version a true one pot wonder. I often use dry slaw in a bag. It looks like a lot but it dissolves down. Give this one a try. It is sure to please.

The only change I made was to use a little more soy sauce. My husband never given to hyperbole said on the first bite "This is pretty good". I guess his taste buds kicked in a little later and he had to contain himself from eating all of it!Our daughter came in from a late class and although she had already had dinner she had some of this. I served it over rice. This was very easy and I really like these one pot meals that contain plenty of veggies as well as protein and some pasta. This one's a keeper.

This was a great dish. My family loved it. I did however add additional soysauce (about a tbs) and a cube of chicken bouillon for additional flavor.

My father made this recipe after visiting Thailand.
The only difference was cooking curry powder, about 1 tbsp with the onions and adding juliene carrots with the other vegetables.
