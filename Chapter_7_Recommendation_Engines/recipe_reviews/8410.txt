Was overall a good cake. Very moist and different than the standard chocolate or vanilla variations. I didn't have shortening or lemons so I subbed the same amount of butter, orange zest and pineapple juice. Next time I think I'd leave the pineapple and cherry off the top due to personal preference.

Most citrus cakes that I have baked don't have much orange or lemon flavor... but this one is INCREDIBLE!!! What a fabulous cake!  In addition to tasting great, it's also moist and tender. I didn't bother with the topping- I saw no need for it, and my husband hates frosting.  Instead of the pineapple juice in the cake I pureed part of the can of pineapple chunks with some of the juice and added that to the cake. I also used 4 eggs instead of 5, and substituted soy milk for the milk.  Yum Yum is right!
