The best thing about these was the cereal mix with coconut. The cookies did not turn out at ALL!
But we all found a new favorite cereal mix for breakfast!

The idea was great, using up the cereal, but the taste was strange and definitely acquired.  We love macaroons, but these are more less like true macaroons and more like coconut cereal melts.  Very very easy to try, though if you want to give it a whirl.  Kids may like them, but don't take them to your next party.

I made these with my sister on a girls night in.  Here's what we have to say about them: They are a giant mess and certainly not beautiful but we had a ton of fun making them and eating them.  We experimented with adding other things like marsh mallows and candy corn.  They were pretty tasty but still not something I would be proud to bring to a party.
