These were great!  I used the phyllo cups instead of the sheets, and they were a big hit.  I will make these again.
Using fresh parsley is a must.  I also cut the serving size down considerably, and it worked out just fine.  Thanks for the post happycooker03!

These little cheese pies are delicious.  Authentic taste of Greece, and fun to make!  I made these for a work Christmas party and served tzatziki (also from this site) on the side.  Everyone loved them - a great change from the same hors d'oeurves you see every year.  Thanks for this treasure!

Great recipe!  We used to make these when I catered but I couldn't remember the amounts for each ingredient.  Thanks for sharing this treasure.  It is a sure hit with crowds!  I always made in advance and froze to make a party less stressful.

Absolutely fantastic!!! Adults and kids gobble them up.  They are easy to make, but time consuming.  Will try using the phyllo baskets next time and may prepare in advance and freeze (before baking).

Tip: if making triangles, cut the phyllo with a knife before unrolling dough.  Unroll just a third at a time.  The rest will retain the right amount of moisture.  Also, don't put in more filling then called for or it will ooze out during cooking.

this was fantastic!  i used mozzarella instead of monterey jack, b/c i couldn't find it, and added about 1/4 cup parmesan b/c i was a few ounces short on the feta!  i put the mixture in mini phyllo cups and they were gone within minutes!  delicious appetizer!  great flavor!  i did add a little garlic powder when i put the salt and pepper in too!

These came out fantastic! I made these for our annual Christmas Eve party and they were the first things to go. 
The only problem with them was that they leaked while baking, which is probably my fault becuase I used less feta cheese ( 8 oz)than the recipe called for. I did make them ahead and froze them on a cookie sheet. I may try it with some fresh mint next time instead of the parsley. My brother likes them with some sugar or honey on top, so good! A little time consuming but very much worth it with all the compliments you will receive =)

I wasn't sure how these were going to come out at first but they were great. I used the phyllo cups instead and made the filling ahead of time and kept it in the frig until ready to cook. If you use the cups do not over fill or they will spill over. Will definately make them again.

I was very happy with these little bites of joy!  I added some leftover crumbled bacon and my husband could not stop eating them!  Next time I may add pimientos or sliced black olives instead of the bacon.

It's been quite awhile since I made these.  They are absolutely delicious!!!  My 1 1/2 year old loved them too!  Anytime you make something involving phyllo dough - it will take quite a bit of time to make... but it is definitely worth the effort!  I wouldn't recommend changing a thing with this recipe.

These are so wonderful.  I loved the combination of the filling ingredients and found them to be the perfect appetizer.

Not sure that I loved these.  Working with phyllo is really painstaking sometimes.  I made these twice, once as a test run and the other as an appetizer for Easter.  The second time I made these I was in a bit of a rush and put more of the filling in than I should've.  The first pan all exploded all over, leaving me with a bunch of triangular phyllo packets with what looked like egg salad all over them.  Also, you can't really make these ahead of time or the phyllo will dry out, but you also don't want to ignore your guests while you're carefully folding phyllo packets in the kitchen!  They're not great cold, so I'm sort of at a loss as to how to successfully make these for guests.  They tasted good warm, and I upped the feta bit to make the filling thicker and easier to handle and to give more flavor to it.  Not sure that I'll make these again.

I was really excited to try this recipe because I love feta cheese.  However, excuting the recipe was a little frustrating.  The phyllo was hard to work with and that's why I gave it a three.  I'd probably give the taste a four.  Maybe using won ton wrappers in a mini muffin pan would make this a more user friendly recipe.

These were fantastic!  They were so flavorful and good. They were a little time consuming but delicious.  I made them the night before I needed them and then baked them in batches the next day.  My first time eating them but they are great.

These were excellent - tasted just like the ones my Greek former mother in-law used to make.  We ate some with chicken soup and I froze seven dozen for later.

I reduced the recipe by half. These are very time consuming to make, but they sure didn't last long once they were out of the oven. I made them for a dinner party and everyone loved them!!

Allow the Phyllo to defrost overnight in the fridge. Other defrosting methods such as microwaving for 40 seconds didn't work nearly as good. Cut the Phyllo dough strips with a pair of scissors after it has been unrolled. This prevents  jagged edges. Cover extra piles with saran wrap and a damp cloth.

Awesome!! spreading the butter was really annoying so I put melted butter in my misto sprayer and sprayed it on or I would use butter spray like Pam next time.  I also think I would add more filling next time or possibly use the phyllo cups which would be so much easier and still taste great.  I wasn't sure if these were going to taste authentic but they really do, thanks
