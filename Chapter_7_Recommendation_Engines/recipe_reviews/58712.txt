--- the saffron I originally use is not "powdered".  Its the "hair-like-strings".  There must have been a confusion with the editing of the recipe, as I recall never mentioning the type of saffron I used when I submitted it. Sorry for any confusion ---

what a great change of pace!  I made this for my husband using black tea and sugar.  It tasted so good that I wanted to try it with green tea and sweetener for myself.  I have to say that I liked the flavor of the saffron and cardamom in both the black and green tea.  A nice change from the usual addition of dried spearmint leaf, or chamomile buds and leaves. I used loose leaf tea instead of bags. Thanks for this nice recipe

Try serving this with Basboosa (the recipe is on this website). They're good together. The first time I attempted this, I used black tea, but I couldn't taste the cardamom. The second time, I used loose leaf green tea. The cardamom and saffron flavors worked beautifully with the green tea.

This is a nice change from just a regular cup of tea.  The spices give it a nice flavor (they are a bit expensive, but should last for quite a while).  If you like tea with a little more/different flavor give this try.

I found this easy and refreshing. I found Darjeeling tea was good with this, as it's not too strong.

its really good . I am kuwaiti girl btw so i know the taste of a true kuwaiti traditional tea . spanish saffron is what we use in our house . you can use threads instead of saffron powder ( u can just ground them to make it > prefer not to just as my grandma does it with threads  ) just make sure to use best quality . i love drinking it with gra'eba  which suits it really well .
and as ( always_hungry ) said basboosa is amazing with it . thanks for publishing this friend .

Delicious as is, but I added a piece of cinnamon stick and a small piece of vanilla bean to see how that would taste, and it's also tasty. :)

An excellent tea, but Khaleejis LOVE their sugar! The original recipe simply doesn't call for enough of it. For authenticity's sake, you'd need 1-2 tablespoons of sugar. But, for westerners, a teaspoon may suffice. And your blood sugar will thank you for it. :) alwazah tea works well in this recipe, but al kbous tea I find to be superior.

I wanted to try this tea because I've never had cardamom before, and it turned out very nicely. The cardamom and saffron add a lovely subtle taste that's a nice change from my regular black tea with milk and sugar.
