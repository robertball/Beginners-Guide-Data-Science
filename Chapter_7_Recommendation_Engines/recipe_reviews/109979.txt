Followed the recipe to the letter, and there's nothing not to like about this.  The texture of the pudding is firm, but still plenty moist and juicy, the corn was crisp, and it simply tasted good.  Very nice side dish.

This was a great way to get the kids to eat their veggies.  I made a few changes just based on what ingredients I had on hand.  I used less corn, added some green beans, used 2% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and seasoning salt instead of plain salt.  I also sauted all of the veggies, not just the onions.  I was afraid that they wouldn't soften enough for my toddlers' tastes.  I really didn't think I was going to like this but wanted to try something new.  It was really good - no left overs even!

"Pudding" is really a misnomer, because--as another reviewer pointed out--this dish is not creamy. It's more like a corn-onion quiche. That being said, I have made this recipe many times. I love the sweetness of the caramelized onions and corn with the cheese and pepper to set it off. I always use milk instead of half and half. Yum!

This is not pudding.  Pudding is creamy.  This ended up being more like a dry side dish
