I use a hard boiled egg yolk for the filling.  Just boil the egg, and press the yolk through a sieve, then mix with the butter and sugar.  It thickens the filling a bit.

This recipe will not open for me? Is anyone else having the same issue? I thought they looked so darling and wanted to look at how they were made. :(
