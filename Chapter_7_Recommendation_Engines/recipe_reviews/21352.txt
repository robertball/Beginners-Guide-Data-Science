Wow this was probably among the top-three fish dishes I've tried. The Habaneros are only sold in bulk at my grocer so I chose to make several recipes this week using them. The blend of flavors is difficult to describe but I can say that it was a a mixture of creamy sweet and pleasing spice. The left over butter mixture can also be spooned over chicken. My compliments!

This recipe was good but, more than anything, I am positively addicted to the habenero lime butter.  I make a bunch and re-refridgerate it in an old butter tub so that I always have it on hand.  I put it on corn on the cob and other fresh veggies...even on cornbread and biscuits.

This recipe is amazing! I have been looking to add more fish to my home cooking, but have always been bored by salmon. This sounded interesting b/c we like spicy in my house, and it was perfect! I actually forgot the butter in the fridge when we started eating and the salmon was still good on its own, but then I remembered the butter and WOW! I plan to do what some others have mentioned and make a big batch of butter to use with other things. Really do be careful with the peppers. My fingers are still burning a day later. Thanks for the recipe, Mike Smith!

Very good.  I couldn't find habanero peppers so I used jalapinos and there really wasnt any heat to it which was a bit of a let down. Besides that I thought it was very good and I'm sure I'll make it again!

Habenero peppers are extremely hot, so I used jalapeno instead.  Some of the best salmon I ever had - not fishy.  I had leftovers on a bed of greens - equally good! I buzzed ing. up in my food processor - makes enough marinade easily for 8 medium pieces of salmon.  I used skinless filets.

This was excellent. I cut back on the habanero in the butter and should have left it as is. Will definitely make again. Too spicy for kids.

Best way to cook fish that I've ever seen.  I never use salmon for this though. Try using fresh Mahi-mahi, it's incredible.

Addicted to habaneros and citrus - live in PNW so I've eaten more salmon than most, and feel like I've had every preparation - this was over the top good (before my fave was salmon marinated in oj and soy with basil, garlic, and olive oil sauce.) This will be in heavy rotation in my household.

This was one of the most flavorful salmon dishes I have ever made. I followed the recipe almost exactly only substituting jalapenos for the habaneros. I will absolutely make this again! Loved it!

I have made this recipe many times. It is just delicious.

Now, many write that they did not have habanero and used jalapeno peppers instead.
You just HAVE to use the habanero peppers. Not only do they impart a special heat, they also have a special flavor. I won't bother with the dish unless I have Habanero. Jalapenos just don't cut it for this dish.

I never use the oil that is called for, it is simply not necessary and only adds  more unwanted calories.

I also bake the salmon. 400 F for 12 minutes, let sit under foil for 10 minutes, and then add the butter...
The butter is to die for on it's own...

One of my all time favorite salmon dishes, always get rave reviews.

This is a great recipe! Thanks Mike! The salmon takes on the citrus flavor and warmth of the habanero and delivers in a big way. I threw a handful of pecan chips on the coals to add a smooth smoky flavor.

We substituted jalepenos for habeneros because we live in a hick town that's never heard of habeneros, but it was still very good!

You must really have to like lime to enjoy this dish.  I would reduce the lime in at least half next time.  Habanero's were plenty spicy and brought on alot of flavor.  Just wasn't into the sauce.

Wonderful recipe, thanks for a great idea!!  I sprinkled a little lime zest on the salmon while on the grill... everybody loved the flavor.  That butter is deceptively spicy!! Takes a couple of minutes before it starts to bite.  This one is a sure repeat.

This was awesome! The butter makes this dish! I omitted the habanera from the butter because I was worried about it being too spicy for me and others, but I regretted having done so. The salmon itself wasn't spicy at all. I couldn't even taste a hint of spicy. However, this was still an incredible dish and will definitely make it again but with the habanera in the butter next time. Thanks for a spectacular recipe!

Mike, you have a real winner here! My husband first tried this while I was out of town
He is not a cook but does well on the grill.
He was so impressed that he called me long distance to rave!  He has since made this for our whol family and it was a huge success
with kids and all. I don/t think any other salmon recipe will measure up!!!!!

Best salmon I ever had! Hot enough for my husband but not too hot for me. Probably too spicy for most kids though, so fix them something else.

Very Good! Next time I will do a couple of things differently. Will cook the salmon on a cedar plank, and also noted that it takes a lot of those little habanero peppers to equal a tablespoon! So, next time will buy more of them for this recipe. The butter was a nice touch. I couldn't get the lime juice and the butter to mix, so I melted it, then let it reset in the refrigerator. Overall, great recipe!

I made this exactly like the recipe except I had to substitute jalapenos for the habaneros (one more reason to start growing my own). Even though it lacked some of the habanero kick, the salmon was extremely flavorful, especially with the butter. I have to admit I was a bit shy about grilling the salmon since I have never grilled fish before, but this was a very easy recipe to cook. I'll definately be making this one again... hopefully with habaneros.

This was easy to prepare. I used the amount of habaneros called for in the recipe and it was not too spicy. Wonderful citrus flavor with a small kick.

My guests loved this recipe!!!  I am a vegetarian, so I didn't eat it...however, my biggest suggestion (as my fingers burn as I type this) is to use disposable gloves to cut the habanero peppers.  I washed my hands immediately and now many hours later, they are still burning...yipes!  This is my first experience with habanero peppers...now I know!

Although I'm not a big salmon fan, I thought this recipe was superb!  The lime/tequila/habanero combo was light-years ahead of the zillions of soy sauce marinades I've tried.  And the butter was fabulous on steamed asparagus.  Thanks a ton for the fine recipe, Mike!  Now I don't have to dread the nights when the salmon-lovers in our family get a craving...

Steelhead was on sale so I subbed that which was still quite amazing. Kinda sad that I didn't use habeneros. Tried using jalepenos and just like all the other reviewers said, not quite spicy enough. All it really did was soak up the citrus tang. Next time I'll have to use a spicier pepper. But the fish was still really good.

This is my favorite salmon recipe.  I've made it a handful of times and everyone that has some, LOVES IT.  A word to the wise though, when slicing the habanero's and making the butter, make sure to wear gloves.  I didn't the first time, and my hands felt like they were on fire all night long.

We liked this a lot but it didn't knock our socks off. I would rate it 4 1/2*s if I could. I cooked this inside on a grill pan, left the habaneros full strength in the marinade (only marinaded for about a couple of hours) but decreased them by almost half in the butter. It had a nice, residual heat w/out too much intensity. Serve it w/ a salad & a frozen, southwestern blend of veggies (corn, poblano peppers, black beans, onions)...the butter was excellent on the veggie blend as well as the salmon. Not our favorite salmon recipe but a definite repeater...thanks Mike Smith!

If there was a 'better than sex salmon', this would be it!!! Easy to make, just the right amount of heat, and the butter was to die for!! Made as stated. Served on a bed of rice. DON'T skip out on the grilling!!

Being an Alaskan resident and having traveled extensively throughout the state I have had the opportunity to sample many salmon recipes. This dish became an instant favorite from the first bite. The wonderful combination of ingredients coupled with fresh Sockeye was refreshingly different. I look forward to introducing this to my family and friends.
Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I'm giving it a 5 star because I ate it!!! I chose this recipe because I don't eat much fish but was asked to cook Salmon which I do not like.  I figured the habanero peppers would have to overpower the taste of anything and happily they did. Since I love hot food, I was able to eat dinner (pushed it around my plate like a 2 year old and hid some of it!) but everyone else  else enjoyed it - two salmon lovers asked for the recipe - so you salmon lovers out there - try it if you like heat to your food!!

What a great combination - I love the spicy marinade with salmon!  Grilled it up on my George Forman and turned out perfect!  Will keep a supply of the butter on hand... was great on the veggies and rolls I had with the salmon.  Boyfriend loved it.  Hot! Hot! Hot!

I'll agree with all the others, this recipe is incredible!!!  This is probably the best fish that I have ever eaten.  I also marinated shrimp in the same bowl as the salmon and grilled it all together. I served it with steamed green beans and grill sliced red peppers with the butter drizzled over all of it.  I was amazing!!!  I will definitely make again

A great spicy salmon recipe.  It has just the right amount of spice with the salmon.   Easy to make and made it for guests.  They all loved it.

This dish was easy and delicious. I only marinated the salmon for two hours and it wasn't too hot (I like hot!) so I will let it sit longer next time. The citrus and the heat were perfect together.

This was very good. I used jalapeno, instead of habanero, because I was afraid it would be too hot.  Next time I would use the habanero, as the jalapeno was flavorful, but had no heat.  I would also make sure to use a thicker salmon fillet next time.  Mine were too thin and dried out a bit during cooking. The butter would be great on other things - I'm thinking cornbread!! Great recipe!

I have to agree with the majority here-This recipe is fantastic!!! The only change I made was type of fish (because the salmon in the store didn't look so great...) and went with tilapia. I served this with some steamed broccoli and cauliflower, which I topped with a dab of the habanero butter and OMG!!! SOOOO GOOD! Between the marinade and the butter, the flavors are so complex and inviting, your mouth will thank you! How something can be rich and also light tasting is beyond me-but this recipe does it! Also, as a side note, I LOVE spicy food, but for those of you who prefer things a little milder, have no fear-the way this fish is marinaded and with the habanero minced up nice and small it's really not very spicy at all, you're not getting a big chunk of hot pepper but a nice subtle flavor. You gotta try this!!!

This is without a doubt going into my regular rotation!  Excellent salmon recipe!  I was shocked at how "mild" the dish was considering there was so much habanero pepper in it.  I was going to cut back on the amount of habanero to decrease the heat, but I'm so glad I didn't.  It was perfect!  Oh, and the butter that you put on top at the end - make extra, it is amazing!

I'm really picky when it comes to how fish is prepared, but this recipe was really good. I substited jalapenos for the habaneros, and it came out good. This will go in my favorites.

This is by far one of the best meals I have ever had.  This is so good.  The butter is so good on asparagus, too.  Try it even if your not a big fan of Salmon.  I have used both habanero pepper (my grocer doesn't always have it) and jalepeno peppers.  I prefer the jalepenos.  You will not be dissapointed.

very good.  The salmon needs to be marinated longer to really retain the flavor though.  Also, I only added about half the recommended amount of habanero peppers because I was afraid it would be too spicy.  Turned out great.

Made this yesterday for an eary fathers day BBQ.  Everyone loved it and we will definitely make it again.  I left the habenaro out of the butter (my mother-in-law does not like spicy food) but did put it in the marinade.  I marinated it overnight in a zip lock bag.  Perfect.

Terrific recipe Mike.  I used orange flavored olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and tossed some steamed snow peas with some of the leftover lime butter.  YUMMY!!  I think the butter was the best part.  It would be good on a number of vegetables.  I had to broil my salmon since it was too cold outside to fire up the grill but will try this again during the warmer months.  Thanks for sharing.

Very very good BUT wild salmon is already a very rich fish on it's own. We didn't use the butter on the fish. We thought it was a bit much but we are probably alone on that one. Instead we put it on fresh broccoli.

This is wonderful!  The lime zest gives the butter such a fresh taste.  I went to two stores looking for habanero peppers and finally settled for jalapenos.  I'll make this again when I have habaneros, but if it is any better, I'm afraid I won't be able to stand it!

I really do try to follow recipes as written.  But my grocery store did not carry habaneros so I had to use jalapeno peppers.  There was no grill at the house where I made this dish so I baked it in the oven.  And, lastly, I used mahi mahi because that was what I had.  The fish was quite moist and spicy, but I'm sure if I had used habaneros and grilled it, the flavors would have been much better.  I will absolutely try this recipe again the way it was originally written!

WONDERFUL!!!  My husband, in-laws, and myself loved this dish, and neither my father-in-law nor myself are big fish eaters!  I did take the seeds out of the habanero peppers, but I may leave a few in next time.  It was not hot for us at all.  The flavors blend together great, and there is no "fishy" flavor.  I just had to try the butter before dinner, and it's great on melba toast!  Will do again soon!

this was very tasty.. we only used this for the marinade.. would like to try the butter though in the future maybe on something that doesn't already have habanero in it.. i'm sure i used less than the amount listed for the orange juice and tripled the amount of tequila.. used less lime zest than called for.. added a couple of teaspoons of kosher salt (we used about 2 lbs of salmon) and marinated the fish for about 3 hours.. flavors were on point.. boiled the marinade and served it over white rice.. so spicy, tangy, just delicious.. ty for the recipe

The flavors did not come out at all on my salmon. I marinated it in a ziploc bag for 2 hours. I followed the recipe exactly as listed and the only flavor came from the butter sauce, which I would have rather avoided to keep it a heart-healthy meal.  I will try marinating it longer next time.

The habanero butter is so good, and like others say, worth making a batch and keeping on hand in the fridge. I've been using it to butter my husband's lunch bagels (with turkey and cheese) and he loves it and has asked me to make more.  I read the recipe wrong and only had time to marinate the salmon for about an hour. This wasn't enough to transfer the flavour and heat into the filet. We were disappointed with how mild and boring it was, but I think that was my fault. The habanero butter rocks though.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made many salmon dishes, each one better than the last.  This is one is tops!   Of course, you have to love spicy, but you wouldn't even look at a habenero recipe if you didn't!  Will make over and over again!

This recipe is definitely going to be making frequent appearances at my dinner table!  I'm not a fan of spicy dishes so I did cut the habenero in half.  I'm glad I did, too, as it would have been a little too spicy for my sensitive tongue.  However, this recipe is so balanced that I wouldn't dare cut the habanero any more than that!  I tried the recipe a second time in a smoker and it was even better!

We really enjoyed this recipe. We substituted Jalapeno peppers for the habanero. They are too spicy for us. The jalepeno still have good flavor to them.

I forgot to buy orange juice and didn't want to go to the store just for that, so I made this without it. Also cooked it in a skillet on the stove top. Apart from that, I made this as written. This was way too spicy for me but Husband said it had a very nice combination of flavors. Thanks, Mike! Nice recipe.

This recipe was decent.  You need to use the full amount of oil to take advantage of all the flavors.  I made it once without the full amount and we didn't end up finishing it.  I think I would marinate it longer and perhaps not baste too much.  Overall a very light recipe, worth doing again with some tweaking for personal preferences.

Both me and my man liked this recipe.  I omitted the tequila (we aren't tequila drinkers) and used part jalapeno and part habanero pepper to play it safer with the heat.  It was still plenty spicy and had a nice south-of-the-border flare.

Excellent!! I baked it on a brolier pan sprayed with Pam at 450 for 30 minutes instead of grilling. I used 0 calorie "spray butter" instead of regular butter to reduce calories. It turned out delicious and is a favorite in my house. I forgot this from a previous experience with habaneros - WEAR GLOVES!! One day I'll try cooking it on the grill, I'm certain it will be even better. Thanks!

OHHHHHH! LORDY!!! This is the best grilled salmon recipe we have ever tried! We did not use the tequila or marinate for 2 hrs, imagine if we did!! Salmon steaks was our choice cut. If you are ever in Belize, purchase Marie Sharp's Green Habanero pepper sauce at the local grocery store. (Not at the airport, 3x as much money)Use it instead of going through the trouble of burning fingers when chopping the peppers. Enjoy!!!

Made this for Father's Day, the habanero gives it excellent flavor.  I agree with previous posters, the butter portion of this could be halved or eliminated.

Very good!  Be careful with the peppers...the oil stays on your skin.  Use gloves!  We used this recipe on a few types of fish with the key limes at our home.  Turns out great...thanks!

The butter got a little too spicy for my husband, I liked it, though.  I am not sure if we would make it again, but probably without the butter.  Too much habanero took away from the flavor of the fish.  I used Wild Alaskan salmon which is higher in fat than the farm raised.

We left the habanero seeds in the marinade, and we still didn't find the salmon too spicy at all.  The butter was interesting, but not something I'd want too often, unless you reduced the amount of lime juice (it's VERY limey).  The dish came out very attractive, although I'd never cooked salmon so I was sure if the skin should be removed?  Maybe someone can address that in a later review!  All in all this was something nice for a change, but we didn't find it as appealing as most other reviewers.

This is a great recipe!  I don't know how anyone could say anything less.  It's a little spicy, that's true, but not anywhere close to being too spicy.  Superb flavoring for salmon!  So not just the boring salmon!  Thanks for putting this recipe out there.

I thought this was okay but not as good as the ratings it has received. I have had salmon that I really loved but usually I am not a fan of salmon so maybe that is why.

Added a little more Pepper, perfect if you love spice.  Also use extra butter for ears of corn. Good stuff.

Not for the faint of palate. An excellent pairing of heat and sweet that goes well with the salmon.

I made this for my husband because he likes grilled salmon, I don't.  But I could have easily eaten this (wished I made more).  This was very good!

I made this for a dinner party on 4th of July. It was a party hosted by a coworker of my boyfriend... I had not met them and didn't know that his wife was a caterer. I offered to bring it because I don't eat meat and wanted to contribute to the meal. A few guests told me that they thought it"brave" of me to bring food to their house since the wife was such an amazing cook. So if course I was worried when it came time to sit down to dinner! No need to worry! Everyone - EVERYONE - raved about it... This salmon was the hit of the evening! Our local grocery didn't have habaneros so I had to use jalapenos. Not as spicy as I thought it would be, so I'd for sure seek out the habaneros next time. I added some honey to the butter which was a nice touch. Lots of butter left over, so can't wait to put it on other foods. I also had some unused marinade left over which I put on a salad for lunch today and it was amazing! Will make this dish again and again and again!!

This was a great date night dish. I used snapper instead of salmon and marinated a few shrimp along with the fish and put everything on the grill. There was a hint of heat but it didn’t over power the seafood. I made lots of the butter and looking forward to using it this week with veggies. Thanks for a great fish recipe.

This is one of my go to recipes - I use quite a bit more habanero than the recipe calls for and I add salt to the butter because using the original recipe, I felt it was a bit bland. But once I bumped those things up, it has become the best prep we've ever tried. I've made it without the tequila and it's fine that way too.

The second time I changed tequila for mezcal, which goes better with orange juice.
Added 2 more garlics, sea salt, and more lemon juice. 
Plates were licked by guests... seriously.

I was originally "Spokanesmith" who rated this back in 2003 for my then boyfriend and now husband.  I swear this salmon convinced him to propose!  12 years later, 10 of which we've been married, this is still his favorite all-time meal.  Being a native of the PNW, that says a lot, as salmon recipes are floating around everywhere.  We make the butter every 6 months or so for random veggies, etc.  This 4th of july weekend, we'll have it on our corn on the cob.  Thank you, Mike Smith, for posting :)

Went to the liquor store to purchase tequila for this recipe.  Bought an airplane bottle and put it in my purse.  Well, guess where it was this morning.  This recipe is phenomenal!  I marinated the salmon about 4 hrs.  Great taste, kicked up with the habaneros.  Can't wait to try it with the tequila...lol

Really enjoyed this recipe! Turned out to be quite a hit! The salmon stayed nice and moist and the butter was absolutely amazing. I didn't quite taste enough marinade flavor in the fish without the butter but I let it marinade for only 2 hours if that. Next time I'd definitely makes sure to marinade it for 4 hours I'd not even longer. Also this wasn't hot at all, meaning everyone enjoyed it! The habaneros added a good zing and just a hint of heat.

I think I just made the best tasting meal I've ever made. I went with Scotch Bonnet Peppers instead of Habanero. I agree with everybody...that homemade Scotch Bonnet (in my case) Lime Butter was so yummy; I'm happy there's lots left over. On the side I made Jamaican Sweet Potato Fries with an Avacado Lime dip, and I got to try my newly purchased Vegetable Spiralizer and made Zuchinni Pasta. The salmon was too die for; so juicy and so many flavors. I love hot and I thought it was going to be too hot, but the balance was excellent. Thanks goodness I made enough for tomorrrow. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe; I'll be making this again and again and again.

My husband loves salmon and he says this is the best way he has ever had it prepared.  He even prefers it to the salmon we order in most restaurants!  This is a standby in our house.  Thanks for the amazing recipe.

This was pretty good-I could not find a habanero pepper, so I subbed jalapeno instead.  It was too cold to grill outside, so I broiled the salmon for 10 minutes.

I thought this recipe was excellent and gave the salmon a wonderful flavor. Plus we love anything spicy and habaneros are just the thing for a nice kick! I made this with sweet potato fries and rice. Great meal!

The salmon was great and I will definitely make this again.  A few things: I didn't have a habanero so I used a jalepeno.  It was ok, but we like a little more spice, so next time I will use the habanero.  Also, the salmon steaks at the store didn't look that great, so I used 1 lb sockeye salmon fillet.  It was fabulous, moist, and perfect for two.  It did take longer to cook though.  We grilled it skin side down on a gas grill for 15-20 minutes.  We will definitely be making this again!

Very nice flavor! Not as spicy as I expected but that's probably b/c I used jalapenos instead of habaneros. Also made with trout instead of salmon. I bet the marinade and butter sauce is good on just about anything. I will definitely be making this again and experiment with different fishes!

This is GREAT! I loved this. Me and my mom thought this would be a little dry being cooked right on the grill because we always but ours in foil. But wow this was moist! The only thing I would change is to add a little less lime. And I love lime but it was a little too much tart for my taste I guess. But I am sending this recipe to all my family and we are going to make this again and again!

This recipe received rave reviews at my house. I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out lime zest, the juice alone gave it lots of flavor.    Adults & kids loved it.  The habanero-lime butter was delish on the fish, our bread and the grilled veggies I made to go with the meal.

This was great as is.  I did not have to change a thing!  I added the butter to some brown rice and served with snow peas (when eaten after the spicy salmon and rice, it tamed the intenisty a little).

This was awesome!!! My whole family admitted it was the best salmon they have ever had!
I marinated for 1hr20min but I wish I did more for I feel the lime would have came out more.
The butter was to hot I couldn't taste the fish so I recommend just pouring plain old melted butter over it.
I grilled the salmon on a cedar plank too. I cannot think of a better meal.
It went great with wild rice.

I don't own a grill, so I just fried salmon steaks in a pre-heated pan; about 4 -5 minutes on each side.

I also substituted some other pepper for the habenero because I couldn't find it in my market, and I really noticed a strong lack of spiciness.

But even with these substitutions, the salmon was *delicious* and very rich.

FUNominal! We're used to hot. Agree with cutting down on the butter. Either that, or put in on your fresh grilled Jersey corn! Yum!

This was fantastic.  Beware to watch the handling and amount of the habaneros.  I ended up wasting a $40 piece of fresh caught alaskan salmon and miserably burning my fingers with the oils.  The next batch I was much smarter.  Sooo yummy I've now tried it on shrimp and got similar results.

The salmon was very good.  I didn't have any lime juice on hand so I substituted lemon and the result was delicious.  I also used probably 3 Tbsp habanero pepper and a whole head of garlic because I like things spicy and garlicky.  The result was surprisingly not overpowering.  The butter was a bit much, as other reviewers noted.  I only made 1/4 of the butter because my boyfriend doesn't use it, and 1/4 of the recipe was about 2x as much as I needed.  If you like a lot of butter, don't alter the amount, but if you just like a small dab, 1/4 of the recipe is enough for 2 people.

We loved this recipe, but it was spicy hot.  I will make it definately make it again.  However, it your guests don't like anything hot,  I would suggest the Grilled Orange and Bourban Salmon which we also consider a 5 Star Recipe.
