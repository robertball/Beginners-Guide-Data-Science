As is, it's four stars. Only because it's not very root beer-y in flavor. The first time I saw this recipe was in a Supermoist cake recipe book and I made it according to recipe, even with the crushed root beer barrels on top. Today, when I made it, I added about a tsp. and a half of root beer flavoring concentrate and I made a Cool Whip Topping (1 container Cool Whip, 1 small box instant pudding, 1 c. milk and one tsp. of vanilla flavoring).
This time, it was much more float-like
and really incredible. Consider my changes if you decide to make this cake.
This cake is a real crowd pleaser. The smell of this cake while it's baking is amazing.

I make this cake all the time! For best results, I let the frosted cake sit in the refrigerator overnight for the root beer flavor to get stronger.  I also add 1/4 teaspoon root beer extract to the cake mixture.

I made cupcakes with this recipe and took it to a Father's Day cookout.  After reading the reviews, I decided to add the rootbeer concentrate (all I could find at the store.  Is it the same as extract?)to the batter.  The long mixing time made these light and airy.  I also made the Cool Whip/vanilla pudding frosting and added a little rootbeer concentrate to that too.  Crushed rootbeer barrels on top were great, but don't add them too early before serving because they kind of melt in the topping.  I was told that I had to make these again.

With some modifications this is a 5 star. I made cake as is, but added 1 1/2 tsp. root beer concentrate to the cake mix. I used heavy whipping cream instead of the boxed stuff and added powdered sugar, vanilla extract and root beer concentrate. Using fresh whipped cream is way better than the boxed stuff. The root beer tast is there but subtle. I used 2 9" round pans put the whipped cream in the middle and frosted the cake with it too.

I must preface my review by stating I did change the recipe out of necessity.  However, I like that it shows how versatile the recipe is so I'm rating it anyway.  I planned to make 1/2 a batch w/a box white cake mix, using the other 1/2 for Jello Shot cupcakes, so I made the mix according to box directions. Too late, i realized I was supposed to use root beer in place of water.  I decided to go ahead and make them anyway, and simple subbed 3 tsps of root beer extract to a regularly prepared white box cake mix and it worked out great!  I already had some butter cream frozen, so I simply used that (Butter Cream II from here) w/Root Beer Extract added for flavor.  These are a nice change of pace from *regular* cupcakes and I'll DEF make again (I can't wait to make them in MUGS!).  TY for a great recipe!

This is truly one of the very best and very easiest cakes I have ever made.  It's so different!  Everyone that has tried it has absolutely loved it.  I'm making it tonight, and think I will try adding the root beer extract to strenghten the root beer flavor a little.

This is a quick recipe but I was looking for something more. I tweaked the recipe by adding 2tsp. of Rootbeer Concentrate. I think a vanilla buttercream frosting will work with my 2nd attempt.

The cake was ok but will follow the advice of others next time and use some root beer flavour as without it I couldn't even taste the root beer in the cake at all.    Did not like the frosting at all.  Next time I think I will just make my own frosting and add some root beer extract to that as well.

These are perfect with these changes...2 tsp root beer extract and I just used a plain cool whip frosting. This was just the right amount of root beer flavor and so it wasn't even needed in the topping. Thanks for the reviews...and of course thanks for submitting this recipe.

I made this for a Labor Day cook out. It was amazing! Super moist!!!! I did add the Root Beer Concentrate to the cake( 1 1/2 tsp root beer concentrate added) and cool whip topping  (1 tub cool whip, French vanilla instant pudding, 1 cup milk, 1/2 tsp root beer concentrate, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract) that I made. I crushed up root beer barrel candies and left in a dish on the side as an optional topper. The kids liked the additional topping! It taste just like a root beer float. My daughter is requesting this for her Birthday with the additional topping. For her Party I think I will put the cool whip topping in the center of the cup cake and add a chocolate ganache to it and then add a cut straw to each to make it seem more like a float.

I wanted a true flavor and I got it with a few tweaks to this recipe.  I used BC Moist White Cake mix and added two teaspoons of Root Beer flavoring and combined two Root Beers ... A&W and Barq's to make up the flavor I wanted.  I also dropped a touch (1 tsp) of Root Beer soda flavoring into the cake mix to color the batter and the cupcakes came out with the best flavor and color of any of the RB recipes I tried.  Normally the first batch I make cooks slightly smaller than the second, but in this case, they cooked exactly the same.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.  Thank You Tammy!

This was very good!!  I will make it again for sure!  I only gave it 4 stars because I added root beer extract as recommended and am glad I did.  It would not have had enough flavour without it.  I made icing using Nutriwhip (1 c with 1 c brown sugar and 1 tsp flavouring) and used the root beer extract rather than vanilla.  Delicious!! Some mentioned the cake was dry.  4 min seems a long time to beat it.  That did make it fluffy but maybe beating about 2 min after blending would make it more moist.   Anyway it is, I like it!!

Very good! I added 1-1/2 teaspoons root beer extract to the cake batter and opted to use a buttercream frosting instead of the whipped topping. Made into cupcakes and everyone loved them. Thanks :)

It has some rootbeer flavor in it, but only if you know its there. Still, they are delicious and very moist.

I doubled the recipe for 44 cupcakes and added 3 tsp root beer concentrate, but would have added more if I did it again.  I could not find the extract ANYWHERE near me (Kroger, Whole Foods, Target, Hobby Lobby), but found the concentrate at a Super WalMart.  This has a very bland root beer flavor, a strong root beer scent.  I added root beer concentrate to a buttercream frosting and that made the flavor better.  Great idea, but I won't be making this again.

This cake was just average, and I probably won't make it again.  It just a hint of root beer flavor that was good for a change.  I did like the icing though and think it would be good with different flavors of soda.

I really liked the idea of this cake, which I ended up making into cupcakes for my kids, who love root beer.  The cupcakes were great, but that's because they don't really taste like root beer.  The frosting came together very nicely, but we felt the root beer flavor was too strong in that.  The two just didn't complement each other.  I think we would have eaten the cupcakes if they had a different frosting.

I did have to do a little bit of tweaking like some others did. I added root beer extract to the cake mix, about 3/4 teaspoon. And I used the freezer whip cream, I added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the whip cream to give it more of a root beer float foam flavor. My family loved it.

Easy to make with a light, root beer taste.  A little bland and no one in the family got too excited about it.  Sorry.

I would definitely make this cake again, it was good with cool whip instead of the suggested topping.  It sounds like a cake for kids, but I think anyone who likes root beet would like it!

Only reason it doesn't get a full 5 stars is the cake definitely needs the root beer extract to get the full root beer effect (1 1/2 tsp).  I used root beer soda base that we happened to have on hand from trying to make homemade root beer.  Bought at a homebrew/wine store.  This is a very moist cake and does best baked and kept in a cake pan or cupcakes.  I tried to use this recipe by doubling for the Wilton giant cupcake pan and while it came out of the pan fine, the cake was so soft that it literally fell apart, it could not hold the form.  Just a tip for anyone else considering the same thing.  I'd definitely try this cake again but use their tips to make it into more of a pound cake.  We did eat the pieces though and it was awesome all the same!

I was so excited to try this for my mother-in-law's birthday and was SO disappointed.  Not only did the cake not have much root beer flavor (my grocery store does not carry root beer extract), the frosting was a total FLOP.  I tried to fix the frosting, but once I got it to the point of being able to sort of scoop it onto the cupcakes, all the root beer flavor was gone.  HUGE disappointment.  :(

It turned out very good, but I only gave it 3 stars because I made 2 changes. I made as is, but when it was done I poked holes in the cake and poured a mixture of 1 cup powered sugar to 1/2 cup of root beer(maybe it was a little more root beer I just eye balled it) over the top. I made my frosting with 1 box instant vanilla pudding mixed with 1 cup milk then folded in 1 tub of cool whip.

I have made this several times and unless you add a lot of root beer extract, it doesn't taste like root beer. I use cool whip on top with A&W sundae topper. It is a really good summer dessert.

Was a very moist cake. Will add Root Beer extract next time for more Root Beer taste.

I made this cake.  I was glad I read the reviews first.  It definately need more rootbeer extract in both the cake and frosting to give it flavor.  I would probably not make it again.  It didn't go over very well at my party.

I really liked this cake, however I think that dream whip (the whipped topping mix I used) sets up much better when you use milk (as called for on the packet). Made with the root beer it just, well, deflated. Next time I would follow the recipe exactly, except use milk in place of root beer in the frosting mix and add a teaspoon of root beer extract, instead of root beer in the frosting.

The cupcakes tasted good but they were VERY difficult to take out of the pan because they were so sticky and fragile. I probably won't make these again.

Best way to describe this recipe is bland and nothing special. It was one of 3 cakes I made to bring to a party. The other 2 everyone loved but this cake only had a few pieces gone by the end of the night. Saw a couple of those pieces in the garbage still on their plates. That says it all!

Because other reviewers had suggested adding root beer concentrate or extract, I planned to do that.  However, as I was making the cake I discovered mine had dried up.  I made the cake as the recipe states, but decided to alter the frosting.  I used Cool Whipped Frosting and prepared it as directed.  However, I took about 1/3 of the frosting and added 2 tsp. of root beer extract that I'd gone out and bought.  I spread this evenly over the cake then topped it with the remainder of the frosting.  This added the more intense root beer flavor that the cake needed, while still keeping the white "float" concept of the frosting, and the brown layer between the cake and white frosting looked nice.  It worked so well I think I would do it the same way if I made the cake again.  Nine people ate and loved the cake.

I made this cake as submitted, and it was good, but made it again adding 2 tsp root beer concentrate, and it was AWESOME. I also made the topping with a container of coolwhip, a small box of vanilla pudding, a cup of milk, and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. YUMMY!!!

These were unique.  I'm definately going to make them again and use the root beer extract everyone else is talking about.  I couldn't find it the day I needed it, but I will hunt it down for the next time.  I made them for my 2 daughter's birthday party and everyone thought it was great that they were eating rootbeer cupcakes!!

This was a good cake, but I really couldn't taste any root beer.  I even added some extra root beer extract, and it just tasted like a regular white cake.

combined 2 recipes. only used two eggs. after reading many reviews I added 1.5 tablespoons root beer extract to cake batter. After baking cake for 30 min. took out promptly, when thoroughly cooled I flipped cake over and put back in 9 x13. After poking holes in cake with toothpick I poured glaze on top. Glaze recipe was 9 tablespoons of root beer soda, 1 T RB extract and 1.5 cups powdered sugar. Finally, On top of all I added freshly whipped cream with RB soda and powdered sugar mixed in (to taste) spread over all cake and refrigerated overnight. Wow.

Made this with the Pillsbury gluten-free yellow cake mix and A&W root beer, and added just less than 3tsp root beer concentrate to cake while mixing (the cupcakes would NOT have had any root beer flavor otherwise). I went by the recipe timing for baking the first dozen cupcakes, and they were extremely overdone, so for the next round I followed the timing on the Pillsbury box and they were perfect. (Also the gf mix only made 19 cupcakes.) As others have mentioned, I used the cool whip/pudding/vanilla extract frosting, and the end result was delicious. Will make these again for a fun treat.

The cake turned out pretty crumbly.  I live at 4500 feet, so I probably should have used the cake mix high-altitude directions (didn't think about it until it was baking). I added 1.5 tsp root beer concentrate, which did give it a root beer flavor, and I used the cool whip/pudding mix frosting, which was alright. Given the crumbliness of the cake, I would have actually preferred a more substantial buttercream or sour cream frosting.  Overall it was a Fathers' Day root beer-themed-meal success, but I probably won't make it again.

My kids request this for their birthday cakes! I followed others advice - used 2 t. root beer extract in the cake (in addition to the root beer) and I used 1 container Cool Whip vanilla frosting, thawed, and used a whisk to whip 2 t. root beer extract into it (no root beer pop). Word of caution - the root beer extract adds a strong root beer flavor, which our family likes - you may want to start with 1 t. and adjust as needed.

This was a hit!  Very unique - we all loved it!  I did make a few changes.  I'm not a fan of cake mixes, so I used my own white cake recipe.  I also added root beer extract to boost the flavor.

These were a fresh idea that my boyfriend loved!  I followed the advice of adding root beer extract to both the cake and the frosting.  But I got a little carried away with it because the root beer taste was over bearing.  I added mayonnaise to the batter to make them more moist and made my own frosting of whipped cream, powdered sugar and cream cheese along with the root beer and extract.  I colored them green for St Patty's which threw everyone off of what flavor they were.  They tasted good if you knew it was root beer float flavor...quite the brain teaser!

AMAZING!! My only word of advice if you make them into cupcakes and fost them with by piping then you will need to double the frosting. I ran out and I was going easy thinking this might happen. But the flavor is just like a root beer float! :)

Followed recipe but added rootbeer extract, as recommended by others. Thank goodness, or there would be zero flavour. I also found them a little dry, but maybe that's just me. I think it's the novelty of the flavour that's more exciting than the actual taste.

I've made this a couple of times for birthday parties - everyone liked it. It doesn't have a super strong rootbeer taste but I don't think it should be overpowering anyway. It's great if you want something a little different and lighter than the typical chocolate cake or cake with heavy buttercream frosting.
