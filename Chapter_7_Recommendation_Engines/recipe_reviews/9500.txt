I love egg nog and used a very flavorful brand of it. However, all you can really taste is the nutmeg. 5 different people said the same thing...Where's the eggnog flavor? It is a decent cookie to have with coffee, but only if you like semi-crispy cookies. I even cut down the baking time by 5 minutes and they still came out crispier than I expected. Not a recipe I plan to use again. Sorry.

I love eggnog so I thought that this would be a tasty cookie to make for a cookie exchange.  I did not take them because they were not very special! I took advise from other reviews and used 3/4C of eggnog and only 1/4t. nutmeg. I dusted the top w/ a mixture of nutmeg,cinnamon and powdered sugar, which helped the blandness of the cookie.  They were just O.K..

All the recipes for Eggnog cookies at this site are the same. It is a little frustrating since they say they don't duplicate recipes. Anyways, this one adds 1/4 cup more flour and I seem to like it better.  Taste like the cookies from "Mrs. Field's". I sprinkle them with green sugar to give them a little bit of color. Quick and easy.

If you leave out the nutmeg, you'll taste the eggnog.  I made a quick glaze with the eggnog as well and it enhanced the taste quite a bit! An easy way to use up the leftover eggnog in the frig!

These cookies turned out awesome! A big hit. Nice and soft and chewy. I didn't have nutmeg so that was the only thing missing but they are still great. Love the eggnog flavor.  I dropped them by spoon and some of them kind of look a bit "rough" - no big deal because the taste is fantastic but next time I might shape into balls a bit to make them look a little neater. These are a going to be made every year in my house. Thank you for the great recipe!

I shared in a  cookie exchange this year and everyone just loved this recipe. It was too bad I could not claim the credit for it. Excellent flavor and nice texture. I am making more today for my family.

Yummy! I was a little hesitant to try the recipe, some of the reviews state it doesn't taste like eggnog, too much nutmeg, crispy dry cookies.  Well I made them this morning as per the recipe, and they are fabulous!  Chewy, soft, eggnoggy, just plain Yumtastic!  I can see how people may overcook them, they just need to be a light light brown on the bottom of the cookies, they are soft on the inside, and have a nice crunch on the outside. Oh goodness, I am addicted. If you've made them before and they weren't all that great try it again, you'll get it right.

Of the four cookie recipes I made in the past two days, this one was my least favorite.  It was very good, but I felt that it was the messiest cookie dough so far, and took the longest, and didn't stand up to the flavor of the other cookies I made.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor is EXCELLENT, and reminds me of a snickerdoodle in some ways.  But I think there are many other cookies I'd rather be making.  (Though, EATING is a different story.)

I baked these tonite for a function at work tomorrow.  I like spice cookies so I didn't alter the amount of cinnamon or nutmeg, but I did add a little bit more butter and walnuts and cranberries.  I did rounded tablespoons on my silpat and baked for 15 minutes and no more than 3 minutes after that.  They turned out moist, soft and the cranberry and walnut helped offset the spiciness of the cookie.  I thought it might turn out bad, but they turned out really good!

My family and I love these cookies! They are so tasty and delicious. Only thing is that they do take quite a bit longer to cook then the recipe states. These have been a Christmas cookie staple for 3 years now.

These have a slight eggnog taste and not a huge eggnog wow.  Depending on your preference this could be a bonus or a hindrance.  I used lactose free eggnog and butter flavored shortening due to milk intolerance--I don't know if it made any difference, but my cookies were perfectly pillow soft at 20 minutes.  These would be great with some gingerbread coffee or some spiced tea.  I added an extra 1/4 tsp of each of the spices as soy milk eggnog tends not to be as spiced as milk based nog.  This is definitely a keeper for us!  Kid approved!

These cookies were good, but the texture is not what I was hoping for. The cookies come out like a thinner sugar cookie texture.

I read the reviews after already mixing these up. (Oops) My remedy was an icing  3/4 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons eggnog and a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Made the cookies with a small trigger handled ice cream scoop and dipped each to cover the top. I am being scolded for limiting people to two!!! Hahaha, will keep thos recipe as my cookie base :)
