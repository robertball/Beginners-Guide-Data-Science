YUM! I doubled the recipe because hubby loves butter tarts and I just didn't have the time to make them today. It doubles very well (in a 9 x 13 pan)!  I used a little smash of cinnamon in the crust and rum extract instead of vanilla in the filling.  I might try maple extract next time. Overall, an excellent square!

Great square!  I just added it to my traditional list of Christmas baking.  It was fast and easy to do and if you refrigerate it for an hour or so you can cut it real nice into 1" squares.  I like to make treats like these bite size so you can try several different ones from a cake & cookie  platter.  Thanks for sharing.

I made two batches (one with raisins, one without) and both were way too sticky to cut and remove from the pan.  I tried baking them an extra 10 minutes, let them thoroughly cool and tried again with a tad more success.  Tasted good but I had to use them as ice cream topping, not squares.

Fabulous recipe! I don't understand why anyone is saying the crust is bland. Using tart shells or making your own does not make for a better tasting crust. The yummy part is the filling and these were great! I made a batch with and without raisins and they both came out great. I used a 9x13 pan so the crust wasn't as thick as some said it would be. I also baked them for 35 minutes, then let them cool completely and put them into the fridge for an hour to set before cutting. Perfect!! These are far better than the tart shells - its a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did differently, was omit the raisins because my husband prefers these bars without them.  These bars are a new favourite and will be made again and again!

I followed the directions given to the T, however, I am disappointed to say that the recipe didn't turn out.  The filling didn't set and was definitely too sweet.  The shortbread pastry was O.K., but a little underdone.  I think I'll stick to the butter tart recipe instead.

These were great and easy to make, HOWEVER I found that adding the vinegar gave it a bitter aftertaste and not as much the buttery aftertaste you want from butter tarts...i have made a recipe before without the vinegar and it turned out fine.........has anyone else experienced this or know why the vinegar is added?

These were great, I added a little salt to the pastry, and added a little rum extract to the raisans and let them soak in 1/2 cup of water for 1/2hour.

I am a Canadian, living in Namibia for 3 years.  I wanted to make my Book Club ladies something somewhat authentically Canadian, and didn't want the fuss of actual butter tarts.  These fit the bill quite nicely.  I looked at several other recipes from other sites and decided to scale down the flour to 1 cup and it was slightly crumbly but still easy to cut without falling apart.  I enjoy a shortbread crust, but those saying it's bland may want to try grinding up some walnuts or pecans and putting that in the base, may add just the flavour you need.  I doubled the recipe and made one with raisins, and one with walnuts and coconut; I was a bit disappointed that the filling was quite firm, and was actually looking forward to a more gooey, drip down your chin, finger lickin' mess...that being said, the flavour was delicious!  I might make more filling next time, to increase the filling to ratio crust.  My mum always used currants in her butter tarts, and will try this recipe with that as well.  Will definitely make again and work on getting the gooey factor...the ladies all loved it incidentally, and most asked for the recipe!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the crust was overwhelmingly bland to me and too thick.  The topping was fine, but I didn't really feel like it was less time consuming than making butter tarts using premade crusts.  I won't make this again.

These were better than actual butter tarts! The top layer is just the right texture to hold together and yet be a bit liquid enough to leave a drizzle down your chin while you eat them.

Very easy to make and they turned out great. The toping was soft but did not make a mess and the shortbread crust not too crumbly. I only cooked the topping for 35 minutes and next time I may try baking them a little bit less for an even softer topping.

Absolutely awesome. Moist, chewy, everything you want either in a square or a tart!  I only had 1/2 cup of raisins, and that was lots.  I can't imagine a full cup.

Great stuff! The filling and dough were both tasty. I didn't add raisins, and found I liked them better that way, but it could be a matter of personal preference. Quick and easy, and just as good as tarts (maybe better!).

These were great! I didn't have any raisins when I made them, so I used some chopped walnuts and some shredded coconut (I'm not sure how much- I don't measure stuff). My family ate them all before they were even cooled off! Many burned but very happy tongues!

I make this at least once a month...my husband likes it with raisons and my kids like chicolate chips...instead of the full cup of raisons i split it in half and  place raisons/chips accordingly afer I pour the filling on the base.

Way too many raisins, and the crust is too crumbly.  I will try some other recipes.  Not bad but not the best recipe.

This is the first buttertart square recipe I have made in years that actually turned out with a crust that was not too hard.

I lined the pan with parchment, cooled in the fridge, took it out onto a cutting board and then cut into perfect squares.

I also added vanilla, rum, and cinnamon but not vinegar.

Baked it for 5 minutes less as I could already see it was set.

really excellent! I made them mostly as written but I added a touch of salt and some vanilla to the crust.  I also pierced the crust all over with a fork before baking it. I also topped it with pecans before baking it. Super delicious and perfect texture.

Very tasty! However, the base was very crumbly. I'll have to try the recipe again  and press the base in more firmly and perhaps bake it a little longer before adding the topping.  
I did find that after refrigerating,  the base was less less crumbly and did cut better.

One of my go to recipes for dessert. I have started 1/2 the recipe so that there is not any leftovers. Works lovely, cut the cooking time to 25 minutes and use a loaf pan. As good as the full version without the leftovers to nimble on. I use the butter as oppose to margarine. Always reminds me of mom's butter tarts. Simply put, just yummy!!!!

I LOVE this recipe! They are sweet, soft and full of the classic flavor. It gets really bubbly near the end and you think they are going to burn on top, but after the sugar stops boiling it gets nice and thick and perfectly sticky. They cut easily as long as you cook them long enough and let them cool. Will make it over and over again.

Don't change anything!  I lost my mom's recipe and I am sure this is the exact one.  Nice and gooey filling.  Perfection.  When you don't have time to make a proper tart with a pasty shell, use this one for a quick treat!

taste of these is OK - but filling was overcooked at 350 degrees after being in there for just under 35 minutes. sides are all caramelized and sticky as a result. base falls apart. i would not make this again.

Even my boyfriend who isn't crazy about baking liked these.  I only had enough butter for the filling and used margerine for the crust.  It turned out great!  It didn't fall apart at all.

Quick, easy and delicious.   I prepared a double batch to go to an office luncheon and everyone wanted the recipe.  Highest compliment -  "Reminds me of Grandma's Butter Tarts".   I also dribble a little real maple syrup over the top as soon as it gets out of the oven.
