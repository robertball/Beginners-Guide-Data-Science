Peanut butter is the perfect addition to hot chocolate. Just make sure your hot chocolate is hot enough to melt the PB so you don't end up with peanut butter chunks on the bottom of your mug. The first time I made this I didn't make the milk hot enough, and the second time I just melted the PB in the microwave and it mixed in better. It's a nice tasty drink for a cold day:)

I didn't try this, but the youngun' made it and she loved it. Nothing like waiting until the temp reaches 60 degrees to make a cup of hot chocolate!
Thanks Cindy!

I loved this! It was great. I do have 2 suggestions though: 1) If you really like peanut butter, 2 teaspoons might not be enough for you. 2) Melt the peanut butter before you put it in.

Gross.Absolutely nasty. I love chocolate and peanut butter but not like this.  The peanut butter makes the hot chocolate greasy and when it cools off the peanut butter coagulates. It sounds good but it's really not.  Please don't waste your time with this.

Uh, no. Made this for the boys. They took one drink and refused to drink any more. I tried, just not for us. Maybe if I made a homemade hot cocoa and added peanut butter?

I saw this recipe and thought it was neat of the idea to put peanut butter and hot chocolate together. My sister and I  kind of did the recipe a little different. We used crunchy Peanut Butter instead of Creamy. Because of the fact that we were making hot chocolate for four people we decided to make it a little easier. We put warm milk, crunchy peanut butter, and hot chocolate mix and then mixed it in a blender. After, we put marshmellows and served it. It was WONDERFUL!!!! But other then that GREAT recipe and very good idea. It tasted Butter Fingers.

I think this is a good drink, if modified.  I LOVE peanut butter so when I first tried the recipe, as is, I thought it was very weak, but with potential.  The next time I made it I used 2 Tbsp instead of 2 tsp and it was perfect.  I do recommend heating the peanut butter first, as others have recommended.

I would eat peanut butter off of the bottom of my shoe, so this was a drink for me. I put the milk and the peanut butter (used 2 Tbls as suggested) into the microwave together and it seemed to eliminate the need to melt the peanut butter separately. If you have a texture fetish, you might not like it once it has cooled to gulping temperature (as opposed to sipping temperatures), because one previous reviewer was right when she said it coagulates. Solution? Drink it while it's hot. I drink this for a quick breakfast sometimes, and it is very satisfying.

I'm only sorry that I didn't try this sooner.  I think the key is to make sure you make you cocoa really hot and mix it a lot while still hot, I think this helped mix the peanut butter into the cocoa.  Jif creamy natural worked fine for me.  Thank you so much for the recipe, it's delicious!

I read the reviews first on this. My cocoa packet said mix with 6oz of water, so I followed that exactly, which I don't normally do. For the peanut butter I used skip creamy "natural." I figured it would be less greasy using a peanut butter without vegetable shortening in it, which is all I ever have in the house anyway. The directions said add 1-2 tsp. of peanut butter. I did 1 level tsp. but I have to say, I could barely taste any peanut butter though. It tasted more like chocolate and peanuts. But, I think it would be good with whipped cream and peanut butter or chocolate topping.

I have to admit - when I found this recipe, I was thinking it wasn't going to turn out as great as it did.  But today, we were having a rather blustery, cold day with only a 1/2 day of school.  So I made this for a snack for my kids (who love pretty much anything peanut butter/chocolate).  I topped it with whipped cream and a drizzle of peanut butter that I had heated.  I sampled, and oh, my, it's good.  It all melted together so perfectly and was like a liquid peanut butter cup.  One of my kids was away, and is so jealous of the other 2, so I am making it again tomorrow for her.  So easy, and so good.

Pretty good, this tasted like a butterfinger or reese's which is a good thing if you like that. And I do. The only drawback is at the bottom of my cup were bits of sludgy peanut butter that hadn't stirred in. Maybe a little less PB next time too. Thanks.

Do not use natural peanut butter!  The consistency is not as smooth and will not blend as well.  I would recommend this as a fun winter drink.  It is a really easy way to satisfy a sweet tooth!

This is pretty good. My peanut butter wouldn't melt right away so I mixed everything added extra PB and then I put back in the microwave for an extra minute. Then I cooled it down with ice cubes. It is really good then.

This was soooo amazingly good, reminded me of melted peanut butter cups. Sooo delicious, I recommend this to anyone who loves chocolate and peanut butter together. Also, I would melt the peanut butter before adding it to the hot chocolate. OMG soo good :)

It was delicious, but it's a good idea to keep stirring it periodically while you drink; otherwise you'll end up at the bottom with weird-textured peanut butter remnants.

i tried this with cruchy and smooth peanut butter and even though I am a lover of cruchy, the smooth was just way better. But, evn though the hot chocalate was tastey, it had a weird texture.

I threw a single serving cocoa mix, milk, and tablespoon of peanutbutter into my Cocomotion. It worked quite well and was tasty; that is, until the cocoa cools down. As the drink cools it becomes greasy and leaves peanutbutter sludge in the bottom of your mug. It's a nice, occasional change for the frequent cocoa drinker. 

Overall, I'd suggest just finding the Butterfinger Hot Chocolate packets at a grocery.

This was awesome!  I can't believe I didn't think of this myself!  It is so yummy.  I melted the  pb first as others suggested, and that seemed to work.  It was so, so yummy.  I will make this for fellow pb and chocolate lovers.  Thanks for sharing.

I have never really cared for hot chocolate packets from the store and decided to try this.  It makes the cocoa taste wonderful.  I believe it was the best hot chocolate I have ever had.  I will definitely use this from now on to dress up my hot chocolate.

I mix it with boiling water in the blender and then add milk to cool it down.  Between the boiling water and the blender it mixes perfectly and doesn't get clumpy when it cools down.

Not as good as it sounded to me.  The PB taste wasn't very discernable, until you get to the bottom of the  cup where it's kind of clumped up.  I even melted the PB before stirring in, but it doesn't really mix in very well.  I don't know if it's worth the effort.

Ymmm! This was really good! It's April, and you may think it's odd to be drinking hot chocolate at this time of year.. but it's SNOWING! The peanut butter was a great punch to an already delicious drink!

I'm a chocolate peanut buttercup addict lately so when I saw this recipe I had to try it. I must admit that I was anticipating that it would turn out badly, but it didn't! The peanut butter mixed in there nicely and it had the best after taste.The only thing that I didn't like was that after a while the peanut butter started coming up and making it taste kind of slimey. None the less,this recipe is definatly a keeper.

This isn't a recipe,  let me know when you come up with something worth making: "powdered hot chocolate with a dollop of peanut butter"  just didn't cut it.

Perfect for an afternoon snack on a cold winter's day.  I like drinking my hot chocolate very hot so didn't have the clumpy peanut butter issues that other reviewers have noted.  I used a regular sachet mix of hot chocolate and it will be interesting to see how this recipe goes with diet hot chocolate mixes.  Thanks for the recipe, Cindy.

at first, it tasted really good. the peanut butter was a nice addition, but after the cocoa started to cool (i like to savor the taste and not drink it too fast, and i had one too many tongue burnings), the chunks of the peanut butter that had sunk to the bottom found each other and began to regroup and i'm not one to like chunks/pulp/fruits/surprises on the bottom. but that's my own opinion. but all in all, it wasn't a failure. i guess in order for me to enjoy it, i should drink it faster.
