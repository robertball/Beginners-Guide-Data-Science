This recipe comes together very quickly and tastes great. Add a salad and you've got dinner on the table in no time. I used leftover meat from a rotisserie chicken that I took out of the freezer and thawed. I also omitted the cilantro because my husband doesn't like it.

This was a very quick and easy recipe to put together. I followed the recipe. Though it didn't say what type of salsa, so I used salsa verde which is my favorite and with enchiladas. I bought a pack of handmade flour tortillas from Trader Joes. It had 8 in the pack, but they were a descent size to use. I lined a 13x9 with the foil and sprayed with cooking spray. I actually do this often when baking and highly suggest. It works great for clean-up. The recipe did not say how much cheese to put inside versus on top. So, I mixed 1 cup with the filling and a generous 1/2 a cup on top. I used shredded pepper jack cheese to add more flavor. For the chicken I just boiled 3 large chicken breast, let them cool, and shredded them. I also used lite soup and sour cream, as it was what I had, and it did not seem to be a problem. The cook time was perfect on this. ty

I used shredded boneless chicken thighs and medium verde salsa. It is very good and I will make it again. It is just creamy enough, without being soggy. A  very successful balance of moisture.
Since I am not feeding any children, or picky eaters, I would like a bit more kick next time. I’ll either bump the salsa up to hot salsa, or add some minced jalapeño, or otherwise spice up the filling.
I served refried beans on the side.

I must admit I didn't have cilantro on hand, and I'm sure this would be much better with that. My family just didn't care for the soup, as it made them very rich. We would prefer the recipe without the soup and maybe some refried beans instead.

I liked the filling of the enchilada, very creamy and cheese. I used corn tortillas to make it more Mexican  and used green salsa. The tortillas got a little soggy but on the whole the dish was very tasty and enjoyable.

This was easy and delicious! Husband LOVED it and wished he had room to eat two.  Was skeptical about soup in it but it made for a creamy smooth filling. Cilantro is a must though. Slid easily out of my pan with the heavy duty foil I had sprayed. I definitely will be making again. Thanks Reynolds!
