I grew up and lived in Cyprus and Greece for almost 10 years.  The one thing that I missed the most is of course, tyropita.  So, I searched high and low for a great recipe that would taste authentic and this is it!  However, I made some few additions :
- I skipped out on the mint and opted for a mix of herbs instead.  A friend got me a bag of salad herbs straight from Crete ( mix of dried mint, thyme and oregano ).  I added this to the cheese mixture and it was amazing.
- I also added the nutmeg which gave it that authentic Greek cuisine flavour.
Other than that, the recipe is perfect and now it's become one of my favourite things to make in the kitchen!  I made a whole batch and stored them in the freezer...they were gone within 2 days between my boyfriend and I!

I made these as appetizers. Instead of butter, I sprayed between layers of philo with butter spray. I cut them into squares and pushed them into a mini muffin pan. I scooped the filling into each "cup" and baked them. They were a hit. Except for presentation, I didn't change a thing. These are delicious.

My first experiment with puff pastry!  And it turned out great.  We really enjoyed this dish.  I substituted eggs for egg beaters, used reduced fat feta and fat free cottage cheese as well as "I can't believe it's not butter" spray.  It was DELICIOUS!  Next time I'm thinking I may reduce the cottage and feta cheese a little and throw in some spinach and tomatoes.  Very yummy... I'm posting a pic of it right out of the oven.

My boyfriend loves this dish!  It is one of his favorites.  I have also made it low-fat using f/f cottage and feta cheese as well as spray butter.  It still tasted great.  Very rich and heavy, so serve it with some light veggies or a salad.

This is an excellent recipe.  I added thyme, oregano, and nutmeg (didn't have any mint) as one reviewer suggested.  I also used low-fat cottage cheese and cooking spray, as another reviewer mentioned.  It turned out delicious, and even my fiance who says he hates both cottage cheese and feta loved it!  I will certainly be making this one again.

This recipe reminds me of a dish my dad used to make, but he used ricotta and feta cheeses, no cottage cheese. Normally he would fold the phyllo into triangles and fill them with the egg and cheese mixture, but sometimes he would cook it in a pan, like a lasagna.

I only used 1/2 cup butter and these got too greasey and not flaky at all.  I thought the filling had too much egg and not enough cheese even though I used 10 oz of feta cheese.  I also used my mixer on low to mix everything and I wonder if that put too much air into the filling.  Next time I plan on using one less egg, more feta and I will dab the butter around like another person said.  My husband loves Tiropitas so much I really want to perfect this recipe.

I've never had these before, but I found them a little bland. I added a package of frozen spinach (thawed and drained) and some chopped up sundried tomatoes and it turned out a little bit more for my liking.

I made these for a potluck at work and they were gone in 30 minutes! Instead of making it in the 9X13 dish I folded them into triangles so that everyone would have a chance to try some. These freeze really well also.

I used garlic and herb feta cheese and it added some great flavor.  I also used olive oil instead of butter.  I will be making this again but next time I will use less egg and more feta cheese.  Overall a great recipe, thanks!

This was just ok. It tasted fine, maybe could have used a bit of spice in the cheese/egg mixture. I probably won't make it again, mostly because my husband and I were both still hungry after having second and third helpings of this.

My 15 year old made this for the family and it was SO delicious and easy to make!  Made this recipe a second time only this time took three (may try 2 next time) Phyllo sheets, individually brush them with butter, lay them on top of each other, cut them in half lengthwise, dabbed spoonful of mixture on one end and folded it up like a triangular (paper) football.  Wet the end piece tab so it will stick lay the triangle with tab down.  Continued until all Phyllo and mixture are used.  Bake.  EXCELLENT single servings and BEAUTIFUL too.

This was tasty.  It tastes similar to what you might think a breakfast casserole (of the egg/cheese variety), but the feta and cottage cheese give it a little something different.

I thought it was a bit bland so added a touch of nutmeg and it punched it up nicely.

I've made this twice for parties and both times it was a hit.  To save time I made it once with frozen puff pastry instead of Phyllo and butter. I put the puff pastry in the bottom and it puffed around the filling.  It wasn't greasy like the Phyllo.   I also added chopped fresh herbs (oregano and thyme). Cut into squares it makes a great appetizer.

I replace the cottage cheese with a mixture of ricotta and cream cheese. This is amazing and worth the work.
