Mmm! This recipe is very good, but I wouldn't reccomend trying to make bars of it as they come out very crumbly!

Absolutely FABULOUS!!  And, incredibly easy too.  I substituted vegetable oil for the butter and used pecans in place of the peanuts and the granola was fantastic!  Definitely a new favorite recipe.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with different dried fruits and nuts for a change in flavor.  WONDERFUL!!!

This recipe did not turn out well at all. I tried it twice and the granola burned or was not sweet enough.

Pretty good. I used a mix of honey and maple syrup. And added flax seeds and sunflower seeds.

Be sure to use a thick-bottomed pan. Granola burns easily. It was a bit sweet for me. I'll use less honey next time.
