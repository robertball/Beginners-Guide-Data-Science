I used spiralized zucchini, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The shrimp had great flavor.  I sprinkled it with Parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make again!

The lemony shrimp were perfect! I didn’t get broccoli so I used 2 large zucchini slices and it was also surprisingly good. I treated it like it was broccoli in this recipe. I don’t really know much about cooking, so I’m glad it worked. They were about to go bad in my fridge.
Oh... I also didn’t have white wine or red pepper flakes.

Made the shrimp & sauce exactly as written.  Excellent!   Then, made two options for the 'pasta' and served both to my family with the same shrimp sauce on the same night.   One pasta was Ronzoni's Garden Delight veggie spaghetti and the other was Zucchini noodles.   Husband and teenage son really liked both which surprised me.  While they preferred the Ronzoni, they both ate up their serving of the zucchini noodles.   This is a healthy, delicious dinner!

My husband liked this. I was not able to make the broccoli noodles with my hand held noodle maker so I sliced them in my food processor. I added some home made shrimp stock & some fresh spinach. I topped it off with a diced roma tomato at the end to add some color.

Excellent. Used more garlic but it was unnecessary according to my wife. I loved it.

Broccoli didn't really blend with the shrimp and/or sauce. Way too crunchy to simulate pasta. Broccoli had virtually no flavor of its own. Probably will not repeat. The one redeeming feature was the low carb count for this diabetic.

Had trouble getting thick broccoli stalks to make the spaghetti. So, I substituted “SuperGreens” rotini. It worked great!

This was very quick, easy and tasty.  Mine was not Keto because I used some fresh pasta instead of broccoli noodles but in everything else I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this again and the only change I would make is a little less crushed red pepper to suit my tolerance for heat.

Lots of intense flavors along with the succulent shrimp (I used 16-20's) just because I love them.  It's an excellent recipe and I thank you.  KB

This was delicious!!  A powerhouse of flavor!! Made it exactly as written, but did not add parmesan or additional basil at serving, don't think it needs anything else.  Next time I will double up on the broccoli.  Didn't have enough stems so  spiraled some zucchini and cooked in the remaining sauce and was just as good.

I used zucchini noodles and it was absolutely delish.  Sprinkled fresh parsley onthe shrimp!
