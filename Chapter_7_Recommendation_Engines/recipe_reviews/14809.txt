This is one of our favorites!  I have found through trial and error, it is better baked in the oven rather than the slow cooker.  Oven cooking gives it more of a "candied" apperarance, whereas the crock-pot version is more watery.  If you want to try it the oven way, just well-grease a 13 X 9 dish and bake at 350 for 90 minutes, stirring after every 30 minutes (or until it's as done as your family likes it. My husband prefers it a little dark.)  Don't be afraid to try this recipe; it's really easy and nearly everyone who tastes it, just loves it!   Good Luck!

The first time I tried this recipe, I enjoyed it, but it was a little too sweet for my taste, and not spicy enough.  When I made it again last night, I cut the brown sugar down by at least half, increased the horseradish by 75% or so, and added Dijon mustard, barbecue sauce, Worchestire sauce, and a taste of tabasco sauce.  Mmmmmm, yummy!  It's delicious!  My coworkers all want the recipe.  I think another key is to make sure your kielbasa slices are nice and thin.  I didn't enjoy it as much the first time I made it when I sliced the sausage too thickly.

Wow, was this YUMMY! Being a Polish girl, I never had kielbasa this way! lol  I read the reviews and grilled my kielbasa lightly on the BBQ so that fat would not drip into the crockpot.  (I love my kielbasa BBQ'd).  Then to my dismay, I discovered that my husband used the last of our horseradish!  I didn't want to substitute but I had to use horshradish sauce. Luckily, some other reviewers had done the same and said it turned out great.  Well, I have to agree.  The sauce was NOT liquidly or runny from too much fat...the horseradish sauce still gave it a nice zing without too much heat (even my six year old son loved it).  Just a delicious way to prepare kielbasa.  We always grill kielbasa for appetitizers at parties and I was thinking of even making the sauce and serving it on the side for dipping.  The combination of the smoked, garlicky kielbasa and the sweet/tangy sauce is sooooooooooooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very easy - my husband loved it.  I read all the previous reviews and decided to make the following adjustments - used only 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, sprinkle of dried mustard, a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce, and as directed 1/4 cup of horseradish.  Yes, you must slice the sausage very thin for the best results.  I cooked on low for about 2 1/2 hours and it was wonderful.  If I took this recipe to a pitch-in I would at least double it and probably triple it.

Made this with Boar's Head Horseradish Sauce instead of plain horseradish because I didn't have have any and halved the sugar.  It was sweet enough.  Also, I did it on the stove top and it turned out fine.  This is also a great sauce to use for those little cocktail weiners you heat in a chafing dish.

Awesome appetizer! I really thought it might have too much horse radish in it, but that was not the case at all. We served this for the Super Bowl and just loved it. I will definitely make it again.

This was good after 2 hours, one hour on high and one on low. A previous reviewer said they left it on low for 6 hours and it was great. I left it in for about 6 hours and it was so gross. The crockpot was filled with grease and the kielbasa was way overcooked. I should have turned it off after 2 hours and then reheated when I was ready to serve. The sauce has a very interesting flavor but it never got thick.

Yum! Tweaked a little based on other reviews...1/2 cup brown sugar (plenty!), 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, 1/4 cup horseradish sauce. After thinly slicing, browned the kielbasa in a large skillet and then drained it. Poured the sauce ingredients into the warm skillet, mixed together and then returned the kielbasa. Let it simmer for 1/2 hour or so. Came out great! Thanks for the recipe...will definitely make it again!

I made this last night for a gathering.  I'll admit that the ingredients scared me a little at first (and before baking it tasted quite spicy!) but it mellowed quite nicely when it was cooked.  I chose to bake this first for about an hour, stirring every 20 minutes, and then transferred to a Crockpot.  I also added in about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and a few splashes of Worstershire.  The end result was fabulous and SO EASY!  Happy to add this to my arsenal of potluck recipes!

I have made a similar recipe for years with great success.  It uses just the kielbasa and brown sugar.  i bake it in the oven, keep stirring and it comes out syrupy and fabulous.  Have been doing this for 20 years, everyone loves it.  i am interested to use horseradish in tis recipe and will try it next time.  Sounds like it would add a kick!  One suggestion to those of you who would like to get some of the fat out of the kielbasa.  After you slice it up, boil it in 7-up.  It sweetens it up a bit and really draws the fat out of the sausage so when you are baking it with the brown sugar it comes out leaner (who needs that extra fat anyway)  I have boiled it in plain water too, and that works also.  Just boil it for 5 min and then drain and prepare as the recipe dictates.  Enjoy

This is a very tasty snack. I took it to a football party and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe to a T. However I did take the advice of others and cooked them in a cake pan at 350 degrees for 90 minutes stirring every 30 minutes. Caramelized really well. Came home and am currently try'n the slow cooker to see the difference. Well just finished. Must say the cake pan is better. It caramelized with a beautiful golden crispness. Will make again in cake pan only. Great recipe a must try. Also now that I have made 4 times I added a heaping spoonful chili garlic sauce found in most Asian stores.

wonderful = I also made changes -I seared the meat first then -  I used only one lb. Kielbasa, !/2 c. brown sugar, 2/3 c. horseradish, 1/2 tsp. dried mustard, 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, and a couple sprinkles of Worchiester sauce.  AND I cooked it on top of the stove. It's yummy - SERVE w/RICE

These were so easy and taste really good. Even my kids liked them! Do not leave out the horseradish, that is what makes this dish. The sauce is just fine as directed.

Fantastic recipe.  Our crockpot is pretty big so the sauce wasn't covering all of the sausage.  We threw in some beer (micro) and let it simmer for a few hours.  Delish!

I've made these both in the crock pot & the oven. The oven method makes a crunchier coating.  However, both ways were enjoyed by all.  Nothing left, both times.

Really good. Served as a meal, fixed in the oven like one of the other reviews suggested and added some yellow, orange and red peppers. Served over rice. The whole family liked it.

I made this for a potluck and was well received.

I also make it as BBQ'd Kielbasa.

2 pounds of Kielbasa

Enough of your favorite BBQ sauce to cover. (I use Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar)

An 8 oz can of chunk pineapple with juice.

About 1/4 cup of red wine to rinse out the bottle.

Slow cook as in the origional recipe.

I also preheat the slow cooker before I start.

FABULOUS. As with most reviewers, I cut the sugar - 1/4 cup was plenty. I also added worchestershire sauce and dried mustard and used 1/2 BBQ sauce.

The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce and added a drained and rinsed can of pinto beans - WOW!

This was wonderful! I was a little skeptical about how the horseradish would blend with the ketchup and sugar, but it was surprisingly delicious! Like others before, I heated the kielbasa in a skillet first to drain some of the fat, and then mixed all ingredients together in a separate dish, and baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, stirring after 20 minutes, then again at the end. I also let it sit 5 minutes once out of the oven, to allow the sauce to thicken a little and served over white rice. My family loved this, and I can't wait to experiment with this sauce on BBQ chicken! Yum!

What is it about precooked linked meat that brings such happiness and joy to the avid pot-lucker? My compatriots found this recipe to be a lovely balance of sweet and savory. I do have to admit, I added a dash of worcestershire and a smidge of barbeque sauce to liven it up a bit. Sassy recipe, Nancy, very sassy.

This was great!  I brought it to a party and non was left at the end.  Very kid friendly.  One 6 year old practicly wore a path in the carpet getting these.  I put these in the crockpot for about 4-5 hours on low and they turned out perfect.

This is my go to recipe for graduation parties and family reunions.  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  The only thing I do different is I boil the kielbasa for about 5 minutes in a pot of water before putting in the crockpot.

Wow - this is amazing!! The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I made this to be a dinner meal and it really isn't something you make for dinner. If I had read the reviews first I would have realized it's more for a pot luck. But it is still very tasty and I usually like my kielbasa just fried...and burnt! But I served this with Hawaiian rolls and peas and it was a decent dinner.

I thought this sounded delicious, but I guess I just don't like my food this sweet.  I made it as directed, but only my husband liked it.  My two kids and I would have rather had plain kielbasa.

Made these for a Superbowl party.  I was afraid they would be too much like Little Smokies but I was so wrong.  These were raved about.  I was almost embarassed to tell people how easy they were but everyone was asking!  I did cut back on the brown sugar and also baked in the over first before putting them into the crockpot as per many reviewers advice. Thank you for a recipe that was a fantastic crowd pleaser!!

This was so good! I have become bored of the same old Kielbasa recipes and needed something different. This definitely hit the spot and everyone loved it. It actually kind of tasted like a sauce that Hickory Farms used to make and it was my husbands favorite, so finding this recipe was great. Will definitely make again especially as a "football food".

I've made this several times now and far prefer it made in the oven instead of the crock pot.  The sauce thickens better in the oven and is less runny.  I always add more horseradish when it's nearly done since baking takes some of the heat out of the horseradish.  We all love this recipe and I wouldn't even think of using less brown sugar.  That makes the recipe what it is.

This was a little sweet for us and the ketchup just seemed to not fit the flavor. This was okay but I won't be making it again.

My husband normally hates kielbasa, but he LOVED this!  I do have to mention I made some changes: I used 1 pound turkey kielbasa, cut the sugar way down to 1/4 cup at most, and added worcestershire & a little onion salt.  My husband was glad it wasn't spicy - the horseradish does not stand out, but it subtly flavors.  I cooked it for about 6 hours on low in my slow cooker, and the kielbasa came out perfectly cooked, and the sauce was thick enough for us.  I will say that the way I made it you wouldn't call it "candied" since I cut down so much on the sugar, so it came out differently than the original recipe intends, but much better for those who aren't big on sweet!

1 Pack of Kielbasa, 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup horseradish cream, couple splashes of tabasco and a teaspoon of cayenne red pepper. Mix all in a baking pan uncovered. Pop in the oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Stir 3-4 times during cooking. It will caramelized & brown once done cooking. 

First time cooking kielbasa like this and was a great change. It's so tasty and has the right amount of sweetness. Do not put in more than 1/2 or 1 cup of sugar, unless you like it very sweet. Can't wait to bring this as a potluck or appetizer dish. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

The sauce would not "candy" in the crockpot, so I took other suggestions and finished it in the oven.  My husband thought it needed more horseradish.

This is sooooooooooo good!  I used a 1 1/2-qt crock pot with 1 lb. turkey hot dogs (all I had).  I dislike turkey hot dogs but this recipe made them so yummy!  I bought kielbasa to make this for Super Bowl today.

The flavor of this was really good but way too greasy in the crock pot.  It never got to the 'candied' stage.  Next time I will take other reviewers' advice and BBQ the meat first or bake it in the oven.  That would bring it up to five stars.  Love the sweet and spicy combo!

delicious!!  Cooked in the oven in a 9x13 pan.  I cooked for 90 min stirring after 30 min and every 30 min thereafter.  Next time I will use a smaller dish as these turned out very delicious but a tad chewy on the ones not soaked in sauce.  Added a little bit of bbq sauce, a splash of hot sauce and a bit mroe saurkraut.

This is so easy and so tasty, anyone can make it.  I hate horseradish, and I will eat this.  As many have said, this dish was the first one gone on the table.  Which is true.  For those that think this is a mediocre dish and will not make it agian...perhaps you should stick to your meat and cheese trays.

People liked this dish at last night's Halloween party.  I followed other reviewer's advice and doubled the sauce.  However, since I served it as a stand-alone appetizer(not over rice), I had too MUCH sauce.  Sometimes, it's best to leave things just the way they were supposed to be.

This was so yummy! I made it last night for dinner and everyone loved it. Both hubby and I took the leftovers for lunch. The only thing I changed was that....I doubled the sauce and so glad that I did. I served it over rice and with the extra sauce....it was perfect! Thank you for another winning recipe.

My entire famiy enjoyed this.  Great super bowl party food.  Even the kids enjoyed it. You don't need a slow cooker.  I did this on the stove cooking slowly for about an hour and a half and it was perfect.  I thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  GREAT

This is fantastic. I used turkey kielbasa and made it on the stovetop in a pan so that I could reduce the sauce. It was very watery at first, but 30 minutes of careful simmering fixed it down into a deep dark beautiful homemade barbecue-sauce coating my kielbasa. Served on slider buns with fresh pineapple and spinach salad. Thanks for sharing!

i would give this 5 stars except for 1 tweak: definitely start w/ half the brown sugar and add more to taste.  it's very sweet.  i also used the skillet method to render some of the fat.  this makes a great game day recipe.  so simple and easy.

My boyfriend loved it but it was a little too sweet for me.  I checked some of the ratings and reviews of this recipe and took the advice to add mustard and extra horseradish at the end.  I felt like this only added to the sweetness.  I'm still glad I tried it, as dinner was over an hour ago and my boyfriend is STILL talking about it.  LOL

Awesome taste!  Needs a little more kick though like others have suggested.  Sear/brown the sausage in a skillet will also "toughen" up the meat to make it more chewyand presentable.

Easy and delicious!  I prepped it yesterday and slow cooked it today.  I used turkey kielbasa, and it turned out great.  Probably the best eaten thing on my buffet today.

I thought these sounded good, but I had no idea they would turn out so amazing! I didn't have ketchup so I used tomato soup, I also baked at 350 for about an hour(per another reviewers suggestion) These will be a new staple for football Sunday's and family events! Thanks for a great recipe!

I love Kielbasa but this was not for me. It was too sweet for my pallet. Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious.  I read some of the reviews and cooked mine in the oven.  It was a hit.  I served it with Southern Fried Cabbage from this site and Sour Cream Cucumber Salad.  Next time, I will double the horseradish and add more Louisiana Hot Sauce to give it some more kick.  Excellent for sandwiches and it's better the next day.

Loved this recipe.  I did bake this in the oven at 350 uncovered for 45 minutes.  Also added a little barbecue sauce, didn't have horseradish so used a package of Horsey sauce.  Was wonderful, easy and will make this again.

This was a hit at a party the other nite.  Everyone loved  it and I love easy recipes!  Based on other reviewers I cut down on the brown sugar but then I could only smell horseradish.  This scared me a bit so I ended up adding more brown sugar and wished I hadn't; it was a bit sweet.  Next time I won't be afraid to let the horseradish prevail.  Thanks from another Nancy.

I have made this so many times I've lost count! It is practically demanded for holidays, showers and whenever the family is getting together. I bake mine in the oven instead of the crockpot, you get a better "candied" meat that way. And I make it in such large quanities I started using the big foil roasting pans so clean up is a breeze!

I serve this dish at a party last night and everyone loved them.  The horseradish gives the kielbasa a nice kick.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  Will definitely go in my favorites....

I modified this recipe quite a bit. I layered potatoes & onions in a crockpot. Then I put the sliced kielbasa in, poured the horseradish/br.sugar/ketchup sauce over top & let it cook on low for several hours. The sauce is pretty thin after that but it is very tasty and incredibly easy to make. Thanks for the idea!

I enjoyed this kielbasa.  I used one pound of kielbasa, changing the recipe to 1 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup horseradish.  I thought the horseradish mellowed the sweetness and although I love horseradish, I am glad the taste wasn't like cocktail sauce.  Using the original recipe I would've hated it as it would be too sweet for me.  I served mine with leftover mac and cheese and cooked on the stovetop for an hour.

Yuck!  The mess in my crock pot was awful.  It was a greasy mess.  I might try this again but I will use turkey sausage.  I will cook it on the stove top instead of the crockpot.
   I must admit that the sauce was tasty.  I don't like the taste of horseradish and I was worried about the recipe.  I was suprised to find that the flavor melded well and was not overpowering as horseradish usually is.

Outstanding party dish!  I've doubled the recipe every time since the first time.  With my Polish background, I eat kielbasa often, but most people rarely think about it.  So at parties, this is something different and very tasty...I've found it to be a favorite of ALL ages...

This was so good! I read that some people thought it could use more horseradish, but rather than doing that, I used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup of chili sauce.  Mine didn't really thicken, but it was still wonderful.  I served it with basmati rice, and it was such a delicious dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Nancy!

This was really delicious, but too I decided to cut the sugar out, use grape jelly instead of the sugar, and substituted Heinz A1 Sauce for tartness.  It was even better!

These little things were great!!  I added more horseradish sauce for a bit more kick!  I put them in the slow cooker and they cooked for hours while other appetizers were cooking and they turned our perfect!  Extremely tender and almost carmalized!  Will definitely bring these out for a get-together!

I was looking for something different to do with kielbasa the night I tried this and it was great.  I added sauerkraut, onion and potato to make it more a dinner thing.  My husband loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Brought this to a party and people raved about it. I personally was looking for more of a "sweet and sour" kilbasa rexipe. This was good though on the sweeter side.

This is the best recipe I've tried from your site.  A real winner with my kids, too.  I often just heat it up in a saucepan if I don't want to mess with the crock pot.  Serve for a simple dinner with home-made hashbrowns.  Excellent!

Absolutely fantastic.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Made this for dinner served with mashed potatoes and green beans but will also serve at an upcoming party as an hors' de oeuvre.  I think you could also use little smokies.  The sauce would be good on a variety of other meats or as a basting sauce.

I took this to an office party and it disappeared.  I found this recipe after looking for something easy because I had a class the night before the party.  My version for a double batch:  1/2 c. everything (less sugar than suggested) and two 1 lb. packages (sliced thin on the diagonal) of kielbasa.  Baked in the oven, as others suggested, for 90 minutes, stirring every 30 minutes.  Super easy, super tasty, and not too expensive for a group.  This will go into regular rotation.  THANK YOU for sharing!

I found this last minute (not enough time for the crockpot) and decided to use it as a marinade for our grilled kielbasa.  It was amazing.  I used 2 lbs. of kielbasa and cut the sauce ingredients in half, since we were just basting it.  Served it over rice with grilled veggies and pineapple.  It is our new favorite!

Made this recipe for a shower and it was fantastic.  I followed other suggestions by slicing the kielbasa thin, then baking them in the oven at 375 for about 45 minutes.  I then put them in the crock pot.  The oven did carmelize them and also I was able to drain the fat off the kielbasa.  The horseradish was a must as it really added to the flavor.  This one is a keeper.

I get many requests for this party favorite but don't make in with slow cooker! Use 9x13 pan, bake at 350 for 1 & 1/2 hrs stirring every 30 min to baste/glaze. No need to adjust ingredients. This looks good & is delicous. Your guests will rave & be prepared to give out the recipe many times

The only thing I do differently is sear the kielbasa first and I just let the ketchup, horseradish and brown sugar simmer.  I do not make this in the slow cooker.  I like the whole carmelization thing when I cook it on the stove top.

This was a tasty, simple solution for dinner on an extremely hot Sunday. I served it with garlic and butter egg noodles. Thumbs up from all.

I have a similar recipe that also adds a 1lb bag of sauerkraut.  My recipe calls for the mixture to be cooked/sauteed in a pan for 20 minutes rather than in a crock pot.  My family liked it fine but it definitely was VERY sweet.  Reduce the brown sugar some.  Enjoy!

OK, I didn't feel the sweetness added to the flavor of the meat. It was good, but I don't think I'll make it again,

We loved this. I did bake mine in the oven on 300 instead of the crockpot. Covered with foil and removed the last 20 minutes. It was really delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! So simple and loved by all. Great for a man-centric event, like a football game.  I made these ahead of time and rewarmed the next day for a tailgate party. Will make again.

My family loves this dish and has requested it several times. I've used the slow cooker each time so far but think I may try the oven next time as some other users have suggested to see what the difference is. I've also tried changing up the ingredients each subsequent time as some users suggested but think we like it best the original way. The sweetness with a kick is a perfect pairing for sauteed and caramelized angel hair pasta with lots of Mizithra cheese grated on top and a salad filled with all kinds of fruit and veggie goodness.

I made mine in a 9x14" pan in the oven and it still came out great! Just make sure you mix up the sauce well so it coats everything evenly. I found I needed more ketchup to get everything covered. Maybe 3/4 cup.

Made this for a family get-together at the house and it was delicious! I do agree with some of the other reviews about it being a bit too sweet, but my husband loved it as is so it's just a matter of taste. I think next time I will add extra horseradish sauce to spice it up a bit.

I added saurkraut and didnt enjoy the flavor. I feel like it would have been so much better without the kraut. Next time i will make it minus kraut and hopefully rate it 5 stars.

Made this for a house-warming party.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  My only suggestion is that it is more of a "good sauce" than something "candied," so I will make it will less sugar next time.  I guess if you like the candied style, more sugar would probably be a good idea.   I made it on the stove top (for time's sake) then put it in the crock pot for the party.  2 people asked me for the recipe.  Thanks!

this was very good.  I did bake the dish as opposed to putting it in the slow cooker and I will definitely make it again.  Next time, I will cut the kielbasa into chunks instead of slices though...my slices got pretty dried out.

I hate when people change all sorts of things about a recipe and then say that it was just OK.  Well, I will admit, I changed 1/2 of the ingredients for this recipe, but I thought my creation was excellent!!  First, I never have ketchup on hand.  I don't like it, I prefer barbeque sauce and will substitute barbeque sauce for ketchup in everything.  Next, I didn't have horseradish.  And since I was making it Sunday morning for a pot luck, I really didn't have any choice but to substitute something for it.  I used Tastefully Simple's Sweet and Sassy Mustard Sauce.  Everyone loved this dish.  I doubled it and could have probably quadrupled it and still not had enough!!

This was unbelievably good, I may never have kielbasa another way again!  I used turkey kielbasa and cut the brown sugar in half, added a splash of worcestershire sauce, and added a little extra horseradish because I love it.  It was sweet and not at all spicy.  My one-year old loved it!

I cut the sugar back to maybe half a cup.  Also diced a small onion and cooked the kielbasa and onion first, then added the rest along with a little water and just cooked on the stovetop (no slow cooker).  Served with rice and broccoli, this was REALLY good.

This was really good, but since I sliced the kielbasa pretty thin, I cooked the sauce for the 45 min without the sausage, then added the sausage and cooked 15 minutes longer, and it was perfect.  I think the sausage would have been over-cooked the way it is written in this recipe, so I only gave it 4 stars

Yummy & easy!  I used turkey kielbasa to cut back on the fat; used a bit less sugar and 3 T. of creamy horseradish because that's what I had on hand (could handle more though). Served with plain ol' white rice, which was great with the sweet sauce poured over. This one will go into regular dinner rotation.

These got scarfed down - super delicious.  Many have asked for the recipe.  I, too, fried the kielbasa before hand and drained off the grease.  I doubled the sauce recipe, also.  Be careful not to over cook these or they turn into tiny hockey pucks.

I cooked my kielbasa on the stove first as well, I think that was a great suggestion seeing how much grease that came off. I also moved them from the stove to a plate lined with paper towels and gave them a good pat down. My crock pot never did come to a boil so I ended up cooking it on high for about 1/2 hours and then left all low till it was gone which wasn't long! I have a very picky boyfriend and he said "How did you make this? This is good". Go for it!

I made this for a potluck and it was a big hit!  As suggested by other reviewers, I cooked the kielbasa before adding it to the crockpot to cut down on the oil.  I also added a 1/4 cup of yellow mustard for some extra tang.  I'll be making this again for sure!

Made this for super bowl I just made on top of stove in saucepan on low. I only used 1 lb of meat and seemed sauce was the right amount. I would double the sauce if I used 2 lbs of meat as recipe calls for.  The men seemed to really love this one.

Wow, I was surprised how much the whole family loved this one! Personally, I thought it tasted better the longer I cooked it... just kept it on low the whole day in the crock pot. I used turkey kielbasa and increased the sauce ingredients by 1/2. Will definitely make this for our annual Super Bowl party.

This makes a wonderful appetizer! Really delicious. The sauce was plenty enough to coat 3 lbs of kielbasa. I cooked entirely on the stove in a big pot. Once the mixture bubbled, I cooked 1/2 hour covered, then cooked uncovered until the sauce cooked down and made a thick, sticky coating on the kielbasi. My guests enjoyed this.

Here again I managed to slip horseradish by my husband!  We both loved it, I especially liked the easiness of it.  I used "little smokies" instead of the kielbasa.

These were good.  This didn't thicken up very well for me though.  I think I would also put more horseradish in next time. I will make these again with a few "tweeks".

I made this on the stove in a skillet instead of in a slow cooker.  I just combined all the ingredients and let it simmer for a few hours.  Everyone at my party loved it.  It was very easy to prepare, too.

Big hit at Christmas, snacking while preparing the big meal. We are always looking for party dishes that can be kept at a food safe temperature in the crockpot. We served it with pita chips and ghost pepper cheese sauce to spice it up more  for the thrill seekers. My dad can't handle much spice and really liked it (without the additional cheese sauce). We also added pineapple chunks as it shows in the picture.

Just finished making this for the superbowl tonight.  I thought it was going to be too sweet but I used the whole cup of brown sugar anyway.  Boy is it delicious!  The horseradish balances it out perfectly and my husband gave it the thumbs up approval!  Added it to my recipe box, and will definitely make this again.  It was so easy to prepare!  Oh - and I used ground horseradish instead of horseradish sauce.  Delicious!!

I added one 12 oz. bottle of cocktail sauce to the mix, and loosely packed the brown sugar. Slow cooked on low heat for 8 hours. During the last 5 minutes I added one can of chunked pineapple. This recipe is great! Especially for sporting events or just a weekend around the house with some friends and family watching football, be sure to double the recipe though cause it won't last.

I'm not a fan of kielbasa, however this was pretty good. The horseradish saved this from being cloyingly sweet. I think you could easily make this in a saucepan on the stove.

This was gone in a very short period of time! My company loved it. I only got one piece out of 2 lbs of kielbasa! I did use turkey kielbasa and decreased the brown sugar to 1/2c which was plenty sweet. I also used a creamed horseradish that was a bit milder and only used 2 tblspns of that instead of 4. Nice flavors! Easy appy. Thanks!

this recipe has to much fat left after this cooking method. I cook Kielbasi in a pressure cooker first for 15 minutes. The greese that pours out is unbelievable and the consistency of the  meat remains tender and delicious. Add all ingredients in a baking dish and heat in the oven till bubbly. So much better for you.

This was a huge hit at my Christmas party this past weekend! Everyone commented on how delicious it was and several people asked for the recipe.  I did cut back on the brown sugar as some reviewers suggested (I used 1 1/2 cups for a double batch) and baked in the oven for about 90 minutes at 350 so it would carmelize.

Great recipe!  Added a bit of Teriyaki marinade and replaced part of the horseradish with jalapenos and the liquid from the jalapenos.  Everyone LOVED them!

Served this at my daughter's luau graduation party. My husband grilled some kielbasa because he didn't think he would like it this way. He liked this one better! It was a hit. I did put in the oven for about 30 minutes before it went in the slow cooker but otherwise followed the directions. Thanks!

I've made this twice. I bake it in the oven so it gets sticky. The first time I made it was for my daughter's slumber party. I was afraid they wouldn't like the horseradish so I cut back on the amount. Couldn't taste it at all! It disappeared in no time flat! The next time I put the given amount and it was better - but I think I'm going to add even more. Making it tomorrow for a New Year's Eve party!

I made this for a church pot luck. I followed the advice of a few and baked mine to get them nice, dark and carmelized.  Then I refrigerated overnite and just microwaved them in the morning for the potluck.    I thought this dish tasted very good, almost too rich but very good.  Every bite got eaten and I was asked for the recipe by a couple of people.  I did what some also suggested and cut the sausage up into small slices.  I think next time I wold go with bigger chunks, the smaller slices get alot of the sauce on a small bit and I think that may be the only problem I had, larger chunks would give a lower sauce:sausage ratio.  I will make this again.

I have made this recipe a lot of times but I just use the brown sugar and ketchup. Next time I will try adding horseradish to it. This is one of my daughters favorite recipes. She loves to have macaroni and cheese with this. I also boil the kielbasa first before I put it in the crockpot that will cut down on the grease.

So easy and delicious.  However, I did cook in the oven per Minsterswife's suggestions.  The sausage really carmelized nicely in the sugar sauce.  I'd use more horseradish or add some hot sauce next time.  This dish screams for spiciness.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I really liked these.  I baked them in the oven instead of using the slow cooker, per other reviewers' suggestions.  I also left out the horseradish, since neither of us are big fans of it.  I may try using a little bit of cocktail sauce (the kind you'd serve with shrimp) in place of some of the ketchup next time, to give it a little bit of a kick without the overpowering horseradish taste.

This is great!  I had read a lot of the reviews and noticed people whining about how sweet it was.........hello, Candied means sweet!  I can't wait to make this again and try some variations like also adding some Worcestershire Sauce and also try making this w/smoked sausage.

This does come out greasy and watery in the slow cooker, but it actually works okay--it didn't really need much of a sauce, in my opinion, just the flavor.  I cooked on low for about 4-5 hours and it was perfect.  I served over quinoa, which bf had a fit about--he doesn't like it, but he didn't tell me that when we had it before.  Silly guy.  Anyway, it went well with the quinoa, I thought.  I cut the sugar in half and wouldn't have liked any more.  This was good for tonight when I had other things to do and didn't have much time for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed it up a little bit because my husband doesn't care for horseradish, so I had to trick him.  Instead of horseradish, I added Jack Daniels Horseradish mustard, cut the brown sugar in half and the used half barbecue and half catsup (because I ran out of catsup) and about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I baked it at 350 for 1 hour, stirring it half way through and it turned out wonderfully delicious!

Delicious and easy. I made this or a potluck and everybody liked it. I added some chipolte tabasco for extra spice and flavor (was not too spicy). I agree - make sure you slice the kielbasa thin (1/8-1/4 inch).

Everyone loved these. I used little smokies. I only used about 3/4 C brown sugar and that was plenty and added a little more horseradish.  I baked them and they did get a little greasy but tasted wonderful.  Great appetizer.

I tried this for a work party.  Most of my team is men and I was debating going through the work of homemade meatballs.  They sucked it down.  Best part?  It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO easy--especially compared to the mess and effort of homemade meatballs.

I LOVE THIS!! I didnt measure anything, just kept tasting it. Browned my kielbasa and drained the grease,  I added some sweet baby rays barbecue sauce (makes any recipe better), a splash of worstechier, and some cracked red pepper.  Next time I have a party to go to I will use this sauce with lil smokies.  THANK YOU!!

I made this for an office party.  It was a little too sweet for me, but, most people seemed to enjoy it.  I did make it in the slow cooker, and would agree with other posters that I think it would be better in the oven.  It didn't develop a good glaze and was much more watery.  The meat also started "breaking down" as it cooked.  I would try this again in the oven, but I would cut down on the sugar.

Absolute perfection! One of the most delicious recipes I have tried in a while. I cooked this on the stove and it had a nice thick consistancy. The measurements were just perfect. This will be a show-off party dish for sure! Thanks so much!

I was worried about the horseradish, I love it but my husband is not a fan.  It truly does blend in, just kind of gives it some heat which works with sweet.  I think this would work well as an appetizer.

Yes, a tad sweet...but then, it is called "candied" kielbasa, after all!!  As a result of this recipe, my youngest son says "kielbasa" as if it's a declaration of victory! We all enjoyed it, and will make it again as is, but may also try it with a little less brown sugar at some point, too.

We made this for last years 4th of July barbecue. We made a double batch. We brought it to the picnic and everyone that saw and tasted it kept taking a sample. So much so that there was none left for the dinner. This year We're making a quadruple batch. One to pick on and one for the dinner. This dish will be a hit at any barbecue. Something so simple can make you so smart...

I followed some advice and made it in the oven.  It was very good and a different way to make kielbasa.  Only thing I would change next time is too cut back on the brown sugar - was a little too sweet for me, but my husband didn't want to change a thing !

My husband and I love this recipe. When cooked for supper, we eat it over rice.  We also prepare for just snacking over the weekend and eat it as is.  We make it often, try it!!

I followed the other advice about it being to sweet -maybe that's why it's called candied:) and only added 2 T of brown sugar. Made it on the stove top. Keilbasa is already cooked, so It was done in 10 minutes. I did have to add a little water to the sauce though. And we loved it, and thought that the sauce would make a great coctail sauce as well

This was a *huge* hit at the party where I took it, I wish I had doubled the recipe!  I used turkey kielbasa, so I had no problems with grease.  I thought at first by the smell that the horseradish would be the only flavor, but it turned out sweet and savory and just plain good.  Thanks!

I followed others instructions for cooking on the stove top, the sauce was easy to prepare and total cooking time was about 1 1/2 hours on low.  I must admit I was very concerned about the horseradish (I'm not a fan), but it really did mellow and add nice flavor in the final dish.  Because of the extremely sweet nature of the sauce, I would not serve this as a main course like some suggested... stick to this as an appetizer.  Also, if I were to make this one again, I would use little smokies - not only would the whole dish be easier and quicker to prepare, but I think they would be better suited to the sweet sauce (in my mind Kielbasa should be more savory).  The Slow Cooker Sweet and Sour Kielbasa from this site is much better (but not really sweet or sour - just  yummy).

I made these for a baby shower yesterday and everybody loved them, they were very easy to make, not time consuming at all.  thumbs up and five stars all the way.  I now can add this receipe to my everybody loves collection.   I made it as written, the only thing is that mine never came to a boil, so i left it on high for 2 and a half hours and everyone loved them.

Very good and very easy.  I thought at first the horseradish taste would be too strong, but it mellowed greatly.  I also made on the top of the stove - cooked on low for about an hour and a half.  Served it over rice.  It was perfect!  Thanks for sharing.

Husband loved it.  I thought it was okay.  I guess I expected it to be more crispy in texture. Taste was good. Nice mix of spicy, salty and sweet!

This recipe was fantastic - I made it without any alterations - the only thing that I did wrong was to leave it on low overnight so that it would be "ready" for our early morning Thanksgiving Day party.  As a result, it looked dark - maybe even burnt?- but it was DELICIOUS.  My husband actually liked the dark pieces best!  (I think the brown sugar sumply carmelized...)  It was one of the first dishes to disappear off the table.  
Thank you for this wonderful recipe - I will absolutely make it again!

We thought this was good, but way too sweet.  I'd cut back on the sugar by about half, but that could just be personal preference.  Nice, easy recipe to serve as appetizers!  Perfect on the buffet.

OH MAN!  SO GOOD!  When I make these kinds of recipes, I slice and then precook the kielbasa for a few minutes in the microwave.  (Drain the grease off before putting it into the sauce.) It really reduces the amount of fat in the sauce.  I did only use one pound of kielbasa but could have used 1 1/2 pounds.  Also, I served this with rice and put a bit of the sauce over it.  There was almost none left for my family of four.

LOVED this and I HATE horseradish! Made this for my engagement party full of meat lovers and used little smokies in ADDITION to the kielbasa and not a scratch was left!  I added more horseradish than it called for because my fiance and his friends love spicy foods and I was still able to eat it with the extra kick.  I am making it again tonight for some friends after all the raves it got!

Easy, good recipe. I've used it quite a lot as a simple, quick meal. I add a garlic and a splash of worchestershire sauce to give it a little kick. My boyfriend is Polish and he likes it a lot. I serve it with rice and we just gobble it up.

I make this exactly as the recipe directs except bake it in the oven as another reviewer mentioned, in a foil-lined pan.  I don't have any horseradish, though, so I use a bit of wasabi instead.  I love this stuff!

I feel bad giving a bad rating, but I didn't like this very much. It didn't seem to "blend" well. I thought the sauce would taste more "candied" so to speak. I felt like I was eating kielbasa in hot cocktail sauce. I didn't think the horseradish would be so strong in it, since so many other reviewers said they added more! Well, I enjoy trying new things. This was interesting. Thank you!

I have made this several times, and get Rave reviews.   I split the ketchup,  and add some Hickory Barbeque Sauce with it.

Pretty good. I liked it and so did my picky husband, but he managed to find the only grissle in the whole sausage.  I used cornstarch to thicken. I don't like horseraddish sauce so I was afraid to use horseraddish, I used onion instead it was pretty good.

I made this dish as an appetizer for Easter this past Sunday.  It was a huge hit.  So easy to throw together.  I just put it in the crockpot in the morning and it was all set.  There was barely any left at the end of the day and I made the two full pounds of kielbasa!  Thanks so much.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I have been making this amazing recipe for a few years now, and am just getting around to writing a review.  I have used all kinds of kielbasa, including low-fat varieties, and turkey kielbasa, and nobody knows,  notices, or cares about the differences.  It always disappears!  

I noticed in reading others' reviews, that sometimes people do not have prepared horeseradish on hand. (Since discovering this recipe, I now make sure I always have it on hand).  You can substitute the ketchup and the horseradish for bottled seafood-style Cocktail Sauce.  There's no noticable difference, and many folks may keep that in their pantries.  I always add a few dashes of horseradish in my sauce, too.  

I have this cooking right now, in fact, in my crockpot in my cubicle at work for a holiday pot luck luncheon.  The office smells wonderful, and I'm all prepared to print copies of this recipe to give out or to email :)

I didn't have a slow cooker so I made this
on top of the stove.  Simmered 30-45 min.
Followed suggestions to cut the brown
sugar in half.  Every single one was gone
in a matter of minutes!

This gets high marks for being easy - however I thought it was a bit too soupy. Also, next time I think I will add kraut and onions as another reviewer mentioned and maybe another pound of meat to lessen the soupy-ness. Overall, a little sweet, but real good.

This was really easy and tasty.  My kids who are really picky eaters really enjoyed it.  To make sure they'd eat it, I used horseradish sauce instead of straight horseradis.  It was very tasty.  There was no way my slow cooker would have had this done in 1 1/2 hrs., though.  It took that time just to boil, and then I turned it down to simmer.  Yummy!!

I'm not a fan of cooking with ketchup so I replaced it with molasses and about 1/4 cup of water. I also added about 1/4 Tsp of crushed red pepper so it wouldn't be too sweet. I cut the kielbasa in 1 inch slices and cooked it in a crockpot for five hours.

The results were fantastic! The meat was dark, plump and juicy. It couldn't possibly be easier, well worth the 5 minutes of prep time.

Looking for something different, as well as easy, I tried this recipe for the first time for a party of 25!  Everyone just loved it!  The sauce tastes wonderful, and it is so easy to prepare.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  I used a crock pot.

This recipe is delicious & easy. I’ve made it several times. The last time I added those little colorful bell peppers. Onion & used beet horseradish. Served over some noodles, you’ve got your dinner. It’ was awesome!

Wow ~ Delish!
I was looking for something easy for dinner and went to my old stand by of kielbasa but wanted to try something a little different. When I found this recipe, I thought my picky husband might like it because of the horseradish so I gave it a try. I followed sone others suggestions and used 1/4 c. barbeque sauce, 1/4 c. ketchup, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. horseradish, 2 tsp Dijon mustard abd 2 splashes Worcestershire sauce. Instead of the crockpot, I used my oven, 90 minutes @ 350°. Every 30 minutes I would baste the kielbasa with the sauce. I had sides of roasted butternut squash and buttered egg noodles. Absolutely delicious dinner. The husband ate it up like he was starving. I'll keep this recipe around for future use.

Delicious and easy.  Used turkey kielbasa.  Substituted spicy deli mustard for the horseradish.  I tasted it while cooking and found it a bit too sweet so added more mustard and it was perfect.

Loved it...super awesome.  Pairing it with white rice and a veggies.  Made no changes...perfect the way it is!!!  This would be an awesome appetizer...for Thanksgiving and Christmas, better yet New Years Eve.  The sauce would be good with shrimp  (I am allergic).  

I use to make it in the crock-pot, but It needs to go on the stove top.  Taste better when it boils.  Do NOT skimp on Quality - use Heinz Ketchup and Kowalski Kielbasa.  I absolutely in LOVE with this recipe.  I could eat it every night.  Next time I have to bring something to my church to pass - this will be on the table.

I made this in the oven (personal preference).  I used 1/2 bbq and 1/2 ketchup. I used half the sugar.   I used about 85-100% MORE prepared horseradish.  I used a squirt or two of dijon mustard.  I made enough sauce for the 10 serving version of this recipe. I used beef kielbasa (less greasy).  I am rating written this recipe 5 stars because I would never have thought to add prepared horseradish to a sweet sauce.  That, in itself, makes this recipe as written 5 star!

I use the  Hillshire Farms Li'l Polski's  for this.  Sometimes I add a little more horseradish!  They are a hit at get togethers/parties.

I've made this three times, I really like it.  I grew up with a lot of Polish food, so I love keibasa anyway, but even the rest of my family liked this.  I followed the recipe exactly each time.

It was too sweet or too much for dinner. Much better using this as an appetizer!  Excellent as a finger food.

Made this on an outdoor grill as opposed to in a crock pot and it gave it a true caramelized appearance and taste.  My family really loves this dish.  We made it with a side of rice and a grilled vegetable but next time plan to serve with a side of grilled cinnamon/sugar sweet potatoes..Thanks for sharing!

Oven bake to candy and brown. Broil last 5 minutes. Use half brown sugar and add a small can of mild green chilies.

I've officially added this to our family meal rotation. I have done it on a low slow cooker setting as well as in the oven. It's always come out tender, sweet and a tad caramelized. I serve it and some sauce over rice. If I have it I will also slice up sweet onion to go in with it. The only change made in later batches has been to swap Dijon mustard for the horseradish. My husband and I thought the original was fine but the kids preferred the mustard version and since we're quite outnumbered that's the version we're keeping.

Tried the oven method, and agree that it likely helps thicken things up better and cook faster.  Still, our family personally found this recipe too sweet.  I guess I should have expected candied Polska Kielbasa would be sweet, but had hoped the horse radish would offset this sufficiently.  I could possibly try again by cutting the brown sugar in half or increasing the horse radish, but family consensus was no.

Yum!  Based on other reviewers, I reduced the brown sugar to 2/3rd cup and probably could have reduced to 1/2 cup.  Doubled the sauce (used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce and probably  1 TBSP of Worcestershire).  Cut up 2 medium sweet onions and 2  peppers  (large chunks 1-2 inches).  Placed all in a 9 x 13 pan and baked at 350 for 90 minutes (stirring every 30).  Served over rice.  Gets even better as it sits.  Could have made it on the stove.  Next time, will consider reducing brown sugar  even more and might consider adding some pineapple chunks near the end.  Will certainly make again!

I used this recipe as an appetizer and sliced the kabalasi in half-inch pieces.  It needed a contrast of color and I like pineapple so I added a can of drained pineapple chunks and a little juice to the sliced kabalasi. Then I cooked it and served it with toothpicks. Everyone loved the flavors.

Tasted good, albeit a tad sweet.  Needed something in it but couldn't decide what.  Made fried rice & put the kielbasa over it.  If I make it again, I'll add a potato or two while cooking.

I only had a pound of kielbasa but really wanted to try  this recipe. It was delicious because I read other reviews first.  I cut back on the sugar and increased the horseradish.  I also added a touch of cayenne pepper.  I cooked it for an hour which I should have cut back to 45 minutes.  The sauce was very tangy.  My husband really enjoyed it too. I usually grill my kielbasa but this gives me a way to change it up once in awhile.

I thought it was delicious just the way it was written. I only wish the sauce were a little thicker. My daughter doesn’t like kielbassi, so I added some pork. That was very tasty, too! Thanks!

there seems to be some debate about how long to cook. I went 1 hr on high and 1 hr on low, and I think I'm going to cook it more next time.

Very tasty, tho, and the family loved it with a side of risotto.

Based on the reviews of others, I made a highly modified version of this recipe with several additions, which turned out well. By the way, the horseradish, a prominent smell during cooking, is somewhat less prominent in the eating.

Sorry, but yuck. Way way too sweet.  I added additional ingredients from other reviews to tone down the sweetness. Still, the coating overpowered the meat's taste.

If this is too sweet for you, try my recipe.  Made in a skillet, this takes just a few minutes and your sausage won't be sitting in grease.  Cook up the sausage coins first and drain on paper towel.  Add apricot or peach preserves or jam to the skillet and heat.  Add some brandy or bourbon (op.) an stir in sausage and cook until coated.  These will be great and not too sweet.

Easy as described.  I was going to make it  as such, but made more sense to do it on the stovetop, thicken the sauce faster, let it simmer, especially if using the packaged hot dog like kielbasa as pictured. Made it using legit kielbasa, another time or 2.  Varied some of the ingredients, i.e. A SRIRACHA/horseradish, butcher kielbasa, browned the kielbasa, cut it into 3 inch long links, let that simmer in the crockpot, and so on, much better, added a big can of baked beans with about 30 minutes left another time.

This is a decent recipe...however the sauce did not thicken for me & it was too sweet....and I'm a sweet tooth I love sweets! But this was way too sweet... I think next time I will not use as much sugar and make it a day before, put it on the fridge so the sauce will thicken overnight.

Very tasty.  Being a Pittsburgher I grew up having kielbasa frequently and have always enjoyed it. One minor comment. The recipe description says that it is sold pre cooked. Not always. We go to a kielbasa shop in Shenandoah PA and buy it fresh I.e. not pre cooked and it’s delicious that way also.

I would love this dish but would like to know the other ingredients that are shown in the picture: maybe pineapple, orange halves, carrots, yams, etc.

This is good as is but I also have an easier version. I don't fuss with the sauce, I just use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ and then sometimes add the horseradish. I also prefer grilling the kielbasa over pan baking or throwing it in crock pot. It gets rid of a lot of the fat and I just start basting it with the sauce about half way through.  This mix of savory and sweet and spicy is good all three ways and very adaptable as far as cooking method.  It will gone as soon as you set it out.

Much prefer it as appetizer. Slice kielbasy into bite size pieces and cover with 1/2 cup molasses. Broil for 5 to 8 minutes (little char adds wonders) and turn to broil 3-5 minutes longer. Serve with zingy mustard or horseradish. Smacznego.

We loved this one but since we don't like spicy, I cut down on the horseradish - I used about half. Really good.

I make this in the oven, uncovered at 350 degrees for about 45-50 minutes, and then I broil it for 10 minutes. The sauce thickens nicely and the sausage browns on the edges. I do stir pretty often, just so that it cooks evenly. I also add chopped onions and green peppers - the whole family loves it! I typically make it with cheesy potatoes.

I followed another suggestion to bake this dish in the oven instead of using the slow cooker.  I also added chunks of green pepper and onion to the recipe.  Served it with a Spanish rice with cheese side dish and it was a big hit.  I'd make this again for sure.  Very easy and excellent.

I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  It was ok but it did not caramelize.  I won't make it again.  This would work better in the oven or stove top

This is absolutely fantastic!!!! I read almost every review and here's what I did, I doubled the sauce recipe, fried my kielbasa first for color and then I added 3 sweet peppers (2 red and 1 yellow) and onions in big chunks then put the sauce over the top and put the whole skillet in the oven for 45 min at 350*, and left it do its thing. I served it with homemade Mac and cheese and creamed cucumbers and homemade rolls!!!! my husband had 3 servings and since I had so much sauce, he was eating the sauce on everything, even dipping his rolls into the sauce,  lol. I had leftovers, so the next day we was eating the sauce on pulled pork sandwiches. the sauce is the bomb!!! Wish I could give this 10 stars

Absolutely loved this.  Only had 1 pkg. of Johnsonville Andouille fully-cooked sausage so I halved all ingredients and added 1/4 cup   Bullseye Chipotle BBQ sauce.  Baked in oven for 90 mins. as suggested.  Gone in minutes.

This recipe was out of this world!  Delicious!

The changes I made: cutting the brown sugar down from 1 cup to 3/4 cup.  Also, added 1 chopped white onion and mixed it in with the sausage and ingredients.

Baked it in the oven for 90 minutes at 350 degrees.  Stirred every 30 minutes.

It caramelized very nicely and the flavor was perfect.  Will make this one over and over again.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the recipe I expected to be rating this as a five-star recipe.  However, it was just too sweet for my family.  Even my six-year old who loves sausage, and of course sugar, barely touched this dish.

Very tasty.  I baked it in the oven for about 30 min.   Sprayed the pan first to make clean up easier.  I also added some red onion and green pepper.  I only used half the amount of brown sugar.  Kids liked it.

Even my two year old loved these. The only change I made was adding a sprinkle of cinnamon over it while it cooked. The horseradish completely mellowed out, creating a rich and unique combination of flavors. I will make these again soon.

Very good and super easy. They were eaten up!  Like other reviewers suggested, cut back on the sugar, add Dijon mustard, hot sauce and whatever else you think to spice it up a notch.  I will make these again.

I was a little leery to try these, but I'm so happy that I did! I was afraid that they would turn into a soggy mess, so I baked them first. I think this is an unnecessary step if you just put a clean dish towel under the lid of the crockpot to absorb the condensation. These were a hit at the party

These were awesome!!! They were a tad on the sweet side but it made them good none the less!! I used only 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, squirt dried mustard, a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce & left out the horseradish cause I didn't have any. I served over white rice with a side of broccoli for a very yummy dinner! It was a nice change from plain kielbasa!

Huge hit at work even though I was not sure what kind of horseradish to get.  I got the non-creamy and and threw a blob in. I'm a horseradish virgin. So good!!

Would make a great appetizer. Don't slice kielbasa too thin. I made that mistake. Cooked in oven as others suggested.

Tried this one out tonight. I only used 1lb of kielbasa but kept the other measurements the same for the sauce. I cut the kielbasa in about 1/8 and 1/4 inch slices, then browned on the stove for a few minutes to cut down on some of the grease. Then cooked for about 2 hours; 1 hour on high and the last hour on low. Served over rice. It was wonderful. Sweet at first with a little kick at the end. Very Yummy!

I really like these!  Many of these types of recipes are too rich or too sweet.  This one was perfect.  I liked the horseradish - gave it a nice twist.  Leftovers were great!

This was good - a lot like other similar recipes I've tried...I like the horseradish in it - it gave it an interesteing kick.  We used Lite Kielbasa, and it took away a lot of the grease.  All in all - pretty good.

This is great, especially if you are tired of plain sausage.  Don't be scared of the horseradish, it is not spicy,but it adds something, be sure to add it.

The sauce tastes like any cocktail sauce with extra sugar in it.  It's not bad, but probably won't make again.

I wanted to add another dish for our upcoming Xmas party.  Upon reading the other reviews I decided to try this one and to test it out before the party.  I made this earlier today.  I am in agreement with those who say this simply tastes like kielbasa cooked in cocktail sauce.  I was hoping for a lot more.  I will NOT be using this for our party.  At least it is cheap and very easy to make.

My son wanted to make some lil smokies for lunch but we were out of BBQ sauce.  I told him I would find something on this site and came across this recipe.  He loved how they turned out along with my husband.  My only change was to make on the stove top and of course use lil smokies instead of kielbasa.

I took this recipe to a work potluck.  Everyone loved it!  When I told them how simple it was, they loved it more.  I used the slow cooker way to make this recipe.  I would like to try the oven method if time allows.  This is great to bring to a function where you feel you need to bring something unique.  It is a crowd pleaser.

Very delicious. I too, baked the sausage in the oven. I wanted to make sure it came out with a sticky glaze. I felt they may become watery in the slow cooker. The horserdish flavor was incredible. I will make these as an appetizer next time.

This was pretty good. A bit on the sweet side...next time I plan to add a bit more horseradish and cut back on the sugar. I cooked on the stovetop. The sauce thickened up nicely. Definitely makes a nice appetizer. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe and so easy! I also made the sauce and let that cook in a slow cooker about an hour before I added the kielbasa. Keep it on warm and be careful not to overcook the kielbasa!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was a hit with both the adults and the kids. I used little smokies instead of kielbasa and it tasted great. The horseradish gives it a little kick but is not too hot. You do have to be careful not to overcook them or they do get rubbery. Next time I will turn the crockpot off once they are ready to eat. I will definitely make them again!!!

Loved this recipe.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and baked it in the oven.  I also added a can of chunked pineapple.  Next time I think I will add the juice to for more sauce.

Made this recipe and every one loved it. It was very greasy. I will make it again and again. I do want to try with lite Kielbasa. Even with the grease it was sooooo good and easy to make.

This was so yummy!  I baked it as per a suggestion from another reviewer.  I would only bake for 30-45 min. and keep checking.  The burned ones were like little hockey pucks!  Great flavor to an old standy!

I was excited to finally use my kielbasa that was in the freezer.  Made this, eh not to my taste.  It was simple to make though, so I might make it as a pupu for my toddler's bday party for the parents.  My neighbor loved it though...she ate most of it.  Alright recipe, won't make it on a regular basis though.

When my husband saw me adding horseradish to his beloved kielbasa he almost died, but everyone who came over loved this recipe.  It was a big hit!  I just threw it all in my crock pot and it cooked on low all day long.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I can't believe how good these were. They went fast, and I had many requests. Which is fine, because the recipe was so easy I had already memorized it. You can't go wrong with this one!

For the people who are wondering why this reciped gets great reviews; EASY yet DIFFERENT. I personally let the sauce cook for awhile before I add the sausage. I've made it twice, first with KIELBASA and 2nd with LIL SMOKIES. I cut the kielbasa, but I think thinner is better, so it can absorb the sauce. The 2nd time I made it, I used SMOKIES cut in half. Next time, I think I'll marinade overnight and see if that has an effect. Excellent, sweet and spicy and not your same old BBQ sauce.

I'm not sure what all the fuss was about. The combination of ketchup and horseradish made it taste like kiebasa dipped in cocktail sauce.  I won't be making again.

This was AMAZING!  I couldn't stop eating them!  I'm not a big fan of sausage, but this was addicting.  I did find that it took alot longer in my slow cooker.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was just wonderful. I made this for a potluck at work and it was gone! Everyone loved it. I did not first cook my Kielbasa (its the holidays, time for fat) and I heated it on the stove and then took it to work the next day and heated it in a crock pot for work. A SURE HIT

We loved this recipe.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I was afraid it was too much Kielbasa but it truned out perfect.  Next time I will double or triple the recipe, everyone loved it!

Excellent! It was so easy to make and everybody loved this. I took another reviewers advice and cooked the kielbasa in the microwave for a short time to get some of the fat out before putting it in the crockpot and I also used lite keilbasa.

I can't say enough good about this recipe.  I took this to a small gathering, left it in the crock pot and it was gone.  No one would believe it only had a couple of ingredients or that it was kielbasa.  I will make this one over and over.

I doubled the recipe as others suggested (good thing otherwise there wouldn't be enough).  It masked the taste of the kielbasa...hubby wasn't impressed & neither was I.

Quick prep, easy, delicious!  ***I only used one pound of kielbasa, so I would probably double the sauce ingredients if I were using the full two pounds.

I made this recently for a family get-together with a few known picky eaters.   This dish was the favorite of the night.  Everyone asked for the recipe, I almost didn't want to shre it because it was so easy.   The only things I did differently was add worstershire sauce and make 1 1/2x the sauce instead of what was recommended.  My folks sopped the sauce up with their rolls.  Deee-licious.

Easy to make.  Great taste (the longer this dish sat in the slow cooker on low, the better it tasted).  I don't know if we'd like this over rice as a meal, but as an appetizer it was delicious.

My family and friends loved this recipe (even my picky kids) and have already requested for the opening day of football season.  The second time I made it, I was short on kielbasa and used 1 lb. each kielbasa & weiners - it was still super!

I gave this recipe three stars. I scaled the recipe in half and followed the directions to a 'T.'  Then I had plenty of left-overs so I tried to doctor it a bit by adding a tough of lemon zest, red wine vinegar and majoran.  Same results. Not that that this recipe was bad per say, but to use it as a main dish for a meal didn't go over well served over pasta shells.  As a potluck dish, and alone with toothpicks,I would probably give it four stars.

Easy and tasty, though sweet. I served it over brown rice, to mixed reviews. I substituted bbq sauce for half of the ketchup. Think I'll try it next time with little hot links and maybe add more horseradish for some extra kick.

I decided to use 1/2 the brown sugar as suggested and used this "marinade" on baked ham which I sliced up and mixed all well in crockpot.  I cooked on high 1 hour and 2 hours on low.  I liked it and reminded me of the appetizer with cocktail smokies.  My  kids did not care for it and my husband thought it was okay but prefers meat to taste like meat and not one for to much sauce...I liked it and as with many of my recipes I will have to file it until my kids appreciate my love for trying out recipes!

This is a great recipe. My family loves it. I have made it 3 times and found that the type of kielbasa matters. The first time was with fresh kielbasa, it was the best. The other times were with more processed kielbasa (like Kayem or Hillshire). It was not as good and was sort of spongy. The flavor it very good though.

This was popular at the party I brought it to. I liked it as well, but I found that I couldn't eat too much of it. I think I prefer just plain old kielbase with sourkrout for a contrast of tastes. But this was good. And a great party dish.

This is an easy appetizer to make. I was a little hesitant of the amount of horseradish at first but whent the kielbasa was done cooking the brown sugar really balanced it out nicely! Tasted wonderful!!

This was very good. I didn't have enough time to cook it in my crock pot.  I put it in the oven at 350 for a while then finished it off in a frying pan.  It wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be.
