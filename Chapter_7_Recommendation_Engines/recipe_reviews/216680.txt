I made the heart-shaped cakes for a special Valentines Day event. I used 4 oz of cream cheese and it turned out perfectly (1/2 of a 250 gram block for my fellow Canadians). I put parchment paper in the bottom of my 9X13 pan and buttered it; that made it a lot easier to remove the hearts as I cut each one. I had also cut a second piece of parchment in the same size and used it to plan. I traced around my cookie cutter with pencil so I could see how to arrange the cutting and thus, minimize waste. For the raspberry puree, I used a 400 gram container of frozen raspberries (we don't use ounces here) and added another tablespoon of sugar - that worked fine. I chilled the cheesecake overnight and the next day, I heated the leftover raspberry puree to boiling and added 2 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water, stirring until thick and then let it cool a bit. This thickened it beautifully for topping the cakes. For the drizzle, I heated 1/8 cup whipping cream in the microwave to boiling and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, letting it sit for about 2 minutes and then stirring until smooth. I poured it into a sandwich baggie and cut a tiny hole in one corner to use as a decorating bag. I had more than enough drizzle to decorate them.  I got 8 nice generous heart-shaped portions. Thanks for a great recipe!! I will definitely make it again :)

Are people NOT READING the recipe right.It states 4-8oz. pkgs of cream cheese,not 4 oz. of an 8oz pkg.If they would use the appropriate amount, they will realize how good this really is.

This is a very rich dish.  I followed the directions to-a-t and it turned out great.  However it isn't very cheesecakey.  The chocolate layer is more like a fudge than a cheesecake.  If you want cheesecake, this probably isn't the best recipe as is.  I baked it for 40 minutes in a 13X9. Definitely line it with parchment paper if you are wanting to use cookie cutters, I ended up sabotaging a portion of it trying to get it out of the pan!!

I just made this cheesecake. I made the follow changes: I used 8oz. cream cheese. Instead of making the raspberry puree, I used seedless raspberry jam. Also, when mizing the chocolate and whipping cream- you will still need to keep the pot over low heat, as these chips are large, and need help melting down. Also, bake time for me was 35 minutes in the 13x9 pan.
I just tried to cut the cheesecake using my heart cookie cutter (after about 1.5 hrs of cool time) and it did not work out so well. I will let this cheesecake cool in the fridge overnight, and cut/decorate tomorrow. Hope this helps!!
PS: This cheesecake tastes very good! Very rich! Be sure to serve in small portions. :)

***Addition: I had a HARD time with the two cookie cutters I had. So I was able to get two hearts to come out, and opted to just serve with small squares (I posted under this recipe a picture) After cutting, I added a smear of the seedless red raspberry jam- and then drizzled white and Ghiradelli chocolate on top. THEY ARE DELICIOUS!

This recipe is exceptional! I felt like a top chef winner after making it! To all the questions re: is 4 oz enough?  Yes, it is.  Having said that, I did add a full 8 oz pkg of cr.cheese b/c I never know what to do with the left over cr. cheese. The dark choc is so rich, it really overpowers the cheese flavor so I don't think it matters if I used 4, 8 or 24 oz of cr. cheese because the chocolate flavor really comes through loud &clear!

As a previous reviewer suggested, I placed a piece of buttered parchment paper in the bottom of my 13x9 pan & it came out like a dream.  No sticking or crumbling. In fact, the pieces came out with the cookie cutter! I found that rinsing the cookie cutter between pieces helped reduce the problem I was having with the cake sticking to the cutter. I might try buttering my cookie cutter in the future. Also helpful was using a meat tenderizer (basically a glorified hammer) to gently tap on the cookie cutter once placed on the cake & pushed it down as far as I could by hand. It really helped cut through the crust.  

Like many people, I could not find chocolate graham crackers so instead, I used a package of oreos with the middles scraped out & omitted the sugar in the crust the recipe calls for. I also reduced the butter in the crust to 5 T. to avoid the over greasiness mentioned by another reviewer.

This is a 5+ star recipe & I plan to use it year round.  Maybe star shapes w/white choc ganache & blueberries atop the raspberry coulis on July 4th.

I used strawberries instead of rasberries. I also put the ganache on top. I then added the strawberry puree, and finished it off with fresh strawberries around it. It was completely delicious! I did use 8oz of cream cheese instead of 4 oz (I agree that the 4 oz was a misprint). The chocolate did have a stronger flavor than the strawberries, so I also recommend adding more of the cheesecake filling to berry portion of the cheesecake. Overall, a complete success.

A number of things:

-Don't overcook your cheesecake if you can help. It's done if it's still jiggly in the center when you shake it gently.
-Make sure you semi-cover your cheesecake as soon as you get it out of the oven to prevent cracking. 
-Don't put your cheesecake immediately in the fridge, let it sit either in the open-but-turned-off oven or in another warm place (like the stove above the oven, if you have that) for about two hours. Then let it chill in the fridge for about four more hours (or overnight) before you do any decorating. 
-There's a LOT of raspberry left over if you put it through a mesh strainer like instructed. What I did with it was mix it into a basic buttercream frosting with a bit of the raspberry juice and some red food coloring, and I coated the top of the cheesecake the morning after baking. Then I decorated with some additional uncolored buttercream frosting (flavored with almond extract) and, after that was done setting, I topped it off with the rest of the raspberry juice mixed with rice flour (about 2-1 ratio rice flour to raspberry) and used that as my final topping. If you prefer chocolate, you could use cocoa powder and a little water instead of the raspberry for that final decorative bit.

The "1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese" was misleading.  I used 1 8oz package because that's what I was was thinking this required, and scrambled managing to find another 3/4 of a package in the fridge as well as part of a package of mascarpone cheese... and I still don't think it was enough.  I would agree with some of the other comments, in that the idea of this is nice- but if I had it all to do over again, I'd use a better-rated chocolate cheesecake recipe and combine that with a better-rated rasberry cheesecake recipe.  OH, also, I almost forgot- while the ground almonds in the crust is a nice touch- there is WAY too much butter and sugar.  I currently have grease dripping through the springform pan, it's so greasy.  I'd maybe recommend 1/4 of a cup max and half the amount of sugar.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  First, I could not find chocolate graham crackers so I used chocolate graham animal crackers and chopped them fine...(probably much more expensive).  I added the whole 8 oz of cream cheese as 4 oz seemed way to little  and still the cake was way too dense.  Would not recommend this recipe.

Everyone is right, you need at least 8oz (1 package) of cream cheese for this recipe. Followed what they said it was fantastic! Beware, it's more like an expensive truffle than actual cheesecake. Which turned out to be a happy surprise. Boyfriend called it the best desert I'd ever made. The way the recipe is set up results in more chocolate layer than raspberry, but I stuck with the recipe. 

I don't know how to alter the bottom, but it was very thick and crunchy. Next time I might try using less graham crackers to make it less thick. 

I also did not have any heavy cream on hand; I used a milk, flour, and butter substitute for the heavy cream and it turned out wonderful.  

Four stars because the cream cheese is wrong in the recipe.

This turned out wonderful! It was so rich and delicious and looked beautiful. I was suprised that I could make something look and taste so good. I did use 8 oz. cream cheese instead of 4 oz.

Soooo good! I was shocked to see the 3 star rating. I made this last night for my husband. It was my first time making cheesecake and it was really, really (I mean downright sinfully) good. I'm not even a big raspberry fan and I liked it.

Mine turned out a bit thinner than the hearts pictured (I'll add a photo). I only made one change--honey grahams instead of chocolate. I think it was really nice contrast. I will definitely be making this again. I had no issues melting the chips as the recipe specified. I used half chocolate ganache and half raspberry puree for garnish. I had no idea raspberry puree was so easy--and so good! The hearts were tricky: I have four different sizes so I pressed them into the cheesecake and dug out around the hearts. Then I wiggled each heart a little bit to loosen it and used a knife to keep the crust from separating as I plated. I lifted the heart cookie cutter by the edges and the cheesecake *slowly* slid out.

--To the commenter with the question about the cream cheese: yup, just 4 oz. It was perfect!

This recipe was a huge disappointment. If I was new to baking I might have thought I made a mistake, but i have made plenty of cheesecakes and none were like this. I should have read the other reviews where people decided to add more cream cheese. I followed the directions however, and came out with a cake that had a HARD chocolate bottom layer, and an almost nonexistent, thin raspberry layer on top. Neither of which resembled cheesecake. The puree was the only part of the recipe that seemed to come out as described.
It's a good thing my man loves me despite my decision to try a new recipe! I will definitely not be making this again.

Oh my gosh, these are delicious.  Went to 2 stores, no choc graham crackers so I bought choc stuffed oreos to use for crust.  Didn't add extra sugar.  They gave it a crispy chewy crust.  Just the perfect hint of raspberry in the filling.  Cut out two large hearts and had to throw the rest away to keep from eating it all by myself.  Going to top with fresh raspberries glazed with seedless rasp jam and drizzle with white choc ganache.  Actually quite easy to make.  Hearts would have been easier to cut out with the graham cracker crust instead of the cookie crust.  Can't wait to give to mu daughter and her friend.

AMAZING DISH :)
HOWEVER! This needed some definate changes. I don't know why in the world they only called for 4oz cream cheese. If you do, your batter will look like scrambled eggs. I used  16oz of cream cheese. Also, I used the oreo crust, I think it made it taste way more gourmet. good luck!

For the latest reviewer I have the same questions. I just baked mine in the 9x13 pan and its much to thick to cut with any cookie cutter. I believe the people that cut it with a cookie cutter made them before the recipe was revised to 4- 8oz creme cheese. I realized I had a pampered chef heart shaped bread pan so I'm going to try cutting the hearts with that. Next time I'll either double the crust recipe and make 2 9x13 pans or half the recipe. Sorry I think we are in the same boat as for now. Good luck!

My boyfriend had requested a Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake for his birthday. This came out delicious, but I did make the following changes:
1. I used 12 oz of cream cheese, after reading reviews  that 4 oz was just not enough. 12 oz worked well. Very rich but very delish.
2. I used fresh raspberries (1pint). Made no difference when boiling them...had a very hard time getting the seeds out so I left them in. No one could tell.
3. I did not use all of the chocolate in the cheesecake. I tasted the batter after added about half and it was so rich I could not imagine what it would have been like if I added it all. 

Overall, very yummy. It's really not that cheesecakey though. and also, very heavy.

I followed the recipe exactly (including all 4 packages of cream cheese) with the only exception of 7T butter because I like a crumbly not buttery crust, and 2T sugar in the raspberry puree because I bought sweetened berries. This is a great recipe that makes a tall elegant chocolate cheese cake. It does not taste like typical "cheesecake" because it is chocolate. If you want it to taste like vanilla than don't add the chocolate or add half the chocolate to half the batter (after removing the part for the raspberry) and make a marble cake. My husband and I loved it. It is very rich though.

I make this today for valentines day and cut the recipe in half.  I used strawberries instead of rasberries.  I used a 9x11 pan and baked it for about 50 minutes.  Once it cooled, i used a heart shaped cookie cutter.  Very pretty and very tasty!

This cheesecake turned out really well and it was fun to make.  However, It was not written clearly, as I printed it prior to the footnotes being written.  I logged back on to see if I could find directions for the ganache and found the footnotes. I had to use regular graham cracker crumbs which turned out fine as this cake is so rich.  All in all, I was satisifed with the taste and did not need to make revisions.

Took this to a chocolate party and won a prize!  I didn't separate the batter to mix with raspberry because I didn't want a pink top.  Instead, I mixed the chocolate into all of the batter, spread half in the pan, drizzled raspberry sauce over the choclate, added the remaining batter, then more raspberry sauce.  I marbled the top by swirling the raspberry sauce with a knife.  I kept enough sauce to use as a topping and people like that much better than bites without the extra sauce on top.

So incredibly good.  Especially the almonds in the crust.  I made it on a foil lined 9x13 so I could pop it out when it was cold and set to cut out the hearts.  That part was challenging.  Work quickly before it warms and starts getting sticky and easy to tear.  My regular big cookie cutter shredded the cheesecake.  The cheesecake is too deep to push a cookie cutter in and expect it to come out clean.  I found a roughly 2in cookie cutter, lightly placed it where I wanted it (using the edges of the rectangle cheesecake first to have one less cut) and used it as a guide while I cut it with a knife.  I had about 20 hearts.  I put all my odds and ends in a container to freeze and eat the ugly, but delicious pieces later.  These little cheesecakes looked perfect with melted white chocolate drizzled on top and the remaining raspberry puree liquid (1Tb cornstarch+2Tb raspberry mixed together before adding to the rest of the puree) layered on as well.

outstanding recipe!!  I made it in just a springform pan, topped it with the ganache and piped pink white chocolate hearts all over it for Valentines day.  Huge hit- crust was amazing; make a day in advance because it takes a long time to cool all the way through the springform.  AMAZING RECIPE!!

I think some people are reading this recipe wrong. I see that Sandy didn't like it because she thought it said to use 4 oz of cream cheese. I am reading it as using four 8 oz packages...?? Is that correct? I haven't made it yet but looks YUMMY!! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic recipe! Made this for my girlfriend for her 21st birthday and she has been raving for days about how it was the best cheesecake she has ever had! Definitely a good choice.

No need to get the fancy expensive Ghirardelli chips, 50% cocoa chips made both the cheesecake and ganache taste great. The only other changes I made to the recipe was chopped almonds instead of ground in the crust, and different toppings and display than the picture/recipe suggests. I used the ganache as frosting over the whole cake then drizzled the puree in a grid on top of that. Then in my case I lined the edges and center with 21 raspberries. Quite the display. Lastly, raspberry puree is better with seeds left in rather than strained.

This recipe will take a while but well worth it for the right occasion!
