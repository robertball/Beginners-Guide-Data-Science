I just made these for "V"-day today, and they are like eating play-dough! Very bland even after I frosted them. Were there missing ingredients parhaps?

Very easy, but mine came out very hard.  I think the way the recipe is wrote, it causes you to overwork the dough.

This was easy to make, extremely hard to stir, and tasted like play dough. I think there must be a missing ingredient or two...

I think the recipe needs more sugar to balance the amount of flour. Maybe a cup to a cup and a half more.
