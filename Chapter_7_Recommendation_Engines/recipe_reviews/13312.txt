This chowder is absolutely wonderful.  I come from New England and I adore clam chowder - but due to dietary restrictions, I've had to give it up.  I honestly thought I'd never get to enjoy another bowl of chowder for the rest of my life, because what could possibly compare?  But thanks to this recipe, no more worries!  

I added about 2 cloves garlic along with the onion, and put in about 1/2 tsp. of pepper rather than 1/8.  But otherwise I didn't mess with the recipe.  

After 20 minutes of simmering, the potatoes were not nearly cooked through.  So I covered the pan and let it go for about 10 more minutes.

Excellent, excellent recipe!

I added more vegetables and added 1 large can of evaporated skim milk plus 1 cup skim milk (instead of the 3 cups of milk).  This was loved by the whole family, and with the extra vegetables, the "thickness" of the soup didn't bother anyone.  The problem was there wasn't any left over!

This was a good "cold winter's day" soup, yet it seemed to lack a little something.  It may be that I would have preferred it to be thicker (which I could certainly do next time by mashing the potatoes up a bit). I think I also cut the veggies too large. I think it would have been better if I had cut up the veggies into smaller (corn size) pieces and maybe I'll think of additional veggies to add. I think I will make this again. I'll use more pepper than I did this time (pepper suits this dish well).

My family loved this, but I found it a little too 
liquid-y. I was hoping it would be a little like the T.J.I Friday's Potato Soup, which is a good deal thicker and seasoned. Although the soup was good, I found the base too milky. Having said that though I'll certainly make it again. I served it with corn muffins. yum.

This is my kid's favorite soup to eat. It's healthy, easy and versatile. I sometimes add a can of corn or creamed corn during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I have made this soup probably more than 50 times. It's a regular at our house.

this is a very tasty soup but the name is a little misleading - there isn't anything creamy about this soup unless you make it with milk and a roux to start (which i will do next time i make it!!)  however the ranch dressing mix has a great flavor to it, without actually tasting like ranch dressing, if that makes sense.  i added lots of other veggies (peas, broccoli, cauliflower, corn) and topped each bowl with some greated parm.  i think a healthy amount of black pepper is a must, too.  was a great warm-up on an early chilly night here in the northeast!

Oh my! I made this for myself when I came down with a cold. I improvised with the ingredients I had on hand and added chicken to the broth while cooking the vegetables. I used skim milk with the full amount of cornstarch/water and it came out perfect. Super comforting! Thank you Amy Brumfield for sharing.

This chowder is excellent! I am always looking for low-fat creamy soups, and this really hit the spot! After reading some of the reviews, I made the following changes.. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onions. I also put in 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of fat free half-and-half (instead of the 3 cups of milk). I also added in two cooked boneless chicken breasts that were shredded and a can of creamed corn at the end to thicken it up. So creamy and delicious!

This is very good, but I think the liquid to veggie ratio is off.  I would double the veggies, and I added corn and garlic, too.  I used one of the cups of milk mixed with the corn starch to thicken the broth before adding the rest of the milk because it needs to boil to thicken and milk-based soups tend to stick to the bottom of the pan!

Good flavor, but the broth was too thin to call a "chowder". I doubled the cornstarch and added to pureed squash to thicken the broth. Adding chicken works too.

I love this recipe.  It is so tasty as it is, but also very versatile.  For more flavor use 2 slices of bacon instead of margarine.  To make it vegetarian use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and if you are vegan just drop the milk.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Instead of chicken broth I used a roasted vegetable broth, added some cabbage to it and cayenne pepper to make it spicy.  I will make this over again...for sure.

This was so good!  Really simple and straightforward.  I added a little more salt and pepper and a can of white beans at the last minute to make it a complete meal.  Will absolutely make it again.

We really, really didn't like this.  Bland, thin, and generally unappetizing.  Not sure why our perception of the dish is so different from so many others, but will not be making this again.

I only made a couple of adjustments to this recipe, which is a first for me, since I change EVERYTHING...First and most importantly, I NEVER use margarine, I ONLY use butter...same fat content as margarine and margarine is one molecule away from being plastic! (in case you didn’t know), to that I added my own blend of seasonings including garlic powder and dried onion (hate the real stuff), onion powder and a bit of lemon pepper (use it in almost everything).  Second, I wanted something a little more refined looking so I strained out some of the vegetables about 2 cups total and then I blended the rest of the soup using the potatoes from the blended soup to thicken instead of the cornstarch.  The result was actually a very nicely colored light orange soup.  I then added back in the reserved veggies, served this with homemade garlic bread (ok, really homemade garlic butter on fresh bread) and a garden salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese and croutons).  I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  My guests even took home the left over soup!

**I have made this actually a couple of times since and have gotten rave reviews each time.  This is an easy and inexpensive way to feed a crowd, and I love finding those kinds of deals :> **

this is the first soup i've made from scratch...and it turned out beautifully - taste, texture and all.  great hearty & healthy soup for cold winter evenings.  i usually make it hours before serving to give it a chance to thicken more and to let all the flavours blend.  great with the easy mayo biscuits (also on allrecipes), and leftovers are a nice treat.

An excellent recipe for those cold winter evenings when you need something to warm your insides, and because it low in fat, it is also good for diabetics.

This was good and easy, perfect for a weeknight meal with a fresh, hot loaf of bread.  We only used 2 cups of milk (we prefer thicker chowder) and added a drained can of corn.  Def going to add some minced garlic next time as it could use some punch.  Yum!

Omitted margarine, and just threw all veggies into the stock pot with chicken broth and let it boil until veggies were soft. I then added leftover ham and let them simmer on low for 20 mins or so before adding milk and cornstarch. This soup was good, but not my favorite way to make a chowder. I prefer the roux method better. But all in all this was still a nice meal on a chilly night.

This is a good low fat chowder.I add either frozen corn or a can of cream style corn to mine.Both are really good.The corn just adds a little sweetness that we like.I've also used red potatoes and we thought they were good in it.I always serve this with cornbread and we love it.

**Needs some tweeking**  My changes and additions were:  added two chix breast (boiled and shredded), 1/8th tsp thyme, used two C Skim Milk, one C Evaporated Milk, omitted the water and the salt, and dumped in a can of creamed corn right before thickening...  Next time I will definitely use two cans.  As is written I was not impressed.

Excellent soup for a cold winter night! We added 2 grilled chicken breasts, 2 cloves of garlic and a can of corn. I did add more pepper also, but did not add salt because I used "Better than Bouillon" Chicken Flavor which has sodium (plus we had grilled the chicken breasts with salt and pepper). I used part fat free half and half, heavy whipping cream and 2% milk. I'm not sure of the amounts as I just needed to use up the cream and half and half that I had in the fridge. As other reviewers suggested, I did mix the cornstarch with the milk, adding it at the same time as the parsley so it would simmer for a while longer to thicken. This was a very tasty comfort food soup that we will be making again. Thank you! :)

Delicious!  I love garlic and pepper so I added 3 cloves of minced garlic in with the onion and doubled the pepper.  The only other change I made was to add chicken.  I used boneless skinless breasts, which I broiled for 5 min on each side and then cubed and added about 5 minutes after the potatoes.

The recipe was good, but just not great.  I stuck to the basics of the recipe.  I left out the celery (which I hate) and added zucchini and yellow squash towards the end.  I also added a little bit of white wine to the base.  As others have mentioned, the cheese did turn out rather chunky, and I used cream cheese!  I expected it would kind of blend in with everything else once it got hot enough, but that never seemed to happen.  The vegetables were good, because they were just the right consistency--neither soggy nor super crunchy--although I felt I should've added the potatoes to the carrots sooner, because those took a while to cook on their own.  All in all, the recipe was good, but again--it just wasn't great.  It didn't have that something special to make my taste buds sing.  I was a little surprised, because I love potatoes and all the veggies.  I might make this again, but I'm just not sold on it.

Super yummy! I would only make one change - a bit more corn starch at the end to thicken it up a bit. Other than that, so fantastic! :) I served it with a crusty Italian loaf to dip in it. I will make it again soon with bread bowls for an even yummier experience!

Really nice winter soup!  I used a leek instead of the onion because I like really  mild onion flavor.  Also, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I made the soup a little thicker by adding the water-constarch mixture before the milk and letting it boil for a while.  I am definitely making this again.

Love this recipe!  A perfect winter soup.  I crushed in two cloves of garlic and added a little garlic powder on top of that, then seasoned to taste.  I also made it with half whole milk and half skim milk, but would make it again with only skim milk to make it low fat.  I also added a can of cream style corn as one reviewer suggested.  Excellent!

This soup was wonderful, though I changed a couple things:  I substitued the 2 cups of carrots for two cups of canned, drained corn.  I also added 2 tsp herbes de provence, and used fresh parsley at the end, along with lots of pepper.  That seemed to give it a well-rounded flavor.  It was so satisfying!

One of our family favorites!!!   I make it thicker by sauteing the onions in butter first, adding  flour, then adding to the soup.  I also add extra potatoes, carrots and celery.  Love it!

This tastes like diet food. It reminded me of the soup from the cabbage soup diet (only "creamy" vegetable instead of cabbage). Not creamy at all. Bland. We will eat all the leftovers only because we are trying to be healthy & I can't waste food. Two stars because it was cheap to make.

Cooked this recipe as written and tasted a bit bland after a taste-test, so added lots of garlic and onion powder and a bit more salt while still simmering.  My mom loved this soup.

My only problem was that I didn't make enough. My toddler gobbled it up. I've never made chowder with cornstarch before. Is it me or does it have an aftertaste? In any event, I HAD to add mushrooms - which I will omit next time because it darkened the soup. :( For my toddler's portion, I added leftover bologna. I envision something like parsnip and definitely some creamed corn (not too much!) would be great additions. I confess I added hot sauce to it (I know, I know....lol) Other than those minor 'diversions', I made it as the recipe said (I even measured my carrots in the 2-cup scoop!)

I didn't like the flavour of this soup very muc hat all, I followed the recipe to a T. I added additional veggies such as broccoli, peppers, and peas and I still wasn't impressed.

An awesome soup for when you're on a strict budget. I myself often add some garlic powder to spice things up.

Good, but will have to do something to thicken it up a little more for next time.  Mine came out a tad too watery.

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. Sometimes I'll add cooked chicken. I find that it comes out better if you let all of the vegetables cook much longer before adding the milk.

Excellent recipe! I had some left-over ham from the holidays that I wanted to use up, and I added about 1/2 a bag of left-over frozen corn I had and this made an amazingly good soup! I have never been good at homemade soup, but this turned out well! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious...I used 5c. fat free/low sodium chix broth and 1 1/2c. fat free 1/2 and 1/2. I also used 1 tblspn. butter and 1 tblspn. evoo to sautee the veggies. I added onion, carrot and celery as stated, then added 4 baby reds cut into bite size. I added a bag of frozen broccoli/cauliflower mix, about 1c. frozen corn, and some leftover steamed green beans. Whatever I had, just made this chowder better. I did have to increase the H2O/cornstarch to thicken since I added more broth. Family loved it....even got my 15 month old to eat it up!  Will make again, thanks!

I have made this about 5 times this winter - it is just delicious. I use home-made chicken stock and add a half can of evaporated milk (instead of whole cream milk). I also blend half the soup, so it comes out thick and creamy. Great for dipping your toast in! even my 17month old likes it (I just serve her the smooth bit).

Excellent recipe!  I followed instructions exactly and was very pleased!  Just a note on the broth, I only use boullion cubes not canned broth and it seems to taste so much better.  Just be careful with the salt if you do it this way!  Thanks so much for sharing...

This was good, I followed others advice and added garlic but I think that was a mistake, and I really love garlic.  The soup didn't thicken for me but I have trouble with cornstarch I think it should be allowed to simmer a while with the cornstarch in it.  I made with cheddar bay biscuits from this site and they were a great easy compliment to the meal.

Nice, simple steps and easy ingredients.  I hate when there are things listed in a recipe that I can't find at the grocery store.  Definitely need to add some garlic to it though for flavor.  I also put in "celery seeds" seasonings.  Great for a low-fat recipie!

Great, easy recipe. I'm a 26 year old male, and I don't cook very often. Here, you just cut up some vegetables and throw them in a pot. This soup's thick, delicious, and vegetarian. Only complaint I have is that the dang store only sold celery in a bunch, and it just went bad in a fridge (I don't eat celery outside concoctions such as this).
