Although this recipe is a nice soup it is not traditional irish veg soup. In Ireland we never would blend any part of traditional vegetable soup, we cut the veg up to desired size before adding. Also this soup starts with first making home made stock using either a beef bone or chicken carcass. Then all the vegetables are added and left to simmer and near end you add seasoning. Potato is not used as a vegetable in soup. It is served with a whole boiled potato placed in bowl.

I hate being the first reviewer, but here goes nothing.  This has a good flavor to it in spite of the lack of seasoning.  I had never used parsnips, turnips, or leeks before but I would use them all again after this.  I would  not, however, put all of a stew in the blender again.  I wish I had only blended half of the stew  so that there would still be some texture to it.  It came out more like a root vegetable mash than a stew or soup.  I cook the vegetables in chicken broth instead of water and didn't drain off anything.  I still needed to use several cups of water to to turn this into anything resembling "soup".    I made this for St. Paddy's day dinner but no one ate much of it.  It looked unappealing and probably should have less carrots or carrots cooked separately so that the color looks less like orange-y mud.  Be sure to watch the veggies closely as they cook so that they don't brown.  It was tasty though and shows some real potential for alteration.

Excellent soup:) - the changes I made were that I added red lentils, barley, split peas, garlic, and used chicken stock instead of water.  Also I only part pureed so that it was creamy but still partially chunky - more like a soup than a stew.

Just got back from a trip to Ireland and this didnt taste anything like the soup I had several times while there.  The color and texture was right, but this seems like an unfinished recipe.  I substitued range free chicken broth for the water, but that wasnt enough and I ended up having to add a bunch of seasonings in order to give this soup some flavor.  It seems like it's got potential, but it would be nice to have some additional instructions as far as seasoning.  I compared to a few other recipes on the internet and ended up adding chicken boullion, cumin, thyme and sage.  It helped alot.

I loved this recipe!  Just got back from Ireland and it tasted exactly like the soup we had there.  Instead of water, I used chicken broth and I also added a little (maybe 1/4 cup) of cream.  Served it with parmesan scones.

I left out the potato flakes and added some barley instead. I also only half pureed so some of the veggies were still there. I thought it was very good though a little lacking in spice. Next time I make it I think I will use vegetable broth instead of water to correct that. I enjoyed it, as a vegetarian I would never use chicken broth so all the reviews that suggest meat ingredients are missing the vegetarian part of the recipe. I know it isn't authentic Irish food but that's because it's changed up for vegetarians.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  I used kosher salt, omitted the pepper, added garlic and only pureed have the soup for an even mixture of chunky and smooth.  Got great reviews. When I reheated the soup I sometimes added butter to my individual serving.  I think a tangy cheese would go nicely. What I have in the end probably isn't Irish though.

This recipe is pretty good- but I found it didn't exactly match that Irish Soup I had been missing. Instead of some of the veggies in the recipe, I added broccoli, which I found to be the key ingredient in the Irish soups I had had.

Good basic soup. I sautee the vegetables in a little butter, then add chicken stock to cook. I omitted the potato flakes and use a little cream to finish.

As a new vegatrian, I'm also looking for new recipes.  As the last review I would use vegatable stock instead of the beef or chicken stock.  This is a hardy soup.

A good and filling soup. I took the suggestion and only pureed half. I like some big chunks of potato in mine so I used large potatoes and also some baby new potatoes. I also cooked in some whole shallots to add a little zing - be sure to take these out though, a whole boiled shallot isn't too nice! :). Overall a tasty soup.

This was good and filling.  Followed a suggestion and added barley and split peas.  Also added about 1/2 lb beef stew meat (in small pieces).  A bit bland, but extra garlic and seasoned salt helped with that.  Kids opinions varied - 2 came back for seconds, 1 could hardly finish her first helping.

This soup is very healthy and tastes great.  I added in bay leaves, rosemary, celery seed, salt, white pepper, black pepper, and garlic.  I will experiment with different herbs and seasonings next time.  I did not drain the water out after I boiled the vegetables.  I used my immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving a few chunks of vegetables.  I did thicken it a little with a cornstarch and water mixture.

I went to Ireland last year and this soup was so much like the ones I had there. 
I cooked the veggies in about a 1.5 cups of water and then just puréed it in the pot.  I can't wait to try other combinations.  In Ireland there were some of the soups that were pea based.  ENJOY!

I made some of the changes suggested by other reviewers: using chicken stock to simmer the vegetables, no potato flakes but adding about 1/2 cup barley, and pureeing about 2 cups of the soup (not the whole thing).  I've been using a seasoning of a mixture of organic herbs.  With that added, no other seasonings are necessary and the soup is delicious!

Great taste even though I couldn't find parsnips. First time I've ever used leeks and I really like them. My only complaint is the texture. I will puree only half next time. Served with dark beer and Irish soda bread.

I just spent several weeks touring the Northern half of Ireland and Northern Ireland and this is exactly how the soup was served at every restaurant and B&B I visited (I had it nearly every day it is so good!) You could tell the mix of veggies would vary slightly but it was also blended and served with a hearty brown bread. I know there were some comments about potatoes not being used or the soup not being blended, maybe a regional thing? Not sure, but this recipe is very good - I added some celery because I enjoy the flavor. Green split peas added and blended with the soup is also very good.

I make this all the time  - grew up in Scotland with Irish grandparents (both sides) eating it just like that, but as I matured, it became too bland.  I sautee onion and garlic in olive oil first, add all the ingredients she uses in the recipe with a big handful of chopped parsley  a minced stalk of celery and add chicken broth and water.  I add another handful of parsley ten minutes before serving. Never throw out water vegetables are cooked in.  If you cannot use it immediately, freeze it for soups and stews. It's loaded with leached nutrients.

I traveled in Ireland in 2012, and ate variations of Irish vegetable soup almost daily, because it was almost always vegan-friendly. I see several reviews that this soup is plain/bland, but understanding the history of Ireland and the food they had access to, you have to appreciate this simple soup for what it is: cheap, filling, and healthy. I minimally altered the recipe, in that I used 4 potatoes (instead of using potato flakes), a whole onion (instead of half), and 2 cups of not-chick'n broth instead of water (in hindsight, I will reserve 2 cups of the cooking water and add a bouillon cube next time), plus salt to taste. It is very reminiscent of the vegetable soup I had in Ireland.

Fortunately, I was looking at all of the reviewers comments while making this soup AND "The Splendid Table" was playing on the radio.  I look at this soup as a sofrito.  A base from which to grow.  I sauteed carrots, leeks, onion, and turnips in the fat which I had just seared pork ribs (for the slow-cooker) to which I added French grey sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  Last, I added red fingerling potatoes.  This took about an hour to soften and cook.  To this I added the cup and a half of veg stock (from Trader Joe's).  Let the vegetables cook for 20 minutes.  Pureed half of the vegetable mixture then reintroduced it to the pot.  Before serving add a half cup of cheese (like a nice sharp cheddar) and a half cup of cream (or half and half to warm).  Of course, it is not vegetarian. Butter or olive oil could be substituted easily for those who are!

We used to have this as a child but not as soup.  We had it as a side dish.  I make this but minus the potato flakes and leeks.  We called it smashed veggies. Of course we added butter and mild to the final dish.

Bland at best.  More work than it's worth.
