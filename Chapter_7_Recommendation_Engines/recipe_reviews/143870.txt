The peppers and onions make this dish.  I was a little leary of all that liquid smoke so I only added about 2 tsp. maybe a little more.  As others did, I cut the oil way down.  Didn't use the tequila b/c I didn't have any.  Added fresh minced garlic to the marinade.

I used the recipe primarily for the onions and peppers (for another beef recipe), and they were tasty.  But, they were very oily.  I doubled the peppers and onions, and there was still too much oil.  They have a slightly sweet flavor with the addition of the liquid smoke, so if you like that sort of thing, this recipe is for you!

We often use this recipe to utilize leftovers as fajitas.  We take whatever meat we grilled the night before and slice it thinly.  Then, we use the tequila/lime juice/sauce/veggie portion of the recipe to make veggies.  Once that's done we toss the meat in the tequila/lime juice/sauce/veggie and put it in a tortilla with rice, sour cream, salsa, and cheese.  It's AMAZING!!!  This spice combo is delicious.

I made some changes just on my preference, but regardless, this was sooo good!! I did make changes as I didn't have lime juice, but I did have margarita mix, so I marinated the steak in patron tequila, (which I am sure made a difference, don't use tequila you don't like the taste of) and margarita mix and it was really good!! I also had a pack of fajita seasoning I threw in, and I had never used liquid smoke before but I didn't notice a really smokey or off taste at all from it. I also didn't add as much oil like others said, maybe 2 tbsp, just because I didn't want my vegies slimy, and I added just a little more worcestershire and liquid smoke just so it had enough liquid. I also added a tiny pinch of corn starch because it did seem really runny, like a water consistancy, may have just been from the veggies watering it down, I am not sure...I made some fresh tortillas, and topped with some sour cream!!! My husband and I really enjoyed this!! Thanks!!!

This was really good! I agree, less oil for the vegetables would be a good thing. I actually sopped up the excess with a paper towel. Also, I let the oil get too hot before I added the liquid smoke mixture. I tossed it in and it was really lucky I wasn't standing over it. It was like fireworks and was a big mess to clean up. Loved the flavor though!

Just made these tonight and wow, the marinade is the bomb!  I squeezed fresh limes for the juice and it really made a difference.  I bought round steak already thin sliced and did it in the cast iron skillet and did my vegetables in it after I removed the meat.  I also cut down on the oil and liquid smoke, but other than that, followed it to a T.  Delish!

If you are using a non-stick pan, you won't need any oil, in anything else, spray some olive oil or pam. I had to use chicken as that was what I had on hand....other than the over abundance of oil, the recipe is good. P.S. I would also recommend using some liquid smoke in the marinade, and cutting back on the saute part.

This was excellent!  I used new york strips because that's what I had.  I reduced the amount of liquid smoke to about 1/2 tsp. and that was plenty.  Liquid smoke is very concentrated and can be very overwhelming.  The sauce was terrific.

Not what I was expecting,  I will back off on the liquid smoke next time and not use so much. The meat was very tasty though!!! We also served in with guacamole and sour cream.  My husband liked it alot. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent! I did reduce the oil to barely cover the bottom of my cast iron skillet, and only used about half the liquid smoke. It was restaurant quality awesome!!

Liked it.  Did what others said and used less oil.  Will definitely make again.  Used red pepper - may add a little jalepanos for heat.

I didn't use the marinate.  I didn't have the 2 hours to wait.   I also cooked everything inside using only one large skillet.   I also added a little water, about 1/4 cup to the onions and peppers.   I didn't want the onions to start browning.  When the veggies we just about done, I added back the steak and then all the spices.   The tortillas were warmed on a flat grill.  When everything was ready I added sour cream and fresh cilantro and drizzled lime then wrapped them like burritos.  My wife doesn' t like sour cream so I added grated medium cheddar and diced fresh tomatoes.
Very tasty and only about 1/2 hour with prep time.  I'm fast in the kitchen so plan on a little more time when you haven't made them before.

I only made the peppers/onions. Turned out good. BUT, a half cup of oil is WAY too much. I used one green pepper, one red pepper and one onion and only used about 2.5 Tbsp oil.

Had some leftover steak that we grilled the evening before so I chopped it up. I added what was called for in the marinade to sauté all of veggies & steak. Very nice flavor; simple & easy for a weeknight dinner.

we liked this a lot after i doctored it up with chili powder, more black pepper, and some tapatio sauce.. i cooked everything in my cast iron skillet.. i recuded the meat down to 1 lb but i was still left wanting more veggies in ratio to the meat.. i also reduced the liquid smoke to 2 tsp as others mentioned it was overpowering.. idk if that would have made a difference.. lastly, the amount of oil was way too much.. either way, ty for the start of what turned out to be a tasty dinner
