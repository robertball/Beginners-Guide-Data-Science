I love poached eggs, firm white and runny yolk.  The grandkids call them 'Dip Eggs' because they like to dip toast into the runny yolk.   I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 because the cooking time of 6 minutes is too long, especially if you are going to be re-heating these, as suggested for poached eggs for a crowd.   3 - 4 minutes is usually perfect.  The picture I added to this recipe shows the egg poached for 5 minutes and served immediately, not re-heated,  most of the yolk is fully cooked.  If you use a slotted spoon and gently lift the egg up and give it a little jiggle you will be able to see if the white is fully set while the yolk will still jiggle.  Another tip - if you stir the water in a circular motion and drop the egg into the vortex (center) of the swirling water, the white of the egg will wrap around the yolk and make a pretty little package.  You don't have to use champagne vinegar, any vinegar will do and if you don't have vinegar - that is OK too.  Really fresh eggs are best for poaching so if you are doing poached eggs for a crowd it pays to plan to get very fresh eggs.

This was my first time making poached eggs, so I followed the recipe and 6 minutes is way too long. The eggs were not runny at all.  I was very disappointed.

Great tips especially how to do more than two for a crowd.  I always wondered how restaurants did it. Either that or they have a pro doing hundreds of poached eggs for Sunday brunch.  Now we know the secret. I love that Chef John isn't too fussy and will show what happens if you don't use the freshest eggs. And keep an eye on the eggs, 5-6 minutes is the max, it's like cooking bacon, it doesn't take more than a few seconds to overcook.

Very good technique. I watched the video and touched the egg  rather than timing it. Like others said, 6 minutes was a tad long, so just keep an eye on them. I also made a whirlpool and dropped the egg in the center as I've seen in other videos. It worked like a charm and it was my first time making these. They were perfect on my eggs benedict!

I have used this recipe for years but sometimes I use dill pickle juice.  It gives the eggs a little different flavor.  As the others have already said 6 minutes is too long, 4 is about right.  Also if you put a bit of salsa and sour cream on them they are great served with a heated tortilla.

I love Chef John's videos...always informative AND entertaining! I poached my egg for 5 minutes and the yolk was a little too firm for me. But that's an easy solve. Next time I will cook for only 3-4 minutes. The demonstrated process works great.

6 minutes is too long when cooking with a gas range. I tried again reducing the time to 4 minutes and they turned out much better.

This is an excellent procedure for poached eggs.  For those who felt theirs were "too hard", i.e., "not runny enough", it all has to do with how heavy or light a simmer you have.  When you try it next time, be sure to compare your simmer to the video, and try to match it.  Also the more you agitate the water, the harder it is to control it's heat.  Try to bring egg up at around 4-6 minutes & lightly touch, to determine how done it is.  This is really the only way to really determine the egg's readiness.  Another thing, I put this type of recipe in both my "breakfast or brunch" file, as well as my "procedure" file.  HTH!!!

Here'a a different method:  Take a Texas muffin tin(makes big muffins), non-stick,  Spray with Pam.   Put in a tablespoon of water, pour in the egg, center the yoke, put a tablespoon of water on top.  Place in a 400 degree oven.  The length of time depends on how well done you want your eggs.  Eight minutes is about right for me.  Scoop out with a large spoon.  Makes up to six eggs at a time.

As so many said, 6 minutes is too long for most. 

Even though this is repeating, I want to stress that your rate-of-boil/simmer really, really does make a difference. If you are new to poaching eggs, reduce to a very low simmer and get a feel for poaching. As your experience grows, you can increase temp and reduce cooking time. 

Also, another point not made in comments: altitude makes a VAST difference. Even at just 1,000 ft, boiling points are different. Times in recipes need to be seen as guidelines that must be adjusted for each individual's location/equipment.

I poach eggs almost every day.  I also use a gas stove.  I do use the white vinegar, but skip the salt.  On my stove 2 minutes makes a perfect poached egg.  Use slotted spoon to remove, drain on paper towel, turning once, move to plate, season as desired and delish.

As many have pointed out 6 minutes is way too long and not a good idea to ever put the eggs in cold water after cooking - even if reheating.

Very helpful. I’d have left eggs in for one more minute since whites were just a little runny.  I used extra-large eggs straight from the refrigerator.

I hate cooking any kind of breakfast. Everything has to be done at the same time in a time of day that is basically my middle of the night, if I’ve even had sleep recently, lol. Because I suffer from severe insomnia, my short term memory is very poor and I’m no longer able to multitask or even do one thing and talk about something else while I’m doing it now. So, I like cooking one thing and then moving onto the next, without having to worry about the first thing spoiling or getting cold or hard. But this video helped me immensely. We get eggs right from the chickens the same or next day if we want now, so I didn’t know that they’d work better than maybe the ones I’d tried poaching in the past. The ice water saving for later tip blew me away! Yay! And it worked great! I used to love cooking but I wreck things so much now; however, tips like the ones in this video just might give me some of my confidence and desire to create in the kitchen again. Thank you, Chef John!

My first attempts at poaching eggs and they come out perfectly using this method. I cook them for a little over 4 minutes and don't cool them in the ice bath. The yolks come out firm with some liquid gold and taste amazing.

6 minutes is much too long if you want runny yolks.  Otherwise, it was very good.

3 to 5 mins, fresh eggs is a must. One extra step, I strained the eggs to get rid of the " flakey" part of the white.

your best bet is get an egg poacher-6 cups style. little butter in each cup put eggs in high boil-3 minutes for very running and 3 1/2 for stil running but solid-any more expect hard to medium runny-cooked these for the boys in duck blind as well as home-never any complaints-time may vary depending on pot

I was failing miserably at poaching eggs and this little video took me to perfection!!!  I would agree that, based upon the heat level/boiling that I was using, 6 minutes was too long.  I will play around with that!  Thank you so much!
