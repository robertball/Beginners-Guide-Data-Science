i didnt have the broccoli but i kept everything else pretty true to the recipe. i dont think i used 2 cups of mayo but i probably used more than 8 oz of the salad dressing. i used a home made version from this site. i like the dry mustard in this. it gives it something extra. it makes alot but i sent some to my mother in law and she called for the recipe. ill try it with broccoli too but i dont see how this could get any better. five stars.

Holy pasta salad, Batman!  This makes a TON of pasta salad (I'm already making a mental list of dinner invitees so it doesn't go to waste!).  If you're making this for a family dinner, you'll probably want to halve it.  I made as is, though I did use only 24 oz of pasta as I realized my boxes were 12 oz as opposed to 16.  I also bought broccoli crowns (I'm lazy), instead of 2 heads (I used 3 largish crowns, instead).  I also reduced the mayo a bit (and I always use light mayo w/EVOO) to lighten it up a bit.  Surprisingly, there was only ONE bottle of red wine vinaigrette in all of my grocery stores bottled dressings (I'll make my own if I make this again, but wanted to stay true to the recipe this time).  This is a nice change of pace pasta salad and I really like the amount of veggies in it (I also added a bag of shredded carrots to add some more color/nutrients).  While it won't become my "go to" pasta salad, I'm definately glad I tried it!  I'm looking forward to customizing it a bit; I think I'll add some chopped banana peppers (w/juice) and a handful or two of shredded cheddar, too.  THANKS for a very nice recipe, Hope!

This is a great recipe.  I only added steamed broccoli flowerets and red onion to the tricolor pasta.  Also made my own vinaigrette using red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and fresh oregano. I added this to the mayo and it made a great dressing.  I'll make this again.

This was a little to vinegar-y for me so I added about 1/4 sugar and that made an improvement.  Overall, it was good.
