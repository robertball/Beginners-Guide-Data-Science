Decent recipe, I got many great reviews from everyone eating, but I personally wasn't a big fan. Directions are unclear (mix cumin in on its own? no thanks)

I will most likely make this again, but with my own additions and dressing

I just used champagne salad dressing instead of the other liquids. It was a big hit!
