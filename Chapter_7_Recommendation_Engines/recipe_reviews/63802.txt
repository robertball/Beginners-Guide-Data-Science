This is an awesome chocolate cake. Very moist and rich chocolate flavor. Easy to make also. I have made it three times in the last month. Everyone loves it.

This chocolate cake is the best chocolate cake I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  The frosting is out of this world!  We absolutely loved it.  Double the frosting recipe and it's even better!

Sorry, but I wasn't too impressed - it was okay, but if I'm going to make a cake from scratch I expect it to be outstanding.  I did like that it wasn't too sweet, but the texture was like a cake from a mix, I thought.
