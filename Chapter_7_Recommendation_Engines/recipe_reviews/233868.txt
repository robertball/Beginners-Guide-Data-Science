This recipe is right on target for roasting Brussels sprouts.  I'm still learning to like this popular vegetable, but it's not really high on my favorites list yet.  The glaze is nice, and the bison bacon is really different.  It's not exactly bacon, but it is a good alternative, health-wise, and it adds texture to the dish.

This was very good. If you haven't tried Bison yet, what are you waiting for?
I have made a recipe similar to this one that calls for Pancetta instead of Bison Bacon. I'm happy to say that I liked this even better. I did want a bit more salt & pepper on top, but that's just me. These were yummy and I'll be making them again. Kudos to the Bison Council for sharing a great dish.

I also made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner using regular bacon. Everyone enjoyed these, even the picky veggie eaters! There was nothing left and everyone wanted the recipe! I will be making these again this year, Thank You

I made this for our Christmas dinner. The only difference is that I used pancetta for my bacon. There was nothing left.

I just didn't care for this.  By the time the sprouts were tender they were pretty charred.  Don't need to make them again.

Excellent! I've only used regular bacon with this recipe and it is delicious.  Even my kids eat it!

This was a delicious and refreshing way to eat brussels sprouts. Aromatic, flavourful, and easy to prepare. We didn't have bison bacon so we used regular bacon. This recipe has been added to our family favourites.

this was shockingly good. I just used normal bacon, and it was fantastic. Even my kids, who don't like these brussel sprouts, actually ate it.
