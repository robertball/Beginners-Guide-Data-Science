My coworker made this in a crock pot. She added an orange slice and cinnamon stick to each glass - it was so good! I am going to make this for New Year's Eve.

I absolutely love this recipe. I too made it in the crockpot. The sliced orange is a great idea. Will definitely be serving this on Halloween night!

I love this punch! I had it once at a bridal shower and didn't get the recipe. Now that I found it I'll be making this often. Thanks!

This is such a nice change for a hot beverage on a cold fall day. The kids loved this and so did I. I made it in a crock pot originally but the kids have been adding red hots to the apple cider and microwaving it.

A great and easy hot beverage for the fall. I have made this for big and smaller dinners and it is wonderful. I've had good cooks asking what it is made of. This is a keeper in my files for entertaining

.nice and easy. Everyone enjoyed it with several people especially telling me they liked it. the orange slices helped make it look like you worked harder. maybe I'll try lemon slices next time.
