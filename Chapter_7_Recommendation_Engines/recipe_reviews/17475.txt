With my native Texan hubby needing a fajita "fix" I prepared this on one slab (both sides) of the beef and just sprinkled the other slab with a popular brand fajita seasoning. I was scared that he wouldn't like this at all since limes are more of a southwest thing than a Texas (San Antonio) thing. This recipe won, with our entire family, hands down! I used dried cilantro and lime juice from the plastic bottle, omitted the anise. One thing I must add, I doubled this recipe and it was barely enough. This is a rather pasty concoction (I could add more liquid but we were honestly thrilled with the taste so I hate to fix what isn't broken) and I would definitely not hesitate to double/triple again in the future. We marinated beef about 30 hours. We will definitely be using this recipe again and again! Muchos gracias for sharing the recipe and I hope that my comments have helped you with your meal planning. Mmmmm!

I agree with other reviewers that this was too limey (and I only used 2 limes!) and also lacks flavor of typical fajitas.  I added cumin and extra red pepper flakes and it helped a little, but...anyway, I'd make it again adding more spices (oregano, chili power or paprika, etc.)  Oh yeah, I only marinated for 2 hours and the lime juice began to "cook" my chicken...I can only imagine what it would have done overnight...cringe...

Very tasty! I think this is the best fajita marinade I've had, at home or out.  I like that it didn't call for a ton of oil.  I probably would have given this recipe 4 1/2 stars if that was possible, only because my husband thought the chicken we marinated (overnight) was a little heavy on the lime.  The leftovers weren't quite so lime-heavy.  I think the next time we make this we'll use a bit less lime juice and make up the difference with some broth.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Okay, don't ask me why, but --

I added a dash (a DASH) of cinnamon for complexity, and one tablespoon of red wine vinegar to bring it all "up and together."

Wow.  Thanks!

This is an awesome marinade.  I tried several others before I settled on this one.  My family loves my chicken and beef marinated in this.  I make quesadillas all the time using this recipe.  I have not used any of the Anise seed.  The recipe is good as is.

I have been looking for a good fajita marinade for years.  My search has stopped here. I only used 1 1/2 limes, my family is not a big fan of the flavor. They were excellent :-)

This was so wonderful! I don't think that I will ever enjoy fajita's out as much again. I changed the recipe just a bit. I didn't have any green onions so I used fresh chives (a big handful) also, I used paste cilantro since I had it on hand. I didn't have fresh limes, but used key lime juice insead. I also added some chicken broth to stretch the marinade so that it completely covered all the meat. I ended up letting it marinate for three days before using it. Then I cooked the meat, adding some marinade as it cooked, and put it on a platter in a warm oven while I cooked the sweet onion and red pepper. I also added some of the marinade to these as they cooked. Once it was all carmel colored we had the best fajita dinner ever!! I also smashed some freshed avocado (with added lime juice, garlic powder and sea salt). Can't imagine eating fajitas without guacamole. Hope this helps someone.

This recipe was very good. I doubled it and used a 2lb. london broil. I sliced it and marinated for almost 24 hours, and it was fabulous! It seems like a ton of cilantro, but the cilantro flavor ends up milder than you think. I left out the anise and cooked with regular onions (and peppers) instead of using the green onions. Will definitely make again!

I gave this one a 4-star becuase I thought it was just okay.  My husband and kids really liked the fajitas (made them w. chicken), but I didn't think they were the best I've ever had (I'm mexican so I've had some awesome stuff).  I will probably make it again because I did like it, but next time I probably won't add so much lime.

I loved the lime and cilantro taste. This recipe was excellent, I used chicken to make the fajitas. Be careful the zesty marinade will stink up your refrigerator.

Very good recipes if you use it as a base and not a finished product.  Definitely needs salt.  I also add a lot more spice to it.  Have added both cayenne pepper and a habenero pepper to the marinade, either adds a nice amount of heat.  Additionally I add some honey to it to mellow out the lime flavor.   My version would be: 3 Limes, 4 Green Onions, 6 Cloves of Garlic, 4 T Cilantro, 2 T Olive Oil, 1 t Crushed Red Pepper, 1 t  Ground Coriander, 2 T Honey, 1 Habenero Pepper or 1 t Cayenne Pepper (optional)

AWESOME!  Followed a couple others & added that dash of cinnamon & Tbl of balsamic vinegar and only used 2 limes. (I've made another marinade & it was too limey for us before).  I also marinated about 24 hours & used sirloin cut into strips.  This was a great marinade!  I made my onions as I had with another recipe from this site, Texas Chicken Quesadillas, and put my bell peppers in another pan with some oil and a very small amount of packaged taco seasoning & then threw the peppers on the grill where the beef was cooking.  These fajitas rocked and I will be making them again for sure! Thanks for this great marinade!

This was very yummy on chicken fajitas.  I was out of cilantro, sadly, but it would have made it even better.  Instead of coriander or anise, I added chili powder and cumin.  I loved the lime.  It wasn't too limey.  If you don't love limes, obviously this recipe isn't for you.  I marinated chicken strips for about 10 hours in this, and then cooked them with strips of red onion and red and green bell pepper.  Had them on whole-wheat tortillas with shredded pepper jack.  Really yummy!

This was WONDERFUL. BUT... I did change it up just a tad. I left out the cilantro becuase we didn't have any, though I would have loved it with it as well. I added a bit more lime and a bit more garlic than the recipe called for, and I cut my chicken into strips rather than whole breasts and only marinated about one hour- which was PLENTY.  I then grilled the chicken breast strips and I think grilling added a TON of flavor to these already wonderful chicken pieces.  The only other change I made was that I subbed some ground red pepper for the red pepper flakes and only used a big pinch since it's hotter when ground in my experience.  Used light tasting olive oil instead of veggie oil just as a preference.  I served my grilled chicken in warm tortillas with onion and peppers that I grilled along side the chicken in a foil packed (the onions and peppers took about an extra 20 minutes so if you do this put it on first).  This was such an awesome meal to cook outside when it's too hot to cook inside.

loved this marinade!  another freezer meal attempt - tossed the chicken breasts and marinade in a freezer bag and froze.  took camping with some fresh veggies.  thawed and tossed all on the grill to cook then sliced and the whole family raved - couldn't even tell the chicken had been frozen!

I made this with Beef Skirt Steak and it was Awesome.  The meat had a wonderful flavor that rivals any restaurant fajitas I have tasted.  I forgot the recipe when I went to the store so I had to make a few changes.  I did not add the coriander or anise and instead of the red pepper flakes I had crushed red pepper on hand. It still turned out wonderful. I can't wait to try them out on the extended family for the football watching games coming up.  I also plan to try it with chicken as well.  Many thanks for this great recipe and now everyone can know the secret to restaurant style fajitas at home.

I like to initially follow recipes to the tee, and so I did with this.  I read other reviews just to see what I may expect, good or bad, and found that like most reviewers, this recipe is QUITE heavy on the lime!  Even after letting the chicken marinate for about 5 hours, the lime was exceptionally strong.  I like a blend of flavors.  The marinade eventually kind of thickens, after hours of sitting and cooking, but I think it needs a slight thickening agent (flavored or unflavored). It is very watered down.  I would suggest decreasing the lime by half.  Also, the writer said to add in coriander and cilantro - which are the same thing, essentially.

I did not use anise seed, as we wanted a spicier marinade as opposed to any sweetness.

Definitely zesty! Made this to go over strips of beef. I feel as though there was an ingredient missing, however. Can't put my finger on it, but the meat didn't have the richness I associate with fajita meat. I know a lot of places finish their meat off with a dollop of butter, so maybe that was it. I will try this marinade with chicken, as well. It only marinated for 2 hours on the counter top and all of the flavors really came through. I did have to used onion powder because I didn't have any green onions. Easy to prepare!

Everyone at my father-in-law's house enjoyed the different flavor of this marinade. I used it on flank steak. I personally would rather have a soy sauce-based marinade for steak, but for chicken I think this would be great!

I added to already cooked beef, 2 lbs.,  dried garlic, dried onion, taco seasoning, a whole bunch of cilantro, corriander, cumin and a little basil, two small cubes beef instant bullion 1 1/2 cup water and cooked in a crock pot on low for a couple of hours.  Could not keep the  kids out of it.  Was going to have it tomorrow night but had to serve it tonight or it would have dissapeared.  Had to keep warm for a late commer and it was too salty so don't cook too long  Yum

Excellent marinade!  It was a hit at our mexican dinner party!  I marinated it for almost 24 hours and the meat literally melted in our mouths.  Be sure to use good quality meat (I used ribeye steak).  I also tenderized the meat with a heavy weighted spiked tenderizer (Pampered Chef) I can't wait to make it again!

This really was a tasty marinade.  I left out the anise and doubled the garlic, delicious!  I prepared chicken and shrimp fajitas and they both went over a storm.  I sautéed the peppers, onion and garlic in the same marinade as well.  Yummm!

I really did not like this chicken at all. It was far too tangy. However, I might be biased, I prefer a fajita with a bit more heat.

I have lived in Mexico for extended period of times and my wife is from Mexico. We both loved these. They are so flavorful with true mexican ingredients. I served them once to friends and they raved about them everytime we seen them for weeks. When we return to Mexico and open our restaurant these will definitely be on the menu. Thanks for the recipe Susan

This was really easy and very good.  I used lime juice and according to the bottle it said I should 9 Tbsp of lime juice (to equal 3 limes) which was way too much.  I think next time I will try 6 Tbsp Lime Juice and 3 Tbsp water.

I marinated two grassfed top sirloin steaks in this for about 30 hours, and the fajitas were very good.  It didn't tenderize as much as I had hoped, but the flavor was nice.  I used the full amount of lime juice but added some homemade chicken broth after reading other reviews and I am glad that I did, otherwise it would have been too limey for us.  I also added a tiny bit of cumin.  Next time I would add more cumin and maybe some chipotle chili pepper and some cayenne too.  I didn't think a whole lot of flavor came through beyond the lime.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is great and I'm from Texas, so I know Mexican my food. It gives the meat a lot of flavor. I actually only used one lime rather than three. I think three would have been way too strong, since the one lime was already prominent. In fact, next time I might bump it down to half a lime. But, other than that it was perfect.

This was so heavy on the lime!! and was missing something. I followed this recipe exactly and my family wasn't thrilled. I think you whould only use one lime for its juices and add half a cup of jalapeno juice and half a cup of the jalapenos from the jarred jalapenos. maybe half a green chilli wouldnt hurt? its just not hot at all and way to limey. i made my adjustments the second time round and it had a better consistancy too. Not a bad recipe but DEF NOT our fave.....

Fantastic Fajita Marinade!  Per my own flavor likes, I did add chili powder and cumin to the mix.  After I let the chicken marinade, I boiled it (especially since I used chicken thighs, whichy are on the fatty side and it's easier to take the meat away from the fat after it is boiled).  Then I shreded the meat and went to town making fajitas.  Just a little FYI that I learned from a wonderful little Mexican woman at the supermarket . . . if you're picking out limes, try to get the smooth/shiny limes, they have more juice!  I've followed her advide and it's worked for me so far :)

Excellent marinade! Used it to marinate split chicken breasts, then grilled them up and only then sliced them and warmed them through with bell peppers and onions on the skillet. Wasn't too limey, but I can imagine the lime flavor being too strong if you try to marinate pre-sliced beef or chicken. In this case, I wouldn't do it for more than a couple of hours. Overall, great flavor and the final product easily compares to fajitas in some of my favorite mexican and tex-mex places.

Great marinade - super easy.  I sliced and marinated 1 1/2 lb chicken for 18 hours, and the meat was so tender, with great flavor.  I didn't add the anise, and only used 2 limes - definitely would not add more.

Did not have coriander & anise, so not sure if that made a difference but I did not like this recipe.  Needed salt or something.  No flavor, too limey.

Definitely one of the best fajita marinades I've used (btw, once you've done homemade, you can never go back to the high-salt, artificial-tasting envelopes!). I typically use about twice the garlic, and I've used regular onions when I didn't have green onions. If you have a food sealer, this works wonders with the vacuum-sealing jars.

This was very good! This will be my marinade for any fiesta type chicken from now on, I'm thinking next time I will do burritos with Rice and Black Beans. 
My only critiques are that I would use a little less Lime than called for, maybe 1.5 limes vs. 2 limes. 
Also, I was hoping with the red pepper flakes that this would have a kick but it was not spicy at all. I added some ceyenne pepper and it was PERFECT!

After trying many different approaches to beef fajitas -- this is now my favorite, go to recipe. I used this Saturday night for dinner -- and even though I only had 1 hour to marinate the meat, the flavor turned out great. Don't skip the anise, it adds a unique, distinctive flavor which is really nice. For meat, I used the tri-tip steaks from costco and cut them into strips before marinating.

I was really apprehensive about this recipe because I am not a big cilantro fan but this turned out great! I only used half of the pepper flakes since my daughter doesn't like food that is too spicy but I will certainly be recommending this to friends!

This was just so good! I won't lie, I didn't exactly follow the measurements. I "eyeballed" it, but I used all fresh ingredients. I put the chicken and steak in my Food saver marinator. Put them on the grill, and they turned out so tasty. They were a huge hit for our Cinco de Mayo party. I will use them from now on for fajitas (and probably just as a regular marinade).

I was looking for something to give some chicken a little kick for using on pizza and this is perfect.  Thanks!

Lime is much too strong!  If you make this dilute the lime juice or all you will taste is lime!  I only marinated steak in this for 4 hours, thankfully not the recommended 12-24, and we could hardly eat it.

If you like lime you'll like this marinade.  Followed to the "T" and, did not like it at all.  Too tart for fajitas.  The acid in the lime juice cured the meat.  I had to choose one star.

This smelled AWESOME when they were marinated.  When we used them in our quesadillas they were good but I wouldn't say they were fabulous.  I'd like to try it again and just throw the chicken on the grill instead of putting it in something.

I can only give this 4 stars because I didn't have everything it called for and had to make quite a few substitutions. This is a great base recipe that you can tweak to meet your families needs!

I thought this was really good.  Lots of lime flavour, which we like.  I marinated it for about 24 hours and used a good steak.  Perhaps a bit more spice next time. Thanks for a good recipe!

Using half of the limes, this recipe is enough for about 1 1/2 lbs. of meat with a perfect tang to it. I kept everything else the same. Made two batches, one for steak and one for chicken, and made awesome fajitas last night!

My husband and I loved this marinade on flank steak. It tasted great and the meat was tender. We let it set for over 12 hours. We can't have the sodium that comes with using soy sauce and the others, so the lime is wonderful and no added salt!

I really enjoyed this marinade. I experimented on a large brisket - I know it sounds crazy! I pierced and marinated it for two days (forgot about it, lol) and when I grilled it up, I had soft flavourful tortilla beef. I doubled the amount of crushed red pepper flakes and added few dashes of Worchestershire sauce, as its sweetness compliments and binds all the other ingredients together.  I served this with Authentic Mexican Tortillas, Roasted Tomato Salsa: recipes for both are on this website. 
This was a true allrecipes meal and great all around.

We tasted more lime than anything else, but I liked how fresh my fajitas tasted (I've never used anything but the packets of seasonings... which I will never use again!).  Did both steak and chicken slices.  The guys (husband's football buddies) ate them up.  One of them asked what was in the marinade!!  I'll add more 'heat' the next time I prepare this one.

Awesome recipe thank you for sharing.
I have since started to stray a bit from the recipe by adding other ingredients and using diffrent cuts of meat.
In my opinion you will enjoy the results if you follow the recipe and then tweak it next time you try it. 
Fresh ingredients, less lime and skirt steak on a grill seem to work for me. cheers and have fun.

I have made this a few times substituting cumin for coriander. Definitely don't marinate as long as suggested especially if using chicken and shrimp. I did steak for 3 hours, add chicken in the last hour and a half, and shrimp when we started the charcoal grill. The taste of lime in the steak was really strong when tasting the steak by itself, but it blended perfectly in a fajita. This is not a marinade for a steak dinner but for fajitas and in fajitas it works.

This was great but I left out the anise and only had 1/2 of a lime so I used that and one lemon. I also used olive oil and doubled it. Will make again.

This marinade was excellent! I thought the cilantro was going to be too strong, but it wasn't at all. The only change I made was to omit the anise seed, only because I didn't have any and couldn't find it in the grocery store. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of cumin.

This tastes restaurant quality - hubby and I both loved it. Even my finicky teen didn't mind it. Will definitely be using again!

Tried this recipe but added 2tsp of soy sauce and replaced the coriander with lemon zest. Marinated flank steak and chicken breast but I only had 6hours to marinate. I cooked both meats on the grill and my guests loved them!

This has become my favorite fajita recipe. The only changes I make are adding a teaspoon or so of my adobo seasoning(Traci's Adobo on here minus the salt)and sometimes some chipotle pepper or cayenne as well. I have made it with two and three limes but don't find it makes too much of a change in the "lime" level some people complain about. This reminds me of Texas fajitas.

I don't know why, to me this was only ok.  I thought it was bland, even after adding more garlic and red pepper flakes.  I did like the cilantro though and the coriander.

This marinade wasn't very good. The lime flavor was overpowering and that was all I could taste. Perhaps it should be called Lime Fajita Marinade. I don't think I will be making this again, in favor of something more traditionally fajita-flavored.

Delicious!  I blended it in my Magic Bullet and then marinated sliced chicken breast.  It was tender and very tasty.

I served it on a salad with red peppers, cilantro & cheese.  Delish! 

A definate keeper for us.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as posted but didn't add the anise.  I used striploins and marinaded it overnight.  It was a hit and there were no left overs!

It was good... but could use more spice.  I didn't think it was "too limey" as other had said.  I'll use it again with more spice.

Pretty good flavor. I marinated my chicken for about 8 hours, and next time will probably marinate longer. I think I used too much meat for this amount of marinade, so next time I'll make more of the "sauce." I think I'll probably make it again. I sauteed green peppers and onions and added to my fajitas. Left out the anise and green onions.

I didn't really care for this marinade. The chicken was edible but the lime flavor was way too strong. I might as well have just marinated it in lime only because that's the only flavor that came through.

This rocked! I was only able to marinate for 3 hours, but the flavors were great and the (cheap) cut of meat was so tender and flavorful! I forgot green onions and used some chpped Vidalia onion, and had to use garlic powder in place of fresh, but it was still good. I'll follow the recipe as written next time. The fresh lime and fresh cilantro was a HUGE hit.

Loved how tender the meat turned out.  Usually our fajitas are tough. I thought there was a little too much lime though, (and I love lime).  I think I'll cut it back a bit next time.

This is truly an exceptional marinade.  I used it on a very cheap cut of skirt steak, and the meat came out tender and very flavorful.  I added the juice of two additional limes and used an entire (small) bunch of green onions, chopped.  This was the first time I had ever made fajitas, and they turned out great!

This is awesome! (I did it with chicken) I would do it again and again! The flavor is fantastic-- it is a real keeper. It is not only great for fajitas but I would recommend it for just serving chicken or other meats by itself. Sarah
