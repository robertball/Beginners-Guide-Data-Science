I was a little disappointed by this recipe.  Just out of the oven the cookies were great.  A little crispy on the outside and a little chewy on the inside.  The Coffee Liqueur flavor was subtle.  The next day the cookies were really hard.  I might try more brown sugar next time.  I may also increase the coffee liqueur.  My rating would be 3 stars, but it appears that my husband loves hard cookies, so the rating increased to 4.

These were good but not great.  I cut the size of the cookies down to a heaping teaspoon which also required less baking time (12-13 minutes).  I used parchment paper also on the baking sheets.

This is a great cookie if you like chocolate - and very easy to make.  I will definitely keep this one in my recipe box.

These are very good.  Although they are not soft cookies, they came out chewy and a little crisp.  The flavor is very chocolatey with a little hint of coffee.  I had a craving for a coffee-chocolate combination, and these fit the bill!

Made these cookies with the following alterations: dissolved coffee in boiling water instead of liquer (didn't have any on hand), cut the sugar down a bit, and used white chips instead of chocolate chips. My cookies came out with a great texture and flavor but are a bit drier than I prefer. Also, the white chips did not want to adhere to the batter and didn't melt very well in the oven. Definitely a great dipping cookie! :) The flavor reminds me of a mocha java drink. Next time I will use regular chocolate chips.

After reading the reviews I was a little hesitant. I made some simple changes to make them a softer cookie. I switched the amounts of the brown and white sugars and added a tsp of canola oil. After they cooled, I noticed they were crunchier than I would like so I (followed my grandmother and mothers trick)put 2 slices of white bread in the bottom a sealed container and placed cookies on top. It made them soft and so yummy ! Would definitely make these again !
