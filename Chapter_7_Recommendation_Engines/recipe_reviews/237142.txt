I was thinking this would be an awesome easy recipe to try with Miss 12 and I had all the ingredients on hand. After an hour of churning it didn't thicken at all. We still had a thin liquid. Plan B add the eggs beat heat make the usual ice-cream recipe custard and try and salvage the ingredients. Still wouldn't thicken. A total waste of time and resources.
