I added a 1/2 c  of cocoa powder to make them chocolaty! Very tasty. Advise to cook a little less time for a chewy brownie if you like them that way.

These were good, but I think "brownie" threw me off a bit.  I was expecting a decadent chocolate/cinnamon delight, but it's more like an oatmeal raisin (w/out the raisin) cookie bar than a brownie.  Interesting change of pace, but not sure I'd make them again.  THANKS for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! It was easy to make a smaller batch (I adjusted it to 6 servings and made it in a small pie pan).
