These were excellent! I did use whole wheat bread because that is what I had on hand. This browns up nicely and is a good grown up version of a grilled cheese. I do think the serving size is off. As directed this makes the equivalent of one whole sandwich which only serves 1 person in my opinion. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
