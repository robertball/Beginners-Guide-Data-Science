Beyond yummy. I used Grand Marnier Liquer instead of whisky. I also used orange extract instead of orange zest. I served it with a sweet strawberry sauce.

When my grandmother passed, she took her recipes with her.  This is the closest I have come to replicating her cheesecake.  Only thing I did different was omit the orange zest, and add a pinch or so of anise seed (my grandmother's cheesecake had that anise flavor).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy and not too sweet. I used small custard dishes and halved the recipe. I prefer almond extract over vanilla in many recipes and used it in this.  Sprinkle cinnamon on top after done and serve with strawberries/blueberries.

Thanks!  My nonna gave me her recipe, but didn't tell me to refrigerate it or leave it on the counter.  Appreciate your specific reference to refrigerator...

I like this cheesecake. I put two cans of cherry filling on top of a 12 X 9. I was apprehensive about it after my first slice, preferring cream cheese, but after day 3 it's growing on me. Literally, lol.

It is an interesting dessert (in a good way).  I mixed in some cocoa powder instead of the cinnamon, used splenda instead of sugar, and low-fat ricotta.  Except that it was chocolatey, I think it turned out the way it was supposed to turn out.

this recipe uses too many eggs. it really tastes more of a souffle than I remember my Nonna's tasting. 

I'm going to try and find a different recipe that uses less eggs

I didn't have any liquor so i just used the juice from the orange. My family loved it and said it was better than regular cheeze cake!

Yum! I did a few changes though. Instead of orange zest, I used orange extract. Instead of sugar I used confectioners sugar, sweetened it to taste because other reviews said it wasn't sweet enough. I also made a crust using nila wafers and melted butter. I garnished it with crushed pecans. This turned out great! Will bake again with my changes.

I had high hopes - but I hated the texture! It wasn't very sweet on its own, and topping was absolutely necessary. I like my cheesecake sweet and untopped, so this wasn't the recipe for me.

I have not made this but would like to point out to everyone complaining about the sweetness that this is an ITALIAN recipe. Italian and Mexican cheesecakes are different from American cheesecakes. Different cultures have different ways of cooking. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean there is something wrong with it. It's just how that food is made under that culture and wih what that culture prefers to use.

Not a standard cheesecake; the texture is eggy rather than dense.  More like a sweet, crustless quiche.  Nice, light flavor though.  Might make a good breakfast dish.

I thought this needed to be a little sweeter. Quite nice, but I will go back to recipes with half cream cheese and half ricotta as I wasn't crazy about the full ricotta texture.

Yes I made this it was very good. But  one thing it doesn't taste like a cheesecake more like a Flan.( Please don't feel insulted hard to tell when on the other side of a computer.)I made a strawberry sauce pour over and still very good Thank you  for sharing. I will make this again.

This is my 1st Italian style cheesecake and it was a little drier than my usual recipes, but it was very good. Having read other reviews, I added more sugar (1/2 cup) and I also used 2 lbs of ricotta and 1 lb of cream cheese instead of all ricotta. I had to use an immersion blender to get the cream cheese bits to completely blend, but it worked very well. I  substituted Kentucky Cherry liqueur instead of whiskey and put a cherry sauce (made with frozen cherries & the same liqueur) on top. It was really pretty and tasted delicious.

Oh boy this sure was delicious. The first time I made it I didn't seperate the beaten eggs from the rest of the ingredients. But it still turned out good for my first time baking. But when I made the  2nd time I seperated the eggs which made a difference. And used rum instead of the orange flavor. It didn't taste as rich which was good. And this time I added blueberry pie filling. Can't wait to make it again!

There was a grainy texture to this cheesecake, and it tasted more like a cross between custard and bread pudding to us.  I baked them in cupcake form to have indiv cheesecakes & they also fell in the middle.
