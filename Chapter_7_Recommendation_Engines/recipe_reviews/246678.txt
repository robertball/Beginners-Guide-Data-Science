I made these into Stromboli using 3/4 of the dough, and then the remaining into crescent rolls. Everything turned out delicious, and my family loved them!

Just made the dough.  Waiting for it to rise.  Smells really good!   Good things come to those who wait.   We shall see - going to try it with my homemade chicken salad.

I do not know what is wrong with this recipe but it is awful. The rolls were unable to rise much and it did not even go together as the recipe says.

Awful, absolutely awful. The dough was just mush, never came together. Proofed the yeast, it was just fine. But the dough hardly rose. Couldn’t roll it out without adding huge wasteful scoops of flour. I should’ve just chucked it at that point, but I wanted pigs in a blanket, so I soldiered on. Baked as instructed, which was way too long. The roll had no flavor, was gritty and inedible. Ended up scraping it off and just eating plain hot dogs, which was the best thing that came out of this recipe...

These were pretty tasty, although they didn't look light and fluffy like the main photo. the dough felt more like pie dough texture-wise. Rolled out beautifully! I only used 1 1/2 cups of flour, as it didn't seem to need any more as I added. My house temp is a cool 65 degrees so I ended up putting the bowl in the oven with it warmed up a little to raise the dough. I think i will try again with more refinements.

Nearly impossible to shape into crescents and the taste wasn't worth the effort.
