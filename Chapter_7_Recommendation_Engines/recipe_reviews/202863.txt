This is the ONLY way to eat pepperoni! I've been doing this for years. If you get all of the oil out of it it's crispy like bacon and better for you. But you don't need to bake it in the oven you can just put it in a microwave oven. Just heat the slices and check on them every 20 seconds or so. And don't bother with the cajun seasoning. Holy salt Batman! Pepperoni is salty enough.

We make these in the microwave all the time. Place the pepperoni on paper towels on top of a paper plate for just a few seconds. The paper towels soak up all the grease. The kids love these.

I enjoyed these I don't think id make them to eat as just chips but they're great with dips (creamy pizza dip tomato sauce even sour cream based chip dip!). If you line your pepperoni on a few paper towels and microwave them for about 15-20 seconds before you put them in the oven you can get a lot of the grease off before hand & they don't smoke as much in the oven. Just make sure to watch them closely. I take mine out when the centers are still a little bit chewy they crisp up when they cool and its a good way to make sure you don't over bake them.

I think I might be nominated for Mom of the Year tonight. I just ran about 7 batches of these through the microwave in 20 second increments on paper towels to soak up the grease in about 30 min. It takes about 4 to 5 rotations per batch. They are crisp but not burned the house isn't smoked up and they are ready for snacking tonight. My guys are going to love these. Best part is...someone gave us 5 gallon size ziplocs full of pepperoni some time back...they've been in the freezer. So now I know what to do with them!

I concur that these are all right. They really taste like crispy bacon only spicier. With the cajun seasoning they are even spicier! The first bite I took must've been one of the slices I sprinkled a little too much seasoning on bc my mouth was a bit on fire after it. When all is said and done not so sure these are my favorite. If you love crispy spicy bacon these are wonderful. I tried them a couple of different ways because not all of the pepperoni fit on the pan the first time. I tried it with the cajun seasoning first then baked without. Either way isn't too bad--just a matter of taste. If you like spicy and are worried about the salt there are a few salt free cajun spice mixes on here that you could use. If you're not a big fan of spicy I would recommend you not use the cajun seasoning. However I'm not a huge fan of crispy bacon and so I don't think it's quite for me. Still I am glad I tried them. Took a bit of time and effort and now I know what they taste like!:o) Thanks for the recipe.

These were alright. I followed this exactly and turned my back for a couple of minutes after I sopped up the oil and there was smoke coming out of the oven! It was very late at night and I was so worried the fire alarm would go off and wake everybody up. I grabbed the cookie sheet and ran with it outside. They were burnt...so I figured it was my fault. So i trashed them I made a 2nd batch. I sopped up the oil after a few minutes and they immediately started to smoke again and once again I had to run outside with the smoking pepperoni! This time they were NOT burnt after everything was said and done my house was smokey and smelled like pepperoni. I wont make these in the oven again...just not worth it.

I love these. I have used this method prior to adding them to my pizza. No grease on the cheese! It also works throwing them in the deep fryer. This renders out most the fat making them a bit better to eat.

I've been doing this in the microwave for years. Kids love them as snacks. Adults too since I'm always honest in my reviews lol. Best pepperoni ever! 30 seconds in the microwave makes for perfect non-greasy pepperoni pizza. If nuking them for a snack 40 seconds. YUM!

These are yummy! They taste like bacon and I ate all of them. Good thing I bought a party pack of pepperoni. My family didn't feel the same way about them though unfortunately.

I always pick the crispy pepperoni off pizza saw this and thought it would be good. It was great. I only had turkey pepperoni but it was healthier.

These were pretty good! It is a definate MUST that you keep a close eye on them as I was not paying attention and they got a little darker than I would've liked. I made 1/2 a batch w/ cajun seasoning and the other 1/2 plain. I liked both but the plain ones were definatley less salty. The little guy loved these but I knew he would because he LOVES pepperoni. I used 'sandwich pepperoni' because that's what I had. I may try these again sometime! Thanks for sharing.:)

I made this recipe for a football game this weekend to use along with some different dips. I made some with Cajun seasoning and left the rest plain. The guys liked the plain ones dipped in buffalo sauce the ladies liked the plain ones dipped in cheese sauce the kids preferred the plain ones with marinara sauce. I can see this as a way to please many taste buds provided you have different sauces or dips to go with them however no one liked the Cajun seasoning. Pepperoni has a lot of flavor on its own without adding additional seasoning to them. I found that by baking them this way they lost a lot of the salty flavor as well which is very helpful for those on low salt diets and most of the fat is soaked up in the paper towel so the pepperoni seemed healthier. I laid them out on a rack inside my jelly roll pan so most of the fat dripped off into the bottom which also shortened my cook time as they were cooking all the way around at once. Great snack for the football season.

I just made some of these in the microwave. Easy and tastes great. I need to do a little experimenting to figure out the time with my microwave because they weren't all evenly crisp but that's the microwave for you.

We liked these chips! This is a good no carb low fat snack. I made them 2 ways...with and without Cajun seasoning. It was very spicy with it and still very good and spicy without. I experimented with the microwave. I got the best results by putting the sausage without touching on paper towels and covered by paper. My microwave produced the best results by cooking on high for 2 to 2 and a half minutes. Each microwave is different so you'll need to experiment with yours.

This just was not a favorite for me. I didn't like the texture--the pepperoni is so dry and even dipping it in marinara sauce didn't help for me. I don't think they taste like bacon at all--it just has the same texture as when your bacon gets too overdone. For a snack I like putting pepperoni on paper towels in the microwave for about 10 seconds to get out a lot of the grease; this way it isn't so dry.

These are delicious and exactly what the name of the recipe states. I'm not understand these lesser reviews because of the crisp texture. It doesn't say "Pepperoni flabs." I did mine without the additional Cajun seasoning and they were just wonderful! If you struggle with reading or comprehension, you shouldn't leave a negative review.

Made these in the microwave both regular and turkey versions. Both were outstanding! The turkey pepperoni chips took 2-3 times as long to get crispy but both were delish!
