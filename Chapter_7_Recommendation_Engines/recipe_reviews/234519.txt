I used sesame oil instead of olive. I'm not sure this would have been more than a four but I added coarsely chopped pistachio nuts to this and that did it. I changed the proportions for two servings, using 1/2 each of an avocado, lemon and a mango and 1/4 c. of cilantro and green onion. Yummy. Thanks for this recipe.

I made 1/2 the recipe but added a can of rinsed black beans. Made the full amount of dressing and added about 2/3 of it to the salad
