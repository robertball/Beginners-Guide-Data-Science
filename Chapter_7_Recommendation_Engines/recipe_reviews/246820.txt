I scaled the recipe down to 8 servings and made half of the recipe. The color is a deep yellow and I guess that's because of the added egg yolk. Tasty but  a bit too sweet for me. I prefer my curd made with regular lemons instead of the slightly less tangy Meyer lemons.

This recipe was easy to follow, and the results were delicious.  It definitely appeared clotted when the mixture was added to the saucepan, but it smoothed out nicely once heated. Be aware, it makes quite a large batch.

I made half the recipe and used regular lemons. It did curdle while mixing, but came together when cooking. Love the taste, but the consistency was a bit grainy.
