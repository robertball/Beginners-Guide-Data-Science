Aside from the grammatically incorrect name, these were okay.  I agree that the number of servings was off for us.  And as my Scottish grandmother would say .. "Scotch is a drink, those from Scotland are Scottish!"

This recipe states that it makes 36 cookies.  I only got 15 cookies out of it.  So, make sure you are careful, it also depends on how large you want your cookies to be.

Scotch is an adjective meaning "of Scotland". In Scotland the modern usage in Scotland is Scottish or Scots, and the word "Scotch" is only applied to specific products, mostly food or drink, such as Scotch whisky, Scotch pie, Scotch broth, and Scotch eggs.

Grammar lesson over. These are very good Shortbread (biscuits in most of europe) and are very traditional, tho many people have their idea of what shortbread should be...

Traditional shortbread was made from just 3 ingredients, (flour, Butter, and Sugar) and should be dry and crumbly. The cooling process hardens them up but I find that putting them in a coffee can lined with paper towels for a week or two makes them "finish" to become a delicious treat.

these were nice and fairly easy. there are so many different ways to make these i'll have to try a few different kinds to figure out what i like best. i did try one batch on a pizza stone and the other on a reg cookie sheet and the cookie sheet worked better in my opinion.

I'm a very new cook, having only moved out of my parents' house two months ago, and this is my first attempt at baking from scratch, rather than from a just-add-water mix.  Not only was the recipe easy to follow, but it was also quick and low maintenance, so I could mix and bake the cookies while doing something else.  I made 73 cookies out of this recipe, but maybe my cookies are smaller than some people's.  Mine are triangles a smidgen smaller than, say, chips ahoy cookies.  I also made a simple glaze out of lemon juice, water, and sugar, and dipped my cookies in that.  It was amazing!  The only problem is that I have way too many of these rich, fluffy little cookies to eat all by my self!

I made these with Irish butter! I scooped them with a cookie scoop and then made an indent which I filled with lemon curd. They were melt in your mouth yummy and the butter and lemon curd complimented one another very nicely! Sooo good!
