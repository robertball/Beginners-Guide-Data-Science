Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have citric acid powder so I substituted the juice of 1/2 a lemon. They were flavorful, tender, and disappeared faster then you could say breakfast.

These taste just like the best blini I've enjoyed in Ukraine. I like them best Ukrainian style, filled with red caviar and rolled cigar-shaped. Also delightful filled with salt-cured or smoked salmon and a dab of sour cream, garnished with fresh dill. Any fresh or smoked fish is good in blini. Rolled or folded around any kind of fish spread is delightful. And of course, the best of all is black caviar such as ossetra or beluga, and served with icy cold vodka as a snack or appetizer. Crumbled Bulgarian feta and chopped fresh dill is a tasty budget filling. Like other reviewers, I've used lemon juice in them. I strongly object to substituting oil for butter, reducing the amount of butter, or using any kind of reduced fat milk, which affects the flavor negatively. If you want to taste Eastern Europe when you eat them, follow the directions exactly.

These were delicious and fun to serve to guests.  I served them with hot cooked apples with cinnamon and ~1 T. of cream cheese mixed in per 1 cup of apples.  Also had maple syrup and strawberry syrup and whipped cream at the table.  I taught the houseguests how to fold the blini for fun, and then everyone ate them however they wanted--folded, rolled, flat.....whatever.  Delicious.

Great taste, but yielded over 100 blinis and it took me over two hours to cook (prep time was quick, but cooking over 100 blinis was exhausting becuase you cannot look away even for a second).
I made the following cahnges to lower the amount of fat and calories:1% milk instead of regular, and I did not use any butter at all as I made them on VillaWare Crepe Maker that has a non-stick coating that requires no butter or cooking spray at all. Also, very importantly, instead of adding 1/8 citric acid powder I added a few drops of fresh lemon juice into the spoon with baking soda before adding it in just enough for the soda to bubble up - to eliminate the baking soda taste.

I live in Russia, and I've tried many blini recipes from Russian websites. Maybe I'm just bad with grams and ml, but none of those recipes turned out as good as this one!! I halved the recipe (only 2 eggs), and added a little extra water. I used a tiny bit of vinegar instead of the citric acid. Russian boyfriend approves!! Thank you!! We're ready for Maslenitsa tomorrow :) Absolutely delicious!!

I used veg oil instead of butter to fry them in. Just enough to lightly cover the bottom of the pan. Buttering each final blin is a good idea to keep them from drying out on the edges. Yes this recipe produces a TON of blini, but they disappear quickly too. Lemon juice instead of citric acid powder works well, and I felt that the sugar and salt amounts could have been doubled. They tasted under seasoned to me. I will make these again next time they will come out perfect.  Serve them in true Russian fashion with honey or jam and sour cream, or caviar.

This recipe is great! Better and easier than crepes. I have been using it for a year and a half now, but a few months ago I just simplified it after seeing other recipes on the internet. Now I just use 1c flour, 1/2 T sugar, pinch salt for dry, and 1 egg, 1T oil, and 1 1/4c milk for wet. The results are identical ! They are also almost the same with water, if out of milk (which is not weird; bread can have either). Mixing is also easier by adding half of the milk to the whisked egg & oil, then all of the dry, mix until smooth paste, then slowly add rest of liquid, to avoid clumps. Rest about 10-20mins. I use my 8in cast iron, brushed  with oil between each, and with 1/3c portions, this makes about 7 blini.

These are perfect!  If your looking for that spongy texture that Russian blini should be - here you go.  I personally like adding a tsp. of vanilla or almond and then spreading it with some Nutella then wrapping it around a banana like they do for street food in Ukraine.  Delicious.

Really good! I made it for my family of 3 so I adjusted the serving to 2 and it turned out great! I put sprinkles on some with Nutella and bananas inside and on my husbands I put peach jam and bananas inside!  And I didn't have citric acid powder so I added orange juice instead. Adjusting it to 2 servings made 4, 12" blinis which was plenty for us. And for the (1 1/4) egg I just used a really big egg from our chickens and it worked fine! These would be really good with sausage, eggs, cheese and maple syrup inside too! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My boyfriend is from Russia and made me these one day but using his recipe. They were greasy and not very good. I decided to try this recipe and I loved them! I haven't figured out how to tell him I can make Russian pancakes better than him yet lol.

These were fantastic! I was really nervous about making them, but they turned out great.  I ended up taking a stick of butter and brushing the pan after each blini.  These taste like crepes to me, so not sure what the difference is except the country of origin : )  I made a blueberry sauce to go inside and sprinkled some powdered sugar.  I halved the recipe for our family of 4 and it was perfect.

Love this recipe! Have already made it twice in the last month. Once with a ground meat stuffing and the other time with a cheese stuffing. The blini were perfectly fluffy and tasted like my moms (who is Russian/Ukrainian). 
In addition to subbing lemon for citric acid, I more than doubled the amount of sugar this recipe called for, using 5 tablespoons total. But that just might be me that I like slightly sweeter blini even when used for a savory recipe. I used a smaller ladle (more oval than round) in order to keep the blini relatively thin. This made about 30 or so blini, just like the recipe states.

These are basically crepes. Every ethnic group in Europe has similar and each with slightly different names. I'm an American of Slovak decent...we call them Palacinka. The only thing I don't do is add boiling water. By the way...they are AWESOME!

It was bland and tasted doughy. The quantity was also gargantuan so if you do make it, consider cutting the recipe in half.

These were pretty good! Unlike most regular crepes the first one came out just fine! I filled these with sour cream, fresh dill, fresh ground black pepper, and smoked salmon.

It came out great!  I didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder instead,  and I didn't use the citric acid. I also added 8x the sugar to give it that sweet taste.

Easy to make, I'm a beginner and these turned out great on my first try.
I made everything 2/5 of the quantities here (e.g. 2 eggs), and didn't put the citric acid. Got about 12 blinis.

I'm Russian and this is the best recipe I've tried! Made it twice over since I first tried it. Kiddos love the thin little bintzes. I would add some powdered vanilla and I eyeballed the salt and sugar, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Instead of citric whatever, I squeezed a bit of lemon into the mix. This is a big batch! I make the batter on a weekend, cook all the blini I can and pour the rest into a container and use it to make them every morning for the rest of the week :) I also tried all the pans I had and the iron skillet worked best to make the thin blini with holes that I'm used to. Also, with an iron skillet, you don't really need too much butter except on the first few blintzes. Happy cooking! Thanks for the recipe!
