I omitted the red pepper and the jalapeño because there were Rotel tomatoes in the recipe. I am a heat wimp. However, my husband added the red pepper and the chopped jalapeño to his bowls. I put two large chicken breasts in the bottom of the slow cooker and shredded them as was suggested. This was a delicious chicken chili that I will definitely make again.
