This is a staple for us on Festive Occassions.  And a hit at parties.  We double the recipe and do two large platters.  Rather than using canned shrimp we purchase fresh shrimp and finely chop it.  We also add one can of flaked crab meat. The whole thing is finished with mozza and we add lots extra.  This dish tastes best after it has been refrigerated.  When we serve it we use the mini round tortilla chips.  Individual size for dipping.  It never lasts.

An excellent recipe, the addition of mozza cheese and the combination of mayo/sour cream really added to an old Christmas recipe.   Lack of ingredients prevents me from reviewing most recipes. I used the only cocktail sauce available, in town, mild.

Good flavor but consistency a little soft. Next time I will cut the mayo and sour cream in half. I served the shrimp on the side because I have friends that don't like shrimp, and it worked out great as a build-your-own cracker topper.

Some people also call it surprise dip and leave out the shrimp

~~ This one is a TRUE WINNER. I have been making this for years. I use Miracle whip, instead of mayo (more tangy) and cheddar cheese, or marble. (I will have to try with mozzarella. The only other things I do diffrent is, I use 1/2 cup sour cream (instead if 1/4)and 1/4 cup of miracle whip (instead of 1/2 cup of mayonnaise) I also chill in the fridge for a couple of hrs. before serving. ** THIS IS A 5 STAR DISH ** (I would add more stars, but it won't let me) I wish I had a pic. to add. ~~  ENJOY.

Easy and delicious!  Like others and as personal preferences: Used Miracle Whip, cooked my own shrimp and no peppers.  Had chives in my garden so used those as well.  Made it for a party last night and was asked for the recipe and my husband is still raving about it.

Great app to bring to a party. I used fresh shrimp and made two batches. First batch i followed the recipes exactly. I made a second batch Mexican style and simply substituted our favorite salsa for the cocktail sauce and swapped shredded Mexican cheese blend for the mozzarella. Finally topped with diced a fresh jalape√±o and some cilantro. Both styles were a hit at the party.

Everyone loves this dip!  When I made it I added a 4 oz can of lump crab meat to the cream cheese layer along with 3/4 tsp of prepared horseradish.  I also omitted the bell pepper as I didn't have one on hand.  Lastly, I made it a day ahead to let the flavors blend.

I've been making this recipe for years. The only change I make is that I always use thawed shrimp and not ones from a can. It is always everyone's favourite at parties and I am not always asked to bring it at every get together. It's also great the next day, if you ever have any leftover!

Made this for new years eve and it was a huge hit.I feel guilty reviewing this as I did change a few things for personal preference and what I had on hand, but I'm sure it would be delicious as is. I did use miracle whip (I don't even buy regular mago anymore), omitted green pepper (not a fan), used regular frozen shrimp thawed and chopped, and added canned crab. Adding the canned crab was definitely a good idea.

This is an awesome dip....big winner every time I use it!  Create a little ahead of time and the consistency is just fine!
