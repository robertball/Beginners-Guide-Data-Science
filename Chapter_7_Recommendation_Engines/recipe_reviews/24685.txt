These were really great!!  I did do a few changes though...first was the addition of bacon.  I fried and crumbled a pound of bacon and added it to the mixture.  I also added an additional tsp of Worcestershire sauce and when they were all done, melted some additional blue cheese crumbles on top.  My family (including 2 really picky son-in-laws and one realll picky daughter)all LOVED them. They are definitaly going to be on the menu again and again here.  I also recommend you use an 80/20 ground beef.  You do need some fat in these for flavor. Try them....if you like the tang of blue cheese, you will love these and if you aren't worried about the calories...go for the bacon addition!

Very good. I wanted to try this exactly by the recipe to fairly evaluate as written but I must admit I added a little bit of minced garlic and used more bleu cheese because I love the taste of it. I was very pleased with this recipe.

Great burgers. Made this for a Father's Day dinner for my husband and his best friend. They each had two. Raves from everyone. I was expecting a very different taste. Excellent recipe. Will make again and again. Served with corn on the cob with a herbed butter and a grilled potato and green onion salad served on top of mixed greens with a blue cheese vinigarette. Did increase the blue cheese to four ounces for six burgers; also increased the sauces.

Great recipe. Tasted even better then it sounded. I would suggest changing the hot sauce to the new Tosbasco Chipotle sauce. It is amazing. Also next time I will try blending the gound beef half and half with ground pork! P.S. use less salt as the cheese is generally salty on its own.

I do not like blue cheese even a little, however, these are FANTASTIC! No more boring burgers in this house again! The flavor is just perfect, I didn't like the smell of the blue cheese while I mixed it in, and did it quick so nobody would see, and everybody loved them except my daughter,she LIKED these the best of all beef burgers, she normally eats veggie burgers only!

Super good! I added more blue cheese and only used about 2 lbs of beef. Very moist and the blue cheese/chives really stood out. (I thought the flavors would get lost inside the burgers.) These will be a standard... I've made them twice already. Try them!

Excellent burgers!  I saw something like this on Food Network and had forgotten about it.  A must is the sauteed onion and mushrooms... Next time I'm going to try this with ground turkey and feta, the possibilities are endless!

I am not sure if there is an easier way to make this, perhaps I am not making my patties thick enough because the blue cheese always oozes all over.  However, this is a recipe worth perfecting, very yummy.

These were good.  I was a little annoyed at the blue cheese dripping all over the grill but it was worth it once I tasted the burger.

Not sure if anyone needs any more confirmation after all the other rave reviews but for the record - these are FAB! I used half beef and half veal mince. I also forgot to get chives so used fine chopped red onion instead. I saw a few comments that the cheese melts and dribbles out but I microwaved the cheese really quickly until it was only just soft and then stirred it through the mince. This made the flavour go all the way through and stopped the cheese ending up all over the bbq plate.

I've been making Blue Burgers for a few years now and in my opinion 4 oz. of Blue Cheese is not near enough for 3lbs of meat.  I usually use 4oz. per pound and I use 80/20 beef for juicier burgers.  Lastly I top then with "buffalo onions" (grilled vidalia onion slices coated in wing sauce.

I loved it. The only reason it is getting 4 is because I think this needs an egg. Mine fell apart when cooking but I did salvage it and it was so worth the salvaging...also I increased the hot sauce to 1 tbsp for only 2 burgers in total - it made it a buffalo/blue cheese burger - YUM! And definitely even better with caramelized onions on top.

These were AWESOME!!!  Like some of the other reviewers, I made a few changes...1st I omitted the hamburger and a few other ingredients.  Then I used sourdough bread and put a couple of slices of American cheese between the bread.  Next I grilled the burger (minus the burger) in a frying pan with melted butter.  Mmmmm...UNbelievable...these were the best ever!!!

I've made this one several times now, and always get raves reviews. To suit my own personal taste, I use only two pounds of lean ground beef, keeping all the other amounts the same. Last night, I didn't have any blue cheese, so I substituted feta cheese. Those were some really good burgers, too.

I made these for house guests and they turned out great.  I followed the recipe very close this time but might increase the blue cheese & hot sauce next time for increased intensity.  Excellent burgers.

These were a nice change from your every day burger. I do not care for blue cheese so I made an additional small batch for myself leaving the blue cheese out but it turns out I liked the ones with the cheese much better. I made as written and didn't have any problems grilling whatsoever. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe!I loved the fact that the blue cheese was mixed in instead of being put just on top of the burger. I used about twice the amount of blue cheese (I made the burgers bigger) and added a healthy tablespoon or two of minced garlic. Since it was raining, I cooked them on the stove which made it easier to control the heat and therfore less of the cheese melted out. I even toasted the buns in the same pan that the burgers were cooked in. Not healthy but OH MY GOODNESS was it tasty. Next time I'll try the suggestion about adding bacon. YUM!

We love these! I always add chopped, cooked bacon and it really adds a lot of flavor. I also use a little minced red onion instead of the chives because I sometimes cant always find chives at my store, so the red onion works well.  Green onion would be good, too. These are so, so yummy! A keeper!

LOVED THIS!  I'm not even a big burger fan, I don't think I've ever even made a burger because why bother.  This was excellent.  I probably used more worshester than it called for because I use more in everything and I fried in a pan for sliders but loved loved this so much - it's already in a permanent rotation. Thanks!

These burgers are outstanding. I follow the recipe exactly except for the blue cheese measurement, which I double. Everyone loves these. My husband's friends love these so much, that when they go away on one of their many "mancations", they always ask me to make some burgers for them to take along. I make the recipe (with the extra blue cheese), make the patties, refrigerate for at least two hours, then freeze them until needed. I usually take them out of the freezer the night before so that they can thaw during the day. Don't forget to bring them out of the fridge about 20 mins before grilling them so that the burgers cook more evenly and don't burn on the outside. ENJOY!!

This is the best burger I have ever eaten.  I watched an episode of "How I met your Mother" the other night about the best burger place in town.  Now it is my house.  It was full of flavor, texture and tang.  It doesn't get any better then this.

Excellent! The only thing I did different was I mixed all the ingredients together except the blue cheese & then I "stuffed" the blue cheese in the middle of each burger. (keeps more of the cheese inside)

My husband and I liked these. I made them exactly as directed. I also stirred a little blue cheese into some mayo and we spread that on the buns to further increase the blue cheese flavour. Topped with lettuce and thin-sliced tomato. Very tasty. Thank you.

Wow. I made these burgers for my wife and I for our Memorial Day barbecue. The burgers were juicy and almost every bite featured blue cheese at almost every bite. I substituted green onion for the chives. Outstanding! I will make these again. Five stars!

WOW! This is Fantastic. Instead of putting the blue cheese on top, it's mixed into the patty. It has just the perfect amount of bite to it.

Of course, I love blue cheese so why not? I did do slight modifying...1 lb lean ground beef with 1 lb ground turkey. I used minced green onions as I didn't have chives (1/3 C) but mainly stuck with the rest of the recipe.  I doubled the blue cheese and dared to serve some to a few teenagers as well. These were a hit even though I used a pre-made frozen batch. Not a burger left!  This is now the way I prepare burgers when I have the blue cheese on hand. Quite a simple and easy way to have a less boring burger.  Thanks!  An additional note - I added 1/4 C chopped Jalepenos another time and if you like things with a kick, this is the way to go.  Not the pickled jalepenos. Either mince a fresh one or buy the small can without vinegar  Yum!

It was very good. The blue cheese gives it a nice different taste. I suggest trying it.

Excellent!! Used only two pounds of lean ground beef. Didn't have fresh chives so used 1/4 cup of dried. Also added a little more hot sauce and worcestershire to spice it up. If you love blue cheese this recipe is for you!

They were pretty good, but I did find them a little dry. Normally I add one slice of country bread (crust removed), mashed with 2 tbs of whole milk, to create moisture (like you would with meatballs). The seasoning was good though. Next time, Ill add the bread to create more moisture. As a side though, my husband didnt find them dry, but Im a little more perfectionistic with food.

This is an outstanding burger!  So moist, so flavorful.  I added more blue cheese, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and dry mustard powder.  The hot sauce gave the burgers a little "zing" without overpowering it.  And the blue cheese flavor was subtle but noticeable.  We will be having these burgers again and again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe, Quiksmyle!

I do low carb, so I am always looking for new ideas.... These are fabulous!  I only used 2 lbs of ground beef, and kept the other ingredients the same.  It netted 6 good sized burgers, and the flavor was awesome.  I pan fried these, as it was raining, and though I advise to make sure to spray a non-stick pan with cooking spray, as they will stick, it gave me some good old juicy goo to top the burger with.

These burgers are delicious and I appreciated not having to melt cheese ontop since the cheesy goodness was already mixed in. The Blue cheese flavor does not overwhelm them  so even those who wouldn't choose Blue cheese on a salad found these burgers very tasty.

Very good.  I agree that the blue cheese flavor is very mild, though, so I'd recommend putting more on top if you want a more pronounced taste.  I served mine with caramelized red onions and sauted mushrooms.  Grilled over medium heat for five minutes per side.

Havent had the burgers yet...freezing them until the weekend. But, I wanted to add a helpful suggestion. I used a standard sized ice cream scoop to make the burgers. I did 2 leveled scoops of meat per burger, which yielded 11 perfect sized burgers!

Oh sooooo good. I really wanted this recipe for myself, as my husband doesn't like cheese on or in his burger and my kids don't like blue cheese. So, they ate their burgers with just the spices and I had my hubby put a slice of blue cheese on the inside of my burger. The cheese just oozed out when I took that first delicious bite! Thanks!

Oh YUM! I divided recipe in 4 to make 2 burgers with a total of 3/4 lbs turkey.  I omitted chives & black pepper and these were delicious!  We enjoyed with a slice of "farmer's cheese."  These were very cheesy by far and not even in a "blue cheese" sort of way.  I will be making these again!!

I scaled down the recipe to 4 servings. As I was preparing it, the seasonings didn't look enough so I doubled Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, and dry mustard. I kept the blue cheese and chives the same. I also added an egg, a couple tbsp of bread crumb and some milk to hold the burger together. They were really tasty, and if I had made them as written we would have found them pretty bland.

these are aaamazing burgers! thanks for the great recipe, this one's a keeper!

edit - I have made these as burgers lots of times, but the last time I made them, I made a few burgers for lunch, had left over meat so I made them into MEATBALLS and we had them the next night for dinner. added a egg and a bit of italian breadcrumbs so they would hold a bit better as meatballs, and fried them in the frying pan. served over linguine, a quality spag. sauce, garlic bread and salad. very tasty as meatballs!

I'm a young guy who just graduated from school and is learning to cook real food for the first time. This was my first attempt at a homemade burger. This burger was one of the best burgers i've ever had...on my first try. I cant imagine how good it could get with practice.

These turned out awesome! Thanks to QUIKSMYLE I looked like a pro! After cooking these several times ~ once with only a few hours marinating time and then again after letting them sit overnight, I have to say that it is well worth the time to let them sit. They were much better after marinating overnight.

Pretty good.  Be sure to finely crumble the cheese, or it will melt and stick to the grill=(  I tried to make mini burgers using this recipe...not a good idea theres too many things and they turned out too crumbly.  Still, very tasty=)

I have made this recipe twice now, and my husbands keeps requesting that I make it again.  These burgers are delicious!  I gave it 4 stars only because I increased the amounts of many of the seasonings, especially the bleu cheese, to make them a little more flavorful.  Also, we found it easiest to grill them if we lay aluminum foil on the grills and cook the burgers on top.  This helps prevent constant flare-ups and charring.

Let me just say, I HATE blue cheese, but my husband loves it, so I decided to make these for him. Boy was I surprised when I tried them. Somehow it works really well.  Even my 3yo ate a burger, and she is picky. The BC was not overpowering for me or for any of my children, which was a nice surprise. Blends nicely. Really good burgers.  Thanks!!

My husband said these were now his favorite burgers!  I used 2 lbs meat with 4 oz blue cheese and I thought it was perfect.  I toasted the buns and topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion and avocado with salt and pepper.  Oh yea, and some mayo...YUM.

I scaled this down to a serving size of 4, and added a splash more Worcestershire.  I also came home on my lunch and threw mixed the ingredients together.  It then sat in the refrigerator for approx. 5 hours.  The burgers were great!  I bought 80/20 angus and it seemed to work well.  My wife, NOT a fan of bleu cheese, ate 2 burgers!  (She really only got one bite with a lot of bleu cheese...other than that she said it was spaced out well).  Recommended!

We thought these were great!  The only thing I would change is the temp of the grill.  High is too hot and can cause the burgers to burn.  We kept it at medium and they were perfect.  We also melted more blue cheese on top right before they came off the grill and used a little Heinz 57 to dress them.  Delicious!

Rave reviews from family/friends!!!  Replaced salt/pepper with Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Doubled all ingredients except the beef.  Added fresh garlic.  Put on onion roll.  Perfecto!  Thanks for sharing.

I thought these would be really good, and they were good, just not great.  I used a very good brand of blue cheese (Rosenborg) and I couldn't really taste it as much as I would have liked.  I couldn't taste the chives either.  Granted, I had to cook them on the stove because our grill sucks.  I did make the whole batch, and we only ate 4 of them, so I froze the rest...maybe they'll be good after being frozen for a while.  My husband doesn't like blue cheese, so I divided the meat in half and added blue cheese to my half, shredded mozzarella and parmesan to his.  I didn't taste any of the mozz/parm ones, but hubby said they were a 4.****After a month in the freezer, I cooked some of these up yesterday.  They were SO much better!  A 4.5 after being frozen.  All the flavors were intensified, and I could taste the blue cheese and chives very well.

These ARE the best burgers! I do add larger quantities of seasonings listed (esp. blue cheese), but they are excellent! We ate them all summer long. I usually make a large batch, let them sit in the fridge for a few hours and then freeze the extra patties for next time - we love these!

There is no doubt that these burgers are MUCH better than regular ones, but I've even added twice the amount of blue cheese, and still can't taste the blue cheese flavor. All your guests and family, will appreciate the extra special ingredients in these burgers!  Wow - YES!  Do it!

My boyfriend and I love blue cheese, and other than the recipe stating to make these at least 2 hours before cooking, it's a easy and great recipe.  Also, we don't always let them sit for 2 hours, and just mix the stuff up and cook them and they are still great.

My husband prepared this as a main course meat dish, no buns.  He used ground Caribou meat which is very lean.  It was absolutely awesome!  The combination of game meat and blue cheese made for an elegant gourmet presentation. A definite keeper!

I forgot to let the mixture set for 3 hours as recommended and the burgers still turned out super. Such a different taste! Of course my kids turned up their nose at blue cheese, but it's great for us adults! Thanks Poni!

I LOVE blue cheese, so I loved this recipe.  I only used 1 pd. of ground beef, but used the same amount of blue cheese.  I just cut back on the other ingredients because they were too hard to cut into thirds. I will definitely make again!

My husband and I loved these burgers!  We usually just serve plain burgers with melted blue cheese on top.  The blue cheese flavor actually in the burgers was terrific!  We still melted a little cheese to top the burgers!  Great recipe even though my kids didn't appreciate it!

DELICIOUS. It makes way more than 12 if you make the burgers thin (and I do because it cooks faster). I added a few splashes more of Worcestershire though, right over the meat so it kind of marinated while in the fridge. I think next time I'm gonna add more worcestershire to give it more flavor. I highly advise you to pack the blue cheese in the center of the burgers, so after cooked, it melts right out.

We used gorgonzola  that we had on hand because we like a stronger blue cheese flavor.  Form the burgers lightly.  Don't overwork the meat.  To maximize the flavors, don't grill till they are well done.  Pick a temp that allows some pink in the middle down to med rare, which we like best.  A great year-round grilling option, with saute Vidalia onions on top.

Dynamite!!! I LOVE these burgers. They have the best taste of a bleu cheese burger I have found. I even use the recipe (minus the bleu cheese) for my other burger recipes as well. I make these about every two weeks. Just wonderful. I don't change anything in the recipe. Just wanted to add that it DOES make a difference in what kind of bleu cheese you buy. Spanish is the BEST. I have made used this exact recipe over 40 times now and just LOVE it!!

The only thing I do differently is, I leave out the blue cheese until I form the patties.  Then I put the blue cheese in the middle.  I use a patty press, but I'm sure you could do it by hand. Put some ground beef in then blue cheese then more beef and press.  This way the blue cheese stays inside the burger and gets nice and soft but doesn't drip all over the grill and make a big mess.   I make a bunch and wrap in platic wrap and keep in the freezer.

Nice recipe for burgers. Be careful not to overcook on the BBQ however like we did or like most meats, you dry them out. Flavor is wonderful and made me look like a gourmet chef. Thank you.

We're pretty much burger purists who prefer straight up grilled ground beef for our burgers, but I thought I'd give this a whirl to mix things up a bit and I'm glad I did.  The blue cheese adds a nice creaminess, for lack of better word, to the burgers.  Nothing overwhelmed the beef flavor, but complimented it.  I followed the recipe ingredients as written, with about two pounds of beef instead of three (and left everything else the same).  I had to sub dried for fresh chives and chose to leave out the black pepper per personal preference.  THANKS for the recipe, QUIKSMYLE!

Great recipe!  Changes I made: added finely chopped jalapeno for some extra spice, about 1/4 c onion bc I ran out of chives, used reg yellow mustard bc out of dry, added 1 egg, splash of milk and some bread crumbs (maybe 1/4 c).  Like others suggested, I put foil on grill to keep melted cheese off the coals.  Near the end I added thick slices of blue cheese on top to melt.  This gave it the flavor I was looking for.  Without the cheese on top it wouldn't have had the strong flavor we personally like.  The contrast between the jalapeno and blue cheese was killer!  Thanks

I made these for a BBQ with some friends and they absolutely loved them.  I threw in about a handful of chopped up Jalapenos for some spice and you can bet I will be making these again.

Just didn't think these were all that great. I made half my burgers this way - and half w/ out blue cheese for my kids - I honestly couldn't tell which ones had the blue cheese in them. Nothing special. Won't make again.

Absolutely fantastic.  Top with additional blue cheese for the flavor explosion.  You will not need ketchup of mustard (shame).

Yum! I love it. I use turkey instead of beef. It is drier but to offset that I put a little more sauce into the meat mixture, such as Worcestershire Sauce and add a little oil to the pan. I also make up a mayo or sour cream with Chiptolte sauce to put on the bun and on the burger. Its delicious! I've already made this a couple of time and will definitely be making it again!

The recipe was good, my girlfriend and I both enjoy blue cheese burgers, but have not had a burger constructed like this. The first initial bite was a bit consumed with the flavor of the chives. I think it was a bit much. Also the blue cheese inside the burger is good, but not quite enough, I believe I will melt more on top if I try these again. The burger is good but not spectacular.

These were perfection! I only used half an egg, and let the meat sit for about an hour in the fridge. The bacon wasnt super crispy, but I was using an indoor grill. So after the burgers cooked I flipped them on their sides and made sure the bacon was cooked all the way.

Tasty!  I added more gorgonzola to my burger, and just some to Joe's.  Added 2 slices bacon to meat.  More worcestershire.  Sauteed onions and tomato slice on a keiser bun - YUUUUM!

Fantastic!  I can not believe my picky family not only ate these but LOVED them!  I didn't have chives or dry mustard so I just used dried minced onions and spicy mustard.  This is our new hamburger for the grill! I did what someone else recommended and added a few tablespoons of oatmeal and 1 TB of milk just  to help retain moisture.  Wonderful, juicy burgers!

These were good, but did not have as much flavor as I expected.  I will add more seasoning next time, but this is a good basic recipe.

I was so disappointed with how these turned out.  I've made many burger recipes from allrecipes that were amazing.  This recipe just didn't deliver.  I used really expensive blue cheese from a local cheese shop and didn't taste it one bit in the burgers.  And the burgers were REALLY dry.  I will not be making again.  What I will do next time is use another burger recipe from here and put the good blue cheese on top.

I have made a recipe similar to this but the flavors of this one are better. I add more of the sauces for a little more spice. Also, to prevent the blue cheese from flaming on the grill I dont mix it with the meat. Instead I take two small burgers and put them together with the blue cheese in the middle. Excellent!

Very good moist burgers!  I only used 2 pounds of hamburger with the 4 oz blue cheese, and think I would use more blue cheese next time.  Threw in a couple cloves of garlic as well.  I sauteed some onions and mushrooms as toppings.  Will make again!

I have made these burgers several times over the summer and each time they have been a huge hit.  My husband says that they are the best burgers he ever had outside of a restuarant.  Everyone who has tried them has asked for the recipe.  I typically use a bit extra cheese in the mix and I use a Gorgonzola picante.

I used gorgonzola and this came out great.  Really really well flavored.  I started using scallions instead of chives because I hate buying a whole pack of chives to use a few pieces, and I thought that the chives were overpowering the flavor.  Doubled the Worcestershire and hot sauces (I used Cholula and still thought I couldn't taste anything - might try a smokier hot sauce next time).  Love these burgers!

Good! This recipe is good because the flavor of the bleu cheese is definitely there but it doesn't overpower the burger. I also put a little bit of egg in the ground meat mixture to help keep the burger in one piece as it grilled.

I made these today.  I was very excited about upscaling burgers on the grill, and I still am.  I (charcoal) grilled them for 5 minutes each side, and that was too long (I suck at grilling).  While they were cooking, I could see the bleu cheese oozing out of them - delish, but I didn't want them to be raw in the center.  I doubled the bleu cheese and no one could detect the cheese flavor.  To make matters worse, two major supermarkets did not have fresh chives, so I had to use dried.  Therefore, I am rating this recipe a 4 until all my ducks are in a row.  I will do these again, and will update my review.  I am certain that with fresh chives and grill training, they will be superb.

Very good!  I will probably never make regular burgers again.  Next time I will add more cheese.  Maybe try it with cheddar.

I really liked these.  The husband didn't.  That's the only reason I'm not giving these 5 stars.  The blue cheese was excellent grilled in the meat - wonderful flavor, very juicy.  I'll be sure to make a plain, boring patty for the hubby next time I prepare these for myself!

Yummy! These are wonderful! I didn't make any changes except for adding a bit extra blue cheese. I froze half and when we ate them a couple of weeks later they were even better so I recommend making in advance if possible. You don't need to freeze them, but a day in the frig should improve the already wonderful taste. Update: The 2nd time I had to cook them on my George Foreman grill. A whole lot of juices and melted cheese gathered in the drip tray. Hating to see all that flavor go to waste, I added it to some mushrooms sautéing. This mixture was great on top of the burgers.

This was very good. Not outstanding, but very good.

Next time I'll cut down a bit on the pepper, which overpowered the blue cheese. And maybe add a little more blue cheese.

To be fair, I'm rating this as though it had come out medium (as we'd have preferred), rather than well. I made it on my George Foreman at 360 degrees for 6 minutes, and it was about two minutes to much. Still, it was quite tasty, and next time I'll broil or pan fry, if I don't use the GF grill.

I recommend this; my husband isn't even much of a blue cheese fan, and he thought this was great (tho overcooked by my error).

Thanks!

WOW!! I will never fix any other burger but this!! I increased the blue cheese since I love it.  They are so moist and flavorful that you don't really need any toppings!

Very Good.  I used prepared mustard instead of dry and green onions instead of chives.  I will make these again!

My husband loves blue cheese as much as I dislike it. I wan't looking forward to this (for me) but surprisingly I really enjoyed it, too. Our guests asked for the recipe before they were done with dinner.

We've made these several times now.  We've made it exactly, but usually substitute chopped onion for the chives, increase the Worchestershire (to 1 tablespoon per pound of beef) and omit the salt.  When we don't want to bother with the grill, these work well cooked in the broiler, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I must admit I was skeptical, but they were absolutely wonderful! We really didn't find the blue cheese to overpower, but it was a mild, pleasant infusion! These are really good! I did not alter the recipe at all, and used finely ground blue cheese. I'm a believer!! I will make up some extra's next time!

I added extra blue cheese and a bit more of the spice/sauce mixture, and these were a HUGE hit with the family.  even the leftovers were gone by the next evening.

Grilled these last night as was so pleased!  Next time I will add about 1/4-1/2 more of the cheese/sauce/spices and give them the full 4 hours of marinating time.  Wonderful burgers!!!

My boyfriend and I were both very skeptical about these since they had blue cheese in them, but they were SOOOOOO wonderful!  They were just like something we would've gotten from TGI Friday's, or Ruby Tuesday's, or another popular restaurant!  We'll definitely have these again!

This recipe was very easy. My husband loves blue cheese and he really like these burgers. I just didn't have the time to let the meat sit with the cheese in the fridge but they still turned out really good. My kids thought they were pretty good also.

I made them one night for my family, and then for the next big barbeque bash the next night!  Everyone raved.....and even my five year old loved them!
The blue cheese taste isn't overpowering, even with the extra i tossed in...it just adds a yummy kick!

These are very tasty.  But to be honest, it wasn't drastically different than any other burger you would make at home if you are adding spices.  The blue cheese provided a nice change.  I also put some blue cheese on top at the end and let it melt.

Several years ago, I had my first blue cheese burger at a big-timber restaurant in Seattle, Wa. Being very hungry that day, I decided upon this type burger and was hooked by its' lusicious flavors. This is a wonderful recipe and brought me back there. I added crisp bacon on top. Was a perfect burger to celebrate the 4th with. Thanks!

This is so yummy! I put it with sauteed mushrooms, cheese, bacon, and ranch dressing and LOVED it. You can put some hot sauce in at the end if some people don't want it spicy. This will be my go to burger for a while.

Loved these burgers!  Refrigerating the meat not only helped to blend the flavors but also firmed up the meat so that it didn't fall apart on the grill.

Found this in the AR Magazine - since I had ground beef and blue cheese on hand decided to try it - delicious. Was pleasantly surprised that the cheese didn't leak out. Not a big burger fan usually but have already made this twice.

My Mom made these every summer as far as I know her recipe  just contains an egg to make a difference. I made as is and was it the best burger I ever had, no, but still darn good and got Mom's approval so there you go, a keeper. Thanks!

Fantastic! I added about as much blue cheese again and they were succulent. Tasty and moist.

This recipe was alright, but I didn't love it. We eat blue cheese in my home, but for some reason these burgers did not go over the way I thought they would. I followed the recipe word for word, but still was not impressed with the way they taste.

Great, although a bit too much blue cheese, even for me, a blue cheese lover. Nonetheless, I'd still make it & enjoy it again whether the blue cheese was reduced slightly or not, & whether the other seasonings were increased or not. Green onions were substituted for the chives. I made the burger size to fit perfectly on a crusty French roll, with some sauteed onions. Sauteed cremini mushrooms &/or lettuce would have been suitable on the roll also.

Love this recipe.  I double up the Worcestershire and Hot sauce cause that's how we roll.  I have even cooked these in the oven based on allrecipes burger's in the oven recipe.  These are so good.

I made this for our first night on a camping trip...and they were fantastic. Didn't change a thing except cooked over an open fire. The blue cheese flavor really comes through in this moist burger. You don't even need any condiments except the veggies. I didn't have chives so finely minced some green onions instead...will be making these burgers again and again.

LOVED IT!  I didn't have any green onion on hand so I sub'd a little onion powder.  I also added a little sprinkle of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and butt rub to the burgers prior to grilling.  SUPERB!  Can't wait to serve this to friends!

A huge hit with my boyfriend and I!  I did make a few changes because I didn't have chives or hot pepper sauce on hand.  I also halved the recipe and used 1.25 lbs of beef so if you decide to do what I did, adjust your amounts accordingly.  Instead of chives, I added two diced green onions.  In place of hot pepper sauce, I used a 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper (jarred spice).  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I mixed all of the ingredients together and put in the refrigerator two hours prior to cooking.  When I was ready to start cooking, I mixed in one egg to give it some moisture.  It turned out great!  If I was only cooking for myself, I would cut the red pepper down to 1/4 teaspoon because it was a little hot for me but my boyfriend has told me that I may not change a thing the next time I make them.  I'd say it was a hit!

These were okay. Maybe a little less than okay, actually. No one in my family thought they were gross, but we ate what we had then threw out the leftovers. I will not be making this again.

Husband said these were the best burgers he's ever eaten! I topped the burgers with carmalized onions, yummy! will definately make again. Use a milder blue cheese if you don't care for the taste of stronger ones.

awesome.  I made it for 6 burgers, added in 3 tbs of old fashioned oats too to keep it super juicy.  It was awesome, I did not have any issues with the cheese melting out.

I have made these several times and they always get rave reviews. The first two times I mixed everything together - NOW I make two thin burgers with all the fixings except the cheese - then I put the cheese in the center of one burger and set the other burger on top and pinch the outsides together to make them sandwich like...no more cheese dripping out. It takes more time but well worth it. Thanks Quicksmyle!

LOVED it! I only used about a pound of meat and added the entire contents of the blue cheese package. Thats the only thing I changed. It was really a good burger. I would pay $10 for this at a resturant.

I did not measure, but followed the ingredient list (with the exception of using onion rather than chives).  I stuffed the middles with blue cheese rather than mixing it in.   Very good burgers.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used real Dijon mustard instead of powdered mustard, added some crumbled bacon, and that made all the difference. Rated a 4 because I think it was my additions/changes that really made it better.

I love blue cheese.  So I made this as the recipe states.  I too had blue cheese oozing out onto the grill.  So, I thought, Why not make the burgers with everything but the blue cheese, make the patties thin, put the blue cheese in the middle and top with another thin patty and seal the edges...MY OH MY,,,that with the grilled onions...Oh, I want one right now...Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Well we took the recipe one step farther.  I added the bacon, extra blue cheese, some fresh minced garlic, made the patties almost double in size, added a little tap water to the mix for moisture so the burgers don't get too dry while cooking, and added an over-easy cooked egg.  What messy but very delicious burger!  I also cooked them on my Treager wood pellet grill!  My oh my!! Must be one of the best bugers I have ever tried!  I just don't think you can get this in any resturaunt or fast food joint!!

I changed the recipe a little bit. I used the worcestshire sauce,salt,pepper,garlic powder, and seasoned salt. Then I made two thin patties put the blue cheese on the top of one pattie and top with the other one and then I cooked on my George Foreman grill.Also added fried onions it was delicious my 12year old devoured it onions and all.

Me and my guests thought these were wonderful.  Make sure you use a blue cheese that you would enjoy eating.  There is such a range of flavors (some I can't stand) That may be why some people thought it was so overpowering and some thought it needed more.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, will definately make this again.

I thought these were good, but my hubby, who doesn't like blue cheese, didn't like them.  I think they'd be great with sauteed onions and mushrooms on top!

Great recipe! My favorite for hamburgers on this website! My four year old loved them, he ate two! You have to use fresh chives, maybe green onions to substitute. We will experiment with toppings when making these again! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a superb recipe to use with ground turkey. The additions to the meat yield an incredibly moist, flavorful burger. I found a blue cheese that comes in a wax shell, has an ideal texture that crumbles nicely and distributes extremely well through the meat. Now we never make turkey burgers any other way. Terrific topped with avocado, too!

I made these last night and they were great summer burgers on the grill!  I actually used ground buffalo meat, and doubled the spices, plus threw in some minced garlic and white pepper.  Served them on grilled onion rolls along with sliced red onion, lettuce and tomato...delish!  My husband who isn't a huge bleu cheese fan even raved about the flavor!

I made these for Mother's day and got mixed reviews. Granted, I wasn't in control of the grilling process so that might have contributed to one person thinking they were too dry. I didn't try one until the next day and didn't even realize which burger it was until after a few bites. I absolutely loved it. I topped mine with swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms. I did add more wortchesire sauce and red pepper flakes. Will make these again!!!

These were the best burgers I have made to date.  I was worried about the different flavors (I left out the salt) but they all melded together for a juicy amazing burger.  Thank you for making me look like a pro at the cookout :)

I altered this- I used only a pound of lean ground beef, no chives or Tabasco, 1.5 tsps Worchestershire, 1 tsp dijon mustard, and 4 ounces blue cheese and lots of black pepper.  I thought these were excellent, loved the flavor and very moist.  My husband asked for less blue cheese next time, though.  If you love blue cheese, go for it.

I made this burgers and they where a hit form day one. Now I'm using 3 parts beef one part pork for the ground meat. I'm also adding finely chopped raw bacon, this makes the burgers jucier.
I love them on onion burger buns.

I was really surprised that I wasn't a bigger fan of this recipe, since I absolutely love blue cheese and love black 'n blue burgers.  And I was so excited to make this with fresh jalapenos out of my own garden!  However, I was really disappointed with the results.  One problem definitely was that I didn't seed the jalapenos, so the burgers were WAY too hot and spicy for my taste (only did them that way to please the BF!).  This might be worth making again with a few modifications, but I doubt that I will.

This burger was melt-in-your-mouth good!  My husband and I just loved it.  We followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers and used only 2 lbs. of beef instead of 3, and used 6 oz. of blue cheese instead of 4.  Great suggestions...they turned out so good.  Can't wait to make them again!

Awesome! I had been wanting to try this for a while and I'm glad I did. Followed the recipe exactly and my burgers were moist and delicious. The blue cheese wasn't at all overpowering, which I was somewhat concerned about. I grilled them on my Foreman.

I don't like hamburgers but these were great.  I used twice the amount of cheese and also used garlic among other dashes of spices.  Next time I will use gorganzola.

OUTSTANDING!  Made them exactly by the recipe but then added a mayo I made with bottled hot wing sauce and mayo mixed together and fresh lettuce.  My husband and I will be making these again- definitely good enough for company and gourmet enough flavor to serve with a glass of wine.

Next time I make these, I will probably make some more adjustments to the recipe.  I think it could have used more blue cheese,hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  When I made these, I did increase the Worcestershire sauce to 1 tablespoon but it could probably use more for the 3 lbs., maybe 1 tablespoon per pound of ground beef.  Just a personal preference though.

Very good burgers. I was surprised that the blue cheese flavor wasn't more pronounced. I might add more next time around... and some finely chopped garlic might be a nice addition. Thanks Poni for a keeper!

Great change from ordinary burgers. Hot sauce and blue cheese are meant for each other. I am a big blue cheese fan so I nearly trippled the amount of cheese but I would guess that this would be excessive for some people. Non the less you could easily double the cheese. I served the burgers on a thick slice of french bread.

These were delicious! We used Feta instead of blue cheese. I used 1/8 cup of dried chives and 1/8 cup of dried green onions. The meat I used was a little fat so these fell apart more than we liked but the taste was excellent. I ended up having to bring them in from the grill and finish frying them on the cooktop. Next time I will use lean ground beef as the recipe is written. My entire family loved these. We will make these again.

These are great burgers. We added a little extra blu cheese on top at the end.

Excellent recipe...just make sure you don't use more than it calls for of blue cheese, or else you will have over-kill.

This recipe is awesome.  I made couple of changes by making a sauce with the wet ingredients and the dry seasonings, then mixing it in with the burger meat.  This ensures better coverage.  Then add the crumbled blue cheese and form into patties.  Also, I kicked it up by doubling the hot sauce; personal preference.

We love this recipe at our house and make it over and over and over again!  One of my kids is a fairly picky eater and she loves them, she calls them "Green Things Hamburgers" because of the chives!  A new family favorite, and I don't generally even like bleu cheese!  We also normally cut the beef down to 2 lbs instead of 3.

Very good recipe just as is. The blue cheese flavor is profound (I can not imagine adding more). Probably not a kid friendly recipe but a must try for more developed taste buds! Try this with ground turkey---it is great!

We raise our own beef and have plenty of hamberger so we are allways looking for new ways to prepare it. This is by far the BEST! I shape them into large patties and eat them like a steak. The only thing I add is beef gravy on top.

I love blue cheese and I love burgers! So I am in luck!  Great combo of flavors! I used extra blue cheese and extra amounts of the sauces called for and put them on the outdoor grill!  I will make these again!  I make extras so I can heat them up for lunch during the week!

Great way to spice up hamburgers!  I made these last night, scaled the recipe down to serve 4 and used scallions (no chives on hand)and they came out really good.  Next time, though, I would add more of the spices to give a little extra flavor.

Made these a couple of times now. The 1st time I thought it didn't have enough blue cheese so made note to self to add more. I also didn't let it sit for 2 hrs. The 2nd time we added more blue cheese, but left to sit for 8 hrs cause we were busy & thought this way they're ready to put on when we are done working. That was a big mistake - overpowering in blue cheese flavor. We'll probably make again, but won't make ahead & leave for over 2 hrs. They are different for a change of plain burgers.

Delicious!  I mostly followed the recipe, but I mixed it up and cooked in a cast iron skillet immediately instead of letting it sit in the fridge first.  Used dried chives and added some minced garlic.  Sprinkled the outside with coarse salt instead of mixing salt in.  Definitely a keeper!

A nice change of pace from your normal everyday hamburger. Followed the recipe but doubled the blue cheese (personal preference-wanted a very pronounced blue cheese flavor), and made extras to freeze. simple, delicious meal to pull out and cook on busy weeknights. Great flavor if you like blue cheese.  My only complaint is that it still wasn't as cheesy as I expected, and since I doubled the cheese, I doubt the called-for amount would have been enough.  Will definitely make again.

Good burgers!  Doesn't go overboard with ingredients, the blue cheese works much better mixed into the patty than put on top.

Great recipe, just stuff the bleu cheese in the center of 2 burgers (thin to medium) and seal.  AWESOME!

These were the best burgers I have ever made.  I didn't have Worcestershire Sauce so I used steak sauce instead and added 1 TBSP instead of tsp. Also, no chives on hand so I used 1 small chopped onion. Everyone raved, even my son who doesn't like blue cheese!

These were great. The only problem was that I slightly over cooked them, but they were still juicy.  Planning to make them again soon. Thank you for a wonderful recipe

I've been using this recipe for awhile now, but with the addition of sun dried tomatoes. Combination of flavors is awesome! Try with a fresh basil leaf instead of lettuce.

We tried this by blending the blue cheese with the meat, and by stuffing the burgers.  Preferred the stuffed version - but both ways were fantastic.

Made this recipe exactly as is. Burgers were very tasty. Even coaxed my 10-year old daughter who usually eats only veggie burgers to try one and she loved it too. Next time I will add more blue cheese than the recipe called for to make these go from 4 stars to 5. Another reviewer mentioned adding cooked and crumbled bacon to the mixture and I think that would really compliment the flavor. Thanks!

Was very surprised with this recipe. Loved the burgers. Did add the bacon and a few other spices. Topped with sauteed onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and cheese on brioche bread.

So delicious!  Even if you don't care for blue cheese, you'll love these burgers.  My husband and kids both love them and none of even knew I put blue cheese in the ingredients.  This is a must try!

2/12. they really shrink so make 3 out of 1 lb not 4.  i did not have chives but put minced onion in larry's. put gorgonzola on top.  maybe it will be different with blue cheese?  maybe better?
memorial day 2103 panov & enquists  followed exactly but 1/3 of all with the exception of the blue cheese, i used about 3 oz crumbled.  they were great! also instead of 1 lb of beef i used 1/2 pork and  1/2 beef combo pack.

The burgers came out very juicy and with so much flavor, I cooked mine on a flat grilling iron for my gas grill, better than the burger joint.

Definitely best home burger, and probably the best burger I've ever tasted.  I added a little extra bleu cheese and minced garlic, and it was delicious.  I also ate it on a ciabatta roll grilled with buttter and had it with caramellized onions, american cheese, and sweet baby ray bbq sauce.  The only thing I'd mention is to maybe add bacon bits, because that would just be over-the-top delicious :) oh and be sure to get blue cheese with the smallest crumbles possible because they tend to fall out a little.  But overall, the burger was very juicy with a smokey flavor. Very good :)

This was a pleasantly flavorful change to the plain burger..I used 90% fat ground beef but next time will try a bit more fat content to help keep it juicier-my husband loved this!

My husband and I really liked these.  After reading some other reviews, I did add some fresh garlic to to the mix and we went a little heavy on the blue cheese, otherwise we followed it pretty closely.  We'll definitely make them again.

Great burgers!  Next time I make these burgers I will chop the chives smaller and add a slice of bacon.  I used blue cheese dressing instead of mustard on the bun-really good.

These were good. I didn't have any dry mustard so I left that out but kept everything else the same (eyeballed the quantities) but I'd make these again. Note to self: only make on grill because if you try to make them in a pan on the stove the blue cheese will stick and burn on the pan.

Followed the recipe exactly except I also threw in a few cloves of minced garlic. The family could not stop raving! Would have been even better if a large black dog hadn't stolen one of the burgers off the counter before it ever made it to the grill. Ahem. Apparently, he's a fan, too.

These weren't over the top like the title of the recipe may sound but they weren't bad either.  I might try some other variations next time like bacon bits, adding more seasonings or something?

We really like these in our house.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese for the most part but when combined with all the other ingredients it gives the beef (or turkey) a great salty/tangy flavor.  I also really like the idea of using chives, not a frequently used ingredient in my house but I will start adding it to more dishes.

I really like the juicy flavor of this burger.  We added strips of bacon and they turned out fabulous!

Did turkey with feta---SO DELICIOUS.  Definitely let it sit for 2 hours before cooking though.

This was a big hit at my BBQ.  I did add minced white onions and more blue cheese.  It smelled very potent, but after it was cooked, it was perfect!

These are delicious!  I only made 1 pound of beef, but used 2 - 3 oz. blue cheese.  Just enough blue cheese flavor.  Loved the chives and other seasonings.  These are probably some of the best burgers my hubby's grilled up!

Nice - but if you like blue cheese flavor add a bit more or you won't really taste it.  I mixed 2 lbs (80/20) hamburger with 1 lb ground turkey. Worked great - grilled nicely.

Great flavour combination.  I reduced the amount of meat by a third to fit the size of my family and used bison instead of the beef.  We really like the subtle flavour of bison and it is so much lower in fat.  I just eye-balled the rest of the spices which weren't  reduced by that much.  Everyone in the house really enjoyed these burgers.  I didn't tell the kids about the blue cheese.  Next time I'll make the full recipe and freeze the burgers for another bbq day.

This was the first time that I have ever had blue cheese, and at first I was a little intimidated, but it was so good!  I actually can't believe how good these burgers are!  My husband and I both thought they were awesome.

I loved these burgers. I made them into mini sliders and topped them with more blue cheese. I cooked them in a pan with just a minute or so on each side. They were amazingly easy to make and tasted great!   As party appetizers, the mini sliders are gorgeous as open face burgers with a bit of greens underneath too!

Made burgers for the first time tonight.  The best ever!  Didn't have chives so minced white onion which worked well.  Was raining outside so pan fried, 5 minutes on high first side, medium heat other side.  Depends on thickness but these were so juicy I don't think I'll put in a bun next time, just serve with tomatoes and red onions on the side.  Maybe with cottage cheese.  Delicious!!!!

Scaled down the recipe for only 1/2 lb. ground beef. Didn't have chives so I used a little onion powder instead.  Omitted the hot sauce and probably almost doubled the blue cheese.  Definitely needs the extra cheese!!!

I have to confess that I didn't have fresh meat, but rather some free range patties in my freezer that my mom got me from the farmer's market during the summer. Wanting to make them more exciting, I decided to mix the ingredients of this recipe together and smear them on top of my burger. I wasn't too hopeful that it would turn out very good as the recipe instructs to incorporate the ingredients into the meat, but both my boyfriend and I thought it tasted really good! I will definitely use this recipe again, even with my regular ol' patties. I can't wait until the summer time when I can use this recipe in its original form at a cookout and impress everyone. Excellent flavor, well worth the five stars.

Okay, I like to put the blue cheese between two patties and seal them, you get more blue cheese flavor that way.  But still good.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe!  I scaled it down to 8 servings, but used the same amount of blue cheese called for in original recipe scale.  I also broiled these in the oven instead of grilling.  They were excellent!  Very flavorful and definitely a keeper!  Next time, I will grill them (waiting for warmer weather) and they will be perfect!

This is the only burger we make now. It is fantastic and people who don't really like blue cheese still enjoy these. I like to serve the burger on a toasted onion bun sometimes topped with bacon! Can't beat this burger.

The flavor was great and I didn't have any problems with the cheese gooping out when I cooked it. Although, next time I will add a bit more blue cheese. Otherwise really yummy!

Holy Jesus, these burgers are delicious! Just the right amount of sharpness from the blue cheese and hotness complement this burger well. I used 2-3 fresh small tobasco peppers instead of the sauce. Worked well.

These were good, but not great. Personally I think I needed more fat in the meat for my tastes - but that's easily adjustable to YOUR tastes, so I'm giving it 5 stars because the spice mixture and ratios were great. You do lose a lot of cheese making them this was as opposed to making 2 patties and sandwiching the cheese between, though, but this method is a LOT easier (to me). Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely needs more bleu cheese.  Otherwise, yummy! Think next time I'll make a bleu cheese sauce to go with or just add more to the meat.  I used a mixture of lean and 15% ground beef to get a little extra flavor.

My husband absolutely loved this burger!  Make sure and use fresh ground pepper as it really adds flavor, and I also added 2 eggs to keep it congealed on the grill.....also goes great with tomatoes and buns that are fried w/butter!

WOW!!!  These were the best burgers I have ever put in my mouth!  I did follow the others advice and put the blue cheese in the middle of 2 thin patties, which I pressed together.  The blue cheese stayed inside and off the grill.  topped mine with some dijon mustard and it was wonderful!!!

Just made these for a cookout and people really liked them.  I liked that the blue cheese taste wasn't overpowering.

Very delicious!! I halved the recipe, since it was just the two of us. Normally my spouse isn't too enthused about blue cheese. I really like it, in moderation. The level of the blue cheese flavor was just right. We couldn't detect any of the hot pepper sauce, so I might add a bit more next time. Other than that, it was excellent! I cooked them on top of the stove in an All Clad skillet, so the patties browned up very nicely. Our tummies are full and we have big satisfied grins on our faces!

I followed the recipe as written, but wish I had added more blue cheese to the mixture and/or topped the burgers with blue cheese as they finished cooking on the grill (as I read that some other reviwers have). There just wasn't enough blue cheese flavor for me. With the slight modification for the future, I can see how this recipe would easily be in the five star category.

This is a great recipe! We made these for Memorial Day and they were delicious. Because of our own taste preferences we added more Worstershire and blue cheese. Definately try!

I have been making something like this for a while now. I use lots of bleu cheese crumples and add chopped, drained green chilies from the can. I also top with pepper jack cheese ( for the spice lovers in the family). Just hamburger,green chilis, blue cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and the pepper jack! Delicious and creamy!!

Essentially, these are  blue cheese flavored burgers as the recipe uses but 1/3 of an ounce per burger.  Be aware that blue cheese and Worcestershire both provide umami, the so-called fifth taste.  And Worcestershire is a lot cheaper.

These were very good. I only used 1 pd of beef and stuck to the same amount of ingredients on the original recipe still not enough flavor for me next time i will spice it up a bit more. Good flavor just wanted more.

Very delicious. We made these with beef and turkey. Both were very good. I even liked the turkey a bit more because it had a very fresh light flavor to it.

We loved this recipe for bleu cheese burgers.  The only thing I did differently was form the meat into balls and put and indentation in the middle; place the cheese inside and wrap the meat around it.  GREAT recipe.  It is a keeper.

These were amazing! I added a little garlic and some BBQ spices in place of the hot sauce. I also topped them with bacon, avacado, and a sauce I made of 2 parts pre-made french onion dip and 1 part mayo with fresh minced garlic. Like someone else wrote, the flavor is a little strong for kids, but the adults liked them a lot!

Not what I expected.  These were OK. Maybe we should have made the patties a little thicker.  The blue cheese was very good.  We melted swiss cheese and a little extra blue cheese on top.

I had a feeling when I was mixing these burgers that my taste buds would want more oomp! (hey everybody's taste buds are different!) so guilty as I may be, I strayed from the recipe by adding a tad of minced onion and minced garlic. As far as the blue cheese, I added the exact amount the recipe called for and really felt as if I would have liked it better with more. But the burger is delicious, no doubt! I just think the additions should be upped a bit! Thank you!

Blue Cheese..My first thought was "no-way", because I usually hate blue cheese. But THIS RECIPE IS A WINNER!!! The blue cheese adds a wonderful rich flavor that makes the burgers so wonderful. My family LOVED this and we will definitely make this again, again, and again. Thanks for this one.

These burgers were quick an easy to make.Most of us have to make it" our own" by adding that special touch.Mine,garlic salt(penzeys),ommited the hot sauce. I love hot a spicy,yet felt hot sauce didnt belong in this recipe.Maybe Ill do a blind taste test with friensd one day.I also diced the red onion and sauteed it in a bit of olive oil totake away the bite,leaving its sweetness behind.I think raw onions compete to much with the sublime bites of bluecheese Tried to find a blue cheese with a compatable fat content. Not to be naughty,but one to with stand the heat. I found a gorgonzola at 50%. There were many others thar were higher. Didnt want to loos them to the heat.The Burgers themselves were so tasty,that condiments were not needed. I shamefully wasted what I thought I would use.Ketchup and mustard down the drain. But Ill never have to do it again with this keeper!

Loved these! Added cheddar cheese thick slice at the end -- soo good!  Also, I didn't have the dry mustard and the chives, but still really delicious.  I threw some chopped onions in the pan with the burgers, and served on the side; they absorbed all that great flavor and were super delicious.  Also seved a side salad with blue cheese dressing (Bob's is the best imo).  Fantastic!!!!

I made these for Memorial Day and yes, they are very different.  You really don't need to add anything else, all the flavor is in the meat.  I did grill thick slices of onion to adorn the top.  Loved it.

Great flavor, but I didn't really taste the blue cheese as much as I would have liked to. Also, five minutes on each side was just a little to long for our taste. They were a little dry. I will try using more blue cheese and grill for 3-4 minutes on each side next time.

Awesome!!  I halved this to make only 6 burgers and doubled the blue cheese.  My husband said that this is the best burger I have ever made.  Kids liked them too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Will make again. Used only one and a half pounds of ground hamburger and didn't have dry mustard so I used mustard out of the fridge. It was so funny how much my kids loved these because they don't like blue cheese. The next day after making these my 10 year old and I were talking about the burgers and she was saying how good they are and I let her know hers had blue cheese and she was shocked because she loved it so much. Also a little blue cheese salad dressing is really good spread on the bun. Top the patty with monterey jack cheese and toast buns. Yummm

Very good - a nice flavor that is a welcome change to the typical grilled burger faire.

I used Feta cheese (was out of Blue cheese) and finely chopped yellow onion.

I'll probably make this the basis for most of my burgers going forward, and let it evolve over time.

Awesome!  I made the recipe perfectly then added a blue cheese sauce consisting of butter, onions, garlic, crumbled bacon, remaining blue cheese crumbles and some blue cheese dressing.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that this was the best burger EVER!  Definitely a favorite, thanks!!

These were delicious! It was a nice change from the regular burger. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like blue cheese liked these. I'll make these again.

My husband raved about these burgers.  He was addicted to the Bleu Cheese Burgers from Costco and they have discontinued them.  I thought I'd try to make them on my own.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings and followed it exactly except for throwing some extra cheese in (can never have enough cheese).  My husband cooked them on the grill and I feared the worst...cheese oozing, over cooked, HECK no! He loved them!  He said "Do not modify this recipe!" when I started making suggestions found in the reviews.  He ate three bunless burgers and I have three uncooked burgers left over, which he wants again for dinner tonight.  I do not like blue cheese so I didn't taste them, going on what hubby said.  I'll be making a big batch and freezing them for quick dinners.  Thanks!

Outstanding Burgers! I didn't change a thing and they are so good. I did add more blue cheese to my bun along with mustard and onion. Tastes just like a fav restaurant of mine in Florida!
Thanks for sharing!

These are fantastic!  One comment about grilling them - I had a bit of trouble with my gas bbq flaring up because of the blue cheese melting into the flames.  Next time I will place some foil under the grate to catch the drippings.  We were on top of it though and the end result was just great!  Don't sub for the fresh chives.  They add something special.  Even the kids thought they were yummy!

Good burger. It was a big crumbly. it may have been my beef. i used extremely lean meat. But good recipe. I served on ciabatta rolls that were toasted with a bit of butter in the oven.

We make blue cheese stuffed burgers all the time. We gave this a try and it wasn't as good as our own. We season the meat and then make 2 smaller burgers and put the cheese in the middle of one burger. Then place the other on top and press the sides. It gives it a much better blue cheese flavor.

GREAT!  These were a big hit and we'll make them again and again!  I didn't have time to sit for 2 hours, but they were juicy and tasty anyway. Can't wait to have them next time with extra time to marry the flavors. Thanks for sharing

Wow! I'm still licking my lips. I could have had another if I didn't care about my figure. Hubby said the same. I didn't put any additional cheese on top, as my family is used to. The 'cheese lover' in my family balked, but I assured her that it was inside. All three of the kids, ages 5, 7, & 9, ate every bite. They didn't know it was blue cheese. Not that you couldn't taste the blue cheese, they just don't have discerning palates yet, I guess. I added more of the spices and sauces as others have suggested. Avocado, Roma tomato, and red onion. PERFECT!

AMAZING!!!  I did doubled the blue cheese, chives, Worcestershire sauce and mustard.  Next time I will probably put even more in for stronger flavor.  These are so juicy and cooked very nice on the grill at medium heat.  (they do shrink a bit)

These are absolutely, hands-down, the best burgers I ever ate.  The blue cheese makes them so moist and flavorful.  I used Gorgonzola cheese, so the flavor was subtle and not overwhelming.  Just really, really good burgers.

These were great! We loved them.  My husband formed them, & got 10 patties. I put the extra in the freezer. I followed the recipe exactly & grilled them for about 3 mins on the George Foreman Grill. Thanks.

I would give this more stars if I could.  I used a 1.25 package of ground turkey and adjusted the seasonings accordingly--sorry I can't give you the exact amts but I did use the whole 4 oz of blue cheese.  Made 6 patties and froze 3.  The first 3 were cooked on the George Foreman grill and the last 3 just pan fried.  They were great both ways.  Due to the high cost of chives at my market, I think I'll try green onions or finely chopped red onion next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing!!! I used what I had on hand.  I sprinkled a small container of blue cheese crumbles (6 oz) with one cap full of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning blend, mixed it together, then combined it with 1.75 pounds of Ground Round.  Threw then on the good ole’ George Foreman Grill and WOW!! I can not wait to serve these to friends!  I think the George Grill may cook them better, since with the cheese it's a delicate burger.  Oh so moist, and the cheese developed a crispy crust on the top and bottom of the burger.  Make this recipe today!

I took other reviewers' advice and increased the amount of blue cheese, a bit too much I'm afraid for my taste, anyway!  My guests either really did enjoy the burgers or they were just being polite!  I will definitely try the recipe again with a slight adjustment to the blue cheese.  These burgers are a nice break from the standard BBQ'd "burg".

I was really looking forward to these burgers and followed the recipe to the letter. I just didn't like them. I couldn't finish mine. My husband's review was that they "weren't that bad". The dogs devoured the extras, and we will go back to simple burgers with Johnny's Seasoning salt. I'm glad others had a better experience. I think the blue cheese was just too overpowering for us.

If I could give these more than five stars, I would.  My husband and I DEVOURED these burgers!  I'm glad there are some in the freezer.  I have never tasted blue cheese before, so I could definitely taste it in the burger--the flavor went deliciously well with the flavor of grilled meat.  I did not have chives so I used dried minced onion, and I cooked them on the Foreman grill.  This will be our new 4th of July treat!

Boy, I hate to be a downer here, but these weren't as good as I had expected.  I just LOVE blue cheese and was really looking forward to this recipe.  I made exactly as stated, except only used 2 lbs. of beef.  I didn't taste all the great flavors that went into this...especially the blue cheese.  IF I made this again, I'd double all the seasonings and add to 2 lbs. of beef.  Worth a try though......

The only thing I did differently was to add some very finely diced red onion to the meat mixture. Absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend these. Thanks so much, Poni!

This recipe was delicious, much better than the burgers molded around a lump of bleu cheese like I'd tried before.  Based on other reviews, I only used 2 lbs of meat and 8 oz of bleu cheese, since me and my family love it.  I also coated the burgers with cajun seasoning before grilling, to give it a "black and bleu" flavor... It was great!!!

excellent burger.  My husband isn't a huge fan of blue cheese, but it was just the right amount, I used 2 pounds of beef instead of 3, and still 4oz of cheese. If someone loved blue cheese you might want to add more cheese.  I also doubled all the other seasonings!

I thought these to be the ABSOLUTE best hamburgers! I LOVE bleu cheese so that helps and the hot sauce adds a nice kick, I added extra hot sauce. I can tell you my DH thought they were ok but he isnt big into bleu cheese but my daughter, and inlaws thought it had to be the best hamburger they have ever had! DELICIOUS!

Fan-freakin'-tastic.  These are the best burgers I've ever had.  I used more hot sauce and worcestershire sauce than the recipe called for, and slightly more blue cheese.  Amazing.  I'll make these again and again.

These were excellent!  I already made them twice in a week for a different group of people!  I added some garlic hot sauce instead of hot pepper sauce, cause that was all I had, and also just used grainy dijon mustard.

This is a divine tasting burger.  I used lean beef (90/10)...and I like my burger really well done...so, it was a bit on a the dry side, but very tasty, nonetheless!!  I added more blue cheese and hot sauce than called for after reading the other reviews.  I also melted provolone and mushrooms over the top.  I didn't use any extra condiments on top...it didn't need any!!! ENJOY!!

I don't like bleu cheese, so I thought these were just OK. My wife, who loves all cheeses, liked them much more. She said that she'd had better bleu cheese before, so maybe higher quality cheese would have made me like them more.

This was a hit at my small bbq. I used pre-ground chuck, and it was intentionally not the super-lean ground beef. I bought the beef & blue cheese at trader joe's.

the one thing i had to monitor was the heat of the grill -- too well done and the cheese would melt (but not like how cheddar melts on top of a burger....) into nothingness. 

even the usual bbq chicken eaters went for the beef on this one -- thumbs up!

Incredibly tasty.  We were hesitant to try this recipe because none of us really like blue cheese, but we wanted a new burger recipe, so we tried it, and we are so glad we did.  The only change we made was that we only used two pounds of hamburger (we used the specified amounts of all other ingredients).  We will definitely be making these again.

These patties are much better than plain ol' burgers. But, I would definitely add a lot more cheese and throw in some extra chives and wor. sauce for more flavor. Will make again and experiment more.

Very tasty and moist burger. I scaled it for 1lb angus beef.  Used a bit more blue cheese than the scaled recipe. Used green onions instead of chives because I had some. Made some caramelized onions for a topper along with lettuce, tomato and blue cheese dressing. Served it on a toasted English muffin. Yummy! I'll make this again.

Good burger. I was using only one pound of ground beef so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I served the burgers with bacon and thinly sliced tomatoes. The blue cheese was a nice flavor burst but I thought the burger needed a bit more seasoning. I’ll play around with that next time.

This is awesome! After reading the reviews, I did decide to double the bleu cheese and I am glad that I did. Very good recipe.

I love blue cheese and I love this burger. I modified the following: dried minced onions instead of chives (didn't have any) and broiled instead of grilled (it was raining cats and dogs outside). I only used 1lb of beef because there was only 2 of us eating, so I may have had to much or too little of the ingredients as I was kinda guessing what 1/3 of a 1/4 teaspoon was and so on. Used a very strong Danish Blue Cheese and it was perfect. Strong blue cheese flavor, perfectly seasoned, topped with american chese (we're obsessed with cheese) lettuce, tomato, red onion and a garlic mayo. This is my new go to recipe for blue burgers. Thank you!

I was hoping for stronger flavors. Definitely not a bad burger. Maybe next time I will add more blue cheese and see if that makes the burger "pop" more with the flavors.

I increased the seasonings/cheese by 50%. Besides a dash from the pepper mill I subbed out the black pepper for white, added 1/2tsp ea. onion & garlic powders. Topped w/the extra 1/2 serving of cheese last few minutes of grilling, then Thinly sliced Romas, purple onion & avocado to finish it off, Mom had me grill her onion too. This was a meal I really been anticipating, increasingly so as I grilled. It did not disappoint.

Everyone loved these and one commented,  “This is the first burger I’ve ever eaten without ketchup!”

Easy and very low-mess dinner to prepare, I only used two measuring spoons and the plate to take the burgers away from the grill. Dishes are not yet done and I’ve already had a request to make these again, can’t beat that!

This was a great burger. Had to play around with the toppings, but my favorite was lettuce, blue cheese dressing, and A1.  Also thinking it would go good with onion straws on top.

This was "AWESOME ". I only had green onions vs. chives on hand still turned out "GREAT ". Added thick sliced bacon "PERFECT "! Will enjoy this again bunless of course. My thighs got too excited with the bun. Thank You!

I made as written, except for using 80/20 ground beef. I use lean ground beef for casseroles, meatloaf.. But not for burgers. You need that fat for a juicy burger.
We liked these burgers,  but we felt they didn't have enough blue cheese. We had to top them with extra blue cheese,  at the table.

Though I don't eat hamburgers I got 2 thumbs up from those who did. Burgers were flavorful and moist. I'm also horrible at grilling but that didn't affect the recipe.,and cooking on foil was a great tip. I started without it and had flames going everywhere! After taming the flames, using the foil for the remaining cooking time, I was still asked to make them again. Great burgers

I like blue cheese, but didn't like these burgers much at all. I have a friend who makes them by melting blue cheese on top instead of mixing it with the burger meat. I recommend doing that in case some of your guests / family don't like blue cheese. (Turns out my father hates it - he almost spit out this burger!)

Added one egg and bread crumbs, which held it all together well. Same ingredients but with only 1 pound of medium ground beef. Served on toasted buns with mayo and sauteed cremini mushrooms and red/white onions. Dee-lish.

Watch for flare-ups on your BBQ!

BAM!! What a great change to the everyday burger. My wife and I love Blue Cheese, but the boys weren't to hip on the idea at first. I made a few minor changes, adding onion and garlic to the burger mix with a handful of bread crumbs. I mixed and put everything together an hour prior to cooking. Once finished, I let the burgers sit for about 10 minutes. Both of my boys stated, "The Best Burgers" ever!!

A huge hit that we'll be doing more of in the future. I think I'll try some bacon in the stuffing mix next time.

Really good!  I halved it easily and used sliced green onion instead of chives and grated one clove garlic in meat mixture. Topped with brown sugar bacon, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato.  Will be making them regularly.

These were excellent! I was searching for different burger recipes for Memorial Day as I was tired of the same old burgers and cheeseburgers. I found this recipe and a recipe for gorgonzola-basil burgers. Both were great!
I didn't change anything and followed the recipe. Don't ruin it by putting ketchup or a pickle on it. I drizzled my favorite steak sauce on ours and everyone loved them! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this exactly as written. No great flavors from anything other than the blue cheese. Saved half the mixture and made into burgers for another time. Hope they have more flavor! 
If not, it's easier to make regular burgers and just add the cheese on top!

These burgers are scrumptious. I've made them several times with different soft (stinky) cheeses. Roquefort is my favorite cheese to use. Anyone who I share them with raves about the taste.

This is a surprisingly good recipe.  I knew I would like it as soon as I saw it, but it actually far transcends the individual potential of each ingredient.  I've made this for a number of people, all of whom are not fans of blue cheese; and it has made instant believers out of them.  It was often requested of me to make these again.  I'm thankful to the contributor of this recipe.

I made this recipe tonite, I to made changes.The use of really good Blue Cheese is Key. I increased worcestershire sauce, used shallot and dijon mustard, garlic, 2 eggs beaten and 1/2 cup bread crumbs,and 4lbs. good ground beef, 80/20%. Gently mixed all together.So as to not have tough dry patties, grilled to perfection. They were amazing. My whole family Loved them. This will be made often.Loved the advice to make extra and put in the freezer.

Very good burgers. I added real bacon bits, garlic salt and Gorgonzola cheese and skipped the chives.  They were moist and very flavorful.  We had guests for dinner and even those who do not like blue cheese said they were awesome burgers. I will make again for sure.

I made these burgers with one modification. instead of 3 pounds ground beef, I use 1.5 lbs extra lean ground beef and 1.5 lbs lean ground pork. We found them to be really flavorful. The blue cheese adds a bit of tang to the burgers without being overpowering. My husband who is NO blue cheese fan, had seconds!

Very good! Only change I made was adding about 1 tsp minced garlic and a thick slice of bacon on top. Also its very cold here so I could not grill, left a little of the bacon grease in the pan and cooked burgers in hot skillet for about three minutes each side. Left them very moist and oh so yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

These burgers turned out great!  I didn't have any chives so I left those out, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  They were very juicy and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe with a few modifications. We tripled all the spices (but did not triple salt) and it made for a more flavorful burger. (We made it once the original recipe way to compare and enjoyed the burgers a lot more with triple the spices).

Ten stars!!! IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VEGETARIANS:  I made this using Beyond Meat and it was MAGNIFICENT. I didn’t use the frozen crumbles because I wasn’t sure how that would work; I used the pre-made patties I found in the meat section at Whole Foods. Only used two pounds instead of three (because that stuff is pricey), but otherwise used the same measurements from the recipe (with slightly less salt). I topped them with some melted Swiss and that was all I needed. So, so, so good. Amazing flavor. Only slight change was that I used Tabasco Chipotle and doubled it. So. Dang. Good.

I love a good grilled burger anyway, but this puts it completely over the top. FANTASTIC! I made exactly as suggested, except I ended up using prepared mustard instead of mustard powder (didn't have any).

Minus the dry mustard and hot pepper sauce.  I did add bacon and put these burgers on my smoker for just over two hours and they were to die for.

Epic recipe.  Both my wife and 5 yr. old enjoyed as well.  Probably used a bit more blue cheese, but if you love blue cheese, hard not to be generous with it.  Will definatley cook again next time there is a burger craving in the household.

Hands down the best burgers I've made on the grill!  So flavorful, they were better than I've tasted in some restaurants.  These are definitely going onto the recipe rotation list!

Wow, 
These are the best homemade burgers I ever had.  I make them for my sons and they love it! I just skip the chives.

Based on all the reviews, I thought this would be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not. I only used 2 lbs of beef and still the flavor was lacking. Not sure I will attempt this again.

In general these burgers turned out really dry. I had bake the half at the pan, and grilled the other half at the oven. When baked at the pan they became dry though tasted nice. When grilled ,,, they turned very very dry,,,:( and all of the cheese had melt, and the burgers had no taste. I think the meat mixture needs something to remain moist and maybe it is better to stuff the mixture with the cheese rather than crumbling it in the meat mixture.

Delicious, juicy burger!  This is our go to burger recipe when we have company.  My only recommendation is to add more blue cheese.  Of course, I really like blue cheese!!  We top ours with provolone, lettuce, tomato and onion.  Great recipe!

I have to say that I did make one change to this already great recipe. I used 1/2 the amount of beef called for, and substituted the other 1/2 with pork sausage. I'm sure that made a significant difference in the overall taste, but this was an awesome recipe...and I'm not a fan of blue cheese!

Not a huge blue cheese fan, but I like it a lot better now! I didn't have worchestshire sauce, so I used A1 along with the rest of the ingredients..they were great. My bf said he was drunk on my burgers. Definately could use more blue cheese as we really couldn't taste it as much as we'd like

Great recipe, the first couple times I have made it I used Feta cheese instead of blue cheese (I also have used a mixture of feta and blue). I also used Pickapeppa sauce for the hot pepper sauce, and added a little more like a half teaspoon. When I cook these, I grill them over wood indirectly. When cooking at 300-400 F it will take a little while, but they are SO savory and delicious.

These were absolutely delicious - better than the ones I used to buy from the meat market!  I used 80% lean ground beef, and I doubled the amount of blue cheese and hot sauce.  I will definitely make these again!

This recipe was tasty and held up really well in the freezer.  I do add extra hot sauce, since we like spicy.

WOW!!! Thats all I can say.  I tried these burgers for my boyfriends mom.  Pretty sure she is in love with me now.  I did use turkey burger instead of beef.  It made for a really fun, light burger.

These turned out pretty good, but I felt like some of the bleu cheese flavor melted away when I cooked them. We did freeze the extras though and they made a great quick and easy lunch

The seasonings need to be increased. I  doubled the seasonings and still found the burgers to be a bit boring.  The flavors are excellent, just need more of them.  I will make these again, but this time I'll go extra heavy with the seasonings.

I made these using ground bison and they were fabulous! My husband said they were the best burgers he's ever had, anywhere! I don't like a strong blue cheese flavor, but I loved these. The blue cheese was not overwhelming in the least. I cooked these in a frying pan, since we do not have a grill, and it worked out just fine.

Could do without that much salt, maybe skip it all together or just sprinkle a little over the patties.

Very good!  I did add more Hot Pepper Sauce, Worcestershire and Blue Cheese. But I also added Feta Cheese. Most guests did not like blue cheese, but loved these burgers!  Our grandchildren loved them.  I served them with my famous potato salad!

After reading reviews about the cheese melting all over the grill I decided to make 2 small flat burgers and put the blue cheese in the middle of the two.  Next time I'll tell my son this as he took a bite and the blue cheese all came out.  My husband, who does not like blue cheese loved his burger made by omitting the cheese.  We had these burgers with bacon as well.  I added the grease from the bacon to the meat as we only had ground sirloin - 7% fat).

WOW! The flavor of these burgers is amazing! I'm not sure I'll ever be able to eat a plain burger again! I disagree w/others who said that these have a strong blue cheese flavor, it's just perfect-I may even add a little more next time! I also added some crumbled bacon into 1/2 of the burgers-delish!Just fantastic! Thank you!!

Uh-maze-ing!  Very simple and quick to prepare, hardly any effort necessary at all.  I recommend using more ground beef per serving, because if we had used just what the recipe called for, each burger would be pretty tiny.  The family loved this quick and easy recipe.

I had never had a blue cheese burger before, but now they're my favorite! I loved it.  I only used the recipe for my beef patty: I will probably use more cheese next time.  I served this with only BBQ sauce on top and it was perfect just like that! I will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe, but not great. It's a good foundation.  The first time I made it I could barely taste the spices or cheese.  Second go around I doubled everything except the meat. Doing that brings this recipe from a three to a five for me.

I added almost twice the blue cheese and a heaping Tbsp. of crushed garlic.  Very good.

I made these for a Memorial Day barbeque and they were a huge hit. Delicious, flavorful and juicy with just the right amount of blue cheese without it ending up overpowering.

If you make two thin hamburger patties and put them together, better used 1/2 the blue cheese as it doesn't melt and run out like it would otherwise. Very strong flavor.

YUMMY.  I made these burgers yesterday and they were a hit.  The only thing I changed was to double the blue cheese.  Even our 12 year old liked them.

This was an okay burger.  I adjusted the measurements to feed 4 people, but kept the ingredients true to the recipe. Everyone enjoyed the burgers, but there were no raves.  I will probably make them again just to add variety to the burger menus throughout the summer.

I used cheddar cheese in half of the ground beef and blue cheese in the other half.  I added chopped green onions and some Dale's Steak Sauce to make the mixure moist.  They were really delicious and moist.  I think the spices need to be increased the next time.

Very good. I just finished eating one of these and while the taste was outstanding, the method of preparing the patties kind of made my patties fall apart. I used a creamy blue and you can barely taste it as it makes the meat moist and with runny cheese. YUM! Next time, I will cut up the blue into small chunks and surround a few with ground beef so that the cheese won't leak out so much and catch and burn on my grill. The literally ripped in half in my George Foreman as the cheese stuck to one side. Also, don't use a spray oil, oil liberally and oil again while hot with paper towel and oil. I used spray oil and I'm not looking forward to cleaning the grill. The pan needs to be hot to seal, I put them on while it was cold and it's not good. I think a light coating of flour(shaking off any excess) would help here and I think a whole egg wouldn't go astray in keeping these babies together. Small things in the method of making these mean you don't lose any cheese, they don't fall apart and you have less mess to clean. I had no hot pepper sauce or mustard powder, so I subbed a little sweet chilli and Hot English mustard. UPDATE: I use this recipe every single time for burgers now. It's so good. I don't see the point of making a hamburger unless it has a pool of gorgeous, slighlty tangy, runny blue cheese through the middle of it. Makes the entire burger so moist and flavourful!

This is the best homemade burger I have had to date! The blue cheese adds a nice kick to it yet is not overpowering at all. the only thing different I did was use "old style" mustard because I didn't have dry mustard on hand. Topped it off with carmelized onions and enjoyed it with a big glass of red wine!

One word- YUM. The whole family liked these burgers. I did add a bit more hot sauce as we prefer it this way and some chopped garlic. My husband likes a lot of bleu cheese so in addition to what the recipe called for, I melted some on top of his burger before serving.

I love these Burgers! I have made them twice and both times everyone made a very big deal about how good they were. I added crumbled bacon and put more blue cheese on top after I flipped them, other than that I followed the recipe and can't wait to have them again!

Excellent burgers.  I used gorganzola cheese and left it out of the meat mixture because some of my guests don't care for strong cheeses.  After removing the pattys from the grill I spooned the cheese crumbles on top and added a couple of strips of bacon.  Delicious!  I will definitely use this seasoning mix for all of my burgers even if I don't use blue cheese.  Thanks!

Doubled the blue cheese, and used gorgonzola for a really sharp taste. They were delish with fresh tomatos and thinly sliced red onion. Definately chill before BBQing so they hold together. Will make again.

These burgers ROCK!!! Amazing flavor, and we didnt even add ketchup, or mayo... they did cook down a bit using the 80/20 beef, so next time I will plan on more beef for each burger. My husband even cooked mine well done ( and I like mine medium rare) and it was still delicious and very juicy. We are making again this week and cannot wait!

These were yummy yummy.  I also added garlic to my mix and instead of salt, I added soy sauce.  Soy sauce has more body and flavor than just plain salt.  I also crisped up some bacon and sauteed some shrooms.

This was excellent, but the burgers were too small for our big appetites! Next we will make 8 burgers instead of 12.

these were sooo tasty on the barbeque! today my mum took out two patties that i froze and i broiled them in the toaster oven since she didn't want me to always use the hibachi all the time and i didn't want to use the oven on such a warm day. i made a marinade to baste with. i basted the burgers, broiled for three minutes, basted again, broiled for four minutes, flipped, basted, broiled for five minutes, basted one last time, broiled for two minutes, placed sliced mushroom and crumbled blue cheese on the burgers, turned off the broiler and used the remaining heat in the oven to cook and melt the mushrooms and cheese. this is delicious!

These burgers were very tasty. My family enjoyed them.  Overall the flavor was nice but I think it needed a little more blue cheese.  The flavor was too subtle for me.  Next time I make these I will increase the blue cheese in the burger.

This was good. I left out the chives. I also scaled this to make 2 burgers just for me and used way more blue cheese than was asked for. All the flavours meshed well. Nice change of pace.

I don't normally like to mess with recipes until I try them exactly as is, but....  I added about 1/2 cup of the real bacon bits and then topped the finished burgers with avocado slices. These were really, really good.

I only had One Pound of beef, so I used the same ingredients, only less beef. They were the most flavor packed, tasy hamburgers I have ever made! Next time I want to try Pepper Jack cheese! They were excellent!!!

A++ recipe.  A keeper.  Every man is sure to love.  I made these with ground beef and turkey.  High reviews on both.  I added a little bit of chopped garlic.  Other than that, followed the recipe.   YUM ! Thanks !

Really really great! My boyfriend loved them. I threw the leftovers in the fridge and they were just as good the second time around. If we weren't dieting at the moment I would be making these again really soon..

I made it without the hot sauce because one of my friends doesn't like spicy...  I'll have to make it again and then my review might be a little better.

these were pretty good...i omitted the mustard because i didn't have any. It didn't seem to have an impact on the flavor of the burgers. Also, I used Franks Red Hot for the pepper sauce.

A long time ago i went to my best friends house and tried his moms blue chesse burger and i thought it was great, but that was many years ago. So one day I decided to look for a recipe to cook for my girlfriend. Guess what I found this one and the burger was awesome. I must say it was juicy.

I DON'T eat burgers usually but this we had to try.  Made with ground turkey- this was great.  I followed someone's advice and melted the cheese for 30 seconds in the microwave, then mixed thoroughly into meat with other ingredients. Out of this world- thanks so much Poni.  This is the only way I'll make burgers from now on.

We made these for my hubby's birthday bash.  It's a good way to add a little something extra to hamburgers.  I don't think it's my answer to the boring burger, but it does add some variety.

I made these for my parents & wife for our Labor Day picnic on the boat and they loved them! The only change I made was that I used buffalo meat instead of beef. Perfect!

This is the best burger I've ever had! Like others, I doubled the ingredients, added some garlic and served them on toasted whole wheat buns with red onion, lettuce, avocado & grilled portobello. We did not have the full 2 hours to let the mixture sit, but 1 hour was still sufficient. I can't wait to make these again!

Everyone loved it. Great taste. I only had ground beef and blue cheese of the recipe ingredients, so I added barbecue sauce (honey-mustard) and chopped coriander. It had a great sweet and sour taste. My husband, who doesn't like blue cheese, loved these burgers. Try them!!!

Needed more meat, added an egg and bread  crumbs to stretch the recipe.  Otherwise, this was pretty good.  Can't wait to try on a real grill as opposed to the George Foreman!

I made these last nigh (with ground turkey) and they are great! I didn't have time to let them sit for 2 hours. I would like a stronger flavor, so I am going to double the ingredients next time.

I liked these burgers, but could not taste the bluecheese as much as I would have liked to.  I will make these again, but will add more bluecheese:)  Thanks for sharing:)

I looked at many recipes before settling on this one...this is GREAT!  I am really not a burger fan but this one gets two thumbs up!  The only changes I made were using vadalia onion instead of chives as that was all I had and I had to 'eyeball' the bluecheese since I had a big block of it. I did think it was on the salty side so next time I will decrease the salt.  YUMMY!!!!!

We used turkey meat, and it was a little dry.  I'm sure using hamburger is better.  Very flavorful!

Very good--be sure to not let the juices escape the patty as that's the best part!  They were even better the second day after sitting in the fridge overnight.

Awesome flavor even without the salt.  Makes 12 so I froze 8 in 2 4 packs and have ready-made dinner on hand when I don't have hours to make dinner.  LOVED THEM!  Also made some with the new Kraft crumbles since my husband and kids do not like bleu cheese and these were a hit as well!

I made these a few weeks ago.  I had two fresh and then froze the rest for when my fiance got back from work (he loves blue cheese and I was anxious to get his reaction to them).  The frozen ones were a bit better, but overall we didn't think they were that great.  My fiance makes better blue cheese burgers, although I don't know what he puts in them.  Thanks anyway.

I have a similar recipe of my own and they're great; but I prefer MUCH more bleu cheese and a bit of ancho chili powder. If you can find Hawaiian burger buns in your area...you won't believe how good

Don't try this if you don't love blue cheese. I love blue cheese and thought they were great...very moist.  I used grill seasoning, crushed red pepper and kosher salt with the Worcestershire sauce. I grilled on my Wolfgang Puck Grill ... be careful, only flip once and DON'T SQUISH YOUR BURGER, let set for a minute so all your juice don't run out.  Yummie

Added more blue cheese and only 2 pounds ground beef.  Excellent flavor and very juicy.  I went back and changed it to 4 stars.  The flavor was pretty good, but could have been better.  Liked the provolone burgers better.

This is by far the best recipe I've found on allrecipes. I've made these for nearly everyone I know and they all rave about them. Even my dad, who doesn't like anything seasoned. I always add a ton more blue cheese, but I'm a cheese person.

These were very good.  I used two pounds of meat and followed the recipe for the amounts of other ingredients.  I'll probably add more hot sauce next time, and maybe even more cheese!

The flavor was good but our burgers were kind of dry. I made the mixture a couple of hours earlier and refridgerated it. Don't know if that's what made it dry. But according to another reviewer, this should enhance the flavor better. Anyway, I might try it again with some changes. Although my husband thinks we should just stick with our own and VERY simple recipe which produced way more moist burgers.

These were okay, I really wanted these to be as good as the reviews said but the blue cheese flavor was lost. Next time I will make pockets inside the burgers.

Out of this world flavor! My only change was to double the amount of the blue cheese because I was serving these to blue cheese lovers.  Next time, I might blend in some stone-ground mustard to balance the blue cheese but as is these are divine.

Maybe I did something wrong but all the blue cheese melted away when I cooked it and you couldn't taste it at all. Edible, but nothing special.

These are great!  I didn't really measure the blue cheese and added a LOT more hot sauce than it called for (which I still didn't taste really).  My friend said it was the best burger he's ever had.  Will definitely make these again!

These have become a regular at my house.  Just delicious!  Following the suggestion of some other reviewers, I like to double the amount of feta, use more Worcestershire and add fresh minced garlic.  They're great!

This recipe was a nice change of pace.  I wouldn't make it very often because I'm not a huge blue cheese fan but we enjoyed it as an alternative to a plain old burger.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and I loved these burgers. I will probably never make another kind ever again. Not good for the blue cheese lover though. My fiance, who is *VERY* picky, said they were "OK".

I love hamburgers! This is a definite change from the usual "beef" burger I typically make. I enjoyed this burger because of the flavor. I did cut back on the salt because blue cheese has a very salty taste to me. I prefer my burgers on dutch crunch rolls.

Excellent burgers!  I forgot to put in the hot sauce, so I'm looking forward to trying it next time with some heat.  I added minced garlic like many other reviewers suggested.  It could maybe even use a little more blue cheese.  I plan on making these again very soon.

These were good, but the blue cheese was hardly noticeable. Not sure if it is worth the extra expense and calorie content.

I love Blue Cheese, but founds these lacking.  It needs more seasoning.  Am planning on reading all reviews and take some advice and try once more, hopefully it will taste better.

This is a great twist on a burger! I used ground buffalo, and let the mixture sit overnight for more flavor. I also used more hot sauce, since we love it.....

I am giving this recipe 4 stars but not because of the recipe.  I could not find blue cheese at the grocery store so I used blue cheese salad dressing instead.  I do not think the results would be the same.
In addition, I added some garlic.  Personally, my husband rated the burger a 4.8/5, and my 16 month old son really liked the meat with ketchup too. I will use this recipe again.

Definitely not one of the better recipes that I have tried on here. No one in our family cared for them. We love blue cheese melted on burgers but having it inside the burger was just not the taste that we were looking for plus they were entirely way too salty. This will not be a keeper for the recipe book...sorry  :(

They were very tasty, however make sureyou like blue cheese. Very very strong flavor. My fiance' LOVES blue cheese and ate every bite. 
Next time I will keep the recipes all the same, but maybe add a different cheese.  Very good recipe!! Thanks!

These were good, but not outstanding.  I expected more from them, after the high reviews.

Good flavor, but not enough blue cheese (and I doubled it).

These burgers were absolutely delicious.  I didn't use as much chives as the recipe called for, because I wasn't sure the kids would like the flavor.  I also didn't them them set like the recipe said.  I really like them and can't wait to make them again. Thanks
