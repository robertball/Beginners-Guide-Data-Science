Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars.  Very simple to prepare with a good combo of flavors....just not over the top.  Just enough "zip" to make it interesting.  Only thing I added was a little more garlic (because there is no such thing as too much garlic) and a splash of kitchen bouquet to enhance the gravy.  Otherwise I follwed to the tee and served over creamy grits.  Husband and son were pleased!

This dish was easy to prepare although i didnt have all the spicy ingredients in the recipe but then we dont spicy in my house. I loved that the ham was drowned out by sausage and shrimp! Hey trying to eat up leftover ham and this dish made sure it was ham was not the main star! My hubby liked it so I'd make it again! Any new dish from leftovers wins in my book! Like others add more garlic!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  Used garbanzo flour to make it lower in carbs and served over mashed sweet potatoes.  DH was practically licking his bowl.  Thanks for another super recipe.

I was excited about trying this. It was okay but not great. I guess it's a matter of personal taste. It was too spicy for me. I tried it over grits (which I love) and I struggled through dinner and didn't eat very much of it. My husband barely ate his. If you love spice, you'll probably give it a higher rating than I did. I do have to say that the ham added a nice flavor to the recipe making it a little easier for me to eat as much as I did. Maybe I'll give it another try and leave out the jalapeno and cut down on the cajun spice.

We have always LOVED shrimp and grits and have tried many, many recipes.  Today I tried this one since I had all the ingredients...even fresh jalapeno and some leftover ham.   The video was very helpful because I don't usually cook things in butter enough but this turned out just like Chef John showed us.   We really loved it and served it on grits with a little sharp cheddar added.  Very easy and very good....  This is definitely a keeper!

Good but not great. Kinda salty, as someone else mentioned. Definitely should be served with rice instead of grits, as Chef John said in the video. Not sure if Iâ€™ll make again but it is definitely worth your trying.

Made this for the second time tonight. The first time we had it over rice, tonight over butter grits. It was very good both ways. I end up using more flour than the recipe calls for because I like a thicker gravy, and precooked shrimp because that's what I always have on hand. The jalapeno gives it a nice little bite. It's not a dish I would have monthly, but still will make again for a nice change of pace.

Excellent!!! I can't wait to make it again!! I couldn't get the sauce to thicken, so I made a small roux and added it to the finished dish and cooked it for a few more minutes. The flavor was awesome. No need to add the salt or ceyanne pepper. I served it on top of mashed potatoe, but it may even be better on rice.

We thought this was very good.  I had some large shrimp I wanted to use up and a little bit of ham.  This was the perfect solution.  Our version was a bit spicy because I make my own Cajun seasoning and it leans toward the hot side.  I also did cut back on the broth a bit and finish the gravy with a little heavy cream - like it needed more richness, but it was awesome atop some creamy grits.  Classic southern Shrimp and Grits (from a Northerners perspective anyway).  This would also work well over rice or pasta.

This was amazing.....I put a splash of lemon juice in and used pickled jalapenos along with 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion.  I used one large green bell pepper and it was wonderful.  I will cook this over and over!!!! Thanks
