I made this! It was very disappointing. It was a crumble mess, not enough moister and too much flour! It needs egg yokes and less flour!

This recipe is wrong, way too much coconut flour.  It was nothing but a crumble mess

Failure!
Dough was crumbly.  Missing something.  
Should this have had egg-yolks as the photo is much more yellow in color then the resulting dough.
Baked anyway and it crumbled.
Crumbs had good flavor. Will salvage food by using it with home-made granola.

This did not work at all. As soon as I introduced the oil, applesauce and honey into the fluffy egg whites the whole thing deflated. I tried to finish it up and bake, but it came out thin and very dry. Sad.
