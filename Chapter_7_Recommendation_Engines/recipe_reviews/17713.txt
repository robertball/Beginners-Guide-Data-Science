While this may be delicious in certain uses, if you are looking for the Spice Islands version of Beau Monde, this is not what you want.  Spice Islands' own website states their seasoning is a blend of salt, celery and onion.  I am giving this a 3 because it was the only way I could leave a review to let people know this, and, as I said, it may indeed be good for some things.

I didn't have the celery seed or mace, perhaps that what did it, but the cloves overpowered everything.  Be careful.

Wish I'd read this first.  I agree that all you can taste is the overpowering chives!  I had some Beau Monde purchased from Bulk Barn in Canada, but they don't sell it anymore.  It was fabulous. Thankfully I have a tbsp of the original to compare the smell to.
 This was nowhere near it!

I added a teaspoon of ground cloves and allspice instead of the tablespoons called for, because they are the strongest spices. This mix is definitely great and woke up my palate! TASTY! Better than store bought. Added it to Bloody Marys and deviled eggs- NICE! Thank you so much for sharing!

I really don't like this seasoning combo and I had to buy some expensive spices to make it. Won't do again.

I made up this recipe and cut back on the ground cloves.  As a seasoned cook it was easy to see that this would be way too much.  This recipe is not anything like the Beau Monde you can buy in the grocery store.  I was very disappointed in the results and had to buy a bottle of the real thing to compare.  When you read the ingredients on the Beau Monde jar the ingredients listed are, salt, dextrose, onion and celery seed.  I think the author of this recipe got the name of it confused with another seasoning. As I have to select a star rating I am selecting the lowest.

This IS a Beau Monde, or Beautiful World blend of spices, and a good one. I am used to a slightly mellower, redder version and I figured out that an added tablespoon of Hungarian paprika to this recipe balances the whole thing out to my liking. Try it. 
     If you are used to the Spice Island version be warned this recipe is nothing like that "blend" of salt, sugar(dextrose),onion and celery seed(and silicone dioxide, a flavorless mineral meant to prevent caking). But comparing that version to the real thing is like comparing Taco Bell hot sauce to a real Mexican salsa. Just the truth of the matter.
     I love this on salmon and red meat.

I made this "Beau Monde" to use in a vegetable dip and the cloves, cinnamon and allspice were overpowering.  Next time I'll pay the $6 and buy the real stuff

This was much like the beau monde seasoning my grandma used to use. It brought back fond memories--Thank you!

Made this exactly like the recipe, against my better judgement. It definately isn't the same as the Spice Island Beau Monde spice. This recipe has too much pepper and no onion. Won't make this again, next time I'm traveling, I'll look for the Spice Island brand since it isn't carried in my area.

I definitely agree w/all the reviews that said this does NOT have the same taste as Spice Island's Beau Monde seasoning.  Since I have not been able to find this seasoning locally, I decided to give this recipe a try, mainly because it looked the same.  I used the seasoning in my go-to Dill Dip for a family function. I'll continue searching for either the recipe or the spice in my travels.

Fabulous! Unlike other reviewers I found this to be very much like the seasoning I used to buy, but can no longer find! Try it in macaroni salad- you won't be disappointed!

Don't mistake this for the real beau monde spice or it could be disastrous  in certain recipes.

This is not the original, neither is the Spice Island brand Beau Monde. I lost my recipe and tried this instead-way too much pepper and not enough bay or celery seedI think. This may be great on beef but not in the dip or chicken recipes from when I was a kid. I continue to look for the recipe at home and online.
