Delicious and declared a keeper by the whole family.  Too rainy to grill so I brushed flatbread with olive oil, topped with sliced sausage and some feta cheese (Monterey jack for my son who dislikes feta) and broiled just until bread was lightly browned and sausage warmed. Salsa was yummy but I think Iâ€™d make it a couple of hours ahead next time to let the flavours blend a bit more.

This is a must try!  So So Good!  My son was very hesitant about trying this as he dislikes fruit with meat but even he gave it rave reviews!
