Please note:  For the frosting to come out right, you need to add 1 tbl of milk.  I tried making the frosting twice, throwing out the first attempt because it looked awful, very lumpy and the butter was leaking out.  The second time I figured something must be off in the recipe.  All it took was a splash of milk for the frosting to smooth out and it turned out perfectly.  Overall, the cake is wonderful.  The taste is much subtler than what I was expecting, and isn't too sweet.  The frosting really gives it the candy taste.  I made cupcakes out of this recipe, cooking them for 20 minutes, and they turned out beautifully!  Yielded 4 dozen cupcakes and they were gone in a flash.  Will definitely make again.

Great cake, followed the recipe exactly. I did'nt make the frosting but I don't think this cake really needed one anyway!
