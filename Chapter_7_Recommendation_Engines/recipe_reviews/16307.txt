This was a hit with my husband! He prefers raspberries to cherries so I bought a package of frozen raspberries and followed the directions on the back to make a sauce using sugar and a little lemon juice. After it cooled I spread it over the cream cheese mix and dolloped the whip cream. It was so tasty! I think i will try it with the strawberries too! Also, i used a betty crocker sugar cookie mix instead of the premade dough. It was half the price and just as tasty!! thanks for the recipe!

This is really fun and easy!  Something the kids can really help with.  Cherry's maybe a little messy but mom can do that or clean up the kids.  :-)

This isn't the best dessert I've ever had, but it is VERY good, and isn't hard to make at all!  For the effort required, it is definitely 5 stars.

This was a Valentine hit! Hubby is not much of a sweet eater and he went back for seconds and thirds! Although the cookie base is sweet, the pie filling and cool whip seem to offset the sweet. Really easy to put together. Thanks for the recipe!

This took almost TWO cans of cherry pie filling to cover. And unless eaten immediately, there is not way to "store" it!  It will feed FAR more than 9 people too!

This was super easy to make. The end result was just ok....we didn't really care for it very much. I would probably not make this again.

These were easy and delicious. I used strawberry and blueberry pie filling instead of the cherry and they turned out great!

This was awesome! My boyfriend and I enjoyed this part of our Valetine's Day the most.  It was so simple, and tasted so great! He loves vanilla ice cream, so he warmed the cookies, put the frosting on one, then made an ice cream sandwich out of two cookies.  Then he added the remainder of the ingrediants..it was fabulous! Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my yum! We loved this dessert last night as the delicious ending to our Valentine's day dinner. Thank you Cher for this super simple recipe! Thank you natalieann for your review and mentioning the Betty Crocker sugar cookie mix...I just happened to have some in the cupboard and it was so much cheaper than the tube of cookie dough. 

I didn't have any cherry pie filling, but did have those frozen triple berries from Costco, so I made pie filling from this recipe: Mix together in a sauce pan 1/3 cup water, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp Corn Starch, 1 Tbsp strawberry jello powder,  1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 cup frozen berries. Cook on medium until thickened (let it boil for a minute while stirring constantly). Remove from heat. Add 1 1/4 cups frozen berries to this hot mixture and stir well to combine. This will cool the hot mixture and defrost the frozen berries. Let this pie filling meld on your counter for 10-15 minutes then stir once more and spread on your dessert. This made the perfect amount.

Enjoy!!

This is a great dessert.  I made this for a summer party, so I didn't shape the cookie dough into a heart-I just rolled it out into a rectangle on the cookie sheet.  Everyone really liked it-it is rich and delicious.

The receipe is as promised.  But I couldn't taste the cream cheese at all.  It was all cookie and cherries.  My husband
liked it.

This is extremely easy and you can use different kinds of fruit (I tried kiwi, strawberry, mandarin oranges) instead of cherry pie filling to make a fruit pizza using this recipe.

This tasted delicious! Just donâ€™t double your cookie dough! I made this mistake and had a major overflow in my oven. I was able to salvage it and it was a big hit, but it will save you some clean up if you stick with one package ... or make sure you put it in a pan with sides.

This was simple and my grandkids loved it. We ate half and it was sent good the next day because the cookie got mushy and it was so much better when it was still firm. I served it a couple hours after making it. Be sure you eat the whole thing and you will be happy.
