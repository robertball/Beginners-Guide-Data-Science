I also have used this recipe for years. I do it a little differently though which helps with the crusty bread. I cut the crusts off the bread and then cut the bread slices in half diagonally. Then I roll them up so they look like swaddled babies. They are wonderful at baby showers and the smaller sizes really help with the texture.

These were soooooo well received by the residents I cook for and no idea that they were made with inexpensive white bread! However I did cut back on the cinnamon by only using 2 Tbs. Will definately keep this one in my files. Thank you Cookie

These are so yummy! I tried one from a local coffee shop and thought I'd have to figure it out on my own but here is the recipe! My family is going to love this special treat or "feshal fweat" as my oldest would say when she was 2!

Very good! I never would have believed it if I hadn't tried it myself. Something so easy and I always have those ingredients on hand. These turned out crispy and had a wonderful texture from the broiled/baked sugar and then the creamy center of cream cheese. Thanks these are wonderful!

Not as good as I was hoping. They were tasty. The filling was very good. I didn't really like the texture of the break once cooked though. It became rather crunchy.

I didn't really care for these but my friend (who I made them for) really liked them. She says that the crispy outercrust goes really well with the creamy center. They made the kitchen smell great. Thanks for the post Amy.

I personally thought they were just ok but a couple of my co-workers just loved them. The couldn't believe it was just normally white bread. The filling is really good but they are a little on the crispy side so maybe I will not cook them as long.

These were easy enough to make and I thought they tasted pretty good. I made them for the ladies in our office for Ex Asst day and only about half of them got eaten.......not sure why.

These were really good. I drizzled powdered sugar icing on them and they were over the top. I made them with honey wheat bread because it's all I had and I absolutely had to try this recipe. Next time I'll definitely make them with white Bunny sandwich bread.

Very very easy to make with little ingredients! My husband loved it as is but I personally thought it was way too buttery so next time I'm going to try something less heavy for the cinnamon sugar crusting. Otherwise great and Fantastic that you can freeze it until you want it!

I've made it four times now... This last time the bread was too brittle to roll so made them into little cinnamon square sandwiches. What my family really loves is the pudding I throw together with the remains of all these ingredients - bread crusts butter cinnamon sugar cream cheese mixture plus some custard nuts and whipped or fresh cream. I layer them all up pop in the oven at 125 C for about 20 minutes till the top is a nice golden brown. You can vary the flavour of custard toss in fresh fruit or jelly crystals for different outcomes!

Soo yummy! Next time I'll roll the bread. I did make one tiny change...Instead of using melted butter for the coating I used honey. Definitely saving this one in my file!
