I liked it, but the kid and hubby didn't like the texture of the kiwifruit seeds in the drink.  Was refreshing - I added some cream of coconut too, and that was very yummy. Not the best success, but a good way of using honeydew up.

This was definitely refreshing! My husband's first reaction was "this would be great on a hot summer day" I didn't have honey and definitely think that would give it a much better sweet kick!
