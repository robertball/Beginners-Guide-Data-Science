I forgot to add the parsley!  I did cut back on the swiss cheese, used onion powder in place of minced onion.  This was good for a neutral bread addition to an italian soup.. I prefer some of the other bruschetta recipes on this site made with fresh tomatoes added.  If I make this again I will try it that way.

This sounded delicious, but I didn't have sour cream, parsley, or green onion on hand, so I substituted a little extra mayo for the sour cream, regular onion for the green, and left out the parsley.  I also didn't have swiss cheese, just a mild cheddar blend, but this turned out delicious.  I think my husband ate half the loaf!! The fresh ground black pepper on top at the end really gave it a nice zing. Will definitely make again.

this recipe is great for entertaining! i do double the wet ingredients so i can really put a heaping tablespoon full on each slice of toast.  also, i usually just buy the cream cheese with chives in it instead of buying a while bunch of green onions since i don't use the whole thing.

This stuff was GREAT I just reheated a couple of left bites and it's still good! I didn't have any swiss cheese so I just added a 5 Italian blend from Kraft. Left out the parsley and onions too... don't like onions and didn't have parsley.  It was so easy. I'll have this one often.

I made this for a small dinner party last night and they were gone in a flash.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did cut the ingredients in half as there were only 6 of us.  The only thing I would change is that next time, I would not put the bread/cheese mixture so close to the broiler as the cheese starts to brown, but even though it's heated through, it's not quite melted.  Thanks for a great/different recipe!

This recipe is just so delicious!  I got it off this website about 6-8 months ago and it's a favorite among my friends - I'm suprised it only has 5 reviews and only 4 stars!!! I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

I'm not sure why I didn't like this. Perhaps I overdid it with the cheese mixture on top. Or I don't like cream cheese heated up and spread on a piece of bread. I've got nothing bad to say about it. Just wasn't working for me. It is a different approach to make bruschetta. It's interesting. Thanks for sharing and I don't regret trying it.

I used bleu cheese instead of Swiss, and multi-grain bread instead of French bread, because I had to use them before they went bad. I did not use low fat ingredients. Scrumptious! You can't get much easier and quicker than this recipe! Love it! I made the cheese spread and prepared the bread ahead of time. I cut the bread into bite size pieces and crusted it in the oven at 200 degrees for one hour. When it was time to serve, I heated the cheese in the microwave and used it as a dip for the bread. The reason I did it this way is because I took it to a dinner party.
