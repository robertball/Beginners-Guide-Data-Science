This was really nice and refreshing! Iâ€™d definitely like to make it again. Thanks for the idea of putting these two drinks together.

A very different drink indeed. The tart lime and spicy tea combination really blend well together. I made ice cubes out of some of the tea and lime juice so this helped keep the tea tasty as well as cool while it sat. I used rock cane sugar crystals instead of white sugar and made up my own chai blend. Definitely an extraordinary drink for a summer day. Thank you MitchJGray for your recipe.
