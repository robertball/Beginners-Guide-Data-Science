I was in the middle of making taco salad and realized I was all out of Catalina dressing. Found this recipe and made it, substituting apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar. Family said it was the best taco salad they've ever had. Score!!

This gave me a good base to adapt my own recipe. I used olive oil, stevia and sugar free ketchup. Thanks for posting.

This is a nice dressing, although I think it tastes more like French dressing rather than Catalina (lucky us, we like both!).  Certainly is simple enough to mix up, and I agree, Samy, homemade's always better.

Good flavor. Used celery salt vs celery flakes, because I didn't have any. Added 1 tsp mayo to help hold emulsion.

This was delicious and tasted almost exactly like the bottled dressing.   It took a couple seconds to mix it up,  I had everything in the house.  Is not as red as the bottled dressing.  I used Apple Cider Vinegar, Vegetable oil and also added a little garlic powder.  My husband loved it,  I'll definitely make this again!

It isn't as dark orange as the Catalina's I have  used before but a very pretty color none the less.  It literally took me three minutes to have this blended and ready for dinner.  Tangy and sweet.  I will make it again.

I had the recipe using a zero calorie catchup, Mrs. Dash extra spicy, and evoo. I thickened it with xanthan gum and I omitted the sweetener and I got compliments and people wanting the recipe.

I didn't have quite all the ingredients... I substitued celery seed for the celery flakes, garlic powder instead of onion powder, and basil instead of italian seasoning.  Very pleased with the way this turned out! So close to bottled! I'll be making this often!!

Better than shop bought because you control the sugar content.

Delicious recipe.  I used a blend in equal parts red wine vinegar and braggs apple cider.  Used smoke paprika instead of regular, and added about 1/3 of a small red onion.  Pulverized in my la machine.  Perfect for our chicken salad tonight!

A tad bit more vinager-y than I remember but it was very tasty on my burger and avocado slices. I liked that I could make it with out unneeded additives.

I used white vinegar.  Didn't change anything.  My family loved this recipe.  Don't think I will ever buy store bought again.

Very similar to the bottle store brand!  I made a double batch in my Ninja today to pour over my Sombrero Pasta salad. It's now Chillin'  in the fridge!  I've made this before, just didn't post.

I scaled to 1 serving as I just needed a few tbsps to make a copycat Big Mac sauce.
I found it too sweet and oily, next time I would halve the sugar and oil.
It definitely needs a little salt as well as it was flat.
Good in a pinch as it uses pantry ingredients.

This turned out well. I needed a quick dressing. Used a splash of honey instead of the sugar, olive oil and herbes de provence as that was the closest I had.

I thought the ratio of vinegar to oil was a little off, so I added an additional 1/4 cup of oil. This is a good base for red salad dressings.  I'll definitely make it again.
