I thought this recipe was good. But I didn't LOVE it. My husband did though! He was mm mm mm all through dinner LOL. He's a huge fan of lime though. It certainly had the sour lime kick. I would definately recommend cooking the sauce longer than the recipe calls for.. It really thickened up after about 15 minutes or so. Also.. (which I'm sure you would figure) seasoning the chicken a little with s&p and some garlic salt is a must!

This recipe was very quick and easy and very delicious!! I made it with thin cut chicken breasts which I sauteed for 2-3 minutes on each side. If I were using regular chicken breasts, I'd probably marinate them in little apple juice and lime juice for a while so that the flavor would penetrate. I wil defintely make this again!!

My chicken got sort of burned by just using cooking spray, so next time I'll definitely add some olive or vegetable oil to the pan.  I loved the lime flavor, though, and this was so easy so I'll definitely try it again.

I enjoyed this recipe, and would make it again.  The sauce is just thick enough, and has a nice tangy flavor.  White rice goes well with this.

I found this to be an ok dish.  It was easy to make, but only tasted so-so.  It was a little too sour/tangy for my daughters, but it was ok for me.  I found that by cooking the sauce a little longer, it thickened up more.

This was good! The sauce was a little runny, so make sure lime sauce goes with your side dish (like asparagus), or put this chicken on its own plate. I highly recommend it!

This was VERY GOOD! I took another reviewer's advice and marinated the chicken breasts in apple/lime juice. I also seasoned the chicken with S&P and garlic powder. I also cut up the chicken and served it on rice. My husband liked it too, so I will definitely make this again! The only thing I will change next time is that I will double the sauce, as we would have liked to have more.

My husband, 6 year old, and I loved it.  I will make this again.  I put garlic powder, salt and pepper on chicken while cooking.  I cooked the sauce for quite a while.. until it was very thick.  It is very unique, easy, and delicious.  I would recommend it, and I would make it again.

Really easy to make and tastes great with a side of mashed potatoes or steamed veggies.

Meal was good but not my favorite, a little too sour for me. Missing something also, just can't put my finger on it.
