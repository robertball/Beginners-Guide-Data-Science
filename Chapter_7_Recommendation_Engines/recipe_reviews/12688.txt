I used fresh bing cherries instead of canned. It was a great way to use a lot of cherries and it tasted really good.

I made one of these today to taste test tonight before making them to sell. It is great! The taste testers next door said it passed with flying colors. I know it passed mine! Thanks for a great recipe!:-))))

This is great! I'd been looking for a good recipe with bing cherries after I accidentally bought some for baking cherry pie (which is better with sour cherries). Definitely fit the bill.:-)

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner as the second pie...first was pumpkin. No one like it. It just didn't taste that good. Sorry.
