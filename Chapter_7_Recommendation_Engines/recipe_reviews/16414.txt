This was good but I have to agree that the dressing seemed to be missing something.  I added some soy sauce, crushed garlic, fresh lime juice and chopped cilantro to give this salad a bit of an extra "kick".  It got rave reviews!

Even if you try this only once...it will totally win you over!  This is an excellent salad to bring to potlucks, summer games, or a light salad with a sandwich at home.  Friends ask me to make this over and over and over (my boyfriend is getting tired of it only because it is "requested" everywhere we go!).  Extremely easy, can't mess it up.  The longer it sits in the fridge, the better it gets.  I put it in a Rubbermaid and turn it over every couple of hours until ready to eat.  You won't be able to put it back in the fridge.  TO DIE FOR!  Oh, and DON'T cook the ramen noodles first!  Crush them up and add them...they will absorb the liquid in the recipe.  Yum!

I used regular coleslaw mix instead of broccoli coleslaw and sliced almonds instead of peanuts.  This is best when you keep the slaw/green onion mixture, the sunflower seeds/almonds/ramen noodles mixture and the dressing separate until serving time (much better when it's crunchy, but it's still pretty good when the noodles and nuts get soggy).  It will stay somewhat crunchy for about 12 hours after mixing together.  SO good!

I made this dish for my best friend's 30th birthday celebration themed "Brunch on the Beach" and it was a hit!! I followed the directions precisely except for minor changes. Instead of using vegetable oil, chicken flavored noodles and peanuts,I used toasted sesame oil, oriental flavored ramen noodles and added sliced almonds.  The toasted sesame oil definately enhanced the flavor. And I did not cook the noodles prior to adding them to the salad. I enjoy cooking but I don't like spending all day chopping or being in the kitchen so this recipe was amazingly easy and my kind of "cooking"; a palate pleaser. I will definately make this dish again.

I loved the salad, but had to make it twice. I wished the recipe said to cook the ramen noodles first! I guess since I was new to this ingredient, I didn't think to cook them first. My first batch had crunchy noodles! Thanks for the recipe!

If I hadn't tasted this recipe made by someone else first, I'd have been seriously sceptical about the uncooked Ramen noodles. But, honestly, you DON'T cook them! Just break them up and toss them in. It's supposed to add crunch to the salad. Some alternate versions of this recipe saute the noodles in butter but that's just to add flavor not to soften them. The dressing will be absorbed by the noodles.

A package of broccoli slaw costs $2.98 a bag. I got a couple of crowns of broccoli for .98 a LB, grabbed 2 carrots and a nice purple onion for color. I also got 6 packs of Raman  for a buck! I had several choices for the vinegar, I went with Malt vinegar, I figured I could use it on my fish and chips in the future. Great Kick for said fried fish btw. Hee Hee. I went home, rough chopped the crowns, shredded the carrots and sliced the onion real thin. I found a small bag of roasted almonds in the cabinet, Score! This salad is just the Best tasting, sweet and tangy!  I baked some chicken and I put that on the salad. Excellent lite lunch or super simple dinner!!:) Thank you Effie and Jarmen, from the bottom of my stuffed belly. This Rocks:)

Great! I tweaked a little - I don't add peanuts, I add 1/4 cup chopped red onion, chopped celery, toasted sesame seeds, a few splashes sesame oil, and some wasabi powder to the sauce (for zip). I even put in red bell pepper, cabbage, and ginger powder if I'm feeling it. Only use one ramen package (oriental flavor), 1/8 cup sugar (actually splenda sugar/sweetner mix), mix natural rice vinegar with the cider vinegar. We love the end result - but I would definitely follow the recipe as it's written if I were serving to a large group.

I served this at a BBQ recently and it was a huge hit!  Lots of requests for the recipe.  It's really important to add the peanuts an sunflower seeds right before serving otherwise they'll get too soggy.

This is one of my favorite salads to make.  Since I am a college student, it is very affordable and more healthy than some other foods.  The only things I do differently is: use beef flavored Ramen, Virgin Olive Oil, and Almond Slivers.  Overall, this is a great recipe for any type of budget.

This recipe is GREAT! The only thing wrong with it is that it has you put raw Ramen noodles in. The REAL TRICK is to toast them in the oven or on the stove top for a few minutes so that they stay crunchy, at least until your second or third bowl ;) I always add some shredded rotisserie chicken to this for a complete and satisfying meal.

This is one of my very favorites, been making this for about a year now. To make it even easier, simply buy Paul Newmans low fat Sesame Ginger salad dressing, very yummy...

This salad is positively divine!  It was a hit at a picnic pitch-in, last night!  I tweaked it a little, using mandarin oranges, cashews, and a few drops of sesame oil...very little left...husband took it for lunch, today!  Thank you!

I, too, made some changes to this recipe because I wanted to use what I already had “on hand” in my kitchen.  I did have to purchase the fresh veggies, but when I saw that broccoli slaw was $3.49 for 10 ounces, I opted for the Cole slaw at $1.80 for 16 ounces, and bought broccoli florets at 10 cents an ounce.  I used the 16 ounces of Cole slaw and added 10 ounces of finely chopped broccoli florets.  Instead of chicken flavored ramen, I used the oriental ramen (for which I originally paid 20 cents per package), adding the seasoning packet to my dressing mix.  I am allergic to onions, so I substituted ½ tsp garlic powder for the bunch of green onions, and added that to my dressing instead of putting in with the slaw and noodles.  I had sunflower seeds, Planter’s Pistachio Grove Blend and McCormick Salad Toppings, so I added ¼ cup (coarsely chopped) each of these to the chilled salad just before serving. I already had Hendrickson’s Sweet Vinegar and Olive Oil Dressing, so I used ½ cup of that instead of the sugar, vegetable oil and cider vinegar.

This is one my very favorite salads.It's always a hit wherever I take it. I use one packet of Oriental (or Teriyaki) noodles and one packet of chicken. Note: DON"T cook the noodles first.  Just break them up into fairly small pieces while still in the package and dump them in! They may be a little crunchy, but this is part of the special appeal of this salad. The noodles will continue to absorb liquid from the other ingredients and "soften" after awhile.(But even with soft noodles the next day, leftovers are still good to me!) I also use almonds (slivered or sliced), instead of peanuts, along with sunflower kernels.

I toasted the noodles with a bit of butter and added part of the seasoning pack to the noodles and the rest  to the dressing. I used half veg oil, half sesame oil (used a smidge short of 1/4c)

Really good basic recipe but high in unnecessary saturated fat!!  
Omitted the oil in the dressing and used 1/2 the mayo.  Browned the nuts (I used slivered almonds) and crushed ramen noodles in a dry pan until golden brown. 
Add fresh cracked pepper and let marinade overnight. Beautiful!  You won't miss the added fat...

I have made this recipe several times now and it is really good and easy! The things I do differently: add cilantro; use less onions; add sesame oil to dressing; use brown sugar instead of white; break-up ramen and cook (seasoning packet optional), then add to salad. I have also made this with left over sliced chicken breast. I imagine you could also use tofu for a healthy vegetarian meal with some protein.

Loved this easy to make salad.  Served with Grilled Salmon recipe and white rice.  A few mods:  only used one package Ramen noodles (and it was plenty crunchy).  Halved the sugar, too.  I think a 1/2 cup would have been way too sweet!  Don't dress until just before you serve, or noodles will get soggy.  If you want leftovers, dress each portion separately.

This is delicious!  It is so fast and easy.  And I do not even like broccoli at ALL!  I substituted the nuts listed with chopped pecans, and I cut back a tad on the sugar.  EASY EASY EASY FAST FAST FAST GOOD GOOD GOOD! Now that's my kind of appetizer.  Thanks for the recipe :)

My whole family loves this salad.  It is really addicting.  I have tried it with shredded cabbage as well as broccoli coleslaw, and it is almost as good. The recipe is easy and it tastes good the next day also.  Beyond that, it doesn't hold up well.  There isn't much left by then anyway, since the husband and boys go by the refrigerator and get a little periodically.

So easy and quick to make.  I let it sit overnight so the noodles would soak up the liquid and not be so crunchy.  It was FANTASTIC!!  I used a suggestion on a previous review saying use sliced almonds instead of peanuts, perfect idea!  Looking forward to making this dish for a party.

This is a very good recipe and my 21 year old daughter loved it.  However we didn't really care for the peanuts so we just put only sunflower seeds.  Broccoli will not wilt so easy so it is better than shredded cabbage for sure.  Also I drizzled sesame oil in the end.  This would give a little more flavor.  :-)

I've made this recipe for years but I use red wine vinegar and only 1/4 c. of sugar and sunflower kernels only...no peanuts.  Very important not to cook the noodles first!

This took me longer to eat than make. Simply yummy. I made the following changes based on personal taste:
Only used 1 seasoning packet (afraid it would be too salty). Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup. 
Substitute whole almonds for peanuts & olive oil for  veggie oil. Might used rice vinegar & even less sugar next time.

I make this as a main dish salad by adding chicken and tossing it in raspberry vinaigrette instead of the sugar, oil and vinegar. Also, sometimes I add mandarin orange pieces. Super yummy, easy, light and great for summer!

A big hit at the graduation party!  I made the dressing the day before.  Next time I will cut down on the noodles and also give them a chance to marinade in the dressing or make sure I separate and crunch them up to avoid 'clumps' of noodles.  Even though I love peanuts and sunflower seeds, they really put the calorie count over the top so I will cut down on them as well.  I don't think I used all the dressing either so I was glad I made it separately.  Maybe I'll try some splenda to cut down the sugar calories.  Otherwise, fabulous for people who love broccoli but who are not crazy about mayo-based salads.

I used about 7oz of whole wheat spaghetti broken into small pieces and cooked. I made the dressing but only used half. I got 8 servings out of it at 2 points for Weight Watchers. With the nuts and seeds that added 2 more points but so worth it

This was way too sweet for my family and my taste.  If I was to make again, I would double the soya, and drastically reduce the sugar.

This is a salad that pleases everyone !
I thought it needed just a little more seasoning so I added in 2 tsp. of sesame oil and 1 Tbsp. of soy sauce, black pepper, and a couple dashes of garlic powder.
I have also added chopped cilantro, and for protein salads, some shredded chicken.
Delicious !

Every time I take this to a party, I am hounded for the recipe!  It is a wonderful alternative to the traditional pasta salads.  I used rice vinegar and sesame oil to give it more of an Asian flare.   I used soy nuts instead of the peanuts.  Additionally, I blanched some broccoli and sugar snap peas and added them to it.  Fabulous!

I'm sorry to disagree with the other positive reviews but we didn't care for this much. We LOVE broccoli but did not care for the texture/taste of the broccoli coleslaw mix. I MIGHT try this again with the pre-packaged, regular coleslaw mix as I like the idea and the dressing "flavor" wasn't bad. Since most of this was passed over after a few bites and my soup didn't exactly turn out, we tossed what was left and found a pizza instead. Thanks anyways.

Very good, with changes.  I have had it prepared as directed by the recipe, but this is a much better dish with some easy additions.  I used a package of broccoli coleslaw and a bag of angel hair cabbage.  Added extra veggies to give the flavor more depth and added nutrition(chopped red and yellow pepper, half a red onion, minced garlic, minced GINGER and cilantro).  I like the more veg less noodle version.  Also did half sesame oil, soy sauce crushed red pepper and added a big squeeze of lime.  TO DIE FOR.  Do not cook the noodles, it is a waste of time and makes it too limp and wet.

A great refreshing summer side salad!  We prefer this one using the chicken flavored ramen noodles over the beef flavored, as the beef always seemed too salty.  I'm often asked for this recipe or to bring it to a picnic.  Definitely a 5 star!!

This is a great salad, although I did make some changes.  I used red wine vinegar instead of cider and slivered almonds instead of peanuts.  My family loves this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I only used 1/4 Cup of sugar as I am diabetic. I also added a bit of sesame oil and some soy sauce as others suggested. I had to omit the peanuts as one of my guests is allergic. We never missed them. Thanks so much for the recipe! I think next time I might make this with the Oriental style Ramen noodles just to see the difference.

Loved this salad! I toasted the ramen in a little butter, halved the sugar, added a few shakes of soy sauce and sesame oil, and added some minced garlic..I also added the two seasoning packets from the ramen to the dressing. Next time I will reduce the amount of nuts by half.

This was excellent. Easy to fix. I did not put the peanuts or sunflower seeds in when I made it. I put them on the table so the guests could add them to their serving of salad.

I made some minor changes that really work for me.  I usually only make 1/2 the recipe listed here, use oriental ramen seasoning instead of chicken seasoning and silvered almonds instead of peanuts.  I mix up the noodles, broccoli, nuts and seeds in a gallon baggie, then pour the dressing in. Leave in the refrig overnight, turning the baggie occasionally.

GREAT Recipe to have in your arsenal. When I make this, I do a couple of things differently. 1st...I use two bags of broccoli slaw, and one package of BEEF Ramen noodles. I also add two tablespoons of soy to the dressing. Lastly I use slivered almonds instead of peanuts. DO NOT COOK the noodles.  They are suppossed to be crushed and added to the salad uncooked! One more thing...i mix the dressing and add it to the slaw & green onions and let it sit for a while in the fridge but I dont add in the noodles and nuts etc until about 30 min before serving.

We didn't love this, unfortunately. I added a little toasted sesame oil to it, which helped the flavor a bit. I used almonds instead of peanuts (personal preference) and sprinkled some poppy seeds on top for funsies. It was just a little too strong on the vinegar for our tastes. Thanks :)

I LOVE this salad!  My mom has made it for years, it's a family favorite.  When I make it, I like to leave the broken up Ramen noodles out of the salad mixture but serve them on the side.  Each person can sprinkle them on top of their serving to add crunch.  That way when you eat leftovers the next day you don't just have soggy noodles in your salad.

This is a great salad.  The noodles are not meant to be cooked, but it really depends on your own preference.  I like them crunchy.  The only thing I do differently is to use toasted almonds instead of peanuts and rainbow salad, because it has cauliflower added to the mix.

Really, really good. Like the others I ommitted the peanuts and sunflower seeds (mostly because I don't like nuts in my salad). My store was also out of the broccoli slaw, so I picked up a mix of broccoli and cabbage slaw. Worked out great! Everybody really liked this recipe. I put the uncooked noodles in the bowl in the morning and served the salad the evening, and the noodles weren't crunch at all. I think I would have rather of had them crunch so I will add just an hour or so before serving. I think some fresh cilantro would have been a nice addition too. Great recipe though!

Simply delish!  I used Splenda in place of the sugar and added sesame seeds and a bit of sesame oil.  Cashews are nice instead of peanuts too!

Light & different. Better the second day and keeps for several days. Left out the nuts & sunflower seeds due to allergies, and it was still excellent. I was concerned about using uncooked noodles but they softened right up. I'll definitely make this again

I always make this for family gatherings. If you make this salad the night before and put in a container with a lid and shake a few times before serving, the dressing coats the noodles and they soften up on their own. Don't cook the noodles! I also add the nuts just before serving so they stay crunchy. I use sesame seeds and cashews. Yummy!

This does taste really good but it is loaded with calories and fat! It comes in at 527 calories per serving! Despite the veggies, the oil, sugar, and sunflower seeds (818 calories per cup!), make it less than healthy. Just be aware of this before you serve it as a healthful side dish.

I have made this for years and love this recipe, but I always use either the Oriental flavored ramen or the pork flavored.  It gives it a richer taste.

We enjoy this quite frequently. Easy, tasty way to add broccoli to a meal. I prefer using rice vinegar to the apple cider. Seems to taste fresher.  My only addition is that I add one of the seasoning packets from the noodles to the dressing. I don't use the peanuts. Sometimes I add a small canned of mandarin oranges, drained.

Great salad I used almonds instead of peanuts and seasoned with garlic, rice vinegar.  I made a double batch for a party  hoping for leftovers but, there was none left. I too left the nuts and seeds until I was ready to serve.

Made this for my boyfriend and his buddy. I got this response from his buddy" SHE'S A KEEPER!!" That sealed the deal. I used the oriental flavor ramen and it worked just as well. I also sprinkled sesame seeds on the top and added madarin oranges. The boys were drinking the dressing when they got to the bottom of the bowl!!! DO NOT COOK THE NOODLES...They will absorb the liquid. Good luck

This was good.  I used 3 Large broccoli heads (without the florets) and shredded them.  I also used enough matchstick carrots so that the ratio of broccoli to carrots was 2 to 1.  I mixed everything minus the noodles and nuts and let it chill in the fridge for a couple hours.  Be sure to break up your dry noodles really well before adding them and the nuts in at about 20 minutes before serving.

SO SO SO GOOD.  After reading the other reviews, I made these changes - only one stalk of green onion with 1/2 of an red onion, chopped.  Almonds instead of peanuts & olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Will definitely make this again and probably won't try another recipe.  Hit and not a miss!

My whole family loves this salad! We do make it a little differently, however. I chop up a small head of napa cabbage and add it to the cole slaw mix. I also omit the green onions and peanuts. This is a salad that is often requested, even for birthday meals! It is so easy and tasty!

This is a great salad, but you're supposed to add the raman noodle flavor packets (I use chicken) to the dressing.  A couple of people had mentioned that it seemed to be "missing something."  That's it.

Great recipe.  Have used a very similar one for years.  I use approx 1/2 c sunflower seeds and 1/2 c slivered almonds instead of peanuts and like the roasted chicken Ramen soup the best.    Very easy and very quick.

Really crunchy and delicious.  Nice change from typical salad.  Used coleslaw, one package of ramen noodles, pumpkin seeds and did half the sugar to 1/4 cup.  No cider vinegar, instead a  splash of vinegar. Also splash of sesame oil which does enhance the flavour.

Great recipe!  I used the Oriental Flavor Ramen Noddles instead.  It adds it a great flavor to it.  Also I used Wine vinegar and little less sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  I have also used 3 packs of Splenda or Equal.

This was pretty good as written. I added a handful of chopped cilantro and basil, and I made a lime sesame dressing, because I didn't want to use the salt (I mean flavor) packet that comes with the ramen noodles. I threw in a chopped up chili pepper too for some kick.

I love this salad. I chopped some broccoli and added to it, used almonds in place of the peanuts. I also made up a little more dressing than was called for. The only thing I didnt like about the recipe was the fact that there was no mention of cooking the noodles. I guess it just depends on your taste. I did not want mine crunchy, so it took a full 12 hours in the fridge to get them soft. It actually tasted better the next day anyway, so it was worth the wait. Next time I'll know that if I want the salad the same day, to cook the noodles first. Thanks for a great salad!!!

It seems everyplace I take this salad I'm asked for the recipe. Now I just keep it in my purse when I take the salad to share!

Excellent!!! I had this salad at family gatherings but had never gotten the recipe.  I finally found it!  This salad is sooo good.  I substituted cashews for the peanuts but otherwise made it exactly the same.  Really tasty!

We loved this!  My changes-- I used slivered almonds instead of peanuts, oriental ramen noodles instead of chicken flavored.  I wasn't sure whether to cook the noodles, so I cooked one package and kept the second dry.  I liked it that way! Also, I cooked a pound of boneless chicken breasts in the crockpot with one of the oriental seasoning packets, then shredded and cooled the chicken, and added it to the salad.  With the addition of the chicken, I doubled the liquid ingredients because it seemed too dry.  Turned out great and my husband wants this on the menu "at least once a week!"

This salad was a big hit at my sister's baby shower.  I've made a similar salad with Napa cabbage, but I enjoyed this one more.  I also added broccoli florettes as someone else suggested.  It beefed it up and made it even prettier.  I loved the crunch of the noodles, sunflower seeds and peanuts.  Add those right before serving for best results.

Love the crunchiness of the salad. Do not cook the noodles! Why do some people think they are supposed to cook them? It was too sweet for me so next time I will reduce the sugar. Left out the nuts but added raisins.

Very good and easy to make.  I definately recommend waiting until just before serving to add the dressing mixture and noodles so they stay crunchy.  Makes good leftovers, too.

SUPER! Easy and Tasty!  Big hit at last night's Bunco.  Changes:  1/3 C sugar, not 1/2 (dieter's you know) 2 bags of regular slaw, brocolli florets, no nuts, added yellow raisens, 1 chicken ramen &  1 teriaki.  Huge Hit! Will be a staple in my recipe box!

Wow!  I made this recipe 3 times in one week for different get-togethers.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  I used the Teriyaki flavor as another reviewer suggested, and it came out great!  It's so easy to scale this recipe up and down for large groups, I'll make it again and again!

Very good. I used ramen teriyaki noodle soup and feel it gave this salad a MUCH better flavor than the regular chicken noodle soup.

Really good!  If you like a crunchier salad, prepare within a few hours of serving -- otherwise, noodles get soft --- but good either way!  Also tried with regular slaw and worked well!

I am always skeptical when I see such a simple recipe with comments of those who add all kinds of things to improve it and still give it four or five stars.  I made this salad for a large event and the only change I made was to double the recipe. It was PERFECT!  I may have been a little light on the sugar, and may have accidentally discarded one of the ramen spice packets, but it was such a forgiving recipe, I couldn't tell. It was a perfect balance of crunch and chew and the ramen noodles soften as the salad sets up so, just trust this recipe. It truly is fantastic just as it is written.

Had the recipe made with coleslaw and loved it. OK. So I did not have broccoli nor coleslaw but we had some sliced mangoes that were hard. I put them in the food processer. Then I added butter to a skillet, crunched the noodles (3 oz package). I added black and white sesame seeds and toasted them with the noodles. Sliced up four green onions. Added to the shredded mango. added half of the spice packet. Added some oil and vinegar. Then added the noodles/seed and ate. YUM.  Recipe I've seen uses sliced almonds and sunflower seeds. did not have any. So for a test, this was awesome.  Great way to use the $5.78 mangoes. Colorful with the green onions. Quite tasty.  NOTE: you do not cook the ramen noodles. Toasting them is great.

NO cooking for the noodles ! as others said, they will absorb the sauce. NO sugar needed in the sauce, I used cider vinegar and sesame oil (to keep the Asian theme)
Dont miss the peanuts, they really add the final touch ( and I dont think that mixing them with sunflower seeds is a good idea)

I rated this a five for several different reasons. First, ease of preparation.  Our grocery only had a 12 oz. package of broccoli slaw so I decreased the ramen noodles proportionately.  I kept everything else the same thinking a little extra dressing wouldn't hurt.  Second, the taste was amazing.  I worried that it would be dry, but it wasn't.  Third, this has great crunch.  It fulfills that human need to chew!  Since I was only serving two of us, I sprinkled the nuts on individual servings.  This one's a keeper!

4 stars because I don't use the vinegar, oil, and sugar dressing - I use the Kraft Asian dressing, and sometimes I throw in a can of drained mandarin oranges.  DO NOT COOK THE NOODLES  they add crunch. Because they absorb the dressing, use only what you need, otherwise they will get mushy after a while.
Love this salad!

I really do enjoy this recipe. Personally, I thought it didn't need that much sugar.. But that could have been my fault. I did add about a half of a teaspoon of curry powder just for an added bonus. Oh and some corn that was left over from a bbq. Other than that, it's a great recipe to play around with.

Someone asked me to make this for a shower, and I really didn't think I liked it.  I made it for my family first, and we loved it!  Even my picky eater liked it (I served the onions on the side).  I used 1 package of ramen noodles for a double batch, and I made less dressings as I thought there was too much swimming in the bottom.  I also used regular blanched peanuts, much less than called for.  I put the nuts in right away since I was serving it within a few hours.  The next time I make it I want to add dried cherries.  Super easy to make, and very inexpensive as far as salads go.

I have tried this recipe for about 4 to 5 events and I think I have a keeper!!!  Haven't had one complaint!!! I used canola oil instead and I like the flavor of oriental ramen noodles the best. I also chop up the peanuts to about the size of the sunflowers seeds.

I must admit, I didn't have some of the ingredients but wanted to try this anyway, so I subbed coleslaw and used sweet onion instead of green onions.  I also added a little sesame oil.  I guess I am not really evaluating the recipe as written, but the result sure was delicious!  I will make this a lot in the future with the changes - thanks for a great starter recipe!

Delicious salad! I used 1 chicken ramen and 1 oriental and tripled the recipe for a very large party, it was gone before anything else. Everyone raved about this salad. When using the oriental ramen seasoning, the overall flavor is very much like a Pad Thai because of the peanuts. I've made this salad so many times because it is SO easy and amazingly good. Making it again today for our 4th of July party!

I absolutely LOVE this salad - it is best if you let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge, marinating if you will. I always toss the nuts in at the end, not before it's served - they keep fine in the refrigerator too.

I first had a very similar salad that included dried cranberries, so I added a cup of them to the mix.

This is an incredible salad!  I make it with half sugar and half Splenda for my mother in law since she's diabetic.  She loves the stuff!!  Kids + broccoli + eating helping after helping?  Total keeper for me!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I made it exactly as written except instead of using peanuts I used chopped almonds in place of the peanuts.  It was SO good!  I will make this one again and again.

This recipe was alright, i thought. My husband liked it quite a bit, and the kids didn't care for it. Despite alot of what reviewers were saying about the dressing missing something, i thought it was pretty good, but you really don't need that much sugar maybe have of what is called for.

I made this salad w/ just two adjustments- I used sesame oil instead of plain vegetable oil & I added some chopped cilantro. I'm glad I did. The flavour is wonderful! It's so easy to make and that's a huge plus for me.

This is an an excellent salad. I am usually asked for the recipe when I make this.  I do make some slight alterations though.  Instead of peanuts and sunflower seeds I use  sliced almonds (which I toast ahead of time).  I use about 1/2 tsp Crazy Mixed Up salt.  Instead of cider vinegar I use rice vinegar.  I know the raw raman noodles sound unappealing but they are vital to the dish. It all combines to make a salad with fantastic texture and great taste.

I wanted to make this and I did.  I liked it ok, but I like the other reqular slaw and ramen noodle salad much better.  Next time if I want some broccoli I think I will just make a regular broccoli salad with regular broccoli.  Plus I had such a hard time finding the broccoli slaw in my little town.

I listened to a prior user and added a splash of soy sauce, some garlic cloves and some cilantro and I am having a hard time staying out of it until the gathering!  I also saute my raw ramen noodles in a Tbsp of butter before adding to the mix.  So very, very good.

I switch it around every time I make it.  Sometimes I use pistachios or almonds or cashews.  I also add craisins or golden raisins or mandarin oranges.  I'll use different vinegars each time as well.  Tonight we added shredded baked chicken.  Yum!  I make this about 3 times a week and my kids never get sick of it because it's different each time!  And healthy!!  But don't tell them.

In response to some of the comments that said this recipe was bland I used rice wine vinegar instead of the cider vinegar.  It made a huge difference.

I substituted 1/3 cup honey for the sugar and 1/4 sesame oil.  Added soy sauce and fresh ginger.  Omitted nuts, due to allergy, and subbed fresh steamed edamame.

I am rating this 3 stars only b-cuz of the changes I make that I like better. I only use 1 origanl Ramen noodles;break into smaller pieces and toast lightly. I also toast slivered almonds as well. I use red wine garlic vinegar,less sugar and less oil. As others have stated this is so vertisale and you can add just about anything for personal taste. I can't eat onions,bell peppers etc but I am sure they would be enjoyable for most. Have fun with it. I have also used 1 broccoli slaw mix with 1 regular slaw mix and just dbl. the dressing and it is good. Just add the toasted items last.

I love this salad but am giving it 4 stars because I like the noodles cooked and not so much uncooked. Instead of peanuts I use slivered almonds like others have suggested.  Also,  it needs the soy sauce added for a better flavor.  Over all one of my favorite summertime salads.

This was pretty good. I will add the ramen noodles at the end next time. I think they would be better crunchy, would add to the texture of the salad. I loved the dressing after I added fresh garlic and some garlic powder for good measure!

This is a great salad. I mix the dressing in a jar the day before then mix in, add noodles 1 hr before serving, add nuts at the last toss. We never end up with any leftovers as we keep sneaking little bits as It sits on the counter. thanks for a great recipe

This is a wonderful recipe!  I plan on making it many times this summer to go with grilled chicken.  It's simple, light and very flavorful.  I think it's a crowd-pleaser and will remember it next time I need something for a Potluck.  I did use less sugar (and it was plenty sweet) and used Asian Flavored Ramen noodles.  Thanks for the submission!

I could only find a 12 oz. bag of the mix so I reduced the other ingredients.  First of all, I added chopped cilantro to the mix like someone else suggested and only used one noodle package.  I omitted the peanuts and sunflower seeds -- used sliced almonds instead.  I toasted the broken noodles & almonds over low heat until they were somewhat browned and let them cool.  And again, with previous suggestion, I added lime juice, and soy sauce.  Didn't use crushed garlic but I did use some garlic powder - it was wonderful!

The first time I tried this salad was at a work potluck.  It tickled my taste buds then and it still does now.  I did alter it slightly by using oriental ramen mix, and I used slivered almonds instead.  I also waited until just before serving to add the noodles to keep them crisp.  Absolutely wonderful!

I like the recipe a lot! Although If you prefer the noodles crunchy I would save a few noodles for the next day to add to the salad. Also, I think the acid from the vinegar becomes too harsh the second day. I usually only have this salad the day I make it and toss the leftovers.

For more flavor, I used the Oriental ramen noodles instead of chicken, and that made a great difference.  I've also added sheredded chicken to this, and it's quite a fulfilling meal.

Very good recipe. This is now one of my favorite things to take to work for lunch! 

I made it exactly as the recipe called the first time.  After that, I’ve made it with a bit more of an “Asian” twist using shrimp Ramen instead of chicken; rice wine vinegar instead of  cider; a few tablespoons of soya sauce; a few shakes of ground ginger and finally 1/8 cup vegetable oil + 1/8 cup sesame oil instead of all vegetable oil.  

It’s a great salad without my modifications though.  Thanks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS! Was perfect for my family get-together. Two "warnings" - 1) don't put the dressing on too far in advance or the noodles will soak it all up - 2) not sure what determines the # of servings. Expecting 25-30 people for the gathering, I made a double batch (12 servings) and there was LOTS left over.

This salad is very good on it's own, but I made some minor changes.  I used Rice vinegar in place of cider vinegar & used peanut oil with about 1 tbs of dark sesame oil to replace the vegetable oil.  The sesame oil adds a nice flavor, but a little bit goes a long way.

To make this recipe a little healthier, I usually cut down on the sugar by 1/3 -1/2.  I also only use one package of ramen noodles and instead of peanuts try blanched almonds.  You won't notice a difference!

I crushed the ramen noodles (I used shrimp flavor by the way) in a large ziplock bag by rolling it with a rolling pin until it was in small pieces.

I used the nuts I had on hand -- pecans -- any nut will do.  Absolutely fabulous!

This rating was a compromise -- I thought it was 2 stars, my husband said 4 stars.  I made it as written and given all the good reviews, I wish it was better, but I was not a fan of it and will probably not make it again.

I make this recipe using the oriental flavor noodles and it comes out spectacular!!  It is my signature dish to bring to warm weather parties.  When people see it for the first time, I always get the "it’s made with what?" and a surprised look.  But by the end of the party it’s always gone and everyone is raving.  Plus, it’s incredibly easy to put together.  Make it 1-2 hours before you serve it and keep it chilled for best results.

This recipe was excellent!! Totally different from the usual party fare, and won rave reviews.  The sweet, yet tangy dressing absolutely made this, too. As long as the noodles AREN'T cooked, it keeps the taste of the dressing for days.  As others said though, add the nuts when serving or they will become "soggy".  Even if multiplied, the recipe stayed true.

I love the crunchy texture of this salad.  I reduced the sunflower seeds to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup slivered almonds instad of the peanuts.  Even the kids love this one.

I use only 12oz bag of coleslaw mix and no peanuts or sunflower seeds. Tasted great, however next time I will use less sugar (little too sweet to my taste) and oil to reduce calories. Thanks

I thought this was very tasty.  I don't like crunchy noodles, so I soaked them in warm water for 15 minutes, drained, and then added to the remaining ingredients. I may add more shredded carrot next time, for color and nutritional value.

I brought this to a party and went home with an empty bowl!  This is a delicious salad.  The only thing I changed was that I used a bag of regular coleslaw mix rather than the broccoli slaw, just because my grocery store didn't have a big enough package of the broccoli slaw.  Still turned out great!

YUM! This was great. I used slivered almonds instead of peanuts, because it's what I had on hand. It was good and I think I'd do it again. Next time, I might also add some ginger to the dressing.

Salad is a great slaw alternative - I left out the peanuts and sunflower seeds and I also reduced the amount of sugar to try and make this slightly more healthy.  I would make this again - I think it would be great with some raisins (regular OR white)added.

I had this at a friends birthday party and knew I could find the recipe on this site!  It is so good.  It is a lot like the chinese chicken salad but even better.  The only thing I do differently is to cut the number of green onions down to about 2 or 3.  It is my favorite summer bbq salad!

This is a staple in our menu.  My two year old begs for his "fa-vor-ite salad."  I skip the peanuts just to suit our preferences, and I have occasionally used the Rainbow Slaw instead of Brocolli slaw.  Neither changes the flavor of the recipe much.  This really is sure to please everyone.

I enjoyed the chrunchy texture of this salad, but all the chrunchy items almost overpowered the broccoli.  If I make again I will leave the sunflower seeds out.  You must eat this the day you make it, broccoli is mushy the next day.

Yummy! I used almonds because that is what was in the pantry. Also I only used one packet of the seasoning to cut out some salt. It was very good. We like it with the noodles crunchy. As they soften it takes away the appeal of the salad to us.

Thank you for posting this recipe. We tasted a dish like this at a picnic and my husband wanted me to find the recipe. I used Oriental flavored Ramen noodles, toasted some almonds instead of peanuts, left out the onions and cut down on the sugar. I didn't have cider vinegar so I used plain vinegar and a little apple juice. It turned out well.

Mmmm. This is very good. It's easy and quick to make which is a plus. I used Rainbow slaw because it was cheaper and the only difference is it has hearts of cauliflower along with everything else. Next time I will use 1/4 cup of sugar, because 1/2 cup was a lot. I also only used 1 of the seasoning packets because they have so much sodium. This salad is great for a sunny spring day!

This is a delicious salad!!!!  The peanuts didn't appeal to me - I toasted some sliced almonds in the oven and used them instead with the sunflower seeds! I added some broccoli florets which was a nice contrast - and it was enjoyed by all.  This will become a regular at our house!

I have tried this recipe both ways and much prefer the noodles COOKED! It is also better the next day. I don't like peanuts, so I use toasted almonds instead.

A classic! I love enjoying it fresh while the noodles are crunchy. I add extra flavour with a splash of sesame oil, and I usually use half cider vinegar and half seasoned rice vinegar. Highly recommended.

An excellent salad, though perhaps not best for meal prep, as the noodles get a tad rubbery while they’re waiting to be eaten. Tasty, though.

Very nice recipe.  I substituted toasted sliced almonds for the peanuts.  I did not have green onions so I used a small Vidalia onion chopped fine.  
The chicken flavor ramen noodles is very good, but we like the Oriental seasoning better.

5 Stars because it's SUPER easy and fast to make, tastes good, and is versatile. I read through several reviews and took tips from a few. I added juice of 1/2 lime and some sesame oil. I also kept the peanuts off and let people top their salad if they wanted so that the peanuts remained crunchy. This salad is SO good. Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy and yummy.  Used ingredients as written, but made early in the day and added nuts later and sunflower seeds closer to serving (as recommended by other reviewers).  Best on the day, but okay as leftovers for a couple of days after.

You do *NOT* cook the noodles as I've seen some suggest. The crunch is part of the yummy. My 4-year and 10-year old even ate it!

Definitely up for adding garlic, soy sauce, and fresh lime juice to the dressing for some extra zing (as suggested by Kehunter). No cilantro because my DNA makes it taste like dish soap :)

This is my favorite recipe to make for BBQs and picnics. I use two 12 oz bags of broccoli slaw since our local stores only carry that size. I also only use 2 tablespoons of sugar because we prefer it more savory than sweet. It’s even better the next day after soaking in the dressing. Best summer salad!

The dressing was very bland. I added some roasted Asian sesame dressing and it killed! It added the little punch that it needed.

Made the recipe exactly per instructions a few weeks ago for my daughters baby shower.  Everyone loved it, so much they requested it again for Easter.  Super easy and good the next day.  I doubled the recipe which makes a very large bowl.  A nice side for a potluck or any get together.

Very good! My  mom used to make this often and it tastes just like I remember. The only substitution I made was beef ramen for the chicken.  Definitely keeping this recipe handy! Will be making again.  Thanks for sharing!

The instructions I received say to layer the ingredients: broken noodles on the bottom, slaw/salad mixture, nuts, onions on top.  Whisk and pour the dressing over the salad and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.  The noodles soften as the dressing settles to the bottom during the 24 hour period.

This was excellent, but like others, I made a few changes. I don't like the noodles crunchy, so I make the salad the night before (except the nuts- I add those right before eating or those will loose their crunch too.) The dressing softened up the noodles just right for my family. I also replaced the peanuts with sliced almonds and used 3/4 cups sunflower seeds instead of 1 cup. I thought the dressing was great, but I will experiment with adding some soy sauce as suggested by some other reviewers because, hey, why not?

I like this better when you toast the noodles with butter.  Saute the broken noodles and seeds/nuts in a few tablespoons of butter. Add the flavor packets from the noodles. This will give it all a ton more flavor.

Made this for a family get together. The only thing I left out was the peanuts.  No one really liked it much, including me. This is too much of the dressing. Made it really oily and so fattening with the Ramen noodles. Would not make it again.

I had the same experience as kehunter.  I prefer the shredded cabbage with carrots though and I added soy sauce and a bit of red wine vinegar which "jazzed it up" for me.

A delicious and versatile recipe! As l long as you have the broccoli slaw and the ramen noodles you can modify anything else to taste and occasion. I added precooked chicken from the deli case and threw in some soy sauce,  but am looking forward to making this with shrimp and water chestnuts for a picnic. I also did not add peanuts due to allergies but I can honestly say it wasn't missed.

I have been making this for years. The original recipe that I received uses the oriental Ramen noodles/ seasoning packet and no onion or peanuts.  I always take the recipe with the salad, because it always is a favorite.  I happen to like when the noodles get soft and pasta like, but unless I make it for myself at home, I rarely see any leftovers.  It is easy to make ahead .  I like to marinade the broccoli slaw so I just put the noodles and sunflower seeds on the top and mix in them in about a half hour or so before we eat, or bag them to add in on site.  Great recipe that has to be good for you.

My aunt made this recipe 20 years ago.  The difference is she used the oriental ramen noodles.  This is the seasoning you need to use.  Absolutely fantastic.  Still love making after all these years and an absolute hit.

I used rice vinegar instead of apple cider and used about an 1/8 of a cup sesame oil in the vegetable oil.  I added some dried cranberries, and chopped walnuts and almonds and pepitos (pumpkin seeds).  It was awesome!

I wanted this vegetarian so I bought Chinese fried noodles and a pack of vegetarian Asian seasoning mix. It worked wonderfully and with all the nuts for protein, it can be a main course salad. I also just chopped broccoli crowns rather than buy slaw.

Added cranberries, bacon bits and sunflower seeds. The cranberries add a nice sweet-tartness.  Had some prepared slaw dressing on hand instead of making the dressing. Addicting!

I use a one package of ramen well crunched  (without the flavoring packet.. discard the sodium), use rice vinegar instead of regular vinegar, and sliced or minced almonds instead of peanuts.  I also add cranraisins (about 1/2 cup) to give it a contrast of sweet/sour.  Salt-pepper to taste.  Zero complaints, just recipe requests!!

Had this delicious, crunchy salad tonight, and everyone agrees it was tasty and enjoyable.  I stuck fairly closely to the recipe, except for reducing sugar to 1/4 cup, and using wine balsamic vinegar rather than cider.  Will be making this again soon, and adding it to our regular rotation.  Next time I'll add raisins and maybe some peas to the mix.  I will also substitute toasted sliced almonds for the peanuts.

Excellent. We served as a  crispy fresh side dish with baked ham and roasted potatoes.  I used extra light olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added the nuts, sunflower seeds and broken uncooked noodles just before serving.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad is awesome!!!! The only thing I did different was omit the peanuts due to allergies, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I think the key to get the perfect taste might be in the cider vinegar. Do not cook the Ramen Noodles, the longer the salad sits the softer the noodles will become.

I made this for the first time tonight and my family LOVED it. I expect to make it again soon and often. I had a package of oriental flavored ramen noodles, so I used that plus one package of chicken flavor, instead of both being chicken. I kept out a portion of the noodles until just before serving, as suggested in the video, for added crunch. So easy and so delicious!

Everyone asks for this recipe when they taste it. Recipe is good as is. I make my own broccoli, cabbage, carrot slaw 'cause I like to slice and chop. Next time I also used Oriental Ramen and the seasoning that came with it. Do let it sit overnight. For Oriental used 1/8 cup sesame oil and 1/8 cup sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil. Also used rice vinegar instead of cider.
DO NOT COOK THE NOODLES but do break them up.

This is so close to the recipe I have I just had to comment. What a great, easy thing to throw together the night before. The only difference is that in the recipe I follow we use slivered almonds instead of peanuts,beef Ramen instead of chicken and added a cup of Craisins. Definitely let it sit for several hours. In my experience it is best after a day.

Enjoyed it enough the first time that I am bringing it to a potluck next week. I originally didn't have time to toast the ramen and nuts so I am looking forward to seeing if it improves the tastes. Not toasting the ramen and seeds get soggy after a day or two as leftovers.

Lighten up the dressing.  I have loved Broccoli Slaw since the first time I've tried it.  I've tweaked the recipe some and it's better and even lighter tasting.  1) Halve the dressing recipe and leave out the flavor packet.  Especially when you let this sit, it gets oily.  You only need half, but pump up the flavor by adding a flavored oil (orange infused olive oil is nice) and season the dressing with salt and pepper.  Add a Tablespoon of soy sauce or tamari.  2) Slivered or sliced almonds is a nice swap.  3) Add madarin oranges (canned in water), craisins and/or golden raisins for sweetness instead of all that sugar.  Agree with other reviewers, DO NOT cook the noodles - put everythign together and let sit for 30 minutes before serving to soften the uncooked noodles in the sauce.

Very simple and good. I followed the recipe as is. This does make a substantial amount. Leftovers are not good as the ramen noodles and seeds get soggy. I would recommend adjusting your recipe accordingly.

I really loved this salad.  The only thing I changed was the oil & vinegar.  I used olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but other than that I followed it according to the recipe.  I think the more it set, the better it tasted.  Besides a small bowl eaten by my daughter, I wound up devouring the whole thing myself over a couple of days.

Made the recipe exactly. Was a hit!  Will make again. The noodles not cooked were nice and crunchy.  If we waited a little the noodles would have soaked the dressing which was not important to us.

Was good. We like our things with a little extra umph of vinegar so i used 1/2 cup vinegar, and only a teaspoon of sugar. It came out great! I'm thinking about adding some hot sauce to the dressing next time for an extra kick.

I was super skeptical about this, but I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It was well worth it!  Totally delicious and really easy to make!  I like that it's a little unconventional!  I'll be sharing this with family and friends.

Wonderful summertime recipe.  We find this salad in all our family bbq's and parties.  When making it myself I vary the nuts with sometimes just doubling peanuts and skipping out on the cashews.  Even tried it with pumpkin seeds instead of sunflowers once because it's what I had on hand, and it was still delicious.

This recipe is great!  However, I do not use those chicken or meat-flavored packets because there are too many unwanted ingredients. I also add 2 tsp. of soy sauce.  When I use vinegar, I prefer to use rice vinegar which is milder than the cider vinegar.  I also love adding sliced almonds and sunflower seeds to tis salad.
Yum!

Very good salad. I enjoyed it but my family did not.
I am always looking for cold veggie dishes beside salads and this hit the spot. Thanks

I really liked this recipe. Very fast to put together.  I made last night for a salad luncheon and made last week for a funeral lunch at church.  I bet it would be good on a hot dog too!! I didn't use nuts because some of the people can't eat them. Cooking the ramen noodles is not necessary but I do believe making the night before is essential.

I made this as a side with sloppy joes.  Maybe not a great combo, but it was a hit with my 15 and 12 yrs old boys.  My husband and I loved it as well and I will make it more with an Asian themed main dish next time.  
I love the fact that you could substitute this for a starch because of the veggies and ramen in it.

I've served this many times, and it always gets rave reviews. As Patty Cakes mentions, it isn't necessary to spend the extra money on pre-shredded broccoli slaw. I just use stems and shred them in the food processor. Then I have the "trees" ready to use in my next day's meal. This easy recipe is nutty, crunchy, tasty, and healthy. It's also easy to mix things up a little by adding toasted seeds or nuts, herbs, or other flavorings (honey mustard instead of half the vinegar? yes, please).

This is my go to side dish recipe.  I use oriental flavor ramen, rice vinegar, 1/3 cup of sugar and use toasted almonds instead of peanuts.  I mix the dressing several hours ahead then toss it all together 1-2 hours before serving.  The noodles soak up a little of the dressing, but still have a crunch.

This is one of my favs, but I find it best with the Oriental Ramen flavor and I also add sliced olives. Also, I normally don't use peanuts and it's just as tasty.

I thought this recipe was okay....pretty bland. I made it a second time and used a reviewers idea to add soy sauce....still pretty bland. It has the potential to be good after I try some different flavor combos. I really like the idea of adding the ramens!!

Love this recipe.   I added a bit more to the dressing like others.  I read one review where someone rates it low because it says to cook the noodles.   That amost grossed me out.  I have eaten this salad at 100s of functions (different variations) and have never had one where they cooked the noodles.   I had never even thought to cook the noodles and not sure I ever would.  So if this recipe was meant to cook them, would've done one star I think! LOL

One of the best!  When ever I take this to pot lucks it's gone!  I always get requests for the recipe.  I love the dressing!  I liked the idea of adding some cilantro, I will try that the next time I make it.

I used apple cider vinegar and reduce the amount of sugar.  Don't use peanuts but add chopped celery and water chestnuts.  Every time I've taken it to a party people rave and want the recipe.  The best part is that it's super simple & quick to make!

For a quick and healthy meal this is fantastic.  It's nice to use the broc shred for a change- the flowerettes are great, but I get tired of that look on my plate.  The ramens and nuts a good compliment to the veg mix.  Lightly dressed and toasty, this cool salad is best served immediately after combining the two temperature elements, IMO.  If you chill it, don't chill it too long, because the Ramen's absorb the moisture and lose crispiness.  I use much less sugar.  I remember this recipe being highlighted on the Paula Deen show awhile back- that's where I was originally introduced to it.  Or, at least a VERY similar one, created by two girls who were college buddies or something.  I ASSumed this was the same duo when I ran across the recipe just now here at all-recipes.  I've made this recipe several times in the last few years- it's an on-hand fall-back.

A little light on flavor but it was simple to make.  The nuts and sunflower seeds make it much better.  I brought it to a July 4th pot luck and received several compliments.

We loved this recipe! It was hard to stop eating it.
I added cashews instead of peanuts and I (unfortunately)  had no sunflower seeds but it was fabulous and I will be making this again!

So good.  I made it with regular slaw mix about 3 hours in advance and mixed it every 30 minutes or so as I had made a double batch.  It was really good!  Thanks for the recipe.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It's a great conversation piece yet so simple to make.  Would there be anyone willing to share their photo of the dish with me, I'm looking to feature a similar recipe in a Bridal Shower recipe book for my sister in law as a gift.  Thanks!!

This salad was very good! I made it for a Girls' Luncheon & everyone had seconds, and thirds! I personally thought it had too much sunflower seeds, but that's an easy fix for next time!

after reading others comments, i used sesame oil, crushed garlic, seasoned rice vinegar and little sugar since rice vinegar is sweet to being with.  it was yummy right away and can't wait to see how much tastier it will be after sitting around.

Very tasty salad!  I've used different flavors of Ramen, with and without sesame seeds, peanuts and almonds.  I usually add a little celery if I have it on hand and almost always add a splash sesame oil.  I agree that the longer it sits, the better.

LOVE this recipe, have been making this with different nuts, seeds, etc.  I add just a splash of sesame oil, rice vinegar, and only use one packet of the ramen noodle soup seasonings. Today I had some black sesame seeds, threw them in and instead of peanuts, i was out, chopped walnuts, I also used olive oil. The recipe is great, you can be creative and not mess it up.

My best friend makes this salad and I love it! I added chicken to this (the pre grilled stuff from the store, I just cut it up and added- how easy is that??). I also used a small splash of sesame oil w/ peanut oil, and used rice vinegar for the oil and vinegar in this recipe. it was delish! Even the kiddies liked it. Thanks for this recipe! It is a keeper!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and I have family requesting it for this year.  The only change I made was I used a head of broccoli cut into small pieces instead of the broccoli slaw..our little grocery didn't have the slaw.  I didn't cook the noodles beforehand.  We loved the crunch.

I use oriental ramen noodles, only sunflower seeds instead of peanuts, and skip the green onions. I also like to add mandarin oranges and diced grilled chicken. Also for this amount of noodles and dressing, it's good to use to bags of salad.

Great recipe!  I love quick and easy stuff like this...good for home or to take to work for a luncheon!  Instead of chicken, I used one beef and one oriental style ramen; this give it a more asian flavor!

My husband loved this. I used regular coleslaw mix because that's all my market had that day, and pecans instead of peanuts as that's what I had on hand. I loved the dressing.  Next time I think that I will omit nuts totally. Update- I have made this like 10 times over a few years. I never use nuts. Love it with coleslaw mix, and honestly the sunflower seeds add a nice texture but if you are not a food geek than don't worry about buying them just for this.

This is a great recipe, a salad with ramen noodles, what a great way to get kids to eat salad.  I like to put cole slaw mix in it as well.

I was very excited to try this recipe as it sounded soooo good.  But, I was a little disapointed :(  I agree with what others said about the dressing lacking something....I think I will try it again but add some other things to the dressing.

Love it.  Added dried cranberries as suggested and used Splenda and only one of the Seasoning packages.  It is soooo good and the fact that this is healthy is such a bonus.  Thanks for a great recipe that we will make over and over.

I change up the flavor of the salad by experimenting with different flavors of vinegar & ramen noodles. Also I always add a TBSP of seasoning, sometimes Greek, Cajun, ect. I also switch up the type of coleslaw, sometimes I use the broccoli slaw & sometimes I use the old stand by cabbage slaw. Though adding fresh herbs, garlic ect is bound to bounce up the flavor. This is a great make & take recipe as it does not have to be kept cool. Even my 3 year old loves it, that aught to tell you something.

When I saw this was the recipe of the day, I had to write a review- my father in law got me hooked on this salad, and it is a staple for the entire family...the only thing is that we don't add the peanuts and sunflower seeds...but I think that next time, I definately will, it sounds like a great addition! Thanks for the post, everyone should try this out as an alternative to coleslaw or a side salad!

I also love this simple, fast recipe. However, instead of peanuts I use a crunchy salad topping mix which has sunflower seeds also.  It gives a more diverse flavor versus the peanuts, I also use extra virgin olive oil, delicious!

This salad is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, but after reading other reviews, I made (quite a few) additions. I added sesame oil, dried cranberries, a teaspoon of mild giardiniera, chopped parsley, toasted sesame seeds, a teaspoon of minced garlic, half a teaspoon of mustard seed, and a dash of soy sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

We made this last night for Christmas guests. Everyone who tasted it loved it. I did not have or use peanuts, used pecans instead (which I like), and used sesame ginger dressing instead of olive oil. I can guarantee that we will be making this again soon...healthy and tasty! thanks!OH, and to add more for the kiddos, I suggest added some craisens or raisens... :)

Great salad! Didn't have the green onions so substituted red and it was great! I had been looking for a broccoli salad with this exact flavor after having it at a Christmas party once. Thank you, thank you!

This got RAVE reviews from all who tried it.  Highly recommend adding dressing, onions, nuts to taste as it calls for alot in my opinion. Add noodles before serving so they are crunchy. Awesome!

Pretty yummy but a bit oily for me.  I guess the ramen noodles have enough fat without adding anymore.  Good, though!

I thought this recipe was just ok.  I am not sure what I was expecting, but the flavor just wasn't right.  Maybe it was because I only had "hot and spicy" ramen noodles and used that instead of chicken flavor.

This is a really easy and good salad.  My son doesn't care for it (he's 4), but adults surely will!!
