I have to say, this is probably one of my favorite recipe creations. We love the crisp of the RITZ with the huge crunch of the hazelnuts, the sweet of the gelato and the saltiness of the cracker and that bitter of the semi-sweet chocolate. But the best way we enjoy this hands down is with the Sea Salted Caramel Gelato. hmmmm mmm sinfully wicked!

These are surprisingly great!  I used sea salt caramel gelato and had to work quickly because it melts quite quickly!  This makes an easy and tasty bite----you just have to think about making them ahead!  Thanks, Melissa!

This was one of the best foods I have ever ate. The rich chocolate melted in my mouth. Sweet and slightly salty, it was great.

These were so yummy! I had never tried gelato before and I loved it especially sandwiched between Ritz crackers and dipped in chocolate. My daughter was not a fan of the semi sweet chocolate so next time I may try a milk chocolate for her. Thanks Melissa for a great little recipe.

FANTASTIC!  These are so easy, and my kids can't wait for their special desserts tonight.  Plus, one is the perfect portion!  I used a stracciatella (Italian chocolate chip) gelato that I had in the freezer, and pecans instead of hazelnuts.  The crunchy salty cracker was the perfect complement to the sweet gelato & chocolate.  Great job, Melissa!

Everyone loved this little dessert at our SuperBowl watch party.  So easy to make, and the crackers didn't get soft at all...great blend of sweet and salty!
