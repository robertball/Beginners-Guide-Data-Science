This is the second time I made this recipe, but this time I took the suggestions of 2 reviewers. First, I didn't use paper cups; instead, I used oil spray directly on the muffin tin. (last time everything stuck to the little paper cups) The finished peanut butter cups popped out easily. Second, I took the suggestion of adding 1/4 cup crushed honey graham crackers and some vanilla to the peanut butter mixture. Adding a little bit of butter to the chocolate was also a helpful idea. The finished product was absolutely delicious.

Shouldn't have made these.  My husband and I have been on a health kick, but I found these and wanted to "try them".  Honestly, the first day I didn't really care for them and almost gave them all away.  But the next day I tried one again and LOVED it.  Now I have to keep disciplining myself not to eat anymore.  They are now in the freezer...where they will stay for a while.  The thinner the chocolate shell, the better.  Oh, and I also used them without liners.  I just sprayed the muffin pan with oil and they popped right out after being in the freezer for a bit.  No oily residue or taste either.

I dont understand why no one has tried these yet!!  It may seem time consuming because the recipe says it takes two hours..but that's just waiting for them to harden (which if you put them in the freezer doesn't take as long as you think).  These are better than the regular Reese's(R) peanut butter cups!! So yummy and so much cheaper to make yourself!! Even my husband, who is candy and cookie making challenged made these!  Definately worth the wait!

these are really good and fun to make. i would not recommend using "candy melt" chocolate, since it's very waxy. i used dark chocolate chips, but next time i will have more on hand, since the whole package wasn't quite enough to make 12. i would also recommend making the bottoms thicker than the tops, just because it makes it easier to get them out (i also just put them right in without paper cups) . i used chunky peanut butter, but then had to add some creamy to make the sugar/pb mixture. either way, it was delicious. when you're adding the pb mixture, make sure you leave room around the edges so that when you pour chocolate on top it will touch the bottom layer, and not leave any holes.  i will definitly make these again.

I found it easier to pick up paper cups in my hand & pull melted choc. onto the sides with a spoon this way.  It looked like too much choc., but I figured it had to be somewhat thick to hold the PB in.  Once the cups were filled, I'd used 1/2 bag of chips,as called for & was perfectly divided. Put in freezer for 20 min. Filled w/ creamy PB. I was unsure here b/c the PB mix was thick & seemed to be "heaping" out of the cup when I used all of it.  How was I going to cover it w/ choc & make them appear flat like the real thing?  But it turned out fine as the PB melted a little on its own & smoothed out nicely as it set at room temp. Then I stuck in fridge to keep cool while I melted rest of chips.  I evenly divided melted choc. among all 12 cups.(about 1 tsp. each)Do not try to keep muffin pan clean while you drag choc. to edges!  It's too time consuming trying to do that:)  It makes no difference in the end.  I put in freezer, then fridge & finally to counter.  But I think if they sit in fridge for a little while to set up,that is all that's needed.  They can be eaten almost immed. Tasted wonderful-kids said too much PB, I thought if anything, too much choc on bottom.  But overall, definitely hit the spot!  Fix these up in a short box, line with tissue paper, foil, etc. & fill with a  half dozen or so cups.  They look just like the real thing.  They taste rich, but so are the real ones. Mmmm! Thanks for something original, yet creative to make with the kids.  Will make again!!

Amazing.  I think this one is my favorite recipe for these...only thing I did differently was to use crunchy peanut butter.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks for the post.

What a wonderful addition to my Favourites! I used a large block of milk chocolate ( not cooking chocolate) and melted it for about 30 secs., stirred and then checked every few seconds until it was completely melted. I poured about a teaspoon into the top of aprox. 10 muffin paper cups and tilted the cup around until the cup was evenly covered. I then 'piped' the peanutbutter mixture into the cooled chocolate cups and then covered with the remaining chocolate and put in freezer for about half an hour. They were a big hit with everyone who tasted them!

I made these last night for my family and co-workers as a Valentine's Day gift.  They all loved them and my co-workers demanded the recipe.  They were so easy to make.  I used a 1/2 pd chocolate bar, melted over a double boiler.  I also warmed the peanut butter mixture in the microwave to make it spreadable.  To help each step set up faster I used the freezer.  It only took about 8 minutes to harder which cut my hardening time in half!!!  You must try them, you will love them!!!

Yes, this recipe is great and end product taste GREAT!  I found it messy to make.  Being a man, my hands are less delicate to spread the chocolate up the sides.  I used half and half semi-sweet and milk chocolate.  I used mini cupcake liners and made 24 smaller portions (which is more than enough, even for chocolate lovers).  I experimented with two of the CPB cups because of the mess to spread chocolate up the sides of the cup.  The last two I put about 3/4 tsp of chocolate in cup, rolled a small ball of the PB (PB is moldable), pushed it into the chocolate, letting chocolate to rise naturally around the PB as it was pushed into the chocolate and then I immediately covered it with the second layer of chocolate (without doing the chilling of the bottom first -- chilling the whole thing in the end of filling the cups).   This made it less messy and they came out the same as the others having prepared it as suggested in the recipe.

I made these for my co-workers and they LOVED them! Instead of making them individual cups, I lined an 8x8 pan with foil and made them more like peanut butter bars. I also added 3/4 c crushed graham crackers into the peanut butter mixture, and the crunch was perfect.  After it set in the freezer, I removed the foil and cut it into little squares, and put them on cupcake papers.  It just seemed a lot easier than lining each individual cup :~)

These were a HUGE mess to make and even eat. Everyone loved them though. I used mini muffin cups because I had to make so many of them for a party. I would make them again but not on a regular basis.

These satisfy a mean PB and choc craving, that's for sure! I did these in a muffin tray sprayed with olive oil and they came out perfect. I used milk chocolate on the bottom and sides and dark chocolate on the top. Absolutely delicious!

I thought these were delicious.  After reading many reviews, these are the things I found most helpful:

1.  Use small muffin cups and oil them...the PB cups come out just fine after frozen.
2. Try to use a thin layer of chocolate on the top and the bottom.  The ones that I thought were too thin as I was making them, actually turned out the best when it was time to eat them!
3. I preferred 1/2 milk chocolate chips and 1/2 unsweetened baker's chocolate.
4.  I used kosher salt, which added a nice texture to the PB mixture.
I easily made these and cleaned up the dishes in under an hour, so it really wasn't that labor intensive or messy in my opinion.

I have made these three times and it gets easier every time.  Everyone who has tasted has loooooved them and wants the recipe.  I do find it easier to use sturdier cups than making your own paper or foil liners.  I went to Michael's, the craft store, and they have "confectioner's cups" to place truffles or various candies in but they are a thick, sturdy waxed paper and are the PERFECT shape for the cups and hold their shape well under the weight of the chocolate.  No one could believe that I made the peanut butter cups by hand!

fantastic. Three things:  1) used a mini muffin tin with no liner, just a little spray oil in the cups. 2) added about a tsp of vanilla as others suggested, to the peanut butter mix. 3) Rolled the pb mix into little balls and dropped them into the cups, pressed down with a spoon dipped in powdered sugar, then topped with the remaining chocolate. Excellent!

I used silicone muffin pans so I didn't have to use liners or oil, they just popped right out. I added approx. a tsp of margarine to the chocolate. Also took some suggestions and added vanilla and graham crumbs.

Used good quality dark chocolate & organic PB (i.e. just peanuts, nothing added), worked out great...and is the "healthy" version ;)   Also tried half the batch with almond butter instead, just as good!

These were great!  I did take a couple of suggestions on the filling in that I added a spash of vanilla and a few graham crumbs -- I could eat a bowl of that filling!  I opted to just use semi-sweet choc chips (since I love them) -- I do wish I had added a bit of butter to the chocolate so that it wasn't quite so hard to bite through, but was delicious.  I tried them in a new mini silicone mold I had picked up, and they popped right out like a dream and look quite professional!

I don't understand the reviews stating that this was messy or time consuming. It took me 20 minutes, and that's with a toddler nipping at my heels. I stuck them in the freezer to harden, and that took 5 minutes. I had the perfect amount of chocolate and filling. I easily brushed the melted chocolate up the sides of the cups. I think it's important to cut the paper liners in half. Then you just barely have to push the chocolate up the edge. These would be better with milk chocolate, but I had to use semi-sweet dairy-free, and they were still delicious.

Oh dear goodness, this recipe is a forever keeper for sure! I made these for a Christmas gift and it was VERY well received! I did have to make it twice as the first time I didn't use liners (at the suggestion of other reviews) and they totally stuck. Honestly this wasn't too much a tragedy as I enjoyed devouring the stuck batch, but the second time around using the cupcake liners worked perfectly and came off of the cups with no problem! Make this recipe, you're hips may be sorry but your mouth will not be!

This recipe is excellent. Sometimes I actually just use hersheys plain chocolate bars if I have then around the house. I also use mini muffin cups because eating a pb cup the size of a reg. muffin cup (even though cut down) can be very rich!

Proportions way off...  I needed to find another bag of choc chips to finish and still had a quarter cup of peanut butter left over... The peanut butter mixture was too soft to effectively get into the cups.  I also found the step of cooling the first part made them crack apart too easily whereas my old recipe just had you drop a ball of peanut butter in and cover right away w/ more chocolate worked better.  I used to make these years ago using mini cups but couldn't find any so tried this one.  The taste is great though, and super simple.  Next time 1/2 the amount of filling will be what I try.

Very yummy!  Very sweet when using semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I used a double boiler to melt my choc chips, as I've had bad luck with microwave melting.  Also put in some graham wafer crumbs as others have suggested.  I would recommend using a mini muffin pan.  I put paper liners in and gave each liner a quick spray  with Pam.  Had no troubles peeling them off.  This would make a fantastic Christmas dainty!

added butter to chocolate for gloss and finish.  a double boiler beats out a microwave any day.  just put choc in a smaller pot over the bigger pot of very mildly bubbly hot water, that way everything is consistent.  
used little itsy bitsy metallic liners, no oil, for choc. put inside little tiny clear candy plastic baggiies once cooled and tied off w/ribbon. made great candy gifts.

Great recipe! Used SILICONE mini muffin cups... sooooooo easy.  They're thicker and easier to handle than paper and peel off super easy!  I used 24 for this recipe.   The only change I would make is adding more icing sugar and a bit less peanut butter to make the filling a bit dryer - more like a reese. Thanks for sharing

After reading all the reviews I set out to make these Peanut butter cups and they were delicious and easy. the only change I made was I did two batches one with untrimmed paper cups, and one using only bare muffin tins. Many reviews mentioned paper cups sticking to the chocolate, this issue is solved by not trimming the cups. Using the bare muffin tin method turned out just fine also. Once the chocolate sets they popped out easily and I placed them into untrimmed paper cups, or trimmed if you prefer. Also discovered when using Dark chocolate 60% or greater, to use thin layer at bottom and top. To think of a layer will make it hard to break with your teeth...:) Wonderful treat highly recommend this recipe

YUMMM!! For a little 'crunch' I added 1/4 cup of mashed honey graham crackers to the peanut butter mixture, and 1 tsp of vanilla to moisten. I also used semisweet chocolate chips, as one can never go wrong with dark chocolate in this household. Had a little trouble melting the chocolate in the microwave (I usually use a double-boiler), so I added a tbsp of margarine to the mixture. Wonderful!

These were outstanding! I just couldn't get enough! Really easy to make, as well. I forgot to trim the cups, though, so they were huge, but we just cut them once they hardened (which they will need to do once you pour the remaining chocolate on top--refrigerate for 2 hours). I held the cups, and that made them easy to work it (and not so messy). And my husband and I both feel like they tasted JUST like actual Reese's, too (if not better!). I used Ghiradelli chocolate and SmartBalance peanut butter as well, if anyone is interested.

One of the easiest candy recipes I have ever tried.  I used foil cups instead of paper, sprayed them with baking spray and melted all the chocolate with just a tad of vegetable oil to make it softer(less than teaspoon).  I mixed the peanut butter/confectioner sugar with a cap-full of Southern Comfort instead of vanilla.  I added marshmallows to a few, coconut to a few and left some plain.  On top I lightly sprinkled kosher salt.  I think these are the best peanut butter cups I have ever had and a welcome addition to our all adult New Years' Day Feast.

Delish! I used a standard size muffin tin and liners and made about six large peanut butter cups. I only added 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar to the peanut butter filling because I really wanted to taste the peanuts and it was plenty sweet. I took huge dollops of peanut butter and encased them in extra thick layers of milk chocolate. You won't find peanut butter cups this good in any grocery store.

I made these for a friend who is a Reeces cup addict, and he said they were 'two thumbs up.' I took the suggestions of other reviewers by greasing a silicone muffin sheet instead of using liners, and added 1/4 cup crushed graham cracker and about 1 tsp vanilla extract to the peanut butter mixture. 
When they were done the top layer was a bit patchy, and some of the filling was exposed, so I used a pastry brush to smooth the top layer with some additional melted chocolate. It made some really pretty brush strokes, and I'm a bit of an artist, so I'm planning on getting some butterscotch and white chocolate chips - which I can then color with food-dye, and do some nice pictures on the cups for festive treats and gifts to give away.

Great recipe-- but take the extra tips as well!

I added a teaspoon of butter to the chocolate to silken it a little. I also added 1/4 cup crushed honey graham cracker and 1 tsp vanilla to the peanut butter mixture. Used miniature muffin cups to make the candies like the bite sized Reese's instead of full sized. Skipped the fridge, went directly to the freezer for fast setting. The thinner the chocolate on the walls of the cup the better, as long as it is a solid layer.  I also melted a little dark chocolate, put it in a decorating bag and drizzled it over the tops of the cups for a little decoration. Easy and yummy recipe!

Awesome recipe! Based on other reviews, I added some butter to the chocolate when melting it.. and I added a splash of vanilla to the peanut butter mixture.  I used a pastry brush to get the chocolate on the paper liners... Next time, I will make the chocolate layer a little thicker.  Everyone who tasted these said they are better than Reese cups!  If you have any trouble removing the paper liners, just put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  Perfect easy recipe!

Awesome, easy recipe to make.  Instead of normal paper lines I used mini silicone muffin lines (from a dollarstore) and they worked amazing.  It was easy to spread the chocolate up and they came off really easy.  Plus there were the perfect size. I got 12 out of just over a half recipe (I had to make more peanut butter mixture).

These are amazing! I don't know why some people are saying that these were difficult, or messy- I found them to be extremely and by no means messy- my 2 year old even helped! And I was eating one within one hour :)(did not take 2 hrs at all!) Highly recommend! Put's Reese's Cups to shame :) :)

Exactly like a peanut butter cup tastes!  I did not make any changes to the recipe but I did use a brush to apply the chocolate to the cup liners as I wanted a thin coat of chocolate.  I had no problem removing the paper liners.   The hardest part was waiting for them to firm.  Thank you SHAUNNSMOM for sharing your recipe.

dont make if you are on a diet! excellent! easy to make! I doubled the chocolate and mixed dark with milk. will make cups smaller next time and use amt. in recipe.they got great but they are HUGE. i did use paper cups. very easy cleanup and it peeled off easy. would use everytime.I dont like doing more dishes then I have to.  do not trim cups. carefully spread chocolate on sides. then i put in my deep freeze to cool. took 10 minutes if that, each time to cool! excellent easy delicious recipe and looks elegant. i took all paper off and placed in pan lined with wax paper. use a zip lock bag to pipe peanut butter filling in otherwise its a huge sticky mess. this way was much much easier to clean and to direct where you want the peanut butter to go.

Sooo good and really easy!!! I used semisweet bakers squares, it's all I had on hand and put my chocolate into molds instead of a muffin tin. They turned out amazing and taste great! These are being wrapped up for Christmas parties this year!

This is a good recipe...I added 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs to the mix to get that little bit of gritty texture like reese's. Also I make them in mini cupcake papers, since they are so rich a mini one is plenty to satisfy the craving.

VERY GOOD RECIPE
Found that silicone mini muffin cups in a 24-mini-muffin pan worked much better-tried paper cups at the beginning and was a mess!
Leaving it in the fridge for 45 mins. works just fine. Refrigerate after you've had your fill (if there's anything left!).

BEWARE-EXTREMELY ADDICTING

Didn't love these.....I think the powdered sugar can be completely omitted.  The peanut butter/sugar mix left  a weird coating in my mouth.  I used mini muffin tins without a liner, and it worked fine.  Also, I microwaved the peanut butter so it was easier to work with.  These would probably be better with a bit of tweaking.  As is, they were only okay,

Haven't read all of the reviews, so not sure if this has been suggested yet, but an easier way to spread the chocolate, instead of using a spoon, is with a paint brush.  That's what I use in all of my chocolate making when I have to go up the sides of a mold. Of course you use a new one that you designate for food use only. :-D

Fabulous! Read the reviews & incorporated some great tips for an amazing result! The only thing I would say is that using a silicone mini muffin pan is the best thing to put these in! Oh! Also, if you're short on time pop it in the freezer rather than the fridge :) Enjoy!

these taste AMAZING!! but i did the mistake of not using muffin cups on the ideas of others. DO NOT do what i did!! they just fell apart and wouldnt come out of the muffin tin!! i used cooking spray, but they just wouldnt budge! eventually i just used my knife to get them out. The presentation wasnt very good, but still great on taste. Next time i will definetly be using muffin cups

Oh! These were so tasty! I added vanilla and graham crumbs to the PB, like some had suggested.  I also put them in the freezer, and hardened up really quick. Giving the muffin tray a good shaking, got the chocolate on top to really smooth out.  I will definitely make these again.

I love this recipe!  I made them at Christmas and  liked the idea from another reviewer of spraying a muffin pan with cooking spray and using it instead of muffin cups.  I went to Target and found a cookie mold holiday pan that contained 12 Christmas molds and thought that would even be better and it was.  I barely used a knife to pop each piece out of the mold and was pleasantly surprised at how nice they looked.  My family loved them and I'll be making them again next year and the years to come.

Yum! These are so good and really very easy to make. The inside is a little soft. I think next time I will add a little more powder sugar. We made some with white chocolate also. Very good. Drizzle melted chocolate (contrasting) on top or sprinkle with chopped peanuts. Very pretty. I used mini muffin tins and parfait paper liners. They turned out nicly and tasted good too!

Love love love these so much.  I also did not use the paper cups and just sprayed the tart pan.  I actually put my peanut butter mix in before I let the chocolate base completely harden because it was hard to get the chocolate to stay up the sides after spraying with the nonstick spray.  But it came out wonderfully and my family loved them.

Oh my goodness!!  These are unbelievably amazing!!!  I used the same amount of ingredients but made them using a mini-muffin pan ... getting 24 out of a batch.  I can't imagine even being able to finish one that was full-size ... they are so rich!  I brought a huge batch into share with my co-workers and they were gone by 8:45 a.m.!!  Soooo soooo good!!

These are good with the changes I made.  I used Almond Bark and about 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter for the shell.  I didn't use salt and added a tsp of vanilla to the peanut butter mixture for the filling.  I also didn't see a need to trim down the cups as they come out perfectly.  Also, if you put them in the freezer for 10 minutes, they will be set.  Fast and easy recipe.

These are fantastic.  I live in France and cant get Reese's (not easily anyway) here so am very happy to find this recipe.  What I did find useful were mini muffin cup liners made of silicone which work perfectly for this recipe, they retain their shape, and are reusable and easily detachable from the chocolate.    Thank you for adding this recipe!

OMG!  One of the best things that I have ever made!  I made them just as the recipe says and they were insane!  I read the reviews and chose to not use cupcake liners and just used a spray oil and they popped right out.  I will use mini muffin tins next time because they are huge! So creamy! Loved and this is my new "staple" for get togethers.

Oh man, I shouldn't be allowed to make "Reese's" at home!   I used semi-sweet chips because that's all I had on-hand, but will use milk chocolate in the future and add a touch more salt to the pb filling.  I imagine these made in a mini muffin pan and wrapped in cute bags would be great holiday gifts!

Awesome!!  I used the papers and they came out of the tins just fine and the chocolate didn't stick as much as other cooks have found.  I made a double batch and used 1 cup of creamy and 1 cup of crunchy. That together with the sugar and salt was a little thick to spoon into the tins so I microwaved it to thin it out a little.  Worked great.  Highly Recommended!  If you have people in your family that are always looking for an easy recipe - don't give them this one...keep it for yourself and they'll always think you slaved for hours.

This doesn't take two hours. Not even close. Place the chocolate in the freezer and it's hard in 3 minutes for the bottom, and ten minutes for the second part. To save time, melt half the chocolate first, pour into wraps, and while they're coolin' make the filling. My cups were ready in about thirty minutes, and as a friend described them, "Women will be tossing themselves at you left and right when they found out you made them by hand." Vice versa ladies when it comes to men. An amazing treat that is easy and delicious.

Great, simple recipe with a delish ending.  I used reduced fat PB to "healthy them up a bit".  I plan on making these again with dark chocolate.  So good.

This is  almost identical to a peanut butter egg recipe I use at Easter, very yummy.  Another twist is to sweeten and thicken your peanut butter with some melted white chocolate, in place of the confectioners sugar.   No measurements here, just kind of tried it one day, adding only as much as my taste required.  It was delicious.

This tasted good, but I was really disappointed with the peanut butter inside. It as too thin and creamy and seemed like it should be more pasty/thick like the actual peanut butter cups. I probably won't make these again, sorry.

These are no where near a good as my mothers recipe, which she keeps secret. Your best bet for the chocolate is not semi-sweet chips, but use coating chocolate. It works much better, and that is what it was meant for. As for the peanut butter, I'd recommend adding a bit of vanilla extract to this. I make and sell P.B. cups (& other candies) all the time, so I'd say I know a bit about them.

I melted a bar of milk chocolate, only took about 1 1/2 minutes, stirring every 30 secs. It was easy to spread around the cups for me, I just turned them slowly and added more as needed. Everyone that had these asked for the recipe and said they are much better than the Reeses cups! And no preservatives, much healthier!

This is 5 stars for taste and ease for the decadence of these tasty morsels. But, I did have difficulty with the melted chocolate ( I used Ghirardelli Double chocolate chips). Mine didn't pour, I had to spoon it in and spread it manually. Next time I'll melt some shortening with it for to thin it out a little. My peanut butter filling was kinda stiff so I added a little milk to make that a little more spreadable. I know it sounds a little like complaining but it's just what I encountered while doing this recipe by no means will it deter me from making these treats again! My boyfriend loves PB & Chocolate and these fit the bill. Thanks for the recipe.

These were GREAT!!!!! Even my husband liked them!
I found this recipe somewhere else and I picked up a hint from there. One writer recomended that you mix 1/5 of each mixture into the other. (One-fifth of the chocolate into the peanut butter and one-fifth of the peanut butter into the chocolate) I'm going to try this next time! even though the husband will think I'm tring to fatten him up!!!!

These were absolutely yum! I needed them lactose free, so instead of the milk chocolate chips, i melted bittersweet choc chips with a scoop of peanut butter, and some margarine. I also 1/4 cup crushed graham crackers to the peanut butter and confec sugar like another reviewer said. I've never tasted Reese's Peanut Butter cups, but my husband says these taste almost as good!

I've made these several times now, without changing the recipe. The only thing I do differently is put the melted chocolate in a squeeze bottle...it's easier to cover the paper liners this way. Everyone loves these when I make them.

So, so easy and delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly; I used semisweet chocolate chips (one cup + one cup) melted on the stove with about a tablespoon of butter. I also added about a tablespoon of SKOR chips to the filling. I found the recipe yields approx. 18 pieces. 

I will definitely make these again, and I will also: 
1) use smaller paper cups
2) use real peanut butter instead of Skippy
3) use better quality chocolate
4) stick with the SKOR chip addition, because those little crunchy nuggets were seriously awesome.

I brought them to the office for a birthday and they went over REALLY well. :)

These were AMAZING!  They definitely beat the store bought.  I used the paper cup liners and spooned the melted chocolate (which I melted butter in w/ the chocolate) into the tin cups ( about a 1/4 of the way up).  Then put into freezer.  After I mixed up the peanut butter mixture, I took the chocolate cups out of the freezer & added the P.B. (close to the to the top but not quite). I took the rest of the melted chocolate and poured it on the top (with a small spoon) over all the cups and put in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes.  They're great frozen because they pop right out of the cupcake tins!  Then you can eat them chilled or wait til they're room temp.  Total perfection!

Warning: Only make these if you are having a group over or something. Otherwise, you will eat them ALL! These were so good. I never eat junk food or candy but I couldn't stop with these. Easy and fun to make!

I made 1/2 recipe to try this out for fun. I only had semi-sweet chocolate in the house, however, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING MILK CHOCOLATE AS SPECIFIED. Any other chocolate is just way to sweet for the peanut butter cups in my opinion. If you are hoping to have mechanically perfect looking peanut butter cups, that is not what you will get. They do have a homemade appearance. I used a portion scoop for the peanut butter filling, but ended up only using half of it. A little too much work though, when eating peanut butter and chocolate would taste about the same.

Forgot to mention in yesterday's review of these candies:  If you had trouble peeling paper from them, it must have been the brand of cupcake liners.  Mine peeled easily.  I used Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet Chips & Jif Chunky Peanut Butter.  The pb concoction was thick, but spread w/a knife, no prob.

Absolutely amazing! I made these for Easter dessert and they were such a hit, that I've had to make at least 5 more batches for friends and relatives.  I'm making them again tonight for my bowling league. MUST TRY THEM...better than Reese's you buy in the store!!

I followed the original recipe and these turned out SO yummy! The peanut butter was so creamy, and the milk chocolate chips were the perfect match. The only thing I will change for next time is to try using a silicone muffin pan. The paper cups were very time consuming and messy for me, but the taste was worth it!

I agree...it is a mess to make.  I thought it was a lot of work.  Especially trying to get the chocolate to go up the sides without the paper cupcake liner sticking to the spoon!  However, they tasted pretty good.  I love COLD chocolate so I kept them in the refrigerator!  My cousin couldn't believe I made them! Even my father, who doesn't usually eat chocolates, was very impressed!    I probably wouldn't make them as frequently as I would like to...definitely a special occasion item!

I tried this in an 8x8 pan like some had suggested, and it didnt go well.. Chocolate was to hard to cut.  just sort of squished the peanut butter and broke.  I still gave it 5 starts because it tastes great, even though it looks a little gross lol.  Next time I will do it as the recipe says to.

these are amazing!!!  I made them in a little reese cup shaped candy mold and they are perfect.  I did a mixture of milk chocolate and semi sweet chips because that was what I had and they are so much better than real Reese cups.  I love that they are gluten free too!

These are terrific and SO fun to make!! My hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe, making them and then eating them, too! We will be doing this one again and again! We used mini cupcake papers, and used decorating bags to squirt the chocolate around the cup then filled in the bottom and gave them a little shake to fill any spots that were missing chocolate and to smooth them out a bit. Then, using a decorating bag for the peanut butter mix, we filled them with about 1 TBS of the mix and made sure to leave a slight ring of chocolate around the edge of the peanut butter so the top layer of chocolate had something to fuse to and seal the cups up. Once the top layer was on we'd give them a little swirl and tap and they were smooth and professional looking, just the way I like them to be! Popped them into the freezer and in 10 minutes, they were solid and ready for storing. I feel like they still need something, maybe some white chocolate drizzle or something to make them look more festive, but they are a hit!!

My family and I were not impressed with this recipe. The peanut butter mixture does taste like Reese's but the overall results were not great. I used other's reviews and just used a non-stick cupcake pan w/o cups... it didn't work. I had a really hard time getting them out... I actually had to use a butter knife and a spoon to get them out. If I ever try this recipe again, I will try foil cupcake cups. I am giving it 2 out of 5 stars.

Truly outstanding.  I made them in a 8x8 pan as a reviewer had suggested. Very easy. Then cut them them up in small pieces and put them in muffin liner cups.  So decadent as the recipe states!  Thank you!

These are terrific.  I used both regular sized muffin tins and the mini ones...both were out of this world.  I did what one reviewer suggested and that is cool quickly in the freezer, just took minutes!  I know these won't last long at our house!!

Easy, fun and delicious.  I don't see the need to cut the cups first.  I will try it again without cutting the cups and see how it turns out.  My 4 year old had a blast helping me.

Delicious!  My daughter and I loved them.  I used a mini muffin tin sprayed with Pam.  I put them in the freezer for 1/2 hour or so and they popped right out.  Tastes exactly like Reeses.  Thanks for the recipe.

My Boyfriends made these for me as a surprise one day (I had been talking about craving a Reeses)...I mist say, I was certainly impressed! These blew the store-bought kind out of the ballpark! He used dark chocolate instead of milk (baking squares instead of chips) and just good ol' Jif creamy PB. I think I ate three of them in one sitting! We kept the remaining treats in the freezer so that they didn't get all melty. What a perfect bit-sized treat to satisfy my Choco+PB craving!!! :)

Again, how can you go wrong with chocolate and PB? I used about half crunchy PB to half creamy. I also added 1 tspn vanilla as per one reviewer. Next time I'll try to the crushed graham cracker suggestion because I love the grittiness of Reese's. I used mini muffin papers (spreading was not easy or clean); they froze quickly. It helps to keep the PB mixture in the fridge - it's just easier to work with when a little hard. They're deliciously evil! ~UPDATE~ I made these again with 1/4 cup crushed graham - I'd use even more next time. Also, I wanted them bite sized so I just froze the PB mix, rolled them into balls, froze again and then dipped. But that just makes them easier to eat... curses!

These are just as good as the peanut butter cups we pay $$ for from the chocolatier at the mall.  I would give them 5 stars all the way except I believe you do need to add 1/2 cup of crushed graham crackers into the peanut butter to give it a nicer texture.  I also used the mini muffin cups instead of the standard size.  I too think they are better that way since they are very rich.  MMMMM...  I will be making these again and again!   Those that had problems with this recipe should remember that in this recipe the chocolate is the star and you wont get a very good candy if you use a poor quality chocolate.

i made these with mini silicon baking cups (made 18 of them) and soy nut butter to accommodate nut allergies. i also used a medium cookie scoop to place the peanut butter mixture into the cooled chocolate cups so it was easier to get an equal amount in each cup. they're fun to make and fun to eat =]

Very tasty, but a little time consuming.  I do a bar recipe that tastes as good but can whip up in 10 min.  For Valentines treats for my AWANA class I made these in rubber ice cube trays shaped like hearts.  Some of them cracked coming out, obviously not the problem of the recipe, but my own variation on it.

I was little disappointed with the way these tasted when they were done. 

Even with the powdered sugar mixed into the peanutbutter it still tasted bland.

It just tasted like a candybar with peanutbutter smeared on it and another candybar placed on top. 

I was hoping that it would taste very similar to a Reeses Peanutbutter cup .. but it didn't.

I didn't really care for them :\

Super easy and quick to make.  These are really tasty!  I used semi-sweet chocolate and my husband really liked it.  I think I'd like milk chocolate, or a mixture of the two, even better!

These are so yummy, and easy to make!  My husband and I loved them.  Just be careful when melting the chocolate chips in the microwave;  you don't want to cook them too long or they get kind of solid again untill they start to cool down.  It only took me 1 minute in my microwave.  Also, they are very messy to eat!  The chocolate melts on your hands, but they taste so good that they are worth it!

I have made this several times and although they may not look perfect with my impatient hand - they taste amazing. Always well received. I do add the graham crackers into the peanut butter mixture which I think takes it up a notch. I have a silicone mini cup cake tray - best thing ever - they pop right out. :) Thanks!

Overall a great recipe, but I agree it needs some gram crackers in the peanut butter. I took the recommendation to add 1/4 cup, but I think it needed at least 1/2 to be similar to recces. 
Also - use reusable silicone cups! They popped right out!

Great recipe.  I did my melting on the stove, and heated the peanut butter up to make it more pliable.  Someone else suggested adding crushed graham crackers to the peanut butter, which was a great idea. I left out the confectioner's sugar as unnecessary, added a little vanilla, and used dark chocolate chips; the end result was delicious.  I was a little afraid they were going to be hard to get out of the paper cups, but after some freezer time they weren't at all.

These were good and not to hard to make. They are a little rich.

i served this on my little girl's 7th b-day and the kids devoured it. Made a slight modification on the recipe to cut down a bit on the sugar and used just 1/4 cup, also used bitter-sweet chocolate chips and it was still a kid-magnet! They even asked me to make more for the family reunion.

These are awesome - I melted a tiny bit of butter with the chocolate and used crunchy peanut butter.  Also added a little vanilla to the peanut butter filling and used dark chocolate rather than milk.  They are so fast and easy to make - most of the time is just waiting for the chocolate to harden in the fridge.  ALSO great to make ahead - I am planning an event next week and will be adding these to the menu as I can do them a day or two ahead of time!  They are perfect - never want to eat another fakey artificial Reese's candy again!

Very "filling". Rather than making a bunch of smaller cups, I made one huge one that could be sliced up. After having only a small portion equal in size to one of the store-bought cups, I was done. The peanut butter mixture Is much more like actual peanut butter than the peanut butter cups bought in stores, which makes it seem much more fillingl. Also it was much sweeter than the store bought kind, but that's just because I used half semi-sweet, half milk chocolate chips. Would make it again, I just have to refine the process a little.

Really simple! I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I had no chocolate chips so I used a bunch of Easter chocolate my daughter wasn't going to eat, and it turned out well. The peanut butter filling tasetes almost exactly like the store bought stuff! I also used crunchy peanut butter, since everyone in my family prefers that. Next time I think I may try semi-sweet chips since I am not a fan of milk chocolate as much!

This didn't turn out right at all. I followed the instruction directly. against my better judgement, I used the muffin cups. I shouldn't have. They wouldn't come out.  For some reason, even though I divided perfectly, there wasn't enough chocolate to really cover all the tops. and there was too much peanutbutter. It took forever for the tops to harden, so I popped them into the freezer. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will use one of the recipes that calls for melting the peanutbutter. That would have made it easier. and I'll skip the muffin cups next time.

Use high quality chocolate.  Adding the crushed graham crackers made the texture more Reese's-like.  Reading that the paper muffin liners stuck, I sprayed my muffin tin generously with non-stick spray.  They still stuck horrendously.  I would try going to a craft store and getting waxy or metallic candy cup liners next time... but the recipe itself is fantastic!  My husband said it tasted like fancy candy store peanut butter cups!

These were great. Made these to take to the neighbors for the Superbowl and got lots of compliments. After reading other reviews I also added some butter and vanilla to the peanut butter mixture.

Love, love, love this recipe. Will agree with others that it is messy to make but the end result is so worth it. My husband loves them to! Will definitley make again, but maybe try them in foil wrappers and see if they remove a little easier.

These were super easy to make! To me the chocolate was a little much and overwhelmed the peanut butter, and I could have used a bit more salt. Overall they were quick easy and delicious and I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Extremely easy & addictive! Can't wait to give them as gifts. I swirled some of the peanut butter & chocolate on top and they look like a fancy candy you'd spend big bucks on! Next batch I'm going to try crunchy peanut butter.

I decided to use semi-sweet chocolate chips because that was what I had on hand. I think it would have been better with the milk chocolate, mine were way too rich! I followed the suggestions of others and put the chocolate directly on the muffin tin (use lots of cooking spray!) This seemed to work out well. They popped right out.

Rich and delishes. 1 cup of peanut butter was to much, so next time I will use a half cup of peanut butter and half the salt and sugar.

I would change it up a bit so they are not sooooo sweet. I feel that you don't need to add sugar to the peanut butter when making these. The chocolate makes them sweet enough. I am excited to switch up the many variations that are possible for these familiar treats.

Two minutes in my microwave is too long to melt the chocolate. I stirred after one minute and continued for the second minute. The chocolate burned. I found it a lot sweeter than the store brand. I will continue to buy Reece's.

This is a great and easy recipe! So quick to whip up. I think I spent 45 min total and they turned out great. I did melt the chocolate on the stove with some milk and butter instead of the micowave(I burned the first batch of chocolate in there!) and I also added vanilla in the peanut butter mixture like the other reviewers. So yummy and everyone loved them!

Super easy recipe :) My family and I LOVE chocolate and peanut butter together, and these were soooooo yummy! All I had o hand were semi-sweet chocolate chips, and it tasted like DARK chocolate peanut butter cups :P Next time, I'll use milk chocolate chips. Either way, they were delicious!

These taste fantastic!  I made them exactly as described.  My recommendations are to (1) don't overheat your chocolate chips in the microwave and (2) cut the amount of peanut butter down a little bit; my PB cups were exploding!  Though, maybe that's a good thing ;)

YUM!  This is a great recipe for ease.  I used mini cupcake/muffin papers and found a melon ball to be the perfect size for the chocolate and peanut butter.  I put the round end of the melon baller in the center in order for the chocolate to come up the sides.  I did have extra peanut butter filling left.  Thanks for sharing I will make these again.

I make these alot. I use the candy paper cups. I arrange the cups on a cookie sheet (w/sides) and mix 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 dark chocolate chips or candy melting wafers. Spoon a bit into the cup, add p. butter, then top with more chocolate. I also sometimes mix crunchy and creamy p. butter. Another variation - I top them with crushed peanuts. After assembling, I place the tray in the freezer for about 20 mins. They harden and settle nicely. The candy cups are nice in that you can serve or give the candy away and they have a neat presence...if they are just for us, I remove the papers and put the candy in a zip lock bag and keep in the freezer.

A-MAZ-ING!  A little messy to coat the bottom of the paper cups, but WELL worth the effort.  I used DOVE chocolates (mixed milk w/dark) & used crunchy peanut butter.  I also keep them in the fridge 'cause they're so good cold.  Everyone that tasted them were completely blown with the first bite.  Several people have said why would anyone eat another Reese's PB cup after having one of these!

Great recipe, tastes good, the only problem is that IT STICKS TO THE PAN. YES, I oiled the pan well. But they're still stuck fast. I don't know how it worked for other people, it's really misleading when some people say use the cups and others say just oil the pan. But next time, I'm using foil cups....

This recipe is so easy and quick!   I followed it to the tee the first time, and the second time, I just kind of eyeballed it. You have to play with it, but this is the way to go!  I used regular-sized silicone baking cups to make giant ones - what a hit!!! They were even easier to work with than the paper cups too.  Enjoy!

Loved it. Loved it loved it loved it. I think next time I'll know to put a little less peanut butter in them but they were just wonderful. Thank you so much for the recipe. I think I may make these often! The best part is, the kids can do most of the work.

These were very good. but I made the mistake of using semisweet chocolate and it was very chocolately, but still very good. My sister who doesn't like peanut butter loved these. I also made them with white chocolate and they were very good as well.

I made these for a co-workers b-day. Everyone loved them. They were surprisingly easy to make, and They were very tasty. They are very comparable to Recees cups. But make sure you store in fridge and take out a few minutes before serving so they stay firm. And when you serve them, make sure they arent sitting out too long without being eaten or they will start to melt. Very Yummy! I am making some more tonight.

I got a lot of compliments on this recipe, but I think I will follow some of the other reviewers advice and add some graham cracker crumbs to the peanut butter. The peanut butter was soft and creamy, but I think it would taste a bit more like "Reeses" if the graham cracker crumbs were added. I used a silicone mini-cupcake pan and it worked out perfect...the cups just popped out and didn't even use a nonstick spray. Good chocolate fix.

I found this recipe did not call for enough icing sugar. I put crushed graham crackers in it as well as extra icing sugar. I added more salt as well. I tryed making it in the muffin cups but I found it a lot quicker and easier to just roll up the peanut butter mixture and dip it in the melted chocolate. After all these changes it was really good. My sister cannot stop eating them as well as me. :) It got a 4 star because I had to change it so much.

Good recipe, but not exactly like Reese's.  I thought the dough was too soft to handle so I added another 1/4 to 1/3 cup of powdered sugar plus 4 crushed graham crackers, like other recipes call for.  To me it makes the texture of the center more like the real thing.  I also added another 1/4 t. of salt.  The real thing is also more salty.

Love this recipe!  I would suggest melting the chocolate chips over the stove though on medium heat, to avoid burning in the microwave.  This can also be made with semi-sweet chips (my hubby's favorite way).  And to make them super yummy looking, drizzle them with white chocolate!

These were really good but i made the mistake of not trimming the paper liners first, so i ended up with really big peanut butter cups. I also ended up not having enough ingredients and had to make more (my error :) ) anyways, they tasted really good but i think i would add more confectioners sugar to the peanut butter next time to make them more simular to reeses peanut butter cups. The peanut butter in the center was still a little too sticky for me. Overall, yummy recipe though:)

These were absolutly wonderful - tasted like something you get at a gourmet candy shop.  I used my silicon muffin cups for these, and made them quite big - a full muffin size!  I call them my 'peanut butter buckets' :)

A great Christmas candy recipe.  The only thing you have to be careful of is not to fill the top layer of chocolate to high into the cup because it will stick to the paper making it difficult to peel. It is better to make without using the paper cups.  I received lots of compliments for this candy.

Very time consuming but worth it. I decided to put everything into PB cup molds and make mini-PB cups.  I then placed the end result in the mini-decorative paper liners.  In addition, I put the PB in the microwave at 50% power so that it would easily mix with the sugar and melted the chocolate in a double boiler.

They did seem easy and fast (if you use the freezer) to make and they weren't bad but something was not right.  The choc. seemed too firm for the filling maybe.  I tried them frozen, refridgerated and at room temp.  Frozen seemed to give the best consistancy between filling and choc.  I don't know.  Will probably not make again.

Very Good! I used a cake decorator to fill the cups w/ peanut butter and to top them. Use the medium size round tip and it saves the mess to make them. Still a bit messy to eat, but good!

These dont take anywhere near 2 hours to make. They usually take me about 30 minutes. Especially after you make them a few times, and get the hang of it. They are really tasty! My husband always begs for them.

Sorry - I can only give this 3 stars.  I found them a bit awkward to make.  Wish I would have just "brushed" the chocolate up the sides.  They were way too sweet.  An easier way is to mix chocolate and chunky peanut butter together and pour into tiny muffin cups.

These were delicious!! The only trouble I had was making the top layer of chocolate go on smoothly. I would recommend microwaving the chocolate on 70% power for 45 seconds, stir, then maybe 15 more seconds, or until smooth. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were a huge hit with friends!  Although I did make some modifications- added about 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs to the "filling" (this gave it more substance) and added about 1 tablespoon of shortening to the chocolate (so it would spread better).  I also found that I needed to add a little bit of water to the filling (especially after adding the cracker crumbs).  Fantastic!

These were very good, but very messy to make.  I used milk choc chips like the recipe stated, but the melted chocolate didn't spread well.  I added a little milk to the melted choc and re-heated for about 10 seconds.  It made it much easier to spread.  I'm not sure how long it takes to set without using the milk, but I put mine in the fridge for about 30 minutes for the chocolate to set.

These were AWEsome in flavour.
I wasn't able to pour the chocolate & had to spread in the cups(messy!). I will take previous suggestions to remedy this. Next time I will use crunchy peanut butter, as we REALLY like our nuts :)

This recipe was fantastic!  Very easy and not real time consuming.  I used white chocolate chips instead of the milk chocolate (my husband LOVES white chocolate) and they turned out just great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great and easy.  Didn't have paper liners.  Just sprayed a teflon muffin tin and after an hour in the freezer, they popped right out.  Thanks.

Oh my goodness! These are delicious! My 8 year old son is allergic to peanuts and was lamenting after Halloween that he couldn’t eat Reese’s peanut butter cups. I made these using Sunflower butter instead of peanut butter. It worked perfectly and tastes wonderful.

There are a couple peanut butter cup recipes on here. This is the easiest and most versatile to follow and adapt to different needs. As I did using candy molds for peanut butter dark chocolate squares.

I was fortunate to have picked up mini silicone moulds for chocolate cups.  These were perfect!   I painted the chocolate in them with a mini brush. Let them set in the fridge 10 minutes while I cleaned up, mixed the filling and melted more chocolate. I took the moulds out of the fridge and coated them again with another layer of chocolate.  Set them in the fridge a couple minutes while I melted more chocolate for the top.  I put the filling in a sandwich bag and cut the corner off so it resembled a piping bag.  Piped in the filling and covered the top with chocolate to seal it. Back in the fridge 5 minutes and my husband was already eating them. Now I’m looking for more filling ideas for my chocolate cups.

These were completely delicious! I’d say even better than the brand name ones. I added extra vanilla to the peanut butter mixture and used a muffin tin that was sprayed with vegetable oil. Only one of these is enough to satisfy a chocolate lover! They were really quick to harden too, only taking 25 minutes or less. Would make again!

These are easy using a few little tricks. Use a silicone 24 mini muffin mold, it makes filling & removing a breeze and prettiest finish.  I use 3/4 cup of sugar, makes PB dough easy to shape. I use oil instead of butter to thin chocolate for easier flow. Then I just fill muffin cups 1/2 with chocolate stick a large ball of PB in until the chocolate oozes up the sides and then lay on a top layer of chocolate.  It's so much easier this way than using paper cups and letting the bottom harden ate you try to make walls.. They were the biggest hit among my holiday treats this year.

I made this with my 4 yr old granddaughter. I left out the salt and crumbled an individual pkg. (6-8) of Annie’s Bunny Graham Crackers to the filling. These were excellent and tasted like the store bought. I liked that they use less sugar than other recipes. Will definitely make again.

Decided to give this recipe a try as I had the ingredients on hand. I made a few minor changes that some other people suggested. I used 1/4cup of confectioners sugar, no salt, and a splash of vanilla. I also used a small splash of vegetable oil while melting the chips to help smooth it out. I decided to use a mini muffin tin with foil liners, worked just fine. The only downside was that assembly was a messy affair. I think next time I'll try someone's suggestion and pipe the ingredients in. I'd also try to thicken the peanut butter up a bit more. They came out great and tasted amazing. This could be dangerous as the husband and kids have requested more. Thanks for sharing!

Yes, definitely use milk choc chips.  Make sure to use as little chocolate as possible, because if you use too much it is very hard to bite into.

I loved making the peanut butter cups. I was bored and I tried using Nutella. Best tasting sweet ever!! I followed the peanut butter cup recipe but instead of peanut butter I used Nutella.

This recipe is pretty good but I have some changes I would try next time. I'm going to try adding some flour to the peanut butter layer as I find it too gooey as is. I added a little coconut oil to my chocolate layer to make it smoother and it adds a hint of coconut flavour.

I made these as a Christmas treat and they were amazing!  However I made them with a smaller cup and wound up having way to much peanut butter. Next time I will be sure to half the peanut butter, salt and confectioners sugar if I use the same cups. I will definitely make these again.

Made these one day when the kid, and we had a blast making them.  Very easy to make and they tasted great.  The only thing i found is the peanut butter center was a bit too soft.  I couldn't get it to get thick.  I think next time I might try adding some graham crackers in to try and thicken the peanut butter mix.

These were really easy. I sprayed a mini muffin tin with coconut oil and after prying with a butter knife they popped right out....after being in freezer for just a few minutes.  The graham cracker crumbs are a must if you want the same texture as store bought. I also put the peanut butter filling in a Baggie and "piped" it onto the chocolate. It made it much easier than fighting with a spoon.   Delicious...hubby loved them!

I made these with almond butter instead, because of an allergy. I made them in small silicone muffin pans instead of paper cups - not messy at all, and really easy to pop out. Sprayed a little bit of oil on beforehand, and sprinkled a tiny bit of fleur de sel on the tops of each. So yummy!!

Used regular sugar instead of confection sugar (what ever that is). They were slightly difficult to make, but tasted good. Not sure if real reeces is easier/better.

Was super easy to do. I had to grease my mini muffin pan. Worked out good. I used melting chocolate and chips. I think I will use melting chocolate from now on. But thus was great either way. Thanks for sharing

I got little creative. I made the original PB cups but I ALSO went a step further and substituted chocolate for Butterscoth for my second batch (PB "smoothie) and NUTELLA SPREAD for the peanut butter for the next batch. They all went above and beyond expectations! These were simple to make AND amazing! I added approx. a tablespoon of vanilla extract to the peanut butter/Nutella mixture. 

I don't want to hear anyone ever say "good things DON'T come in small packages!" Because, let me tell you, these pack the punch! I made these for Halloween and blew everyone away. Thank you!!!

I made these as a surprise for my Reeses-loving husband. He was in heaven, he thought they were the best things in the world. I, however, thought they were a bit too hard. I don't know, I'm used to peanut butter cups that are really soft and that melt in your mouth. They did taste good, though. I just didn't enjoy having to gnaw on them.

used semi-sweet chips as that's what i had. Milk chocolate would definately be better but regardless, these are not worth the mess. They're messy to make, to remove from pan, to clean up and even to eat. The filling tastes nothing like Reece's. Spend the buck and buy them if you have a craving.

It was great but it was a lot of effort for such little treats. I had a hard time withe pushing the chocolate up the side of the cups.

This is recipe is extremely yummy! I had my doubts about making this because my son who love's Peanut Butter Cups by Reese is hard to please. Not to mention, the microwave step didn't seem all to appetizing. But trust me, these cups are delicious and they come out looking just like the picture! Try these, you won't regret it!!

I wasn't going to make these, but they just looked too fun to pass up. So, with just the two of us here, I reduced the recipe to "2" servings and made four mini cups in a tassie pan (mini muffin pan). Used semi sweet chips, because that's what we have, and reduced salt to a sprinkling of sea salt over the pb/sugar mixture in what appeared to be appropriate amount. DH liked, and we'll do again some time when we have the sweeter chocolate chips, but really the semi-sweet worked for me.

Very messy... was not a neat project.  The taste will depend on your chocolate choice and preference.  My family liked them.  I wanted my daughter to help me, but after step one, and the clean up involved I opted to finish them myself, and it was still a mess. Not easy to get the chocolate smoothly/uniformly into the cups.

i made this last night...the finished product was a little too rich for me...but i made an extra batch and used less salt and it came out perfect!  a tip for adding the peanut bbutter mixture...if you heat it up the same way you do the chocolate chips it is easier to spread...microwave for 2 mins...stirring after each minute, then pour the top layer of chocolate over it. the chocolate layers and peanut butter may mix a little bit...but once refrigerated it comes out fine.

Wow.  Delicious is an understatement.  A few notes: 1.  Using semi-sweet chips turned out yummy, but way too messy!  The chocolate ends up all over your fingers everytime you eat it.  Will use milk choc. like recipe states next time. 2.  Don't glop the choc. on top of the peanut butter in a thick layer.  I did this the first time and it was yum, but too thick.  Think of a Reece's and how thin it is.  Go for that. 3.  Add sprinkles or Heath toffee bits on the top of chocolate while it is warm.  Tastes great and looks cool!

GREAT recipe! I usually reduce the sugar in everything I make, but I resisted and made these exactly according to the recipe. They were perfect. I wrapped them in a small celophane bag and tied them with a pretty bow and gave them to a 15 year old friend of mine for a birthday gift. She loved them. I did use all organic ingredients. Can't wait to make these again.

So amazingly delicious! I did half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips which made these especially rich. I made mini ones and regular sized ones...probably would have liked the bigger better but I didn't use the paper cups, so I had a hard time getting them out of the pan.  My husband is already requesting they be made again soon!

Made these last night exactly as the recipe stated. They were good, but everyone agreed that it was too much chocolate, not enough peanut butter. Will make this again, but adjust the recipe to our tastes. Also, I found filling the paper liners to be annoying and messy. I'll use a mini muffin pan next time and skip the liners entirely.

I used this recipe to make assorted chocolates for my husband on valentines day. They came out great! I used one of the silicone pans with several little heart shapes in it and I put peanut butter in some then I dropped an almond in the some, and I even dropped a cherry in some of them. It was a great suprise to reach for a chocolate and not know what you were going to get.

These were good.  Tricky materials to spread nicely, though!  LOL!  It doesn't matter...they taste great.  The filling was a little more malleable than I had expected (maybe because I used crushed up Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal instead of graham crackers since I was out).  Still - YUM!  The kids thought I was super cool!

These are good but most things with chocolate and peanut butter are. I do like fillings that use butter a bit better so I think I will use that next time. I also used mini muffin cups and made mini peanut butter cups instead of trimming larger paper cups.

These peanut butter cups are sooo easy to make and sooo good!  I do believe that i like them more than the famous Reese's cups.  Make sure you have an ice cold glass of milk at the ready because these peanut butter cups are just so rich and creamy.  SINFUL!!

I got tons of rave reviews when I made these!  You have to take your time to do it right, but I thought it was worth it.  The creamy peanut butter filling is much better than store bought.  I will definitely make again.

I made these as a Valentine's Day treat for my hubby and oldest son. They are enjoying them, but both say they're almost too rich. I don't eat them myself (this was a true labor of love as I don't like peanut butter in the slightest), so this rating is based on their reviews. They weren't difficult to make, but were a little time consuming. I had filling left over, so I melted more chips and made PB patties with it. I also topped the cups with chocolate hearts (semi-sweet) that I had left over from another project.

My 1st review! I just had to comment on this recipe. I took these to a party and everyone thought they were store bought. They said it was better than Reese's cups! If only they knew how EASY it was... I used both regular and mini size muffin pans. I think the mini sized ones were cuter and better since they were so decadent. As other reviewers have stated, spraying some non-stick spray really helped. It's messy but totally worth it.

I use semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate.
 They were delicious, but you just can't go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate.

I made these and every single one was devoured!  They are much better when they are cold though opposed to room temperature.

These are awesome but I will use the idea of spraying the muffin pan and pop them out instead of the liners.  Thanks for sharing!!1

These are good for a chocolate peanut butter fix. They don't taste like a reese's but they are good in their own way. Easy to make. Hard to wait for them to be set up before eating!
I did make the peanut butter mixture into little discs that would go right over the top of the bottom layer of chocolate. Made for an even layer of peanut butter and chocolate in each bite.

So easy and so worth it!  I made without the papercups as well, and like the others, they popped out.  I loved them cold, warm, breakfast and dessert.

Very good, very rich. Tastes just like a Reese's Big Cup! Making it was messy though. Maybe it was just me. I don't think I will make this again, but only because it tastes exactly like a Reese's, so I might as well just buy Reese's instead of going through the trouble of making them myself. But they are very tasty!

These are soooo easy to make and taste great!  I think the 2 hour prep time is on the high side as my kids and I made these start to finish in about an hour. Chilling the chocolate in the freezer after the first step will save some time.  I would recommend making 2 batches as these go very quickly once you let others have a taste! Who knew something so easy really could taste so good?

These are great! They are a little hard to "assemble" but it's the perfect mix of chocolate and peanut butter. I prefer semisweet chocolate. The only problem with them is that I might have to share!

easy to make, but there were a little too much of each ingredient for the yield.  Maybe a little too much chocolate too.

The next time I try these I will use a mini muffin tin. They were very rich. They were also very messy to make. My kids thought they were delicious.

These were VERY good!!!  The only thing is that the salt made the peanut butter kind of crunchy.  I don't know if it's really necessary.  Will definately make again!!!

These were so good! They're not hard to make either, like I thought they would be. I didn't end up using all of the peanut butter mixture and they were still really peanut buttery.

These were hugely successful.  They are much easier than I thought they would be and were SO MUCH better than Reese's.
