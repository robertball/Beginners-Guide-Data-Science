I made this prime rib roast today. My husband and my guests really enjoyed the roast and the au jus.  I felt the au jus was too salty, so along with the other vegetables I added two medium sized sliced potatoes and some of the water from potatoes I had boiled to make mashed potatoes.  Those additions seemed to soak up the excess salt and the result was very good.  When I make this again I will use a little more red wine and a couple of potatoes in the au jus.

I made this last Christmas and it is simply fabulous!  Making it again this year.  I do not add salt; with all the other ingredients it's not necessary.  Definitely restaurant quality and the best Prime Rib I've EVER had!  Thanks for sharing!

I only made the au jus, and it was excellent!  Prime rib does not create many drippings, so this recipe for a broth was necessary!  If you are making a large prime rib, I would double the au jus recipe.  Serve next to some horseradish, and you are set to enjoy the prime rib.

I made this for Christmas dinner and was fabulous.  When the roast reach 135 degrees, I took the roast out of the oven.  Increased the oven temperature to 450 degrees and put the roast back in the oven for 10 minutes to get a deep brown outside color.  Next time, I will mix all the herbs with olive oil before coating the rib roast.  This should help infuse the herb flavors into the roast.

There are several different roasting methods for prime rib, but all end results rely on using a meat thermometer to determine the desired internal temperature of the meat.  That being said, I did use a different roasting method, but liked the recipe here for the meat coating/rub and also for the au jus.   As I had a 5 lb roast, I was able to halve the ingredients for the coating.  Even so, I severely cut the amount of beef base using just enough to allow the rub ingredients to adhere to the roast.  I also decreased a bit the amount of oregano called for and added instead a bit of dried rosemary. The star of this recipe in my way of thinking is the au jus.   If your roast is 10 pounds as the recipe directs, I suggest making a double recipe of the au jus.  After reducing the sauce, I strained it as directed and then pressed the vegetables against the strainer to get every last drop of goodness from them.  Absolutely delicious!

I never cooked Prime Rib before and it turned out perfect. I had a 12 lb. roast and needed some to be rare and some well done. So I cut it in half. I put one in at 425 F an hour before the other.  I also added digon mustard to the rub.  Thanks for the help!

I used this recipe for the au jus and made an herb-crusted rib roast from another recipe I had. I doubled the au jus recipe and it was plenty for the five pound roast we had.  I used Better than Bouillon beef base and I didnâ€™t find it too salty.  It was delicious and very flavorful and I plan to make it again.

I made this with steamed broccoli & a baked potato. I put half of the oregano the recipe says to use. My family wants this to be our tradition for every Christmas now.

I was looking for a good au jus recipe. I didn't make the prime rib this way since it was already made.  I used the Premium Better than Bouillon Roast Beef Base, SOO good.  This is a wonderful, full flavored au jus. My husband had me make sure  I saved the recipe, and he's rather picky.  All around winner! Thank you for the lovely recipe.

I had given this 4-stars a while ago but I revisited it- and the roast was as close to perfection as any I've ever made!  Without ANY changes except decreasing the paste rub amount in half, this came out beautifully and extremely moist/flavorful.  Now that I have adjusted for our preference of a less thick crust, I don't think I'll ever make any other version again.  (-:   Just wish I had kept a picture because the current photo doesn't do justice to how beautiful it is...
