This was fun to make and it tasted authentic. I used half water and half coconut milk instead of just water.  It was a little too spicy, next time I will only use one pepper.

Instead of using vinegar, I used fresh lime juice.  I diced on scotch bonnet pepper and placed the other in the pot, whole.  Then I used coconut milk instead of using water.  The taste was fresh with a little back heat.

It was really good, I’ve had goat out,  lots of times however this was my first time making it, I really enjoyed how the seasonings in the rub, still Adhered to the meat, once we arrived at the boiling process I’m looking forward to making it again.

Put potatoes and other ingredients after first having stewed the goat meat for half and hour. This way the vegetables are not overcooked. I added some rum and sugar to the marinade. The result was very authentic.
