Yum, my husband said these were the best meatballs I've ever made. They are so moist & flavorful. I will admit that I subbed ingredients that I had on hand. I only had 1 pound of 85/15 sirloin. I had homemade ww seasoned bread crumbs so I used a bit less milk. I only had monterrey jack. I always sneak veggies in so I added garlic, carrots and celery with the onion & chopped very fine in the food processor. I cooked them at 325 for longer just to make sure the carrots cooked. We are eating it over ww penne. Delish! I'll make meatballs with natural applesauce often!

This was very good. Nice and homey. It had a creamy mild sauce and wasn't weird with the celery at all. I only had chipotle cheddar on hand so that is what I used. My hubby loved this and went back for seconds. I didn't have canned milk so I used 2% and it turned out fine. Thanks Pipster, we liked this a lot.

These were very good. A nice change from meat loaf and other ground beef dishes. I am always looking for new things, after 40 years of cooking you kind of run out of ideas. I made these as the recipe was written. Served with salad and buttered noodles. Thanks for the recipe, from one grandmother to another  :-)

These meatballs were so tastey and easy to make! They have such a comforting and homey feel without being too heavy. I did double the sauce (we like lots) and added a little sage and thyme to the sauce, but other wise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Nice one. I did some changed. Used rice milk instead of cow one, and cream of broccoli soup.

i only made the meatballs out of this recipe as i'm out of creamed soups and was just going to toss them with marinara and some pasta.. i didn't add any salt to the meatballs but wish i would have as my croutons weren't salty enough.. i think swapping parm for the cheddar would fix this though.. there's always a next time.. i do like how they were very moist and the subtle sweetness from the applesauce.. on a side note.. i made 65 little meatballs and thought this would be great if i had kids to help make them.. ty for the recipe

Realizing I had a lot of ground chuck in my freezer that needed to be used, I started looking for meatball recipes. This looked good and boy, was it! I used garlic and cheddar seasoned crotons and left out both of the other cheeses as my husband is not a big cheese fan. Never missed them but I'm sure they would not have hurt anything. Used one can of cream of celery and one of cream of potato and 1% milk (added 1 T. of flour) for the sauce because that's what I had. Very tasty sauce over either mashed potatoes or noodles and served with steamed asparagus. Definitely a keeper!
