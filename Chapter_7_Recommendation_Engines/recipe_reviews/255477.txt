I thought the bread needed a bit more cinnamon, but this loaf was moist and the topping truly made it a five-star loaf.  I doubled the recipe to make two loaves (and used one 15oz can of pumpkin between the two loaves) and even my picky teen loved it.  It was great as a dessert or with coffee in the morning.  Froze really well, too!

Love it! Had to use non fat milk but it turned out moist and flavorful. I will be adding to my holiday baking list. Pattie Johns

I found this to be one of the best pumpkin breads...the streusel topping is a great addition to the recipe.  I will definitely make again---will be making for Christmas.
