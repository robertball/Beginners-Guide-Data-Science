I found this to be lacking in flavor so I added extra jalapeno sauce. This has a consistency of a dip and works well as such.

Because I didn't have yogurt, I put in 1/4 cup mayo and I didn't have hot sauce so I used some cayenne.  It is yummy.  Next time I will do it with the yogurt.  This is a great way to use up avocado's.  It is yummy!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this dressing as a dip. I had fresh cilantro on hand and added some.  It was especially tasty with cucumber spears and celery.

Followed recipe as is.  This was awesome no changes needed. If you use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt it is the perfect consistency.

This dressing is amazing as is! So creamy and flavorful.  Our was a little thick which was fine. But, since it was it was great as a veggie dip too. In the future I plan to use this on grilled veggies and pasta salad. Very versatile dressing.

Quick and easy.  I substituted the chili sauce and pepper with Mrs. Dash original flavor to reduce sodium and retain flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Great as spread on sandwiches or on salads with added EVOO.

Made it as given to start,  but did add enough cilantro to make it greener. Also added a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise.  Loved the lemon which balanced out the other flavors. Great with veggies too!

I was looking for a recipe that tasted more like guacamole than anything else. I exchanged the yogurt for mayo because I did not want the tangy taste, plus we love mayo. Left out the hot sauce, and added 1/2 tsp cumin. Forgot the black pepper but will add it next time, and it was really good. My family loved it. I made a chicken taco salad and used this as the dressing.

A bit  tangy  per the recipe. I added a few drops of Agave.  Also a tad thick, but all in all, it was good. I would make it again. This recipe made slightly over a cup.

Found the dressing to be too salty so I added more olive oil and yogurt. I also increased the garlic because I like garlic.  I did not have hot sauce so I used a good pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and added fresh parsley. It is delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly bit it came out too thick for a salad dressing, it was more like a dip but that is okay it is very tasty. To make it more like a salad dressing I added a tad more EVOO & some water, just enough water to thin it our for pouring.  Was asked for the recipe more than once.  Great dressing for chopped / all vegie salad too.

Delicious! As a caveat, I actually used Greek yogurt  instead of regular and added water to thin out the consistency. Tastes great!

I would definitely make it again. The lemon taste was a bit strong when I first tasted it but once I started eating it with my salad, I loved it!! I used coconut oil instead but because it was sooo thick, I would use 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/4 to make it more like a dressing instead of a dip. It tasted really good though! And I left out the hot sauce

Very easy, I actually combined ingredients into a small blender that uses a bottle made for smoothies etc. Did not have enough yogurt so I made up the rest with sour cream. Very good dressing, even my husband loved it and he's not a huge avocado fan.

Great recipe! I used sour cream instead of yogurt. I had to add water because it was too thick, probably because my avocado was so big.

The combination of the yogurt and lemon juice was not to my liking. Also if you wanted it to be a dressing you needed to add more oil or water. Mine was a tan color.

Only change I made was to add less of the hot sauce (for my hubby). I like that this can be used as a dressing or as a dip. Tasty!

I made this according to the recipe but used siracha as the hot sauce. I had to put in more than 1/4 teaspoon, maybe 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. It perfectly  suited my watercress salad. Watercress has a strong flavour and it shouldn't be overpowered by a strongly flavoured dressing.

I think this mught be good as a bread dip but to me, it tasted awful on a bed of lettuce. Even with the lemon juice it turns kind of a green/brownish colour so it isn't appetizing to look at. I wouldn't make again.

Too sour with the amount of lemon juice and plain yogurt. Changed the lemon juice to 1 tablespoon, omitted the oil and add 1 teaspoon stevia.
