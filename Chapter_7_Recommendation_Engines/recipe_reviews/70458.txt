This is a good and economical recipe. Instead of salt pork,I use butter and olive oil. Chopped 2 onions, Keilbasa or pork steak cut in strips. Cook those before adding the cabbage. Add frozen peas once the cabbage cooks down, season with plenty of salt and pepper. Toss in the egg noodles and you have supper.

This is similar to my family recipe.  We don't ever use salt pork (olive oil to coat this til it glows)
We also saute onion with the cabbage and cook them until the onion is transparent.  Add the noodles and voila - a new batch is ready.  My Ukrainian husband also added this to his recipe repetorie.

Very delish! I used bacon ,added thinly sliced onion,I had to add a couple splashes of white wine to cook the cabbage down in (I drained off a little of the bacon fat) and served with Weiner Schnitzel.

Great!  It's even faster if you buy a pre-shredded bag of cabbage.  One thing to note - if you use purple cabbage and have leftovers, the purple cabbage 'bleeds' on the noodles, and the next day, the dish doesn't look so appetizing. I had a Ukranian version of this recipe:  saute the cabbage in a little butter until tender, then add the noodles, salt, pepper, and 1/2 tsp. sugar.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used the review from lilquiz because I had pork and cabbage to use up. It needed lots of S&P. Could use something else to give it more flavor; like sausage or ham or some sort of spice. I'll have to experiment.

I believe that the use of egg noodles in the Kapusta would actually make it Haluski. Doesn't matter much with or without the noodles both are really good comfort food. I too substitute thick cut bacon lardons for the salt pork. It just gives it a nice smokier flavor. Additionally I will usually include thin sliced onion. Depending on my mood I'll also use split peas. Put them right in dry. It just give a little different texture to it and slightly different taste. It's all good though.

This sounds simple and fast. The Kapusta I make, handed down, takes about 3-4 hours minumum, has more ingredients, and no kluski. Of course, you can't be shy about the fat or sodium, sorry. I do know most people who never ate it because they hear "sour", love it. Used to use pork neck back in the day, but bone chips turned me to smoked pork shoulder, of course I still use salt pork fried up, for a base for the gravy to thicken it up. My starch is the potatos. I'll try to dig up a photo for the curious

Very good!!!  I did substitute 6 slices of bacon for the salt pork but followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Hubby was surprised as he thought it wouldn't be very good but he enjoyed it as much as I did!  Definitely a keeper recipe!

This is a recipe for Halushki and not kapusta by the use of noodles. still very good and even better with added sliced sauteed onions.
