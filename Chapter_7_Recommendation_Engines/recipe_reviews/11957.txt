This was divine and really so easy.  The only hard part was finding D'Autunno pasta.  I eventually just substituted garlic and spinach pasta for it and it worked extremely well.  I put the chicken in right after the garlic so it would have a better chance to brown and cook through.

The sauce was amazing, a refreshing taste to the regular spagetti sauce. The noodles i didn't do right, so they were a bit 'unusual' i'll have to give them another try. They were beautiful however, just a little more difficult to work with.  It was delicious!

Green peppers turned out to be overcooked while the chicken stayed raw.  But it was easy to prepare, at least.  Seems like a waste of energy and not so good for the environment to heat an oven just to warm some plates, so I didn't do that.

Quite delicious. I found leaf pasta, but not the flavored stuff so I settled on non leaf flavored pasta. Also,, no Burgundy, so I used all Chardonnay . I really liked the richness of this.. leftovers for dinner tonight!
