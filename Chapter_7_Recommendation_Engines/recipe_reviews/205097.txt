Okay, this stuff is delicious!  A bit too sweet for my tastes, and I halved the sugar, but the recipe title warns you so if you don't like sweet and don't cut down or eliminate the sugar it's on you!  It doesn't make me hate it, and it does lend to the salsa itself, so I'll try quartering it next time.  I used dehydrated onions since I didn't have any onions in the house at the time.  I doubled the recipe and still only ended up with 1 full pint jar and about 3/4 of a pint jar.  I decided to can this and although it was a lot of boiling for 1 3/4 jars, I'm glad I did so we can have some of this salsa another time.  I did a water bath for 15 minutes and the jars sealed perfectly.  In my opinion, the work for this recipe (peeling the tomatoes by boiling in water--the skins come right off!), then chopping all the tomatoes and boiling everything for hours is worth it.  Next time I'm just going to make a heck of a lot more of this!  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been looking forever for a salsa that suits my taste and this is the one!  I don't like a lot of heat so I didn't add any hot pepper sauce.  I love the fresh, sweet taste of this and I can't wait to make it when the tomatoes in my garden ripen in another month or so!

I submitted this recipe and wanted to note that sometimes I use canned jalapeno peppers instead of green chilies for zestier salsa.

I think this salsa is fantastically delicious, yet different.  My children hate tom, peppers, and, onions, but they ate this down till the bowl was empty.  If you really enjoy it, don't even waste your time taking skins off, just throw it all in a bledder and hit puree, put some tomatoes aside to hand cut into larger chunks if you like some texture. I have made it both ways, skins and no skins, it tastes great regardless!

My search for a homemade salsa is finally over! I have recently started cooking more, and my very first attempt at this salsa was fabulous! I read the comments before hand, and knew I didn't want any sugar in mine, so I omitted it completely. Instead of chiles I used canned jalapenos which made it very warm, but not unbearable. I put in exact amounts of the seasonings, but then added more garlic and herbs until the taste was perfect for me. My husband and coworkers LOVED it! I made it for the 2nd time yesterday, and used 4 small fresh jalapeno peppers, 1 green pepper, and 2 banana peppers, instead of the chiles. It tastes wonderful! Not as hot as the first batch but so tastey. Thank you for the recipe!

This was awesome!  I cut the sugar in half, used canned tomatoes (it's winter in the midwest), 1 tablespoon of vinegar and only cooked it for 30 minutes.  Pulsed it with a soup blender.  I will definitely try it with fresh tomatoes this summer!

I think the outcome of this salsa can depend a lot on the type and size of the tomatoes used. Roma are the best for salsas, IMO. Mine were a tad on the small side, so I had to use about 10 of them to keep the salsa from tasting too vinegary. I only simmered mine for 2 hrs. and yummy!! I do puree the final product to hide the chopped onions from my kids, and only use 2 oz. of the diced chiles. Is good!

Omitted the sugar as everyone else suggested.  Did not peel tomatoes, and they made the salsa heartier.  Added cilantro.  Ended up only cooking it for 1 hour and 7 minutes over medium low temp as the liquid evaporated.

This  was a great way to use up my tomatoes... Just a little on the sweet side, but that is the name of the recipe!

Very good. I used store bought Romas and if you like cilantro, I do, add it after the salsa cools. It's better added after cooking IMO.

Great recipe - a helpful tip for freezing fresh tomatoes. Just put them whole in plastic bags and freeze. To peel, put desired number of tomatoes in hot water for a few seconds. You can then just rub off the peel.

Not too bad!!  I make one similar except no vinegar, no coriander and I add a chopped mango to mine.  I use mild chilies, regular sugar (start with 1 Tbsp & add more if needed) and also add some cilantro.  I cook mine in the crock pot on low 6-8 hours, stirring every hour.  I then can it in pint mason jars.  Very yummy!!  I make about 1 1/2 times this much in my 6 qt. crock.

We LOVED this.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!  I didn't have a can of peppers, so I chopped up a yellow sweet pepper and put that in with the rest of it.  Hands down, best salsa EVER!!  Thank you!

Too sweet but at the same time way too much vinegar.  I wasted garden tomatoes on this one.  I added chipotle and a little adobo sauce for some smokiness but that couldn't save it either.

Recipe as is, is delicious!!! 
To try something new I added 2 fresh jalapeños to the recipe and cut sugar to 1 tsp. I roasted both the jalapeños and the tomatoes.
