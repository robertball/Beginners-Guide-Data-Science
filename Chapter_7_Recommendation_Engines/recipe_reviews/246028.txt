I made this with homemade submarine size baguettes.  I split a pork tenderloin lengthwise and marinated overnight with char siu marinade from the Asian store.  While I was prepping the rest of the ingredients, I cooked the pork at 375F for 20 minutes and let cool before slicing thinly.  I did not have sriracha so I used Sunchang Gochujang Hot Pepper Paste and a bit of cayenne pepper to add a bit more spice to the mayo.  I did not have rice vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  I did not have pate so I didn't use it.  My family and I loved it.

We didn't use the pate, but that's the only change. We also used the Chef John Pan Roasted Pork recipe to prepare the meat. Both the pork and the sandwich were so good. We'll use the pork recipe again for other things too, not just this sandwich. Total dinner win and we will definitely make again.

Pretty good Banh Mi ..  We don't eat pork so I used roasted lamb and skipped the pate. I spread the sauce on the rolls and toasted them, prep the veggies and sliced the lamb and had each family member assemble their own sandwich.  The sandwiches had good flavor but were little bit dry, unlike the Vietnamese sandwiches we get usually.  Maybe I didn't put enough sauce or I drained the pickled veggies too much ?

I love banh mi and this one is good. the pickled vegetables are a bit weak, next time I'll make a pickling brine instead of using the seasoned rice vinegar. absolutely loved the aoli.

Delicious! I used leftover pork chop and omitted the radish. Also cut back on mayonnaise to save calories.

I followed this recipe as close as possible.   First time I did not have pate so that was the only thing left out.  Second time, still no pate but I used some onions and Jicama in  the marinaded salad. Yum. I will commit that form of the recipe to memory. Great either way however.  Can't wait to try it with pate too.

Excellent! I love banh mi and now I know how to make them. I followed the recipe exactly, even using Chef John's "Pan-Roasted 5 Spice Pork Loin" recipe to get the full effect. Thanks Chef John!

Just for grins and to lower the carbs from the bread, I'm trying it next made with low carb tortillas.

Omg! This was amazing! We doubled the recipe and made our own Chinese 5 spice but substituted the anise for ground ginger. Pork was marinated perfectly! I also made chef Johns sandwich rolls from scratch. Would highly recommend if you have the time. If not a regular French roll would work. Donâ€™t forget to

This was very good. I kind of felt like there was a tiny bit too much of the mayo mixture, but other than that, very interesting flavors. I also used Chef Johns pan roasted 5 spice pork for the sandwiches, and it went pretty well together. Thanks!

Made Chef John pan roasted 5 spice pork for the sandwiches.  Will make again and again.  So tasty.  I did add more Sriracha as we like things spicy.
