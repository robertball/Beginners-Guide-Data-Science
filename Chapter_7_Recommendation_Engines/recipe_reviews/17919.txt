I love sausage gravy and this recipe was a big hit at our house.  I didn't add the extra margarine figuring there was plenty from the sausage.  I also used Sage sausage giving a little more flavor.  I tried once with Maple sausage and didn't like the taste.  Other than decreasing the fat I didn't really change anything. 
This is super easy.  I did cut the recipe in half though since I was only cooking for 2.  I had plenty and there was nothing left over.

My fiance's family is originally from Mississippi, and they know how to make biscuits and gravy. So when I tried this recipe out, I wanted to make sure it would measure up. IT DID. He loves it!

YUMMY!!  My husband asked if we could have this for breakfast every morning.  I said no of course but we had enough for leftovers the following morning and it reheated very well.  I will definately make this again.

My oh My... Country biscuits and gravy! My favorite alternative breakfast. I only used 1/2 pound of sausage,left everything else the same, then fixed some fried 'taters with onions. I left the breakfast table fuller than a hound dog at a red neck BBQ!

FANTASTIC!  I was born, raised, and still live in MS, and I know what a good sausage gravy tastes like.  THIS IS IT!  Changes I made:  bacon grease instead of margarine, only 3 cups of milk, and a little more than the required flour as mine didn't seem pasty with the amount as stated.  The gravy thickened up very well - we like ours thick!  Overall, the meal was very filling and probably very fattening, but it was great for a once in a while dinner or breakfast.

Excellent. As good as any sausage gravy I've ever had. I didn't quite use four cups of milk, but the outcome of this recipe was wonderful.

Very yummie. I'm from Tenn. so sausage and gravy are popular when i visit. This was my first attempt to make it with this recipe and it was wonderful. I used sausage patties then cut them up as my daughter doesn't care for meat much so those who wanted it could have it and those who didn't didn't.  And I agree with the review it does reheat very well.

This was my first attempt every at sausage gravy and I've really only made gravy a few times before this.  EASY though and delish!  My husband said we will NEVER buy sausage gravy in a can again and I totally agree.  The second time we made it we used hot sausage and made it over biscuits with omelets for breakfast - too die for!  Thanks for sharing!

So simple and delicious!  I did use butter instead of margarine, and added some fresh minced garlic.  Just mixed it all together and didn't bother to remove the sausage while making the roux.  Perhaps next time I will add a bit of cayenne to spice it up more, but quite a good recipe as is.

This is a good recipe but it is much better and creamier if you used Evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I have made southern sausage and bacon gravy my entire life and have never added butter to it.  The sausage grease gives you enough liquid for your flour.  Cook the flour for at least 3 minutes to get a little color to it and get rid of the flour taste and then add the milk, salt and pepper.

A little more flour and a little less milk made it thicker for my taste. So good, and only having one pan to clean up made it even better!

First time making Sausage gravy. Followed the recipe exactly and the gravy was a little thin for my taste so I added a little more flour to thicken. Turned out perfectly

Wow!! So good and so easy. I still need to go buy my biscuits, hope I don't eat up all the gravy first. I used ground turkey and put Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning on the meat while browning it.

Followed the recipe exactly using turkey sausage, lite margarine, and skim milk...Just trying to make it a 'tad bit' more healthy. Ended up fabulous! This is the only way that I will prepare sausage gravy from now on. Thanks Bonnie!

This is a simple, delicious recipe. I have a few suggestions. #1, for God's sake use butter. Where did the margarine ingredient come from (like sausage gravy is even remotely healthy). #2, When it comes time to make the roux (adding the flour to the fat) I suggest moving all the sausage to the side of the pan so that the roux can be cooked a bit before mixing with the sausage and adding the milk. This reduces the amount of cooking time required to cook out the starchy taste of the flour. I also added some diced onion (just a couple of table spoons...don't get carried away). It adds a significant level of richness to the finished product, particularly if you use Vidalia onion. It is optimal to "sweat" the onion for awhile before adding the sausage, because it should be sautéd  until translucent before adding any liquiid to release all the flavor. Oh...and using some (or all) spicy sausage gives the gravy a nice bite. Or, in lieu of that add just a dash of cayenne or red pepper flakes to the sausage (before adding the milk...remember that any spice w/ carotenoids requires fat to release the flavor), even if you don't want the gravy to be hot. By adding an imperceptible interest on the back of the palate it will make even the boring-est gringos you feed wondering why your gravy was so dang good. Now, go promote a heart attack with this gravy. LOL

Very easy and exactly the comfort food I was looking for! Added scallions for color and only used 3 cups of milk after reading the other reviews. 4 cups would have made pretty runny gravy!

This was ok.  Not bad in principal but very bland.  We used spicy sausage and it was not enough to give enough flavor for our taste.  I haven't figured out yet, what it is missing, but it definitely needs something...

As easy as sausage gravy gets!  I use slightly less pork, as for my own tastes, but it was delish!  I also find it helpful to use a whisk when making gravy, as it gets the lumps out quicker.

I thought it could use a bit more flavor.  Garlic and onions next time, for sure.  I would use this recipe as a good base.

Best comfort food ever! I used bacon grease instead of margarine. Took too long to thicken so I ended up adding a bit of cornstarch slurry...next time maybe a hair more flour and a hair less milk. Added some ground sage during the salt and pepper part of the process. And couldn't help myself...added a medium onion at the very beginning! Can't wait for leftovers before work tomorrow morning!

Very great homemade version. I served it with homemade soda drop biscuits and my family couldn't have enough! I cut the recipe in half and used butter instead of margerine. Will make again.

Someone gave me 5lbs of ground sausage that I had no idea what to do with.  This recipe has taken care of a great portion of it!  My roommates love it, and it's so simple.  I'd never made a gravy before, but it turned out perfect the first time.  Thank you!

I love this gravy.  It is so easy and so tasty.  I only use 3 cups of milk though,b/c my boys like the gravy a little thicker.  5 stars from me and 2 boys give it 4 thumbs up.

Great taste and very easy!  Good southern style meal :)

I do alter the recipe a bit - only about 1 TBSP butter, about 1/3 cup flour and 3 cups milk.

I was recently looking on here for country gravy recipes to try for country fried steak.  This is pretty much the same recipe I have used for years.  The only difference (and I think this makes a big difference) is I use white pepper.  I know that sounds picky but it tastes much better.

this was really good. I made it on the spot for my mashed potatoes...to make it a little thicker I cut back on the margarine and only used three cups of milk instead of three which made it thicker and better on the potatoes. My husband LOVED it too :)

very tasty! defiantly something ill make again and again! i did not add the margarine since there was a little bit of grease from the sausage. i used sage sausage and it was amazing! i think next time ill make the gravy and add the sausage. i didnt follow the directions to the recipe and it didnt come out as thick as i would have hoped. even my boyfriend said it could have been a little bit thicker.

This was the first time I made sausage gravy. I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 tablespoon of bacon grease instead of the margarine. It seemed like it had to cook for a long time. It was very runny so I added cornstarch. Make sure to add lots of pepper. I should have read some of the reviews first. Tasted good when finished.

Solid recipe! I'm never going back to the packets of sausage gravy ever again...lol! I doubled the meat, one spicy & one mild, used butter not margarine, doubled flour, milk about the same, and added salt and pepper. I was thinking about omitting the butter, but it is an important part of the flavoring, and let's face it, it's not a "healthy " dish anyway, but it sure is yummy!

This is a great recipe and so easy. I had to drain some of the grease due to my sausage brand made a lot but I added the margarine and a little more than the 1/4 cup flour, I cook it for a few minutes and then added 3 cups milks and brought it to a slight boil, stirring constantly and then lowered my heat. It thickened perfectly. It was outstanding!! Thank you for this recipe, it will be one I use from now on...

The first time I had true, homemade southern biscuits and gravy was when my husband's Granny made it for us - before I found out I had Celiac. I just made this for my husband and I, and it's the best biscuits and gravy either of us have had.... and that's sayin' something bc my husband LOVES his granny's recipe. The texture, thickness, and flavors were spot on.  We used Jimmy Dean's "all natural" sausage (only one I could find without MSG - something we're both allergic to), and Gillian's Wheat Free, Dairy Free french rolls. 
Added two more tablespoons of margarine because the meat was very, very lean, but it turned out perfectly.
Recommend this to any and all!!!

I made this using 1% milk. I like a thicker gravy, so I used only 3 cups and 3 tbsp of corn starch with water.  It was very thick like this.  And good!

Thank you Bonnie! My search for the perfect sausage gravy is over. I used butter instead of margarine I read somewhere that a reviewer used evaporated milk and water. I decided to try that and it took me back, this was the taste I searched countless recipes for!! Thanks again:-)

Absolutely Delicious!!! I only used 3 1/2 cups water and also added some thyme (about 1/4 teaspoon) My family loved it especially my 5 year old daughter who had thirds! Can't wait to make this again.

very good, my wife said restaurant quality!  one thing my gravy turned yellow? instead of white, the only thing I changed was using real butter, so maybe thats what happened.  still tasted great. I made homemade biscuits from this site also, yum better than store bought biscuits. Homemade Biscuit Mix by DAVES_POOKY    thanks for the recipe.

I had never made sausage gravy before I found this recipe.  It was way easier than I thought it would be.  I usually half the recipe for just my husband and myself.

Have been making this for years.  I usually make it the night before so the sausage flavor can mesh with the gravy.  Just pop in the microwave and pour over biscuits. (after reheating, check the thickness- you may need to add a tbs or two of water.)

So easy.  I used a sage flavored sausage as another veiwer had recommended and it was great for biscuits and gravy.  Next time I may add a bit more flour so the gravy is thicker.

Very good! My boyfriend talked about it all day long! The only thing was that with 4 cups of milk it was a little bit too runny for us, so I had to add more flour. Plus added some seasoning to the sausage while it was cooking. Other than that it was great!

This recipe is good.  But if your not squemish about butter or fat, here is the proper way to make sausage gravy.  Brown Sausage, remove from pant.  In hot pan put 1/2 stick butter, flour make into muhy paste add milk till thicked enough and serve over busicuts. Ralph Vendegna

Good recipe but I do it without extra fat (margarine or butter). Just brown the sausage and dump between 1/4 and 1/3 C of flour over it. Stir for a few minutes to cook the flour so it doesn't taste raw and then just add milk a little at a time till it seems think enough for me. Also to add flavor I add a bit of sage and pepper.

This is DELISH!!! I made it for 6 servings instead of 4. All I did was 1 1/2 pound Sausage, 5 Cups of Milk, 1/4 Cup & 2 Tablespoons of Flour..Also, I used Bacon Drip instead of butter. Salt and Pepper to taste. It made plently!! I have never made homemade sausage gravy before and I can say this is a Great recipe.. Easy!!!!!!

This was really good.  It could have been a bit thicker, that was the only complaint from my family, so next time I will add a bit more flour, to get it thicker!  But it was good!

This was delious and a family favorite. Depending on how your family eats this will only feed 2-3 people so you might want to double this if you have good eaters. I would and have recommended this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!!

This sausage gravy recipe, is delicious. I used 2 cups of milk instead of 4 and I was very pleased. Also the better the sausage the better the gravy, I went with basil sausage made fresh daily at a neighborhood market.

This recipe was fantastic!  I used 1½ cups of ½ & ½ and 2 ½ cups of milk and it thickened up really well.  I also used some savory herbs to spice it up.  It was restaurant quality!

EXCELLENT! The only thing this recipe really needs is liberal amounts of salt and pepper... those two spices can really make or break your gravy. Taste is frequently, and season to your likening. Will use this recipe frequently!

Very Very Good!  Better than Hardee's gravy! Used with J.P.'s Big Daddy biscuits from this site. I also used 3 cups milk, but it does thicken as it stands, so I wouldn't decrease below 3 cups.  Thanks for the fantastic and EASY recipe!

Simple and very yummy.  Only used 3 cups warm milk to get the consistency we prefer.  My sausage was pretty lean so I added a little more butter.

I just made this for brunch. It was amazing! Totally loved it! The only thing I changed was a little less milk and tad more flour. I like thick gravy. Can't wait for my father to try it.

Very good! I was starting to get worried that I did something wrong when it was taking a while to thicken up and I didn't use all 4 cups of milk. But it did start to thicken up and I ended up using 3 cups of milk. I added some garlic and onion powder for our taste. It was very good and easy! Thank you!

I needed a bit more flour to thicken it the way we like.  Added 1/2 tsp seasoned salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper...did not add the margarine. Yum

Very easy and tasty! Left out the margarine since we had plenty of grease with the sausage. Added onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Will be making again.  Thank you for this quick and easy comfort food :D

Very simple and very tasty.  Few words of advice though, so you guys don't have to wonder if this happens to you.  Four cups of milk?  Way too much.  It felt like the stirring would never end.  Three cups does the trick nicely, as other suggested.  Also, we made this with lowfat milk one time for a healthier meal but after it taking forever again, we gathered its not only the flour that makes this thick, but also the fat in the milk.  The lowfat version came out slightly runny even after a long time of cooking.  Whole milk apparently is the only way to go.  It was nice and thick in no time.  Also, we tend to use butter instead of margarine as it seems to flavor food better.  Hope this helps!

This is a good starting point, but the recipe as written is really thin and bland.  I had to add a couple more tablespoons of flour to get it almost thck enough after 15 minutes, and it desperately needed salt and pepper.  But it's easy to remember as the base recipe, so I'm sure it'll get used more!

Very easy and yummy. The only thing I do different is that i take the sausage out ofter it is browned, make the gravy and then add the sausage back in. I find it easy to keep it smooth this way.

Turkey (country) sausage and reduced fat milk will work in this recipe with good results, if you keep the butter or margarine. Classic flavor, either way.

My wife and I loved this! This was by far the simplest and tastiest gravy ever. I use Jimmy Dean's sage flavored sausage most of the time and it was great in this recipe. I also load up the black pepper (coarse ground) as we are both big fans. Another thing, this gravy warms up great in the microwave but biscuits don't fare as well, so I usually make fresh hot toast to go with leftovers.

Fantastic! This is VERY easy and turns out great. I double the recipe for big family brunch gatherings (15-20 guests). I make it one batch at a time in a pan on the stove and when it's at the thickness I like, I pour it into the crockpot on the WARM setting. Then make the second batch and add it to the crockpot.

Since I've moved so far away from home I wanted to attempt to duplicate my mom's sausage gravy.  This comes pretty close.  She uses a greater quantity of sausage in her recipe, but it's probably for the best that I used exactly what the recipe says - it was so good I'd probably make it over and over and get sick of it.  

Also, don't make the same mistake I made, and store the tube of biscuits in the freezer.  Oops.  :D

This is how I make our sausage gravy. I do not add any butter or margarine. Even if there is no grease in the pan at all - and there won't be if you use a really good quality sausage, I use Oldham's - there is no need for additional fat. It will be very thick and crumbly, but that's fine. And I don't measure the milk or flour, I've made it so many times for my husband, I just eyeball it. He thinks this is perfect.

A good sausage gravy recipe. I tried to make as posted but made minor changes. I prefer using real butter instead of margarine for most everything, but of course you'll probably live longer than me if you don't. Ha Ha! And I like using Wondra flower for gravy's (it's a finely sifted flour to help blend gravies with less lumps.) That's all I did different. It was great! Thanks!

Very yummy, my family loved it!  I was a bit hesitant about the butter first, but it turned out great.  This is a foolproof recipe for those who have had trouble getting the right consistency in their gravy.  I will be making this again!

Yum!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I made it with low fat turkey sausage and forgot the margarine and it still came out great!

OMG YUMMY! I've been craving this for awhile and it totally hit the spot!! This pregnant woman thanks you! I used only 3 cups of milk and liberally salted and peppered it, and also I used ground "breakfast sausage" (beef) instead of the ground pork. I ate until I was full and then ate some more.

This was just average for me.  It was good, but I had to add a lot more flour to thicken it up.  My husband thought it was wonderful though.  I rate it 3 stars and my husband rates it 5, so I'll give it a 4.

This was ok, not as good as I was expecting.  I used spicy ground pork sausage and maybe that threw the flavor off a little?  Sorry.

This is OK but I favor Bacon gravy much more, make it with bacon drippings and you can crumble up bacon in it if you like.

5 stars! I found this recipe didn't need to altered at all. I followed as written. I let it simmer for a while and it thickened up perfectly! Be sure to add pepper.

This was awesome.  I followed the advice here and added cornstarch, a tsp mixed into the 4th cup of milk.  I used Farmland Pork and bacon sausage and also spiced it up a bit by adding a drop of da bomb hot sauce near the end.  It covered 20 biscuits and everyone loved it!

Definitely not one for the calorie counters but this is a tasty and filling breakfast - and very simple to make! I used 4 cups of milk and found that it thickens nicely when you reduce heat and simmer. Very good!

Great recipe! I used meatless sausage, browned in canola oil and then followed the recipe (using 3 cups of milk and butter instead of margarine.) It worked great.

Very good recipe, and easy to make!  I made it the first time I ever made gravy, and it turned out fine.  I sort of had to play with the recipe a little bit to get the right texture.

This is ok but the gravy has no flavor.  One should use bacon grease for gravy instead of margarine.

Made this as per the recipe, and it turned out just the way I love my sausage gravy.  And so easy to make. I lived in the South, (Charleston, SC), for eight years, and had occasion to try innumerable variations of this gravy, but the basic one here is still my favorite. Now, if I could just master the art of great biscuit baking...

This recipe is the bomb. Its easy and the flavor and texture is perfect. You can change it up using different flavors of sausage ( hot-sage-maple).  My pop is 89 and from Kentucky, he said it took him back to the days of his mothers cooking.

Tasted amazing! However, a bit thin when all said and done. Next time, I will either use more flour or reduce the milk.

This was really good; my family loved it!  Be sure to slowly add the milk or it won't thicken as well.  I used 4 cups of milk but 
3 1/2 would have been better.  Definitely will make again.

We loved it! Substituted one can of evaporated milk and used the rest as whole milk, did not add butter because the sausage grease was plenty. 5 stars with these slight changes...

Several complain about the gravy being too thin. Maybe a better instruction in step two would be: Reduce heat to medium low and slowly add the milk. COOK, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick and bubbly and to desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
The longer you cook gravy, the thicker it gets.

This is a good standard gravy recipe. I did make some adjustments   I only used 1/2 spicy pork  sausage and 3 cups of milk.  I found that 3 cups of milk was quiet a bit so I added a little cornstarch for thickening towards the end.

This was fantastic! It reminded me of the chow hall at Ft Lee, Va when I was in school with the Marines. I used only 2 cups of milk to make it thick just like it had been sitting on the steam table for awhile just like I remember it. Brings back memories!

Delicious sausage gravy! I needed only about 3 1/2 cups of milk and after tasting I added a touch of granulated garlic (1/4-1/2 tsp).

It is a great basic recipe. However I did used salted butter instead of margarine. And I thought the sausage would have enough salt content to not have to add any. But actually I had to had quite a bit and pepper.

Excellent!  
For the pork sausage, I used sweet Italian pork sausage for the perfect blend of spices.  
I used butter instead of margarine.
I also substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for one of the cups of milk and  added a pinch of extra flour. 
The heavy cream adds just the right bit of richness. 
Yummmmmm!

Good starting point for basic sausage gravy.  Thank you for sharing!  We like it a bit thicker and just reduced the milk to 3 cups.  We also added some salt, pepper, garlic & red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit (only had mild sausage on hand).

I omitted the butter and added corn starch to thicken it up since I had a little bit of whole milk and had to add skim milk to it. Instead of using regular table salt, I used pink himalayan salt.

There was not enough pepper. It was to thick it needs way more than 4 cups of milk.

Simple tasty recipe. The only thing I changed was added an extra tablespoon on flour to thicken a little more.

I replaced the margarine with butter and added a dash of cayenne pepper. I've never made anything like this before, but it was so easy & delicious, it made me look like a pro!

I usually add some seasoning- garlic powder and onion powder, sometimes some fresh sage if I have it.  I change up the type of sausage now and then and haven't found one I didn't like.  It's a great recipe.

Really good but you need a bit more seasoning than salt and pepper... also... used butter... and maple sausage is pretty good in it... at least we think so!... I add lots of poultry seasoning to to tame the sweetness (when we use the maple sausage) down a bit... it was really tasty and we make it a lot!  Don't forget to TASTE it as you go... season it to your taste and you will love this recipe!

I made this recipe last weekend for my family and my fiance LOVED it. He would consider himself a biscuits and gravy oficionado and he said it was better than any he'd ever had. I had originally planned to leave out the margarine, as suggested by another reviewer, but in the end chose to add it. Best. Decision. Ever. The margarine adds a depth to the gravy that we wouldn't have had otherwise and is ultimately what sold my fiance on it as the Best Biscuits and Gravy in history. Quick and easy to make, I threw a package of Pilsbury butter biscuits in the oven while cooking the gravy and called it done! One note, though - while it calls for 4 cups of milk, I would add them 1 cup at a time until you get the consistency that you want. We added the whole 4 cups and then had to add about another 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it up. I did use Lactaid instead of regular milk, because our son is lactose intolerant.

I used reduced fat sausage and 1/2 cup of flour instead of 1/4 cup. I like it thick and the original picture it looked thin but it was the picture that made me choose this recipe because I only like really white gravey. Also my biscuits were a recipe from this site. Big Daddy JPs biscuits! They are the best?

Excellent recipe. Had some heavy cream left over, so used 2 cups heavy cream and 2 cups milk, perfect consistency. My picky husband accused me of having bought the Bob Evans version from the grocery store and telling him that it was home made. Will definitely make this again.

I don't eat biscuits and gravy but my brother does. Said he wasn't use to all the meat but it didn't disturb him any. Had more the next day. I'm a fan because it was easy and pleased my brother. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Love this! So easy. It does take a little longer to thicken, but that may be due to the low-fat milk. Someday maybe I'll try increasing flour or decreasing milk to see if that makes a difference.

Drain sausage fat adequately. Add cayenne pepper to spice it up a notch. Add more salt than the recipe calls for.

Excellent and easy to make.  I did "resize" it for 2 people but still made a few modifications.  I used 3 TBSP flour instead of 2 to make the gravy thicker and I only used 1 1/2 cups of milk because 2 would have made it too watery.  These modifications might have been necessary because I used skim milk. I also used turkey sausage because that's what I had on hand, it was as good as pork sausage.

I've been making sausage gravy like this for 30 years!  Instead of the margarine I use leftover  bacon grease.  Otherwise, follow this recipe.  No need to remove the sausage and then make the gravy and add it back in, just make it all at one time like this recipe directs.   Add the milk slowly so that you don't add too much, just use the 4 cups as a guide. You can't go wrong.

This is an excelllent recipe.  My only suggestion is to cut the milk to 2 Cups which will make a  thick gravey.  I used a 1/4 teaspn of pepper.  And, I used Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.

I've made Sausage Gravy like this for years. Cant go wrong with this. But for a slightly different taste try adding aprox 2 teaspoons of Worchestershire sauce or more to taste, I use Lea & Perrins, and usually bit more. You might like the unique flavor it gives this hearty meal.

This was a nice change from our usual canned gravy.  Next time though I will only add 1/2 pd sausage and the full 4 cups whole milk instead of 3.  It was way more sausage than the standard recipe.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing except added a lot of cracked pepper and some salt for flavor.   Served some Southern Hashbrowns on the side and my family loved it!

We keep sausage and bacon grease from previous recipes in the fridge to cook with vegetables so I used 2 T. of that instead of margarine and it was great!

My dad made this same recipe when I was a little girl. It's so simple and soooo good! When we were feeling particularly like treating ourselves, we'd use bacon drippings instead of margarine. And you can flavor the gravy to your liking simply by the type of sausage you buy (plain, spicy, maple, etc).

I have made this a few times now.  The first time I liked the taste but it was a bit thin for our preferences.  I make it now using whole milk and upped the flour slightly from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup to make it the perfect consistency.

My husband, the only person who will eat this in our house, enjoyed this dish.  It was a little thin when I followed the recipe at stated, so I had to add a little more flour.  In the past, I've added leftover chopped smoked sausage; adds a nice flavor. I'll make this again.

Just gave it four stars because of the fat/calorie content.  There is no need for the extra fat in the margarine and also when I make it I drain the excess fat out of the pan after cooking the sausage, there is still enough to make the roux with the flour.  Someone commented that you can't reheat it with the bisquits in the microwave, they get tough.  Very true, but just nuke the bisquits separately for a shorter period of time.    We never have fresh milk on hand so I use powdered skim milk and it works great and again, fewer calories.

I also enjoyed the flavor of this and also added more flour to make it thicker.  I actually didn't use any sausage (because we didn't have any) and found it to be tasty as a white gravy (with some extra butter for flavoring).  Very nice.

Good recipe. I wouldn't recommend adding any salt, though, the sausage itself was salty enough, and if you use biscuits from a canister, they too, have more than enough salt.

I can't make gravy...at all, but this recipe is so easy and tasty. We have this for breakfast 2-3 times a month and it always turns out great. Only thing I do differently is cutting the milk down to 3 c. instead of 4 otherwise it isn't as thick as we like. Thanks Bonnie for this wonderfully easy recipe.

This was great!  I believe I used less fat than the recipe called for (didn't measure) and I had to add more flour to thicken to a consistency that we prefer.  I only used three cups of milk, but did use one pound of Jimmy Dean all-natural sausage!  It was delicious with biscuits and eggs for dinner.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted DELICIOUS! My whole family loved it. We gobbled it up. I only changed a couple small things - I DID NOT add the extra butter - it had plenty of sausage grease. I did add LOTS of pepper and added a few other spices. A little thyme and a little garlic powder. Just kept adding until the flavor seemed right. I can't say enough good things about this recipe! YUM!!!

I thought it tasted kinda bland. I should have used a seasoned pork sausage maybe that would have added more flavor. It was very simple though.

Very good recipe. I only added 3 cups of milk, and LOTS of pepper.

I used it on biscuits and gravy, and made them southern style with a sunny side up egg on top of the biscuit and under the gravy.

This came out great!  Very simple to make.  I used turkey breakfast sausage.  I also used about a cup of heavy cream that I had on hand from baking, along with three cups of skim milk - they balance each other out, right? =)  After browning the sausage I added the butter and flour, no problems with clumping.  Added the milk and kept it at a simmer for quite some time and let it get nice and thick.  I used a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Sooo good!

Husband loved it and I thought it was delicious. Didn't feel the need to add any butter, plenty of fat from the pork. Will definitely make it again soon!

finally got a good gravy recipe, after trying many on the internet, i was skeptical when i read only 1/4 cup of flour (because all other recipes say 3 or 4 cups). I thought maybe i wasn't handling the flour right, but it musta been that the other recipes called for too much flour. The only change was that i only used 2 cups of milk. but i might use about 2.5 cups next time.

My mom has been making this recipe since I was a baby, and now I make it for my babies. Who by the way, can't get enough. Easy to make and great taste. Especially if you use a maple flavored sausage. Either way wonderful.

This was super yummy, but took forever to thicken. It was also watery the next day. Hubby actually suggested using half n half next time. I'll try that next time.

DONT ADD THE MARGARINE. IT DOESNT NEED IT! when i added the flour i had a major clumping problem but then started to use a whisk and it helped a great deal. i strongly suggest using a whisk unless you want big chunks of raw flour in your gravy!served w/ JP's big daddy biscuits from this site that i made the night before to make for an easy throw together breakfast.

While this recipe was fast and simple, it wasn't very tasty and hard to thicken.  I doubled the amount of flour and halved the milk and it was still a little runny.

I make this with biscuits and my family is so happy!  I have to admit that I use ground beef and only 1 cup milk vs 4.  It has been a great quick meal in my home.

This is so easy to make. I found that it also depends on the brand of sausage used. I prefer Jimmy Deans original. It had a lot more flavor than any of the other brands I have tried.  My boyfriend requests this almost every weekend now and invites over friends and family to try "my" sausage gravy!!!  I like to double the recipe and stick it in the fridge or freezer.

Simple and delicious!  I love a dish that comes together all in one pan but is just as tasty as something with a dozen ingredients and an hour's worth of chopping. It's great to be able to make mom's favorite when she comes without fussing in the kitchen forever.

Yum! This was my first time ever making biscuits and gravy and this recipe was super easy! It took about 10 minutes of stirring for it to get thick enough and people aren't kidding when they say to use a lot of salt and pepper! I thought I added a lot but it wasn't enough. I used fresh ground sausage from the local butcher this time and I'm going to try a spicier one next time for more flavor.

My whole family enjoyed this sausage gravy. I used cornstarch instead of flour and  I only used three cups of milk thought it would be way to runny with 4.  Next time I will use shortening instead of butter to keep the gravy a nice white color.

I didnt get much flavor out of this. I used italian style pork sausage. Thinking it would give it flavor but that was about all the flavor it had. Next time I will add a whole lot more black pepper to it while it simmers. I also only added 2 cups of milk, I think that was a mistake. I will add at least 3 next time as it didnt make enough gravy to go around. (my fault)! I will try this again though!!

I used venison sausage because I had it on hand and it turned out great!  It had a very good texture.

Quite good, but I agree with the other advice - scale down the milk or add starch. I reduced the recipie for 1 person (can you believe I'm the only one in my house who likes biscuits and gravy?!?) & added a smidge of starch. It made a great breakfast!!

I also only used about 3 cups of milk.  It was excellent!

Love this recipe...especially when I am in a hurry. As a mom of 3 that seems like always. I cut back the milk to 3 cups...or else I had to add cornstarch/water mix. This is a Sunday morning meal at our house. Thanks Bonnie!

Eight thumbs up - This meal was gobbled up by my boys. I used only 2cups of milk though and served with mashed potatoes and toast. YUM!

I love this sausage gravy recipe.  It is the only version I make.  I do typically add more flour and water as a paste to help it thicken more quickly as it cooks though.

First time making sausage gravy, and I'm so excited to find this recipe!  I used Webber "Bold & Spicy" (?) sausage, and it was definitely spicy.  Per other reviews, I tried reducing the milk to 1 1/2 cups, which was really good.  But the gravy does thicken the longer it cooks & then sits, so 2 cups would be OK too.  All in all, a fantastic taste and very easy to make.

This recipe was good, but I only added half of the milk. It was thick but not too thick and it went great over buscuits!

This was quick and easy to make.  Even the kids who don't usually like sausage gravy ate it with no complaints!
