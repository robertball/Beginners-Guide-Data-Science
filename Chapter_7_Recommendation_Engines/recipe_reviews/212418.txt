We
loved these potatoes and I guess this dish will be a staple in my
family. I didn't use chana dal and used only 2 green chilies. Delicious and easy to make, thanks.

I followed this recipe to the letter and I found it excellent! The potatoes are bursting with flavor. This is like a spicy potato salad without the mayonnaise. I had no problems finding the ingredients at the local Indian food grocer

I cannot get enough of this dish!!! This is the second time I've made it in the past two weeks, and I've yet to tire of it. The flavors come together perfectly. For those who were unsure of the cooking, yes you should boil the dahl first. I put quite a bit more dahl than the recipe called for, so I doubled the spices to compensate. I've also made it with mung beans instead and it still works beautifully. I make a big batch and eat it with paratha, roll it up like a burrito in some naan or tortillas, or I use it as the filling for my samosas. Hope this helps!

Packed with many great flavors, they come together to make a terrific dish. I followed the recipe precisely, except that I used 2 Tbl. urad dal only - with its black skin on - instead of the 2 dals. I served this with palaak panir, shahi panir, basmati rice, a dal dish, raita (cucumber & yogurt) for a vegetarian feast. (In case you don't know about it, here's an important ingredient note: do not use curry powder instead of curry leaves! The powder is a mix of several different spices. The curry leaves are from a tree & are green. They have a unique  aroma & flavor - unsubstitutable, so beg your Indian grocer to order it for you.)

We loved this recipe, although felt like we were missing a step? Are you supposed to boil the chana dal and urad dal before frying...? They turned out still raw, like I kind of expected. The flavor was awesome!! Could recommend what to eat it with? We had it with rice, but that didn't seem a good pairing?

The most traditional South Indian potato curry I would love the most. It comes with a package of flavors and the main ingredient that made me love this curry is the lemon juice which is added at the end that takes the recipe to another level. I won't use the ground pepper because its too spicy for me with that.

It was so delicious!! I attempted to use the beans uncooked, but halfway thorough the recipe, I realized that there is no way these would cook through. I didn't have green chile peppers, so I used jalapenos. I used WAY too many, so I added some soy milk to calm it down a little bit. It helped some and made the dish creamier. Still very good. I'll definitely make it again. I do not see myself cooking a bunch of beans just to use 1 tbs. & 1 tsp. in a recipe. It was fine without them. I could see adding a cup of beans, though.
