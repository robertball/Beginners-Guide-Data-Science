07-26-16 ~ YUM! I don't have a spiralizer with attachments, so I used my mandolin to slice the sweet potato. I loved the taste of these and the ease of making them. Mine took about 30 minutes of baking time before resting/cooling for 10 minutes. Great recipe that I will be using again! Thanks CCM for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper!

These are delicious!  I, too, had problems with a spiralizer, so I switched to a mandolin, with pretty good success.  The coins I liked the best were not "photogenic"--they were a bit too dull in color, but they were crispy, like chips!  I will definitely do this one, again!

I really enjoyed the taste of this. I had a problem, though - my potatoes were very mangled looking. I had never used the slicer part of my Paderno spiralizer.  I didn't even take a photo because the coins looked so bad.  That's not the recipe submitter's fault though. I just need to figure out how to use that particular insert. I might try this recipe again using my mandolin.

they kept drying out and not getting crispy. I bumped up the temp and time and it still did nothing. But they were still good.

Loved these!  I'm following the paleo diet, so I used melted coconut oil instead of spray and flipped them once through the cooking process.  You do have to watch them if they aren't all exactly the same thickness, otherwise some will burn, so I just removed them as they started to brown.  They turned out perfectly crispy!  I will be making these again and again!

These were excellent! They get nice and crispy after letting them sit. Thank you for the recipe.
