I had to make several changes after I got started.   I used two 15 oz cans of chickpeas.  I couldn't see having 1/2 cup left over (2 cups was 1-1/2 cans).  I ended up using 3 tablespoons sesame butter (asian style with a little heat), 1/3 cup olive oil and 1-1/2 large lemons (came to 7 tablespoons).  I sprinkled with a little cayenne for a little added kick and really upped the garlic just for my own taste.  I feel if I had made this as written, it would not have been smooth enough for my taste.  Made the way I made it, I would give it 5 stars, thought it was awesome.  I feel it needs more oil than the recipe stated, but it could just be personal preference in liking a less chunky hummus.

my husband is lebanese and only likes his mom's hummus.  i am always looking for something better :) and really enjoyed this.  i adjusted to one can worth of garbanzo beans, added a little extra lemon, no tahini (bleh) and a stalk of kale into my food processor for some extra nutrients (hiding for my kids!) and color.  i ended up adding about 4 TB of liquid from the canned garbanzo beans to get the right consistency.  i prefer this to added oil.  at the end, i tasted and added another TB of fresh lemon juice.

thanks for something different!

Great recipe!!! I just made a few changes.  I prefer using dried chick peas.  I think they have better flavor, texture and they are cheaper.  I soaked mine for 24 hours first and then I just boiled in a pan of with water until they were softened.  When I blended the ingredients, I made the following additions.  I added a little turmeric for color and taste.  I added some parsley.  I added a little black pepper.  I had a can of roasted red peppers from Wegmans, so I threw in slightly less more than half of one large roasted red pepper and I cut the garlic back just a little.  I got rave reviews!  This is now my favorite hummus recipe and I will never EVER buy from the store again!

P.S. If you like your hummus smooth, the roasted red pepper will help to smooth it out instead of adding of more olive oil...

Great basic recipe.  Add more or less garlic to taste.

I thought after I tasted it, that it needed some lemon zest to lighten up the garlic taste. After I tasted that minor change, I decided that it needed another pinch of salt. After, it tasted great!!!!!

I loved this recipe.  I'm a hummus lover to start with, but the extra lemon adds a lightness & freshness to the usual flavour.  Definitely a keeper.

I was not a fan of hummus before I tried this version and adjusted to my own taste. I'm nuts about garlic so I threw in about 7 or 8 cloves. I used my own recipe of prepared tahina to balance out the nuttiness (again, not a big fan of chickpeas), and followed through with the rest of the directions. I also drastically cut back on the olive oil (only used a few tbsps), which makes for a drier, less oily dip but it does not compromise on flavour. It might be the can of chickpeas I used, but I had an entire Ziploc left over after using only about 1/2 cup. You can add & mix a drizzle of olive oil and paprika to boost the consistency and flavour as you keep it in the fridge. I will definitely be keeping this one.

Delicious!  But don't miss the opportunity to really bring out the true lemon flavor.  Whenever I use lemon juice, I zest first.    The zest AND juice will brighten your dish and bring it to a higher  flavor level.

This turned out perfect.  I used 2cups homecooked garbanzo beans instead of canned.   Able to cook them to better degree of tenderness that way.   Finished with heavy sprinkle of za'atar then drizzle of good olive oil.   Mmmmmmmm

This is my favorite homemade Hummus recipe! I make at least 3 batches a month ?? It's delicious both as a dip, and as a spread (to bulk up sandwiches and roll-ups).

Great recipe! Easy and fast to make. I used four tablespoons of lemon juice and it worked out well. I wouldn't change anything else. I used my own home made tahini, as well.  I will definitely make this again!

I've tried several hummus recipes from this site and this is by far my favorite. Exactly enough garlic, not too much tahini, just enough salt-- perfect, it is. Oh, and I don't bother to measure lemon juice, but instead just use the juice of one decent-sized lemon.

I made this a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by the texture and taste. I honestly was at the grocery store earlier today and was going to pick up a store sold hummus and I put it down because decided to come home and remake this recipe as it is truly better then any store bought brand I have tasted. I was not disappointed ! Tks for sharing this easy and great tasting and texture recipe.

The only change I made was to skip the salt and added pepper. My favorite hummus recipe!
