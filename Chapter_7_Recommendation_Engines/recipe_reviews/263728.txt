Took way longer to cook than the 3 minutes stated in the recipe.  Also, the amount of batter was not enough to make two cakes.  I should have put it all in one mug.  Even though I baked it probably an extra minute to a minute and a half, it still came out more like a pudding consistency than a cake.  Taste-wise, it was good, though.
