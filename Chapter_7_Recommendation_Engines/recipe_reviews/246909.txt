My husband loved this! Peaches and blueberries are a great combo and mixing cobbler and muffins is a great idea. Due to allergies I did not use coconut oil or sugar. I used canola cooking oil and regular granulated sugar. I also upped the cinnamon in both the batter and peach mixture and doubled the vanilla in the batter mixture out of preference . I omitted the lemon juice and it was not missed or needed. I did need to bake this longer than 40 minutes but that could be due to using a square baking dish since the dish size was not specified.
