This is a great recipe and a big hit. A couple tips. First "sugar" and "pie" pumpkins are the same thing -- you just don't want a jack-o-lantern pumpkin. Second I used the Bob Evans sausage and cranberry stuffing from this site and it was delicious. (It might be even a little better to use 100% homemade stuffing but that's a big undertaking). I put the top back on the pumpkin before I put it in the oven and the stuffing pushed it up an inch or so as it swelled which made for a great presentation. I used a small pumpkin and cut it into slices to serve - it was a hit!

This is sooo good the presentation itself is an eye catcher and my guests never stopped talking about this speciality food. Beautiful and wonderful to behold and the flavor of the stuffing I used with the pumpkin was truly an experience.

I can hardly believe I'm the first one to write this! The sugar pumpkin I bought was almost impossible to cut! The outside was like concrete. I was afraid there was going to be a trip to the ER by the time I was able to cut into it. I put it in to the microwave for 5 minutes to help. It was really quite a task. It is in the oven now hope it was worth the trouble!

I like to stuff my cooked pumpkin with cooked chilli. You eat the chilli and cut a piece of pumpkin off as a side dish. We love it.

A show stopping way to serve stuffing. I used this to serve individual servings of stuffing on Thansgiving using gluten free stuffing in small pumpkins to avoid any contamination. It worked like a charm. I cooked it the night before refrigerated then reheated in the microwave the next day. It was a hit with everyone. I now have served this to my family on regular occasions. Everyone raves about it and the kids get some veggies in them from eating the pumpkin. In my latest attempt (in my picture) I used two very small Kuri pumpkins and had to take out some of the pulp to make room for all the stuffing. I chopped up the pulp and added it into the stuffing and the flavor was really wonderful. I used homemade gluten free stuffing from AR one time and then used homemade cornbread stuffing in another. The flavor of the pumpkin is just delicious and not overpowering. Thank you Karen for a lovely idea and a no fuss easy recipe idea!
