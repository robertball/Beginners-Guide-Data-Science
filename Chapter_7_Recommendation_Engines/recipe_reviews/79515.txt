A  healthy and fresh tasting salad that is very different from our usual salads.  I ended up making a little extra of the dressing, (I would recommend doubling it), but otherwise followed the recipe.  I will make this again.

This salad is so good.  I wasn't sure that all of the flavors would go together, especially the pineapple. But it works.  And the dressing is wonderful!

A salad that never gets boring!! Great as a main dish .. I doubled up the pineapple serving though because they are a great addition.  I also added a four cheese mexican mix to it! Everything is better with cheese!

I LOVED this recipe. I made a few changes - used normal onion (did not have red one on hand), skipped the pineapple, and fresh spinach instead of the romaine lettuce. I would definitely make more dressing.  I fried the chicken on just a little bit of olive oil, and seasoned is with salt and Mrs.Dash. My kids loved it and I was happy to serve a healthy and delicious dinner that was beautiful and colorful. We want to make this dish when we host our health conscious friends. They will love it! Thank you!

I found it pretty boring. Didn't taste bad, but definitely didn't wow me. I won't make again.

I really like this salad.  I marinaded my chicken using the marinade from the "Luau Chicken Sandwiches" recipe on this site.  The flavors taste great together.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a really good salad.  I didn't use fresh garlic and thought the dry minched garlic would work about the same.  I wouldn't recommend that, although everybody else thought it tasted good.  I couldn't stand the dry crunchiness of the garlic.  The rest of the salad was great!  I used the George Foreman grill to cook the chicken and seasoned it the way we like.  And, the lime juice was great but we also liked adding the pineapple juice from the can of pineapple we used(obvisously we didn't use fresh pineapple and I would recommend the canned pineapple).  It gave it a really nice flavor.

This is a great recipe!  Even my veggie hating husband had seconds!  The only changes I made were to leave the avocado on the side and up the amount of garlic in the dressing. Thanks for sharing Cocoadawn!

Served this salad as a part of a healthy lunch for a friend's birthday.  Everyone enjoyed it and it is colorful on the plate.  Will make again.

I was surprised at how MUCH our family enjoyed this for dinner tonight.  We've had over a MONTH of 100+ weather in Tulsa, and I just couldn't STAND the thought of cooking ANYTHING in my west-facing kitchen.  SO . . . Went to the deli, had them slice two THICK pieces of Roast Chicken Breast and assembled a completely heat-free dinner.  Agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews, however.  DOUBLE THE PINEAPPLE (and the dressing too if you don't enjoy the overwhelmingly fresh taste of the ingredients).  Enjoy!

Unique and hearty.  However, I found the dressing it calls for isn't a great match for the ingredients. (And boy, did that garlic keep repeating on me!).  I would make again but would use perhaps a raspberry vinaigrette or a balsamic dressing.  We added cheese (parmesan petals on one, crumbled feta for the other). I think a sprinkling of any kind of nuts would also be lovely.

No offense to the last review, but iceberg and romaine are two entirely differnt flavors.  Iceberg is what you feed rabbits and romaine is for human consumption IMO.  If the recipe is followed correctly it comes out quite nicely.  Thanks for sharing :)

Made exactly as written and loved it. So full of flavor! I honestly didn't think it even needed dressing, but we made it anyway and drizzled it on last. Everything was perfect together--the spicy red onions and the sweet pineapple. Maybe next time I'll try using fresh pineapple instead of canned.

It needs a different vinaigrette but in terms of a healthy meal, it's definitely healthy. I just expected it to be tangy or spicy, but it wasn't.

I made this salad as a main course for our dinner tonight and we thought it was just ok.  I followed the recipe (except I cut the ingredients in half) with two minor changes.  I used iceberg instead of romaine and I added about 1 tsp of honey to the salad dressing.  The end result was tasty, filling...and healthy!
