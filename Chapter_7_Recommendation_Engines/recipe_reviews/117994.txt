Delicious as is.  Wonderful way to use rhubarb (I had fresh from the garden).  The only thing I changed was the cook time (1 hour) because I had thick Costco pork chops.  YUM!  Will make again.

Wow, how great to be able to use rhubarb for something other than baked goods!  This makes sort of a stuffing that would probably be great as a side on its on as well; taking the covering off for the last 10 minutes of cooking makes some of the bread pieces nice and crisp.

I was surprised at how good this recipe was, however it was a bit dried out.  Next time I will add about 1/4 cup chicken stock or water to tenderize and moisten up the meat.  Really good flavour though!

This had a good sweet and tangy flavor, and the pork chops stayed nice and moist. I think I'll be making this for the next family gathering!

This is an awesome recipe.   I only had pork steaks instead of loin chops, but otherwise I didn't change a thing.   My husband said it was Sunday Dinner with company good.   The rhubarb and the bread cubes carmelize during the cooking and are a wonderful compliment to the pork.   I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.

Excellent!  I made it in a smaller pan so that it wouldn't dry out.  It was moist, and yummy.

wow!! this was amazing! I have never cooked with rhubarb before in my life! I cooked it exactly....the thing I think I did wrong was overcook the pork a bit...but that was my bad...but the flavor was awesome...I one time cooked chops with apples in a similar style and was thinking that apples added to it in the oven would have added to the amazing flavor!

I followed this recipe exactly.  I was skeptical but with the ratings being so good I thought maybe it would be a yummy change to the same old pork chop.  I really didn't enjoy the flavor at all and I couldn't even finish 1/4 of my pork chop.  My husband ate his but said he didn't really like it.  My kids begrudgingly ate a few bites but couldn't finish even a 1/4 of a chop.  In addition to not liking the flavor, I found the pork chops to be too dry.  I won't make this again.

This is a great recipe however, it is the exact same as the Taste Of Home recipe and that's who gets credit for it in my opinioon.

This tasted good enough, BUT if you are thinking of making this gluten free by substituting bread crumbs with Rice Chex, just do.  Not.  Go.  There.

Great flavor! My husband and I couldn't stop eating the sauce that it makes - the bread makes this recipe, and I admit I was leary of it.

Will definitely make again. Thank You for sharing!

Great recipe!  Did not change one ingredient.  Due to thickness of pork loin chop, baked at 375F.  Paired great with strawberry spinach salad.

Excellent way to use rhubarb in a unique and delicious way!!!!!! The rhubarb and brown sugar carmalizes the bread cumbs nicely and stayed very moist in a smaller pan. It is a bit on the sweet side but you still get the tang from the rhubarb. This is my fav recipe to use rhubarb from my Mom's garden other than making pies. :) Thanks for posting.

My family of four really loved this recipe. One even asked when I will make it again. Very yummy... My own review, I will probably cut down on the brown sugar a little, great flavor, just a tiny bit too sweet for me. Oh, and next time I think I'll do it in the crock pot - may help with keeping the meat moist and ready to fall apart! Served with garlic baked potato and a garden salad.

Okay, you really should scroll down to see the downsides of this recipe.  I've been making bread for 20 years and there's problems.  Didn't rise well, don't cover with a damp cloth or else it will stick.  All in all, the taste was good so it has potential that's why I gave it three stars.

This is a really interesting combination of flavors, but I wasn't very impressed.  It's something different to try every once in a while, but it's definitely not going to be a regular.

My daughter prepared this for 4-H Special Foods Contest today . . . . the judge said she was a little skeptical when she read the title . . . . but couldn't give it enough praise after she tasted it!  She loved it!  Our family enjoys when our daughter "practices" for her contest as we all get to enjoy eating it.  What a WONDERFUL way to use rhubarb.  It's almost like eating your dessert with your main course.   Give it a try.  I know you'll like it!

These were absolutely fantastic!! We grow rhubarb and I never thought to use it with pork chops. I didn't change a thing. Nice combo of sweet and tangy. Very easy and fast also.  Served with brown rice and homemade applesauce.

The only changes I made was I used dry rosemary (did not have fresh) and seasoned croutons in place of the day old bread.  My rhubarb was frozen.  My husband said it was a keeper. In fact I will be making it again for when his mom comes for supper.  Great melody of flavors.

Awesome.  I cooked four chops, two "normal" and two smoked.  All were tasty but the smoked were definitely better.  Delicious dish!

Very good!  Much as I love rhubarb pie, I've been looking for other uses, since we have a ton in the yard.  I am on WW and I'm sure this put me over on my points for the day, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I used some dried out baguette from the neighborhood bakery, and I put a little water in the frying pan, swished it around, and added that to the casserole before putting it in the oven, afraid it would be too dry.  I also used pork loin strips.  All in all, a yummy, comfort-food hit.

I thought this was quite yummy and a good use of garden rhubarb.  The rhubarb stuffing was a bit sweet and dessert like but really tasty.  I might cut the sugar back a little next time.  I needed to take the chops out at the end and give the rhubarb a good stir because some of the bread was dry on the top.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 starts was that it is unappealing to look at, the rhubarb cooks up brown and isn't very attractive. BUT the flavor is great, the porkchops stay nice and moist, and it's easy to make. Great way to use up all that rhubarb other than in some kind of dessert. Will be keeping this in my winter repetoire too to use up all the chopped rhubarb in my freezer.

Surprisingly delicious! Even my wife who does not like rhubarb or pork chops said we should have it again. Make sure not to over cook or the pork will be dry and tough.  Next time I am going to make it in a bigger pan and do 1/2 with chicken.

I really liked the idea of using rhubarb in a savory main dish, so I was looking forward to trying this.  It ended up being not bad, but not amazing either.  I think it is more my fault than anything because I don't really like stuffing in general and the rhubarb mixture ended up being a lot like stuffing.  We ate our dinner without a problem, but I don't think I will be making this again.

We loved this recipe.  Easy to prepare and delicious.  Unique, loaded with flavor and will make often when rhubarb is plentiful.
