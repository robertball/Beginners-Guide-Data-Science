This one is a keeper! It was quick, easy and got rave reviews from my husband and our friends. The wasabi was great in the slaw. Next time I may add some lime to the dressing for a little zing. The dressing/glaze didn't seem to do much for the fish. Next time I'll probably add a little more brown sugar or some honey before glazing the salmon just to give it a little more flavor and color. Overall, great though!

Well, well, well this one was a hard one to rate.  It was an okay recipe with an okay outcome, BUT what I'm wondering is: if the salmon was marinated in the wasabi mixture would it have more of a "hot" taste.  On the slaw the dressing was great, in fact my husband loved it, he said "it would be better without the seeds".  For the slaw, I cheated and used "Pearson" oriental stir fry, which consists of a mixture of chopped Napa, Bok Choy, celery, waterchestnuts & carrots.  It is found by the pre-packaged salads.  Came out excellent.  The fish on the other hand didn't have the hottness that I had hoped.  It was yummy, but not as I expected.  Like I said, marinating the fish may give it 5 stars, but recipe as is = barely a 4.  Thanks.

The salmon in this recipe was average. We used fresh salmon steaks so the fish was tasty.  The slaw reminded me a lot of those oriental cabbage salads made with coleslaw mix, crushed ramen noodles, sunflower seeds, etc.  The wasabi did kick it up a notch, though.  A good meal.

The wasabi glaze on the salmon was delicious! Had a great flavor but not TOO spicey for those who are worried about the wasabi. I highly reccomend this recipe!

The salmon I could take or leave. The slaw was awesome and I've made it separately many times since.

We weren't crazy about this. The wasabi sauce was pleasant on the salmon - it mellowed a little during the grilling - but we didn't like it on the 'slaw.' This was nice for a change, but I doubt I would make it again.

WOW!!! The dressing was SOOOOO HOT!!!  Luckily, I tasted it before I put it on the salmon and salad.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to serve to my family.
