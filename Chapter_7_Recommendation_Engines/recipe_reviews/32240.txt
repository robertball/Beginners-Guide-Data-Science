Very, very good!  This is one of those recipe where you have to adjust to your liking and it depends on how big your "scoops" of ice cream tend to be.  I like stuff a little thicker so I used less coffee.  These were great drizzled with additional chocolate syrup and topped with whipped cream - YUM!

This was great! The only thing is that the measurments are a bit off... or else I measured wrong! I ended up putting half the gallon in in order to make it thick! 
You could probably even get away with a half a cup of coffee w/ the ice cream and then make the consistency the way you prefer by using skim milk... oh also frozen yogurt would work just as well and much better for you :)

As another reviewer stated, the original recipie was very thin. If that is the way you want it it would be fine but i tend to like my milkshakes thick so i added a lot of extra frozen yogurt. Also, the original recipie had a strong coffee taste, but the more ice cream you add, the less it is.

I used Turkey Hill vanilla bean ice cream and I not only used leftover cold coffee, but I also added a shot of the extra concentrated coffee for an extra kick. This was quite the treat on a wicked humid and hot day. NOTE: If you're looking for a milkshake, in technical terms, this isn't thick. It's more like an ice cream frap, thinner than your average milkshake. It all depends on the quality of your coffee and ingredients, so don't skimp or your drink will fall short. But, that's with any recipe.

I made this several times since I had some ground coffee to use up. I rarely drink coffee, so I actually brewed it and let it get cold just for this recipe. This was quite tasty, but I wouldn't exactly call it a milkshake - it was quite liquid. It's more like a mocha "frappucino", I'd say. I made it exactly as written, but I guess a lot more ice cream would be needed to make it more milkshake-y. But, as is, it's a pretty nice drink. Thanks!

It was great, but the measurements are wrong I had to add so much icecream just to get it a little thick. I added way more ice cream than I would have liked to consume.

This is sooooo good.  I made this last night for me and my husband and we both decided that I needed to make a large batch of this and put it in the freezer so that we can blend it up really quick and have quickly.

This was really quick and simple to make, but I did make a few adjustments.  I used 6 ice cubes crushed, froze my coffee to a slush before adding it, and increased the ice cream (COFFEE flavor, not vanilla) to 4 scoops.  This made 2 medium sized thick shakes - just enough for me and to have one to share.

This is not really a milkshake. I think the ice cream should be 1 1/2 cups with 2 shots of espresso? The ratios for a milkshake are way off, this is more like a drink than a shake.

This was yummy! I actually used nonfat coffee flavored frozen yogurt (Stonyfield's), cold decaf coffee (because it was evening) and homemade chocolate syrup from this site.  Very refreshing!

When I read the ingredient list, I just couldn't figure out how the liquid to ice cream ratio of 3/4 of cup of coffee to one scoop of ice cream would make a milkshake? I decided to try it anyway, and I was right. The coffee with chocolate syrup tasted terrible before the ice cream was even added. I have tried similar recipes with coffee and chocolate syrup and they had the same off taste. I am not sure why I thought this would be different? I added the 1 scoop of ice cream, as suggested, and it turned to bad coffee with melted cream. I only made one serving and after one sip it got tossed. After reading the reviews I found people tripled the ice cream adding, as much as a half gallon, and another person even added coffee concentrate to increase the coffee flavor. The picture looks delicious to, but it looks like a lot was added to give it the right texture and flavor it badly needs.

I also use far more ice cream and less coffee. I brew strong though for this. through experimentation and trying to mimic another drink I've also found that if you leave out the chocolate and add about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon while blending, and another shake on top before the whipped cream, it's absolutely heavenly!

As others have already said, the ratio of ice cream to coffee seems way off. I used two scoops of ice cream but only about 3-4 ounces of coffee. I decided to take a different route and use caramel syrup instead of chocolate. I also topped with a little whipped cream and caramel syrup. This is a delicious milkshake that just needs a little less coffee than what is stated in the ingredient list.
