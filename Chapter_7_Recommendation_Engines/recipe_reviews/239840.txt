When my garden is overflowing with butternut squash this is my go to recipe.  It's easy to make these waffles and freeze them for use in the winter.  My kids eat them up!

Yummy.  Just enough spice to make you feel like it's breakfast on Christmas morning.  Also a great use for leftover squash.  The leftover waffles are very good the next day toasted with apple butter.
