I made this with just the crab (because i didn't have the lobster or shrimp in the house) and it was sooooo good!  I can't imagine how good it will be next time when i use the lobster and shrimp.

Great! I have made this for years using only the lump crab meat. We have always used Cheddar Cheese and regular Cream Cheese. The Velveeta does make is taste phoney if you have had the Cheddar. Try this option and see if you like it better.

I love seafood dip - but this was not to my liking.   I think it is best to omit the old bay seasoning.

The recipe is simple and very good. We like spicy food so I added spinach, rotel with the habaneros (drained well, didn't use the juice) and finely chopped water chestnuts to give it a little color and crunch. Yummy!

Was not really impressed with how this turned out. It wasn't what I expected as far as taste. Will not make this again.

I know there are many great reviews of this recipe, but I found this dip really lacked flavor.   After spending almost $20 in ingredients, I was disappointed.  Several people said that it had too much Old Bay, so I put in about half at first.  But when I tasted the dip all I tasted was cheese.  So, I added in the rest of the Old Bay and that did help to bring out some of the seafood flavor.  I also added in some spicy seafood seasoning, pepper and garlic and that also helped to add some flavor.  On the positive, the dip does remain smooth and creamy in the crockpot and if you are serving for people who like pretty bland food, this would be fine.

BLAH! Really BLAH! I made this for a group of people last night and we were all of the same opinion.  This recipe as it stands is just not worth the calories.  I will not make again.

Love it!! If you love seafood plus cheese, holy cow! I used velveeta, but next time I'm using that plus pepper jack, experiment with any of your favorites...

I just used a dash of Old Bay...but never thought sour cream would be good for a heated dip, cream cheese and Velveeta, sure ,but hey good job rachel! Will make again, and again!

I followed the recipe as written, but did add a can of rotel tomatoes (drained) as suggested by others; served the mixture in a small crockpot.  While the flavor was yummy, it came out way to thin and runny, which was not what I expected.  Used the leftovers the next morning on scrambled eggs-yum!

Wonderful!! Made it last weekend for a party. Everyone enjoyed. Didn't change anything except the Lobster, didn't have it. Making it tonight but I'm making it into a pasta instead of a dip, that's how good it is!!

This was amazing, HUGE hit at our New Year's eve party. I used shrimp & crabmeat and omitted the old bay because i didn't have any. Also added 1C of mixed cheddar cheese after the velveeta melted. Guests said it was better than in the restaurant. Wonderful, easy recipe, and so impressive.

This is really tasty!  I made it over the 4th of July weekend for cabin guests and it was a hit!  The only change I made was to add 4 chopped green onions (white & the green tops) just 'cuz I thought it sounded good & had them on hand....I used salad size shrimp and didn't have lobster meat so I chopped up some imitation crab, which actually works just fine in this and is much more economical. I doubled this recipe and it was plenty for 6 of us. Was a bit concerned about using the "fake" cheese but the sour cream & cream cheese mellows it out and the flavors blend nicely together. Some hot sauce would go great in this, too! I think next time I may hollow out a round loaf of bread & put the dip inside, then bake for 15 minutes or so to get the bread bowl crispy.  I think the firmer bread would be better for dipping, rather than the thinly sliced french bread I used.  Any hearty bread would do for this dip. It's a keeper, for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

Mine came out very thin. My guests are it like a seafood chowder soup. I did  use extra chopped up small shrimp since I did not have any lobstah. I put more seafood then was called for about 2 cups.

We really liked this dip. It was a bit thin, so I might hold back on some of the sour cream. And some others had some great suggestions with tomatoes. It was definitely yummy and it will make it to my personal recipe box. Very good!!
