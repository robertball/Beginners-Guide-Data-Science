This was delicious!  I wasn't sure if the chicken was supposed to be frozen or thawed, but since the recipe called for browning it, I thawed my chicken.  It worked well.

I don't like artichokes, so I left those out, but other than that I made as directed.  Once the chicken was done, we shredded it and ate it with pita bread.  I had some homemade tzatziki sauce, which my son loves, so he used some of that as well and said it was really good.

Great recipe!

Excellent even though I was forced to make some changes I loved it. I didn't have garlic and herb seasoning so I had to use Herbs de Provence and I didn't have a red onion so I had to use celery. I also threw some fresh roma tomatoes in and made a greek oil dressing I found on this site. Really thought this was delicious though and will make again. Hopefully correctly next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this last night and it  was delicious!  I used 4 chicken breasts and found that I didnt have enough seasoning to cover them so I will double the seasoning next time.   The chicken is so tender and has intense flavor permeating throughout.  Definitely going in my file!  :)

This was very good although my family found the amount of olive overwhelming. I will make this again as it was otherwise very, very good but will cut back on the olive from 1 cup to a heavy 1/2 cup.

Even my husband who doesn't like chicken said how good this is!  As others have said, I found it a tad oily (the only reason this got 4 stars) so will pour off some of the oil from the dressing next time.  After step 5, I added some feta and let it melt into the sauce.  I eliminated the arrowroot and served over noodles with additional feta.

My wife and I are on a Mediterranean diet and we're always on the lookout for good recipes. We both gave this a 4 out of 5 and would enthusiastically cook it again. It wasn't too expensive. The prep was 3/5 easy. It was cooked within the time alotted. The Instant Pot makes this a delicious dish. Well worth making. Unusually good and unique taste. Very juicy with the Instant Pot.b

Super easy and very tasty. I sauted the garlic in olive oil in the IP and then just threw everything in (I'm lazy). It really turned out great! Hubby suggested using lamb next time.

Fairly new to the Instant Pot, so I followed this recipe with no changes....AND LOVED IT.  Served it over cheese toast as an open-faced sandwich. Will definitely make again in the near future.

Oh my gosh this was Devine!  I did not add the feta and I’m glad because the flavors were strong enough without it. Next time I will cut back on the olives too. I liked it how it was but my spouse declared it slightly too “olivey”.

Really nice recipe.  I don't have an Instant pot so I browned the seasoned chicken and arranged the rest of the ingredients in a baking pan at 350 for about 35 minutes.  Made my own salad dressing (6 T olive oil, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1 T lemon juice, 1 clove garlic, minced, 1 t Dijon mustard, 1 t dried oregano).  Try this chicken recipe, you won't be disappointed.
