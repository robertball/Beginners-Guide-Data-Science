Low and slow is hours not 90 minutes.  Whether I am doing ribs on my grill or electric smoker or my oven, I cook them for a minimum of 4 hours at between 225 and 275 degrees.  Other than that this is a great recipe for ribs and sauce.  MMMMMMMMMM sweet and sticky is the name of the game. :-)

These ribs were not at all impressive, I didn't feel the dry rub mixed with the BBQ sauce complimented eachother in any way.

You will love these ribsâ€”they're the best I ever made! I prepped them the night before so the flavors could develop, and I could have a relaxing day!

I made the recipe as written.  I haven't ever added fennel to any of my BBQ recipies.  We couldn't decide if we liked that flavor or not.  We ate them again for left overs to see if we did or not.  I will make them again but omit the fennel.

These ribs were delicious! I marinaded them overnight with the rub and followed the recipe without alterations aside from the fact that I had access to a smoker later in the cooking cycle. I brought my slow grilled ribs with hickory smoke chips in my gas grill to my friend's house after cooking for almost two hours at about 275. I placed the ribs in a sheet pan and placed on the grill on indirect heat. I took them out and covered in aluminum foil so they probably kept cooking along the way to the smoker. I made this simple but tasty sauce and put a coating on during transport, then a few more light coatings as they cooked in the smoker for another 40 or so minutes. 

These ribs were not overly salty, nor dry. they were nice and tender but not falling to pieces off the bone. If you are the type that wants a little more heat in your taste then add some more chili or cayenne for that extra kick. These were pleasant but not too spicy hot. Perfect for the crowd I was feeding.  I will definitely make again! Leave some of the leftover sauce on the table for those that like a wet sloppy eating rib. :) It's a shame I was a nice guy and left the leftovers with my buddy! I was desiring more later that night when I got home.

I over cooked the ribs, but it was still very good.  Will make again and keep a closer watch on the time.

I made these for dinner party of 20, they were easy to make ( I omitted the fennel I find it's an acquired taste), they were a huge hit everyone loved them. Will make these again

These ribs take a lot of effort and time. But the payoff is well worth it!! Among the best ribs I've made so far! There is lots of flavour. I recommend prepping everything a day early.

Made the ribs in my smoker. The rub is awsome. I've used the rub several times on differant pork cuts. I used it on a pork butt for a party my college son and his room mates had. A 10# roast, 12 college boys and I was a hero.

Excellent recipe, loved it. The fennel seed really added a bit extra  and made it amazing.
