I love veggie combo recipes, and this is a good one. I served it to my family, and all 9 veggie eaters liked it. Some loved it. We like a little more kapow, so I added jalapenos with a few seeds, 1/8 tsp cayenne, and some cumin. I used chopped garlic in a jar, but fresh would be better. I tripled the cilantro and omitted spinach. I boiled the corn, then threw it in a pan over high heat for about 7 minutes. Probably not as good as grilled, but still yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

This is fantastic and 10 stars all the way! I did use the entire 15 ounce can of beans and doubled the cheese but kept everything else the same. This is by far one of the best salads I've made and would go with pretty much anything. I do recommend waiting to add the spinach until an hour before you plan on serving it so that it doesn't get too wilted. This is a great recipe and one that I will make often in the summer. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and super easy to make. We only grilled the corn on grill instead of boiling first and gave corn more of a bite. Thinking of adding fresh mangoes next time.

So fresh and delicious!  My guests loved it! To save time, I cut the corn off the cob while cold and put it on a flat grill pan with a little olive oil and placed it on a medium heat  grill (without the boiling process) and the corn browned up nicely in the pan in about 12 minutes (season with salt).  I cooled the corn and added the rest of fresh ingredients (minus spinach, avocado & cheese) and dressing in bowl three hours before guest arrived.  When guests came I put the charred corn and toppings on field greens and it didn't need any other dressing. (I didn't have a ripe avocado or Gorgonzola so these were left off)  So delicious!  I doubled the corn/vegetable/herb topping and used the second half as corn salsa with tortilla chips later in the night and it was a hit too!
