We loved Arroz de Braga!  But, be warned, the six cups of rice + all the meat and vegetables will never fit in a "large saucepan"!  Next time, we will use 2 cups rice.   Also, the spring onion greens, mixed with a little more chopped parsley, made a wonderful fresh garnish for this.

I love a one pot dish but there is a lot of prep work involved unless you use boneless, skinless chicken thighs and drumsticks. Other than cutting the portions back to four servings I made this as written with one exception, I didn't add any salt.  I assumed that the ham and smoked sausage would have more than needed and I was right.  If I were to make this again I would use the spring onions to garnish the finished dish.

My family really didn't care for this recipe. I was just OK. Will probably not make again.

Very tasty, needed a large cast iron ceramic lined casserole dish to finish it but the whole family loved it! Thanks sharing a taste of Portugal with us!

The was very good.  The changes I made were using chicken broth instead of water and only using 2 cups of raw white rice.   came out very good.

This is quick and easy! A colorful and flavorful one-pot dish that I would make again. I did have to add some more water to the rice while it was cooking.
