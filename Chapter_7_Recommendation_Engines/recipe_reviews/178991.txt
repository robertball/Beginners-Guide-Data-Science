If you are looking for "creamy" mashed potatoes, this is NOT what you are looking for.  My family loves mashed potatoes & I am always trying to change them up a bit.  We are all garic fans, so the garlic flavor was great, but the consistency of the potatoes was more watery than we like.  These potatoes need something...

Great! The chicken broth always adds an extra level of flavor to the potatoes. It was nice not to have to worry about adding peeled cloves of garlic to the potato water, as it was already in the broth. I did only use a bit of the broth the potatoes were cooked in and added a couple cubes of butter and a spoonful of sour cream for added richness and creaminess. Superb.

This is very nice to have on hand for the members of my family who can't or don't eat dairy products. I have tried it with vegetable broth, and it is good, but has a veggie taste. I don't recommend low or fat free broths as it gives the potatoes a "flat" taste.

This was by far the BEST recipe I have tried for mashed potatoes!  It went perfectly with my Easter ham and old fashioned green beans!  I will not be able to make plain mashed potatoes again!  And this was so easy too!

I love this recipe because it is easy and healthy--not loaded with tons of butter, cream...non-dairy, in fact.  My daughter ate them up!  Wonderful flavor...If you are looking for a rich and creamy recipe, this is not the one, but it was perfect for us...because I served it with a heavier main dish...and then seasoned veggies.  Will definitely make it again--thanks!!

Delicious!!  The only change I made was to substitute heavy cream for the broth and add a stick of butter.  Will definitely make again!

There is a good reason that chefs use fat and cream in their recipes! No butter and milk in mashed potatoes equals non creamy, mealy potatoes that are more gritty than anything.
