I took this to the fellowship hour at church.  Everyone raved and had to have the recipe.  I usually make a recipe as written when making for the first time; however I was not at all sure that a layer cake would transport easily.  So here is what I did: I made the cake as written, removed from the pan and cooled.  Instead of splitting and filling the cake I made a coller for the pan, placed it back in the 9x13 and put the pie filling on top.  I then mixed up the pudding and poured it on the pie filling and chilled until solid.  I frosted with the Cool Whip and sprinkled pecans on top.  I omitted the caramel ice cream topping all togather as I like tart and felt it would add too much sweetness.  I will make this again, maybe next time with the ice cream topping.
