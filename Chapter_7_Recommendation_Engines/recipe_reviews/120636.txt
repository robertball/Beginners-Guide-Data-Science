Outstanding. Sometimes instead of brown sugar I will use orange marmalade or apricot preserves. It gives the carrots an extra dimension to their flavor.

I doubled the recipe but should not have doubled the sauce ingredients (except the butter).  My husband and I loved it, the kids thought the mustard and ginger were too strong.  It is a nice change from the sweet sauces. I will make it again.

I'm not normally a fan of cooked carrots - I much prefer them raw - but these were WONDERFUL!!  I think using baby carrots makes all the difference, as the natural sweetness balances the zip of the dijon mustard and the ginger.  I've recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and am looking for flavorful, yet healthful, recipes, and this fits the bill! 

Wonderful!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Deeeeelicious!  Used 5 large carrots, cut them in thirds and proceeded to cut those pieces in fourths (length wise). Other than that I followed the recipe to the T and everyone gobbled them up. An absolute keeper. Thank you kindly for sharing!

Easy and delicious!  I cut the baby carrots in half lengthwise and microwaved for 3 minutes to help keep in more nutrients.  Even my husband who isn't fond of carrots loved them.

So easy and so good - I used a steam in bag of carrots.  I mixed the other ingredients separately and just poured over top.  I wouldn't change a thing!  This went great with breaded chicken.

Really good. I've been trying out lots of carrot recipes to narrow down what I want to make for Thanksgiving, and I like this one the best out of all the ones I've tried on here. The dijon gives it such a depth of flavor but it wasn't too sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover baby carrots and decided to try this one.  I added some onion in with the boiling carrots.  Will make again.

I adore this recipe!  The ginger and mustard add a delicious complexity to glazed carrots.  yum!  yum!  The prep and cooking are easy too.  This recipe has become a favorite in our house.  We have been known to make extra of the glaze... ;)

I decided to make these as directed amidst the reviews of it being to pungent from the mustard and ginger, though I found that wasn't the case for me.  Instead of boiling the carrots I steamed them in the microwave to reduce nutrient loss through osmosis in the cooking water.  I made the sauce on the stove and had no trouble making a nice glaze.  **Learn from my mistake--remember to drain the carrots before adding the glaze, or else you'll wind up with more of a carrot broth instead of a glaze**  I would definitely make this again.

I have to say, it wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be! I didn't think it added much umph. The flavors didn't come through that well I was really excited to taste the ginger.  I think this could work with some changes.

Mustard and carrots? Sounds weird, but it works. I could best describe the taste of this as honey mustard carrots. We enjoyed this dish. Even hubby who prefers his carrots unadulterated and pure and plain gave this a thumbs up. Good recipe and we will have these again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I thought these would be too sweet, but not at all. I used a good beer and brat mustard with horseradish in it and the carrots were fantastic!

The Dijon mustard was too strong a flavor for my tastes.  I was hoping it would be more subtle.  I probably won't make these again (purely my taste preference), although I guess I could use half as much mustard.  I actually prefer Candied Carrots from this site.

These are great!! I eyeballed everything, used a mix of baby carrots and regular carrot chunks, and added considerably more than 1/2 tsp ginger, and they turned out terrific!! Also very quick and easy.

I substituted olive oil for the butter and maple syrup for the brown sugar (maple syrup has glycemic index of 0.) Very flavorful. We saved the left over dressing and used it on broccoli the next day which was just as delicious. I will definitely make this again!

I'll make these gingernger-mustardy carrots over the holidays as a side dish for some and as a feature of a vegetarian hot table, for other diners.  The use of ginger is inspired.  And so easy.  I don't use the so-called baby items from a bag - I'm leery of the white spray on them. On testing, I cut thin carrots to size.  This is bound to be a family holiday classic for my family.  Many thanks.

These were a big hit. I doubled the recipe, but cut back on the butter by about a 1/3. Next time I might try even a little less butter to make them healthier.

I am not a fan of carrrots but i could eat a lot of this.  The dijon gave it a great, different flavor. Yumm!  I left a little bit of crunch in the carrots but reducing the cooking time in the water.  I also cut them into dimes instead of strips.  Will make again!!!

These are great! Made them tonight in a pinch with a can of carrots and they were delicious. I can't imagine how much better they'll be with fresh ones. This will definitely become a regular side in my rotation- best carrot dish I've ever had! Tangy, slightly sweet with a kick from the Dijon = YUM!

Fantastic, delicious, simple dish. The sauce is wonderfully sweet and salty at the same time. Love this! Makes me want to eat carrots all the time!

These carrots were okay - I found them a little too sweet.  Next time I would use half the recomended butter and brown sugar.  The mustard adds a really unique flavour to the carrots and I am going to try this one again with some modifications...

Yummy recipe.  Its so hard to find a good recipe for veggies as a side dish that my husband will eat and say it's delicious.  The dijon mustard with the sweet and ginger flavor are amazing together.  Worth making any chance you can!

Very good. I had some baby carrots sitting in the fridge going bad and wanted to do something with them but didn't really have a taste for super sweet candied carrots so i decide to try this instead and I am glad I did. It has a nice mellow bite of the dijon and a little sweet from the brown sugar a very nice blend I recomend trying it at least once

This is an excellent carrot recipe dish.  I followed the instructions as is and it turned out great.  May I suggest the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of horseradish (for 4 servings) to zip up the taste but the recipe is fine as it is.

This was OK - it turned out a kind of buttery, sweet sauce. The sauce toned down the brightness of the carrots, which isn't really a good thing. My family ate it, but it was far from a 'star dish'. In the future, I would instead opt for the much easier and more delicious method of just cooking the carrots in water with some brown sugar (glazed carrots).

These were very tasty and super easy.  I used fresh 'regular' carrots that you peel.  Did mine in spears, steamed them and then just mixed the other ingredients in a saucepan over the stove and poured over top.  Used some fresh ginger instead of dried as I didn't have any dried.  Yummy :)

This is a very easy and good side.  We had it tonight with a potato and pork chop casserole.  I like that it has more of a complex flavor than regular glazed carrots.  We'll make again.

Great recipe! I have used fresh baby carrots and have also made with with frozen crinkle cut carrots.  Excellent with both! My husband, who is not a fan of carrots, even loved these!  Thank you for a terrific recipe.

Very yummy!  The glaze is a good balance of sweet and savory.  The ginger isn't a very strong taste (which I liked) but if you're looking for something more ginger-y I'd add a bit more powdered ginger or use fresh grated ginger.

For my first time making glazed carrots, I couldn't be more pleased with this recipe!  The sweet/savory carrots paired beautifully with my "modified" St. Patrick's Day dinner of Colcannon, Turkey Kielbasa and Irish Soda Bread. Delicious! My only variation was using whole carrots that I peeled and sliced on the bias.  Thank You for posting, Teri! This will definitely make it into my recipe rotation.

Fantastic! So easy to make and I had everything lying around the house. The sugar and ginger make a great combination. Hubby and I devoured the entire pan. I will add this to my go-to recipes for a nice side item.

Just made these for Easter dinner tomorrow. We love spicy recipes that are a deviation from the standard, but this was just not a good combination of flavors. Maybe less mustard would make it a little more tolerable. If you're going to give it a try anyway you should dip one carrot in the glaze and try it before you pour it over the whole lot.

This is a great change from regular steamed or boiled carrots. The sweet mustard ginger sauce was delicious. I just used 16 oz of regular carrots because I don't buy the baby ones. There was quite a lot of sauce so you could probably use 24 oz of carrots or so for this recipe.

WOW! These are great. And I don't like cooked carrots! Just tried these because I know I need to feed my family more carrots and plain fresh are getting boring. 5 out of 5 gave these 5 stars! The ginger and dijon  bounce off each other and the sweetness of the glaze was a treat.

These were pretty good.  I had never tried glazed carrots before and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I might use a little less mustard next time, as they tasted pretty mustardy (and I LIKE mustard).  We didn't have baby carrots, so I cut a few regular carrots into bite-size pieces, which worked just fine (and less costly!).  Good recipe!

My kids were liking this recipe as for myself as well. Hubby was the one that said, the flavors were overpowering for him....I couldn't see it. But my kids were very well won over on this one. And it thrilled me....and that's what really matters. Happy to make this again.

I don't even like carrots and these are the very best!!!!!! I did cut the amount of ginger in half, that's the only change. My husband loved them. He said the mustard flavor was not as strong as he expected. LOVED THEM!!! These will definitely be made again.

My bunch are not cooked carrot eaters.  Both my daughter and her husband said they have NEVER eaten cooked carrots that they liked, but this dish was a keeper.  I was also baking a ham, so I substituted the maraschino cherry juice for part of the water, and threw in about 6 of the maraschino cherries.  They were a very nice addition.

Fantastic.  I added 1/2 tsp of horseradish as recommended by another reviewer.  I also used a bag of frozen baby carrots instead of fresh.  Once you let them thaw they are soft enough (for adults) to toss right in the sauce, no need to boil & drain.

Very good!  I've made glazed carrots before, but I liked the addition of the mustard and ginger.

Fabulous carrots!  I used whole carrots (peeled and cut on an angle) and added them back to the glaze and let them simmer until supper was done.  Good, good, good!

These carrots were fantastic!  I was well on my way to having these finished when I realized I had no dijon mustard, so I substituted regular prepared yellow mustard instead and they were delicious!  Very east to make and had a wonderful flavor!  These are now a regular side dish at our house!!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These carrots are simple and delicious.  I was skeptical because dijon mustard is not an ingedient of which i am overly fond.  However, you only get a hint of the taste.  It nicely balances out the sweet taste of the brown sugar.  The only thing i added was about 2 teaspoons of honey.  My son kept digging in for more.  My husband doesn't like carrots but he liked these.

A good, basic glazed carrot recipe.  I love the dijon flavor in it.  I made the recipe as it was posted and we liked it but I may try some dried herbs and fresh ground pepper next time.

This is a super easy, super fast recipe for when you don't feel like eating raw baby carrots, which is usually the only way I eat them. My husband loved this so much that he asked me how to make them (that in itself is a miracle) and the kicker is that he made them twice more in the same week! I count that as a huge success.

I'm not very fond of carrots but I tried this recipe for a change.  I must say these were the best glazed carrots I've ever had.  And I make them quite often now.

I normally don't like cooked carrots, but these were so good I almost ate the entire thing in one sitting.  This a nice twist to regular glazed carrots.  The only thing I would change is to half the butter and seasonings.  I had a lot of sauce left over at the bottom of the bowl.

Simple and delicious! More like a sauce than a glaze, and not too sweet. I used grainy Dijon mustard and regular-sized carrots.

I really liked this recipe.  I used a wisk to combine the ingredients for the sauce, and it was smooth and nice.  I didn't have dry ground ginger, so I used about a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger instead, and it was very yummy.  Disappeared at the dinner table, in part because my kids liked it!

For some reason the brown sugar wouldnt dissolve, it just chunked together... What happened?? I poured the sause over top anyways and picked the brown chunks out of it.. the carrots tasted good but I thought it would have been better with all of the positive reviews. Every one ate it at my house and said it was good.

I was a little worried about the sugar; I am not a big fan of candied carrots and thought it might make them taste like that.  However, it just added some depth of flavor to the carrots.  Bf liked them despite the mustard (he hates it) and I didn't tell him there was mustard in it so I can make them again.  So easy and very good.  Thanks!

The mustard is the secret ingredient in this recipe. I used Hickory Farms Sweet and Hot mustard because it sounded like it would be good and it was GREAT! I am going to try Honey Dijon mustard the next time. Everyone loved these.

Maybe I shouldn't be rating this because I feel like I must've done something wrong it turned out so bad. I just doubled everything, the glaze smelled so awful I didn't even bother putting it on the carrots. I think maybe too much dijon mustard, but not sure.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and I wish I would have made more as I only made a half recipe. They were delicious! I made a few substitutions to accomodate my vegan diet. I used Earth Balance margarine instead of butter. And just to cut back on sugar, I used only 1 TB of brown sugar and added 2 TB of agave syrup. I want to make this again.

These carrots are really good! Not too sweet with just the right amount of tang from the mustard. I like these better than candied carrots or honey glazed carrots. I made these to accompany the leg of lamb that my bf made last night and it was a great match. Thanks!

Sauce was pretty watery, not really a glaze.  Due to the consistency you only got a hint of the sauce.  Will keep looking.

Excellent! I made this for the first time tonight and followed the recipe exactly, It was FANTASTIC!!! I never would've thought dijon and carrots worked but they do. I will keep this as a regular addition to the meal. I had them as a side dish to a Red Wine Pot Roast with Tomato/Herb Rice and salad. 

Don't hesitate to make this...you won't regret it.

Tasted okay.  Wasn't my favourite but everyone else said they loved them.  I found there was WAY TOO much sauce though for the amount of carrots suggested.  I would definately reduce the amount of glaze next time.

Did not add dijon, used orange marmalade instead.  Very yummy.  The ginger adds a really nice flavour.

it was okay.  not to dijon-ish or brown sugar-ish. couldn't taste the ginger at all. needed pepper to balance out the flavours.  i'll keep looking for a good carrot recipe.  i used the crinkle cut carrot slices you find in the vegetable department and they cooked quicker

Too much butter.  And I didn't really like the ginger.  Not my thing.

This is just so tasty - I bought a big bunch of carrots and have been working my way through a few ways to prepare them. So far, this is the winner. I did cook the carrots in the microwave (next time I'm going to grill them on the barbeque). Thanks for the recipe Teri.
