Great for a quick meal! I pounded the chicken breasts down thin first and then seasoned them before grilling. I used some red and green peppers along with some red onion. I left out the mushrooms as I didn't have any on hand. I toasted the buns before assembling the sandwiches and added a little ranch dressing along wih some extra bbq sauce.

This is pretty good. I thought it was missing something so I think next time I will use a spicy bbq sauce. I used original flavor since I didn't know if the suggested brand was spicy or not. I also pounded the chicken breasts flat so they would cook evenly and we would not have a really fat piece of chicken on the sandwich.  When sauteing the veggies put the bell peppers in first and let them cook a little bit, then add the onions and when they are about done add the mushrooms. I didn't think about doing this when I made it so I ended up with over cooked mushrooms perfect onions and crunchy bell peppers. I used an onion bun.  Definitely worth trying.

Since we don't have a grill, I made this in a skillet.  I coated the skillet with Pam, put seasonings on the chicken and then seared it on both sides.  Then I started spreading BBQ sauce on it every time I flipped it - about every 5-6 minutes.  I did kinda eye the seasonings instead of measuring them out and used a "bold" BBQ sauce.  It took about 18 minutes on medium heat in my skillet to cook through using medium-sized chicken breasts.  I toasted the buns in the oven for a few minutes, then put on the chicken and cheese (used provolone because that was all I had) and put back in the oven for about 2 minutes until the cheese melted.  Then I topped with the onions and mushrooms (didn't use bell peppers because we don't like them and I didn't have them).  Hubby and I both really enjoyed this sandwich.  We served it with homemade fries and cut up apples.

We liked these sandwiches. The sandwich was pretty simple to make. Like another reviewer, I also flattened the chicken breast a little by lightly poundimg them. I also made enough chicken breasts so I could use "Everything" Hogie Rolls. I put the Italian seasoning and the grilling seasonings in a paper bag, added the breasts and shook them. Boy, were they coated. I used Mesquite BBQ sauce, our favorite and grillled them inside on the George Forman. When I sauted the veggies, I used olive oil. And I did cook the veggies one at a time, as suggested, so they would be done at the same time. I forgot to get cheese so I used a smoky swiss and cheddar. We will probably have these again but, I will probably rethink the seasonings. Maybe leave out the Italian seasoning and along with the grilling seasoning, add some Mesquite Grilling seasoning and onion and garlic powder. Oh, I cooked the chicken at a higher heat so they would cook faster. I didn't want them to dry out, and they didn't.

Like others, I pound the chicken breasts thin so they absorb more flavor, and I marinate the chicken in bbq sauce and a sprinkle of dry Italian dressing for a few hours. I cook them on the Foreman grill, and it takes no time at all. This is a great, filling sandwich for lunch - keeps me going all day! Thanks, Heather!

I marinated my chicken in Italian dressing for a couple of hours before cooking, than pounded my chicken down to make a little flatter. As I was going to turn on the grill found we were out of proprane--so I used the broiler which worked fine except for the fact that it's a pain to clean off. I used frozen pepper mix (love this stuff), fresh onion, and canned mushrooms. I really liked this sandwich, found it really good. Both my husband and I think a hearty roll with a back on it would work best since our veggies kept falling off the sandwich. I liked the swiss cheese with the sandwich, and I plan on making these again. I liked them very much.

I halved the recipe for 2 servings, tho' kept the same full quantity of vegs. & mushrooms. I'd been thinking of leaving out the Italian seasoning because I sensed it might throw off the sweet, smokey, tangy flavor of the Neely's BBQ Spice Rub & the chipotle barbecue sauce I used; I also didn't want the Italian herbs to burn on the grilled chicken. Reading another reviewer's statement about the Italian herbs made me decide to go with my instinct. I had to addat least another tsp. of butter to saute the vegs, which I added at different stages per other reviewers. ~~We both liked this, but probably will make only a few more times, as there are so many other chicken dishes I prefer. After tasting this as recipe was intended, we found we liked it better with crunchy moist lettuce, more Swiss cheese, & 1 Tblsp. of mayonnaise mixed with 1-1/2 tsp. of the same chipotle BBQ sauce spread on the whole wheat Kaiser roll. Out of curiosity & having 3 types of mushrooms available, I sauteed in separate pans mostly the sliced common white button mushrooms (this was best), some chopped portabello (this was very good), & some hedgehog mushrooms (I now know I don't like this type).

We liked these; I did follow Rae's advice about not cooking all the veggies at once since some take longer to cook until soft.  We also used colby jack cheese because kids wont eat Swiss... I thought 3T Italian seasonings was a bit much so I just seasoned it until it looked right!.. This was sort of just like making a hamburger, not sure you really need a recipe but good for beginning cooks!.. Thanks!

This was good but I was expecting more flavor with all the seasonings. I found this to be just a basic barbecued chicken sandwich with toppings. I doubt that I will make this again.

I thought these were tasty. I liked the addition of the peppers, onions, and mushrooms. I did pound the breasts out and cut them into same size pieces. Hubby thought they lacked a bit of flavor, next we will cook them on charcoal not gas. Thanks for the great recipe!

LOVED it! The only thing I did differently was to slice the chicken after the grilling (no way affected the taste) and then I used misc. peppers from the end of the garden because they were going bad AND DH doesn't care for bell pepper too much. I also used shredded cheese that I already had instead of the slices (again no way affected the taste) and this was a very nice change in my every day routine. Thanks!

I really liked making these sandwiches.  They were full of flavor!  They were something different than just your plain ole' grilled chicken sandwich.  The seasonings and BBQ sauce together really add a lot of extra flavor.  Toasting the buns and adding lettuce and tomato just tops it all off perfectly!

Easy to make and it pleased everyone. Just pick out your favorite sauce.  Montreal Chicken seasoning is great on just about anything.

Very good chicken sandwich. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added tri-colored peppers chopped. Portabellos sealded the deal.

easy to make.  I sauted garlic with the onion, pepper and mushroom mixture. I also added Kraft Italian dressing to the buns and grilled the buns . Next time I might try marinating the chicken in Italian dressing  instead of  using a 'dry rub' seasoning.

Not bad. While I generally like well-seasoned foods, this was a bit overkill for me. My hubs and I both agree that cutting back on the spice rub is an absolute must. Although fine as written, I saw an opportunity to make this even better so I ran with it. :) I can't imagine a sandwich without bacon, so I fried up a couple slices for our sandwiches. I then sauteed my onion / pepper mixture (I omitted the mushrooms called for and used a red / green pepper combo instead) in my reserved bacon grease. My final change was subbing Swiss cheese for provolone. A generous slathering of mayo hit the spot. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Heather. Although I won't be jumping out of my seat to make this again, I'm glad to have given this a try nonetheless. :-)

Very good! Super easy. I wish I would have done as someone else suggested and pounded the chicken first. I sliced the chicken instead. Pounded chicken would have been easier. I used a red bell instead of a green bell pepper and used a few more mushrooms (our family loves shrooms). All in all, this was a definite hit in our house. But what's not to love? Chicken, bbq, cheese, bread...can't beat beat!

Definitely better flattened.  Another option is to butterfly the chicken breast forming a pocket and putting additional seasoning inside..  This more evenly distributes the flavor and reduces the bbq sauce from overtaking the Italian seasoning.  The seasoning and bbq sauce together work great.  I also added half teaspoon red pepper flakes to give it some more kick.
