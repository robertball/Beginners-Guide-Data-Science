We loved these as a light snack before Thanksgiving dinner. I added some hot sauce. These were fast and easy to put together. Everyone raved about them. Thank you for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  Dinner party guests loved it and so did we.  I will make it again and again.  Toss veggies with a sprinkle of chili powder for some extra flavor, YUM!
