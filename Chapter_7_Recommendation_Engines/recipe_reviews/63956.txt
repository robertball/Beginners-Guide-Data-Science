Easy to make and delicious taste because of cream cheese and butter.  Added couple of drops of green food coloring.  Perfect!

This was a great recipe. My whole family LOVED it!  I used a graham cracker crust instead of vanilla wafers, but it still turned out great.

This recipe was very easy--I used a pre-made graham cracker crust instead of making my own crust, and I had the filling made in just minutes.  The consistency of the pie was good--very smooth and creamy.  However, it was not as tart and "limey" as I had hoped it would be!

I love making this...it is so yummy...I think the crust is worth the small effort it takes. The crunchiness of the almonds just goes well with the pie filling to me.

Next time I am going to add a couple of drops of green food coloring like someone suggested.

I'll give it a 5 for simplicity but the taste is just ordinary.  It doesn't have enough lime flavor.  The crust is the best part and certainly beats all the prepared grahm crusts I have bought in the past.  If you live near a Spanish grocery store, Mexican and Spanish limes are the same thing as Key limes - only cheaper.

This was very good. I used a store bought graham crust and regular lime juice because I didn't have key lime. It wasn't quite as tart as I'd hoped but I'm sure that was because of the lime juice. The milk makes it very rich and dense which I liked but if you're looking for something light this isn't it.

I really enjoyed the texture of the pie.  For more of the lime punch, I included the zest of 2-3 limes.

This is personally the best key lime pie I've baked! I've tried countless other recipes on this site and in other sites, but I wanted something that wasn't too sweet, and that was creamy. This is the best of both worlds! Every time I made the other recipes I used to think "Well, I'll eat it because I made it..." But with this one, I'm CRAVING it!!! Thank you very much for your recipe!!! This one will be the one I use whenever I wanna make a Key Lime Pie! :)  Also, I made mine on a pre-made crust and I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, just because I was kind of scared that it wouldn't settle good. It tastes awesome after baking it! :D
