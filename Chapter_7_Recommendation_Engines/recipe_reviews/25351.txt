Tasty but did not blow my socks off.  First, I used 10 med size potatoes and although I followed the recipe regarding the cheese/milk/soup mix, I only poured about 3/4 over all...I could tell that there would be excess of sauce.  Sure enough, when I served, I let it sit 10 minutes before serving hoping that the cheese would thicken, but it was still very runny.  Now, I am a cheese lover...I mean cheese tops almost everything in our house, esspecially potatoes but after this cheesy meal, I have had my fill of cheese to last a week.  IF I make again, I will use more potatoes (or larger ones), use 1 can of soup, half the milk, half the processed cheese and less sour cream.

Incredibly delicious!  Instead of placing the mixture into a baking dish and then into the oven, I put it in my large crock pot and keep it warm that way.  It's great for potlucks & family gatherings and more "gourmet" than scalloped potatoes!  It's always a hit wherever I bring it.

These were great!  I used garlic & onion powders instead of the minced onion (just lazy that night) and sprinkled dried onion rings on the top.  I didn't use quite as much sour cream & didn't measure the cheddar cheese (just sprinkled until the top was covered).  It was even better warmed up a few nights later!!!

Yummy!!!  I even made this a little easier by using a bag of Simply Potatoes (for every 5 servings), which are diced uncooked potatoes with onion.  The disadvantage is that since that means you also skip the step where the potatoes are cooked, they end up not being quite as tender as they could be.  Maybe there is a solution for that.  But for busy working moms, it still turned out very tasty and pretty quick!

i only had 1 can of cheddar so i used that & 1 can cream of mushroom, i used 3/4 c milk and only 1/2 lb "processed cheese" and this recipe was STILL entirely too artificial cheese tasting. "dotting" the butter on top, when you take the potatoes out of the oven the grease runs everywhere its EXTREMELY unattractive. this recipe needs alot of doctoring, its a heart attack in a pan.

Another five star recipe on Allrecipes.com.   Is this a great website or what?  These potatoes are excellent.  Very quick, very easy, and very tasty.  I boiled the potatoes and then just slashed trough them with a knife while they were still in the pan.  No need to cool them first.  The sauce looked runny, but thickened up while in the oven.  I'll be making this recipe again, and again, and again.

Gourmet INDEED!! These were wonderful. I didn't add the cheese soup because I didn't have any, but they still turned out great. I added crunched bacon and chives on it for the last 10 minutes. This will definitely become a family staple in our house. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

These were good but need a little extra flavor. I may try to add a half package of ranch dressing mix or something. But everyone really liked these, I would reduce the recipe because these weren't  really good for leftovers.

These were pretty good! I tried to halve the recipe, but just guessed with the ammount of potatoes, I think I used 10 small ones. Anyway, this yielded so much that I had to use an 11' by 7' baking dish and was wondering if the whole recipe would have fit into the 9' by 13' ... I also had a little bit of spillage in the oven (not too much though) This taste was nice and my husband said, four stars.  I omitted the onion due to personal preference. Also I sliced my potatoes, scalloped style, instead of cubing them. I liked this recipe and would make it again, seems good to bring to a get together. Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor, very easy to prepare.  I caramelized the onions prior to baking them with the potatoes to give the recipe a sweet flavor, but over all it was a great dish.  Will definitely make again!

I totally altered this recipe but structure was still there.I still used all the same ingredients (no processed cheese), but played around with the portions(barely any milk) and added garlic and Montreal steak spice along with more grated cheddar. You can do alot with this recipe but it gave me the starting point and I recieved nothing but compliments.

OMG these are wicked!  I used a 2 lb. bag of western style  hashbrown potatoes thawed, mixed in the onion and melted butter.  Heated the soup, sour cream and Velveeta on the stove top until creamy.  Poured over the top, stirred and baked covered for 1 hour.  Topped with the cheddar cheese and served.  There were no leftovers to be found.  Next time I will up the onions just for our personal preference.

made 10 servings using 4 pounds of potatoes.  Left out the processed cheese and used 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar.  Only needed to bake in oven for about 45 minutes (perhaps even less).

Very easy to make but the sauce came out a littlt runny and it did not really thicken up upon standing. Everyone raved about the flavor. I will make this again only with less milk and I will not add the butter to the top as directed. It make a lot of extra grease which it did not need.

These are very good and cheesy. I only added 1 c. of sour cream and that seamed to be plenty. I think I only used about 7 pds. of potatoes. Was a nice change.

5 stars on behalf of my husband! I used only 5 pounds of potatoes, I can't imagine using 10! This tastes like a cheesy potato soup. Very good. I served this for Christmas dinner and my guests raved. I boiled the potatoes until done.

I made this for a party to serve 50 people.  It was a  huge hit.  Very easy to make.  

Instead of chopping the cook potatoes, I slightly smashed them with a masher, much easier and less time consuming.  And I didn't have to wait until cool.  I also added a little garlic to the tatos.  And used about 2 cups of cheddar for topping, per pan.

Will use every pot luck, esp. for large groups.. Thanks Donna!

I was going to make this for a family Xmas dinner, but woke up Xmas morning w/ a nasty stomach virus. Had my DH make it, and my brother picked it up to take it to the dinner. Everyone said it was great, but when I tried it the next day (made a double recipe), I thought it was way too rich & had to toss the rest. DH had no clue why everyone said they loved it either, and we have no plans to make it again. **He even left out the butter**

These potatoes are amazing!!!  I would recommend straining the onions and getting MOST of the water out of them before adding them to the dish.  I quadrupled the amount of onions suggested and they added a sweetness and depth of flavor that was needed.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an easy side that makes GREAT leftovers.

Very good!  I used 1 can cheddar cheese soup and 1 can of cream of celery (that is all I had).  Didn't cook my potatoes first just cubed them small and added about 20 min cooking time.  Added crumbled bacon and chives per another review.  Kids devoured this and hubby said it was a keeper!

I didn't give 5 stars sinced i played with the igredients to give the right cheese flavored i was looking for. But it was really good...I ended up with too much cheese sauce. Oh well it was still tasty!

These were delicious! Just what I was looking for. My family couldn't get enough. I halfed the recipe and still filled a 9x13. Thank You.

Excellent recipe!  Everyone raved about it, and wanted more.  I did modify the recipe slightly by cutting the potatoes and onions in thin slices (rather than in chunks/grated), and using somewhat less potatoes and sauce than the recipe called for (as it wouldn't all fit into my 9x13 pan).  I'll definitely be making this again for the holidays.

This is a great recipe! The only thing I did different is I didn't use 10lbs of potatoes-- that seemed like so much! I cooked enough potatoes to fit in a 9x13 pan and it worked fine. It cooked up so nice and super cheesy-- I will definitely be making it again! An instant hit!

These turned out really well even with all the changes made and the mistake. First I halved the recipe (5 servings). I used 4 cans of diced potatoes in place of fresh ones, omitted the onion because I'm allergic, omitted sour cream because we didn't have any, and used mozzarella cheese on top in place of cheddar because that was all we had. Once it was in the oven, I realized I forgot the butter even though it was sitting on the table! (d'oh!) I needed it done in time to serve with dinner, so I raised the temp to 400 and only left it in for about 40 mins. The cheese on top was a bit brown and the potatoes could have been a bit more mushy, but it was still a hit! Hard to mess this one up, love it!! Will definitely make this one again. :-)

I messed up and forgot to buy cheese soup. I used 7 large potatoes and everything but the cheese soup but I added 1 cup of alfredo sauce.I think that's the way to go. It was awesome. Will definately make again.

Took other reviewers' suggestions, used half cream of mushroom soup, cut out butter, added more cheddar cheese on top- delicious!!  My daughter and I made several big trays for a meal donation, had fun dipping pita chips in a side serving of sauce- yum!  Will definitely make again.

My family loves these potatoes. Sometimes add diced cooked bacon.  Extra yummy.

Definately a favorite at our house.  Lost the recipe and was so relieved to be able to come back and find it.  A Christmas hit!
