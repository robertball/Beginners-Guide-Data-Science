OMG- loved this! I had to add a couple of cloves of chopped garlic.  This is like a spicy ranch dressing.  Going to try it as a tortilla chip dip next, with even more cilantro and jalapeno.

Yum! Used it as a mexican vegetable salad dressing, but I am also going to use it as a dip for Indian Naan Bread! I only used 1 1/5 jalepenos, but it needed 2. Also, I think it can do without the worchestershire sauce, and it needed plenty of salt and pepper. Thanks!

My husband & I loved this.  Served it over sliced tomatoes & stirred some into pre-packed coleslaw mix.  Also made the "spicy garlic lime chicken" from this site & we were dipping our chicken in it.  We are trying to decide what we want to eat it with next.  Thank you for the great recipe.  It is such a nice change of pace for a salad dressing.

I have been making this steadily since finding the recipe,and the only thing i have done differently is to not seed one of the jalepenos, it is so good its a great dip, wonderful salad dressing, adds great taste over meats and a great sauce over chicken burritos

This was very good.  I added a clove of garlic to the other ingredients and processed in the blender with about 1/4 cup olive oil, then added only 1/2 cup of light mayo.  Didn't use the sour cream at all.

Love love loe this sauce!!  I used it as a dip for some turkey pinwheels over Christmas and it was AWESOME!  I used 2 jalapenos and white vinegar bc I didnt have white wine but is was super yummy!  Tonight I am grilling chicken breasts and going to use this over them!  We are also excited to try it on fish tacos and grilled salmon!  This is a super easy quick sauce to keep on hand for many different dishes!  THANK YOU!!!

I love cilantro, so I definitely wanted to try this recipe out.  I would say it's average, but I'd definitely try to make it again, but tweak the recipe.  I definitely think there was too much mayo and sour cream.  The jalapeno was a great idea; gave it a tiny bit of a kick.

I only used 1 whole jalapeno .... woo baby!!!  I actually like hot food and I think it had the right amount of heat when put on food. This is a keeper. I sub the mayo with Olive oil and there did not seem to be any difference in flavor.  I think the jalapeno dominated somewhat.

This was a nice light-tasting dressing.  I thinned it a bit with extra lime juice.  Otherwise, it was a great way to use the jalapenos and cilantro in my garden!

This was a delicious dressing!  I cut the recipe in half as there are only two people in our household.  I omitted the worchestershire sauce as others have, and it was still great.  Next time, I'll try using low-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream and see if it'll end up a little thicker for use as a dip.

This was really good!  I did add a garlic clove, but it would've been just as good without it too.  It was an excellent accompaniment to the Morrocan Salmon Patties on this site, and it's fun to see how other reviewers are using it too.  Great recipe...thanks!

I didn't want to rate this recipe just wanted to let you know of an easier way with less ingredients. 1 Cup heavy cream 1 Cup mayonnaise 3 to 4 cloves of garlic, chopped. 3 serrano peppers chopped. 2 to 3 handfuls of cilantro squeeze of lemon or lime juice salt/pepper to taste. Put all ingredients in blender and blend until thoroughly mixed. That's it. I use on fish, vegi dip, tacos just about anything you can think of. Very good

This is an interesting balance of cool and spicy!  This was a great topping for my enchiladas, and I can tell that it would be wonderful on a taco salad as well.  I plan to make this again using plain nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream/mayo as another reviewer suggested.

Yum!  Cut the recipe in half, using one fairly large jalapeno.  It had just the right amount of kick.  Using with a salad but can think of many uses for it - anyplace you would use sour cream on a Mexican dish.

Some major changes for a killer dressing: used Chardonnay instead of white wine vinegar; halved the Worcestershire; only had sliced jalapenos - used six large slices; added a whole avocado; threw in some olive oil; didn't measure the cilantro but I used a lot; no pepper; and about two or three spoonfuls of olive oil mayo for consistency. Blended everything and let it sit overnight. What a great, fresh kick!!

I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of both the sour cream and mayo.  I put the dressing on a salad with cashews, artichoke hearts, and goat cheese.  I ate so fast I made myself sick.  Soo good!

This is a nice, tangy dressing with a kick. I used only one jalapeno because I didn't use the mayo or sour cream, which would have cooled the heat--instead, I blended in half an avocado and then added olive oil until I got the right consistency. I think next time I'll use about half the Worcestershire; it was a bit strong in my version.

I made this orange Cilantro Rice dish tonight for dinner. I recalculated for 2 people just to see if we liked it and it was excellent. Very good flavor. The orange juice gave it a little zip. I would for sure make it for company.

Follwed recipe exactly and this was delicious. Goes nicely as a dressing for the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken also from this site. One warning though, this makes a lot of dressing, will try 1/2 next time.

This was excellent, but I must say I ran out of jalapenos so I just added some chipotle powder and cayenne instead.  I used low fat SC and mayo too.  Served this over a grilled steak salad and it was wonderful.  I can't wait to try it with the fresh jalapenos!

Excellent!!  I did a few adjustments, I didn't seed the jalapeno since we like our food spicy, I added chopped garlic and 1/2 avocado and omitted Worchestershire sauce and salt.  Since it makes quite a bit, we used it as a dip, salad dressing and on mediterranean patties.  Will definitely make it again. One thing, once I take it out of the fridge, it is very watery, still excellent but why is it watery.  Thanks

This is so good.  I used regular white vinegar cuz that's what I had and I just threw in one whole bunch of cilantro.  It came out so good and had a nice kick to it from the jalapenos.  I have used this on salads and also tacos, enchiladas, etc.  One of my new favorite dressings!

This was delicious and made a perfect topping for 'Shrimp and Jalapeno Nachos' from this site. I scaled the recipe back to only make 5 servings, but followed the recipe as written otherwise. This had great flavor, and is a total keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum yum yum! I had a similar recipe years ago, which I lost when we moved, so I was desperately searching for something similar and this is it! I put this on a wonderful steak salad....put lettuce on a plate, put dressing on it, then top with grilled steak, grilled peppers, grilled onions, sliced avocado and a can of black beans that have been marinated in lime juice, oil and cilantro. My husband thanks you, he really missed this salad!

I liked this; however, it tasted a little too mayonaise-y for me...will try to figure out how to rectify that.  I also tried it using a cup of heavy cream instead of the sour cream...still tasted like mayonaise.  Hmmm.

I was hoping this would turn out similar to Trader Joe's Cilantro Dressing (I can't get enough of it!) and it came close. I used two serrano peppers with seeds (I love spicy food) but I could still taste a lot of Worcestershire. I think next time I'd decrease that amount.

A stellar recipe! I followed the recipe closely. The only real change was I only used 1T. of lime juice and added about 3 cloves of fresh chopped garlic. This recipe is so good you will want to lick the bowl clean.

Made it last night for our Taco Salad.  Loved it.  The only changes I made was to add more jalapenos for spice and 1/2 an avacado for more creamyness.  Definate recipie to keep and use over and over.  Husband even said it is new favorite.  Thank you for sharing.

Delicious! I only used one good size jalapeno and it had just the right amount of "kick". This is such a versatile dressing, I use it to drizzle on cucumbers and tomatoes and even used it as a sauce for my spicy crab cakes. If you love cilantro like I do you will love this recipe!

Ever since a trip to Los cabos, cilantro is my favourite herb! This is very Good, although the color is a little unappetizing. Watch it though-it has quite a kick!
