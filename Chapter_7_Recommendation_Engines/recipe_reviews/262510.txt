I used 2 lbs of ground beef, about 1 1/2 lbs of sweet potatoes, a whole head of cauliflower and a 1 lb pkg of frozen mixed vegetables. I adjusted broth and butter because of the "extra", too. A nice change from regular shepherd's pie and I'll fix this again.

The family really liked it. I used three yams and half a head of cauliflower for the top. Had leftover tasty pulled pork that I used instead of the ground beef so was able to skip the tomato paste. My kid says he hates cauliflower so I didn't tell him about it until after he devoured it! Next time I will try it with more garlic and maybe some brussel sprouts too.

Loved it. Used ghee instead of butter and omitted the cheese. Used all sweet potato. Used frozen corn and peas cause that was all I had. Was tastier than I anticipated!  Recommend trying ghee if you can I like the flavor. Next time will try with another fat.

I added 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp thyme and a bay leaf to the carrot and meat mixture to give the filling a little flavor.
I added a little more butter to the sweet potato/cauliflower mix.
I also added the tomato paste before the broth, cooking It with the beef, carrots, onions and seasoning. That helps to season the mixture and removes that 'tinny' flavor that tomato paste can have. It turned out really good.

This was a hit!  
I made it per the recipe (although I'm really not much of a measurer!)...  
The serving dish was scraped clean!
