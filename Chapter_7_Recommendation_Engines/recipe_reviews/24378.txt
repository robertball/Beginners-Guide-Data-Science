This is a wonderful salad!  Would someone, please, comment on the amount of grapes they used in this salad?  Did they use 4 pounds, or 4 cups?  Four pounds would be about 8 cups.  Remember "A pint's a pound the world around".  Our local price of grapes, yesterday was $2.99 per pound.  That really adds up for a salad that only serves 8!

I don't get it!?  Maybe I did something wrong.  I thought this salad  was terrible and looked awful.  I keep thinking I must have made some terrible error because it was rated so high.

This is the best grape salad. I use red and green grapes. Letting it chill overnight, then adding the nuts before serving is the key!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser!  I modified it by using both green & red grapes and by sprinkling the brown sugar and nuts over the top and melting the sugar under the broiler for 30-60 seconds for a crispy topping.  I brought it to a potluck at work and EVERYONE begged for the recipe!  It's so different and just fabulous!  It could be breakfast, lunch, a side-dish, or even dessert!  Very yummy!

I got this recipe from a party a few weeks ago and have made it several times since!  This weekend I'm trying it with grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and mand. oranges.  There were a few people who didn't like it.......I can't imagine why????  They must've done something wrong because it's seriously GOOD!  Try the recipe again...maybe you forgot an ingredient, and definitely use a mixer with anything with cream cheese to beat out the "chunks".  Enjoy!

Followed the recipe and got rave reviews at the last neighborhood BBQ.  I used 4 C. of grapes, maybe a few more.  Definitely was not 4 pounds.

After reading the reviews and finding out this recipe makes alot more than 8 servings I scaled the recipe to 2 servings.  I used 2 1/2 cups total of green and purple grapes.  The recipe does not state the cream cheese should be softened at room temperature.  In order to blend with sour cream I did let mine sit out.  I refrigerated 5 hours prior to topping with a sprinkling of brown sugar and diced walnuts and almonds.  I nice variation on using leftover grapes.  However, I think my green grapes were very tart and may use all purple grapes next time.  *UPDATE* I sprinkled a bit more brown sugar and refrigerated overnight...much better flavor the next day!!

I brought this salad to work and everyone LOVED it!  It really doesn't look as good as it tastes, but once everyone tried it they went back for more.  And they all wanted the recipe!

I used green grapes AND red grapes in this recipe. Really added some nice color to it. This recipe is fantastic. Delicious and fool proof. A very nice change. Family and friends all loved it.

I needed something fast and simple for our 4th of July barbecue and this recipe fit the bill perfectly.My mother in law gave an almost identical recipe to me recently that she said was delicious so I thought I would try it.This isn't the best looking salad but it is delicious and very refreshing!And yes...4# of grapes are just the right amount. I didn't have a problem with runniness because I made sure to drain my grapes on towels until absolutely dry.I added 1 cup mild shredded cheddar cheese to the cream cheese mixture and I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 cup finely chopped pecans for the topping(My mother in law's recipe).I refrigerated it for about 8 hrs. and served it in a pretty(12x8x2") clear glass dish.I may try substituting vanilla flavored yogurt for the sour cream next time just to see how that would taste.Also...Layering the grapes with with the cream cheese mixture in a deep glass bowl may make a prettier presentation. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

Absolutely delish! I know this recipe as Grapes Rockefeller without the brown sugar and nuts. The first time I had it, it was made with low-fat sour cream and low-fat cream cheese. Frankly that is the only way I make it since my family loves it! I always make it with red and green grapes for the color contrast. I'm thinking that strawberries, bananas and even blueberries would taste great paired with that yummy 'cheesecake-type' sauce. My teenage boys LOVE this stuff!

This recipe is always a hit! Make sure you dry the grapes and I like to cut them in half. I use green and red grapes. Also, don't mix the brown sugar and nuts into salad. Sprinkle on top and leave it, looks much better!

Very good. Can be very low fat. I used fat free sour cream & cream cheese & used Splenda for sugar.  1 cup equals 1 point for Weight Watchers.

Delicious salad!  Used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. powdered sugar in the dressing instead of all white sugar.  I cut the grapes in half, but remember if you don't eat the salad in one sitting, by cutting them in half will cause the dressing to get a little runny.  I added some Heath Toffee pieces another reviewer had suggested.  This added a great little crunchiness to the salad.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I've brought this to many potlucks and people always ask for the recipe.  People even ask about it months later and want me to bring it to future get togethers.  Plus, it's super easy to whip together the night before.  Try it!

Wonderful for a bridal/baby shower!  I used grapes (green/red/dark purple) and peaches because they were in season.  Peaches and cream = no brainer!  Also, I substituted 3TBSP of honey for the white sugar and it was very yummy!

I've made this grape salad many times over the years and was glad to find it here when a friend asked about it and I'd lost my recipe. This stuff is always a hit with adults and kids, too. I noticed a few reviewers asking about the amount of grapes. Four pounds is correct. That works out to approximately one bag of white grapes and one bag of red grapes if you are using both colors. I would say this recipe makes closer to 16 servings because it's generally served as a brunch or dessert, not a main dish. I've taken it to family dinners where over 15 people were eating, everyone got a few spoonfuls of grapes, and there was plenty leftover for me to bring home :) This could easily be halved to serve fewer people. Definitely dry the grapes well after rinsing them or your salad will be watery. Thanks for posting the recipe!

The first time I had this was at my cousin's baby shower. It was a big hit! When I saw it, it didn't look too appealing but everyone else was raving about it. I finally gave it a try and loved it!! My aunt made it a little different though. She did 1 lb of green grapes and 1 lb of red grapes..she also added 1 can of crushed pineapple and 2 small cans of mandarin oranges (drained). Instead of doing the pecans and brown sugar as a topping we mixed it in. I hope this helps.

This is a regular in my house. I almost always have a bowl of this ready for a quick snack. I've made this recipe as directed and it was great. I've also made it using yogurt cheese and no one could tell the difference. Since yogurt is so good for you I now make it that way. I use fat free plain yogurt and drain (in fridge) in cheescloth lined strainer (in a bowl to catch the liquid) for 6-8 hours. Once it has the consistancy of cream cheese it's ready to use. I also use fat free sour cream. I serve the nuts on individual since 1/2 my family does not like them.

absolutely excellent!! I used 2 1/2 lbs red grapes, and 1 lb strawberries cut up. I also added crushed butterfingers per previous suggestions, but probably would leave out next time. Everyone loved it!!

As written, this is four stars.  I prefer using 2 pounds (yes pounds, not cups) green and 2 pounds red grapes.  I turn it into a 9x13 dish, not a serving bowl.  That way everyone gets some of the brown sugar/pecan mix, which I sprinkle on as a topping before serving.  My brown sugar/pecan mixture is 1/2 - 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup chopped pecans (more than the original recipe because I'm sprinkling on top of a large dish rather than mixing it in.)  Thanks for the recipe!

4 lbs. vs. 4 cups of grapes? I think 4 lbs! I thought I had enough grapes at 4 cups; but there was so much cream cheese mixture at that point, I ended up adding two good-sized chopped apples, two sliced bananas, two cans of drained pineapple chunks and a handful of dried cherries before I decided that was enough.  I'm pretty sure I have enough salad now to feed at least 16 people. Not sure what size my largest Pyrex mixing bowl is that I used, but the next size down says 2.5L. It is still very tasty, although not holding strictly to the "grape salad" title. I might add a little cinnamon to it at this point.

This recipe reads well, but unfortunately, it just isn't all that good.  Maybe with some other fruit in addition to the grapes the salad would be more attractive and tasty -- but as it was, even with a family of grape-lovers, I threw out most of what I made, and won't make it again.

This was really delicious. Took to a family birthday party, and my hubby and I thought we would have some leftovers to bring home, and the family ate the whole bowl.  I should have saved some back for us :-).  Only different thing I did was used salted almonds instead of pecans.  I didn't use all of the cream topping, was too much, but I'll use the rest as fruit dip for what's in the fridge!

What a keeper!  I used a little less grapes and a little less pecans (my son doesn't like nuts).  It turned out great and extended family members went back for seconds and thirds.  I'm glad I made a double batch!  Thanks again!   Beanie J

A REALLY good recipe.  I've made it for family dinners twice now, and everyone really likes it.  I use half red, half green grapes if available because it looks prettier.  The last time I made it, I used walnuts instead of pecans, and it was even better.  A definite keeper in the recipe book.

Wonderful refreshing recipe for hot summer days (& any other time of the year!) It was so easy to prepare well ahead. I used both red and green grapes - so pretty! I took it to a salad luncheon and everyone asked for the recipe. My husband really liked this salad, too. THIS IS A WINNER!

AMAZING!!!  We had a pot luck and someone from work brought this in; after the first bite, I was asking for the recipe!  She made two small changes:  She used red grapes rather than green, and for display purposes, after she sprinkled the brown sugar and pecans, she didn't mix it.  I can't wait to make this for my family!

I try to make this for every party.  I mix red & green grapes for this recipe.  If you make this the day before, I've learned to not add the pecans until you're ready because they don't stay crisp/firm.

Great for parties and get-togethers, but not good for only a few people. Very rich and sweet. A little too simple for me, needed more ingredients. We ate some in small servings (because it was so rich) and the rest went to waste. I would rather just eat a handful of grapes.

Always love making this salad in the warmer months of the year as it is sooo refreshing!  The secret is to make sure the salad is cold when served. I always toast the pecans which brings out that nice nutty flavor.  Sometimes, I use all green grapes and sometimes I combine red and green.  I make the night before and toss prior to serving.  Always well received and enjoyed.

Wonderful!! Would not change a thing. Took this to a shower Sunday, and it was the definite hit of the party! People were practically licking the bowl when it was empty. I put it in a pampered chef chillzane bowl(one that you freeze and it keeps stuff cold), and left it in the freezer for about an hour before serving. I think this made it even better.

This had a really good taste, but mine came out too thick and it was hard to mix together.  I did beat the cream cheese, etc to make it smoother.  I also added a can of mandarin oranges and a bit of the juice to make the cream cheese mixture a little thinner.

I found this a bit too sweet.  Loved the brown sugar, but would leave out the white sugar.  I used Low fat cream cheese and fat-free Greek Yoghurt.  I will make it again but with no white sugar.

This salad would perhaps be better with the grapes halved. The filler here is basically the same thing as a brown sugar, cream cheese dip that one uses with apples. Apples, when cut, take on a more porous texture. When making this salad with whole grapes, the cream cheese "filler" just slid around the outer grape skins not making a very natural combination. If you love grapes and you love this kind of "dressing", great.  Combined, not so awesome.

Some reviews said this was not a recipe for men, but I served it as one of the sides at Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! Including the men and kids :) The only change I made was I used 1/3 red grapes, 1/3 green grapes, and 1/3 strawberries. Delicious!

I have made this recipe several times. I have never used brown sugar or pecans. I use white sugar and chopped up milkyway bars. Talk about "yummy"! I plan on adding glazed walnuts this time. I'll report if I get a thumbs up.....

My Great Aunt fixed this for us while she was at our house for a visit.....all I can say is YUMMY!!!!!!  This stuff is so addictive!!!  There were just two things that differ from her recipe....she used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of pecans for the topping....which I think, makes it!!

Excellent recipe! I used fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream, it tasted so good! I will be making this for get togethers.  It is a great way to do something different with grapes and this is so good and guilt free with fat free items!  Yummy! Even my 2 year old liked it..

I make this numerous times throughout the year. I mix green and red grapes. I also cut the grapes in half. I don't really measure them, I just keep adding grapes until the consistency of the cream mixture is where I want it. If you get runny results on the cream mixture, you may have mixed it too much. You don't have to get EVERY chunk of cream cheese out. DELICIOUS!

This is a great recipe.   Here are a couple of helpful suggestions if you like a little variety.

1.  When I make this recipe I use 2 pounds each of read and green grapes.  It really spices up the color.

2. There are several that do not like nuts in my family so I put 1 to 1 and 1/2 cups of crushed pretzles on the top instead of the nuts and brown sugar.   It still is a great hit and it does cut the cost down a bit.  (I use my food processor to chop the pretzles into a chunkie powder).

People love it when I bring this to the church socials.

I used red grapes, splenda instead of white sugar and topped with crushed Butterfinger bars (3) with 1/4 c. brown sugar mixed with them.  Put in a trifle bowl for a fun presentation and gave the recipe away.  Delicious for summer!

This was a big hit a pot luck.  I only used 1 lb of red seedless graps and added 1 can drained fruit cocktail and sliced bananas. Put the chopped nuts in a bolw on the side as an option.  I've made the cream cheese, sour cream & brown sugar as a dip for strawberries. Enjoy.

I have just made this for a baby shower, and tasted it. Wow!  Very, very tasty and pretty.  I used half green and half red grapes. Mixed my wet ingredients with the mixer, and stirred in grapes by hand.  I did not add the additional brown sugar on top, as it was plenty sweet for me, but just sprinkled with the pecans. Easy, pretty, and tasty.  Can't wait to see what my guests think!

I used a full 4 lbs (8 cups) of both green and red seedless grapes and it turned out perfect.  Only thing I will do different next time is soften the cream cheese more, like almost melt it.  Because I ended up with little cream cheese chunks, it tasted fine still, just did not look appetizing.

This is so good.  I have yet to meet anyone who didn't like it.  I have added apples for a little something different and I have made it without the nuts( my kids don't like nuts)  It was great either way.  A friend made it with the Splenda brown sugar and I couldn't tell a difference.  Very quick and easy great on a hot Summer day.

Made this for a party this past weekend, everyone loved it. They all wanted the recipe. So simple to make, took less than ten minutes and then put in the fridge for two hours before serving. Will definitely be making a lot more in the future.

I used 1 cup of powdered sugar instead of the regular sugar, it mixes much nicer together.I also mix different colors of grapes, very pretty. It is a hit where ever I take it.

I mixed red and green for some color and added crushed butterfinger since not everyone in the family is a fan of nuts-the bowl was scraped clean. Very good!

Wow, I am amazed that such simple ingredients produce a salad so delicious! I put it together this afternoon for a brunch tomorrow and if I keep sampling it, there won't be any left by then. Instead of pecans I used toasted hazelnuts and mixed them with a few more tablespoons of brown sugar and sprinkled them over the top rather than mixing them in so they would retain more crunch. I used almost exactly 4 pounds of grapes. Half red, half green. There is plenty of dressing, you could probably increase the grapes by another pound, but it's a huge bowl full as it is. I will probably wait till summer to make it again, it was expensive in December!

Excellent dessert.. I made it with Red Grapes and it is just as good as with green ones. Next time though I would put in a bit less white sugar as it is quit sweet otherwise add more grapes..

I had my reservations...not that it would taste bad but nothing that was going to "WOW" me. Surprise surprise lol. I think it was the brown sugar and the pecans that gave it that extra something. If it wasn't added in or even blended all together (instead of like a topping) it would've been "blah". This is definitely a saved recipe and will make again. Oh and I didn't make any tweaks...followed the recipe but I can totally add to it like maybe pineapples or something.

This salad is a hit every time.  I use half green and half red grapes.  I use a hand mixer for the cream cheese mixture just to there aren't any lumps.  I add the mixture to the grapes leaving some in the bowl until I get the amount of coating that I like.  I put mine in a shallow dish overnight with the brown sugar on top. I do not add the pecans until im ready to serve.

Love this salad!  I made it the first time for a family reunion and it was a big hit.  Since then, I took it to work and they loved it. I  just made it again, only this time I added fresh strawberries, and fresh pineapple, and used walnuts instead of pecans.

I didn't drain the grapes, so it was a little runny.  I think if I would have completely dried the grapes, it would have turned out better.  Hopefully it will have a thicker sauce next time.

So good!!  Made to give to friend's family and liked it so much, made it again for church picnic.  I cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup the second time and was out of pecans so used walnuts.  Also used lo-fat cream cheese.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!  If there are any leftovers, it's great for breakfast with granola.

Love this salad, great for summer.  I substitute splenda for the white sugar and it still tastes wonderful.  Made it for Fourth of July, cool, tasty, and not your typical salad.

My family LOVES this salad.  I have also made it in the fall using apples, but keep in mind that if it is not all eatten the first day, it gets runny with the chopped apples.  We always at least double the topping!  But I have made it with low fat and fat free sour cream and cream cheese with wonderful results.  The Emerald Pecan Pie glazed pecans in the bag are AWESOME on this!

I was really looking forward to trying this.  After making it,  I thought that 1 tsp of vanilla was  too much.  I will try this again - without any vanilla.

Love this salad. My mother in law made it for us the first time. Have made it many times since, The only thing that will ruin it is if your grapes aren't sweet. Taste one before u buy them to male sure they r sweet, a sour grape will take away from the overall flavor. Other than that, u can't go wrong with this recipe.

I was looking for a fruity kind of dessert and ran across this recipe .  It was great!! I had to make it for a work function so I needed a lot.  I added red grapes, mandarin oranges, and maracino(sp.) cherries for a little more color and it was a hit!!  I also used glazed pecans!! That made it even better!  Thank you!!

We tried using Stevia instead of white sugar and it was great! We started with one packet and added just a little at a time until we reached the level of sweetness we wanted.  My kids LOVE this recipe. We also used 1/2 green and 1/2 red grapes.

I have made this grape salad about 20 times now....and I use 4 cups....not 4 lbs. of grapes.  I also use an electric mixer to fluff the cream cheese and the sour cream.  Make sure you DRY the grapes...I wonder if that's what the one person did wrong that said hers didn't come out well.  That's the only way to mess this up!  Toasted pecans and brown sugar on top makes it really special...everyone I've served it to loves it....it's really a light dessert...not a salad!  Enjoy!  Makes a great pot luck dish.  AND...it will keep overnight in the refrig. perfectly.

I made this recipe for my Bunco group (16 babes)and everyone loved it! It's so easy to make it reduced fat and also sugar-free and it still taste wonderful. Yes, you really do use 4 lbs. of grapes and it serves a lot more then 8.

Maybe there were too many rave reviews - I was expecting a better tasting salad. I was too sweet for me (I would add less sugar if I did it agin)and the grapes didn't offer enough of a contrast or complement in taste. It was actually better with strawberries!

Another vote for a 20 star rating!  The first words out of my mouth when I tasted this were "OH...MY...GOD"  Yep, this is, without a doubt, crack salad, as another reviewer fondly termed it.  Oh, by the way, I used nonfat sour cream and 1/3 less fat cream cheese without compromising any flavor.  I opted not to use nuts.  Now, off to buy more grapes. :)

I've made this numerous times but I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup sugar.  I also use 3 pounds of red grapes instead of the green grapes. (The red are a little larger than the green). I also did not mix the brown sugar and nuts into the recipe I just sprinkled the brown sugar and pecans on top of the grape mixture.  This is a wonderful recipe and I always get asked for the recipe when ever I bring it to a pot luck. Thanks Noreen for submitting this recipe...it's a keeper!

Instead of all green grapes I used 75% red grapes.  I also added 1 red apple and 1 green apple to enhace the taste.  I haven't had any complaints yet. My only complaint is it's all gone.

Everyone loved this every time I've made it. This will be a keeper for years to come. Make sure that you beat the cream cheese with the other ingredients otherwise it's very lumpy and unattractive looking. I used walnuts instead of pecans. Still awesome!

Made the plain and simple version of this salad and it was an enormous hit!  No nuts, no added topping of brown sugar.  Not necessary, but believe it would definitely be a nice touch!  I used Midnight Beauty grapes (very dark purple) and they stole the show on our table!

I have made this, what I do is add red grapes, coconut, a 13.5 oz can of pineapple chunks or tidbits (depending on size of grapes ) & I omit the brown sugar. I find the fruit sweet enough. By adding this extra, it just makes the recipe stretch further. Tastes great !! Enjoy :)

I did not do the brown sugar or Pecans. Instead I used 1/2-3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.
I also use red or green grapes.

We have been making this for several years now after having had it at a local restaurant.  We use both green and red grapes and drop the pecans in favor of crushed butterfinger candy bars.   Unusual but delicious.

This was very very tasty! What I did different was toast the pecans in the oven & put a generous amount of them & the brown sugar(I actually covered the top of the bowl with both & it made a nice presentation) on the top just before serving. A big hit with everyone!

I've made this several times with red grapes...  SO GOOD!  I just made it this morning and was too impatient to let the cream cheese soften first like I normally do...  Now, after pulling out the electric mixer and beating it for awhile, the bumpy texture still isn't gone.  Lesson learned:  make sure you soften your cream cheese first to make sure your texture is smooth!

I first had this salad at Thanksgiving last week and loved it!  Just had to make it as soon as I got home.  The only change I made is that I doubled the amount of brown sugar.  This recipe is incredibly easy and so so soooo delicious!

I don't like sour cream or cream cheese but this was so good!  I took it to a church potluck tonight and only had 3 lone grapes left!  The only things I changed were that I used red grapes and topped it with 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup chopped pecans, mixed together.  Yummy! ALSO, always whip or beat the cream cheese by itself first, until smooth. Then add other ing. Otherwise, you might have lumps of cream cheese that don't mix with the other ing.

This is one of my all time recipes. I usually use 1/2 c brown sugar with 1/4 c nuts and put 1/2 of that mixture in with the cream cheese mixture and then finish it off with using the rest of it on top.  Try it, you'll like it!

This is a very refreshing and delicious salad. I used approximately 12 cups of grapes, but that is to my preference (I prefer salads that are not drenched in creamy dressing). With this amount, there was still lots of dressing and my guests raved. The great thing about this recipe is that you can add more grapes if you find there is too much dressing.

When I made this recipe the first time, I didn't have a whole package of cream cheese, so I used about a half package (4 oz.) and the dressing was more like a real dressing.  This time I had a whole package and used it all and dressing was very stiff and truthfully didn't taste as good as the first time.  Next time, I will use less cream cheese to have more of a real dressing.  I also used light cream cheese and sour cream, splenda and splenda brown sugar.

Excellent salad. I had this at a holiday function and immediately logged on to find the recipe. 4lbs is incorrect. I used 4 cups of grapes but you can just add more or less if you choose. I mix the pecans and brown sugar together and then sprinkle both on top. There is already white sugar in the sour cream mixture. The brown sugar/pecans on top gives it a streusel like topping. We make this whenever red grapes go on sale since they seem to be sweeter than green.

This salad was delicious to me and my guest. I changed the recipe a little. I used black seedless grapes and added a cup and half of finely chopped pecans. I think it turned out good. I will certainly be using this recipe again. One thing to keep in mind is that the grapes color will start to bleed in after a couple of days. It still taste delicious.

This is the best grape salad I have tried.  It is especially good with the large black grapes (cut them in half).  The trick is not to mix the chopped pecans and brown sugar into the mixture, leave it on top.

Divine.  Creamy and decadent...yet refreshing and light.  Can't beat that!  Be sure to beat your cream cheese before mixing with the sour cream to keep the creamy texture.  I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream, and would never miss the extra richness that regular might provide.  From 3 year olds to 63 year olds.. my family gobbled this up!

SO GOOD!! WOW!! I was really impressed by this salad and my dinner guests were also. The only change I made was using half red and half green grapes. Will make many more times.

Very nice; very rich.  I added sliced strawberries with green & red grapes.  Tastes sort of like a creamy cheesecake without the crust.

I can't say THANK YOU for this recipe enough times!!  I live in Australia & at the moment grapes are selling for $2 for over 20 lbs. at the markets & not being able to pass up a good bargain I picked up a case & was just instructing my partner to take some to work & didn't care what he did with them.....just don't bring them back into the house...lol.  Made these once and now I want all those grapes back!

I made this for a party and everyone enjoyed it.  I had some left over and my family couldn't stop eating it!  The only thing I did a little different was that I added extra brown sugar on the top.  Great recipe.

I reduced this recipe greatly because I only wanted to make a small sample. Perhaps something happened in the translation. Last night, I thought it might turn out well but today, it is blah. The flavors aren't very substantial. I might make it another time but as of right now, I doubt it.

WOW!!  Was just browsing recipes to find some to try "later".  I saw this recipe and happened to have just purchased a large bunch of green grapes last night - so seeing that it only required a few, basic ingredients that I had on hand, I just went out and whipped it up (took me about 4 minutes total).  It's refrigerating now, but I find that I keep telling myself that I have to have "just one more little taste" to make sure it's turning out well...hehe - it sure is!  ;-)

Every time I make this it is a big hit!  I do use half green and half red grapes.  I also use my mixer to mix the cream cheese and sour cream together, it just gives it a smoother texture.

Great flavor, I just had trouble getting the cream cheese and sour cream smooth.  Next time I will use a Mixer.  I made with fat free sour cream and low fax cream cheese.

The first time I tried this dish was at a church function. That dish turned out a little better than mine. I really don't know how many grapes I used, but my husband kept saying add more the cream is too thick. I also used all low-fat ingredients. I think it is different and a good dessert.

I've been making this for years and EVERYONE that has eaten it, LOVES IT!! I like the grapes only lightly coated in the cream mixture, so I use about 6 pounds of grapes...a mixture of green and red. Make sure the cream cheese is room temp, otherwise there will be lumps in the mixture. I put the brown sugar/crushed pecan mixture on top directly before serving, but it's still ok if you don't. I make extra and keep in a ziplock baggie.

I like to try a recipe as posted before I tweak it.  This is very nice for an easy pot luck contribution.  I use half as much sugar and toast the pecans and only sprinkle them on just before eating or keep to the side in a dish if a guest has a nut allergy.  The sauce freezes well, so I buy only one bunch of grapes and use half the sauce if I'm not feeding a group.

I altered the recipe and liked it so much better. I used 1 cup plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I used 1/2 cup Brown sugar instead of the white(don't use the extra 2 tbsp brown sugar at the end of the recipe) and used red grapes only, as they have more flavor than the green. Instead of the pecans I used toffee bits (found in the choc chip aisle.) The rest of the recipe I left the same. I always make it this way now and it gets raves wherever I bring it...Try it and I think you will like it better too. LoveToCook

I love this recipe, too, but agree that it doesn't look all that appetizing.  What I do instead is to make it as a dip and serve the grapes (and apple slices are good, too) separately.

The "sauce" (sour cream and cream cheese)is sooo good, it's almost addictive.  I get raves each time I serve it.  Our church is having a special dinner this week and my pastor requested I bring my grape salad.

This recipe was completely not what I expected. It kind of reminded me of a better quality, much less sweet version of apple and other fruit type salads with boxed pudding and whipped topping. Its almost like grapes in a light cheesecake coating. I made 1/4 of the recipe and got 4 large servings. With grapes at 4.00 dollars a pound, I decided to test the recipe with that much first. Have a hand blender ready, because it will be necessary to make the filling smooth before adding the grapes. If grapes become cheaper I would consider this for a summer pot luck, but would definitely add a little more chopped pecans to the top. They add extra flavor, texture, and a nice simple garnish.

I have been making this for a few years & it never fails to get RAVES!!  I use whatever seedless grapes are on sale...a mix of black, red & green is wonderful!!  After grapes are dry, I mix All of the ingredients together, stir in grapes & you are done!!  I have also used all dark brown sugar (no white)...yummy!!  Use at least 1 cup of pecans or walnuts!!

This is such a fabulous and refreshing summer salad.  It's great for family BBQs and my kids love it.  I use 1 1/2 lbs of green grapes and 1 1/2 lbs of red grapes.  Taste them in the store when buying so you don't end up with a salad full of sour grapes.   Leaving the cream cheese out to get soft is a must, or you will end up with lumps.  I only add a tiny bit of brown sugar and sliced almonds to the top as garnish, as the topping is a little too sweet for my taste.  It does feed more than 8 people, which is great for potlucks.

Yummy and very refreshing. I served it with a Mexican-themed dinner and it was the perfect balance to the spicy and heavier Mexican dishes.

I made it with 1 lb red and 1 lb green grapes, but i mostly use just 2 lbs of red grapes;8 oz sour cream; 8 oz cream cheese; 1 tsp vanilla; 1/4 c white sugar; 1/2 c brown sugar; 1 c chopped pecans.  Place grapes in a large bowl, pour cr cheese/1/4 c br sugar/1/4 c white sugar/vanilla/1/2 c chopped nuts mixture and blend well. Sprinkle remaining brown sugar & nuts over top of mixture and refrigerate.  This also serves more than 8 people cause it is so rich and DELICIOUS!

Awesome recipe! Everyone loves this. If you take this to a gathering make sure you have extra copies of the recipe. After washing the 4 pounds of grapes I used a salad spinner to dry them. Note to self - After washing green grapes and drying them in a salad spinner, do not open the salad spinner while it's still spinning. The grapes will fly out like missiles and bounce around like silly putty.

I love this salad. I use red grapes and instead of sourcream I started using vanilla greek yogurt and reduced the white sugar to a couple tablespoons. I think the vanilla yogurt gave it some sweetness.  The topping I stuck with.

GREAT!!! Recipe  SELEA- I used 4 cups and then halved the rest of the ingredients. I weighed the 4C. and they weighed about 2 pounds. Which was plenty for me at one time but I'm single and my children are all grown married and on their own. If I made it for a pot luck or family dinner I would make the whole recipe because it is so good and I know it would take it for a group of people.

My family loves this recipe using low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream!  I do bring the cream cheese to room temperature so it is creamy when everything is mixed.  I think I added more of both sugars bcuz I had sour green grapes but the purple grapes I added were such a nice complement as another reviewer suggested. This is a wonderful and quick dessert.  Thank you!

Loved this recipe!  Although, if I made it again, I'd probably add some red grapes, as well as other kinds of fruit into it to make it more of a fruit salad and give it more appeal to the eye.  I halved the recipe and used about 2 lbs. of grapes.

I love this recipe but I have tweaked it a little bit.  I use 2 lbs green and 2 lbs red grapes. For the topping, instead of pecans I use toffee bits like Heath bits.  AMAZING!!!

This was a nice and light dessert/salad option, perfect for potlucks, grill-outs, etc.  I think next time I'm going to cut the grapes in half: its a little difficult chasing the grapes around on your plate with a fork when they're whole, and I think cutting them in half will allow for a more balanced mix of grape and delicious whipped topping.

I love this dessert!  My grapes are always a little sour so I add some chopped apple and it balances it out perfectly.  This is favorite dish to take to BBQs.

Try melting 3-4 pats of butter and cooking the brown sugar and some of the pecans in it before mixing in the salad.  Makes a world of difference.

More of a 4.5 stars- really good.  I used a mix of red and green grapes.  Cut lots of calories by using fat free sour cream, a mix of half fat free cream cheese/half light cream cheese, and splenda.  I mixed the pecans with splenda brown sugar and just mixed in each serving because I afraid it would get kinda of gooey/soggy just sitting in the salad.  Will make again- the whole fam really liked it.  Not so sure it would be party worthy with all the other great fruit salad recipes out there but it is really good.

Love this recipe.  A healthy version would be to use low fat cream cheese and then vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream, sugar and vanilla.  I also added some chopped apples.  Enjoy!

I have made this several times, and it is SO DELICIOUS!!!  I wanted to tell you DONT be afraid to substitute ingredients.  I was craving this treat but had only half a block (4oz) of cream cheese, and light sourcream.  I used these, PLUS 4oz of Brummel and Brown Strawberry spread.  This is delicious, and a tiny bit healthier using the light sour cream.  You can't even tell the difference!  Walnuts taste great instead of pecans as well!

I used a mixture of red and green grapes, and also diced up apples (the pre-sliced packaged ones that don't turn brown). I didn't add the brown sugar, I thought it was sweet enough without. Very good, will make again & again!

This is a 5-star recipe for sure. I have been making it for years and it is always a hit. The only change I make is to use 2 lb. green grapes and 2 lb. seedless red grapes. Makes it much more colorful and red and green with the white look very pretty on a holiday buffet table.

I made this recipe as written.  Next time I will cut a little sugar from the sour cream/cream cheese mixture and possible cut down the amount of "sauce" because it was quite "saucy".  These modifications are just my personal and family's preference - the recipe is wonderful as written!  I did use green and red seedless grapes...and will again.

So delicious and refreshing!  My neighbor had me over for a make-up party last night and this was one of her desserts.  So of course I came here, first thing today, to find the recipe.  This has all the ingredients she mentioned.  Can't wait to make it for a Memorial Day party!

This is a crowd pleaser!  Everyone always asks me for recipe and it is soooo simple to make.  I prefer to use only red seedless grapes and i candy my pecans before adding to the salad.  Even better the day after!

Love this salad! Have made it a couple of times now and my husband and son really enjoyed it as well. I used 2 pounds of grapes and cut everything in half. Thought this might also be great with strawberries instead of grapes, and almonds instead of pecans. I will try it this way next time! Great and easy recipe...Thanks!

Quick fast and easy. Next time, I would more likely decrease the sour cream by half and increase the cream cheese. Served with pasta saldad, "Barbeque Ribs," and "Roasted New Potatoes."

This salad is awesome! My whole family loves it. My ten year old makes this recipe herself now. I would also reccomend roating almonds instead of pecans.

A friend of mind recently served seedless green grape salad when she hosted a canasta party.  It was so good that I asked for her recipe.  Her recipe was the same as this one, except hers calls for three pounds of grapes instead of four.  I made the recipe when I hosted a canasta party.  My husband ate the small amount of left-over salad and declared it one of the best things he'd ever eaten.

I use 1/2 cup splenda and NO brown sugar. I also add about 1 cup of pecans.  This is a hit where ever I take it!

I was at a get-together and someone brought this recipe- it was great! I also made it a few days ago, but I made a stupid mistake, one that I should have known better about- make sure to use a mixer for this. I didn't feel like dirtying mine, but it had a weird chunky texture then. Done correctly, this is a great recipe!

Good recipe. I thought it was really sweet though. I may use the powdered sugar idea next time. And I cut my grapes in half to take the bulk out. Everyone liked.

We make this salad in the summer, always to rave reviews. A couple things to do differently is to use 2 lbs green 2 lbs red grapes and to cut the grapes in half.. much easier to eat. Also, use 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar with the pecans and press into the top of the grapes in a flat dish to seal and make up the day before. It is great as a leftover and awesome sweet end to the meal.

This dish is soooo delicious!  I made it with 8 cups of grapes, a mixture of green and red.  I sprinkled about a cup of brown sugar and toasted pecans on top and did not mix.  It was the biggest hit of all the food at our Cub Scout lunch today.

A sweet and refreshing side dish or light dessert.  It's wonderful with any fruit.  Soft fruits will fall apart, any crisp fruit will work fine.  Great recipe!

I have made this several times...  but I never really follow all the steps...  I mix the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar (Splenda), and vanilla together and just use this as a dip for any fruit I have.  This makes the best tasting fruit dip ever, and since I don't stir in the fruit, it looks a little prettier having the dip in a bowl and fresh fruit all around.  Can top the dip with the brown sugar and chopped pecans or leave it off.  Either way, it tastes great.

I've been keeping this in the house everyday since I first made it in July! I swear, we eat it everyday! I take it to every club meeting, party, potluck...you name it and get kudos everytime. The only things I do differently are mixing the brown sugar in with the base, and I use green, red and black grapes to make it look more interesting. It's GREAT!

I really love this easy salad. I use half red seedless grapes & half green seedless grapes. I also layer the salad starting with a layer of grapes & topping off with the cream cheese mixture sprinkled with brown sugar & pecans.

I made this salad again this wkend & added fresh blueberries. Wow! It was fantastic!

I modifed this recipe slightly. In my recipe, I use 16 cups of bite sized fruit.  I've used any combination of green & red grapes, blueberries, strawberries, red & black raspberries.  Wonderful everytime and perfect to use up a little bit of this and that kind of fruit!  Don't use Kiwi though, spoils the taste somehow.  Perfect everytime recipe though!

I'm the only one who like this!  If you've bought too many grapes - this recipe is a good way to get rid of them.  Keeps in the fridge for a few days after it's made.

This is very similar to a recipe a co-worker gave me.  The only difference is I use 2 lbs. red and 2 lbs. green grapes.  I also just sprinkle the brown sugar and pecans on the top.  My entire family loves it and makes me bring it every Easter.  It's one of my favorite side dishes.

Delicious and so easy! Takes just a few minutes and it's ready to eat.  I've had so many requests for the recipe.  I leave out the nuts.  Perfect for a bridal or baby shower dish!

This recipe is great and refreshing.  I have made it at least two dozen times.  It is always the requested dish at get togethers.  It is also the most requested recipe.  Great!  Thank you!  I have even tried alternatives such as all red grapes and walnuts instead of pecans - delicious!

I made this for a camping salad without the nuts.   It was excellent and everyone loved it.   This recipe makes a bunch and it was still good the next day.   I have one green grape hater in the family that thinks that red grapes would be better.   I may try that next time.

I made it without the topping.  I like to cut my grapes in half, so I don't mix it all together at once because the juice makes it runny.  I make individual servings, just spooning some over my grapes.  I like to eat it on crackers!

It is 4 pounds of grapes. I use 2 red and 2 green. I also use 1 cup of brown sugar total instead of white and use 1 bag of candied pecans.  So yummy!!!

I'm taking it to a July 4 picnic, and wanted it to be appealing. Layer it!  I made the filling as directed and set it aside. I separated the grapes by color, placing a layer of red grapes on the bottom, then 1/2 the cream cheese mixture, sprinkled generously with chopped roasted pecans. Next, the green grapes, the remaining cream cheese mixture, and topped again with pecans. It will taste the same, but have a different presentation.

I'm all about hiding healthy things in unhealthy meals, haha! This was great. Like others I also mixed red and green grapes for more dynamic colour. I skipped the pecans, only because I didn't have any. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. They're virtually the same thing I guess. An easy sweet treat, especially for the summer backyard bbq or a picnic.

I make this a lot for parties. Everyone asks for the recipe.It is so unique that a t first people are asking what is it? When they are eating it, they are glad they tried it. The brown sugar gives it a caramel flavor. I use green, red, and black grapes together when I can find all three!!

I was asked to bring a fruit salad to a birthday party, and just didn't have the energy to put a lot of work into one.  This recipe was not only EASY PEASY, but it was so delicious!  I used both green and purple grapes which worked out well since the green were a bit tart.  I do suggest putting the nuts in as late as possible as they do get a little soft.  Everyone loved it, from small childen to slightly enebriated adults!

There's just the two of us at home now, so I decided to prepare the grapes and the sauce separately, and just take the grapes we will use at that meal and mix the amount of sauce we like into that.  Found there is no waste that way..........love this stuff, and have been known to sneak some for breakfast !!!  Also, don't omit the brown sugar as it really makes this recipe great .

I made a few alterations that turned this from great to heavenly!  Toss pecans into a butter & brown sugared  caramelized frying pan. On med-high heat, toss & fry until candied. Cool COMPLETELY.  Cut 1/2 of grapes in 1/2.  Replace white sugar with 1/2 can of condensed sweetened milk, still add brown sugar  that original recipe called for, add candied pecans(reserving small amount for garnish), fold together and refrigerate overnight.  This recipe has now turned into a ten star dessert!

This is the best grape salad I have ever had! It has been a huge hit when served in very different settings, everything from a children's birthday party to a church pot luck.  Not one grape came home, ever!  Even psople who normally don't like grapes went back for seconds and wanted the recipe.  I have used a variety of grapes in this and I like primarily mixing them just to add a bit of color to the mix.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe I will continue to go back to over and over again.

I really do not believe the brown sugar is unnecessary.
Try it without and toast the pecans.(try walnuts)
You can also peel and chop up a sweet apple.

This recipe is AMAZING! the only thing I did differently was to break up a bag of pretzels and toss with a half cup of sugar and a half cup of melted butter. Spread the pretzel mixture out on a cookie sheet and bake for about 10 minutes to toast my broken pretzels. Then I layered my pretzel mixture and salad (3 or 4 layers of each) in a trifle bowl. I also used both red and green grapes. It was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving this year!

Since I had tons of grapes, I searched AR for an interesting recipe to use them up and decided to try this for a party. Everyone at the party loved it. I did cut down on the sugar since grapes are so sweet and added a tablespoon of vanilla yogurt. The hostess asked if she could have the small amount of left over salad. I will definitely make it again.

It was the greatest salad I ever had...she caramelized silvered almonds with granola.  Let it cool on a cookie sheet then she crumbed it in the salad...YUMMM...I will make it with less sugar as it is a bit sweet.

This is a great salad. I always get rave reviews when I make it.  I use 2 pounds of grapes and powdered sugar instead of regular sugar. ---Kat

I use red grapes sometimes and I use splenda white and brown sugar and low fat sour cream and cream cheese to make it diet friendly and you can't tell the difference.  It is more like a dessert than salad.

I love this recipe and get rave reviews every time I take it to pot lucks or events.  I am careful about using the nuts on top because so many people have allergies, but it is just as delicious with just the brown sugar topping.

Most definitely a 5-star recipe.  I made it using fat free ingredients and splenda , so delicious.  This is only 1 point on Weight Watchers which makes it a real treat for people like me who like sweets.

Very good!  I used green and red grapes for more color.  Also I made it a little bit healthier by using fat free cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream, Splenda, and skipping the brown sugar.  It was so good the way I made it, though I can just imagine how delicious this recipe would be as written!  I plan on making it again very soon!

This stuff is ridiculous and I mean ridiculously awesome! So easy to make and soooo good.  My fiance said it looks like old people food which is fine because he will stay away from it :D  Like with cheesecake I find only Philly cream cheese works.

Made this for my daughter's graduation at her request and received many compliments on it.  My sister-in-law now makes this whenever we need to bring a dish to a family function.  Yes, you need that many grapes!  Sauce blends better when the cream cheese is a bit warmer.

I had never made this before but was asked to bring it to a party.  Couldn't have been easier!  Used both green and red grapes.  Stirred the brown sugar in at the end and garnished with two small clusters of plain grapes - one red and one green along with toasted chopped walnuts.  Toasting the walnuts really made the flavor pop.  Presentation and taste were awesome!!  Everyone loved this salad!

I have never heard of this salad until a girl I work with brought it too lunch. So I got on here and found this recipe. It is YUMMY!!!! I used the reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. I also used 1/2 green grapes and 1/2 red grapes. The gal I work with had toasted almonds in hers so I used almonds instead. Overall, very good. I will definately keep this recipe. Thanks!

YUM.... My hubby could not get enough of this salad. I didn't weigh/measure the grapes.  I just bought a bag of red and a bag of green grapes that are already in the plastic zipper bags from the grocery store.  I am going to make another batch later in the week to take into work....the guys are going  to love it.

I've been making this Grape Salad for a couple of years now.  EVERY time I make it, I get asked for the recipe!

I have just a few slight revisions:
 - I use only red seedless grapes; the smallest, roundest ones I can find. Green grapes can be more sour, and definitely do not use oblong grapes.
 - I toss the grapes with the sauce and then sprinkle the topping on -  I do not toss again.  This leaves a more "layered" look, rather than all "mushed together".  Better presentation, IMHO.

I halved the recipe and used about 3 cups of grapes.  It tastes FANTASTIC, there is quite a bit of sauce though, so more grapes could be added.  I will definitely make it again!

Yum.  I have had this as a dip for fresh strawberries before, but this is a first for me as a salad dressing. It certainly elevates grapes to a lofty level. Did I say Yum?

just a few tips! to the person without a mixer, I had the same problem but then just used a whisk for a few minutes and it turned out just fine! also for those of you who said it doesn't "look very good." Try a few drops of red food coloring(I usually use red grapes.) I also use almond extract in addition to the vanilla! : )

Very good.  I too used both green and red grapes for eye appeal. Something different to serve up and everyone loved it. I made extra sugar/nuts and then sprinkled the extra over the top for more eye appeal.

This is a great recipe.  I modify it by using light sour cream and light cream cheese.  I also use 1/2 cup of Splenda rather than sugar and Splenda Blend brown sugar.

The sour cream and cream cheese was lumpy but I could have fixed that. The thick creamy high calorie dressing is really overkill for a light fruit salad.

Good dessert. My husband liked this too and said he'd like more variety of fruits next time. My son didn't like this at all. I used an neufchatel cheese instead and an extra ounce since I didn't want to put that little bit back in the fridge. The sauce on it's own would be a great fruit dip. Thanks!

We make a similar salad, however, we use whipped cream cheese and less grapes.  This allows for more of the "creamy".  I don't put on the nuts until serving and don't use brown sugar.  It works great with pecans or walnuts

This grape salad is definitely a big hit at any function! Instead of mixing in the brown sugar, I top the salad with a layer of brown sugar and sprinkle toasted chopped pecans on top of it!  Delicious!

What a great salad.  I love fruit salads and I don't know how I never came across this one.  I used both red and green grapes and it was wonderful.  Thanks...

This has to be one of my favorite salads by far! I didn't put the brown sugar in until shortly before serving it and served crushed pecans on the side (was not aware if any of my guests had allergies). Next time I will serve it with glazed pecans.

This salad is wonderful. My girlfriend makes with different types of grapes (white, green, red) and also adds grape-nuts cereal instead of the pecans. This is also wonderful too. Yum... thanks for sharing!

If I could give this recipe 20 stars I would. I have renamed this crack salad because it's downright addicting, I actually got up at 5am and had a spoonful of this. Three people ate this in two sittings and I bought the stuff to make it again this week. I only had about 3 pounds of grapes and it was a good ratio to the amount of sauce. My only changes are that I added extra vanilla and slivered almonds instead of the pecans ( personal preference). This is an *amazing* recipe. Thanks!!

I haven't made this but had it at my son's baby shower.  It was a mixture of green and red grapes, halved and the brown sugar and pecans were simply sprinkled on top.  It was an absolutely delicious dessert.

This is a definite keeper. I used black seedless grapes and it was great. I've also mixed black and red grapes together and it was just as good. It disappeared in one day. I'll be making it for the holidays as a lighter alternative to pies and cakes.

This was an absolute hit with the family.  I only suggest that you softed the cream cheese to make it easier to mix.  This is still a can't go wrong recipe.  I got plenty of requests for the recipe.

I made this with red grapes, and like imvintage, I halved the recipe. I used sunflower seeds instead of nuts. My mother couldn't stop eating it--I loved it too. The sweetened cream cheese with the burst of grapes is ambrosial. Simple and delicous.

Absolutely the best salad!!  My husband and I are addicted to this easy to prepare and delicious dish.  We prefer red grapes when we can find them, but have used black grapes and a mixture of all three varieties (red, black & green) with great results.  Everyone who tries this salad asks me for the recipe!  YUMMY!!

I made this for two baby showers recently, and it was a hit at both.  The only thing I would change is adding more pecans.  That was the comment I heard the most at the first shower, so for the second, I loaded it with pecans.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

Thanks for such a great recipe.  I needed a quick side dish to take to a gathering and this was perfect.  I used a combination of green and red grapes which I felt made it look a bit more interesting.  I also did not use nuts because I knew if I added them in to the salad that my husband would not touch it.  It still turned out great.  I will make it again.

My son-in-law thought I had sea turtle eggs in the fridge! Love this recipe. My grapes were really sweet so I put 1/2 tsp of lemon juice in the cream cheese mixture to balance the flavors.

This turned out great! I did tweak it a little. Instead of sour cream I used low-fat vanilla yogurt, then omitted the vanilla. I also left out the nuts per my own personal preference. Definitely will be making again! Oh and did I mention, even my picky toddlers ate it!

I enjoyed making the salad including half the topping and letting it set in the refrigerator a day ahead.
The next day it is so great, just add the remaining topping right before serving.
The review comments about it giving it a chance to slightly "carmelize" the grapes were right.

I made this for a pot luck and so did two others but my recipe was asked for the most because I made pecan pralines and chopped them up for the topping instead of the brown sugar and nuts.It was worth the extra steps.

Very good, not too sweet. However, the next time I make this I will reduce the amount of sour cream and cream cheese. It become too thick and heavy of a coating.

I use just 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar. I have also made this with Greek yogurt rather than sour cream; both are delicious. I seldom have much left when I take this to work and family gatherings.

This recipe is always a hit when I make it. I have made this several times, using green and red grapes.
The recipe calls for 4 lbs total grapes.  Not 4 cups or 8 cups.
It is wise to use a scale to measure out the 4 lbs of grapes. Thanks for sharing.

I added 2 chopped apples to the salad and used 2#s red & 2#s green grapes. It makes for a nice texture variety. I did not need to adjust the recipe to accommodate the apples.
Big hit!

Well, this salad looked so good and a great way to use my heavily-bearing grapevine.  But all I taste is cream cheese which is fine in many recipes, but not this one. I'll find a better way to dress the grapes, because I still love the idea of a grape salad.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to use red grapes rather than green grapes.  I ended up being able to use it for leftovers for several days.  A keeper!!!

Honestly, I only tried this because I was in the mood to try something new and had some grapes to use up- I didn't think it sounded particularly great. However, this is DELICIOUS. Next time I'll slice the grapes in half and double the amount of pecans.

This is great at showers or pot lucks. It is a dip/dessert/salad all in one.  I always cut my grapes in half and place on paper towels to remove excess juice before mixing into the sweetened cream cheese.  I dump and spread into a decorative pie dish or quiche dish the day before serving, then add the brown sugar and pecans just before the function begins. Serve with scoop Frito's and dig in.

Someone had brought this salad for a potluck years ago and I had remembered how good it was.  I always have grapes in the house and decided to look up the recipe.  It is very easy to make and is so very good.  I don't really know for sure how many pounds of grapes I used.  I just mixed the ingredients and started putting the grapes in until it looked balanced.  I'd guess around 2.5 pounds or a bit more.  Try this.  If you like grapes, it is just super.  I used Splenda instead of regular sugar and it was really good.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.  You have to make sure you dry the grapes after you wash them.  Otherwise,  it won't turn out very well.  Also, it's best to let it set in refrigerator overnight to let the flavors meld.   Then it will be delicious.

RED grape salad for me! I use super crisp smaller red grapes and follow the other directions to the "T"  I found the addition of the brown sugar helps cut the thickness of the sauce and turns into a smoother creamier concoction.
I got nothing but rave reviews when I share this at parties.

Love to make this recipe as it is so different. We are having a shower at work tomorrow for a coworker and this salad was specifically requested. I use low Fat cream cheese, light sour cream, and Splenda  (about 1/3 c). You really don't need all that sugar the recipe calls for.  I do stick with the brown sugar in the topping. Can't wait to eat it tomorrow!

I've been making this salad for many years. It has become the go-to dish for covered dish meals, etc. for several of the ladies in my family. Recently, my cousin brought some to a funeral meal, and she had added miniature marshmallows. I didn't think "Grapes Rockefeller" could be made  any better, but her version was swoon-worthy! So, now that's my new recipe too. Add 1/2 to a whole bag of mini marshmallows, refrigerator overnight, and enjoy!

I made the full recipe for a July 4 party. Big hit! 3-10-2017 I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings (for 2 people) and still had some leftover. I also didn't read carefully and mixed all the ingredients together and then folded the red grapes into the mixture. Turned out delicious using the wrong kind of grapes and not following directions!

I used approx 2 lbs green grapes and 2 lbs red. I made it the night before and didn't add the brown sugar and pecans until just before serving. I also just sprinkled the sugar and nuts on top without mixing them in. I would recommend stiring before adding the topping, as my sauce kind of collected in the bottom of the bowl (I used Neufatchel and natural sour cream, which may have made it less thick). Yummy. Still eating leftovers 3 days later and still delicious.

I made this as written, using only red grapes.  As others noted, it is best made ahead allowing  the flavors have time to "meld"  into deliciousness.  Not a particularly pretty salad to the eyes but once you take a taste you will go back for more.  The  addition of toasted pecans or walnuts takes it to a new level.

This recipe was a big hit with my family! I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream however. I will definitely do that again next time. I left off the nut mixture too because some of my family doesn't care for nuts, but chopped nuts can be added on an individual basis. Those who added chopped nuts later said it was really delicious.

I made this with about 6 - 7 cups of grapes and on my receipt it was 4.23 pounds.   We are trying to reduce our sugar so I only put 1/4 cup white sugar with the cream cheese mixture and did not use the brown sugar.   Received many compliments and request for the recipe.  Excellent and light addition to our Thanksgiving

So easy and it is a favourite of my grandchildren.  My grand daughter even called to ask me to send her mother the recipe. I love it too but use red grapes or a combination just because I think it looks prettier. I also toast the pecans just because I like them better that way.  I buy the grapes at Costco - 3 lb. for $6.99 this week - and cut the other ingredients in half. Otherwise, I find it has too much dressing.

This is one of my son's favorites for summer picnics.  I make it with grapes, strawberries, and thin slices of granny smith apples. Instead of white sugar I use 1/3 C of brown sugar and add 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  I almost never have leftovers the next day.

There is possibly a bit too much sugar in this recipe, however, there is no doubt that this is an absolute hit in my family.  Be sure, though, that the grapes are all dry after washing them; otherwise you end up with a bunch of water at the bottom of the bowl. 
Works well with all kinds of grapes, but my preferred are the giant seedless. And I am either subconsciously doubling the recipe every time or this always makes more creme than needed. I don't like the grapes swimming in the creme, just coated with creme. Either way, there is always plenty of extra to go around, or have for left over snacks the next day.

Note: I usually end up making this for family gatherings (6+ adults), so I am always using 4 or more POUNDS of grapes.

Made this with red and green grapes, probably about 3 pounds. I put the brown sugar on just before serving, enough to cover the top of the salad lightly. Everybody loves this. Great summer salad.

I forgot the white sugar, so substituted vanilla Greek yogurt, which worked well. Used walnuts and added craisins. It makes a nice side dish, but I had a hard time understanding the  raves. It was quite expensive to make ( grapes were out of season), but I could see making it again for a dinner party as a dessert. It does  provide a good base for future experimentation.

This is a great salad for cream cheese lovers. I also have eaten it with yogurt or whip topping in place of the cream cheese. I prefer this recipe the way it is. I cannot keep it in my refrigerator, and even my pickiest son loves this salad. I'm always getting rave's and asked for the recipe. Make it to your liking, there is no wrong way to fix this salad. I have somewhat modified to our liking and will continue to keep making this salad.

Whenever I made this for co workers they loved it & split up the leftovers.  When I take it to family pot lucks any leftovers are claimed by family members.  My husband won't touch it - don't know why - so I only make it for pot lucks where I can get a "fix" & then share with others.

I only made a small amount to see what it would be like, and it was a delicious and creamy dish! My grapes were large, so I sliced them into smaller pieces. I used plain Greek yogurt that worked as a good sub for the sour cream. Just the right amount of sweetness from the sugars and nice crunch from the pecans. Good way to have fruit!

This sounded a bit strange, but it was actually delicious. I made it a few hours before serving and it was enough time for the flavors to blend, but not so much time that anything got mushy. Next time, I'll probably skip the nuts; the kids preferred the salad without them.

I used green, red and black grapes. Makes it more eye appealing plus gives each bite a slightly different taste. I have also used Splenda in place of the white sugar. Having diabetics and obese members in the family this makes it a little more "legal".

Absolutely delicious! My sister made it for a get together, and a few of us were fighting over the bowl! I made some for my family the next day. It's a great dessert salad! Or midnight snack salad. Or breakfast. Oh heck. It's good no matter what time of day!!

I've made this recipe for years.  I also use fat-free cream cheese and sour cream to cut down the calories - so much other stuff you never notice it.  Often, at parties, people look at it and say "I'll pass".  Once I encourage to just try a 'taste', they rave about it.

Hold the phones!!....This is delicious and so easy to prepare! Big hit at luncheon of friends & family! Make sure the grapes are dry so that the dressing isn't thin & soupy. I have already shared the recipe. I actually halved the recipe and had plenty for seven ladies who have hearty appetites. Next time I make it, I will use the full recipe since it was such a hit. It's good the following day so make plenty!

This is so yummy! My friend gave me this recipe and did it a bit differently but very similar. Only changes are she used 1 cup sour cream and for the topping used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup pecans. I'm sure it's delicious either way!

Husband and father loved it and wanted more more more.  This recipe is very sweet and is more of a dessert than a side dish. Not sure about the quantity of grapes, so I used one prepackaged bag of approx 3 lbs...could have used more.  Regardless it worked fine.

Made this several times this summer.  Huge hit at every picnic.  Making again for Halloween and going to add raisins and call it Eye Ball Goo.  Will put into small plastic cups without the nuts.  I'm sure the kids will love it.

This was delicious. Didn't have cream cheese, so just mixed sour cream, brown sugar and a little honey. Added green and red grapes, plus tossed in some dried cranberries. Topped with pecans and sprinkling of brown sugar. Yummy.

As a whole, this is good, but the nut and brown sugar used as a topping makes it great.

Very tasty, will make again!  Make sure your cream cheese is very soft before mixing - mine was clumpy!

This salad was amazing!  Everyone in the family loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used both green and red grapes, a little over the 4 lbs which is roughly 2 bags at my grocery store. I will definitely make this again. It was a hit!

This recipe was delicious!  I wanted a little something different for our Easter brunch than just your normal fruit salad.  Grapes were on sale, so I bought green and red.  Love the crunch from the nuts and where the sour cream and cream cheese give it a whipped cream sort of texture.  I will be making this again!

I love this salad. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was amazing!!!!! I used green and red grapes and used white chocolate cream cheese to replace regular cream cheese and honey nut Chex cereal instead of pecans. A few relatives have allergies so this accommodated everyone!

This recipe is SO tasty and goes well at any potluck!  Want healthier?  Just use low-fat cream cheese & sour cream, substitute Splenda for sugar, and use 1/2 all the ingredients except for the grapes (thinner coating).  Delicious and a keeper!!

Soooooo good!  This is a permanent part of my menu.
It's a great summer dish & so easy to take to a pot luck.  I think fesh peaches or strawberries would also be yummy.  I'll be bringing this to my next mtg of Les Dames d'   I used walnut instead of pecans.

I have made this salad MANY times & it is wonderful.  I mix the grapes red & green.  We shop at Aldis & most of the time the grapes are about 79 cents a lb.  When they are in season that is.  I use a lot more pecans too.

I had this for this first time at my 4th of July potluck.  One of my guests brought it.  Fabulous!  It didn't look pleasing-but it was the only dish completly gone.   She used an 8X8 tinfoil container, red and green grapes (she said a bag of each), and then brown sugar to cover and toasted pecan pieces to cover...   after reading the reviews I wish I had some left over the next day to try!

I could only give it 4 stars because this recipe is just not nearly as good when pecans are used instead of being topped with granola.  I use the "Just Bunches" cereal that's a spin-off from Honey Bunches of Oats and cover the top with it.  It's goes from "good" to "absolutely delicious".  If you think you like it this way, add in the granola.

Love this recipe!  Since red grapes were on sale, I used them instead of green grapes.  Originally I had intended on halving the recipe & did so with all of the ingredients except for the vanilla & cream cheese (just used one whole package of 1/3 less fat) on accident (oops).  To make up for the overflow of cream cheese I made sure to add in a bit more pecans & the result came out soooo good.  I have had versions of this salad before, but this is for sure my favorite.  :)

I used half the amount of grapes but added a can of drained chunk pineapple.  I also added marshmallows and increased the sugar to 1 cup instead 1/2 cup. Then I added a little bit of red food coloring to make it pink.

This recipe is so simple and very delicious to my family. We usually eat it as a snack. The only change I make to the recipe is that I do not measure the pecans or brown sugar. I sprinkle them both on top until the grape cream mixture is well covered and leave it that way. I don't mix them in.

I just love this grape salad!  I use red grapes, I just think they taste better with it...but I do love the idea of mixing the red & green grapes--I'll have to try that one.    I also do this salad with drained mandrine oranges (no grapes) oooooh, it's GOOD!!!

So, I don't like most nuts in recipes.  But I usually add them if it is called for because most of my family likes nuts.  This salad was wonderful even with the pecans!  I tasted it before I added the brown sugar and it was really good.  But after the brown sugar it was GREAT!  Can't wait to impress the family at our Christmas dinner!

I made this recipe and used only green grapes.  I used 1/2 pound chopped walnuts instead of pecans and mixed the nuts in with the cream cheese / sour cream mixture. I also added more vanilla, and brown sugar and eliminated the white sugar.   We thought it was better this way.  Everyone loved it.

I made this salad 3 weeks ago for a BBQ and It was a big hit. I added blueberries and lots of chopped pecans.  I thought adding some coconut would be tasty, I will be trying that next time.  I will say however that I think the amount of grapes/serving is quite off! But then again I think it depends on the actual size of the grapes and how hungry your guests are!!

GREAT recipe!  My friend made this for a party and my husband and I didn't send any leftovers home with anyone as we wanted it for ourselves, hehe.  She used both red and green grapes and topped it with slivered almonds.  Delicious!

I've tried this recipe and it was okay. I make my grape salad with condensed milk, powdered sugar, whip cream and pecans. It seems to come out better and sweeter that way.

I love this stuff.  I use lite sour cream and lite cream cheese and it is just as good.  I love the brown sugar/nut topping.  It is so good.  I use whatever grapes look the best at the store.

I got this recipe from a friend and it is delicious.  I used red grapes instead of green because they were on sale and it was still delicious.  My daughter loved it and has decided this is her new favorite.

This was really good. I don't like pecans, so I used slivered almonds instead. I toasted them in a skillet and added the brown sugar while I was doing that. Yum. My husband would have prefered the nuts on the side. I'll be making this again.

It was a huge success at our party this summer. The only thing I changed was I used red grapes; the green grapes were too "mushy" and the red offered a nice "crunch."

I had green grapes to use up and thought this sounded interesting. I didn't have any nuts so I left them out. Had to use a mixer to get the cream cheese and sour cream to not be lumpy. My kids really enjoyed this-I thought it was pretty tastey and will probably make again. Thanks for recipe!

This is so easy to make.  Red or green grapes work great.  It definitely makes more than 8 servings though!
