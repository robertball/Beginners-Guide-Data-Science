This is the ultimate recipe! Quit searching! For filling the eggs, snip the corner of a sandwich baggie. Fill with yolk mixture and gently squeeze onto egg white.

These are so good. I love the classic deviled egg recipe and make them all the time. Then I came across this recipe. My boyfriend and I LOVE horseradish and it melds perfectly in this recipe. I will never make deviled eggs any other way. The only reccommendation I have after making these a few times is to drain your relish and horseradish very well before mixing it with the egg yolk. It can make a runny, but still delicious deviled egg otherwise. Also, I don't use the salt and pepper... the eggs have a ton of flavor with out them. Thank you, Sara!

The best deviled eggs! I made this for our Easter festivities and all 36 were gobbled up. The night before, I combined all the non-egg ingredients so the flavors would really pop! I used green onions for a more subtle onion flavor. On top, I garnished with tiny radish wedges and paprika. Served on a tray with fresh parsley, everyone oohed and ahhed about how professional they looked. It is an easy recipe to do if you use a sandwich bag as a pastry bag. Well done!

This recipe has great potential but has some problems as written, namely that there's just too much of everything for the itty-bitty amount of egg yolks!  As I began to mix this up it quickly became apparent that the egg yolks would not just be overpowered by the sweet pickle relish, they would drown in it. I cut it back to barely half the amount called for. I can only imagine that the full amount would have been sickening sweet. I found it necessary to cut back on the horseradish, onion and mustard as well, again to about half the amount called for. The directed amount of mayonnaise was just right.  Ultimately these were fantastic, and even after significantly reducing the amount of relish the sweetness was noticeable, but at least pleasantly so.  Had I strictly adhered to the recipe I have a feeling these would have been tossed. Any flavor of the eggs themselves would have been totally obliterated by that of  pickle relish, horseradish, mustard and onion. We really enjoyed these, but I'm afraid only because I did NOT follow the recipe.

I am giving this recipe five stars because it is a VERY GOOD recipe that MOST ANYONE would at "least" LIKE. My own recipe seems to still be a favorite in my house so perhaps I'll post that one some day. THIS IS A VERY GOOD RECIPE. Once making it, there are changes anyone could make to suit their individual taste. However, that said, I think this is a "CAN'T GO WRONG TO PLEASE A CROWD" basic start recipe! Thanks!!!

I went to a family event of my fiance's, and his mother asked me to make deviled eggs.  They were such a huge hit that for every family event since, one of the uncles has called to make sure that I'm coming and that I'm bringing the deviled eggs.  They are wonderful!

I made some substitutions based on personal preference and what I had on hand - I used less mayo and added about 1/3 cup of creamy horseradish spread. I also used 1/2 of a large garlic dill pickle, chopped very finely, instead of the sweet relish, and I added about 1/4 cup of Dijonnaise because I like a more mustardy flavor. It was REALLY good. Great recipe!

Made these over the weekend and were devoured. I too drained the relish, used dry mustard instead of the prepared and added garlic and onion powders. Hubby loves horseradish, so to him, it was the perfect deviled egg. Thank you Sara!

Waaaay too runny! There has to be a typo here.  Deviled eggs are supposed to hold their consistency a bit.  These did not.  I didn't add the mustard because it was too runny as it was already.  The flavor is outstanding and I will make this again for sure, but the recipe itself is off.  If you make this I would suggest mixing the egg yolks seperate from all of the other ingredients.  Mix the other ingredients together and then slowly add them to the yolks until you have your desired consistency.

Super great eggs!  As for the runny problem I put the relish and horseradish in a bowl on folded papertowel for a bit to let some liquid out.  I also used 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard instead of prepared mustard. It ended up with a perfect consistency.

This was perfect! I'm a long-time lover of EATING deviled eggs, but this was the 1st time I've ever made them - and this will easily be my forever-recipe for them. Absolutely perfect ratio of pickleyness and mustardishness and horseradishyness. Thank you!

You definitely need to drain the relish for this recipe! I don't eat eggs but my boyfriend loved these even though they were a little runny.  I like to boil an extra egg and mash it up for the filling.  It really saved the yolk mixture this time!

Made the recipe as written, and the filling was too sweet and runny.  Will keep looking for a go to recipe for devilled eggs.

Made these for a party and my guests devoured them.  I didn't have sweet relish so i very finely chopped and drained some dill pickles. I used green onions for a more mild onion flavor.  Very flavorful deviled eggs and the horseradish was just enough for a kick of flavor w/o making it too spicy.  Yum

made this for easter- big hit.  And made it for our office Spring Fling, where we have a deviled egg contest every year.  I WON!!!  People couldn't figure out the horseradish but got the sweet pickle relish.   I did drain the horseradish and pickle relish as others suggested.  I think I'll enter this recipe again next year!!!

This recipe is too runny and requires adjusting the amounts.  Eventhrough I had addied an extra boiled egg, it didn't help. After adding two tbsps. of relish and 1 tbsp. of horseradish, it was so runny I had to skip the mustard. It tasted good but I would have preferred a creamier consistency.

Delicious!  I have made these twice, once with onion, once without.  To be honest, they were just as good without the onion and about 1000 times easier!  This will be my go to recipe without the onion!

With the revisions I made to these based on other reviews they were the perfect eggs. I cut the relish down by 1 tbsp and I used less mayonaise than called for (unfortunately I went by sight and did not measure it). I had heard the mixture was too runny but by adding the maynaise last I ended up with the perfect consistancy. The taste was fantastic, the whole plate went and everyone was trying to guess what the ingredients were. Now everyone wants the recipe.

The ratio of ingredients is way off here. If you doubled the quantity of eggs and kept everything the same it might work, but as is it was a gloppy mess. Even then I'd probably cut back on the horseradish. Unless you want to waste an hour and ruin a carton of eggs, I wouldn't recommend this.

Wayyyyyy too sweet for me, and I didn't even put in the full about of sweet relish.   I forgot to put in the green onion, so I sprinkled it over the top - made for nice presentation, but it did make the fridge smell like onion.

Not my taste, sorry. I probably would of liked them more if I cut down on the relish- just too overpowering. I love horseradish in my eggs so that was fine, but remember to drain really well first, same wtih relish or this will be runny.

My first time making deviled eggs, and they were gobbled up, every last one of them!  So they must have been good right?!  Next time I'll put less mustard, I think I put a bit too much.

These are great!  Sometimes I omit the relish and use honey mustard for sweetness.  YUM!

Never made deviled eggs before and this was AMAZING! Although I left out the horseradish because I didnt have it but it was still great. Also I increased the onions to 1/4 cup because I love them.

Very good, though personally I like things a bit spicy so next time I'll add a bit more horseradish sauce to give it more of a kick.

Good recipe, thanks Sara.  This is similar to my regular recipe but with the addition of horseradish.  I wasn't sure if it would be good but the horseradish was great in the eggs, not too overpowering.  I used onion powder but otherwise made the recipe as is and everyone seemed to enjoy.

MMMM These are great, the best deviled eggs in my opinion! I didn't change anything except I did make sure to drain the relish and horseradish. Must have worked because I didn't have any problem with the filling being too runny or liquidy like some reviewers did.

Followed recipe except no onion. Made for 20 eggs. They were gobbled up quickly! No leftovers. Pretty good; will use less relish next time. I put all of the mix into a large plastic zip lock bag, cut one little corner off, and squeezed the mix into each egg white ~ so easy this way!

I wanted to make my elderly egg-loving father some deviled eggs for Easter, and I couldn't find my late mother's recipe. My husband and I searched for the best deviled egg recipe on this site. One weekend we tried 10 recipes and this was the tastiest. The only thing I added was a dash of Worchestershire sauce - don't add too much, though or that's all you'll taste. I'd estimate we added 1/2 TBSP. Fabulous taste all the way around - thanks Sara!

MAKE SURE YOU DRAIN THE RELISH, ONION (IF YOU USE A FOOD PROCESSER)AND THE HORSERADISH!  I DIDN'T AND THEY CAME OUT TOO RUNNY TO FILL THE EGGS.  I TRIED ADDING MORE YOLK AND EVEN SOME CREAM CHEESE BUT COULDN'T GET THE FILLING THE CONSISTENCY I NEEDED.  THE TASTE WAS GOOD THOUGH.  WAS IN A HURRY AND DIDN'T THINK ABOUT DRAINING ANYTHING.

When I make this or whenever I make the traditional ones, I don't think I have ever measured the ingredients. If you think the mustard or any other ingredient is over powering, just cut back on it. Make it the way you like it.  If you eyeball the ingredients and you like them all, mix it all up the way you like it, more or less of each ingredient. Don't give up on it because one ingredient seems to be too much or not enough.

Wow! We found the horseradish very overwhelming. My step father loved them and polished way too many off but no one else would touch them. If you love horseradish or you have nasal congestion this is the recipe for you.

These eggs are OK.   I'm not a big fan of the texture of the relish, and they're more like egg salad than deviled eggs.  In fact, I chopped the leftovers up and made them into egg salad.

Now THESE are deviled eggs!  Deviled implies spiciness and this recipe delivers. A bit thinner filling than I'm used to, but the flavor makes it worth it.  Thanks for sharing, Sara!

Wonderful!  These are just what I was looking for!  I think I will reduce the amount of mayo next time because the eggs were a bit runny.  I also left out the onion for personal preference.

I just so happened to have all the ingredients on hand so I figured I'd give them a try.  These were soooo good! I used a little less mustard than the recipe called for only because I'm not a huge fan of mustard in my deviled eggs, but otherwise they were great!  I added some real bacon bits too (abt 2 Tbsp).  Awesome!!!

These were not a hit in my house.  Hubby & I both love deviled eggs, but these had several problems.  First, the filling was way to runny.  I followed the recipie exactly, and knew right away there was a problem.  I went back to re-read the reviews, and sure enough others had the same problem.  I had to add the yoke from six more eggs to make the filling the right consistency.  It also helped to refrigerate the filling before stuffing the eggs.  Problem solved.  However, nothing could solve the problem of the relish.  It overpowered everything!  It overpowered the tang of the horseraddish, it overpowered the onion--it's all we could taste.  No amount of tweaking could tame the relish.  My husband, who usually devours deviled eggs, ate one and called it quits.  Sorry, this one's just not for us.

These were such a hit! I made 3 doz. for a potluck and they were gone half an hour after we arrived! Everyone wanted the recipe and those who didn't get one wanted to know about "those eggs someone brought that so-and-so told me were so great". (I waited to tell people I brought them just to get an honest opinion from them.) Now I'm asked to bring them everywhere! Thanks for a great recipe!

Even folks who didn't think they'd like it because of the horseradish tried a little nibble and liked this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I collect egg plates so people assume I have the perfect deviled egg recipe.  Well I do now.  I made these for a family dinner plus some old standards for the kids.  The kids tore into these and declared these the winners. Thanks so much.

The flavor of the horseradish makes this recipe a 5 star. It adds a kick that surpasses the traditional mayo and mustard.

These were nice and tasty!  Didn't alter the ingredients one bit.  Who wouldn't want a heaping deviled egg (don't hold back on the relish or anything!)??  I had to hold back one star due to the instructions on how to cook the eggs.  As written, the eggs do not come out fully cooked.  Thought I'd follow the instructions exactly and see what happened, but I think I'll stick to my way next time.

Something was off with these.  I love horseradish, I love mustard and I love sweet pickles; so I'm not sure why I didn't love these!?!  I would definitely try again and mess with some of the ingredients.

Not for my taste.  They were soo bad that I thought I had not followed the recipe correctly.  I would suggest using 1 teas of horshradish and 1 teas of mustard - that maybe a start.  The relish was a nice touch, but I wouldn't even attempt this recipe again.

Used this to make egg salad instead of deviled eggs. Added just a little celery, used dill pickles and used green onion. Both my youngest and I thought this made a nice egg salad. Didn't make as directed but it all turns out the same in the end. ;)

I have to be honest, I love horseradish, but as I now know, not so much in a deviled egg.  I recommend cutting back on that ingredient.

Well, these eggs were not bad.  But, they were not tasty like I had hoped.  The horseradish was way too pronounced and I used half the amount the recipe called for.  I like horseradish but do not think it pairs well with deviled eggs.  I will stick with the traditional version - but I'm glad I tried something different.

I'm an accomplished cook. Some would describe me as a gourmet cook. However, I don't eat eggs except sunny side up and eggs benedict (poached.) Hence, I don't cook hard boiled eggs. So I went exactly as the recipe stated. After the eggs cooled, I went to peel them and found I had a perfectly POACHED egg. So I boiled my eggs again for 6 minutes, hoping that would be sufficent. I have found that depending on how long the egg has been cooked, the yolk will pop right out. Or it will need to be scraped out. I have to admit, I find it amusing that I had a bit of a difficult time with this! Anyhow, I made the eggs, and within 20 minutes they were gone. I didn't try them, but I guess that if they were gone that quickly, they were a success!

I just finished these eggs, and before I could put them in the fridge my boyfriend already had eaten 4 of them!  He said they are the best he has ever eaten(he's 35 and an experienced deviled egg eater)!  I agree!  They were amazing!  I did make one change.  I cut up 3 tablespoons worth of finely chopped dill pickle INSTEAD of the sweet relish.  I didn't have any on hand.
Next time, I'll try it that way.
Thanks for the recipe!

This was not my "thing." However, I did leave out the horseradish because I knew I wouldn't go for that, so I'm sure that if you are a horseradish fan they are great. But, the main reason why I disliked these was that it was way too mustardy! I like slightly sweeter deviled eggs, so if you are like me on this, use another recipe.

Had a New Year's gathering and served this with the "Spinach Artichoke Restaurant Style" appetizer from this site. TASTY AND VERY FLAVORFUL!!! I boiled my eggs for 12-15 min then let them cool in cold water. Had green onions but forgot to cut 'em up and add them. No matter......they DID NOT disappoint. The horseradish added that extra lil' UMPH to it!!! Watch the salt but don't be afraid to add/substitute with seasoning salt. Tony Chachere's is the Louisiana Favorite!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

These deviled eggs have a good flavor, but I found the mayo to be too much.  I added 6 more egg yolks to the filling to make it thicker.

This was my first ever attempt at deviled eggs.  These were good, but not earth shattering.  I will try other recipes rather than settle with this one.

These were a big hit at the baby shower I just attended...I drained both the horseradish and relish and the consistency was perfect...I also used only 1/4 cup of relish...and it was the perfect amount...

On the relish, I use 1/2 sweet and 1/2 dill.  I also use white pepper instead of black (about 1/2 teaspoon).

Wow! The horseradish really makes the eggs delicious! I used green onion instead of just onion, added a dash of worchestershier sauce, and left out the pickle relish all together. They were the bet deviled eggs I've ever had.Thanks for the recipe!

These eggs were very will received by my guests. Just about everybody agreed that most deviled eggs have a “bland” filling, but not these. I noted other reviewer’s suggestions about the pickle relish, so I used a potato ricer to squeeze the water out. This worked very well. One ingredient change I will make the next time is to reduce the pickle relish by ½. For my tastes, I thought the amount of relish in the recipe slightly overwhelmed the horseradish, but that is just personal preference. Also, I recommend leaving the eggs in the hot water for at least 15 minutes to be sure there are done.

This egg recipe is wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed this tangy creamy textured version of an old standby. Like another reviewer suggested, be sure to squeeze excess moisture from the pickle relish so your filling will maintain a nice creaminess rather than a runny consistency.

This was great!  I loved the use of the horseradish.  The only thing I did different is I used pickle juice instead of the relish and it came out so moist!!  I didn't have relish in stock.  I will be making this again.

I also cut back on the amount of mustard, horse radish and relish but I still kept them in equal measurements. I thought the overall egg tasted of mustard.  That was the predominant flavor.   If I made these again I would cut the mustard in half an up the relish and horse radish. The mayo was dead on. Thanks for sharing.

I should have read the other reviews. My eggs were too runny. Should have watched the pickle relish, maybe it was too wet. I think I could have used more eggs. Now it looks messy but I'll eat them anyway. Should just make egg salad with them. Flavor was just okay, nothing special. FYI - my husband said they were the BEST deviled eggs he has eaten so I guess I'm sold. Will make them again. I will drain the pickle relish and use the list of ingredients sparingly. Maybe the eggs were supposed to be jumbo or extra large. My eggs are large and maybe not quite as big as they should be for all the ingredients called for.

I typically make the more traditional deviled eggs (with relish and vinegar), but decided to try these.  They were very good.  The horseradish gave them a nice zip and the diced onion gave some texture.  I personally prefer the traditional ones, but these were nice for a change and everyone enjoyed them.

I guess I'm not a fan of horseradish.  The taste was too strong in the deviled eggs I made with this recipe.  Also, the relish was a little overpowering.  I think I'll just stick with the traditional recipe.  Thanks anyway!

The flavor of these eggs was wonderful.  They had a nice kick too them.  The only reason I didn't it five stars is because my yolk mixture was runny.  I think that it might be because my relish had a lot of liquid.  These were worth trying again and I plan on using this recipe next time I make them.  Thanks Sara!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was good, but not great. Will follow the advice of the other reviewers by draining the relish and horseradish (mine was pretty runny). Also, add your horseradish a little at a time -- I think my horseradish was a little stronger than most prepared horseradishes, and it was a little overpowering in the recipe. Will back off a bit next time.

Divinely devilish! I really liked the ingredients added to the egg yolk mix. The horseradish is just perfect along with the sweet relish. (I had to cut up some sweet pickles since I ran out of relish.) They're in the fridge and ready to serve for Easter dinner!

Wow, these actually were the best deviled eggs I've ever had. They had a nice flavor to them and definitely earned the 5 stars that I rarely give out. I recently made them for a birthday party.  There were only two cooks out of the crowd; me and another guy, and he gave me compliments on this dish.  This is my new deviled eggs recipe.  Thank!

Very good however, I used horseradish mustard in the place of horseradish and dry mustard.  Very good.

I do not like to rate if I modified the recipe.  However, I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was still delicious even though I omitted the onion and horseradish. (My dh won't eat it.)  I added 1 tablespoon of relish fearing it would be too sweet, and regret not adding the 3 tablespoons the recipe called for.  I also took anothers suggestion and snipped off the corner of a baggie to fill the eggs.  It was so much easier and cleaner.  Thank you!

This went over very well.  I forgot to add the onion so they were a bit sweet, but everyone loved them regardless.  I'm going to make some more to test the differences.  I also suggest NOT using a pastry bag to fill these.  I tried it a first but gave up after filling two.  It's hard to fill the bag in the first place.  Using a fork or spoon is much easier and makes it look better.  The pastry bag gives it an odd, processed look.  Otherwise, great recipe!

The flavour was nice, however, the filling was too "liquidy".  Maybe I'll try them again and cut down on the mayo.

These are delicious.  Since it was my first time to make this recipe, I made it exactly as stated.  They were a little more runny than I'm used to, so in the future, I'll use less of the wet ingredients.  But they are wonderful all the same, and deserving of a five-star rating

I have always loved deviled eggs, but could never find the right recipe.  This was it!  Made it exactly as is.  Make sure to get all the liquid out of the horseradish, or your filling will be runny.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are really good. I used paper towels to squeeze the excess liquid out of the horseradish and relish. I chopped the onion up very fine.

The horseradish puts the "devil" back in deviled eggs. I kind of cheated and used horseradish sauce and reduced the amount of mayo since that is what I had on hand. I like these even better than the recipe my Grandma used to make.

I had high hopes for this recipe and was really let down. The relish was WAY too strong, I think 1 tbsp would have been plenty. Next time I will adjust the relish and add more yolk to thicken it up a bit. This recipe definitely has potential but needs tweaking.

These eggs are the best!  I have made them for several holiday gatherings, and they are always the first thing to go no matter how many of them I make.  They have just the right amount of kick.  I puree the onions as I don't like the crunch of raw onion, but like the flavor.  Will make these again and again!

Still looking for the perfect deviled egg recipe but this was decent.  The horseradish is a nice touch.  As others mentioned, the filling turned out kind of runny.  Might try less sweet relish next time.

I thought the flavors were good, but the proportions are waaaay off.  I used only on tablespoon of relish and half the mayo.  I first made it according to recipe, but it was like a soup!  I liked the difference the horseradish made it in.

These were really good!  These went so fast at our 4th of July party so I am glad I doubled the recipe.  I used a little less mayo and mustard so that the filling wouldnt be too runny.  I also left out some of the relish because I thought it made them a little too sweet.  All in all, definitely a repeat!

These were just OK.  Not the flavor I was hoping for.  I'm not sure but I think that maybe my horseradish had gone bad.  There was just an odd flavor and I didn't think it was any of the other ingredients.  Anyway, if this was the case... my bad not the recipe.  Either way I probably wouldn't make these again

I made these eggs for a picnic that my family went on in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  My family loved them, even my brother who does usually eat deviled eggs really liked them.  The only thing I would say to do is to reduce the relish from 3 tablespoons to 2, but otherwise they were great, and everybody gave them a thumbs up.

I wanted to give my guests a choice of traditional deviled eggs or a newer version of the deviled egg. I'm not a fan of horseradish but my friends obviously were.  They ate those eggs so fast I wished I hade made more.  Great hit at my BBQ.  Will definitely make again, it's already been requsted.  Thank you.

Yum! Nice zing and texture.  I used red onion and really finely diced them.  Didn't have relish, so used 'Cucumber Chips' and finely diced those as well.  And lastly, instead of horseradish I used half light mayo and half Wasabi Mayo (available at Trader Joe's).  Very good!

Well, grumpy loves it, it was only ok for me.  I think I didn't care for the relish in it, which was strange because I do like sweet/spicy.  Maybe it just had too much sweet for me.

These were yummy!  I took some of the liquid off the relish and the horseradish before adding to the eggs. I also left out the onion.  Good flavor.  I will make again.

This is a nice change and eveyone liked them with the horseradish but, as several others mentioned, I recommend draining the horsereadish and pickle relish. Otherwise, it is really thin. Very good overall!

These wre good-i left out the pickle relish as i thought it would taste to much like egg salad then. I did like the touch of horseradish-i used creamy horseradish. Made two dozen and they were gone all in one day but i served 6 people. They all had second and thirds.

Unlike some people, I didn't find the horseradish to be too strong- in fact it was the perfect compliment to the deviled eggs.  I would only use this recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I just made these for a grad party and they are great! I added more onion and omitted the sweet pickle relish so it wouldnt taste like miracle whip instead of mayo! Not too shabby!

Very, very good!  All the ingredients added the right kind of zip.  Thanks to all who warned about draining the relish!  Use paper towels to squeeze out excess water from relish.

I forgot to read the ratings on this recipe before I made it or I, too, would have squeezed out the relish, but since I didn't and thought it was a little too soupy, I stuck it in the refrigerator overnight before filling the eggs.  It worked out fine, but next time I'd squeeze the relish also.  I made 2 dozen for 18 people and there was only 1 left, so you know the taste was good!

Everyone loved these!  The horseradish definately gave it a different slant........my filling was a little too 'soupy' for me and don't know why; too much overmixing??  Used a little less relish but overall flavor was exceptional!!

I prepared this appetizer for a Christmas party and it was quite a hit. The horseradish definately is a key ingredient that sets this deviled egg recipe apart from others. I did substitute yellow mustard for the prepared mustard, however. Try experimenting with different flavors of mustards- such as Hawaiian style or fancy Dijons... Thanks

Skip the chopped onions in the recipe and don't use all that paprika that's in the main picture or you will taste nothing but paprika ! Lol Otherwise, very good classic deviled eggs recipe with a twist !

This is by far the best deviled egg recipe I've found. My only changes were to grate the onion (I think it's easier than trying to finely mince a small amt of onion), used a bit less mayo and chopped some sweet pickle in lieu of relish (didn't have any on hand). I think this recipe, maybe with a crunchy element, would make an excellent egg salad too. Thanks for submitting Sara.

So, I listened to other reviewers and tripled the amount of eggs (18) and only doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I mixed it all in my stand mixer to ensure a smooth texture.  Sadly, these were super spicy.  Almost unbearable for me.  Those that liked a bit of a 'kick' loved them; however, after all the effort these took; my whole immediate family didn't want to eat them.  For the future I would leave out the horseradish all together.  If you want to include it, I would 1/4 the amount for 1 batch, and 1/2 the amount for a triple batch.  The relish gives it a sweetness and a nice texture.  I also omitted onions.  The receipe as is though is not something that will work.  Adjustments have to be made.

Made the Classic recipe and this one for a party, all of these were eaten and only one of the Classic. I did drain the horseradish and relish before adding to yolks. No salt. This is now my recipe for deviled eggs. Thank you.

The flavor is good but it's a bit much. I might actually cut everything in half next time so that the egg flavor comes through more. Still the closest to my grandma's that I've ever found!

Yum!  I cut the recipe back to 3 eggs rather than 6 and the ingredient amount was perfect.  We liked the subtle hint of the horseradish in the yolk mixture. I served this with marinated flank steak and 'Barley Bake' from AR.

This recipe got more compliments than anything I've ever made I think! Made these for our family Easter dinner, and everyone just gushed about how great they were. This was the first time I've ever made deviled eggs, and I have to say I don't think my family will let me bring
anything else but these to all our family outings in the future! Great recipe!!!

I only used 1 tsp of creamy horseradish and 1 tsp mustard because I didn't want the flavor to be to strong.  I think that was about right for me, because I could still taste those ingredients.  I used green onion which I liked.  This was good but I like other's better.

This turned out great! I accidentaly cut the eggs shortwise and it made them difficult to stand up. I also used a little less horseradish as some may find that a little overwhelming. Instead of using sweet relish, I chopped sweet girkings and added some of the vinegar juice from the jar..same thing as sweet relish except I think it is better. Cudos!!! Delish!!

This was my first ever attempt at making deviled eggs, even though I have eaten my mother's version for many years. I made these for a dinner party and no one could pinpoint what was so special and delicious until I told them about the horseradish!! Several people said they were the best deviled eggs they had ever eaten. I left out the onions as my best friend hates them.

I made these for Easter dinner for my boyfriend and his parents. They turned out pretty good, but I did not like how the relish made the filling chunky. There were still gobbled up though.

Ultimate recipe!! I also added some chopped celery for extra oomph, and the eggs turned out great, even though it was my first time ever making deviled eggs. I recommend not using a full 1/4 cup mayo. Instead start with a few tablespoons and judge by the consistency if more is needed. Also, drain the horseradish and the relish (I used chopped dill pickles) so the mixture isn't too runny. =)

Very good. Came across this recipe while trying to figure out what to do with my left over easter eggs.  I didn't add as much relish because I don't like them too sweet.  Otherwise a very easy and tasty deviled egg.

I did these for a party and they were a huge hit.   Another reviewer mentioned you should drain relish... I did not, and the mixture was rather runny.

This was the first deviled eggs recipe I have ever tried.  It was a hit at my party!  I drained the relish really well (I used a potatoe ricer), did not add any salt or pepper and used a ziplock bag to pipe the filling.  Delicious!!!

To quote my husband, "These deviled eggs are sooooooo good!"  The only thing I changed was substituting regular onion with green onion. I was a little scared of using horseradish but they taste great, not too strong.  For cooking the eggs I would recommend the Divine Hard-Boiled Eggs recipe on this site. You'll get perfect hard-boiled eggs with golden yolks. A HEADS UP for PICKY EATERS: the relish and onion gives the egg filling a bit of texture but they're still delicious.

I really wanted to love this recipe because I love horseradish but I didn't like the relish with the horseradish.  I mixed everything in a ziploc bag and then cut the corner off so there was minimal clean-up.  I was hoping the leftovers would result in a better flavor but again, we did not like it.  I won't make this one again.

Deviled eggs can be pretty bland, but not these!  I don't really care for horseradish but in this recipe you cannot even tell it is in there.  It just lends a nice "pop!"  Really great deviled egg!  Thanks

These were pretty good but like other reviewers I found them runny. Maybe the relish should be strained and a touch less mayo used. I also think that green onion would taste less harsh. The horseradish flavour was nice though.

These were excellent!  The entire family ate them up in no time flat.  Unlike many recipes out there, they are very flavorful, yet traditional.  If you like deviled eggs, these are definitely ones to try.

I was looking for a new deviled egg recipe and tried this thinking it would be great.  These were horrible.  I had a bad feeling from the start when I followed the egg boiling directions.  I have never made boiled eggs by this method (bringing the water to boil and then removing it from the heat).  When I went to peel the eggs it was a nightmare.  

As for the filling recipe, it was very runny, way too much mustard, so much so that I could hardly taste the much anticipated horseradish flavor.  I will not make these again, but continue looking for the perfect deviled egg recipe.

The first time I made this the filling was runny and all I could taste was onion and relish. I made it a second time and reduced the onion to 1 Tbsp. drained the relish and used 11/2 tbsp. and it came out great!

This is by far the best deviled egg recipe I've ever made!  Be sure to drain the onions and pickle relish.  This was perfect for a poker party-the guys really loved them.  No need to look any further-this recipe is a keeper!

I am amongst the loved it group. I made these for a potluck at work and everyone dug on them. I followed the recipe how it was written and took the advice of draining off a little of the relish juice. I left out the salt and pepper. Going to keep this recipe around!

excellent recipe!  the only change i would make next time would be to cut back on the relish- as others have mentioned- it tends to overpower the other flavors.  will definitely make again!

Wow.  We LOVED these.  Boyfriend could not stop saying "these are the bomb!"  I do think liking horseradish is a must for you to like these, but if you do - you'll never make them any other way.   I drained the relish and horseradish.  Used miracle whip instead of mayo which did not hurt the taste at all.  Only change I will make next time is to put a jalapeno stuffed olive on the top.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved them! Didn't have any relish so I used sweet pickle and grated it. My Dad said I'm in charged of making the deviled eggs from now on. Whoever left the sandwich bag idea for filling them, just want to say thanks!

Delicious, the horseradish adds a great bite to these eggs. I would cut back on the relish, but they were the talk of the cookout!

no one really ate them. i also made margaret sanders' recipe from this site, and those were a big hit. i thought these were too runny because of the 1/4 cup of mayo, and the sweet relish was overpowering. if you make them, i'd advise less of both.

There was nothing wrong with these...Some people liked them, others did not depending on who liked the horseradish taste.  I think I'll keep looking though for something that would please everyone.

These are very, very good.  Initially I thought the mustard was a little over powering, and I used less then recommened, but it really adds a nice, crispy, zing.  I finally found a perfect recipe for deviled eggs.

These had all of the ingredients that I grew up with but these proportions just weren't right. Too much mustard and too much horseradish for us. Sorry.

I have always had grievance with deviled eggs, that tasted too much like sweet pickle relish.  These deviled eggs had great zing to them from the generous addition of horseradish, I also used part yellow, part dijon mustard in my mix.  These are how I'm doing my deviled eggs, from now on.

I made these for a Christmas potluck this weekend.  I omitted the onions.  I liked it just fine.  Couldn't really taste the horseradish though.  Could be because I change the serving number and it adjusted the recipe.  I took 18 eggs/36 halves and came home with 4 halves.

I LOVE horseradish and could hardly wait to try this recipe...I was disappointed, I think it was the sweet relish.  I will try it again but with dill relish.  I took to Thanksgiving dinner and they were all gone.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner.  I gave it one star because I had to give it something.  They were so bad, I ran them down the garbage disposal and started over this time my way.  I dont recommend this recipe at all.  TERRIBLE!!

I wish I would have liked these as much as I had hoped! They were ok for me.  I made them for a party...and noone said a thing about them, nor were they outstanding for me.  Not sure what would have made them work...guess I'll stick to moms recipe.  Thanks.

A nice change from traditional deviled eggs.  I served these at an appetizer party and they were well received.  People noticed the extra kick from the traditional version and most seemed to enjoy it.  I didn't think they were amazing, but definitely a recipe I will keep for a change every so often.

I love these! They are packed with flavor! The horseradish added in these is genius. I LIKE IT!!! My mix did come out a little runny, i think because of the relish, but i just added another egg. The more the better in this recipe. THANK YOU SARA!

I drained the pickle relish on a paper towel as others suggested, but filling was still a bit runnier than I like.
Hubby liked these, but there was distinct bitter taste to me (maybe from the horseradish?).  These were alright but I prefer more traditional deviled eggs.

Very yummy!  I actually found this recipe through google before I even joined this site and made it.  It was a hit with both myself and my boyfriend.  I just made it again two days ago.  Altered it a bit using 2 tablespoons relish and 2 tablespoons horseradish and it turned out great :)  The filling was enough to fill eight eggs instead of six (minus the yolks of the 2 extra eggs).  Next time I may try a little extra mustard.

This was one of the very first things I made after I retired. Deviled eggs is one of my favorite "finger foods". The horse radish sauce really makes this special and different.  My wife was surprised that I could make deviled eggs that tasted so great! For one of my first attempts at cooking, I thought I did darn good!

I have a son who could make an entire meal out of Deviled Eggs, certainly the "tasty ones"! I tried this recipe yesterday with homemade hamburgers, and it was a huge success with everyone, especially our son, the Deviled Egg connoisseur!

I really like this! Of course, it has two of my favorite things, sweet pickle relish and horseradish. This is a definite keeper at my house! I even chop up the eggs and make egg salad sandwiches out of it! Great.

These eggs are great. I made this last year for Thanksgiving and plan to do it again. Eveyone loved the new spin on the old favorite. I will try squeezing the relish dry this time.

These were fair.  If I made again, I would use less onion and drain the relish on a papertowel first - the filling was too watery.

This is an awesome combination of flavors. Followed naples34102 review with proportions and these were the best deviled eggs I ever made. Tweak the recipe to your preference with the flavor of horseradish, mustard (I used stone ground) and creaminess with the the mayo.  I also added Horseradish Sauce (there is difference between sauce and prepared) along with the prepared horseradish. Smoked Paprika and a small spring of parsley to each egg adds a little more flavor and color.

Delicious deviled egg recipe!  This does make a lot of filling.  So I had an extra egg set aside to fill, but this recipe would fill 8 eggs easily.  I used green onion and used dijon mustard in the recipe.  I loved the addition of horseradish in these to give a slight kick.  They had great flavor and I will for sure make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I’ve made these twice and they were a hit each time! The mixture was a bit runny but looking at tips like refrigerating before putting in the whites helped.  I think a tad less mayo and making sure to not get a lot of “relish juice” would also help. I loved the kick the horseradish added. Definitely a favorite with 3 teenagers!

This is pretty much my recipe but with pickle relish and horseradish. I decided to make some deviled eggs, saw this recipe, and added the horseradish and a very small amount of relish and they were a hit!

These are tangy with a dominant mustard flavor.  I used one level tablespoon of French's classic yellow mustard, but felt that the mustard flavor is just too strong.  I would rate these three stars for that reason, but my teenage son really liked them.  I don't think I will be making these again, as there are other more balanced deviled egg recipes on this site.

Flavor was good.  I thought the amount of mayonnaise needed to be less because we prefer a dryer yolk mix.  Possibly more pickle and less mayo.

They were a bit runny for my taste, but the horseradish added a great kick. I will make these again, but next time I will add a teaspoon Instead of a tablespoon of all tablespoons required ingredients.

I cooked my eggs in my Instant Pot for 2 minutes on high pressure and natural pressure release, then a cold water bath for 5-10 minutes.  They peel so easy!  The only change I made to the recipe was using horseradish sauce instead of horseradish.  I used the mustard I had on hand.  The eggs were delicious and everyone loved it.  I took them to a party and they disappeared quickly.  I made a little extra and used it as egg salad in a sandwich and it was delicious.  I would also use this recipe to make potato salad.  This will be my go to recipe for deviled eggs from now on!

This was exactly what I was looking for! I knew I wanted pickle in my deviled eggs not sweet relish so searched till I found this one. I didn't have horseradish on hand so I substituted sour cream and used spicy brown mustard instead of regular. I also had some Bloody Mary pickles that added some more kick. I put the stuffing in a sandwich bag and cut a corner to fill the eggs. So easy! Overall, great recipe! Thanks!

Made these exactly as recipe is written and were a nice change and big success at NYE party! Husband likes spicy food, so next time I make them will add more horseradish and less pickle, maybe sub with finely chopped celery. Luckily have a couple left I can enjoy today! Highly recommend!

This is my first time making deviled eggs.  My mother is famous for hers, and she taught my daughter, so usually one of them has this covered for family dinners.  This is a lot like my mom's recipe except for the zing of the horseradish, but that was a nice twist.  I made as directed and the filling was too runny.  Next time I will slowly add the mayonnaise until the consistency looks right.

I loved the pop that the horseradish provided.  The chopped onion gave some crunch - this is a good recipe and was enjoyed by all

This was my first batch ever of deviled eggs and I will definitely be using this recipe again. I somehow had all of the ingredients on hand save for the paprika, and I was one tablespoon short of the relish, but it all worked out just fine. I've read other reviews that the ingredients are "too much," but unless you're just not mixing them well, the combination is flavorful and enjoyable. I wasn't sure how I'd like the horseradish, but it blends in well with everything else and is not hot at all.  My only recommendation is that you cut back on the relish like I (unintentionally) did. Definitely give these a try!

Dee-lish! I used Guldens spicy mustard and added more horseradish to taste and it was a hit with my husband. Next I'm going to try honey mustard and a touch a balsamic vinegar with fig...some chopped up leftover honey glazed ham sounds good too, I'll need bigger eggs! Lol!

Absolutely perfect as is. I did also substitute spicy brown mustard for regular and it gave the eggs even more zing! Fabulous recipe!

These were awesome, as my husband said, "This is the best deviled egg I've ever had."  I used a mini-chopper to mix them, starting with the onion to save the trouble of cutting it up.  Add all the other ingredients, then the egg yolks.  Very smooth and consistent.  Next time I will use just a little less mayo (3 tbsp).  Thank you for sahring!

These were yummy, but how on earth did you get the eggs to boil just by sitting in hot water for 12 mins?? I followed the directions but when I peeled one, the inner layer was still raw. I boiled for 8 mins and then they were fine.

Too much pickle relish and also a little to moist.  I did drain the pickle relish as someone suggested and still too moist.  I might try it again with less pickle relish as my husband & I like horseradish.

I made these for easter and this recipe is a great twist on the classis deviled eggs. Next time I will not use as much horseradish and grate the onion for a more creamy texture. I will be making these for the 4th of July!:)

I was looking for an egg salad recipe for sandwiches and decided this looked delicious.  I chopped the eggs and added all the ingredients except I only used a teaspoon of straight horseradish.  Not horseradish sauce. I am sure I would like more horseradish, but wasn't sure if everyone would. Also used two tablespoons of chopped sweet pickle instead of three. I don't think that was a significant difference. This was so good!  I put sliced, cooked bacon on the sandwich, added lettuce and, after one bite, I just swooned over my super lunch. Have also followed the recipe  to make deviled eggs and this is a great recipe.  My new favorite for stuffed eggs.  I do add a little bit of horseradish at a time until it's just right.  Different brands can be hotter than others.  And I have lost my love of pickle relish, so I always chop sweet pickles as a substitute.

I didn't find anything particularly "special" about these and expected the horseradish to give them much more tang than it did.  Perhaps it's because deviled eggs aren't bland to me to begin with because my mother made them using Marzetti's which gives them a tang.  This was probably less tangy, so by comparision, just nothing special.  Don't know if I'd make them again, though it does seem other people like them fair enough.

I make deviled eggs all the time using just mayo and relish, but thought I'd try something different.  Made this recipe exactly as written.  I thought the mustard was way too overpowering - I  could only taste the mustard (used dijon).  Will stick to my usual recipe.

I had never made deviled eggs until my mom asked me to bring them to Christmas dinner. I am not a fan of eggs in general, and grumbled at the idea, but went with it. I used this recipe, and everyone really enjoyed them -- I even tried one and thought it was better than I had remembered deviled eggs being. A few days later, they sounded good so I decided to tweak the recipe. I used 9 eggs instead of 6, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same -- except for the relish, which I left out. (My husband loves deviled eggs, and said that the relish made them "not as good as they could have been.") The result was great. The yolk filling was very firm, but I am not a fan of saucy things, so it was a plus in my opinion! I couldn't keep out of them after they were done -- they were SO GOOD. I will be making deviled eggs more often now, using this variation. It was a winner in our house -- the 18 halves were gone in under 30 minutes, devoured by myself, my husband, and our three young, picky children!

I like the horseradish in these; gives them a nice little bite.  I don't normally use a recipe for deviled eggs but figured I'd try this.  I used less mayo and a bit more horseradish.  I also added salt and pepper to the deviled egg mix instead of just garnishing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a GREAT Deviled Eggs recipe. I LOVED the addition of the Horseradish Sauce. I had never thought of that before, even though I have always loved Horseradish Sauce.

The only problem I had with this is that it came out too runny. It may have been because I had to take out the onion since I'm allergic. Either way, next time I think I will cut down on the other amounts a little. There was WAY too much left over for 6 eggs anyway, so less ingredients mixed with the egg yolks would help the runniness AND not waste so much. I wouldn't want to change the wet ingredient ratio though, because this tastes too good to mess with it. :)

Thank you SO much for my new holiday deviled egg recipe. I LOVED it!!

I've found my deviled egg recipe from now on, everybody at Thanksgiving was saying they were the best they'd ever had, and I agree. I did double the recipe and had to cut done a little on the pickle relish, since I only had 4 T for 12 eggs. Don't be afraid of the horseradish, it suprisingly isn't too hot. Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Tasted really great with the horseradish.  However, the yolk mixture came out really runny.  Not sure what happened, but will cut down on some of the mayo next time.

If you like horseradish, I mean really like it, then you will like this recipe. It was way to strong for my taste. A few of the guys at Thanksgiving liked them, but I'll stick with the old fashioned way of making them next year.

The relish in this dish was way too strong.  Would try and use a lot less next time, else try a totally different recipe.

Just when you think there is no more "tweaking" to be done to a deviled egg recipe, you try this one! My only comment is that is came out a bit runny, so I think I will reduce the relish next time and make sure after they are stuffed they have plenty of time to settle. Other than that, the taste was superb and they were a big hit!

So it's a good thing I didn't write this review right after I made these eggs because the flavors really needed time to mix. They are still not my favorite, but they are now edible because the flavors melded over night -- horseradish got tamer, pickles less tangy. 

I only used 2 TBSP of pickle relish and they were still too relishy, which also lent to a lumpy texture even after the setting period. Additionally, I used the exact measurements, but with the yolks of 10 eggs instead of just 6. I can't imagine what this would taste like with 3 TBSP relish and only 6 yolks. 

I think I'll stick with a more classic recipe next time using vinegar and prepared mustard to taste for the tang and maybe just spice it up with a bit of horseradish.

I didn't notice that you could change th enumber the recipe is for so I doubled it but only had 11 eggs.  So always check the little number at the top.  Also I did not drain the relish and horse radish so it was a little runny.  I did use a ziplock bag which was messy but works out fine if.  The horse radish I used was a little old and therefore lost some of its zeal.. so it got lost flavor wise.  All in all it is a repeat recipe but I suggest fresh horseradish for real zest as mine added none.  And read all member suggestions prior to making as I did not.

Great! I didn't have horseradish at the time, but I had mustard with horseradish in it, so I improvised. Turned out delicious.

5 stars. I put the onions in the mini chopper/food proc, chopped them really well, then added everything else and pulsed a few times. I used horseradish mustard in place of the horseradish, kids....used the sandwich bag with end snipped, easy!! Thanks

A family member made this recipe for a family reunion, they spent alot of care in making it only to wind up with a very liquidy yolk mixture. The problem seemed to be "prepared" mustard.. It was a shame after all the time and money spent to make 2 dz eggs and I'm sure the flavor of the mix would have been really good had it not been so watery.

I made 30 of these for a party of about 20 people and they disappeared quickly. The horseradish addition is great. I would recommend eating these with a beer to wash down the horseradish kick!

I liked it because it was different and interesting, but the people I served this dish to didn't touch it.  I think when it comes to something classic like deviled eggs, it's best not to stray from the original.  That's what people expect.  At least my people.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and increased the horseradish to 3 tablespoons for a little more kick. I didn't taste it enough in the first batch I made with the recipe as written. I have a classic deviled egg recipe that I love - and now this one for something a little different. Thanks for sharing!

Ok, this was pretty good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and drained the relish and made I cut back on the horseradish a  little. The flavor was great, but they were a little runny, still. This was my first time ever making deviled eggs and I will definitely try this out again. I think everyone enjoyed them, I just wish they wouldn't have been so thin. I would still definitelyt recommend trying this recipe out.

I'm not sure why, but this turned into a tasty treat, but was a strange consistency and oddly pink (the horseradish).  I might try a different recipe next time, although I liked the kick of this.

We did not care for this. My fiance and I tasted the filling and then threw it out.  The onions and relish are totally over powering and they don't taste like deviled eggs at all.  I was really disappointed.

Everyone raves about this recipe!!!! I pipe the filing in with a pastry bag to add a pretty touch, but the taste is so good that my uncle looked at his wife and said "Now this is how you make deviled eggs, you need to get her recipe!!!"

Excellent recipe!  Loved the horseradish kick which I though definitely made the recipe.  I did not make any alterations other than to expand the recipe slightly to accomodate a few more eggs.  All 16 deviled eggs were eaten and people were asking for more.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good. I would not call them the best I have ever had, but they were good.  I will probably make them again.  I may add chives next time to see what that does for the recipe.  I used a hand held emersion blender to mix the eggs.. boy did that make it easier than mashing the yolks iwth a fork!  If you have one.. use it!

This was not like any other deviled egg, that's for sure.  I'm not a horseradish fan so this recipe wasn't for me, it over powered the egg.  If you like horseradish, you may like this recipe?  My husband didn't care for it either.

I made these and they all disappeared. Then, I gave the recipe to my daughter and everyone raved about them. Tomorrow, I will be one of three deviled egg recipes at a function-we'll see how they do/ Everyone, so far, has LOVED THEM!

This is the deviled egg recipe I look for when I need to make deviled eggs (usually on Easter).  They are really good and DIFFERENT because of the horseradish.

I love horseradish, but didn't like the taste of it in these eggs so much.  Guess I'm more of a traditional yellow mustard, miracle whip, pickle relish kind of girl!  Thanks for sharing.

These were pretty good if you really like pickle relish and horseradish.  Next time I make these I think I will cut the amount of those two ingredients by about half.

I didn't measure anything, and I ommitted the onions just because my 5 yr old and 2 yr old wouldn't like it.  I have been making my eggs like this for years even before I found this recipe.  good relyable recipe.

I just made this recipe for a baby shower and everyone thought these were great! They were all gone before you knew it. I left out the onion and used onion powder.   the only thing is you have to drain the relish. I had to put in the refrigerator overnight to thicken.

The mix of ingredients create a much "heartier" deviled egg, one which everyone at Thanksgiving asked about. Quite yummy!
