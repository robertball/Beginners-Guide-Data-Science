I scaled to 7 servings (1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour) which yielded 9 large muffins with my #50 scoop. I omitted the walnuts because the school is nut-free. They were good muffins I would double the dates and cinnamon next time though. I took mine out at 20 minutes next time I would check earlier maybe 15 to 17 minutes. I made these for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless
