i make my veggie ruebans with sliced tofu (pressed/drained) browned in soy butter & a few tbs of garlic powder. I layer the tofu over rye bread, 1000 island dressing, warmed sauerkraut & swiss cheese... it tastes awesome and satisfies my meat eating bf :)

I thought these were okay but nothing I would make again.  A classic reuben calls for Swiss cheese, not smoked cheddar.  I followed the recipe exactly but think it would have been better with the Swiss.  Also, I question why the cheese is shredded and mixed with the sauerkraut and dressing--seems like a lot of extra work.  Even though this recipe omits the meat, the procedure for making the sandwich could still be followed--put the dressing on the inside of the bread and then layer the cheese, sauerkraut and tomato.  I may try it that way, using Swiss cheese.

So yummy!  What a great idea.  I did use swiss and layered the ingredients instead of mixing them for ease.

I couldn't be any happier with this recipe!  First of all, I don't like rye bread, I don't like sauerkraut, and I'm not too much of a fan of 1000 island dressing, but for some reason I was ecstatic to try these and as soon as I took the first bite, I was sold.  My review is just one in a long list of reviews that say essentially the same thing:  These are amazing!  Things we did differently:  We did not shred the cheese, but instead put it on top as you would with any other sandwich.  We did not use the full 1/3 of a cup of dressing as the recipe for 2 sandwiches called for - instead we used slightly less.  But seriously, these were just so good!  They are super fast to make and great for families that have people who are not all vegetarians.  My husband was able to put meat on his while I ate mine as is.  Can't say enough about these except that I plan on having them again.  (and again, and again...)

I made one sandwich with this recipe, just for me. I used smoked swiss and my homemade spicy fry sauce, which is kind of like thousand island. I also used a quality nutty wheat bread, I don't normally have rye bread on hand because 1) I don't eat much bread anymore and 2) I would be the only one who would eat it. This was SUPER yummy, a real treat for someone who gets a special treat now and then. NOTE: I did squeeze out a lot of the extra moisture from the sauerkraut so my sandwich wouldn't be too mushy. It is plenty wet with the sauce and tomatoes.

I am not a fan of Cheddar Cheese in Rubens so I switched it out to Swiss cheese and did the rest of it as suggested. I like mixing the cheese with the sauerkraut. It has a better blend and balance of flavors.

Mmmm, I thought this was GREAT! I did rinse my sauerkraut some (personal preference), and used swiss cheese. I really liked the idea of mixing the dressing with the sauerkraut, as I though it was less messy that way. I also really like the addition of the tomato...I didn't miss the meat at all! I will be making these many more times in the future! Thanks for sharing. :)

This didn't sound great, so I was surprised that it tasted so good.  I made it just as written except that I omitted the butter and used cooking spray and used swiss cheese instead of cheddar.

These were very good, a little messy but still good. I made exactly as written. I made my own thousand island dressing from the Thousand Island Dressing II recipe from this site. I will be making these again. Thanks!

Very good sandwich alternative for non-meat eaters!  I used Swiss Cheese instead of Smoked Cheddar as I prefer the more traditional Reuben flavor.  The acidity of the tomatoes was almost too much with the sauerkraut, but that could be because local tomatoes won't be in here for a few more months.  I will definitely make this again!

delicious! I used lowfat cheeses and a tiny bit of adobo sauce with my lowfat part skim cheese to give it a smoky flavor. I also substituted butter for a vegetable oil spread, used fast free thousand Island dressing, and left it as an open faced sandwich with just one slice of bread to cut down the calories. I was very happy with the result!!

Made this for carnivores and vegetarians and everyone ate it up. I used Maple Smoked Cheddar which everyone seemed to love, but I'm more of a traditionalist and will use Swiss next time. I drained the sauerkraut well and mixing it with the grated cheese made the sandwich a perfect blend of crispy, creamy goodness. Not sure why people think its so much extra work, it only took a minute or two to grate the cheese. It made a fast and hearty sandwich supper which I'll definitely try again.

I still think I like Swiss cheese better with Reuben's. However this was a decent recipe. I did not use the tomatoes though. I'm sure it would have tasted better with them.

Good recipe with the following changes: Used Swiss rather than cheddar cheese. Added Morningstar Farms faux bacon. Rinsed the saurkraut to reduce the saltiness. Toasted bread ligthly. Will make recipe again. SusanKathleen

Delicious!  Used sliced smoked cheddar instead of shredded, but otherwise I did everything as directed.  Even the kids liked these...well, all but one :)

This is a really quick and tasty vegetarian treat that only takes 5 minutes to make. I used some of the ingredients listed in the recipe but I decided to layer my sandwich slightly different. I also used Swiss instead.

So my family loved this with a few changes. I added a can of mushrooms(drained) to the sauerkraut while heating. I opted for sliced swiss and prepared it just like I would a grilled cheese.  Veggie butter one side of rye, butter side down in a heated skillet. then add kraut/mushroom/dressing mix and top with the sliced tomato.  add another slice of swiss and last piece of buttered bread.  YUMMO. Thanks for the recipe! It was great.

This was fabulous!! We did not put the smoked cheddar in because we forgot it, so we put in regular cheddar cheese and it was great. This a meal that we will be having in the future.

We all love this! I substituted and used smoked swiss and fat free thousand island. As I was  mixing the dressing with the kraut, it seemed very saucy. I ended up using 3/4c. dressing, and next time will use even less. I can't imagine using an entire 1c.! I served them with tomato soup and it made a great pairing!

I've never been moved to write a review before, but these are amazingly good!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe and I frequently do.  I didn't make 6 at a time, I just made an individual one for myself and adjusted the amounts on the ingredients to my liking. YUM!
