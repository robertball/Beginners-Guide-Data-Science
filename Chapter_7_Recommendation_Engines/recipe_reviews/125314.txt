Thank you so much for posting this recipe! A bartender made this for us at a resort several years ago but I could never remember the ingredients (in detail). I believe he added a splash of blue curacao.  It's truly incredible and so refreshing on a hot day. I would compare it to a stay-cation with friends. It just feels like you're on vacation.
