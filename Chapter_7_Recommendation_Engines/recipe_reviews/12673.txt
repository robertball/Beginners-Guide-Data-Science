This pie amazed me.

I do recommend you allow some time for the pie to 'set' when you're done baking.  When I made it it was still fairly liquid even after the baking.  Allowing it to set a few hours (in my case anyway) made it perfect.

I made this for our 4th of July celebration.  Nobody even knew there weren't really any apples in it.  I think it should be called Magic Apple Pie instead.  It was really good.  I will make this again and again.

Amazing!  It looked and tasted like apple pie.  FYI: we used 36 saltine crackers (apprx 1 sleeve).

This was great fun to make and serve. It does indeed hit all the notes of an apple without having the fruit on hand. I'm not sure its something I would make all me but nice to know you can whip up a dessert even if you just have crackers in the cabinet.

the only reason i gave it 4 stars was because i changed it.  i didnt use pie crust, i made a crust using quick cooking oats, crackers, brown and white sugar, marg. and all spice.  i pressed that into a pie plate, broke some crackers and put them on top of the crust.  i had an apple and a pear in the fridge that needed to be used up so i sliced them up and covered the crackers, then pured maple syrup on top of the fruit.  i poured the syrupfrom the recipe over and topped it with a crust made from instant oatmeal(apple cinn.), sugar, marg, crackers.  it was so delicious.  When it was done naking, i topped it with some of the syrup i had leftover(made extra)and some maple syrup.  I will definately have to make the original next time.
