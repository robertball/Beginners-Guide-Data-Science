An alternative to using the potato skins this recipe adapts to a small shallow casserole.  I used the rosemary, oregano, thyme herbs and topped with a sprinkling of grated cheese prior to baking.  Bake until bubbly on the sides & lightly browned.

I'm so glad I happened on this recipe tonight.  I had exactly 3 sweet potatoes that needed to be used up, so this fit the bill.  I omitted the sage altogether since I didn't have any, and tossed in a pinch of poultry seasoning (negligible amount, actually) as I know sage is one of the ingredients.  Since I didn't feel like grating the wedge of parmesan cheese, I opted to throw in some feta cheese as a substitution. Besides, if it's this fantastic with the feta, I KNOW it would be awesome with the parm.  But, you know what ingredient really makes this recipe?  The shallots!  They create such a wonderful contrast of flavors. Since the recipe calls for them to be browned, you get little tiny flecks of brown throughout the sweet potato mixture. Exquisite!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

These were so delicious, they were the talk of the table! I used part of a sweet onion instead of shallots, and omitted the sage. Helpful tip: when you go to remove the innards after baking, if you just squeeze gently around the skin, the potato pops right out! No scooping needed ;) Lovely addition to a Light Thanksgiving!

This recipe was very good. We are not huge sweet potato fans, so this recipe was perfect because the ricotta and the onions toned down the sweet potato flavor quite a bit. We added bacon, and used a sweet onion rather than shallot and it turned out wonderfully.

WOW!  What a standout recipe.  I made this for dinner Friday night, and it was so good that I changed my dinner party menu for the next might just so I could include this dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I sauteed the sage with the shallots.  Even my husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes ate them (though admittedly, he's not raving the way I am, but he liked them well enough).  Really terrific.

I made these for Thanksgiving and a few times since then.  They are a nice change from the traditional sweet potato casserole.  I still made a few adjustments to make them a little more Italian to complement the ricotta and parmesan.  Instead of the sage, ginger, and brown sugar I added oregano, thyme, and rosemary.  My husband loved them and he's not a big fan of sweet potatoes.

Wonderful flavor. Made it in a casserole instead of twice baking the skins. The only change I made was to use garlic and finely minced onion instead of the shallots.

I have been making this every dish for every christmas eve dinner for about 5 yrs now. I plan to bring it this year for Thanksgiving. Nobody in my family including myself likes sweet potatoe, but when I make this no one can get enough...I highly recommend this dish for anyone who does not really like sweet potatoes but are willing to try them.

I needed a side for grilled steaks and had sweet potatoes leftover from the holidays, so this recipe looked perfect!
I didn't have ricotta so I used feta instead. I didn't have any fresh sage, so I used ground sage at a lower measure. I also substituted fresh chives for shallots because we grow them at home. I combined everything in the blender (food processor would be best if you have one), instead of browning up the onions and dirtying more pans.

So Delicious! This doesn't require a food processor or even the oven. I microwaved the potatoes until done. Mashed them by hand and mixed all ingredients together. They can either be put back in the microwave to heat through or in the oven. I've done it both ways depending on if I was using the oven for something else. Very delicious and easy recipe. Definitely a keeper!

MY OH MY these were good. I had 3 large sweet potatoes that I wanted to do something different with.  I found this recipe and gave it a try.  Only changes I made were I used red onion instead of shallots and dried thyme instead of fresh sage as I had neither in the house. I also add some fresh grated nutmeg.  I didn't restuff the skins as they were to large for a single serving so I put everything into a casserole.  We loved them the 1st night, but here is the interesting part, I put the leftovers out the 2nd night and we all thought they tasted even better.  So I'm thinking this would be a great do-ahead dish for the holidays.  For the reviewers who gave this less that 4 stars, it does say savory right at the top of the page.  These are not the brown sugar sweet sweet potatoes from our childhood.

These were very good. The only problem I had with them was that the sage was a little overpowering. I'll cut it down to about 1.5 T next time.

Took to a holiday pot-luck and they were one of the guest favs! I used regular ricotta and replaced the sage with fresh rosemary and basil.  I used fresh parm.  Added bacon, parm and rosemary sprig as garnish.  I had read a tip that you can pre-bake and make the filling for freezing up to 3 weeks before needed for the final bake...making it perfect for the busy holiday season!

I only used two sweet potatoes and everything else the same....well kinda the same, I didn't have sage so I used some rosemary (which tasted nice, but even finely chopped the rosemary stayed too hard).  My only complaint about how mine turned out was that  it was not firm enough (not exactly runny though...just seemed too moist maybe?)

I had to change it a bit for my taste.  The recipe stated to use the skins so that was my first change.  I must have overbaked the potatoes because I could not use the skins so I put it in a casserole.  Using a blender would have made it too smooth for my taste, I saved a couple of dishes and a few minutes time by just mashing the potatoes by hand.  I despise sage so I did not use it.  Based on the other reviews, and after having made it without sage, I'm sure that amount of sage would overwhelm the potatoes.  I also left out the ginger and brown sugar as I wanted this to be quite different than the typical sweet, almost dessert-like sweet potato casseroles.  The slightly caramelized shallots and cheeses added a great flavor on their own.  With just those ingredients plus salt and pepper, I thought it was 5+ stars!!  I can't wait to take this dish to share at a get-together.

I made these twice and wowed the people I was cooking for each time.  The ricotta creates such a lovely texture of the mashed sweet potatoes.  Putting it back into the skins to cook is cute, but it would also work just fine to put it in a casserole dish.

These were absolutely fabulous. We aren't found of aweet potato dishes that have a lot of added sugar, so this was really to our taste. I cut the sugar in half, and will probably eliminate it all the next time I make this. As anotherreviewer did, I sauteed the sage with the shallots (for about 5 of the 10 min) and I think this allows the flavours to blend. My daughter had the leftovers for a snack. Thanks!

These sweet potatoes were WONDERFUL!  I didn't end up doing twice baked potatoes with them.  I instead put them in an 8x8 dish and baked them in the oven.  Soooooo good!

These were very tasty but a pain the butt to fix! Note that if you cut the recipe down it becomes very difficult to blend the sticky potato pulp in a conventional blender.

I made these with breaded chicken and asparagus a few days ago. The baking time, however, seemed much too long, and I one shell completely fell apart while cooking! Luckily the flesh of all three fit nicely into two shells, and I was only cooking for two! I didn't have any brown sugar, or sage, so I instead mixed in some fresh chopped parsley. And I substituted about a teaspoon of orange blossom honey for each, in a small indentation before the last bake.
Excellent recipe! My boyfriend is always reluctant to try new things, but he loved them!

This was delicious!!  I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan and dried sage instead of fresh... turned out great!  If using dried, I would recommend cooking with the shallots to bring out the flavor.  My potato was plenty sweet, so I omitted the sugar too.  The ginger was a nice touch, and I probably added a little more than suggested.

These are delicious when done just right. The first time I made them they were great, the second time I had different sweet potatoes and they ended up over cooked - by the time there were twice baked they were just mush!! I'll def make them again though.

An excellent recipe! I was suprised by the richness of flavor and silky texutre that the ricotta lended to the potatoes without the addition of butter or oil. Great flavors, great recipe. Thanks!

I love sweet patatos but I have made so many recipes for sweet patatos and I always find I just don't like it. When I eat sweet patato with butter and a little brown sugar I love it. I can taste the natural flavor. Once I added tons of ingredients it doesn't taste like sweet patato anymore. I used only one tablespoon of sage instead of the 2 1/2 it asked for and it was way to much. I also don't use a mixer to mix the patato. I just fork mix it. I don't like the smooth baby like texture. I like the lumps. I still trying to find that one great sweet patato recipe.

I tried 4 different recipes, the ricotta had a grainy feel in the pallet so it wasn't for me.

Didn't have fresh potatoes so used 1 large and 1 small can of Princella yams.  Used 1 tub (16 oz) of ricotta, doubled all of the other ingredients (except about 1/2 the parmesan), and used a regular onion instead of shallots.  Baked it in a 2 &1/2 qt casserole dish for about 45 minutes. Tasty!

I loved this!  It's just what I have been looking for a savory sweet potatoe.  OtI did play around with the spices a bit but you wouldn't have to.  I didn't add sugar either.  YUMMY!

Really liked this recipe. As with others the shell was to soft, so I made mashed potatoes. Will be making this many more times. A hit with the family.

Skins didn't quite work out cleanly like the recipe called for, but it didn't matter, the taste was delicious! I'd call this Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Cheese.

Delicious and easy! Like others, I made a casserole, since the skins weren't thick enough. I also used fresh ginger and half the sage, and I didn't find any one flavor overpowering. The sage gives it a nice fall/Thanksgiving feel. A definite keeper!

I did not put the mixture back in the potato shells, but just served it like mashed potato.  The Ricotta and parmesan made a great mixture.  I sprinkled cooked peas on top and it was very pretty on the plate.

I added about half a cup of sour cream to the recipe and it turned out amazing. I also used someones advice and did the second baking in a dish instead of re stuffing the sweet potato skins, it was easier to transport the dish to a friends house.

Delicious, nice texture.   I added the chopped fresh sage to the shallots to crisp up a bit before mixing with the mashed sweet potatoes to make it a bit more fragrant and not "chewy"

These sweet potatoes came out excellent! I have been looking for a dish to bring to thanksgiving and this just might be it!  I left out the sage but followed the rest of the recipe.  The shallots add a great taste to the sweetness of the sweet potatoes and brown sugar.  Also this dish is somewhat healthy for you.  I will be making this one again soon!

My husband thought this dish was delicious!  I am giving it a 4 just because I thought that the sage overpowered every other flavor of the dish.  Next time I make this, I will leave out the sage and maybe substitute it, or not.  It seems like it would be just as good without the herb-y flavor.

I made this because I had some sweet potatoes on hand, and I wanted to use some sage we grow in our yard. My husband LOVED it, although I was kind of so-so on it. I found the sage too strong--I would cut back on it. Not that the recipe was difficult, but when you consider the time put into making it, with chopping sage and onion, measuring ingredients, the cleanup of all the pans--in my opinion, it wasn't great enough to make it worth the effort. A plain ol' baked sweet potato tastes just as good, if not better to me! Another note: don't use a blender to make this--doesn't work well. Use a food processor.

Made this for lunch today — very pleased!
Didn’t have fresh sage, so used a bit of dried.
Did the initial “bake” in the microwave in order to save some time.  We really enjoyed the flavor of this — will definitely use this recipe again!

Wonderfully savory sweet potato dish.  I made it per the recipe, but had to substitute scallions for shallots as I didn’t have any. I plan to make it next time in advance and put it in a casserole dish with scallions and Parmesan cheese rather than potato skins - then it can be popped in the oven to finish later.

I loved the concept of savory sweet potatoes, but this recipe was just too much work for the result. Unlike twice baked white potatoes, this recipe did not alter the flavor and texture of the sweet potatoes very much. The sage flavor kind of sat on the surface and didn't infuse into the rest of the dish. I like sweet potatoes just how they are, so I wouldn't make this one again.

Changed nothing and this was delicious.  We aren't sweet potato people yet are trying to move in that direction because they're a healthier option. It was easy to spoon out the cooked sweet potato and use a masher rather than a food processer. We made these to go with roasted chicken breasts.  Next time, will also saute some chopped-up brussel sprouts as a side dish to complement the natural sweetness of the potato.

I made this following the recipe, as outlined.
It worked out quite well to pre-make this, and then refrigerate the stuffed potatoes in a foiled lined baking sheet, which I covered before I put it in the  refrigerator.

I made this for dinner tonight.  My husband is still raving about how good it was. Typically, sweet potatoes are not his favorite. I used sweet onion instead of the shallots, since I did not have any. I cut way back on the sage and forgot to add the brown sugar.  They were amazing! I will definitely be making these again.

We skipped the brown sugar so it wasn't as sweet. Also tossed in some tumeric (since it's healthy) oregano and parsley for added flavor. And of course a little more parmesan cheese, you can never have too much of that. My husband and I split one potato, and it was definitely enough. Will definitely make again.

Instead of blending the ingredients, I mashed it all in together so that it wasn't a smooth paste. Everyone liked the "pieces" feeling in their mouth so I'll be sticking to this method. 
I also put in a bit more pepper and ginger than mentioned in the recipe to Highlight the spice over the sweetness since most side dishes are to the sweet side.

I personally did not care for the ricotta/sweet potato combination. However, this is a solid recipe if you like those flavors together. Planning to keep in my collections, but next time I will try to use egg whites in place of the ricotta. Hoping this will bulk up mixture without overpowering the sweet potato flavor.

This was fantastic!! I used one big sweet potato for my husband & I - perfect portions. I substituted onion for the shallot. Easy to make and so worth it! We will be having this regularly!!

I love the idea of this recipe! I wanted a savory style sweet potato recipe, and this almost does the trick. I eliminated the sugar and added some garlic and onion powder. And for simplicity, I used dried onion flakes instead of shallots. They are a favorite in our house like this!

Wow, just wow. This is excellent. Everything just works fantastic together. Because of my inexperience with cooking with sweet potatoes they came out not so pretty but I could care less. I used regular onion because I completely forgot to but the shallots and topped it off with a little extra ricotta.

Absolutely a 5 star recipe. I make it exactly as the recipe calls for (except I go for full fat ricotta!), and I get lavish compliments on it every time. I usually top it with bacon just for fun, and it's really wonderful. Plus, this is a flexible recipe. You can also add more sugar or cinnamon to make it sweeter, or more parmesan or garlic to make it more savory....all have turned out well, including the original recipe. Enjoy!

I found this recipe while I was planning our Thanksgiving Day meal. I'm not a fan of the traditional dishes with all the marshmallows, sugar, etc.  This one looked like a great new way to make sweet potatoes.  I was not disappointed, they are great! I will make it more often  It is time consuming but well worth the effort.  They were a hit with everyone.

I really loved this one.  I only had dried sage, and will take the advice of others and cook it with the shallots next time.   The shallots did give it such a lovely taste.  It's great this way, but I want to see how it is without the sugar next time - may also add some spinach after cooking. Bacon sounded interesting as well...

These are delicious! I made as instructed except for baking the potatoes in the MWO & using dried sage. I also used the MWO to "sauté" the shallots. It was tempting to add butter & cheddar, but I'm glad I didn't, as the flavor of these developed as they sat in the fridge. I made them ahead & then re-heated for dinner and they were great. (served with Jim's salmon patties & tangy tartar sauce).

Especially if you are a fan of more candied like sweet potato dishes, the shallots, ginger and Parmesan cheese really throw things out of wack.  The flavor was really bland and I really can't see how all of these flavors together could actually taste good.

I just made this for dinner along with the caramel apple pork chops. My family hardly touched it. My husband and I have no idea how this recipe got 4.5 stars. My husband and I were talking about this and we are pretty sure that if we leave out the sage they would be much better. We are going to give these another try and omit the sage and maybe add some grated onion or top them with butter  grilled onions.

This is flavorful and a good diversion from classic sweet potato casserole.  Use a light touch with the sage, though.  I thought it tended to overwhelm the rest of the flavors.  I'm not sure if we will try it again, but if I do I will be sure to omit the sage.

This is a delicious healthful alternative to marshmallow-topped sweet potato pie.  I could not salvage the skins, so just served it out of a casserole dish.  The recipe is very sweet- we weren't in the mood for dessert after dinner because we felt like we got our sweet fix already.

Amazing recipe; I believe I added more parmesan than was called for, and I used fresh sage from my garden. Instead of putting the mixture back into the skins, I used four individual-sized casseroles and topped each one with extra parmesan. Wonderful! :D

This is a fabulous recipe!  The ginger gives it a very special flavor.  I have to admit that I love the marshmallow sweet potato recipes, but those have their own time and place.  This was much better for a weeknight dinner. I didn't have sage so I used basil, and that tasted great, but I will definitely try again with sage.

I made these a while back on Thanksgiving and for me they out-shone the bird!  I added bacon to half the mixture and quartered the skins into "bite size" pieces before spooning the mixture on top.  They plated beautifully and were extremely well recieved.  We plan to make them a tradition!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was to die for! I used some finely chopped onion and garlic instead of the shallots, and didn't have the sage on hand. Even without the sage they were wonderful! I grated some Parmesan cheese on each and put them under the broiler for a bit at the end. Yum!

We try to use sweet potatoes as much as possible as their nutritional value far exceeds the traditional potato.  While this does take some time to prepare, the taste was worth the effort.

Overall, very good!  I'm not a fan of sage so I substituted a pinch of dried rosemary for that and did not add the sugar.  The one hour first baking time yielded an oversoft potato (which I imagine could vary from the water content of one sweet potato to another)but the stuffing really makes this recipe stand out. Plan to make a large batch at one time then vacuum seal and freeze the extras to expedite future meals.

I followed the recipe exactly, and these turned out great. They were a good balance of sweetness-- definitely not too sweet like regular peppers. My husband loved them. We will make again!
