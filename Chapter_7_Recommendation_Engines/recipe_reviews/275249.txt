Used Laughing Cow original Swiss because thatâ€™s what I had and it spreads nicely.
It was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time.
Told about 3 people how delicious it was.

Genius idea, with my favorite cheese!  I made one sandwich as written (on raisin bread) and the other on sourdough bread. My hubby & I each had 1/2 of both.  They were  delicious, but being more of a 'savory gal', I preferred the one made on sourdough bread.   Nevertheless, what a terrific idea, since I also like thinking outside of the (proverbial) box.  Thanks  :-)

This was an easy and quick recipe. I used Challah Bread, so additional cheese was necessary.  Next time, I would mix the thyme into the shredded cheese for more even distribution. I think the indicated cinnamon raisin bread would be very good.  Maybe next time
