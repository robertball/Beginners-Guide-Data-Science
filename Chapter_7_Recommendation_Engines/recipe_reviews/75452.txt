This was good. Very easy if you don't feel like making dinner. I served it over rice and it made a great meal.

This is excellent! I made this tonight, got rave reviews from the family and it will now be part of the regular chicken recipe rotation at my house. Thank you thank you to the creator of this wonderful dish!

This is an excellent and simple to prepare meal! I adjusted the salsa / dressing mix to 1:1 (because I like mine a little spicier) and added some shredded cheese over the top of it. Also served over rice and everyone so far has really liked it! Thanks much!

The tastes was OK - not great.  My husband wouldn't even eat it so, it's not worth trying to fix up for the future.

We loved it.   So easy to make.  I did have to change the french dressing to ranch because I did not have french.  It tasted wonderful.  Will make again

I was worried about the combination of these ingredients, but it turned out great. Next time I will use more salsa (personal taste). Pound chicken before, otherwise chicken can be a little tough.

I made this a while ago and I keep forgetting to review it!  It is so fast and easy to make and the chicken comes out extremely moist and tender.  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.

Loved, loved, loved!  I was looking to make something from nothing & this was it.  I need BADLY to get groceries, but this simple, delicious recipe made a great meal.  I didn't have French dressing, but substitued Dorthy Lynch (not sure how far from the Midwest that it's avail, made in Nebr.)  All I have to say is, "YUM!"  Will definately make again!

My husband and I enjoyed this for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe without making any changes and it works great.  If I make it again, I will probably reduce the amount of french dressing and increase the salsa for my own taste.

This was surprisingly good.  I did 1:1 as a reviewer suggested and used 1 cup salsa (fresh sweet onion salsa) & 1 cup french dressing, 1 tsp thyme.  Baked as stated then served over white rice.  It kind of tasted like a Mexican version of sweet and sour chicken, I thought it was very good and will make it again!  served with steamed broccoli and carrots. yum!

Made tonight but changed it a little. Instead of salsa and French dressing, I used a mango peach salsa (which was already sweet). Then instead of baking, I could in a skillet with the lid for about the same amount of time. I served over rice and provided tortilla and corn chips too for the family to scoop it up!

This is disgusting. I don't know why anyone would hate themselves or their family enough to make this.

This was really good. I actually cut up the chicken breasts, dredged them in flour and fried them until golden brown. Patted them dry on paper towel. To the chicken,  I added some chopped onion and green peppers put it tall in a baking dish for 20 mins.   Served this to my hubby on white rice.  He loved it because I used western salad dressing to add a little sweetness!

I really liked it!  It was easy and the salsa mixed with the French dressing gave a good balance between spicy and sweet.

This recipe was super easy and my parents love it. It's a very tangy  dish and it's great served with Jasmine rice, either over it or on the side.
