I thought this would be a little bland but I was wrong. The flavor comes through well. I will definitely be making this again. A cheese grater works well making the cauliflower into rice.

This is so fantastic. The only thing I added was crushed red pepper and garlic powder. Everything else I kept according to the recipe. My husband requests instead of rice.  I was making every night so instead of dirtying up the food processor every night, I decided to do the entire head of cauliflower at one time. BIG MISTAKE! After a couple of days, it stunk soooo bad, the entire fridge stunk.  I don't know why you can't chop up the cauliflower ahead of time but YOU CAN'T!!

Nice sub for rice, if you are counting calories or carbs.  The sauce I used was full flavored, so it masked the cauliflower taste a bit.  I added about 2 tablespoons of grated onion to the skillet as the oil heated, and I'm glad I did.  I will make this again.  Thanks for submitting the recipe!

This is a great substitute for rice. We're not really a cauliflower lovin' family but enjoy this. It would go along great with any dish that you would serve over rice or as a side. We served it with Chef John's Sweet and Sour Pork. This one is going in our regular rotation for sure! Thanks Lauren S

I hate cauliflower!  I am also trying to prepare better meals for my husband (cauliflower lover) and I.  He bet me that I would never make a meal with cauliflower in it, so, of course . . .  Anyway, as much as I hate to admit it, I did enjoy this dish.  Added some finely chopped onion and a bit of garlic powder.  Actually quite edible!  Served with foil-wrapped salmon and cucumber salad.  Yummy!

I sauted 1/2 chopped onion and green bell pepper until almost translucent, added two tablespoons of minced garlic, cooked an additional two minutes, then added this recipes ingredients.  I used the grating blade on my food processor, works better and did not turn the cauliflower into mush.  

I usually give five stars for a recipe I modify and like, but I am giving this one 4 stars because the cook time listed will have you eating raw warmed cauliflower :(  I cooked the cauliflower an additional 10 minutes on low covered stirring occasionally until tender. I also added about two more T of olive oil due to the large amount of veggies. It was very good.  Next time I will add other veggies as well.

I saved this recipe planning to try it. I dont have a food processor, so I put a 12oz bag of florets in my Vitamix with water to 7 cup line and processed that way 5-10 seconds on speed 3. That worked great. On the dr oz show he swore this would only work by steaming in the microwave with 2 tablespoons of water for 7 minutes. I then, changed methods. I would like to process cauliflower again as rice bits and saute it as instructed instead. I liked the texture, but it was not chewy nor tasted like rice.

The recipe is amazing! My husband and I are eating healthy and right now we are trying to eat as less carbs as possible. Cauliflower "rice" paired with grilled salmon is a great healthy dinner. Only one thing i added was a pinch of garlic powder. Thank you! Definitely will be making cauliflower  "rice" more often.

Sooo easy ! The texture is surprising for cauliflower and makes a nice change. My tips : *Dont put too many florets in the same time into the food processor. *I added 1 glass of water to help cooking the "rice" after it had been roasted with the olive oil. *Go versatile and add turmeric powder when cooking or process half cauliflower-half broccoli etc. Barbecued Italian or smoked sausages go perfectly with it.

I make this all the time and everyone loves it - even kids of all ages. To give it even more flavor, as well as add more antioxidant qualities, I add powdered ginger and garlic, then top it off with fresh lime juice. I often will add baby spinach leaves at the very end - just until they are slightly wilted.

Bland w/o a lot of help...it's raw cauliflower.  Needs some kind of sauce...cheese, salsa, curry, whatever. Definitely taste along the way...more salt and pepper.

It is incredibly easy to make (= quick). I added a little caraway seed and finely chopped fresh leeks to add more flavor. But I am sure it's excellent even without the added ingredients. Served with fish spiced with ground fennel and coriander. Simply yummy!

Just to show you what can be done differently.......I used frozen cauliflower. I steamed it first and then put it in the food processor just long enough to make it look like rice grains. Then I heated the oil in a skillet and added the cauliflower. I sprinkled it with salt and pepper and cooked it without a lid. The goal was to get it to brown a little bit. What this does is dry the cauliflower out some too. It really is very good done this way.

My daughter and I made cheesy cauliflower rice Christmas eve.  She has lots of food allergies so we used a little coconut milk and nutritional yeast after we saute' with a little avacado oil onion and sea salt. We got the recipe from her paleo cookbook.

What is this cauliflower rice I've been missing out on for so long! Shame on me! Absolutely delicious and great low carb substitute for rice. My husband enjoyed this so much he asked if I can make this more often. That says a lot for him. I also added a little garlic powder, but honestly it's not needed. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is in our regular rotation. Sometimes we add leftover veggies to make new tastes and add nutrition. Tonight we had a cup of sweet peas mixed in and it was very tasty. We've also used mushrooms, green beans, and mixed veggies... all good! For a large head of cauliflower, I use a heaping teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. A little pepper goes a long way in this dish. It's even better if you can get a light brown crust on the layer that touches the pan. Mmm!!

Turned out perfect. I did follow others suggestions and saute onion and garlic, then added cauliflower. There's probably no limit to seasonings you could add to suit your own preference.

Better and more flavorful than I expected. If you're making a switch from rice, be aware that cauliflower has a high amount of insoluble fiber which could cause gastrointestinal problems.

Made this tonight to have with sweet & sour pork - it came out more along the lines of couscous, not rice.  Not really impressed with it.  Perhaps I ran it too long in the processor trying to do too much at one time.  I'll try it again as I am diabetic and need to reduce the amount of rice I eat.

I make a similar dish which adds a pinch of saffron and whole cumin seeds for an Indian flair.  I like to eat it with yogurt on top as a meatless entree.

It was very good. We had lemon garlic scrimps on it and it was a good pair. I usually do jasmine or basmati rice plain, this rice needed a little help from the butter fairy.

Heck, I'm no vegetarian or vegan, but I made this cauliflower rice tonight for the first time (adding some sauteed garlic and onion) that was surprisingly very good.  So good in fact, that I'll probably use this as a replacement for future rice dishes.  Made some grilled marinated (keto) Thai chicken satay (topped with a peanut butter, coconut milk, red curry and red chili sauce) and the "rice" worked perfectly with it (and a little freshly squeezed lime juice).  I'm actually shocked at how good the "rice" was.  Crazy good...

To quote Simon Cowell, "I wasn't expecting that." :)

Five stars for concept... but I'd give maybe three stars for the directions.  I cooked at low heat long enough to actually cook the cauliflower, then turned the temp up high enough to brown it a bit at the end.  I added some onion and garlic in the food processor, and used a Tuscan Herb infused olive oil.  Served with baked pork chops, steamed brussels sprouts and a tomato/cucumber salad.

I had a dinner party and doubled the recipe.  Followed to the tee.  It was fabulous.  The one thing I did do was, I covered it and threw it in the oven at 250 for 1 1/2 hours.  The meat was so tender, you could cut it like butter!   We served over cauliflower rice. YUM!

I was surprised by this recipe.   Cauliflower rice is good! I followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked it for 5 minutes. We didn't miss the rice.  This dish has a mild flavor and texture very similar to rice. I added butter at the end, just like I butter rice. I  recommend that you prep  the cauliflower the night before. If you do, you'll have only 5 to 10 minutes before it's on the table.

Good stuff here. It's basically steamed cauliflower pearls. Some changes: 
* Add garlic powder
* Cook it for 7 minutes on medium
* finish on high heat if you like a little browning immediately before serving.

This recipe turned out great, added a little more olive oil, paparika, hot pepper flakes, and minced garlic.  After frying I added a jar of Ragu Roasted Garlic Cheese Sauce to it - was wonderful as a main meal.

Perfect side when you are trying to cut down on carbs. My supermarket has already "riced" cauliflower. How easy is this!! I did saute some chopped onion before adding the cauliflower to the saucepan. Excellent!

Super easy and delicious.   I made it per the recipe and served it with chicken kabobs.  Will definitely make this again as I love rice and am cutting carbs.

I too like another reviewer thought it would be bland. It was delicious. I think I might add some parmesan cheese next time when it is done heating up. YUMMY!

This is a basic bland recipe, to kick it up I sautéed minced garlic and finely chopped onion (about 1/2 an onion). Added the cauliflower and also fresh mushrooms (same consistency as the cauliflower- 4 large mushrooms). Add a little more olive oil and some water or it will be too dry. When done mix a few teaspoons of cheese to it (pecorino or Parmesan). It's delicious! (I only make half a head at a time so double ingredients if using whole head).

Good basic "how to" recipe. Can be doctored up many ways to suit your taste: added sautéed onions, or garlic, curry powder, red pepper flakes or cayenne, etc.

I am so happy to have a rice alternative! The flavor blends great with stir-fry, I made kung-pao chicken the other night, I made this and regular rice. My husband and I tried both and we found the cauliflower rice to be an enjoyable addition to our stir-fry.

This is quick and easy and a nice substitute for rice, or in a chicken broccoli pasta dish in place of the pasta.  I agree with other posters that it can be bland if you don't use some spices... I sauteed garlic and a tablespoon of butter  in the pan before adding the cauliflower.

This was SUPER easy! I added a few dashes of garlic and onion powders along with the salt and pepper. I did cook for a little longer than the recipe stated, but I think that is just a personal preference. I used this to make Southwest Rice Bowls with seasoned ground beef, black beans and corn. I didn't miss the rice at all! Thanks for sharing.

I hate cauliflower. Was super skeptical... But was very impressed. I used the 'chop' on my mini food processor and took another member's suggestion of sautéing a bit of onion --- this was perfect. I did add a bit more salt than I usually do. And served it with some leftover ratatouille (I usually eat w/couscous). Great recipe. AllRecipes is now 4 for 4! This is a keeper.

I added dried basil and fresh ground pepper to the hot oil just before adding half a diced onion, cooked for a few minutes, then added one minced clove of garlic and cooked until onions were translucent.  Added cauliflower and cooked as directed. I seasoned with two pads of salted butter.

Whoever thought of this idea is a genius! Tasty and simple. I used a cheese grater and worked just fine. The end result was fluffy like rice yet tasted like cauliflower.. So good.

I think the cauliflower should be boiled with oinions and garlic first, then drained, and pass it on the food processor to get the rice texture and proceed on the skillet as instructed.

This  was a great change from our usual rotation of side dishes. I was skeptical when my daughter (4) picked out fresh cauliflower that she would actually eat it, but it turned out that everyone enjoyed it. My only comment, I think this really makes well over 4 servings. Even after seconds we still had half of it left. Though I suppose we might have just had an abnormally large head of cauliflower.

Second time making this.  I was not a big fan of it plain.  I chopped 8 strips of bacon and 1/2 cup of pork browned it took all but a table spoon of oil out and added half an chopped onion till soft then added 2 whipped eggs and used spatula to cut in strips added a handfull of frozen peas then the shredded califlower that I used a grater to shred.  I tossed it till it was cooked and mixed well.  Tasted much better.  I am trying to go Paleo and having a hard time because I really like flavor.

Yumm but you have to doctor it up a bit. I added green onion, soy sauce & ginger. I've heard a few dashes of hot sauce & pineapple chunks are delish too...

Too dry and didn't care for the texture.

It was really good. It had a texture like fine couscous or quinoa. I over seasoned this batch and put my leftover chicken with onions and peppers with it. I'm def going to try a curry or indian dish with it.

I made this as a side dish for chicken and for fish.  It's so easy to cook. I sautéed onion and garlic before throwing in the cauliflower.  I also use this recipe for fried rice by adding eggs and soy sauce.  It's a fantastic substitute for the real thing.

I enjoy cauliflower as it is but this was a wonderful idea to "fool" your mouth into thinking you're eating rice. It doesn't taste like rice but the texture is similar and is an excellent substitute for low carb eating. I liked it very much.  I added a little minced garlic about a tsp
