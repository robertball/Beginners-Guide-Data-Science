I made this today using a slow cooker and it was wonderful! I browned the beef first and then followed the recipe except that I added half of a fairly large onion. I deglazed the pan which got the sauce ingredients warm to go into the slow cooker and preserved all the wonderful caramelized beef flavor. Cooked it on low for six hours and served with mashed potatoes and cooked carrots. I didn't thicken the broth but you could if you wanted to. It was a really good dinner and I am looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow! Thanks for a great recipe!

Too flavorful, moist and tender to be so easy to prepare! And the sauce is incredible. I'm saving some for burgers on the grill. Thank you!

Wonderful!  I've been trying to find a pot roast recipe that both my husband and I love and this is it!  Not too sweet, not too acidic.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I also threw in some leftover seafood cocktail sauce to use it up since it's basically tomato sauce and horseradish.

Flavor okay but couldn't really taste the cranberry. Alright but nothing special.  Maybe adding an onion would help?

I had high hopes for this recipe as we love cranberry sauce.  I really couldn't taste the cranberry - there was way to much tomato sauce to allow the cranberry and horseradish flavors to shine.  There was a ton of sauce / gravy which I ended up tossing out.  It needs onion for sure, maybe even dry onion soup mix.

This is a good, easy recipe.  I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce, and would have liked more horseradish for the kick it could give, because  I almost couldn't taste it.  I'm not sure that I would call this a "go-to" recipe for my next roast, but it was tasty.

My daughter loved the gravy. I thought it was good but unbalanced. Maybe a pinch of salt on the meat before browning may help.

This is a keeper.  I had read a couple of the reviews that said it probably could use onion.  I added a packet of Lipton onion soup mix and I didn't have tomato paste.  So I used diced tomatoes (drained).  I think it gave it some texture.  I also doubled the horseradish.   When I saw this recipe,  it didn't register that this is a jazzed up version of Catalina Chicken that we make all the time.

This was an interesting recipe. I made it with baked sweet potatoes, finished with cinnamon and brown sugar, which was an excellent side that complimented the sweetness of the cranberry sauce. I'm not generally a huge fan of pot roast, but it was definitely different. The only change I would recommend is to make the sauce and use it for something else. It would go really well with turkey, or even as a finishing glaze for smoked spare ribs.
