I serve this as an entree not appetizer and shamefully I marinate the mushroom tops in butter not dressing.  Its heaven alright- if you like portabella you will love this.  the crab influence is very mild so its not at all fishy.  I've made this probably 20 times if that tells you anything!  Costco has great portabella mushrooms and canned crab meat btw.

This recipe is a good "basic". I found it a little bland so I reduced the amount of butter, used Italian bread crumbs instead of buttery crackers and added Old Bay seasoning. Much better and easier!

I really liked the taste of these stuffed mushrooms, so did my family. Can't give it a kid's rating, since I did not serve it to anyone under 18. I may try marinating the mushrooms in a butter-garlic-lemon mixture next time, but make the stuffing exactly as the recipe says.
I'm not sure how much you can rely on the stars I've given, since I'm used to chopping, dicing, and slicing when I cook. I thought it was easy to prepare and cook - delicious!

Easy to make Easy ingredients  Tasty finish Restaurant quality taste straight from my oven! The only issue I had was that it was SO RICH when I finished up. My husband doesn't like sea food so I probably won't make it again. It was good, just wasn't what I was looking to taste when I was finished up.

Made this twice with variations. 1st time used boiled lobster 8 oz. tail, no dressing only olive oil prior to broiling, only 15 crackers, fresh rosemary and Italian parsley, and 1 cup of swiss cheese. 2nd time - 15 no salt saltines, drizzled italian dressing prior to broiling, omitted celery. The first variation was far superior to the second. Very impressive - good date appetizer (meal) or party fare.

The only change I made was to use breadcrumbs instead of the crackers because that is what I had on hand. I was feeling lazy and didn't remove the stems just to add them back later but that didn't affect the flavor. I used salted butter and between that and the Zesty Italian dressing it was a tad too salty. I recommend using no salt butter and not using any "salt to taste". These were very rich and YUMMY! Update-I forgot to mention that I DID add a couple dashes of Old Bay.

To much italian dressing stays on the mushrooms.  Neither my husband nor i could eat it.  May try to revise to leave out salad dressing.  Stuffing was good

I substituted portobellini mushrooms, used fake crab, Zesty Italian dressing & left out the crackers, and subsequently inhaled them directly.  Absolutely delicious!  This is the best thing done to crab since cream cheese!

Simple Recipe!  I was able to Fill 3 mushrooms with this filling.  Next time, I would add a lot more garlic and add old bay seasoning.  I would use more crab and less crackers as well.

Very good and easy! I don't like a lot of filler so next time I am going to use less crackers. This is such a good crab stuffing that I am going to use it with fish/shrimp etc.

WOW!  That was the first word out of everyones mouths this evening when I served these.   I used smaller portobello mushrooms instead of the large ones and doubled the filling recipe to serve more people but did not change any of the ingredients.  My daughter said they tasted just like Olive Gardens.  I have another stuffed mushroom recipe using sausage that everyone raves about but my husband liked these better.   I plan to use the filling recipe to make stuffed zucchini.  I will definately be making these mushrooms again though.  Thank you for offering the recipe!

Very good flavor, but rather rich. I stuffed on large portabella and several Baby Portabellas, and the small mushrooms turned out much better. I think the balance is better with more mushroom and less of the crab mixture. Everyone loved them.

This is pretty yummy. I used canned crab (Trader Joe's) and several dashes of Old Bay seasoning (thanks to the suggestion of other reviewers!). I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of crackers and sauteed the onion/garlic, etc in a little bit of olive oil instead of butter. I'll remember this one for my next pot luck!

I had to use the recipe as a starting point, but definitely like the concept. I think Italian dressing is way overused as a marinade, so I skipped this step. Also used panko crumbs instead of crackers. Added Italian seasoning to the mix and even skipped the cheese and it still came out very good. Husband says to add it to the list of keepers!

This is an incredibly delicious recipe.  I followed with two exceptions.  1.  marinated the mushrooms for about 30 minutes and 2.  was very careful about sodium.  Used unsalted butter and no added salt.  Turned out fantastic!

This was just OK for us.  We used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers for the filling and that made it too salty.

Loved this! Made it as an entree, and wasnt sure it would be enough for a meal for my husband, so used some of the sauce and made a light  pasta. The portabella itself was definitely enough but the pasta was a nice addition. I also followed the suggestions of others & used less crackers. Glad I did b/c it probably would have been dry if I had used the full amount called for. Would definitely make again. (pictures posted)

Coming from Mary;and, it was against my nature not to add Old Bay Seasoning, however, this recipie is wonderful just as it is written. I was worried about the amount of dressiing suggested for the marinade so I did cut that down a bit and I topped the final product with a little remainder cheese. I was also out of buttery crackers so I made butter croutons that I crumbled into the crab cheese mixture. Beautiful presentation and perfect for the portabello mushroom lover.

I made these for a special New Year's Eve dinner, and they were a hit!  They were easy to make and turned out delicious.  I did not marinate them in dressing, and I did not use an "Italian blend" cheese.  I skipped the marinade altogether and just used the shredded chees I had (cheddar, monterey jack, and asadero).  Everyone raved about how elegant they looked, and how great they tasted.  Even the kids ate them and asked for more....Thanks!

I used five giant portabella mushroom caps. I followed the recipe for the most part and gave four stars but only because instead of Italian dressing which we're not crazy about, I used lemon juice, olive oil & butter for the marinade. No crackers either, I made bread crumbs by throwing stale rolls in the food processor with a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning. Will do it the same way again because this turned out FANTASTIC!! Thank you for posting this LJALEXSTADT as it made a great side dish and saved us from a boring dinner tonight!

I was really excited about this recipe, but it came out really bland in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably try marinating the mushrooms in lemon/garlic, with more crabmeat (not the canned stuff either) and less crackers.  And maybe find a remoulade to serve along with it.

Used small Portabello mushrooms to make 1 per person, and reduced broiling time to 4 min. baking time to 10 minutes total.  We also added more garlic, as a garlic loving family - both to the marinade and the filling.  Will definately make again.

Very good, crabs are not running yet so used diced shrimp plus added Old Bay just because we are on the Chesapeake Bay

All I can say is that this recipe, with some modifications, is Portabella Nirvana Keto or Low Carb Plus... Best I've ever had.

Modifications are as follows...use 1 lb of snow crabs cooked in crab boil seasoning per two mushroom caps. Another substitution was Pork Panko for bread crumbs or crackers.
marinated with Italian dressing for 45 minutes, drained and broiled 10 minutes as called for.  Mixed plenty of cheese, with the mix in skillet and then when stuffed mushrooms added more as seen in picture....Baked at 400 until cheese melted...took out and included a dollop of Boursin Cheese.
Absolutely the best Mushroom/crabmeat I've ever had anywhere...

It was amazing, my whole family loved it!!! I recommend taking it easy on the Italian dressing marinade for the mushroom caps, cause it can get too liquidy, but I still pulled it off and it was extremely good!

I used more crab and used breadcrumbs instead of the crackers.  The flavor was great, but I may use more melted unsalted butter next time to moisten the mixture instead of the marinade.  Adding more marinade made it too salty for our taste.

Worked out nicely for a quick fancy lunch with a salad added. No Italian dressing used. Marinated in extra virgin olive oil with oregano and garlic powder. Broke up some lump crab cakes into the stuffing mix and added some red pepper flakes. No crackers. Used a package of Old Bay crab cake mix. Definitely use REAL BUTTER. Mexican Queso Fresca shred keeps it lighter.

Definitely good and definitely easy, but I used canned crab and was a little disappointed in the taste.  It was pretty covered up.  I am going to try Costco's canned crab to see if that helps.  (I tried the fake crab and it tasted like fish.)Instead of broiling the mushroom caps I just baked them for 15 minutes at 350.  

UPDATE - I made them again tonight but was out of Italian dressing, so I baked them filled with butter.... and they went from good mushrooms to PORTABELLO NIRVANA.  What an improvement!!  Even with the canned crab.  Butter turns them into a 5 star.

I've made this twice the first time I did soak the caps in the Italian dressing the second time I did not.  They turned out much better not soaking them.  I also added some shrimp and a little horse radish and old Bay seasoning. Everyone loved this recipe it was a huge hit. I will be making this again and again!

Love this recipe. It was quick and simple to make and full of flavor. I did cut it down to about 4 oz of dressing and added some Old Bay. This is a great last minute meal.

I used this recipe as a guide, adding my own tweaks. I only used 14 crackers, added about 1/3 c of minced onions and a heaping spoon of cream cheese to the mixture while still in the pan. This will blend in nicely.  Then added the cheese and crackers.  Like others, I did add a dash of Old Bay.  I am all about shortcuts, so did not broil the mushrooms first.  I drizzled with olive oil, and used salt and pepper before putting the filling in. Then squeezed some lemon juice over the top before adding the rest of the cheese.  I baked in 325 degree oven for 15 minutes.  They are so delicious!  I will probably try this in appetizer size mushrooms next time.

These were absolutely wonderful. My proportions for the stuffing was off because I had a package of crab legs in the freezer and used the whole thing. The most difficult part of this whole recipe was getting the meat from the shell. My family loved these!

This recipe was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe for 4 mushrooms and had more than enough filling. I only used 1/2 a bottle of Italian salad dressing and substituted artificial crab meat.  It was delicious and my husband loved it too!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Yum!  The only thing that I would change is reduce the about of butter.  I doubled the recipe because I had 5 caps and the butter just seemed like it was way too much.
