This is great. I had to leave off the water chestnuts since I am allergic and have had to use Bac'os once but it was still a big hit. 
I also alter the types of cheeses so that it has a more exotic flavor. 
It is always the first things to go and the conversation piece.
JUST MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE ALL THE KERNALS!!!!

What a fun salad! Very skeptical at first but was totally surprised! I used hot air popcorn. Since this is rather rich tasting, you wouldn't want any extra salt or butter. I will make definately make again.

I made this salad for my daughter's graduation party, and it was the hit of the banquet table!  Everyone wanted the recipe, and I even received calls long after the party asking for the recipe.  The popcorn makes it very different, and it is delicious.

Actually better than I thought it would be.  I liked it, although ,my picky kids didn't want anything to do with it after tasting it.  My husband liked it but wouldn't eat much of it, because of it's fat content.  I would make this for a potluck or bbq in place of potato or macaroni salad.

I work in a grocery store where the deli has this salad.  I love it, so was glad to find the recipe here so I can make my own.  This one is a little different, but great.

I read all the other 5^ reviews but I guess I just don't get it.  It is such an odd comination but I thought I would try it anyway.  I wish I would have put all those ingredients on cooked pasta instead.  I feel like I wasted alot of bacon etc for nothing.

I make this recipe during the summer for outdoor barbecue parties.  My version is pretty much triple the ingredients listed and I always use 1/2 cup finely chopped onion instead of the chives.  I also use far less bacon - 1/2 lb. for a triple recipe.  I find that mixing all ingredients together EXCEPT for the popcorn helps to blend the flavors.  I add the popcorn just before serving.  If you have Old Dutch popcorn available in your area it's the best brand to use.  It has few hulls and isn't overly salted.  Any commercial popcorn will work better than homemade because it's lighter.

Even my husband thought this was great. He usually won't eat any salad with mayo. The trick is to use only regular mayonnaise.Low fat will make the salad soggy right away.

This was delicious, surprisingly! My husband is very critical about food and he loved it. He even repeated his compliment several times that night. We took this to a neighbors cookout and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the chives (didn't have any). I also was very skeptical at first b/c the mixture without the popcorn didn't look too appetizing, but once the pc was added and the bacon and cheese was added on top, you really couldn't tell that there was popcorn in it. I will definitely make this again and maybe add some red onions to it.  Thank You.

Very good.  I tried this today.  Sounds weird, but it works well.  One of our daughters thought it was a little heavy on the celery.  She wasn't impressed, but she said she'd eat it again.

The waterchestnusts and popcorn give this salad an unusual texture.  It has great flavour and colour and I've even found that it's just fine even if the popcorn gets a bit wet from the dressing.

Hmm, not bad, but not quite as good as I was expecting.  The popcorn loses its crunch when mixed into the rest of the salad (which, for the record, is NOT easy to do) and becomes pretty chewy.  And yes, I waited until just before serving it to mix it together.  Others seemed to like it but I was not impressed.  Also, maybe I shouldn't have used sharp cheddar, but the cheese was all I could taste, even with that bacon in there (and I didn't even add the extra cheese sprinkled on top!).  I think the same basic recipe might be good with a different (or milder-flavored) cheese and used as a pasta salad base instead of with the popcorn.  The other ingredients are a nice mix of flavors.

Not our favorite!   I might have liked it a bit better if i used Miracle Whip.  I like bacon, cheese, water chestnuts and popcorn but not together in a salad.  The verdict was that it was interesting to try and we'll never make it again.

Not a hit with either the kids or adults.  We are a house of adventurous eaters, and major lovers of homemade popcorn - but this one misses the mark.  Will not mke this one again.

An easy, crowd-pleasing "salad." I know it uses popcorn but don't expect any crunching or munching; once you mix in the mayo and ingredients, the popcorn loses its crunch and becomes more of a "pasta substitute." I have another similar recipe for Popcorn Salad that also incorporates apple cider vinegar; I prefer that version to this one; has much more flavor.

I liked this and my husband did as well.  Our kids, surprisingly, didn't care for it.
No chives on hand so I used green onions instead.
I'll probably make this again for a potluck or summer BBQ.

I had a girls night in popcorn and movie night. I made this salad. It got rave reviews, even thought everyone was very suspicious. I made mine with ranch dressing instead of the mayonaise, and omitted the waterchestnuts. It was great!!!! You've seriously have got to try it!!!

Was nervous taking this to a salad luncheon at church, but everyone loved it. I mixed everything together except for the popcorn then stirred that in at the very last, then sprinkled on extra bacon and cheese right before serving. When I went back for seconds, the popcorn had gotten soggy. 
It was a hit and I will make it again.

I made this for my family as it seemed it would be a different and fun salad.  We were not inpressed, sorry!  It tasted like a usual, veggie salad to us and I followed the directions exactly.  I couldn't taste the popcorn and it all but dissapeared under the dressing.  I don't think I'll try this again but I did have high hopes for it!

After seeing this recipe, I knew I HAD to try it.  Even though there was something addicting about this "salad", I do not plan on making again with popcorn.  I think we'll stick to pasta..  Thanks for the very interesting recipe, though...

Very good! I brought it to a family reunion and thought no one would eat it because who heard of popcorn in a salad?  But everyone liked it and it was gone so fast!!

I really liked this! I used light mayo, which cut the calories a bit, and plain popcorn I popped in a paper bag in the mwo. I will be making this a lot! (popcorn is great roughage)

I served this salad to 6 of my family members and we all hated it. Not at all for us!

I love and I am hooked on this salad with a few changes. Other pop corn salads call for sugar and vinegar and that's what is missing in this recipe. I make a double batch so I think I used 2/3 cups of sugar and 1/4 cups of vinegar but I added till I had the taste I wanted. I also added some real onion diced small and use lots of green onion because I love onion. Little tip...instead of frying bacon,  I used Oscar Meyer real bacon bits (honey smoked) the salad was a more tender salad.
