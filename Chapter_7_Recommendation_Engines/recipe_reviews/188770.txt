These were very good! Personally the peppermint was a little too much for me so next time I will probably put half the amount. Also I would like to suggest that instead of the plastic wrap thing just lightly grease a nonstick 9 x 9 and dust with the cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture, pour in and then put mixture on the top as well. It saved lots of time and hassel as the first batch stuck horribly to the spots pf wrap that had no spray! Oh then dust a pizza cutter and cut!

I didn't care for this recipe.  I could taste the gelatin in the marshmallows.  I will not use this recipe again.  The other peppermint marshmallows recipe on this site if far better.

The next time I make these easy marshmallows, I will cut the peppermint back in half.  Otherwise we thought these were really good with hot chocolate, and I will definitely make these again!  Yum!
