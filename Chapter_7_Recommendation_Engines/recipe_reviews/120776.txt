These are really good. There isn't really much dill flavor from the butter on top, but the cheese makes these really stand out. This may be nit-picky, but they're rectangles, not squares. If you want squares, either cut nine or twelve.

I love dill so when I came across this recipe I just had to try them.  They were totally delicious!  I preheated a baking stone and then baked them for 10 minutes.  They were very flaky and tasty.  The only change I made was to use a few shakes of garlic powder as I was out of garlic salt.  I found that I didn't need all of the 4 T. of butter, so next time I will probably melt just 3 T.  And there will be a next time....and a next time....

These were fanastic!  I used butter in place of the shortening and next time I will put some parchment down before baking.  Excellent with soup!  Thanks for sharing!

these were so easy and good. i didnt have any cheddar so i just left it out. i used 3 Tb of butter and garlic powder as another reviewer suggested and it was plenty for the sauce. i let my food processor do most of the work and used a pizza cutter to cut the squares. i wouldnt expect these to feed 12 people because they will want to have more than one each. i served these with beef borscht topped w/sour cream. i cant wait to experiment w/different herbs and spices.

Made these for supper last night and they are so good.  No butter needed for the biscuits.  They are best when fresh.

this is great and super easy!  I didn't do the dill butter since I wanted to do biscuits and gravy, and even without it, the biscuits were delicious!
