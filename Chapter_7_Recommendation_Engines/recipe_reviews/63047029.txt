I had dried crans & white chocolate chips to use up.  Perfect, right?  Well, fresh would be much better; but these were good, too.  I refrigd & ball'd 'em.  Baked for about 14 mins.  They're just a bit cakelike, but not.  They kept their shape pretty much too.  Nice!  Oh, I reduced sugars to 2/3c each & they were still sweet enough.  This made two dozen.  I subbed about 3/4c dried for the fresh, btw.
