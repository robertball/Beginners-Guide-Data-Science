I found this recipe easy enough to make, but it had way too much of a vinegar taste.  The second time I made it I cut down on the vinegar and it was much better.

I halved the vinegar when I made it and it turned out absolutely PERFECT. To keep it from separating, though, Emeril Lagasse says to clarify the butter before adding it. I'll try that next time, since it was very hard to save the leftovers of this sauce :[

This sauce tasted great, but the proportions seemed wrong.  There is way too much butter.  I ended up halfing it, and still had the sauce way too buttery.  Plus the consisitancy didn't seem right cuz the butter oil didn't mix with the rest of the ingrediants.  So on an aesthetic scale, it ranks low, but it still tasted great!  And we're used to having it in France, so that says a lot.  Thanks!

I thought the sauce turned out great! I also decreased the butter to about 3/4 cup and clarified that, so probably ended up with about half a cup. The key to not having your sauce separate is to let the butter cool before you add it. Otherwise, the eggs will solidify, and you have a blend of butter and slightly solid eggs.

Very good...First time making Bearnaise for fish and it was good.  After reading the reviews I was afraid that the vinegar would be too strong so I reduced it by half.  Definately will make again.  Thanks for the post.

I made this on Christmas with Beef Tenderloin (recipe found here). The Bernaise sauce has too strong a vinegar taste and even though I did everything exactly as suggested, it still separated. Back to the drawing board for me. I'll seek another recipe that doesn't contain as much vinegar.
