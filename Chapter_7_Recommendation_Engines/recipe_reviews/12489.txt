I made this for a party...big hit! I used frozen raspberries and some of the juice instead of strawberries. I also doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan, very easy to serve and take!!

The filling is tasty (I added some extra Tequila and Triple Sec for more kick and flavor) but the crust is too salty. I will try it next time using a graham cracker crust.

Pretty good.  The pretzel crust is EXCELLENT.  My pie didn't set up incredibly well... but it tasted good.  I did not find it too alcoholic.  One piece of advice:  This pie has to be served frozen... no on-the-counter time.

I made three desserts for a Mexican themed party and this was a huge hit!  If you prefer sweet and salty tastes, stick to the pretzel crust.  Some of the guests agreed that a graham cracker crust would work well too but the pie would not have that interesting salty balance.  Everyone thought the alcohol was just right (I used Jose Cuervo) however, I bought orange flavored triple sec not knowing that there is a difference between orange liquer and triple sec.  I will definitely make this again.  It is so good and so easy!

I thought this was a great recipe! I made it for a bbq this weekend, and everyone liked it, execpt for the one 16 year old that was there - they just thought it was too "alcohol-y" for them. I think the pretzel crust was surprisingly good. If I were making it where there were going to be alot of kids, I would half the tequila, or omit it all together, and use orange juice or more lime juice. But for me, it was perfect!

tastes just like a margarita--so watch the alcohol content around the kids.   i used a graham cracker crust instead of the pretzels, and everyone at my party thought the pie was absolutely wonderful.  but remember to thaw the pie for a little bit before serving, or it's impossible to cut!

This pie tasted great, but do not use frozen strawberries.  There is too much liquid and when the pie defrosted it was very messy.  I crushed my pretzels in a blender - very easy.  Everyone did like it though.  I might try it again.

I made this pie for an outdoor gathering recently, it was a hit. I would cut back on the tequila a bit, I could definitely taste it. Next time I will layer sliced strawberries in the middle to give the pie a little more substance. Very fun and different!

I made this with the graham cracker crust, kept the liquor amounts the same and got rave reviews!  People who normally don't like tequila liked this pie and didn't even taste the tequila.  I will make this again!

My friend requested this for her birthday, and while I did not taste it myself, she could not stop raving about it.  She said it was EXACTLY how a margarita pie is supposed to taste.  The only changes I made were to use frozen strawberries in place of fresh (and an additional cup at that) and super-creamy Cool Whip in place of the whipped cream.    Thank you for the awesome recipe!!!

This was very good! Made a lot of crust! Had to take a little out in order to fit all the filling. I also baked the crust first at 350 for about 8-10 minutes. Let cool before filling. It was nice and crunchy! Great flavor! I also used only enough butter to moisten. 2/3 cup seemed like a lot. Everyone raved!! I also used cool whip instead of heavy cream because that is what I had. My guests said it was fantastic and very refreshing! Thanks for sharing!

We did not really think it tasted like a margarita. I personally am not fond of frozen strawberries. After all the hype I was dissappointed.

When I got it done, I tasted it and thought it was pretty strong. The flavors mellowed out by the time I served it though. I made it on a Tuesday and didn't end up serving it until Friday, and it was still delicious. I'm making it again tomorrow!

I made this pie this weekend for out of town
guests.  I found that I had too much crust for my
pie plate.  I really loved the taste of the filling.
Next time I am going to make it in a graham cracker
crust.  I thought the pretzel one was too thick.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The amount of crust this recipe made was way too much for my 9" pan. Preparation was very easy although very messy. This pie was VERY strong. I couldnt finish one piece because of the amount of tequila. The only way I could get any of it down was to shoot it.If i make it again I'll be halving the liquor.

THIS PIE IS SUPBERB FOR ADULTS.  IT IS 
NOT SOMETHING YOU WILL WANT TO SERVE TO
YOUR KIDS BECAUSE OF THE LIQUER CONTENT.
I PERSONALLY LOVE ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS
AND MADE IT AS A BIRTDAY PIE FOR A CLOSE
FRIEND WHO LOVES TO DRINK MARGARITAS. SHE
LOVED IT AND SAID "CERTAINLY NOT THE
TRADITIONAL BIRTHDAY CAKE." IT FIT RIGHT
IN WITH THE MARGARITA COCKTAIL CANDLE I
GOT HER AS A GIFT.  A VERY PLEASANT CHANGE
OF PACE THAT WAS QUICK AND EASY TO FIX.

No complaints or problems with this delicious pie. This pie did soften quickly but it has a healthy amount of alcohol in it - that's not the recipe's fault, alcohol doesn't freeze like most other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and while 2 bowls and the layering was a little putzy, it was gorgeous when I finished. I made no substitutions or changes. I whipped my own cream, used fresh limes and strawberries, and used top shelf alcohol - all were important to the quality and are key in this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing :)

WAY too much filling--I could've made two pies!  Also, the tequilla and orange liquor need to be doubled in order to really get the taste.

Some girlfriends and myself made this pie for a birthday get together...tons of fun.  It is colorful, refreshing, and capable of making any get together much more fun.  We later made a second batch of the filling with cool whip to dip fruits in.  AMAZING!

This is a great recipe.  Every time we got to a BBQ, my husband requests that I take this.  It really is a tastey recipe.  (We do make it with fresh straw berries and also did the pretzel crust as recommended.)  VERY GOOD!!

This was very refreshing.  I loved the suggestion of "salt around the rim" from the salty pretzel crust!

I made this pie the night before I needed it, and let it thaw out in the fridge the morning of the bbq.  It thawed out a little to much, and was very messy to serve, but it tasted excellent.  I have never had such a refreshing dessert.

I tried this pie on Memorial Day weekend and all my friends loved it and wanted the recipe.  Wonderful way to end a meal on a hot summer day.  It's good anytime.

So very simple and good too.  I couldn't help but lick the bowls!

I modified it a bit using what I had on hand.  I used whipping cream for the strawberry bottom layer, and used Cool-Whip for the top layer. The result was a denser layer on the bottom and a lighter layer on the top.  Worked just as good!

I have never had such a great pie. So easy to prepare.
I used  my marble rolling pin to crush the pretzels 
in a ziplock bag. 
Not only can you use strawberries but you can use
blackberries, peaches,any frsh fruit.
Very creamy and refreshing.

Really a great tasting dessert and it is easy to make.  (I added just 1/2 of the alcohols, however.)  Defrost time is the ONLY issue with this recipe.  My only recommendation would be to take out about 35 minutes prior to serving.  The top will be a bit messy but that is much better than trying to eat it frozen where the creaminess and various flavours do not really come through.  I tried it with a 7-minute thaw and it just tasted "cold".  I did not use the food colorings at all.  It looked fine as is in the pan.  Next time I will dice strawberries to (maybe) help it thaw more quickly.

This pie is great for a gathering of adults, don't let the kids sneak a bite! Everyone is really surprised when they bite into this fabulous pie.  You'll hear lots about how refreshing, cool, citrusy, and "intoxicating" it is!!!  You'll spend the whole evening giving out the recipe!
