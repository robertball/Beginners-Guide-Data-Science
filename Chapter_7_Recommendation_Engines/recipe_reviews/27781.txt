Flavorful, satisfying and easy to make. The chicken ended up with a wonderful fall-apart texture that I usually associate with braised red meat. Highly recommended.

NB: Either make your own chicken broth or use "low sodium" broth in order to avoid a very salty dish. You can always taste it and add more salt while cooking. Remember that if the liquid reduces by half on the stove, it will be twice as salty as it was originally, and most canned chicken broths are too salty in the first place!

Unlike many other reviewers, my chicken and its sauce was not salty.  And mine took a lot less cooking time.  If you reduce 64 ounces (a half gallon!) of broth to a stew-like consistency of course its going to be salty,  not to mention it's going to take forever to cook down!  I used half the amount of chicken broth called for.  I cooked it at fairly high heat rather than a simmer, and didn't return the chicken to the pan until it was almost the consistency I was after, tho' I did add a little cornstarch slurry to give the sauce some viscosity. As for seasoning, I wanted more than just the salt and pepper called for before dredging the chicken in the flour, so I gave it a good sprinkle of Montreal Chicken Seasoning as well, which worked well with the thyme (I used fresh).  This was delicious.  A simple mirepoix (or soffritto in Italian) was transformed into something sublime - and it took about half an hour from start to finish.  I served this over rice alongside steamed zucchini.

This recipe turned out very tasty, but I thought it was a little salty.  But as I was cooking it, my roommate and my Fiancé kept asking when it was going to be done, because it smelled so good.  While they were eating it, my roommate said: "It's soooo good!  I'm really full now, but I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!"  I make dinner for them every night, and it's the first time he's ever said that!  My Fiancé also personally made sure that I printed out the recipe so that I could make it again!

Fantastic Sauce!  This recipe was such a hit, plus my house smelled fantastic from the sauce simmering.  Really effortless to make, do not cut corners though simmer that sauce for the 90 minutes, its worth it.

This was soo good! It does take a long time to cook, but it is so worth it. I didn't add any salt to the dish and used low sodium chicken broth as other reviewers said and it had the perfect amount of flavor. My sauce did get thick on its own, no need for thickeners. The flavor was great and the dish was easy, though time consuming. I will definitely make this again, I served it over mashed potatoes and everyone enjoyed it.

PS Do not try to make this in the slow cooker... not the same.

Wonderful recipe to have on hand. I changed just a few things. I cut my chicken breasts (3 good sized - boneless, skinless) on the bias in thick strips. I knew I wanted to mix in pasta so I needed the chicken to be smaller. I actually returned the chicken to the pot after cooking the mirepoix and let everything go on low for 2 hours. I used half the stock called for (a reduced sodium brand after reading the other comments) to create a thicker consistency. I cooked off 8 oz of radiatore pasta and mixed it all together. I topped it with  grated Pecorino Romano cheese for added bite and with the rest of the bottle of wine, my husband and I had a fantastic meal.

Excellent. Because I hadn't read any reviews before I tried this recipe I did add salt to the sauce and it was on the salty side, but definitely not overpowering. Instead of cooking the chicken before I made the sauce, I cooked the chicken while the sauce was simmering and ended up saving some time overall. The sauce didn't quite thicken as much as I expected so I added a little flour paste which gave it more of a gravy-like consistency. The recipe was a great hit and I can't wait to make it again.

Absolutely delicious. My husband would complement me after every bite. I love it that it has this delicious, thick gravy that you don't have to make with butter, flour and cream. I followed ingredients exactly. For salt and pepper to taste, I added 1/2 tsp of each. Since I used store-bought broth, next time I'll nix all the extra salt (for chicken and for sauce). Simmered exactly how long they suggested but it was still too watery so I boiled it on high for another 30 minutes (on top of the 120 minutes) and it was perfect. The chicken is amazingly tender and the flavor of it all is superb. We served it over mashed potatoes and were sooooo pleased.

This was really really salty!
Also I had tons of broth, it never thickened or became stew-like. 
It did have a good flavor and I saved all the broth to use a a base for chicken noodle soup.

I am giving this receipe five stars because it was very good THE DAY AFTER for leftovers.  I initially followed the recipe to the T (I did not use salt at all based on the reviews and simply used swansons chicken broth, the full amt. called for in the recipe) and ended up with a soup/broth like consistency which with mashed potatoes, was a bit strange to eat, yet the flavor was good.  I cooked for a total of 2.5 hours and hoped that the flour used in browning the chicken would thicken the broth but it did not happen.  HOWEVER, when I warmed this up in the oven the day after, the onions seemed to evaporate into the broth and glazed into a nice gravy which was soo good with the potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe..

I added a can of crushed tomatoes and used white pepper, rosemary, and a little cumin in addition to the other spices.  I also brought the sauce to a boil, threw in the chicken that I had seared, and finished it off in the oven for two hours at 350.  I also added a leek, and reduced the broth by half cup due to the liquid in the tomatoes.  Huge flavor!

This is very, very good, even though I am only giving it four stars. I followed the recipe exactly and it is just way too salty. I wish I had read the other reviews before I made this dish. I would have used low-sodium broth. I also cooked it an extra 30 minutes and it never did become stew-like. Next time I will thicken the sauce before serving. All in all, however, it is a great recipe! Thanks!

I used homemade chicken broth and less salt and this still turned out rather salty.  Otherwise it was very delicious!  Broth was rather soupy so I had to add some cornstarch but I used leftover broth for my chicken soup.  I will definately make this again.

I tried this recipe a few days ago and my normally picky family loved it.  I followed the recipe all the way through, except, I put my chicken back into the pan within an hour of simmering, instead of 90 minutes, which made the chicken so moist and tender.  The flavor was perfect and my entire house smelled so good.  I served this delicious dish over mexican rice.  Excellent recipe.

Because this is a reduction recipe, use unsalted (better) or low-salt broth, and adjust the salt after the reduction.  Otherwise, this will be too salty.

This chicken was rather tasty and did not turn out salty because I adjusted the recipe a bit after reading everyone elses review. I only used two (2) 10 oz cans of chicken broth and let it simmer for 30 minutes instead of 90 minutes. Also, I only put salt on the chicken...not in the pan. I only gave it 3 stars because I already have a recipe that taste similar and this one is not as outstanding as that one. I will probably make this again.

Apart from taking a lot of time for the preparation I did  not find this dish especially satisfying. The chicken was very tender, but the sauce was not exactly a good sauce to go with the pasta. My girlfriend thought it was okay, but I would probably not cook it again.

I made this today and my husband loved it. I used bone in chicken breast,did not season with salt. Once I braised the chicken and cooked the veges, I added the remaining flour and made a roux before adding the wine and broth(I used 6 cups of broth). It made a beautiful thick sauce and we had it over mashed potatoes. We will be making this again !! Thank you for the wonderful recipe

This is by far the best thing I've found to do with boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  If you're wondering what it tastes like, to me it's a lot like really good homemade chicken noodle soup... without the noodles and a little thicker.  I read the other reviews before I made it, and the only change I made besides scaling the recipe down, was to cut the chicken broth in half and then made up the difference with water.  It got a little thick on me about 30 minutes out when I added the chicken, and I just added some more water and let it cook until the consistency was to my liking and lowered the sodium enough to where I ended up adding a touch more for my tastes.

This is one of my favorite dishes.  The flavors are amazing.  Just don't cook the chicken too long, as it will get dry.  I served with mashed potatos.

Straightforward but very nice.  Served with acini de pepe with butter, parmesan, and fresh parsley.  Made a few adjustments.  Used bone-in chicken.  Used butter rather than olive oil.  Cut the broth in half.  Thickened the liquid with a little cornstarch.    Overall thought it was very tasty.  But I always love anything braised.

Oh my! So Good.  I used "Kitchen Basics" brand chicken stock because it actually has LESS sodium than the 40% reduced sodium chicken broth, plus I think it added a depth of flavor.  Other than that made the recipe exactly as written.  I served it with no yolk "Reames" brand egg noodles (from the frozen foods aisle).  Low-fat comfort food, who knew?!?  Added bonus: one pot meal.

I never add salt to a recipe, so I had no problems with excess.  It's tasty, full of the things I like best, and I can hardly wait to try it with boneless, skinless thighs.  We served over radiatore, and my wife said it was a keeper.  The kids, of course, will eat anything.

Unfortunately, this dish was tooooo salty.  I didn't add any salt and it was still too much.  The vegetables just sucked the salt up from the broth and the salt taste was overpowering.  Maybe only one can of broth and one can of water instead of two cans of broth.  Probably won't redux.

This is delicious, easy french cooking. Be careful how much you salt the veggies - the saltiness intensifies as it reduces.

Chicken was pretty good.  The family didn't care for the sauce and veggies.  That was too bad since it took a little over 2 hrs to make.

Excellent comfort food.  Turned out just delicious We agree that no extra salt is needed in this recipe.  We enjoyed it very much and not very fatty.  The only fat is the olive oil and you can control that.  My husband has to watch his fats and we found this to be a very excellent dish.  We added red skin potatoes to the pot mid way I think and that was a delicious addition.  Wonderful.  We would HIGHLY recommend it .  Very good indeed. We had it with crusty Italian bread and a glass of red wine and it was a meal made for company.

My husband raved and raved about this one.  I also modified the recipe a bit - I halved it for the two of us and then added only 16oz chicken stock and simmered for 30 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.  Also, our grocery sells "Mirepoix" already diced in our produce section.  If you make this, check and see if your local grocer also provides this convenience :-)

We loved this recipe!  I used low sodium broth.  I thought I'd use a high simmer (not a boil) in order to ensure a reduced sauce.  Mistake.  A low simmer really would've been better.  It reduced so much after 90 minutes, when I added the chicken to the pan, there wasn't enough liquid to cover them.  Not even close.  I had to hand baste during the last 30 minutes.  Because it reduced so much, it was salty (but that was my fault for reducing it too much).  I added a chopped potato to the sauce for the last 15 minutes, and that did help reduce the saltiness.  We served it over rice.  We're adding this one into the menu rotation!  I will follow the directions next time.  Thank you, Gordon!

To the people complaining that the sauce never thickened or became "stew-like": did you cover the pot to simmer it?  Because if you did, guess what?  That sauce has nowhere to evaporate so it's not going to reduce one bit.  This is also why attempting this in a crock pot will fail - there's nowhere for the sauce to evaporate.  

To the people complaining that the sauce was too salty: did you use commercially prepared chicken stock/broth versus making your own?  Because if so you need to take into account the fact that those broths already have TONS of salt in them so you don't need to season as much, merely season the chicken breasts, don't add salt to the mirepoix.

Hope this helps the people who had issues because done properly this recipe is solid.

Excellent! I tried the recipe as it was, didn't add or modify it and it turned out so well. It was a hit with everyone at home and left over was a great Monday lunch at work. Being a budding home-cook, this is an excellent dish to try.

This was great. My family prefers thighs and drumsticks so I used these, bone in/skin as a substitute. Cooked low and slow, covered in the oven for about 90 minutes and it was wonderful. Kids fought over leftovers, even with the carrots!

This easy stew reminds me of country French cooking methods. I didn't have a dry white wine; I used a Reisling. Topped it with dumplings made from the "Dumplings" recipe at this site submitted by Carol. It was delicious, and the dumplings thickened it perfectly.

I found that it’s prefect as written but I added a  bit of Savory and a pick of poultry season (homemade). I also used a high quality bone marrow stock. Mans are light salt or no salt. I found when using stock if it’s cheap stuff it’s always loaded with salt. I double this recipe and add 4 organic large boneless thighs and it comes out delish. I serve with a root veg risotto and roasted Brussels sprouts. It’s a great meal when it cold and doesn’t take up a lot of time.

This was seriously delish!!!  The only changes I made were I upped the wine to almost a full cup (we only cooked 2 breasts)and made sure to use low sodium broth.  It was still a bit salty so I won't use any added salt to the chicken (didn't use any in the pan after reading all the reviews).  We loved it, thickened up nicely so no need for any thickener.. definite keeper!  Served over a mix of long grain & wild rice. Thanks!

I have made this dish a few times now and it always is a hit! It's a long process but definitely worth it. The last thirty minutes of simmering the chicken in the mixture makes it like butter to cut into! I serve this by placing the chicken on top of mashed potatoes and spoon the mixture over it. Yum!

I followed all the instructions but did not end up with a stew-like sauce. It remained thin and broth-like. Oh well, it still tasted wonderful. My husband loved it and my 4-year-old asked for seconds!

I don't usually  takethe time to rate recipes but this one was so delicious I had to do it.   I even messed up by adding the chicken broth BEFORE the white wine and it was still 5 stars worthy.   My husband and I watch our calories and was happy to see we can easily work this in to our daily calorie goals.

Yum!!! Just made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit. I did everything according to the recipe except left out the bay leaves (personal preference) and only used one quart of chicken broth. Chicken was fork tender and the mirepoix was such a yummy topping. I used an apple Riesling wine. It is a bit time consuming but not difficult at all. Thank you for a new idea for dinner ~ will definitely make again when I want to impress our dinner guests.

Made this for our Christmas dinner today and it was fantastic.  My first two tries weren't as good but I think I finally got it.  I did change a few things. I added no salt.  Didn't need it, when the broth reduces it has just enough salt. I cut my chicken into bite size pieces, about 1 inch cubes. I added my pepper directly to the flour, mixing it before dredging my chicken in the flour. I added my potatoes the same time as the broth and chicken.  Did not cover the dish while simmering and it gave the ragout a stew like consistency when finished.

I made this recipe as is the first time and the second time I had the broth (reduced sodium) reduce and then added 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  Both times it was salty.  Luckily I did not add salt to the mashed potatoes I made this with so that detracted from the saltiness of the dish.  Overall very tasty but on the salty side, hence the four star rating as opposed to 5.  In the future, I'll be sure to use homemade broth.

I think I have to say that I really didn't "get" this recipe.  I followed it exactly as written but ended up cooking it for around three hours.  The broth never thickened much, so I ended up with something that wasn't soup and wasn't stew.  It's basically just boiled chicken breasts in broth with vegetables.  Mine was also very salty - I wouldn't add more salt (broth has plenty).  The chicken itself had OK flavor and was very tender, but I am not sure what to do with the sauce.  My two cents.

This tasted great. I especially liked the sauce over mashed potatoes as so many other reviewers talked about. The prep was kind of annoying, but the end result was fabulous. I'd give it 5 stars, but my partner had a whatever rating. "Good," she said, "but if you didn't make it again I wouldn't care." My kids 2.5 and 4.5 also liked it and the leftovers were delicious. One thing I did different was barely use salt. I used a homemade broth also.

This dish was very good but I found it to be salty.  I have cooked with canned chicken broth in the past and haven't found the soup I made overly salty.  I think that the longer you cook the chicken broth the more the saltiness comes out.  I would make this again but use reduce sodium chicken broth.
