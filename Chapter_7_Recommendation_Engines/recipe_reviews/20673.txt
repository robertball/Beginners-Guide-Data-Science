HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: The idea of putting 2 pieces of bread on the bottom of the pan before cooking to soak up the grease is GOD SEND! Works like a charm, and you can remove it when you slice everyone their piece.  BUT I also take it out at the 1hr mark and drain the excess liquid.  I double the sauce, but only to drizzle on top of everyone's slice since my kids&husband like to slather their meatloaf w/ketchup.  When I do double the topping, I add 1T lemon juice OR 1T balsamic vinegar for yummiest topping! Substitute bread for 3/4C oats & use green onions instead of onions if you've got picky eaters.  Sometimes I dice green peppers too for more flavor.  If you haven't tried "Honey Roasted Red Potatoes" I'd recommend trying them along side, and you're sure to be everyone's best friend. All my picky eaters tell me I'm the greatest cook ever due to everyone's great reviews!  This meatloaf was liked by everyone over the two other top rated ones on this site! I also make them in muffin cups and just baked at 375 for 30 min.

Yum!! This recipe makes an excellent meatloaf. My son and husband love meatloaf, so I've been trying various recipes to see which one they like the best. After tasting this for dinner last night, they both said don't try any more, this one is the best! As for substitutions, I added 3/4 c. of oats in place of the bread, and used balsamic vinegar in place of the lemon juice. Next time I will try the lemon juice, but the vinegar worked fine and I happened to be out of lemons. Oh, one great tip that I got from another reviewer is to line the bottom of your 9x5 pan with bread slices when making a meatloaf. The bread soaks up all the fat and then you just throw the bread away. Works great!

My family was craving meat so I desided to make them meatloaf. I didnt have any beef bouillon so I added a pinch of garlic powder to add flavor. I also didnt have bread so I substituted that for a cup of oats. Dry mustard was traded in for yellow mustard. I've hated meatloaf for as long as I can remember but what I made last night was excellent. The glaze made all the difference, it was amazing. After reading the reviews I made a double batch of glaze and it covered the loaf beautifully. Definatly a keeper!

This is a great meatloaf and my family loves it as much as I do. What I changed is I don't wait until the end to put the glaze on top. What I do is preheat the oven to 325 and put the meatloaf in w/o the glaze for 10 minutes, then i glaze it and insert a oven safe thermometer and cook the meatloaf to 155. Comes out perfect everytime. I also use just plain unseasoned breadcrumbs instead of whole slices of bread shredded. 

Also I forgot to add that I do not cook it in a loaf pan. I form the loaf in the pan then take it out and put it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Keeps the meatloaf from collecting all the fat runoff.

Delicious! I just made this after trying, without great satisfaction, 3 other meatloaf recipes. This is moist, but not greasy at all! The lemon added a wonderful touch without being overpowering at all. I love the topping, and have made other glazes like it, but never thought to add lemon juice. My husband normally will grin and bear meatloaf night. Not this time. He loved it so much that there aren't any leftovers for a meatloaf sandwich in my lunch tomorrow! I highly recommend this great recipe!!! The only thing I did differently is add 1/4 cup French's Fried Onions crumbled up into it because I don't like chopping onions.

Amazing! I have made this so many times.  I use 7 grain bread (which my hubby hates) and he doesn't even notice.  To save time I also make them in muffin cups and cook them at 375 for 30 minutes.  I always serve them with mashed potatoes... isn't that how meatloaf is always served??  Enjoy!

Let me just say, this meatloaf is DELICIOUS! Before making this recip I had never been a fan of ANY meatloaf except my fiance's mothers which is very similiar, but after making this, both myself and my fiance agreed it is the best meatloaf we've ever  had. I always substitute the bread slices for 1 cup of breadcrumbs,and it turns out great! It's moist, hearty, and delicious! I serve it with mashed potatoes, and I always make more sauce for this one because we love it saucy! Makes great leftovers for the next days lunch too!

This was very good!  I soaked the bread in milk first before adding to the meat!  I also added garlic.  If you are using a convection oven, you can cook for 50 mins and then put the topping on for 10 mins!  Very moist and very good!

I adjusted this recipe following sd's directions.  Next time I will follow exactly as is as last reviewer did.  Mine came out with wonderful flavor and very moist.  Only thing off was that I like a crispy crust on my meat loaf...we fight over the ends.  This was just a bit too moist.  I think what happened is that I increased the sauce per everyone's suggestion, and then still included 1/3 of it in with the meat.  In retrospect, I probably should have not put that much of the sauce in with meat.  Still, this was very very good and smelled wonderfully.  My kids loved as well.  Served with fried potatoes with onion, and a tossed salad, and a glass of chianti.

I've been looking for a good meatlof recipie for awhile and after reading some of the other reviews, I tweaked this a bit and it turned out great.  I used lime instead of lemon juice, 1/2 pkg of cornbread stuffing mix instead of shredded bread, and a couple dashes of worchestershire, soy and tobasco instead of bouillon.  It was moist and flavorful.  My husband loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again!

HOLY COW this was good! My husband and I kept saying how much we enjoyed it. Like other reviewers suggested, I used 3/4 cup oats in place of the bread. I also couldn't find my loaf pan, so I did meatloaf muffins and will probably always do it like that! I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and then spread the remaining sauce over them and then cooked them for just 5 more minutes to make sure they wouldn't come out too dry. They were so yummy and easy. Also, I doubled the onion. I plan on freezing the remaining muffins to eat some other time. YUM!

This coming from a person who HATES meatloaf: this was GREAT. I did some tweaking to make it suit me and my bf but overall this was a great recipe. I added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and probably a cup of shredded cheese and substituted oats for bread. Other than that, followed recipe as is and was absolutely amazed how good this was!

I think this meatloaf was pretty good. It did seem to be a little dry when cooked according to these directions. I think if I attempted to make it again I would double the amount of glaze. Not the best meatloaf that I have ever had, but it is worth a try.

My husband and daughter really like this meatloaf recipe. (I am a vegetarian). I am always looking for new recipes to try, but they don't want me making any other meatloaf recipes. They feel this is THE ONE!!!

The only change I make is to use 3/4 cup bread crumbs instead of bread. I also like to double the sauce to have extra for serving.

So, I made a couple changes, but nothing TOO major (at least in my opinion)...

1) Used 1# lean ground beef and 1# spicy Italian sausage

2) Sauteed the onions (used 1 small, diced).  I also sauteed 2 garlic cloves with them, and some mushrooms I needed to use up (diced them so they would blend in with the meat).  I also finely grated a carrot to add some extra vitamins and fiber.

3) I used 1/2 c quick-cooking oatmeal instead of the bread

4) I forgot to add the lemon juice into the meat mixture (too many things going on at the time, I guess!)

5) I made a single recipe of the glaze and used Balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice, because we LOVE balsamic.  I accidentally glazed it at the beginning before I put it in the oven, but it turned out great...The glaze really became a GLAZE...it got a little caramelized on top, and got really thick...DELICIOUS!

I used my probe thermometer for the cooking time...stuck it in and set the alarm for 165F.  I think it took about an hour. (Uncovered the whole time)

I have a special "meat loaf pan" insert that you put into a loaf pan.  It has holes in it to let the fat drain out, and it sits about 1/2 inch above the bottom of the loaf pan.  This always works great!  I got mine at William Somona--a little pricey, but a GREAT investment if you love making meatloaf!

All-in-all, it turned out WONDERFUL with the changes I made.  I'm making again tonight with turkey instead of beef. 

Also, it made fabulous sandwiches the next few days!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I thougt the recipe I was using up until now was good but this one was GREAT.  I doubled the amount of the glaze as suggested and used it as a side dipping sauce.  This will definately be my new meatloaf recipe . Thanks for sharing...

I have made this recipe at least 10 times! I made a few substitutions.... I used 7 whole grain bread and to save on time, I used a package of onion soup mix in place of the beef boullion and onions. This is a great recipe to make ahead of time and freeze for later use. Comes out perfect everytime! The family loves it!!

This is the only recipe I use for meatloaf - love it!  I cut the sugar a little - usually use only 1/4 cup (did it without the sugar once on accident, and it still tasted great!).  When I have A1 on hand I like to substitute it for some or all of the ketchup, so yummy!!  Two standard substitutions for me are: 1) use ground pork for half of the meat, 2) use 1/4 cup oatmeal in place of the breadcrumbs.

Absolutely the best meatloaf recipe found to date. The entire family raved about this one, even my picky youngest! The glaze is spectacular! Only changes I made was to add some garlic powder and worcestershire sauce to the meat mix. I also cooked it formed in a 13 x 9 pan instead of a loaf pan to allow extra room for grease run off.  Turned out perfectly moist and yet not mushy!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have ever made! Very moist but not mushy. Perfect consistency and flavor. I subbed 1 c. Italian bread crumbs for the bread and added 2 eggs instead of 1.

This recipe was really good.  I have not made meatloaf for a while and thought I would try it last night for dinner.  My family loved it and wants me to make it again tonight.  My 3 yr old even ate it and wanted more. The only thing I did different was I added 1 cup of oats instead of the slices of bread and I didn't have any dry mustard, so I used 3/4 tsp regular mustard.  I also doubled the sauce so there was plenty to put across the meatloaf for the last 10 min that it finished cooking.  This will be a keeper for sure.

I had never made meatloaf before. This was an easy and delicious loaf, very moist but still held together. I never have been a big meatloaf fan, but I would definitely make this again.,

The best meatloaf to date. Usually my meatloaf falls apart. Loved the idea of the bread on the bottom to soak up the grease. Really loved the sauce. I did however add green peppers, onion and sage to my meatloaf.

Add finely chopped veggies to the loaf.  SO worth it!  I just chopped up two carrots and half of a green pepper and added two minced garlic cloves.  My husband who loves meatloaf and considers himself a kind of connoisseur told me this was the best meatloaf he's ever had.  I'm on the biggest ego high right now.

I made this and liked the consistency of the meatloaf but we tasted LEMON in the sauce and it was not a good pairing.  I was really disappointed since the reviews were so good.  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and followed the recipe exactly.  Someone else used balsamic vinegar as a replacement.  I would recommend replacing the lemon juice with the balsamic vinegar.

This was by far the best meatloaf ever! I made it this past Sunday for our family dinner and by the end there was no meatloaf left. I never thought of putting lemon juice or brown sugar in the glaze. Boy was I surprised at how good it tasted. I made extra to put on the table in case anyone wanted more and it too was gone. Will surely be making this again. Delicious!

This is an awesome recipe.  I have made it for several family members and have always got rave reviews, even from those that have said "I don't like meatloaf".  It is the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top that puts the pizzazz in the meal.

I have been using this recipe for about 4 years now. It was one of the first ones I ever bookmarked on A.R. and I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed it until now. Well, maybe because I don't have to look it up anymore to make it (I know it by heart!) I LOVE this recipe! My entire family loves to eat this - including the young ones! We eat it at least once a month. Since I don't keep dry, I make this with prepared mustard, and wheat bread slices.

GREAT recipe!! I used 24 saltine crackers (1 cup cracker crumbs) for the filler instead and substituted white vinegar for the lemon juice. I used the glaze for the last 10-15 minutes (carefully check the glaze as it will blacken and blister very quickly!!). I also sliced it with an electric knife (one of my favorite kitcken tools)to make nicely smooth slices. SEE MY PHOTO!! TY Delia!!

This was awesome!  I added 3/4 a cup of bread crumbs instead of bread, a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and an extra egg.  I had to go to work, I decided to try this in my slow cooker.  I lined the crock with tin foil and placed two piece of bread on the bottom before placing the meat in the pot.  The bread tip is genius, because it absorbed most of the grease.  I cooked it on low for six hours, and it was delicious and moist.  It never fell apart either, even when I took it from the pot.  I'm definitely making this one again.

This meatloaf is great!  I have made it several times and it always has good flavor to it.  I like to add about a 1/2 tsp minced garlic and I love to make some extra sauce to pour on top of it!  Soooo yummy!!

I have made this meatloaf as written and for me, it's a four star recipe.  Everyone is picky about meatloaf.  Personally, I don't like the large chunks of bread in the meatloaf, but the flavor is fantastic.  This has become my base recipe for meatloaf and I make a few changes for taste and dietary reasons.  I substitute oats for the bread (1/2 cup per 1lb of beef).  I also omit the beef bouillon cube and instead season with garlic powder, salt, pepper and cumin and add a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  The recipe with the bouillon has great flavor, but bouillon has a lot of unnatural ingredients that I try to avoid.  I also add extra onion and a squirt of mustard.  Finally, before topping with the glaze and returning to the oven, I drain any excess grease out of the pan.  As written, this recipe does not disappoint.  This is just how I like my meatloaf.

Tastes great and texture was perfect.  Followed the recipe except for the bread slices.  Instead of bread slices, I used 1 Cup of breadcrumbs mixed with about 3-4 Tbs of milk.  Doubled the recipe of the glaze so that I would have enough of it to bake on top.  My family loved this.  This will be my "go-to" meatloaf recipe from now on.  Thanks!

I am 44 yrs old and have never made meatloaf before.  I don't really like meatloaf but my husband does and has been begging for it for years.  I decided to give this one a try.  The directions were easy to follow and it was easy to prepare.  When I took my first tentative bite I was shocked by what my mouth reported to my brain.  I ate three slices.  My husband, having experienced the goodness of his Mom's meatloaf, told me it was the best he's ever tasted.  The look on his face as he ate it confirmed he wasn't saying it just to save my feelings.  Excellent!  Thank you!

I don't really LOVE meatloaf but this was really good.  The changes I made were...I used regular mustard because I didn't have any other and in place of bread I used oats, I used another reviewers suggestion for replacing the bullion cube with 1 tsp worchestire sauce, garlic powder, and dash of tabasco (great suggestion).  This turned out so flavorful and moist.  This glaze makes all the difference you'll want to be sure to double the glaze, it's that good and do 1/2 c ketchup and 1/2 c bbq sauce instead of all ketchup.  YUMMMMM!

Love this meatloaf!  My husband asks for it all the time, too.  The only change I made was that I use 2 slices of whole grain bread instead of 3. Also, I cook up bacon while the loaf is cooking, then add it to the top during the last 10 min. I also make extra sauce since the hubby loves it so much. Thanks for this great addition to my recipe book!

Loved this recipe!!!!!  Big hit with the family!!!!  I used minced onion and meatloaf mix; beef, pork and veal freshly ground.  I don't like using boullion; too much sodium, so I substituted it with crumbled turkey bacon.  Delicious!!!!!  Will make again!

Yum! The glaze is a great addition. I added a little cayenne pepper and black pepper to the meat before baking it to add a little spice.

I must admit i seasoned my ground meat the way I wanted it, bell pepper, onion, black pepper, etc..but the main thing I followed on this recipe was the glaze for the top...It was amazing...i didnt have any dry mustard so i substituted it with regular mustard not alot and it came out great...i thought it was going to be sweet but my husband loved it..because i made it out of meatballs instead of meatloaf i would cook it for 45mins instead of 1hr...will definitely use this again

Made this tonight for dinner and the entire family declared this a winner!  The only substitution I made was using 3/4 cup bread crumbs for the 3 slices of bread.  Thank you for posting this delicious recipe!

This was excellent Meatloaf. Made it for my grandparents and Grandpa said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had! Super easy to make. I followed other posts on putting bread at bottom of loaf pan which is great but you still have to drain the fat. Also, take other's advice to make additional sauce to put on table - you won't regret it. I made with Garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. Delish!

Made it exactly as written.  Everyone raved over it!  I thought it would be bland because of a lack of spices but it was full of flavour.  I drained the grease as suggested after an hour and the meatloaf came out moist and delicious.  This will become a regular in my home.

The sauce is very good but my husband and I found the meat a bit bland.  I gave it 5 stars because the meat is tender and overall it is very tasty but I think we like something a bit more savory. I will keep the sauce and use it on a more savory version of the meat.  Something with garlic, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  One reviewers tip to use bread in the bottom of the pan was GENIUS.  I did meatloaf muffins and cut little circles out of sliced bread using the 1/3 cup measuring cup as a cookie cutter, just remove from the bottom before serving, it soaks up all the grease.  Such a helpful tip

I usually make a different meatloaf recipe but decided to give this one a shot, and I'm glad I did! My fiance said it was awesome, and he loved the topping. The only thing I did differently was to use bread crumbs in the place of slices of bread. Yummy!

I modified the recipe to make it a bit healthier and used wheat bread, splenda brown sugar and used 1 lb turkey and 1 lb 90% lean ground beef and it was awesome.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he has ever had.

Excellent prepared as listed, I have made this several times and it is my family's favorite!  Yesterday I didn't have bouillon or onions so I subsituted with Beefy onion dry soup instead of the beef bouillon and diced onions. Still YUMMY!

Meatloaf is something my husband always looks forward to, and he loved this one.  I even had to make it without the onion (how did I let myself run out??)!  I added a little ground pork to the mix but otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I would definitely start adding the sauce a little at a time to the top while it is baking because I prefer a more baked-in topping.  Nice recipe.  Thanks!

I made no changes in this recipe and it came out perfectly.  My only complaint was not having enough left-over for more than one sandwich today!!!  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would - it's really THAT great!

My husband and I loved this meatloaf. My pickier kids still wanted extra ketchup, but we all loved the glaze with it. I -almost- made it exactly as said, except I did use 1/2 cup bread crumbs for the shredded bread slices(I halved the recipe) and I actually made 4 small rectangle shaped loaves and just cooked them on a cookie sheet. This cut the cooking time down to probably around 45 minutes total, but could possibly be less because I didn't check earlier. I put the glaze on after about 20 minutes. Next time I will try cooking on foil or parchment paper because these really stuck to the metal. I also only had bouillon cubes that wouldn't crumble, so I actually microwaved it in the lemon juice to dissolve it. I had to add lemon juice by the time it fully dissolved to have the correct amount of lemon juice after it kept evaporating slightly in the microwave. I also accidentally doubled the dry mustard and I don't know how it would taste with the correct amount, but double was delicious! Just writing the review makes me want some more!

Read all the reviews and based on them and the meatloaf recipe I have been using for years I created the best meatloaf me or my husband ever tasted.  Cut the recipe in half since just the two of us.  Used ground pork instead of beef.  Modified version used 1 tablespoon brown sugar in glaze, 1 teaspoon lemon and I added 1 tablespoon A1 steak sauce.  Omitted beef bouillon and lemon juice in meat portion.  Grated frozen bread rather than shred.  Added 1 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 clove garlic pressed, about 2 or 3 skinless baby carrots chopped finely, about 1/4 both green and red bell peppers, diced and salt and pepper.  Also sprayed baking dish with PAM before placing meat mixture in there.
It turned out incredible!  Hubby who most of the time says he doesn't care what we eat was in awe of this dish.  By the way, had no problem with excess fat - there wasn't any - maybe ground pork made the difference.

My fiancé's favorite main dish by far, he says this is my specialty. The only thing I change it I leave out the lemon juice because he doesn't like lemon juice at all. I would advise to not substitute the shredded bread for bread crumbs; when I tried that, I felt it made the meatloaf too dry.

I have never made meatloaf EVER! This looked delicious so I thought I would try it out. I followed the recipe as written using bread crumbs and lining the bottom of the loaf pan with bread to absorb the grease. I had to cook it almost an hour and half because it was "loose" and not formed. Eventually I took it out because it was "done" but it never formed into a loaf and it was more like sloppy joes. I am giving this recipe 4 stars because the taste was delicious, but looks count, especially for kids, and mine wouldn't eat it because it didn't "look good."

I love this recipe but I did change it up a bit. I halved the amount of ketchup and made it up with salsa. Used only a tbls of brown sugar. I added seasoning salt, Worcestershire sauce and a grated carrot. I ommited the beef bouillon. I also use  whole grain bread crumbs. It was delicious.

Our son has Celiacs disease and cannot have gluten. I omitted the bread and replaced it with a cup of crushed corn flakes.  This recipe was a big hit with the family.  It is one of the best meatloaf recipes that I've ever tried.

Wow, I loved this meatloaf. I used 1/2 panko and 1/2 oats instead of bread and I used Dijon mustard instead of dried mustard in the sauce. I was afraid it wasn't enough sauce so, I added 1/4 cup more of ketchup and 1/4 cup of maple brown sugar bbq sauce. 

It came out sooo moist and delicious! My husband absolutely loved it.

This meatloaf is amazing.  It is moist and flavorful.  The glaze really adds to the flavor.  The only change I made was to double the glaze.  I will be making this again.

Everyone enjoyed this dish!! I ate a lot of it myself :) I doubled the glazed but used cayenne pepper and yellow mustard(didn't have dry mustard) used chicken bouillion(didn't have beef) oh and I used 1 small can of tomato paste and used 1/2 the ketchup. I also added diced green pepper. I season the top before the glaze just a little seasoning salt, salt, pepper, garlic. The only thing different I will do next time is not double the brown sugar. It was excellent!!

We have thrown out all other meatloaf recipes after trying this one. We love the glaze so much that we usually double it - great meatloaf

unbelievable.  My husband doesn't even normally like meatloaf and even he was impressed.  The flavor was spot on, not too sweet, not to tomatoey. The only thing I did different was in the middle of preparing this I realized I didn't have any beef boullion cubes.  Desperate, I found a pack of beef flavored Ramen soup mix and stole the beef flavor out of that.  Worked okay in a pinch!  I'm going to be using this meatloaf recipe from now on!,

This dish is so easy, quick, and delicious! My boyfriend and I love it!  I used seasoned dried bread crumbs instead of slices of bread, and I added a little bit of garlic to the meat mixture. Fantastic!

I have made too many meatloaf recipes to count and this one was my winner!  I am not a fan of meatloaf, but my husband is and he said that this is possibly the best meatloaf he has ever had and RAVES about the sauces.  In fact, he ate almost the entire 2 lbs the night I made it and so I made another one yesterday and he has almost polished that whole thing off!  (And he is not a big guy) - but he keeps saying he can't stop eating it!!  I followed the recipe - but left if in the oven for about 115 minutes until the temp reached between 150 and 155.  I also doubled the topping but reduced the brown sugar just a hair (he's not a fan of things that are too sweet).  He has asked that I make MORE topping - that that is the only problem with this, the top is good but you are out of sauce for the middle - so next time I will make more and put it on the side for dipping or glazing individual pieces.  This was a huge hit!

Reminded me of my mom's meatloaf. I used oatmeal in place of shredded bread and added about 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Will be making this again.

This meatloaf was wonderful. My boyfriend and I loved it! I did however add 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs along with the 3 piece of bread. I also added a can of tomato soup. I used half of the can of soup in the ketchup mixture for the glaze and added the rest into the meat mixture. It was delicious!

The glaze is wonderful but the meat itself it too meaty...needs more flavor. But I have to say this is the only meatloaf I ever scarfed down and it was pretty good. Until this dish, I've always hate meatloaf. I will try and spice up the meat mixture a little more next time though.

This has become our new favorite meatloaf. I have actually been using this recipe for some time now and just now got around to rating it.  We love it, it is moist and flavorful and the lemon adds an interesting *something* that guests will say, "what is that flavor"?  Yummy!

I absolutely love meatloaf, but I wasn't a real fan of this recipe.  As another review suggested, I also used a package of brown gravy mix instead of the bouillon.  The meatloaf itself probably wouldn't have been too bad, but others raved about the sauce so much, so I also doubled the amount.  I mixed some in with the meatloaf and then cooked for a while and then added most of the rest of the sauce to the top and reserved a small amount for adding after the meatloaf was cooked.  I personally found the sauce to be WAY too sweet for my taste.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but I know there are other meatloaf recipes that I would enjoy much more.

This meatloaf has become a staple in our home.  I have made it at least 10 times.  I would suggest for the bread, to use a cuisinart and get it to a nice almost rice like size.  The big chunks of bread the first few times were not as good.  if you don't have a chopper, maybe just shred as small as you can.  Make sure when you mix everything together that you really squeeze it so there are not air pockets and really form a good loaf before putting in the pan.  I have also found the cooking time does need to be extended some, we don't like pink meatloaf :)  I added another 10 minutes.  Enjoy!

I've made this three times and realllly like it! My guy devours it and says it's the best meatloaf he's ever had. The last time I made it I added a couple slices of bread in the bottom of the pan before adding the loaf, this soaked up a lot of the fat and helped keep the meatloaf together. When making without bread at the bottom, it fell apart while slicing, but still tasted good!

This meatloaf was excellent.  I've tried many many recipes and never found one that was enjoyed as much by my family.  I replaced the lemon juice in the glaze with balsamic vinegar and with Worcestershire in the meat.  (Adding lemon juice to ground meat just sounded weird...)  Worcestershire was tangy like the lemon and added that beefy flavor, so I skipped the beef bullion.  I also used a combination of ground beef, lamb, and veal.  This is a keeper!

I substituted 1C panko for the bread, 1T onion soup mix for the bouillon, and nearly ground the onions in the food processor (mainly because my daughter kept pushing the button), which kept out big chunks that could make it fall apart.  I only put in 1T lemon juice because I was afraid it would be too citrussy, but you couldn't taste the lemon (or the soup mix) at all.  I also used a beef/pork/veal mix for the meat.  It was really delicious!  Even my extremely picky 13-year-old gobbled it up.  The glaze was wonderful and there was a lot of it.  I think next time I would make the whole batch, and heat up the excess and serve it to spoon over the meatloaf.  I have tried dozens of meatloaf recipes over the years, and this is one of the best.  Thank you!

This has turned out to be our favorite.  I freeze half the meatloaf mixture and write on the foil the time, temp and recipe for the sauce for the top of the meatloaf. That way you have a meal in minutes. Just put the frozen one in the oven and it is ready in the same time.  It is just enough for the two of us and an extra for a sandwich the next day. I use all the sauce for the one meatloaf.

MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED THE GLAZE FOR THE MEATLOAF!!!  I decided to used another recipe for the meatloaf because others said it way dry, but I am so glad that I tried the glaze.  I double the recipe so that you can have it on the side.  First time my dad has not had to pour ketchup all over the meatloaf.

I found that;
 - you should use a meat thermometer, for 1 hour is not nearly enough cooking time
 - you need to use 1 egg per lb. of hamburger for better binding purposes
 - the addition of some chopped onion and/or some dried onion soup mix greatly improves the taste

I just tried this recipe and it was really good. I just made a few changes to it. I used italian breadcrumbs instead of bread and added sweet basil and garlic. Also, I did not have any dry mustard on hand so I used honey mustard for the glaze and it was yummy! I thought it had just the right amount of sweetness. This will be my new meatloaf recipe.

Wow.  I'm not normally a fan of meatloaf but this was very good.  I also loved that it was so easy to make.  I made some slight alterations.  After reading other reviews about how sweet the sauce was I decided to add about 2 pinches of garlic salt to it to offset the sweetness.  I think that really helped.  I also added one clove of minced garlic to the meat mix.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again!

Ok....I have been making the same meatloaf for the past 20 years and we have always enjoyed it, no complaints but I thought I would try a new recipe just for kicks and my gosh....I will never make the "old" meatloaf again. This was absolutely delicious and a nice change to the same old meatloaf! I cooked it with mashed potatoes and peas and I am hoping that there will be enough leftovers for a sandwich tomorrow!

This is GREAT! I made it with 100% whole wheat bread and only 1/4 C brown sugar in an attempt to make it lower in carbs. It is AWESOME!! Even my 3 and 5 year old girls liked it. Will definitely make this again. I've been snacking on it (my husband is late tonight) and hope there is some left for him! I'm sure this would make awesome sandwiches.

I really wanted to like this recipe as being something a little different from the regular old meatloaf.  This is one of the few American dishes that my husband loves and will eat up every drop.  I just did not like the flavor of the sweetness.  I didn't even pack the brown sugar; measured it loosely into the measuring cup.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have a beef bouillion so I added some of the powder from a beefy onion soup pouch.  It was so simple to prepare and baked up so nicely.  If one likes a sweet sauce, this would be a good recipe.

DING DING DING!!! We've found a winner! This one will replace my existing meatloaf recipe.  Due to some limitations of last moment meal planning I did alter a bit of the recipe - but have no doubt that it is wonderful as written too!  I did not have lemon juice so guess what was left out?  On reading other reviews I liked the idea of 3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs instead of the bread - but only had plain, so I added a pinch of rosemary and thyme. For those who didn't care for using the bread itself because of the chunks - try loosely placing the slices of bread into a food processor for a few seconds - nice and fine - no more hunks of dough.  But since I was lazy on wanting to do this (even though it's really so simple), I opted for the canned crumbs.  Same reason I used dried minced onions. Why chop when you can pour . . .  Thanks for a keeper Delia!

Yummy! My family often asks me to make this. I used 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 BBQ sauce, 3/4 cup italian bread crumbs and dried minced onion. Also omitted the lemon juice. Delicious!

I used 1 c. seasoned bread crumbs in place of the bread and added 2 tsp. Montreal Steak Blend (mix mainly of salt, pepper and garlic).  The meatloaf was very tasty and very moist!

This recipe has become a weekly dinner! My (very picky) husband adores this meal. After a few times, I followed others' advice and changed from shredded bread to one cup of bread crumbs (I didn't appreciate the globby chunks of soaked bread in the meatloaf). Even better!

Even with the original recipe, it's five stars... I wish I could give an extra star after adding the bread crumbs! Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was pretty good.  I reduced the amount of onion and the amount of sauce.  It was still plenty sweet. Also, added some garlic.  Thanks for the post.

I have been making this recipe for around a year now. I don't make many changes to the recipe, except I make sure to cut up the onion small. And instead of only putting in 1/3 of the ketchup mixture, I put half in and leave just enough to spread over the top, otherwise it's too sweet for me. But if you like sauce, go by the recipe's suggestion. This recipe is tried and true and the most stubborn meatloaf hater would love this one. The last suggestion I would make (since we like things cooked well-done in this house) is double the cooking time. I cook for 1 hour covered with foil and then cook for an additional hour without foil to brown.

Delicious!  Needed a touch of salt and pepper to flavour the beef, but otherwise wonderful.  Lemon gives it a great tanginess.  Ten minutes prep time was a severe underestimate for the non-professional chef mind you!

I liked the flavor but my family felt it was too sweet. I found it to be too moist however I have had meatloaf that is way too dense. I would try different recipes again but probably not this one based on their response.

My husband loves his mother's meatloaf. But he now likes this meatloaf even better.  He told me to make sure to save this recipe!   I used whole grain bread and used the food processor to make the bread crumbs and since the bread was fresh and moist I left out the eggs. I do drain the grease part way through cooking nut we have our own beef and it is already very lean.  I am making a double batch right now as my college son wants to take some back to college with him.  Delicious!

Followed directions with one change from lemon juice to balsamic vinegar as others suggested. This was good but was not a stand out meat loaf recipe for our family.

Amazing!! This is definitely a keeper....no need to try any other recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for using real mustard instead of dry mustard and ground turkey instead of ground beef. This is a recipe I have continued to make and everyone loves it!

My family loves this meatloaf. This is the only meatloaf my family makes. My sister and brother beg me to this all the time. I always double the recipe for my family of 7. There's never any leftovers. Although, I only add half the lemon juice to the ground beef. So, when I double it I add 3 tablespoons instead of 6 tablespoons like the recipe suggests. Also, instead of the 3 slices of bread, I add about half a cup of plain bread crumbs. Either way an all- star recipe!

This is my go to recipe for meatloaf. Everyone in my family from my mother who loves meatloaf to my sister who hates it, loves it! I tweak the recipe a little by adding extra brown sugar (about 1/4 - 1/3 of a cup) to make it sweeter and I have gotten great reviews on it! Thanks!

I'm the type that makes meatloaf JUST to make meatloaf sandwiches. This recipe was perfect! I don't keep bread stocked, so I substituted 3/4 cup of oats (never having done this before but trusting other reviewers). The resulting meatloaf was dense, moist, and perfect for sandwiches. Definitely going to be a keeper. Thank you!

This ws very goooood! I didn't have bread, so I used Panco Bread Crumbs (less than half a cup). I filled a cup of it and I just added a little at a time. Once I saw it looked a little dry, thqt was it. That was less than half a cup, maybe even a 1/4 cup. I added a little salt and pepper to the meat too. Other than that, I follwed the recipe exact and it was delicious!!

I used a TBS of balsamic instead of one of the TBS of lemon juice. Super good. But I LOVE balsamic vinegar. Also, I did not use bread to soak up the grease, I just dump it out of the pan when I put the glaze on for the last few minutes of baking.

Great receipe.  Very similar to the one I have been using for years.  I omit the lemon juice & use 2 tsp mustard instead of the mustard powder in the glaze.  I also double the glaze receipe and keep half of it to heat up in a saucepan to drizzle over the slices of meatloaf - soooo good!  I prefer to use a package of onion soup mix instead of the boullion, but either will do.  I will also add a tsp of Worchester sauce if I have it.

Excellent meatloaf. I skipped the bullion (those cubes are loaded with MSG) and added a little soy sauce and Worcestershire. Also used 1/2c oats (ground them in blender) and 1/4c seasoned breadcrumbs, instead of the shredded bread. I formed the loaf by hand and placed it on a broiling rack that had holes with a drip tray below it. If I had time I would have deglazed and made a gravy. Served with slow cooker mashed potatoes. Was a hit!

For someone who not only doesn't cook, but has ruined meatloaf...this is awesome.  First off I made it in a muffin pan!  Second, I made the substitutions of french fried onions for the real one, a splash of balsalmic vinegar instead of the bouillon cube, 3/4C bread crumbs instead of the shredded bread and dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard.  I just took several reviews and came up with those changes and it was sooooo good!!!

Delicious!!! I added some green pepper, spicy hot mustard instead of dry, white vinegar in place of lemon & white sugar mixed w/molasses in place of brown sugar. Just Great! (I also put bread on the bottom to soak up the fat). I will definitely make this again!

I make this ALL of the time!  It's the one thing I'm comfortable enough to make without following the recipe to a "t."  I add things here and there (i.e. seasonings), but stick to the recipe for the most part.  I also tend to make a little more of the glaze just cuz it's so yummy!  Great dish to serve on any night for the whole family!

This is the best meatloaf!  The glaze makes it - it's soooo good, you won't have any leftovers!  The glaze is sweet, similar to a bbq sauce but without the kick, it's just perfect.  Highly recommend this.  You can add anything you want to the meatloaf, but for the last 10 min. I added the glaze on top and it was perfect.

If you (or anyone in your family) hate "meatloaf night", this recipe will change your mind!  The glaze is delicious and the meatloaf itself is very moist and full of flavour.  Add a bit of garlic if it suits you, but really, the recipe is great just as is.

This was AMAZING!  Both husband and I loved it.  The only changes I made were: used one pound lean ground beef and one pound ground pork, added diced green pepper and used bread crumbs instead of shred.  Next time I will try the bread on the bottom of the pan - very intrigued by that.
PS - I use this recipe with my additions/substitutions above to make into hamburger patties... they are a hit in my neighborhood and I've shared it out quite a few times.  Thanks for this awesome recipe Delia!

This wonderful,was my dinner and both me and my hub loved it. It fell apart but I should have addded more breadcrumbs. I used Dijon because I don't have dry moustard, the rest I made it as the recipe indicates. Some of you complainted about the onions I decided to sauté them first in some olive oil and after that I drained the oil in kitchen towel, than I mixed the oil-free onion with the ground meat. It tasted wonderfuly and I'll make it over and over...with more breadcrumbs

I was Challanged to make my first ever meatloaf (i don't eat beef!) by my very picky (and honest) boyfriend. I found this recipe and adapted a few things according to the reviews and it came out AMAZING..even i tried some! I got rave reviews and it was SO EASY to make with my busy schedule! My adaptions: omitted mustard for lack of.. almost doubled the ketchup til the sweetness level was correct (you'll want extra of this great sauce anyway!).. 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of bread.. and added a little garlic powder and black pepper! Its made me re-think the boring meatloaf image forever!

Definitely double the sauce. I did, and I still needed ketchup, but I'm weird like that. The loaf itself wasn't very tasty. I'll keep the recipe for the sauce, but keep looking for another meatloaf recipe.

This was very good, but even after cutting back on the sugar and adding some dijon mustard it was a little sweet.  I was out of horseradish as I think that would be just what I would like.  The texture was terrific.  I will make it again with a little more bite.

This was awesome.  I have a bunch of picky eaters to cook for and everyone loved it. I'm already getting requests to make it again.

I tweaked the recipie a little: I added half a packet of onion soup mix instead of the onions and I did 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup bbq sauce instead of 1/2 cup of ketchup.  Gave it a little extra zing.  I will probably use bread crubbs instead of the shredded bread next time.

Hands down the best meatloaf recipe I have ever made OR tasted! For an extra-tasty glaze, I use BBQ sauce instead of tomato sauce (it adds an extra level of taste which mixes wonderfully with the mustard and lemon juice). I've made this recipe many times since discovering it!

I forgot to add the minced onions.  I substituted italian bread crumbs for the bread and added garlic and a healthy squirt of ketchup to my meat mixture.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of milk to get the consistency I wanted to form the loaf.
My family loved it and it heated up nicely for lunch today too!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I only made a few changes: first I used a package of original flavor suffing mix instead of the bread slices, and I also added 1 additional egg, and some minced garlic, and red and green bell peppers. The glaz for the meatloaf is sooo tasty! This was the best meatloaf I have made so far. I definitely will be making this again.

This is a great meatloaf recipe. The only ingredient I added to the ground beef was a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. I also made extra ketchup & brown sugar mixture to serve on the side for dipping.

Sorry, but I didn't think this deserved the rave review it has been getting.  While the meat was moist enough, I didn't care for the flavor and was quite frankly, underwhelmed.  I won't make this one again.

OK.  This is THE meatloaf recipe.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  The only change I made was to use Italian bread crumbs instead of bread and used 1/2 cup of onion instead of 1/4 because we love onion.  Thank you Dehlia!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it is a big hit at our house.  Even those that don't like meatloaf like this one.  Other than doubling the glaze, I don't change a thing.  If you like a more sweet and sour taste you will like this.  But if you prefer a more tomato tasting meatloaf you probably should look elsewhere.

For the first time ever, I went back for seconds on meatloaf.  The recipe stands as written.  However, I added chopped red and green peppers and grated carrot to the mix.  Hubby doesn't like sweets so I cut the brown sugar almost in half but he still thought it too sweet so next time I will try just a TSP of sugar. Oh I almost forgot!  I only had 1 1/2 lb of hamburg so I added 1/2 lb of soy meat substitute. (soyburg?) and I used 3/4 c. oats instead of bread. Can't wait to have glazed meat loaf again!

The first time.....I had a green pepper on hand and chopped it up and threw it in this recipe. This was not a good idea because it made the meatloaf too wet.  I also incorporated all of the glaze into the meatloaf, rather than waiting until the end.  This made the overall flavor too sweet. I'm giving it 5 stars because I made it a second time following the recipe as it is written and it came out lovely.  Thank you Delia.

I tried this recipe the other night for my family, and it was fantastic!  I just added a couple of things.  I know this sounds a little weird, but I added about a tablespoon of peanut butter to the glaze, and instead of ground beef, I used a mixture of lamb and andouille sausage.  My husband actually asked for seconds.  This one's a keeper!

Two changes:  I added honey to the mixture b/c my family likes it super sweet, and also I fried the onion first (saw that on Bobby Flay Meatloaf Challenge, LOL!)  Talk about GOOD!!!! The second time I made this I skipped the lemon, and honestly didn't even notice a difference.  The next day, I sliced it thin and made sandwiches -- this meatloaf's was almost better the next day!!!

This is wonderful meatloaf. I used 1 lb ground chuck and 1 lb ground turkey. I added 2 Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce to enhance the flavor, and used 1 1/2 Tbsp dried minced onion instead of fresh. I doubled the ketchup mixture because it's so tasty!

YUM!  We always use this recipe, it's perfect comfort food.  The lemon is what really makes it, imo.  It's so flavorful and moist.  The only difference is that I use regular mustard.

I had never attempted making meatloaf before, because my husband swears his is the best overall. I decided to use this recipe with a few minor changes. I used 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of the bread and cut down the total lemon juice used to 2 tablespoons. This meal came out wonderful. My husband says he will never make his own meatloaf again and even my picky eight year old daughter really enjoyed it.

I followed the recipe exactly but used only 1/8th cup brown sugar as I know the suggested amount would be too much. The sauce was WAY too sweet still! If I had added the full amount of brown sugar the meatloaf would not of been edible. If you like candied meat, this is the recipe!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever used,and my family agrees. Before this recipe my husband hated meatloaf and now he asks me to make this recipe at least once a week. He's says his mother's is the worse, and I need to give her this recipe as a favor to him!

We really liked this meatloaf. I had extra onion left, so I caramelized that in a pan and served it alongside the meatloaf with some baby LaSeur peas and a loaf of Italian bread. Looking forward to having the leftovers in sandwiches today! Next time I'm going to serve it with mashed potatoes. Can't wait to make it again - it's an easy one.

This was wonderful.  I doubled the glaze for leftovers and it was perfect.  I also added 1 can of sliced portabello mushrooms and 1 Tbs of Worscheter.  I am not a big meatloaf fan, but i loved this one.  I used 93% lean beef and it was still moist!

My family absolutely loved this recipe and we were all a little sketchy about meatloaf when trying this.  I did modify it a bit.  I doubled the sauce as per others suggestions - and it made just enough.  I also used 1 cup bread crumbs instead of bread and I added 1 tsp of minced garlic, and lots of pepper to the meat mixture.  It turns out perfect every time.  We now have it weekly in our house.

This is a fantastic easy meatloaf recipe. Makes a wonderful glaze that my family loves. My husband asked for the leftovers to take with a loaf of bread to work for sandwiches tomorrow. I used dried minced onion, 1 T and put the glaze on right from the start so it baked in good and gooey. Thanks Delia, this is great!

Fantastic!  I've made this 3 times in 2 weeks, per the request of my husband and toddler.

We don't eat red meat, so I usually make it with 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground pork.  I double the amount of glaze because I cook the loaf free-form on a half-sheet, so I coat the sides as well as the top.  I also mince an extra 1/3 of a cup or so of onion and add it to the glaze.  I also don't keep white bread in the house, so I substitute 3/4 cup bread crumbs for the crushed bread.

Leftovers make great sandwiches for hubby's lunch, too!  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Thank you!  This is the best recipe for meatloaf I have ever had.  My husband loves ANY meatloaf but I never cared for it much.  However, I kept on making it trying this and that recipe.  I finally found it!  It's great as cold sandwiches too.

If you are looking for your average meatloaf, this is what you want. I prepared as directed, except I used seasoned bread crumbs rather than piecing up actual bread -- that shouldn't make a difference.  However, it took about 90 minutes to cook.

Made this last night, and my husband said to keep this recipe, since this was the Best Meatloaf Ever.  Reading ealier comments, used 1 c. breadcrumbs, and 2 T. brown sugar.  Sauteed 2 cloves minced garlic and generous 1/4 c. onions, then mixed into recipe.  Fabulous! 
Thanks for making me look good.

This is one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever fixed.  My entire family (except the 5 year old) loved it.  I am going to try it without onion for him, since that was his only objection to it.

A wonderful meatloaf.  The lemon juice added a wonderful hint of flavor to the dish.  Add salt & pepper for a more delicious loaf.

My family loves this meatloaf. The only advice that I would have is to double the recipe for the glaze. For my kids, that's the best part! One time when I made it, I wasn't paying attention to the recipe and I put the entire amount of sauce in the loaf and I ended up having to make another batch for the glaze. It actually turned out great that way!

Great tasting meatloaf that the whole family enjoyed.  The only change I made was using 1/3 cup of bread crumbs instead of the shredded bread, and that's really only for convenience.

Doubled the recipe and baked twice as long. Because who doesn't love leftover meatloaf? I used some suggestions from other reviewers; placing sliced bread under the loaf to absorb extra juices & used oats instead of bread as a binder. Hands down the best I've ever made! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

I love making meatloaf and I always use the glaze from this recipe. Always double it or you won't have enough. For my meatloaf I add Lawrey's Seasoned Salt, salt and pepper, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, ketchup and a small onion and green pepper that I sautéed in a little butter and I use buttery crackers  instead of bread. I also add 3 beaten eggs. Bake for about 65 minutes. Yummy!

My family loved this so much they don't want me trying out any new meatloaf recipes anymore - and we all agreed it was better than my mom's & my husband's mom's meatloaf. A few tweaks: instead of the bread I used 1 cup of *seasoned* breadcrumbs and a splash of milk. I also added some minced garlic (fresh!) and cracked pepper. I used bouillon sachets instead of cubes, it's so easy to just sprinkle it in and you don't get your fingers sticky/messy. For the topping, I used regular prepared mustard because I had no mustard powder on hand and I think next time I'll try reducing the sugar a tiny bit. I used extra lean ground beef - there was no fat or drippings yet my meatloaf turned out *very* flavourful! Thanks for sharing, Delia!

My picky elementary school age son proudly proclaims to people who say they don't like meatloaf; "You haven't had MY MOM'S meatloaf!"  I've been using this recipe for years.  I put my bread in the food processor to make the bread crumbs fine so there aren't blobs of bread in the loaf.  It works wonderful! I also double the sauce recipe to have extra for dipping.  Leftovers are just as good!

My family raved over this meatloaf. I made a few substitutions...balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice, small squirt of brown mustard instead of dry mustard for sauce, 1/4 C panko bread crumbs instead of shredded bread, 1T Worcestershire sauce instead of lemon juice, 1 1/2 envelopes of dry onion soup instead of the onion in meat mixture, and I did not use the bullion cube. Also I poured the reserved sauce over meat at the beginning of bake time. The only request they made was to make extra sauce for dipping next time!

This - has to be the best meatloaf recipe ever.  It was absolutely delicious and it has to be that lemon in there that somehow - well - lets put it this way.  My guy loved it so much he couldn't stop eating it and kept going back to nibble on it.. lol... and went out this week and bought hamburger for me to make more.  He's addicted now for sure!

I've made this recipe twice and loved it both times!! Even my brother who doesn't like meatloaf loved it! I did substitute the bread for 2/3 cup of bread crumbs plus added potatoes and carrots to cook along side it which soaked up any juices from the meatloaf - which wasn't much.

I usually don't follow a recipe exactly, then wonder why it wasn't what I expected. This time I made it just as written. I thought it was very bland, dry, and just not good. It looked good, though!

I have cooked this pretty much as the directions state.  Although I do have picky eaters who HATE onions...I throw in some onion powder.  Also, if you want a spin on a good summer time treat...prepare as this recipe states and patty into Hamburgers and throw on the grill.  drizzle some glaze right before you take off the grill.  WOW!

Delicious! I subbed 1 pkg (19oz) Johnsonville (R) Hot Italian Sausage for 1lb of the ground beef and baked in a muffin tin @ 375 for 30 min. Very moist & the sausage really added a nice depth of flavor. This recipe's a real keeper!

Pure Yumminess....
I have made this meatloaf a dozen times, and it always is devoured instantly.  Thanks to the helpful tips by others, I make a few variations as well.  I prefer 1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs, I add diced bell peppers, a dash of worchestershire sauce, a dash of A-1, diced garlic, and a teaspoon of horseradish for a lil kick!  I also omit the lemon, and use vinegar for the acid.  Bless the person who first suggested the bread on the bottom, that was ingenious!  Twist it your own way, this is a solid recipe!

The sauce on top was overpowering with ketchup. I'd trying using less ketchup, maybe substitute a little Worcestershire.

This glaze is amazing as well as the meatloaf. I added seasoned bread crumbs instead of the bread and omitted the lemon juice from the loaf as I didn't have any and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband liked this meatloaf but he added BBQ sauce on top so I can't give it 5 stars. Recommend not to use the lemon juice in the meat mixture if you don't use lemons often in your cooking. It was too overpowering for me...in the sauce it was okay. Other then that it was good.

Yummy!  It's the glaze that totally makes this dish let me tell you.  It was awesome.  I completely forgot to add some ketchup in the meatloaf so I'll do that next time.  I found myself dunking the meat loaf onto the glaze on my plate like a dip.  Although I do have to say, the loaf itself was not bland at all...just tasted better loaded with the glaze :D.  I followed someone's advice and molded my meatloaf since I don't have a loaf pan and it worked so ty! Better than what I did with another recipe, cutting em out like brownies lol.  This is such a good recipe it definitely is a contender for being the only one I make from now on!

The glaze sauce was sooooo good. I cooked my loaf a little to long and it turned out kinda dry and I tweeked the recipe a little after reading the reviews. I didn't have dry mustard so I used dijon mustard, I added garlic powder, and replaced the bread w/ bread crumbs. I also added Worcheshire {about 11/2 tsp} to the glaze mixture. Added green peppers to the meatloaf also.

Best meatloaf ever.  Moist and tasty.  Excellent.  Made it with ground turkey this time and turned out just as great.  Sometimes I add a bit of Worcestershire sauce into the topping and I may recommend having some extra topping on hand cuz it is so good.

This is WONDERFUL.  Even my 3-year-old, who "doesn't eat meat" (her words, not mine) gobbles it down.  I do cook it in muffin tins (to speed up cooking time and "kid-appeal"). Husband likes it too!  Yum!

I didn't care much for the actual meatloaf- however the glaze was fantastic!  I prefer to make my "harvest meat loaf" which has more spices and isn't as dense.  I do use the glaze on the harvest meat loaf and it is fantastic.  My husband didn't care much for this loaf either, and he is a meat lover.  He thought it just tasted like a chunk of hamburger without much flavor.  5 stars on the glaze though!!

What a difference a little brown sugar makes!  The glaze was wonderful! I mixed a tiny bit into the meat before cooking and it made it soooo moist. I also soaked 1 C of breadcrumbs in milk in lieu of slices as suggested by others.  Kids gobbled it down. Nice blizzard comfort food! Yumm!

I've never made a meatloaf with lemon juice before. This was delicious and I will continue to use this recipe from now on. I made the glaze exactly as written and it was perfect. Since onion soup mix is basically beef bouillon and dried onion, I used half a packet instead of the diced onion and bouillon to save time. I used 3/4 cup old fashioned oats instead of bread. I put bread heels under the loaf to absorb the extra fat. I added a pinch of thyme since I enjoy that flavor with this kind of beef recipe. I like that this recipe only needs one egg instead of two and is not overly salty like the recipes that use a whole packet of soup mix with less meat. Thank you!

People are raving about how moist the meat is, but for some reason it seems too moist for my taste.  The glaze was wonderful, though.  I may try this again substituting crackers for the bread, as my family usually does.

Very good.  The glaze was absolutely delicious.  My husband loved it.  I have a convection oven and followed someone else's advise only cooking it for one hour and the middle was a tad pink.  I will definitely make this again.

This was okay.  I might not make again.  I was not too crazy about the crunchy onions in the meatloaf.  Every other meatloaf I've tried doesn't have the crunchy onions in it.  I really liked the glaze on the meatloaf.  It was sweet and tasted like barbeque sauce.  My husband didn't even want to try it because of the overpowering smell of mustard and the look of the crunchy onions really tipped him off to not try it.  If I make this again, I will use the dried minced onions instead.

I have been married for a lil over 12 years and this is the first meatloaf that did not fall apart and that my husband has had seconds of. This was a hit with the whole family and I did double the glaze as everyone else did it was sweet and tangy and the kids loved it. Will make it in the future many times in the future!!!!

I was craving a meatloaf and decided to give this recipe a shot - I'm glad I did! I doubled the glaze, but other than that, I didn't change a thing and it came out terrific! We did not have any leftovers.  Also, thanks to whoever suggested putting two slices of bread under the loaf to soak up the fat - worked like a charm.  Thanks for sharing!

This meatloaf was good, but the sauce was too sweet and the rest just tasted ordinary.  The large number of ratings led me to believe that this was going to be one of the best meatloafs ever but it just tasted like something I've thrown together in the past without a recipe and minus the really sweet sauce.  I will try another recipe from this site next time.

Let me just say that I am not a meatloaf person, but this is delicious!  My complaint with most meatloaves is that they are too dry.  That is not the case with this recipe.  Very moist and flavorful.  I only make a slight alteration.  I decrease the amount of brown sugar in the glaze by just a bit.  As is, it's a little too sweet.  I also double the glaze to have more to dip the meatloaf in.  This is also a perfect recipe for freezing.  When I make this, I make enough for 3-4 meals and divide the uncooked meatloaf mixture into freezer bags.

This is my second time making the meatloaf and it was by request from both my husband and my mom. Moist, juicey and a gorgeous sweet and sour glaze. I added a touch of worchestershire sauce for an extra kick though. yummy with mashed potatos and broccoli.

My hubby loves his mom's meatloaf and hates when I even attempt meatloaf because it's never as good at his mom's...but this time, my little boy asked for meatloaf for dinner, so I found this recipe and made it, and both my little boy and the "big boy" loved it!  I did make a change though - I sauteed the onions prior to mixing them into the loaf, and I also added 1 carrot (I made a 1/2 recipe though, so 2 carrots for the full recipe), shredded and sauteed (with the onions).  The only reason I added the carrot was to sneak in some extra nutrition/fiber and to stretch the pound of ground beef a little further.  It was a big hit!

I'm of an age where I just couldn't use an actual recipe for meatloaf but I DID follow the glaze recipe and it was wonderful.  I also threw some beef boullion into the mix which may have enhanced the flavor too.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

My husband loved this recipe!!! I did make a few changes that I think make it even better...I used 1 1/2 lbs. lean ground beef and 1/2 ground pork...there was barely any grease at the bottom of the pan...I made bread crumbs instead of just tearing the bread...I threw in a bunch of garlic into the meat...and I used Splenda brown sugar (make sure to check the equivalency on the back of the bag) for the glaze...Yum!!!!

Substitutions: 3/4 cup of oat meal for the bread, added slices of bread below the loaf. I also used bacon slices, cooked carrots, sliced onions and slices of black olives inside the loaf (rolled). The result was great. I basted the loaf about 3 or 4 times with the ketchup/sugar sauce, getting a nice glaze at the end, after baking until the loaf temperature reached 160 F.

Not one for being a meatloaf fan, this came out really really well! I followed the recipe to the T and couldn't be happier about it. Very simple and very good!

The whole family loves this recipe.  My grandsons will make a special trip for supper if this is being served (2 don't even like meatloaf).  I use a package of brown gravy mix in place of boullion.  Yummy sandwiches if you are lucky enough to have leftovers.

This meatloaf recipe is el-yummo! I pretty much follow this recipe everytime I throw one of my masterpieces together(hey, it's artwork to me:)). I add a little of this or that depending on my mood or who's eating (garlic, soy sauce, cayenne ppr, horseradish, whatever). I add an extra egg for holding power too. Hint: I love next day meatloaf sandwiches! I fry a slice in olive oil till it's a browned and crunchy. Great recipe! Thank you!

This is one of the best meat loafs I've ever had!  The glaze is amazing.  The only things I changed was I used 3/4 cup of oats and I doubled the glaze.  I also used ground turkey and it wasn't greasy at all!

This is it, I've finally found it! The best meatloaf recipe!  I've been trying recipe after recipe trying to find a meatloaf recipe I can stomach because I can't stand meatloaf and my family loves it.  But you know what, this recipe is beyond stomaching, I actually like this meatloaf.  My husband, who rarely gives compliments was actually saying yum as he was eating.  My search is finally over, and this wonderful recipe is staying in my regular rotation.

This recipe is called "The Best Meatloaf Yet" in our house.  I have been asked by my DH not to try any more meatloaf recipes!  The sauce on top is great for kid, too.

I made this a few months ago and didn't rate it right away. I am NOT a big fan of ground beef or meat loaf, but that being said, I have to say~ this was delicious! I fried the onions in a little oil to soften them. I also doubled the glaze (as some suggested). It was wonderful. I served it with mashed potatoes. Will make it again for sure!

This recipe was good but i did have to change it up a bit the second time I made it. I doubled the glaze but did NOT double the lemon juice and cut back just a tad on the sugar. I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of bread. I also like just a little more flavor so I added some salt and pepper to the meat.

Iam a meatloaf hater! But my DH cannot live without it so to make him happy I have tried a number of different recipes off this site, family members, cookbooks and so forth. This recipe is hands down the absolute best I have come across. Thank you for such a great combination of flavors.

This meatloaf is very good. The glaze is the best I've ever had. I will double the glaze the next time I fix it. My kids loved it; there wasn't enough left over for a meatloaf sandwich.

This is definitely a VERY tasty recipe! I used lean ground turkey instead of beef and it still came out very moist. My husband is allergic to onions so I used onion powder instead of fresh onions and it worked well. I also added salt and pepper to the meat mixture. I will double the glaze next time b/c it is so good!

It was good but nothing spectacular.  I only used 1.33 pounds of meat as I'm only cooking for 2 and that was plenty.  I also used 2 slices of fresh sourdough bread. Otherwise I followed the exact recipe.

For a meatloaf, this was really yummy! I substituted the bread with 3/4 cup oats which added a nice nutty flavor to the dish. Great flavor, a bit sweet.

Absolutely Fantastic!!!  This is the first time I ever made meatloaf.  I definitely doubled the sauce recipe, b/c both my husband and I like extra sauce.  The only thing i changed was I hard boiled 3 eggs and put them in the middle of the loaf before backing.  Can't wait to make it again :D!!!!

One of the best meatloaf recipes, I've tried...even my son 9who doesn't like meatloaf) liked it and asked for seconds!! I added 1 lb sausage to the hamburger, and it turned out very good. Also, I didn't have any dry mustard, so used just a touch of yellow mustard for the sauce....had to double the sauce to use for dipping! btw the glaze sauce also makes a good dipping sauce for chicken and pork chops

This recipe is great.  I did make some varations.  I didnt use the lemon juice.  I added some romano cheese and some chicken broth to moisten it up.  I couldnt get my boyfriend away from it.  Very moist.  I will make this again.

I was leery about all the lemon juice to add, but it tasted great!  I followed other reviews and practically tripled the sauce. (My boyfriend and I are "sauce" people) I also added some garlic powder and chopped green pepper in the meat mixture.  I added a couple splashes of soy sauce and a lil of the sriracha thai chili hot sauce into the sauce to add a little heat and counter act all the sweetness in the sauce. Boyfriend gives it three thumbs up!

A good foundation recipe. I actually added an entire packet of onion soup mix and still found it kind of bland. I also added heaping sprinkles of Tabasco sauce--still a little 'meh.' Experiment with this one. Served with mashed potatoes and vinegared English cucumbers. Good comfort food, great leftovers.

If there's one thing I know after making this recipe, it's that I'll never, ever put lemon in a meatloaf again.  I thought it sounded good, until I tasted it.  I gave it three stars, though, because my boyfriend *claimed* to like it.  But, the leftovers are still hanging out in my fridge, untouched.  If I make it again, I'll definitely omit the lemon.

I have no idea what all the hype is about. I tried this; following the ingredients to the letter. It was boring, hardly any flavor, and I'd never make this again. What a let-down after humming along while making it and then anxiously checking on it in the oven. I'll go back to my old recipie - throw in what-ever grabs me at the time!

I would like to say that this was very good.  I made it for my husband who really likes meatloaf, me...not so much, and we both really enjoyed it.  Easy to make!  I did double the topping as suggested and it turned out perfect!

This is by far THE BEST meatloaf that I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of finely chopped bell pepper. For me that is the key to a perfect meatloaf. The glaze alone is worth trying it for. I will never use another recipe again!!!

the meatloaf itself was great, but the glaze was a little too sweet for my taste. Tonight I am making it again, but not putting brown sugar in the glaze, just using half BBQ sauce and half ketchup....

I LOVE THIS MEATLOAF - and so do my kids!!  I fix it as often as I can get away with.  The sweet tangy-ness of the glaze compliments the meat really well.  Mash up some potatoes, add a hearty vegetable and you have the perfect comfort-food meal.

This was the BEST meatloaf ever! I halved the recipe because my 3 kids normally do not like meatloaf.  I baked it for suggested time in a stoneware muffin pan.  It made about 9-12 small round meatloaves. WONDERFUL. My kids LOVED it!!! Next time a full batch will be needed. The only downside to baking in a muffin pan is the difficulty in draining off the fat, but worth it!  THANK YOU FOR BRINGING MEATLOAF BACK TO MY TABLE!! Will make again and again.

Great recipe - I've made this several times now with great results every time.  I did however subsitute the bread for Ritz crackers and preferred the taste and texture.

Pretty good!  A little dry, but I have to attribute that to me using 93/7 beef.  Will make again for sure!

This is a fantastic recipe! I added nutmeg to the sauce and Worcestershire to the meat, as suggested by other reviews. I also doubled the sauce. The sauce has such a great kick!

Slam dunk! To be honest, I was skeptical when I read the ingredients but I followed the instructions as precisely as I could, and I it came out slamming!  It's got a sweet taste without being too sweet.  Draining the fat and adding the remaining ketchup mix was a very good tip.  No complaints.

I picked this recipe because of all the stars it got but I was sadly disappointed. The taste was good but it was very dry (and I didn't use lean beef either). I wouldn't make again.

Ok, my boyfriend does not shut up about this meatloaf.  If it were up to him I'd make it every night and it's hard finding a recipe that he falls in love with.  The sauce is the trick, DELICIOUS.  I'm thinking of putting a little extra in the middle of the meatloaf next time I cook it!! The only thing i add to this recipe is a light coat of butter on the pan, I hate when things stick. Thank you for this wonderful recipe--

We were very dissappointed with this meatloaf!  We love meatloaf & have tried many different recipes . . . this was just not right.  Something about the texture was off, although it seemed juicy, it tasted dry.  I think it must be the lemon juice b/c that is the only odd ingredient that I've never seen in meatloaf before.

Of all the meatloafs I have given 4 or 5 stars to,this is the best.
I only made four changes,using saltine crackers instead of bread, one whole beef bouilon cube and extra mustard for six serving and extra lemon juice.
Try this recipe you will like it.

not quite a review, just an idea for the glaze, i use a glaze very similar to this one, to zing it up a little i find a 1/2 shot of dark rum adds to an already very good glaze

My hubby is a meatloaf nut.  He loved your meatloaf.  The glaze was just the right touch.  It made it so tantillizing. The next time I am going to add green pepper but this meatloaf can make even the most picky eater, dig in.

Don't adjust a thing on this recipe, unless you want it spicy for preference. I usually hate meatloaf from growing up with it, but this one was awesome! I don't really eat leftovers either and me and my boyfriend were eating this two meals a day afterwards. Great reheated.

I would give this more stars if I could!!!  The best meatloaf I've ever had.  I did add some   Worcestershire sauce, fresh parsley, 1 whole onion and 4 cloves of garlic.  It was so delish.  My husband and 4 yr. old kept complimenting how great it was.  I crumbled it up and put it in hot dog rolls for my 4 and 3 yr. old.  Definitely a keeper - thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

the meatloaf itself was delicious. i substituted cornflakes for the bread because that is what i have always done...but the sauce....left much to be desired. too too sweet...back to the old tried and true with stewed tomatoes on top!

Was pretty good.  I would use more meat, though.  It shrunk a lot while baking.  I added more ketchup mixture, and used less lemon for a great taste.  Will make again.

This meatloaf is delicious!  I used a pork/beef mixture.  Also, I spread a lot of glaze on the top before baking and did not cover the pan while baking.  The glaze kept the meatloaf VERY moist.  Leftovers great as a sandwich with melted cheddar!

I loved this recipe. I've been making the same meatloaf recipe for 20 years and my family loves it. I personally never really liked it...LOL

I decided to try something new and this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. When I saw the lemon juice I thought it was kind of odd, but it actually was great in this recipe. It's very subtle. Just a hint of lemon and it made the meatloaf very tasty.

I used regular white bread and I tore it by hand into very, very, small pieces. 

The only complaints I got were from my husband who thought the sauce on top was too much and too sweet. He didn't complain about the sauce in the meatloaf, only on top.

Myself, I thought it was awesome.

I will make my meatloaf from this recipe from now on. Just next time I will not put so much sauce on top.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  My family loved it - even my meatloaf hating husband.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was really lowfat but not low on flavor!

We loved this recipe. I did exchange the 3TBS of lemon juice with 3TBS of sweet relish like my mother-in-law uses and we finally found a recipe that tastes like hers. Next time I will make 2 so we actually have leftover for sandwiches the next day.

This is a good recipe but I had to change it to much too really rate it accurately.  First of all I used buffalo ground meat rather then beef, I hear that buffalo is a healthier, leaner cut of meat.  I used soda crackers rather then bread and I used vinegar rather then lemon juice because my son the comedian had used up all my lemon juice in those cute little lemon shaped containers and refilled it with water.  He confessed as he saw me ready to put lemon in my recipe. What a Kid! lol  We had the leftovers in macaroni and a bit of tomato juice the next day. Good way to use up leftovers and it was really good.

I normally am not the biggest meatloaf fan... but my boyfriend mentioned he like it, so I tried this out and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it myself! It was easy to make and really good.. I'd make it again.

EXCELLENT! This is a great meatloaf, I've tried a couple off allrecipes and this has been the best!  I will be making this again very soon.  I doubled the glaze and sauted the onions, perfection.

I am SO picky about meatloaf. Before this recipe, the only meatloaf I liked was my husband's grandmother's, but this is truly better than that even!  
One happy little accident; I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce.  So yummy!  I think it must be the lemon that gives that little extra taste boost; you don't taste the lemon, but it adds an interesting layer of taste.
This one is a keeper!

My first attempt at a meatloaf and, I have to say, it was pretty good. I halved the dried mustard because it seemed like a lot. 

The only thing I'll do differently next time is make a double batch of the glaze in order to put a full batch in with the meat. It was a little bland - but stayed moist and juicy.

Oh, I'd also use a lower fat content ground beef if I was back in the States (here it's one size fits all and the amount of grease that drained off it was disgusting AND messy).

Very good recipe-I used oatmeal instead of bread(personal preference), but everything else the same. Meat was moist and flavorful-will be making again. Thanks for recipe!

The family loved this one!! I used plain dry bread crumbs and it came out perfect. Only downside- it was so yummy there were no leftovers for sandwiches!
I made a double batch of the glaze for extra topping and serving at the table.

Update:
The kids request this at least 3 times a month and love it when I form it into individual sized mini loaves and bake them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment- that way everyone gets "2 end pieces" :)

This was a great recipe!  I made a few alterations and it had a really great taste!  Instead of 2# of lean ground beef, I used 1# lean ground beef and 1# ground turkey -- much less greasy than meatloaf I have had in the past!  I used 3/4 c italian breadcrumbs instead of the bread, added 1 T of BBQ sauce and also layed 3 slices of bacon across the top before baking it!  It was so yummy -- even my husband complemented it!  He ate it with a little Tabasco and he was good to go!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Meatloaf is the best b/c you can add whatever you want for a slightly different taste and its YUMMY!!!

Great flavor. I had some ground beef to use up and was not disappointed. Very easy to prepare. Meat was extremely moist. Went great with some other comfort foods: macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. Added a little bit of garlic, which next time, I will not do. Also, used regular bread crumbs and not bread.

This was pretty good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  It was in the style of a BBQ meatloaf, but not quite there. I think I would prefer more pungent, less sweet.  The meat held together very well and was moist and flavorful even though I used very lean (93%) ground beef.

Excellent recipe.  I made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but the glaze was too sweet for me, so I lessened the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also added a 4th slice of bread to the mixture to make the meatloaf thicker.  It was wonderful!!

I looked forward to trying this recipe but I found the glaze for this meatloaf too sweet to enjoy. However, once I removed the sweet topping, the meatloaf itself was enjoyable.  I would make it again but leave the glaze off.

excellent for meatloaf. I've never been a big fan, but this i liked! I also added a little garlic like a lot of other reviewers, and pulverized the onion in my food processor. Worked like a charm!

Really tasty!  Next time I will make extra sauce though, as I had only enough to pour over the top and found myself wanting some extra to dip in.

This meatloaf was good but a bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will use less brown sugar and will probably not put the glaze on top but just add a little into the meatloaf mixture before cooking.  Oh, my husband and I both don't like to crunch down on onions so I used onion powder instead and also added some black pepper.

I grew up eating meatloaf, so I moved away from making it myself as an adult. This was my first attempt at making a meatloaf, and it turned out pretty good. I love the sweet red glaze.

I skipped the brown sugar altogether and instead of ketchup I substituted Vermont's own Richards BBQ sauce a very good produce in the meat portion I did not use a glaze at all, just my taste on most glazes. Lining my dish was a great idea I did have a little fat at the end but it poured off very easily.

I used a leaner grade of ground beef, so I added two eggs instead of one. My husband loves it.

Loved it! The glaze was so yummy. Considering the glaze for chicken breast. This was a refreshing pop from my usual blah blah meat loaf.  Added to my Faves.

This is wonderful! Enjoyed making & eating—great comfort food. Also, I didn’t find it to be dry as one did—possibly because I used a fattier ground beef (80/20). The glaze was perfect—for those who can safely eat salt, I would recommend seasoning prior to serving or allow individuals to season per their own taste. I use a Sea Salt or Kosher.

I tweak it here & there every time I make it (about  5x now) with inconsistent modifications (that's how I roll!)! It works fantastically as my base recipe.

I did only a few things different  Doubling the recipe, I toasted the bread before crumbling the bread.  Also, I used a quality beef bone broth, about one instead of the beef bouillon cube.  It was moist, without falling apart, and delicious! I'll definitely make this again.

I am not a huge meatloaf fan, but this was amazing.  I made it for myself with the plans of having plenty of leftovers for the family...ooops! I ate way too much but it was hard not going back for seconds and then thirds.

Great meatloaf. The only change I did was have 1 pound of
ground beef and 1 pound of bison. OMG it really states great.
I did not have any issues with a lot of grease like some of the reviews were saying. The sauce was excellent and I made extra to put that over the slices. HOMErun! thanks for sharing

Best meatloaf recipe ever!  The only thing I did differently was to use canned bread crumbs instead of torn bread slices.  Oh, and the suggestion on other reviews to put 2 slices of bread at the bottom of the loaf pan is AMAZING.  Definitely DO THAT!

My fiance doesn't like ketchup so I substituted it with Sweet Baby Ray's sweet & hot barbecue sauce instead of ketchup.  After the first try, I found the recipe a little dry in the center. I suggest splitting the meatloaf into two separate pans, 1lb each, and then after they're done cooking putting a layer of the sauce in the middle and stacking one of the other meat layers on top of it. Comes out great, makes the middle moist. The sauce recipe is delicious.

Meh, this was 'okay' in that it was fine to eat, but I wouldn't call it 'good'. I doubled the sauce as I always like a bit more sauce on top which was a good choice, but I found the inside of the meatloaf super boring with hardly any flavour. I wouldn't make it again.

I sautéed the onion in a little olive oil because I don’t care for crunchy veggies in meatloaf. Otherwise everything was according to the recipe. We loved it! This ones a keeper.

Extremely sweet, and leaves a TON of grease. We put bread on the bottom to soak up the grease, and halved the amount of sugar. With these changes, it's definitely 5 stars!

I really liked this  recipe! It was easy to make and truly yummy with that sweet glaze (although the glaze was a little too sweet for my tastes, but still very good). And I've never thought of putting lemon juice in a meatloaf; that was a surprise but it worked. I did one substitution, and that was substituting the bread cubes with a cup of (gluten free) bread crumbs. For some reason, my meatloaf ended up just a bit crumbly, but OMG it is delicious!!! I can't stop nibbling it. It is definitely a recipe I will make again and again.

Made a couple changes. First I used a silicone large muffin pan. This meant an extra step to complete the glazing. Removed mini loafs to another pan, glazed and finished  baking. Second, I used 1 lb ea of ground beef and pork.  Will definitely make this again.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with ground turkey, rather than beef and because I didn't have any lemon juice, I substituted 1 Tbls cider vinegar in the sauce and an extra egg in the meatloaf to replace the 3 Tbls lemon juice there.   Very good!  Look forward to trying it again with beef and lemon juice.

Fantastic! I used slightly stale grocery store sourdough for the bread, added a dash of worchestershire sauce, some garlic powder, and a cup of cheddar cheese. Otherwise the recipe is great and the sauce is very yummy as written. Kids destroyed it!

By far the best meatloaf I’ve ever had. I use 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of bread. I’ve been asked on multiple occasions for the recipe. And my husband asks for it regularly. Delicious!

I did this meatloaf last night and my family was pretty happy. I don't buy beef bouillon so I used a little bit of soy sauce instead. I didn't have enough ketchup so I added some BBQ sauce. I used oats instead of bread. I also threw some left over cooked quinoa I didn't want to waste + 1 pepper and garlic. Definetely a recipe that I will do again. Next time i will add zucchini and eggplant :)

This was tasty and super juicy. I didn't measure the onions, but it would have been more then suggested probably 1/2 cup . Also used bread crumbs (3/4 cup). Swapped half of the ketchup with a hickory BBQ sauce . My family really enjoyed this.

This is the only meatloaf recipe I've used for years.  I make it with meatloaf mix (comes about 1.3 lb per package though) instead of  ground beef and use about 1/3+ cup (based on the lower mix weight) of bread crumbs  instead of the bread.   I always make extra sauce as my family likes to put some on top  after its on the dish.  I usually make 2 at a time and freeze one for an easy dinner in the future.

The first few times I made it as per the recipe and it was good. I just use lean ground beef and drain if it looks oily. After that I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added an additional egg. I also use panko bread crumbs ( bought the big pack from Costco so I have lots!). I have also started saving  and freezing left over pork or chicken and grind it up with my grandmothers old meat grinder and add them to the beef. This way I use less ground beef and add more flavours to the meatloaf. It turns out great every time!

I made it just like the recipe except I didn't have enough of the lemon juice. Family loved it and I will be making it again. Leftovers were good on sandwiches with a slice of onion and mayo.

This recipe deserves all 5 stars! I have made this recipe close to a dozen times now.  I follow the recipe exactly as written,  and each time it turns out perfect. It's so moist and full of flavor, and it makes delicious meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers. 

One important discovery I made is the importance of how lean the ground beef is .  I found when using 85% lean ground beef , the meatloaf turns out perfect every time. When I used 90% or leaner, the meatloaf is dry and has a terrible texture. 

Other than that, this is definitely a keeper and one my family has loved over and over.  Absolutely a family favorite!

Thanks so much for sharing.

The meat is very bland. It was just too greasy where it had baked in the meat for an hour, and the meat was very dry where it had not baked in the fat.

Let's put it this way, I never was a fan of meatloaf - it's just a brick of dry cooked hamburg.  But with this recipe, not only do I love it but I got my kids to love it.  This is the one tried and true recipe the entire family loves and will eat.  My picky daughter even eats it, which is ah-mahzing!

My daughter says I'm the queen of not sticking to a recipe, and I must say, I didn't disappoint this time either.  I tried very hard, but it's always difficult, because I need to season the meat to my taste.  I really enjoyed this meatloaf, and I'm not a meatloaf eater.  I followed the directions for the glaze exactly, and I thought it was a little too sweet, and I love sweet.  So, I would reduce the amount of brown sugar next time, I'm thinking maybe a fourth cup.  I followed the directions for the meatloaf, but I added, a package of lipton onion soup, garlic powder, onion powder, accent, chopped green peppers, 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, 1 teaspoon of dried marjoram, steak sauce, and Worchester sauce.  I used the crumbled bread, but I wouldn't use that again, as I didn't like that it didn't blend well into the meatloaf.  I'm not sure what I thought it would look like, but bread crumbs will be better.  Again, I must say that I'm a meatloaf eater now.  This will be my new recipe, but I'll try with the corrections.

I love this recipe and that is saying a lot as I generally don't like meatloaf.  I used breadcrumbs instead of  shredding the slices, added a small amount of garlic to the meat and Worcestershire sauce in the glaze just to make it my own.  
My husband loved it so I saved the recipe so I can make it again.

Fabulous!  Substituted some BBQ sauce for 1/3 of the ketchup, used 3/4 cup oats for the bread, sauted some garlic with the onion, and added 1/2 tsp. seasoning salt with a few shakes of Worcestershire in place of the bullion cube.  My package of ground beef was a little shy of 2 lbs. so I added 1 mild Italian sausage to the meat mixture.  Turned out great.  Will be making again.  Can't wait to have a meatloaf sandwich tomorrow.

Have made this many times. I now double the ketchup sauce amount because it tastes so great with the lemon juice.  I also have substituted oatmeal for the bread to accommodate a gluten-free family member....cannot tell the difference!

This has been my "go to" meatloaf recipe for several years.  It is loved by everyone who eats it!  The only change I made was to had 1/4 milk to the mix for moisture and I put the glaze on immediately..  I free form the meatloaf in a 9x13 pan and load small red potatoes all around it.  The juices cook and flavor the potatoes.  I must use a leaner ground beef as excess grease is never a problem.  The best one I ever made was put in a toaster over (free formed) and we had to leave, so I set the timer for 1 hour.   We were gone about 90 minutes and when I took it out, it had the most amazing caramelized glaze over the whole thing.  Was heavenly!

I normally shy away from making meatloaf. No matter what recipes I've used in the past, they always lacked flavor...that is, until NOW.  This was a grand slam with the family!

I very rarely tweak recipes the first time around - subbed dijon for dry mustard and I think that's it. It was fabulous and is about to be gone less than 12 hours afterwards.  Very simple, came out not greasy, not crumbly, not anything other than delicious. Next time, at my son's request, I will double the amount of glaze/sauce I prepare to serve with on the side, because it IS very good.

Surprisingly, I did not make any changes other than adding some pepper. Even used 3 slices of bread which I have never done before (I usually use croutons). This was the best meatloaf and easy to make! Little on sweet side for those who like BBQ/spicy. My husband loved it too. This will now be my staple meatloaf recipe.

This was my favorite meatloaf recipe.  I doubled the sauce and used some for dipping.  Put potatoes in the oven at the same time and it made a wonderful easy dinner.  Add worshtishire(?) to the meat and I didn't use bread I use 1/4 cup oats as binder.

I liked this recipe and after going through a lot of the reviews and knowing my families taste I made changes. I used a lot more garlic and added basil, rosemary and oregano. I used herbed bread crumbs in place of the bread but did put 2 slices of bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease. And lastly I put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top of the meatloaf. I paired it with Garlic loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. My family loved it !!

Very good. I made one change and that was to sub a pound of lean ground turkey for one pound of ground beef--trying to cut out some fat. I liked the lemon flavor and the sauce is great. A keeper.

Really good.  I made it for my 2 and 4 year olds and my in-laws and they all loved it.  I omitted onions though and used orange juice instead of lemon juice which seemed to work okay.  Will definitely make again.

Just like many other reviewers, I double the sauce since everyone loves to add extra to their pieces.  We've also tried it with bread crumbs, oatmeal and bread - a hearty italian seems to be our favorite.  We've also played with adding different peppers (jalapenos are a favorite).

This is the best meatloaf I've had. I make almost exactly as the recipe calls for. I make about 1 1/2 times the topping though, and I also add green bell pepper. My daughter doe n't like onions or bell peppers, so I cut the pieces big. They serve to make the meatloaf more moist, and either fall out, or can be easily picked out by the more "finicky" eaters.

Easy recipe to follow with an outstanding result. I double the glaze amount and pour 1/2 in the loaf and pour the other 1/2 over the loaf. It was a hit with guests and my husband absolutely loves it.

Delicious - really juicy and not dry at all.  I altered the recipe to my liking with using breadcrumbs vs bread and using Onion Soup Mix instead of the chopped onion and bouillon cube.  I also love Worcestershire and Season All, so I added a bit of that as well.

This meatloaf is one of the best I've had! The glaze is nice and sweet and really brings out the flavor of the meat. I like to add green pepper to the meat. I've nade this twice and it's always a hit.

This a the best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried.  We started making it for a church fundraiser dinner 5 years ago and make it every year.  It is our best dinner fundraiser.  The only thing we do differently is we put the bread slices in a food processor to make crumbs and use 1/4 cup = 1 slice.

This was very good if you like really sweet glaze. I measured my brown sugar on the light side, and it was just Almost too sweet, so next time I'll cut it down more. And I used 1 cup bread crumbs and put them in my muffin pan for maximum crust, but they didnt really crust up, and next time I'll definitely bake the glaze on the whole time, bc I waited 10 minutes, and it still didnt really cook on the way I prefer. And I used bread at the bottom and it stuck to my meatloaf when I pulled them out, so be careful about pushing the meat down if there's bread underneath. Will alter next time, but use as a guide. Less sugar, more Worcestershire and garlic.

Amazingly good meatloaf!  I didn't think I would have enough glaze, but I did and nobody dipped there's in bbq sauce, which happens often with meatloaf around here.  Good flavor :)

I tried this recipe but with a few changes. I use a pork/hamburger blend for more flavor. I didn't use lemon juice, but I did use a small amount of limeade concentrate in place, and used regular mustard instead of the dry in the sauce. I also omitted the bouillon. As I am NOT a fan of just throwing tomatoes  or tomato sauce on top a meatloaf, I thought the sauce was a step up from using just regular ketchup. I did use oats instead of bread, and added some garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. My family enjoyed it as a switch up from the status quo meatloaf.

I had to use a chicken cube instead. Also added some chopped mushrooms plus 3/4 cup of oatmeal instead of the bread. I didn't double the sauce because I only had 1 lb. ground beef not 2.

Family of picky eaters that hated the thought of meatloaf night.   Tried this one tonight.  They really enjoyed it.  My wife that does not each leftovers wanted me to cut a slice for the tomorrow's dinner. Thanks for the new meatloaf recipe for our family.

Excellent recipe, I actually really dislike meatloaf, but wanted to make it for my fiancé. I found this recipe and picked it because others said it changed their mind about meatloaf. And it did!  Yummy!  And I double the sauce recipe and brown the onions before adding to the loaf.

This was great, I changed a few things. Used regular yellow mustard, 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of shredded bread and albs Ground turkey instead of beef for the sake of my health :-)

The whole family enjoyed this meatloaf. I doubled the sauce and put more in the meat, and then had more left for dipping as well.  The last time I made it, I made it in muffin tins and it worked really well.  Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes and then put glaze and cooked 10 more.

I doubled the recipe and used 3/4 cups of plain bread crumbs along with 3 slices of bread. Moist and tasty! It was a big hit with my picky eaters! Makes amazing leftovers too!!!!

I used sweet and low instead of brown sugar and 1 tbs yellow mustard instead of 1 tsp mustard powder.  It ended up being very flavorful for such a simple meatloaf, one of the best meatloaves I've ever had.  I also mixed all of the glaze in with the meatloaf instead of reserving some for the top.

Best meatloaf ever.  Flavor and texture was great.  I did replace the bread with 3/4 cup oats and took advice of placing bread slices at the bottom of the pan to soak up the fat.

I was alittle skeptical of the recipe, "what no salt, no pepper"! I also didn't have brown sugar but found on the web that brown sugar is white sugar with molasses, so I made some and followed the recipe. My husband and I loved it. The sauce on top was sweet but not too sweet. Perfect.  This is a keeper.

This is amazing! I followed recipe exactly EXCEPT I used deer meat. It is wonderful; not greasy, and more lean than ground beef. My husband is particular when it comes to main dishes and this rates high on his list. Thanks for sharing this.

This is a great recipe, my kids are very picky eaters and have never eaten meatloaf without me standing over them.  This recipe turned out very moist and the flavor was wonderful. I used a meatloaf mix and followed recipe exactly.  Will definately make again even my boys had seconds

Using the bread in the bottom of the pan is an excellent idea. I made extra glaze like some of the others recommended- it was wonderful. My favorite part of making meatloaf is having leftovers to make meatloaf sandwiches- don't count on leftovers with this recipe!  : )

The BEST meatloaf I have ever had.  I made the recipe as stated and my daughter was freaking out when I added lemon juice, but the whole family really enjoyed it (My year old son and two year old grandson, especially).  Very good thank you.

The best meatloaf I've made. The only thing I might add next time is some worcestire sauce. Delicious!(and i'm not a big meat-eater)

This was my first attempt ever at making meatloaf. It's a shame I think that meatloaf in general seems to have kind of a bad rep. It is so easy and tastes great. My family (including 3 kids) loved this recipe. Will definately be a regular meal in our household!

I first made this dish while studying abroad in Italy.  While the food there was fantastic, my roommates and I were craving a bit of home.  This meatloaf hit the spot.  Beyond amazing. Two years later and I still get requests for the recipe.  The recipe has also been a success stateside for the picky eaters in the house.

My husband and my son always asked for this dish! Its easy to prepare and doesnt take long to cook. I add a can of tomato sauce and a touch of ketchup to the recipie because my husband doesn't like it that sweet.(I always have to make extra sauce for my son) I also chop the onion smaller and tear the bread cumbs into smaller pieces. You can also add italian style bread cumbs and make it into small balls for spagetti and meatballs.

My "I hate meatloaf" husband LOVES this recipe!  This is almost identical to the recipe my mother used many moons ago, but I couldn't convince him to try it.  I finally just went ahead and surprised him and now he and my kids love it.  We rarely have leftovers and I triple the recipe!

This is the best meatloaf recipe that I have ever made!  I added ground red pepper because my family like spicy foods and omitted the beef boullion.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This meatloaf is wonderful!!!!! I have finally found one that my family loves.  The only thing different that I did was use dehydrated onions instead of slicing the real ones and I doubled the glaze recipe because my family are dippers. I will definitely be fixing this again!

This is the first meatloaf I have ever made,and it came out perfect!  Everyone raved.  I did double the glaze and used two eggs instead of one.  then I added a package of onion soup dry mix to the meat.  Perfect!

This is a delicious meatloaf that my husband and I as well as my son love.  My son doesn't like onions so I have to make a seperate one for him without onions.  I love the glaze although the sugar could be cut down a little.

being a not-bad cook, my head sometimes get a bit too big for my toque & i bypass the instructions completely, figuring that i'm genius enough to put the ingredients together properly and have it turn out perfectly. well, i had i read through the instructions like a normal person, i would NOT have put the glaze ingredients into the loaf itself ... but i didn't, so i did (although i cut the sugar in half, thinking that that was a bit too much sweetness for a meatloaf...and i used a half-cup or so of bread crumbs since i had no bread).   anyhow, after an hour it turned out great: it was savory and sweet and since i have a cool bread loaf-shaped pan equipped with a draining contraption  on the bottom, all the excess liquid seeped out, so it wasn't gross and mushy. i also broiled it for the last 5, 6 minutes so the top got lightly browned and crispy. it wasn't the best meatloaf everrr, but with a bit of tweaking, worth the four stars.

Made a few modifications to this recipe to make it vegan.  Swapped the ground beef for soy crumblers, egg for egg replacer, and beef bouillon for a vegan substitute.  I'm not sure if it was the substitutions or if I just didn't do something correctly, but it didn't hold together in slices outside of the pan.  Despite ending up in a pile on the plate, rather than as a slice of a loaf, it was still very, very good.

Mmmmmmm....this was the BEST meatloaf I have ever had.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, here's the changes I made to mine:  followed other reviewers and split the amount of lemon juice with balsamic vinegar, added a lot of garlic powder to the meat mixture (we really love garlic at our house), a splash of Worcestershire sauce, diced up some red peppers for colour and flavour, dried parsley and a little bit of chili sauce (the sweet kind).  I also doubled the sauce because I like my meatloaf saucy!  This was amazing, and I will be making it my staple meatloaf recipe from now on.  Thanks for the awesome recipe! :D

I've never seen my husband eat so much meatloaf at one sitting!  We both really enjoyed the sweet BBQ-sauce-style glaze.  I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to use half lemon juice and half balsamic vinegar in the glaze, and to double the glaze.  I used crushed crackers in place of the bread with good results.  This will be my main meatloaf recipe from now on!

This is a great meatloaf recipe.  I have made it several times.  I found Chipotle cubes in the dry soup section and use one of those instead of the beef bullion cube.  Adds a nice touch of spice.

Too sweet- only my sweet tooth daughter who hates meatloaf loved it.  Might be ok with less sugar and bread crumbs instead of torn bread

I have tried several meatloaf recipes and have never really been a big fan of meatloaf because it's just kinda blah. This is not blah and is now the only meatloaf recipe I use. I don't make any modifications and it turns out great every time!

was good but a little sweet for our taste, if you like a sweet red sauce on your spaghetti you will probably love this.

Very flavorful meatloaf.  There definitely is a twang with the lemon juice- in a nice way.  I loved the idea of the other reviewer to blend the ingredients in the mixer.  It make a much smoother texture.  I too broiled for the last few minutes to make the glaze on top bubble.  I can't wait for the leftovers on a sandwich!

This meatloaf has a good texture and flavor.  I give it 4 1/2 stars (instead of 5) because it's not the basic homey meat loaf you MIGHT be looking for.  It's kinda tangy sweet n' sour.  If you're looking for something a little different and tangy, this would be a 5.

Muey delicioso! Of course, I didn't follow it to the absolute letter... I like flavor baked in, so I added some catsup, BBQ, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce, and garlic to the beef before mashing. I also - as someone else mentioned - like to use "good" (Kirkland Honey Wheat & Walnut - yum!) bread, even though my kids complain about it. Adds nice texture and good flavor! And I use some BBQ to replace the catsup in the sauce, as I think it tastes better that way. It comes out very moist, and the flavor was so good that you didn't even need to add extra catsup or BBQ - though my children do, anyway...

Best meatloaf ever with the following changes: double the ketchup (but not the other sauce ingredients) and use 1/4 cup in the meat mixture. Omit the lemon juice and beef broth and add in 1/4 cup of Worcestershire Sauce and 1/4 cup of sour cream to the meat. Add freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix lightly and you have a tender and juicy loaf.

This recipe was very good - my husband who loves meatloaf, but only if it's great absolutely loved it.  I didn't have any bouillon cubes so I substituted a packed of onion soup mix.  I also made another batch of 3 small loaves and froze them- they even tasted great when I defrosted them, but I made some extra glaze over the burner.

I followed the recipe exactly, but my husband and I weren't too impressed.  My son loved the sweet glaze, but the meat was very bland.  My normal meatloaf recipe uses garlic flavored croutons (crushed fine in food processor) instead of plain bread which adds lots of flavor. I would recommend trying that with this recipe.

I have always like Meatloaf, especially on bread the day after for lunch. This was a hit with the whole family- and the best part is I made it with ground venison. It was tasty, moist- but without any of the fat.

First of all...lining the baking dish with bread slices to absorb the grease is a brilliant idea and works!!! I've been trying all kinds of meatloaf recipes and my husband hasn't cared for any of them until this one!  He's not a catsup fan, but he loves the topping on this one.  I also changed it up a bit, I added finely diced green pepper, a dash of worcestersauce sauce, used oats instead of bread and regular yellow mustard.  I also used splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar. We own a catering company and this recipe has replaced our old one for our clients and now he eats it too. We make an extra batch of sauce because our clients all want more. This one's a keeper!

Love it...but I do love meatloaf. I used 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I forgot to add the ketchup mixture to the meatloaf...opps. So I only cooked it for 45 minutes for fear it would be dry. It was still great even after the additional 10 minutes with the sauce..and it was cooked! WHEWW! Everyone liked the sauce but now I am curious to add balsalmic..hmm!
THANKS!!

Just made this meat loaf for the first time and it is delicious! I never liked meat loaf because of the grease factor ... the whole thing soaking in all that grease, no matter how lean the meat, but with the bottom of the pan lined with bread, problem solved. Thanks so much for the great recipe. I made no changes in ingredients or preparation except for lining the pan with bread.

I made this yesterday night and was very pleased with the result. I did make changes. My mom uses a similar recipe for the sauce: 1/2 c. ketchup, 6 tbsp. brown sugar, 2 tsp. dry mustard, and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. It's awesome if you like a barbecue/sweet flavor. For my meat, I added 1/2 c. diced onion, 1/4 c. diced green pepper, 1/4 c. diced red pepper, used only 1 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, and added an extra egg. I also added 1/4 tsp. Garlic Salt and 1/2 tsp. Pepper. It turned out fab, although I cooked it a little too long...1 hour and 20 minutes when I should have stuck to the stated cooking time. Very pleased and husband enjoyed it as well!

I haven't had any luck trying to make meatloaf. This recipe is a keeper! I 
wish I had doubled the glazed portion. I handed the ketchup bottle to the family to squeeze on their individual slices. Perhaps next time I will add a small can of diced tomatoes to the sauce. Personal preference only. Otherwise this meatloaf is good.

I was looking for a different recipe then the one that I had and find this one.  Wasn't sure at first but decided to give it a try.  It turned out delicious.  My boyfriend loved it.  I just changed two things.  I used seasoned bread crumbs because it was easier for me.  I didn't have any beef bouillon cubes but I had the granulated kind so I used 1 tsp of that.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really good.  The glazed was really good too.  I think this will be a keeper for me.

My husband and I love this meatloaf, it's so easy and never any leftovers. Although he is not a fan of onions so sometimes I’ll use a few dried onion flakes or French’s fried onions (he loves those)  I also add ½ cup bread crumbs for a tasty texture. YUM

Have made this many times now because the family loves it.  Used the italian bread crumbs per some other reviews, also I always use regular prepared mustard in the sauce and reduce the brown sugar just a bit.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is very similar to "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" also found on this site...but not quite as good.

Very good glaze...I like my meatloaf recipe slightly better, so I think I'll just steal the glaze from this recipe and put it on my meatloaf! Thanks very much for submitting it!

This is the homey recipe you're looking for. You won't be disappointed. Moist, Tasty, Easy to make.
I substituted oats for the bread crumbs for a slightly healthier version.

This was a delicious meatloaf. I agree with other reviews that the glaze is much too sweet. I would probably only use a few tablespoons of brown sugar.  I also used 1 lb. of lean ground pork instead of 1 of the lbs. of ground beef, and used wheat bread.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T".  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I will use this as my meatloaf recipe from now on, other than reducing the brown sugar in the glaze.

Good starter meatloaf. The only thing I did differently was that I used extra spicy english mustard (didn't have dry). This recipe tasted good and allows room to be more creative (adding different vegetables etc). Lining the bottom of the pan with bread slices is a very good idea.

I usually never stray from my own meatloaf recipie, which I just made up, but i thought i would try something differerent. This was alright however it was kinda mushy and tasted mostly like ketchup.  My boyfriend and our son didn't care for it to much and niether did I.  He said my meatloaf was much better and he prefered it more.  Needless to say I will stick with my traditional meatloaf in the future.

Pretty good...maybe better without my changes, so five stars anyway!!  Did not use the boullion due to sodium content; used half ground beef and half sausage due to lack of planning (what I had).  I like lemon juice as an complementary ingredient but thought the meat mixture perhaps had too much, re:  I could actually TASTE the lemon juice instead of the juice enhancing the other ingredients as in the glaze mixture.  That could be due to omitting the boullion.  I will definately use this recipe again.  The glaze was very good.

I really enjoyed the glaze!  I doubled the reciped for the glaze because I put more in the meatloaf and more on top.  Also, I used Ground Sirloin and I didn't have any fat to drain off.

I don't even like meatloaf --- I made this for my husband and I ended up eating two helpings the first night and two helpings of leftovers the next night! Give this a try (oh, and definitely double the glaze!!!) Incredible ... thanks for a new favorite!

I just love this site and I love reading all of the suggestions.  This was delicious. I read all of the reviews on this - took many different suggestions and worked with it. This was so Scrum-ditaley-umcious.  My husband told me that he wants to make it our new family recipe. I gave it a four only because I finagled it.  Tips that I took: Added 1 Tbls. Worcestershire, used French Fried Onions instead of regular onions, doubled the sauce but cut WAY BACK on the Brown Sugar, used 1 cup of Italian Bread crumbs instead of bread cubes, only put 2 tbls. of lemon in the beef mixture.  I also added some Kosher Salt, Black pepper, a few shakes of Garlic powder and Onion salt to the meat mixture.  (Don’t overdo it) After applying the glaze, I broiled the meatloaf on high for about 3 minuts. Happy Cooking!

This meatloaf was an absolute dream for me, being the ONLY meatloaf I've ever made that I was proud to serve. It was moist, satisfying and very easy to make. I think, however, I added too much garlic. I don't think the recipe called for it, but I added about 1 and 1/2 tsp of fresh minced garlic to the mix before baking...it was a bit strong. Next time I'll cut that in half. I'm sure it would still be wonderful w/out the garlic alltogether. Thank you for a meatloaf recipe that I will continue to make, and one that stands out from the rest :)

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  My fiance and I both agree this is the beast meatloaf we have ever eaten. I made 2 substitutions only because I did not have the exact items called for on hand. Used 1 tsp of beef boullion granules instead of the cube and used 1/2 of quick oats in lieu of the bread. The meatloaf was delicious and I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

The glaze on this meatloaf was awful!  I am a total meatloaf girl and have never met one I didn't like until now.  The glaze was WAY too sweet.  Even my kids didn't like it.

Good tasting recipe.  I used 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck and 1/2 lb sausage and plain yellow mustard.  Husband ate three pieces  and daughter who doesn't like meatloaf ate a whole piece, also.  Will make again but will cut down on lemon juice in meat mixture.  I also tried the bread in bottom of the pan as it sounded like a great idea - I will never do that again.  It was just a soggy mess on the bottom of the meatloaf.  It did come off easy and didn't change the taste at all but it's a step that I just don't think was worth it.

I usually hate meatloaf, but this is BY FAR the best recipe for meatloaf that I have ever tried.  Everyone I've served it to loves it!  The glaze is a great finishing touch - I will never bother with the canned stuff again!

This is the best meatloaf recipe-the glaze really makes it stand out! It's better than the one that's been passed down in my family (sorry Mom!). I did double the glaze also, and their were no leftovers! I serve it with mashed potatoes and peas, sooo good!

My family loved this recipe, the lemon juice added an extra taste to the glaze.  This is an added favorite at our house.  I also used oatmeal instead of the bread.

This was great!  It definately was a sweet glaze--I can see how some wouldn't be fond of this--but my family loved it.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly, except omitted one tablespoon of lemon juice in the actual meat at the suggestion of some previous posts.  My family all enjoyed this meal, and it's definately one that I will make again.  As suggested, I also doubled the glaze recipe, with great results.  I ended with it under the broiler for a few minutes until it was all bubbly.  Definately a keeper.

It is good but personally I need a pinch of regular or onion salt.  It was a little bland without it for my taste.
With that, it was very good.

We don't eat meatloaf often and I usually make the Lipton soup meatloaf recipe but wanted to make something different.  We loved this recipe!  I didn't have bread or dry mustard but as another person suggested, used the rolled oats and regular mustard.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use old fashioned or quick cooking.  Had old fashioned on hand so I used that and it seemed to work OK!  Doubled the sauce as someone suggested.  It might have been a little overkill so I may not double it next time.  Will make again!

My husband loves meatloaf and I am slowly becoming a fan. I made this recipe and it was very good. I substituted 1 cup italian bread crumbs for the bread. I also used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 lean ground beef to cut the fat a bit. Instead of the crumbled beef bouillon, I used 1 tsp of beef bouillon granules. Next time I think I will add more onion (and I am not a huge onion fan) and maybe some garlic to give it a little more flavor. The meatloaf was very moist and not at all greasy (I didn't have any fat to drain off when I got to that step). Will definitely try again!

very tasty...used steak sauceinstead of ketchup in the burger mix...only thing i found was when slicing it, it seemed to break apart...next time will add another egg to help keep it together..also broiled the glaze for a couple of minutes.

Very good!  I was pleasantly surprises because meatloaf never "wows" me.  I doubled the sauce and added the slices of bread to the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease like one reviewer suggested.  I will now include meatloaf in my meal rotation!

This meatloaf was awesome.  I made it last night for my husband and 1 year old son and they both loved it!  I don't eat beef so I substituted ground turkey and chicken bullion but left everything else the same.  I am not a big meat eater and I actually went back for seconds if that explains how delicious it was!

This was very easy to make. It also makes good leftovers as a meatloaf sandwich. It was however a little too zingy so next time I will cut down on the lemon juice.

I wasn't paying enough attention, goofed and used ketchup "with a kick" (had tobasco sauce added).  My boyfriend raved and said it was WAY better than him mom used to make.  I have an open invitation to make this with my "mistake" anytime I want.

There needs to be a five+ for this one, my children are already asking when I'm going to make it again. Who would have thought something with the dreaded ketchup in it would taste so good ?
I have never made, or eaten meatloaf before, being from England it's just not something that we have there. But I'm going to be making it from now on :D
Thank you, this is one for my kitchen drawer.

My boyfriend really loved this recipe. I forgot the beef bouillon at the store, so I added a little crushed garlic. Also I added 1/4 of a bell pepper. That really added some flavor. My boyfriend suggested next time to add olives.

Yummm! This was delicious!! I changed it up a bit with ingrediants I had. Instead of beef bullion I used 1 bullion of Tomate y Pollo. I'm a latin cook. And for a little kick 1 diced jalapeno. Then after cooking for the alotted time I piled on homemade mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese. We used the sauce to put on our individual servings since my son does not like sweet mixed with his food. Everyone loved it better than my old recipe and this was easy. Thanks!!

I do not make Meatloaf very often just because I never had a good recipe.  But that changed today!  This will become a must make in my house from now on!  I made the recipe just as wrote, except for the bouillon, I did not have it that is why it was omitted.  I loved the added sweetnes from the sauce!  Great Recipe!

As far as meatloaf goes, this one is very good.  I've made it twice and we all loved it.  Next time I will make it with veal, beef and pork instead of all beef.

This was good, but a little too sweet for my taste buds.  I would reduce the sugar next time.

This was too bland for me.  All I could taste was beef and lemon.  The glaze was okay, but I guess I'm the kind of meatloaf person who likes some more spice and salt; more traditional I suppose

My family said it was the best meatloaf ever!  I swapped the slices of bread for 1/2 cp of oatmeal and added 1/3 cp grated mushrooms and beef base(instead of cubes).  The texture was out of this world!  I've never used lemon juice in meatloaf so maybe that was the difference.  I'll use it from now on!!

Excellent meatloaf recipe.  We use buffalo instead of ground beef.  I did add some wersteshire (sp?) and garlic to my buffalo.  I also used half ketchup and half barbecue sauce.

The best meatloaf ever!  I made this for the first time about a month ago and my hubby and oldest child have requested this every week since!  Hubby is a big lover of ketchup on his meatloaf, so this recipe is perfect for him with the glaze mixed in and on top.  Gives a terrific flavor and the lemon juice gives a nice zing to it!  Last week when I made it I only had half a cup of ketchup so I subsituted the other half with barbecue sauce.  Very interesting and tasty variation I thought I would share.  Thanks, for a kick butt recipe!!!

I only used 1 lb. of beef, and I added some Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and a few crackers in place of one piece of bread.  Mine was a tad mushy for my tastes, but I'm sure it was because I only used 1 lb. of beef.  All in all, though, it tasted GREAT!  The sauce on top was awesome!

I thought this was pretty good, although my boyfriend didn't care for it. I didn't use the boullion cube because we are on a low sodium diet. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I would probably make this again.

This is great! I doubled the sauce and I am glad I did! I also added a dash of nutmeg to the sauce because that's how my Dad always made it. Delicious! Very moist! My 2 and 3 year old loved it! I will definitely be making this regularly!

This recipe turned out great for us. We had to substitute saltine cracker crumbs for bread crumbs though.  It was so good and moist that my parents decided to eat with us; a nice surprise but, unfortunately, that meant no leftovers!

2 out of 4 people in my family liked this.  I thought it was bland and the glaze was a little sweet.  I'll probably make it again, but add some spices to the meatloaf and cut back on the brown sugar.

The best meatloaf I've ever made or eaten.  It was simple to prepare and delicious to eat.  Made exactly as recipe stated minus the dry mustard as I didn't have this, and I also used dehydrated onions and it came out FANTASTIC !!!! Thanks for a new meatloaf recipe.

I found it good but a little to dry, to long to cook (should be about 45-50 min. then glaze on 400degrees for 5-8min.  I will use glaze again on my own meatloaf receipe.

Out of a family of four, two really liked this recipe.  I myself thought it was good, but nothing special.  1 hour is too long for 2lbs of meat and it was a little dry.  The sauce on top never "glazed."  But all of it got eaten up that same night very quickly.

It was great! Everyone totally loved it. Especially the sweetness added by the brown sugar. I used about 1/3 cup of bread crumps instead of bread but it still turned out great.

I hesitate to say I made this meatloaf b/c I made quite a few modifications. I used a pound of hamburger and a pound of pork, didn't use boullion but used onion soup mix, 2 eggs, and 2/3 of a cup of seasoned breadcrumbs. Regardless, it was very good! I asked my husband if he thought it was maybe a little too sweet...he said maybe a bit, so I would probably cut down the brown sugar to half. It was very good though, and we enjoyed it very much, especially the glaze. Definitely a keeper!  :)

Didn't really care for the texture.  I was looking for something with a little more flavor. My kids are meatloaf fanatics and they didn't care for this one. I'll stick to my Mom's recipe.

Excellent meatloaf. I wanted to try something different than my usual recipe and I think this recipe just became my new "regular" recipe. Husband and I both enjoyed very much. There is just enough lemon to give a little tang but it's not overwhelming. Also, as someone else pointed out, it's not greasy at all. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night. I would add crushed garlic and some mixed herbs for more flavour. You could also substitute the ketchup for barbeque sauce if you wanted to. It was nice, but needed some more flavour.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had!!
We didn't have any eggs so I omitted that, and used 2 pieces whole wheat bread, and added a little Worchestershire sauce to the meat, but other than that I followed the recipe. My whole family liked it!

This is easy and quick. I have two picky toddlers and both of them will eat this. I have made this in a 8x8 pan before and it was good. As long as  there is enougt glaze to cover it all it is a hit at my house.

I liked the meatloaf, but I didn't really like the sauce. I think that I prefer a more tomato taste, and not sweet.

Very good.  The glaze is delicious and simple to make. I added chopped red onion, cracked pepper, salt and Cheez-it crackers.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

Good recipe and I will make it again.  Next time I will add a bit of salt as I found it a little bland (although it could have been because I didn't have beef bouillon on hand).  I also cut back on the bread.

Wonderful flavor in a quick meatloaf that had my meatloaf fearing husband asking for seconds.  Even the little ones wanted more.  We often double the recipe, double the "sauce", and add parsley!  Great recipe!

the meatloaf itself was really good, it was very moist and the shredded bread was a good touch.  i added about a tablespoon of worchestire sauce, a bit more onion then the recipe called for and some garlic powder, salt and some asian beef soup stock instead of bouillan.  the sauce was too sweet on top for me, next time i'll use some stewed tomatoes on top. i will keep the sauce in the meatloaf itself though.  overall, very good, the bf said he doesnt usually like meatloaf, but this time he cleaned his plate!

Excellent.  I normally modify the recipes on here to a whole new thing- but this one I pretty much left alone- except I used red onion (what I had on hand) which went well cause the sauce was sweet... and I always make meatloaf with some ground beef, some ground pork.  Other than that- left it alone.  Very easy and relatively quick to prepare.  Thanks for a great recipe - Classic Meatloaf!

This was very tasty.  My kids loved every bite!! It is rare that something can be served at dinner that every one is pleased with.  I did change just a tad.  I didn't use onions, instead I used garlic powder, fresh honey and s&p. Will make again and again.

This was REALLY good! We love the sweet and sour sauce on top. I make them into "meat muffins" in a muffin pan and bake them at 375 for about 20 minutes before adding the sauce. You might like to double the sauce. I like a lot on mine. I also used 1T. dried minced onions and 1T. water instead of the onions, since I didn't have any on hand.

Everyone enjoyed this meal - great with mashed potatoes.  I was a little short on the lemon juice (only had one lemon), so I added a tablespoon of pineapple juice to the meat along with the lemon juice.  This is a keeper.

I am on this site all the time and this is only the second time I've taken the time to rate/review a recipe, that should tell you how good this is! I only used 1 lb of ground beef, but I didn't change anything else. I just eyeballed the amount of onion and sauce I mixed in with the meat. I also had to use crumbled up hot dog rolls (I forgot to get regular bread when I was at the grocery store). The glaze was sweet and tangy, but I think that's what makes it so unique and delicious! Definitely a keeper in my book.

I have to admit that I make this once every other week or so. When I shop, I create a list off of allrecipes.com and this recipe is almost always on the "shop for" list. It is quick and easy (I like to make it in the morning and put it in a loaf pan to throw in the oven in the evening.) I don't change a thing and the sauce on top always makes the loaf. Thank you for this add- it is a great recipe that my family asks for again and again.

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan, but had a sudden pregnancy craving for some.  This is a great and easy recipe.  It's not just the hormones talking, my husband and picky 5 year old loved it too.  The only change I made was accidental. . . I thought I had lemons but didn't so substituted the same amount of lime juice to keep the tart addition.  I'm sure the lemon juice keeps the same great flavor.
Another added bonus is that this recipe is KID FRIENDLY.  My five year old could help stir the sauce and pat the formed loaf with a spoon.  She loved making this.

I've tried about every meatloaf out there, and, admittedly, it is hard to mess it up.  However, this one is great.  The lemon juice gives it such a nice flavor, don't be afraid to use it!  I added some garlic powder, and my husband raved!

Excellent meatloaf! Even my 4 year old, who is a picky eater, loved this. I didn't have any dry mustard, so I used regular yellow mustard instead and it was delicious.

This is so great!  I changed the amount of breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup, but other than that, did everything as listed.  I've been searching for years for a great meatloaf recipe and finally found one.  My husband and son loved it too.  Really, really good!

My boyfriend and I really liked this one!  The meat stayed juicy and was not dry.  I omitted the dry mustard because I find it a bit overpowering, but it was fine without.

It was really very good, but I wouldn't call it the best I have ever had. I do agree that the glaze makes it. It would be very bland without it.

loved the glaze!  the meatloaf itself was a little bland though.  I will add more of the glaze to the meat mixture next time, along with my usual seasonings.

This recipe is GREAT!  I have only made meatloaf one other time, but this one definately was the best meatloaf my husband and I ever had!  I didn't change a thing.  I think next time I will try half turkey and half lean ground beef so it's healthier.  I'm sure it will still taste delicious!

I love this website and get all my recipes from here, however, this is the first review I have ever written.  THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE.  Moist, flavorful and a perfect consistency.  I altered the recipe by using half ground turkey and half beef.  I also used corn flakes instead of bread.

My finicky girls ate it so fast we didn't even see it. I'll be dicing or mincing the bread next time, though. Smaller pieces. Other than that, GREAT recipe.

This was pretty good, although I didn't care for the lemon juice in the meatloaf.  It just didn't seem to fit into the mix.  But all in all, it was good. I probably won't make it again since I prefer my old standby meatloaf recipe, but if I ever decide to, I'll leave out the lemon juice.

This meatloaf was very good.  Straight out of the oven, I did not think it was quite as good as our normal meatloaf fare - which includes cheese and cream of mushroom soup.  The leftovers, however made excellent sandwiches - the taste and texture are just right.  I particularly liked the glaze.

This is quite tasty but the meat is a bit too bland and the topping is a bit too sweet tasting for our liking, due to the tomato sauce and brown sugar. I think it needs some herbs and salt and pepper added to the mix. Next time I might make it again without the brown sugar.

This is great! My husband & picky toddler both loved it! I used bread crumbs instead of bread (just because I was out of bread!) and it worked well. Great flavor!

Great recipe, I did however make some changes which my family thought made it even better.
For the glaze I would defintely double it. I changed the brown sugar to 1/4 c and add 1/2 TBS vinegar.  To the beef I added 1/2 c. celery, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 1 TBS parsley,1/2 package dry onion soup mix,1 /4 c oatmeal,and changed the lemon juice to 4 TBS and the bread to 3/4 c. seasoned bread crumbs and 1/4 plain bread crumbs.  Next time i might cut back on the onios and use all the onion soup pkg.

Great Meatloaf! I already have a recipe that I really like but thought I would try this one out. Very moist. I made 1 1/2 times the sauce and used 3 Tbs. of brown sugar. The little extra sauce was perfect! Thanks for sharing Delia!
