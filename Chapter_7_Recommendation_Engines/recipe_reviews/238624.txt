This was sooo good. I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving and got an 8 oz drink.  I used mangos that I had previously frozen so I omitted the ice and I used Truvia instead of the sugar. Yummy, I will make this often.

The flavor was just not enjoyable. Thatâ€™s a personal preference. I did make it how it was supposed to be. It was bitter like the papaya.
