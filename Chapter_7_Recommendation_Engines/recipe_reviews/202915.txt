Sorry to give such a low rating, but I felt I have to share the information to prevent others to go through the same results.  Please do NOT use 4 teaspoons of salt!!!  I was not sure so I only used 3 teaspoons of salt with everything else exact as the recipe.  It still came out really salty to the point that I could not take more than two pieces. It might be a typo.  But please, if you try this recipe, dramatically decrease the salt.

OMG! These were amazing.  We made them exactly as stated the first time and they were wonderful.  With Christmas fast approaching, I always have lots of nuts on hand, so we tried mixing other nuts in and the result was even better (pecans, walnuts, peanuts, cashews).  We also used Kosher salt and black pepper.  Thank you for the holiday treat.

I think the salt HAS to be a typo.  Based on the other review, I used 3 tsp of salt and it was still too much.  If I were to make this again, I'd use 1 or 2.  Also the maple syrup never really absorbed.  Even after putting the nuts back for another 10 minutes.  I think a sugar-based recipe would work better.  I felt like there could be just a touch more cayenne and more sweetness.   The spices are right, the recipe just needs some tinkering.

I liked these nuts.  They were buttery.  I did not use that much salt as others mentioned.  I did however add more cayenne to "spice" it up some.  Very good little snack.
