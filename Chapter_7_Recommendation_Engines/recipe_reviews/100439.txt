Easy prep, taste great! I cooked my bacon for a few minutes in the microwave beforehand, sprinkled it with applewood seasoning, wrapped it and threw it on the grill... big hit... thanks!!!

Success!  Served these as part of a neighborhood brunch and they were very well received.  Used green asparagus as that's what I had on hand and precooked the bacon.  Glad I did, they turned out perfectly!

Try this with a little maple syrup as a glaze, before baking or grilling.

This is absolutely wonderful! I love asparagus and mushrooms already and who doesn't like bacon? What a wonderful marriage of ingredients. Thanks to the submitter of this recipe from someone who actually made it and ate it! It was a house-wide success!!

Very easy and tasty! Everyone was so impressed. I would suggest that you use "thick cut" bacon with this recipe. It just holds better than regular bacon but it will be great either way. I did change a few things: I used steamable asparagus in the bag instead of fresh and I steamed it for just 1.5 minutes so as to only cook it slightly (since I discovered steamable asparagus I rarely ever use fresh anymore, for some reason I can never achieve the same tenderness with fresh that I can with frozen!) And I GENEROUSLY sprinkled the asparagus with garlic powder before wrapping in bacon. Delish! Will make again and again!

These were DIVINE!!! The juices of the bacon and the asparagus were to die for! The only thing I did was boil the asparagus longer to make it easier to bite into. Soft, tender asparagus wrapped in mouth watering bacon..LOVE IT!!! Want to make it again!

My 8 year son old tried to eat them all!  Next time I will make many more. I had to modify since I was missing ingredients.  I didn't have the mushrooms and we use turkey bacon.  The asparagus was seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper before wrapping.  I didn't blanch the asparagus as mine was very thin.

A family hit!  The only thing I did differently was I brushed with homemade teriyaki sauce before I put it in the oven.  I did have to change the aluminum foil and put them in the broiler for 2 minutes on each side to crisp the bacon. Turn out beautifully!  Thank you for sharing - this recipe is a definite keeper!

I've made these twice and though very tasty I had trouble getting the bacon done enough without crisping the asparagus.

This was soooo good! I used thick cut bacon slices & put them in the oven for about 16-17 mins. I also did NOT blanch the asparagus, just wrapped and put in oven on wire rack. Delicious!

Yum, I used this a base for what I was making. Used frozen baby beans, thawed and drained, and sprinkled some salt, pepper, brown sugar and chili flakes on it. Wrapped the bacon around the beans and secured it with a toothpick. Baked at 200deg C for 15 minutes, flipped it, and baked for another ten or so minutes. Made for a very pretty presentation. I was aiming to reduce fat (as much as I could at least, since bacon was involved), so I put a generous amount of beans on the bacon, and could only fold the bacon over with about an inch on each side. Also used foil on my pan for easy clean up.

Difficult to get bacon cooked evenly and cooking that close to broiler creates a lot of smoke but liked the outcome.

Easy to prepare and DELICIOUS! Took twice as long to brown the wrapped bacon (25-30 min.) in my top oven at 425F. 3 slices of leftover bacon laid out flat took about 20 min to get crispy lt. brown. Maybe itâ€™s my oven?

Excellent, but make this on the grill! It smoked so much the fire department literally came out to our house! I made Chef John's quick Hollandaise sauce recipe with it and it was to die for. You will love it!!!

This recipe was easy and the bacon was enough to have the kids try it!  It does need a little something to brush onto it just before it.  Watch the salt, because the bacon does add sodium.

Found this recipe to be bland.
Will flash fry the asparagus in a hot skillet for a couple of minutes next time, with a lemon infused oil. Then season with salt and lemon pepper, before wrapping the asparagus in partically cooked bacon (from the microwave)...then off to the oven. Thanks for a starter recipe with a wonderful idea. BACON!!!
