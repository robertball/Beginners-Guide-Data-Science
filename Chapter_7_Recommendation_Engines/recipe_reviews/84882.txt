This is a great recipe but it is bland if you don't add to it (i.e. onions, garlic pwdr...etc.).  You first should cook on high heat until it boils then reduce to med-high.  Cover it in the beginning and then uncover for the last bit of cooking time.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this tasted.  I just didn't feel like cooking and thought that if it didn't taste good, it was not a long list of expensive ingredients.  Scaled to 3 servings.  Added tsp. each garlic and onion powder.  Only had diet coke with lime but thought that would work well.  While it was cooking, it didn't smell all that great.  What a surprise when I lifted the lid and tasted the sauce and couldn't believe the depth of flavor!  I have quite a descriminating palate and couldn't believe how good this was for being a simpleton recipe!  Served with some basmati rice and fresh steamed broccoli and it was a great meal.  The chicken itself was nice and tender.  Used 3 deskinned bone-in breasts.

This is a recipe that is a favorite of ours.  I have made this several times and it is very good.  Chicken comes out moist and tastes a lot like barbeque chicken.  I used the boneless, skinless chicken breasts and use diet cola.  I usually shred the leftovers and make a sandwich for lunch.  Very tasty, you've got to try it.  And, it doesn't get any easier than this!!  Enjoy!

At first, I didn't really get this recipe.  I tried it though, and the sauce didn't thicken and become a gooey delicious mess, however, I think I was simmering it at too low a temperature.  I think higher simmer, to allow for a full boil.  However, I tried the leftovers the next day, and it was delicious!

wicked good!  
did add some stuff, though.  
i browned the chicken first and also added veggies:  onion, garlic, carrots, celery and red peppers (was trying to use them up).  SO GOOD!  was iffy on letting it boil for so long...but you def have to do it to get it to thicken up.
would be great to serve up to a house full of peeps :o)

This is a super easy, quick meal, esp when you don't feel like cooking!! I made a few moderations: I used 1 1/2 cans Diet Pepsi, and 1 1/2 c. ketchup. I also browned some chopped onion & garlic before adding the chicken/sauce. Also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to it. Great flavor! Chicken was super moist!

Delicious!  This will definitely become a regular in our family.  I love the fact that the ingredients are things that are generally in the pantry.  I used boneless chicken breast, took them out of the pot after 30 minutes and shredded them, returned them to the pot during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Came out perfectly, made a wonder pulled chicken sandwich. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe IS surprisingly tasty!!  My sister used to do Weight Watchers and this was a recipe that she brought home.  Just use Diet Coke instead of regular Coke.  I still use it to this day!!

The combination of cola + ketchup can be used with all sorts of meats not just chicken! I have to recommend to you all try using DR PEPPER when using beef!!!!! I haven't tried using Dr. P on chicken but I'm going to very soon and I'll let you guys know. One of the real advantages of using coke/Dr P/whatever is that the acidity in soda helps break down tough pieces of meat so you can save money by buying tougher cuts which are cheaper and generally sold in higher weight (more meat for your fam or more leftovers). Throwing this into a slow cooker in the morning takes seconds, turn it on low and thats that. Depending on how long your gone during the day might vary how thick your sauce is, if you find its too thin remove the cover and turn it up on high. I also recommend that if you use breasts with the skin on, you might find that broiling them in the oven until they are crispy is good, however I don't use the skin so I can't tell you how long to keep it in for, just watch em!

I used boneless chicken, added tons of onions and some garlic.  By mistake I used the Vanilla Black Cherry coke....it was so good!  I did think the sauce was a bit thin, so I did thicken it with some cornstarch.  Without a doubt I will make this again, I will make making the sauce for some cocktail meatballs also!!!!!!!

I was looking for a simple recipe with ingredients I already had in the house and this idea worked out great. However, I used 12 chicken thighs,(pan frying with salt/pepper first) drained fat, then added about 3 cups of ketchup and 3.5 cans of diet pepsi. Simmered for 1.5 hrs and it came out delish!!  Served over rice with a side of canned corn!

I have no idea what I did wrong here, but I wouldn't call my attempt at this recipe a success. After 45 min. of cooking on med-high heat, it had formed a 1/4 inch of what I can only compare to asphalt on the bottom of my pot. I had to pry what chicken I could from the bottom and trash the rest. I guess I had the heat too high?  It didn't actually taste terrible, very similar to bbq chicken. Not sure if I will try this recipe again, though I could very well have been the flaw in my efforts.

Simply amazing!! Very easy and always a success!  The first time I made this I used frozen chicken drumsticks.    I experienced my first try to be too sweet.  Instead of using diet cola I rather went with 1/2 can tomato puree and  1/2 cup tomato sauce and added 250ml of cream and 2 teaspoons garlic powder- The boyfriend loved the original recipe while mom preferred the second....Adding ground black pepper a must!

very yummy! I pulled the chicken and put it on onion rolls. Those having problems with it not getting goopy, you have to let it boil down, it'll get there boiling after 2 hours. I had to set it to high not medium to get it there in the 2 hours though. It was indeed sweet, I wouldn't have used a cherry coke, it's sweet enough with the regular coke. Thanks for this great recipe!

My kids thought it was neat because of the cola. I used skinless breast.

I was looking to use up some extra soda and ketchup I had leftover from a BBQ and came upon this recipe. My husband and I were surprised at how good it was without having to add anything extra!   One thing I did change was the amount of soda used.  Frankly, the pot I put everything in wasn't big enough and ended up using a little over a liter of soda instead and it tasted great!  I think any more soda than that would have been too watery and too soda-flavored. Great!

This is amazing! I loved this. We followed the recipe exactly. We ate it plain with some cooked broccoli. It was so simple to make and delicious at the same time. We used Dr. Pepper to make it--so good! I am definitely making this again.

Well if you're looking for a thick sauce, this isn't the recipe for you. The sauce is soupy and not thick AT ALL. I used Dr. Pepper instead of Coke and that's the only alteration I made. I probably wont make this one again.

I have found that this is the greatest recipe! My family loves it! I use Pepsi and a 20oz container of Heinz ketchup. I also add lots and lots of Greek seasoning (my secret ingredient). I have to make two to three large packs of chicken breasts in order to satisfy not only my family but neighbors who just seem to magically know when I make it. :D

YUMMY!! The whole family fell in love! It smelled so good while cooking and tasted even better. We added sliced onion and 2 diced garlic cloves along with black pepper right into the sauce mix and let it simmer the whole 2 hours, it was perfect. Will make often, super easy, so few ingredients. Thanks

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. No, seriously. 1,000 internets for you! I followed the advice of others and added onion and garlic. I personally cut up half a yellow onion and three garlic cloves. Sauted them first before I put in the chicken.

For the chicken I used about 10 thigh pieces instead. I personally prefer dark meat. I used about 4 cups of cola and the 2 cups of ketchup. Added a few squirts of hot sauce and a few turns of ground pepper.

Delicious. Absolutely delicious! Also had a little difficulty getting the sauce thick, cooked it for 20 minutes longer and added a small spoon full of flour.

I love it!

It's like bbq, with less flavor and more sweetness. I won't make it again.

Very good and simple; followed others advice and added Onion & Garlic, then when it came to a slow boil added Onion & Garlic Powder, and a small amount of Red Chili flake for spice. Very good and served with Mixed Veggies and Mac & Cheese.

bleck.... the only good thing I can say about this is that it was easy and my 10 year old could make it, but the taste was very bland.  Sorry.  :(

This was good but it was missing something-maybe I'll try the onions and garlic another rater added.  It also had an unappealing smell as others have said, so I'll use the other suggestion of cooking it in the crockpot outside.  The liquid did not reduce to a sauce when it should have, so I increased the temperature and cooked it for another 30 minutes to get the desired thickness.  A good (and EASY) starter recipe!

This was very good but I can't imagine adding 2 liters of cola.  I used 2 cups ketchup and 2 cans of diet cola.(3 cups)  I had to remove the chicken and let the sauce boil down for quite a while to thicken it.  I also added 2 TBS  of onion flakes, 1/2 TS garlic powder and 1 TS Worcestershire.  Next time I will try regular cola.

Tasted great! I had two huge split chicken breasts, so I halved the recipe. I used two Diet Coke cans and one Diet Coke with Lime to add some flavoring, along with one cup of ketchup. It would have tasted better if that phone call hadn't occured and it burned a bit after an hour and a half. :-)

This was good and very easy. I followed the recipe as stated but next time I think I'll doctor it a little. I think some brown sugar would add a little something to the sauce and more veggies would be good. My 4yr old enjoyed it so I will be making this again.

This was a great recipe, the chicken is flavorful and not to dry. I didn't use ketchup though, instead I used a beer and chipotle BBQ sauce with the pepsi it was so good!!!

made in the slow cooker. Sauce never thickened and chicken, although moist, was bland. I ended up putting bbq sauce all over it.

I made this recipe in Sri Lanka when I had limited ingredients at hand,  and it turned out great.  I  cut the recipe in thirds and ended up only cooking for about an hour (maybe the heat was too high?). In any case, it was great home cooking, will do again!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it took 3 hours to get "thick and sticky".  The chicken was tender in spots and leather tough in others. It was ok for dinner, but I won't make it again.

I did this by crockpot. I would not recommend cooking it this way. It turned out horrible. We dumped the whole thing. I followed the reciped listed but just put it in the crockpot for about 6 hours. I don't think I would try it the regular way either. It was just not good.

This recipe was OK.  The flavor was good, but not fantastic.  I never got the sauce to be thick and sticky like the recipe called for (I cooked for 3 hours trying to get it that way and it did not work), but the flavor came through just fine and the chicken was moist.  Others in my family raved about the recipe, though.  Give it a try.  You may like it.  (Oh, and I used regular Pepsi when I made it.)

Great recipe!  Halved everything (skinless/boneless breasts) and added a little garlic and onion powders like suggested.  Shredding part way through was big- kept it from drying out.  Did the cole slaw in the sandwich thing like in the pic.  Simple and terrific

I really wanted to love it. I resisted the temptation to season during the cooking process and did it exactly as the recipe explained. I should have seasoned during the cooking process...  Desperately needed salt & hot sauce upon serving.  Will probably try again with some modifications.

Love it! We make smaller portions of this using about 2 lbs of chicken, equal parts of diet coke and ketchup, onion, red pepper and a can of crushed pineapple. The pineapple makes it delicious! Take it for lunches poured over rice.

This is a family favorite! CURE FOR BLAND... right here . I used Dr Pepper to sweeten up the chicken. MUST DO - When you use breast meat you need to do something about it being a bit bland. I put the breast (boneless) in the crock pot coat with Ketchup coating chicken then pour the Dr Pepper in not washing the Ketchup away. cook on low about 6 hours, use 2 forks and SHRED (do not dice) the chicken. Once shredded use a gallon bag and put about 2 cups of the liquid in the bag along with the shredded chicken (liquid is still drink consistency). Let this sit for a good while to get the coating on the pieces. (15-30 minutes or so). Make sure you have fresh limes on hand to squeeze on meat. We love this as a street taco so corn torillas with the lime squeeze on chicen and your favorite toppings. I highly recommend avocado and some pico de gallo with corn and black beans in it. Sour Cream and cheese is great too.

I have a hard time understanding how this could be so flavorful with only three ingredients. I would have liked more heat, but my family loved it. I made it exactly to recipe though scaled down by half.
