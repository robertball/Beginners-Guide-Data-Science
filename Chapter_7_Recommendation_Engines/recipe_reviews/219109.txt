This the real thing!  Very simple, very very good, and absolutely authentic taste *IF* you use Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  Not Tabasco. Not nothin' else ... and you'll have the taste just like the originals from The Anchor Bar in Buffalo NY.  And, just like Chef John says, butter is what you use ... not margarine.  You should never buy store-bought wing sauce (waste of money, bad taste, and this stuff is soooo easy to make!).  
Suggestions:
- Omit the cayenne if you want your wings mild-to-medium-hot, 1/4 tsp as listed if you want it medium-hot, and, well, you get the idea.   
- Skip the extra salt (absolutely not necessary as all bottled hot sauce is incredibly salty anyway)
- Keep the sauce warm on the stove, and toss your hot-out-of-the-oven wings in a good amount of warmed hot-sauce, serve immediately
- Do not put these back in the oven to "dry" the sauce ... they're supposed to be saucy.  
- Keep some extra warmed hot sauce on the table for dipping (for those of us that need more hot-sauce punishment!)
- Lastly, serve with a real home-made blue cheese dressing, as there are several good ones on this site (choose one with less mayo-to-sour cream ratio) ... and don't forget the celery & carrot sticks to garnish for a crunch & cooling effect!  
Thanks for a great recipe, Chef John.

This is it!! I am from Buffalo and have lived away for many years.  Every year when I visit I just can't get enough "wings", but now I can make them myself! Authentic recipe (sorry to those who don't like it, but this IS what wings taste like in Buffalo)... I deep fried the wings in peanut oil (355 degrees) in batches, then tossed all of the wings in the sauce - give em a good shake - with the lid on of course.  Serve with blue cheese dressing, carrot and celery sticks.  Tastes like home :)   Thanks to Chef John!

This recipe is simple and very good. We cooked it and dipped drumsticks in the sauce. Then we baked the drumsticks and used the rest of the sauce for dipping. Next time we plan to marinade it to get more flavor.

I make this sauce then marinate my chicken in the buffalo chicken wing sauce usually choosing chicken breasts. after its been sitting for a few hours I cook the chicken in the sauce over medium head(essentially poaching the chicken in wing sauce) then I shred the chicken with a fork and put it over salad, it is the best thing I've EVER eaten! its a must try!

Made this creamy and smooth by using the advice of another by melting the butter first and throwing in a little flour to make a roux. Perfect! I followed the rest of recipe exactly and it was so creamy and good! Then I did add a little more pepper and garlic after I made the original recipe just because we like more heat. Loved the flour roux idea and will always make my sauce creamy like this forever and because of the roux the butter doesn't separate out as easily.

Heck yeah. I used plain old store-brand hot sauce, and somehow I ran out of vinegar, so had to leave it out, but it was still awesome. I spread a pizza crust with ranch dressing, then topped with shredded chicken tossed in the sauce.. topped with red onion, bleu cheese crumbles, and mozzarella. HEAVEN. One thing that wasn't included in the directions, which I found relevant: As soon as I removed the sauce from the heat and the boil died down, the sauce began to separate. So when I was ready to use it, I returned it to the heat, brought back to a boil, pulled it, and quickly tossed the chicken before it had a chance to separate again.

I really disliked this sauce--I couldn't eat it at all!  I tried it with Frank's Hot Sauce and with Crystal Hot Sauce.  The butter aroma and flavor was overwhelming in both batches.

Thank you Chef John,I followed this exactly as written. First I baked the wings by lightly coating them in flour, set in fridge for an hour (to dry them from washing) and then cooked in oven at 400 degrees for an hour. Then you coat this sauce onto wings by shaking them and the sauce in a popcorn bowl with a plate on top.  I am from Buffalo and I eat at the anchor bar. If this isn't the recipe, you are fooling me. These are perfect and so delicious...especially if you eat them hot.

I really liked the flavor of this sauce.  It's very close to what we get in local pubs, but it was way too runny.  The first time I made only 1 small change to the recipe - I added a tsp of molasses to the sauce - but from now on I will be making a rue of the butter and 1-2 tbsp flour, then adding the remaining ingredients.  This should help with the consistency and keep the butter from separating from the sauce.

I tried this recipe 3 times and all 3 times the butter separated from the other ingredient's. It literally looked like oil was floating on top. I followed the recipe exactly as stated except My butter was salted. Not sure if that would make that much of a difference but that's all I can think of.

I pre-made this today before a special event, and I'm so glad I did.  I read and re-read the recipe several times.  It calls for 1/2 cup of unsalted butter.  That is one whole stick.  That seemed like a LOT of butter, but I did it because it is what the recipe said and the reviews were great.  UGGG.  The sauce was wayyyyy too buttery tasting. I wasn't even able to eat one wing.  When I make it for my guests I will be using a 1/2 STICK of butter (or less) and NOT a 1/2 cup!!

I was born and raised in Buffalo and traditionally, Buffalonians will only mix butter and Franks to create a sauce (strictly Franks depending on heat desired). That being said, this stuff is pretty spot on to Buffalo Wild Wings sauce. I just completed their "Blazin Wild Wing Challenge" and it was rough lol! All in all, great sauce, sure to be loved by all looking for a hot wing. As to compliment, Rooties Blue Cheese dressing should be used, but Ken's chunky will work in a pinch.
It's been 2 weeks since this review and I owe the author an apology. I was just on the Anchor Bar website (original Buffalo Wings), and their famous sauce has these ingredients. I have contineud to make this sauce and my husband wants to put it on everything. This is truly spot on and delicious!

yes, it is delicious but, I think it would still be good with only 1/4 cup of butter. I agree it needs to be in there though

This is the real deal. If you don't like this recipe, don't bother ordering Buffalo wings in Buffalo because they're exactly the same. The only thing I did differently was to cook the wings in my TFal Actifry without adding any oil. The chicken fries in its own oils and they're just a little bit healthier that way.

I tried this recipe and the clue to getting the sauce right to me is never bring it to a boil, this seems to cause the butter to separate, I carefully watch it an just bring it to a pre-simmer state and it stays , nice and thick, if it boils it separates for good. I tried to thicken it with corn starch, when it separated on my first try, no such luck , don't bring it to a boil or all will be lost.

Franks is "Original" Buffalo wing sauce on its own, and already has these ingredients in it (except for the butter). If you want real buffalo wings sauce, just use Franks on it's own. This will give you what most restaurants would call "hot", if you want medium then add the butter. If you want garlic wings, add garlic....I think you get the idea

There's really no need to add salt, vinegar, cayenne, etc to Franks. It's perfect the way it is.

I have made chicken wings numerous times using this sauce. My husband and son love the zip of the cayenne pepper with just a touch of vinegar as suggested in the recipe. Place the wings in the bowl with the sauce, cover with a plate and shake. This was a suggestion from Chef John which results in just the right amount of sauce on the wings.

I made this last night. Tossed about 2 lbs of wings in a few table spoons of flour, a few shakes of ground hot red pepper & garlic powder, and baked for 35 minutes at 425F. Then I tossed in this sauce (only used 1/2 for the 2 lbs). I added a tablespoon of flour to the sauce as some users recommended. It was so good. Served with celery & Ken's Steakhouse Chunky blue cheese dressing. Heavenly.

Best wing sauce ever!!!!! I love this sauce. I have made wings for 15 years, I got sick of the sauce I was using. I found Chef John sauce and made it omg. Now I make it everytime. I do not add salt I find it to have enough salt taste in it. And yes I use unsalted butter. Thank you so much Chef for this sauce I love wings and this sauce is the best.

Great recipe! I did leave out the salt and the cayenne pepper,because there were people in my household who are not fans of heat.I would probably try the recipe with cayenne pepper another day.

This sauce was delish and flavorful! I omitted the Cayenne because I am a sissy, and I also added a little corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce up a bit, but my wings were a success.

Being from Georgia, I have never had a wing from Buffalo, but this sauce is the best.  I used a whisk and had no problem with it separating.  We loved it.  I baked the wings because I am lazy, but will fry them next time.  We loved it just the way it is made by Chef John.

This is really close if not exactly the taste I am familiar with when I think buffalo sauce.

The best wing sauce out there, although I made them too salty by using salted butter AND adding salt.  So do yourself a favor and follow the recipe to a T.  You won't be sorry.

This stuff is the BOMB!!! 
The first time we made it with Tabasco sauce, the sandwich had a wonderful full flavor and a nice heat that smacked ya up side the head and said "I"m here, enjoy me."

The second time we made it with Franks hot sauce. It had a MUCH milder heat but a truly amazing flavor. My son-in-law who grew up just outside of Buffalo got a little smile on his face when I slipped him a taste straight from the pot and quickly gave it a nod of approval. Though in discussions with him and my son we all agreed it needed more heat.

So my advice to you is if you want a GOOD heat go with the Tabasco, if you're looking for a milder sauce go with franks, BOTH will give you a great flavor profile.

Once again, Chef John has the "magic" recipe. I love how Chef John doesn't attempt to make himself look like a 5-star Chef-Extrodinaire (which he probably is) by adding off-the-wall ingredients. The best recipes are usually simple and not overly complicated. Chef John RULES!

This recipe is the best I have ever found online,anywhere for anything!It is really that good!Ever since I was a kid,I have LOVED buffalo wings and there was a local restaurant that made awesome ones that I always got.Now that I am all grown up,I have been searching for the perfect wing recipe.I must say that I use another baked buffalo wing recipe that is on this site as my first step in baking the wings but I use Chef John's sauce recipe instead at the end and oh my goodness,pure heaven.My hubby and I love these with chunky blue cheese dressing.

Everyone loved these wings, the only modification I made was to decrease the amount of butter to 1/2 a stick instead of a whole stick.

This was simple and delicious! I've made it twice in two weeks .. The person that gave it one star hands down did it wrong . Give it a try ,just make sure the vinegar has evaporated while cooking . You will be able to tell when the sauce is done just by the way it looks ! :)

Spending 10 yrs in NY I've helped eaten (and cooked) a LOT of chicken wings at a friends establishment that's famous for it's Buffalo wings. This recipe is great, but I'll agree with others in eliminating the salt.  And only use Franks Red Hot, no substitutes.  (Also another little secret, liquid Phase Butter Alternative instead of butter if you can find it.). It eliminates the separation problem, makes for a better consistency, and does not need to be cooked as dropping piping hot wings in the sauce is all you need.) Even using butter though, it's spot on.  Yum!

Great recipe. I made it not having smaller measurements and winging those and it turned out great. For me the recipe worked for a whole rotisserie chicken form the local food distributor.
The result was refrigerate-able and reheat-able via microwave. I also let the chicken marinate for a brief time before adding it a salad, bread, or on its own with some blue cheese dressing.
Anyway, highly recommended for those with a buffalo chicken craving who do not want a bottled version.

Really good!  I needed a quick buffalo sauce for my chicken buffalo burgers (as I was too cheap to buy it,) so I looked it up on Allrecipes and made this on the fly.  I didn't read any of the reviews as I normally would and made it exactly as written.  It was a little thin and the color came out a weird pale orange so I wasn't sure... but it turned out great (and no separation issues)!  I think the Worcestershire sauce really makes it.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thank you!

My boyfriend makes this recipe all the time, it's his most established dish (he's quite the cook). He uses flour and frequently coats the chicken in more flour/sauce mix throughout the roasting period. They're amazing.

When I was working in my first University teaching job after grad school, buffalo wings were just becoming popular.  There was a bar in the Village that had the BEST wing sauce.  Ever since, I have searched for a comparable taste and have never found it - until now.  This flavor of this sauce is remarkably close though not quite as hot as I would like.  Next time I'll add another 1/4 tsp of cayenne to achieve the heat I like.  Great!

Fantastic! Not too hot. Some have complained that their sauce separated. I was very careful not to get the butter too hot when I heated it. It kept the emulsion and it didn't have any separation but the sauce is thinner than a commercial premade.  I used half of the sauce on the wings prior to putting under the boiler. The other half I kept back and I actually added some cornstarch to thicken it. I then recoated the wings. Next time, I would just use the corn starch in the beginning and save the trouble of saucing again.

This was great. I did some research to see how to now make the sauce NOT separate. Heat on low temp, add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, mix consistently (I used an immersion blender). My sauce did not separate after cooling. Placed it in a jar and still good a week later.

Too much butter!!  If you reduce the butter and use Franks it will be great!

Excellent! I started with Franks Buffalo Hot Sauce. Omitted the cayenne pepper and cut the butter back to 1/4 cup as others suggested.  Will definitely make again.

DELICIOUS! Made as instructed with the addition of a tbls of flour to keep it from separating. Put this on roasted cauliflower in a rice bowl and it was RIDICULOUSLY good!

This simple recipe is on the money. I tried it with Frank's and Valentina (Mexican picante sauce). Both were very good. You won't need to add Worcestershire sauce to the Valentina, by the way. Also, mixing these two 50/50 was superb! Another trick I stumbled into was pre-making the sauce, letting it cool, then keep it in the frig for one or more days. I then used the sauce without reheating. The heat of the wing was enough. The consistency and flavor was even better than the first go-round.

This is the Real Thing..I had a friend who worked at the Anchor Bar as a cook in the 70's and this is it.  I don't care who invented it, my belief is Teressa, but this is what is known through out the world as Buffalo Wing Sauce.  Using anything but Frank's sauce is a  transgression against God.  Or something similar in bad vibes.

This had got to be the BEST wing sauce recipe I have come across! It's PERFECT! So easy to make! So quick too! No sauce will ever compare now. This is just way too good! Thanks for print this up! I have been searching for a wing sauce like back home but could never find one that even compared. This one is AMAZING! If you love Hot Wings, you got to try this sauce for sure! *Note: If you want a more mills sauce do it WITHOUT the Cayenne Pepper!

This was easy, and I feel that the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce gave it an addicting zing. I used Valentina Mexican extra hot sauce, and it turned out great. The butter helps bring down the heat so it's tolerable!

Scaled this down to 2 and tossed it with some fried wings from the wing bar at Wegmans (local grocery store). We've been looking to find the best wings around our new home and had yet to find a good one that wasn't insanely expensive - the hubby declared this 'his new wing'! The sauce took about 3 minutes to put together and boil while I crisped up the wings in a hot toaster oven for a few minutes. Toss and consume, it's as easy as that.

Great sauce all by itself or one can add personal ingredients. I tried some minced onion in the butter first and then added some oregano and thyme in one batch and then in another batch added my own ground habanero for killer hot sauce.

I went to college near Buffalo, NY and this is very authentic.  I omitted the cayenne pepper because I think Frank's Red Hot is spicy enough, but the taste was true to Buffalo.  Be sure to serve with real blue cheese dressing.

I grow my own organic hot peppers and I make many different hot sauces. For years I've been looking for a proper Buffalo Wing style sauce recipe. 
This is it. 
There's something about the ratio of all the ingredients that make this the perfect wing sauce. 
I tried this as well using my habanero sauce as a base for that extra kick. 
Thank you for posting this.

Read reviews, the reason theirs didn't turn out is the recipe lists unsalted butter. It will make it separate if using salted butter or margarine. This is a great recipe.

Pretty good, a little on the thin side and not enough heat for our liking.  Would cut the butter back by half and up the cayenne pepper next time.  Did like the extra bite of the vinegar and will try again with these changes.

i really love this sauce.  i par-boiled the wings for about 15 min, let them air dry thoroughly, and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes.  then dumped them in a bowl of this exquisite sauce and we went to town on them :)   we used the franks xtra hot sauce, and added a few dashes of cayenne, because we like things very spicy!  served , of course, with homemade blu cheese dressing, carrots, and celery sticks.  a feast fit for a king, thanks chef john!!

Surprisingly, just okay.  I tried this & Frank's cajun buffalo the same night.  They're about even with hotness, which is very mild.  (Frank's: 1/2c Frank's, 1/3c UNSALTED butter & ketchup, 2t cajun seasoning.)  This sauce is quite thin.  The other is thicker, but not really better.  Mild enough for kids.  I didn't add the vinegar, but it was still a little vinegary compared to Frank's.  I used Frank's hot sauce in both recipes, btw. The first ingredient in my cajun seasoning bottle is salt sooo if you use salted butter, it will be too salty.  I can testify to it. :(  :o  :D

This sauce is exactly the same as the Wing King sauce I remember getting as a kid In Niagra Falls.  I'm so glad I stumbled on to this recipe.

Somehow I have gotten by on equal parts butter and Frank's with a bit of garlic thrown in for years. But i'm not sure how!!!  This sauce is amazing!!  It is so much more flavorful than any I have ever had in or out of a restaurant.  My only change was to add about a tsp of honey to balance it just a bit. This is perfect and i cant wait to share it with every wing lover I know!

My 15 yr. old daughter loves buffalo wings and has tried many different variations at numerous restaurants.  She has become very picky about the sauce.  I added extra cayenne because I know she likes it spicy. She indicated that she would like it even spicier.  Yet, when she was done she ladled a couple more spoonfuls onto her plate and dip her finger into the sauce.  I think soaking the chicken in the sauce might help to add more flavor.  Easy recipe and I would try again.

This sauce was the BUSINESS!!!!  Instead of wings (which I will use this recipe later for) I used it on Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast. Needless to say this turned out to be a great dinner!!

Great buffalo wing sauce, delicious and authentic.  Had to use margarine instead of butter, and it still came out delicious.  Used with the Baked Buffalo Wing recipe--dip the wings in the sauce and bake at 400.  Yum!!!

It’s pretty darn good. But it’s not accurate. To be accurate you need to use a Louisiana type hot sauce and not Frank’s. But it’s still good nonetheless

Having lived in Upstate NY, this recipe is amazing. My only thought was that there was too much vinegar. I would cut the vinegar in half next time. Also, it is imperative that you DO NOT bring this to a boil. Heat over low heat until right before it  boils. If you allow it to boil, the butter will separate.

As someone who is from Buffalo, I did not approve of this recipe. I thought it was too buttery and it didn't stick to the wings.

This sauce is perfect ... well, WAS perfect until my husband had to insert himself like always into my process for anything in the kitchen. Of course since he knows everything about everything related to cooking,  he insisted that we "cook it down" on the stove to thicken and it instead separated into some weirdness.  Moral of the story: follow the directions and don't overheat!

A big step up from just dousing your wings in original Frank's.  As noted it does separate a bit if you leave it sit.  I found it important to whisk vigorously before pouring on to the wings for shaking.  As they cool and dry on the wings it won't separate the same way it will as it sits in the pan.  

I made one modification by adding honey to taste.  I think this helped stick to the wings and also added just a hint of tangy sweet that balances the sharp acid of the vinegar and pairs well with the Worcestershire.

Used this recipe to sauce wings I brought to a party last week, and got a lot of compliments on it. This coated the wings very nicely, and had the flavor of wings at a good sports bar. Very impressed, and will use this again.

Yep, just about the real thing. It could be just a little thicker to cling better to the wings. And seriously, it tastes best on fried wings. If you're looking for authentic, go all the way.

Delicious delicious deliciousness... I have never made homemade wings before this was a great recipe thank you for sharing me and my family love love love it... I made the recipe exactly how it said, except my local store didn’t have red hot so I used Cholula instead, for the wings I bought drumstick style wings boiled in water with garlic powder and salt until fully cooked, then I marinated them for about 2 hours in the buffalo sauce.. I then removed them from the container shaking off any excess sauce  then cooked them in the oven until crispy turning over every 10-15 minutes.. when finished I tossed them again in the left over sauce delicious

This is the best recipe ever! I added like 1/2 a Tbsp less of butter and no cayenne and it was very good.

Perfect traditional buffalo wing sauce. I didn’t deviate from the original recipe, but I do recommend using Irish butter and strictly using Frank’s hot sauce. My family loved it.

Taste was very good.  It’s a bit too hot for me and I left out the cayenne pepper.  I’d like it a little milder so next time I’ll add more butter or less Franks Hot Sauce.  Of course I ate it anyway!  I moved from NY (where wings are amazing) to TN where wings are a disaster!  They are baked instead of fried.  FYI I did my wings in an air fryer!  Put in frozen and cooked about 40-45 minutes (turn them after 20) at 370 degrees.  Cook longer if you want them even more crispy!  Just as good as deep frying!

My all time go-to for buffalo wings.  It's just perfect as written...though I would suggest if you don't like it too hot you might leave out the cayenne pepper to start with.  I prepare the wings either using the baked method that reviewer Mike Danben suggested or the fried method that reviewer Raffaelo suggested.  Both ways, paired with this sauce, is soooo tasty!  Thanks, Chef John, for another keeper!

Just right!  How can you not love this?  It tastes like my favorite restaurant sauce - maybe better!  I left out the cayenne because I think it's hot enough with the hot pepper sauce.  I did add a little xanthan gum to the butter as it melted so that it would thicken and keep from separating.  It's also a way to thicken a keto recipe which this qualifies as!  Thanks Chef John for another winning recipe!

I've used this recipe twice, great flavor; however the second time I made the sauce I forgot that everyone said to cut the butter in half. Using the full butter the sauce does not stick and is just a greasy mess. I won't forget again.

Absolutely the best buffalo sauce!!! Fantastic mix of flavor and heat, THE PERFECT BALANCE! This is very easy to make considering how great it taste! I have made both chicken wings and chicken breast cut in half for sandwiches with this recipe. It has always been a favorite when making this for guest. Everyone inquires of the how to reproduce the sauce and chicken.

Super yummy!  We did sriracha for our hot sauce and then we didn’t have cayenne the first time we made it and just substituted chili powder. The kids preferred it that way anyway since it was hot, but not too hot for them to eat.  But even with cayenne, it’s delicious.  I’m sure it’s good with any hot sauce you choose.

Made it exactly as John directed. It tasted exactly like what Buffalo sauce should taste like! I use it on thighs, because they are cheaper than wings (Go figure). My family loves it!

My wife went to my niece’s graduation and I was on my own to cook for me and my kiddos.  I really wanted hot wings but money was tight so I took a risk and made this.  I used Schwans 505 chicken strips and deep fried them to toss in the sauce and I had no Cayene so I substituted Tony Chacheres.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was a hit!  I literally made the sauce as the chicken strips fried.  It was that quick and easy.

I add a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also use an air fryer and then I can put the wings with sauce back in for a few minutes for crispy delicious wings. Thanks for the reminder of this great recipe.

Will make it again but would like instructions on when to add it to the chicken. I.E  add it to raw chicken then bake or after the chicken has been cooked.  Really loved the sauce!!!

Close to inedible. I like hot and spicy but I ended up rubbing most of the sauce off.  Sorry, but for me it was a waste of time and good hot sauce. On to another recipe.

YUMMY!  Excellent flavor.  I'll  experiment next time to see if I can get the sauce to thicken up a bit. I'm one who doesn't eat really spicy and this was perfect! Just the right amount of heat for me.

I've made this recipe several times now and everyone loves it.  I let the wings marinate in the buffalo sauce either overnight or at least for several hours and then I bake them covered in the sauce.  I like my wings saucy so I doubled the recipe and it was just about enough.  These are NOT spicy at all. Adjust cayenne pepper or add Tabasco sauce if you want to add some heat.

Great wing sauce.  I followed suggestions and added 1TB flour and halved the amount of butter used.  I did not add any additional cayenne.   The sauce was creamy and we used on the side as a 'dipping sauce' with wings.  excellent!

Great! Not just hot for the sake of being hot - this had super flavor. The heat kicks in at the end. For those who like it really spicy, you can always add more cayenne.

I am not the greatest cook...okay very far from and still learning how to boil an egg right. Take what I say with a grain of salt. I did try this and the flavor was amazing though for whatever reason it was chunky. I have a feeling I put the butter on too high of heat. I couldn't get any of it to blend right but that wasn't the recipes fault. The flavor was great and this is going to be my go-to Buffalo wing Sauce! Going to keep practicing on it till it's perfect!

This is a terrific sauce. You can mess around with the heat via the cayenne, but I like it as it is. The vinegar and butter really bring balance to it.

I used this sauce on chicken wings cooked in my new air fryer. My husband said they are the best wings he's ever eaten and I agreed. We like a very hot sauce, so I added cayenne gradually, tasting as I went until it was just right. The only advice I would add is to skip adding any additional sale. The Franks is more than salty enough.

Used Frank's hot sauce and followed the recipe.  Use no-salt butter to avoid a too-salty result.  We basted the sauce onto roasted cauliflower, popped it back into the oven for a few minutes, and then sprinkled with the blue cheese.  Fantastic!  Had leftover sauce, so the next day we made popcorn, warmed the sauce, and tossed the popcorn and sauce in a bowl until lightly coated.  what a treat!  Be careful not to use too much sauce or you'll get soggy popcorn.

Made this exactly as written. Folks....no need to make a roux or add molasses to keep the butter from separating. Emulsify it after its slightly cooled using a blender, stick blender, Ninja...what ever you have in the kitchen. Emulsify for 2-3 minutes. It makes a perfectly smooth sauce that will not separate.

I did this recipe on some large drumsticks unbreaded. I thought it was fantastic. Buffalo wing are one of my favourites. But. I found this sauce to be not as creamy as I thought it was gonna be after leaving it off the heat.after eating the sauce separated.but... when I wanted a quick drum sticks about six hours later, the sauce had started to solidify and become "mushy". The butter came back to its roots and I tumbled a drum sticks on it and it was the best buffalo sauce I've ever had. I will be making this sauce in the morning before I'm having wings next time

Very good buffalo sauce.  It tastes very similar to the normal mixture of butter and hot sauce buffalo sauce, but with just a little different hint to it.  Mild heat level.  Thank you for the recipe!

I grilled wings, then dipped and grilled for 3 minutes per side and then dipped again.

Added to chicken breasts that were pan seared.  

Sauce is better on the grill.

Used this sauce on the baked wing recipe. It was everything I hoped it would be. Very easy to make. It was more than what I needed so I’ll probably half it next time.

I have no idea how this compares to what Buffalonians like but this sauce was basically spicy butter. I was unwilling to leave it there so I gave it two good squeezes of ketchup and whisked it in...  Hmmmmm.  Interesting - going to whip up some wings tomorrow and put it to the test.

Quick & easy! Put leftover rotisserie chicken that I had shredded into the sauce and made buffalo chicken wraps. Tortilla, shredded lettuce, diced tomato, crumbly blue cheese and/or blue cheese dressing and topped it with cheddar cheese!

Yes, as so many reviewers have pointed out, to make the traditional, classic, authentic, real-deal Buffalo chicken wings, the one and only hot sauce to use is Frank's RedHot. Any substitution yields only a counterfeit, an imitation, a fraud. That said, however, I want to point out that for those of us who are salt-sensitive, the original flavor TABASCO sauce has less than one-fifth the amount of sodium that Frank's has, and therefore provides a way to enjoy an admittedly different, but nevertheless tasty, chicken wing experience. Sometimes ya gotta do what ya gotta do!

I made this sauce for my buffalo chicken meatball recipe. I used chipotle hot sauce which I really liked as it brought a nicer flavour to the sauce.

Wow!  This was perfect and surprisingly not overly spicy!  I didn’t have unsalted butter so I used salted and it was fine.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was perfect!  I had made some plain grilled chicken and white rice and the meal looked very bland - this was a last-minute audible that really does prep and cook in 5 mins and saved the day!  Amazing, thank you!!!

This sauce is delicious!  I omitted the butter (yes that's altering the original recipe, but I dot love the butter added, so...) and added fresh minced garlic.  The vinegar and Worcestershire sauce are spot on!  Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I made it and it was pretty great. I did, however, make a couple of changes based on what I had on hand. I made a double batch. Instead of Worcestershire, I swapped it out for a bit more hot sauce and a teaspoon of sugar (I considered honey, but decided to leave well enough alone). Then I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I put onion powder and garlic powder in. Overall, it was very great and I wonder how it would be if I didn't make the substitutions.

I would say this is by far the best buffalo sauce recipe. It's got that extra kick and extra vinegary taste I love.  It makes Frank's Buffalo sauce even better.

This by far the BEST wing sauce I’ve ever had! Easy to make too! Served it for the first Time for Super Bowl 2018, I could not get the wings out fast enough for all of our friends that were over for the game. It was definitely the hit of the party.  This is definitely my new “go to” wing sauce recipe from now on. By the way used an air fryer for the wings themselves, was not impressed with my air fryer before but with the oil in the skin of the chicken wings made them super crisp and the sauce just made them amazing.

Super easy and excellent. I also add in a hefty spoonful of minced garlic and about a spoonful of flower to thicken it up, then dip and bake on to wings for a few minutes and they turn out great.

I’m in no way a buffalo sauce expert, so maybe it’s me, but I found the white vinegar gave it too much of a tangy flavor. Maybe less than the 1 1/2 tablespoons?!?

This recipe is perfect....the only thing I changed was instead of 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper I used Ancho Chile pepper due to my husband's heartburn and I added 1 teaspoon honey....it is delicious.....thank you for a recipe that's so easy.

Great tasting sauce!  I followed the suggestion of making a roux with the butter first, and the sauce did not separate.

I had 8 pounds of chicken wings, so I adjusted the recipe to make more sauce.  I doubled all ingredients except the Frank's hot sauce (used original), which I tripled because my kids all like Frank's.
Everyone agreed that they liked the wings, and a unanimous vote on food is rare around here.
I will definitely make this one again!

I MADE IT JUST AS IT WAS WRITTEN. IT CAME OUT PERFECT! I HAD ENOUGH SAUCE LEFT OVER TO PLACE A BOWL OF IT ON A PLATTER WITH ALL THE OTHER FLAVORED WINGS I MADE ALONG WITH THE BUFFALO CHICKEN SAUCE. 
CHEF JOHN YOU DIDN'T FAIL ME YET! I KNEW WHO TO TURN TO WHEN I NEEDED A RECIPE TO TURN OUT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME! OUR SUPER BOWL PARTY WAS A SUCCESS! I JUST WISHED I WASN'T SO BUSY TO TAKE PICS!!! I WILL MAKE THESE AGAIN THOUGH! THEY WERE INCREDIBLY EASY, OH I THINK I DID LEAVE THE SALT OUT.  AND THEY WERE JUST FINE! AND I ONLY DID THAT BECAUSE I BRINED MY WINGS BEFORE BAKING THEM.  SOME I USED BUTTERMILK AND SOME A SOY SAUCE, BROWN SUGAR, GARLIC, GREEN ONION, WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE, CANE SUGAR AND WATER. OTHERS JUST A SIMPLE SALT AND SUGAR BRINE.  ALL TASTED GREAT WITH HOW THEY WERE FINISHED OFF,   ( I MADE TERIYAKI WINGS,  GARLIC BUTTER WINGS, NAKED WINGS, AND THESE BUFFALO HOT WINGS!) I CAN SAY THE BUFFALO WERE MY FAFORITE!

I love this sauce.  First I grill my wings, then put sauce on them and throw them back on the grill for a couple minutes.  Always delicious.

Simple and oh sooooooo good !  Thanks.  Want to thank my deep fryer as well.  Without you none of this would be possible.  lol

This turned out amazing just like a good pizza shop. I’ve made it a few times and love it. After a few times I started to use about half the butter and like it with less butter.

I haven't found a recipe by Chef John that I don't like. This is a tangy, spicy, perfect sauce. We tossed our convection oven fried crispy chicken wings in them. Couldn't get enough.

This is my go to anytime I make wings. I usually trade out half the butter for olive oil. And I've made it with Coconut oil in the past too. 
It's Delicious.

OK so I have a bottle of Frank's RedHot in front of me right now. The ingredient list reads as follows: Aged Cayenne Red Peppers, Distilled Vinegar, Water, Salt and Garlic Powder.
Chef John I have made dozens of your recipes and loved most of them. This, however, makes me question your credibility. Why would you add the exact same ingredients into something that is made with those items?
Having said this, the wings are great (even minus the extras already in the Frank's).

Tasted great!  We put a bit too much vinegar in on accident, but added 2 T. of honey.  We used Louisiana Red Hot sauce.

I made this sauce when I was making a buffalo chicken Stromboli. This sauce was very good. I roasted a chicken cut it up and put it in the sauce then made my Stromboli. Everyone loved it. I definitely would make this again.

WOW!!  I made this EXACTLY as written [always do the 1st time] and it is amazing!  It seemed like too much butter but this turned out fantastic!  I was looking for something to doctor up some leftover chicken pieces that we thought were a little dry.  This was perfect!  Now we're planning to make this regularly and recommend it to anyone who enjoys buffalo chicken.  NOTE:  Make sure to use real [good] butter, original Frank's RedHot Sauce, good quality garlic powder, cayenne, Worcestershire sauce, and white vinegar... really isn't necessary to add any salt.  Delicious!!

Made exactly to recipe and it was a huge hit. Was so simple I thought I was missing something but everyone loved it. Only suggestion made to me was that it was a little thin. Will either make an roux or slurry next time to thicken it up a little but have added this to my wing repertoire

The best hot wing sauce recipe ever! Don't try anything else! This is the original buffalo wing sauce and it's 100% the best! Be sure to use Frank's Red Hot sauce! Not Frank's hot wing sauce.  You are making this from scratch! Yumm!

This wing sauce is excellent.  It is important to follow the heating directions to ensure the Franks & butter don't separate.  Wisk early and often and the end result is a magnificent mix of a slightly spicy and rich wing sauce even my kids loved.

I did the sauce exactly as the recipe called for.  What I didn't do is fry the wings.  We smoked the wings.  While the wings were in the smoker we coated both sides very lightly with the sauce, and let them finish smoking.  WOW what a cool added flavor .  I like the sauce no matter what, but I HIGHLY recommend smoking the wings instead of simple frying.  This recipe is going to be used over and over!

Turned out great!  I applied them to oven-fried wings. I did not add the salt because I had already seasoned my wings with seasonings that included salt. I also used Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

Where's the sweet factor? By definition and preparation, buff wings should have the sweet and savory factor. This sauce is fair but nothing special you'd want when sating your guests.

Cayenne should be used acording to how you like your heat.  The vinegar is overwhelming so I would suggest 1/2 of what it asks.  Also requires more franks hot sauce.

Great recipe!!! Huge success at Fight Night! The one thing I changed was I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, only because I didn't have any.  Overall, very very tasty. The sauce complimented my crispy wing recipe.

Delicious recipe but it is not from scratch. If an ingredient in the list isn't basic, it's not scratch. This recipe has us adding hot sauce. You can't get hot sauce from nature.

Way way way too much butter. Cut the butter to about 1 tablespoon to start, taste and add more if it's too hot. I'm not afraid of salt, but DO NOT ADD SALT. Franks is very salty and cooking it will reduce it making it saltier, there is also salt in the Worcestershire, and more if your butter is salted, the sauce doesn't require any more salt. Trust me on the salt part.  No offense to Chef John, I like many of his other recipes.

AWESOME!  This was the consensus around my table tonight.  It gets a double save from us.  I coated my oven baked wings with half the sauce, then placed them back in the oven for a few minutes more.  Then coated the wings again with the sauce I reserved and viola .....served.  Thanks Chef John

So if you read the ingredients of franks sauce it's just a lot more of the same other ingredients here just with some paprika and xantham gum so if you're so inclined you could just mess with adding a bit more of everything and some paprika.

great recipe!! I like a little more heat to my sauce so I added a local seasoning in Kansas called Dwyer Seasoning. If you are looking for something to melt your mouth maybe add a little more cayenne pepper. other then that it has really good flavor.

Delicious. Tossed some baking-powder crispy chicken wings in it, at least as good as restaurant wings, if not better.

This was my first attempt at wings and oh my gosh, it's perfect.  I chose the baking method and they crisped up nicely.  Then I put a little of the sauce over them and put them back in the turned off oven for about 5 minutes, then took them out and saturated them with the sauce.  Delicious!! I didn't add the cayenne pepper because I'm more of a mild girl.  This was so easy (and delicious), I definitely won't be buying wings out anymore.

If this is for medium wings, probably a 5.  The flavor is there, just a bit too much butter for my taste.  I m going to try knocking the butter in half next time and that should help give it some more kick as well.

Followed the recipe exactly, no changes, and everyone loved it, as is.  This is not a real hot sauce, so if you prefer more heat I suggest adding extra cayenne pepper or a splash of some hot, hot sauce.  So easy to prepare; it's  a keeper and I'll definitely make it again.

You can leave the cayenne pepper out if you want a mild sauce.  With the cayenne pepper gives it the perfect amount of heat.

Easy and delicious. The only negative is the sauce is loose so while you have a coat on the chicken,  it's not as thick as we would've limes, however, the rest I've is a very, very good one.

Exactly what I was looking for!  I didn't have Red's Hot Sauce and used Sriracha Sauce instead ... Perfect!  So if you don't like the sauce with Red's, try Sriracha.  I precooked the wings in my crockpot for a few hours, then crisped them in the oven at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes, brushed the sauce on them and popped them back in the oven for another 15 minute. Place remaining sauce on table for dipping ... YUM!

I use the recipe from the anchor bar as a base and I add couple things. I simmer 2 minced garlic cloves in the butter. 3 squirts of ketchup to thicken it alittle and a tbsp of siracha to add flavor and bring the heat back up the ketchup knocks down.

This was a good recipe. It was spicy, but not so overwhelming that made me need to drink milk with it. It was a nice "medium" flavor. It coated the wings really well, which for me is one of my biggest things, I have made A LOT of sauces trying to find a good recipe that will coat the wings, and that isn't too watery, and runny, but not so thick that it's like a dip. This is a good balance. The flavor is there, I used the Franks red hot sauce that it said to in the ingredients, and I'm not a huge fan of Franks flavor, next time I will use a different brand.

This sauce was very easy and delicious!  I made it exactly as written, about a half hour before my guests arrived for a football party. I brined 24 wings the night before our party, and took them out about an hour before cooking them, letting them dry on paper towels. When it was time for wings,  I deep fried in batches in a Dutch oven (I don't own a deep fryer), put them on paper towels to remove excess oil, then into a bowl where I mixed the wings with the reheated sauce. So yummy! I served theme with blue cheese dressing on the side and celery.

I tweaked it adding soy sauce, honey, onion powder and sriracha sauce to the original ingredients.  I also used chicken drum sticks instead of wings,  I did part dipping the sauce first and part dipping after cooking the chicken.  I ended double dipping the sauce on both and turning up broiler for the last five minutes.  My condo smells great right now!

We always have hot sauce in our house, so I had all the required ingredients. It turned out GREAT! Didn't use the the cayenne as it would have been too hot for our taste. I will never buy bottled buffalo sauce again.

the only change I made was added a little more cayenne ... great sauce that can be used in other dishes.  I added a couple tablespoons of it to a pasta casserole and the butter flavours really added a nice rich taste ...

This was an excellent sauce! It has the perfect tang and flavor that everyone loves in Buffalo wing sauce. I only had Franks Buffalo sauce, but I used it in place of the regular sauce and followed the rest of the recipe and it came out perfect. This is now my go-to buffalo sauce recipe!

This recipe is the first of Chef John's recipes that I tried.  It is spot on and whenever I need to make a buffalo sauce, this is my go to recipe.  Because of this recipe, whenever I search a recipe and there is an option by Chef John, I will choose his to try.

LOOK NO FURTHER! This is a fantastic wing sauce recipe!! In fact, I would say it's perfect.  I rated this on the the recipe as written, no changes made, however my family and I have played around with it a little and here are our preferences. This may not be a popular choice but we like Crystal hot sauce better than Frank's Red Hot and we use 1/3 of a cup of hot sauce instead of 2/3 C. You cannot go wrong with this recipe exactly as written! 
Also, one of the reviews said to bake the wings at 400* for one hour.  We tried this and (after trying MANY different ways to cook wings) have found that this is the easiest and best way (and foolproof too!) to make wings.  :)

This sauce is my family's favourite ! I make it all the time, my cousin even puts it on his Kraft dinner... 
The only suggestion I would make is if you like it a little thicker to add a tsp of flour.

Only one thing i'd add. If you wanna thicken up the sauce just a tad bit (Mine came out almost wattery) Then just add a simple white flower/water mixture. (Classic thickening technique). It will thicken your sauce up just enough depending how thick you want it, for whatever you're using it on. (I'm using mine for a dipping sauce, so having it a little thicker is a plus)

Good, but better made with Crystal's Hot Sauce rather than Franks...(I think they may use a different kind of chili pepper as the base ingredient.)

For Halloween, I added a lot of black food color paste to the sauce then soaked whole wings in it overnight before baking.  AWESOME looking and tasty BAT WINGS !!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. I added a little bit more cayenne and Frank's sauce than the recipe called for because I like buffalo sauce to have a kick to it. Super easy, super yummy.

I've made this a couple times and it is freaking awesome. I've altered it to my liking to 1 cup Frank's, 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, used 1 tbsp of flour to thicken,  and 1 tsp worcestershire. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it, at first didn't think it was thick as I remember but the taste was spot on!  I tripled the amount of vinegar as directed, I like the vinegar taste buwould at least double it and definitely use the Franks Hot Sauce brand only, others are too unpredictable as to strength and taste.  Slow cook it on stove top for a little longer to bind the flavors and make a little crusty like homemade beans, yum! I boiled the wings in water for 15-20 min then put them in a pan with holes in bottom and sides, I grilled them in the pan until crispy then coated wings and tossed in the sauce, faster and less mess than oven.

The sauce is really really good!  I made it exactly as directed.  

However, I typically use my buffalo sauce for eating with other food items like dipping quesadillas and buffalo chicken sandwiches.  This sauce turned out really thick after it cooled.  I would prefer it to be more runny.  I do know others  have said they thought it turned out too runny, so it surprised me.  

That could have been because I might have cooked it too long.  I had a hard time determining when simmering turned into bubbling on the sides of the pan. (any tips on how to adjust for the future?)

All in all, I would recommend you try it if you haven't!

Perfect flavor! I agree with others - it doesn't need the additional salt. I used salted butter, and it was awesome. I also added just a touch of honey.

This sauce is perfect!!  So easy to make and exactly what a wing sauce should be -- the perfect blend of tangy & spicy.  And, if you bake your wings, the butter really helps with the crispiness.  Delicious -- thanks Chef John!!

This is the perfect buffalo sauce flavor. I used Frank's hot sauce and followed the recipe directly. This is the best of all buffalo sauces I have tried, perfect tangyness, spiciness and consistency. This did not separate like I have had happen many times making buffalo sauce. Will definitely make again and again.

I make wings at home about twice a month and I have always used Franks Wing Sauce and never cared to make my own sauce because I didn't think it would be worth it.  I was wrong!  This sauce is super easy to make and it is great.  It is thinner than the store bought sauce and that is a good thing.  As the wings cool, the thicker store bought sauce will clump onto the sauce more....this sauce does not.  Definite keeper.

I substituted 1/4 cup olive oil for the butter and it's pretty much dead on to a "best wings" place in town (I had an inside connection to the olive oil base ;-)).  Be sure to twice fry your wings (and use fresh) to get that nice crispiness!

Delish!  Made it from a roux, as others suggested, and it was scrumptious!  I tossed cooked, chopped chicken in the sauce, and used it as a topping on a pizza with ranch dressing instead of tomato sauce.   High fives from all my guys!

I omit the cayenne for the purpose of my kid (hot peppers are oil soluble so being heated in the butter ramps up the heat).  The rest is perfect.  Less butter if you want a little more spice.

Great and simple sauce. The taste is amazing! I would recommend marinating the wings for a good while. I've used this recipe a number of times now and the best batch of wings I made was one that I left marinating over night in this sauce. Of course after marinating and baking, I make some more sauce and drench the wings in it! So, so good!

LOVE IT! I did use texas pete. We are a texas pete family and have tried many other hot sauces and do not like them. I did everything like the recipe and it's great!! I'm very picky about my hot wing sauce and this is really good!

Made some changes to my long time basic recipe in which I  incorporated ingredients from this recipe and some of the reviews.  Outstanding. Highly recommend this to anybody who loves hot wings. The ratio that I have always used is 1C Frank's hot sauce to 1/2 C salted butter (2:1) with no additions.  Always easy, classically good and a crowd pleaser.  I decided it was time to bump it up a notch and the whole family was pleased that I made the additions.  Made it again for get together with friends and it was a hit again. The sauce did not separate and was thick enough to stick to the wings.  Spicy, but does not blow your head off. This sauce is excellent if you like things hot but edible.  The following will now be my go to recipe for wing sauce.  I started by slowly heated 1/2 C salted butter in pan whisking in 1 1/2 Tbs  flour till thickened. Did not boil (boiling will separate butter). Stirred in (premixed in a bowl) 1 C Frank's hot sauce and 1/2 tsp each of worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Omitted additional vinegar due to Frank's already having a vinegar base. Omitted adding additional salt due to salt already in butter and hot sauce. I usually bake my wings but with these I barbequed whole wings (Pittsburgh style) on the grill with indirect heat on charcoal Weber kettle grill with soaked cherry wood chips for addition flavor.

You cannot go wrong with this wing sauce if you make sure to use Frank's as your base. It is easy to adjust the heat level by the amount of butter you add to the mix. I usually add some paprika for a bit of a flavor boost and sometimes a few drops of liquid smoke to finish things off. Basically it's a can't miss wing sauce and if someone does not like it, then they don't like Buffalo wings to begin with! :)

This is the real thing. Bottled wing sauce can't compete because butter is expensive. This has butter. This is good. All I did was double the recipe and shake some habenaro sauce to kick it up a bit

I tend to gravitate to Chef John's recipes and they always turn out delicious. This was simple and yummy. My family differs in their tolerance of spicy, and this was pretty mild for 2/3 of us. I'd love to have some information on how to have mild, medium, and hot wing sauce. I'm putting this recipe in the rotation.

Great recipe! I made this tonight for grilled buffalo chicken wraps. It's awesome! I followed the recipe exactly. I thought a whole stick of butter was too much, but I ended up using the whole stick before finishing the sauce and I'm glad I stuck to the directions. It's not buttery tasting at all. It's just like what you'd get in a restaurant, better than some. This is how I am going to make buffalo sauce from now on. My husband took one bite and proclaimed his love for this sauce as well. Thanks, Chef John!

Delicious!  I've made this three times so far. The first time, I followed the directions exactly, except omitted the chili powder because we don't like super spicy food. The last two times, I added a very small amount of water to the pot (I just poured the water in without measuring, but I'm guessing 2-3 tablespoons), and that seemed to tone down the kick just the right amount for us.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is my new favorite recipe for Buffalo style wings. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Chef John! I did tweak a few things and it was a complete success- everyone loved them! Now I need to upgrade to a 50-gallon deep fryer so I can make massive batches at once.
-	I used Land O Lakes Salted butter.
-	I used a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.
-	I used 1/3 tsp of Garlic powder.
-	For the pepper sauce, I used Frank’s Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce.
Everything else remained the same. I bought fresh whole wings that I separated and cleaned. I dusted them all with pepper and deep fried in canola oil at 375 degrees for 11 minutes. Once out of the oil, I drained them for about a minute and tossed them in a plastic bowl with the Buffalo sauce that had been simmering.

Comes out perfect every time. Use Frank's red hot sauce. You could their very hot sauce to add more spice.

I don't even like buffalo sauce, but this was good. I added about 2T less butter and i didn't have garlic powder and I would make this again.

I thought that the sauce was a bit too salty. This could be because I had breaded the chicken with a rub that already had salt in it. I will definitely skip the salt next time.

I used a Louisiana hot sauce. Not a fan. Maybe Frank's would work better, but I did not find it in my grocery store.

Overwhelming buttery taste.

Great sauce.   Used frozen wings, defrosted and cooked on the grill, then soaked and stirred in the sauce, sitting for several minutes.  The char mixing with the sauce after cooking seems to seal it in.  Second time using it, second time it tastes great.

We made this sauce to go on top of "http://allrecipes.com/recipe/241153/crisp-fried-chicken-wings/". Both my wife and I thought they were the best wings we'd ever tasted. I'm a huge fan of the texture and crispness drowned in this epic sauce.

We added about 3 tablespoons of blue cheese dressing into the finished sauce, and it went from good to great! We also left out the cayenne pepper, and it was a crowd-pleasing level of spicyness. We will definitely make this again.

Loved it, used it with chicken breast  to top a pizza. Not too spicy, just right. My only concern was all the butter, I may cut back on it next time.

Made this for some buffalo chicken tenders, received TONS of praise! It's delicious and a much better alternative than just dousing the chicken in regular hot sauce.

This is absolutely restaurant quality and easy to make at home. I'm usually very picky when it comes to my wings because I find most times they aren't hot enough, but this sauce blew me away.

I used rice vinegar because that's what I had,  but other than that,  I followed the recipe to a T.  Rice vinegar gave it a nice and mild vinegar taste that I'm not sure white vinegar would have given it.   Also,  I had to use it as a dip after sloshing it on the wings because it wouldn't stick to the wings super well.  To fix this next time,  I'm going to add some Wondra to it to thicken it up and see if that helps.   Otherwise,  the taste is spot on,  freakin delicious.

This was exactly what I wanted.  I even ran out of enough franks hot sauce and had to add tapatio.  I used this sauce to make baked buffalo chicken rolls ( using egg roll wrappers).  Saved both recipes.

Great authentic buffalo sauce with a very good flavor. Next time I will cut the butter back a bit though. It would also be better to thicken it just a little so it sticks to the wings a bit better.

Decided before the big diet starts tommorow, we wanted wings. This sauce is a definite "final" ultimate pig out good choice. By far the best wing sauce we ever had.  Well worth the effort to use fresh wings.  Deep fried coated wings (recipe from this site) for ten minutes, coated wings in sauce, then baked in 350 degree oven for additional 10 minutes. Dipped in blue cheese dressing  also made from this  site - awesome!

This is a really great tasting sauce. I wish it could be a little more thick. It seemed like it would be ok but the grease from the wings made it too runny. The taste was fabulous, but I couldn't get it to hold on to the wings.

This is really good and does taste just like Anchor Bar Buffalo wings! I did make one change and that was a small fresh garlic clove crushed versus the garlic powder as I didn't have any handy. Very good as a sauce to toss wings in but not good for a dipping sauce; the butter and franks separate quite a bit. In the future I will put some in a bag and toss the wings. I must mention that I baked the wings instead of deep frying, but I would imagine this would be even tastier with them deep fried. Regardless of cooking style, this is a winner for all the lovers of Buffalo flavour. I recommend! I removed one star due to the consistency for dipping perposes.

Easy and Delicious. Definitely a crowd pleaser. I like making this because I can control the sodium content instead of using a pre-made sauce that you purchase in the store.

This is by far my favorite buffalo sauce recipe. Wouldn't change a thing other than the fact that I use clarified butter. Also I splash some sriracha in sometimes

The perfect Buffalo sauce without any of the other jazz. Just down right good sauce.

I love this sauce... my family (especially my wife) like really hot sauce, make your nose run and eyes water type of sauce. so I had fresh habaneros and jalapeños and cut the cayenne in half. all in all this is a great recipe

This is easy to make and a hit of the party. Take the cayenne pepper off the list if you don't like the heat. Add more vinegar for more tang! Happy eating!

This sauce was spot on.  I did not have unsalted butter so I just used regular and it was fine, as in I didn't notice it was "salty".  Not sure if unsalted would have given a different sauce completely or not??  Regardless it was good!  I used it on wings baked as they are baked in Chef John's  Garlic-Ginger Chicken Wings.  I really like how they come out baked that way.

Made it exactly as written and it is fantastic!! 
Years ago in Montreal there was a small Buffalo Bill restaurant close to my parents, and twice a month we'd get these fabulous, spicy wings. I have tried many recipes since, and have eaten wings in many restaurants, but these are simply the BEST. 
Chef John scores another win:-)
Depending on your oven and the size of the wings, you may need to adjust the baking time. I get the organic wings, which are smaller, and they are ready in about 40-45 minutes.

Best Buffalo Wings Sauce ever!

I did reduce the amount of butter the second time I made it by about 2/3 the amount on the recipe, this yielded a slightly less oily sauce when allowed to set.

Love the videos Chef John uploads to AllRecipes!

Loved the flavor!  It reminded me of restaurant quality.  I used a little over 1/2 the recommended butter to start (I would have added more if it needed it, but it was perfect w/ half & I think made it a little spicier which was great!)

I  needed a quick easy change for a light dinner.  Hot wings came to mind, I  couldn't remember my old recipe.   This was a easy quick , great tasting life saver.  It also allowed me to prepare my wings my way;   Bye using this sauce recipe.   ABSOLUTELY GREAT!

This is the BEST wings sauce I've ever tasted.  I boil my wings first then cook on grill until crispy.  After they are all done cooking I toss in this sauce and serve.  Everyone I've made this for has loved it!!

Didn't change a thing.  This was pretty spicy and soaked into the already deep fried chicken wings when they were baked in the oven.  Will definitely make again.

Had to adjust the ingredients down as I just tried this as a way to give a little something to leftover chicken tenders. Used Crystal Hot Sauce because I believe it is the best for wings, and didn't really measure since the amounts were so small. But after eyeballing everything it came out great, good and hot almost a little too hot. But I'll try again and actually measure everything and see how it comes out

I follow the recipe to the t and  have been pleased with the results every time. I made two batches  for family and friends  at a  lunch I hosted recently and they thought I'd brought the wings back from the Anchor Bar  in Buffalo...something that my husband  and I often do because we love their wings  so much! Thank you Chef John!!

Tastes good but not quiet the same taste as from a good restaurant. I added more Franks red hot and some blue cheese. Still came out great. Have to play around some more to make it taste more like a restaurant got sauce

This was excellent! I omitted the cayenne (because I'm a wimp) and didn't add any extra salt because it tastes great without it. I used this to make Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches from this site and it was really delicious! Highly recommend :-)

I'm from right down the street from Buffalo New York "from Erie Pennsylvania" I grew up with some of the best wings. I now live in Phoenix Arizona and it's hard to find a good wing here. This recipe does it. They are great. Now for me to make other flavors. If anyone has other wing recipes please post them. I use to eat ones in Erie flavor was called Cajun,  bar b q, parmesan. I need the recipe for that flavor

I have searched and tried other "buffalo" recipes. They were okay, but not what I was looking for. But this, this was AMAZING and EXACTLY what my wife and I have looked for. I made it lastnight for dinner and shared with my in-laws who are Filipino. Getting them to try anything new is a challenge, so when they actually like something then that says a lot and they LOVED this recipe. I don't have access to Franks Hotsauce here in the Philippines so I used a local brand and it was still amazing. My wife and I really enjoy the chef in the video and have used several other of his recipes and everytime the food is just delicious. I highly reccomend this recipe and others that the chef shares. Thanks.

Just like the original! Smoked some jumbo wings from the meat department not the those puny frozen ones and tossed em around in this sauce, oh my! So good!Be sure to follow the instructions to the letter too, don't be one of those people that substitutes all of the ingredients and then complains that it tasted bad. If it says Franks RedHot it's for a reason.

Although I have never been to buffalo, I am an avid buffalo wing eater, and these where spot on. Very delicious, I like wings a little on the spicy side so I double the amount of cayenne pepper. Turned put great and I will definitely be making this in the future.

Ok. This is really good stuff! I did add a small amour of flour to thicken, but my son an 18 y/o wing fanatic, loved them along with some neighbors that stopped by. If you are skeptical try it it's a winner!!

I tried the recipe a little vinegary.  I added ghost pepper powder, scorpion powder, 3 dried ghost peppers and 1 Carolina reaper dried.  The picture is the sauce simmering down I will post the heat level in a little while.

This is exactly the same recipe I have been making for as long as I can remember eating homemade wings . Great on Gator tail bites to. Franks Red hot is the best to make it with, you get that original Buffalo Wing flavor. No other hot sauce works. Thanks for sharing the recipe Chef John. "JP"  The Florida Pig Smoker

That's the stuff!! Don't try using any other sauce than Frank's. It just ain't the same! I did my chicken wings lollipop style. That's where you cut through the skin and tendon of the at the bottom of drumstick part of the wing, grab the wing by the bottom of the bone and with you other hand push all the meat up to the top. Break off the joint cartledge at the bottom of the bone and then cook and sauce the wings without getting any on the dry bone sticking out. For the other part of the wing with two bones in it slit the skin, pull out the smaller bone and process the same as the drumstick part of the wing. I normally use about fourteen napkins and a wet dishtowel when I'm eating my buffalo wings. With this method I only use the tail of my T-shirt.

We have some buffalo wing lovers in this house (not me), so I tried this. I had Tapatio hot sauce on hand, so used it. I also used the cayenne. I thought something might be wrong when they tried one bite & flames shot out of their ears! So next time I will not use Tapatio. I tried it & the flavor is good, was just too hot. I'll use Frank's red hot next time.

Best hot wing sauce I've tasted,  I add about 1/4 cup of Valentina hot sauce to the mix and it's bomb!  My wife loves 'em and she "doesn't even like hot wings".  5 stars for sure!!!

Excellent! I breaded and fried some wings, made the sauce with one adjustment: I thickened it a bit with guar gum. Then I poured it over the wings and baked them for a while. Definitely will make this again!

Good sauce. Tired of over paying for a tiny little cup of sauce. This is better than what I have been paying for, easy to make, and have as much sauce as I want. A must if you like your wings saucy.

Excellent recipe. I just recommend more cayenne. Even my friend (from NY) who can hardly eat much of the food I can make because of the spiciness suggested more kick.

I made this sauce to go in my buffalo chicken grilled cheese. I like it a lot, but the Worcestershire sauce was very strong. Next time, I think I'll cut it out.

We grilled the wings over charcoal and served with this sauce, delicious! Personal opinion: you don't need that much butter, half of it (or less) is good enough. And as some people mentioned you should serve the sauce when it's warm or the butter and sauce may separate. Also Red Hot is the only sauce you should use for Buffalo wings and it's salty enough so you probably don't need extra salt.

This is great! I used what I had on hand, which happened to be a store brand Louisiana-style hot sauce, no Worchestershire so I subbed A1 sauce, and a 6-pepper blend instead of just cayenne powder. I know it takes away from the original style, but this recipe is a great base to make it your own! It's sooo good =]

My husband and my boys LOVED them....They said it taste as good as the Cheesecake Factory wings... I did season my wings with seasoning salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder first...However, I fried them instead of baking which I think made a big difference....Will Absolutely make again

Very good sauce. Reminds me of a sauce at Buffalo Wild Wings, spicy garlic, I think.  I only used 1 teaspoon of vinegar and it was plenty.

I used frank's Red Hot Sauce and I let it heat with out simmering for the entire forty minutes thatI baked the wings.then I took the wings out and smothered them in the sauce and put them back in for another ten minutes. The butter rises to the top of the saucepan as soon as you take the heat away so I added a tablespoon of flour to thicken it. The end result was this amazingly thick, tangy, spicy, sauce that clung to the meat while I still had plenty left over to dip.my only regret is that I dint make home made blue cheese to dip as well.

I found this sauce to be tasty, but lacking on the HEAT side. After reading some of the other reviews I decided to add one tbl sp of dark brown sugar, and one tbl sp. of Old Bay Seasoning, I also, used only three quarters of a stick of butter. That was my tweeking it. The flavor was great. Keep in mind I made it exactly as written the first time. My husband said they were too spicy for him, however for my son and I not nearly enough heat. Each heat factor varies. Over all very pleased with this recipe.

I used this as the sauce for boneless buffalo wings. Amazing! I wouldn't change a thing. I followed the recpe to a tee. In the future, I will half it just because there are only two of us and we had extra sauce. Truly, though, this sauce is wonderful.

This recipe is great. It is super fast to make so once you are done cooking your meat and realize you don't have any buffalo sauce (happened to me) it just take a minute to make.

Awesome! This is everything I look for in Buffalo sauce. I like a little extra garlic and you have to make sure you don't over cook it, I had to throw out my first batch because the butter separated so all the oil was floating on top. Just finish melting the butter off the heat and you'll be fine.

Yummy and easy. Why buy? Make your own with this recipe. Tossed this sauce with wings that were floured/seasoned/baked. Boys had them when they were sloppy and said they were delicious. Husband had them after they stood warm in oven for a while and he loved the not so sloppy version and said the taste was wonderful. No leftovers.

Ok. I`m sold. I made this sauce for my wife and tried it myself but I don't even like sauce. The entire house loved this sauce even me. Wonder taste. I salt and pepper my chicken, flour, and dip it in egg and milk and back to the flour. Then just dipped the chicken in the sauce and was great. Crispy, saucy and chicken was juicy. Thumbs up to Chef John.

I've been looking for a version of a wing sauce I could make at home and this has to be the tastiest recipe I've ever had. This is a savory sauce for such a simple recipe and it was VERY easy to make. I tossed this sauce on flour-dredged baked wings and it made me think I could open a restaurant! Wife loved it so much she wants it to be a staple in our recipe box. Thanks for the recipe Chef!

Awesome and easy recipe. So good! I've never made buffalo wing sauce before and this was incredibly easy and really tasty. Tossed some breaded chicken strips in it and threw them on top of a pile of crispy fries. Finished that off with some cheese to cool it down. Delicious!

Tastes just like my dad's buffalo sauce! Makes authentic wings just like we'd eat at Duff's in Buffalo. Don't use anything but Frank's hot sauce though (no Tabasco sauce)!

My family loves wings, I've never really liked them because of the flavor. I thought I'd try this sauce after flouring and baking the pieces in a buttered baking pan. Boy was it good. Will be my official wing sauce from now on!!

Simple and classic buffalo wing recipe. I've used it twice already and will continue to use it again and again. I added a dash more Worcestershire sauce and vinegar the second time and OMG it was amazing!!!! Buffalo wings is one of my favorite foods so if you like traditional wing sauce this is the go to recipe.

These were awesome. I followed the Restaurant Style Wings recipe on this site for the breading and used this sauce. I followed the recipe exactly w/ one exception, A1 instead of Worcestershire sauce because I was out. They were better than any wings I'v had at any restaurant. Oh, and I dipped my wings, waited a couple min then dipped them again. Almost ran out of sauce that way, so next time I will make a little extra.

I was disappointed in how the sauce separated so quickly. I did use unsalted butter FWIW - it was pretty good taste-wise, but it was not pretty and too thin for my preference.

Finger licking good!! My husband and guests loved it.  The sauce makes the wings taste like you're eating wings at a restaurant. I did alter one ingredient.  I misread the recipe and put one whole stick of better and not a half but it still came out great! The butter wasn't overwhelming as one reviewer said.  I deep fried the wings toss on the sauce and got great reviews at my party this weekend.  This recipe is so easy and a keeper. Thanks!

My husband and I really like this sauce.  I marinate my wings over night in Dale's seasoning and omit the salt from the the wing sauce.  I bake them at 200 for two hours and then increase heat to 400 for about 30 to 45 minutes. Strain off the Dale's and coat with the wing sauce. Very tender and not too greasy.  Oh and I buy the wings at my local butcher shop and they are very meaty - compared to the grocery store or frozen wings.

This recipe is spot on, exactly what I'm looking for in a buffalo sauce. Baked the wings instead of frying and deglazed the pan with 1/3 stick of butter to get all the flavor into the sauce. Will definitely use this recipe again, it's simple and delicious.

Was looking for a recipe that would be close to The Varsity in Syracuse. And I found it!  Made it for some fellow SU alums and they loved it.

i am going to blame the new yorkers for this and not chef john.. i liked it.. but i was expecting to be in love with it.. i did double the cayenne.. i didn't use franks red hot and used my go-to wing sauce.. so maybe that's why i feel the way i do (?).. i guess i like my wings more tangy, spicy, and much more pungent.. i had no problem eating up the wings and that's why this deserves a 4 not a 3.. thanks for the effort

We like to grill our wings. Used this sauce after grilling and it was the best wing sauce we have made at home. It has a great kick to it, but not overwhelming.

This was so easy and I enjoy knowing exactly what is in the food I am eating or serving. I made this recipe for a get together of my husband's friends and they all commented on how great the chicken wings turned out with this sauce. I will definitely use this again and again.

Yummy!! My mom was gonna use regular tabasco sauce for our chicken wings, but then i recommended this recipe and boy, is it DELICIOUS! We did use tabasco sauce as the base. Thanks Chef John!***CHANGES*** We reduced the butter to 1/4 cup. it tasted perfect. Also, we stuck the chicken in the over for 3-5 min after coating with the sauce. Waaay better when baked a little in the oven since it causes a little of the sauce to crisp and leaves plenty of saucy goodiness to dip in as well.

It definitely is the foundation for superb Buffalo wings!.

Just a few comments:

I found that using Frank's Red Hot exclusively made the sauce too mild & predictable for my taste.  I recommend mixing in a Habanero sauce or other of your preference (~20%).  It was an improvement.

I realize that this is a Buffalo wing SAUCE recipe but I found that if you boil & simmer the wings for ~10 minutes before putting them in the oven/grill that they are far more tender & blend even better w/this particular sauce.

Just be sure to let them rest & dry them before marinating them with just a coating of this sauce.  After they baked/grilled add the majority of this sauce & put out the rest for dipping.  It will have better impact that way and the chicken will taste fresh!

Wing sauce was very good. Wish I knew a way to make a little spicier for our Latin taste buds.

Chef John does it again. This sauce was wonderful. So glad that I doubled the recipe because I ended up having to make more wings the next day. And, this sauce tasted even better. A definite keeper. Will be making these again very soon for Friday night movie night at home with friends.

I left the cayenne pepper out but I don't think that would have given the flavor I was looking for I added a little lawery's season salt but that still did not do it for me. I may try again with a different hot sauce. not sure the butter was a good choice as that made things a little greasy. I may cut back on that also.

Added a little more vinegar to bring down the heat of the sauce. This was oh, so good!
