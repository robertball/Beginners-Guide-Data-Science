Made these cookies and followed the recipe to the letter, they were perfect!  I have tried other recipes for black walnut cookies and this one is the best, the texture of the cookie was perfect.

Easy to put together & taste good too.  I thought they would have more maple flavor...the nuts seem to be the prominent though.

I thought these were quite good. I made 1/2 recipe and got 20 cookies. I cut it in two pieces, then, instead of 3 to refridgerate for 1 hour. They remind me of the marriage of a pecan sandie cookie and a soft maple shortbread flavored cookie. They have both a crisp and soft texture. I liked that they weren't too sweet to. I liked them better the next day: They tasted like a big soft version of a windmill cookie without the spicy after taste or cinnamon.

I got raves about this recipe from my friends at our cookie exchange.  The only difference is that I used walnuts that were already roasted with sugar, salt, and vanilla.

I was previously not a fan of black walnuts, but was yearly gifted with a bag after a friend's trip to Missouri.  This year tried them in this recipe and WOW!  Buttery, amazing black walnut cookies.  Can't wait 'til next year!

Great recipe, I doubled the maple extract to 1 tsp rather then 1/2. In my first round of cookies I went 1 1/4 cup walnuts but its better with the full 1 1/2 cups as suggested by the default recipe. All and all very well done!
