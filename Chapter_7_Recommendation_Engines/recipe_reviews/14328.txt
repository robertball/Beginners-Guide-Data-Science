This is a new and different way to have a light tasting refreshing salad. Served it for company and everyone loved it!

Good. The kids would not eat it. My husband and I liked it but it is too rich to eat a lot of and it makes LOT. I would make it again when there are more people to share it.

Very good! It was so good I even ate it for breakfast. Instead of using a jello mold I put salad in an 8 x 8 pan cut it in squares and served on a lettuce leaf. My family really enjoyed it.

I made this one for a church function and I followed the recipe very closely and it was a big hit all around.

This is a great recipe. My grandfather used to make this and I was so happy to find it here. If some people find it tastes too much like mayo maybe they are using salad dressing and not mayo which has a lighter taste. My whole family loves this salad. Thank you for this recipe.

Besides my family this is one of my favorite things about Thanksgiving. My mom let me help make it when I was little. Here some 50 odd years later I still make it for Thanksgiving. Its not for everyone but that means more for me!
