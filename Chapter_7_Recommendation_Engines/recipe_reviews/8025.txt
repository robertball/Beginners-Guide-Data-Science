I have made this cake many times for almost 25 years! This is incredibly moist with the perfect chocolate icing. When I'm asked to bring something for a large gathering, I often bring this, baked into bars. Bake in a 15x10" pan, about 20-30 minutes. It's easier to serve this way, and goes further too.

Have been wowing people with this cake for 15+ years.  I have always used: chocolate fudge cake mix instead of devil's, 4 eggs instead of two and boil the icing base for 1 minute instead of two.  TIP to make super MOIST:  after boiling icing base and adding chocolate chips, I pour the icing mixture over cake when chips are 1/2 to 3/4 melted (instead of smooth).  This allows some of the milk/sugar/butter to seep down into the cake, and also leaves small morsels of chocolate chips in the icing on top.  Super easy to make, knock your socks off taste.

The cake alone is worthy of many, many more stars.  (I did add about 1/4 cup of oil to the batter).  Rich, moist and a nice mild cherry flavor.  Mmmm.  The frosting, however, wasn't the greatest match for this wonderful cake.  Too sweet and distracting.  After making it again, you absolutely must use the SATINY CHOCOLATE GLAZE recipe instead.  Mr. "I don't like cherries" has already requested a third round with this cake...

Have made this recipe many times because I am a chocolate cherry lover.  The recipe is a good place to start, but I have experimented with it since i have made it so many times.  Cake texture is MUCH better if you mix the wet ingredients together first (including your cherry pie filling), and also add 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup oil to those ingredients.  Then mix in your cake mix.  Also, instead of using the frosting recipe, I fold in dried cherries and chocolate chips to the batter, then bake, and serve the cake alone.  The dried cherries and chocolate chips definitely give the flavor of the cake a big boost!

Absolutely fantastic. Most importantly, it does not taste like a packaged cake. It's absolutely delicious --- moist, flavorful, festive but still simple. I baked it in a 10" Bundt pan for about 40 mns and it came out perfect. The almond extract makes a big difference, so do not skip or substitute it. I suggest following the recipe exactly as is. The frosting is fudgy and fabulous. The cherry flavor is subtle, but still definitely there. The whole thing is much better the next day, however. You might not be that excited about it if you eat it when it's just out of the oven. Make the cake, pour the frosting on it per directions, and serve it the next day. It's a major hit!

Best cake I ever made. I used a dark chocolate with pudding in cake mix. You must use receipe frosting as it makes the cake.  Family loves it! A receipe to never forget.

This cake is the best! It's been around forever known as "Chocolate Covered Cherry Cake" It was the first dessert to disappear at a church function and nobody believed how easy it is to make! The chocolate icing is amazing and Soo easy. I can't wait to try it on other types of cakes/cookies in the future! I added pecans to the icing just because my dad loves them :o) I'm sure it didn't change the flavor all that much. I'm also planning to try this reviewer's ideas soon... "Used a CLASSIC WHITE mix and BLUEBERRY filling. used VANILLA EXTRACT instead of almond, and added 1/2 of LEMON'S ZEST to batter, as well as a handful of huge frozen blueberries. Baked for 32 min in a bundt pan. For frosting I halved the recipe and used WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS in lieu of the chocolate and added the remaining LEMON ZEST from the lemon....absolute perfection. Due to less surface area, it was perfect to halve the frosting recipe for bundt"

Mmmm.  Very yummy.  It was so moist and the cherry gave it just enough flavor.  I sprinkled a little powder sugar over the top and it looked so elegant.  My guests raved, and I couldn't keep my own hands off it.

This cake was excellent! I substituted vanilla for the almond extract.  It was a cinch to prepare and the icing was the perfect finishing touch.  It was very moist and the frosting was not too rich and didn't get hard or crusty as some frostings do.  I will definately be making this again. :)

Such a good recipe. I have been making this for a long time and it always gets rave reviews. My husband is not a chocolate lover and he wanted this cake for his birthday. The almond extract is a must and so is the frosting. Don't try to substitute store bought, it won't be the same.

Very easy cake to make, I did not make the frosting as its for my son to take to work tomorrow.  I did only get to taste a very small slice, but I thought it was a great tasting moist cake.  I think you could use use this recipe as a base for a great tasting black cherry Gateau.

Even though I normally make cakes from scratch, I tripled the ingredients for 50 servings for a church dinner, and people were begging for the recipe. I have to admit, it was delicious! Very easy to make even when tripling the recipe.

I wasn SOOOOO not impressed with this cake.  It looked beautiful, but that was about the most exciting part of it.  I thought that the actual cake part was very bland.  It was not bad tasting, just not great.  The texture was very moist.  The frosting was very good and had good chocolate flavor.  It kind of saved the cake.  Without that it would have just taseted like bread with the occasional bite of cherry.  Sorry but I will not be making this again.  If I am going to spend the calories I want to enjoy every bite.

For a beginner I needed to know how to test if cake is done after 25-30min. I removed it after 30 but toothpick was not clean. Shortly after that the cake sunk in the middle. I thought since this was a moist and chewy cake that maybe it would not test done prior to removal. What did I do wrong?

After reading the recipe several times and looking at my dried mess in my bowl I decided to follow the cake directions and add the liquid since these directions just said add cherries and eggs....otherwise this would have been a 5 star dessert. IT was delish and the chocolate topping is a must. I did poke holes in the cake before adding frosting and WOW

Used a Bundt pan and drizzled the icing over the cake. It turned out wonderfully, and it went just oh-so-quickly. I will make this again and again.

I got rave reviews last week for this cake.  I followed the recipe, but jazzed it up a bit for presentation.  First off, instead of 9x13, I used two round 9" pans.  I used the cherries from another can of pie filling (minus all the goo) between layers, then poured the icing all over the finished product.  One tip: try to pour evenly and avoid smoothing the icing with a spatula--it takes away from the shiny finish.  When the icing was dry and I was ready to serve, I dusted the entire cake with a mixture of cocoa powder & powdered sugar (combine 1 part powdered sugar with 3 parts cocoa powder for a bittersweet dust).  It was gorgeous, moist, and everyone gobbled it up.

This cake is fabulous! It is so moist and not overly sweet. I made it two days ago, and it tastes even better now. I made it in my springform pan. It looked great. It can easily be decorated with fruit and whipped cream. I plan to make it again for an upcoming social event.:-)

Yummy!  Very easy.  I made this as a last minute dessert to take to a party and it was a hit.  Not overly heavy on the cherry flavor but very moist & chocolaty.  I used Triple Chocolate Cake instead of Devil's Food since that's what I had.  I used a 9x13 pan. I used the frosting also even though I was worried after reading some of the reviews.  I think the frosting is a must; don't substitute.

I love this cake and have been eating it since I was a kiddo. I bake it in a 9x13 cake pan and add chocolate pudding to the top instead of frosting, by refridgerating this cake with the pudding, it makes it unbelievably moist and very yum, yummy!!

Wish I could give this 100 stars. Melt in your mouth moist. I microvave store bought chocolate frosting for 35 seconds. Stir and pour 1/2 container over cake. then you can sprinkle with nuts or choclate chips. Saves time and looks beautiful.

I needed a quick dessert for a gathering I had - saw this but the only cake mix I had was red velvet - it was AWESOME!! I made it again for a party a few days later & used the devils food cake mix...I liked the red velvet better. Not sure what the picture is at the top of the page - did not look appetizing & thought about looking for another recipe....glad I didn't :)

this is excellent, but as written, the icing winds up cracking and gets a very stiff outer coat that breaks apart when you cut it.  Otherwise it is yummy and so easy.  I will try boiling the icing a little bit less next time!

Very good and so easy. I think this will be my new way of making cakes... box cake + pie filling! I wonder what vanilla cake with lemon filling would taste like... :P

Made this with my 10 yr old chocoholic grand-daughter and she (and the rest of the family) absolutely loved it!!!!  It's also good baked in a cookie sheet (if making for a potluck or wanting a thinner cake) and I want to try putting in mini-muffin tins for a bite full of wonderfulness!)  We made the frosting listed in this recipe.  We thought it was going to be too sweet and considered using less sugar but went with the recipe and it was just perfect!  Thank you, Jan, for a moist, easy, cake recipe!

Love this cake! The last time I made this,I made some changes-went to a bundt pan, but the center piece was missing, so had to keep checking for doneness & adding time. Ran out of almond flavoring so used pecan flavoring. Forgot to add the chip to the batter,so pulled it out after 4 minutes & stirred them in. Despite all this it turned out great & was a hit at the party I took it to. The frosting is sweet, but made a lovely drape down the sides of the cake, texture was fine.

I make cakes for a local cafe and this gets rave reviews!  I haven't made the frosting from this recipe.  Shamed to say I just use the canned.  I tend to put a nice raspberry jam filling in between the layers and call it Black Forest Cake!

My family loved this so much and my husbands co workers! 2 days after I made it I had to make 3 more for 3 different events  everyone loves it and it goes the same day it's made. Plus I found it so simple to make. I used milk chocolate frosting to top it off and it was Divine!!!

Easy and awesome!  The only change I made in the ingredients is I used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract instead of 1 teaspoon.  I made it in a bundt pan, drizzled the FANTASTIC frosting on it as if it were a glaze, and then placed eight maraschino cherries on top for decoration.  Prepared this way I have a pretty cake that tastes WONDERFUL!  I took it to a potluck and received rave reviews; I am definitely going to use this recipe over and over!

This cake was pretty good, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because I didn't care for the cherries, although my husband LOVED it!  It was very simple to make and I'll make it again for my husband

Wow, wow, wow!
This cake was absolutely delicious! I made a nice frosting for the cake and used food colouring to make it pink for Valentine's day.

I accidentally forgot to add the extract, however it was wonderful all the same.

Perhaps next time I will add more cherry filling as it was a bit too subtle.

I highly recommend that you all make this cake, it was moist and wonderful!

I made this cake without the frosting because I was short on time so I used pre-packaged chocolate frosting. This cake is a great alternative to just a regular chocolate cake. The cherries add a nice texture and make this cake very moist and the almond extract is necessary- I added a 1/2 tsp. extra, in fact. Rave reviews from the DH. I made 2 8-inch round cakes and made a beautiful layered cake and served it after our Valentine's dinner. Will make this again for another special occasion!

Out of this world! My family went crazy over this cake.....I loved it too and I am not a huge chocolate "nut". The only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of almond extract to the icing recipe. This one is a keeper for sure!

this ranks right up there with Texas Sheet Cake, with the added advantage of not being quite so sweet (or fattening!).  I always halve the icing recipe, though; I find the full recipe overwhelms the cake and you only need a thin glaze on top.

I have yet to make this; I just found the recipe this evening, but when I do, I think that I will simplify it even further by just making ganache and pouring it over while warm.  (Equal ounces of cream and chopped bittersweet chocolate.  Bring cream to the boil, add chocolate and stir until melted--dark chocolate deliciousness that tastes like flourless chocolate cake.)  I usually make ganache using 16 oz. cream and 16 oz. dark or bittersweet chocolate.  I use ganache to dip cupcakes or pour over a regular cake (easiest frosting ever) It then makes a beautiful canvas to add piped flowers, etc.  Any remaining, I put in the refrigerator to solidify then cube.  I have lots of very fudgy squares that last for quite a while.  I've been able to go a three weeks with great willpower.  I don't like regular fudge--too grainy and sweet, but I LOVE this.  I don't like my chocolate too sweet.

This is exactly Chocolate Cherry Cake II.  I took "MELLO 57" suggestion and blended the pie filling, eggs & extract in the blender first.  Actually I only had 1 egg so for the other egg I used 2 Tbsp water, 1 Tbsp oil & 2 tsp baking powder and it worked great.  I also added 1/2 c applesauce and 1 c flour-coated semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter.  I baked it in a 9X13 pyrex dish for 35 minutes.  Wow!  This is the most moist cake I've ever had -and I've had a lot!  I didn't make the frosting because I added the chocolate chips to the batter and I figured I'd just dust a little powdered sugar on top.  At the last minute, my mom twisted my arm and said to put frosting so I cheated and warmed up 1/2 a store bought chocolate frosting in the microwave and poured it on top.  This is very, very rich so you must be a chocoholic to enjoy this.

I only had two eggs, so I threw in a heaping teaspoon of whipped cream cheese (the only thing I could think of that I had on hand that would help add moisture).  I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I made this in a bundt pan and didn't put frosting on it.  Within an hour of it cooling half of it was gone.  The only reason the other half is still left is because my boyfriend and I agreed to safe it until tomorrow.  Amazing!!!

My family has been making this cake for almost 10 years. It's always a hit. Infact... so many people associate this cake with me (in my old home town) they call it Sybil cake. I don't know where the recipe originated... but it's a classic winner. It's SOOO chocolicious.

I give this four stars but it's because I'm a dolt and decided to frost it myself with a whipped cream based frosting so it wasn't chocolatey enough for me. If I would have used the chocolate chips as the recipe states, I'm sure it would have been decadent. Next time!

I made this for a Church fellowship and nearly all was eaten; with mostly good reviews.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter.  Like others it wasn't very 'cherry tasting'and was definitely better the 2nd day.  Don't really know what you could add to improve flavor.  I did put a maraschino cherry on each cake square and I baked mine in a 10X15 jelly roll pan.  Good but not Great.

Pretty good. A twist on the basic chocolate bundt cake. It didn't have enough cherry flavor for me personally, but was an overall decent cake.

Great cake.  Very moist and very easy to prepare.  We made it for a group of 170 people for a church dessert and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.  Defintely will use this recipe again.

This recipe is the best! My mom made it for years. The only thing that I do different is buy another can of cherry pie filling and drizzle it on top of the frosting. To Die For!!!

I used 3 eggs because my eggs were kind of small.  Other than that I followed the directions, baked for 30 minutes and poured the icing on a few minutes after it was done. Wonderful!

Very nice, simple to make, moist cake.  I think it is much prettier in a bundt pan; however, if you do put it in a bundt pan, bake for approximately 50 minutes.  This cake cuts beautifully even if it is warm!  I made this cake for a friend who had left shoulder surgery and her husband who had broken his left shoulder!  I figured something chocolate would hit the spot, and I think this one did!  I just dripped the icing and only used half of that called for.  Also, I used reduced sugar cherry pie filling.

I have made this cake for over 7 years now with almost exact ingredients (3 eggs instead of 2).  It has been an all-star favorite at EVERY potluck or dinner I have taken it to.  Everybody asks for the recipe!  The cherries are to make the cake moist, not to totally flavor it...it's a subtle taste.  You can also find the recipe in the original Cake Doctor cookbook.

Oops! I inadvertently added all the ingredients together before reading that part of it was for the frosting.  So, I thought, might as well bake it and see what happens.  I had to bake it longer.  I took it out when the edges of the cake pulled away from the sides of the 9 x 13 pan (probably another 20 minutes).  Very very rich.  It is delicious.  I like tasting the chocolate chips in the cake.  Tastes better the next day after cooling. I put it in the refrigerator to chill. I had a piece of cake for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee.  What a way to start the day!

What a delicious, beautiful, and super simple cake!  I used a lower sugar version of the pie filling, 3/4 cup sugar, 3 T butter, and 1/2 t. extract.  It turned out so well and tasted great right after cooling,  Can't imagine it could taste even better the next day, but that will certainly be something to look forward to!  Baked about 40 min in a Bundt pan.  Thank you!

I made this and it was really easy to make and really yummy to eat.  I made it into muffins though.   I didn't make or use the icing, I left them plain  Next time I am thinking of trying this recipe using a butter pecan cake mix and apple pie filling.

My review was completely changed without any warning, so I'll just make it short and say that this recipe, as is, is very disappointing. Make the changes suggested by past reviewers and it'll come out a lot better.  Made as directed it just tastes like chocolate cake.

LOVED IT! This one will definitely stay in my recipe box.  Having said that I don't like cake mixes but I like this recipe. I suggest to anyone trying this for the first time that you don't change a thing.  I used Duncan Hines Devils food cake mix as suggested.  this cake comes together so quickly and easily which is icing on the cake so to speak.

I wish I would have read the recipe description a little closer! I didn't realize this recipe is for a sheet cake, and when I went to "pour" the batter into the pan, I had to spoon it in. I was very disappointed, and came back to read reviews. I took other suggestions and added 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup water. It turned out more cakelike and less dense. I took a shortcut and just used canned chocolate fudge icing. This cake is a keeper now!!

I loved the simple recipe! I used 3 eggs (because I read that someone used 4) and it took a bit longer because I used a 9" circle pan- but it worked well and took about 45/50 minutes. I got antsy and poured the frosting on before the cake cooled, but I think it'll be okay. I decorated with maraschino cherries and chocolate chips and some powdered sugar. Yay cake-making!

Everyone loved this cake!  The coolest part is it is a dump-cake:  my toddler could have thrown the mixture together.  I made the recipe as-is.  I think I cooked the frosting too long, because mine turned out grainy-textured (maybe the sugar re-crystallized).

I've made a variation of this recipe many times before, but lost my copy. Went online and have tried a few other versions before finding this one.  I make it in a bundt pan and with the addition of a cup of chocolate chips and half a cup of chopped pecans, this one is the BEST! Everyone loves it and it stays moist and fudgy for days. The topping is wonderful. I also sprinkle some chopped pecans to the top. Yummy!

Awesome cake! I used to make this years ago, and I'd lost the recipe. It sure was great to find it here! The only difference is, I put 1/4 cup of water in the batter. Makes it easier to handle, and the cake comes out a little lighter. Thanks... this one's a keeper!

This is a fantastic recipe!  & if you omit the frosting, it is very low in fat!  The cake is moist & it tastes just like a chocolate covered cherry!
I was not particularly thrilled with the frosting.  I made a bundt cake & it was too thick to drizzle.  In the future, I will use a chocolate glaze instead.  It is also very good with just whip cream so you could omit the frosting & use fat free cool whip & you would have an awesome lowfat treat!  Thanks for this yummy recipe, it will go into my files!

This cake was perfect for my daughter's birthday topped with a few chocolate covered cherries. Moist and yummy. It helps to break up the dry mix with a fork before stirring in the other ingredients.

Turned out perfectly the first time.  I made it in a Bundt pan, so the frosting did some puddling up in the middle, but that's the good part to scrape up!  I took it to my church and everyone raved!

This cake was so good.  It was one of three at a party and it was the only one that completely disappeared.  The frosting is rich and smooth with a great chocolate taste.  I did use milk chocolate chips however as I am not a dark chocolate person that much.

PHENOMENAL!!!!  This chocolate cake recipe is one of the best I've ever had--it's so moist and every once in awhile you find a delicious cherry hiding!!  We used store bought vanilla frosting and it was delicious!!!  One word of warning---you have to stir this very thoroughly because the cherries tend to hide pockets of unmixed cake--so stir stir stir!!

Very Tasty - extremely easy to make -  and no one will know that it from a cake mix.  I make the cake in a stoneware bar pan and when the cake has cooled down - I spread the icing on. So quick and easy.  I find that the bar pan gives a better sized slice of cake, not as much to hold in your hand.  The batter does appear stiff but just ignore - the cake turns out beautifully

I made the cake and icing according to the directions but when I poured the icing on the cake it absorbed into the cake instead of sitting on top of it as expected which made it a mushy goo.

Nice, fast desert.  Very easy.  Made 2 cakes for work, 1 with the frosting and 1 without (for those who dislike frosting).  Provided some Cool-Whip for those who took the cake with no frosting.  It is good both ways, but I personally liked the frosting version better.  You could probably use 1/2 the frosting and that would be plenty. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last weekend and it was a huge hit!  I had a store-bought frosting, so I put it in the microwave just to soften it before spreading it on.  I took another reviewer's idea and poked some holes in it so the frosting would work its way into the cake.  A couple of us were craving it soon after it was gone.

Oh My Gosh!!!  This cake is great!! Cherries chocolate cake, and fudge frosting all come together into one great tasting cake.  Didn't change a thing and never plan too. All you need when you are done is a cold glass of milk.  Thanks for the great recipe Jan.

This cake was soo good! Very moist- very tasty!
Next time I am going to add another can of cherry's on top over icing. I had to buy the almond extract special for the recipe and Im glad I did- you can taste the difference. Excellent- will definitely make again!

A real winner with anyone who likes cherry and choco combo!  Don't try to save time, though - the boiled frosting MAKES the cake :-)  I use the air type cake pan, and the cake comes out perfectly every time.

When I made this recipe I didn't use the icing. I thought it may be a bit to rich for my liking. I put whipped cream on the top  drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Took it to a pot luck and it got rave reviews.

This is the bars version so it is drier than a cake. For the cake version, I add 3 eggs, 1 stick soften butter, and I also take the cherries out and just use the liquid until blended well. I then fold the cherries in so they aren't broken up. The pie filling companies aren't putting many cherries in the can any more. I've been making the cake version for over 25 years now. It is what we prefer.

Unbelievably simple, and yet my cake held its own as the dessert of my amazing brother-in-law's 4th of July feast.  He spent 10 hours preparing his wonderful meal, I spent next to nothing preparing my cake... and got the same WOWs.  This was a hit.

I give the CAKE four stars because it was really good. Very, very moist. I thought it could use more cherries though, so next time I will add another can. I did not make the frosting so I cannot comment on that. I heated up a can of ready made chocolate frosting in the micro for about a minute and poured it over the cake (which I made in a bundt pan). I will definitely make again but add another can of cherries. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought I was going to love this, but it was really just a case of like.  I made in a bundt pan and baked for 40 minutes.  I opted to add a 3rd egg so that it would be dense.  The chocolate flavor was good but the cherry flavor is only subtle. I made this cake 1 day ahead and it was cold out of the fridge when it was served, perhaps it would have more flavor closer to room temperature.  It made a nice chocolate cake, but doesn't warrant a 5 star rating as I had hoped.

Great easy recipe! Made in a bundt pan. As another reviewer said "fold in the pie filling". This was good the first day and wonderful after it sat in the fridge overnight! Sitting made the chocolate icing absorb into the cake and was much more moist.

This is the perfect solution to something more than chocolate from a box and is fast & EASY! The chocolate glaze reminds me of a Texas sheet cake& the cherries make for a very moist cake!! Definitely worth keeping ingredients stocked in pantry for the times I need a "nice" dessert & fast!

This was fantastic! I am not sure what would make it a perfect 5 star recipe, but it is definitely something I will make again. Maybe if it was entirely homemade or if it had some butter to give it a little more richness/depth? I agree with the other reviewer that said that the almond extract should not be omitted (even though it is $6 something for a little bottle). I debated leaving it out, but glad I included it. I made it in a bundt pan and think it ended up cooking for closer to 40 minutes.

We loved this!  It was so yummy.  I made just like it said but used a can of no sugar added cherry pie filling & reduced sugar chocolate cake mix with Splenda (trying to cut back on white sugar) and also when I made the icing I used 1/2 cup Splenda in place of the full cup of sugar and it was fine!  I also reduced the butter to 3 tbsp.  I also added a bit more almond flavoring. My mother who doesn't like ANYTHING lowcal or low sugar thought this was yummy too!  This is so moist and delicious!  Try it you'll love it!

I made this cake for my brother, whose favorite snack is chocolate covered cherries. He LOVED it. I only used about 2/3 of the sugar for the frosting, and it came out perfectly sweet. The can of cherries adds just an undertone of cherry flavor, and so I added some cored and chopped cherries on top of the cake. It was a total hit.

After reading all the rave reviews on this cake, I couldn't wait to make it.  I followed the recipe exactly and was so disappointed.  Not enough cherries to even taste them, cake was much too dry and there was way too much overly-sweet icing.  I left my cake in the 9X13 pan and iced it so I should have halved the icing recipe.  That would have been plenty.  I don't think I'll be making this one again.

This cake was moist and had a great taste! My dad is a chocolate covered cherry fan and I made this for his birthday. He loved it! I don't really care for a pronounced almond taste in this cake. I reduced the almond extract to 1/2 teaspoon and I could still taste it just fine! Hope this helps!

OK - we were FIGHTING over this cake. I served it to at a small dinner with friends and my family fought over the leftovers for the rest of the week (actually it didnt last that long).  It is soo good and yet so stupidly easy! The frosting is wonderful - I've made it since  - I put it on brownies, but it belongs on this cake - no comparison.

I loved the frosting.  The cake was good, not my absolute favorite, but good.  I love how easy it is to whip up.  I think I'd add a little less almond next time, I found that flavor a little too overwhelming.  I wonder if this recipe would work with other flavors of cake and pie fillings?  Might be worth a try...

I've made this cake a few times and it is WONDERFUL! I put a little rum extract in the cake and when I make the frosting I use a little more rum extract and some vanilla extract (about 1/2 tsp each).   Be careful when serving to men-it goes VERY quickly!

Unlike most of the reviews I read, I have to disagree about the frosting in this recipe. For me, it totally ruined the cake. The cake itself is delicious, but the frosting was overwhelmingly sweet. I'll make the cake again, but use a different frosting recipe. Sorry, the frosting is not for us, but love the cake!

Amazing.  I normally am the baker but do not eat alot of what I make.  I had two pieces and wanted more.  Thank you.  This will definitely be something I make frequently.  The frosting is a must.

I had my doubts when I saw how simple this recipe is, but WOW. I'm glad I tried it. Followed directions exactly, except added 2 Tbsp. maraschino cherry juice to the icing after removing from heat. Scrumptious.

The frosting made it super sweet. My husband liked it better with the frosting scraped off however, he did say the frosting added something to it that it was missing. These were very dense - brownie like in texture. The cake had a nice flavor.

This is one of the first recipes I learned to make as a teenager. It is so good, and I make it for every work/friend/church gathering I'm invited to! It always gets rave reviews. It is so easy! They only thing I do differently is add more chocolate chips in the icing. I add 1 whole bag, and it makes the icing almost like fudge. SO GOOD! I am a chocolate lover, and this cake never fails. It's best when it's cold and has been in the fridge for a day or two.

MMmm. The frosting is the best!!! You must use the frosting.  I am only giving 4 stars because I couldn't taste the almond extract in it. Maybe I didn't use enough? Next time I will try it with more.

YUM!  Got great reviews for this cake.  The only change I made was to add one teaspoon of veggie oil to the batter because it seemed a little too thick to me, and other reviewers had mentioned doing so.  The frosting, which was delish, was a little gritty, but no one complained because it was so darned good.  I will take more time next time to disolve the sugar better, maybe use a double boiler?  It was so easy and good, it will be a staple for me.  Thanks!

One of the best, quick and easy chocolate cakes I have ever made. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe, and requested a repeat performance. Only changes I made was to add 1/3 cup of oil. I Don't normally rate anything a 5, but this recipe is well deserving.

This recipe is so easy and it turns so good.  I used instead 21 onces of fresh sour cherries becuase it is its season.  It turned just great!  This one of my favorites now.

I'm sorry, I didn't think this cake was really anything special. I really didn't like the frosting. I think it made it WAY too rich. I think maybe a light dusting of powdered sugar would have been enough. I don't think I'd make this one again.

This is one fantastic dessert. I first had it in 1984 and crave it still. The frosting really adds the finishing touch.

This was fantastic.  I put half a cup of chocolate chips into the cake batter and topped the cake with chips as well.  I didn't use the icing but had whipped cream instead.  This cake was so moist and just perfect.

I really liked this, but I felt like the icing was too much. Next time I'll try without the icing.
Everyone at work loved it, though!

So easy to make and the kids loved.  Instead of making the frosting with this recipe, I made Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and it tasted wonderful with the cake.  A keeper for sure.

You can't get any simpler than this yummy cake. I did think the frosting was too much and I only made half. Next time I will leave it off entirely and just serve it with whipped cream. Thanks!

Very good! It tasted even better the next day. I added about a 1/4 cup of water to the cake batter because it seemed very thick like brownie mix and it came out perfect. I also topped it off with some maraschino cherries.

This was  really good considering how effortless it was!  I like the frosting.. we used all of it and it wasn't too rich for us!  Next time I may use a fudgier/darker cake mix, but it was good enough.  Think I'm going to go home for lunch today and grab a piece!

Excellent cake that has been a favorite in my family for years.  Easy, nice chocolate taste and it stays moist forever.  It tastes even better if you use a dark chocolate cake mix in place of devil's food.

Trusting ALL RECIPES and its users,I made 8 of this recipe for a Valentine dinner that my husbands youth group sponsored at our church.  I received rave reviews.  Several people asked for extras to take home, and others asked for the actual recipe.  I even had a few say "The was definately not a cake mix, you made these from scratch."  I quick note of advice....The first batch of icing that I made did not boil long enough and became gooey (the youth kids ate that one), the rest were boiled the correct amount of time and turned out wonderfully!!!!!  OH SO MOIST!!!!

This cake is unbelievable. It gets rave reviews and recipe requests everytime I make it. It is so moist and easy as can be. I just use a store bought chocolate frosting or decorators chocolate icing with it and it is great.This cake never lasts past the first day. Great cake to always keep ingredients on hand for.

This was delicious! My brother raved about it. I decided to use all of the icing, and I'm glad I did. I don't think half would have covered the cake. I'll definitely be making this again!

I'm gonna give this 5 stars as I think it would've been perfect if I hadn't goofed with it. Mainly, I took a reviewers suggestion about adding some extra liquid for moisture. I added about 1/8 cup of orange juice (as I had used orange extract, for want of almond or vanilla) but it never set in the center. I had intended on taking it for a church get together, but since it didn't turn out right - I never even bothered with the frosting. Made something else for church, and my family just snacked on this right out of the pan. Really was very moist and fruity! The orange flavor was quite good with the cherries too. But next time I'll follow the recipe correctly. It was just what I was looking for, something EASY, QUICK, DIFFERENT and TASTY! Can't wait to make it again.

This was indeed a rich, chocolately cake, but it was lacking a little in flavor.  I think the problem stemmed from the canned cherry filling.  I think next time I will make my own cherry filling.  I don't mind cake mixes at all, but I am not a fan of canned pie fillings.

This cake is a family favorite.  It's simple but tastes devine.  I substitute the almond extract with vanilla extract for family that's allergic.  Also can add a little cream to the batter to add some richness and help hide the cake mix taste.  Not necessary though!

This is SOOOO good!  I don't like milk-chocolate icing, so this chocolate-chip flavored icing was perfect.  The cherries were so good in the rich gooey cake... I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top for looks.  VERY yummy!

I have to give this recipe five stars for several reasons. #1: It exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting to like this cake very much because it contains cherry filling and I don't really care for cherry fillings in cakes or pies. However, I made this recipe for my husband. #2: This cake was so moist, it was just wonderful. After I mixed the ingredients, I thought it looked a little thick. So I added about 14 cup of milk to the mix. #3: This cake reminded me a bit of Texas sheet cake. But the cake has such a great texture. It's soft, almost chewy, yet moist. 

If you are looking for a mix that actually has a separate filling, then this is not for you. The filling becomes part of the batter which is unique. You can't really even tell there's cherry filling in it. For someone who doesn't like cherry filling, I REALLY enjoyed this cake. I was pleasantly surprised and I'll probably be making it again.

Mixed reviews on this one...  my family disliked it, but I brought some to work and to some relatives and they all loved it...unless they were fibbing.  It was a bit too rich for my liking.  Glad I tried it though...thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my husband's potluck without tasting it first. It got mixed reviews. He did not like the cherry/chocolate combo, but he's a picky eater. I thought it was good. Nice and moist, yummy icing. I'll make this again, I'll just have to eat it all myself!!

I made the recipe exactly as is, and it was so-o easy and yet delicious.  It is moist, and very rich and fudgy.  The cherries do not dominate the flavor, merely enhance it and provide a pleasant surprise as you bite in.  My husband loved it.

I can't find cherry pie filling (I live in Italy) so I tried with wild cherries under syrup, and it turned out great.

I made this recipe as written. The cake was moist and delicious. Surprisingly, just the right amount of cherry flavor without overwhelming the chocolate. The almond extract acted as an flavor enhancer. Really wonderful. While the texture of the icing was wonderful, it was a bit too sweet. I will try a ganache  on top next time. Will definitely make this again.

I made this cake the other day and was very pleased.  But next time I don’t think I will add this frosting. I felt it was a bit rich and the cake was moist enough without it.  But certainly the cake will be a redo again and again

I've made this cake a few times now!  It always turns out beautifully and I get a lot of compliments on it.  I find it helps to beat the eggs separately before adding them in. I also like it to be a little less sweet and more chocolatey, so I add a couple of tablespoons of cocoa to the dry mix.  For the icing, I like a thinner layer so it doesn't overwhelm the cake, so I reduce all the amounts by 1/3 or so and add a Tbsp of cocoa to that as well before stirring in the chocolate chips.

This cake was amazing! I had originally intended to bake it as a surprise birthday cake in a rose-shaped Bundt pan but it got stuck in the crevices of the pan (I blame this on the design of the pan, not the ingredients or directions) and I had to ditch that idea. Anyway I kept the salvageable chunks for myself and have been eating them like brownies -didn't bother with the frosting. I actually added an entire T. of almond extract and it wasn't overpowering at all. I will try this again using a boring old regular cake pan so I can share it with others.

This was surprisingly simple to make, and it was delicious! I have made this a couple times, most recently as a 2-layer cake, and I put a homemade cream cheese icing between the layers with a few maraschino cherries for garnish on top. Everyone commented on how pretty it was, as well as delicious, and several people said it reminded them of Black Forest cake. I think this cake will be a 'regular' in my cake recipe arsenal!

Simple and delicious. The cake and frosting both worked great for me. I actually used a 15oz cake mix, since that's what I had. It was great warm with ice cream, but also good the next day out of the fridge.

Made this as written except I added about 1/4c of canola oil and a tiny bit of water.  It was pretty good, but I thought the almond extract was a little overwhelming.  I may cut it down to 1/2 tsp - 3/4 tsp next time.  I think I may go with a fudge cake mix next time also to see if that helps it a little.  :-)

Wonderful cake!! Only change was adding about 1/4 cup oil and substituting almond extract with Amaretto. The glaze was perfect. It was a big hit with my three sons. I will definitely make it again.:)

This is a good chocolate cake! I love cherry pie filling in recipes! Also made the recipe with a white cake mix. Took some of both cakes to work and they loved it. More mentioned liking the white cherry cake.

One of my favorite cakes. I have made it at least a dozen times, and it never fails to impress. Easy and inexpensive to make. No one can guess it starts with a box mix. I leave it as is- and use either the  9 x 12 or a bundt pan if I want to go a little fancier. My mom's coming to dinner tonight, and I made it in less than an hour.

My mother has been making this cake since the mid 70's and it's fantastic. I like to do a mixture of semi sweet and milk chocolate for the frosting and cut the sugar back. Delish!

Delicious. If you are using organic eggs, such as EggLand's best, you need to add an extra egg. I did and the cake was perfect.

This is a great recipe and a family favorite as written,  however if you want it to send your family over the moon I suggest you use 4 eggs, a chocolate cake mix and bake it the day before and wrap it with plastic wrap and put in the fridge. DO NOT SKIP THE ALMOND EXTRACT!! It is a perfect addition! The icing the same day you are eating. I do have trouble with the icing. If I follow as written it ends up crystalizing.  I have to make sure the milk/sugar/butter mixture cools quite a bit before adding the chocolate chips. No one knows the cake is from a box!!

Everyone I have ever made this for loves this cake. I prefer to use a regular chocolate or fudge chocolate cake mix instead of the devils food mix though. I microwave the chocolate chips for the frosting/ganache for 1 minute to make it easier to mix them in.

The cake was delicious!  The icing, too much chocolate for me.  I will make it again and dust it with powdered sugar.  I think then it will be 5 stars!

This is the same recipe my mom has been using for years to make her signature Chocolate Cherry Cake!  Her specific recipe calls for Betty Crocker Fudge Cake Mix but that is the only difference.  I have always loved this cake- the frosting/icing really makes this a very delicious cake!  Serve cold!!!

I made this cake in a 13x9" pan and made some slits in it before pouring the icing over the top.  OH MY GOSH!!!  You must do this!  Make slits or poke holes before icing allows the chocolatey goodness soaks into the cake which makes it even more moist, gooey, and delicious!

Delicious! I used frozen sweet cherries, making my own pie filling, and used milk chocolate cake mix. I found the chocolate topping a bit sweet, but overall very yummy especially with a scoop of ice-cream!

It's awesome, and so easy to make!  I used chocolate fudge cake mix, and added a splash of almond extract and a little bit of cinnamon to the icing for a zing.  I made it 5 days ago, and it's still moist and flavorful!

YUM!!! I think I overcooked the icing a bit, however. I don't think you should try to let it come to a boil- just simmer for 2 minutes. (When I tried to spread the icing, it was already setting up like fudge & was difficult to spread over the whole cake.) That said, it was wonderful!!! NOTE: made this again recently. Tried blending the cherry pie filling, eggs, & extract first (in my blender)- then mixing that into the cake mix. Worked great! This time I did not cook the icing long enough!!! (go figure) But STILL yum........

This cake was very rich and fudgy and turned out to be surprisingly very lite. I love cherries and chocolate but if you are worried about trying the two together- the cherries are not at all over powering. The frosting was wonderful and I plan on using it on other deserts as well.

This is an amazing cake. I am a huge fan of homemade cakes, but made this in a pinch (based on an ingredient search for what I had on hand). The texture was velvety and the flavor impressed this baker BIG TIME. (It was even better the next day.)

This is the absolute best.   Lasted less than 2 days at my house.   The frosting is to die for.  I will be using it on other cakes.
