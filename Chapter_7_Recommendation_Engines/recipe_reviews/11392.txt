Not the prettiest cookie ever (kind of anemic looking and the white chocolate chips started to turn color), but they had a lot of potential, so I made them more eye appealing and gave them a boost of orange flavor at the same time by drizzling on a glaze of powdered sugar, fresh orange juice and zest.  That glaze took these over the top to something outrageously delicious - buttery, creamy with white chocolate, unmistakably orange and very rich.  A thick, soft and tender cookie.  Adding orange extract as some others have is NOT necessary. Adding the fresh orange glaze, on the other hand, is.  Mmmmmm.

These cookies didn't have nearly enough orange flavor.  Even after I added an 1 tablespoon of orange extract, they weren't orange-y enough.  Since they aren't a very sweet cookie, either, I glazed them with some orange glaze.  With the glaze they were pretty fantastic.

Great recipe, but I used three tbsp of orange zest and added one tbsp of orange extract. They tasted great, and the orange wasn't overwhelming at all.

These are tasty! I made exactly as written except using a bit more orange zest. I also made a glaze and drizzled it over the top by combining powdered sugar and orange juice till it reached a good consistency.

I have been making this cookie for years except in my recipe I melt 1/4 cup of chocolate chips in a heavy duty zip bag, snip off a tiny corner of the bag and pipe the melted chocolate straight across and then I do the same with white chocolate chips and pipe it across in the opposite direction.  Let the cookie set until the chocolate firms up.  It makes them look pretty and adds another layer of flavor.  My friend always brought these to a cookie swap at church and when she moved to Florida we wouldn't let her leave until she gave out the recipe.  I hope this helps with the people who said the cookies were anemic or plain.

Absolutely wonderful! They're light and orangy--perfect for Beltaine, or even in the middle of winter if you want a nice sunny-tasting cookie!

I want to buy a cookie jar just so I can fill it full of these.

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe and I have to say that I am madly in love with these cookies. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and substituted 1 tbps orange flavoring for the vanilla. The dough was incredibly dry after adding all the flour, so I also added 2 tbsp milk just to give it enough moisture to be able to incorporate the white chocolate chips. I also added 1/2 cup of chipped walnuts.

Very yummy.  I was afraid of them not being orange-y enough based on the reviews so I zested two whole oranges and squeezed the juice out of one of the oranges into the wet mix before I added it to the dry.  I also used a full cup of white chocolate chips.  They came out perfect.  Next time I might try dark chocolate chips!

These cookies were exceptional to make and the orange flavoring hit the spot. I had trouble grating the orange zest (I don't have a fine grater) so I grated what I could and used a dash of orange extract. 
   The cookies were beautifully puffed, light, zesty and the white chocolate chips were heavenly. Thanks for such a great recipe!!

This cookie has a great texture to it, but I was disappointed with the lack of orange flavor, even after adding an extra tablespoon of orange zest.  After re-reading others' comments, I realize that fresh orange zest is needed in this recipe (I used dried zest I had in my cupboard from a bread recipe).  I managed to "up" the orange oomph I wanted with an orange glaze as others had suggested.

If I make these again, I will probably use the extra tablespoon of (fresh) zest, and add the orange extract some have suggested.

I love these cookies! I make them a little bit large and they end up having a shortbread-like consistency. I've made them both ways (with orange zest one time and then another time with orange extract) and they turned out fabulous. Great recipe!

This is a really great cookie, the orange flavor paired with the white chocolate is a nice change from the ordinary chocolate chip or white chocolate/macadamia nut cookie.  I'd recommend adding an additional tbsp of fresh orange zest, and cutting back on the sugar to 1 cup.  These took 14 minutes at 350 in my oven, and my family couldn't stop eating them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

I add another table spoon of orange zest, use 1/2 cup of Xylitol for the sugar with 1/4 tsp powdered stevia and it lowers the glycemic index, plus the calories!  I like my cookies with nuts, so I add 1/2 cup chopped, toasted pecans and these are wonderful.

This recipe is a winner! No changes--I don't think it needs orange extract at all. I grated the zest from about 2 oranges and they were orangie delicious!

Unbelievable cookies!  My family devoured them.  I did at 1 tb of orange extract and put a whole cup of white chocolate chips in.  Don't cook them for more than 12 minutes, they may be soft but will set after a few minutes.  The glaze is a must.  Mix a couple of tb's of orange juice with confectioners sugar.  Make it really thick and transfer into a small ziploc bag.  Make the tiniest hole in the corner and glaze the cookies.  That's how you get white looking professional glaze.

Instead of vanilla, I used orange extract - I also increased the orange zest to 3 Tablespoons.  Out of the 9 cookies I made for Christmas, these were rated #1.

I love this recipe but I altered it for Lemon instead by using lemon zest instead of orange, and adding a little lemon juice to the eggs before mixing them in, and added an extra 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips... I've also made a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice and then topped with shaved white chocolate.  My friend says these are "Oh My Gosh I would forsake all other cookies for these" good.

These cookies were delicious!!  I didn't see a need for a glaze because I don't like my cookies too sweet.  They were perfect !  The only thing I did differently was to add some orange juice because I didn't have quite enough zest.  Great recipe!!

I made these cookies today. They were good. I felt that they did lack orange flavor, even with doubling up on the orange zest. I would add some orange extract and decrease the sugar a bit as they were really sweet for me, next time. These cookies were nice and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and would go great with a nice cup of tea! All in all, good cookies, just needs a bit more orange flavor.

I made these with orange glazing since I was going for quite an orange-y flavour, and by themselves I, like others before me, found they had too subtle a taste. With glazing, I found them okay, definitely enjoyable if you just need something to go with a cup of coffee or tea, but not amazing. I was disappointed that I didn't taste the white chocolate at all.

I tried it, but I had no orange zest. So I replace the quantity written for zest with cinnamon and added more chocolate chips.
I also added 3 tablespoons of milk, since the final dough lacked moisture.
Very good recipe; simple and short and sweet. Just like beginners like me need.

I didn't change the recipe at all, except to add orange glaze. I refrigerated half of the dough in rolls to cut and bake later. Everyone loved it.

as is, 3 stars. I added more zest and white chocolate chips, almost doubling quantity AFTER trying original recipe. I also added orange juice from the fruit I was zesting since the batter was sooooo thick and somewhat difficult to manipulate. After sampling the baked product, I followed some reviewers' advice and mixed up a glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice and a dash of vanilla extract to top the cookies. I used this to frost 1/2 the cookies lightly.  I melted 1/2 cup white chocolate chips in a bowl in microwave and mixed in a drop of red food coloring and a drop of yellow, drizzling over the other 1/2 of the cookies...all were gobbled up. :)

They tasted great right out of the oven because they were warm and chewy. I used 1 tablespoon of orange extract since i didnt have orange zest and it tasted very good with the perfect hint of orange. Maybe next time i make them i will use more. Thanks for the recipe!
