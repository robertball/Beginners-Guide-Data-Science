I've made this twice now.  The first time that I had it, it was too runny and you couldn't taste any pepperoni.  The second time I made it, I left out the water to make it thicker, and I increased the amount of pepperoni to about 5oz.  I also halved the pepperoni instead of quartering it for bigger bites.  Both times, I cooked it in the crock pot.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It's not a bad basic chili.  My first comment would be that it shouldn't be considered "pepperoni" chili because I didn't taste a single pepperoni flavor at all. I agree with the last reviewer that it was a little thin, but I bet with some tomato paste, it would thicken up.  However, I strongly disagree with the last reviewer in that it was not spicy AT ALL.  Overall, it was good, flavorful, and I would probably make it again if I wanted a basic chili.  If you want a pepperoni flavor, then you definitely need to modify this recipe.

I liked the idea of pepperoni in chili but the sauce was really thin and very spicy I couldnt even eat it.  I had to try to salvage it the following day by adding 2 more cans of beans, some corn, and zuchini. It actually turned out much better. This may work as a base recipe but it wasnt for us as is.

This is a chili that my whole family liked, I used traditional spaghetti sauce, fresh mushrooms and a little more chili powder. Simply because that's what I like I also used deli pepperoni which has a much more spicy flavor which I think makes a big difference.  I asked for 3/4 of an inch slice and chopped it up myself into small bite size pieces.  I have used this recipe with beef, turkey and pork, they are all great. This has replaced my traditional easy chili recipe.
