Easy and very tasty.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Recommend spiralized zuchini as a side!

I used an onion and green/red pepper blend. It actually works. I was skepical about this with the honey but did it pretty much as  written. I would make this again when wanting a change from pan frying. The fish stayed nice and moist with good flavour.

We received a large bag of fresh walleye from a friend.  Our family preferred this recipe to the others we tried.  I cooked this in a cast iron skillet in the oven.  I served saut√©ed onions on the side as not everyone likes them.  Next time I think I will dice all the bacon, even that that goes under the fish.  We thought the honey, bacon, and onion flavors really flattered the fish.

This is the best recipe for walleye that I've had. We always have plenty of walleye & got bored with same old recipe. This one beats them all!  Love it & don't change a thing.
