If you like oysters, this is the bomb. My family always request this when I make dressing. I cut up my oysters with a scissors so they are not so big. I usually have to use canned oysters in this as we do not get fresh oysters in our area very often. I do not use 2 pkg. of sausage as that is too much for us but otherwise, I do follow the recipe. If using unseasoned bread crumbs, I add 1 teaspoon of sage OR poultry seasoning. If I have fresh sage I use a tablespoon of diced fresh sage instead of dry. When making dressing I make an oyster dressing and also a plain dressing without the oysters for those that do not like oysters. You can use the same recipe and leave out the oysters. Very good stuffing.

This recipe is so simple and so incredibly tasty. I used 2x the amount of oysters and kept the oysters whole (another review suggests cutting them up). The flavor for the dish comes from the oysters, oyster liquid, chicken stock and the hot sausage, so be sure to select the hot sausage to your taste. I used Bob Evans zesty hot Italian sausage.

If doubling the amount of oysters used in this recipe, would you use the liquid from BOTH of the oyster containers, or just from one? Thanks, in advance.
