Delicious!!  My kids 10 and 7 both gave it 5 stars.  Very yummy!  In the future, I'd add a little more sausage... otherwise, perfection!

This is a simple, solid recipe that is very easy to prepare and makes a beautiful presentation.  My only change was to use bulk Italian sausage in place of link.  Thanks, tipsuda!

We really enjoyed this. I used whole wheat pasta, grape tomatoes and added a cup of pasta water, per Rachel Ray, because of the whole wheat pasta.  The next day I added a touch of jarred Alfredo sauce to the leftovers and again delicious.

Hubby and I really liked this! I used Miracle Noodles (shirataki noodles - to cut down on carbs) instead of regular noodles and canned tomatoes (all I had on hand).  Although not carb free (garlic, tomatoes, etc.), this was a delicious and satisfying dinner.

This was awesome! 5 stars! I like everything with bold seasoning so I doubled the garlic salt and pepper and also liberally "sprinkled" with Parmesan.

I took the sausage out of the casing before cooking it.  Browned it and made it into little chunks.  Used penne pasta.  Delish!

Great recipe,  my  wife usually prefers pasta with a lot of sauce but she gave 2 thumbs up on this one.  Only change was using a BGe to cook the sausage so I had a bit of smoke flavour, will make this again for sure!

Delish! Used two links of chicken sausage to lighten it up but otherwise perfect meal! Family (including 7 year old) scarfed it. Thanks for ideas to cook our local fresh veggies!

We made this on the grill. I put precooked, sliced, sundried tomato/basil chicken sausage in a foil pack with the garlic, asparagus, black pepper and a pinch of kosher salt(I don't use garlic salt). I do not like cooked tomato so I left that out and added it to the pasta after draining and then topped with the rest. This was easy and flavorful. I also used bowties instead of spaghettini

We cut the quantity down to two and used prepared pork meatballs to cut down on preparation time.  I was surprised at the perfection of the seasonings.  Just enough garlic, the right amount of tomato so it wasn't dry but also didn't have a runny sauce.  We'll definitely have it again during asparagus season!

mmm... My husband and I love this.  To the point where I signed up for an AR account just so I could give it five stars.  I used fresh asparagus from a local farm and hot Italian sausage from another local farm where I know their animals live a good life.  I like the health benefits of coconut oil, so used half coconut oil, half olive oil... didn't taste coconutty.  The Italian sausage and the cheese give this dish PLENTY of salt, so I didn't add salt to the pasta water or garlic salt.
