This recipe is awesome. The part I like about it best is that I was easily able to convert it to a low carb version for my diabetic father by substituting the whipped topping with lite cool whip and the gelatin with sugar-free jello... and better yet, it still tastes good and is very satisfying!

I'll definitely be sharing this with others!

I came across a similar recipe.  After you dissolve the jello, whip in an 8 oz. pkg. of cream chease (take awhile to become creamy).  Then add the cool whip.  This is very creamy and smooth.

This recipe is definitely easy and I like that you can make it  with sugar-free Jell-o.  However, the texture is exactly what you'd expect jello-o and cool whip to be.  Also, the lemon flavor is not that strong.  To make this recipe a little more appealing I added 1 tsp lemon zest, the juice of 1 lemon & 1 package of cream cheese.  This gives it a smoother texture and the little extra lemon kick it lacked.

I've done this recipe a few times with some variations. Adding a little lemon juice for lemon, a little margarita mix to a lime one.

The key to this recipe though is how and when you blend it. The first time I made it I just used a spatula and mixed the whipped topping in to the mostly cooled jello until it melted together. The pie was great. Creamy.

The third time I made it I was in a hurry and I used my electric mixer for several minutes, the jello was not cooled enough and voila it was gelatinous and not very good. 

So important: let the jello cool before adding the whipped topping and don't go overboard with the mixing or you will get a rubber pie.

This recipe was super easy and tasted ok, but basically amounted to flavored cool whip with a crust.  I think next time I'll add some cream to make it a bit thicker.  I did love how easy this pie was to reduce the calories in though!

This recipe is delicious!  I made this today at (5:00pm), the only reason it lasted till now (8:15pm) is it had to set in the fridge!  I made the lemon..I think the lime is next!  Strawberry/banana would be good too!  Enjoy!

I think there is something wrong with the recipe since 3oz of Gelatin is ALOT! I tried it with 2 oz (8 x 0.25 oz packets) and it came out like gummy candy. Please tell me its 0.3 oz, I see the potential of the recipe i juts want to make it right!

This recipe is extremely easy and it is so delicious! I made mini ones and added a few thawed out frozen blackberries to them after they set up. We loved them!

This is really good and really really easy to make!  I used lite cool whip.  I like how this recipe can be adapted to any flavor of jello mix.  I used the Fruit Fiesta flavor and would like to try it with other ones in the future.

This is REALLY sweet.  It was a little too sweet for our tastes, so I'll keep looking.  Thank you, though, for a fun recipe to make!  :-)

It was OK for the 5 minutes it took to make this, but as noted by someone else, it tastes like what it is-- whipped topping and jello.  This is good for the kids I think, not forever making something that is  gone in 3 minutes.

I liked this pie, only I made mine raspberry. But I think the better half of the Jello mix went in first because it was really...gelatine-y. I didn't care that much for it, but my family and friends devoured it.
