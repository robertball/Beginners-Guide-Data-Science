This was my first attempt at a cream pie, and I flopped.  I only cooked the butterscotch mixture until it began to thicken, thinking that it would thicken even more as it baked in the oven.  Wrong!  We "drank" this pie!  But, surprisingly, it still tasted great, and next time I'll know to cook it until very thick.

My family and I rate this recipe a 10!  My grandmother used to make an awesome Butterscotch Pie & for years I've been looking for a recipe just like hers.  This recipe is perfect and tastes just like Grandma's.  The only suggestion I have is to omit the vanilla extract from the meringue. It makes it lose its stiffness and peaks.

Delicious! A beautiful butterscotch pudding makes for a rich, tasty pie. I didn't cook the custard quite long enough....make sure you cook it until it's really thick.

Great recipe Debbie! I have a tried and true recipe for Butterscotch Pie, passed down from my great-grandmother but I wanted to try this one because it uses cornstarch (mine uses lots of flour). The taste, texture, and color are fantastic. However, my meringue seperated from the filling, as stated by previous reviewers. I made sure to seal the meringue right to the edges of the pie crust but the meringue still slides right off the pie when I slice it. But for that, I would have gladly given this a 5-star rating. It tastes divine.

I have finally found a butterscotch pie recipe that I love.  Very easy to make.  I used less sugar in the filling and meringue.  It turned out lovely.

My mother makes herself a butterscotch cream pie every year for her birthday and this last year I decided to do it for her.  She was so impressed with the way this turned out.  She has always used a recipe found in an old cookbook that requires tons of stirring and the use of flour.  She couldn't believe it when I told her how easy this was and that I'd used cornstarch!  Will definately make again and thanks for giving my mom a new recipe for an old favorite!

I'm not sure what happened, but after cooking this for nearly TWO HOURS, it still had not thickened.  I added more cornstarch, which made it taste grainy - so don't try that. I poured it into the shell and allowed it to cool hoping it would thicken.  It didn't - so don't try that, either. I see that lots of others had success with this recipe, so I'm not sure what the deal was.  I did, however, throw the whole thing out.

Excellent, cooked the filling in the microwave and it was ready in no time! Be sure and whisk frequently. Not overly sweet as some of the other recipes here.

This recipe is apparantly not for the novice.  It was my first attempt at a butterscotch pie and I wasn't sure just how thick this was supposed to be cooked before filling the pie shell.  This ran like the Bulls of Pamplona on me, but tasted pretty good just the same.  The meringue was great.  I'll try this again, but will cook it a little longer next time.

This is the first Butterscotch pie I have ever tasted let alone made so I was not sure what to expect. It turned out very good & the person I made it for loved it. It was not difficult at all. used pillsbury crusts sprinkled with sugar. Made it 2 more times since.

I added 1/4 t. butter extract and the family loved it!  You'll know when the pudding is cooked enough when the foam disappears and it becomes a peanut butter consistency.

I work at a pie shop, we tried this pie yesterday.  Great reviews.  Wonderful, silky flavor.  Changes made:  3/4 cup sugar only - equal parts of light and dk. brown sugar. I didn't use a double boiler - made it like a cream pie - constantly stirring in a heavy sauce pan. If you like butterscotch you're going to enjoy this pie.

Very yummy-creamy-good, my first meringue and it turned out beautifully. My only complaint is that the filling did not taste as butter-scotchey as I would have liked. I would make this again using a dark brown sugar instead of the light that I had on hand and I would add a little more butter.

Made this lastnight for my father inlaws birthday, right before he tried it he was telling me how many people have made him butterscotch pie and either it was sweet enough or the taste was off so I was a little afraid to have him try this.  He LOVED it. I LOVED IT!! sent the pie home with him and made one for me the next day!! Wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you so much for this recipe. :)

My dad requested this pie for Easter. I've never made one, but this recipe is the BOMB! I used 1 1/4c dark brown sugar rather than what this recipe calls for & stirred it in a regular pot on the stove, not a double boiler. I put a meringue on top. The consistancy was perfect, like pudding but not runny at all.

I have made this a couple of times trying to overcome it separating from the edge but no matter what I try...it still does. I enjoy this pie (I'm a big butterscotch lover) but noone else cared for it much.

This makes a beautiful and wonderful pie.  The filling thickened perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only thing I changed was that I cooked the filling in the microwave as I do all my creme type pies.  Cook the mixture at ALMOST full power for a few short minutes, but, be sure to stir quite often so that it will mix well as it cooks.  Delicious pie.  Thanks!

This is my first attempt at Butterscotch Pie.  After cooling, it did not congeal like I had hoped.  Also, I would have liked a stronger butterscotch flavor.  I will probably try some of the other Butterscotch Pie recipe's before trying this one again.

Butterscotch is my husbands favorite flavor, and I love almost anything with meringue, so I was eager to try this recipe for our anniversary. I skipped the time consuming double boiler method and used my microwave for the filling, stirring every 2 minutes. This produced a nice thick filling. I did add a scant half teaspoon of salt to the filling.  Very nice pie.

Turned out pretty good.  Filling got really watery after I refrigerated it.  I will try it again.  I really liked the meringue on top, and it tasted good.

This pie was unbelievably good! I made the filling on the stovetop and made sure to boil it for approx. 5 mins- and the filling once set - turned out amazing! I omitted the vanilla from the meringue- but other than that - kept the recipe as is. My whole family loved this pie- my husband and son couldn't stop raving about it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe Debbie.

This recipe is very good very much like my Mom's that she made from scratch.  I also didn't use a double broiler, just have to stir good.  My husband's favorite is butterscotch-he loved it.  The only change I would is decrease sugar a little just a little too sweet.

This was my first ever butterscotch pie but was also my first pudding pie from scratch. It was really tasty. My husband really liked it as well as my father-in-law. The pudding was not as set as I would have liked so next time I make it I will cook it longer.

This butterscotch pie is wonderful. I had looked for a few years for a butterscotch pie recipe like what my Grandmother used to make and then I found this one!  She was from Ohio and made this pie for every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I am thankful to have found this to share with my family since they never had a chance to taste her pie.

Phew,  finally finished making this pie.  After reading all of the reviews and people saying that you need to cook the filling until it's really thick.  Well that took about 1 hour of stirring.  We had to take turns stirring because of hand cramps.The problem is nobody tells us how thick it needs to be.  So I guessed.  So hopefully it will be thick enough.  I omitted the cream of tartar.  Didn't think it was necessary. And added only 1/4 tsp of vanilla since someone in the review said it made their egg whites runny.  It looks great.  But unfortunately we will never get to taste it.  It will be entered in a country fair.  So fingers crossed that it doesn't ooze when the judges cut it.

Phew,  finally finished making this pie.  After reading all of the reviews and people saying that you need to cook the filling until it's really thick.  Well that took about 1 hour of stirring.  We had to take turns stirring because of hand cramps.The problem is nobody tells us how thick it needs to be.  So I guessed.  So hopefully it will be thick enough.  I omitted the cream of tartar.  Didn't think it was necessary. And added only 1/4 tsp of vanilla since someone in the review said it made their egg whites runny.  It looks great.  But unfortunately we will never get to taste it.  It will be entered in a country fair.  So fingers crossed that it doesn't ooze when the judges cut it.

I make this pie for my husband who has always loved his grandma's butterscotch pie. He raves over this pie and ask for it whenever we need to make a dessert. The first time i made it, i used a double broiler but it didn't thicken after a long time on the stove. So now I just put the ingredients in one pot and heat it slowly on med/ low, stirring constantly, and gradually increase the temp little amounts until it thickens. Works like a charm and tastes great. Because I'm lazy, I don't make the meringue and just serve with ice cream or whipped cream!

Great recipe! I think it's helpful to know that the custard needs to thicken up A LOT before you take it off the stove.  Someone described it as "Peanut Buttery" and that's pretty close (though not really quite that thick). Or like almost the consistency of sour cream. It will not get much thicker in the oven: that's really just to brown the meringue. I used a homemade chocolate graham cracker crust, added a layer of chocolate pudding over the butterscotch, and then used two envelopes of "Dream Whip" on top with a sprinkling of cocoa powder. (Not a meringue fan myself.) Put it in the fridge overnight. It didn't last past one day in my house.

It's a tasty butterscotch pie, maybe a little sweet for me, but it is probably supposed to be.  This was a great recipe, and worth trying for sure.

As many reviewers commented, this pie came out a little bit sweet and runny. I even knew ahead of time about this, and tried to cook it longer. When it suddenly thickened I expected success... but it was the consistency of pudding. We all still enjoyed it though.

This was the third cream pie I made. My Caramel was perfect, my lemon sublime, and then I tried this.  I did not care for this.  After cooking 45 minutes, it was still runny.  I hoped it would thicken as it cooled -- it didn't.  In addition to the runny texture, it was too sweet for my taste.

Whoa!  The pie was awfully sweet!  It was fun to try, but probably won't be trying this one again.  It would probably be really good with about half the sugar though.

This was my first time ever making a Butterscoth Pie. As a child I remember my mother making them every Thanksgiving and Christmas. She passed away long ago, so I wanted to try this out for Thanksgiving. My test pie turned out wonderful. I made sure to stir till it was THICKER than pudding like the other reviewers reccomended. It turned out fantastic. The only thing I did't like was the taste of the meringue. It was a little off, I'm not sure why. Other than that, it was perfect! Will make more in a few days for Thanksgiving!

This was my first attempt at a butterscotch pie. Everyone loved it, but I had problems with the cooking. I cooked the mixture with a double broiler for 45 minutes and it never thickened. I poured it into another sauce pan, turned the heat to high, stirring constantly, allowed it to boil and it thickened almost instantly.  Next time i will temper the eggs and then cook at a highter heat.

WOW...This is a good pie. It's very sweet though, so you'll only need a small piece. It's great with a cup of coffee.

The flavour of this pie was really authentic, and the meringue turned out well.  My only complaint is that after the finished pie came out of the oven, the filling began to seperate.  Next time, I will not add the 2 tablespoons of butter, and that should fix the problem.  The filling thickened up really well, and had it not seperated, it would have cut really well too.
