I rated it 5 stars because I hate when someone changes a recipe and then gives it a low rating.  I changed this recipe,  so the 5 star rating is because it is a good "starting" point, and this recipe can be changed to taste.  I added two packs of taco seasoning,  I doubled the cheese and added it after I cooked the beef and rice.  I also added a full can of corn, a 16 oz can of refried beans and a 16 oz can of diced tomatoes.   It tastes just like Taco Bell's Southwest bowl, and you could also make this using shredded chicken breast.  My husband had this mixture rolled up inside a burrito shell, and I topped mine with lettuce, sour cream and more cheddar.  It made a TON, and I will freeze the leftovers so we can have quick burritos in a few weeks.  We really enjoyed this.  : )

This was a nice change. I added a can of diced tomatoes, some corn, and a can of black beans to make in more filling. Both the kids and husband enjoyed it.

This recipe is an excellent base and you can go almost anywhere with it. I changed a few things to make it suit my husband and my tastes. As my husband is a vegetarian, we used veggie mince instead of ground beef. I cooked this is a packet of taco seasoning mix to give it added flavor. I used 3 cups of rice instead of 2 and waited until the rice was cooked before I added the cheese. I also added about a half a can of corn and a small can of sliced black olives. I added some medium salsa as well to brighten it up. It was great with tortilla chips! So easy! Will add this to our dinner rotation!!

Primo.  For a one-pan dinner in 15 minutes, this recipe is hard to beat.  I took some of the advise offered by other raters and jazzed it up with onions, black beans, salsa and a dab of sour cream.

This was super good and easy. My kids loved it wrapped in tortillas liked a burrito. And the adults liked it over lettuce. I used slow cooking rice and cooked it in my rice cooker first, and then added it to the ground beef and it was great.

This is really good.  I used brown rice instead of white. One large onion and 3 cloves of garlic were also added. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I added a can of diced tomatoes. We were out of lettuce, so I threw in a hand full of frozen peas, for color. Water chestnuts might also be good in this dish. It's just something different than the same old meat and noodles casserole.
My husband liked it wrapped in a tortilla.

We tried this recipe out while camping. We liked it so much that we ate it for dinner two nights in a row! The hardest part was keeping a head of lettuce from freezing and getting slimy in the cooler. We put it in the drink cooler in a ziploc bag inside of a large brown bag and kept it from touching any ice. It stayed good until we got home.
I tore up some iceberg lettuce and diced a tomato. We also added some doritos. We put some lettuce in the bottom of our bowls, added the recipe mixture and the topped with more lettuce, tomato, Doritos, and some ranch veggie dip we had on hand. 
This was so yummy and is a new favorite camp food. Thanks for an awesome, simple to make recipe!!

This recipe is quick.  This recipe is versatile.  Both are huge attributes in my book.  Some of us ate this with tortilla chips, others rolled up some in a tortilla.  Both ways were great.  And this recipe really was done in about 15 minutes.  If you have already cooked ground beef, it would be even faster, so this is perfect for those busy weeknights.

WOW!!!  This is SOOOOO easy and quick.  I used green onion instead of lettuce and quartered cherry tomatoes.  I served it with a small amount of restaurant style sour cream. It was delicious.  My husband just loved it!  This will be a repeat meal for sure.  Great for busy families.

Just made this! I didn't have 2 cups of rice, though, only one... so... I used less water and I added a can of black beans to it and I wrapped them in tortillas! Yummo!

I made this as written and served it in lettuce bowls and a dollop of sour cream, and while it was very good I was surprised it that was a little bland.  I think it has to do with the amount of rice in the dish.  But it's quick and easy and to make so I will definitely make it again and will add more seasonings, and if making it just for myself I'll add some corn (hubby doesn't like it).

Good and fast!  Easy to adapt.  Great in soft or hard shell taco or put on top of greens for a fresh taco salad.  Great for a busy weeknight.

I made this according to the directions, and I thought it was pretty bland as is. Definitely needed to doctor it up. I added more taco seasoning, some minced onion, a can of black beans, a can of corn, and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes as I didn't have any fresh. Even then, it was just ok. My husband thought it was alright, but I probably won't be making again.
*Updated: Ended up putting the leftovers in tortillas for lunch the next day, and it was MUCH better after the flavors blended overnight.  I would make it again, but not eat it until the next day. It went from 1 star to 4 in my book!

I put the tomatoes into the meat and water and cooked them, my family doesn't like raw tomatoes. Everyone enjoyed it. My boyfriend told me next time to double it up so he can have leftovers. I used the taco seasoning from this site. We topped with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream.

I've been making this for years. I drain and measure the liquid from a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and use it as part of the water. Then add the diced tomatoes, instead of cutting up a fresh tomato, especially during the winter. I've also drained and rinsed a can of black beans and added that too! I serve mine with sour cream and Frito's!

Everyone loved this one.  Had extra toppings at the table so that people could add as they chose (i.e. black olives, peppers, sour cream, avocado, salsa).

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was quick and simple. One thing I would change about it, since you add the two cups of rice, instead of just one package of taco seasoning, maybe try one and a half or two. That would be PERFECT! I also had it in a tortilla! Makes a hearty burrito!

This is definitely a keeper. So many possibilities! I diced an onion and shallot and cooked it with the beef, then had tortillas, pinto beans, salsa, lettuce and tomatoes to top it or to make tacos. Fast and easy which is also a plus. Thank you

I am not a "make it up as I go cook".   I need a template to work from and this was perfect for my ability.  I added onion and garlic when I browned my meat, extra taco seasoning and used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I aso added a little bit of cumin.  I have to cook a day or two ahead as my hubby works afternoon shift, and this was a perfect quick thing to toss together for tomorrow.  I'll send his with lettuce, black olive, salsa and cheese on the side.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe as is with the exception of adding a can of drained, rinsed pinto beans. My whole family, including a two and three year old, loved it! Definitely, this recipe will be going on my regular menu.

It was nothing special. I ended up adding some black beans, corn, and jalpenos to try and spice it up. The BF liked it well enough. Not something I would make again.

Tried this lastnight.  I followed other review requests and added black beans and a can of diced tomatoes.  It was very good.  I had to add extra water and it could have used a little more taco seasoning.  We topped it with sour cream and salsa.  Yummy.  My husband thought it would be good wrapped in a tortilla (like chipotle).

I had all the ingredients and it was quick to make, so I did.  The only thing I did differently was add a little minced garlic and some onion to the ground beef, then I added a can of black beans after the rice was cooked along with the cheese.  We ate it on tortillas with sour cream and quacamole and it was pretty good.  Leftovers made a good taco salad.  Just chopped up lettuce and garnished with more tomatoes and tortilla chips and salsa....pleasantly surprised.

This is a great recipe!  I was shocked at how easy it was to make and how good it turned out.  Also, the possibilities are endless with it.

This looks great I usually make enough brown rice for two meals.  This would make a great way to reuse the second half of rice.  I'm going to use some shredded chicken this time around but I don't see why you can't use pork either. My husband only likes cooked tomatoes so I'll use canned for speed.

Very easy and tasty! I used ground turkey and brown rice to make a healthy version.  This recipe also made extra to take for lunch!

I made the recipe as written except I used Minute brown rice since that's what I had in my pantry and a homemade taco seasoning mix (one packet equivalent).  I increased the simmering time to 10 minutes.  I topped with lettuce and tomato and added a few other taco toppings.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it was missing something.  I'll definitely be making this again, but I think next time I'll try adding about half a can of condensed nacho cheese soup and maybe some salsa before simmering so it comes out a little creamier with a little more zip and save the shredded cheese for topping at the end.

I love it! I make it often, I do find that adding one package of taco mix when putting the rice in, as well as one package when adding the corn and beans at the end makes it taste best! I also had to add more water than the recipe indicated. Its a great recipe!!

The only thing I changed about the original recipe is that after browning the beef...I drained it using a colander.  While it was draining, I sautéed some onions...then returned beef to pot and added only 1 3/4 cups water and the taco seasoning mix.  I didn't have minute rice on hand, so I steamed my rice separately and then added it back into the beef mixture at the end.  That's why I only used a part of the water the recipe calls for...the rest was in the rice.

My take...it had a good flavor...but not really a taco flavor...more of a burrito flavoring.  So I stuffed flour tortillas with this beef and rice mixture, added some shredded cheddar and a squirt of taco sauce.  Rolled them up, placed in a baking dish side by side, added more shredded cheddar on top as well as more taco sauce.  Baked in a 350 degrees F oven, covered with foil, for 30 min...removed foil and baked for 5 min more.

Wish I had thought about the black beans...that would have been good as well.  This is the type of recipe I like to think of as a base recipe...meant for you to play with and add to in order to achieve something wonderful. By itself...it's just a little too bland.

Wonderful!

Our family of 8 loved it!! Ages of kids are 16, 15, 13, 7, 6, 2. The only one who didn't want it was our 2 year old. We will definitely make again! Only difference is a few of us added sour cream.

My daughter recommended this to me fir an easy supper. Her 4 year old loves and takes left overs for lunch next day. It's not something I would usually try but I thought why nit. Although I added Black Beans too but otherwise it was - Easy peasy and delicious too. What more can one ask for on a Saturday Evening for Hockey Night in Canada.

This is dish really good and I highly recommend it!
I ended up altering it to fit what I had on hand... here's what I changed. I used 1 cup of White Rice and 1 cup of Spanish Rice and instead of sprinkling the cheese on top of the meat in the dish I stirred it in. It made it a little bit spicy and extra cheesy. I sprinkled some lettuce and cheese on top with some tomato and it was delicious!!! ***Make sure you use cooking spray in the pan or else the rice will stick in the bottom of the pan while it's simmering, I learned that the hard way.

Quick and easy.  I make it ahead of time for camping trip and just heat it up.  We like to top it not only with lettuce and tomato but sour cream, olives and avocado.  A favorite of the adults and kids.

My 17 yo daughters had 3 helpings each of this!  We loved this.  I did do some variations on it.  I used ground turkey, instant brown rice, increased cooking time to 10 minutes, added a little Mexican cheese blend while that cooked.  Afterwards I added one can of black beans, half a can of sweet corn, and more cheese, and one cup of Mexican cheese blend.  Topped with Romaine lettuce and chopped plum tomatoes.  Served with Ortega Taco Sauce and sour cream.

Used leftover rice, added black beans and corn and served "nacho style" over scoopable chips.  Def a hit with the family.  And so easy!

My husband and I both loved it. Only change I made was to add a can of black beans (drained) and a can of diced tomatoes with chilies. We topped it with salsa and sour cream.  Very easy to make and delicious.

Not bad for a 15 minute one-pan dinner!  It is pretty bland if you make it as-is, so  I would recommend adding 2 packets of taco seasoning or jazzing it up to suit your preferences.  I ended up adding corn, black beans, and diced tomatoes with chilies, as well as salt/pepper.

Simple and tasty, although it was lacking a little something.  My husband and I couldn't put our finger on it.  We will make again though, it was good.
