Fast, easy and delicious.  I did make a few changes.  I steamed the cut zucchini for about six minutes in the microwave, then drained the liquid and arranged it in a baking pan. I drizzled it with a mixture of olive oil and garlic, and sprinkled it with salt, pepper, lemon juice and shredded Parmesan cheese.  I baked it in a 350ยบ oven for a few minutes until the cheese melted.  Fantastic!

I'm a huge fan of zucchini and this is a great way to prepare it. I made it a little easier by steaming it in the microwave - zucchini never takes long to steam just few minutes. I only let it get tender crisp, then lightly scored it, sprinkled it with a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic then roasted it in the oven at 400 until done. Like others, I topped it off with a bit of Parmesan - YUM!

Tried this recipe today but added  some parmesan reggiano like others. I also used both yellow and green squash. It was fab. A word of caution, let the squash drain before dressing it or it will be watered down.

The easiest and healthiest way to prepare zucchini, yellow squash (not to mention a host of other nutritious veggies!)  We added several additional cloves of garlic to the steamer, skipped the oil altogether, and topped with freshly ground pepper only.  this disappears as soon as it's done.  Thanks so much, Barb.  Fantastic!

This "recipe," for as basic and simple as it is, was disappointing. I chose it not for its unique qualities or its creativity, but simply for that fact that I'm not too familiar using a steamer so I chose this as a reference guide to gauge how long to steam the zucchini. Even being strictly just a "recipe" for how to steam zucchini, it was way off.  The cooking time is far too long, resulting in zucchini that turned to mush once touched.  For a recipe that calls for nothing more than cooking directions and simply seasoning with olive oil and a little garlic (not even salt and pepper!) one would have thought that its fundamental purpose, steaming the zucchini until done, would have offered a reliable cooking time. Next time I do this (if I even bother to steam zucchini again) I'd immediately shave a good four or five minutes off the cooking time.  You can always cook it longer, but once it's mush, it's mush.

I'm the only zucchini fan in the family and I loved this recipe.  It's healthy, easy and tasty.  My family didn't care for it only because it's zucchini, not because of the recipe.

Very good. The mashed steamed garlic is the secret ingredient of this dish. I used a dash of Italian season on the zucchini before I placed it in the steamer. And, I also sprinkled a little bit of salt and pepper on the finished dish.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. Steaming is my favorite way to cook vegetables. Great idea with the garlic too! I over cooked the zucchini so my hubby and son didn't like the texture. But it had great flavor. Not, spectacular, but very good for a Wednesday night dinner!

A super easy and healthy way to prepare zucchini! I loved how easy it was to mash up the garlic. This tasted really good without much prep work. I consider it a success when my husband will eat the veggies voluntarily!

Wow, this surprised me.  I needed something really quick and easy since dinner was basically ready but I had no side dish prepared yet.  This couldn't have been simpler!  Just added a little S & P to top it off.  Love the garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

We didn't love this.  By putting the steamer basket in a pot of water, the zucchini is essentially being boiled.  The garlic added a nice flavor but it just ended up being okay even with throwing on a little parmesan at the end.

I love zucchini and since I am watching my weight I eat it all the time. This was a nice change to my taste buds! Instead of using olive oil I replaced it with yogurt butter (this is about 90 calories less) I also more garlic since I love garlic and I added to taste salt and pepper! This is quick, easy, filling as a meal all alone and very yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Fast, simple, healthy, tasty.  My toddler ate a giant serving!  I placed the steamed garlic in a small bowl with the olive oil and some sea salt and mixed that all together - then gently folded the oil/salt/garlic mixture into the zucchini with a spatula.  Would repeat.  Great for those times when you need to get a healthy dinner on the table fast with as little fuss as possible!

This is a really delicious and simple recipe...a great way to use up that extra zucchini from the garden!  I did add a couple dashes of salt and pepper along with about 1 tablespoon fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  My family raved about it and there were no leftovers.

I wasn't overly impressed but no one asked if they could put them back in the bowl.

I threw a few remaining brussel sprouts I had on hand in with the zuchinni just to use them up. Nice flavor, easy preparation. Don't over steam otherwise they will be really soggy!

Even better with a little Parmesan sprinkled over it just before serving! My daughter who hates most veggies, loves this zucchini dish.

Good, but changed it a bit, used butter instead of the oil, added garlic salt and parmesan, probably not as healthy as Barb intended.

There was not really any garlic taste, and the olive oil adds unnecessary fat. I think the cloves should've been steamed whole with the zucchini or just completely omitted, as well.  Mediocre at best.

This was pretty good.  I loved the way that the garlic turned out as I have never steamed it before.

The zucchini lacked flavor. Maybe it needed more garlic or an herb flavor like dill. It was ok but wouldn't make again.

Loved this!  Great side dish, I steamed it in the micro, took 3.5 minutes.  Great for someone who can't eat dairy, thanks!

This is so simple but incredibly delicious. I added a mixture of cajun style spices and topped with some grated Romano cheese.

Mmmmmm! Perfect. Nice and flavourful. The EVOO and garlic are not too overpowering, yet you can still taste them, just ehough. Love this recipe.

This was so good and so easy. Like other reviewers, I decreased the steam time. I also added the grated Parmesan as a reviewer suggested.  This was so yummy, it will become one of our go-to'sfor a quick side dish.

If you don't have the time to  grille or roast this is an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly which I usually do first time out. I must admit just before servingI I sprinkled some grated Parmesan cheese over it. Delish!

made this as a side to Skillet Gnocchi with chard and white beans, roasted as suggested, and enjoyed. Thanks for an easy recipe.

Not my favorite zucchini recipe. I think I steamed a bit too long so zucchini was soggy. I prefer to grill it.
