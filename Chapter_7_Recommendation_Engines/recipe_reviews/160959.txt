This is a great recipe. I used pearl tapioca not quick cooking and just soaked it longer and cooked it longer.

Tapioca Pudding is a Brazilian traditional dessert. We like to use condensad milk instead of sugar. and always in the top of it, grated fresh coconut or no sugar add dry coconut. Really good!

I made this without the egg - simply because by that point it seemed thick enough that it didn't really need it - and stirred in chopped mango. It was awesome!

OH...MY...GOSH!! How delightful. How inviting. Just utterly delicious. The last time I ever made tapioca, it had been more then 5 or 6 years. I had bought some coconut milk for something..but couldn't remeber what for. So I came across this recipe and to my delight...this was. I did replace the sugar with a sub and it still worked out well. This made me happy happy as we at it hot. Eating it cold the next day. Not wise....I refrigerated the leftover portion from a double and well, that didn't go over well, trying to  get it out of the bowl the next day. Note to all. Don't double the batch for leftovers. It gels so bad, it's like Jello, it won't spoon to dish out easily at all and the texture is not pleasing. I'll make this again. But only 1 batch and not 2. We won't keep the leftovers on this dish due to what happens when you refrigerate it. For a hot instant pudding, this is it all the way. For a pudding to make and eat when cold....not so much.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did the rest of my family I made the addition of some toasted coconut, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In response to this recipe becoming grainy when refrigerated, I stored this in the fridge for two days and had no issue with it changing texture.

This recipe was so simple and so yummy.  I only had one tin of coconut milk, but added water to make up the quantity of 'coconut milk' to 2 tins. I used the small lime green coloured tapioca pearls.  Will make this one again for sure. Thanx for sharing!!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I love tapioca and coconut but had never tried them together!  I loved it!  I changed the original recipe by not adding the egg.  It was thick enough without it. Also, I did not have 2 cans of coconut milk so I filled the can with milk and used that.  It was perfect and I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I used coconut milk beverage because I didn't have any canned coconut milk left. I used the vanilla kind which is already sweet so I cut back the sugar to 1/3c. I also added in a little coconut extract at the end because I'm a coconut junkie. Slightly more gelatinous than regular tapioca, but the flavor was amazing!

This was VERY good!  It is very similar to a dessert at the local Thai restaurant.  They use sticky rice instead of tapioca.  The restaurant's version has a bit more liquid in it as well it is sweeter.  I chopped up mango over the top.  Yum!!

Yummy! tapioca is one of my favorite desserts and coconut makes everything better!   I didn't use the egg, just cooked it a little longer and it got nice and thick.  It was good warm and cold.

This was good, however I had to add probably about a half a cup of sugar for  it to be sweet enough.

Yumm, I didn't use the egg it didn't need it...I used honey instead of sugar and added a pinch cardamom and vanilla from a bean and it was delish...what a delightful pudding, also I didn't have any "quick" sago so I used regular and soaked and cooked it a tad longer but no biggy. I used some ramekins topped it with toasted coconut and dates... everyone loves it!! ??

I followed the recipe, including the egg (which didn't appear to help or hinder).  The consistency right from the start is like wallpaper paste!  Looks more like oatmeal than pudding.  Although I LOVE warm tapioca, I did not like this warm at all.  It was at least palatable at room temperature.  I'm not sure what it would take to make it better.  I thought the coconut milk would be a nice alternative to dairy and add flavor but I couldn't detect ANY coconut flavor whatsoever.  Very disappointing. :(

This was great! I usually try to skimp on sugar, but I wouldn't recommend it on this one. The batch I made was 4 stars but I think if I had added more sugar it would have been 5.

My whole family absolutely loved this. The egg made it nice an creamy and the coconut flavor was not overwhelming. This is sure to become a family favorite. I didn't have quick cooking tapioca pearls so they were a bit firm but I'll know better and soak them next time. My family didn't even notice. They were too busy licking their bowls.

I like to follow the recipe down to the "T" at first. Great tasting pudding. Next time I will hold the egg. Also, I might add 1/4 cup of regular milk to allow tapioca to cook thoroughly. Otherwise it was great. Be ready for some additional crunches to work off the high calories and fat. Worth it!

Very easy to make and very tasty as well!  I added 1/3 C of unsweetened coconut and 1/2 C raisins to my last batch.

I don’t eat tapioca pudding, but my wife loves it. I fixed it for her birthday and she said it’s the best she’s ever had. I followed the recipe to the letter and I couldn’t have been more happy with the outcome. Thanks!

Great warm, not so good once it cooled. I agree with the reviewer that said it was chalky.

This recipe is awesome warm.  Since this is how we like it, It was all eaten.  I did save a bite worth to put in the fridge to see if other posters reviews of it becoming chalky was correct.  I just pulled it out and sure enough, it was chalky. So bottom line, if you like it warm, you will like this recipe.  If you don't and want it chilled, don't try this recipe.

I used canned EVAPORATED coconut milk  ( Natures Charm)
I halved the recipe because I only had one can.
I added a few coconut flakes.
I did  not add the egg
Don't forget the vanilla. It makes a big difference

It was AMAZING. much better than when I make tapioca with oatmilk, I am dairy free, gluten free, egg free right now and have been craving puddings. This hit the spot.

I used small pearl like another reviewer had made.   I just wished she'd been more specific than "a little longer" instead of letting others guess. 
Either way, the pudding thickened up nicely before tempering and adding the egg.  After adding the tempered egg,  the texture of the pudding became smoother, and smelled a bit richer like a custard. I'm sure it could be made without though. Good recipe.  Keeping it.

Made it!  I only had one can of coconut milk, so I used coconut milk and regular milk.  Came out great!!!  First time making it.  4 people ate it... everyone loved it.  I sprinkled shredded coconut on top.  :)

I read other reviews and decided against the egg addition, I was worried about tempering it anyways. I'm at the finish line and it looks super oily, so I added half a cup of powered sugar, which did nothing, then heavy cream in about 1/4 cup increments which did work. I also added cinnamon because, cmon, it's awesome. I am not found of the mucus texture, but the flavor is good. I'm not sure if the texture was my fault or if that's typical of this kind of recipe, but either way I liked it. Topped with pineapple and mango!! YUM

Absolutely the best! Would definitely make again!!! I didn't have measuring spoons for Salt, Vanilla extract, and had an ounce short of coconut milk, but it still tasted amazing! (I just eyeballed the vanilla extract and salt). Its very coconut-y tasting! ;p

Very good but like the other reviews, egg isn't necessary and leaves an eggy flavor. I added some shredded coconut as well

I made this recipe without egg as suggested by other reviewers. Unfortunately, the pudding came out "gummy" instead of creamy. The tapioca tasted mushy rather than tapioca balls. This may be because of the brand of quick pearls I used, maybe I overcooked it, or because of the omitted egg (?) I topped it with banana slices which added a nice taste. I don't think I'd make this recipe again, I'd probably try another recipe, or soak regular tapioca and not use the quick version.

I made this because I was looking for a quick dessert. I cooked it a little longer then the recipe said and it was pretty good. Everyone loved it. I put in some cinnamon and nutmeg too, which turned out well.

While warm, this pudding was really creamy and very rich.  Once it cooled, it became chalky.  Probably won't make again.

This recipe was delicious. I topped it with some toasted coconut for some extra flavor. I personally like not to sweet desserts, but compared to traditional tapioca this is not nearly as sweet and some may want to add an additional 1/4 cup sugar.
