Simple, tasty and nutritious. Great recipe. I had some leftover diced, roasted red pepper and added that to the tomato and garlic mix. Was concerned that the tomatoes would be overcooked, but not the case and resulted in a very rich deep taste to the tomatoes. The shrimp was cooked after 9 minutes so would recommend checking before the 10 minute mark.

Simplicity wins with this one. Not only is it fast if you use good tomatoes you ll really enjoy that freshness other efficient meals may lack. I added a table spoon of a tomato paste staple most Iranian kitchens have to give it a homey Persian flavour for our household. It was a delight.
