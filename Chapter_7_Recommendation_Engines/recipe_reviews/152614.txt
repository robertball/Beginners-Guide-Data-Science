This was very good.  I made some changes to the recipe.  I didnt use any fat free ingredients and added 80z of sour creme.  My family loved it!

I thought this was great, but I did make some changes.  First, I made my own crust with gluten free graham crackers and melted butter.  Then, I only used 1 package of vanilla pudding and added 2 single serving sized containers of banana flavored fat free yogurt.  Next time, I may also add a little banana extract as I really love the banana flavor to come through.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  This was great - I'll make this again!

The pie was delicious! The milk in this recipe is too much. We froze it for a couple more hours!
