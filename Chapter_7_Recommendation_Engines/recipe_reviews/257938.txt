This was delicious! My first time using fish and oyster sauce though... I think next time I make this I might reduce the fish and oyster sauce by half, but the rest of the recipe was spot on! I used serano peppers since I can't handle super hot and it worked out well for me but was still spicy enough for my heat loving husband. I will definitely be making this agian. We loved this dish!

This is a great recipe! It was better than the expensive take out that I get. I doubled the sauce because I wanted to add some vegetables. I seared mushrooms in a cast iron skillet (hint: put in microwave for 30 sec and it will release water that doesn't allow them to brown) also added some bok choy.  Yummy, wish I had left overs. It was a little salty but I think I may have added a bit too much fish sauce. First time using oyster sauce and I love it. Thai basil is a great addition to the recipe. You can get it at your local Asian market.  Thank you, Chef.

YUM!  Great recipe.

Chef John does say in his video that the cooking technique he used is not the "authentic" method, but it gets the job done, and it's likely that most home cooks will use a variation of his video method.

My stove is also typical for American stoves and the burners do not generate the blazing BTUs needed for authentic "stir fry" cooking method that creates that wonderful caramelization without overcooking lean meats like white meat chicken and most cuts of pork.

To get a better caramelization without overcooking/drying the meat I use the Chinese meat "velveting" technique, and cook the meat separately from the veggies, or rice when doing a fried rice.

Velveting is very simple.  Once you've cut the meat into small cubes, slices, or chopped, then put the meat in a non plastic bowl and a bit of white wine, soy, and the very important corn starch, mix to coat and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes.  The liquids will high salinity will seep into the meat bringing a bit more moisture into it, and the corn starch will create a coating that tempers the high heat of the pan so that the meat cooks nicely yet retains its moistness.  It is a WONDERFUL technique that works.

Once everything is prepped, heat up your pan with some oil in it.  Don't use EVOO as it has a low smoking point and will burn too quickly with the high heat you need.  Plus, EVOO has a particular flavor that is better suited to salad dressings and low heat saute dishes.

Once the oil starts to sm

Wow, it was FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe to a Tee and wouldn't change a thing. As for the variables, I used chicken breast instead of thighs, a Serrano Pepper (with all seeds) and one little habanero pepper (used 4 seeds), 2 tsp palm sugar, and regular basil. I enjoy a medium spice for the most part at restaurants and the pepper ratio I used worked really well, very spicy but the flavorful kind. It will get you sniffling for sure! Tone down the spice by removing some seeds. I made it last week, and I am making it again this week! A new dinner staple! Thanks Chef John!

This is sooooo good!   I made this to serve as lettuce wraps with some jasmine rice and veggie egg rolls.  It was savory, sweet, spicy and delicious.  Next time I will serve it with rice and a sunny side egg as suggested...but the lettuce wraps were an excellent alternative.   

Tip: Double or triple the recipe as the leftovers make a quick and delicious lunch for work!

Fantastic! The hardest part was chopping up the chicken without a butcher knife. Might have to invest one because this was a hit in my house (also, it looks like fun...and a great de-stressor :) ). Flavor was amazing! I had about 1-1/2 pounds of chicken and I doubled the sauce because we like enough sauce for the rice so soak up some. I served over jasmine rice. Everyone loved it and not a bite left over!

What did I do wrong?! I followed the recipe word for word, made absolutely no substitutes, and the juices from the chicken totally took over the dish and ruined it. The oyster-fish sauce never thickened or caramelized leaving the chicken extremely bland.

This is absolutely delicious!! My husband would eat Thai food EVERY day if he could.  I've always been so intimidated to try cooking Thai cuisine, but, Chef John made this so easy.  I love, love, love Chef John's recipes & his videos are immensely helpful and priceless!  Definitely chop chicken when it's still partially frozen!  I backed off on the fish sauce a bit b/c it just smells so unappetizing and the 1st time I made this I felt like it was all I could taste...only used 1 tsp. of fish sauce and it's perfect for us.  Also, Chef John loooooves spice in his food.  While I love spice, too, the rest of my fam isn't crazy about it, so, use peppers at your own discretion.  I think I use 1 (sometimes only 1/2) serrano pepper, seeded.  This barely makes enough for  3-4.  If making for a bigger crowd then I would double.  Also, make sure you have all of your ingredients prepped & ready since this cooks up FAST.  In his video he actually cooks this in what looks like a cast iron skillet, but, I actually cook it in my wok.  Have made this several times & comes out perfect every time!--thanks, Chef John!!

I read the reviews before making and so doubled the sauce as that seemed to be a common thing. I used 3 chilli peppers and found it was only a hint of spice, nothing over powering. Would definitely make again, with additional Thai peppers and possibly bell peppers for colour.
Edit: 3-4 chilli peppers seems to be right for us (5 was a bit too much, although can handle). Half an orange bell pepper added nice colour to the dish. Take the time to cut up the chicken into smaller than bite sized pieces.

This was better than 90% of the restaurant versions I've tried. I used vegan oyster sauce (mushroom-based sauce) due to a shellfish allergy and doubled the sauce. I also added red peppers and broccoli, which I stir fried for a few minutes before cooking the chicken. I love that, other than the crazy sodium level, this recipe is incredibly healthy.

This was excellent. I am a novice cook, and this seemed a bit complicated, but I followed the recipe exactly (except I substituted chicken breasts for thighs) and it turned out great. For some reason my kids weren't so wild about it, but my husband and I loved it; I guess the kids are going to have to suffer through eating this dish repeatedly.

Very tasty. I used chicken tenders instead of thighs to make a little,healthier. I used 4 Thai chilies that I removed the seeds from and it was still pretty hot so next time would use Serrano or jalapeño pepper. I would also add a little more brown sugar to make a little sweeter and double the sauce.

This was good!  I added broccoli and red pepper, which diluted the sauce with the liquid they produced while cooking.  That was the only disappointment, but that was my fault.  Like the idea of the veggies but maybe next time no pepper.  Sounds silly but I really enjoyed the chopped up chicken vs. bite size pieces!  My family enjoyed this.

update:  Made this again last night.  Doubled everything except the fish sauce and didn't add any veggies.  My sauce was not thickening so I dissolved about a T. of corn starch in a little water and added it and that did the trick.  I enjoyed it much better without the veggies.  Did not dilute the flavor of the sauce.

I double the recipe, and triple the sauce....xtra sauce is great on the rice....my husband and son love this, and that is why we always make a double batch....for leftovers....excellent recipe, and not hard to make.  Sometimes I will add some additional veggies to it, depending on how I feel.  Try it, You'll like it!

Made this a few time now. Flavors are spot on but there is a big flaw with using that much chicken broth. To get the sauce to caramelize and coat the chicken you end up severely over cooking the chicken because you have to reduce all that chicken broth. Ideally you omit the chicken broth until the end and then add if if you want a bit more of a saucy dish. No other Pad Krakow Gai recipes use chicken broth.

I used left over pulled pork and about 12 Thai chilies and this was absolutely amazing.  I will try with chicken soon.  I needed to use up the pork and a ton of basil.  I deseeded the Thai peppers because I was afraid of the heat but ended up adding chopped fresh to my dish.  Definitely double the sauce.

This delicious!! It was nice to use Thai basil and serenos from my yard. My oyster sauce had gone bad so I googled replacements and ended up adding more fish sauce and soy sauce, I made twice the sauce served on Jasmine rice and chopped green onions.

Absolutely delicious! I've made it at least a half a dozen times now, and plan to make it again soon. Besides being delicious, I was surprised by how quick and easy it is to make. After prepping everything, I put the rice on to cook, start cooking the chicken, and the chicken's done a couple of minutes before the rice is ready. The first time I made it I used Thai chilis and Thai basil, and it was great, although 2 Tbs of Thai chilis was way too much (still delicious, but very spicy, and I have a high tolerance). Cutting the Thai chilis to one tablespoon seemed about right, but if you're sensitive you might want to cut back to a teaspoon, or use a milder type of pepper like serranos. The second time I used mostly Italian basil and serrano peppers - cutting the amount of peppers almost in half - and although I liked the flavor with the Thai basil better, it was still fantastic, and the amount of heat was just right.  The only other change I made was to double the amount of sauce, just to make the end product a little saucier. This one's a keeper!

One more thing... I've mostly made it with chicken thighs, as described in the recipe, but it works equally well with flank steak, thinly sliced and cross-cut into bite-sized pieces.

I added an extra two Serrano peppers the same time I added the rest of the fish/oyster sauce because the first time I made it, all I could taste was fish sauce. This made all the difference.

Love me some Chef John, and this method produces a nice tasting version of a great Thai dish! If (when) I make this again, I will amp up the seasoning (maybe 1.5x or 2x the sauce mixture)  because while the flavors were right, adding more of them really makes this dish pop.

I made the recipe with one modification, which was to add Stevia instead of sugar because I do low-carb. Also I used Italian Basil, because I could not find Holy Basil. Hubby still thought it was delicious.

Loved this. Followed recipe exactly. I used one tbls. of each, Red chili pepper and Serrano pepper and it was just a little bit spicy. Next time I would add at least another tbls. of peppers because I like more spice. I did add a bit of ground black pepper also. Another thing I would change next time would be to use coconut oil rather than vegetable oil. But all in all it was really good!

Simply amazing!! I think it's quite possibly the best chicken dish I ever made. Being Diabetic, I substituted 2 packs of Splenda for the sugars.

No changes, and just loved it!  Can never go wrong with a recipe from Chef John.  I had lots of fresh basil and was looking from something to do with it - thanks John.  Shared the recipe on FB with my friends.

Easy, great flavor. My chicken was a bit juicier so it took me longer to boil the sauce down, but other than that, I didn't make any adjustments and it came out great

I rarely write reviews but this dish is worth my time.  Absolutely delicious!  A perfect blend of spicy and sweet in the sauce and great basil flavor.  Such a refreshing change from my normal Thai choices.  I did end up with quite a lot of liquid that did not reduce as I did not want to over cook the ingredients. I just served it in a bowl with the rice and the extra liquid made it even better.

A+. I will be making this again. I used chicken breasts and they got a little dry. Next time I'll make a double batch so I can have leftovers and I'll make a little bit not so spicy (for my children).

THIS was sooo good!  It definitely took longer in prep than it says, but it was well worth the wait. I paired it with coconut milk rice and couldn't wait to post the pic to Instagram. Loved it!

Really really good flavor! Took a little longer than 20 min for me to prep. I also added a small yellow onion and one red bell pepper. I had to drain some of the liquid from the veggies in order for the chicken to carmelize but proceeded as instructed. Will definitely make again!!

This was great. I love spicy food and this did not disappoint. I followed the recipe as written.  My only regret is that I did not adjust for a 6 or 8 serving. I did it for 4 and there was only vapors left over after my daughter got ahold of it.

I made this dish and it was excellent.  I love spice, but this was almost too much to handle. I must have used too many peppers or the recipe is simply that hot.  I would recommend reducing the peppers and adding them to taste.

I did not use chilies.  I used a Asian sweet chili sauce (1T).  Next time will use a little fresh ginger.  My kids ate it up.

So much flavor. I added a little crushed red pepper at the end because I could not find Thai chili peppers. My almost 2yr old son ate half a plate. I made 1 cup uncooked brown rice and doubled the servings to feed 4. It was just the right amount. I will make a bit more rice next time for filler. Highly Recommend This Dish

I made it exactly as described, but tasted as I went and thought it was too bland. However, I added salt, a tablespoon of thai chili sauce, more hot peppers, and peanuts, and then it was probably the best Asian dish we have made at home. I served it with steamed sugar snap peas and rice.

Followed recipe  exactly  using a hot cast iron skillet but could not get it to caramelize, as there was  a great amount of water released from the chicken.  Could it be the quality of the chicken thighs? I love Chef John's recipes, but this one was not worth the effort.

Double the sauce. Add some veggies like bell peppers for a bit of bite. Dialing in the heat can be tough. I've been using Sriracha to supplement the peppers. Make sure to wash your rice before cooking.

Made it without fish sauce, used regular basil and red chili peppers. Used quinoa instead of rice. Was absolutely delicious. Will make again. Quinoa goes well with this dish.

I adjusted the recipe, as I am on time and allergy constraints. I used ground chicken instead of cubed chicken, as it does cook faster. I used Hoison sauce in place of the oyster sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in place of the fish sauce. It was amazing!!! My picky-eater ate two bowls.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious! I like spice so I used red Thai chilies. There was a ton of flavour in this, I will be making it again. Next time I will add some more veggies but that’s all I would change!

Made this a few times already. and it's fantastic!  The basil is a must! I didn't have it one time and it made a huge difference. I like to put a little extra. I've also made this with regular ground chicken/ turkey. Great with that too especially if you don't have time to mince chop your chicken. Side note: the fish sauce is noticeable but tolerable. My bf who normally hates certain dishes because of the fish sauce gobbled this up. The basil helped masked the "fishiness".

Fantastic!  As usual with Chef John's recipes.  We pretty much made it as is, using Serrano chilies as we couldn't find Thai here.  They are a bit milder leaving it with just a nice mild kick.  It was gone in no time.  No leftovers.  : (

Followed the recipe as best as I could, but because they were out of fresh basil at my grocery store, I used about three tablespoons of basil paste instead. I also used three chopped dried chili de arbol, since I had some at home. Added some fresh mushrooms and using the advice of another reviewer, I sauteed them first in my cast iron skillet and then added them later along with some bamboo shoots with the remaining sauce. Absolutely fantastic, but no surprise here....every recipe I have tried from Chef John has been a keeper!

Excellent meal! Easy to make, and the recipe allows for you to add your own veggies, etc. We used cauliflower rice instead of white rice, and it worked perfectly.

This came out nicely. I never tried this kind of basil before. It was a big hit. But next time I'll double the sauce  - for my daughters it was definitely not enough.

Addictive! I like that I was able to substitute some of the main “specialty” ingredients with typical grocery items. I used 4 Serrano and 1 jalapeño pepper, but diced them up so they wouldn’t be too crunchy.  I used regular fresh basil instead of holy basil and also used the white/brown sugar combo instead of coconut sugar. I had 1.2 lbs. of chicken thighs and since many people recommended doubling the sauce, I did as well but will not do that next time. I let my refrigerated oyster sauce reach room temp before creating the sauce, but I still had an issue with the sauce not being a glaze. It was definitely watery. When I make this again (and I will!), I will back off the fish sauce by 1 tsp because it was a tad fishy. It took me 15 min to cut up the chicken since I don’t have a cleaver so might have to invest in one. I ended up with 2 large servings & very sad not to have leftovers. Be sure to watch Chef John’s video because you can see what everything is supposed to look like, plus he’s very entertaining!

Hello, this recipe was quick, easy and very tasty.  I would recommend making a little extra, as I'm a person who likes sauce.  It also excellent with shrimp too.   
It's a little time consuming when it comes to cutting the chicken very small, and my food processor, was not as helpful as I thought it would be grinding up the chicken.  Do take the time to dice the chicken small though, and be sure to caramelize the chicken.  It's makes a huge difference!

Thank you Chef John for another winner! I regularly order this dish at one of the best-rated Thai restaurants in DC and this is every bit as delicious! Worth it — dark meat chicken, real Thai basil and don’t skip that nice, rich egg on the top!

Wow, this recipe is astounding! Tasted very authentically Thai!!I Took my time and followed the recipe pretty exactly except for doubling the sauce in general and using about 4x the fish sauce it called for. Made some Tom Kai Gai soup to go with it and there is already begging for a repeat:)

It was a hit! My husband, who is a picky eater, asked me several times to keep this recipe and make it again. I thought I followed the recipe exactly, right down to the cast iron skillet. But I didn't get very much of that beautiful caramelized look that Chef John's had. I later realized that I used chicken breasts, not chicken thighs. I imagine that the extra fat from the thighs would help in the caramelization process, so I'll use thighs next time. Thanks Chef John!

I had an abundance of Thai basil in my garden this year so was excited to try this recipe.   I've made it many times since then and it's always divine!   Thai basil really gives it that extra flavor and spiciness.   Thai basil is really easy to grow.  I've even started plants by taking home a section of the Thai basil garnish that comes with a bowl of Pho.  Just put the stem in a little jar of water until roots form, then transplant in soil with lots of light.

Fantastic! Did not have shallots or fresh chiles on hand, so I subbed scallions and hot chili oil. Chopped the chicken before work so the evening prep/cook time was quick. Served with jasmine rice and quick-pickled julienne veggies. Definite keeper.

Unreal delicious!  TIP: My chicken thighs were very juicy, and even on high heat, I had a hard time getting the juices to cook down, so I just mixed a little cornstarch with a couple of tablespoons of cold chicken broth at the end and mixed it in and it was beautiful and thick.  I've never had this before at a restaurant, but it just sounded good to me.  I followed the recipe exactly, (besides thickening), and my husband is STILL talking about it the next day!  He said it's in his top five things I've made for him in our six years of marriage.... and I cook all the time, so that's a lot to compare to!

This is by far the best Thai recipe I’ve made and I’ve tried a lot. I was searching for something that was similar to the Take Out I’d been getting at a local restaurant. This surpasses it. I’ve made it exactly as is, substituted beef for chicken, and experimented with different peppers and it’s always delicious. I always double the sauce. There are never any leftovers. Perfect recipe Chef John!

Unbelievably awesome, but it does require some prep time.   If you dont own a cleaver, breaking down the chicken can be really tough, so consider buying it ground if you dont have a cleaver or lack arm strength.  Otherwise, the flavors of the finished product are worth it

Made this last night, and it was super good.  However, I didn't have shallots so substituted a sliced onion.  I found that my chicken thighs (organic free-range) really got quite soupy, so I had to remove quite a bit of liquid.  Might have been using too small a pan (but it was a wok instead of a cast iron pan; that might have made the difference).  Husband and I loved it!  Thanks Chef John for another great meal.

You can't go wrong with Chef John's recipes & this one is no exception. I'm really glad I watched the video because I was able to find coconut sugar.  Next time, I'm going to try to find the Thai basil for that extra kick. Thank you Chef John!

Delicious. I added ginger root and substituted anchovy paste and clam juice for the fish sauce. I also made it a second time with shrimp.

Very much liked this, some tweaks: used coconut oil to stir fry the chicken since we didn't have "coconut" sugar. I was thrilled to be using my own home grown Thai basil. Threw an over-easy egg on top of the meal to add protein and flare. My whole family liked this - even the ones that don't like spice. Used Thai chili paste and jalepenos since we didn't have the hot stuff mentioned in these instructions. Would have taken a picture but was to hungry after no lunch and the prep. Good Advice- prep ahead.

Very good and easy! I left off the fish sauce because I just cannot take the smell, but added more soy and oyster sauce. Definitely take time to cut chicken into tiny pieces. I wish I had gotten lettuce and water chestnuts and mushrooms to make lettuce wraps. Yum! Definitely will make again!

Made with breasts because I just wasn't feeling thighs that evening, (which made it dryer, I know), and didn't have quite the amount of basil suggested, but still turned out great with awesome flavor!

Somewhere I read that when the kids got out of the cave in Thailand, they all said they wanted Pad Krapow Gai to eat.  We had it at our favorite Thai restaurant and it was delicious.  I found this recipe and it sounded about right.  Doubled the size, pretty much followed the instructions and then "customized" it with some hoisin sauce, a little rice vinegar, a few carrots and fresh celery right out of the garden (as was the basil).  

At least the equal of the restaurant version.  The times given to make it are very optimistic.  If I'd made it several times before the time would go down, but was about an hour before it was ready to eat.  Much of the time was spent in cooking down the liquid, so it was a matter of stirring occasionally.  But it did need attention.  

Carrots and the serrano peppers were added early, then cooked down.  Turned off the heat, stirred in the remaining vegetables and let it cool down.  Right before serving I added the basil.  Crispy veggies, fragrant basil and a wealth of other flavors.  Actually, very simple to put together.   I did use store bought ground chicken, but not ground chicken breast.  

Most definitely  will make this again.  Thank you for providing this inspiration.

It is delicious... and REALLY spicy! Since it was the first time making it I followed the recipe to the letter. I found actual Coconut sugar (watch the video) and it did seem to make a difference. Per John's advice I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I am going to try it again tonight with breast meat as as much as I try I just don't really care for thigh meat. It is a great recipe and will become a staple in my arsenal.

In a word FANTASTIC!  I made as written and it is truly restaurant quality.  My only negative comment was that it says 15 minutes prep, but it actually took me much longer.  I do it all from scratch without the use of processors and while I like to cook, I hate prep.  I served it over long grain rice but next time I would serve it over Jasmine rice, I just didn't happen to have it. This recipe truly deserves its five stars.

This was awesome!  Made a triple batch using boneless, skinless thigh and leg meat.  It took much longer to cook the liquids down to the point that it formed a thick sauce than the recipe indicated but since it's nearly impossible to overcook thigh meat it was not a problem.  I forgot to get the peppers and used chili paste instead.

I followed the recipe but actually watched the video too which I usually don't do.  Anyway, the recipe calls for coarsely chopped chicken but it is more than that.  Chef Johns suggestion at the end with an easy over egg made it so delightful, yummy, and amazing!  I used 3 Serrano peppers with seeds and ribs and it was perfect!

Great dish from a simple recipe.  My family is not keen on spicy food, so I omitted the chilies and added chili sauce to my own at the end.  Without the heat the dish is a little on the sweet side for my taste.  1 cup of basil seemed a bit much up front, but certainly worked well with the final dish.  I will make again, next time with some additional vegetables.

Like another review mine never deglazed and thickened.  There was too much juice from the chicken.  If I made it again I would drain the chicken juice.  I ended up thickening it.  My family liked it, I thought it was just okay.  Not as much flavor as I expected.

I made this last night with ingredients I had in the house.  I substituted Oyster sauce with corn starch and salt, the hot peppers for one jarred Peperoncini and some Cayenne Red Pepper, used dried basil leaves and 1/2 of a large sweet onion (chopped tiny) for the Shallots. My husband and I loved the flavor. I also dumped all the chicken in the sauce with some of the vegie oil  and let it sit for awhile and then used a spoon (with holes) to add to the saute pan. I doubled the recipe and it came out awesome. I also added frozen peas to the rice. Next time I may make extra sauce and saute some red and yellow sliced peppers in the sauce after the chicken is almost done. 5  stars
Note...cutting up the chicken while semi frozen is the only way. If not frozen, it can be frustrating.

Good recipe overall. Loved  it with chopped fresh basil . I do think  that some  peeps would find 2 T Thai chili peppers way way  too much. I love hot... and 1 T was good for me! 
I added salted cashews at the end. Delicious ??!

The prep can be labor intensive (chopping the chicken and basil). But worth it. I added a little more white sugar so my kids would like it.

I substituted Mirin, sweet rice cooking wine, for most of the sugar.  Since I didn't have any fresh chili peppers, I used some Sweet Thai Chili sauce I had on hand. It was delicious and cooked up so fast!

Very easy to make.  I tastes great.  I did not use as much basil as suggested and it turned out delicious.

This recipe is delicious as is, but a few changes make it even better (and more authentic). First, I prefer thinly sliced beef, such as sirloin, but chicken or pork are both good. If you have a south-east Asian market in your area, you can get sweet soy sauce and omit the brown sugar. You may also be able to get Thai basil which also goes by holy or spicy basil or bai krapow (pronounced bi graw-pow). The difference between bai krapow and regular basil is night and day, so if you have a chance, I highly recommend giving it a try. If not, there is nothing wrong with this recipe.

We loved this!!! Only substitution was to use some sweet basil from our garden and supplemented with basil paste because that’s what we had on hand. (Apparently, everyone was making this dish because 2 nearby stores were strangely out of basil.) we found Chef John hit homerun again!! A new favorite for us and I can’t wait to make it for friends. Delish! Thanks again, Chef John!! You can never retire:)

I had a bunch of Thai basil leftover from a week of sushi making and this seemed like the perfect place to use it up.  I will admit I didn't think the recipe seemed like anything special, but wow the way everything comes together is just spectacular.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Made it with ground turkey instead of chicken thigh. Super easy and fast. 100% will make again! It makes me want to keep a plant of Thai basil growing in my kitchen.

I thought this was really good. I used about 1 1/2  lbs thighs and doubled the sauce ingredients except used a little less fish sauce because of other reviews. I only used one Serrano pepper because I can't handle a lot of heat. I'll make this again.

I made this again but dang it seemed like I spent a couple of hours  chopping things up. The thighs were kind of fatty so I tried to trim that off. I didn't have a meat cleaver so tried to dice them all up with a knife that isn't the greatest. I'm wondering if I could get the butcher to chop it up like I want? The end result is great, and it cooks up quickly, but it's a lot of work to get there.

Very tasty and super easy to make! While my crop of Thai basil is bountiful, I’ll be making this regularly. I didn’t have fresh chilis on hand, so I used a dried one by turning it black in the hot oil before putting in the chicken. Everything else I followed exactly. BTW, I always try to do a decent job trimming the fat off the boneless thighs before everything else. If you can arrange it, slightly frozen chicken chops up much easier than fully thawed pieces.

Fantastic! This will officially join the regular rotation at our house. The only change I made was to cut the fish sauce down to one teaspoon. I loved how I didn't have to pre-marinate the chicken, but it was still so flavorful. I used kitchen shears to cut the chicken (I used chicken tenderloins) into small pieces, which is key. We like our Pad Krapow a bit more saucy, so I may play around to increase the liquid in this next time. Thank you for a great recipe!

The only thing I changed was the Thai chili pepper, couldn't find any so I used a Jalapeno and this was very good.  I would probably add some carrots and or peas the next time just for a vegetable.

Will definitely be making this again! Flavorful, easy, healthy and quick! I seeded the peppers and was expecting it to be a little spicier, so next time I might leave the jalapeño seeds in. Also, didn’t have boneless, skinless thighs so used boneless, skinless breasts. It was still flavorful and since it cooked fast, did not dry out. Will probably do that again! Watching the video is nice because it makes it seem like you’ve done it before.

I used Hoisin sauce instead of Oyster because I didn't have any.  This was amazing simply as is.  I chopped the chicken very small, bite sized pieces.  This will now go in our monthly rotation.

I LOVED this recipe! I wanted to try something new because I was tired of making the same ol' same ol' for my fiance. He really enjoyed this recipe, and he is difficult to please! I used regular fresh basil (not thai basil) and it worked just fine! Definitely adding this to my rotation :)

I added green bell pepper, onion, and peas to make it a little closer to the recipe used at my local Thai restaurant.  It was a little mild for my taste, next time I'm adding more spice, but the flavor was perfect.

This dish is the bomb!  The secret is cooking it down to a nice caramelized coating. I use about 1 thai pepper per serving for medium heat.  Two per serving for HOT. Great dish!

Very good! But POW - it was spicy!! My son, who recently returned after three months in Thailand, really enjoyed it. I used the suggested 2tbsp of Thai chilies but would cut back a bit next time. And there will definitely be several next times.

This was a really great meal and I followed the recipe pretty much to a T (I used chicken breast instead).  One thing I did do was after I cooked the chicken I ran it in the food processor for a 2-3 seconds to shred it and that worked out really well.  I will definitely be making this again with no edits!

Was going to get take-out Thai Basil Chicken then remembered I  have Thai basil in the garden!   So I googled "Best thai basil chicken recipe" and yours came out on top.  This may be the best thing I have ever made!  Thank you so much for sharing this!  I used half the chicken and a whole tablespoon of fish sauce and whole tablespoon of brown sugar (no white sugar).  While eating it I was feeling a little bad about the huge amount of sodium...then I realized I forgot to add the soy sauce!  Well it was a good thing, because it was perfect the way it was!

This recipe was so simple and satisfying! We used ground pork because that's what we had. We also used chopped onions because we had some leftover ones to use up - worked fine instead of shallots. Do not skimp on the basil though - it makes the dish!

This is a new favorite in our home. I made it exactly how it should be. I’m fortunate enough to have a wonderful favorite Asian market. Coconut sugar and Holy basil and fresh Thai chili’s!!  This dish is making an appearance once a week these days! YUM

My first attempt at Thai food!! Turned out fantastic following recipe to the letter!! At first was going to use ground chicken but so glad Chef John talked me out of it. The taste of basil with the heat, what a terrific combo...Thanks for the recipe Chef John!!

Ugh, I wish my pics were better! This dish was amazing! I'm so excited and surprised by how good it was and I wish I had made a double batch. The only subs I made was jalapeno for the Serrano chili (store didn't have it and I was too lazy to drive anywhere else LOL). The heat level was just how I like it though (nice and spicy...well  I did use two kinda big ones). While I think it's good with the white rice, I think next time, I'll do a light fried rice b/c I thought the plain rice washed out the flavors too much. But if you want a good way to mute the spicyness of this dish, the white rice is the way to go. Also def have the meat frozen a bit when you chop it b/c it is hard to do when it's thawed. If you have a food processor, I say use that to do a coarse chop. I'm just not buying a clever in the near future LOL.

First time ever using fish sauce and oyster sauce. I was very skeptical that it wouldn’t taste like fish but it didn’t! I made the recipe exactly as it says but used ground chicken breast instead (personal preference) and served it with jasmine rice. Husband wants it again very soon.

Made this one for a second time...agree that the fish sauce should be cut in half.  (Sorry Chef John...I know you like this stuff but it is WAY to overpowering for my family at full dose indicated.  Still love your recipes though.)  Also made one other substitution....realized too late that the Seranno peppers I thought I had set aside for this dish, were used several nights before.  Substituted by using lots (3-4 tblsps) of Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and a few drops of s Sriracha sauce.  It turned out GREAT and the whole family liked the changes.

Turned out great followed the recipe. I seeded the chillies  to minimize the heat as I had a friend who was not into spice and it was perfect. Added some chopped green onions for color and a wedge of lime. Will definitely make again.

Very simple and easy, the flavors were out of this world. I substituted the fish sauce for a prawn broth and my sugars for honey. Made colirice instead of rice. I recommend this to anyone who loves a spicy sweet zing ??

One of my favorites! I like to use ground chicken or ground pork. I also like to top it with a sunny side fried egg on top.  Thank you chef John for another hit. Love it and make it several times a month.

Chef John did it again! This was excellent. The only change I made was substituting clam sauce for oyster sauce, as that is what I had on hand. I rarely use oyster/clam sauce, so I'll probably freeze the extra in ice cube trays for the next time I make this recipe.

I made this with organic chicken breast tenders and it was still outstanding. I think the thighs would add another level of flavor though.  The other comment is that I believe it worth the while to get the thai basil.  It is becoming more and more available and if not, go to a restaurant that serves Pho and see if they'll sell you some. 
I'll be making this for company soon!

Easy and delicious. There was extra sauce left over so I would say can increase the chicken ratio.

10 17 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/257938/spicy-thai-basil-chicken-pad-krapow-gai/ ... Three  & a half stars.  I think some peanuts would improve, maybe sesame seeds; something.   I used 1 1/2t white sugar only.  I liked the glaze, just would've liked a bit more to its flavor.   This sounds bad - & I don't mean it to sound as bad as it does - really, I don't - the glaze tastes like a good frozen dinner or Asian food in an burger/chicken restaurant.   :l  :/  KK, 18, said she'd eat if I made it again (but also implied she wouldn't be requesting it.)  For that near compliment, I upped this half a'star.  UPDATE:  10 19 17 ... Oh, "fine."  E, 20, asked, with what me doubt my cooking ability tone, if I made it & seemed a bit surprised when I said I did.   :/  He said I could make it again.  What?  Whuuuuuuttt?  Hmmm.  Okay.  For the kids' half, I didn't add basil & not much crushed red pepper.  What?  Wow.

This is one of my very favorite things to get when we go out to eat, and this came out so close to restaurant style that I doubt I’d ever not just make it at home again.  It was fairly easy to make, especially with the advice on chopping the basil and chicken.  I went to the Asian market to get Thai holy basil and Thai peppers and it was totally worth it and amazing!

I love this recipe. It is super easy to make and very flavorful. I used my food processor to chop the chicken.  I didn't have any chicken broth so I used water. I made this in my Ninja 4 in 1 cooker. Since the pot is nonstick, I didn't add oil to brown the chicken. Before adding the sauce, I stirred in a tablespoon of cornstarch. This is a good recipe to use the abundance of basil from my Aerogarden, and I will make it again..

I used only 2 Serrano peppers with half of the seeds removed. It was spicy enough but next time will use 1 Serrano and 1 Habanero for just a bit more kick. One problem I had was I cooked it about 20 seconds too long in the end. Once it caramelizes it can burn very quickly at such a high heat setting. So it came out almost a bit crunchy but very taste non the less. I was amazed at how much it was restaurant  quality. (minus the over cooking)

This was easy to prepare and came out very flavorful.    I had to make with less heat since Mom can not eat spicy/heat foods, but it was still delish!  Highly recommend.  I love Thai food but didn't think I would be able to make it myself!  Thanks Chef John!

Don't be scared to use  stronger chilli .. I used jalapenos ( not eating spicy meals normaly) and they absolutely lost the power.

Excellent! I had to substitute the fish and oyster sauces because my husband is a stupidly picky and doesn't like the fishy taste. So I substituted hoisin sauce. It was great and so easy! A deliciously easy weeknight meal!

I have made this recipe 3 times now and I love it! Obviously my only tip would to be to prep everything before and have everything ready since it cooks so fast. Love it, and I'm saving money by not ordering out...win win!

This recipe turned out great!  I used to love this dish at another restaurant that I haven't had in years and this is almost spot on.  I'm sure once I get the hang of cooking it while using a wok I'll have it perfect in no time.  My only change was the chillies because I couldn't find them.  On accident I bought scallions instead of shallots.  I also used noodles instead of rice.

tasted authentic. I used Thai basil, Thai chilis and coconut sugar as the chef recommends in the video if you can find it. Flavor was spectacular and also very spicy. Preparation takes a little bit of time which makes you wonder if you should have just picked up the phone and dialed your nearest Thai restaurant for delivery ... a luxury I have since I live in the city. If you don't have that luxury, this recipe hits the spot for sure.

Really good! My sauce was thin because I used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce. Didn't think it would matter much until I watched the video and saw that oyster sauce is thick. :) Liked the dish though and will make it again using the proper sauce.

We loved this recipe and made it as a filling for lettuce wraps. It was a bit salty so we will cut back on the chicken broth and/or soy sauce next time.

This was fantastic. I gave it 5 stars because if this is your first time cooking it you should follow the recipe to the "t" in my opinion. Caramelizes famously. The only thing that I may change 'when' I do this again is to add a coarsely chopped nut (chashew or peanut). You should give it a try, you won't regret it!!

This was really good. The only change I made was  1/2 Thai basil and 1/2 regular basil. We grow both in our garden. Also, I used chicken breast.

Having spent time in southeast Asia, I was ready for an easy to make meal that reminded me of Bangkok. This is easy to do using Chef John's easy to follow technique.

I strongly suggest trying to find Thai basil or up the amount of regular basil. Be sure and find Thai jasmine rice!

I posted a photo on Facebook and my Thai friends wanted to know where the fried egg was. ;-)

Another winner from Chef John. I didn't end up having any thai chiles, so I used a healthy dose of cayenne and some red pepper flakes, and was still incredibly pleased with the results. This was a quick, easy recipe.

I made it exactly as written the first time. The second time, I added just over 1/2 cup of peanuts that I added just as the sauce was in the final stages of cooking down.  We really liked the addition and will always make it with peanuts going forward.  I only had salted roasted peanuts, but they didn't make it too salty because I use low sodium soy sauce and didn't add any salt to the rice.  I served this and the rice along side stir fried veggies of zucchini, sugar snap peas, and onion that I only seasoned with fresh ground black pepper.

I have had this Thai dish in my rotation for some time. I usually use pork that I have chopped by hand, not ground pork from the market.  Both chicken and pork are used in Thailand and in restaurants here in the US. This is the most popular street food dish in Thailand and is served with a fried egg sunny-side up on each serving. For those who made the dish and added more vegetables: fine, but that's not the traditional presentation. Side dishes of vegetables are served with this dish to add vegetables to the meal. I gave the recipe only 4 stars because this dish is not complete without the fried egg atop the serving. The egg is just not optional and truly finishes the dish. The egg yolk and the spices create a 2nd level of flavors that are memorable. Thanks once again Chef John for helping households vary their meals with tasty dishes.

Made this per the recipe, but I don't really measure anything precisely.  Couldn't find Thai Basil so I had to use regular and it turned out great.  Key is to chop the chicken into very small pieces and really brown it with the sauce.  If you don't get crusty pieces on the bottom of the pan, it won't be the same.  Recommend you vary the peppers and amount of peppers based on the amount of heat you want.  I used one serrano and the heat was about right for everyone.

It was good but I had a couple issues making it, hence the 4 stars. First, when chef john says pop your thighs in the freezer, DO IT. Chopping the chicken was extremely difficult. I'll bet most at home chefs like me don't have razor sharp knives to begin with, and then I used chicken I had just drove home from the store so it was almost room temp. I ended up having to slice most of it before chopping and it still wasn't that well chopped.

Second issue, and this is where I downrated, I guess I have a really good electric stovetop because my cast iron skillet was smoking hot and when I drizzled the oil it in it started to burn immediately and smoke like crazy. I dumped the chicken in and it burned. It tasted fine in the end cus the sauce deglazes everything, but I would caution against using your highest heat as John suggests in the video. Maybe a gas stove doesn't heat up as high, I have no idea. Just be careful.

I bought fish sauce but then lost it somehow on the way home from the store, so I just added a little worchestire instead. I don't know how much this changed the flavor. It was quite tasty.

I don't know if I'll make again just cus the smoke level was insane and my wife hates that, and chopping the chicken was rough, but I'll try the freezer method next time. It also uses so much basil it's not cost effective for someone without an herb garden. I spent as much on basil as I did on chicken, and I could get a decent steak for that price. It was very good though. This

following suggestion of reviewer, I did the velveting technique. Yuck. 2nd time, I made as written, only reducing chili amount. Everyone ate 2nds, even my picky picky daughter. usually I make recipes as written the 1st time; I don't know why I didn't this time, but I've learned my lesson.

Made per recipe. Way too salty. Maybe because I only used 3 thighs? Regardless, it isn't worth making again. I like Thai but this was disappointing.

This - extremely easy to make -  recipe was a big hit at our home! Since this is one of my favorite restaurant dishes, for authenticity I was bound and determined to find Thai Basil, and went on a quest to find it. I visited a few Asian markets and called every neighborhood store to no avail. I ended up using regular Italian basil and it really tasted just as great! The sauce really makes this taste great. I definitely would caution using less sodium and perhaps half the portion of the soy sauce. Also, I used the food processor (carefully) to chop the chicken and it saved a lot of hand work.  I doubled the recipe for 4 guests and it was not too much for a hearty dinner!

I did not add white sugar as I didn’t think it needed it. I also use less of the broth mixture. I’ve done this many times and it’s always a hit in my family.

So so yummy!!  My 9 year old requested Thai for her birthday dinner.  This was fabulous!!  Family of 6...2 adults, 3 hungry teenagers, and our 9 year old.  I doubled the recipe, but tripled the sauce. Zero leftovers!! As much as I wanted to cheat and just used ground chicken, I did the work. I chopped up 2 pounds of chicken thighs.  I used 4 Serrano peppers...I cleaned out 2 and sliced two with all the hot stuff.  Made this for my 9 year olds bday that loves spice.  She was super happy.  An amazing dish that I will absolutely make again!!

It was amazing. Made as-is (except without oyster sauce because I didn't have any) and I absolutely loved it. Super easy and amazing flavour.

Drain the chicken/oil/pepper mix before adding the fish oil sauce mix or else it will be too watery. I doubled the peppers but it still wasn't spicy enough for me.  Serve with a fried egg to make it more authentic.

Fantastic. I have a shellfish allergy so I subbed the oyster sauce for hoisin sauce which probably upped the sweetness a little bit, but it was excellent nonetheless.

This recipe is incredible!  I stopped getting takeout altogether and this is my go to recipe.  I love that I can use any meat and get delicious results.  We bought a flat top grill and love making  this outside in the summer!  Can’t wait to try your other recipes!

I loved it! I did change the recipe, you want to double the sauce for sure and just mix it all on medium to high till it thickens, which it will it takes time! I also add about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, 6-8 cloves of minced garlic, green onion and you definitely want to add roasted peanuts, fresh vegetables and you are set. It is the favorite Thai food at my home, the base for this recipe is perfect, have fun and make your own twist.

I did not make any changes, but the fish sauce is overwhelming to me. I will definitely reduce it in future. Also, it was a bit too spicy, so i will probably cut down on the peppers.

Ive made this dish many times but never this way where I add the sauce to it slowly.  The chicken was so tender and not overcooked.  I prepped about 5 jalapenos beforehand and onion and that helped get the dish going a lot faster as well.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Great recipe!  I doubled the sauce recipe and used chili paste instead of chilis, plus threw a bag of frozen stir fry mix in at the end for vegetables.  Turned out AMAZING.  Will definitely be making this again.

I lived in Thailand for 6 years and this dish was my boyfriends absolute favorite. I followed the recipe but used 1.5x the sauce. Served it with Jasmine rice, a fried egg, and sliced cucumbers. Absolutely delicious.

This was such a great recipe! Going in the box for sure. I added cornstarch to thicken bc I was impatient about waiting for it to glaze, but otherwise I made it just as the recipe states and it was wonderful!

This was very delicious. The first time I made this i followed the recipe as is & I used the Thai chilies as directed but it was waaaaaay to spicy. We couldn’t eat it. I made it again today and used 2 small Thai chillies, got rid of all the seeds & it was perfect. I also doubled the sauce the 2nd time as many suggested & added a little bit of red bell pepper. No leftovers! Made it just for the 2 of us and my husband had 2 large helpings. I served it with jasmine rice & some baby carrots.

This recipe was so easy to make and also uses readily available ingredients. (Who says you have to use holy Thai basil?) The video was a delight to watch with Chef John's wry humor. My family all loved the dish and went for seconds. Next time I'm making a double batch.

Delicious!! We doubled the recipe, which was good because it shrinks down. IMHO the standard recipe would only serve 3 "good eaters". We chopped chicken more coarsely than "ground", to about 1 cm size, and really liked the bigger pieces. (Also easier!) Otherwise followed the recipe. The sauce was plentiful, fairly thin, but wonderfully "umami", and mixed well with the rice. Of note, we made Paleo Cauliflower Rice (an allrecipies recipe) in addition to regular rice. The Cauliflower Rice was easy, delicious, had a cous-cous-like consistency, and we preferred it to regular rice. Also added healthy veggie element! We will make this again, and only change will be to triple or quadruple to have more left-overs.

I made a large batch in a wok with 2.5 lbs of chicken breast stir fry cut up as directed.  I had to drain the liquid  few times and never got any caramelization.  I would stir fry less at a time and drop the chicken broth as the chicken has enough liquid on it's own. All said it still tasted great and the right amount of heat, some real bite but not overpowering, with 10 Thai Chili peppers. I also used 1/4 of the fish sauce the recipe called for, as other reviewers suggested to use less.

I love this recipe just the way it is. I make this for my crew at the fire station and everyone loves it. Sometimes I tone down the spice by removing the seeds from the chili peppers but I prefer to leave them in.  I try to get Thai chili’s and Thai Basil from a local international market because I think it really makes the flavor.

DELICIOUS!!!!!! Followed the recipe using Thai basil the 1st time. Second time, used regular basil and pork.  Both versions outstanding!  Served leftovers (which was not enough for a serving portion) over mixed greens for lunch the next day and savored every bit.  This is a total keeper.

This was not that spicy as written for me (I usually order the mild buffalo wings) so, I added some sriracha after tasting. Still tho it was just ok.

This was my husband’s first time making an Asian dish of any kind, and I must say it was really good. I’ve never had this dish before, but it really satisfied my taste buds. He ended up using Serrano peppers instead, since that’s all he could find at the grocery store, but it’s a keeper. He said it was easy to make too.

I like this recipe a lot, however I made two major changes so take this review with a grain of salt. First change I made was using ground venison second I used sweet peppers instead of spicy. I made no other changes. I highly recommended making this dish it is very tasty.

Delicious.  Keep the chicken very cold, even slightly frozen to make it easier to chop or just throw in food processor and mince.

Very good recipe.  My husband REALLY liked it!  I made 1/2 again as much as it called for, and am glad I did.  Next time I'll have to double it.  I didn't have the chili peppers, so added a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes and about 1T. of sweet chili sauce.  I also added a little honey.  I felt those sweet additions gave a better balance of sweet to  salty, which I prefer.
2nd time used basil oil.  Even better!

This dish would have received 5 stars but for the difficulties in locating the ingredients.  Charlotte NC has a lot of really great groceries stores and farmer's markets but I could not find Thai basil or Thai peppers.  I used serrano peppers but could not get the heat I wanted.

My caucasian husband used to be part owner of a successful Thai restaurant in Minneapolis.  He didn't cook, but lived two years in Thailand and speaks fluent Thai.  After making Chef John's Pad Krapow Gai, my husband DEVOURED the dish.  The following day he asked if we were having the leftovers.  I told him, there are no leftovers.  He pouted.  Guess I'll have to make it again.  Thanks, Chef John!

Having just recently visited Thailand, I had been craving this since we returned. So, I decided to make it for the first time by using this recipe. It was good, but not exactly what I was expecting after eating the authentic dish in Thailand. It was close though, so I'll definitely use this as a base recipe while working to make it more Thailand-style. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I learned a valuable lesson regarding chopping chicken thighs into bit size morsels with a meat cleaver that has rarely been used.  No more.  The spices are rich and not overwhelming, the texture wonderful and prep time less than anticipated.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was delicious!

I should've used a cast iron pan.  I had a lot of juice as well, and just kept cooking until most of it evaporated.  Even still, this had a nice flavor.  Hubby asked that I add water chestnuts, almond slivers and spring onion next time and said with those changes it would be perfect.

Didnt have fish sauce but made this as directed. I ground up the chicken in a food processor and it soaked up the sauce. Sauted onions and peppers to top it off. Reminds me of a local thai restaurant version.

We really enjoyed this - just the right spiciest. To save time after work I precooked the chicken in the morning so made it easy to cut up and throw in, also used green onion instead of shallots since I couldn’t find any.   We will definitely be making this again!

I don't know how this came out bland with all these ingredients. Used two Serrano's and one jalapeno along with 2 shallots and 5 garlic cloves. One would think these along with the oyster, soy, and fish sauce it would have been more flavorful. It did come out watery so I will omit the chicken  and add corn starch to the broth next time. Kind of disappointed with the amount of prep.

This was great! Both my husband and I loved this. Definitely take the time to hand chop the chicken thighs....the texture is so much better than commercial ground chicken.  I used Thai basil from the Asian market, but used red Fresno peppers instead of the little Thai chili peppers. I was afraid they would be too hot. I also added a teaspoon of corn starch to the sauce to make it a bit richer. Absolutely wonderful dish!

Easy to make, very clear instructions, followed them exactly. Tasted amazing, it is spicy but not something that I would say is overly-hot. When I first bit into it, I could taste the heat rising in my mouth, and I thought uh-oh, but, just as I had that thought the heat subsided.  It ended up being just right. You can still enjoy the other flavours in the dish.  Thanks chef John! I am becoming a fan lol

Good flavor and easy to make, if a little salty. I would actually halve the amount of sauce but it was pretty decent stir fry.

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes.  Definitely double the sauce, double the garlic, and use about 1.6-1.8 pounds of chicken thighs.  I have tried it with thai basil and basil, and if you can get thai basil, get it.  Otherwise, the basil is great too.

My better half is vegetarian, so I excluded the chicken and fish sauce.  Instead I used peppers, zucchini, broccoli and onions.  I used a vegetarian oyster sauce , and doubled the sauce. 
Nice taste.

Very good, first time I’ve had Thai food really. Beware though, if you are not familiar with Thai food, it is very fishy because of the fish sauce. Maybe half the amount of fish sauce you use the first time.

So easy to make if you have all of the ingredients pre-cut. It was absolutely phenomenal. I did add two tablespoons of brown sugar to the sauce instead of 1 tsp of white and 1 tsp. of brown sugar, and did manage to find the Thai Basil at my local supermarket. I will definitely make this again.  I served over a sticky rice that could be used for sushi and  it was perfect.

Easy, easy easy. I’ve made this a couple times now. It’s nice because most of the ingredients are mixed together ahead of time and thrown in as the chicken is almost done. It’s a bit salty so I cut the soy sauce in half. Additionally, I use 2-4 Tablespoons of red chili paste, Depending on the desired spice,instead of fresh chilis.

We would eat Thai every day if we could and this was good but we didn't get the authentic 'thai' taste from it...reason for only 3 stars. It's worth making and I'll make it again but I wont consider it Thai...atleast to us, it is not like the Thai food we are used to and love. I'd consider it to just be basil chicken with some spice...sorry....

This was my 1st time making this dish. My husband has been on a Thai kick for a few years now. He can't get enough.  He'd been wanting me to make this for a couple of months. I should have made it sooner.  We both really liked it.  Healthy, very flavorful  and easy to make. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed.

This was a major hit with my picky family. They love to get Thai takeout whenever they can. So this is a favorite dish we get. They loved this homemade version!! Even more than the restaurant. I quadrupled the recipe and it was gone in a matter of two days!  This is now a staple in our house!!

So good!  Couldn’t find fish sauce (when I remembered to look) so added more soy sauce. And didn’t have chilis, so just used Sriracha to heat it up. Also added some roasted asparagus. So good! So fast! And so easy!  Will make a double batch next time because there were no leftovers!

I have 4 kids and a semi-picky husband.  This dish (which I follow to a tee with no substitutions or changes) is the favorite in the house.  I’ve made it several times and it still is the champion dish in our home!

Made as is (didn’t have oyster sauce on hand).  Loveeeeee it!  It’s really easy to make.  I would double the sauce and chop the chicken very small.

Very delicious. I doubled the sauce and used rice noodles instead of rice. All we had on hand was dried basil and that was fine. Go easy with the Thai chilies, I only used 3 and it’s very spicy!

I made this recipe using 3 serrano peppers which my husband sliced and didn't remove the  pith and seeds from... It had great flavor but a bit too spicy for me and my spice loving daughter.  Next time, we will be removing the seeds and the pith. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Chef John!

We made this exactly according to the instructions and it was fabulous! I had all the ingredients measured and ready for my husband to stir fry. We served it over Thai Jasmine rice after having a salad for appetizer. Perfect! Just an FYI, it smells more fishy than it tastes.  Really delicious! We used 2 large Serrano peppers for the choice of heat. We like spicy so it was perfect.

This was delicious! I'd never ground my own chicken before, but it was easy. Once everything is prepped it comes together really quick. 

Though I made it with rice for dinner, I ended up using it for lettuce wraps as leftovers. DELICIOUS!

I added chopped peanuts on the side as an optional topping.

Next time I'm going to double the sauce. It was so good!

I liked this recipe a lot, as did everyone who ate it!  But it was a lot more time/work for me than the times would indicate.  Next time I might add peanuts and try it as a lettuce wrap.

I followed this recipe except I used chicken breast instead of thigh as I don't prefer dark meat.  I did reduce the oyster sauce as my husband is not a huge fan of fish flavors.  This one is going in my stack of quick fix recipes.

Was extremely toothsome. As noted in the recipe, prep is key to a flawless cooking experience. Adjustments are for the second round, and there will be a 2nd.

chef jon is right, the best chicken ever.  I added about a T of siracha  over the meat, just before adding the basil, I like heat. It was delicious, I have made it twice, following his video. two small thighs serves two with rice.

I made this 2 times wanting to love it but it was just ok, which isn't good enough for me.  The first time I did the recipe exactly as noted and the taste was maybe too strong with the oyster sauce and fish sauce???  I can't remember but I cut those sauces in half and the sugars and again it was just ok.  I like my food flavorful and with a bit of a bite but this had neither :(.

This is a good recipe.  Depending on the brand of oyster sauce and fish sauce you use, might want to omit one of them. I found it extra salty and I used 3 crabs brand fish sauce. I had to add an extra sprinkle of sugar to it but it carnelized very nicely. I diced my chicken thighs because I didn’t have a butcher knife.

First time I made this, I used a non stick pan.  Sauce never thickened and the dish was pretty good but not great.  Invested in a 12" cast iron pan and what a difference.  Looked just like the video and was every bit as good as from a restaurant.  I cook a lot of Asian food, and this will become a regular.  Served 3 in my house.

This is now a staple.  Everyone likes it.  Ability to make spicy or mild all in how many chiles you add (mild =0/1, medium 4/5, hot 6+).  I like to add one sliced red bell pepper to get more veggies - do so when you add the majority of the liquid so that it steams just a bit, but doesn't get soggy.

Such a yummy Thai dish, and so easy! I substituted extra chicken broth for the fish/oyster sauce as I didn’t have any, and halved the sugar. I think next I’d just reduce the sugar by a fourth. Really good, thanks for sharing!

Don't know where I went wrong.  I do a lot of cooking.  Made this for 40 people at a Christmas day event.  Used Pearl River Bridge soy sauce, Red Boat fish sauce, and Lee Kum Kee premium oyster sauce.  Used actual thai basil bought at Restaurant Depot.  The outcome was a dark brooding flavor with zero nuance.

Will definitely make it again!  Delicious . . .I did use white meat chicken, and it came out very, very well.  My family demolished it.  One time I forgot to get fresh peppers and substituted a teaspoon of crushed red peppers.  Still awesome.

This recipe is amazing.  Expect to spend more like 30 minutes prepping unless you’re a professional chef.   I highly recommend using wok or large cast iron skillet because this is intended to be stir fried on high heat (crank it up all the way, don’t be scared), and you’ll need all that heat to reduce the sauce and glaze the chicken properly.  DO NOT remove from heat until most of the sauce has evaporated.  Again, high heat is key.

Excellent recipe! This was my favourite dish in Thailand and I was disappointed to discover no local restaurants in my area make it well enough haha but with this recipe I surprised my partner, myself, and our tastebuds! I used minced chicken, and chilli paste instead of fresh chilli, and obviously serve it with a fried egg on top - absolutely perfect! The amount of sauce for the chicken was perfect as well - wouldn’t change a thing!

I've made this type of dish before without this recipe, and so going into this I thought I was going to make something amazing. Honestly, it didn't really taste any different or special than how I make it, which I just eyeball all the ingredients. I do like the addition of the white and brown sugar because it does make the sauce caramelize/thick and not watery.  I usually use chicken bouillon powder when making this, so using chicken stock was a nice change in terms of adding more sauce to the dish. 

I did add red, yellow, and orange bell peppers to give it some color and mushrooms to make it more filling. The only reason why I rated this as a 3 out of 5 is because it doesn't taste any different than how I usually make it, which I think taste pretty good.

This was so easy to make and tasted delicious!  I didn't have Oyster sauce, so I substituted with Hoisin sauce (1 tsp) and Plum sauce (2 tsp). Also added 1 tsp chili paste instead and it was very flavorful!  I always add extra basil - which makes the flavors come alive.  I highly recommend this dish

I’m giving this a 3, because I thought I followed the instructions to a T, but I just ended up with an insane amount of basil coating everything.  Everything turned green and had a very poor taste.  If I make it again, I will dial it back a bit and see if I can give a better review.

Definitely will make again. Some edits: start by [rinsing and] patting dry the chicken. Then cook in oil until no pink shows. Then dry again either with colander or paper towel or both. THEN add the garlic, shallots, peppers and table spoon of sauce and caramelize (all in all, the chicken adds WAY too much sugar-free liquid to caramelize well). Deglaze with remaining sauce and cook until sauce thickens. Finally add any vegetables you want (if frozen, cook the water off them in a seperate pan before adding in). IFF the sauce isn't spicy enough, you can just use scissors to cut a few more chillis into it, I did. Did the same for the thai basil

I also reduced the oyster and fish sauces by half only because they are over whelming. I also tripled the Thai chilies and Thai basil. Very spicy but very good

Chef John, you are a legend. My boyfriend marveled that this was better than any Thai food we’ve ever had... and we order a lot of Thai. I used Serrano peppers and different proportions of everything... about 1.5 lbs of chicken, doubled the veggies, doubled the sauce. The sauce actually carmelized so quickly that I ended up making even a little extra sauce to drizzle over the rice. This was definitely quite spicy, but the amount of spice was perfect to offset the sweetness and pungency of the sauce. Seriously just perfect.

Delicious. I wasn't able to get the browning as indicated here. Not sure why. My chicken thighs seemed to have retained quite a bit of water.

I did not use a cleaver for chopping up the chicken. The food processor pulsed worked fine.

Very delicious.  I used regular basil and it was very good, but wondering if Thai Basil wouldn't even make it better.  Used serrano chili's(seeded) and it still had a really good kick to it. I did the velvet cooking method on the chicken to make the chicken more tender and to thicken the sauce which is to coat the chicken in cornstarch for 30 minutes. I also doubled the sauce which I am glad I did. A keeper for sure.

I was skeptical after seeing the ingredient list.  Don’t think I have ever used oyster sauce in a Thai dish before. Didn’t taste at all like what I get at local authentic Thai restaurants.  Just tastes like fish sauce and sugar.  I used Thai basil which did give the Thai flavor that Genovaises

Nice simple meal that any type of substituted vegetable would complement the chicken well. I cubed the chicken breasts and boneless thighs about fingernail size and done this while the chicken was still partially frozen.

Super delicious!! Next time I’ll double the recipe. I used Serrano peppers and removed most of the seeds. It was pretty spicy so next time I’ll remove all seeds and see how it tastes. The best part is how delicious this was and how quick and easy it was to make!

This recipe is delicious!  I omitted the white sugar and it was still very tasty.  I think next time I may cut the amount of soy sauce because it was a little salty.  If you have a food processor, I would suggest using it to chop the chicken because it gives professional results.

But this dish is restaurant quality, seriously!  My family loved it and I will make it again and again.

The recipe turned out well, but I did veer off a bit from the recipe by chopping some carrots and adding a bit more soy sauce and pepper (it tasted a little bland).  Overall it was a good recipe - something different to make with ground beef.
Thank you!

Made this twice already. Once with pork loin assorted end chops and the other with breast. It’s delicious both ways.  I never have shallots on hand so I used white onions. The first time I had left over broth from chicken soup, the second I mixed water with chicken base. Both methods work. My photo is the pork method
Edit:The last time I made this, I forgot to add the onions so I added them the last minute; they had a delicious crunch that added a great flavor.

I made this last week and the only thing that went wrong is I doubted that I could make good Thai food and didn;t double the batch...This is WONDERFUL! I used fresh basil from our gardens and fresh serrano and jalepino. It was;t very spicy but it picked up the flavor...I was so bummed there wasn't more! 

Making it again this weekend. It's easy to make. I did pick up the fish and oyster sauce and they were perfect in it (I'm not big on seafood, don;t smell them directly). Honestly it's my FAVORITE new recipe!

Great! I did not have hot peppers so I used red pepper flakes and that was more than sufficient!

I've probably made this now about 20 times. My family absolutely loves this dish. A word of warning: I LOVE hot food but if you use two tablespoons of actual dried Thai chilies your head will explode. I normally triple all the rest of the ingredients so we have leftovers. I put one minced, average size (approx 1.5" long) dried Thai chili in the triple serving dish and it carries some heat (remember, I really like my hot foods). There is almost no comparison between one of these chilies and a Serrano. Serrano's are awesome but it's like comparing apples and toasters.

The secret is patience!  
Wait until the juices from the chicken cook down!
Wait until the sauce cooks down!
Oh yeah no Thai dish is complete without lime juice.
Yum!

This was easy to make and very tasty. Even the picky eater in the house ate it.  Next time I'll try to find Thai Basil and add more chilies to get more heat. I was pretty conservative, afraid to make it too hot.

Well I did make some changes to the recipe to make it easier for me to make, because right now I have an energy problem. I used 93% lean ground turkey because it was on sale and I doubled the recipe. I replaced the broth with bouillon and used extra to make it taste chicken like. Also I  didn't buy chilies, so I used two tbsp of sriracha and a little bit of cayenne pepper. Everything else was normal and I used regular basil. It tasted great still even with all the changes.

Liked this but did find it a little salty. I doubled the sauce and used ground turkey cause its all I had on hand. added sauteed mushrooms, Bok choy and snap peas.  Served it over basmatic rice, will make this again.

Taste was delicious.  Spicy and flavorful.   However it is very soupy and personally I think could use a slurry of cornstarch to thicken it.  We ate it in a soup bowl.

The family loved it! My husband can be a bit picky when I try Thai, I LOVE it. He really liked the flavors & even though I may have made it a bit too hot the first time around, he definitely said " a keeper!" :).  Since I doubled the sauce, I also added a heaping Tbsp of sweet chili sauce to balance the fish & soy. I think I will also add cashews next time.

I made it and was a keeper but I think there should be a warning on the Thai peppers. Video demonstration used a blend Serrano peppers and jalapeño. Used Thai peppers and conservatively and it was a hotter than some could handle. I will use a calmer pepper next time. It was still delicious and will make again.

Just being super honest.  I couldn’t get past the fish sauce.  I thought it smelled  absolutely repulsive and actually got my gag reflex going.   My family did like the finished product  reason for the 3 stars, but I couldn’t bring myself to even taste it

Delicious.   I substituted onion for shallots when I discovered my shallots had gone bad.  I used three Serrano peppers, a little less than 2 T.   Next time I will use more, closer to 3 T.  A great way to use our abundant basil crop.

I made it exactly as shown, except I made it with beef because we had too much chicken lately and wanted a change. I looked online and there are other recipes for the exact same thing, with beef. It requires thinly sliced beef. I found shaved beef at the store, when I slice it myself it comes out too thick.

It was absolutely delicious, the best thing I ever ate...almost. Anyway, top 5! :)) It just wasn't enough for the entire family and I wanted to eat the whole thing myself. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

I didnt have oyster sauce, thai chilis or thai basil. Chicken broth was leftover homemade from rotisserie chicken bones. I doubled the fish sauce, used fresh basil, raw cane sugar, and 1 jalapeno. Could probably take more heat for all the spice lovers. But nailed it! Got great reviews from the family. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This turned out fantastic.  I didn’t have the Thai pepper but added a jalapeño instead with the seeds.  It could have been more spicy but we added extra hot sauce at the end.
I will definitely make it again.

My husband LOVED this and said he wants to have it on a weekly basis. The flavors are great, but I made sure to use everything low sodium, as a lot of those ingredients can really rack up the sodium levels fast. My husband also doesn’t like the texture of peppers, so instead of chopping them, I just sliced in half and added while cooking to get the heat and flavor, then removed to serve. I did add a little bit of crushed red pepper to get the heat where we want it.

Loved the spicy/sweet taste.  Doubled the sauce which was good as it really cooks down as it carmelizes.  Will definitely make it again!

I've made this several times  since I first tried it. Love it. I used serrano peppers and they were pretty  spicy, but perfect for me. I also recommend cutting the chicken into small pieces like the picture shows. Another tip I have is to make sure not to use too much broth and to avoid over crowding the pan. Doing these things allows for the sauce to thicken up more quickly so you don't end up over cooking everything or with a runny sauce.

Great recipe, I actually used it for the filling in some chicken wraps and gave it a sprinkling of peanuts and a sweet/fire sauce.  This is definitely a recipe that can be flexible with new additions.

This was good. I grew Thai basil this year, and was wondering what to do with it, and this recipe solved that problem :) I used regular onions instead of shallots, and ground cayenne pepper instead of the fresh peppers - my OH is not crazy about spice and it is easier to get the heat perfectly using dried rather than fresh peppers.  

Update - made it again, this time with ground beef - yum!

I made the chicken, sausage, and peppers. It was delicious and my family cleaned out the entire pan. Making it again by popular request. Love the channel because it helps find nutritional meals, easy to prepare that my family loves.

I was looking for something different and found this recipe. I'll admit I was kind of scared because I had never made Thai food before. I followed the directions with one exception.. I had to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was awesome ! I paired it with Coconut Jasmine rice recipe from here. Definitely will be making it again !

The flavor was pretty good, but I just felt like it was a little greasy.  I only used 1T of oil so I’m not sure why. Also, I don’t think I used hot enough heat cause the sauce never really camalized. I will try again though!

Really good and I nice break from the typical meals I make. I'd recommend doubling the recipe since it really does make very little. I added a green and yellow pepper and mushrooms to mine to make it a but more hearty. The sauce was thin until the mixture cooled, but was really delicious once done!

I tripled the recipe for the family; all except for the soy sauce because I didn't want it too salty. I think that doubling the sauce would have been okay for the tripled meat because it still came out salty. The flavor was so good though. My husband and kids loved the recipe and asked for it on the regular dinner rotation list. I need to figure out how to make it less salty next time though.

This video was my first exposure to Chef John.  Since then I have been browsing through foodwishes.com having a grand time trying this and that.  I always have to double this recipe because it is so good!  Only other change I make is to add about 3/4 cup of crushed peanuts.  One time I tried adding some ginger too but the flavor was wrong for the dish.  One of my favorite recipes.  Thanks Chef John!

Very good but a tad on the salty side, I'd cut down the fish and soy sauce to maybe 1/2 of the recipe and punch up the spice with a smear of Korean pepper paste. 
In the end, before adding the basil, I mixed in a tablespoon or so of arrowroot dissolved in water to pull it together a bit and let it glaze up.

Excellent recipe to use up the fresh basil in my garden! Very tasty recipe! However, I found it very salty tasting. Next time I make this dish, I will reduce the amount of fish and oyster sauce called for in this recipe and use the low sodium soy sauce. Otherwise, a very flavourful recipe.

This was fantastic! 

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some extra garlic. Next time I would probably add some more peppers since it wasn't very spicy.

Instead of serving it over rice, I make some tumeric garlic mashed potatos and made a kind of shepherd's pie.

HOLY YUM. I like veggies so I added one green pepper, one red pepper, and probably a cup of rainbow carrots, all diced small. I actually tripled the sauce since I had so much going on and I’m very glad I did, it worked perfectly. In my opinion, one serrano pepper didn’t add any spice, so I will add more next time. Also, as a novice cook, I used thighs for the first time ever, and can say I will NEVER use

Delicious! Definitely add the hot peppers (I used 4Tbs of chopped jalapeños) and don’t worry because the cooking mellows the hotness of the peppers. Will go into my dinner rotations! Thanks for the recipe!

Hot , delish! Spicy and full of flavor! I made it as a lettuce wrap and there weren’t any leftovers. Typically I customize recipes to my family’s taste. The only thing I left out was the shallots and added a little extra garlic. Will definitely make this again.

Fantastic recipe! I used 1tsp. of Black Bean & Garlic sauce as a sub for the Fish Sauce , only because I didn't have any on hand. I also used chicken breast, made it into cutlets and then diced it. I don't know if I didn't have my heat up high enough, but my sauce didn't caramelize very well.  Regardless, it was F'n delicious, so much so I had to hide a serving just so I had some to take to work. The rest of the family descended upon it while I was showering for work, and kindly left only empty dishes to clean... This one's going into the family recipe box.

This was absolutely delicious. To quote my husband “restaurant quality”. I made a double batch with 2 1/2 Serrano  peppers with seeds in -  and was perfect heat with basil to offset. I will be making this often.

One of my favorite recipes,. I usually just put the chicken into a food processor, which is kind of icky, but the results are awesome and I don't have to cut the chicken!! I usually do about 1.5 times the sauce (my family likes a lot of flavor) and it is great.

We love Thai food, this was amazing and so easy.  I chopped the peppers and garlic in my processor and added in a piece of ginger and few Keefer lime leaves.  Super easy for a weekend night dinner without ordering out and busting the budget.

Love this. I have made this many times and found that if you double the sauce and add in smaller increments to let it glaze up the chicken, it’s fabulous. Also, don’t skimp in the basil!

It came out well.  However, I would add less oyster sauce or fish sauce.  It was a little fishy for me although my husband was okay with it.  But that’s a pers9nal preference, otherwise the dish came out well.

This was a fantastic dinner with the perfect kick. We used Thai basil since I have some in the garden, and also used coconut sugar instead of white and brown (mentioned in the video). I also added half a yellow bell pepper, half a red bell pepper, and 2 handfuls of broccoli florets to make this a full meal. I will not make ANY other changes as this was perfect. We served it over rice and there wasn't anything leftover after my husband and children had seconds.

Not only did this dish have amazing flavor, it was fun to make!  I used regular basil and a mix of Thai and Serrano chilis.  I subbed 1 TBSP of the veg oil with coconut oil (first time using it - wasn’t sure how strong it would be).  I served on riced cauliflower to cut carbs and calories.  I had water boiling and ready for regular white rice as a backup but I didn’t need it.  I will definitely make this again.

This just might be one of my few 5 star ratings of all the recipes I have made on here. And I didn't change anything.  I tripled the recipe using 3 pounds of chicken after I trimmed off all the fat. It produced quite a bit of liquid so I drained some of it so it would caramelize in my cast iron pan. I served it to 6 adults and 3 people had seconds. We ate it all. Derek had 3rd's.  I used 1-3 jalapeno and 1/2 of habanero which was super hot.  Another time I used 1 jalapeno and 4 little thai chili's and we wanted more spice. I cut the basil as directed and almost got to 2 cups of it chopped. I once ended up chopping the basil but no big deal.  It did use up most of my garden basil. This time I used Oyster flavored sauce and we actually liked it better than oyster sauce. I do have coconut sugar and kept adding it until I liked the taste.  Actually,  I added 3 tablespoons of the sugar instead of 3 teaspoons. If I don't set the eggs out in a bowl, I will forget to make them at the end. The eggs made the dish SO MUCH better. I might put 2 eggs over my dish because I love eggs. My picky sons loved this meal too and it's perfect for guests.  Next time I might make more sauce and add veggies into the dish.

Not surprisingly,  this was absolutely delicious! I am sure it is very good with sweet basil but I have a lovely Thai or holy basil plant this summer that makes this dish every bit as good as any Thai restaurant I have visited. We added a quick and easy Thai cucumber salad to the meal and it was an amazing meal! Thanks,  Chef John!

I've made this a couple times and loved it! So did my annoyingly picky husband! I did change the recipe a bit (of course I did) by using ground chicken and reducing the sugar. One time, the chicken was really watery for some reason so I didn't need as much chicken broth.

II'm giving 4 stars because I used ground chicken instead of the cut up thighs. Nest time I will definitely use the thighs. This was really good, but my sauce never carmalized.

I use coconut sugar as an option suggested in the video because I already had it on hand.  Also, I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil because it's a healthier alternative and also seems to make the flavors "pop".
This dish has become a regular favorite in my household as my husband requests it at least once per week; and because it is pretty easy to make, I honor that request.

I made the recipe with not much chili. It tasted great with oyster sauce. The basil leaves gave it an aromatic flavor.

This was very good. Wish I could have gotten Thai basil, but used regular and purple. I also used breast meat instead of thighs and made small bite size instead of chopped. That was how I'd had it in restaurants.

This meal exceeded my expectations. It is delicious. Well worth the minimal prep time. I will DEFINITELY make it again and again.  I'm grateful for the recipe.
To Rose Cobb: Because you were not using a pan that held high heat, your chicken juice did not evaporate. This happened to me. I took my cooked chicken out and poured out the juice. Then I proceeded.

The technique for this recipe was worth 5 stars!  

The end product/flavor was just a miss for my family. The consensus was  that the flavorings, while authentic, just sort of fell flat. It just tasted "Asian with Basil and Hot Chili"

I had to scale up all the ingredients as I was serving 8 (5 grown men, 2 women & a child) so I used just under 4 pounds of chicken and upped the rest by the same factor. Then I tripled the sauce as many suggested and added a lot of spinach (after tasting the original recipe). I served this with steamed Jasmine rice and sauteed zucchini on the side. Everyone added their own choice of condiments (we have a huge assortment, ie: mae ploy, sambal, sri racha, sesame seed, seaweed, etc). Every bit was eaten.

It was agreed, however, to not repeat this recipe as we just seem to enjoy other flavor combos.

I took a short cut and placed rough chopped chicken in the Cuisinart for a few pulses.  It did a great job of chopping for me and the texture was perfect.  My chicken gave up a lot of juices when I stir fried it in the wok.  I tried reducing it but ended up siphoning off about 1/2 C with a baster.  I think I would have ended up with a soupy mess if I hadn't done this.  The flavor of this dish was outstanding and I will make it often.

excellent!!!! it takes a little longer to deglaze than shown and obviously more soy or oyster sauce was used to impart the chicken a caramel color....which I didn't do.

I've made this twice now, and the second time was better than the first--so, it's time to add this to the family rotation.  These are some things I've noticed:  first, I did half the amount of oyster and fish sauce both times.  (I have not used either of these ingredients until this recipe, so I've been hesitant to use the full amounts.)  Second, have all of your measured ingredients ready to go, as you are cooking over high heat.  Third, water is released as the chicken cooks, so to prevent the mixture from being too soupy, I drained the liquid after the onions and peppers cook down (before I added the first bit of sauce mixture).  This helped tremendously!  

Another problem I had the first time I made the recipe was that I couldn't get the ingredients to caramelize.  The second time, I made sure to have my pan on high heat (as high as my ceramic cook top would go), and let the ingredients cook until the liquid was almost entirely gone (stirring frequently as I was concerned about it burning).  After a few minutes, the chicken did darken.  I'm not sure that I have this technique down yet, but I will keep experimenting.  

And, last but not least, our family likes spicy Asian food, so I added about 1 tsp. of chili powder during the final minutes of cooking.

I made the recipe using one Fresno chili instead of the Serrano and didn't chop the chicken as finely as called for.  Thai would use ground meat, not necessarily chicken.  And serve with a crispy fried egg on top.  This is an excellent recipe.

sounded great.

Just don't try to use a food processor to chop the chicken. You get paste. Also, avoid cheap soy sauce. I did both of the above and it was terrible, salty mush. So it was all my fault, I will try this one again. so the lost star is because of me.

I doubled oyster sauce because I didn’t have fish sauce on hand. This was superb. Served over rice with Spicey Eggplant from this site. Definitely going in the rotation. Will serve to dinner guests in the near future.

I made this for my husband, and followed the recipe exactly. He loved it, and so did I! Since I work as a personal chef, I made it the next week for my boss, and he raved about it. This will become a part of my regular menu rotation!

Very tasty. However I used 1 1/2 jalapeno peppers - not spicy at all. Will try again with serrano.

followed recipe as given, except for the pepper. needed to use a hotter pepper (used a jalepeno), felt like it needed more heat to off set the saltiness.

Was ok. Not exceptional but will probably make it again because it's healthy and easy to make. Substituted boneless skinless chicken breast, which probably cut  back on some flavor

Tried this yesterday and enjoyed!  Did not have fish sauce and chili peppers.  







Tried this yesterday and really enjoyed it.  Didn't have fish sauce nor chili peppers.  I added some finely chopped red pepper  and some chili flakes. Next time I will try chopping the partially thawed chicken by cubing it and pulsing it in the processor.  Maybe using cauliflower rice.  Husband nixed that  idea.  LOL

Overall, we really liked this dish, but I plan on increasing the heat when I make it again.  I would definitely recommend using the hottest peppers that you like and increasing the volume of those a bit.  I also added a bit more soy sauce near the end to help the glaze.

We live in a small town so Thai chilis aren’t available.  I substituted jalapeños and added a bit of crushed red pepper and a teaspoon of Thai curry paste.  Family loved it.

Using basil almost daily, I made this with Thai basil and I sensed that this basil is the most influencing flavor for this dish. I also used 4 fresh Thai chilies from my own plants and that did it for me. I will make this again

Followed recipe  (chopping my own chicken) and agree that it  is overall good, but too salty for my taste. My DH, who enjoys more salt that I, said that it is salty. I will make again, simply reducing soy and chicken base used for broth. We served with sriracha. Thank you.

Interesting taste, a bit too salty with the fish sauce added to low sodium soy sauce 
Could add some brocoli or carrots to liven up this dish and add crunchiness

Loved this! Made exactly as directed. Except the store didn’t have fresh basil in March so I used something in the fresh herb/produce section called “lightly dried basil” by Gourmet Garden.  I went in with low expectations but this stuff was amazing. Being pre-chopped, I was able to just dump a tablespoon or two in at the end of the recipe and the flavor (and smell) was fresh and delicious.

This was terrific. I didn't have the fish sauce so I went without and I'm very happy that I did. The oyster sauce was enough but I believe that I even cut the oyster sauce down by half. Great recipe that my wife loved.

I tried this recipe the other night for dinner.  My husband and I loved it.  The recipe was simple to follow, but unfortunately I had to use a few different ingredients because I could not find all that were listed.  I used Serrano chilies in place of the Thai chilies and regular basil for the Thai basil.  Not having tasted the recipe with all the original ingredients, I thought my version was very flavorful & yummy.  The third thing I did differently was doubled the recipe.  Once you make this you may double or triple the recipe, that's how good it is.

Really easy to make. A bit spicy for my daughter but my husband and I really enjoyed the dish. I used ground chicken which sped up prep work a bit and kept the dish lean.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS. The fried egg on top not only made it more visually interesting, but the yolk was so yummy mixed into this rice. Prep time for me was nowhere near 15 minutes. It took me about an hour to cut eveything up. I'm not sure how hot his range gets, but on my electic stove on 8, even with the chicken in crumbles once I added the liquid it didn't carmelize quickly like his did. So by the time it evaporated and finally carmelized my chicken was a bit crunchy and overcooked. I'll have to figure out a way to tweak that.

This was absolutely delicious ! I used serrano peppers and used more than the recipe called for because I like my food pretty spicy.  That was the only thing I altered. I will be adding this as one of my go to dishes. It was quick and soooo good!

It was a great dish and very easy to make it.  I ended up using ground chicken since it was all I had in my freezer and it was perfect.  I also did not use the fish sauce. I will make it again.

Really great as is.  I had to freeze the meat for more than an hour, as all I had to chop it was a large knife, and that was still a royal pain, but seemingly worth it.  I used a stainless steel saucepan and had the heat (gas) at medium because I almost never cook on high heat.  My mistake, this really is a quick cooking dish; go for high heat from the get go. I also only used about a third of 1 small jalapeño (didn't take seeds out) and that was plenty hot for my family (they are not fans of spice however).  Also, don't omit the egg on top; makes it truly awesome! Very quick to prepare and make, great recipe.

Wow, really really good! I got a little carried away with the hot peppers, but still loved it despite spiciness. I spent a lot of time trying to remove fatty parts from the thighs and in hindsight should not have bothered. The fine chopping of the chicken makes that unnecessary. I will definitely make this again and look forward to making my next chef John recipe!

A...MAZ...ING! But how the heck is this over 700 calories per serving??!!! Where are the calories coming from?? Anyway, I’m so glad I didn’t skimp and use dried basil because the regular basil infused such flavor into the dish and what elevates it. I found 1-2c was sufficient.  I also used Serrano pepper on hand. At first, husband was very put off by the fish sauce complaining it smells like feet but devoured the final dish and we are making it again in larger quantity tomorrow! Delicious!

Was very good, but was just basically sauced-meat on top of rice.  Next time, I will add vegetables such as bok choy, broccoli, cauliflower, etc., to make it less boring.  I would also make extra sauce because the final dish wasn't very saucy.  I used a jalapeno and serrano pepper with a few seeds - the spice level was very mild. Next time I will use more peppers.

This recipe is so delicious! I’ve tried it either requested Thai Basil and Thai Chili’s. Very good but in the spicy side with every bite. My local grocery stores sells Thai chilies which surprised me, but I did have to go to the Asian store for the basil. Not to worry if you do t have a nearby Asian store. This recipe is still outstanding with regular Sweet Basil and a Serrano chili. In fact for my taste, I prefer the Serrano over the Thai chili. I used 1 pepper with seeds and it had a taste my spice to it, but over powering. My entire family loves this recipe. Thanks!

Very good. Followed the recipe.  My chicken was simply cut up into small pieces. I added mushrooms at the end simply because I didn’t want to dirty another pan. Great add. I need to add the shallots and garlic later because they burned quickly.

We enjoyed this and I will make it again, but with a couple of changes. First I doubled just the sauce ingredients and next time I will double everything excluding the chicken.  Also I will use more serrano or a different, spicier pepper.  Regular basil was good, but I'm going to try to find Thai Basil next time.

Because I did not check my supplies before beginning to cook, I had to make a few emergency substitutions (jalapenos and ground cayenne for heat, supplementing scant reserves of fresh basil with fresh mint and cilantro, and brown rice for jasmine rice), it still wound up being delicious. The combination of basil, mint, and cilantro may actually have been better than basil alone. It's worth noting that the recipe, as written, yields 3-4 servings, not 2, so plan accordingly.

It's good.  I made it exactly as written. It felt like it needed something when I was eating it, so I threw on a few salted, roasted peanuts. I liked it better then. Not sure if I'll make it again. I love Thai food, but there are better Thai dishes. One reviewer said they added broccoli. I can see where that would also improve it.

Pretty good! I think the instructions should mention that the "juicy-ness" of the ingredients could prolong the cooking process. At the second to last step, Caramelizing for me took about 10 minutes, If I had taken the 1 to 2 minute suggestion my pate would of been both fishy and salty like some other users complained, maybe that was their problem?.......oh and its 4 stars for me because I would prefer more spices!

I finally found an Asian recipe that turns out like I expected! I used 1 1/2 lbs of boneless thighs so I adjusted the ingredients as such. Per other reviews I only used 1 tsp fish sauce and used regular basil. Served on rice. Big hit!

Delicious!  Thank you Chef John for the great recipes!  I've tested more than 10 of Chef John's creations and they are all pretty good!  I omitted the white sugar and used just the brown sugar also added asparagus spears to this dish.

I don't normally rate recipes but this turned out so good and was so easy that i feel compelled.  Very yummy.  

I chopped the chicken thighs pretty chunky (small strawberry sized) which i think turned out well.  Moist substantial bites, not dominated by sauce.

I used serrano (sp?) peppers because i couldn't find "thai" peppers.  Second choice, but it was a perfect accent of heat and not too hot.

Awesome meal.  I need to get a new knife so I can chop it a bit finer.  And I was only able to find regular basil, but it was fragrant and really tasty.  Everyone at the table loved it.

I made this following the recipe but did add chopped green beans and bell pepper for extra  veg which I just cooked first to slight caramelization and then cont the recipe. 

I've cooked with fish sauce before but never oyster sauce. The sauce smelled unappealing and when cooked it permeated my household. It tasted fine but not as complex as our favorite thai place (I just had this dish last weekend so wanted to try it on my own). It just smelled so strongly that it was difficult to enjoy. This recipe was ok, and I'm glad that my fave thai joint beat it. I want to know I am paying for something!

Chef John, your recipes never fail me. I thought the seasoning was PERFECT. Who wants bland food?? I used lean ground chicken, which made it seem somewhat healthy, and it didn't take away from the flavour at all. I also happened to have some Thai basil and Thai chilies on hand, so I used those instead. I, then, topped each serving with a fried egg - and let me tell you, the runny yolk really takes this dish to the NEXT LEVEL. I'll definitely be making this over and over again. Love, love, LOVE!

I have made many times. So good. Use regular basil, usually double sauce because it is terrific. Omit the rice and serve steamed broccoli on side for a healthier choice. Highly recommended.

This was a way to use up some Thai basil that came in a seed kit. It was ok, but I think the problem was I should have drained the fat from the chicken before adding the rest of the ingredients, the recipe doesnt mention  that, and I think that's why I never got that glaze effect. I would make it again if I have a bunch of Thai basil, otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way.

This was fantastic. My family has a strong aversion to fish sauce so I replaced it with hoisin to rave reviews.

I attempted to double this recipe.  For starters this does not double well (would reduce amount of oil and maybe sauce).  Second if using Thai chilis instead of Serrano it defiantly gets spicy fast.  I am not sure I would use 1/4 cup (doubled) of Thai chilis.  I also had Holy Basil so I used that in place of Italian basil.  All in all this still really turned out good.

Wow!  Absolutely loved it.  I didn't change a thing.  Can't wait until garden green beans come in, they will make the perfect addition to this dish.  Thanks so much Chef John!

It was good and easy.  Liked it better with a little sriracha. Also, we added green beans - it would have been pretty plain with just meat and sauce.   Make again.

Fast and easy. Although I would have liked it spicier. I think my Serrano peppers were not ripe.

It was a very good dish...I followed the recipe for the most part but I had only jalapeno peppers on hand. I'm assuming it would have been more spicy if I used the peppers from the recipe. I did shred some carrot and savory cabbage thinking it needed a some vegetables.
