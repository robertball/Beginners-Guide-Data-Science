This recipe is definitely a keeper! I think it is incredibly easy, fast, and inexpensive considering I'm just a college student. Definitely purchase some sole when it's in season (as I did). I had to adjust the amount of ingredients used because sole can be an extremely thin fish, so I purchased more than the 2 fillets which the recipe calls for.   I used a white wine that I knew was delicious and actually left out the thyme because I didn't want to spend money on two herbs.  GREAT recipe.

My version is a little different. I still had sole but my tomatoes were canned, my leeks were onions, No wine, I used the tomato juice off the diced tomatoes. No thyme but I did have fresh cilantro. I served mine over basmati rice. For the purest that doesn't think changing a recipe makes for a good review I believe it just goes to show how versatile this recipe really is.

Yum!  I used thin slices of flounder and cooked for 5 minutes.  I also didn't have any dill or thyme, so I used this "Asian Seafood Seasoning" that I had on hand (from Whole Foods).  Plus I used onions instead of leeks.  I served it with butternut squash torellini.  It was fabulous.  My 2 year old even liked it!

This is definately a keeper!  I used Tilapia because I couldn't find fresh sole, and used canned tomatoes because I had those already.  It was delicious!  Thanks!!  Plus it gave me an excuse to buy some wine..

I thought this was tasty with a couple of minor tweaks.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so used 1 can of diced tomatoes which I drained the juice off of.  Family doesn't like dill, so I substituted 1 tsp of cumin, which we love.  Also added a pinch of salt, white pepper and a small dash of cayenne just to give it a little kick.  Very easy, quick and the family (including the 3 YO) loved it.

This was a really nice dish!  I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used canned, but it still turned out great.

Not bad. The leeks were a little bit strange with the other flavors, and the fish didn't look very appetizing either. This isn't something I'll be making again, but thanks anyway!

Simply the best. I did add a German spice, 1 TBL Tomatengewurz. But it would have been great  even without it.

I doubled the recipe because I had guests over for dinner.   The finished dish did need more seasoning.   I think what changes I need to make next time is to season the fish with salt, freshly ground pepper and garlic powder to give it more flavor.  Because once I add the sole fillets over the veggies, the extra seasoning can mix in with the entire dish as well.  I also think I needed to boil/simmer the wine down a little more.   I will try this again, but with adjustments of course.

Easy and really good. I used canned diced tomatoes and red onion instead of leeks, because that's what I had at home. Fish came out very good and tender. Sauce was delicious. Served over wild rice mix with veggies.

It was very bland, needed salt and perhaps other seasoning. Maybe more wine would help.

Super easy and quick. I omitted the dill because I don't like it and substituted vermouth for the wine because that is what I had on hand.

This was easy to make, flavorful & the fish was tender & flakey. Everyone in my family liked it. I served it with couscous & it was a perfect combo.

This was awesome. I too used canned tomatoes, which I think extended the time it took for the sauce to reduce because of the extra liquid. I also halved the herbs, as I tend to get overwhelmed by the amounts of thyme and dill people use in fish recipes. I used salmon, since that was what I had. Even with all these convenient little changes, this was a spectacular meal with the kind of creative use of leeks that I like :)
