I will never, ever make this again. It smelled like cat food, and had a weird smoky/sour flavor. Not good.

Ok, so this is a great base recipe for great things... Here is what I did to it. I used olive oil instead of veggie oil. I added a small can of crushed pineapple, (I think some mango slices would have been yummy too) a yellow bell pepper. I diced chicken breasts and cooked them and used them instead of caned junk. and used low carb tortillas and put the yummies in the tortillas, put some shredded lettuce, sour cream, cheese, and avocado on top. this was amazing! My family loved it!

This is awesome! Can't tell it's low fat. I made some changes to make it even healthier for you. I substituted the vegetable oil for fat free butter to sautee the onions in. I also used 96% fat free mission tortillas.I put in 1/4th t. of garlic powder, though you could probably go 1/2 t. if you like garlic. I added some light sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes to go inside making this dish very tasty and filling!

It's just not good at all. My husband said the chicken smelled like cat food, and it has a strange smokey/sour flavor.
