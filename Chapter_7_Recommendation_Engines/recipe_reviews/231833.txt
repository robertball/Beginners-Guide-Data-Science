I loved the way these flavors sounded but I was looking for a cold side, so I mixed all the spices with a mayo/sour cream combo added a bit of sugar and vinegar and the result totally wow'd my BF and myself.  Super yummy cajun flavors! Great with BBQ chicken

Loved this as I love spicy foods, but next time will slightly turn down the heat by reducing amount of chili pepper. I didn't have cayenne so used red pepper flakes. Will be making this often with garden fresh cabbage. For color may add red and yellow peppers

Well, first off, my finished product looked nothing like the picture so don't expect it to.  This is really  spicy cooked cabbage and onions so don't think of it as a cold crunchy slaw.  It's not.  However, that being said,we loved it.  I would make a few modifications.  I followed recipe exactly but found with the small head of cabbage I did not need all the spices.  I used about 3/4 of mixed spices and would cut down to about half that or cut up more cabbage.  I also liked the sauted onions and since the whole thing is cooked eventually anyway, I would used a larger onion with the same small head of cabbage.  Otherwise, this was a great way to make something we don't eat alot of but like - cabbage.  It's a nice change from the regular round of cooked veggies.  I paired this with red beans and rice and center cut boneless pork chops rubbed with Creole seasoning (like Tony Chachere's)and it was like the Cajun version of a german pork and cabbage meal!

Spicy Cajun Cabbage Haiku: "Barely kept this down. We like it hot in this house. But this was 'gritty.'" I made the entire seasoning blend, but only used half of it in the dish, and even used more than the suggested 5-ish c. of chopped cabbage, but this was nearly edible due to the "grittiness" of all of those dried spices. Thank goodness for the plain buttered egg noodles that I made to serve this over b/c they helped cut some of the spice and grit. Every bite, while super-spicy, was like eating on the beach w/ sand blowing in your mouth. I'm just glad that it was a cheap meal to make so I didn't mind tossing the leftovers.

This was delicious! My husband even said that it was the first time he'd ever had cabbage that he hadn't hated! Two of my three kids really liked it too. I found the spice mix to be a little spicy and next time would not put in as much cayenne and chilli, and I didn't use all of the spice mix either. I used about 1/2 of it. To counter the over-spiciness, I added some cream at the end of cooking, and it made it lovely and creamy.

My husband and I loved it. Reminded us of a pad Thai type recipe. Spice was perfect. We've used the spice combo on a number of other dishes.

I  made this but I changed it a little bit. I  added saut√©ed celery, carrots,fresh garlic and onion. I  added extra  chili powder since I didn't have any other spicy ingredient. I also added soy sauce and cooked  seasoned chicken  breast . Instead  of using butter I just used olive oil. This was super delish. I'll are this again for sure.

Absolutely delicious!  I love hot and spicy and I used hot Hungarian paprika but only 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I also doubled the butter at 4 tablespoons.   Came out with a slight crunch to the cabbage and extremely flavorful!

having read the reviews before making this i figured i'd just halve the seasonings but unfortunately it was still too strong.. i started out by adding a dash or two of both worcestershire and white wine vinegar.. and then added some soy sauce and lemon to make it more palatable.. i'm so sad b/c i had higher hopes for this

This is a really, really good recipe.  After reading the other reviews I cut down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.  I like spice but I can't have much. :)  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!

I love this! I added garlic powder and lime juice for some tang and it kicked it up a notch! Oh and more butter, can never have enough butter.

I've been trying to search for a recipe that spice up my cabbage. This is the best recipe I've ever found. I make this at least once a week and my family loves it!

This is a pretty solid side dish. A little spicy for some I imagine but the spice blend works well .  I followed the directions very close (for me) and my dish looked like the photo pretty much, still with some texture in the cabbage. If you get a bad smell, you over-cooked it.
Then why not a higher rating? It is just missing something to elevate it to another level. Two dimensional if you will. What? I'm not sure maybe thin sliced turkey neck or the old faithful bacon. I like Carolyn's idea. Worth taking your own spin on it, I will
By the way, the leftovers will make an excellent Mexican slaw by adding oil, vinegar and course pepper.

I made this recipe for 4 people.  Easy to follow and tasted absolutely amazing!  A great side to the black eyed peas we were having!
As I am a calorie counter, my dish worked out at 113cals per serving.  For the more main ingredients I used 240g Yellow Onion and 465g of Savoy Cabbage.  Hope this helps!

Fantastic!  I threw in some thin sliced sauted chicken and made it a meal.  Next time I'd reduce the amount of cumin slightly.

I halved the spicy seasoning.  I had to add a little water to make the seasoning less powdery.  It was good
