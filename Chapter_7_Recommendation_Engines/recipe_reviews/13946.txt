My husband and I used to live in Indonesia and loved the peanut sauce there.  This recipe is the most authentic one I've found.  I used natural peanut butter and it was delicious.  I substituted regular soy sauce for the tamari and left out the basil.  It was very easy to make and delicious reheated.  I will make this on a regular basis.

This is a great recipe. I used 1 can of coconut milk instead of the water and Hunan Red Chili sauce instead of the jalapeno. It was delicious. Better than any Thai restaurant I have eaten at. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the best sauce.  I used a 1/2 tsp powdered ginger and regular soy sauce because I did not have fresh ginger or tamari sauce.  I also used only a 1/4 of a pepper to reduce the heat for my kids.  If it seems too spicy after that just add a little more honey!  I also but mine in the blender after it was all combined so that it was completly smooth and then finished heating. My family wanted more, we will be having it again very soon.  Tastes like the restaurant.  VEy good over chicken, rice and veggies.

Very good as a base for my thai chicken pizza.  I did alter the recipe with other user's recommendations.  First, instead of the water, I substituted a can of coconut milk.  Second,  I added a few tablespoons of rice vinegar. By necessity, I used cayenne pepper instead of jalapeno and omitted the basil (out of season).  Fourth, by choice, I upped the amount of fresh garlic and ginger (would definitely recommend this alteration).  I would note that this sauce only improves with time - after a week of sitting in the fridge, the sauce reheated perfectly and the taste was more well-rounded.  Would recommend.

I added 1.5 tablespoons of vinegar, and it was great. I like to use it for a dipping sauce, and for a noodle sauce.

No vinegar in this peanut sauce; I don't mind it either way, but some people prefer with or without.  Reduces the bite.  Still quite a good peanut sauce.  I replaced the jalenpeno with chili oil without a problem.  This recipe requires cooking the peanut sauce somewhat, which makes it slower than some cooking-free peanut sauces, but it's still quite rapid.

This was very good.  I made it with green onion and cayenne pepper because that's what I had on hand.  I don't normally make changes to a recipe the first time I make it, but I was jonesing for peanut sauce and had to make do with what I had.  But, the results were yummy. Just enough spice and kick for my taste.  Will definitely make again.

I LOVE peanut sauce and have tried many of them. This is one of my favorites. The basil adds a great thai flavor.

I could eat this by the spoonful. First I put it over chicken and brown rice.... So good!  I used peanut oil instead of the veg oil.  I made a minimal version of pad with the leftovers.  Awesome awesome awesome!!!!

Great recipe.  As with others, I added some rice vinegar, and doubled the garlic and ginger.  Was worried that it was going to be soupy, but it thickend pretty quickly.

I didn't cook the onions and garlic, I just put them in the sauce raw because I wanted the bite the fresh onions/garlic give the sauce.  I used Better Than Peanut Butter to reduce the calories a bit and Sriracha instead of jalapeno.  This sauce was delicious!  Thanks so much for the post, Mary!

Delicious. I used sugar instead of honey and chunky peanut butter - because that's all I had. Ate it on Thai Chicken Wraps.

I've been making this Peanut Sauce for a few years. I've tried others but always come back to this one. I substitute cayenne powder instead of Jalapeno pepper and always use fresh ginger. Thanks for a great recipe.

I really enjoyed this sauce it's not too sweet, and as the sauce sits it takes on a whole new flavor. I used 1/4 cup of coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil. I didn't have any ginger so I used 1/2 teaspoon or dried ginger. The only onions I had on hand were some shallots. S I used 2. It turned out wonderfully!

QUite possibly the best I have ever had! Take the advice the previous reviews say: USE COCONUT MILLK INSTEADOF WATER!!!
I didn;t even try it with water but I know it couldn't have come out as good ! Such a swwt creamy texture! I just grilled some chicken tenders and that was it ! Dinner was done!!

Excellent recipe!  I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, low sodium soy sauce instead of tamari, and added a few splashes of rice vinegar.  Yummy!

Flavor was great!!! I used curry and coconut milk in addition to everything else so the spice was very nice.  The consistency was a little too thick though.  Also, don't use as much oil as it calls for, there is enough of that in the peanut butter. Overall, very tasty.

This was phenomenal! I had a guest over for dinner and he commented several times on how good it was. The only variations were that I used two jalapeno's instead of one and the sauce was really oily so I poured some of the oil off the top. I used this sauce with the recipe 'chicken satay with homemade peanut sauce' because I liked the look of this sauce better. I'll definately be making this again.

It was a tasty sauce.  The soy sauce had a bit too much of a presence for me.  I would decrease that to about 1/8 cup, and use the coconut milk instead of water so the sauce would have a richer taste.  Overall, it was good.

I was craving authentic chicken with peanut sauce and this recipe delivered! Trying to stay true to the recipe, the only substitution I made was substituting olive oil for the vegetable oil.

I have been looking for a good peanut butter sauce, ended up finding an amazing one here!! When I made it I didn't have any basil or ginger on hand, but the sauce was still amazing without it!! I added it to a chicken stir fry, chicken wraps and as a sauce for chicken wontons... Trying to figure out what else to put it on... Love, love, LOVE it!!

This was not what I expected - the 1/4 C. of soy sauce made this the color of brownie dough and so was not attractive at all.  The taste was just so so.  I will search for other recipes.

We love this peanut sauce. Looking forward to having it with chicken satay over soba noodles with peas tonight.  This is definitely a keeper; I know I will be using it again; I am catering a cocktail party soon and plan to have chicken satay with this sauce on the menu! Thanks for the recipe!

This was so tasty and easy to make!  Love it with shrimp over brown rice.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I bought crunchy peanut butter.  Came out awesome.

This was really good.  I followed the recipe using chunky peanut butter and loved the consistency.  We had it as the base for Thai Chicken Pizza with Carrots and Cilantro.

I have made this sauce a dozen times and LOVE it!  I use a bit more onion and garlic, and coconut milk instead of water.  I also omit the jalapeño.  After it cooks and cools I put it in my food processor and puree it so it's really smooth, which I like better than chunky.  I have received many compliments on this when serving it at parties with chicken skewers.  Delicious!

I made a few modifications: only used 1/2 c. onion, 1 t. ground ginger instead of ginger root, substituted soy sauce for the tamari.  My new husband, who has been eating authentic Asian cuisine for many years, really enjoyed it.

I like it. Made this for the first time and it’s a really large batch for just me and my husband. I made it as directed and it was good but I would like a little more spice to it. Next time I will halve the recipe and try adding a bit more jalapeño.

Fantastic! I used this as a base to make the sauce for Thai chicken pizza. Ah mazing. Can't wait to try it on some home made pad thai.

This is excellent. Left out the jalapeño because I wasn't in the mood for spicy. Served it over rice noodles and vegetables. Will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic! Only thing I changed was Sweet Chili Sauce instead of jalapeños. Used it as a dressing on a soba noodle salad with shrimp. Delicious!

Delicious! Super thick and flavorful. I might run it through the blender to make it nice and smooth, it’s a little bit chunky.

I made this recipe as directed, except that I used less oil to cook the onion. It was wonderful. If it is not spicy enough for you, you can drizzle in some hot sauce or chilli oil.

This was so good!  It will replace my previous peanut sauce recipe.  My husband called it "restaurant quality."  I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand (used 1/4 tsp. dried ginger instead of fresh and omitted basil) and personal taste (added red wine vinegar and omitted jalepeno for a no heat version.)  I ended up with twice as much sauce as I needed.  Hopefully, it freezes well!

Phenomenal!!!  I added grilled shrimp and served over coconut rice. Big hit and scored me major brownie points with the Mrs. For her mother's day dinner with her folks.  I'll be serving this again at our next dinner party
