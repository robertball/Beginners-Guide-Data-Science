This was a zip to make, and it had a comforting flavor. I added black pepper and a few other spices to zest up the broth. Next time I will use less butter and increase the amount of spinach.

This is a wonderful soup that's quick and easy to make. I usually add a bit more garlic because I enjoy garlic. I've doubled and tripled this recipes with no problem. Don't be tempted to increase the amount of dry pasta - the amount doesn't seem like a lot but when cooked, it's proportionate to everything else. Oh, and I use prewashed baby spinach leaves so I add those in at the very end because they require very little cooking and this way they stay a nice emerald green. I highly recommend this soup. Thank you for posting it.

Made this soup to go with my roast beef sandwiches.  So good.  Did exactly as recipe said and had plenty for 6 servings.  Need to stir up the contents so everyone gets plenty of pasta and beans.  (Did use the 2 cans of beans rather than a cup and a half.)

This is a REALLY easy recipe, and rather tasty for being so simple. I did doctor it up a bit w/ a pinch of basil, a pinch of red pepper and added more garlic than what was called for. Served with a salad and a half sandwhich= EXCELLENT and healthy lunch. Served w/ homemade soda bread sprinkled w/ parmasean, and it's a great light dinner. I will make this again!

This was alright.  I did not have fresh spinach on hand to add, and we do not have access to ditalini pasta here, the closest is rigatoni.  However, I added sauteed chicken pieces and a few additional spices (chili powder, fresh pepper, celery powder).  It was good, I will probably try to modify it a little more next time.

This recipe is delicious and has a surprisingly full flavor for being so simple, light, and easy.  I have three young children and they loved it too-we will definitely have this again.  I doubled the recipe & added a little white pepper & ground peppercorns to spice it up, as well as increased the amount of spinach.

My family LOVES this recipe. Only thing I changed was I added more garlic cause we are garlic freaks and I had a can of garbanzo beans so I threw it in and it worked perfect. I make it all the time and am so happy fall is here so I can make it more. Thank you

Very easy to make.  I added some Italian sausage with the onions to cook and add a bit of flavor.  Also added some Italian seasonings and chili powder.  At the end while the soup is heating through, I added a cup of cooked rice.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Delicious.

As is, there is no flavor or body!  I added Pesto, doubled the beans, including black beans, doubled spinach and tomatoes, added some black and red pepper.  Yes I would say healthy overall, but would recommend using low sodium chicken broth :)

Very good for such a quick soup.  I found there was enough salt in the broth so I didn't add any more--that was my only "change."  You could definitely add more spices or ingredients, but it's great as written.

DELICIOUS. I used red kidney beans, canned spinach, and macaroni, because that's what I had on hand. I also used extra garlic and spinach. I will definitely be making this again.

I loved this very easy recipe.  The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth so my vegetarian daughter could eat it.

this soup was very very good!! I added the full can of tomatoes and the full can of beans with my soup because I like my soup thicker. I also added about a half cup of extra chicken broth. I did not have any small pasta on hand so I used whole wheat egg noodles and broke them up to add into the soup. This soup turned out very good and is very goos for you :) The spinache gives it a great flavor!! I will make this again! Easy good & simple!

Loved this soup!! I used some left over 16 bean soup for the beans (made the beans yesterday and hated to waste food) and added half a pound of ground sweet Italian Sausage.  I used frozen spinich as well. I will make this again!! May even make a batch to share with the elderly shut-ins at church this Winter.

WOW! This is one of the easiest and most tastiest soups I have had/made in a long time. I made it exactly as written, except that I doubled it and would NOT change a thing! It literally only took 20 mins. from start to finish! Who knew that such simple ingredients could produce such a wonderful, flavorful soup! I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
