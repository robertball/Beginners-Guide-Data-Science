Really tasty, but I found the almonds were a little soggy after being refrigerated overnight. Try toasting them just before serving and sprinkling them on top of the cheescake as you serve it up!

Very very tasty!  I noticed the crust was alittle soggy when it was cooling but once it was refrigerated it hardened up!  Will definitly make this more often.  I added a strudel topping to give it that extra gourmet look.

First, as other reviewers have noted, the crust and filling need to be doubled. I made the recipe "as written," and can confirm that there isn't enough of either. Despite the filling problem, the flavor is exceptional. We used Honeycrisp apples, which is astoundingly good. There is one major problem with the way this recipe is written: It's not clear if the apples are added prior to baking and baked, as in a pie, or added *after* as a topping, like most *cheesecake* recipes. I didn't bake the apples and the recipe was still great, but may have been better, had they been baked (though that may have prevented the filling from being baked properly or on-time).  With this issue addressed in the directions and with greater volume on the crust and filling, this recipe is probably a "5."

FOLLOW UP: I made this a second time and increased the filling and crust. I also used the next largest spring-form pan and added one additional apple. With the additional ingredients, I had to increase baking time to 50 minutes. My neice said this is in the top five of best foods SHE'S EVER HAD. It was (past tense) pretty good.

Easy and soooo yummy.  It was the first dish gone at a ladies meeting I took it to.  Definately would make it again and maybe double the recipe for a 9 x 13.

I wanted something different from apple pie but like apple pie. And this was it. I used Grany Smith apples which gave a nice sweet and sour effect. I agree with other viewers, the cheesecake filling should needs to be doubled.

This was a total hit! I liked the simplicity of the recipie a lot. I agree with the other reviews, I will increase the quantity for more crust (mine only  made it partway up the side of the pan) and I think the addition of struedel topping would make this sensational.

I made this today along with my own Peach Cheese Cake.  Your recipe inspired me to add nuts to my crust.  Thanks for such a great recipe

This cheesecake was pretty good!  I used some of the helpful hints and made a couple additions to the original recipe.  I doubled the crust which has an excellent flavor.  I also doubled the cheesecake filling.  That was a good because it made it a little thicker.  I added a crumble topping and a little bit of almond glaze on top of the apples. I baked it for about 55 mins and it did need to be in the oven a little longer, but it was fine to eat.  Overall it was very yummy!

I served this at a holiday gathering--it was a hit and a couple of people even asked for the recipe. I found that a 9" ceramic tart pan with 1 1/2" straight sides was a perfect size for this recipe. You don't even have to take it out of the pan but it would be advisable to run a knife around the sides right after it has baked. I didn't and it took a little chisling to get the pieces out! I used a combination of Wolf River and Macintosh apples and they cooked up well. I also elimated the almonds sprinkled on top for a smooth-textured dessert.

I served this to guests and though it was okay, nobody raved. The main problems in my opinion are that the apples don't get enough cooking time to soften (anyway with my interpretation of "thinly sliced) and the slivered almonds feel like you got a piece of apple core in your mouth whenever you encounter one. Also, there was a lot of juice from the apples which mixed into the cheesecake mixture, causing the texture to lose it's creaminess. I don't think I'll make this again.

I made this for my adult Sunday school class and I could not cut it fast enough to serve everyone.  I did not end up getting a piece, but I managed a few crumbs.  It was very tasty and those who had a piece tell me it was excellent.

I'm not a fan of nuts so I omitted the nuts on top and used the crust from the Apple Cheesecake recipe on here.  The apple topping looked better on this one but it was awesome.  I took it to a Sunday School social and it was one of the most talked about deserts.

I didn't have a springform pan so I used a deep dish pie dish and trippled the filling recipe for two pies.  I thinly sliced the granny smith apples with the pampered chef apple peeler corer and cut the spiral into quarters making the apple prep super easy. :D

I didn't like the almonds on top, didn't like that it was such a small amount of dough for the crust. I wish I had read the reviews before. It is still baking in the oven, I hope it turns out ok.

I have made this cheesecake at least 15 times!  It is a HUGE hit.  The one thing I changed was I doubled up the filling and sometimes the crust.  The thin layer it originally creates is just not enough!!

Delicious! I didn't have almonds or almond extract on hand, so I just used an extra 1/2 cup flour and vanilla in the crust. I did not sprinkle almonds on top, either. It turned out GREAT and I don't think i will use almonds next time I make this.

This recipe was great.  It did turn out thinner than I wanted too.  I would add more of the ingredients to make the crust.  My crust did not make it up the sides, only on the bottom.  I made this for a bake sale and it went fast!

I made this for Open Class sorry to say  that I didn't place the judges said that it tasted burnt.  During baking I couldn't get it to set up so it baked with the peanut butter and jelly cheesecake. It taste really good. I will try this one again for the holidays.

While it was good with the fresh apple slices, I found them to be a little underdone; so the next time I will either pre-cook them a little or make it with cherries instead.  The crust was great and would make a good cookie all by itself.

I have made this cheesecake dozens of times.  After the first time, I decided to double the filling and chop the apples instead of slicing them.  That made this cheesecake easier to cut and eat.  I use macadamia nuts instead of almonds.  This is the same recipe submitted to Taste of Home by Ann Wandler (Camrose, Alberta) that won a runner-up prize in the cheesecake competition featured in the December/January 1999 edition.  I have been making it ever since.  It gets raves everywhere.

It was just kind of odd. My husband wouldn't touch it.  The crust was very dry (as I suspected when making it), and the almond flavor was a bit overwhelming.  I will probably not try this recipe again.

I made it for a Christmas tea in a cupcake tin and mini cupcake tin. Most people went with the minis since there were several other choices. Wasn't sure how popping them out would go but it worked perfectly! I forgot about adding the slivered almonds before serving (I waited so they didn't get soggy as someone suggested) but I had added a crumble topping as someone else suggested and the almonds weren't too missed! My only complaint its I wished the cheesecake layer was a little thicker. Will try to make more of it next time. But it was delicious and I will make it again!!
