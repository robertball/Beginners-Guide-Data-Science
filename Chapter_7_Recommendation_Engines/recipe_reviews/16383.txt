Great recipe, with ONE exception: I initially followed the directions to whisk the flour/eggs then add the wet ingredients, but this left me with VERY lumpy unusable batter. Doing the reverse - mixing the eggs & wet stuff then sifting in the flour - worked way better.

BRILLIANT BASIC CREPES.
This is a scrumptious recipe for thin, delicious German style pancakes. I'm a professional musician and recording artist, and I often find myself in the kitchens of recording studios, trying to make something edible from the staple ingredients studios keep in their kitchens. Well, this recipe is it!!! Everyone has milk, eggs, salt, butter, and flour in their kitchen, and these babies whip up like a charm! Even the batter will keep in the fridge for a few days. Personally, I like to throw in about a third cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of powdered sugar to make them sweet and a little crispy around the edges. Just be sure to put a fresh dab of butter in the pan before pouring the batter each time. I've tried countless pancake/crepe recipes, and nothing really impressed me until this one. I recommend it most enthusiastically!

MMM! best crepe recipe ever! one of my favorite breakfast recipes! I often make an apple cinnamon mixture (fry together 1 tbsp butter, 1 apple chopped fine, a pinch of each cinnamon and nutmeg, and 1 tbsp powdered sugar, until apple pieces are soft.) and roll it inside the crepes! Delicious!

I had a hard time wrapping my brain around the flour + eggs, then other ingredients....so I just did what I always do....wet stuff blended, then dry stuff added to it. They have turned out great every time I have made them. A touch of sugar and vanilla makes great sweet crepes...some pepper and herbs make great veggie crepes. BOTH are great for breakfast! I almost always double or triple this recipe, and it keeps well in the fridge.

super recipe! I live in Europe and got tired of buying the already prepared just add water mixes so I tried this one out! REALLY REALLY easy!
I find a good trick if using a non stick pan is to shake it back and forth with the handle now and then- when the crepe begins to slip back and forth it is done on the primary side so you flip and really quickly do the other side or it gets rubbery.

Wonderful!  Two modifications: 1 t vanilla, and more water until the batter was "crepe" consistency.

Someone tell me what I did wrong please! I prepared the batter from the previous suggestions and it came out beautifully, no lumps, but when I put it in the well-oiled pan, it just turned into scrambled eggs!  I had to throw it out!  It can't be the recipe because all of these reviews, so maybe it was the pan, the spatula.......I don't know!  Help! (SMILE)

I used this recipe for my french class for our Christmas party. I added to it thawed strawberries--whole and sliced, melted semi-sweet chocolate (and some unmelted on top!!), and a frosting consisting of powdered sugar, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract. It was such a hit, there were no complaints and the other teachers who got in on our festivities enjoyed them as well!!!!!

My children love these!
I too added Orange peel and Grand Marnier(SP?).
I also let the batter sit for a couple of minutes after all the ingrediants were mixed together!
We had them with powdered sugar and diffrent flavored jams!

This is easy to make and good for the kids or even the husband to join in and help. I made a lot of this and wrapped it up in foil and glad and put it in the freezer. We used it up during the month. It was a convenient way to have crepes for breakfast without cooking in the kitchen for over half an hour.

These were really easy! I have made crepes before but they never came out this good. I am going to use this recipe over and over.I added a few tablespoons of sugar for a dessert crepe but will leave the sugar out when I use these as shells for manicotti for Christmas! I can't wait!

Delicious!    TIPS FOR SMOOTH, LUMP-FREE BATTER (LEARNED AT SCHOOL :)  1) Add flour to GLASS bowl.  Add salt.  Mix. Make a well in the centre. 2)  Use ONE measuring jug and add/measure the milk & water together!  Add BEATEN egg to this and give it a stir. 3)  Using a WHISK, slowly incorporate the wet ingredients (best if at ROOM TEMP) a little at a time, stirring in small circular movements (your wrist will hurt a little :) 4) Continue adding wet ingredients,  stirring/whisking with whisk, until all the flour is incorporated.   5)  Add melted, room temp butter and stir in.  PERFECTLY SMOOTH. 6)  Cover with plastic wrap and leave for +- 20mins (not essential, but preferable).  Good Luck :)

Love crepes and these were great. My favorite filling is one from my post -war (shortages) childhood in the UK. Squeeze lemon juice on the crepe, sprinkle with a little granulated sugar and roll up. You will be surprised at the wonderful sweet/sour contrasts plus the texture combination of smooth crepe with gritty sugar Yum. I may be a minority of one but just writing this makes my mouth water!

Fantastic, very tasty, very easy crepe recipe!

After many trial runs, I've found a few tweaks to make them even easier and yummier. Add a 1/3 cup of sugar to give the crepes extra sweetness. Mix all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt) together before whisking in the eggs. After adding the eggs, your mixture should be a thick, sticky clump that will probably get trapped between the wires of your whisk. Now pour the melted butter over this clumpy mixture and stir to form a dough-like consistency. Doing this allows you to smooth out your batter and get rid of any lumps. At this point, add a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract for flavor and stir into the dough. Instead of milk, try using half and half or even heavy cream for a richer flavor and slightly thicker crepe. Whatever you choose, be sure to add it to the mixture a splash at a time and stir completely before adding more to ensure that your ingredients will be evenly distributed. The same care should be taken when mixing in the water. I do not recommend altering the ratio of water to milk (or cream), as the crepes tend not to cook as nicely (they become either too puffy or too thin and brittle). The perfectionists out there (I among them... saying it loud and proud!), should remove 1/2 tsp. from the 1/2 cup of water in the recipe to account for the added vanilla extract, though failing to do so does not seem to impact the finished product.

I've made this recipe twice.  First time, I took the advice from another member that said to beat the eggs with the milk and water first. THEN add the flour.  Turned out great.  This time I decided to follow the recipe which is beating the eggs and flour first.  HUGE MISTAKE!  It was like a big glob of goo then did not blend.  Instead it was a watery, chunky mess.  I re-made this the way I did the first time and VOILA!  Perfect.  Remember:  Beat all the wet, then mix in the dry.  :)

Quick and Easy, especially when you have 2 pans going at once!  I just spray a 6 in pan with PAM and when it turns dark brown from the heat I add the very scant 1/4 cup of batter.  I added a tbsp. of sugar and a tsp. of vanilla as I was making dessert crepes. I always make a lot and freeze the extras between layers of waxed paper.   
 My mother's favorite (I make her about 20 of them for her every Mother's day so she has a special breakfast for weeks) is when I make a cream cheese filling (block of softened cream cheese, tsp of lemon juice, lemon zest, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1-2 cups of cool whip, blended) with sliced fresh strawberries that I have coated with sugar to form a syrup. I have also have served chocolate pecan crepes (melted dark chocolate chips with chopped pecans). This makes a very fancy dessert when you offer them both as choices. I actually loved dipping the strawberry crepes into the chocolate!

When I told my husband I was going to make crepes for breakfast, his initial response was "How? We don't have a crepe maker"... as it turns out, you don't need one!!! Amazingly easy and fast meal to make! The only changes I made was I used whole wheat flour as we don't have white in the house, and I added a packet of stevia as I was making them with strawberries and carob chips. All I have to say is YUM!!! I think this will be a staple for years to come! I also used both a frying pan to start and a flat grill to finish. I've never been able to flip things in one piece, so it was just a matter of flipping the pan over and letting gravity do the work- and it made things super fast: Start in the pan, flip & transfer to grill, start another. Move the first to a plate, second to the grill. Add more batter to a pan, fill the first with fruit and such, by the time it was done, the next crepes were ready to move down the assembly line! VERY fast!

I don't know why, but I think this recipe comes together even more easily than "blender crêpes"...maybe because you only have to clean a whisk and a bowl, rather than a blender. I'd never considered starting with just the eggs and flour. Now, I won't do it any other way. I add the liquid when the eggs and flour are starting to get thick, just before they clog up in my whisk. 

I was well into my meal at the 30 minute mark. Hurrah!

As with pancakes and eggs, the secret is really your pan: getting a good cooking surface (not too much fat on it) and the right temperature. Practice makes perfect; as as you do them, you'll get the hang of these things. The French chef who taught me how to make crêpes insisted that you don't need a spatula-you can use your fingers if you're nimble enough. I tend to agree. A splash of liqueur (think Grand  Marnier, though I enjoy using lychee myself) or rum in your batter adds flair to dessert crêpes.

The "icing on the crêpe," so to speak, is that this recipe is so flexible: you can make dessert crêpes, dinner crêpes filled with any number of wonderful things, or even use the recipe as the base for blintzes.

We *love* this recipe!  However, we make it in the blender.  Liquids first, then add the dry.  It's so easy my 12 yr old makes them all the time.

Excellent recipe.  Easy, quick, any filling can be put in.  They also freeze EXTREMELY well.  Just put wax paper between each crepe, wrap with place wrap & use a heavy duty freezer bag.

I don't know what you were thinking saying to combine the eggs and flour to start! That's just bad cooking technique! I started to make these as you said (giving it a chance)and ended up with clumps, even using my hand mixer and adding all the milk and whatnot.... You need to change the instructions to have it make more sense. I'm sure everything combined makes a good crepe but I'm also sure that every experienced cook that has tried this recipe, looks at the instructions and changes them up for themselves and turns out great crepes. I am not going to do that, I'll look for another one.

I make them every Sunday for breakfast.

HOWEVER, YOU NEED TO PUT THE milk in first, then the melted butter, then eggs.
I also add vanilla extract and turn the heat down to like a 4-5 on my stove to keep them from browning.

You can add a little more milk if you like them thiner, like we do.

I put butter on them and sprinkle sugar on them and roll them up. My hubby likes jelly/jam in them.

the trick is to make a well in the flour and put the eggs in there, whisk them and allow the flour to add itself in. it does take some time (and effort). then, slowly add in the milk, like a pour at a time, then the water a pour at a time. dumping it all together will make a lumpy mess. 
The trick to frying (crepes or pancakes) is to have your skillet/griddle HOT and pre-greased (butter, bacon grease, shortening, coconut oil) before even trying to put anything in it. It should be almost smoky, if not smoky, before you pour your batter. You'll never lose that first one if you just let your pan get searing hot first. And be sure you drop another spoon of your greasing agent between each batter pour, and allow it to melt and get hot THEN pour your batter in. Again- it's a time consuming endeavor, but if you want perfection this is the way to go.
Great recipe! Thank you!

I have for years used this to make blintzes.  Warmed cottage cheese mixed with crushed pineapple and sugar makes a great filling.

Very good basic recipe.  Notes and tips though: 1. I recommend adding more milk/water to get a thinner mixture. 2. Being able to spread the batter in the skillet/cooking surface is vital if you want super-thin results. 3. If you end up with lumpy batter run it through a strainer, cheesecloth is too fine and will clog up from the batter alone. 4. I ended up using a large bowl with spout/handle and pouring the batter directly. 5. I would NOT cook the first side for 2 minuets as the recipe says, 20-30 seconds does the trick on mid-high. 6. If your spatula is sticking have a cloth ready to dry it between crepes.  7. If you're sufficiently quick you don't need a spatula to remove the crepe from the pan at the end. 8. Thinner batter yields more crepes than the recipe suggests.   9. De-lish

my favorite crepe recipe.  I made over 200 for a baby shower.  I made them the night before stacked them in groups of 10, covered them with saran wrap and put them in the fridge.  I microwaved the packs of 10 for a couple of seconds before peeling them apart.  So easy.

Very good crepes.  I added all milk to make them fluffier and then cinnamon and powdered sugar.  My children eat them faster then I could make them.  I had to do another batch just so I could taste them.  I also made another double batch up to freeze for those mornings when nothing else will do.

I used this recipe to make crepes for the very first time in my life, and it was wonderful and easy.  Other recipes I've seen (like on FoodNetwork) call for you to put ingredients in a blender and "pulse for 10 seconds."  I'm not going to get out the blender and have to clean all the parts for 10 seconds of preparation!  ha ha  Anyway, I didn't have regular milk on hand, so I used half and half.  The only thing I added to the batter was 2 tablespoons of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to complement the sweet filling I was going to use.  If I were to use a savory filling, such as meat or cheese, I would have used the recipe just as is.  Thanks for making my first experience with crepes a painless one!  I will be posting a photo as well.

These crepes were great!  Very basic, but exactly what I was looking for.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tablespoon sugar.  Then after cooked, we added butter & sprinked on sugar.  My hubby enjoyed these very much!  These are a keeper!  Thanks Jen.

You may not think you can make crepes but you absolutely can! Follow the advice to mix the wet ingredients before slowly whisking in flour. I found that holding the pan in the air as I added the batter gave me more time to spread it around before it set. This has opened up a world of possibility for me and I can't wait to make savory crepes.

I made these this morning. I was looking forward to them...but was terribly disappointed! When adding the eggs to the flour, I had this gross, gluey glob. I quickly added the rest of the ingrediants and although better, too many little floury lumps. And I whipped that batter with a vengence!! I ended up throwing it out and starting over with a recipe I found in my good ole Betty crocker cookbook.I will try other crepe recipes on the site. But I don't recommend this one :-(

This was a fine list of ingredients, but the directions were ridiculous.  I suggest whisking the wet ingredients together first and adding the flour last.  Unless you enjoy prying a snotball of flour and egg out of the middle of your whisk.  I prefer to get to the finished product... I'm hungry.

These are quick and easy to make.  Do, however, mix the wet stuff first, before adding the salt and flour to the liquid.  Otherwise, you end up with a lumpy (but tasty) mess.
I use a cast-iron griddle, over med-low flame, and it is imperative that you roll the griddle around to distribute the batter.  If you do that, you get nice thin, almost see-through, crepes.  The edges curl up when it is time to flip them, and they stay in tact during the flip.
Overall, a great recipe, but the mixing steps are a little off....

I used this recipe to make a crepe cake (I will post a picture soon). Very easy. I just put everything in my blender (liquids first) and blended it up. I left it in the fridge for about 1 hour before using, to let the bubbles settle. I doubled the recipe and it made about 24 small crepes. Will definitely make again!

This is our favorite crepe recipe. It took a time or two to figure out how exactly to make the perfect crepe but you will get it. I had to learn to spread it thin, I can't use soy milk and I needed a perfect size frying pan to create them in.

Also you need to either add all the ingredients and mix, or add all the wet and then sift in the flour. You do NOT want to mix in flour and egg and then add the other ingredients or it will make the batter lumpy. You want it watery!

Also we always add vanilla extract to ours. It gives it a nice flavor.

Was really good! I also suggest changing up the order of the ingredients (wet with wet, and then adding the flour).. I did it as the recipe states and it was really hard to get mixed! Also, I would cut out greasing the pan (especially if you have non-stick pans) because the first one I made was really greasy.
Added a little brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract, then paired with Nutella and fresh fruits to make a tasty dessert!

These were amazing!  I omitted the butter, used rice milk instead of cow milk and added a little more water to get a thinner crepe.  I also added a little granulated sugar since I was making sweet crepes.  Whisking the flour into the liquids avoided any lumps.  They turned out perfectly!  I will definitely make these again!

I had some trouble with lumps in the batter, so I tried "Crepes." That recipe had a much smoother batter, but these taste so much better that I'd rather use it! I used oil instead of butter which is healthier, and made the batter smoother

This was my very first time making crepes, but based on other reviews I made a couple of changes. I mixed the wet ingredients first (made more sense) and I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and about 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar (to me powdered made more sense so that it blends in better). I used almond milk instead of regular, mostly because the regular milk was questionable and I wasn't sure if it was still good. I also sifted the flour as I added it in and I did that in 3 parts. They came out just perfect! Super thin and slightly crispy on the edges. And I didn't have to add more liquid like others had said. Overall, this is a great and easy recipe to use as a base and then customize to your liking.

Our family visited Paris a couple of weeks ago and I think this recipe makes crepes better than most that we tried in Paris! I made the batter the night before and in the morning just took it out of the fridge and thin it up further with about 1/4 cup of milk. This is a trick my French friend told me. Her mom makes great crepes and she always chills the batter for at least an hour and then thin it out further with milk. I haven't tried without doing this so I can't compare, but this method definitely gave me really great crepes. Another notes for those who have trouble with getting lumps after adding the milk to the doughy mixture of flour and eggs: at the beginning just add small amount of milk (maybe 1/4-1/3 cup) at a time and stir until the mixture is smooth. When the mixture is more like liquid than dough you can add the rest of the milk. I used a whisk instead of a hand-held mixer and it took me some work but I did end up with a very smooth batter.  YAY for not having to go to France for great crepes! I am going to make this again this weekend. Can't wait!

Unusable as written! You can NOT mix the eggs and flour first! This leaves you with a wasted clumpy substance. First mix the water, milk and melted butter, gradually sift in the flour, then whip the eggs in a separate bowl, and stir into the mixture. I add 1/3 tsp vanilla for added flavour.

I make this type of crepe quite frequently.  I actually use it as a manicotti shell and fill with ricotta, moz, parm cheese filling.  Place in a pan with pasta sauce to coat the bottom, then pour remaining sauce on top.  Add additional parm chz or moz chz and your guests will love the "homemade" pasta that you created!!

Good basic crepe recipe.  I omit the salt and add vanilla, and I blend all of the ingredients simultaneously, as others have suggested.  Also, I do not turn the crepes; I prefer thinner crepes, so I add enough liquid to make them thin enough so that they cook completely without the need to turn them.  As an aside, the 20 minute cook time in the recipe is a typo--they cook easily within 2 minutes. It's easy to prep AND cook them in 10 minutes total!  For those who have not tried making crepes, it's incredibly easy in a skillet--much easier than the electric crepe makers that require dipping the appliance into the batter.  I had an electric crepe maker and hated making crepes; switching to a non-stick skillet totally changed my attitude.

This recipe was fantastic except I had some problems with the consistency.  It seemed to be too thick.  When I was rolling the pan around, the batter took a long time to reach the edge of the pan so the first couple of crepes cooked before I was able to get the right shape/size.  When it came time to flip, they would fold mid-air, which told me they were too thick and heavy.  To resolve this, I added about 3/4 cup liquid (equal parts milk and water).  This fixed the problem.  They turned out perfectly light and delicious.  I would probably leave the recipe as is if I was making savory crepes rather than sweet.  It would make them more like pancakes and heartier for heavier fillings.  These I served with strawberries and powdered sugar.  I also added some vanilla to the batter (maybe a teaspoon or so).  Perfection!

Hang on. "Whisk flour and eggs together!?" That doesn't work. (Try it--you'll see). Then when you add the liquid, all you get are a bunch of lumps.

WOW! I had no idea crepes were so easy to make! This was the easiest meal to create and to clean up! I just used a regular old teflon pan. I used a blender to mix all the ingredients up. Then I used a measuring cup to pour it into the pan. So incredibly easy! I am going to be crepe happy with our meals this next week;) I put applesauce on top of mine and they were delish!

I happen to have this recipe at home and love it!  The only difference is that I layer them in that order in a blender.  Blend for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the blender, and then blend for 60 seconds.  Let the batter rest a few minutes before making.  Never any lumps.  We also double the recipe (since it's a favorite).  A double batch works perfectly in the blender.

this is probably the worst crepe recipe i have ever tried, everyone i served it to complained that it tasted too much like eggs and had the completely wrong texture, as well as smelling and tasting like play dough.... the choclate topping drowned out the play dough taste..needless to say i would not reccomend this recipe or try making it again.

Perfect proportions and everything, I just mixed dry with dry, and then added the eggs at the end. This makes it not turn out so lumpy.

Best recipe ever! I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and mixed the "wet" ingredients first then added the flour. Not lumpy at all. Put about a teaspoon of sugar in the batter to give it a little sweetness. We just put raspberry preserves on and rolled them up. Kids ate three each!

I would not change a thing. These are very easy. I stuffed them with roasted chicken and spinach and covered them with a parmesan cheese sauce. My wife took one apart, scraped off the sauce and said she could eat the crepes all by themselves. Thanks for the recipe. There are so many possibilities with crepes. This recipe is a very good foundation.

Easy and simple.  I followed recipe as written with flour and eggs mixed together and ended up with a very lumpy mix.  i still used it just strained out the lumps.  I made it again a couple of days later and mixed all the dry ingredients first then the wet and it came out perfect.  I also used sugar free pudding mix,vanilla w/ fresh bananas and caramel topping and cheesecake. with strawberry jam and powered sugar. Very Yummy recipe.  True keeper.

My son made these with me, and really enjoyed doing it-he liked tilting the pan!  We filled with jam, and added whipped cream.  I made with fresh strawberries, macerated with cointrau, and whipped cream.  Couldn't be easier!

Really tasty, though I add vanilla and sugar. Be sure your pan stays coated with a thin layer of oil to avoid sticking. You want the pan on the hot side of medium high. Pour batter onto pan while rotating in a circle to cover the entire bottom with batter.

I would suggest mixing wet ingredients then dry. This recipe is so simple and easy! For dessert crepes, I add a small amount of vanilla to the recipe. I roll chocolate pudding in my crepes and top with powdered sugar, a dollop of whipped cream and a cherry! For breakfast crepes, I roll some yogurt in my crepes and top with a little more yogurt, granola and oats, along with fresh fruit! So yummy!

easy to make and very yummy! It's my first time to make crepes and it was a success! I was surprised it's easy to turn although it was very thin. You will notice the edges separating/lifting  off the pan. Would suggest to use a teflon kind of pan. Will definitely keep making this. thanks for the recipe:)

I had never eaten or made crepes before, but I thought these turned out well.  My husband grew up on crepes and thought these were delicious.  I followed the recipe except for using other's suggestions of mixing the liquids then adding the dry ingredients.  Served with syrup or a warm berry mix.

My suggestions to this recipe: 1. Use 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup water. 2. Add 1 tbsp of sugar 3. Add 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.

i love the way that these turn out but only gave it 4 stars because the directions are a little upside down.  I tried it as the recipe directs exactly and came out with lumpy batter despite all my attempts to fix it.  I tried it again this morning being sure to this time mix all the wet ingredients including eggs together and then added in the dry and they came out perfectly.  I also didn't bother to grease my non-stick pan as I noticed that the first time round my crepes were a little greasy.  This time they turned out much better without greasing the pan.  I got about 8 crepes from my batter in case you're wondering how many "4 servings" will give you. I might try them next time with a little more water to make them easier to swirl in the pan.

This is a solid recipe that says it all in the name - BASIC crepes. It's not original or overly exciting, but it is a perfect starting point. For some zest in the crepe itself, you can add almond or lemon extract, or cinnamon, pumpkin spice, or allspice for a sweeter crepe, or a good, hard cheese like Parmesan, or hot sauce, or any number of spices for a savory crepe. When I want crepes, this is my starting point, and from there, the only limit is my imagination.

They were ok - too spongy and think.  I had to add another 1/4 cup of milk to thin them out and they were still a little thick.  They were ok if you are doing a more substantial savory style (meat or veggie) crepe, but for thin dessert crepes I'd look elsewhere.

LOVE! The best crepes I've ever had, and so easy to make! Even when I make them too thick, they always cook completely in the middle and don't burn as easily as other crepes (no runny middles/burnt edges). 

I make a lower fat/calorie version by using skim milk instead of regular and reducing the water (by half) to 1/4 cup so the batter won't be too runny. I also omit the butter completely. I've tried the two versions - with and without butter - side by side, and neither myself nor my father, even when we tried, could tell the difference. They also turn out well using 1/2 cup of egg substitute instead of 2 real eggs, BUT most of the time I choose to use real eggs because I feel the noticeably richer flavor justifies the extra fat and calories. 

I dump all the ingredients in my stand mixer, add the whisk attachment, and let it run until all the lumps are gone. I spray the pan fairly lightly with cooking spray before beginning and never have to re-oil. Enjoy!

You seem to have forgotten that this is the exact recipe from the T.V. show from Good Eats, and the instructions are the same as well. it appears fairly odd that they are that exact.

I used a stovetop wok for this recipe, and discovered quickly that in a stovetop wok (one with good teflon) you do not need the butter in the pan and can cook them quickly and effectively if you use med-high heat.

Excellent recipe, but I did make a couple small alterations.  First off, I blended all of the liquid ingredients and the salt together (also adding a small amount of sugar) until smooth and uniform, then added the flour about a 6th of a cup at a time, blending fully each time to get a very smooth batter.  I've done this with any crepe recipe since I was about 10 (I've been making these for about 10 years).  At this point, I found the batter was too thick to get good, transparent crepes, so I added a small amount more milk and water and blended thoroughly.  

They turned out PERFECTLY after I discovered the trick with my wok.  My partner, who is from French-Canadian descent, as I am, and grew up on good crepes, was VERY impressed and wants me to make them again tomorrow.  We ate them simply--butter and jam for him and butter and maple syrup for me--and tomorrow we're going to make "dessert" crepes with cut up fruit and whipped cream.

Awesome recipe, after the alterations I made.  The same as the traditional recipe I learned as a small child--I even had to make precisely the same alterations to get the results I wanted!  I've personally never bothered with the wait times for traditional crepes and get as good results.

Wow, I never knew crepes could be so easy to make.  These came out so good and they were very easy to make.  I put some Nutella spread on them, fresh strawberries and topped it off with homemade whip cream, chocolate sauce and powdered sugar.  They were a huge hit!

This came out SO thick that the crepes coul not be spread thin to come out like crepes at all. They also tasted very bland.  I had to do quite a bit of improvising to get the batter right and save the batch.

Wanted something different for the brunch I'm serving this Sunday. Tried these ahead to make sure I could do it. All I can say is this is soooo easy and so yummy. I'm making a seafood dish that calls for crepes and these will be wonderful. Thanks Jen!~

These were really good & easy to make.  This was the first time I've ever made crepes & my kids love them for breakfast in the morning!! I serve them with Nutella & jelly & the kids eat them up! The other good thing about this recipe is that you normally have everything that you need right in the cabinets.  Great Recipe!

good crepes, and also easy to do. I made egg rolls and used these for the wrappers, they came out super and not greasy.I have made egg rolls with store bought wrappers, and have also had them at restaurants and both were a little greasy these were perfect. Will be making again real soon.

Turned out really well, very easy. I added 2 Tbsp of sugar to give it a sweeter flavour. Make sure you mix the flour and eggs really well, or you will have lumps at the bottom of the bowl.

I have a big family and live on a budget. Wanted to do something fun and saw this recipe. I had to double the ingredients. Following the directions, mixing flour & eggs first is a wrong thing to do! I was stuck with a big batch of unusable LUMPY batter. Extremely frustrating and disappointing. I had to make another batch and did it where I mixed the wet ingredients and then added the flour. They came out great, family loved them.

This is the very recipe I lost. I usually put the ingredients into the blender with the eggs on the bottom, flour in the middle and remaining ingredients on top and blend it until smooth. This method removes the possibility of lumps that some have mentioned. You many need to scrape the sides of the blender once to ensure all the flour is mixed in. I do add a bit of vanilla sugar to the recipe to add a hint of sweetness.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. Based on the comments/suggestions, I have a few warnings. Another reviewer suggested putting a pat of butter in the pan before pouring in the batter. Don't do this if you are using a non-stick pan. That will make the batter roll around when you are trying to coat the pan with it. Second, as another reviewer suggested, mix all the wet ingredients together, then sift in the flower. Doing it the way the recipe suggests, makes for a lumpy batter; not unworkable, but not pretty. Tastes delicious as sweet breakfast crepes. To save time you can serve it with a fruit compote. Cheers!

I made these for breakfast today but halved the recipe for me and my hubby. After reading the reviews, I mixed the dry ingredients together, mixed the wet ingredients and then mixed the two. I also added 1/2 tbsp of sugar (for sweet crepes) and added an extra 1/8 cup of water to make the batter runnier. They cooked very quickly and they didn't break! :D. I managed to make 4. I had mine with lemon and sugar and my hubby had his with maple syrup. This is the 2nd crepe recipe i have tried and it is the BEST! Will definitely be making these again!

This was my first time making crepes at home and they turned out great. I used butter on the pan and it made the first crepe too crispy and salty. I started over with a dry pan and the remaining batch turned out better. I'll forgo the oil next time. We ate this with bananas and homemade chocolate sauce (also found on Allrecipes).

This is my go-to recipe for crepes. I add a tiny bit more liquid because they can sometimes come out a tad thick. Other than that, these are golden. Quick, easy recipe that turns out well every time!

My husband is NOT a cook and made these perfectly. They were amazing. He followed the advice of reviewer Morley and added the dry ingredients into the wet ones instead of the other way around...perfection. He served crepes filled with Nutella and topped with strawberries, bananas and powered sugar. Jamieson Clem is awesome.

I wouldn't change this recipe other than to clarify the directions. #1 would better read: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt, and make a well in the flour. Add the eggs into the well and begin whisking the eggs while slowly incorporating the flour, milk and water into the egg well. After all milk and water have been added, mix in the butter until batter is smooth.

there was way too much flour and not enough milk.  the batter should not look like pancake batter but closer to the consistancy of hot syrup.  otherwise it wont evenly coat the pan with 2T of batter as it should.

I didn't actually make these, my wife did. They were perfect. I hadn't had a crepe in over 10 years and what a treat they were. the consistency was wonderful. I rolled mine with ham, swiss cheese and onions. The kids preferred fruit preserves. a definate repeater.

This was the first time I had made crepes myself and once I got the hang of it (turning the heat down), they were fabulous. Very easy and they go with pretty much everything. Have made several batches now- everything from sweet, fruity dessert with strawberries and ice cream to savoury with melted cheese and green onion. I have now just memorized this recipe so I can make it on the go! Amazingly simple, easy and delicious!

This recipe worked out great! The kids loved helping out, as it was easy to do as a family thing.

We also mixed all the liquids and eggs first. From pancake experience, it works out the best in having a lump-free mix.

Thanks for posting it!

This is my go to crepe recipe and I have been making these for years.  It is perfect with my VillaWare crepe maker (one of the best inventions ever!!)  I bring the crepe maker, batter and assorted fillings to parties and people love to make their own crepe at the crepe station.  My favorite filling is orange cream (orange juice concentrate, sour cream & Cool Whip) and Nuetella. Absolutely perfect!

I forgot to bake a loaf of bread for the kids to have PB&J today so I was looking for something else we could use as a substitute.  I have wanted to try crepes for a while and this recipe was quick, just what I needed!  They were a huge hit.  The kids ate them all and I had to make another batch.  I added 2 Tbsp of sugar and a dash of vanilla as others had mentioned and mixed everything with my stick blender.  We ate them with peanut butter and banana, PB and applesauce, PB and apple butter, garden vegetable cream cheese and pepperoni... They thought of all sorts of fillings for the next time we have them.  My 4 yr old asked me to make them every day! (One note: I made about 10 10-12" crepes from this recipe.  Each of my 5 kids ages 1-12 ate at least 2, you might want to double up if you are cooking for more than 2-3 people.) Thanks for the great and EASY recipe!

Today was my first attempt at making crepes. I was thrilled to discover it IS easy! My first ones were a tad too thick, but I think if I thin the batter with a little more water, it should be fine. I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed the wet ingredients together first, then added the flour and salt. Since they were going to be topped with raspberry preserves and pawdered sugar, I added a little vanilla and sugar. Thank you so much!

pretty good recipe, easy to adapt and fill with whatever. But for good Crepes,  the trick is to mix them in the blender, and then let it sit for at least two hours in the fridge!  Makes them light and airy :)

I just made this recipe and it’s wonderful.  I made Crepas de Cajeta: translation—caramel crepes.  I added a little sugar and a little vanilla.  I mixed by hand and then mixed in a blender to smooth the batter out.  If you like Dulce de leche ice cream, then cajeta (I like the cajeta quemada) is for you.  It’s a Mexican caramel that comes in a plastic container (like pancake syrup) and you can find it in grocery stores.  Fold each crepe in half and then fold over again. Pour heated cajeta over the crepes and add some chopped pecans…ummm.
A nice substitute is Nutella--make the same way using heated Nutella and top with pecans if you like and some whipped cream.

Really good! first I tried the "real french crepes" recipe and that was a mess, too much liquid, the center never cooked and remains undercooked forever (and I made the crepes really thin, almost like paper)...but this recipe came out perfect! I have made this with oil instead of butter (I ran out of butter) and it works well too, These are like crepes we have had in french restaurants, thanks!!!

Good recipe!  Fast and easy to make.  We filled them with strawberry preserves and dusted them with powdered sugar.  My family loved them.  I had to make them again for breakfast a few days later.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

I enjoyed this recipe. I missplaced my go-to low calorie one, so used this one in the meantime. I do make some changes to the recipe to make the crepes more flavorful: 

add
1 tsp granulated cane sugar
1-1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract

I also take the tip from other reviewers and mix the wet ingredients first, then add the dry ingredients. Otherwise you end with a doughy, hard to mix mess. These are wonderful, today will be my third time using the recipe. :) 

Filling:
My go-to filling is nutella, banana slices, and strawberry slices with a small drizzle of cocoa powder, with a spritz of low-fat whipped cream topping: delicious.

I've made crepes using this recipe numerous times. The main reason why  I went to IHOP one day and they took out the stuffed french toast and I had to settle with an alternative so I chose strawberry crepes, which I was disappointed with. All I tasted in my mouth was eggs. I absolutely love this recipe is the fact that there is no egg aftertaste, it's not eggy and it's light. You can play with this recipe and not mess it up (in terms of adding ingredients in). I added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a dash of nutmeg and about 1/4- 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. It comes out great. I sometimes add sugar, but being that the filling I put in the crepes is usually sweet I don't want to over do it with the sugar. So now I make my own Strawberry Crepes with cream cheese filling at home at the time!! I get the filling from this other recipe on this site. Here's the Link for those who are interested: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-strawberry-crepes/

This was very good and very easy. I did add 3 tbsp of sugar to it and cooked for 3 minutes per side. I made this cream cheese sauce and mixed in some raspberry jam and it was a good light dish to pair with buscuits and gravy.

This is an excellent basic crepe recipe. I like that  there is no sugar in the recipe so these crepes can be used for savory or sweet creations. I mixed it differently- combine the dry ingredients, combine eggs, milk and water, then added that to the dry. Then added the melted butter.  These cooked up so easily and using a non-stick pan I didn't need additional fat. Excellent!

Well, my batter was too thick so I had to add quite a bit more liquid. I like a thin crepes and the batter was simply too thick as directed. Otherwise, the recipe was quite fine.

I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the wet ingredients first and am glad I did as it was still a bit tricky to get the batter to thin out nicely.  These were just okay for me.  They had a strong eggy flavor.  I just had crepes on vacation and they did not have that egg taste to them.  I put some peanut butter, nutella, chocolate, and bananas in mine and it was pretty good.  They were just not as light as I would have liked.

I agree with the first review.  Don't do the eggs and the flour together!  Make large lumps.

These crepes came out perfectly!! I added just a little dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract to the batter (for flavor) but besides that, I didn't change a thing. The consistency was exactly what I was looking for and they were so easy to make. I served them with nutella and strawberries and they were absolutely delicious!

i really like this crepe because as it is cooked, it's chewy and crispy at the edge:D I followed the exact recipe but i did add a tablespoon of sugar to give it a better taste. And I ate this for breakfast!

I also made caramelised apple cinnamon filling. To make apple cinnamon filling, add 1 tbsp butter in a saucepan above medium heat, then add 1 red apple (cubed), 1/2 tbsp sugar, 1/2 tbsp honey, 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Cook for five minutes until apples are cooked but a bit crispy (I like the apples not too soft). After all, this is my first attempt and it worked!

The recipe is good but it tase much better if you use 1 cup of milk instead of half milk and half water. This is the French way.

Really great basic crepes recipe!  Any flavour additions are good like vanilla or Kahlua, its a bit different to normal crepe recipes where the batter has to rest for at least 30 minutes which is good

I just made crepes for the very first time because I always thought they would be difficult to make.  Super easy.  They came out perfect.  I filled them with a mixture of some broccoli florets I made with a little olive oil and garlic.  I drained the broccoli, and added an egg, a cup of ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese, some fresh basil, black pepper and some parmesan cheese.  Made a quick marinara sauce.  They were out of this world  Thanks for posting the crepe recipe.  I 'm so proud that I used this crepe recipe and made homemade manicotti .   Thanks so much again.

Great recipe and worked a dream. We had friends for brunch so made a mixture of savory and sweet - all a success. Followed suggestions of mixing wet ingredients first and then sifting in dry as well as more liquid (1/3 - 1/2 cup extra milk/water).

Great recipe!  Works well for savory and sweet crepes alike.  Here's a hint, though... if you like them especially deserty, add a bit of sugar/sweetener and a splash of vanilla.  ;)

This is a great recipe. I have made this over 10 times now and it is so good. I used to eat the crepes at IHOP all the time and I am so glad I can make this at home now. Each time I follow the recipe but to the batter I also add 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tbsp honey. I like the flavor it adds. By using a hand mixer to combine you will get the smoothest batter. I usually top mine with fresh strawberry, blueberry, and blackberry. If I dont have fresh fruit I will use the raspberry preserve I always keep on hand. Top with syrup for the most indulgent breakfast ever!

This is a great crepe recipe! It's simple and easy, and made from ingredients that everyone has on hand. However, I did have to make some small adjustments. First, I always have to add extra milk and water to get the batter to the right consistency. Also, I add a couple spoonfuls of sugar to the batter to make it just a little bit sweeter. We serve this with my special banana filling. ( Fry sliced bananas in 1 Tbsp. of butter, add 1 Tbsp. of honey, and sprinkle with brown sugar and grated coconut. Fry just until soft.) This is truly a great recipe!

did not like this at all. I love crepes and these were very bland and did not work out the way it is written.  I doubled the recipe but only added 2TBS of butter instead of four. It was way too much butter. I also had to add more water as the consistency was too thick for crepes. I will try it differently next time. not a good recipe.

So tasty, soft, chewy, crispy - all in one!  Made the recipe as is. Added about 1 tbspn of vanilla extract. Most impt: wait for the  bottom side to cook through before trying to turn. The top side will bubble. Used strawberries, black berries, blue berries, and bananas. Spread nutella on. Drizzled dark chocolate syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Will make again!

Great basic crepe recipe that can be used as is for savory dishes or slightly sweetened for desserts.  I *halved* the recipe and using a 1/4 cup measuring cup as my ladle I made 17 crepes (for anyone trying to figure out how many crepes in a serving).  Figure a full recipe would make 32-34 crepes

Recipe sounds great and I want to try it. One tip (lived in france for a few years and had many friends show me crepe-making tips) Don't mix ALL the eggs and flour at once. Crack the eggs into the side of the bowl of flour or make a well to put them in. Use beaters or a wire wisk to beat the eggs with the flour around it gradually. Add the milk (I've never used water) to the soft mixture, gradually mixing in the flour. You don't want lumps, so avoid mixing in the flour too fast. This keeps the consistency just right.

SO easy to make--only took a few minutes.  I halved the recipe and it was the PERFECT amount.  Will make again and again, thanks!

These are great! You can put anything fruity (like jelly or jam or actual fruit) in them. I like whipped cream cheese and strawberries myself. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very good. However, it was a little thick. I would think it out with more liquid.

Just made these for the first time tonight and they were a hit! I used Nutella and bananas for the filling with a little powdered sugar...just like in Paris! Wonderful recipe and very easy! Thanks for posting.

I really liked this crepe recipe. I mix it all up in a blender though. That works really well. It's easy too for a quick meal. I like to use pesto and chicken with some kind of green like asparagus, green beans or spinach, or strawberries with vanilla yogurt to fill it. I've made this recipe quite a bit and I still really like it.

This WAS an easy and delicious recipe that my family (including 3 teenage sons) enjoyed.  I also mixed the wet ingreds first, and added sugar.  We had a toppings bar with: chopped strawberries, finely sliced bananas, blueberries, whipped cream, Nutella, and vanilla custard.  They loved it!  A new breakfast tradition in our house.

Made them this morning to celebrate Bastille Day, very easy and turned out beautifully. Stuffed them with crumbled Toulouse sausage & cream mixture, covered in cheese sauce and whizzed under the grill for 5 mins. Magnifique!

I didn't have white flour so I used whole wheat and it was still pretty good.  A litle thicker but good.  I also added a little vanilla, and cinnamon.  I will try again with white flour.

I've never made crepes before. This recipe was easy and the crepes tasted great. I put strawberries and whipped cream inside the crepes and powdered them with powdered sugar.

I've made this several time and they always turn out great. I have problems getting the batter to be completely smooth without all kinds of air bubbles though.  They still taste great though - easy to sweeten with fruit or turn into a meal with veggies and cheese.

Well I'm not the worst cook, and definitely not the best, but I made some great crepes today from this recipe! I usually look at the reviews of a recipe I get from this site.  Specifically the most helpful reviews.  I did as I read others did and used 1 Tablespoon of sugar, added 1 Tablespoon of vanilla, then  added some cinnamon (I just sprinkled it in the batter and then did the same with my jar of nutmeg.) I tossed a bit of milk into the batter to thin it as it looked a bit like pancake batter. I used fresh strawberries that I cut up and tossed with a little powdered sugar for the filling. I used a non-stick frying pan and used butter flavored cooking spray too. I filled them with the strawberries, rolled and sprinkled the tops with powdered sugar, used some pancake syrup.  They were easy to make. They were so good I made them twice today for myself.  The extra batter that I put in the frig after making them the first time didn't even have a chance ;)

I love how simple and elegant these can be. This recipe made me famous among my friends--I would make them all the time and people would beg me for them. It's all about the filling though; my favorite is to sautee apples (Spitzenbergs are my favorite) in pressed apple cider with allspice, cardamom, nutmeg and cinnamon, reserve some of the juice, mix that with some candied walnuts or pecans and use homemade whipped cream to fill it. Mmmm..... For something more savory, I will make a "Crepe Benedictine" and chop up some poached eggs, canadian bacon and pour hollandaise sauce over the top. I also loved to macerate strawberries and mix them with strawberry-raspberry jam. For dessert, sometimes I will put some cocoa powder in the batter stuff the crepe with strawberries and a Kahlua chocolate sauce. It's absolutely divine.

These are very good...nice, thin, golden crepes.  I filled them with sliced bananas, topped them with sliced strawberries and touch of sour cream, and drizzled them with the orange sauce recipe from this website.  My husband had them with maple syrup.  We both liked them. The only thing I recommend, differently, is to first mix together the milk & water & eggs, THEN add the flour because just mixing the flour & eggs alone and adding liquids after, makes a globby ball that is hard to break down again!  Thanks for sharing this, Jen.

My husband loves crepes so I decided to try these one Sunday afternoon. They were extremly easy and tasted just delicious by themselves but we added mushrooms and onions cooked in garlic and butter and cheese to top them off.

They came out beautiful, I did not grease the pan and they just cook beautiful.

This is a really good recipe, and I'm not even a huge crepe fan. Just had a craving, so decided to try my hand at a basic recipe. I found Christine Anderson's suggestion of adding a 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter did the trick-- Lovely, light, with just a touch of sweetness--and oh, so quick!

I made some sweet, and some savory. The savory ones I filled with sauteed mushrooms, Kale, and mozzarella cheese. The sweet ones I filled with Mixed Berry Jam and Bananas. I actually liked the savory ones better!

DELICIOUS!!! Followed some of the suggestions and beat the eggs in with the milk and water instead, then sifted the flour in gradually as I whisked it. I then added the salt and melted butter and whisked it until it was a really lovely smooth batter. The first one was a bit thick, but after I got the hang of adding the batter to the pan and tilting it quickly, it flowed around to make a lovely, thin crepe. They don't take long to cook, mine were a lovely golden brown at a minute each side. I served them by spreading some Nutella onto it, arranging some sliced strawberries and folding it up burrito style. It was every bit as good as the wonderful crepe cafe near our house. One could probably add sifted confectioner's sugar or whipped cream as well, but I loved them just the way they were. We are going to try doing a savoury version next and attempt replicating the cafe's "Philly Cheesesteak" version with thinly sliced roast beef, slivered red pepper, thinly sliced red onion, spinach, and grated cheese. YUM!!!

Have made these several times and they are delicious! I halve the recipe to make just 3-4 crepes for me for breakfast. I don't bother with what order to put the ingredients in - I just dump everything into my 2 cup glass measuring cup and whisk. Never had any lump issues. I tend to add a little vanilla and sometimes a little white sugar since I love them sweet. My favorite filling is ricotta cheese mixed with brown sugar, top with a little butter and drizle with pure maple syrup. I made bananas foster (chop a banana and dump into a pan with some butter and brown sugar - heat to bubbling - add a little rum if you want) to top them with one day too and they were heavenly! Make sure your pan is hot enough and you swirl the batter around it in right after you pour it in to make it thin. Wait until the edges of the crepe turn brown and they are perfect every time. Nice and thin and crispy.

This is the best crepe I have ever had. I find it has a few similarities with Julia Child's crepe recipe. I find the best way to grease the pan is by lightly dampening a paper towel with oil or butter. If you are making them sweet you MUST add VANILLA extract! It just takes it to the next level.  And remember sweet crepes are made to be slobbered and eaten with Nutella.

this recipe worked quite well for what I needed it to do. My kids devoured them. I made a double batch and was able to put some away in the frig and they were feasibly easy to make at a moments notice. Will totally make again. Thank you!

Okay so I followed the directions exactly and was really excited as I never made crepes before. The first two crepes didn't look so hot but after i got the spreading technique down they really started to look like restaurant style crepes! I was happy that I learned to make this kind of fancy dish and it was remarkably easy. Then I tasted one of the crepes...BLECH!! I'm sorry but don't you have to put sugar, vanilla or something? I actually added in a little vanilla and cinnamon at the beginning, even though the recipe did call for it, it still tasted so bland. I added more vanilla, more cinnamon and some almond extract and sugar, okay it was getting better but still didn't taste like the crepes I get in the restaurants.

I ended up throwing what was left of the crepe batter into what was left of the pancake batter I had stored which already had cinnamon, almond extract and vanilla extract. Now we're talking! They tasted great and my son loved them with some apple pie filling and whipped cream, but as the original recipe stood, I don't get how it got so many high reviews. The taste was flavorless without even a bit of sweetness in it.

This recipe hit the spot! Simple to prepare and cook, and very delicious! This will definitely make a repeat appearance in my kitchen, and quite frequently I imagine, too! Good for breakfast or dinner, depending on what you stuff 'er with!

I've wanted to try crepes for a long time.  WOW! This recipe was easy and outstanding.  I sliced up some bananas in brown sugar and butter as well as apricot and strawberry preserves for a variety of filling.  Rolled up and topped with whipped cream.  My wife was impressed.

I was in the mood for crepes but couldn't find my go to recipe so I decided to use this one. Not remembering the ingredient amounts I followed this one to the T even though others said it was thick. First off the medium-high heat is too high. If you choose to try this recipe you should cook them on medium heat. The mixture is too thick and essentially makes an omelet. While trying to save this recipe and make a good crepe I added another egg and a tbsp of milk. Even this combined with my immersion blender and cutting back on the amount cooked didn't help completely. A good crepe should be light and airy with a light golden brown appearance. When making one you should drop just enough mixture to swirl and coat the bottom of the pan. I knew when I saw the cooking time something was wrong because it should take 30 seconds - 1 minute for your crepe to cook before being flipped. If you're in the mood for an omelet this makes a decent one but not a crepe. The cook time, ingredient amounts and heat setting are all off, I won't make this again.

These creeps were great just like the ones I get at the local Tattoria here in Europe. The only exception is that the instructions aren't great. Followed exactly the batter was very lumpy. I would totally mix all wet ingredients and then add in the flour. Other than that, it was a good recipe.

Great!   My first attempt at crepes.  I used almond milk.   Very light and versatile.   I filled mine with sautéed chopped veggies and topped with a Thai peanut sauce.   Will make a dessert next!

This was an easy and awesome recipe! I cooked it with no problem and the kids loved it! I added a little vanilla in the batter to sweeten the crepe taste with the cinnamon dusting,, how the kids like it. Then I top it off with some powder sugar frosting. Taste just like a cinnamon roll but healthier!

I would personally take the butter out of the recipe since it's already used to fry the crepes. when it's refrigerated, the butter hardens into little clumps

I loved this!! I made the filling w/ 1pkg cream chesse, 1/2 cup sugar and 1tsp vanilla. Also for strawberry sauce-about a cup frozen strawberrys, 1/2 cup sugar, and about 1/2 cup pineapple juice, then a lil bit water to liquidfy it better. And topped it with sauce and whipped topping. PERFECT!!!

Excellent recipe. I've been making creeps for years and couldn't find my recipe so I tried this one. I find this makes a thicker crepe than I prefer so I added an additional 2 to 4 tbsp of milk. This made a nice, thin crepe. Also, I find it easiest to put all the ingredients in a blender, adding the flour last, and mixing it that way. This makes a very smooth batter and pours easily. Another tip is to use the size of pan than you would like your creeps to be. Then you can just swirl the batter to the edges for nice, round crepes. I agree with the reviewers than suggest to add some butter to the pan before adding the batter- either for every crepe, or even every second crepe if you have a good pan. I take the whole pound of butter with the wrapper peeled back a little and swipe it quickly around the pan. I like to cut of some bananas and strawberries and fold the crepe up then finish with a drizzle of chocolate or syrup! Yum!

Very good recipe! Made these for Mother's Day and Mom loved them!! Only change I made was i added the eggs, milk, and water all at once, then added the flour; this prevented big globs of flour in the batter. It was so delicious!

These were just OK for me. I took the suggestions of some reviewers to add some vanilla and sugar, but even with that they still tasted kind of egg-y. I think I'll experiment with other crepe recipes before passing serious judgment on these, but I was not excited about them.

Used to really hate making crepes, but this recipe handled so much better than the recipe I've used in the past and they were very tasty too. As a previous poster mentioned I whisked the wet ingredients together first before whisking in the flour and it worked well.

This recipe is super easy and really versatile. The crepes make for a surprisingly filling meal. The only changes I made were to substitute whole wheat flour for the bleached and olive oil for the butter--just a little healthier. I also added nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon and served them with sliced bananas and nutmeg syrup. Delish!

Soooo Yummy!!!  Quadrupled the recipe, and have about 12 left (but our biggest eater was getting over being sick, so couldn't eat much)  Took about 1.5 hours to cook them in 2 pans.  Added vanilla and a few Tbsp. sugar (not necessary, but tasty)

I gave this recipe 5 stars because I think it would be great as written; I was looking for a recipe I could modify to be non-dairy and this was pretty good. I used Almond milk, Smart Balance butter, and added almost 1/4 cup sugar (to our taste). These were fairly easy to handle, although didn't flip too easily, and the taste/texture were ok with our toppings. Maybe less melted butter next time, since I needed plenty in the skillet to prevent sticking. Thanks!

We didnt have much time before we had to do our farm chores - but i whipped them up in 5 min and they were scrumptious and SO easy! we sprinkled some Triple sec and spread our homemade raspberry jam on them; rolled them up and dusted with icing sugar - decadent way to start the day!

These were delicious and super easy to make.  Once I pour the batter and get it all spread out I sprinkle some sugar over the top, that way when you flip it the other side carmelizes.. So tasty

These were delicious! We filled ours with yogurt and topped them with fruit and whip cream. I mixed it all in a blender. These are a new family favorite!

This recipe was great! I decided to make a different dessert because we always have pie or ice cream. During a food festival in Downton Long Beach, CA, my husband and I had the opportunity to try different local eateries; and one of them was La Creperie. I instantly fell in love with it and wanted more! I tried this recipe for the first time with the ingredients listed plus 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and ground cinnamon for flavor. It was delish! My husband loved it and so does our 4yr old! I also filled the inside with nutella and bananas then top with more bananas, chocolate syrup and powered sugar. Simple recipe with simple, cheap ingredients - great for this low budget mom! Two thumbs way up!! :)

Tried this for the family and WOW it tasted perfectly. It was a great breakfast, served with some freshly diced fruit and whip. It's definitely guest worthy!
I will have to try them for a dinner crepe next.
Thanks for the recipe

Always good! Be careful to only add exactly 2tbs of melted butter ( too much can cause a problem with consistency).  This recipe works well with my crepe maker, thanks!

I would suggest adding the flour to the bowl, adding the eggs, and then whisking AS YOU ADD MILK.  The directions as is call for whisking eggs and flour together which only results in a giant glob of dough stuck in your whisk.

Other than that these tasted great!  I am going to post a lemon/blueberry cheese blintz-type filling that I concocted to go with.

This should be titled Crepes for dummies, because it is fool proof and delicious. It's easy enough for everyone to make. Just wiggle the skillet and the batter covers the pan. This recipe is also simple enough to add your own personal touches. This was very good!

Best Basic Recipe. If dairy doesn't agree with you, try substituting flavored Coffee Creamer instead of Milk.. Vanilla Nut is my fav. Yum!

These were very good and easy to make!  I added a little cinnamon and a couple of spoons full of sugar, which gave them a nice crispy edge.  I filled them with an apple mixture made with diced apples and pears, a little cinnamon and a little brown sugar, sauteed in a pan until soft.  The brown sugar made a nice syrup.  I spooned a little of the mixture over the top as well.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe worked perfectly for me! The cook time was perfect for feeding 5 people. I wasn't in the kitchen all morning. I took some frozen strawberries and cooked them on the stove, added some cornstarch and it was the best topping for these!

This was really good and super easy.  I found it a little thick and had to add more milk and water, but I do live at a high altitude so that could account for it.  I doubled the batch and added 1/3 cup sugar to the double batch as other reviewers had recommended.  I will defnitely be making this again!  Thanks for submitting!

My mother used to make these when I was a child, I made them for my children and now my grandson!  We have always called them "Special Pancackes"!  The only changes are omit the water and increase the milk to 1 1/2 cups, and add a little more flour if the batter is too thin.  We serve with jelly in the center, roll up, pour on a little warmed maple syrup, sprinkle with powder sugar and slivered almonds!  DELISH!!!

I found Christine's suggestion to add 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of icing sugar absolutely wonderful.  The only way to improve on this was to add 1/2 tsp Vanilla.  Fill with cottage cheese mixed with honey and you have the best Cheese blintz's ever!

PS... great topping for blintz's are sour cream or apple sauce.

Easy, delicious recipe. I found it for my son, who wanted to make crepes by himself. He's only 9, but does amazingly well in the kitchen (which I owe to his gifted Waldorf Kindergarten teacher) and these come out perfect every time.

It was super easy and fun to do. I made them first for my boyfriend and then demonstrated it for my speech class. Everyone loved it and then afterwards we had a crepe party in my dorm. (: Now my sister can make them in Japan, since the ingredients are super simple. Did the wet stuff first, then flour. I added sugar and vanilla extract for the dessert ones, but left out for the savory ones. You don't need to oil the pan, the butter "oils" it for you and doesn't stick at all. Just flip when the edges crisp and you can shake the crepe around the pan. Tastes AMAZING with habanero cheddar cheese, pastrami and arugula!

I have been using this recipe for about 3 years now and my family loves them...you can make them savory and serve them as a main course for dinner or add a sweet filling and make them breakfast or dessert. So versatile and delicious...we love them w/ nutella and whipped cream...sometimes strawberries. OH MY YUMMMMM!

I just made these as a midnight snack for my fiancée and I. They are amazing. She said they were the best crepes she's ever had. I'm inclined to agree. They were simple, fast and delicious. I did change the order in which I mixed the ingredients based upon one of the comment I read. Whisking the wet ingredients first and then slowly adding in the dry. It made a nice smooth batter, which in turn made some amazing crepes!

WHAT A GREAT RECIPE..My husband made these for me this morning for breakfast.  No changes to the recipe necessary, but if you read other reviews, a little alcoholic beverage never hurts if making dessert crepes.  We put mixed berries w sugar and cottage cheese inside & on top...this recipe was great...perfect, and easy.  We had crepes in Heidleberg Germany cooked by a street vendor and these are much better. We will make again.  There are so many ways to make this recipe your own with the toppings or things you can put inside..just get adventureous.  My husband used the griddle.

Fabulous.  I used 1/4 c more milk and added some sugar and vanilla as others did.  I also made an applie cinnamon filling to put in. 3 apples peeled and chopped, 1 1/2 T butter, 1/2 c brown sugar and 3 T water.  Microwave it all for a few minutes until apples are tender.  Stir it up and scoop onto crepes.  Delicious!

Amazing! After reading some reviews, I mixed the wet ingredients and then added in the dry, adding 1/4 c. sugar and a generous dash of vanilla.  Filled them with nutella and sliced bananas and then topped with a drizzle of raspberry sauce.  My family devoured them and demanded more!  I've always been afraid of crepes, thinking they would stick, etc., but these were soooo easy.  A keeper recipe for sure!

Love this recipe! I've been using it for years and I've always used a blender to mix the ingredients. Blend the eggs, water, milk, and salt. Add the flour and blend well. Then add the melted butter and blend. Easy to pour, easy to store in the fridge and already has a lid!

I made these for a Sunday morning breakfast.  They were a hit with my opinionated (but sweet) husband and my opinionated & learning to be sweet 1 1/2 & 3 year olds!  I put nutella and powdered sugar on mine & my husband's & melted butter, syrup & powdered sugar on my children's.  I followed the suggestion of another review and added the flour to the liquid bit by bit while whisking briskly.  The batter was perfectly smooth.  I will make these again!!

It was my first try and these still turned out beautifully, they were very simple to make. I opted to add half a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of sugar which made them a perfect dessert.

Very easy and very popular.  I have to adjust the serving size as for 4 people I make enough for 6, for 8 I make enough for 12 etc.. and even then sometimes I come up short that's how yummy they are.

I'm amazed that I can make spongy-thin crepes one the first try!Unfortunately this ratio of ingredients didn't work out for me. Perhaps my eggs were too small - I needed to add at least a quarter cup more milk to make the batter spread across the whole pan instead of sticking in one place. Also, it was lumpy from the egg and flour step. But they tasted divine, especially with ricotta cheese and kiwi jam :)

First attempt at making crepes. Kinda eyeballed it on the flour but did measurements for everything else. Followed other commenter's advice to do wet ingredients first and it worked out well for me. Used a simple frying pan and turned out great. Was very difficult to turn, however. Not sure why not using complete sentences throughout. Paired this with asparagus, portobellos and cheese sauce topped with roast red peppers. Tasty!

So, very good and easy to make.  Make sure to swirl pan around to create a large thin circle as directed.  They will not spread enough on their own.  Can't wait to try with different meal fillings.  Thank you submitter!

Very easy, and the crepes come out beautiful.  Good for sweet or savoury, breakfast, dinner, or desert!  I have always found that sifting the flour and letting your final batter rest (from a few minutes to overnight) helps give the final product a bit more structure.

Outstanding recipe - for a dirt-simple food.  It works and tastes great.  My variation is adding a pinch of NETMEG, about 1 tsp sugar (even for savory) and using all whole milk (no water) for the fluid component.  These are rich enough to have some flavor of their own and to be a bit more than soft, warm 'bread' to hold something else.  They are fun and tasty as-is.  If making a double batch, to feed several, I cook the crepes with two pans and hold them in a 150-200 degree oven, folden in half and covered with a damp paper towel.    Another tip:  Don't try to stir out the lumps; not worth the trouble and it will toughen the final crepe.  Better practice is to make thej batter 8-24 hours ahead of time and fridge it, stiring lightly when it comes out.  Any lumps will be gone.  The FUN thing about crepes is that they can be eaten alone - or filled with virtually anything.  Go for it!  -Cedarglen

Delicious. So easy and quick to make--great for a weeknight dinner. When the crepes were almost done on the first side, I added a handful of fresh baby spinach leaves and sprinkled some mozzarella. Fold half of the crepe over, let cook a little more, and you have an amazing spinach crepe...

First time making crepes, surprised how easy they were to make! Thanks to the other reviews, I also mixed the eggs in with the other ingredients, then added the flour. I used whole wheat flour, and added about 1/4 sugar to the batter, and they turned out quite well. In the future I think I'll stick to white flour for dessert crepes, and whole wheat for savory/veggie crepes though! Taste was still great, but the texture of the whole wheat was a bit much for a dessert crepe.

Great, fun recipe for a 'beginner' with crepes! I swirled the batter each time until it coated the skillet, then as soon as the crepe started to shift when I shook the pan, I gave it a quick flip!

My son wanted crepes for he and his friends so I told him to look up a recipe on the computer and he came up with this one.  I am a very simple cook and this recipe was easy, quick and really good.  The kids LOVED it.  I put out fresh berries and powdered sugar and let them roll them and eat them with their hands.  Big hit. Also, I quadrupeled the recipe and it was fine.

My kids beg me to make crepes now. I usually make this recipe every other weekend.  We usually put strawberries, bananas, strawberry sauce & maple syrup. Delicious!  As with what others have said mix wet first then dry.  If pressed for time you can mix in a big bowl and use right away (just make sure to really whisk well) and they still turn out great.

This is a good basic crepe recipe except that the batter is way too thick.  It needs to be runnier so that it will spread out on the hot pan quickly when frying.  Next time I'll add more milk.  They actually reminded me more of the German Pfannkuchen which are thicker than French crepes.  They were tasty though.

This WAS the best!  I put all ingredients in a blender like I have with other recipes and every single crepe came out perfectly!  Usually the first two get "thrown out" (aka eaten by me).

Perfect recipe for a savory brunch selection. I added a bit of vanilla extract and some sweetener for the dessert crepe. Made batches on site for a community bake sale and couldn't keep up with the demand!

very quick and easy, for a fraction of the premixed buy and add egg and water kits. I added a dash of vanilla extract to the mix for non-savory crepes and topped with marmelade, and a tiny drop of sour cream. Also great with any jarred preserves, i.e. cherry/blueberry grocery store brand. Makes a gourmet meal without alot of fuss, mix, pour,top and devour.

This recipe is amazing! At first, I thought the batter had something wrong with it because it wasn't cooking correctly. Then I used a different pan and it worked like a charm! I put melted chocolate and peanut butter on top, it was delicious! Thank you for the recipe! It was phenomenal!!

I had to add more to it to get some flavor.  I'm really not sure if I cooked them long enough, are they supposed to be a similar consistency of a pancake except less cake-like and flat?  Maybe I'm just not a crepe fan.  They were simple to make though.

This is a great basic recipe, very easy to make and tasty. However my batter turned out a little thick, I agree with one reviewer, add a little more water to get a crepe batter consistency.

Almost as good as Paris!  After a recent trip to Paris I wanted to recreate the crepe with Nutella and banana that I had.  This recipe was easy and quick.  The first one is a throw away, just like pancakes.  I found that if you take your pan off the heat, pour the batter and swirl in a circle it works just as well as those little wood spreaders the parisians use.  It tasted pretty darn close to the original, minus the view.

I just made crepes for the first time using this recipe.  I had to add more water because the batter was too thick.  I made savory crepes with chicken, spinach and a bechamel sauce- great dinner!

My husband thinks these are better than the crepe restaurant in town.  I make these sweet by sub-ing in sugar and then add bananas with white chocolate sauce or peanut butter.

So easy to make. I filled it with fresh bananas with added sugar that melted, giving it a sort of carmelized flavor and topped it off with cinnamon powder and strawberry jam....I had a hard time beating out the lumps though.

I was looking for an easy crepe recipe one day, and I stumbled across this one in my search. It looked so simple, I just had to try it! I did, and it was delicious, it's great just sprinkled with powdered sugar, or filled with Nutella (a chocolate-hazlenut spread). Depending on how hot your pan gets, you may have to cook the second side of your crepe for less time than the recipe says. Overall, this is an amazing recipe with basic ingriedients you already have in your pantry!

This is one of our breakfast staples. We also add 1/4 cup granulated sugar AND 1/4 cup powdered sugar. The granulated sugar makes the edges crispy.

It was a great recipe, I have failed many times with crepes, but this recipe made it easier. Now all I have to do is just add what I want. (Don't ask how I have failed i am skilled like that). This is a good recipe.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I was a little worried because i used soy milk (it's what i keep around), but they turned out fantastic.  I made savory crepes for dinner tonight and layered the extras between wax paper and put them in the fridge. i worked at a gelateria in high school and we made crepes and stored them such. Microwave for 15 seconds and they're good to go, although i'll probably try warming them on the stove over low heat...fresh strawberries and nutella for tomorrow!! Thank you for posting this.

This is a fantastic crepe recipe, I generally have to add a bit more water to get it the consistency that I like and a tbsp of sugar or so - but it is a no fail recipe. I don't use butter but use Pam spray instead. I make ours up with Nutella and fresh strawberries with a swirl of spray whip cream or with Nutella, fresh banana slices, Hershey syrup and whip cream. You can put anything in these - as you can tell we like them as a sweet treat. Thanks for sharing!

Very Easy and really delicous. I didnt need to oil my pan at all the crepes were so buttery. Next time I might even cut back on the butter just a little. I added a little Vanilla extract to the batter. For filling I used fresh strawberries and banana slices. Then on top I drizzled melted Nutella and topped with Whip Cream. I was able to get 12 large crepes from this batter. My friends and family agreed this was a good recipe. Very Easy to make.

These crepes are wonderful!  I undercooked the first one, but followed the directions better with the second one.  Be sure they brown before you turn them so they aren't mushy inside.  They taste great with butter and powdered sugar or even just a little jelly.

Let rest for 30-60 min. (I tested one before and after. Less rubbery after a rest)  Added 2 Tbsp sugar to make them sweet and 1.5 Tbsp water to thin & for the Colorado altitude.  
For some reason this batter coats the pan easier than other recipes I have used - but not too thick.  Will be my new crepe recipe.  Thanks!  
P.S. My 11 yr old daughter helped make them to share with a european themed Girl Scout meeting.Due to the sugar, they were even great plain. I have been asked to make a double batch next time and her friends request them when they come over to play!

These were great!
My husband and I just had the rare treat of being together for lunch time on a weekday, and so I wanted to make something a little more special than just sandwiches.
These were great, even with my changes.  My microwave was broken so I couldn't melt butter, so I used vegetable oil instead, and I also didn't have normal milk (we drink soy milk), just our coffee half & half so I used 3/4 water and 1/4 half & half.
I filled with ham and cheese, and it was a delicious and easy lunch!  Thanks for the recipe!

In the 60's, I used my best crepe recipe for appetizers and petite desserts,  which was 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c milk and 2 egg yolks to make 12 5-6 inch crepes.  Wanting to make 8" crepes for a fruit dessert and not use 8 yolks, I used this recipe doubled rather than quading my tried recipe.  Other reviews - too thick, too thin....I find this perfect.  I doubled to 2 C flour, 1 1/2 c 2% milk + 1/2 c water,  everything else the same.  PERFECT. Made 10 8" crepes. Now this is my keeper!

Perfect! I added some orange juice to the mix. I like them simply sprinkled with sugar and rolled up. Hot or cold. I could eat these any time of day.

I just made these crepes--after not having made crepes in years. I replaced the butter with Promise spread and used lactose-free fat-free milk. They turned out really good with a great texture. I didn't flip them over to cook as this is not what I know to be the classic way to cook crepes. I also used a real crepe pan and highly recommend using this or at least a small teflon saute pan. I filled them with warm Mott's applesauce, strawberry jam and jack cheese. Going to use cream cheese next time.

So easy and so good. I always mix crepe batter in a blender so lumps are not an issue. I added 1 TB sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla since I was making dessert crepes. I have a crepe maker and this recipe worked very will with it after adding an additional 2 tablespoons of flour. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I've never made crepes before and I'm terrible at making pancakes, but this recipe was so good an so easy.  Foolproof.  Next time I would add a bit of sugar, but otherwise this recipe was great!

This is the perfect recipie for crepes.  I added about 1 tablespoon of sugar because the fruit I got to go in them was very tart.  I mixed all the wet ingreadents first and then added the dry.  With crepes its important that they get mixed really well.  

Thank you thank you thank you!

I made these crepes because of the many great reviews... I'm not sure why people like them so much. Maybe they've never tasted real crepes? As another reviewer said, adding the flour first makes them rubbery... the texture is just off.  They taste very plain, which is fine, because you're free to make them sweet and savory from there. I'd recommend trying another recipe. I'm going to.

I thought these were too bland (had to add sugar and vanilla), too thick (had to add milk) and too lumpy.  And very rubbery.  Adding the flour so soon means having to mix the flour too much, which makes them too chewy.

I used butter flavored cooking spray in the pan. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon of sugar as suggested by many. They are quick, easy and delicious. I prepared some strawberry sauce by heating diced strawberries with a little tiny bit of water, a few tablespoons of sugar and about one teaspoon diluted cornstarch. I filled the crepes with this sauce , rolled them and dusted them with powdered sugar....Voila! / Made them without adding anything to the batter and it works very well as is too. If you intend to use them with a sweet filling or topping, I would make as is so that they whole dish is not too sweet. The batter comes out a bit thicker than I would prefer but it still works very well. I made a blackberry compote, filled with vanilla pudding and topped with fresh berries and whipped cream. Very good!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but they were not real crepes at all. Real crepes are supposed to be golden all over and have a delicate, more floury texture. These were thin, but rubbery and stiff. I'll keep looking for other recipes.

These are the BEST and EASIEST crepes ever.  I modified a bit to suit our tastes by adding a dash of vanilla and about 2 teas. sugar to the batter and mixing it with a hand mixer to avoid any lumps, and they were great.  We topped them with sliced strawberries that had been sprinkled with a little sugar and left to sit while the crepes cooked. Did the same with blueberries that we had on hand. Then rolled them, sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with a little whipped cream.  WONDERFUL, Elegant and Easy.  You can also make the batter the night before and refrigerate if you're in a hurry.  My youngest likes to eat them right out of the pan!  He's also heated leftover crepes in the microwave, wrapped sliced ham and cheese in them and made a quick snack or weekend lunch with the leftovers :)  Easy, great tasing and versatile too!

This was my first time trying to make crepes and found this recipe to be easy to follow and easy to make. I modified the recipe slightly to add more flavor. I added about 1/8 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. The flavor was amazing! I cooked them in an 8 inch skillet to make them small, using about 1/8 cup of batter for each. Then I mixed 8 ounces cream cheese and some mixed berries with a little sugar (to taste) to knock off the bitterness as a filling. Then I rolled them and topped them with powdered sugar. Whipped Cream would have made them awesome, too! Definately a keeper recipe!

To be honest, I felt the crepes came out a little bland.  So I made a lot of alterations to it the next time I made it.  I added 4 Tbsp. sugar, two dashes of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  They turned out great!  Probably the best crepes I've ever had.  Topping it off with a "syrup" made of fresh sliced strawberries and sugar mashed together, and a scoop of whipped cream made it all the better.

This was my first time making & eating crepes. I admit I was intimidated, but I needn't have been though, this was super easy! My English husband who has had the genuine thing agreed that we loved them! 
The trick to making them "the authentic way" is to pour a tiny bit of batter (no where near as much as 1/4 cup) and then dump the rest back into your mix to get them thin and crispy on the edges. We used a 6" non-stick skillet and didn't use any oil and didn't have any problems w/ sticking. 
My husband ate them w/ plain yogurt & fruit, I ate them w/ butter (margarine) and powdered (confectioners') sugar. Delicious! Just the right consistency: light & fluffy, not too sweet goodness. I can only eat 1 pancake because of the heaviness, but ate quite a lot of these! They yielded about 25, 5-inch crepes.
As suggested, we added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients.

good basic recipe, i like that it is made fom ingredients that are usually on hand.  i think it could use a little more flavor but i guess it depends on if ur doing something sweet or savory with it. ive only used this recipe to make sweet crepes and when i do, i add vanilla =)

I stuffed my crepes with smoked shaved ham,provolone cheese and parmesan cheese. I top the crepes with cheese sauce made of butter and provolone cheese, baked until the cheese bubbled (12 minutes).I baked them  at 300 degrees.
My husband said they were a little bland.  So, next time I will add basil,garlic,ground pepper hot peppers and scallions to the batter.
The crepe recipes was a good base recipe.
I bought the pancake pan that was seen on TV.  I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $3.00 on the clearance rack.  The pan works really well.  Every crepe was the same size and cooked to perfection.

These are awesome, and so quick!  I used vanilla soy milk, and in place of butter I used melted Benecol spread.  Filled with fresh fruit and vanilla ice cream and topped with caramel ice cream topping.  Only thing I might do next time is add cinnamon to the batter.

This is a nice crepe recipe.  I added a few things that made it extra yummy.  Lemon zest, orange peel, grand marnier and a 1/2 tsp. of sugar with a slight sprinkling of sugar before folding into quarters.  Set out several toppings for a breakfast with family and everyone tried several different combinations.  Strawberries with vanilla yogurt or whipped cream, orange marmalade and strawberry jam, butter and sugar, and lemon with sugar. All were delicious.

I used my crepe maker and it was easy as pie. I encourage everyone if you are an avid fan of crepes to buy a crepe maker, because this recipe works perfectly with the crepe maker. No messes, no hassles- just yummy crepes. I served them for breakfast three ways:
With Nutella (VERY good!!!!!!!)
With Butter, Vanilla, Powdered Sugar (mix in bowl and spread on crepe)
With Yogurt and Fresh fruit
Great recipe; thanks!

LOVE this recipe.  Shared it with anyone that would listen.  I throw the lumpy batter into the blender for smoother texture.
Now...what to put in it....hmmmm... anything you like.     I liked slicing a banana in a thin long fashion.  Adding either chocolate or vanilla pudding and rolling it.
YUMMY.  Drizzles chocolate over the vanilla/banana filling.  WOW

Thank you!  I've finally found a crepe recipe that is the right consistency and oh-so-delicious that you can eat them just like that!  Or top 'em with fruit, jams or jellies, powdered sugar, etc.  My nieces even melt cheese in 'em to make a yummy savory crepe!  These keep really well for a couple of days in the fridge too if you want something to nuke up in a hurry for a weekday breakfast!

I'm a college student and it's difficult for me to find recipes that are not only quick and easy, but to which I actually possess the ingredients! These crepes were great. I ate them plain and with syrup. So delicious. My roomates are ecstatic that I've discovered this recipe. :)

The kid friendly rating is based on my husband's idea that he would probably have liked it as a kid :)  These were fast and tasty.  I'll definitely make them again, and often!

I have NEVER made a crepe in my life.  Wasn't even sure I could spell it to look for a recipe LOL.  We hang out with friends every other weekend and this weeks theme was "Breakfast for Dinner".  They turned out amazing!  I did add a little sugar to the mix because ours were more of a dessert but they turned out amazing and super easy.  I was so worried about flipping but I sprayed the pan before each crepe. Easy peasey!

I tried a few crepe recipes and this was the best.  I made three batches of crepes (40 crepes) for a neighborhood progressive brunch. Things I learned: real butter is the best and the pan only need a very light re-coat; I use a blender to mix and then pop it into the fridge for an hour but if I leave in the fridge for two hours, it will be a little too think; A mid grade 8" no stick pan works fine and the white ceramic ones caused some difficulty.  I switched to using a pitcher to pour a scant 1/4 cup into the pan. It was faster. Practice with pan was a winning move. I served four different recipes: savory chicken; sweet riccotta with peaches and cognac; Nutella with strawberries and lastly cream cheese with berries.

Mixing the eggs and flour first makes it irretrievably lumpy, and there is not enough liquid to make the right consistency.

I used whole wheat flour. Not exact texture like bleached white, but still turned out nicely and healthy too. Also, I mixed all liquids first using my vitamix, then added dry ingredients. No lumps. Not sure why instructions say to mix eggs and flour first. I used my electric flat griddle on 200 degrees and did not have to use oil. Make sure you spread the batter super duper thin.

Delicious! I didn't have to make any changes, but if you are eating these plain, you may want to add vanilla to give the crepes a little flavor. I like to serve mine with fried bananas (1 sliced banana tossed in a cinnamon/nutmeg/sugar mixture and lightly fried in butter), and top with homemade whipped cream (cold heavy whipping cream sweetened with a little bit of maple syrup). This recipe is the perfect base for whatever topping you plan on adding!

I use low fat milk so skip the water and increase milk to 1 1/2 cups for thinner batter. I also add 1 teaspoon of sugar to the recipe if I am making sweet crepes. I mix all the ingredients in a quart mason jar using an immersion blender and this way I can put the lid on to store any leftover batter saving on dishes. My family loves them for breakfast stuffed with fruit and maple syrup. I do miss my old crepe pan though that I could dip in the batter rather than pour for yet thinner crepes. I would recommend having two pans on the go if you have a large family like I do (7). Also, be careful not to overcook these as they become stiff and crispy and difficult to roll. On the other hand if they are too thick then they become more difficult to cook right through.

Great recipe! I created the gluten free, minimal dairy version, using gluten-free flour and almond milk. I did use real butter and eggs. I added vanilla and about double the water to make the batter thin out (was too thick to spread at first) and they turned out great. A sprinkle of powder sugar and they were done. Yum!

Have used this several times now (as it is posted)and it's a great base recipe. I use for cottage cheese rolls mostly, but would not hesitate for use as fruit crepe also. I have used blender to do final blending to be sure to get all the lumps out, but mixer would be fine also.

Super recipe! I followed the recommendation of sifting the flour into the rest of the ingredients, and it worked perfectly. They're tasty even without adding vanilla extract, but I added some halfway through and it definitely gave our breakfast crepes that extra pizzazz.

This is a really amazing crepes recipe. I got addicted to crepes while on vacation in DC and these are better! I'm not a great cook and I couldn't believe how great they turned out. I followed the directions with one exception, I added the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients like the most helpful reviewer suggests.

I gave this four stars only because of the horrible, lumpy mess that resulted from following the directions to add the wet ingredients to the dry ones; however, after fighting with it for a few minutes most of the lumps were out, and the end product was absolutely delicious! I will be making these again(but I will add dry ingredients to wet in the future!).

Excellent recipe.  Foolproof.  I've even used almond milk instead of cow milk.  Delicious.  Will definitely make it again.  NOTE:  I used 1/4 cup batter in a 10" nonstick skillet.

Made these this morning and they were a huge hit, especially with my kids! My 5 year old ate 4 of them with a strawberry cream cheese filling that I made. Followed the recipe as written except in the mixing process I mixed all wet ingredients together first and then added the flour and salt. Found these much easier than I expected. Thanks for this recipe it's a keeper!

As Morley says, mix the wet ingredients first or you'll have a lumpy mess. I use egg whites and cut the butter in half and use 1/4 milk and 3/4 cup water. This is my kids' favorite Saturday brunch. We just pat with butter and sprinkle a little sugar on them, then toll them up to enjoy.

I really liked this recipes for a simple beginner recipe, however i found that the batter was too think so I had to add about half a cup more water (I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk, but the consistency was about the same as whole milk so i knew I'd have to compensate a little). Aside from needing a bit of extra water though, this recipe was awesome and I'd definitely use it again as a base recipe for adding to. Wonderful!

This recipe is great. I picked it because of another review by a chef that instructed using butter instead of oil in the batter so that the crepes carmelize.  Additionally this review mentioned that sifting(therby aerating the flour)'is a must and the pan should be hot. All tips right on the money.  A big thank you to the person with these tips. While this is a great recipe, not specifying either weight or sifting for the flour used will make for very mixed results.

A couple of my own tips:
     - I used a stainless steel pan, heated it up to medium hot(water sizzles but pan is not smoking). Getting the right pan is tricky. Use Pam for the first one and for further crepes only as necesary.
     -  Use a pan you can actually pick up to roll while spreading the batter. Be prepared to roll the pan as you pour the batter. I found that pouring the batter towards the edge of the pan away from you is best and tilt the pan towards you when you pour - this makes the crepe thinner and more even.
      - Keep some water next to you when making the crepes. You may need to thin the batter to get to the crepes right. Add water a tablespoon at a time. Before you pour the batter into the pan, mix the batter each time - it will thicken  at the bottom.

Lastly, don't bother with the multi-step mixing process - just put all ingredients in a bowl and mix with a whisk.

This recipe was OK for BASIC crepes. However, the batter (like many reviewers have said) was VERY lumpy and hard to deal with. I had to squeeze the flour with my hands to get it to flatten out. I ended up wasting batter and straining it. 

Taste was excellent; I just had lumpy parts that would have tasted weird if I hadn't topped them with nutella.

All in all: this was ok for very basic crepes; I would have def. changed the order of flour and eggs and the other ingredients. Add flour last if you want to try this recipe.

Excellent recipe for extra thin crepes or something a little more substantial. I like a slightly heavier crepe, personally, and this works just great

This is my go-to crepe recipe. If I'm just making sweet crepes I add some sugar to the mix. They freeze wonderfully if you place a piece of wax paper between each one and then put in a zippy bag. You can peel off as many as you want and by the time your morning tea has brewed your crepes are thawed. Also, there is no need for a special crepe pan, just get a regular non-stick pan and never ever use anything metal on it, the scratches are what makes the crepes stick. My pan is only used for crepes and the only utensil I use on it is a wooden chopstick to free up a stuck edge. As soon as the crepe begins to move easily around the pan when you shake it a bit it's ready to flip. After a few practice flips you'll be flipping them like an old diner cook in no time :)

This is the recipe I've been making for over 30 years! It's a family favorite. The only difference for me is that I blend all of the ingredients for 60 seconds [scraping the sides of the blender after 15 secs]. No sifting needed! I also melt the butter on the stove before adding it to blender. I love these crepes!

You need this recipe! I make them so often I don't need to use the recipe. Simple changes make these wonderful for both sweet and savory crepes. Do NOT omit resting the batter in the fridge. Eaters will laude you kitchen "skills"! ;)

I did a few things different, as others have stated I mixed the wet ingredients first then sifted in the flour.  My son is allergic to dairy so I did some substitutions.  I used almond milk in place of the regular milk, butter flavoring in place of the butter but half of the amount(can be found in with the specialty cake decorating) and zero calorie Sprite in place of the water (this added a little lime to the batter).  I also used cooking spray instead of oil in my pan.  We added chopped strawberries with a little bit of sugar on them that had been slightly mashed to the top. For those of use who were not allergic to the dairy I made a whip cream/cream cheese filling which is 8 oz cream cheese mixed until smooth first, one small container of whip cream, 1/3 c of sugar and 1 t vanilla, mixed until smooth. 30 very happy breakfast eaters.

I agree with Morley that you should add everything together or at least add the flour last. Mixing just the flour and eggs makes a very thick pasta dough, which is basically impossible to fully break up when you add the liquids. I wound up having to pour my mix through a strainer because there were so many clumps in there. The video tells you to add all the ingredients together. (Button right below the photo). Wish I had seen that before I made these! I also added a quarter cup of confectionary sugar to make it sweet for a dessert. I put a pat of butter in the pan between each crepe, which made them simply ethereal. Delicious, easy recipe that I will make again and again.

Quick and easy to follow, this crepes recipe is a delicious way to whip a quick breakfast or even lunch depending on the fillings you like to use, i grew up having crepes for breakfast with cheese, eggs, bacon, jelly and whipped cream or a light version for and afternoon snack with all kinds of berry and pulverized sugar, as I grew older I started playing with many different kinds of combinations, alfredo chicken and mushroom is my latest favorite, quick, easy and delish what else can you ask for? make a batch and add your fave fillings you will not regret it! enjoy!

Very easy turned out great my first time making crepes. I added 1t vanilla and 2T sugar for dessert crepes and made them per the recipe for dinner crepes. Both worked well! For the dinner crepes I put sour cream and chive mashed potatoes on the inside and made a veggie cheese sauce to spread on it - turned out amazing!

Unfortunately, this recipe didn't work out well for me. The crepes were thick, tasteless and rubbery (after reading several reviews, I wasn't the only one with this problem). I made it as per the video where all ingredients expect the butter are mixed together all at once and then butter is added at the end. I had stacked them up with chocolate pudding between each layer and dusted with cocoa powder before serving. I kept it in the fridge for several hours and left it at room temperature for a while before serving. When I bit into it, I was surprised that the crepes were rubbery. No one had seconds, and I ended up throwing the rest out the next day. Unfortunately, I won't be making this recipe again. I find the rating very misleading. There are better crepe recipes on this site that are closer to what a real crepe should taste like (thin and lacy).

Perfectly thin consistency for crepes.  I used whole wheat flour, and sifted dry ingredients into wet ones, then added melted butter.  It yielded seven, 8-inch crepes.

DELICIOUS!  Like another reviewer suggested, I added ¼ cup sugar to the batter.  Definitely add the dry ingredients to the wet or you'll be whisking forever.

Absolutely LOVED. I did mix the wet ingredients first and then added the flour last. I also added 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar since I know I was going to use these as dessert crapes. I'm from Europe and this is exactly the way my mom makes it. DELICIOUS!!! Also this amount made about 6 or 7 crapes so if you are making this for more people I suggest doubling the ingredients. It stores well in the fridge or freezer between wax paper.

These turned out great!  You can easily make them sweet or savory just depending on what you put on them.

Very neutral taste, ready to create either savory or sweet crêpe. Simply prepared from ingredients you already have in your kitchen. I used whole-wheat flour, with no negative consequences - just a bit more 'chewy'.

Easy to make and nice and thin/eggy like a French crepe! Only complaint is that this yields only 4-5 crepes and I wanted more!

I've tried many crepe recipes and this one is perfect. Simple and delicious & the crepes don't stick to the pan! if i'm making a sweet crepe meal vs savoury, I do add a ts of vanilla.

I honestly don't know how this recipe has received such high ratings. It is ok but defiantly not great. I won't make it again. It is tastes like flour even thought it was cooked long enough. The texture doesn't seem quite right and it tastes too much like butter.

simple, basic recipe. you can add vanilla to the batter or whatever you want. I use my round cast iron griddle but any nonstick pan will work, and according to the joy of cooking, you can leave the batter in the fridge for up to 2 days (covered of course) so long as you let it come to room temp for 30 minutes before using. I served mine today with just a little sugar and lemon but pretty much anything works with a crepe except for....ok I can't think of anything that won't work with a crepe. What a diverse food!

This is a great recipe, but the directions need to be modified: do NOT put the flour in first, mix all wet ingredients before adding salt and flour. Add flour gradually.

I love this recipe! Very simple and delish! I used this recipe for a French Project and it worked out wonderfully! I was actually quite surprised! I will now be using this recipe on the long weekends! I am so glad it did not call for sugar, normally I'm very stingy when a recipe calls for a bucket load of sugar but all in all great! (:

instead of 4 servings, i made one, the batter came out to the right consistency, no problems coming out of the pan, but it was way too salty for my likely. overall with some improvisation of my own, its a well recipe :)

Easy to make and tastes great. A great tip to get rid of the lumps in the batter is to tilt the bowl a bit to the side and beat it good with a wisk.

I filled these with a combination of raspberries and blueberries as well as a handful with cinnamon apples for a brunch and people were clamoring for more. I was a glutton and ate 3 myself, because they were so good. Nice and thin, but they held up to rolling and were very easy to make.

I have tried many Crepe recipes which have failed in one way or the other.  Most require overnight refrigeration, which of course I never remember to make the batter the night before.  This was easy (I am not a talented cook) and delicious.  I added a little vanilla to the batter.  I didn't listen to the previous reviewer and do the wet ingredients first and I did end up with lumps, so next time I will try that.

I totally loved this! And I even surprised my mom with it on breakfst =D 
We stuffed 'em with nutella and banana slices. mmmm.
as well another stuffing was jam.
and since my family prefers light food, I replaced the butter with oil. A PERFECT WAY TO START A DAY!!!

i mixed as specified but let the batter rest several hours in the refrigerator as this was to be used for a warm dessert.  No lumps if it rests.

I make these all the time for my family. I use a microwave safe mixing bowl to melt the butter, then throw in the water then milk, then the eggs, then the flour and just wisk it all together - turns out beautifully every time. Also, I use a wide flipper or a counter scraper to spread the crepe out in the pan after pouring batter in - rinse between each crepe - and they are always as thick or as thin as we'd like!

Very easy to make! I made these for breakfast and filled some with strawberry and sugar mixture and some with eggs and bacon.  Next time I make this with fruit, I will add a little sugar and vanilla.  I would love to make these in my next manicotti dish instead of stuffing the shells.

The crepes are "meh." the melted butter makes the consistency lumpy and the crepes are too thick for my liking. I suggest using vegetable oil instead of the butter. It makes it a smoother consistency and not as lumpy.

I love crepes! They are quick and easy to make and are easily adjustable for breakfast, dinner or desserts. This recipe is very good but I do like to use all milk instead of the water. Also, you can change it up by using Coconut Milk for a great, light coconut taste!

Delicious and so light and soft. I followed Morley's suggestion of mixing wet ingredients first and then adding dry ingredients and it was a winning combination. Will definitely make these again.

These crepes were so easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, although my batter did come out a little lumpy as some reviews stated.  Next time, I will try what one user suggested of mixing the eggs and wet ingredients and then sifting in the flour. 
 I also thought that these were just a bit too thick for crepes.  Next time, I might add an additional 1/4 cup of milk.
I served these stuffed with bacon, scrambled eggs and sharp cheddar cheese inside.  They were fantastic!

These turned out perfectly!  I did what other people suggested and mixed the wet ingredients first and then stirred in the flour.  Right after you flip them, you can layer in ham and cheese or veggies and then fold them over to warm/melt everything.  Yum!  I also made sweet ones with Nutella and sliced banana, and others with lemon curd.  They were a hit.  I have tried other crepe recipes before, but none were nearly this successful!

I was super impressed with the recipe because, being from Quebec, I know that a good crepe is really hard to find....even more so to make yourself.  I had never attempted making my own before this and it was a huge success.  I only had to add a little more water than called for.  No longer do you need to be afraid to make crepes!

This is just great! Been looking for a good recipe for crepes. Thank God I found, I'm planning to make crepes for my friends. I read from here that electric crepe makers are good for making large amount of crepes. Might try it. What do you think?

These are so easy and so delicious, perfect for serving to guests. I'm no expert on crepes, only having eaten them maybe 3 times before but as a first time experiment making them, they came out phenomenal. I halved the recipe to make 2 medium sized crepes, filled them with berries topped and topped them with confectioner's sugar. I do recommend adding a dash of vanilla for flavor though.

Definitely don't add the flour and eggs together and wisk ... simply put all your wet ingredients into your mixing bowl and then wisk.

Perfect!!! First time i tried this and i made an absolutely delicious crepe! Most crepe recipes from Youtube said that you will break the first crepe you make...i disagree after trying this one from allrecipe. It's the best...It made me sign up so I can save this one! Thanks to JENNYC819 for sharing this recipe. 5 stars!!!

This recipe does work, but I feel the consistency is a bit too thick and not easy to make a thin crepe.
I just adjust it by putting less flour or putting more water/milk

Wow!  Easy, and delicious!  What a treat!  Per another suggestion, I added 1/3 cup granulated sugar and 1.4 cup powdered sugar to the batter.  Amazing.  I also followed another suggestion and blended the "wet" ingredients first, and then slowly added the "dry" ingredients to this to avoid lumpiness.  It worked well.  If you still have lumps, just wait fine minutes and whisk again... they should all have absorbed.  I initially served these with fresh strawberries, jam, and a dusting of powdered sugar, but found that they were amazing with JUST the powdered sugar on top.  What a treat and SO easy!

These crepes come out delicious. Have tried to make them many times before and I finally found a keeper. If you want them sweet I add 1/3 cup of sugar to the mix and add some bakers sugar to the crepes.

very easy and tasty recipe! I put everything in my food processor and mixed it up, added 1 tbsp vanilla sugar and a dash of cinnamon. I also heated the water and milk in the microwave which really helps make a smooth batter, sometimes I do need to add an extra 1 tbsp of water depending on the time of year. 
Double recipe with 1/3 cup measure makes 11 crepes, 1 minute on each side.
Filled with jam and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.

Came out absolutely perfect.  Spread a little nutella down the middle and filled with fresh strawberries. Amazing. And I got 8 crepes exactly out of it, just like the recipe said. (I usually come out with a different yield of most recipes.)

In general, it is very hard to get a smooth batter when the recipe calls for "whisking" eggs and flour together first. I found the batter to be lumpy. I was not using an electric mixer though, so perhaps I need one of those to make the batter work.

These were great !! Very easy to make (in the kitchenaid), my 12 year old made them for breakfast with lemons and sugar. 
She omitted the salt because our butter is salted but I would add some back in next time.
They kept warm and moist in a folded teatowel until all ready.
Will definitely keep this recipe.

So GLAD I read the reviews carefully before using this recipe.  I, too, mixed the wet ingredients together, as opposed to wet & dry.  Made the batter very nice and smooth.  Excellent.  I made vegetable crepes for dinner last night (sauteed eggplant, red peppers & onion) and then raspberry & whipped cream dessert crepes. So good, we are going to serve these to dinner guests next month.

delicious, and SO easy! I was craving this out of nowhere, googled a crepe recipe and was glad I had all of the ingredients for this! I love not having to go out to buy that missing thing.  made a delicious savory ham, cheddar and sour cream crepe, and then a nutella crepe for dessert.  LOVE!

Excellent recipe.  I can get approximately 8 plate sized crepes.  Substitute these for pasta in a lasagna dish, layering with meat sauce, cottage cheese.  You can also spread some ricotta cheese on the underside of each crepe for extra creaminess.

These were the perfect texture! Your instructions were also helpful; I'd never made crepes before, so with your instructions and the advice of a friend to flip when it had a "delicate lace pattern," these crepes were perfection. I had to REALLY beat them to smooth the batter out, and I also used a cup of fat free milk instead of half milk and half water. I added 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar to make them desert crepes. Heavenly!

These crepes made a lovely Mother's Day brunch for my family and I--I am planning on having them for Valentine's Day. Nutella is a marvelous touch, and if you halve a banana and put one half in each crepe, then slather it with Nutella, it tastes just wonderful. Yum!

Easy recipes and tastes JUST like the crepes my mom makes. This will be my go to crepes recipe from now on. AWESOME!  Only changes I made were to add 3 tablespoons of UNSALTED butter instead of 2. It was nice an buttery flavored without taking away the texture of the crepes. I also put the liquids in one bowl while putting the flour in the other and slowly adding the liquid while whisking. I felt like it would have been too chunky adding the eggs to the flour. Turned out AMAZING!

This recipe was perfect for our breakfast night.  We actually ended up doing it two nights in a row!  But we had to double the recipe to have enough for a full meal for four. I came from a pancake family, but my husband is a crepes kind of guy.  He specifically requested that I make crepes, and he was not disappointed with this recipe.  Neither was I, considering how quickly these cook up in comparison with pancakes!   When I had roughly a third of the batter left, I added a few tablespoons of white sugar and used those as dessert crepes.  We filled the normal ones with meat and cheese and topped with sour cream, and we filled the dessert crepes with either a mixture of cream cheese, confectioners sugar, and coolwhip and topped it with strawberries, or we spread butter and cinnamon/sugar over it before topping with a sweet cinnamon pear sauce, or we simply filled them with a custard pudding.  So delicious!  We will definitely be using this recipe again and again!

I followed the directions and mixed flour and egg first, and had the same problem as others where the batter was later lumpy. Wet ingredients first, then add flour! Otherwise, five stars!

Batter was a little thick.  I had to add about 1/8 cup more water.  I hadn't made crepes in years...so it took a couple "oops" crepes before I got the hang of it.  Served with whipped cream and strawberries.  So delicious.

I made crepes for Christmas breakfast and served rolled up with lingonberries. Tasty and lovely. The recipe was very easy, though I had to get the hang of swirling the batter in a frying pan. The first crepe I made was pretty pathetic. You have to swirl the batter quickly around the pan immediately after putting the 1/4 cup of batter in the hot frying pan. I used a frying pan that has curved sides, and this worked great.

I wanted a sweeter crepe so I added powdered sugar and vanilla until it was to my liking. I also had to add more milk and water because the batter was too thick and pancake like. I put scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon in half and a sweet apple filling in the other. This was my first attempt at making crepes and overall it was pretty simple and after a few tweaks, delicious.

Very easy to prepare! I added tsp of Vanilla extract. Also it works with non-real butter. I suggest a medium heat or something not too high. I burned my first crepe and tossed it. I turned down the heat and they came out so perfect and became very simple to cook! I had it with bananas, banana syrup, and whip cream! Totally delicious, thin, delicate, and tastey! I would love to eat it with spinach and cheese too!!  Pour, flip, and serve. I got more of the batter in the fridge for a quick crepe any time. I totally recommend this recipe. :) Easy peasy!

This recipe was GREAT!!!! The thought of making crepes was kind of intimidating, but the recipe was very easy. Like some of the others I mixed the wet ingredients first then added the dry ones. Served with a mixture of chicken, mushrooms, garlic, onion and swiss cheese.

Thank you JENNYC819 and also to the other members that put in additional comments on this recipe.  I had to try this recipe last night and wow, they were as simple as can be to make and they really turned out great.  I took the advice of the other members and put the wet ingredients together first and then the dry... no lumps at all.  I didn't really want a sweet crepe as I am not a big sweet eater so I typed in "crepe fillings" on this site.  I went with the "Spinach, Mushroom and Bacon" filling but skipped on the "Warm Egg Sauce" that person suggested to put on top of these crepes and went with a simple topping of diced tomatoes with a hint of jalapenos for a zesty flavor to jazz it up a little.  They are absolutely great tasting.  We are eating like royalty over here.  Nice change of pace!  Thanks again.  Have a great day!

This is a great basic recipe that can be adapter to suit many tastes.  I do find that it is better slightly thinner so I tend to add either more milk or water about 1/3 or a cup and the mix seems to spead out quite tin and evenly.

Decent enough as a base recipe.  However, IMO, the flour to egg ratio (key for crepes) is a little too flour-heavy.

This was the very first crepe batter recipe I used, and it was a complete hit.  The only change I made was to let the better chill in the fridge for an hour before use.

The best and easiest recipe!  Everything was already in my pantry.  Make it a breakfast crepe with scrambled eggs, or pb&j or nuttella and sliced bananas for the kids.  My favorite is plain greek yogurt with honey and a little pure vanilla extract.  Yummy!  Has a permanent spot in my recipe book.  *Mix wet and dry ingredients seperate and then wisk dry into wet a little at a time to prevent from lumping.

Extremely simple and fun to make. You get to mix-it-up with your fillings so this recipe never gets old. Adding a splash of vanilla is fun and adding a little more butter makes the crepe spread thinner.

I've always wanted to try making crepes and this was a great recipe to start with.  I used (for 1st time) white whole wheat flour, so I ended up using a little more milk (2%) and water. Still came out great!!  My husband wanted his crepes a little more "wet" looking, so I cooked his in butter.  Will so use this over and over.

Great, easy recipe! I actually dumped everything in a blender which made pouring it into the pan super-easy. I topped it with ligonberry preserves.

I made these for breakfast this morning. It was easy and delicious. I did modify the recipe a bit - I used whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose flour; 1 tsp. vanilla extract; 1 tsp. sugar & 1 T extra water. I mixed all the wet ingredients first then added the flour. I spread Nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) on each of the crepes with sliced bananas & strawberries, rolled them up and put them in a non-stick skillet on low to keep warm. I plated them and dusted with powdered sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

Really good.  I agree with mixing the dry and wet ingredients seperate, than whisking the dry into the wet. I also added a quarter cup of ginger ale (can also use any clear carbonated beverage) to make them more fluffy.

These crepes are very egg-y, both in taste and texture. If that's not what you're going for, I would recommend using a different recipe. Otherwise, they were ok, but not brilliant.

quick, easy & delicious!  I also added a little powdered sugar to the batter.  We had them plain, with choc chips, wth blueberries, with bananas.  We roll them up lightly and then give another sprinkle of powdered sugar.  My kids love to put whip cream as well as ice cream on them!

Followed recipe exactly except that I mixed the eggs and milk and slowly whisked in the flour.  Then added the water and butter. First time around my batter was a little lumpy and this fixed the problem but still had the same end result...perfect crepes!

Fantastic consistency.  Beautiful.  My kids ask for this EVERY Saturday morning.  I modified this to get a more traditional thinner texture by using 1 cup milk and also used only 2-3 tsp of butter.  No extra oil/butter necessary for the pan.  They freeze very well separated by wax paper too. Yummy!

I just made this recipe two minutes ago and LOVED it. I rolled sliced strawberries inside the crepes and it was delicious. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It was very easy to make and is an excellent substitute for breakfast instead of eating eggs all the time.

I had never made crepes before but wanted to try it for a special birthday breakfast for my husband. These turned out great. I made a sweet filling using 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c powdered sugar, and 1/2 tsp lemon juice. I topped the crepes with a homemade strawberry topping. My husband said it tasted like "heaven in his mouth."

This is the best crepe recipe I've tried.  Each batch makes about 9 crepes.  Each time I make them I use a different blend of whole grain flours, and they always turn out great.  This time I used oat, corn, brown rice and sorghum flours.  They were very light, and you wouldn't even know it wasn't white flour.  I eat them with ham and cheese and they are truly amazing!

Such a versatile recipe--it should be a staple in every household. I`ve found that adding a lot of sugar makes them hard to turn unless I add a lot of oil/butter, which I try to stay away from. I did, however, add 1-2 tbsp of ground flax seed to make it a healthy breakfast! Goes great with some whipped cream cheese or yogurt and some fruit! My boyfriend likes to take the richer route and add Nutella and banana slices--that would make for a great dessert!

This is my go-to recipe for crepes.  They turn out perfectly every time.  Delicious with ham and cheese rolled in them...or as dessert, filled with strawberries and bananas.  Try them topped with the blueberry sauce recipe from this site -- out of this world!  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Blueberry-Sauce/Detail.aspx

This recipe is very simple and makes very nice crepes. I also love how fast it can be for an elegant breakfast. :) I sometimes just serve them sprinkled with cinnamon Sugar - but today I served them with blueberries and custard as a filling. Yum! I always a tad of sugar 2TB and a splash of Vanilla or substituting some of the milk with flavored creamer. Very yummy.

To make this a crepe style variation on the Chinese "scallion pancakes" I skipped the milk and used all water.  I also added minced green onion to the batter.  When done, cut into wedges and then dipped into equal parts soy sauce and vinegar. Done this way the scallion pancakes don't have to be kneaded and spiral-rolled so it is that much faster. It turned out quite good. Thanks!

Great recipe. Good for filling with either sweet or savory things. Though, I think it'd be better to add the flour last to all the other previously mixed ingredients to try to cut down on the lumpiness at first.

"Basic Crepe" excellent flavor! Did add a teaspoon of vanilla. Berries in season with a dollop of whipped cream. Unused batter just as good the next day.

So simple and easy to make!  I added a couple of tablespoons of sugar to make a sweet crepe then added some nutella and strawberries to the finished product.  It reminded me of my favorite crepe place.  Absolutely wonderful!

Fantastic recipe! Followed it to a T and impressed the in-laws, she insisted I make some more and bring it to her salon for the other ladies. :) The only thing is that it is difficult to get those large crepes. Mine end up being pancake sized, but we just end up rolling them into cannolis or folding them over like an omlette. Delicious!

Its been years since I made crepes and I was very pleased with how these turned out.  I made a filling of fresh bing cherries and almond and rum extracts, and topped the crepes with whipped cream and toasted almonds.  I have some crepes left over and am looking forward to trying them with different fillings.

Superb!  Make sure to mix the wet ingredients together first, then sift in the dry ingredients.  I added a splash of vanilla.

This recipe is GREAT!!! I live in Germany and the crepes I make with this recipe are just as good if not better than the ones that I get at the local restaurants. They are fun and easy to make also. Being a vegetarian I do not drink milk and very rarely eat eggs and have found that using vanilla soy milk and egg substitute   works well in place of regular milk and eggs.

Amazing crepes, however, definitely mix the liquid ingredients separately before adding the flour. I've made this with soy milk instead of regular; I've also added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to it with delicious results.

I love crepes, and this recipe was especially delicious and easy.  I would suggest using cold water though, especially since the butter is hot.  That way, the batter stays slightly chilly and you are left with more time to more evenly coat the pan.

These crepes are great, and so simple! I used this recipe the first time I made crepes, and they turned out perfect. I served them to friends for desert (filled with smashed strawberries and blueberries, banana slices, and vanilla ice cream; and topped with drizzles of chocolate sauce). Everyone loved them and asked me for the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing :)

So easy to prepare & it goes great with a savory chicken stuffing ... I found that if you add the flour to beaten eggs a little at a time you get a really smooth batter and easy to manage.

Very good- but to make them out of this world, add a bit of vanilla.  We also added a bit extra milk, as they were a tad thicker than we wanted.

This recipe was great. at first i thought the batter was too runny, but it was perfect. my first time making crepes was a big success thanks to this recipe. Note: i used a 8 inch pan, and this recipe made double the "serving size," so perhaps a serving is 2 crepes?

Simple, Easy and Delicious! I made two kinds of crepes- chocolate chip and crepes with apple pie filling. I bought a can of apple pie filling, warmed it on the the stove and put it in the crepes! Yum. Just make sure to wisk the lumps out of the batter really well!

While working in upscale restaurants with French chefs, I've had quite a few amazing crepes.  This recipe makes the easiest, best tasting crepes I've had yet!  I usually top is with powdered or granulated sugar, or fruit preserves.  I think the water in the recipe really helps to thin it out a little and make it lighter than many other recipes.

Great recipe! I love using this with strawberries and especially bananas with nutella. sprinkle some powdered sugar to add to the sweetness. DEFINITELY mix the dry stuff together and the wet stuff together before combining dry and wet. Less clumps. Use a wisk to easily get the clumps out.

My batter is always lumpy unless I sift my flour.  The taste is great and have added a tsp of sugar if I'm having them for breakfast.

Excellent recipe!  This is exactly what you would be looking for in a crepe.  The only thing that I did different is adding a little sugar to sweeten them up.  Just about 1-2 tsp.  Cooked up great but did not need to be cooked for the suggested 2 min.  Just long enough to cook the batter is sufficient.  Also great when you roll slightly heated raspberries mixed with sugar inside...  my kids favorite!

Very easy/delicious recipe. I used a ladle to pour the batter into the pan, then spread it out thinner in a circular motion. Turned out to be a thin, delicious, very authentic tasting crepe.

This recipe was my first attempt at making crepes, and I'm delighted by how easy they were to make and how simple this recipe is.  I filled mine with slightly warmed banana slices and topped it with caramel sauce and chopped toasted pecans.  It was such a hit, that I've had requests from my family to make it again this week!

I really liked it, but I followed my own recipe the second time I tried this based on suggestions from other users and my own ideas. I added 1 cup of milk instead 1/2 milk and 1/2 water, I also added two tablespoons of sugar and vanilla extract because I wanted them to be sweet and 1 tsp of water. I also didn't like the egg texture so I reduced the recipe to one egg. They tasted sweet like a funnel cake and that's what I was going for!

These are a very good substitute when you just don't feel like making batter and letting it sit for 2 hours.  I divided the recipe and made 1/2 as much (for 2 people), and it worked out great.  I added a bit more milk and water, a tablespoon of sugar (to the dry ingredients), and a small amount of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients.  We filled these simply with only a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon.

First time making crepes and it worked out great!  I did have a hard time whisking out the lumps, so I put the batter into my cuisenart and it turned out smooth and creamy.  Good batter consistency for spreading it thin by manipulating the pan.  I highly recommend this recipe and am making these for my family's Christmas brunch.  For fillings, I set out a bar of spiced chunky applesauce, sliced bananas, whipped cream, maple syrup, and berry compote.  Delicious!

WOW !!  CREPES ARE MY FAVORITE AND I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL OF THE RECIPES ON THIS SITE. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT WORKS !!  I LOVE IT, IT IS THE EASIEST AND THE BEST ONE SO FAR. MY KIDS DON'T LIKE CREPES, BUT I ALWAYS MAKE THEM TRY EVERYTHING I MAKE AND I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THEY TOLD ME HOW GOOD IT WAS. THE ONLY THING I DID DO DIFFERENTLY IS ADD ABOUT A 1/3 CUP OF SUGAR, AND ABOUT 1 TSP. OF VANILLA. AS SOMEONE REQUESTED ON AN EARLIER REVIEW. IT REALLY IS THE BEST.

THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE !!!  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT...........

Followed other reviewer's reccomendations of mixing the wet ingredients first and then added the dry in with a sieve. These came out perfect and had many, many compliments. This will always be in my rotation from now on.

This was my first time making crepes, and it was great!! I did take some advise of others! I added 1 tbl. water, a tsp. vanilla, a tbl. sugar and only used 1 egg. I also did all the wet ingrediance first, beat the egg alone and then added the flour gradually to the rest of it. It wasnt clumpy at all,and they came out great!!! AWESOME recipe if you just do it right!!

Just as I remember as a kid....this is my first time attempting "roll-up pancakes" for my child...and it was exactly what I was looking for.  Made 6 dinner plate sized crepes...sprinkled the inside of some with sugar and others got a layer of jelly.  I did add 4 Tbsps of sugar to the batter as others recommended.  Will definitely make again....maybe more often than I should!

These crepes were pretty tasty. I ate them with the filling from the "strawberry and banana crepes" recipe on this site, and strawberries on top, and it was really sweet and tasty. I did add more water to get the right consistency to make thin crepes - my first few before I added water came out a bit thick. Good recipe!

This was a really great crepe recipe.  I made some for dessert last night. I put bananas & caramel sauce in some, then bananas and nutella in others.  The only thing that could have made things better, would have been some homemade whipped cream!

The crepes tasted very good but my batter came out lumpy following the instructions as are. I have never made crepes before and mine didn't look anything like the picture. Mine looked more like tortillas. I don't know if it was the pan, the batter, or the cook. I will make it again. I filled mine w/ the lemon snow filling and topped with blackberry pie filling. They tasted awesome, but I just couldn't get the crepes to look like the picture. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to make. If you're using a non-stick frying pan, you can omit the butter altogether. This leaves the taste entirely dependant on what you fill and top your crepes with.

A first timer, I followed the recipe exactly and my husband said they were even better than his mom's! Ya-hoo! Be careful not to have the heat too high, as the first one seemed to burn before it turned brown.

I put the wet ingredients in my blender then added the dry on top and blended till smooth. I just poured them right from the blender into pan and cooked. I spread plan Nutella on some and Nutella and sliced bananas on some and the rest I put peach preserves on. These came out great. I  have always seen Nutella in the grocery stores and never knew what to do with it. When we went to Italy this summer I realized Nutella is a staple in everyone's house over there. They sell it in LARGE jars like you could get at a Sams club. It is very rich so I spread it very thin on hot crepes.

I always use this recipe for crepes and the only thing I find I need to change is to add more liquid to thin the batter (I use real sea salt and real organic butter which really do give this a great flavor).  Also, I double the recipe adding the wet ingredients first to my blender, then adding the dry.  Used the Pumkin spice ricotta creme recipe (with sugar) as a filling for breakfast crepes for the kids.  Always a hit.  I guess I love it because it is so easy to make.

Instead of just making them for breakfast or dessert,try some for dinner. Saute'any meat and veggie then simmer in a little broth. When tender just roll the mix in the crepes. Bake for thirty minutes. While there baking make a cream sauce, any type and pour over the crepes just befor you serve them. The skies the limit when it comes to crepes. ENJOY!

I made this last night for in-laws over for dinner and they LOVED it! It was a smash hit. I used everything in th recipe except the salt. I added a little brown sugar and vanilla which made it all the better. I got those flour balls but I used my hands to squash them out before putting them on the griddle. Started in the center and used circular motions to pour the batter out until.. this helped keep them thin and helps with make a more rounded crepe.  I cut up bananas and strawberries, put them on the platter along side whip cream, confections sugar and melted chocolate. They all made their own crepe and it was quite delightful, very hands on and I received RAVE reviews!!! It was too good to stop and take a picture, but next time I will

Made this for our house warming. I topped it off with some vanilla icecream, fresh cut strawberries, whipped cream, made a "zig zag" pattern with chocolate syrup and the guests were WOW'D! They gave the taste + look an A+. If you're looking to impress, this is so simple and easy, it's a MUST DO!

Simply fantastic!  This is such a versatile recipe ... you can fill it with anything.  My husband chose the savory route and added scrambled eggs.  I opted to go with orange marmalade!  The options are endless.  One thing I have read  is to allow the batter to sit in the refrigerator for an hour or so.  I tried this and the batter was a perfect consistency for making the crepes. I also used 1 cup of lowfat milk instead of 0.5 c milk and 0.5 c water.  It was still great.  Delicious!

VERY EASY!!! I blend mine in the blender and then let it "rest" in the fridge for an hour. This makes the lightest crepes ever. - If your crepe mix is a little stiff after an hour in the fridge add a little water until you like the consistancy

These are very good crepes, the butter in the batter makes the flovor very good plus you can use less butter in the pan, heres a TIP make batter and put it in thr fridge for one hour your crepes will not be "rubbery"  you can get away with adding half the butter too.

Wonderful and easy recipe.  The only modifications I made were to mix the water and milk in a measuring cup and alternate adding this with the flour.  If you add all the flour at the beginning it becomes an thick egg paste and it becomes clogged in the mixer blades.  I make this at least one or twice a week by rolling up the crepes and serving them with maple syrup.

so simple and tastes great (with strawberries and nutella). TIP: You can make a large batch of crepes, place wax paper in between, use a ziploc bag and freeze.  You'll be able to use as many as you need and still keep the rest.  Just warm them up in the oven.

Nonstick pans are a must for this one..  I tried the following fillings: chocolate flakes, bananas and chocolate, honey, strawberry preserves.  

Chocolate and banana is by far the best.

Very good! Not Paris quality, but then again, I don't live in Paris ;) I would recommend closer to a 1/2 cup of batter for each pancake and it is much easier to spread the batter by using the end of the spatula.

I have been using this recipe for about a year now for my Sunday Crepe Breakfasts with my friends.  I make a big stack and provide whipped cream, sugar, lemons and rasberry topping, and everyone invited brings their favorite fruit.  It's always a hit!

If I had any idea that all a crepe was was a pancake then I woudl had done this ages ago! The only differece is you really spreading the batter out once in the pan cooking, but other then that everything is done the same prep and cooking wise. This took all of mabye 7 min total to make 2 large crepes. To make the batter more savory I added garlic, basil, romano cheese, salt and pepper to it.

This is the perfect crepe.  I add a touch of vanilla and use a 12-inch teflon-coated pan with very little oil brushed on.  This recipe yields four 12-inch PERFECT crepes.

This crepe recipe is simple and a delight to make.  It tastes great on its own, but definitely needs to be served with a chunky topping -- these aren't just thin pancakes!  Try mixing in 1/2 teaspoon basil into the batter for every four servings made to make a Mediterranean crepe base, or fry with a spicy oil to make a hot tortilla wrap.  Jen's recipe has been utterly foolproof for me.

These were very easy to make... I've never made crepes before, and my fiance loved them. I was very pleased at how they turned out... I wouldn't add anything else as others have done, they're just light and buttry enough without being too sweet. i rolled them around blackberries and blueberries, and it was fabulous.

This was a good recipe overall. The only problem I had was the batter was a little lumpy, next time I will mix the wet ingredients and then add the dry. Thanks Jen :)

Very good crepe recipe. Having been to Europe and falling in love with these babies. I've desperately have been trying to find a good recipe. And these mark pretty high. One thing to mention is that they kinda turn out lumpy. Not sure if that's the recipe or my lack of skills as a chef. Either way these taste great and are easy to make.

This has been my go-to recipe for months.  Only variation for me is that I like to add some kind of extract for more flavor.  I've done vanilla, almond, and lemon so far.  Just a teaspoon or so and it really amps it up!  I've also added citrus zest, but it really depends on your filling and topping choice.

I'd also recommend a tiny pat of butter before pouring your batter.  I also use a small ladle to ensure the precise amount of batter per crepe.  Finally, I use a tortilla warmer to keep them hot until they're all done and ready.

Easy as can be.  I can't even make decent pancakes, but I dazzle people with what they think is  a really challenging gourmet breakfast.  (Ssssshhh, let's just make this our little secret...;))

First, I changed to servings to 2 for my parents Anniversary. I added 1/2 a TBS of cinnamon, about 1-2 TBS of honey, 1-2 TSP of pure maple syrup, and a TBS or 2 of vanilla extract (+ may need a little more flower) and whisked it together.

Servers 2 (=^.^=)

The ingredients work together well, and it makes a great crepe, BUT all I ended up with is LUMPS.
The directions are RIDICULOUS! Just dump everything into your high-powered blender and hit the BATTER setting!

Easy and perfect.  I used 1/3c in my 8" pan.  Not lumpy like some reviews said.  Just followed the directions.  Now to experiment with fillings and tweaking this for flavor.

This is my go to for weekend breakfast.  I melt the butter in the non stick pan that I am going to use.  I mix all the wet ingredients together, then slowly whisk in the flour, then whisk in the melted butter.  I use measuring cup (1/3 or 80ml) to scoop the batter into the pan.  The first crepe will come out super buttery (and delicious!) All the rest come out fine.  You know it is time to flip when you shake the pan and the crepe moves freely.

I let the batter sit over night, so it was ready to go in the morning. I also replaced the butter with olive oil. It was so good. My boyfriend loves it! He asked to make more.

Easy peasy!! A lil vanilla ups the ante. One thing tho is we did have to double this and we only had 2 1/2 people, but the first crape rarely comes out n our pan might be larger than most... 1/3 a cup per crape seemed perfect! 

Thanks for sharing,
PK

Definitely would have been easier to mix all wet ingredients together first, then slowly mix in dry ingredients. Besides that, taste is good. A bit eggy, but good for a basic recipe.

Very good. However,I mixed wet first then slowly added dry, following the directions of the recipe will make lumpy batter.

This was a great recipe. Very easy to make.  Made them with nutella, bananas and walnuts.  Topped it off with whip cream, chocolate drizzle and powdered sugar. Everyone loved them.

Mix wet then add dry otherwise it is too lumpy. I think these were too think to be crepes. Used less flour and I added vanilla. Yes I tried the recipe as written first. Then tried with my changes. Way better.

Great recipe. DO NOT mix the eggs with the flour first. Mix the all the wet ingredients together, then add the flour slowly, whisking continuously until all ingredients are thoroughly combined and there are no lumps.

I used Himalayan salt and coconut oil instead of butter,  they came out beautifully although I didn't care for the salty taste, I lean more towards sweet for breakfast. I added some sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. I'm probably going to keep experimenting, good basic recipe!

Easy and delicious! The batter was a bit too thick for our liking so added a bit of water to make a thinner crepe. Like the others, mixed the wet ingredients together and then added the flour. Not sure why this recipe would have you add the eggs to the flour first when that is not the norm. Keep the pan hot or the crepes get a little rubbery.

I've been making this recipe for over 10 years and it has never let me down. The only adjustments I make is that I usually half the recipe and make 2 large crêpes and I add a bit more salt. I don't like a lot of sweets so I generally make this for a savory breakfast. I add scrambled eggs and hash browns with veggies (and occasionally bacon) then I top it with Hollandaise sauce and parsley.

Really good and simple! After cooking a couple that came out a little dry, I reduced the cooking time to 1 1/2 minutes on the first side.  We liked the more most crepes better!

The thing with crepes is that you can't turn on the heat and then put the batter in. You have to let the pan get hot for a minute, so that it's like a burst of heat, and then pour the batter in. This will create the evenly cooked bottom so that your crepe will stay together.

This was my first time making crepes and I was amazed at how easy this was and at how nice they turned out.  I did take the advice of others and mixed the wet ingredients first then added the dry to it while whisking and had smooth batter. I'll be making these whenever I'm in the mood for crepes instead of paying the high price restaurants charge for them. Thanks for a great recipe, JennyC819.

This recipe is almost perfect. What's missing is the method: use a blender. You will find your crepes are lighter and more tender because the blender lets you quickly emulsify the batter with out toughening it. Use a nonstick pan, lightly buttered for each crepe. And most importantly, be purposeful and decided about moving the pan in firm, deft circles. Do it immediately and don't dither. Cover with a light towel, not paper.

Great recipe! Only change I made was mixing all the wet ingredients first, and then slowly whisking in the flour. Made a super smooth batter that was easy to pour.
I used to make my crepe batter in the blender, but now I no longer have to!

It's wonderfully simple.  I squeeze a lot of lemon over the crepe while it is in the pan and then again when I put it on the dish.  I then sprinkle powdered sugar over it.

Love it!! Very versatile to adapt to sweet or savory filling.  I added about 1tbs sugar as I was planning on lightly sweetened strawberries.  Yum!  Perfect wrapper for lots of fillings.

Left out the melted butter out of the recipe, though I did put butter on the pan. Came out really nice!

Made sure to sift the flour in last. To make a little more sweet added 1/4 rounded cup of sugar and a little less than 1/2 tbs of vanilla extract. Turned out awesome. Yumyum

DO NOT follow the instructions and whisk the eggs and flour together first--otherwise the batter will turn out lumpy. Instead mix the wet ingredients together, the dry separately, then mix together slowly. The crepes did taste good, but the instructions were crummy.

First time I've made crepes from scratch.  They came out great !  Next time, I will use my mixer to get the batter smoother.  They came out fine though !  I made the chicken tarragon also here on allrecipes.com.  I'll use these again for sure !  My other half wants me to do something with burger on them next time.

For more flavor (and browner color), I skipped the water and used a full cup of whole milk. I love how adaptable this recipe is: Add 1 tablespoon chopped herbs to make them more savory, or add 2 teaspoons sugar and a splash of vanilla or brandy to make them sweeter.

I just put everything together except the butter,added 1 teaspoon vanilla,whisked it all at once,then added the butter last. Cooked it in non stick pan with nothing on it and they came out beautifully! So easy. Made a filling with sugar,corn starch,water brought to a boil to thicken then threw in some frozen mixed berries cooking until it was nice and thick. I will definitely make these again.

Super easy and versatile! You can make a batch of the batter in about 5 minutes and fill it with whatever you have in your kitchen. I've done savory crepes using leftover deli meat and cheese, or fill them with jam or nutella for something sweet. Really great and quick. I followed the advice of other reviews and mixed the wet ingredients before adding the flour. Turned out great.

I'm in complete agreement with everyone else . . . mixing the flour and eggs together -- bad idea.  I was able to salvage the recipe in spite of the huge, heavy doughy lumps that initially formed and did not want to break down in the milk/water additions, but eventually it all worked out.  I will mix the eggs into the water/milk next time and then add to the flour.  All in all, very tasty crepes . . . light with just the right sponginess.  I served them with strawberry compote, whipped cream and a sprinkle of powdered sugar and cinnamon.  They were delish!  This recipe, with one minor modification, is definitely a keeper.

I tryed this for the first time today,I put chocolate pudding and apples in the middle topped with butter sugar and cinnamon. Then I put egg and cheese in another crepe that was my fave,of course my kids loved the dessert ones.My first two didn't turn out so good but the rest was great.I did add sugar and vanilla in the batter mix,I followed the sweet version in my all recipes magazine.

honestly, this recipe was not the best. I followed it perfectly & as soon as I put the batter on to the crepe pan it slid off! I added a bit of water & milk because it was very thick and still didn't work.  I barely slid around at all. In the photo it is very thick and small, like a pancake .

Tasty business! The only change I made was using 1/3 cups of batter instead of 1/4 cups. I was using a large stainless steel pan, though, so I ended up with 6 nicely thin crepes, wide enough to allow for a little more filling (berries, jam, tuna, hummus, etc). BONUS: Got to impress my wife with my amazing crepe-flipping skills.

8/8 would eat.

So easy even a 13 year old could do it! I like to add a little bit of sugar to make it a bit more sweet. Great with chocolate spread.

Straight forward, easy, yummy! Can't get easier than this!
Mixed as per instructed sequence with handheld blender, beautiful smooth batter, no clumps! :)
I made mine with vanilla essence, pinch of sugar in batter to help crisping, spread thin on pan, brown/ crisp on one side. Sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon, crushed almond flakes/ powder, unsweetened hershey choc powder while it's cooking/ crisping, before folding/ rolling over and serving.
Customization options for flavours endless depending on what one has at home! Cheese, ham, fruits, nuts, ice cream, etc.. Best ad hoc unplanned snack/ dessert ever!

I've made these time and time again and they're wonderful. Never had any trouble with flipping the crepes like I do with some other recipes. If I know I'm going for sweet toppings, a bit of vanilla is a wonderful addition.

This is a VERY EASY and successful recipe!  My usual recipe requires the batter to "rest" for an hour in the fridge and I didn't have time for that.  This one is ready immediately and cooked evenly and beautifully in the crepe pan.  It is also the FIRST time I didn't have to throw out the first crepe or two because the first one cooked so beautifully!  This will absolutely be my first choice crepe recipe from now on!  (I used the EXACT ingredients, but mixed all wet ingredients and salt first, then gradually added the flour last)  In the future, I will add sugar to the batter since I always make crepes for dessert and sweet ingredients.

Fabulous! Make sure you beat batter so there are no lumps before frying. I kept mine warm in a tortilla warmer while cooking the rest.

Fantastic for 1st time crepe makers like myself. My husbands family tradition is to have these for breakfast! Cut the recipe in half and did a practice run since its our first year we won't be there early enough to make their timing! I too, put the dry ingredients in last, perfect! Sent t my hubby a pic and he's already whining he wants them, right now!!!

easy as pie ,really it was easy even for me a caveman , I also added almond extract to the first half batter, then vanilla extract on the 2nd ,plain on 3rd batch for the chicken/cranberry, walnut crepes covered in chicken gravy for the nurse at icu St. joseph hospital. I used cherry and apricot jam with the almond crepe ,and chocolate pie filling on the vanilla crepe.

I tried this recipe for the first time and the crêpes  came out great. I agree with Morley though that it was a much better idea to add the flour after mixing the wet ingredients. Overall a great and simple recipe.

Good starter recipe but I found that following the recipe exactly made for very dense and blah crepes. This problem was very easily remedied by adding  a splash more milk. They could've crisped up a little better if I'd added sugar and had a more exciting flavor profile if I'd added a little vanilla or cinnamon.

I made these crepes about 20 minutes ago, to see if I liked it. If I liked the recipe and if it was as good as all the reviews claimed I would use it for brunch on New Year's Day. I have had celiac's disease for many years and I substituted the all purpose flour for my wheat free gluten free flouR.  The crepes were absolutely delicious.  Dublin's Mom

I enjoy making crepes and this recipe was simple and easy to follow. There is something about this recipe that tasted better than others I've tried. I filled it with fresh fruit and whipped topping and had a wonderful breakfast.

Couldn't be more satisfied with this recipe.  The only thing is sometimes there can be little lumps of flour, but I find using a sifter works well at preventing this.

I made it and loved it. The only thing I would do is add more liquid, because the batter was a little thick, so the it didn't spread on the pan and one major thing in a crepe is to make it thin. But all in all I loved it. THANK YOU!

I love this recipe! I doubled it and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup granulated sugar. I followed Adam M.'s suggestion to mix all the dry ingredients, then whisk in the eggs, followed by the butter, milk, and water, in that order, just a little at a time. They turned out beautiful and delicious!

As a healthier alternative, I replaced the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and it turned out perfectly! Add some nutella, strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, and powdered sugar and you have yourself the most delicious dessert crepe imaginable. Add some brie, turkey, and fig butter (Which you can find at Trader Joes) if you want a healthier savory crepe.

Great Recipe! Used for dessert with my family and they were perfect. The only thing I would note is the batter is a tad lumpy so make sure to mix well. Easy and fast!

I just finished making these for my husband for a yummy Sunday morning breakfast that was easy and used ingredients we already had at home. They turned out delicious! We wanted sweet crepes, so I added sugar, vanilla extract and grated lemon and they were perfect!!! I definitely mixed all the wet ingredients together first and sifted in the dry ones instead of what the directions here state (mix the eggs into the flour). My brain automatically imagined a lumpy nightmare trying to do that! So I can't comment on those specific directions but I do know that my way worked and the batter was smooth and the crepes tasted heavenly!! I wish I had room to eat more! Excellent recipe, will make again definitely!

This is a bad recipe. My crepes came out lumpy and the consistency was too thick for 8 crepes, I only made 4 relatively small crepes. I should have known when the first step was to mix 2 eggs with 1 cup of flour.

Awesome!! Best Crepe ever!  Once you make these, you will NEVER go back to instant crepe mix. 
I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tbs of sugar.

These are amazing.  I did as suggested by others and just added the dry to the wet. I also added a touch of honey and vanilla.

I had mine with coconut oil and strawberries and wow!  Just divine!

Also had with lemon juice and granulated sugar like I used to have when I was a kid. mmmmmmmmmm.

I want to try these with asparagus and a bit of hollandaise sauce next.  yum.  So many possibilities.

Delicious! I followed Morleys advice and mixed all my wet, then sifted in the flour. They didnt need a whole 2 minutes to cook, and I finished a stack of them very quickly! I had enough for leftovers and will be making breakfast crepes with what I had left. Very delivious and simple recipe!!

This was incredibly easy.  As one reviewer mentioned the batter did become lumpy but I just added the liquid and whisked it to a smooth batter.  We added Nutella and bananas and dusted with icing sugar. The recipe made four crepes.

The batter was perfect consistency, but I wish I would have added a little sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

I tried it this morning and it was perfect! They don't taste sweet or salty so you can stuff them with either sweet or savory fillings. It's the easiest recipe I've seen and it is now saved as my go to recipe for crepes. I followed one of the reviewer's recommendation to mix wet ingredients first and then the flour and it worked! Thanks for the recipe!

The basic recipe is good, however, don't whisk the eggs with the flour.. you will have a mess.  I think it should have been to whisk the eggs, water and milk then gradually add the flour. And maybe a tsp more melted butter in the recipe, a few of mine stuck a bit and broke.

Made it & loved it. Four small changes: 

1 - Added flour to liquid mixture as suggested by Morley. Sifted the flour to avoid clumps.
2 - Found the batter a bit too thick so I added about 1/3 cup of milk & water (1/6 cup of each). 
3 - I sprinkled maybe 1/4 tsp sugar as per suggestion by Christine Anderson, because I too prefer them a bit sweet. 
4 - Added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. 

This is so much easier to make than I thought, will definitely make again.

This is pretty easy to make crepe but, I suggest to start at a little lower cooking temperature then  in the recipe and they should turn out great.

As a first time making crepes in my life ( I have eaten them just never made 'em) I was happy to say this recipe worked out very well as is! I really liked the taste and texture and will definitely use it again and again - they are just so darn easy to make!

I LOVE this recipe! I stuffed mine with roasted red pepper hummus, and some with chocolate/peanut butter spread and a little cool whip. Awesome! Watch the heat when you lay the batter down if you are using an electric griddle.

The batter was very thick and lumpy. I had to use an electric mixer and added some more milk in order for the mixture to be thin enough to make crepes.

I loved this recipe, it was quick and easy. However I made two changes: The order I mixed the ingredients and I added an ingredient. 
1)I mixed the milk and water together. 
2)Then poured it into a bowl with the cup of flour and whisked vigorously. 
This prevents clumping, then I added the other ingredients.

Second I added a teaspoon of vanilla just to make them smell and taste a little nicer.

Was easy to make and with ingredients you have on hand. I added a teaspoon of sugar to give it a slight sweet taste. I used a cream cheese (and powdered sugar) filling and nutella for these crepes.

My teenaged granddaughter pulled this recipe and proceeded to make it Christmas Eve.  She followed the instructions and the fun began.  It became to glob of goo.  She then tried the hand mixer and then the stand mixer.  The goo went right up the blades.  At that point, I saw what was happening and told her she had to add liquid and the goo immediately started behaving.  The "fluids first" process works much better for the less skilled and it produces wonderful crepes.  She enlisted the help of my teenage grandson.  Both are pretty good cooks for their age.  They had so much fun flipping the crepes.  We stacked them in the crockpot (for lack of anything else handy) with parchment between each, put them in the fridge and Christmas morning was quick and easy - no waiting for the crepes to be flipped!

It was okay; not as spongy or airy as the crepes I am used to. The texture was more like thin pancakes. But still tasted alright.

I love this recipe and have been using it for two or three years now.  I usually add vanilla and sugar, and top with fresh lemons and sugar or raspberry jam.  My husband likes them with maple syrup.

We substituted unsweetened vanilla-flavored almond milk in place of the regular milk (my wife is lactose intolerant) and Smart Balance instead of regular butter.

They came out great and nobody could taste the difference.  Would highly recommend this recipe to anybody that wants crepes in a hurry!

GREAT RECIPE :) Just made crepes for the first time following this.

Some tips:  Make sure to add the wet ingredients to your bowl before mixing in the flour.  Sifting the flour is not always necessary in this case if you whisk the ingredients 'till its smooth.  

Nonstick spray (like Pam) works very well.  Butter leaves a more buttery taste, while nonstick spray doesn't.  

If you're feeling adventurous you can flip the crepe by picking up the pan and tilting it forward-then back quickly... No spatula needed!!

1/2 cup of batter makes bigger crepes unless you thin it out with a little more milk/water, then 1/4 cup will spread out to a large pan.

If you're wanting a more sweet breakfast/dessert style crepe, add cinnamon & powdered or granulated sugar to taste.

I added 1 tbsp of sugar & 1 tsp of vanilla extract for sweet crepes. I also mixed the dry ingredients first, then added all the wet. They came out perfect!

I've never made crepes before, but this recipe was so easy to follow that I may have to add it to my weekly menus :) They were so easy to make - pretty much just like making a really big, really thin pancake. I added 2 TB of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter to make it a bit sweet. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. I served it with some vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce drizzled over top. Everyone loved it! Next, I will try a more savoury version for dinner :)

I LOVE this recipe; it was one of the first things I learned to make when i moved into my new apartment. For a desert crepe, I like to mix a bit of softened butter with confectioner's sugar and add finely, finely chopped cashews and walnuts to the mix. Let the crepes cool a bit & pour it in and roll them up.

Great basic crepes! I substituted a cholesterol free egg product for the eggs and they still turned out fabulous. Just like the real thing. I set up a crepe bar where the kids could choose their own toppings with savory and sweet options. Savory we went for mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and tomatoes. Sweet had options of: fresh blueberries, fresh strawberries in their own juice, and caramelized bananas (highly recommend!) along with powdered sugar and whipped topping. Will be doing this again when kids come for a visit and more adult versions (thinking rum with the caramelized bananas) when they're not around.

I had never made crepes before and it took a little practice to get them to come out right.  The trick I found was to use a VERY lightly oiled pan (as stated in the instructions!).  It also took a few tries to get the right amount of batter in the skillet.  It didn't take long and I was turning out beautiful crepes!  This a a great recipe and I ended up making a quadruple batch!

We loved this recipe! I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten it up a bit. I filled with a cream cheese filling and fruit. for filling use 1 8oz softened cream cheese, 1/3 sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 cup whipped topping, blend well to dissolve sugar, this also makes a great fruit dip all on it's own  - Great!!!

Well, this is a great recipe if you want crepes with pasta-like lumps in them. If not, change the method of the recipe and don't mix the eggs with the flour first!
As for the ingredients - that part was great, and when I made them a second time mixing the ingredients differently and it all blended nicely, then the recipe was perfect.

We liked this very much.  Thought the batter was too thick so added another 1/2 cup milk, tbls cinnamon, and teaspoon lemon zest.
Little difficulty getting them round, well, this is our first try and never got them round this time, but tasted great! Put strawberry jam in them and wow..

Contrary to what the instructions say, DO NOT WHISK the flour and eggs together. Just let them sit in the bowl unmixed and then only, gradually add the milk while whisking. I just tried and it worked perfectly!

The recipe was easy enough and produced a fair crepe. To me, the best all around recipe for crepes comes from Betty Crocker Joy Of Cooking.
Just slighy different than this recipe but produces a much thinner crepe that is easier to roll up or fold and for some reason, cooks much quicker. I'm used to a batter that bubbles nicely, this recipe doesn't.

I had been trying to make crepes for a year, but they always turned out a disaster, and I had sadly given up hope. But since I had run out of ideas of what to cook for dinner I thought I'd look up a recipe on-line and give it one more shot. I couldn't believe how easy it turned out to be with this recipe! I had bought a crepe pan for $7 and I was surprised to find out I didn't need to put oil or butter in the pan to flip them over. The secret is the butter in the batter. It melts and keeps the crepes from sticking to the bottom of the pan and it also makes them very easy to flip. We had them with the apple cinnamon mix one user recommended, with oranges and powdered sugar, and with my own filling, mushroom and feta cheese. You can also slice the remaining rolled up crepes in very thin strips and put them in chicken or vegetable broth for what the Germans call flaedle soup. Yum. Thank you very much from an enthusiastic and very satisfied crepe lover.

Easy and loved it! I ended up doing like many other did and mixing liquids first then slowly adding to the flour. Also, I didn't have milk one day, but really wanted these so I used coconut milk in place and continued that flavor by cooking it in coconut oil instead of butter. Oh man! So good. Also, I used whole wheat flour and it was delish.

I thought the crepe had too much flour.  It made them on the thick side where they should be on the thin side.  I would put only 1/2 cup of flour.

I made these tonight, cutting the recipe in half.  I mixed the ingredients in the order listed, and yes, the flour and egg mixture ended up inside the whisk.  But after I scraped it out and added the liquids, it blended very well.  They cooked easily and were delicious filled with the apples and cinnamon that I prepared before cooking the crepes.  I was afraid crepes would be difficult but they were very easy.  Thanks.

Great and simple recipes. Mixed all wet ingredients then added flour and salt and then melted butter. Easy to work with and served them with sautéed apples from the same site. Yummy little whip topping on top.

This is awesome, made a double batch and brought it camping, everybody was asking me for the recipe and were surprised how easy it could be. Try it with nutella, peanut butter, bananas, strawberrys  and topped with whipped cream and Aunt Jamima syrup.

These turn out perfect everytime and are a hit with my teenagers and their friends.  Great for any meal depending on the filling.  For breakfast crepes, I suggest a dash of cinnamon.

Made these as written, except I substituted freshly ground whole wheat flour (using white wheat) for the all purpose.  They are delicious, and I can hardly keep up making them...my family is eating them as fast as I can make them.  We had them with sausage and cheese, applesauce and cinnamon sugar, and blueberries and syrup.

I agree with some other commenters that these are definitely NOT crepes in the traditional sense. Crepes should be thinner, more tender and have a bit of a chewy texture. These are more like thin, dry pancakes. Which was surprising given this recipe is very similar to Alton Brown's. To alter it I added a bit more milk, maybe 1/4 cup or so, and cooked each side for no longer than a minute. The batter will look very watery with the extra milk but it cooks fine so long as the pan is hot enough where water beads up and you use enough oil. While not 100% authentic these came out much closer to what a crepe should be.

Well, I tried this recipe ad it didn't turn out well :( Very lumpy, I could get rid of them. And way too greasy; I had to use paper towels to "dry" them. Next time I'll skip the 2tbs of butter, and mix wet ingredients first, with the dash of vanilla extract.

Mix the eggs & wet ingredients together, then sift in the flour and you will get ridiculously easy, "magically delicious" crepes. This was the first time I made them and, oh my goodness, they came out great. A 1/4 cup makes a small sized crepe. Tilt the pan right away since they start cooking immediately. I set my electric griddle at 325 degrees. Served these with Rhubarb Sauce II on this site. Outstanding.

My family and I loved the taste.  Other than sifting the flour and adding it to the wet ingredients afterward (as user "Morley" suggested), I didn't do anything different with its preparation.  The sifted flour was so fluffy that it mixed immediately into the wet ingredients without any problems.

I didn't use any oil on the frying pan (since it was a non-stick pan) and the ingredients contained an oily substance- the butter- anyway, so the crepes did not stick whatsoever.

These crepes were excellent! I put bananas and whipped cream inside, rolled it like a burrito and put more whipped cream on the top.

Wish I would have read the other reviews before I made this.  The recipe calls for you to mix the flour and eggs together first.  This left me with a very lumpy batter.  I tried to smooth it out with a hand mixer but it did not work.  I would have thrown it out and started over but I used organic eggs and was not about to just dump them.  As others have mentioned mix wet ingredients together then add dry.

This is a fabulous, easy recipe! My kids LOVE these crepes. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and mixed wet ingredients (added a teaspoon of vanilla) then dry ingredients. I will say (after many burned knuckles previously) that an investment in a crepe pan makes a HUGE difference! Enjoy!

Super easy crepes. Even my housemates (who have never made crepes before) were pros at making them when we finished thanks to this easy recipe. Also used the apple compote suggested by another user - delicious, especially with a little peanut butter too!

This recipe is simple and you can be creative with the way you use it. I've use it with fruit filling as a desert and have used it stuffed with meat, veggies and sauce.

Good basic recipe.  Need to adjust directions to mix ingredients correctly.  Follow these directions and you will be mixing for an hour as you try to remove all the lumps.  Should have used common sense.

Super easy to make, even for a novice like me. I used a cast iron skillet and they turned out perfect! I wanted to make blintzes, but I didn't have all ingredients on hand for the filling, so I mixed what I had left of the tub of whipped cream cheese, a little sugar, vanilla and a splash of milk (sorry, I didn't measure).. whisked that together  (right in the cream cheese container), made blintzes out of the mixture and the yummy crepes, and topped them off with frozen berries that I had heated in the microwave to make a sauce. Sooooo good.

At first  I thought strange to do flour and eggs first but it worked just fine for me. Pour liquid in slowly - I used a cup of coconut milk. Turned out better than another recipe I tried. My son thought these were awesome...with chocolate peanut butter. I had mine with powdered sugar and papaya. The thickness allowed for picking them up with the PB filling. Tried some with a squirt of Nestle Choc syrup in the batter before cooking - a little sweetness and my son says they are even better with PB! Had some for di her and freeze the left with wax paper I betwixt in a plastic baggie. Just heat and serve, no thawing required.

YUM! I just got done eating these...maybe a couple more than I should have, but they were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly because I have never made crepes before and didn't want to mess them up! I filled them three different ways: first, nutella; second, cream cheese and strawberry jam; third, cream cheese, brown sugar and cinnamon...and I couldn't decide which one was my favorite! Mmmm :)

This was our first time making crepes, and we had a blast! I will make again. I'd like to make some with herbs in the batter for the ones with meat. I may even try to make manicotti with them!

Super easy!  Agree with others that it's best to mix wet ingredients first, then add in the flour sifted.  I added the 1/3 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. powdered sugar and then we topped with lemon juice and powdered sugar after cooking.  YUM!!!

Great recipe.  Followed other suggestions to add powdered sugar (icing sugar) to make sweet and crispy.

This recipe is fantastic, and very robust!  I didn't have milk, so I used water and a dash of coffee creamer instead.  Also, I used margarine instead of butter.  The result was fantastic!  Adding some sugar makes the crepes even better.  Best of all, they were quick and easy.

Very good- def keeper. Only modification- doubled recipe plus added 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Browned a little, crispy, and only slightly sweet. Next time might try to add more butter in recipe vs put oil in pan as thought was slightly on the greasy side. But very yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  This was my first time EVER making crepes.  My boyfriend and son LOVED them.  I used all milk no water.  I read somewhere that letting the batter sit for about an hour gives better results.  THEY WERE GREAT!!

Simple and excellent recipe.  I made 1/2 the batch into breakfast with scrambled eggs, mushrooms and Asian marinated chicken. The other 1/2 into sweetened crepes with ~1/8 cup each of granulated and powdered sugar.  Made a mango filling by chopping up 2 into small bits and cooking it with about 1 T butter, 1 T sugar, and 1/4 t each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Served with powdered sugar on top.  Both were delicious.

great simple recipe. I also added the wet ingredients together first then the dry & combined. I added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar & it was perfect! We made some Nutella crepes and also did some savory crepes- cheddar cheese on the inside & pico de gallo on top! Delicious!

Very delicious! Mixed all my wet ingredients and then added flour. Also added 1/8 cup sugar since I was filling them with chocolate. They turned out great.

Two tips I learned in France: 
1. Let the batter sit for at least an hour.  This helps the flour to better absorb the butter, and makes everything much smoother.
2. Add a couple tablespoons of Calvados.  Completely optional, but makes the consistency and flavor really nice.

Great recipe-simple and always a crowd-pleaser!

Very good. Make sure your pan is hot enough. I made the mistake of a pan that was too cool. Also, I didn't have milk to I used sour cream and extra water as a substitute and it worked out. Well definitely use this recipe again.

These were good for savory crepes, but I wouldn't say amazing.  I did, however, make the mistake of trying to cool down the melted butter by adding the milk to it...what I was thinking, I have no idea, because it curdled the milk a tad (stupid!).  In the end, it all worked fine, but that definitely wasn't ideal.  We made savory cuban crepes...pulled pork, ham, pickles, cheddar, mustard and hot sauce.  So good!  We also tried to add some sugar and vanilla to the second half for some sweeter crepes, but next time I would just use a sweeter recipe (I've head the Vanilla Crepes recipe is awesome).

This was sooo good & sooooo easy!! I was a little worried making crepes would be very difficult, they look so delicate but they were super easy! This was my 1st time making them & they were awesome! I made them for my hubby & son's b-day/valentines breakfast! I added 1/4tsp of vanilla & 1/4tsp of sugar & it was excellent! I also added the wet ingredients 1st as another review had mentioned. Then I used thawed frozen strawberries & sprinkled chocolate chips inside. Served with syrup & whipped cream on top! Next time I'm going to use fresh strawberries & maybe even try cinnamon, nutmeg & apples yummy! Such an easy recipe but it looked soo elegant! A good breakfast to serve to company & impress :-)

This was a delicious and easy recipe! I put a really simple blueberry sauce(made from fresh blueberries and sugar just heated in a pan) in one with powdered sugar. Since I live near Cincinnati, OH, and goetta, a meat and grain mixture, is really popular, I put some goetta and jack cheese in another, so tasty. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again

Easy and delicious; exactly what I was looking for! I did add a bit more milk to make the batter more "crepe" and less "pancake".  I filled these with Nutella and topped them with a berry reduction. This was a perfect for a snow day; we didn't need to brave the snow for an amazing breakfast! I did add a bit more milk to make the batter more "crepe" and less "pancake".

So easy and soooo good! Made them for the first time from this recipe and they came out great! I was stationed in Germany for 4 years and these were a favorite in the market places. I spread Nutella in side them. They taste exactly like they did in Germany.

This was my first at making crepes and they were delicious and alot easier than I thought. I followed the recipe to the letter, and like others I thought about seperating the dry and wet ingredients, but I went ahead and it turned out great! To the ones whose turned out lumpy, try a whisk, NO lumps at all. My five year old granddaughter taught me that! She loves her whisk! Eva Bohannon

These are great as is. I always triple the recipe though for my family of 7. Usually I use half milk and half chocolate almond milk, or all milk for a richer taste. If using milk, I add a couple dollops of honey to sweeten. I also use all or half/half whole wheat flour and white flour. It tastes just as good with whole wheat. I keep a plate in a warm oven and stack them as I make them to keep them warm. Serve with fresh diced strawberries and toasted pecans and whipped cream. Not the most healthy breakfast, but on occasion, we look forward to this!

Great basic recipe!  I doubled the milk and water to 1cup each, and also mix the wet ingredients first then sift flour into mixture to avoid lumps.  Also add ~1 tsp vanilla essence for flavour.  They make perfect snacks with banana filling or marmalade.  Yum.

Followed directions exactly (against better judgement) and recipe came out lumpy.  Should not have whisked flour and eggs together.  Could not get smooth enough!

DELICIOUS! I added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and some sugar to make sweet crepes. My kids and husband devoured them! I was pleasantly surprised that the batter kept well in the fridge over night, and tasted just as great the second day! I will make these again and again!

I made it twice and it is delicious. But it has tiny lumps. I wish I had read the reviews first which said to add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Third time should be the charm!

I halved this recipe to try. Used vegetable oil to replace butter so it is healthier. Fried the first half of batter as original recipe. Original recipe is easy, quick and yummy.   Then I added 3 Tbsp cocoa powder and 2 Tbsp sugar to the 2nd half of batter (about the amount of cocoa+sugar I would add to the same amount of water (batter) when I make cocoa drink so I think u could adjust according to diff brands/sweeten/non-sweeten etc), fried it and become chocolate crepe! Personally I like the chocolate crepe better ( I like sweets :D). Guess kids will like it and good as dessert too :).

These are okay,  not the bubbly light crepes that I'm used to but they are definately thinner than regular pancakes.  I will keep searching for the right, light mixture.

Wow! These were UNBELIEVABLE!! I have never attempted crepes before as they intimidated me. I had no idea they were so easy. I followed the suggestion of a couple reviewers to add a bit of sugar as well as a splash of vanilla. I mixed the wet ingredients first, then added the dry and gave the mix a quick whirl with my electric whisk. A good non-stick pan is necessary. I didn't need to butter it beyond my first crepe. This is the perfect recipe to add versatility to the usual family brunch breakfast choice in our house, pancakes or waffles or eggs. I can't wait to make it again and experiment with fillings. Thank you SO much for sharing!

I love this recipie as it got me making crepes again, even without a crepe maker, I just use my large shallow non-stick skillet.  As I was making my Saturday morning mocha I got a inspiratation for a varient, that turned out well.  I made this with a half recipie, but I'll list the quanities generically. These have got a pretty chocolate color and subtle chocolate taste, but I may adjust the quanities later.   -Replace the water with coffee (cooled to Room Temp) - Replace about a forth of the flour with hot chocolate mix  - Add a little bit of vanilla extract  (maybe 1/4 tsp for a full recipie) Mix & cook as normal.  I enjoyed them plain but I could see these becoming dessert soon.

Strongly recommend that you thin your batter unless you like a heavy crepe for breakfast; or, if you decide on a dessert crepe, fold with sour cream inside, spoon on fruit, or syrup, etc.  For dinner, use the un-thinned original recipe: because they are not sweet you can bulk up most meals with these crepes, even when you have curry, stew, or soup.

I love this recipe! I whisk all the wet ingredients first then slowly whisk them into the dry ingredients. I usually double the recipe as they disappear fast. I like to make them ahead of time and keep them warm inside a folded dish towel. I have even made them the morning before a dinner party. I wrap them in the towel then clingwrap over the top. Put them in the fridge until ready to serve. A minute or 2 in the microwave and they're ready to go. I serve them with starwberries, nutella & whipped cream, or my son's favorite.. a sprinkling of sugar & cinnamon. YUM!

Do NOT use an electric mixer. The batter is like water and I splashed all over the counter.  Great taste. I made them as an afternoon snack. My family ate them as fast as they came off the stove.

I agree with everyone, whisking the eggs and flour was difficult by hand. My first batch was unusable. Then I decided to use the whisk on my mixer, and that worked much better! These are incredible!

Great basic recipe. They taste good plain but even better when you make them to your taste. With this recipe it gives you the option to make it the way you like it. I had fresh raspberries so I made a cream cheese filling and spread it on one side of the crepe then sprinkled with raspberries and rolled the crepe up. I then garnished with powdered sugar. They looked and tasted GREAT!!

I make this all the time, it's quick and easy.  I add a touch of vanilla as we always make sweet crepes.  I also found no difference in the final product if I didn't  mix the eggs and flour together first or mixed the flour with all the wet ingredients.  Mixing the flour with the eggs made it difficult to get all the lumps out.  Fabulous quick and easy recipe.

This recipe is one that would work in a pan if you had to pour it in.   If you have a electric crepe maker (one that you dip into batter and then turn over) it is too thick.  I added 1/3 c milk to the recipe and it was perfect.

Perfect recipe.  Made nice, smooth crepes.  If you want them a little rougher looking use about a tsp of oil each time.  I usually turn by hand after hitting the side of the stainless steel pan.

I always thought that crepes were one of those things that you could never make at home as good as restaurants, but boy was I wrong... and these are actually better! I picked this recipe because I liked that you didn't have to sift anything and the batter didn't have to sit at all. If you're having a little bit of trouble with the eggs and flour like I did, just start adding the milk and it will mix up just fine. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar to the batter to make these a little sweeter. I use 1/2 cup to put it in the pan vs. the 1/4 cup it calls for, and I made sure use a little butter in the pan before every crepe. As soon as I flip the crepe, I put the filling on so it can heat up a little (we use cottage cheese and fruit)... you just gotta be careful not to spill it when taking the crepe out of the pan.  Top with a little powdered sugar, whip cream (canned), and strawberry syrup, and you have an amazingly good breakfast!

This is a great crepe recipe. I do not add the salt or the melted butter, but I do add some vanilla extract-about a teaspoon or to taste.

Great crepe batter for dinner / savory crepes.  Made chicken and spinach crepes with this recipe, with no changes except to let the batter rest 1 hour before cooking (gets a better consistency and smoothness of flavor).  I do not recommend it for dessert crepes because it is too thick.  Use "dessert crepes" by ANN57 which are the perfect runny consistency for dessert crepes.

This was okay, but definitely not my favorite. Didn't like the flavor at all. I could have added this or subtracted that....but then why not just find a whole new recipe?

I've always had trouble with these; they come out good, but never perfect. For sweet crepes, use 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.

This was my first time making crepes. I was extremely intimidated at first, thinking it would be complicated. That couldn't have been farther from the truth! The only thing I did different was add a bit of vanilla. These were so fast and easy to make. Afterwards, I spread Nutella on them and rolled each one up. We ate them at room temperature after dinner with a scoop of ice cream. Heavenly!

I made these today, and they were so easy.  I've always been afraid to make crepes because I thought they were hard to make, but these were simple.  I did change it slightly in adding the wet ingredients first, then the flour, but the taste and consistency was perfect.  I made bananas foster with this, since I didn't have ice cream, and they were thin enough to make a perfect dessert.  I will definitely make again and again!

I wouldn't change a thing!  Made beautiful and delicious crepes!  We filled ours with spinach, onion, mushrooms, bacon, and a light smear of cream cheese.  Yum!  For dessert: cinnamon apples and sweetened ricotta.

These crepes are wonderful! I took the advice of others and mixed the liquid ingredients together and then sifted in the flour slowly. They turned out perfectly and tasted delicious. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

My son had to make crepes for his french class and since my husband has heart problems we decided to make it heart healthy with 1% milk, Becel margarine and egg beaters made with egg whites instead of eggs.  They were easy to make and we filled them with fruit and dream whip made whip made with 1% milk.

This recipe turned out so good! I mixed all the wet ingredients together and then wisked the dry in. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla like others suggested. My favorite way to eat them is with butter, sugar and fresh sqeezed lemon, reminded me of my first crepe and day in Paris.

These were great and easy to make.  Next time, I think I'll try mixing the wet ingredients first so it's less lumpy.

AMAZING CREPES!!! I've tried many recipes before but all of them turned out really rubbery... Though this recipe alone is a little bland so try adding about 1 1/2 teaspoon powdered sugar for an extra zing of sweet. =] My (delicious) suggested serving: Bananas, nutella, strawberries (optional) on the inside and whipped cream, a sprinkle of powdered sugar, and chocolate ice cream (optional) on the outside. =] I definetely recommend this recipe. It is to DIE for. :D

And I thought making crepes was going to be difficult...this was so easy, and extremely versatile. I filled mine with Nutella and chestnut cream, and my boyfriend had his with crumbled bacon, scrambled eggs and cheese. I plan on serving these to friends soon :)

Just made it this morning. I put Nutella and sliced bananas as the filling. It was so yummy. I followed all the ingredients as is, and only changed the order that the ingredients were combined to avoid the flour from clumping as another review suggested. I also sifted the flour.

Delicious! I just went and made some of these! Although, i added some vanilla and powdered sugar. But overall it was amazing! I spreaded some Nutella on plus frozen blueberries. I served some to my sister too. This recipe was extremely easy to make as well!

i add 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 2 tbs white sugar for my husband and kids (i could go without) but they love it.  even with just some cool whip.  oh i also sub half the all purpose flour for whole wheat.  love this crepe recipe because i don't need to seperate eggs and i ALWAYS have these ingredients on hand.  We use this weekly. Thanks!!

This is a solid simple recipe for crepes. I'm a highschool student, so I eat these for breakfast and then take them cold for lunch. They're quick, and the ingredients are always available. Try hot creamcheese and raspberries for a filling!

This was a super easy recipe to follow, though I tweaked it a little.  I mixed the wet ingredients first then added the dry ones in.  I also added some sugar and vanilla into the batter to make it a little sweeter.  Overall, it's a great starter recipe that you can change up as needed!

These are the absolute most amazing crepes i have ever tried in my whole life. i LOVE them. they are fast and easy and taste delicious. highly recommended. (by the way, many people said that it makes no sense to mix eggs and flour in the beginning, honestly, it doesn't make a difference. you just have to sort of mix them together. dont have to mix it with anything fancy or electric either. )   :D amazing :)

There's really not that much diversity among crepe recipes, and I really just tried this one out of convenience - first hit on Google.  But it ended up being the best crepe recipe I've ever had.  I followed the suggestions in the reviews to mix the wet ingredients before adding the flour, and I also added a spoonful of sugar, and they turned out delicious.  I'll definitely be coming back to this recipe.

Great crepe recipe.  I ran out of milk and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead.  Still worked great.  I also added a touch of vanilla extract as I was making this into a non-savory breakfast item.    I like this recipe due to the lack of sugar...good for sweet or savory filling/topping.  I used sliced fresh nectarine and mango simmered with butter, a tablespoon of sugar, ground ginger, and some triple sec and it was goooood!

I made them GLUTEN-FREE! and they were fabulous!  This was my first attempt at crepes and I had NO trouble at all!  For the all-purpose flour I used ONE CUP of a gluten-free all-purpose mixture (2 cups white rice flour, 2/3 cup potato starch - NOT potato flour, 1/3 cup tapioca, 3/4 tsp. xanthan gum).  It made 10 8" crepes that my picky children and my husband gobbled up!  Thanks!

Excellent.  I made these more savory with the addition of chopped tarragon, parsley, and thyme. Also just dumped all the ingredients in a blender and gave it a whirl for 10 seconds.  Ladled into an 8" non-stick pan brushed with a bit of butter befoure each pour.  It made about 12 crepes.

I've never made crepes before so I was looking for something easy that wouldn't require me to stop at the store on my way  home. This recipe was SOOOOO easy. My son has asked for them for breakfast every morning since that first day I tried them.  I'll be making these for a long time!

This is a fabulous crepe recipe.  Good for savory and dessert crepes alike.  Recently I've had to avoid dairy and modified this recipe using margarine and vanilla soy milk.  It still tasted fabulous!

I have ALWAYS wanted to try to make crepes, but they honestly sound really intimidating! However, after trying your recipe today, I realized how easy they are to make. One tip I have is to combine your ingredients in a blender. It's fast and easy, plus it prevents any lumps in your batter. I filled mine with sliced bananas, honey, and a touch of cinnamon. Wonderful recipe! Will use again! :)

Crepes are very good for a weekend breakfast. All my friends who have tried them, like them (even the most closedminded ones.)  They are fantastic with a dab of lingonberry preserves (can be bought at IKEA) or lemon sugar.  Quick and easy to make.

Added some vanilla for more taste. However, crepes were a bit tough.  Will try again by using more milk to see if they will thin down and have the crepe like texture.

This was quite simple and delicious.  I used egg beaters and skim milk, and added 2 tbsp extra water, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp cocoa powder.  These were wonderful served with peanut butter and drizzled with chocolate syrup.  I will definitely make these again!

After three different failed recipes, this one was PERFECT!  We used our Villaware crepemaker, which made the whole process super easy.  The consistancy and flavor of the batter was just right.  I did mix the eggs with the wet ingredients before adding the dry.  Mixed together strawberry cream cheese and cottage cheese for filling.  Yummy.  My husband is in breakfast heaven.

This was quick and easy. I followed the directions exactly and it came out just fine. I used strawbery and grape jam as the fillings. The only thing I will do next time is add vanilla as another reviewer mentioned.

Added 1 tbsp of white sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extractand a 1/4 tsp of tea and milk masala (mix of aniseed, cinnamon, cardamon, black pepper, dry ginger, cardamom green and cloves).  Will add more of the masala next time. Realized that I didn't need to add butter to my non-stick pan b/w each batch...they contain butter in them already so you can skip this step (and the calories too).

Super easy, super yummy! I wake up with a mad craving for crepes every other month or so and these are so quick to satisfy. For variations I will add a lot of vanilla and cinnamon or I'll add amaretto and top with raspberries and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Definitely a good recipe. I am not a fan of cooking with butter, so I substituted unsweetened apple sauce in instead and they still came out just perfect. I added a tsp of triple sec as well to give it a tad orange flavor.  This recipe is great with fresh lemon juice and icing sugar, or sliced bananas and maple syrup.

Great recipe, but MAKE SURE you whisk ALL wet ingredients together before putting the flour in.  Otherwise you will end up with some pretty lumpy crepes.  Also, if you find your batter is as thick as pancake batter, add in some more water and/or milk.

Very good but the batter needs to be thinner. Add more milk to thin it out and then its perfect! I served with bananas, whipped cream, and drizzed chocolate syrup.

These were very good tasting.  I have to agree with some other reviewers though that mixing the flour and eggs first makes very lumpy batter.  I had to whip the heck out of it to get it smooth, but after that it was fine.

I used the suggestion by others to add the liquids together first and then added the flour.  It turned out great!  My boyfriend loved it and wants me to make it more often!

Great crepe recipe.  Mom use to make but never had a exact recipe.  I mix everything together with a hand stick blender.  I just add a little vanilla for a little flavor. Taste just like mom use to make.  I put grape jelly on the crepes and there are ready to eat.

We have a couple of people in our family that cannot have wheat gluten, and this recipe converted easily and deliciously!  I substitute a gluten-free flour mix (in my case Bette Hagman's Featherlight) plus 1/4 tsp xantham gum. I think that any gluten-free mix would work.  Additionally, the gluten-free crepes hold up well, which isn't always the case with GF. I now make up a huge batch and store them in the fridge to use for lunches and breakfasts during the week, PBJ, Nutella, Ham & Cheese, Burritos -- so easy and so satisfying!

These are the best crepes that I have had since I went to France. I added 3 tablespoons of sugar and 1/2 a tsp of vanilla. Then when they were cooked on the first side I flipped it and spread Nutella on them. They were great with my variation and as the recipe is.

Fantastic! Quick & easy.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  Also mixed wet ingredients first, then the flour.  Spread some nutella, bananas, & almonds on the inside & rolled it up.  It was great!  I payed almost $6 bucks for this exact same thing in a restaurant once...well no more!

Y'all are right. This recipe is awesome. I've been making crepes for my children for years and this is by far the easiest and best recipe I've ever tried.  I added about 1/4 of powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and it turned out fantstic. I definitely will try the orange zest and/or grand marinier next time.

This is a very simple and easy recipe to have for breakfast or dessert.  I followed the recipe closely and just added a dash of vanilla and orange rind to make it a little bit more Frenchy.  I served it with various fruit toppings, nutella, powdered sugar, and some home made whip cream.  It came out very delicious.  My husband, children, and in-laws enjoyed it so well we had to cook another batch.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe to all of us.

Excellent and simple. I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Beat the eggs and milk well before adding into the dry ingredients. Don't overmix! Mix just enough to destroy clumps or you'll get tough crepes. However, it's really hard to screw up this recipe unless you let the crepes totally burn. These crepes with berries and chocolate syrup are great to surprise someone you love in the morning.

I agree with one of the previous posters, when they said that sifting in the flour works better.  If you don't the batter tends to be very lumpy, because it's difficult to whisk in the eggs.  

You should try making them and when you flip them to cook the other side, add a deli slice or two each of Swiss Cheese and Black Forest Ham.  Fold into halves or quarters, and enjoy!

Great recipe...have used it many times, adding a bit of vanilla and sugar. I like to use a non-aerosol oil sprayer to lightly mist the pan between crepes...they slide ride out and are perfect every time!

Great consistency and simple recipe.  Perfect for savory fillings.  For sweeter fillings I'd add sugar to the batter.  I use a blender or hand mixer to get rid of the lumps.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! I used whole wheat pastry flour and soy milk, instead of white flour and milk, and added a dash of maple syrup to the batter to tenderize it a little. They still came out delicious. 

The batter was really lumpy even after whisking it a lot, but the cooked crepes were tender throughout.

I found these very easy to make - especially since I've only made crepes once or twice before. My son is allergic to eggs so I only used the egg yolks - they still turned out delicious.

I decided to use this recipe to make a delicious dinner for some houseguests, and boy did they enjoy it. First I prepared a box of good ol Kraft mac & cheese and a 24-oz ribeye from Wal-Mart (you know they sell those there now, just marvelous) and fried it up with some lawrys and some of my special seasonings. Then I just chopped up the steak to tiny bits and mixed it up with the mac. Then I made up the crepes just like the recipe says accept I had to add some more milk because they were pretty thick. And once I'd done that made some delicious mac and cheese and steak crepes! Really one of a kind and really wowed my dinner guests all to town. They are sure to tell there friends just like I'm telling you folks. 5 stars!

My teenage son made this for Mother's Day. It didn't come out as thin as I expected but that might be him trying to make huge crepes. He put apple pie filling and whipped cream. Yummy. Updated - I make it with the same recipe and it came out really thin. Instrauctions were different than what I was used to but it came out great.

It was a really nice recipe! I made it for mom on mothers day, she adored them. One thing that should be mentioned that they cook best on a non preheated pan with extremely light layer of oil.

Way better than my favorite restaurant's crepes.  Stuffed them with whipped cream, strawberries and bananas and others with "cajeta quemada," Mexican caramel or what some people know as dulce de leche, delicious and definately a keeper!! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I can't believe that I actually made these crepes!  I always order them in restaurants because I thought I could never make them right...but this recipe is a sure thing! Turned out so yummy, although I did follow the directions exactly and after reading reviews, I will mix wet ingredients first then the dry because my batter was a bit lumpy.  My husband loved them too and I will be serving them to guests.  Yummy!

These were great! I tripled the recipe and made them smaller for a brunch party. I made the regular recipe for spinach/mushroom/feta crepes (based on the spinach bacon mushroom crepes from this site). Half way through I added some sugar and cinnamon and made banana crepes with a brown sugar rum sauce. Everyone loved them, especially the spinach ones!

This was my first time making crepes and they turned out great. I added to the mix 1tbl of vanilla extract and 1tbl of sugar. I also served them with raspberry jam. My husband couldn't get enough.

very easy and tasty! I had a little trouble with lumps, but I got most of them worked out (they didn't effect the taste!) I also used a small amount of butter to the pan before each crepe. YUM YUM. We stuffed ours with vanilla yogurt and fresh strawberries and bananas and enjoyed a decadent breakfast.

Excellent taste! Adding some vanilla concentrate (about 1 teaspoon) makes it so good! It's worth trying these crepes with Greek or Swiss black cherry or sour cherry preserves that can be found in smaller grocery stores.

This is a very easy and yummy recipe.  While it doesn't have quite the thin transparency of a real crepe, it works in a pinch when you are craving crepes but don't have the hours to wait for the batter.  We loved them with fried cinnamon apples and whipped cream!  Also, strawberries and cream.  Of course any crepes are better with Nutella too!

Very nice crepes, although the batter came out a little bit too thick for me, I just added a little bit more milk and water. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla essence and 3 tbs of white sugar to make it sweeter. For the filling, I sauteed some sliced strawberries and bananas with some brown sugar and a little bit of milk (or you can use cream). Serve it with maple syrup and ice cream with coffee for a weekend breakfast... hmm... Thanks for sharing this recipe! Simple, easy, and delicious =)

It is super Basic and a little bland I thought. I think it really takes a few times to master these, especialy the turning part.  Im also the kind of guy that really likes things warm so I think maybe heat the canned fruit compote a little would have really helped.  And Ive often thought a little vanila might go along way.

UNBELIEVABLE. I added sugar and powdered sugar just like someone suggested, and they were so phenomenally delicious, I ate them by themselves with my eggs and bacon and coffee. No more store-bought pancake mix. This is heaven.

easy to make. great for breakfast. i personally would add sugar to the batter as it tasted a bit bland to me. great with sauteed apple also from this site!
avoid pouring too much batter onto the pan otherwise it is difficult to achieve an even texture.
makes a nice breakfast.

Delicious, not intimidating!  
I, like others, found it works best to mix the egg with the wet ingredients rather than alone with the flour.  When I mixed them alone with the flour the batter and the finished product were lumpy.  
I found the most success - soft, foldable crepes - when I put a little butter in the pan before each one, or sometimes every third one.  This is using Rachael Ray non-stick cookware which it will not stick to w/o butter, but w/o the butter they were sometimes hard and brittle.

I never made crepes befor nor have I had one to eat. My husbands' french grandmother use to make them for him when he was little and is always talking about them, so I thought I would give it a try, see if they could match his grandmothers. He said they were great! Just like when he was a kid! This is so easy to make, I did mix the wet before the flour, turned out perfect.

Great basic recipe..my husband & girls liked them and a previous reviewer was correct, if you put your fillings in and serve right when its done cooking, you do not have to reheat it - it will remain hot enough.  I do like my crepes a little sweeter so I may add some vanilla extract or sugar next time.

Only used one egg and a bit more water, also added a tablespoon of sugar. Was ok. The batter was fairly lumpy even though I did as others suggested and mixed the wet ingredients first. Easy enough though.

It was the first time making crepes and they turned out to be amazing. My family loved it and it was very easy. I did te reverse of the instructions by mixing the eggs & other liquid ingredients first and then adding flour little by little.

Excellent recipe! I followed the advice of a couple of other readers and mixed the wet ingredients first, sifting in the flour. I also added 1/4 c. table sugar and 1/4 c. powdered sugar and a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. Delicious! This one's a definite keeper!

This was my first time making these, the only thing I didn't like was the batter came out lumpy and so did the crepes because of it.  In general they were very good I just need to figure out what went wrong.

These were very delicious, but if you like your crepes thin, like me, add a tbls extra of milk and water. Oh and I did add some vanilla extra, just a dash.

Oh these crepes were so tasty I also added the 1/3 granulated sugar and 1/4 of the powdered sugar.  I also added sliced bananas/strawberries/Orange marmalade/walnuts/whipcream and syrup.  My sister kept saying it tastes like im eating ice cream, and her husband who only likes to eat hot dogs (seriously) said they were very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really tasty, really simple, perfect for lots of applications!  I used this for blueberry & banana crepes with a sweet blueberry sauce and these came out perfectly.  They are not too sweet though, so I can see them being perfect filled with something savory like mushrooms and onion.  I also did the wet stuff first before the dry, and I did not oil the pans as my nonstick worked like a dream.

I always thought making crepes would be very technical, but this recipe is SO easy and the batter consistency is perfect!

Very good. I added a half teaspoon to sweeten it up a bit. It also tastes great using whole wheat flour. :)

Quick, EASY and yummy. : ) I made these with nutella and powdered sugar. (slathered with nutella, wrapped up all pretty, then lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar) They were so pretty, but so tasty that they didn't last long enough for a pic to be taken!

These were so delicious!!!!  Mine turned out perfectly.  The only change I made to the recipe was add a whole cup of milk (I was using skim) instead of add water.  Will make over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe! My 7yo loves these, too! They are easy and fast to make, and delicious! I made crepes in a home ec class in high school and had not attempted them since (and am not going to date myself here, but it was awhile ago). I can't believe I waited so long to try this again! Excellent breakfast/brunch, have made many times since first trying these! PS I use the cream cheese mixure from the Cheese Blitzes on this site in these.

this recipe is great. i made it for my family and then again for my coworkers every one loved it. deffinatly add in the vanilla and if you want to the cinnamon as well it really helps it out and give it a bit extra. this is very good with nutella, cream cheese, or a cream cheese frosting made of cream cheese, vanilla, and sweet condensed milk its sweet but with fruit on top very tasty.

I really liked this recipe. I put the batter in a blender and pulsed for a few seconds. Also, I added cinnamon, vanilla & 1 T of sugar. Next time I will make it savory with fresh herbs. The possibilities are endless! Thanks!

I had lost my crepe recipe long ago and was delighted to find this one! I tried it out this morning adding the 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and they came out perfect... just like I remember. The only thing I do differently is coat the pan with a tiny bit of butter before pouring each serving of batter into it (instead of using oil). Filled them with strawberry jelly and topped with powdered sugar. Too perfect! Thank you!

When I decided to make crepes for a bridal shower I was incredibly intimidated, but the first time I made these they all turned out perfect!  Very easy, and good. We love to have them for break fast and we fill some with ham, egg, and cheese, and some with fruit and a little whipped cream.

Excellent recipe! I do agree with the other reviewers with the 1 tbls sugar and vanilla. But I found I only add those things when its for fruit or something on the sweet side. I also added 1/4 cup extra milk to make it a little thinner. But I did make this recipe as is for an ommelet type breakfast and found the thinkness just right for heartier fillers.  Thanks for another family favorite!

Like another reviewer my batter was thick and I added more water for the crepes to be thin otherwise you have a pancake. I also added a little vanilla and sugar and wrapped these in chocolate fudge pudding with a dollop of whipped topping and the family love it !

Super simple and really really good! I love my crepes with butter, sugar, and Grand Marnier. Warmed Nutella with sliced banana is also heavenly with this. Makes me miss living in France!

Extrememly easy to make - and I usually burn things like this.
The batter was very lumpy at first.  I had to give it a lot of elbow grease to get it thinned out (don't have a mixer.)
I upped the recipe for 8 crepes (but it made 10 smaller ones.)  Used the sugar and vanilla extract like others had said.
These were somewhat rubbery.  Next time I will try putting them in the fridge like others suggested.
Will experiment with this one again and see if I can get the texture right.

So simple and delicious, my picky little sister always asks for this for breakfast. Followed the recipe exactly, except I used half the butter. I added some cream cheese w/sugar and strawberry jelly as the filling, delicious!

delicous and easy.  I needed to use more batter--maybe 1/3-1/2 c--to make a full circular crepe on my skillet. FYI, I also tried this with buckwheat flour: was not a good idea!

This recipe was great!!! I added suger a vanilla to the batter just like the other comments reccomended. I think some good fillings are strawberry jelly with cream cheese, strawberry jelly with chocolate syrup, and strawberry jelly with peanut butter. These crepes were really easy to lift off the pan. Thanks Jen!!!

Very good and a super easy recipe! I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tbsp sugar, like one reviewer suggested, then I made the "Supreme Strawberry Topping" (from this site). I rolled the finished crepe with the topping in the middle and sprinkled w/ powdered sugar and had the best dessert/breakfast ever! A keeper!

Delicious! My 6 yr. old daughter helped me make these and they turned out perfect. It helps if you have a crepe pan, which we got in France. I filled them with cut up fresh peaches which we cooked in a pan with a little sugar and a pinch of salt, then added a spoonful of sour cream and pinch of sugar to each crepe and rolled them up. SO yummy! Only my 3 yr. old didn't like them, everyone else loved them! Thanks!

This is an easy recipe that tastes great...I won't bother with any other after using this one.  I added a tbsp of splenda to sweeten it up for dessert crepes.  I took a cup of frozen mangoes and peaches, a sprinkle of cinnamon and a tbsp of sugar, , nuked it until thawed, minced it in the food processor and filled the crepes with this...they were delicious!

I thought this was great, and surprisingly simple to make for my first experience making crepes.  I used a little more than 1/4 cup batter per crepe.  I guess my pan was a little big because when I used only 1/4 cup and swirled, the batter didn't reach the edges and they weren't perfectly round.  They turned out tasty anyway.  I think next time I will add a touch of vanilla since I am using sweet fillings.

Wow! I always thought crepes were difficult and required special equipment. This recipe proved me wrong! Had fabulous results on my first try; I did incorporate one of the suggestions below and added 1 tbsp of sugar to the batter. I served with a shrimp/spinach/alfredo sauce mixture.

I will definitely be making this again!

Great and easy!  I did as someone else suggested and added a little sugar an vanilla, as well as a tiny bit more milk.  These were great!  I am usually crepe challenged, but this recipe worked out great.  I served them with mushrooms and asparagus in cream sauce.  My husband loved them!

Awesome recipe.  I made it the night before I was going to use it and stuck it through the blender.  It was so smooth and  cooked perfectally.  The taste was simple so it made the recipe useful for any kind of filling.  We tried everything from pudding to jelly, and strawberries to ice cream.  I would like to try it with Chicken ala King sometime.

These really ARE simple and delicious! They come out looking and tasting like a restaurant! I filled mine with apple pie (canned) filling because I was short on time. Next time I would go with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, sliced banana and some maple syrup...topped with a dollop of whipped cream! YUMMY! These can be whipped up while someone is clearing the dinner table or made in advance and refrigerated.

This Recipe is awesome. I made it in about 8 min and it tasted great. It was easy to flip on a greased pan and it tasted amazing. I did add a little sugar. I topped it off with homemade whip cream and a little lemon. It is a big hit for any morning and even for a mid-afternoon snack!!

A very good recipe. Used this with cinnamon, blackberry preserves, and nutella because that was what I had on hand. Due to another review, I used about 75% of a 1/2 cu. measuring cup for each crepe. Also made one savory crepe using just melted cheese which was equally tasty.

Tip: use a large spatula and once it's under the crepe a bit, shake the pan to coax the crepe unto the spatula solidly enough to flip it without tearing. When you're ready to put it on a plate, simply invert the pan quickly above the plate so it falls right off--perfectly shaped and never torn.

great tasting basic crepes which allowed for some creativity. I substituted soy milk for regular milk and they tasted just as good.

Wow!!  I made these for breakfast on Christmas morning and they were just perfect!!  I filled them with blueberry pie filling and sprinkled them with powdered suger.  Everyone loved them, and they looked as good as they tasted!!  They are really easy to make too.  
I found that they were easier to flip when I sprayed the spatula with Pam.  I am going to be making these often!!!

When I was a little girl, my grandfather made the best crepes around.  He passed before sharing his recipe.  This one is almost an exact replica of it, minus the love that was put into it.  I have made this recipe for breakfast the past 3 mornings.  SO SIMPLE and easy to make.  Great filled with different jellys or sour cream topped with fruit and powdered sugar.  I added cinnamon to the mixture instead of sugar for an added taste.

So easy and simple.  We fill them with a mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese and a little sugar.  You can also use orange marmalade or just plain butter.  Add 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 TBS sugar to the crepe batter for sweet fillings.  They are fantastic!

This is a good starter recipe. There is so much you can do with a good crepe. The crepes hold together very well and aren't too thin so they are easy to work with. Spread them with lemon curd or fruit spread and roll them up for quick breakfast on the way to school or work.

Although I've never made crepes before, this recipe was easy easy easy.  I blended the ingredients in a blender, making the batter very smooth.  I used a fairly new 8" nonstick skillet coated with butter.  Instead of using a spatula to turn them, I flipped them like I would an egg over easy.  Every single crepe turned out perfect.  I filled them with a variety of things and my family, even my young kids, gobbled them up.

The batter was delicious but I couldn't figure out how to keep the crepes from sticking to the pan..I think the heat may have been set too high.

I love this recipe, but I'm allergic to milk so I substitute water. My family has crepes with all sorts of veggies, ham, cheese, and berry varieties, or just with maple syrup or honey. Delicious anyway you want.

I surprised my fiance with this crepes for our breakfast on Valentine's Day. I sprayed peanut butter on top and make them into rolls. So as some strawberry jam rolls. We both enjoyed it so much. It's very simple and creative way to start our special day!! Thank you for sharing this!

This recipe is definately a winner! After visiting Europe and eating their wonderful crepes, I wanted to learn how to make my own. This was my first try, and they came out just perfect. My mom tried them and said I should become a professional chef after. Here are the only adjustments I made: a bit of vanilla and splenda to make them sweeter, and a bit extra water and milk because I wanted them thinner. They were good enough to eat plain, but even better with whipped cream, vanilla pudding and cinnamon sprinkled on top. I can't wait to try new variations.

Delicious and easy to make.  I added a little sugar and vanilla extract and served with the lemon butter recipe from this site!  My daughter just had butter and powdered sugar and asked for seconds!!  Thanks!

These crepes were good, but a bit bland. I might try making them again and adding a bit of white sugar. I hadn't previously made crepes, and this recipe was very easy.

Very good. I modified it a little by using 1 cup of milk (skipping the water) and adding half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. It was great with caramelised banana spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. So aromatic and tasty. My family just loved them at breakfast. But I'm sure the crepes will go well with anything.

This is the first time I've ever attempted crepes, and from what I'd read before trying, I was indeed intimidated!  This recipe was extremely easy to follow for this rookie, and the crepes were absolutely delicious!  We used strawberry preserves for filling, but they were a bit too sweet, and they overwhelmed the taste of the crepes.  Next time, we're going to go with unsweetened fruit!  Very tasty, Jen!

Loved the recipe.  Very easy to make did not call for alot of ingredients especially expensive and hard to find ingredients like most French recipes do.  Was even better when I filled them with Nutella & Jam.

This was very good, I usually use all water, but the milk was perfect.  I made these crepes and stuffed and rolled with filling of ricotta, mozzarella cheese, egg and parmesean cheese as I would do for a stuffed shell.  Made my own Manicotti... very easy with this receipe...

AWESOME RECIPE!! I'd never made crepes before, and decided to try this recipe. It was extremely easy to follow, and I thought the crepes would be hard to flip, but as long as you wait till they're perfectly cooked on the one side, they're a cinch to flip. I thought they were very tasty! I filled mine with a spinach, ricotta, ham, and nutmeg mixture and they were DELISCIOUS!!!!

This recipe would really benefit from some vanilla extract and sugar. It was very floury tasting, but then again I had to skip the butter since after I mixed up everything else I found out I had 0 butter in the house, oops. The butter I think would've sweetened it up and made it brown nicer but think flavor wise it still would've been very bland.

The crêpes had come out perfect, absolutely perfect! But BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS, the batter has come out to be bumpy for myself and other people, so definitely USE A STRAINER! It becomes so smooth and they taste awesome so definitely try these!!

Just melted the butter in the microwave in a tall empty plastic yogurt container and threw everything else in the container after melting the butter, and a dash of cinnamon. Used butter in the pan and they came out perfectly.

Very good crepes! I used my blender to combine the ingredients. I forgot to add the butter to the mixture, but alternated butter and coconut oil spray for each of the crepes. I wanted them on the sweeter side, so I added a few tblsp of  powdered sugar and one tsp of vanilla. I enjoyed three of these for dinner tonight on Shrove Tuesday, with tomorrow, Ash Wednesday, being the start of Lent. I filled them with a mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese and powdered sugar and had with a little maple syrup.  I also like a reviewer's suggestion of filling the crepes with sauteed finely chopped apples, butter, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg which could be for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the changes with mixing the flour into the wet ingredients. I found that the mix was a bit too thick, so I added (made a double batch) 1/4 cup more water to the mix. I got 16 crepes out of the double batch. I took some jiffy peanut butter and mixed it with some frosting for my filling and took some strawberries with sugar to put on top. Sprinkled it with some powder sugar and wow! So good! New family favorite instantly! Yum Yum!

I made these crepes for my mom and the whole family loved them I'm 14 and will make them again. Very easy recipe for the filling I put butter on the crepes and put a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on it the family loved it also instead of salt I put sugar in the mix.

The recipe was good once I added more water to get a thinner consistency. 1/2 cup of water is not enough; it made rubbery crepe. I mixed all the wet ingredients together and then added to the flour and salt - I had no lumps.

I Read reviews and decided to combine all wet ingredients first before putting them with the dry ingredients. It became a completely gude up Recipe where you couldn't even work yet. It was like Play-Doh will not try this one again.

The directions definitely need an update, whisking flour and eggs created a lumpy mess. Adding the flour last worked. Great crépes though!

Good recipe, but makes only five crepes, so not enough for the whole family. I put in 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour, and 3/4 of white. I like that it has no added sugar, but need to figure out how to increase the ingredients to make a larger batch.

Found a solution to the lumpy crepes, run the batter through a strainer and the lumps will get caught and you won’t have lumpy crepes hope this idea works. Happy cooking :)

Crepes have never come out as perfect for me before as these did today! I thought it seemed unusual to blend the egg and flour first, and after reading a review saying their attempt to go in that order resulted in lumpy batter, I decided to blend differently. First, I whisked the egg, milk, and water. Added the salt and a touch of orange blossom water for the thrill of it. Whisked in the flour until mostly smooth. I added the melted butter last so the cold of the milk/egg mixture Wouldn’t solidify the butter before it had a chance to blend in... maybe overthinking it, but It worked out great.  I cooked them in an 8” pan that I wiped a very thin layer of canola oil in and But if butter. Scooped the batter with 1/4 measuring cup, but thought it needed just another 1/8 cup more. They looked beautiful, tasted great, and had a wonderful texture. Saved this recipe  to my favorites for future use.

amazing! i think it was a combination of me perfecting the technique and this recipe, but these are the best crepes i've made so far. i added a splash of vanilla and a little bit of sugar since i was going to use sweet toppings, and they turned out wonderful. this will be my go to crepe recipe!

It was very simple and fast, tasted delicious, and I very much enjoyed making it for my family! The only thing I would recommend doing different is using buckwheat flour instead of regular. It doesn't puff up as much.

Awesome EASY recipe for those first timers venturing into making crepes (me)! I did add 1 tsp of granulated sugar and based on the comments, I did the wet ingredients first then the dry ones. Easier than making pancakes!

I agree with others- if you don’t want lumpy crepes, reverse the directions... mix the eggs, milk, water and butter first, THEN slowly add the flour mixing the entire time.  Very easy and delicious.

Love this recipe,  and it's a keeper!! We had them with nutella,  strawberries and whipped cream.  I mixed  ALL THE INGREDIENTS  ALL AT ONCE with a splash of vanilla,  my batter came out nice and smooth,  no lumps.  When I was done making the creaps, I noticed I had forgotten to add the butter! I would definitely make this recipe again and I will leave the butter out.

To one egg, added a dash of salt, 1/2 t baking powder,  1/2 t baking soda,  3/4 T sugar and 1/4 t vanilla extract. Used 3/4 cup 2% milk and just enough flour to produce a liquidity batter.  Good for 3 crepes.

Works out really well. I substituted almond milk for cow milk and agree with others that you should always mix the wed ingredients first and then add the dry. I also added som maple syrup to the batter.

This recipe was really easy to make. My only problem was that my crepes did taste a bit too eggy, but I blame that on the double yolk I was suprised with. If I were to make this again (and I probably will) I would add some vanilla extract and maybe a little sugar to the batter.

Great crepes, turned out really delicious!  I ended up multiplying the recipe by 6.

The only issue I had was mixing the eggs with the flour was very difficult, and once done, mixing the milk and water in afterwards was even harder.  So much so I had to use a electric wand mixer to get it all consistent.  For anyone trying this I’d suggest mixing the eggs flour AND water altogether at once rather than just the eggs and flour.  Then add the milk after.  Otherwise you’re in for a very sore wrist.  Other than that the crepes turned out great and are better than any variation I’ve made before.

Super simple. When I follow the directions for mixing I always end up with small lumps because the egg and flour mixture doesn’t mix well into the other ingredients. I recommend adding the milk to the eggs and flour before mixing the first time to avoid this.

Turned out delicious.  I would recommend combining the liquid ingredients first , adding a tsp. of vanilla, and then gradually adding dry ingredients using a mixer with a wire whisk.  Or wire whisking yourself.  But other than that, I made them twice, and they were perfect!!!

The first two I made were way too soft and tender and had more egg taste into it (I think it was me that made a mistake?). Rest were perfect.

Turned out wonderful! I followed a note made by another user and mixed the wet ingredients before adding the flour, and it came out lump free.

Great recipe. I added a spoonfull of more milk to increase the liquid. This helped it spread wider and thin on the pan. I also add a little vanilla extract, a small cap full. Perfect recipe for two people. I also spray the pan with non-stick canola oil, helps a lot.

The recipe was easy to execute, great tasting result.  To elevate mine, I pitted fresh Rainier Cherries, macerated them in a small heavy pot, added chopped walnuts and a half cup 100% Maple Syrup and a tablespoon of real vanilla extract. I simmered until thickened and used as a deliciously rich topping for these delicious crepes.

Never. Ever. Whisk flour and eggs together. Recipe was a lumpy mess. Wish I had read the comments section. Please review and edit this recipe. As soon as I put the whisk in I know the recipe was ruined, I got a lump of batter in my whisk. And I had no extra milk and hate wasting food, so I put my hands in after adding the milk and water and ground d out most of the lumps myself but it wasn’t perfect. Next time I’ll either use someone else’s recipe or at least read the comments first.

I had forgotten the recipe I used to use so I started with this one. I should have read all the way through first. I guess most people do not own a traditional crepe pan ( the pan is convex and you need your batter to be thin and in a pie pan.)You heat and lightly butter the crepe pan using a paper towel, invert the hot pan and dip quickly into the batter.  Cook for about 90 seconds should easily peel off with the edge of a fork and your fingers pulling off the crepe. This batter recipe is way too thick to do this with, I fixed it by using the nordic ware website. It uses 3 time the milk only 6 tablespoons of water and adds another egg. It it designed for the proper crepe pan. I added a photo of my crepe pan.

I made these using unsweetened almond milk and vegan butter instead of the regular choices for those two ingredients and they were great! Only thing I have to say about it is, the batter was slightly thick for a crepe recipe. I found mixing the wet ingredients all together then sifting the flour in worked much better than the recipe said which was the other way around. Going to try it a little adjusted next time for a smoother batter!

I knew better than to mix the egg into the flour first. LUMPS?? Shame on me. I recommend mixing all wet then slowing adding the dry ingredients.

Great recipe with much less butter than other recipes but still delicious! Yummy with a little sprinkled sugar (1/2 tsp or so) and fresh fruit slices wrapped inside. We used 2 thin nectarine slices. My granddaughter’s favorite!

Great recipe. Definitely the dry ingredients should be mixed, then add all the wet stuff at once (or vice versa, I suppose) to avoid lumps. I mixed the batter using my KitchenAid. Will make again!

Very simple! I use seltzer instead of water for lightness. you can try a flavored seltzer,  but I use plain. I also added vanilla extract and a little simple syrup. The first crepe was too dense so I added more seltzer and....perfect!

Doubled recipe, made about 14 of varying sizes.
Added vanilla - 2 tbsp to doubled recipe.
Battery was quite clumpy. Took extra mixing to thin it out.

Amazing! I've tried many recipes but this one is now my favorite. The only comment I would make is mix the wet ingredients first, then SIFT the flour, (it helps a ton) and lastly add butter and salt. Then it is perfect. Otherwise, the batter ends up lumpy and you basically have to scrap it.

Was good. No changes. Can go savory or sweet with this recipe. Required less butter compared to other recipes I saw and still came out great. Thanks for the recipe. ... Oh, I figured out that tilting the pan and pouring it in the high side and letting it run down made them come out thinner than pouring it in the middle and swirling it around.

Mixing the eggs with flour is a little weird and ended up with chunky  batter. Would recommend mixing wet ingredients and then sifting in flour.

It was very nice, the only reason I’m giving 4 star was the batter was a bit thicker than it should. :)

Soooo easy and yummy! I just added a bit of sugar (1.5 tbs), vanilla extract (1/4 tsp), cinnamon (few shakes), and nutmeg (couple shakes) since I was making dessert crepes. Also as mentioned, I sifted dry ingredients into wet. Definitely a keeper!

i've made these crepes many times and found that the mixture becomes very lumpy after adding the wet ingredients. the best tip is to sift the flour into the eggs first and ensure that that mixture is all combined first x

Excellent recipe. The key is whisking consistently and making sure the butter is melted properly. The eggs and flour do lump up but the moment you start to mix the milk water and then the butter it gets very smooth. Whisk briskly until smooth. Made this and sunny side up eggs and a glass of Prosecco for my husband and I. Best breakfast ever.

This was by far the worst crepe recipe I've ever followed. They were edible, sure, but absolutely the smelliest, most sticky, difficult to make crepes I've ever attempted. Honestly, like I'm not even exaggerating I actually hated them, and it usually takes a lot for me to hate a crepe recipe. Like I've made some pretty crappy recipes for crepes in the past but this one just take the cake. This recipe is fortunate enough to get two stars only because they were at least somewhat edible and only half tasted like mouldy playdough. WARNING! MAKE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Don't say I didn't warn ya if your crepes turn out so disgusting that even your dog refuses to eat them, I tried xD

The advice to mix the eggs into the flour is just wrong. It created a thick mess that was difficult to thin out when adding the liquid.  It took a lot of beating to get the lumps out.  It’s just wrong to have to beat the batter until smooth which was not completely possible. I’ll be looking for another recipe.

Super easy and tasty! If you have one of those nonstick copper pans, it makes doing these a breeze, since you don’t have to oil the pan at all.

The ingredients are right but the recipe as written does not result in good crepes. By mixing the eggs and flour first this ends up with a very lumpy batter. Crepe batter should be thin and smooth.

 If you are making this recipe mix the wet and dry separately then combine.

Easy to make . My adult daughter had some at ihop the week prior and said theirs were like tiny rubber sheets without any color on them. These are slightly rubbery with little flavor . Any suggestions on what flavoring that could be added might be beneficial. The recipe works great as far as the process goes , just needed a little flavor.

EASY! We made this in juvenile detention for a cooking project. For a change up- we used organic food coloring and divided the recipe so that  the crepes came out with bright, beautiful colors. We mixed some cream cheese with lemon and sugar. We also cooked blueberries sweetened them with sugar, added some lemon juice and thickened them with cornstarch. Last, we made the Southern Fried Apples with frozen apples from my apple tree.  To assemble, 3 dolapes cream cheese, a spoon of blueberries, then roll the crepe, drizzle a little more blueberry and a side of apples --- This project was a HIT!

The crepes are bland. It’s better to put in a tablespoon or two of sugar and some vanilla in the batter.

Turned out great! Had to add slightly more water to thin it out a bit but that’s likely the difference in brands of flour. Also I added the dry slowly into the wet whisking constantly and had no lumps. Family loved it! Thanks!

Sooo, I doubled the recipe so we could enjoy more crepes and they taste really great, only problem we had was they were kind of fat for crepes, maybe it was how hot I had the skillet. Also realized halfway in that I’d forgotten the butter. Once I turned it down and added butter they turned out perfect.

I also tried with choco chips in the batter near the end just for curiosity sake. So good!

Update: made them the second time from start to finish and they were almost perfect crepe texture. Just didn’t follow mixing instructions so i assume it does help something with texture more than I thought.

great recipe! in order to prevent the lumpiness that people see (including myself), you must do the following. Melt butter fully and set aside. Add the flour, eggs and milk/water first and fully mix. Pour butter a little at a time into mix, mixing vigorously.

Crepes come out thin and are easily spread over a large pan or griddle. They hold their form and act like flour tortillas holding fresh fruit or savory fillings. Best recipe I've tried.

I want to give this a 1 star but I’m taking into account that I could have done something wrong in making them. So I’m meeting in the middle. The crepes were gummy. They just had a very odd consistency. They were also thicker than crepes I’ve had at a restaurant. I’ve made crepes at home before and that recipe called for eggs plus some egg yolks. I’m going to try and find that recipe and compare the two because I really do want to like this recipe. Obviously everyone else does.

Adding eggs directly to flour is odd. My batter was extremely lumpy because of this. I've made lots of crepes before and never had this problem. I knew i should have ignored that direction

First attempt to make crepes.  I am aware that some purists say you need a crepe pan but since I don't own one I used a skillet.  Per some various comments, and that they are essentially thin pancakes,  I added zest of one orange,  juice from one orange,  and omitted the salt during to dietary restrictions. I then topped them with some unsalted butter and dusted on some confectioners sugar.  They turned out very well and I think I like them better than pancakes in a way. Other than the 3 ingredient additions I prepared the batter as the recipe is written.  Considering it was my first time making crepes and not having the crepe pan. I think these turned out pretty good,  pics sent.

I'm 15 and a terrible chef and this was really easy to make. I made some for my mom and sister and I modified the recipe to add some vanilla extract and brown sugar and both my mom and sister say it's one of the best crepes they ever tasted! This was the 3rd time making this recipe this week and so I created an account to rate this amazing recipe!

Really easy to make. Had to add about 1/4 to 1/4 cup of milk to thin it out a little. The recipe as directed made them a little thick. I also added a little vanilla and a pinch of sugar instead of the salt. Topped them with Felix Lingonberries.  Yum!

Much like all the rest, I whisked together the wet ingredients together FIRST before adding in the flour. I also sifted the flour a little bit at a time to make sure there was no lumps (and also because as someone with Carpal Tunnel, whisking all that flour together would’ve hurt a lot). I also added about a 1/4 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract to help boost the flavour a little bit. Small tip for the newbies to crepes: Wait until the edges of the crepe starts to curl up before flipping it for the first time. If you absolutely have to grease your pan, do so gently so you don’t mess up the batter. :)

It smells awesome. Also, it looks awesome. You can see butter making little cute bubbles in the dish. But the correct coloring/cooking is important for a good appearance.

It made a salty taste but it's still suitable for sweet wrappings. I preferred salty wraps though.

I loved it with Izmir Tulum cheese(I personally prefer a Tulum with light taste). I also tested with chocolate paste but I loved cheese so much that I only eat a half crepe with chocolate. I didn't try with powder sugar yet.

Really simple and tasted great. Next time I’ll save the effort and just wisk these using my kitchen aid starting with the wets.

I have never made Crepes before but these were so easy to make and my whole family loves them! They have become a staple in our house and my four year old requests them on a regular basis.

I just use a hand mixer to incorporate all of the ingredients.  These aren't like pancakes where you can over-stir the ingredients.  You actually want the batter to be really smooth and runny.  So ignore the instructions and just through everything in the bowl and blend together.  They turn out great and the kids love them for a special breakfast.

I made a few adjustments: I did two egg whites and one egg yolk to lower the cholesterol, I did almond milk instead of whole milk, and I did one tablespoon of butter instead of two. These crepes are so yummy and I recommend this to everyone!

I usually make these more on the sweet side and double the recipe by adding an additional 1/4 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Also use a 1/4 cup of batter when using a 10" pan.  I'm sure that you can use a little less but this seems to coat the bottom of the pan the best.

For the basic recipe, this is alright. Add the dry ingredients slowly, not the wet. This will result in a better consistency to your batter.

I added a tsp of Vanilla extract.

Also, this is not in the directions, but the secret to making crepes that don’t tear is letting the batter rest an hour before putting them in your pan. This allows the bubbles to settle so that there aren’t “weak spots” in your crepes

I’ve been making this recipe for over a year now and I’m so happy I found it! I mix all the ingredients together, I never could figure out how to do the eggs and flour first but they always turn out great the way I mix it. It makes about 8 good size crepes, we fill them with berries and put powdered sugar on top. Thank you so much Jenny!

Easy and delicious. I added  grated rind of one lemon and 1/2 lemon juice and 1/3cup sugar for our traditional Hungarian palaschinta or crepes. We fill with current or strawberry jam roll them up and eat them for dessert. Will make again and again!

They take some practice to get them coming out of the pan not looking like scrambled eggs, but once you have it down, they're pretty good. I had to add some salt and sugar to the batter. I quadrupled the recipe (by accident… I meant to double it) and it was the perfect amount to feed my family plus some extras for the next day. OVERALL, it's a good recipe if you have made these before, and make sure to double it for 2-4 people and quadruple it for 5 or more people. 
SUGGESTIONS: 
- add a few large pinches of sugar to the batter
- do not put oil in the pan
SUGGESTIONS FOR TOPPINGS:
- goat cheese or feta (or flavored like Boursin(R) ) with veggies like spinach, tomato, and cucumbers
- white cheddar cheese with spinach and other veggies
- dessert crepe with whipped cream and honey
- dessert crepe with hazelnut chocolate spread

I don't know what it was...I followed the instructions, got all of the clumps out and even strained it. But it still comes out raw looking and tasting ecen thought I've cooked it on high head, low heat, and for different times.

Not a bad recipe at all! Very simple, and common ingredients most have on hand. Like most crepes- the first to cook is always the “practice pancake”... best to discard, as the rest cook properly & the light, soft texture they should be. I actually did 2 batches, as I found one batch makes about 8 medium crepes, total. The second batch came out WAY better than the first, because of the pan being hot & well seasoned at that point. But, 8 medium crepes is not bad at all for the minimal amount of ingredients! 

My only complaint is that I had a difficult time keeping “lumps” out of the batter. Definitely had to stir it constantly between pouring it into the pan, and even then, I had several that came out with some penny-size chunks in them. So, I don’t really know how to keep that from happening- maybe using a whisk to stir instead of a spoon? 

Overall, these were really easy, fairly quick to make & I am happy with the result. They tasted great, even plain! I topped mine with strawberries, a little chocolate drizzle & whipped cream, but there are really a TON of ways you can stuff or top crepes, depending on the meal! Will definitel keep this recipe & continue trying to perfect it.

I found that if you added the flour eggs and the milk and water all together at once and then with them it wasn’t so lumpy and yes I’ll make this many times more.

Very good recipe! It was the first time I've made crepes. I think freshly made, these are an absolutely delicious eggy treat, but a bit on the oily/buttery side when you hold them in your hand. perhaps that cannot be avoided. No need to oil your pan. Also, when made ahead of time and left in the fridge, if you don't microwave them, they are a bit hard/rubbery. Microwaving will do the trick to revitalize them to perfection, but if you fill them with whipped cream like I did, that will leave you a delicious runny mess! haha. But they are really good, the husband cannot get enough. Will make again.

This is a very good recipe! I wouldn’t change anything, unless you make the batter the night before you cook the crepes.  I made the batter on a Sunday night for breakfast Monday morning. If you do this, I recommend adding a splash of extra milk when you take the batter out of the fridge in the morning, and stir.

I cut this recipe in half and the only thing different I did was about double the liquid so the crepe was really thin. I followed a previous suggestion of swooshing the batter around the pan and when the crepe moved smoothly it was ready to turn. I stuffed with eggs and cheese and it was fabulous.

So simple and so tender!  I make these first thing in the morning and let the batter set for at least a half hour while I prep the filling.  My favorite is the Smoked Salmon with Dill Sauce.  My family and guests rave about it.  Another great and simple filling is to simply sprinkle granulated sugar on the crepe, zest some lemon and squeeze the juice . . .oh my!

This recipe makes perfect crepes! They were easy to spread and held together well. The recipe says to mix eggs with flour, and even though I knew I shouldn’t I did anyway. It wasn’t anything a stick blender couldn’t fix, but I should have mixed all the wet ingredients together.

These were surprisingly very easy to make! I was always scared to try making crepes! This recipe was simple and turned out well. I did tweak it a bit to my family's likings by adding a bit of sugar. It was light and delicate and tasted well even without anything on them. I ended up serving them with sliced fruit and maple syrup. I want to try them now as a savory mushroom and spinach filled version this week. I am sure they will turn out well. The children did enjoy this recipe!

I did everything according to the recipe, and it turned out great! Because of the other comments' problems with lumpy batter, I made sure to incorporate the liquids very slowly, resulting in a super smooth batter and crepes my siblings loved!

This batter was very thick and did not taste good. You should refrigerate for an hour. I agree with people who said it turned into scrambled eggs.

I made a delicious cherry filling to go along with it. It was great! My family loved it! The only change I would recommend is adding 2 tsp of vanilla to make it taste less plain.

Delish!! Perfect crepes. I mixed my dry and wet separately first. I added the flour little by little to all the wet ingredients. Added 1 tsp vanilla to the batter. I also used my KitchenAid hand mixer. I put some powdered sugar in too. I would say three tablespoons worth. I don’t have a crepe maker so I used my rectangular, electric nonstick skillet and it worked perfectly. For filling I used non-fat greek yogurt with powdered sugar and vanilla. Yum!

Excellent recipe! Very simple, very delicious. I don't know why the instructions say whisk the eggs and flour first; that results in a sticky dough you then have to liquify with the water and milk. Just beat everything together at once (sans the butter and salt). 

Also, I recommend spreading the batter out with a spatula as soon as it hits the pan. The batter cooks incredibly fast so you might end up with a very lopsided crepe if you try spreading it by tilting the pan.

Being from Québec, I love breakfast crepes. This recipe is fabulous, and my first-ever homemade crepes came out perfectly! I served them with fresh bananas, strawberries, and blueberries, warm custard, and whipped cream on top.

Thank you :D

I made the recipe as written but then realized that it had no flavor. After adding 1/4 tsp sugar and a few drops of vanilla it made it more like the crepes I remember from France. I am an experienced Swedish pancake maker so I guess  I chose to make these more like Swedish pancakes.

MADE THEM GLUTEN FREE mine gluten free, with “Namaste foods for everyone, gluten free perfect flour blend.”Initially following the recipe with this cup for cup flour, made them too thick.  To ensure consistency I recommend mixing all ingredients separately, then slowly sift GF flour into liquid mix until right consistency.  Should be extremely thin, able to easily spread out onto your cooking pan.

I serve these with a dollup of cream cheese spread on them and berries. Always a favourite! If you have an electric stove, medium or med-low setting works best; it doesn't need two minutes on one side. I flipped after the sides started to steam.

Really great introduction to making crepes. I used almond milk instead of cow milk and it worked great. Mine were a bit harder and crispier though but I think that's because I cooked them for too long on each side. Maybe cook them at a slightly lower temperature for less time on each

Wow! These are so delicious. My family ate these with Nutella but I’m dying to try with a savory dish as well. We just came back from Paris and these brought us back.

This recipe is definitely easy to follow and make great batter. I even substitute the wheat flour with Gluten Free Flour (garbanzo, fava, & brown rice) and use almond milk & butter milk with exactly the measurements. It turns out really really great! It’s my first attempt making crepes on stainless steel pan, can’t ask better than this.

Super easy and way better than when I try to water down my pancake batter.  Tasted great and my kids loved it!! I substitute gluten free flour like Pamela's baking mix for my daughter who has Celiac Disease.  You would never know it was gluten free!

This is a very great yet basic crepe recipe. I substituted 3 tsp of peanut butter for butter, because I didn't have butter at the time. Crepes tasted great when cinnamon and jam is added to the crepe for a final touch and flavor.

I always sift out the lumps for a smoother crepe batter! Comes out perfectly every time. Also I typically refrigerate the batter for 30 minutes before cooking.

Doubled the receipe and added vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp. Also followed suggestion to add the sifted dry ingredients to the combined liquid ingredients and after whisking all, I added the melted butter. This yielded 20 crepes on a 9.5 inch pan. My husband loved them. Great receipe.

Great recipe. Thank you. I have found the method of mixing the cloud and the by does work as long as you are willing to spend more time whisking everything when you are the wet ingredients. If you want to spend less time on this recipe, first mix dry and then all went in separate bowl and mad a well in the cloud and whisk everything together. And make sure your own is not enough before you put the first crepe on. I find the first is the hardest and they all cook consistently after that.

Wet ingredients together. Mix in flour slowly. Remember to add a little oil/butter after every crepe to ensure it doesn't stick. Perfect thin crepes! Little crispy on the outside! Definitely making this again!

I am 100% satisfied with the result. Made half of recipe.  The crepes came out tender and tasty, and I will use this recipe from now on. The 4 stars rather than 5 is because 1. Mixing eggs and flour doesnt work for me, i used the usual method of mixing all liquids then adding flour, and 2. The key to tender tasty result is having all ingredients at room temp, to start, then letting the batter  stand at toom temp at least 1 h. before cooking. I feel a well written recipe should contain all of the important points, rather than taking chances.
Also, the batter may be kept in fridge overnight, but before frying bring it to room temp, which may take 2 hours.

The directions do not match the video. If you add the eggs to the flour as directed the results are an unmanageable ball. After watching the video, I added the flour as the last ingredient and the batter was beautiful.

Great recipe! My changes:  1) I used almond milk instead of the milk/water, and found that I needed to add roughly a 1/4 cup more so the batter would spread evenly around my crepe pan. 2) Also used 1 tbs sugar. 3) I combined all wet ingredients first, sifted the dry, then added the wet to dry as I would have cake batter and whisked, then rested for 30 mins - mixing the eggs/flour together to start with struck me as strange. Will make again :)

I’ve made crepes in the past but forgot my recipe. Then I found this one. I made it and it was heavenly. Only thing I did was add a very small amount of vanilla. Heavenly with banana and Nutella. Your recipe is just like my old one. Thank you for sharing. Loved every bite.

I made these savory with cheese, caramelised shallots and olives. After flipping the crepe I piled on the filing, folded it in half,  cooked on both sides to melt the cheese. Yummy!

For the batter  I used 1 cup of milk, no water.  I sift the flour in a bowl, make a hole in the middle and crack the eggs in. Start whisking in the hole adding milk slowly drawing in small amounts of flour at a time. Perfect consistency every time. Make sure you are using a non stick pan and it's very hot. You only need a little butter in the pan, or it curdles  the batter and you want it sizzling hot. I only added butter to the pan for every other crepe.

The batter is sooo thick. You absolutely need a crepe pan to make this.  I only did 1 star because it was the smallest rate possible.

I will definitely make this recipe again!  The only thing I would suggest is to add the ingredients in a different order to insure that the crepes do not have any lumps. Otherwise amazing recipe.

Great recipe. I found out that if you use too much oil or oil that is not cooking spray the crepes will break apart like scrambled eggs almost

Like other people mentioned it works best to mix the liquids first than the dry ingredients, but other than that it's a perfect recipe. I'm so used to adjusting online recipes but this is one of the few where I didn't have to change any measurements.

Great recipe, quick and easy. Had to add a touch more water so batter would move around pan. Great flavour, definitely use this recipe again.

Pretty good! A bit skeptical at first with the eggs and flour, but turned out good. When fried the edges get pretty crunchy though. Not sure if that is with all crepes

In response to BABYGIRL30S:
Let the crepe cook longer before trying to flip it. It seems like forever for such a thin amount of food. The edges will pull away from the pan when it is ready to be flipped. If your first is sticking, leave the second on longer, and so on. There should be very little/no scraping to get the crepe away from the pan. A super thin spatula helps too.  I hope you give this recipe another go! (I just realized she tried this recipe 11 years ago. I'm slow.)

I changed this a little bit. Instead of water I added extra milk. For a filling, I took one package of cream cheese, 2 tbsp of sugar, 2 tbsp of whipped cream, 1/8 cup diced strawberries. I then rolled them up and topped with homemade whipped cream. It was a huge success and I will definitely be making this again

I can't even believe how good these are! Such simple ingredients, easy to prep, and the flavor was heavenly. I mixed all ingredients saving the flour, mixed them well to get a light fluffiness. I added a tbsp of sugar to mine. Then I mixed in the flour until the mixture was smooth. Having a good nonstick pan/griddle that heats evenly is key here. These crepes are French/German style so they cook up super fast. Shake the pan as soon as you see the edges lightly brown, flip them, and then don't wait long before you take them off the fire. They are truly perfect and I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

I just finished making these crepes.  Mine came out wonderful with a few changes, mainly in the prep.  I whisked together the milk, water and eggs really well, added the cooled melted butter and again whisked well.  Then added the flour and salt.  Still whisking!  The batter should be lump free and pretty thin. After my first test crepe which was too thick, I added 2 tablespoons of water to the batter.  I used a full 1/4 cup measure in a 9 inch crepe pan, swirled well, and I had 8 nicely finished crepes.

Lovely thin crepes are a nice change up from fluffy pancakes. Had mine with banana, maple syrup, and a dusting of icing sugar. However, I did half the recipe which yielded only 2.5 crepes when it should've made 4.

I make crepes for my family every new years morning and this is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe I've used. The ingredients are basic. I love the video. It gives great demo for first time crepe makers. I've given the site info to my adult sons who are making their own new years crepes this year. I had not thought of some of the non-dessert filling suggestions and plan to try them.  I did add about 2 T of sugar to our dessert crepes batter. Yum! I would use an electric mixer to prevent lumps  or add dry ingredients very gradually to wet ingredients if mixing by hand.

The best crepe recipe I've tried, and I've tried many. I always want to try one that's more complicated, but why? This is always my favorite. Just do as everyone else says and do the wet and dry ingredients separate.

Great crepes!   Only change is to forget the whisk and use a beater for the flour and eggs....no lumps.  Will definitely make again.   The recipe made  9 crepes.

Make sure that you completely scrape all of the flour off the bottom. I found that this recipe made chunky crepes that  caused me to continuously mix the batter. Crepe tasted fine but were a little too thick and doughy for my liking.

Very nice and easy. 2nd time I made it though, I didn’t bother with trying to mix the flour with the egg before adding the milk. Instead I put all the ingredients except for the flour and butter  in the blender and added those 2 a bit at a time as the blender was going. Once all the ingredients were in there, I gave it all a good blast in the blender at high speed to make sure everything is well mixed. I find the crepes can be made thinner by using more milk or water than the recipe calls for. And by frying it in the frying pan I just flip them over in the air using the pan rather than messing around with a spatula. My daughter was able to do it the 2nd time she tried - she was so proud :)

I followed the advice of those who mixed liquids first and added dry ingredient second. After that, this recipe came out very nicely - the batter is thin enough to spread well into a very thin crepe. It also fries up nicely, loosening along its edges well to make flipping easier. Basic is an accurate description flavor-wise - if you want sweeter, you'd probably do need to add sugar etc. Savory crepes might also be embellished by herbs added to the batter. I focused on the filling rather than changing the batter. I added cheese slices and a stir fried mix of chicken, onions, garlic and spinach.  I doubled the recipe and made 4 savory, then 4 sweet crepes for dinner. The sweet ones we just filled with cut fruit, whipped cream and a drizzle of lemon curd. There was leftover batter, so I covered the mixing cup with plastic wrap and next day made 4 more.  I had to re-stir the mix a bit, but 2nd day crepes came out equally well.

We added our usual additions to most breakfast recipes: cinnamon and pinch of salt to taste. Instead of 1/2 cup of water, we used apple juice. 
It was ridiculously good........some whipped cream topping with powdered sugar and I didn’t need any syrup. Perfect balance of light sweet crepes with a salted buttery flavor. my husband’s cooking standards are pretty high being he can cook me out of the kitchen any day and make anything amazingly well...and hours later he couldn’t stop remarking how delicious these crepes were. A new staple to our breakfast Saturdays!

NOTE: mix wet & dry ingredients separately! Also, feel free to add more melted butter to your recipe. It was a nice adjustment! Savory butter flavor to balance the apple juice.

The recepie uses too many eggs. The batter turns out too thick and doesn’t have the liquid consistency. Great for just pancakes with lots of protein.

I use vanilla almond milk instead of the milk and water. I also add about 1/2 cup of sugar and approximately 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Served with whipped cream and fresh strawberries

Easy and great results. Only changes were adding vanilla and whisking dry ingredients into wet. 1/4c batter made approximately 6" crepes. Will definitely make again.

I definitely agree with those saying that the order needs to be switched.  I followed the original recipe and it was unnecessarily difficult to make the clumpy egg-flour mixture before adding wet ingredients.

Turned out great! I mixed the wet ingredients first before adding flour. The second time I made this, I added more milk and about 2 tbsp of sugar as I found it super bland the first time around.

My go to crepe recipe! These are my favorite things to make for breakfast on Saturday morning. You can go sweet with fresh strawberries and cream cheese sauce (cream cheese, brown sugar, vanilla mixed until smooth) or do savory with scrambled eggs, sautéed mushrooms, fresh spinach, feta, and fancy sauce (ketchup, mayo, horse radish) - this one is my favorite!!

These crepes were so easy to make! I cooked these 1 min and 15 sec on each side, and they were light, fluffy, and golden brown. I was skeptical when I whisked the eggs with the flour, but the clumpy texture was soon gone after adding in the butter, milk, and water. I had to make these for a class project, and they were delicious! I recommend adding banana and raspberry jam for the finishing touches (maple syrup is also delicious!) Another note: I had enough batter for 6, but they were really tiny.

Easy in a good pan.  Followed other's advice and mixed wet ingredients first, then sprinkling in the flour. I used my mixer in low to avoid lumps. Perfect.

Easy, quick and delicious.  Made 10, 8" crepes. Be sure to use a non-stick type of pan or grease well before each one.  I can see it being a real struggle if it sticks.  We loaded with wild blueberries, fresh peaches and bananas plus Nutella and finished up with a little maple syrop...yummy and relatively healthy with all the fresh fruit.

This is a great recipe, but it needs to be mixed in a food processor. I mixed until my arm ached but the lumps remained. 
Still tasted very good and I will keep this recipe in my Recipe Box.

Love this batter and it works with several fillings that my family loves such as chocolate, strawberries and chocolate, blueberries and sugar, butter and sugar, etc. Its super simple and easy to make as well as not too heavy or light. It's a little tricky to find the perfect temperature to cook them on and for how long but as long as you keep an eye on it you will be fine!

Great recipe and also make sure to leave it in the fridge for at least an hour and mix it well after you take the batter out. This recipe makes about 10 crepes which is great! Awesome recipe!

Just double the ingredients to get more than 10 crepes (12-15), and cover them with another plate if you like them soft. Couple of people need 6-8, refrigerate the rest if they "survive" the first "battle" ;)

Overall, a pretty good tasting recipe. However, DO NOT USE THE GIVEN METHOD! I have tried this recipe multiple times with the given recipe, and it always turned out the same: super thin, watery, liquid of milk and water with huge lumps of egg and flour clumps. Absolutely unusable. So I used the same ratios but with a different method. Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl, and add the milk and water to it and whisk together. Then add the eggs and combine, and then add the melted butter. This is the method my dad taught me and it has always worked. I also like my crepes sweet, so I added in 1 1/2 table spoons of sugar.

EASY! I didn't mix the ingredients in the suggested order but I did leave the proportions intact. I made 1/2 recipe by melting 1 tbsp butter in a large mixing bowl (in the microwave) and then adding 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup milk to the warm melted butter to cool it down before mixing in one egg. Next I added a pinch of salt and 1/2 cup AP flour and mixed until smooth (makes 4 - 10 inch crepes). I filled mine with blueberries and goat cheese, but these crepes are so neutral in flavor that they could as easily be used for a savory dish rather than a sweet one. Very delicious and as easy as it gets ;)

Easy peasy and tasty.. but the instructions?  I looked at them, knew it was really odd, but tried it anyway... yeah. dont  mix eggs and flour... this equals big lump. You can mix it out fine, but it is MUCH easier to mix liquids then add all at once to flour. I asked a couple of professional chefs if there could be any possible reason for  this to be mixed the original way?  Nope was the answer... I made my crepes savory... stuffed them with meatballs, marinara, cheese sauce and spinach.  YUM

Really good! The instructions as written are just fine! People just jumped the gun and thought that the batter would be unusable but as you add the other ingredients it gives it a good texture.

Made using gluten free flour from Trader Joe's and everything else as written. Was my first time making crepes so I had no idea if the GF flour would work or not but they did! Perhaps I made these a bit thicker than "traditional" ones, but still: Very good!

I've been making this every weekend for about 2 months now. 
I find mixing the eggs and water/milk first, then adding the salt and flour make the batter smoother. I add the butter last.
You need a nice hot pan to start...my first crepes didn't cook well until I learned to preheat my pan.
I also make sure I have a pre-measured portion of batter waiting for when I'm done a crepe and ready to make the next one...saves time and keeps my pan hot.
Kids love these! And so do I

These were amazing!  I doubled the recipe, mixed everything together except I whisked the eggs first, and added 1Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp powdered sugar. So good and so easy!  Could be savory or sweet.

Just made these with my 5 year old.  We mixed the wet ingredients first then added the dry.  Very simple and yummy.  We will make these again for sure! 
We stuffed ours with berries, topped with powder sugar and  whipped cream.  A fun Sunday breakfast!

So I was actually given this recipe by a friend who called it German Pancakes the only difference was I mixed the two eggs and 1/3 cup milk.  Then added 1/2 cup water and slowly whisked in 1 cup flour came out with smooth batter.  I also added sugar to the mixture.  Comes out so good it doesn't need anything.  My 5 year old loves it better then pancakes, ask for it every morning.

Amazing recipe.  To babygirl you asked what you did wrong and it was very clear from your review "well oiled pan"  when the recipe says lightly grease and they truly mean LIGHTLY.  To make these perfect you put some butter in the pan warm it and spread it around and then with a paper towel  wipe most of the butter out.  It is even better if you just use a brand new non stick pan with NO OIL Or  butter.   Making crapes is a technique more than a recipe.  I also agree all the wet ingredients should be mixed first and then the flour added but the base ingredients are perfect.

Very easy to make and came out perfect on the 1st try. Soft and slightly crispy. I followed the same technique as others and prepared the wet ingredients first, but made a lil mistake by not melting the butter all the way, so when it was added to the other ingredients (still cold) it curdled up -- my fault. After adding the flour and all was still lumpy, I threw in the blender on low and it fixed the issue. That made the batter easy to pour into the hot pan, an added bonus. I also added vanilla and less than 1/4 cup of sugar for a sweet taste. My husband enjoyed this for Father's Day breakfast, served with sauteed apples and banana/nutella. Def a nice change v the same old pancakes or french toast. Thanks for the recipe!

I rarely cook in my home and decided to do this as a surprise for my husband for Father's Day.  It was both easy and delicious!  I did combine the wet ingredients first and I did add vanilla which I had read about from other reviews.  They came out great!  Both my husband and picky son were pleased!  I would make these again in a heartbeat!

I cannot believe I just made crepes & they were out of this world!! I really have nothing to base these on never having the opportunity to travel to France, however, my husband has been to France multiple times while in the military and said these crepes brought him back to a little cafe in Paris. Aside from adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla I followed the recipe exactly and even watched the video. I found a hot pan and measuring out the batter is key to a perfect crepe. Definitely making these again as my kids (ages 6,4 &1) ate 3 each. Delicious!!

This is a great recipe! I made two batches: one following the recipe, and also a gluten free version. They both turned out really well. (For the gluten free version, I just substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour for the regular flour and did everything else the same. The batter was slightly thicker than the regular version, but worked fine.) Everyone loved these!

Followed the instructions and landed up with lumpy batter. Had to blend it with my stick blender to remove the lumps. Worked perfectly after that! Would recommend mixing the eggs and milk, then adding to the dry ingredients and whisking, as you'd normally do.

This batter was way too thick to spread and make a thin, even crepes, and is so disgusting I used more sugary toppings to not have to taste it, but I ended up throwing it away.

This is a pancake recipe! Crepe batter is supposed to have much more fluidity. Add two more eggs to the batter to fix this. That way you get a pliable true to life crepe instead of a thick rubbery pancake!

As far as ease and flavor, excellent.

I agree with the many other reviewers in saying the directions need to be modified. Blend the wet ingredients, then sift in the dry ingredients.

Good basic recipe. The first time I made it, they came out great because I just skimmed over everything.. The second time, I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they came out pretty bad. Here's what I learned...skip whisking the eggs with the flour. And just do wet ingredients into dry ingredients, then whisk. And then also don't do medium-high heat. The highest heat you should use is medium.

If you make it exactly as directed, you will have large lumps that are virtually unusable. The recipe should state that the milk, eggs and the butter should be at room temperature. Melting the butter and using cold milk, eggs and water will cause everything to seize up.

Followed directions, batter was lumpy. Had to throw it out. Made it again, wet ingredients 1st, then flour! I added some sugar. Crepes turned out thick, had to press out large bubbles. Kids still liked them though.

These are great! My family gobbled them up and I had to quickly whip up another batch which they also gobbled up. The only thing I would change is the technique, whisking the eggs and flour together just produces a gloppy blob that gets hung up inside the whisk.  When I made the second batch, I  whisked the eggs, liquids and flour together, adding the butter and salt last. You really need to get western with the whisk to break up all the flour clumps, though!  Next time I might just throw it all in a blender. We served ours with ham, mayo, even anchovies, which sounds crazy but is delicious.  For the sweet side, we did different combos of sliced strawberries, peaches, honey, and Nutella.

Very simple to make & what's great is that most of the ingredients I already have in my pantry/fridge.  My family loved them!  Can be used for sweet or savory fillings.

**Just a warning**  I decided to try this method and followed the directions to the letter and "whisked" the flour and egg first.  I ended up with a full on ball of dough in my KitchenAide that ruined my whisk.  I made a quadruple batch so--that was the end of that whisk blade!  Haha-lesson learned!  Learn from me people!  
Otherwise the recipe is great :)

I like my crepes a little eggy so I added one more egg and just a bit of sugar because I've got a sweet tooth. I love eating them with butter sugar and cinnamon on them. It's delicious.

Had enough batter for my whole family for breakfast and some of the family had for lunch. Breakfast we topped it with powdered sugar and berries. Lunch we topped it with cheddar cheese and Canadian bacon. Both were amazing and so easy to make. ??

I used this recipe for my Easter morning crepes and they were delicious.  The only change I made was that I used the water from canned peaches instead of plain water ( my mom used to do this to add a little sweetness to the batter ) then used the fruit as a side dish.  I also think that this basic recipe would lend itself well to making a savoury crepe dish!  I will keep this recipe as I'm sure I will use it again and again

Recipe is a breeze. I recommend using a 10" skillet and cooking spray. Makes titling the pan easier for distributing the batter.
I made roasted sweet pepper and pulled pork crepes with bechamel sauce, and two ricotta crepes with lemon zest for dessert. Perfecto!

I made these for a shower this weekend. Used the crepe with a pudding based mousse filling, topped it with a fruit syrup and fresh strawberries and used it as a dessert instead of the usual cake option. It added an easy and yet sophisticated flair to an event being held in a school cafeteria. Everyone loved it ... even my meat and potatoes only brother who came afterward to help with clean up.

Easy to make turned out lovely. I just added sugar to make them dessert crepes. Filled them with cottage cheese with sugar/cinnamon and some berries they were delicious.

Great recipe but it definitely needed a few changes. I added 1/3 cup of sugar, used one cup of milk instead of a half cup of milk and half cup of water and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Makes 2 crepes.

I found this needs double the water indicated in order for the mixture to be workable and runny enough.  Also I recommend adding mineral (carbonated) water - they turn much fluffier.

This is a great basic crepes recipe. I use it all the time. I make it in my vitamin so there are no lumps adding in the flour last. I add in a little more milk, a tad of vanilla extract and a squeeze of agave nectar. Gives the crepe some character.

Love using this recipe as I can never remember the quantities myself. I use 1cup of milk, just 1/2cup water and no butter. I prefer the way they come out (more like mums!) and I find it easier not having to worry about another ingredient.
I do whisk the flour and eggs first, but making sure it's mixed very well and then add in the wet ingredients very slowly. If you mix enough, the lumps will (usually) come out.

I halved this recipe for a quick lunch and it was perfect. They would work for sweet or savory crepes. I had smoked salmon, avocado, a little red onion, capers and cream cheese on these babies and it was delicious. Definitely recommend this recipe!

I’ve been using the s wonderful recipe for years to make blintzes and crepes.  These are the changes I use:  1- I cut the amount of melted butter by half in the batter and the remaining butter between each crepe in the frying pan.  2- Strain the milk, water, flour combo prior to adding the eggs. 3-enjoy the kudos!!!

Just what i needed.  I cut the recipe in half because it is just me but it came out great.  Added a little bit more water because I couldn't spread them out enough but they taste amazing.

I had no idea what crepes were before making this recipe, and now I will probably end up making crepes all the time! This recipe was super easy to make (although I just threw all the ingredients in at the same time, and made the crepes on an electric griddle, which probably helped - what can you do?), but they're almost too bland for my taste, even with fillings. Will definetly experiment with putting different spices in with the batter!

I just add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. It gives it a nice taste, and when you are making cottage cheese filling, vanilla is used in that as well. Try the cottage cheese filled crepes with a cinnamon whipped cream topping! If you've never tried it, I'm sure it will become a favourite with the whole family! Good eating, Steve.

This is a great recipe that's way easier to make than other methods I've tried. 
Most of the stuff should already be in your kitchen. 
I followed other commenters' advice (and common sense) and mixed the wets together and the dries together before combining, turned out great!
I'll definitely be making these again.

Perfect! I have been making these for breakfast with Nutella and strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar. My teenage son loves them! Also, the leftover batter saves perfectly in the fridge for the next day.

I adore this recipe. It's simple and easy to make, not to mention it turns out beautifully! I solved the lumpy batter problem by simply whisking with a little fervor :) What makes this recipe even better is the fact that it's relatively quick, which allows me to make it in the mornings before school.

I love love crepes, especially when someone else makes them! Unfortunately my favorite crepe maker didn't have any combos I liked the other week when I had a major hankering for crepes. I finally decided to make my own, then decided we needed to make sure we had the best possible recipe. Over two days I tried three or four batter recipes, this was the favorite! We tried them with three fillings
 1. Baby spinach, sliced tomatoes and feta, 
2. Grilled kielbasa and sauerkraut,
3. Cream cheese, whipped cream and sugar filling with a cinnamon sugar drizzle. 
All three tasted amazing with this batter, no changes needed!

This is an amazing recipe,but you need to whisk the wet ingredients first the add the dry ingredients. It when really well with a merengue and homemade strawberry blueberry reduction.

Simple and delicious. A few critical adjustments make this batter much easier to whisk. Whisk all the wet ingredients and salt together. (I added sugar and vanilla.) Stir in the flour gradually. This is standard practice for pancakes and French toast. First the wet ingredients, then the flour or bread. Once the crepes were made, I added a cream cheese filling and blueberry syrup. So good!

(Note: By mixing the flour and eggs first, you create a rustic dough that then has to be transformed into a batter. It's very difficult to get all the lumps out.)

Added 3Tbsp table sugar as I prefer mine sweet. Prepared it the night before so it will be a breeze preparing my Saturday breakfast. Turned out PERFECT!!! Had some lingonberry jam to go with it! Definitely a keeper!

I mixed the room temperature eggs, milk and water in a blender and added the flour. As it was blending I slowly added the melted butter. Perfect consistency with no lumps of cold butter! And it was great to pour from the blender. I typically double this for dinner sized portions for my family...of 4 boys.

I added 1 tablespoon of sugar to give the crepes a little more sweetness. I liked the recipe, but the batter was a little lumpy even though I beat it for a while. Although they look bumpy, you can't taste the small clumps while you are eating them.

Good, but definitely don't whisk the eggs and flour first. I just mixed wet and then added dry and it turned out great. We always end up doubling it!

Perfect consistency and texture! Only thing: My mix got a bit lumpy. Might be because of the way I mixed the ingredients, though I tried sticking to the instructions. I think one should really mix well while adding the water and milk, to avoid getting lumps.

Made a few changes:


1)  Used 1/2 c. sparkling water (I used a can of coconut flavored sparkling water because it's not pina colada season anymore, and I was tired of looking at it) instead of 1/2 c. water.  Added this to wet mixture and stirred with spoon instead of mixer.  
2)  Used 1 egg instead of 2 (I'm not a big fan of egg-y tasting cakes, crepes, or other sweet treats).  The carbonation from the sparkling water made up for the lack of the extra egg (I think you could substitute baking powder for the 2nd egg as well - I've seen egg-less recipes use 1 tsp. baking powder for 1 egg).
3)  Added 1-2Tbsp. sugar (added a little more sugar after the first batch).  Added the sugar to the wet ingredients and mixed.
4)  Mixed all wet ingredients first (beat 1 egg, then added milk, melted butter, and sugar and beat again).  Added 1/2 c. sparkling water and mixed with spoon.
5)  Added salt/flour mixture and mixed with spoon followed by beating with a mixer.
6)  Cooked in an iron skillet coated with a thin layer of butter.
7)  Served with the apple mix recommended by another reviewer (fry one finely cut apple in butter in a skillet adding ~1Tbsp. sugar.  Toss with cinnamon and nutmeg if desired - I added the rest of the can of sparkling water to the apple mixture while cooking to make a little more apple gravy).

I didn't change anything, but I did listen to one reviewer as to how to mix it.   Wet ingredients all together then add to the dry. I used a small 10 inch nonstick frying pan.  I didn't change anything but I added fresh and frozen heated raspberries to the inside and outside, topped with powdered sugar and a dollop of sour cream. Delicious!!!

The "whisk flour and eggs together" scared me, so I whisked wet ingredients first.  This recipe doesn't add as much milk as I'm used to, making the batter a bit thicker.  But, it didn't ruin it by any means.  Still tasted delicious!  But, if you want a thinner batter, add another 1/2 cup milk or so.

My go-to crepe recipe. Very quick, easy, and delicious. It's great for those times when you're just staring into your pantry with no idea what you want to eat. All the ingredients are right there, and you can adapt it for whatever craving you are having (sweet, savory, chocolatey, cheesy). My lazy fillings are jam and powdered sugar (sometimes I add Nutella) for sweet; Canadian bacon and cheddar cheese (and broccoli, if I have a Steamfresh bag in my freezer) for savory.

Side note: The first time I made these for my father-in-law he said they reminded him of the ones his [Dutch] mother used to make. My mother-in-law said she swore she saw tears in his eyes! :-D

Great recipe. It doesn't matter in what order you mix the ingredients if you have a good blender. I use an immersion blender for both crepes and Dutch pancakes and never have lumps. The only modification I make to this is that I add about 3Tbs of sugar for sweet crepes. Leave it out for savory. Consistency is perfect and these are super easy!

I followed the suggestion I read in the other reviews to add the flour last and I also  omitted the salt and this recipe is amazing!!! I don't actually like crepes at all but I've been making them every morning for my boyfriend for at least 8 days in a row and he LOVES them! And he has really high standards for everything. He said morning crepes are his new favorite thing.  It's also just so easy and quick that I've been really enjoying making them in the morning because I don't even have to get up that much earlier than usual.  DEFINITELY 100000% recommend this recipe. Made an account on here just to write this review.

I've seen a few reviews concerning lumps. Something you need to know about making crepes. First, use a whisk to incorporate the ingredients. When you mix the eggs and flour it will be lumpy.  I've found the best way is to only add a bit of the flour to the eggs and whisk them. Then alternate the liquid and flour, whisking until smooth. Second...make it the day before, cover the batter and refrigerate. This allows the batter to settle and get the bubbles out. Then, when ready to cook, give a quick stir and pour the batter about a 1/4 of a cup at a time onto your pan that's been heated over medium/high. Tilt the pan to spread out the batter and cook until golden brown, flip and cook the other side. Place on plate, serve with fruit, jam, etc. and enjoy!

I've never made crepes before, this was a nice and easy recipe for beginners! I added 1-1/2 tablespoon of sugar to the batter to make it a little sweeter, but since I didn't make the original batter first, I'm not exactly sure if that made a difference or if it was just in my head, haha. Sifting the dry ingredients into the wet is generally much easier than the other way around, and that really helped here.

I made these for the first time week and they were phenomenal! Almost like the ones I had in France. For the filling, I mixed together raspberry preserves, strawberry preserves, and cool whip. For the topping, I drizzled the mixed preserves, a couple of strawberry halves, and topped with powdered sugar-sifted. My fiance loved them!

Easy to follow recipe with satisfactory results. I took someone's advice and added the flour last, after mixing the wet ingredients. No lumps at all. I also added a little extra flour because the dough was a tad runny. The dough will make 2 large crepes or 4 smaller ones. The directions said 'medium high' heat. Every stove I've ever used has numbers on the dials, and 'medium high' could mean different things. I cooked my crepes on about '4' and they turned out fine. Anything higher than that, and they got too hot. Also, don't forget to re-grease your pan inbetween crepes so they don't stick (unless you have a non-stick pan; I do, but I still grease it just in case.) Overall, very pleased with the results. Will definitely cook them again in the future.

Add: I have only made this recipe once, but every time I refresh the page it will say 'You did it!' and adds another time I 'made it'. I click undo, but it doesn't undo it. It now says I've made this several times, which is an error.

Awesome, everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe to feed three adults and one child and had 3 extra, in case you were wondering about the serving size. I did mix dry ingredients seperate from wet, then combined. Topped with sliced strawberries and bananas, a lil drizzle of honey...divine!

Use a blender. Start with wet ingredients. No lumps, easy pour.
Double the batch for four adults or more. Run two pans to get it done quick..

Very easy recipe.  I made it two different ways.  I first followed the directions.  The second time I put the wet ingredients in a blender and blended.  Then added the dry, blended, scraped down, blended a second time, and liked the results a great deal more.

Easy crepes!!!  Great taste!

I use this recipe every time I make crepes, except I add vanilla. Sometimes I use pineapple juice instead of water and coconut milk instead of cow milk to make them really tropical.

Excellent recipe. Honors the true French tradition. Make exactly as stated. I used a stainless steel fry pan sprayed with a light coating of Pam before each crêpe is made.

I have made this recipe as written (whisking eggs with flour) and my own way (whisking eggs with milk, then adding sifted flour). As written the batter was horrible - the eggs and flour turned into a doughy paste and after adding milk and water it thinned but I couldn't get the lumps out. I whisked for several minutes and eventually dumped it and started over. I therefore can't review on taste for this recipe based on the instructions.

I have made this several times my way, however, with excellent results - smooth batter and all. 

I like this recipe and I make it often. I strongly recommend  whisking the eggs and milk together prior to adding (sifted) flour. I gave this three stars because it's great when directions are tweaked but not as written.

The batter was too thick so i had to add more liquid.  When I cooked them I found that they were the same consistency as pancakes even though I spread them as thinly over the pan as possible. I discovered it better to use a smaller pan to achieve a crepe consistency. They were very tasty though and the kids ate them all up so maybe I'll try them again.

First time making crepes and the family was thrilled with how they turned out! I made a strawberry version, blueberry version and a chocolate chip/strawberry version. I don't like my food too sweet but I have to say that the chocolate adds a nice touch. The husband said the crepes could be a little thinner next time which I will try adding a little water based on another review that said the same thing. So happy these turned out!

Wow!   That's all I can say.  I followed the recipe exactly, and these crepes were perfect.  They tasted like the crepes we had all over France, and they were so simple to make.  I had always been afraid to make crepes, thinking they were too finicky, but this recipe proved that anyone can make delicious crepes.  I filled some with Nutella, some with lemon curd, and some with fresh gooseberries.  They all received a light dusting of confectioner's sugar, and they were all happily consumed by young and old.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

I make these all the time, for breakfast, dinner or dessert.   I find the servings is a little low however, I usually double the recipe.  We like to have them with nutella/peanut butter and just about any fruit.   It's also my go to food when the fruit looks like it only has another day so we can use it up, our 3 year old loves them too.

Super easy and effective. I used this recipe to learn how to make crepes and have since only every used this recipe. I make this about twice a month on Sundays. I add a little vanilla to the batter if we'll be having them sweet. For savory you can leave plain or add some herbs. I really recommend this recipe! Sometimes I have to add a little extra water to the batter. Just depends. I would also recommend using a specific crepe pan to make crepes, much easier. Enjoy your crepes!

These were great crepes! I did have to thin out my batter; I added about 1/4 c. water when all was said and done. Other than that, the recipe was great! I will definitely make these again.

I used a handheld blender for this, and it was very helpful from the go. There were a few, very few lumps, and i got rid of them by straining the batter. Great proportions, they turned out wonderful.

It would have been fine if it didn't tell me to combine the flour and egg first... Also, it would have been very plain if I didn't add sugar and vanilla extract.

I really like the simplicity of this recipe and use it all the time.

There are couple of things I like to add which makes them even better:
A little vanilla and cinnamon

And I usually split the batch up and add a banana to one of the batches. REALLY great!!

Then today I substituted while wheat flour for regular flour. Much to our pleasure, they still tasted great!

This recipe was a HUGE hit! I substituted oat flour for all purpose flour and it still turned out amazing. I used this recipe for my savory crepes (stuffing them with scrambled eggs n cheese), then modified it with a little bit of vanilla extract (1tsp) and sugar (1tsp) to make some sweet crepes. Very simple recipe, and does not take long at all - this has become a weekend regular in my home!

Silly me made the mistake of NOT reading the comments before starting out... And ended up with clumpy batter and a sore arm. 

Add dry to wet instead of the other way around... Wish the recipe would be updated to correct this part, otherwise it's perfect!

Made them with different flour. Really good with honey or agave syrup on them.  I don't like to use a lot of oil so this hit the spot.

Delicious!  I put all the ingredients into a blender and it came out beautifully.  Changes I made: whole grain sprouted flour, 1/4 cup extra milk, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 T. sugar, and cooked each crepe in a pat of butter.

This recipe is amazing. I recommend making these on a hot surface and using vegetable oil before you place the batter. After slightly cooled, you can top with Nutella and strawberries.

I used only ¼  cup of water because the batter didn’t seem very thick after adding the milk (will be good to exercise your own judgement here). 

Because I was using a manual whisk, i was unable to achieve 100% smooth texture for my batter, although it looked homogenous on the surface. I had to transfer the batter into another bowl, through a sift, to seperate the lumps which were sunken at the bottom of the batter.

Overall the recipe's great and I am really satisfied with the crepes i made this morning : )

Great basic recipe! If people are finding the batter lumpy by following the instructions, what I do is whisk the eggs, butter and salt first, and then add the flour and milk in alternating steps a few tablespoons at a time. That way it also helps to gauge how thick you prefer the crepe batter.

I made mine with 1% milk and they were GREAT!! I'm definitely making these again! (Just make sure to grease the pan really well and again after each crepe so they doesn't stick) I served mine with powdered sugar... Any suggestions on other fillings/ toppings?

I signed up specifically to review this. Do not mix the flour and eggs in the beginning. Add all ingredients then mix. I didn't do it but I know mixing just eggs and flour makes noodles. Also I added a tiny bit more milk as well as a handful of sugar and a cap of vanilla just because I thought it would taste better. Turned out perfect! Good base recipe but needs a little embellishment

I mixed the flour and eggs as directed and ended up with a VERY lumpy batter. I won't be making this again.

Perfect recipe, the best I have ever found.  When it says to mix in the wet ingredients, be sure to form a small well in the middle of the dry ingredients with your fist and fingers, then gently place the egg and milk inside the well.  Then, place the head of your mixer into the well and start blending from the inside out!  That prevents lumps and also the pain of sifting in flower like other people suggested.  Also, for the person who said it turned into scrambled eggs, do not scramble the crepe!  Just let it be and it will turn into what you want it to in two to four mins.

It's very good but the recipe told me to start of with the dry ingredients and I couldn't use the blender to mix all those bumps but, I just mixed it normally a lot and it turns out very well! :)

Amazing recipe!!! I make this all the time for my kids. I do agree that if you mix the eggs and flour together it becomes really clumpy. Like the ratings below I also just mix the wet ingredients together first. But such a minor detail for such a great recipe

Super easy and delicious. This recipe is a no brainer. Served it with a berry mixture and sweetened ricotta for a Sunday breakfast. I will freeze the extras and use them for other meals ,like possibly a beef filling. One change I did use was I had some leftover half and half and used that instead for the liquid.

So easy!!! I accidentally added everything but the butter... Whisked it and added the butter, they were still great. I added Nutella and strawberries to mine then topped w whipped creme. My daughter said "wow you're a pro and you just learned this." I let her make one too.  I recommend garnishing with a glass of champagne, lol! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent, excellent!! The crepes came out perfect. I doubled the ingredients, it made 10 large crepes (1/4 cup + 1/8 cup of batter per crepe). It was difficult mixing the ingredients, so I tossed everything in the Vitamix. Medium heat was correct. Excellent!

I followed the directions in one of the comments and mixed all of the wet ingredients including the butter before sifting in the flour.  The finished product was a great tasting crepe with a nice texture.  There is nothing I would change aside from the mixing sequence.

I actually made a crepe cake with these. They were really good but I could most definitely do without the salt. I generally don't use salt when I cook and I started not using it for health purposes. Unfortunately when I do eat something thats cooked with salt, I am really sensitive to it and even the slightest bit of salt makes things taste  weird to me. Never the less this recipe was good. Soft, cooked well and had a good color.

I made a half recipe, since I was making some just for me. I did the dry ingredients in one bowl, wet in another, and added a little sugar, vanilla and a dash of spices. I also ended up adding a little water, since I found this recipe a smidge thick and hard to move in the pan. Other than that, good recipe!

Easy and delicious. My family loved them. I followed Adam M suggestions: started with dry ingredients including 1/3 c. sugar, then added eggs, melted butter then milk and water mixture (added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla so took out 1/4 t. water). Used my non-stick pan and it worked like a charm.

I thought the recipe was very good.  The only thing I did differently was that I used Wondra flour  instead of regular flour.  That totally eliminated the lumps.

I agree others to whisk in sifted flour at end. Likely, a regular item in recipe box.

Loved this recipe!!! I make it all the time for breakfast, special occasions and it works for basically everything! One thing that I like to do, is that I usually put a few drops of vanilla, which  gives it a nice flavor.

Just start with wet then add dry. Otherwise the batter with be clumpy and unusable. But this is an amazing recipe because you can make it in 5 minutes. I also add a tsp of vanilla to make it sweeter, and don't oil the pan, butter it.

Easy to make and so delicious!
I followed other reviewer's advice and mixed the wet ingredients first and then sifted in the flour.
I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 tbs of sugar.
Spread some nutella over it and top it with strawberries and you have yourself a wonderful dessert.

This is a great basic recipe but I made a lot of changes. 
I also ran into the problem of  clumps of flour. Instead of mixing the flour with the eggs I beat my eggs and then alternate adding a bit of milk and a bit of flour. I also don't like using half water half milk so I add just a cup of milk. When making a dessert crepe I also use sugar instead of salt. I've made these for my french class and for my family and every time they are a hit.

I haven't made these since cooking class in high school. Quick and easy recipe. They tasted great with some mixed berries, bananas, whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Even two picky 13 year olds loved them.

I also add in the dry at the end (mixes better that way), I add a tsp of sugar, and use only milk leaving the water out. Turned out much nicer this way. I have a crepe pan, so have not tried them in any other pan, but with the changes I felt it a perfect recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I thought that the batter comes out really well if you whisk it in a food processor/ blender. I added a bit of vanilla extract and they taste and smell delicious. Definitely would recommend
the only reason i rated 4 stars is because the quantity of the batter is not enough for a bigger family so i think you should update the instructions for 8 servings but that is the only thing. I absolutely loved this recipe and will definitely use it again.

Best crepe recipe I have. Batter comes together in 20 minutes and as long as you don't let the batter stand and separate, or grease the pan too much, they come out near perfect. Lots of potential for other flavoring too.

Maybe your pan wasn't hot enough.  It has to be screaming hot at first, then you can turn it down.  The first one or two don't come out for me, usually.  It takes some practice.

I have made these two different ways now, Once i used rice milk one cup of it and coconut butter two table spoons of it and added one table spoon of cinnamon these were for my mom who cant have milk or butter and everyone ate them up and loved them, the second time i made them i added a cup of milk "cows milk"  (no water each time) and the same ratios for the rest with real butter  and i used a food processor to blend the wet first and then slowly added the dry. I did add three teaspoons of vanilla extract it made it have a delicious perfumed smell when cooking. I put nuttella and bananas nuttella and raspberry and sweet cream cheese and a mix berry jam in BOTH kinds and they were a hit with the family! ( everyone is very very picky)  

MY recommendations: add all milk and not water and keeping the rest the same and MIX THE WET STUFF FIRST SLOWLY ADD THE POWDER SO IT DOESNT GET CLUMPY 
and enjoy!!

Great recipe, but I had lumpy batter too, I also will be doing the reverse or putting it in blender to see if that helps. Making this again for myself for Monday Night. I plan on making batter on Sunday and they using it on Monday, hope that is ok.

If you've never had crepes and think they are breakfast tacos this recipe is fantastic. Otherwise, too bready. Needs sugar to offset the salt. The batter is too thick for crepes. It's a good thing I saw that other people added water before I cooked them all. Even then, still didn't taste right.

Love, love, love this recipe!  Very simple to make,  and very tasty.  I usually use whole wheat flour instead of regular. I only have trouble making them thinner,  but I've never had any complaints. By far, the easiest crepes recipe I've ever tried.

Very easy to make.  Make sure you mix the eggs first slightly, mix the flour first slightly, then combine the flour to the egg and follow the rest of the instructions.  I added a hint of vanilla and this was delicious with almond cocoa spread and strawberry preserves.  NOM NOM NOM...

Delicious! My family loves them! As many suggested, I mixed the liquids first then the solids. I always add brown sugar (the amount depends on how much of a sweet tooth I have) to make them naturally sweet and I'll eat them plain.

I have made this recipe twice in the past week and the batter came out better the first time, lumpy the next time - but it didn't affect the taste. It's important that the ingredients are room temperature to avoid lumpiness. The savory ones included: sautéed leeks sautéed with olive oil and garlice, asparagus steamed sautéed , mushrooms sautéed red wine, red pepper raw, goat cheese and chicken sausage - Delish. The sweet one was Nutella and banana. So good we ate it for dinner last week and brunch today.

This recipe is good all I would recommend is to mix wet ingredients first in a blender, then add the flour, blend it again until mixed, and then add the butter last. Let it set for 5 minutes. This will save you from a lumpy batter. Pour it with a measuring cup (1/4 cup at a time). The recipe will yield exactly 8. Just practice a bit. Make sure your pan is hot. Sprinkle some water drops if they sizzle your pan is ready for making them!

Will definitely make again and again. 
Adjustments: I kept the ingredients as is but changed method. I put all ingredients into my bullet, whizzed and let stand at room temperature for 10 mins while I prepared the filling. I dolled this method as per Martha Stewart recipe (her ingredients/measures were different). Turned out light, no lumps, not eggy and delicious. I like that there is no sugar in recipe and you can add it when done, if necessary.

This was SO SO SO easy, a few pointers: Don't oil the pan, butter it. It spread the crepe easier and give them the traditional buttery smooth flavour.  Also, I add a little bit of vanilla extract, sugar and  a sprinkle of cinnamon but this is because i like sweet breakfast crepes!

I love that this is a base recipe that is wonderful as is but also because it is so versatile with only a few adaptations.  The comments are worth reading - especially to mix all wet into all dry a little at a time, rather than as stated.  The adaptations and pairings also make it worth reading. There's even a history lesson! Awesome experiences shared! Oh-note about scrambled eggs - don't use well-oiled pan!

Followed others advice and whisked the liquids with the eggs and slowly whisked in flour. I made them savory with the addition of black pepper and stuffed with a spinach, mushroom, cottage cheese filling.

I love this really easy and quick recipe. I put eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt into a blender or magic bullet. I usually skip the butter, since sometimes I like to fill my crepes with butter and creme. usually it's bacon and condensed milk, or maple syrup with a squeeze from a lemon wedge. I might try adding a little matcha to the batter and make a mille crepe.

This recipe has all the ingredients right, but the technique is wrong. Combine the eggs, milk and water. Add the cooled, melted butter. Sift in the flour and salt while whisking.  Once the batter is smooth it is ready to cook.

Great, easy, and quick recipe. One thing I would add to the batter is a little bit of powdered sugar so it is sweater. Otherwise, the crepes turned were delicious!!!

These were easy and great.  You can add sugar or anything else you want them for dessert purposes.  For all those that said their batter was lumpy... that is your error.  Go slowly and follow directions.  Also, I read from someone that you do not combine eggs and flour together in that order.  Well, if she really knew how to cook/bake she would know that you absolutely do in certain recipes, such as this. I will not give a lesson on baking here.. but the reason for this method is easily googled.

I made them for breakfast today and they are very good.   I made the crepes one by one and stacked them between wax paper.  Then I filled each one with a TBS of softened Cream Cheese and some Homemade Blueberry filling (Frozen Blueberries, Splenda, CornStarch)  Yum.  Served them with a small tsp of Sour Cream on each one.  If I made them again I would definitely measure each crepe in stead of just pouring the batter into the skillet.  It looks easy but measure.  Also I did what other posters said and added the dry to the wet and was successful in no lumps.    I used a spray on the pan for the first one.  I think using butter would make a browner, crisper crepe.  Good, Easy recipe.

This was a great recipe that I have tried twice. The only thing I did differently was mix my fluids in a bowl then pore in my flour. A bit time consuming but worth it! Thanks for great recipe!

This is the best crepe recipe ever! I mixed the egg, water, melted butter, and salt and then while whisking briskly sprinkled in small amounts of flour. No lumps and crepe were light and tasted perfect!

So yummy!  First time... Followed advice of others in mixing wet and dry ingredients separately and then adding the dry to the wet. . Also added 1/2 Tbs sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla and maybe 1/8 cup more water.  Used a mixer to blend. Next time I will also double recipe for my family of 4.  This one yielded 8 crepes using 1/4 of Batter for each.

Made these crepes.  Absolutely delicious.  I followed instructions from other reviews and added the flour last.  I added some sugar and powdered sugar to the mixture as well.  I also made the apple mixture to put inside the crepes.   All of it was delicious.

These were tasty. The only problem I had was that they were lumpy. I should have read the reviews before making them and could have saved a whole batch. I was just making it for myself and 1/2 the second bath I made and it made getting the right size difficult because of the minimal amount of batter. I definitely recommend making a full batch to achieve the large size. I will definitely try this again but mixing the liquids first.

These crepes were like tortillas and my kids didn't want to eat them,  even with powdered sugar. They locked the bubbles the soft elasticity, and had no flavor. I would not recommend this recipe at all.

These are amazing! I haven't had any like these since my French class in high school! Don't just limit yourself to stuffing these for dessert.  Use them for dinner and breakfast too! The only thing I recommend is combining all wet ingredients before adding the flour, to prevent clumps, like every other recipe I have ever used.

This is a very good basic crepe recipe. As others, I did not do the flour and eggs combo, I stuck to the tried and true wet  ingredient-dry ingredient mixture, and they have turned out great each time. My 10 year old daughter makes these too, and they always turn out well for her too!

needs more water for thin crepe. added 1 package of vanillin sugar and a bit of fresh vanilla bean.  also NO oil in the pan. Crepes are made always without any oil . You dont want a pancake but crispy, thin one like in France !

This is a great, simple recipe. You can add whatever you want. I added some whipped cream cheese, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. It was then topped off with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled with some powdered sugar. The whole family loved it.

With the right gluten free flour mix (I use Bobs Redmill), this recipe can become a great gluten free option. 
We make it both ways and love them both.

Super easy and delicious recipe - Kids and myself loved them.  I added wet ingredients to dry mixing with whisk, slowly incorporating the dry - No lumps and super smooth:)  I also made the apple cinnamon mixture for middle and powdered sugar on top..

I love crepes, have had them all over the world, but I have to tell you, the best I have ever had were made by my husband, the huge secret?  He uses half white flour & half wheat flour, this makes a huge difference in flavor, makes them have a less generic taste.  It also makes for a better savory crepe instead of the overly sweet crepe.  Try it, you will love it!  :)

I always use this recipe - it's good for the quantities. However, do not follow the instructions. Mix milk, water, and beaten egg first, then whisk in flour. Otherwise, as Morley has pointed out, it will be exceptionally lumpy and almost unsalvageable.

The one change I make to this recipe is with the water. Instead of using 1/2cup water I use a 1/4cup water and 1/4cup orange juice.  We fill with sweet cream..sour cream, whipped cream cheese and powder sugar to sweeten. Strawberries on top and whip cream. 
I also learned to use 1/2 a soup ladle into the pan. You want these thin because you don't turn them. Slide out of pan when top has a firm look.

Great universal recipe for non sweet foods. So many things you can use this with. The only thing I chanel was to add a little bit more milk to make the crepe the traditional thin I am used to.

i was a little intimidated about making crepes, but this recipe was so easy and they turned out great.  I recommend using a ceramic non stick pan.  I also coated mine with baker's joy for the extra insurance

I got a crepe pan for my birthday and was looking around for a good recipe. I decided to try this and none have compared since. I normally make a huge batch and the battereyg stays together really well, just make sure to whisk it a bunch because sometimes lumps can hide within the batter (doesn't take away from the end product though)

Instead of water I used cooled earl grey tea - it gave the crepes a different colour and added a different flavour to them. I had to add in additional liquid to get it to the correct consistency.

It was very easy.  I used a regular frying pan which worked great.  You do not have to spend money on a special crepe pan.  The batter was tasty.  I added ham and swiss cheese.  My son enjoyed it also.  Yes, I will definitely make it again and try different fillings.

This recipe is always my go-to crepe recipe! Although I did change one thing, I mix together all of my wet ingredients then mix it in with the dry because if you're going to mix the flour with the eggs first it WILL get lumpy so you should just do what I did.. :) They turn out fantastic every time!!

Well I did a slight variation, I did it with 1 1/4 cups flour, 3 eggs and 2/3 cup chicken broth. When I made them growing up in High School in Culinary Arts. I remember them being somewhat more, watery, for lack there of a better word, and having been more egg based  well. So this is my first adaptation after a while. But I am sure I will find something closer to what I remember, that just has the thickness and fluffiness that it truly should. I myself have always been partial to more savory these days and have always liked more savory crepes too. I usually tend to add about a tsp of Garlic powder, Marjoram, Tarragon and Dalmatian Sage, and I never use regular salt, prefer using celery salt for the flavor. A sea salt and celery seed grinder would be perfect..!! Pretty basic though, anybody can always tweek something to make it there own.. Don't be afraid to experiment :)!

I made it in the blender. I needed a tad more liquid and more blending of the flour. I hadn't read reviews and haven't been cooking with dairy. I usually consider crepe #1 to be the test one. With the liquid, water, and flour better incorporated, the second one was better. I made half of the recipe in a very nice, nonstick crepe pan spayed with vegetable oil. I served with powdered sugar and blueberries. Were I to make them again, I'd make sure to blend the flour better, maybe sifting as suggested above, and experiment with two tbls rather than 1/4th cup for the first crepe. I almost made them at midnight to rest overnight and might do that. But, in any case, I'll let the batter rest, as suggested, for 20 min. I'll still use the blender for ease of making, pouring, and clean up. This recipe is the traditional one, and I'm glad it's readily available.

I really like this recipe! It's just enough for 2 or 3 people (it makes about 5 to 6 crepes depending on the size of the pan). I made my personal modifications to this recipe. I use 1 cup of milk instead of half milk and half water, they turn out much tastier. I also reduced amount of flour a little (a little less than a cup), because my batter was thicker than I usually like for my crepes. I also added 1tsp of vanilla extract. The secret of making a good crepe is not to grease the pan too much, but just a little bit. Also, use non-stick pan so that crepes don't stick to the pan. I also changed the process of mixing it. I start with beaten egg, I add warm milk, melted butter, salt and vanilla extract and at the very end I gradually add the flour. It mixes a lot faster and easier than it's described in this recipe.

These worked great! At first I was not sure as starting out trying to whisk 2 eggs into a cup of flour makes a nasty paste that gets totally gummed up in the whisk...but keep going and it all works out!

Amazing! I live with a bunch of french girls so I just assumed mine wouldn't turn out like their but they did! Better even! They were smooth, delicious, easy, and perfectly held together without being thick. Next time i might add a pinch of sugar for sweet crepes.

I use this recipe simply for ease, but I would be open to trying a better one for two reasons:
1. I can't figure out why you would whisk the flour and eggs first. This makes a dough, which then becomes impossible lumps when you add the liquid.
2. I usually have to add more liquid (I kind of eyeball it) to get the consistency that's right for spreading the batter around the pan.

Super yummy and super easy. This is my third time making them and I think I might try adding milk and water first, THEN the egg next time, just because there are a couple lumps.

Pretty good and basic recipe, I added an extra 1/4 tsp salt and substited oil for the butter since I find melted butter causes problems when the rest of the ingredients are out of the fridge. Think little chunks of hard butter that don't actually mix.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for: a basic, no frills recipe using ingredients I have on hand. The resulting crepes made a good base for both savory or sweet fillings. I docked a star because some changes to the original recipe were necessary: the batter came out rather thick so I added water until it thinned out to  proper crepe-batter consistency. Also, the mixing indtructions are a little odd so I went with the Tried & True mix wet, mix dry, then mix dry into wet.

recipe ratios are spot on. the issue I had and I should have known better was adding melted butter to cold milk. it turned back into a solid before I could get it blended properly. for better results. the milk/water should be warmed up to around 45c and butter added. mix all dry ingredients whilst adding the eggs last to insure the temp is low enough to not cook the egg during mixing.

Just made these right now! Great recipe. After making my first crepe I noticed the batter was a little too thick to move around on the griddle. So I added a bit more milk. About a dash more and poof it was perfect!!! Love this recipe. Going to keep this. Can't wait to make this recipe again!!

Absolutely amazing crepes - I did mix in my magic bullet to deal with the lump issue.  But otherwise, with the right skillet, these are beautiful crepes.

They came out perfectly. It was the first time I made crepes and I hadn't imagined it would be so easy. I used a non stick pan and therefore did not need much oil. Glad I found this recipe!

This turned out great! I did like some of the others and mixed all wet ingredients first and added flour in last. The batter was very smooth.  I filled these crepes with sautéed squash, spinach, mushrooms, cheese and tomatoes topped with hollandaise sauce...Out of this world!

Great recipe. I know my mom's relieved I'm finally making crepes myself and not begging her to cook them up for me haha. I did the same as many others however and added the flour AFTER combining all the wet ingredients. Much easier and much smoother that way.

This is my most requested recipe from my kids.  I love that I always have the ingredients and it is very forgiving if I substitute.   Which is great for my dairy free girl.  My kids like it when I add a bit of vanilla extract and a spoonful of sugar to the batter.

Fast and Easy Recipe. The one thing I added was a couple of drops of Vanilla Extract, to give it a bit of a sweet flavor to the Crepe.
My Daughter loves these & she's a picky eater :-)

I made this batter and took heed to be careful of lumps.  What a perfect crepe recipe!  They taste great and held together wonderfully.  I sautéed one apple and one pear (grated) with butter, sugar, brown sugar, and a dash of salt for  a filling.  This recipe made five 8-inch crepes...perfect for our morning breakfast.

I make this everytime my on has a sleep over party.  I throw in a touch of vanilla and occasionally a bit of sugar depending on how I am going to use the crepe.  The kids love it and it's so easy.

Really easy to make with simple  ingredients. I use vegetable oil on the skillet and spread the oil using a folded paper towel - moderation is the key. When the oil get low I give the pan a minute or two to heat up again. If you're getting big bubbles in your crepe you are probably using too much oil and/or too high heat. Love them with strawberry jam and peanut butter, and so do my two year olds!

Fabulous!  And those were my husband's words...

Seriously - these are spectacular and so easy to make.  We also added a bit of sugar. For the insides we did two versions- one with nutella and banana and the other with warmed berries (took the frozen package we got from Costco and just warmed them on the oven with a little sugar in a pan) and topped it with whipped cream.  All Recipes is the bomb!!

This is a great recipe! After reading the reviews, I decided to make a couple of changes. First of all, I added the wet ingredients and mixed and then the dry. Also, I added vanilla and a bit of sugar for my dessert crepes. For the filling, I used blueberries and a powdered sugar and cream cheese mixture. Delicious!

I learnt how to make beautiful French crepes from a Frenchman who studied food preparation in France. Must use a well seasoned crepe pan. 

He places mixed dry ingredients in a mixing bowl, piled in the middle. Makes a well in the centre of the pile into which pours the pre mixed wet ingredients at room temperature (one egg per person, milk, salt, melted butter). He then stirs the wet ingredients in the centre keeping to small circles and gradually work his way into larger and larger circles as the liquids incorporate all the dry ingredients. It is important to work your way in larger circles slowly to ensure flour is well "wetted". When all blended it is frigerated for an hour. To cook: heat up the crepe pan over medium heat, making sure the pan is thoroughly heated and put butter on it, allow it to melt and coat the surface evenly. Slowly pour about 4-6 tbsp of batter (ketchup consistency)  onto the crepe pan and tilt the pan to encourage batter to flow and evenly coat the pan. Allow to cook over medium heat for a few minutes until surface looks dry. Peel crepe off pan, (if it doesn't peel off easily it is not ready. Flip. Repeat. Enjoy. Re butter pan for next crepe.

Family loves this, I’ve made it as is and with the suggested additions of a bit of sugar and vanilla, both are good. I usually make these with a blueberry compote, cook apples cinnamon sugar, and make sweetened sour cream it’s delicious. Someday plan on making a crepe cake but would need to at leas triple the recipe. I usually have to double it for my family of 6 :)

Made crepes for the 1st time using this recipe. My daughter and I both loved them. I've seen comments about lumpy batter. Mine was perfect. I didn't read instructions correctly and combined the milk, water and eggs separately in a 2 cup mixing cup. Then whisked it into the flour and salt. Worked great. Tasted great!

I love this recipe! I make it all the time and never mess up on it. Super easy to make. I like to add Greek yogurt inside to fill the crepes with creamy and healthy goodness!

My alteration:  add some granulated sugar, almond flavoring, a dash or two of cinnamon and a couple pinches of cocoa powder.  I put fresh fruit inside, and dust with powdered sugar. Sometimes I will drizzle with creme anglaise or even a simple almond flavored thin powdered sugar frosting.

I agree with some others that it is too thick as written. I add a little more milk. Very simple to make up and store the extra in the fridge.

batter is way to thick and cooking at that temperature made the IT hard to thin out the crepe in the pan before it started to cook.  Not great.

I haven't had a problem with my wish and this batter. I added a little more water, Splenda Brown Sugar and sugar free syrup and Vanilla. Good stuff as long as I don't eat too many at one time. Good for a take along snack too.

The first time I made this recipe, I gave it 5 stars. Unfortunately, the 2nd time the batter was too buttery and the crepes were greasy and inedible. I made it the exact same way. I think you should mix all the wet stuff and then sift in the flour and salt

My gas stove was way too hot, and it made the batter bubble, which left it with an uneven spongy/leathery texture. Crepes are supposed to be light and fluffy.  Better for it to take longer.  It also helps if you have better cookware.  If your pan does not heat evenly, you'll end up with brown spots or bubbles where the pan is hotter.

I like this recipe, enough that I've made it twice to go with a strawberries and creme filling from a separate recipe. It tastes very delicious and when they come out well they are beautiful and of an excellent texture. However, I tend to have some trouble with the consistency. Make sure to mix the ingredients in the order it tells you or you'll have problems with it being too thick (I did that this time). I'm going to try a different recipe next time though because the consistency is just a little bit off even when done correctly. Hasn't failed me either time though although both times I wished I had doubled it, there was just enough for everyone to have two with one left over.

Perfect crepe recipe! Had for my 1st Mother's Day breakfast. Filled with a thin layer of homemade lemon curd & topped with strawberries. Served with Applegate Chicken & Maple sausage. Would be great for breakfast, a savory lunch or dinner, or dessert filled with melted chocolate & topped with whipped cream.

Awesome recipe! Super easy, and they turn out great every time. I mixed the wet stuff up first then added the flour, but other than that I didn't change a thing. Love them with Nutella and banana!

Great recipe! I did add about 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. These turned out better than expected.

Perfect! Definitely mix all wet together before slowly whisking in the dry. I added some vanilla and sugar as well to the batter! Yum!

Great basic recipe.  I just throw everything in the blender and blend it until well mixed.  I haven't noticed any negative impact...and the crepes still turn out great.

This is a really nice recipe and one that you can literally decide to prepare on a whim.  I like to add a little sugar (vanilla sugar is even better - store sugar and a vanilla pod together in a jar until you're happy with the taste & aroma) to the batter for sweet crepes.  My favorite way to eat them goes back to "Pancake Day" growing up in England - lemon juice and brown sugar and then rolled up - delicious!  I still eat them like this, although a little Nutella is also yummy.

Tried making crepes for the first time last night and used this recipe. I took the advice from another comment and mixed wet and dry ingredients separate and sifted in the dry. Worked lovely! My only complaint is I found the batter too thick. I added in at least another 1/2 cup of milk, (should have measured but didn't), and it was much better! Nice and thin! I realized the pan does have to be good and hot for the crepe to really turn out the best :)

Loved it! First time ever that my crepes came out good and in one piece. But do you realize that the accompanying video does not follow the printed directions? I too added the flour to the wet ingredients after whisking them. I made a cheese filling and had blintzes with blueberries and sour cream. Yum Yum. thank you for such an easy recipe.

This is my first time at crepes, and it turned out surprisingly well. I did follow Morely's instructions about mixing all wets first (eggs, milk, water, butter) and then salt and 1/4 tsp vanilla before I sifted in the flour at the end and whisked it thoroughly. I used a lightly oiled cast iron pan over just above medium heat (gas stove) and used 1/4 cup measurements of batter and spread it out by rotating my pan and it worked out awesome. I cooked 2 minutes on one side and made sure it was loose from the pan by giving the pan a shake, flipped it and put a little fruit on top in the middle in a line, flipped the sides up and removed it from the pan. I then tossed a spoon of plain yogurt on and sprinkled with a little icing sugar. This is a stellar recipe :) Thank you

Very very good. Also works with water if you don't have milk. Put melted chocolate.... mmmm! So good! And I find that not using the spatula works better.

Pretty spot on. Nice, eggy, filling crepes!

We ended up adding a little more liquid to thin them so they would spread better. A bigger skillet really helps create a nicer, thinner crepe...

I agree with the comment above that for even decent results you have to whisk the eggs and milk together first, then add the flour. Also every recipe should include the fact that the best results don't happen by adding an exact  measured amount of flour. it's best to add the flour a bit at a time until it coats the whisk more on the thin side for very thin "crepes" and a thicker coating for more substantial ones. PLUS, the most important omission is that it possibly originated in Czechoslovakia as Palacinky and is a mainstay of Viennese cuisine as Palatschenke.

These are the best crepes I have ever made! My nephews and siblings are always asking for them! This is the only recipe I will ever need. Instead of mixing the flour and eggs then add the wet ingredients  I add all the wet ingredients then the dry. It makes smooth batter that way and is far better and easier.

I have not yet tried this recipe, but since I live in France, I have more than enough experience with making crepes!  The way it is always mixed together here is to mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl, make a well in the center, then break open the eggs into the well.  Slowly pour the liquids in while gently whisking the eggs around - this mixes in the flour gradually and avoids most lumps.  Then add the melted butter.  THEN, the batter sits for about an hour.  This allows the rest of the lumps to reabsorb.  We often add a bit of rum or lemon juice/zest, also, for flavoring.  Enjoy!

I absolutely love this recipie. Of course I tweaked it a bit as I always do. I added  about 1/4 Splenda  to sweeten it up a bit a well as 1/2 tsp of vanilla for flavor. Once finished I filled then with a sweetened cream cheese and strawberries. Topped with light Reddi Whip and more strawberries, also sweetened with Splenda. It was fabulous!!

Just made these for the kids and they loved them.  I followed the advise from another to add flour last.  They turned out great!  I put a sliced banana in the middle with heavy whipped cream and then rolled them.  Strawberry on top with drizzled chocolate.

Made these for breakfast this morning, stuffed them with potatoes, onions, ham and cheddar cheese.  Amazing!  I followed on reviewers advice and slowly incorporated the milk, water and egg mixture in with the dry ingredients. Super easy, will be trying a dessert version in the near future!

This is a very good basic recipe. But I had to remake it because it says to add the flour first which makes it clumpy. So add all the wet ingredients and then whisk in the flour little by little. I also added a little bit of sugar for sweetness. Also I had to adjust it to using 1/3 cup of batter for my pan size. Make sure you spread the batter out quickly!

Great great great recipe.. I really love it.. It is so easy and delicious. But there is one exception is that mixing the flour with the eggs then adding the ingredients makes unusable agglomeration. So I mixed the liquids together then i added the powders to it... It was much better.

They came out perfect. This is hands down my favorite. 
When mixing the egg and flour I thought something went wrong. It ended up being the best I have ever made. 
I like to fill mine with lingonberry and butter. yuM

Followed the recipe exactly, except to mix the wet ingredients first. No need to tweak this for me, they were perfect as is. Filled them with fruit and whipped cream and topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar. They were perfect! Thanks so much for sharing, this is a keeper!

I tried out the recipe and it was amazing! I did exactly what the recipe told and it was great! You will probably want to add something to it to make it have some more flavor (like jam) since without anything it is pretty plain. Overall, I think this recipe was great! =)

This was my first attempt at making crepes, and this recipe was so easy! I blended all the ingredients in my Blendtec blender, and it turned out great. Thanks so much for a no-fail recipe! For the filling, I used strawberries and blended a package of cream cheese, 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp lemon juice, then folded in 1 cup heavy cream (whipped), and it was amazing.

Came out great! I followed the suggestion of mixing the wet ingredients first then sifting in the flour. I added slightly more water. Thanks

It didn't taste too bad, but it turned out more like pancake batter. I'll probably add more milk or water next time. Also, it's easier to mix the eggs in with the wet ingredients and slowly add the flour last.

I just tried this recipe and it was quite delicious. I did increase the salt just a little bit, added some sugar, a bit of orange zest and a splash of vanilla. Very easy with great results. Just like many others on here, I would mix the wet and dry ingredients separately, adding the dry gradually to the wet so you don't get lumps and use a wire whisk. Will definitely make again. Also, I made these as a sweet breakfast entrée. For savory crepes, leave out the sweeteners

I am thinking of ways to be creative with the basic crepe.  One thought is with a concoction of shrimp, cream cheese (maybe not cream cheese, but something with a good melt...Havarti?  Brie?), chives, Worcestershire sauce, dash of hot sauce.  Maybe drizzle a hollandaise on the plate?  I will absolutely HAVE to make a bunch so I can freeze some and try a couple different ideas.  Of course, old fashioned fresh sliced fruit and whipped cream kind is my favorite.  Just thought of another idea.  Roll them up and dip one end in a caramel sauce (that will hard set, roll the end in brown sugar (before it sets)and serve with ice cream.  By the way, liked the idea someone had to add vanilla extract.  Could try with orange too, nice and bright taste.

I was searching for a good authentic crepe recipe and this was not it. Taste is good, no "egg-y" taste to it but it was more of a pancake batter than a crepe batter. Alas, the search continues.

This is a great base recipe and can be adapted in many ways. However, for easier prep and better consistency I add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth. I let the batter sit for just a few minutes the pour straight into the pan. If I am using this recipe for a dessert crepe I omit the salt and add 1/2 tsp sugar to the batter instead. Enjoy!!

I mixed the dry ingredients together, then mixed wet ones.  Then add the wet to the dry.  Make sure your batter is thin.

I loved this recipe I bought a crepe flat teflon pan today with wooden roller and your recipe is the first I tried. My daughter yesterday told me crepes were her favourite.... I doubled the recipe and used mixer to mix eggs milk and water added tablespoon of vanilla sugar the salt and some powdered sugar and vanilla extract and finished with the flour and they came out amazing(about two thirds a cup per crepe. I even used stoneground "70" whole wheat flour (so had to add some more milk for consistency). They came out every bit as good as the bought ones (needed very little oil) I spread with nutella and folded like bought ones and then rolled some with apples fried in butter with cinnamon and sugar my kids and us loved them! thank you!

This batter is too thick to be crepe batter.  I had to add more liquid.   It should be thin enough that you can swirl your pan quickly to cover the bottom before it begins to set.  I also added a bit of sugar and a little vanilla because we prefer it that way.  Once you get it thin enough, this makes really good batter.  We lived in France for three years, and traditionally, they like it with cinnamon and sugar and melted butter, or filled with Nutella, or filled with bananas.  We prefer it filled with a mixture of cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla and topped with homemade mixed berry topping.  My youngest likes it with the filling and drizzled with chocolate syrup.  To the person who said they could not see mixing the flower and eggs, you are right.  The best way to mix this batter is to put all the ingredients into the blender, pulse until everything is nicely mixed, and then let the batter rest in the fridge for 1/2 hour to 1 hour, to allow excess air from mixing to escape.  

Overall, the taste is really good if you get the batter thinner.  I would use this recipe again, with my modifications.

Don't listen to the person below. Mixing the sifted flour and eggs first doesn't cause problems for me when cooking this. I've had no lumps. Good recipe!

Absolutely fantastic recipe. I would give it a 5 star for the ingredients and proportions but a 1 star for directions. 

Changes I made:
added about 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of sugar to make it more of a breakfast crepe. 

For combining I followed another reviewers recommendations and combined the wet ingredients (minus the melted butter)and whisked until combined
Then add the flour (which I spooned into the measuring cup so as not to make the batter to thick) and salt and whisk until no longer lumpy 
Finally add the melted butter and combine. 
This results in a lump free batter that is the perfect consistency for crepes!

Just made this for breakfast. Only adjustment i made was adding wet ingredients to dry, and using extra milk as I thought the batter was a little too thick. Filled with cream cheese, strawberries and bananas. Topped with whip cream and sliced strawberry, drizzled chocolate sauce. Will make again as a dessert! Kids loved them!

You need to add flavor to the batter such as vanilla essence or even better for crepes is rum and let it rest for 30 minutes. Been making crepes since the age of 5 at least once a week. Must have been my mother's favorite recipe.

I initially followed the recipe minus the salt, I was making a kind of desert dish that you can put peanut butter and jelly and syrup all over. So I forewent the salt, the first batch turned out alright, though thick... So when I went to make the second batch I added a bit more milk and a touch of vanilla extract, and didn't add butter (mainly because I forgot...). 

The second batter turned out much better than the first and recipe given. That's why I  only gave three stars, mainly because my changes made the batter better :)

Perfect and easy recipe. I just love it. I agree with Morley that mixing the flour into the wet is the best way to go. I did it the other way the first time I made these crepes and it is so much easier to mix the flour last!

So glad I tried this! I followed the advice of another reviewer and first mixed the eggs, milk and water, then added the flour. I was always nervous to try making crepes because I thought I would mess them up, but these were so easy! I made them for my kids, and served them with a squeeze of lemon and powdered sugar. My kids(and husband) loved them! Will make again for sure...thanks for sharing!

Tasty and easy.  A family favorite!  I follow the recipe but also add 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. When they are done, I fill them with Nutella, fresh sliced bananas and strawberries, and whipped cream.  Then I roll them up and finish them off with a little sprinkling of powdered sugar. Delicious!

I made these today, one change as suggested in the previous reviews, i also mixed the wet ingredients first and then added the sifted flour, the batter came out perfect. I left it in the refrigerator for an hour before making them. The first 2 were not perfect but the rest were beautiful. We ate few as desert, (strawberries,Nuttelo,whip cream and powder sugar) yum!! refrigerated the rest for breakfast, will make savory. Love the simple and delish recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These are delicious!! I make these for my family all the time and we eat every single one. The batter does get a bit lumpy so use a BEATER instead if a whisk and there will not be a limp in sight. Absolutely fantastic flavor??

This turned out awesome! I did exactly as it said, mixd flour and eggs. You have to fully mix till moistened. It was a bit lumpy but just keep mixing till slightly smooth. Then added other wet ingredients and when it became too much to mix by hand, used hand held mixer. Combined great and cooked evenly! I made dinner crepes with bacon, arugula, parm and a little spread of garlic cream cheese and avocados on top. Turned out AMAZING! Next time will try desert crepe.

At first I thought I did the recipe wrong when I seen that the mixture was a little too watery. this was my first time making crepes. But it turned out amazing and my little creations never made the table because they were eaten right off the stove. I would recommend this to anyone.

OUTSTANDING! So easy, too! I followed this recipe exactly. I made some crepes with fresh blueberries, fresh whipped creme and powdered sugar. I made others with Peanut Butter and Co.'s Dark Chocolate Dreams Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter and lotus Biscoff spread (similar to Speculoos cookie butter from Trader Joe's), and fresh whipped creme. Soooo divine! Thanks for sharing this awesome and easy recipe!

Overall I thought these crepes were a success. I followed the recommendation of first combining the wet ingredients then adding the dry which worked very well. My advice is to use low-medium heat and avoid letting the pan get to hot, otherwise they become overdone very quickly

This is the first crepe recipe I have tried and I was not impressed. It tasted eggy and I had to add more milk and water to get it to the proper consistency. I had crepes from the street vendors in Paris and that is what I was looking to make. This recipe was nothing like that.

This recipe has been my go to recipe for the past few months when I just don't feel like cooking. I love this recipe, although definitely DO NOT mix flour and eggs first. The crepes get lumpy and just not as enjoyable as they could be. I forgot about this after not making crepes for a month and alas, I have learned my lesson.

Made this for my roommate to welcome her back from reading week. It was perfect! The crepes had exactly the texture i wanted. I did what a lot of the comments advised to do, which was to mix all the what ingredients first and then add the flour. Made it so much easier.

Tip to get rid of lumps (i still had some in my batter): pour the batter through a strainer. It works great!

I LOVE CREPES but have never had the courage to try to make them myself. Now having made my first attempt, and finding them delicious, I'm now ready to add embellishments like fruit. Thanks for this awesome recipe! I faced my fear and vanquished it! YUM!

I've been making these for years, and they're always a hit! I double the salt, use fat free milk, and omit the added butter (I can't taste a difference!). They're also good with half white whole grain flour and half all purpose.

This recipe was one of the first recipes I've ever learned. It is perfect for beginners, and with practice can be made into beautiful, delicious crepes. Whenever I make the recipe, I usually don't add very much salt, add some vanilla extract, and a few dashes of cinnamon sugar which I have learned from a friend.

So Amazing! I added a little extra milk to get the batter to the right consistency.  I stuffed with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and bananas, I also spread on a little nutella, and topped with Whipped Cream.  Amazing!

I Have made this recipe in the passed it come out great, today I tried using egg substitute the texture was a little off. I also used cooking spay. that didn't work to well. Butter is better to use. But they do have a good taste. they also can be served with jelly inside or cinnamon and sugar. Good any time! Thanks, Happy Cooking!

My first time making and eating Crèpes for that matter.  Simple recipe to follow. I did as the other reviewer suggested and added my flour last. I had no issues with clumpy batter. Added a little vanilla too. Definitely easier than pancakes. Next time I'll try a filling for the Crèpes. Thanks!

I thought it was way too buttery and it calls for no sugar or vanilla extract so it wasn't sweet at all. After realizing the mistake with the first crepe I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 3 teaspoons of sugar. It came out slightly better but it was still way too buttery. My brother liked it, though.

i tried to make them, i was a  bit scared because it looked difficult but i have to say i did them pretty well and they tasted pretty good almost as good as my girlfriends crepes, my stove was a bit too hot and medium high was too high so i just adjusted the time i cooked them for and lowered the heat a bit and they were perfect with some lemon juice and syrup! Amazing, thank you!

Ridiculously easy! As a first time crepe maker I couldn't be happier with the results.

I've been to France, tasted hot crepes off the street and these are just as good! Plus less expensive. Recipe was easy to follow and I only messed up on one crepe. Yay!

This recipe turned out great! It reminded me of my dad's homemade waffle recipe which we only get to enjoy once a year. It helps that my dad is French and I've had authentic french crepes (some what similar to these except a little less doughy) to give me a better idea for what to expect. The only thing I did differently was that I added about 3 tablespoons of sugar and a half tablespoon of vanilla extract to make it have that full flavor I love. I will definitely be making these more often rather than going out and buying pre-mixed mix at the store.

Great recipe! All it needs is about 1/4 cup sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. With those ingredients I would give it 5 stars! I cooked mine on my
Griddle at 300F, I stored them in my pre warmed oven until the whole batch was finished. Absolutely delish :)

Tried making crepes for the first time today with this recipe and it is just fantastic! I will be using this recipe forever along with some of the many tips from others like to add sugar for the sweet version. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is already saved in my recipe box! :)

Wonderful taste and very simple! Keep an eye on them though, mine took less than 2 minutes to cook.

Great classic recipe. Adding flour to the wet ingredients, as suggested in the comments, gave me more trouble with lumps than following the recipe as it is. I suggest sticking with the original and taking the time to get rid if any lumps.

Made these for the first time. They were very easy to make. The batter was lumpy at first but I whisked it a lot to lose the lumps. All in all this was a good recipe.

Used this the first time making crepes. A good basic recipe. I added vanilla and a little sugar. Making it in the blender was so easy. Next time I would double this since it only made 8 crepes...one per person wasn't a lot.

These are perfect, every time! But do remember to mix them up the night before so the batter can "gel" in the refrigerator overnight.

A good recipe to start with. Although they came out thicker than I would have liked, I think next time I will add more milk and water, and also I think it would have been better to mix all of the eggs, milk, water, and butter first then add the salt and flour slowly. That way it isn't so lumpy.

I made this recipe as a first attempt at crepes. Was easy to make and tasted good although I did make some changes based on people’s comments. I mixed dry ingredients separately from wet them blended all together at once. Added 1/8 C each of sugar and powdered sugar. If you don’t like a slightly sweet taste I would leave the sugar out. 
In summary a good first experience

Amazing recipe!  The only thing I did differently was adding a half cup of Splenda (or sugar), and a capful of vanilla (about a tsp).  Today, I'm going to add some cocoa powder to the batter and put bananas in the middle of some and orange slices in others.

Great recipe!! Just mix all the wet ingredients together, then add flour or you get a lumpy batter, some people suggest adding sugar, but i recommend you do not, as if you make it a dessert crepe, it will be too sweet if sugar is added. I make mine by spreading Nutella, graham cracker cookie(crumbled up) and sliced bananas, roll and add a dollop of whipped cream on top! Makes a great dessert, My kids love it!! Quick and easy!! Thanks!!

We loved this recipe!  I used the blender and put all the wet ingredients in first to keep the dry stuff from sticking on the bottom.   Since we were doing more of a sweet than savory I added 1 T sugar and a splash of vanilla.

Yum! This is so easy  to make and so delicious. What I do is that I add just a drop of vanilla extract to add just a bit of more flavor also just a couple of drops of extra milk. Because crepes are supposed to be thin and the batter should be on the thin and smooth and creamy!!

I've had crepes in Europe many times and I've also tried out several recipes here in America. While this is an okay recipe, the resemble pancakes way more than they should. They were thicker and less flexible than I'd like them to have been.

I was always intimidated by crepes since my mom failed to be able to make them properly when I was younger.  Then I decided to try my hand at these and BOY! were they a hit!  Super easy too and I love the fact that they use "normal" ingredients.  They have now become a family staple :)

This is great! I just toss everything in a bowl at once and whisk. I also add about a teaspoon of white sugar just to help the browning and overall flavour. Very good! :)

I like this recipe a lot! I added a cup of milk and no water though. And a tbsp. of raw sugar and some organic Almond extract which I'm not sure I tasted in the crepes.
 The best way not to have lumpy batter and easiest is to make it in the blender, then let the batter rest a few minutes, which I always do. I make cheese blintzes by sweetening some Aldi's ricotta cheese w/ a couple tbsp. of TJ organic powdered sugar.  After the crepe comes out of the pan I spoon and spread the ricotta across the middle of the crepe and roll it up. You can top it with some jam, I just used some TJ pumpkin butter! 
Our second crepe this morning was spread down the middle with 2tbsp. of Nutella and then bannana rounds down the whole center and rolled up w/ a little more Nutella spread on top. My husband said it would be pretty w/some of the powdered sugar sprinkled on top. He and my 20mo. son ate them both up quickly!

A new staple in my kitchen. This is the best crepe recipe I have ever found. To avoid clumps, mix all of the wet ingredients first and beat well. Then slowly beat in the flour/salt two tablespoons at a time until thick and no clumps remain. I also added a teaspoon vanilla. Yummy!

This is really good, but the second time I made this, adding a few drops of vanilla really helped add some sweetness, not too much though.

So this was my first time making crêpes. Its sort of a working progress as far as perfecting it but I think it has potential.

I have made this recipe twice for breakfast and my family really enjoyed it both times. I made a cream cheese topping and cut fresh strawberries to go with it. Restaurant quality!

Just finished making these crepes for me and my 2 year old son. They were absolutely delicious!! I did make slight variations, I added cinnamon, 2 Tbsp sugar, a tsp vanilla and a tiny bit of extra flour to thicken just a little. They came out great! I cooked them on a large round pan and they were so easy to flip taking not even five minutes per crepe. I did spray cooking spray after each crepe and never had a problem with sticking. As I took each crepe off of the pan I melted butter on each side and sprinkled a littlegranulated sugar on top. I had some peach preserves I had bought from the farmers market so I put some in a bowl and warmed them up for 30 seconds in the microwave, poured that on one crepe and put another crepe on top of that and the rest of the warm peach preserves on top. My son and I loved it!! These crepes were so easy to make and they made enough for a couple of meals, can't wait to make them again, might try them with nutella next time, I think they would taste even better that way!!

Great recipe yet I also got a lumpy batter but instead of throwing away I strained it and got rid of all lumps and they still came out DELISH!!! My husband and kids love them bc they're so versatile I can stuff them with ham and eggs or strawberries and Lechera or butter and maple syrup. Def a new fave here in my house

Awesome recipe ... Made some changes though...mixed the wet ingredients (except butter) first, then stirred in the flour gradually...then only poured the melted butter..came out like pro French crepe :))) had some ganache in d fridge...warmed it, then added coconut powder and almond powder...spread this mixture on the crepes and rolled them into pipes...served with some hot senseo coffee!! unfortunately, didn't take any pictures..'twas too yummy to wait :p

It's a great basic recipe for crepes, it is simple and to the point and doesn't need to sit in the fridge.  I usually add a little something for flavor : vanilla extract, lime, orange zest, orange blossom water, rum, or anything that gives it a little twist. I usually mix the ingredients in the order given by the recipe to avoid lumps in the batter, and if needed use the blender but mildly.

I LOVE this recipe. I've used it time and time again, even while living in France. It works for savory and sweet crepes. When I'm making sweet crepes, I add a little sugar to the batter to give the crepe more flavor.

Like other reviewers, I found that if I combined the wet ingredients first and then sifted in the flour, it was much much easier to mix and prevent from clumping.

Alternatively you can just let it sit for 5-10 minutes and then beat some more.

Absolutely love this crepe recipe! Made them with cooked chicken, Gouda, and sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, and onions. The only thing I would change next time is to add the eggs to the wet ingredients not the flour. My crepes had some lumps in them even though I whisked them for at least 4 min.

This crepe batter is really, really good! I mixed the dry ingredients in my stand mixer with the whisk attachment, then poured in the milk, water, & 1/2 t. of vanilla all at once, mixed it well, and then added the eggs and mixed well again. It blended wonderfully and I only had a few tiny specks that didn't mix that were settled at the bottom of the bowl when I was done pouring & making them. I did take another reviewers advice on adding the vanilla and 1/3 c. of sugar, but it was a tiny bit too sweet after we put our strawberry filling inside and the sweetened whip cream on top. They were so good I decided to make more for the next day and some to freeze, so I made the recipe again, doubling it, and only used the 1/3 c. for both instead of each, and that was perfect for us. These were great! :) (I just wish they were faster to cook! lol)

Loved this recipe. I substituted the milk with soy milk and the flour with gluten free all purpose flour. i also added a small bit of coconut palm sugar and used coconut oil on the pain instead of butter. it was amazing. :)

This recipe was absolutely delicious!! I don't cook much but it was super easy to make and turned out amazing. No need to spend big money going to crepe stores now! The only modification I would suggest (if you're making it to eat with nutella or any dessert item) is to add some sugar and vanilla extract! Turns outttt absolutely incredible!!

It came out in a great fluffy shape, but I thought it tasted kind of wierd.  Maybe it was the salt, but I didn't care for it.

this was a great recipe - my mother was french and an excellent pastry chef. we grew up eating crepes for breakfast instead of pancakes. Thank you! this recipe is the closest i have ever come to duplicating her delicious crepes.
I have multiple allergies so I substituted the flour for gluten free (rice/tapioca based), the milk for so-delicious brand coconut milk (unsweetened vanilla in the carton) and the butter for earth balance brand organic coconut spread. Excellent results and even my husband could not taste the difference for the substitutions.

I half-ed the recipe since I made it for one person. The first crepe came out a bit hard so I added a little more milk to thin it out. The second one came out perfectly :) . So if you halfen the recipe add a little more milk. Just enough to thin the mixture a bit. Maybe 1/8 cup of milk. And thanks to everyone's helpful comments I blended my wet ingredients before adding the flour :) ! Anyhoo, really really good. And if you're looking for a healthy vegan cream process 1cup of cashews with your favorite fruit and refrigerate for a bit. Can be eaten right out of the processor too but refrigeration will thicken it more. Add honey too if you'd like. Yaaaaay fooooood!

This is super quick and easy.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla with my milk and water, but other than that, I followed the instructions exactly and they came out great.  I served them filled with honey, strawberry cream cheese, and a cinnamon sugar mixture.  So tasty!

WOW! I've never made crepes before and was always under the impression that they were difficult to make. Not this recipe! I did the wet ingredients first with the whisk in the mixer but realized my half batch wasn't big enough for my mixer so I whisked in the dry ingredients myself. I added some sugar and vanilla for sweet breakfast crepes. The batter was smooth and thin and they came out beautiful! They only needed less than a minute on the pan before they were ready for a flip. A little powdered sugar, whipped cream, and boysenberry jam and they were amazing! I can't wait to make more!

After mixing, I poured the batter in the blender to get rid of the lumps. Also made it easy to pour. My first time making creeps. Super easy and everyone loved them!

Awesome, simple recipe! I agree with Morley though, reverse the order and sift in the flour to avoid lumps.  I also added zero salt, and instead added a -load (technical cooking term) of sugar (to taste).  I serve them with fruit, walnuts, fudge, butterscotch, and whipped cream, so I want them sweet instead of salty.

The best.  You can even leave the leftover batter in a container in the fridge and use it the next day.  Just mix it up with a fork and it's just like new.  It's fabulous!  I make extra just to have on hand when my kids want a nutella crepe as a snack.

This recipe was pretty good.  I would suggest not mixing it in the order indicated as whisking 2 eggs and flour just gives you a large clump.  I would instead mix the flour and salt together and then add all the wet ingredients except for the butter. Once those were combined I would add in the butter. The recipe also makes a very small amount and my family finished them off in no time.  We usually use a better recipe from the site, that I have rated in the past, but I accidently brought this one up.

It was fantastic, it made exactly 8 crepes as described, this was my first time making something that didn't come from a box on my own, and it turned out great, my friends liked it, my mom and dad liked it, and my little brothers liked it. Thank you for this wonderful experience.

While this recipe got the job done - and they were delicious once we added the nutella and fruit - the actual crepe on it's own was not very tasty.  Next time I will try to add vanilla or something else to sweeten up the actual crepe.

Very good and easy! My daughter (who is 9) had to make a dish from France, and she chose crepes. She was able to easily make these for the family - we added some nutella and strawberries (and whipped cream)... yummy!

Good recipe except for the melted butter.  I found the recipe too greasy for me.  I used the ingredients as written but mixed the dry into the wet to get a smooth consistency.  The batter was a little too thick.  Next time, I'll omit the butter and add more milk or water to thin it out a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe is wonderful! I also added 1/3 c. of sugar, as well as 1 teaspoon of vanilla. It was fabulous! We put butter on it and powdered sugar and it was fabulous! Next time we'll try some fruit or something. It was great because we had all of the ingredients on hand! :)

As many mentioned, it is hard to get the lumps out when initially adding flour + egg. I already did that before reading the reviews and was left with lumpy batter. After adding all components (butter and salt included), I ended up using my immersion blender to get out all the lumps. Worked perfect!

This was my first time making crepes and they turned out pretty good.  My batter was slightly lumpy but I think it was my fault in how I mixed the ingredients.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe.

This recipe works like a charm every time I try it.  My husband was very skeptical I could make these from scratch, especially as we don't have a crepe pan (and I'm not the world's greatest cook).  However, this recipe has never failed me, and I got the best compliment ever when I made them for a French friend and she asked for seconds!

Quick technical note, instead of a regular frying pan, I use a non-stick pan with no oil.  With the heat somewhere between low and medium (3.5 on our stove), the non-stick pan works perfectly for cooking the crepes.

It was my first time making crepes. This was a good recipe. I tried it the way the instructions said, and for me it needed more flavor. I gradually added more ingredients so the flavor was to my liking. In the end this is what I added: 1 tsp vanilla, 2 TBSP powder sugar, and a dash of cinnamon. I like the end result. Next time I'll try to prep stuff to add to the crepes. I'll have to do that in advance because I was too hungry to wait.

This recipe is easy to make and modifies quite simply. I agree with other reviews on mixing wet ingred. first and then adding the flour.  I had a pasty, clumpy mess of folur and eggs stuck in my whisk!

Yum! I read all the conflicting reviews about mixing the liquid and then adding the flour or mixing the flour and eggs and then adding the liquid. In the end...I can't actually remember what I did. I did mix it with my powered hand mixer thingy and ended up with some lumps anyway. However, I still cooked it and the lumps seemed to disappear in the cooking process. One happy customer!

Good,really easy. I added a bit less flour because it seemed kind of thick. Also, I let the batter sit in the fridge for 30min before using.

Next time will mix the egg with the liquid ingredients first, but overall was good. I substituted the milk with Buttermilk, for the butter I used virgin olive oil, and added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. (Reduced the amount of water)

Very good, moist crêpes.  Will use again.  ** Do not follow mixing directions in recipe!** Mix liquids in one bowl, then added pre-mixed dry ingredients.  Added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 C sugar for sweet crêpes and about 1/2 C extra liquid (water and/or milk) until batter was runny.  When frying I only used butter on the first one; non-stick pans don't need it.  Served 3 ways: sprinkled with sugar and lemon juice, with maple syrup, and with chocolate-hazelnut spread (with optional coconut).  May try omitting sugar and vanilla next time and making savoury ones (with cheese, eggs, spinach, asparagus, tomatoes and/or ham inside).

Lovely recipe. I added about 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water to the recipe, bringing each to a full cup. It makes the batter thinner, making the crepes crisp a little more. Next time I would probably add an entire cup of each to thin it out even further.

When following mixing directions, the result is LUMPS, works better if you mix the wet stuff together and then add the dry.

Would have been a 5 star for me if the liquid to dry proportions were more 'crepe like'. Once I added 1/4 cup more milk the consistency was good and the batter spread nicely accross the pan. Whisking the egg, milk, and water together and then sifting in the flour will prevent clumps.

I love this recipe! I made it once for breakfast after my teenage sons friends all stayed over, and now they all request this each weekend! So far the favorite fillings are Nutella, jam, or scrambled eggs with scrambled sausage.
Also, I followed Morleys advice: "Doing the reverse - mixing the eggs & wet stuff then sifting in the flour - worked way better."

Amazing! First I just combined liquid ingredients and then added dry ones. I didn't have milk so I used half and half instead. The crepes turned out simply delicious! Also, I doubled the ingredients... next time I am going to triple them. Love crepes so much! I eat them with strawberries and whipped cream, honey, preserves, bananas, and other fruit. Perfect snack anytime. Thanks for the easy recipe.

These crepes were perfect. They spread out well, were nice and thin, and were easy to flip. My fiance had his with bacon and eggs on top and he loved them. I had Nutella and blueberries with mine. Very good. Thanks for the recipe.

I've tried several crepe recipes and this one is the best one. They turned out like real french crepes you find in Paris. Even better with a little nutella spread on  :-)

Update: It seems the next few times I tried this, it wasn't cooperating as well. As per other comments, doing the flour and eggs together creates a big pasty mess that doesn't blend easily with the milk (you'll most likely end up with lumps). I put the liquids together first, then blend the dry in. Still good recipe as far as ingredients, but the instructions are odd.

First time that I have ever made crepes, and I used this recipe. They turned out great. I made chocolate gravy to go along with them for my husband's birthday breakfast. He was very happy with them.

i really liked this recipe. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and about a tablespoon of sugar. I will definitely be keeping this recipe for crepes in the future.

Wow! Why did I wait so long to make these?? Delicious & best of all super easy! I did what other reviewers suggested...mixed the wet first then stirred in the flour. Came out lump free. For a filling I mixed cream cheese, sugar (to taste) & frozen strawberries. Yum! I'm going to try Nutella next time. My husband & teenage son both gobbled these up.

Yum yum yum! I am French Canadian and my mom made crepes all the time when I was a kid. Just make sure you have a really great nonstick pan. I eat crepes with fresh blueberries and real maple syrup, and I'm telling you it is delightful. Whether it's for a snack, breakfast, or dessert it's easy to make and sure to be a hit.

To BABYGIRL30S, I usually butter a non-stick pan instead of using oil, because there is an oily texture to the outside of the crepes. I also loosen it with a spatula and then flip it like you would when you're tossing a pizza. Hope this helps!

DELICIOUS i just made this for breakfast :)
ohh man i put in jam and butter and cream as filling and was it amazing !!
i also made 1 with milo filling.  
the only changes i made were to add just a bit more milk to make the batter runnier so it would spread easier.. i also added vanilla extract and cinnamon into the batter and a tiny bit of sugar.

tip: make sure the pan isnt too hot otherwise the batter wont spread as well :)

thankyou for sharing you've made me super happy with this breakfast and now i've got to scoot to the gym

This is my new crepe recipe, the only thing I would do different is mix wet ingredients first, then add the flour, works out better that way.

These were great! Very simple, and buttery. We made with jellies and jams, but could use this with ricotta. Only issue were lumps from whisking the flour and eggs. Next time I'll add milk and water first, then eggs.

This was so easy to make. great recipe. 

Quick tip. i found out that 1/4 of a cup of batter is not enough to make a good size crepe. i used a bit more, but it all depends on the pan you use.

Perfect recipe - and I forgot the butter! I didn't read the steps closely enough and assumed the butter was for the pan only. Never ended up in my batter and I used a quick spray of cooking oil in the pan. These were delicious and quick and easy. My first one I had to throw out because I had my pan too hot, but the rest were great :)

Very good! I found it easier to mix the ingredients in a blender instead of a bowl. That way you can still follow the order of adding ingredients and you have a smooth batter that is easy to pour. Very good with raspberry jam or a little peanut butter.

So simple! I rolled chocolate chips inside some of these and served with syrup. (If you like sweet!) My fiance also put peanut butter on them. He wouldn't stop saying "MmmMMm."
 I followed another reviewers advise and mixed all the wet ingredients first then added flour last.

Made these this morning, minus the 2TBSPS butter, and they were very tasty. Using a small crepe/saute pan, I got 6 crepes out of this recipe. I filled them with some 1% Cottage Cheese, rolled them up and added fresh blueberries and sliced peaches on top. Mmmmm...

Crepe success! I went ahead and prepared the batter as listed, without added sugar. This way, I had the option of making more savory crepes (with melted cheese or sour cream) or sweet crepes (the jam or yogurt added the desired sweetness). I was even able to do some air flips! (The trick is to go all in--no hesitation.) The recipe made exactly 8 crepes, and they are filling.

Very easy and delicious!  I did add one tbls of sugar since I was making dessert crepes. I used a small non-stick pan and made 10 crepes.  I spread them with nutella, a few sliced bananas, roasted pecans, and whipped cream. Folded them over and sprinkled powdered sugar on top, OMG to die for!!!

Very easy and delicious.  They tasted just like the Original Pancake House ones.  The only adjustment I made was to add a splash of vanilla extract.  Easy to double the recipe, easy to cook, easy to eat!

I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out. Like a few others, I combined all wet ingredients and then added the flour and salt. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Looking forward to making crepes again sometime soon!

Very simple and easy. I like that it isn't sweet at all so I can put sweet filling or topping and it isn't over the top.

Easiest and most diverse recipe.  My daughter would eat them every day if I let her!  I add vanilla and lemon juice.  Spectacular with savory or sweet fixings!

With a 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tbsp of vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup of milk, these turned out pretty good. They definitely cook fast! I made these with bananas foster.

Super easy. 
Just mix the ingredients together like the recipe says for success! I used a metal skillet on 4/10 heat on my stove dial and cooked for a couple minutes on each side. At that heat it is easy to spread the batter around. If you make them thin and let them get crispy it is easier to roll and pick them up. Floppier ones are better to eat with a fork. This recipe made enough for about 5 crepes.

These were PERFECT!  I followed the recipe exactly, didn't sift the flour, or add any other ingredients, which is unusual for me.  I spread them with Nutella, folded them in quarters and topped with Frangelica laced whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  They were awesome.

Excellent crepes. I had no problems with the unsifted flour and eggs. I whisked the eggs with the flour, first. I then whisked the milk followed by the water. Then salt and melted butter. I cooked them on a griddle, medium heat and they were delicious. I used a 1/4 cup for each and just poured them starting in the middle and working my way out in a circle. That way, there is no need to swirl the pan or griddle around. They were perfect. Just before they are cooked, I put on eggs (filled w/bacon and gruyere' cheese), then put grated gruyere' on top, put another crepe on top and cook it just for a minute on each side. Yum! I also fill the crepes (after they've cooled). I first use Nutella (or hot fudge) to spread on the two crepes then pile coconut ice cream on top and sliced bananas on top of that. You can also add or substitute strawberries. Cover w/the 2nd crepe and slather whipped cream on the whole thing. DELISH!

This really is a great basic recipe, not too egg-y which I prefer, due to the 1 cup of flour. (Some recipes call for 2 eggs with 1/2 cup flour.) One tip to insure your batter mixture is mixed well and makes it EASY...put all ingredients in the blender and pulse until mixed well.

I noticed my first few crepes would not spread out evenly in pan. Solution add a little more water in batter and wa-la, perfect crepes. I did melt butter in skillet each time before cooking.

Perfect crepes! Easy, quick and tasted great. I couldn’t ask for more. I filled some with ham, egg & cheese and some with cinnamon/ginger pears with whipped cream on top! They were a hit with adults and kids alike.

This was my first time making these and I was very surprised on how simple these were to make. The only modification I made was adding some sugar and vanilla extract to the batter.. My family loved the dark chocolate, strawberries and almond filling!! Needless to say I will be making these more often..

This, what real crepes should taste like!!! I grew up in Russia and it's considered to be a national food and my grandmother used to make it almost every morning. I also add about 2 tablespoones of sugar to the mix. With sour cream or strawberries, yum!

Excellent, easy, and so fast to make! I filled them with thin slice ham, shredded cheese, sauteed onions and mushrooms. Also in some of them I put corn in along with the other mentioned items. Hubby was very happy!

great recipe. easy, cheap, everything you already have in the cupboard.  I ran out of milk and used light coconut milk in place of regular milk.  only problem with these was i was eating them faster than i was cooking them.  thank you for the recipe.

These are good but I ended up adding a lot more milk to get them to a nice thin consistency, probably used twice the amount of milk that was called for in the recipe.

These are great, I made them in a mini non stick pan and they came out great! And the bonus, they where smaller so you could eat more :D I added a little bit of sugar like two teaspoons and it was great. Definitely a keeper. I might try what someone suggested mix all wet ingredients first the batter was lumpy when I did the eggs and flour together.

This recipe was great and easy. After reading a number of reviews I changed how i mixed the batter and I also added a small amount of white sugar to increase browning. Overall a great recipe and I was happy with how they turned out.

Yummm!! I made thes for brunch for my mom and I, and they were fabulous! I followed some other comments about mixing the wet stuff first, and then adding the flour, and they turned out great! I also added some icing sugar into the batter, then filled the cooked crepes with bananna slices and chocolate chips :) Amazing!!

This recipe is great! But I found the calories a little high and left out the majority of the butter. It still works and tasted great! Fill them with strawberry preservs and a lil chocolate syrup and you have a great snack or breakfast!

Simple and delicious recipe, however do not add the flour in until the end, otherwise it will not mix in well and give you a lumpy batter.

Yummy! Easy and delicious.  After reading other reviews, I combined the wet ingredients (plus about a tsp of vanilla) and the dry ingredients (plus about a  tsp of sugar), then combined them and whisked until smooth, and added the butter to that.  I filled with nutella and strawberries and they were great! Spread out the batter as soon as you pour it, because they cook quickly.

I have a 2008 Costco cookbook and this recipe is in it.  I've tried other recipes, even from "The Joy of Cooking", but they weren't as good.  I would serve this with homemade blueberry sauce, or pears cooked in butter, brown sugar, vanilla, pinch of salt, cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg.  Family loves it!

Very good and easy recipe.  I made mine with a gluten-free all-purpose flour mix, added a little sugar to mine too, and topped them with cinnamon apples and walnuts.  This was my first time to make crepes, and I was excited that it was such a success!

great flavour, use this as my go-to crepe recipe every time-I find I have to run the whole mixture through a sieve to get rid of the lumps, and I usually add about 1/4 cup more milk so that the batter spreads around the pan more easily. We enjoy filling with ham and havarti cheese for a savoury crepe and bananas and Nutela for a delish sweet crepe.

I've never made crepes before. This recipe was not only easy- but very yummy! I made one set of crepes with diced apples, cinnamon, nutmeg and butter...and another set with Grand marnier and orange peel. Both were FABULOUS!

I have made these several times.  It is now my favorite breakfast!  I mix all the ingredients in the blender (as listed in the recipe), and use a non-stick 10" skillet.  They turn out perfect every time! And they are soooo easy. We love them with: strawberries and bananas, triple berry mix from Costco, sauteed apples and cinnamon or Nutella and bananas! Don't forget the whipped cream and powdered sugar!

I wanted a simple and easy crepe recipe as I remember making them as a kid.  This one wasnt too bad, although I prefer my crepes to have a taste simmilar to pancakes.  This one was a little more bland but I would make them again.

Very quick and easy to make. I did what other reviews suggested and increased the milk to 3/4c of milk. I also whisked the wet ingredients together first and added the sifted dry to the wet. Fantastic with Nutella and raspberries.

Great recipe! I haven't made crepes before and this recipe was very easy to follow and had great results. I suggest adding a bit more water to your batter. My family was happy and had nothing but positive comments! :)

Very simple recipe! Made delicious crepes.  It took a few tries to get them thin enough but they turned out great! I added Nutella inside after I flipped them and then folded them over. Delicious!

EXCELLENT taste and consistency!  Perfect for crêpes salé.  My girls ate theirs with Nutella, and my husband I and enjoyed ours with sautéed mushrooms and basil. I very slightly brushed the pan with butter between each crêpe and was easily able to flip them without a spatula.  PERFECT!

I had these for dinner tonight with salmon and spring greens.  I'd only ever had them sweet before, but they were quite good in a savory dish as well.  When I make them sweet I add a touch of vanilla extract and sugar to the mix, then stuff with fresh fruits.

Very good and very easy.  This was my first attempt at crepes and they were perfect.  I added sugar to the mix, but if I were filling them with savory ingredients I would not do this.  I filled them with strawberry freezer jam and whip cream. Yummy!

Possibly the simplest and best, most delicious dish I've cooked. I'm a single 21 year old man and I just started living on my own 2 months ago and I must say this dish is very easy to make. I made mine like how Sophies crepes makes there's in japantown San Francisco. I spread nutella as a chocolate base spread and topped it with slices of banana and strawberries, then put on about 1 and a half scoops of vanilla icecream. Thanks AllRecipes!!

Delicious! It tasted just like the crepes I have been craving since my trip to Paris, only less greasy. I added Nutella and raspberries for that additional WOW. Fold it in half, then thirds, and wrap in parchment paper for the authentic Parisian experience.   Thanks to Morley for the tip; it is imperative to mix the wet stuff before sifting in the dry or you'll be left with tons of unstirable lumps.

Great crepes! This was my first time making crepes and it was very easy. I served them with strawberry cream cheese, bananas, and a light drizzle of agave nectar on top. If only I had raspberries!  I took away a star because I had to thin out the batter a little. It was hard get it to coat the pan evenly before it started cooking.

PERFECT basic crepe recipe. If you want it a bit sweeter for dessert crepes, add some vanilla/sugar/cinnamon. I just recipe-tested myself into not going to our favorite French restaurant for dessert!

Delicious crepes, although I'm having problems figuring out how thin/thick they should be.

I sweetened mine up a tad with a 1/4 c. of sugar and a bit of vanilla.  This was the first time I've tried making crepes and they were very good!

So simple and delicious.  I too added some vanilla and a little cinnamon for a kick. While they were still warm i spread some peanut butter inside, rolled them up, and then drizzled choc sauce on top. SO GOOD

Delicious and super easy to make. I followed the directions exactly, and they came out great. I added diced ham and cheedar cheese to some (and could add pineapple to those), and then Nutella and bananas to others. My husband was in heaven. So good!

I just got back from France and have been on the look out for a good crêpe recipe.  This one is fantastic! I liked to poor the batter in a little thinner and let it crisp up, then added some ham and cheese and voila! perfectly authentic tasting crêpe! Thank you for the recipe!!

I love crepes and these are awesome! For crepe filling, I mixed 8 oz of Neufchatel cheese with 4 tbsp of sugar and heated blueberries (microwaved frozen blueberries). Then topped with homemade whipped cream. Another filling we tried which was good (not as good as the Neufchatel cheese, but still good) was vanilla yogurt and fresh fruit, and topped with homemade whipped cream. Either way, the crepes were quite tasty! the only change I made was to use grapeseed oil instead of butter, and it seemed fine!

A good, simple crepe batter. I added 2 T Gran Marnier, 2 T sugar and replaced the milk & water with 1/4 c half and half and 2 c water. Blend all wet ingredients before slowly adding flour. For a quick Crepes Suzette, heat equal parts of orange marmalade and water in a pan until melted to syrup consistency. Add Brandy or Grand marnier and serve.

It was a perfect recipe for perfect crepes.  it was my first attempt and they were beautiful and yummy.  Even my picky eater ate one.  I filled mine with 1 package of cream cheese, juice of one orange (lemon would taste nice too, but didn't have any), powdered sugar, a little milk (the cream cheese filling was cooked separately of course!).  then, i topped the crepes with blueberries that i cooked in water and splenda.  i thickened the blueberries with a little corn starch.  My husband devoured the crepes.  I can hardly wait to take this recipe to the beach with us this summer.  i tried to duplicated my favorite crepes from a breakfast restaurant that i frequent, but it was close enough.  enjoy!

I doubled this recipe, well not quite, I did not have enough eggs, so I just did half of everything.  Even though I beated it well in the mixer, it did turn out a bit lumpy, oh well, It is a very simple recipe and easy to follow, I will just put some blueberries in it or some fruit.  I also added some drops of vanilla extract, because there was another recipe, vanilla crepe's and it was very good, vanilla gives it a little kick and makes it more interesting.

This sounded so easy and delicious that I was inspired to try it! I modified by using a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder and some cinnamon sprinkled in the flour, egg whites and replaced the butter with oil. Filled with bananas and apple cinnamon nut clusters and some no carb Walden Farms pancake syrup. YUM!!!! REALLY GOOD! Next time I will try to replace the flour with protein powder to see if I get an equally good result.

I made these today -- followed the instructions, even added the eggs to the flour and then thinned the resultant mass with the milk and water.    Because the batter was quite thin before I finished adding the liquid, I left out a scan 1/4 C of the liquid and it turned out great.  I am letting most of the batter rest in the fridge for a few hours and will add more liquid if it's too thick at that point.  Since I'm making sweet crepes, I also added about a tablespoon of sugar.  Delicious!

I made this recipe last night, and they turned out beautifully.  I would like to try a slight variation the next time, but I don't know yet if they will turn out well.  I'm going to try 1.5 cups milk, 1 tsp white sugar and just a pinch of salt, as I found these a bit salty for my taste in crepes.  I'll let you know how they turn out, but I did find this to be a great basic recipe.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if the directions were correct.  Definitely put the wet ingredients all together first.  I made home made manicotti with the crepes... yummy, my family thinks they are better than any restaurant!!

Very nicely put together. I haven't done crepes before and had them come out great. For those who want to add a bit to the flavor while keeping it simple add 1/4 or 1/8 (depending on taste) teaspoon of vanilla per serving to the batter.

WOW is all I can say. I did as others suggested and mixed all the wet ingredients before adding flour. I also added vanilla to sweeten them up. I heated up some sliced apples, butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in another pan to fill the crepes with and then put cool whip on top. YUM!

the construction of this recipe is backwards. The best method, I've found, is to combine the liquids except for the melted butter. Next, add the flour to the mixture 1 part at a time with an electric mixer. Once the batter is smooth add the melted butter. Perfect every time for me.

I used gluten-free flour to make these and they turned out really well. Like other reviewers, I added a little sugar and vanilla to the basic recipe. I also added the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.Great recipe.Thanks.

This is a fantastic recipe, and will be keeping it for future uses.  I strongly suggest not mixing the flour and egg together to start, because it will just be clumped, it was a mess.

Thank you for this easy recipe. I was looking for something that I didn't have to go out and buy ingredients for. I already had everything for this. The only thing was that it needed something more to make it sweeter, you can do anything with them! Awesome breakfast staple, I'm gonna use this recipe when i go to college =)

Very easy crepes!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  For the next time, I would add some flavor such as sugar for sweet/crispy crepes and herbs for salty crepes.

Very good, time time consuming part is frying them one at a time like pancakes, only much faster. Batter in swirl in pan set, flip, set, out; family sneaks over shoulder and swipes. the swiping makes it hard to get a stack, but they all got fed, even if it was not at the table with the balanced meal I planned; it was fun.

I love these crepes, and my friends and family love them! I add a bit of vanilla (probably about 3/4 of a tsp...I just eyeball it) and about probably 1/8 of a cup of powdered sugar. I found that when I found the directions and mixed the flour and eggs first, it was very lumpy, so I just dump everything into a bowl and use a wire whisk. There are still some lumps, but it's still delicious! I really recommend this recipe, it's fabulous!

My husband has been making these for over 50 yrs. He makes the crepes & I make the home made jam. Works great. Biggest secret to crepes is to not let the batter get too thick. A dusting of Powdered sugar is a must after the roll up. Enjoy.

Loved it. My favorite filling in the world is a mix with small curd cottage cheese and raspberry jam (or whatever). SO good. jam is too sweet for me, and the cottage cheese calms it down. Then, i put a bit of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of a baking dish, put rolled crepes in there side by side and put some more cream on top of them and then stick them in 375 oven for 20-30  minutes (careful not to burn them. if they dry out, put a little more cream). Be careful if you do this because the cream 'calms down' the jam too and then it tastes too bland. So if you do this, make the filling sweeter than you like and then it should be fine. These crepes were awesome though! my first attempt!

These are so quick and easy and taste great too!  I find that they spread better in the pan if I make the mix the night before, refrigerate, and then cook them in the morning while the mix is cold.  I add a tsp of vanilla to the mix, also.

Wasn't very good. The batter either was sticky and tasted undercooked, or burned. Maybe I need a new stove? There was no perfect in between!

Great recipe, especially after reading the suggestion to mix the wet ingredients first and then sift the dry ingredients into the wet mixture as you whisk.

I make these all the time.  My husband loves them.  I top them with powdered sugar.  But the crepe recipe is excellent.  I use a crepe pan, which makes it easier to cook.

Great starter, the basics are there and can be modified to suit the crepe you are making.  Makes adequately thin crepes with minimal effort.

I used olive oil instead of butter (too lazy to run to the store), but then used butter spray on the pan.  Came out GREAT! :-)

I love this recipe! I've never made crepes before and this makes me look like an expert! I will say that it works better to add dry ingredients slowly (and sifted if you can) to your wet ingredients. Excellent!

This is a great and easy crepe recipe! I never thought making crepes at home could be so easy! The batter is storable for use for a few days.. I added some vanilla extract and it smells great too. Thanks! now I'm making crepes every day..

Great Recipe! I had no idea these were so simple. I have 7 kids and we were tiring of the waffle-french toast-pancake routine. I made extra and we used them later in the day to wrap ham & swiss roll-ups. I added a little oregano & dijon...5 stars for sure!

i've never made a crepe (or anything else) in my life and although my first attempt was horrible because it was too thick, the 2nd time i did exactly 1/4 mixture and it turned out great! took me more then 2 minutes, but the extra time was well worth it! awesome and simple recipe!

Nice batter - does not stick to the pan - very easy to work with. Batter does not need to rest like many other crepe batters. Thanks so much to the cook who first posted it.

Very simple recipe to follow and basic ingredients.  It makes your family impressed by your cooking talents, when it's actually very easy to do.  Tastes good too.  I made a whipped cream filling, sprinkled the crepe with powedered sugar and poured a hot blueberry compote over the top.  It came out very well.

Excellent and easy.  I tripled the recipie and finally quit cooking when I had over 35 crepes. I also mixed the wet ingredients and dry seperately and then whisked together. I added about 3/4 c. sugar and about 3/4 c. powdered sugar (to the TRIPLED recipie) as another reviewer suggested and they were awesome.

Family loves them - Nutella (chocolate/hazelnut) spread is a must for these as dessert crepes.  Husband just bought a Costco supply of Nutella as a strong hint for me to make these more often!!

After reading many reviews and seeing that everyone does something different with these crepes, I was inspired and just slightly confused! Lol..So i did my own thing too. I love vanilla extract, so i added 1 1/2 teas. of it along with about a quarter cup granulated sugar. I mixed wet ingredients with dry, against the advise of many reviewers and it still came out fine. I filled mine with cream cheese and sweetened strawberries then sprinkled with powdered sugar. They were absolutely fabulous!

These are amazing! I've tried a few other recipes but they all have a flat, boring flavor, unlike these crepes. I mixed the flour, water and milk together before adding the eggs, which made the batter smoother, and added cinnamon, which tasted great!

These were great and pretty easy-especially as it was my first time making crepes.  We made them for "Pancake Day" (DH is from the UK).  Served some of them with sugar and lemon juice (YUM!) and the others filled with sauteed spinach and swiss cheese.  They were great!

These are great and very versatile. I like mine with jam, whipped cream and powdered sugar for a quick simple breakfast.

Such a great, simple but tasty recipe! We tried a bunch of topping and our favorites were lemon juice sprinkled with sugar or drizzled chocolate with powdered sugar. Mmm, good!

Very good recipe. The batter was a little too thick for my liking so I added a little bit more water. I also added 2 Tbsp. of sugar to sweeten it up a bit. Very easy and delicious.

Excellent crepes.  As others suggested, I added a tsp of vanilla and a few tsp's of sugar to make dessert crepes and they turned out perfectly!

Super easy to make and tasted just how I remember a crepe should taste.  I had been craving them so I halved the recipe and made it for myself for breakfast one morning.  I filled my crepes with some defrosted frozen raspberries and fresh sliced bananna.  I topped them with some light whipped cream.  They were SO good!

This was the best crepe recipe that I have ever tried. Easy** Yummy** The butter that was called for in the recipe was lumpy in the batter.. I worried.. the batter hit the pan and melted making a delicous no stick treat. I would add vanilla for a deseret crepe..

Great recipe, easy to make! I mixed all the wet ingredients except for the melted butter then I gradually added the flour. I added the melted butter last. I had crepes for breakfast this morning and it turned out perfect. I added 1/3 of granulated sugar to make it sweeter and used Nutella hazelnut spread for the filling. My daughter loves it!

I made this recipe on a cold winter day while one family member was out on a walk. My dad and I loved it but when my mom got home and gave it a try thought these crepes were nothing like on you would get in Europ. Overall, great taste but need to have a thinner batter. Also, as others have said they were a it eggy. DON"T mix flour and water first if you do you'll get a lumpy mess! Try putting apples and cinnomon on them!

Seriously, I only made these, like, a half-hour ago, and my Mom and picky little sister LOVED them!

I did as advised in other reviews- wet stuff first and then flour- and they turned out fine. I also let them sit in the fridge for about 10 minutes, and the coldness didn't effect them. Texture was fine, everything was fine, this recipe was great!

I, myself, as a young chef, just need to work on evening out the batter more and not letting the crêpes brown as much. I topped mine with strawberries and whipped cream and they were fantastic.

Thanks for your recipe; I can shape it up for myself now!

Double the recipe!!!!!
The first time I used this recipe, I was disappointed by how little it yielded! I had to go back and make a second set immediately because people were hungry! This is not enough for even a couple. I also didn't really like the texture of the first set. The second set came out MUCH better! Maybe because I was in a hurry nd just threw everything into the mixing bowl, so I could finish quickly. So my advice? Double the recipe, and just blend all the ingredients together :-)

My kids love this receipe, it's super easy and a nice change from heavy pancakes - I sneak in wheat germ to make it a little healthy.  I have also snuck in sweetened shredded coconut for a dessert wrap (bananas foster) with sliced strawberries.

Wow I can't believe how easy it was to make. I used apple pie filling for the middle and topped with whipped cream. My husband has a major sweet tooth and requsted next time I add a little sugar in the batter. This recipe is great.

These are so nice!  My 12yo daughter made them for lunch and we filled them with sauteed in butter and cinnamon apples, and added apple sauce to stretch.  She's now making them again for supper and we'll fill them with the lemon creme recipe that is also on this site.  YUM!

A simple crepe recipe that does the trick.  I might cut out some of the flour next time since it was a little thick and we needed to add extra milk.

I added vanilla and sugar to the recipe to make it a little sweeter. We had them for brunch with strawberries, bananas and cool whip. Very easy to make! I followed other suggestions to mix wet then add dry ingredients and the batter came out nice and smooth.

These were yummy and so easy to make. I chose this recipe becuase it was simpler than my Betty Crocker cookbook recipe was! I added lemon and powered sugar for Easter brunch and will be making these again.

These were pretty good!  I like to think of these crepes as "American style" because they aren't exactly the same as French crepes.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this recipe and will use only this one from now on.  I like my crepes a little thicker (and eggy) so I added an extra egg to the recipe.  It tasted wonderful!

I added a bit of sugar to give it a hint of sweetness.  Crepes came out pretty thin, instead of pancake-like (which is good).  I couldn't get all of the lumps out though.  Maybe I just didn't stir enough.  Overall, pretty good.

Easy enough for my 11 year old to make. She loves them sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Her Dad and I love them with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  The possibilities are endless. Yummy!

Super good.  I have the same recommendation as the previous poster...mix liquids first and then add the flour and egg.  The crepes turned out fine (very buttery) but they did have little lumps from the mixing of the egg and flour.  Very good.  I'm going to go buy some Nutella sauce today!

My mom made these for a bridal show and it was AWESOME! I'm fifteen and it's really easy to make, I even fried it or whatever you call it! Just mix the ingrediants exactly like it tells you and add a tablespoon of sugar to sweeten it like one of the reviews said. Everyone brought stuff to top the crepes with like whipped cream, cocktail fruits from the cans, cinnamon, and syrup. 

One of the ladies there was from South Africa and she told us they ate crepes there by sprinkling sugar and cinnamon on them. She said they put them on top of each other to steam in a pot so it turns into a kind of syrup and drizzle lemon juice on. I never tried it but it sounds delicious.

This was a much better recipe than the one that came with my crepe maker.  I will use it from now on.  Perfect consistency.  I add a little vanilla extract, and I had no need for any sugar even for a desert crepe.  Loved it!  :-)

I made these EXACTLY as the recipe stated. They LOOKED great.  But I didn't really like these, but I am giving it a  because my fiance liked them. Something just wasn't right about the crepes- they didn't have the nice consistency REAL crepes have. Tasted just bland to me. Fiance said they tasted good but he will eat any crepe.

Perfect, easy, yummy.  These are just like the crepes my Mom would make every Sunday morning.  We add "different" fillings to our crepes........sour cream in the middle, and top them with syrup.  YUMMY!  If you like sour cream then you gotta try this.

This is the exact recipe in my Salton crepe maker booklet. I have found that mixing it in the blender eliminates lumps. When doubling the recipe, I don't double the butter, or it is so greasy the batter won't adhere to my crepe maker, for some reason

These were quick and simple.  I used them to recreate a dish from a local restaurant called "Chicken & Spinach Manicotti".

I normally can't eat homemade crepes because of the eggy flavour, but these are light and delicious without that!

This is so easy and delicious! It has become a staple in our household. If I'm making it for dessert, I add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1/4 tsp of vanilla, and a pinch of cinnamon. They're really great with anything!

I should have added a touch more milk. They were a little on the thick side. We filled them with homemade triple berry jam. My 7 year old loved them, the 3 year old wanted regular pancakes.

A awesome and simple crepe recipe! However, is there any way that I can make my crepe slightly more crispy? My housemates loved it and the saltiness of the crepe is just right. Goes wonderfully as a savory or sweet crepe.

A very good, simple crepe recipe.
Came out a bit thick here at 6000 ft. altitude.
Next time I will withhold some flour, and add it slowly to get desired consistency.

This was simply amazing. I had chocolate/banana crepes at this expensive French themed breakfast place, and let me tell you, these crepes tastes identical or possibly better than the $6.50 ones from that restaurant. My family and I loved it. It hit the spot, I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe.  I did add 1/4 tsp sugar, used 1/3 cup per crepe and generated 9 crepes.  Followed others and mixed milk, water, vanilla together before mixing alternately into egg batter with flour.  For filling we used fresh rasperries (simmered with a pinch of sugar and drained), pineapple topping from grocery store, bananas cooked with butter and brown sugar with a drizzle of fresh, melted chocolate.  Definately a hit!

Tasted great with nutella and bananas. The portion size is modest, though, if you're going for French-sized crepes!

Absolutely FANTAbulous!! LOOOOOVVEED these! We had them with a bit of nutella and a tiny bit of Smart Balance ( which is soo much healthier by the way!) I had to add a bit more milk to thin it out a little though. My husband and I frequently go to Quebec and have crepes all the time and these were comparable, my husband said even better!!! Definitely a keeper and a great and easy recipe to entertain and impress!!! YUMMM

This recipe was fabulous. It was so easy and turned out really moist. For filling, I used 3 peeled and sliced peaches, 1/4 C butter and 1/4 C brown sugar. I cooked over medium heat until peaches were tender and sauce had thickened. After the sauce cooled slightly and thickened even more, I filled 4 crepes, added a dollup of fresh whipped cream on top and dusted with a little powdered sugar. It was sooooooo easy and tasted absolutely amazing!!!

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!  It was so easy to prepare the crepes, and they are so delicious!  I added a dash of vanilla to the batter, and served sliced strawberries and bananas, as well as a little light chocolate syrup and lite cool-whip inside.  Fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG!  This is a great recipe:)  Never had crepes before, but not going to ever stop now!!  I made these, but added 2 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla, like others have advised.  Took some melted choclate and spread in center of cooked crepe and laid bananas along the center.  Dusted with powdered sugar, closed it up, dusted with more powdered sugar, dribbled more chocolate on outside of the crepe and decorated the plate with some canned whipped cream.  OMG!  It was fantastic and totally going to a new addition to my cookbook!!  Thanks so much!!

Very good crepe recipe! They looked just the way I remembered them from a fabulous little crepe resturaunt in San Francisco on the wharf. Very easy too! Anyone can make these. I filled them with a spinach, feta & pine nut filling I made up, then used a leftover one for fruit & cream the next morning. Yum!

Excellent.  I don't have a griddle so I used a non-stick pan instead and worked well.  I put chocolate chips and all the fruit I had and my family loved it.  Next time I'd replace the choc. chips with icing sugar, to make it more healthy.

These are great! I was surprised to learn that crepes are incredibly easy to make.  They're also fun to try to think up different fillings for them.  My husband likes making these for dinner recipes and I like using them for desserts!

I've always been intimidated to make crepes because they seemed so difficult, boy was I wrong! I served them with prociutto cotto, besciamel (a light cream sauce) and pistacchios and received rave reviews.

I was floored at how easy and delicious these crepes were! I modified a bit: + 1tbs of sugar & 1/4 cup more water(I found them to be a bit too thick). Last night I tested, and tonight I have friends comming over for a crepe escape dinner. Thank you!

I didn't expect to have much luck since I don't have a good non-stick pan and had to use my griddle (difficult to maneuver), but these turned out really well! I spread them out with the back of a spoon. The only thing I put in them was grape jelly, which melts and spreads nice & thin. 
Yum! My finicky toddler even ate one!

I have made crepes before, and these were the fastest and easiest crepes I have made.  My 21 yr old son was even able to make them with great success.  They were a big hit.  If you like a sweeter or dessert crepe, you can add vanilla and confectioners sugar to the batter without changing the crepes texture or ease.  Thanx Jen for a fabulous recipe.

Very easy to make, delicious!  I used soymilk and margarine, and put sliced strawberries and powdered sugar on top.

I also used this recipe to teach 40 Japanese high school seniors how to make crepes.  The students loved it and their crepes turned out great!  I changed my rating to 5 stars because this crepe recipe really is "the Best!".

Great recipe.  I had leftover scrambled eggs and got the idea from a restaurant commercial (happens to be one of my husband's favorite non-pancake breakfasts).  I followed the crepe recipe exactly, and meanwhile cooked some chopped bacon and deli smoked turkey together (its what I had), set that to drain and used the grease for a roux based cheese sauce (milk, velveeta and cheddar - again - what I had).  I then nuked my eggs and folded in the meat and enough cheese to our liking.  I spooned this mix down the middle of these incredible (and unlike other recipes - sturdy) crepes, covered w/grated cheese and nuked just to start the cheese melting.  My husband says they're better than restaurant. I love them - seems complex, but was surprisingly fast and easy.  This is the only crepe recipe I would use. Others are too delicate or too gummy.

Had trouble flipping the first one, but the rest were SO easy.  You may have to wait more than two minutes before it's ready to flip.  These are yummy with or without additions.

I needed to try a couple of times till I could make it thin and circle but I got the hang of it by the 3rd or 4th one. I served this for valentines day with strawberries, bananas, whipcream and chocolate syrup! It was very good.

Great recipe. So EASY to make, I had never made a crepe before, and always thought it would be hard. I was wrong. Next time I will add some vanilla and sugar to the batter for more taste, but I served them with the sautéed apples also from this sight and some vanilla ice cream.... AMAZING!!!

Pretty good recipe! It was my first time to make my own crepes. I added a bit of sugar and nutmeg and when they were cooked I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some fresh mango cubes...  DELICIOUS!

Since my grandma was French Canadian I grew up eating these instead of the big stack of pancakes.  To this day I do not like pancakes.  These crepes taste just like grandma used to make.  Light and crispy.  The best way to eat them is to just sprinkle some sugar on them, roll em up, and eat!  No need for the fruit, syrup, etc.  Yum!!

Makes excellent crepes. I added some sugar, vanilla, and a sprinkle of nutmeg per other reviews. Adding these items makes an excellent dessert crepe. This recipe, or any other crepe, works wonders if you own a crepe maker as opposed to using a griddle or pan. Inexpensive investment that will make crepes even better and easier.

Excellent, easy recipe. I used a good pan and had no trouble with sticking, flipping was easy. Once you let the batter set, just before flipping, I like to shake the pan hard to loosen the crepe, that makes it easier to flip. I served these with a savory filling with success, but I think I would like to have them next time with fruit and powdered sugar!!

Used this as my 'something special' at Easter brunch.  AMAZING! Served w/ banana cream pudding, strawberries, and whipped cream.  Complete success!  Had my mother-in-law begging for the recipe!

Very good basic recipe!  I use all the same ingredients, but I add 1 TBSP of sugar to my batter.  Otherwise, they taste a little bland to me.
