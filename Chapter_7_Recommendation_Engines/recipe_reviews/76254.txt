I enjoyed this stir fry. I did make a few changes. I left out the peppers and added in broccoli, shredded carrots and water chestnuts. I also added in a bit more soy sauce. This isn't the traditional lemon chicken I was looking for, but it is very tasty. Next time I think I'll add a few red pepper flakes as well.

This recipe is one of the very few that my whole family enjoys.  My daughter loves to wrap the chicken and rice up in tortilla shells.  It is also great as leftovers the next day, if your lucky enough to have any left!

Delish...Everyone liked it, even my 5 year old son who eats nothing. More like a brown sauce then the traditional lemony glaze of lemon chicken that I am used to, but very good nonetheless.

Very delicious, I also liked the fact that it didn't long to prepare. It was a big hit with the entire family. The only part of this recipe I would alter, less soysauce.

This recipe was ok, it started out too sour so I added 2T of brown sugar to balance the sweet and sour.  I probably won't make it again.

Very good.  I would probably make this again.  Maybe next time less soy sauce, some grated lemon rind, a little more Splenda, and a bit of hot pepper.
