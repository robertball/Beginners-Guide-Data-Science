I am called "THE BAKER" by friends and family....NEVER, NEVER, NEVER have I received so many compliments on, and recipe requests as I have for these delicious bars.  I've made them 4 times in 2 weeks !   I used currants because didn't have any dates--worked fine.  Also--using quality cinnamon (and adding extra) brought many inquires as to the "special ingredient" in the icing.    Thanks for a new favorite !!!

Very moist. I added cranberries (dried) because I didn't have dates and added chocolate chips. I would not do cranberries again but otherwise very good!

Four stars instead of five for two reasons: These are definitely not "cookie bars"...it's cake.  Second, I didn't necessarily care for the dried fruit...it wasn't bad, just not my favorite addition.  I'm absolutely making it again, but next time I'm dropping the raisins and dates, baking it in cake pans, and trying it topped with some sort of coconut pecan-type icing.  I think that would be out of this world!  All in all, if you're a fan of zucchini bread/cake, this is definitely worth trying!  (By the way, I made a half batch in a square pan, and 30 minutes was a perfect baking time.)

this recipe is FANTASTIC! it was very moist and delicious. i loved and so did my entire family, they were very skeptical at first when i told them it had zucchini in it (i'm the health nut in the family) but they ended up loveing it. i did not use the icing and used regular butter instead of margerine it was fine without it. i also omitted the raisins,dates and nuts, and instead added chocolate chips to half. very good, i will definitly be making this again!  fyi it's more like a moist cake than a "cookie bar" like the recipe says but definitly worth making

These are very good.  I omitted the fruits and nuts, increased the coconut just a little, and added 1 C choc chips to the batter.  Then I scattered some chips on the top after baking.  Will be making this one again.

These had really good flavor, but are more like a cake than bars.  The coconut flavor is subtle, but present though the icing makes them a little too sweet and distracts from the yummy flavors.  They are very light and fluffly and not as dense as I think bars typically are.  Also, to get the nutrition value that is stated in the recipe the bars are pretty small for a serving.   You would most likely eat 2-3 times that for a normal size serving.

These bars are EXCELLENT!  They are bars--not cake and the "icing" is actually a glaze.  I've made them twice, both times to RAVE reviews.  I left out the dates, used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon in the glaze, and sprinkled with finely chopped pecans vice walnuts.  Make sure to cool completely before cutting.  5-stars for sure!!

Another great way to use zucchini. We didn't make the the glaze because the sweetness would've been overkill. I used half a cup of apple sauce and only a quarter cup of margarine, also reduced the sugar to a total of 3/4 cup (even down to half a cup probably would've been fine as they were still quite sweet). I decided to add the cinnamon to the bars as I wasn't using the glaze. I think the raisins or dates could've been omitted, but that's just personal preference. My son loves these!

This is so good!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe is and it's moist, sweet, a little chewy with the dates and the coconut justs adds that little something extra.  I will definitely make these again.  Next time though, I'll probably just put the nuts in the batter and then bake.  The nuts look pretty on top if I was taking them over to a friends or for something special, but just for at home, I'll add them.  Thank you!!!

Thank you for a GREAT recipe!  Looking for another recipe to use up the zucchini from my garden I gave this one a try.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup greek yogurt in place of the margarine.  I didn't have dates, so I used dried cranberries and I added 3/4 cup chocolate chips!  Fabulous!  I did NOT make the icing, the chocolate chips gave it the additional kick needed.  I made a triple batch the first day and I'll be making more.  Cut them and they freeze well.

My new favourite zucchini recipe! The glaze makes a special touch. I left out the dates, but this would be great with carrotts if zucchini are not in season. Will make again and again....

these were good but won't make again. i was looking for a "homerun" recipe & this was only a single or a double. shared with a large group of people..not 1 person asked for the recipe. but was still a fun recipe to try. do NOT omit the topping. that was the best part.

Yum! Like others have said, it does seem a bit more cake-like than cookie. Really, just drop "cookie" from the title and it's fitting: a bar. A tasty one! I omitted the dates, simply because I didn't have them. They baked beautifully in about 30 minutes. The glaze is wonderful and I love the addition of *toasted* nuts to the top. I almost added some to the batter, and I'm glad I didn't. **Also used butter, not margarine. Good, tasty treat!

These bars are very tasty and sweet.  I love all the fruits in them, and if kids like those ingredients, then they'll love em too!  I only made half a batch (using a bread loaf pan) and they turned out great, except the frosting was VERY runny - I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but i doubled the amount of powdered sugar to make it a little thicker.

This is not a cookie bar, more of a cake, but it is fantastic! Everyone raved about it and wanted recipe. I didn't use the frosting recipe here, but instead used a coconut-cream cheese frosting recipe also on Allrecipes.com. Then topped with toasted coconut, it was sooooooo good! Also, I omitted the raisins and dates, but added walnuts in the cake, made it really good. I will definitely make this again!

These cookie bars are super good.  I have been making zucchini bread for years, decided I wanted to try these as something different.  My family loves them.  They taste like something my grandma would make, can't beat that.

These are good, but definitely need chocolate chips!! Used choc chips instead of dates. Is more of a cake than a bar, but very good flavor. I wondewr what it would be like baked in a loaf or bundt pan?  I added  some cinnamon (~1/2 tsp) to the batter and it was very good, plus doubled the cinnamon in the icing" -skipped the margarine in the icing too- just need vanilla, p. sugar, cinnamon and milk. yummy!

We loved these; the coconut-zucchini-date mix was surprisingly yummy. The kid who mows the lawn claimed to not like zucs but then asked for more. I omitted the raisins, put the walnuts and cinnamon right in the bars, and skipped the frosting. Mine were halfway between a cookie and cake. They stayed moist for three days, and probably would have stored well, if we hadn't eaten the all!

Love, love, love these bars.  My favorite zucchini bars ever.  I left out the dates as I don't care for them but otherwise left everything else as is.

These were not very good at all.  I omitted the raisins and dried fruit and substituted choc. chips.  They were dry and not a very good taste.

Very good recipe, but I have changed the name in my recipe box to just "Zucchini Cake."  The texture is definitely more like a cake than a cookie or bar.  Also, I loved all the additions including the coconut, raisins, and dates, but I didn't feel the coconut stood out enough to be included in the title.  Nonetheless, I loved the recipe - very tasty and even my 3 year-old who refuses to touch anything with zucchini loves this!

I made this recipe with a few modifications.  I only used 1 small box of raisins and a whole 16oz. bag of dates (cut in half).  Didn't have enough powdered sugar so I mixed the cinnamon in the batter and then sprinkled the bars with powdered sugar when they cooled. They turned out really well.

These bars were delicious and moist, more like a piece of cake.  I loved the combination of fruits and coconut.  I didn't have enough zucchini, so I used summer squash.  When it comes to summer-type squash, it's very interchangeable.  You have to at least double the amount of frosting if you want to taste it.

this was a great "cake".  I added choc. chips per the reviews,  but that was a bad idea-the two flavors did not mix.  I made it again-per the recipe-only adding some cinnamon and allspice to the mix,  and it turned out great!  Thanks

It is cake like which I'm glad of.  I squeezed the zuchinni to remove excess water from it. I also added 1tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1\2 tsp Chinese 5 spice .  I did do the glaze but only used half of it, just personal taste. Neighbors loved it.

I put this recipe in the coffee cake category. My husband loves it for breakfast with his coffee. It’s very easy to make, and will keep about a week if it’s wrapped in plastic and kept in an air tight container. Definitely a keeper!

One of the best recipes I've made with my garden zucchini. And it was very hard to surpas the zucchini chocolate cake.  I skipped the topping and put the nuts inside this time. One time I frosted with German Chocolate Frosting. It was  marvelous. 

Brought it to a party and now emailing the receipe to many.

This bar is soooo good.   I did substitute all purpose flour with whole wheat flour, butter for margarine,  coconut sugar for regular sugar and I used almonds instead of walnuts.   The bars were gone before I could say Zucchini Coconut Cookie Bars.   

This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really squeezed the zucchini dry first. Used gluten-free flour. I thought they were kinda crumbly, but they got rave reviews when I brought them to work.

This was amazing. So moist and the icing really topped it off. I did not have dates so I omitted them and added chocolate chips. I also increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and used almonds instead of walnuts.

Made gluten-free version using a mix of bob's red mill GF flour and coconut flour. Used 1/2 cup of butter and substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for the remaining 1/4 cup of butter. Next time I will use coconut oil instead of butter. Omitted dried fruits and added chocolate chips. Absolutely delicious!

I am giving this recipe four stars because the instructions are clear and easy to follow and is such a treat! I had to make a few modifications due to my health concerns. I've made this recipe twice now;the first time, I only substituted the 3/4 c. w/about a cup of pure canned pumpkin. I found it to be very sweet and did not bother with the glaze icing. Last night, I modified the 1/2 c. white sugar + 1/2 c. brown sugar- and only used 1/4 c. of Splenda (I really wanted to try coconut sugar but did not have any on hand.) Also, instead of the 3/4 c. Margarine, I used about 1 c. canned pure pumpkin. Instead of all-purpose four, I used half white whole wheat and whole wheat four. I did not have raisins on hand and used currants instead. For the icing, I used an old recipe and creamed some light Country Crock butter, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and Splenda and sprinkled toasted walnuts (a must!) on top. The end product is bar-like and moist. I appreciate this recipe because it is easy to follow and because you can't go wrong with dates, raisins, coconut, and zucchini in a mix!

Pretty good flavor and very moist. I didn't have raisins so I added some mini chocolate chips which were good. Probably won't make again as it was definately very cakey - I was looking for something more like a chewy bar. Took these to work and most people seemed to like them, although I wasn't that impressed.

These came out really well for me.  They are cakey, as others have said, but moist, not dry.  I added 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, and I'm glad I did; I don't think the chocolate flavor clashed with the fruity elements.  I also added 1.5-2 tablespoons extra confectioners' sugar to the icing to thicken it a little.  I don't think the walnuts added much other than a nice crunch, though I did forget to toast them, as others have suggested.

I apologize for changing ingredients, but when I don't like a certain something, I'll substitute.   In this recipe, I omitted dates and raisins and used walnuts and also added about 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips.  I also used 1/4 cup applesauce for some of the margarine.  For the icing, instead of vanilla, I used some coconut syrup that I use for making frappucinos.   It baked nice and moist with great flavor.  I love it because it's another zucchini recipe that I can make ahead and freeze.

It isn't bad.. but I had to cook it much longer than it said, and maybe you should put a note about the consistency that the zucchini should be. It's terribly difficult to actually grate a zucchini (at least the massive zucchinis that tend to be forgotten about in my garden..) so i used a processor which may have made it too watery, which is my own fault. I think it's necessary to use the glaze (I wasn't going to as my mom's on a diet and it makes it a relatively healthy dessert without it), because otherwise it doesn't taste like much. BUT it is something to do with all those zucchinis we have massing about our kitchen, and the many loaves of bread in the freezers =]

This got mixed reviews from my eaters :)   It tastes all right, but the texture is just not pleasant.  As other reviewers noted, this is NOT a cookie bar - it's like a bread.  Mine came out very spongy, but I don't think I can blame that on the recipe since I modified it heavily. I put dried apricots, raisins, and orange zest and left out the prunes & icing.  I also used 3/4 cup of brown sugar total, to replace the mixture of  white and brown sugar. 

Next time around I will drain the zucchini in cheesecloth with a little sugar first for an hour to dry it out, and I'll use 1 cup of brown sugar.  I'm keeping the apricots in for sure - they add a wonderful sweetness and flavor to the bread.

These bars were MUCH too rich. 
I'm sure the fat intake is twice what I eat per day. 
I didn't care for them.

These cakey bars are a wonderful outlet for an overzealous zucchini plant!

i tried this recipe but making some differences. I used olive oil instead of margarine. I used only 1/2 cup white sugar and used 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar for icing. The taste was very different from the other kinds. Altough i used half of the reccomended sugar amount, it tastes rather sweety. thank you for the recipe.

Good recipe! Changes:  The frosting is too thin..add more powered sugar. And put the nuts inside the cake instead of on the top. It tasted much better refrigerated. Cut in small squares because it is rich. I used butter instead of margerine. Everyone loved it. Half a recipe (cuts small works best for us)

Very tasty and extremely addictive, but like another reviewer mentioned, it really is more like a cake. A good way to sneak in some extra veggies.

My husband and I loved these bars.  They were moist and the walnuts added a nice crunch to the topping.  This is definately a keeper.

I don't like dates so I used pecans instead.

This recipe was very good but it disappointed me a little bit. It was more like a cake instead of brownie or cookie bar. I also could have used lots more icing since I thought it was more cake-like.

THIS IS REALLY GOOD. I BROUGHT IT TO THE GIRLS AT WORK, AND THEY LOVED IT.
IT IS KIND OF CRUMBLY LIKE A COOKIE, BUT LOOKS LIKE A BAR. 
I DIDN'T HAVE DATES, SO I JUST PUT IN RAISINS AND CHOCOLATE CHIPS.
IT WAS VERY MOIST!!

I thought this was a great recipe!  It was only a bit too rich, but I cut the butter down anyway.  What a great recipe, though!

These bars are an absolute delight! I took them to work and shared them with my co-workers and they gobbled it up like crazy, even a person who does not like cake will love these!
