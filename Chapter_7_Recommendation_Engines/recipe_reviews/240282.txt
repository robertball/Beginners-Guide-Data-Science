This is a wonderfully, unexpected combination of ingredients that was so great.  My changes were that I used the immersion blender but left a lot of the veggies chunky.  I thought it would be strange if it were a creamy soup except for beans.  So I went with my gut and it was spot on. I also doubled the recipe but used two cans of tomatoes and one can of water.  I served this with garlic ciabatta bread with melted Fontina on top.

I do like this soup. I thought perhaps I might need to add a touch more salt or garlic next time but after having it sit overnight and eating a big bowl for lunch I think I like it just the way it is! Great way to use up vegetables!

A very nice soup for fall.  It tastes like a sweet tomato soup and the texture is similar to lentil..at least that's how it turned out.  I didn't have yellow onion so i substituted red and I accidentally left out the garlic.  I also didn't have an immersion blender so I used a food processor instead.  It tastes great!  I'm excited to eat it for lunch this week.

We liked this, but I did make several changes. I didn't have sweet potato, so I used a regular potato instead. We also had a bunch of garden tomatoes, so I just diced a few of those in place of the canned tomatoes. I didn't have leeks or spinach, so I omitted those. I also used chicken stock in place of the water. I added a little too much liquid,  so I pureed some extra chickpeas with the soup to thicken it. I probably won't make this often, but it was a yummy way to use my garden.
