This was the first recipe I used on allrecipes, and what a great choice! I substituted carrots, with onions. And used low fat milk. The broccoli was AMAZING! It soaked up the sauce and tasted wonderful. However, because it soaked up so much of the sauce, there wasn't much left! Next time I will use one and a half cans. Regardless, it came out great!

I was absolutely NOT impressed with this recipe.  I followed the directions to the letter.  Just not my cup o' tea, I guess.  Very bland.

This is one of my favorite dinners. I have made it a ton of times. I like it because you can change the veggies to what your family will eat.

Very Good!  The only change I made was that I used Cream of Chicken because I did not have Cream of Celery soup.  It tasted wonderful!  For veggies I used green, red, and yellow peppers, onions & broccoli.  Also, I pre-mixed and heated the cream of chicken, milk, garlic mixture on it's own.  I also stir fried the veggies on their own before mixing them with the chicken.  
Load the rice onto a plate, pour the creamy mixture over the rice, add your veggies and you're done.  A quick, inexpensive, and healthy meal! Made even healthier if you use low sodium soup.  Enjoy.

This strifry was lovely. My family has some picky eaters, but the creamyness of the sauce took light away from the fact that it has lots of good veggies. I did more than 4 servings so I just uped the milk to a whole cup and more veggies, and added some paprika and pepper. There were no leftovers (which is rare) and really easy to make which is also rare. This recipes will be making a apperance in this house again.

We really liked this recipe.  I improvised, using frozen mixed veggies and some cut up green bell pepper, a mixture of soy sauce and already-mixed stir-fry sauce, onion powder and pepper instead of the garlic powder, and warmed up leftover couscous instead of rice.  It still turned out really good!

This recipe was so easy yet incredibly delicious!  Although my daughter is not a picky eater, she rarely praises her meals; however, she couldn't stop raving about this dinner.  There weren't any leftovers with this one!  I will definitely make this time and time again!

I replaced the broccoli with green beans. I'm not a big fan of soggy broccoli. Lol. Also instead of using cream of celery, I used cream of mushroom. I also added yellow pepper for extra color, and onion. It came out delicious. Very satisfying. Will definitely make again.

This was very good! I had my doubts, but it turned out to be a keeper! I added a little more seasonings to my own taste, but it pleased everyone in my family. Quick, easy weeknight dinner!

This was a good recipe, but I think we need to experiment a bit to make it better.  The chicken was definitely a little bland when added in the direction of the recipe.  We might try again with tofu or leftover roasted chicken.

It was easy to make but it was nothing special. No one felt inclined to eat the leftovers.

This was a delicious dish.  I used a frozen stir-fry mix (carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts, peppers, baby corn, etc.) which made the prep easier and the cooking time faster.  I also added chopped green onions and 2 cloves of minced garlics.  My family really enjoyed this and it will definately be made again, maybe adding mushrooms and other veggies. The possibilities with this dish are endless!

It was okay, and was good for a Sunday night when we had to use the odds and ends we had in the pantry/fridge, but not something I'd make regularly ... pretty bland ... kicked it up w/ some crushed red pepper at the table ... :)
