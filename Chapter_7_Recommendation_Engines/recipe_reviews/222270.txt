I thought I would be daring and be the first to try a recipe.  The thought of mixing gingersnaps and rhubarb sounded really good, and it was.  I was lazy, so didn't do the crumb topping.  And I had no cashews, so I substituted walnuts.  The only thing I would change would be more rhubarb and less strawberry, maybe even try 100% rhubarb.  Also this recipe's cook/prep time is way off.  Mine was on desert plates within 2 hours of when I started to throw things in the mixing bowl.
