This was absolutely wonderful!   I had a box of yellow cake mix and cream cheese frosting that were expiring, so I put those two ingredients into allrecipes.com and this was the only recipe that came up.  It looked interesting, so I picked up the rest of the ingredients, and it was a huge hit with our guests!   It is moist and tasty.   I felt the coconut and pecans added the best flavor, and would not recommend omitting them.    Thank you for the recipe!

Perfect for our fall camping trip to the mountains! I included the optional pecans and coconut. It was moist and delicious. I would definitely make it again.

Made it exactly as written. The Hubster and I aren't all that into frosting so we didn't frost it. I'm glad we didn't. It's sweet enough without it. Delicious! It took 50 minutes to bake in my convection oven in a 9x13" pan.

Indeed, a very moist cake! Turned out I didn't have the coconut or pecans but it was very tasty without. Love that it uses butter instead of oil.
