Maybe Iâ€™m biased, once I tasted this dish I fell in love. I was normally a eggs and bacon guy but this changed things for me - I really mean changed things........they always say a way to a mans heart is through his stomach, well Leslie must have known this because I liked it so much I asked her to marry me. We are now happily married, biased I may be but I do know my wife is an excellent cook with a knack of combining multiple flavors to make a mouthwatering dish. Excellent tasty dish to tease every taste bud you might have.


I am a lucky man!!

OH MY GOODNESS!!! The best pork chops I have EVER EATEN!!! This was soooo yummy. Now I know why the last guy married Leslie!!! I made these for dinner tonight And it was an outstanding hit!! My husband and 13 month old son both loved it!!! I did the sauteed onions with the pork chops and served over dill rice (rice with butter and a tablespoon of dill) then poured the sauce over the pork chops.. I recommend you doubling the sauce recipe I wish I had!!! We ended up fighting over the last of the sauce.

This is a great twist on pork chops. The mixture of cayenne and strawberry preserves gave these chops excellent flavor. I poured the sauce on the chops after browning covered the skillet and reduced the heat to simmer. I turned the chops every 15 minutes or so and let them cook for about an hour. Cooking them this way allowed the flavors to permeate the meat and the chops were so tender we did not need a knife to cut them. This recipe will be one I use often.

I really liked this! I grilled the chops and I sauteed some diced red onion in butter before I added the rest of the ingredients. It was a cool change of pace--great summer dinner!

Hmm this dish is pretty good but it is missing something. I doubled this recipe and made everything as specified except that I rubbed salt on the pork chops along with the cayenne. The sauce was very tasty but the pork chops themselves were bland. Even though the sauce is poured on the chops and the sauce is flavorful it's not the same as having flavors infused in the meat. I think the chops need to be marinated in salt cayenne and probably something else. This dish also did not come out as tender and juicy as I like and I think it's because the pork did not cook in a sauce. So I'll make it again but I will make some changes next time. Still a good recipe though. Thanks!

I prepared this recipe initially for dinner and served it over lightly sauted pork chops. The strawberry sauce was exotic and distinctly asian in flavor and I have since had many repeat requests for this dish. This sauce makes for a great dipping sauce for chicken tenders or anytime you wish to spice things up. With a side dish of rice you are sure to be thrilled with the overall results.

This recipe sounds really wacky but it works well. I made this with raspberry jam instead. Only suggestion I would make would be to lightly fry the garlic first.

This was very tasty. I usually don't enjoy pork chops but I did with this recipe. I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to the sauce and subtituted low sugar smuckerers and added a pack of splenda. Yummy Yummy!

I didn't have any strawberry preserves so I used some of my Mom's homemade plum jelly and it was excellent! My boyfriend loved it so much he sopped up every last drop with the Pilsbury Grands biscuits I served with it and he doesn't even LIKE horseradish!

I used strawberry sauce that I had made rather than the preserves and decided to bake the chops rather than cook in the skillet. I baked them in the sauce....and it was GREAT sauce. Will make again and try cooking them in skillet to see if there is a difference in taste. Went great with some horseradish mashed potatoes. Thanks for the recipe.

First let me preface this with the fact I was super distracted. I was going to make sage pork chops but I grabbed the curry powder and sprinkled it on the meat. Once I realized I put sage and sea salt on top of it. I had some black cherry fruit spread and saw this recipe. Since the pork chops were already cooking I just dumped the fruit spread in the pan with minced garlic. I put in a healthy amount worcestershire sauce on accident. I noticed the label when it back in the fridge! So I poured the soy sauce right in on top of it. With all my distraction the chops still came out amazing!

This was an amazing combination! I doubled the sauce as recommended by others & added abit more strawberry preserves. Just before serving I added some cornstarch & water to thicken the sauce then poured over the chops & a savory dill butter rice. Thanks for sharing!

I just made these and they were awesome! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I just left that out and I accidentally cooked the chops in the sauce/mixture instead of saving it until the end. But I think they still came out great. This is such a fun flavor combination!

This recipe is all about the sauce. It is delicious. I will prepare the pork chops diffenently next time as other reviewers have sugested. Fried chops are always too tough for my taste. Next time I will either cook the pork chops in the sauce or slow cook chops in the oven and then add before serving. It would also taste great as a sauce for stir-fry. Not too hot even for my two year old.

While I was cooking these my husband read over the receipe and announced 'I hate horseradish. Is there anything else that I can eat?' He finally agreed to at least try them and he was sold after the very first bite. He even said I have to make this at least once a month. The only thing different that I did was used a strawberry/plum preserve. Thanks Leslie!

This was pretty good a nice change from the normal porkchops. I made for company and used boneless pork loin. Everyone loved it even my husband who isn't a strawberry or horseradish fan.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but my young adult children insisted it should only get 4 because it wasn't spicy enough. They wanted it to seriously burn; I was content with its slow comfortable warmth. (Next time I will add some cayenne directly to the sauce for them.) No one complained about the overall flavor though. It's a surprisingly tasty combination! I cooked 6 pork chops so I tripled the sauce recipe. Like some other reviewers I used raspberry jam instead of strawberry sauteed the garlic in the skillet (substituting olive oil for the butter) and after browning the chops I poured the sauce into the skillet as a braising liquid and cooked it all for about an hour. (I didn't want to watch it closely while it cooked so I also added the water with which I rinsed out the sauce pan -- maybe 3/4 of a cup? -- but then thickened the sauce back up with a tablespoon of corn starch at serving time.) Served over brown rice with a tossed salad and fresh melon this was both a pretty and satisfying meal. This is a keeper for me.

I really REALLY wanted to love this recipe. It recieved other great reviews so maybe it's just my taste... I don't know. I like all the ingredients listed but the combination just wasn't very good (to me.) I thought the horseradish and and garlic were really overpowering and really couldn't taste the soy or strawberry preserves. My husband liked it more than I did and he said it was about 3.5 stars; palatable but not something for company.

It's been quite a while since I pan-fried a pork chop because we usually grill them. This was a very nice change! We really liked the sauce that came with it which I made earlier in the day and refrigerated to let the flavors meld--then microwaved it when the meat was ready. Thanks for this recipe!

My guy loved it but I thought the garlic was a bit overpowering. If I make it again I will cut back on that. Served it with eggs and potatoes. Thanks for sharing Leslie and a thank you to your husband for sharing such a nice story!

The sauce is amazing especially for pork chops. I didn't use cayenne as I didn't have any and I used Horseradish mustard (I don't know if that's different from plain Horseradish as this is the first time I have ever used it but it was still amazing). Just salt and pepper on the chops seared and put the sauce on and it was a killer dish. May try the sauce for Thanksgiving instead of cranberry sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a wonderful blend of flavors. I think chicken would be good cooked this way too. However next time I'll probably replace the cayenne pepper with either a few drops of tabasco or some chili powder. The lingering burn of the cayenne pepper was almost too firey for us.
