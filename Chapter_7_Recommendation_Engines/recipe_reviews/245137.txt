Me mom was from Newfoundland and it taste just like what she made for me growing up. One thing I didnâ€™t use the custard mix it came out perfect. When I make rice for dinner I alway make extra so I can make this for desert.

You must try this homestyle recipe! It reminds me of the pudding my wife, from the Codroy Valley, will make on occasion. Delicious

Wow was this good, just like my grandmother's was!  It wasn't dry although baked rice puddings have a different texture than boiled puddings.  I actually put it in a large ovenproof bowl and baked it an hour.  It was a hit, so much I'm making it again to share with the rest of my family!  Throw it in the oven when baking the rest of your dinner!  Your family will be happy for such a great, easy gluten free dessert!  A little whipped cream also tastes great on top!

I made this exactly as written. It is a big hit with mt wife and I.
maybe it is my stove but it took forty minutes to be properly done.
Another one is in the oven, right now.
Added 9/10/2019:  I have made this many times now. The only real change, for me, has been to use two TBLS to cook it at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes.
That might be the fault of my oven but I am pretty sure this will need to bake for more than thirty minutes.

Very yummy- I did make some changes.  Added calories, I am sure.  I used 1 cup half & half and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  Sprinkled cinnamon & nutmeg on top.  Will make again.  g
