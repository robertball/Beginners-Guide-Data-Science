Easy, and a great use for leftover chicken that I had.  What a easy recipe, using prepared alfredo sauce-perfect for any dinner-salad and bread, and dinner's on the table!

I cut back on the garlic powder a bit, used Newman's alfredo sauce, folded in a good amount parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper and one package Steamfresh cooked/drained frozen broccoli. Everyone liked it, especially my oldest boy. He ate two bowls. Next time, I would add a little more pasta because it seemed like to me that even with the broccoli I added, there was more sauce than pasta.  GREAT quick all-in-one casserole that saved this working mother. NOTE: REWARMS WELL. If you want leftovers for the next day or have family that eats bigger, doubling this is necessary.

Might as well order out! Or just read the side of the jar. It tells you exactly what to do!

I was looking for a quick and easy weeknight meal that was under 6 ingredients. This seemed simple enough, and it was delicious! I did use sliced Johnsonville Italian sausage instead of the chicken though, and I will say that added a lot to the flavor. I would have never thought to add Italian sausage to an alfredo. I'm so glad I did!! Just slice it up and saute until cooked before adding the sauce and seasonings. I also watered mine down a bit to make sure I got all the sauce out of the jar. This was delicious!! Super easy too! If the flavor is lacking for anyone, try adding a bit of onion powder, salt, and pepper to the dish. I don't think it needed it though. Thank you!!

I used 1lb. of chicken. Didn't mix the pasta with the sauce and chicken. Used the Italian dressing package to taste. Added peas.  Very easy and my family liked it. Thank you!

This is a good recipe. I used Prego Alfredo Sauce and it turned out great. I didn't use garlic powder but I used minced garlic while cooking the chicken and the Italian dressing mix together.??

Good base recipe for jarred pasta sauce. I was in a rush the other night, had a jar on hand and threw this together. It was missing something so I added some parmesan cheese and pepper (we don't out veggies on our alfredo.) It was delicious!

Excellent.  I didn't have any italian dressing mix, so I used magic dust/cajun seasoning instead.  Throw in a bag of cooked broccoli, and a little parmesan cheese and some black pepper for a topping.

I added mushrooms and used John Soules Foods chicken fajitas in a bag to give it a smoke flavor with the rest of the ingredients.  Turned out amazing my husband loved it.

This recipe is very easy to make, and tastes pretty good. Seasoning the chicken with the Italian Dressing mix really adds some great flavors. I recommend adding a lot of the dressing mix to the individual chicken pieces. To add some more flavor and textures, add some lightly steamed broccoli. Overall, this is a very easy and simple recipe for Chicken Alfredo.
