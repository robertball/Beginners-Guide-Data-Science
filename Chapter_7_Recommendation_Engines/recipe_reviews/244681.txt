I made these Mini Pies twice.  Both times I changed Almonds for Pecans (just a preference).  We enjoyed them both times!  I'm not a huge fan of a giant piece of apple pie...so this is a great  recipe change up!!  I made some changes to the actual recipe and I liked my version better.  I used puff pastry instead of frozen pie crust (easier to work with and the crusts "puffed" beautifully).  Also instead of using cold butter to make the topping I used melted butter and the crumbles stayed together much better.  No major changes.  I would highly recommend this recipe!!

These were very good! If I had to change something, I would  make more pies, but smaller.

I would have added nutmeg and used real butter but cute idea and I am a fan of pre made dough for something this intricate

It was so easy to make Super delicious. Eveyone loved it. I used puff pastry instead of pie.

I enjoyed these. They were quick and easy to make. 
I made these for a potluck and they were a hit. I ate one fresh and another the next day. While the fresh warm one was better, the cold "day old" pies were great too. Unlike traditional apple pies, I did not find this recipe to be super juicy after baking. 
Next time I think I will add a bit more spice as I like my apple pies with a bit more spice.

These are so tasty and so easy!!  I took advice from other reviews and added a dash of nutmeg, and used puff pastry instead of pie crust.  The puff pastry is much lighter and flakier.  I used pecans instead of almonds as well.  I served them with caramel sauce instead of whipped cream.  Excellent!

They are delightful, but who still uses margarine? I made them with unsalted butter. I also use mini muffin pans and found that rolling the piecrust a bit thinner fits the smaller size better. For Thanksgiving I made a mix of minis - pumpkin, pecan, and apple. I also like using stayman apples.

I used frozen sliced apples I had in my freezer.  Therefore, because apples tend to be mushy from freezing them, I stirred them around with a Tablespoon of flour to keep them from being too runny.  I also used butter.  As suggested by another review, I melted butter for my crumble topping which worked well. I bought Tenderflake tart crusts.   I also drizzled caramel sauce over top and offered vanilla ice cream as an accent.  I served these for Thanksgiving dessert and they were loved by all.

Simple and delicious! I substitute the brown sugar that goes in the apples with Carmel drizzled over the apple cinnamon before topping it with the strudel mix.

These are so easy and tasty, ideal not only for snacking but also great for gatherings.  I used a mixture of apples so I reduced the sugar just a smidgeon and they came out perfect.

These are absolutely delicious!  I used Cortland Apples that were quite sweet, so I reduced the sugar in the apples a tad.  Will be making this again!
