Too much sherry and I like sherry, next time I will do 1/2 broth and 1/2 sherry. I made my own bread crumbs from heals and bread I save in the freezer. I broke up the bread into extra small pieces as in a store bought stuffing size. I also use onion chives from my garden that are just about 6" up and fresh dried tarragon from my garden last year. I did not stuff a bird I cooked it in its own casserole dish on 350* for about 35 minutes.

Loved it! My mother has been a professional cook and I found this recipe for last year's turkey. Mom raved about it to all my siblings.

Very good. Easy for a first time stuffing maker. The part cooked in the pan turned out a little bit better then the part cooked in the bird. I added Fennel to give it a little earthier flavor. Even my plain meat and potatoes dad liked to the extra unusual flavor.

I did this in the oven, and it turned out amazing. Great flavor, great crunchy edges. My favorite part is the butter. It's super buttery. I will definitely make this again. 

Oh, I used chicken broth instead of sherry, because my hubs doesn't like sherry. Still great.
