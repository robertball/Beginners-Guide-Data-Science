This recipe is a blast from the past!  It was all the rage in the late 1970's but we called it 'Chile Cheese Appetizers'.  (I still have the hand written recipe card from my friend Tonia.)  Often making an appearance at brunch gatherings and holiday parties.  Nothing has changed, it is still very good.  If you are not dieting or concerned with calories, give this a try.  It is also good rewarmed and wrapped in a flour tortilla with a little salsa for a great breakfast treat.

Followed the recipe to the T with the bacon and thought it was quite good and full of flavor. A little cheesy (might try half the amount of shredded cheese next time) - maybe it's because I used cheddar jack instead of just monterey jack? A lot on the watery/mushy side - I'd think about putting down a brioche crust and adding some milk to compensate to make it more strata-like next time. Love the amount it makes though.  Hubby loved it so I can't really complain. Used 6 slices of bacon baked at 365 for 14 minutes then cut up with scissors.

A fabulous and easy dish.  Best I have ever tasted. I think the cottage cheese is the secret to light and fluffy.  I halved the recipe and it worked.  I did add chopped green onions and diced fresh garlic.  Super good and super easy.  Looking forward to the leftovers.

Really very good. I put the cottage cheese in a colander and pressed out excess liquid with paper towels. I used maple glazed ham instead of bacon. It also reheated well. May try with Cheddar or Jarlsburg cheese next time.

Made it again but added 1 cup spinach that I squeezed all the water out of, 12 eggs , 1/2 pound cheddar 1/2 cup feta, 1/2 cup bacon bits and cooked in regular size muffin tin 15 minutes at 400, 15 minutes at 350. Makes about 18-20 and they are great for freezing for later

Sorry to go against the great reviews this has, but i cant understand how it has 5 stars.  With 1lb of cheese and 2 lbs cottage cheese to 10 eggs, how did i not know that this would result in a slimy wet mess, which is exactly what it did.  And I even left out the stick of butter!!!  Horrible texture...YUCK!!!

I did make some changes due to what I had on hand.  I adjusted recipe to 6 servings.  Used turkey sausage diced, frozen onion & frozen bell pepper diced.  6 eggs any cheeses I had.  Used 1/4 c self rising flour, omitted baking powder.  I made it in muffin pan & recipe made 15 muffins.  Baked 350 for 45-1hour.  Yummy yummy. Enjoy.

A friend brought this for  breakfast because my husband does low carb and this doesn't call for bread or hash browns.  It was a huge hit. I have been looking for a breakfast casserole that I liked for a long time and I have  finally found it.  She did use half cottage cheese and half mascarpone because that's what she had on hand and she also drained the cottage cheese as another reviewer suggested. I loved the  texture and I think not using bread or potatoes is the key  besides toast can always be  served  on the  side.  While eating  the leftovers the next morning my hubs suggested I start making this one.

Very good.  I made this a day ahead of time.  Use an electric mixer to mix eggs, flour and baking powder before adding other ingredients.  I also cut back on the amount of shredded cheese.  I will make again.

I followed most of directions, but made changes! Skipped the butter, and chiles, and cut the cheese in half. Used low fat cottage cheese, and low fat shredded cheeses (Cheddar and Parmesan). Added bacon and green onions, and also added onion powder, parsley, and pepper, to season! OMG delicious!!! Will make again and again! Yummm!

This is a great egg bake recipe. One of our family favorites. And no one can tell that there is cottage cheese in the recipe. I would highly recommend it.

After reading the other reviews I decided to use dry curd cottage cheese to take away the mushy texture.  LOVE IT  It was , and still is a favorite.

I just made this and it’s delicious. I cut the recipe in half and used muffin tins so I could freeze them. I used small curd cottage cheese, an Italian blend of shredded cheese, a whole 4 oz can of green chiles, bacon, gluten free all purpose flour and no butter. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Light and fluffy.

Really nice change from the ever present bread or hashbrown breakfast bake. This is the 2nd time I made it.  First time exactly as written.  That's why it's a 4 star.  Minor adjustments make this a 5 star.  I omitted the butter.  The cheese has enough fat in it.  I doubled the green chilies to 2 cans and used 1 lb browned breakfast sausage instead of bacon.   Now everyone loves this!

I drained the cottage cheese after reading several reviews about the moisture messing up the casserole. It worked well, and the recipe turned out wonderful! I made it for work, and my co-workers LOVED it!

I didn't have bacon on hand and I only had 1-16oz container of cottage cheese which seemed to be enough for 10 eggs. I recommend using small curd cottage cheese though for appearance. I used 2 cups of shredded cheese, added diced green chiles and some garlic powder.
It was easy to make but needs a little more flavor if you intend to eat plain. I baked the egg mixture in a jumbo muffin tin and will serve with an hollendaise sauce.
Next time I make this I will try it with bacon and 2 containers of cottage cheese as the recipe is written

My boyfriend LOVED this. I did strain the cottage cheese, and used a low moisture mozzarella to avoid a watery casserole. Added fresh spinach, green onions. Delicious!

This is a terrific dish. I did make a half dish.  The only change I made is to drain the cottage cheese and  used pepper jack cheese since the chilies don't like me as much as I like them. I also skipped the butter and it's not missed. I think this will be even better tomorrow. This will definitely be added to the rotation in my house.

This recipe was easy to make and a big hit Christmas morning. Next time I will use less butter, or maybe no butter. I served it with salsa, sour cream, and tortillas, and everyone asked for seconds!

I chopped the onions and cooked them with the ground  sausage. I used sage sausage. Everyone seemed to enjoy it as I had nothing left. I doubled the recipe as I had 9 people for breakfast. The men in particular went back several times. I served it with coffee cake , grits, fruit salad,  cinnamon rolls, juice and coffee.

I was making goat's milk feta, which turned out wrong. The curd was too moist and much like cottage cheese. So, I looked for a recipe to use it up. I also added just a bit of goat's milk to the mix and used the big anchos I had on hand instead of canned chilis. Worked great. Will make it again.

This was so easy to make and tasted delicious! I added slices of zucchini at the bottom and then on top. We ate it on top of toast! Yummy!!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used a 9 x 13 dish. The consistency was wonderful, very soufflé-like and the taste was very like a quiche Lorraine, without all the fuss of those two dishes. Cooking time and temp were perfect. I was concerned because one reviewer said it came out wet and mushy. Not my experience at all.  This is a keeper. So easy!

I’ve made this multiple times. First as written- delicious! Last two times I’ve included fresh chopped spinach, feta, Parmesan, mozzarella, along with lots of sautéed garlic, orange bell peppers and onions. I’ve made with bacon and ham.

Had lots of eggs and cottage cheese I had to use up and this was the PERFECT recipe to solve my problem! I didn't use any bacon and instead of 1/2 cup of Margarine/Butter, I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth and seasoned with Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt before baking. Wonderful flavor and now I have breakfast for days! Thank you!

Perfect just the way it is.  So simple and turns out delicious.  I like the fact that it was all eggs and no fillers like bread or potatoes.

This was fast & fabulous!! I did have to change the no of servings.  I had to use cheddar cheese, and was about 4 ozs short on the cottage cheese.  A very forgiving recipe, and the family raved about it.  This is officially the new  Christmas morning breakfast.

I did change it up. Tripled the green chilies, used all low fat products , add ham, ( sometimes fresh spinach) dried minced onion, and sometimes a 2 tsp of taco seasoning. 
Made it as both a casserole and individual muffins which I can freeze to take to go.

I have made it for years and our family loves it.  I think I have been asked for this recipe more than any other.  But I noticed some of the reviews talked about there being too much cheese and the end product being less than desired.  Try just one 16 oz container of cottage cheese.  That's what the recipe I use calls for and I've never had an issue. Sometimes it does need to cook longer than the suggested time.  Hope this helps.

Everyone loved this egg bake; but I changed it up quite a bit. I used 24 oz. 2% cottage cheese which I drained well, per others’ reviews. I used marble jack cheese instead of plain jack. I added chopped scallions and onions which I sautéed with breakfast sausage instead of bacon. (I find bacon too much work!) Lastly I add 1 t. cumin and I think it could have used more. It came out of the oven looking almost like cornbread. I let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting and it held its shape perfectly. Will definitely make again.

Best breakfast casserole. You can make all types of variations to meet individual taste. I have added jalapenos, sausage, peppers. The base is not dry and reheats well.

It was delicious! 
However I cut the shredded cheese in half and used 2/3 the cottage cheese but kept the butter in the recipe and it was perfect.

I served this dish to my friends & they loved it.  The dish was light yet filling.  To me, it was rather bland.  I did add dry mustard, 2-7 oz. cans of diced green chilis, salt & pepper & a small jalapeno pepper. This helped a lot.  Will try some cumin, a bit of garlic powder &  sharp or Swiss cheese next time I make this dish!

I made half the recipe and it was baked in 20 minutes!   I omitted the butter, added onion (fried lightly with the minced bacon), fresh basil and halved grape tomatoes on top.  It was a bit bland but acceptable.   We have half of it left so I'll see how it works for lunch with a tortilla and salsa.

Mistake at grocery store resulted in Ricotta Cheese instead of Cottage. Everyone said it was yummy so I guess the substitution didn’t make a big difference.

I’m vegetarian and always looking for recipes with protein.  I did make additions and subtractions to the core recipe but am really pleased with the results.  I used a cup of shredded cheese, one 24 ounce container of 4% fat cottage cheese, soy bacon bits and omitted the butter.  Also, I wanted to use up leftover sautéed greens and the last bit of salsa haunting my refrigerator.  This recipe allows for variations.  I did use the required 10 eggs, half cup of flour and teaspoon of baking powder.

This is a good basic recipe. I made the recipe as submitted and it turned out beautifully. For us it needs more chiles, probably the addition of 1-2 Tbsp of diced jalapenos.  I will make it again.

Tried this out when I needed a fully cooked egg dish without bread or potatoes for our Easter brunch. I mostly followed the recipe including adding the bacon, but I did omit the butter and used light cheese. Tasty and filling! Will definitely make this again!! (Note: I used 2% cottage cheese and I didn't have any moisture issues BUT I live at a higher altitude so that could have helped out)

Very easy to make and tastes great. The only thing I added was a tablespoon of dried minced onion. Yum yum!!

this was so good, great way to start the morning with a protein filled breakfast. My dad is a bit of a veggie hater so i added finely chopped red and green bell peppers to this and it only made it better while being a good way to "hide" the vegetables.

I followed the recipe just as it was, but I didn't add the chillies and I let it cook for about another 5 minutes longer than the recipe says to do just to be sure the eggs were fully cooked.  It was very cheesy, but I'm from Wisconsin and that's appreciated here. Next time I might finely chop and sauté some green peppers into it.  I prefer not to use canned ingredients.  I added the optional  bacon and I think that tasted really nice in it. Next time I might  also try to add some sausage and maybe black olives. This recipe was outstanding!

Used some sharp cheddar instead of monterey, and used fire roasted green chiles. It was perfect; had it for dinner the next night

I made it according to directions and it came out looking beautiful and golden brown. But I was disappointed with the taste after reading the rave reviews. It was ok but I didn't think it was anything special. My family felt the same. Probably won't make this again unless I need to use up ingredients in my fridge.

I prepared this, along with a few other casseroles, for a breakfast event at work - my boss made it for an event this morning after having gotten it from me.  Obviously, this is a hit, even if it is an older recipe.  We're having to give out the recipe again!
