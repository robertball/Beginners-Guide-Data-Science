I made mine the French way, by just combining all of the ingredients excluding the greens, and letting them marinate in a batch of dressing.  It was delicious, and something new to add to the rotation.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't use potatoes (I prefer to eat seafood with veggies), so I added more of all the other ingredients. I also used fresh ahi tuna fillets, which I seasoned with lemon pepper and baked, then flaked into the salad. I made my own lemon vinaigrette (used about half a cup, but next time I'll add a bit more) and tossed everything together. The flavors blended perfectly and I didn't find it fishy at all (but that could have been because I used fresh tuna)--not even the anchovies stood out. With the olives and anchovies, this could seem a bit salty, but the egg and lemon balance it out.

This was fantastic!  I added an extra Tbl. of capers, and left off the onion and anchovy filets, just as a personal preference.  I couldn't find a lemon vinaigrette on this site, so I used another one I found, and it ended up being perfect!:  1/8 cup fresh lemon juice + 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil + 1/2 tsp. Dijon mustard + 1 clove garlic, minced + 1/2 tsp. kosher salt + 1/8 tsp. fresh ground pepper.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Please don't spoil this delightful fresh salad by using canned tuna.  Fresh tuna steak, lightly grilled and chopped ,adds so much more flavor and texture!

I live in a small town with limited produce options, so I blanched asparagus instead of green beans (couldn't find fresh ones).  Perfect!  I cooked a whiting filet instead of using tuna.  Yuck.  Will stick with tuna next time!  Used a dijon honey mustard, with a little horseradish to perk it up.  Will make again.

My mother made this salad often when we were growing up and now it is a staple in my house. It is still my favorite salad. My 'meat and potatoes' husband loves this salad. The only difference is I use a red wine vinaigrette.

I used the lemon pepper tuna in the vacumme pack.  Deleted the anchovies(personal preference).  This was so very, very good.  Just ate the soggy lefteovers tonight, still simply delicious. I totaly recommend this recipe.

This simplified take on Julia Child's classic Salad Nicoise was just what I was after for a quick and healthy dinner.  As a matter of personal taste I skipped the anchovies, onion and capers and used my own Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette.  Rather than mixed greens, a la Julia, I used Boston lettuce.  Once the potatoes are cooked, toss them with some of the vinaigrette and cover until you're ready to serve.  They absorb all that flavorful goodness.  Rather than tossing altogether, I arranged this as  a composed salad.  This, a small baguette and a cup of clam chowder completed our meal.

I followed this recipe exactly except for the green beans and it was excellent. I used the recipe for "lemon vinaigrette salad" for the dressing and it was perfect.

Followed directions to the "T" and also used the "Lemon Vinaigrette salad" dressing from this website.  Absolutely delicious!  A perfect summer salad.  Extra bonus: my husband told me this is THE BEST salad he's ever had in his life! He wants to have it again this week!

Great salad.  I used fresh tuna which I grilled Cajun style.  Served on the side.  Excellent flavour, lovely dressing.  High protein meal, great if you are on a low card diet.

This was just too fishy for me. I also rinsed the tuna beforehand but it was too over powering to me.

This is an excellent recipe and very tasty. We added fresh radishes for our garden. I only give this four stars because the prep time is a joke. Count on an hour or more for all the blanching, chopping, boiling, etc. well worth the trouble but don't be doing this when you are in a hurry

Love this recipe.  The only change I made to it was I used fresh Ahi Tuna, pan seared, instead of can tuna.  Very good.

Perfect.   I read all of the reviews and I find it so interesting that everyone has to add or subtract or change just one thing.   If you are that clever then post your own recipe.  
I'm looking for make as they are recipes that I dont  not have to think about.  
Better than I could do.   This was really good and tasty.

I lived in Casablanca, French Morocco, for three years in the early '60s with my husband and children.  We spent many, many weekends on the beach there and we would purchase our lunch from a food stand there on the beach.  Once we tasted Salad Nicoise, a French creation, we were hooked!  It had all these ingredients except the anchovies.  I brought this "idea" back to the States when we returned and have continued to make it over the years since.  The French used a dressing more like Caesar dressing.  This recipe is as close to the original as I've found.  Very, very tasty.  Thank you for bringing back good memories!

Though we liked the flavor of this salad, I decided to give it 3 stars dut to the amount of prep (boil potatoes, eggs, blanch beans), as well as the specialty ingredients (olives/anchovies) remainders of which would sit in my fridge unusued - as these are not staples in other recipes we use.  However, I do like the style of salad and will likely continue tweaking this recipe until I can fit it into our budget/time frames.

I make this often. It's a favourite of ours.  To enhance the flavour, use tuna packed in oil like they do in Europe!  The flavour in amazing and less "canned" tasting.  I buy Rio brand at the Italian grocery store.

This recipe is very good I forgot to add the capers and did not have the anchovies. Still I prepared a good lemon vinagrete and it was delicious. This is somewhat of a time consuming salad. I have made it many times before, so my solution is to prepare ahead the eggs and green beans to cut your preparation time by probably half. Chill them to finish the salad the next day if you wish. This  adds crisp to the beans and firmness to the eggs. This is a salad that qualifies as a meal given its ingredients so be ready for a pretty satisfying dinner or lunch. Try it with albacore tuna too! It is delicious!

This was a great recipe for me, a novice at Salad Nicoise. Like one of the other reviewers, I also enjoyed  leftovers the next day. I love anchovies, but to dilute their intensity, I used 2 and shredded them and mixed them in with the dressing which tasted wonderful.

I made this delicious salad tonight for a heart healthy summer dinner. I made it as written but did add a touch of olive oil to the dressing and because I did not have time to refrigerate it for 2-4 hours, instead I put it in a stainless steel bowl in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it was perfectly chilled. My husband, who is not a big salad eater, even raved about it so it will be a keeper for sure. Thank you for a great salad.                                                                                                                                                  Colorado Karen

This recipe doesn't add an important step that makes all the difference.   Once the potatoes and green beans are cooked and sliced they should be marinated in some of the vinaigrette for a few hours before putting the salad together.  BTW asparagus is awfully good instead of green beans; it should be marinated too.  It really makes a difference in the flavor of the salad; otherwise it's just cold potatoes and beans in a salad.

Excellent salad, I made mine with one change, rather than canned tuna, I used 1/2 pound of fresh tuna, basted it with the vinaigrette and salt and pepper to taste then grilled it on the BBQ. Cooled slightly then sliced onto my salad. It was fantastic and not fishy at all.

I omitted the capers and anchovies and it was still very good. The lemon vinaigrette was very good. 

I would make this again.

We loved this! I subbed fresh grilled tuna. I used a regular vinaigrette (could not locate lemon) which I tossed with the cooked potatoes, parsley, tuna, etc. before refrigerating. I added dressing to the greens as well, and squirted lemon juice when it was all assembled. I also made separate servings and garnished each one. 

 My only suggestion for recipe writers is to keep measurements consistent. 1/2 onion doesn't tell us much!

I used grilled salmon instead of tuna and even with omiting the anchovies and capers, this salad had too many things going on.  If I make it again, I will leave out the olives, onions, and green beans to make it less busy.  On a positive note, the potatoes were a nice kind of different and this salad was very filling.

Delicious and filling salad.  Will try it with a tuna steak next time, and add a bit more black olives..  I used Marie's Lemon Herb dressing and it was good with it.  I thought the leftovers might be gross and soggy, but it was great.

Hopefully it's not heresy to leave out the olives and add more tomato. I like it better that way.

We love Nicoise salad.But, I like it without the anchovies  or capers  Today, this salad was going to be our meal, so I scaled it up to 6 for my family of 4 and that made the perfect meal portions for us. Also I prefer to serve this the way they do it in some restaurants, veggies, eggs and tuna are set separately on the bed of greens. You could also try it with canned Sardines instead of Tuna. Sardines are much better for you. Just try getting the boneless skinless kind.
