To combat possible runniness (as described in other reviews)without modifying the recipe, turn the oven OFF when the baking time is complete and let it sit in the cooling oven while continuing to boil off liquid. It won't burn, and it sets the pie very nicely. (Even with overripe, juicy peaches, it set perfectly.) This recipe is fantastic, and embarrassingly easy to make. An absolute winner.

Oh wow, peachy goodness in pie form! I don't bother making my own crust..the Pillsbury un-roll kind taste great and are so easy to cut into lattice strips. I used 10 fresh peaches and 1 pint of blueberries. Love that sweet tart combo. I read the hint somewhere on this site to boil peaches for 1 minute then plunge into cold water and the skins slip right off. That tidbit should accompany any fresh peach recipe..I used to stand there and slice and peel each bleepin peach by hand! Never again! Thanks to the cook who posted that tip. I followed other reviewers' advice and used half brown and half white sugar, added cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Rather than layering I just mixed the flour mixture with the peaches, dumped it all into the pie plate and then dropped a few little pieces of butter before putting on the lattice crust. My lattice has never worked out right, but after watching the video on this site my lattice came out great! There is a secret to weaving the strips the right way. Also followed the tip from another cook to leave the pie sitting in the oven after turning it off so it would set. Worked great! All the hints from other cooks have helped me to finally perfect my peach-blueberry pie. Thank-you!

This pie was AWESOME!!. My family loved it! I used fresh peaches. I took the advice of several other reviews and added 1 heaping TBLSP of corn starch, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 c of brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar. I did not have any nutmeg so I added 1/4 tsp of Allspice. I did not put the butter in the crumb mixture. I did layer the pie as instructed and then I put 5-6 small plops of butter on top of the last layer( I did not use 1/4 cup of butter as instructed.) I thought this might be a reason why some pies came out runny. I then put my pie crust on top. I used a egg wash and sprinkled the top with sugar and cinnamon. I cooked it for 15 min at 450*, then I turned the oven down to 350 and cooked the remaining time. I turned the oven off and I left it in the oven for about 1-2 hrs to cool down. It was not runny at all. It sliced very nicely and stayed together when putting it onto the plate. It was not dry just the right moisture. The bottom pie crust came out perfect. Not under cooked at all. This is a keeper and I will be making this again.

First peach pie I have ever made. After reading reviews I did follow some, such as baking at 450 for 15 minutes,then 350 for 30 minutes. I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon also. That is the only changes I made to original recipe.  I had no problem with extra juice and was delicious. Will definitely make it again. Had guests the night I served it and raved about.  I used my own recipe for the crust.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe! I made a few changes like using half brown sugar and adding lots of cinnamon and some other spices...but the only really important one is to ADD CORNSTARCH to the four mixture! I used can peaches with the juice drained and it came out so delicious...everyone ate it up on Thanksgiving and I just made another one for my husband last night! Excellent! Thanks!!

This recipe was so easy!! I'm not a peach pie fan but I am now! I accidentally added 1/4 c. more butter than it called for, but it was absolutely delicious.  I also followed the advice in the previous review and let it sit in a cooling oven--set up perfectly.  If you want easy, skip the lattice top and just put a regular crust on top.  You won't be sorry you made this pie.  Thanks Marcia!

I made this for Father's Day dessert and my husband LOVED it.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar, sprinkled the crust with cinnamon, and baked it for 15 minutes at 450 then 35 minutes at 350.  It wasn't runny at all.  I'll make this again and again.

THE PIE WAS GREAT.  I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN AND IT TURNED OUT PERFECT.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE CAN RATE THE RECIPE AND THEN LIST ALL THE CHANGES THEY MADE.  THAT'S NOT THE RECIPE WHEN THEY DO THAT, IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RECIPE.  I READ ONE WHERE THEY ADDED BROWN SUGAR, ALLSPICE, DIDN'T USE THE  FOURTH CUP OF BUTTER, IN WHAT UNIVERSE WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED THIS RECIPE AND HOW CAN THEY RATE THIS RECIPE 5 STARS WHEN THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RECIPE.  SUBMIT YOUR RECIPE AS NEW OR RATE THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN.

Great recipe. Yes, it was a little runny the first time I made this pie. It was still delicious, so I tried it again with great success. I use a cookie sheet under all fruit pies (to catch the juice). I also like to cook my pies at 450 degrees for the first 15 minutes like a lot of recipes call for.  I suggest cooking it until the crust is very dark and the juice is bubbling over, so it won't be runny.  I also do the leave it in the oven thing whenever I don't need to use the oven again right away. If you like peach pie, you'll love this one.

This was my first time making peach pie. However, after reading most of the reviews, I knew I had to make some adjustments. 
*Canned or Fresh? - I used Frozen...came out great!
*For Tartness- I added 6 packets of equal sugar...
* I skipped the flour method...instead I mixed the peach slices with sugar, butter, and half a teaspoon of corn starch...
I also added a special touch: Since most prepare pie crusts come in packages of two, I used the other pastry on top of the pie! I sealed it up, make three cuts on the top...and sprinkled it with sugar! 
The pie was AWSOME!

I'm not a big fan of Peach Pie, but my boyfriend asked that I make it for him. Like the sweet girl I am, I searched for a great recipe. My pie couldn't have turned out more perfect. Here are the changes I made so yours will be perfect and beautiful at the same time.  I used 3 cans of peaches that were drained over night, I didn't feel like peeling and slicing. I mixed together 1 heaping TBSP of Corn Starch, 1/3 C Flour, 1/2 C White Sugar, 1/2 C Brown Sugar.  Then I tossed the dry mixture in with the peaches.  I used a premade crust from the store, let it thaw, poked it with a fork, and coated the bottom with an egg wash and organic honey for some extra flavor. I poured in the peaches and spread them evenly. It fit perfectly. I laid another premade crust on top and pinched the sides. I put more egg wash on top for a shiny finish with light coat of sugar. Just a large pinch.  For baking, I put foil around the crust edge to prevent burning (take it off 15 minutes before baking time has ended) and put the pie on cookie sheet in case there was drippings. I baked the pie at 450 for 15 minutes. Then I baked at 350 for 30 minutes.   Here is the most important part: when baking time is over turn off the oven and walk away. Just walk away. Don't even think about taking that pie out. Leave it for AT LEAST 2 hours. This thickens the inside and gives you that perfect, clean slice.   I usually bake the pie around lunch time, and don't take it out until after dinner when it's dessert time.

This recipe was great after a few minor adjustments.  I went with most of the other reviews by adding one heaping tbsp. of corn starch, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, and by changing the 1 cup sugar to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar.  This made the filling thicken upon standing a lot better! I also baked at 450 for only 10 mins and then cooked the additional 30 minutes at 350. It was great I will for sure be making this again!   *Special tip of my own for glazed topping: 1/2 cup butter  3 tbsp flour 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar  After pie is constructed, place all glaze ingredients into a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for one minute, reduce heat and simmer for five minutes.  Remove from heat, using a spoon drizzle glaze over lattice crust and allow glaze to seep down into filling. Then just bake as instructed! Since the crumb mixture is already in the pie, I only needed to use about 1/2 of this glaze but it makes for a beautiful golden brown and glossy pie!

just a quick recipe note, and i'm sure someone must have already covered this, but i didn't feel like reading through 200 reviews to find it. the peaches i picked today at a local orchard were humongous. "10 peaches" is not really useful as a measurement. i recommend using between 2 and 2 1/2 pounds of peaches  per pie, which in the case of my monster peaches was 4. 10 peaches would have been 2 1/2 PIES worth!

I made this pie exactly as the recipe states (ingredient wise), but baked at 380 degrees and I did not have any issues with it being runny. It literally came out perfect. The peaches I used were ripe, but still had some firmness to them. I even substituted blueberries and raspberries in the recipe and it came out perfect. I brush the top of my lattice with milk and then sprinkle sugar. I bake uncovered for about 20 min and then cover the edges of the crust and continue to bake for about 40 more min. Basically until the pie is "golden" enough for me. I've made this several times with the same result. Wonderful! The simplicity of the recipe lets the peach flavor really stand out.

Very, very good recipe and simple. I had NO runny nor over-flow issues at all and I used canned peaches because the fresh selection was poor. Off the bat, I went with the advice to leave the pie in oven after baking and that may have helped. I added NO CORNSTARCH or flour for a thicking agent.  Take her advice (first review)--it works definitely.  I used 3-30 ounce cans of freestone peaches (which I drained overnight), added 1 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. of ginger, 1 tsp of real vanilla and a dash of nutmeg into the crumb mixture. Brushed my crust with egg (I like gloss) and followed the rest of the directions for baking. Butter--NOT margerine makes a difference as well for taste. NOTE: 3 cans (if you use) makes for a nice FULL deep dish pie. Meaning no air pockets between crust and pie layer. Next time will try fresh peaches when I go to my local specialty fruit market (8 large). Fantastic pie. Thanks!!

This didn't run out well at all, IMO. It was way too sweet! Also, runny and kinda gooey from the sugar. I did what the reviews said and left it in the oven for a couple of hours after turning the heat off. Also, did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Definitely needs some tweaking.

Like the one reviewer said 'embarassingly easy'...lol  I, too changed the sugar to half white/brown and put in some nutmeg (1/4 tsp) and saigon cinnamon (1/2 tsp).  Instead of the lattice design (boring), I used some cookie cutters in the theme of spring (butterflies and flowers) to cut designs out of the crust itself and then reposition the cut-outs on other areas of the pie.  Don't forget to eggwash (one egg plus a few tablespoons of milk, beaten together well and then brushed lightly on crust) for a lovely, shiny result!  :0)

I was thrilled at how well this pie turned out! It seemed like a good, basic recipe, and it was. I also added a few things, per others' reviews. So thanks, everyone! I added 1 T cornstarch, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I only had three and a half peaches, so I used a  12oz bag of frozen strawberries, too. I baked the pie at 450ºF for the first 15 minutes, then reduced the oven temperature to 350ºF for the last half hour. After turning the oven off I left the pie in the warm oven to set. (Thanks for those tips, too!) The pie is amazing! Thanks!

Really nice. Since peaches aren't in season and I was seriously craving peach pie, I used two big cans of canned peaches, rinsed and well-drained. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and baked it using the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" recipe from this site. My filling set up perfectly, but when I try it with fresh peaches, I'll definitely add a little extra flour or some cornstarch, as I think it'll need it. I was worried that it might be too sweet, but it was a nice, mellow, simple sweetness. In fact, I think it would really benefit from 2-3 tsp. fresh lemon juice just to wake it up a little. This one's a keeper!

The taste was great, but I found the butter/sugar/flour mixture came out... well, a bit like runny glue.  It certainly wasn't bad, just not pretty.  I wonder if corn starch would come out nicer?  The taste was worth making again.

I used frozen peach slices (since fresh are out of season) and due to time used the roll-out premade crusts. Did a lattice top. Everyone loved it!!! Will be keeping this recipe. The only thing I did different was I added nutmeg and cinnamon and 2 tbsp of cornstarch to the crumble mix! I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 c splenda.
Make sure you thaw peaches and dab dry to reduce moisture in pies. Cant wait to use fresh peaches!

I used 2 large cans of peaches in lite syrup drained, 1/2 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, and 1/4 cup butter.  I mixed the peaches, flour, sugar and almond together and poured it into the shell and dabbed the butter on top.  Then I put the top crust on and sprinkled it with sugar.  I baked it at 400 for 15 min. and then at 350 for 45 min.  I also covered the edge of the crust for the first 45 minutes of baking and baked it uncovered for the last 15 minutes to keep it from over browning.

This was a wonderful pie! Although it did need a few changes. I added 1 tabl. corn startch to the butter and flour mixtuer, to help with the excess of juice. I also cooked it at 400 for the first 15 min, and then at 350 for the last 30. I brushed the crust with butter to add a slight golden brown color. Also if you leave it in the oven to cool for 1 hour the juice will thicken. Thanks for the recipe its a keeper!!!

Wow - what a great pie (especially when following alternate instructions!)    I followed most of the reviewer suggestions.  I boiled my peaches for a minute before peeling - it didn't help much as my peaches were not very ripe.  I added just under a pint of blueberries.  I added a tsp of cinnamon and about a 1/4 tsp of cloves, cause I love them.  I used a 1/2 c of brown sugar and a 1/2 c of white.  I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to the flour/sugar/butter mix.  And I baked at 450 for 15, then 350 for 35.  I let the pie sit in the oven after that (with oven off) for about 20 minutes.  I also used pillsbury frozen pie crust.  It was my first pie ever, though I've baked everything else for years - so it wasn't as beautiful as some... but my entire family thought it was "the best pie they'd ever had."  Thanks for a great base recipe....  For us, the pie was not runny at all.  It was on the sweet side for us, but not so sweet to be cloying.  And even with my lack of pie experience, it was very pretty.  I would even serve it to my gourmand foodie mother-in-law.... :)  4 stars only because the need for tweaks...

this is one of the best pies i've ever had!  made with fresh peaches, it's out of this world & so simple, it's genius.  i use a double pie crust for mine in a deep dish pie pan.  *one tip i read somewhere: shut off the oven when the pie appears done and leave it there until it cools to avoid a runny pie - it works.  plus, for this pie i bake with a cookie sheet underneath because it always runs over while baking.

Everyone simply loved this pie. I did make a few changes because of other reviews.  First  after slicing the peaches, I mixed in between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of quick cooking tapioca and let it set for about 10 minutes.  I also  did half brown and half white sugar and added a little cinammon.  Cooked it at 450 for 10 minutes and then 350 for the remainder time.  It was delicious and I had no problems with the consistancy of the pie.  THis will be the only peach pie recipe I use from now on.   I also wanted to add that I did not do the lattice crust but simply layed another crust on top, cut slits in it and gave it an egg wash and sprinkled sugar on it.Thanks.

Only had 8 peaches so added some rhubarb we had on hand to fill it in (should have added a little more sugar, as rhubarb is quite tart).  Added the cornstarch suggested by many other reviews, and wish I hadn't, as there was almost no juice.  It was very tasty tho.  Used some other suggestions of starting off at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and turning down to 350 for remainder, as well as leaving in the oven for several hours to ensure a non-soggy crust.  Great suggestion and will use it for other pies hereon out.  Used half white and half brown sugar and also added nutmeg to the crumb mixture.  All in all, a very easy and tasty dish.  Thanks for sharing here!

Pie turned out ok, was still a little runny even after following others' suggestions of adding cornstarch and leaving in the oven (once temp turned off) for an additional 30 minutes.  Although, this could be my fault for allowing the pie to be cut before it had been in the fridge.  It had been cooling all day on the counter so I thought it might have been ok, apparently not.  After spending the night in the fridge it was just fine.  My suggestion: leave in fridge overnight and serve the next day.

The flavour was very nice, especially when substituting brown sugar for 1/2 of the white called for in the recipe. I also added 1 heaping tablespoon of cornstarch to the peaches before layering them in the dish. I used frozen peaches and added a splash of lemon with good results, but the texture was somewhat compromised. I think this pie is best suited to fresh peaches when available. I also used the glaze recommended by another reviewer and recommend it as well both for the flavour and the pretty colour and shine it adds to the pastry.

I used to buy a Peaches and Cream pie that was so delicious, even though it was store bought.  Then sadly, it was discontinued.  It's been years since I've had it.  Then, I found this recipe and thought-well, why not give it a whirl.  OH MY GOD.  It is just like that Peaches and Cream pie, but 1000 x better!!  It is heavenly.  My Dh absolutely flipped out and could not stop raving about this pie.  I used a Pillsbury crust and made a streusel topping, and used fresh precut peaches, drained of their juice.  I added one tbsp of cornstarch to the flour mixture as per other reviews.  So, so good.  My only complaint is that it doesn't hold up well over a couple of days (gets soggy).  So next time I will make it when there are more than my husband and I to eat it. It was only sheer willpower that prevented us from eating the whole pie in 2 days! Try it, you will not be disappointed.  AWESOME. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I just made this - and posted a picture! It's soo good and tastes fresh. I only used 7 peaches, and worked good for the pie plate I had. I still used the same amounts for the filling. I followed the instructions somebody suggested about turning the oven off and leaving the pie in - it was not overly juicy at all and turned out perfect. I did not add other spices, as I think the fresh peach flavor would have been masked somewhat. I brushed slightly beaten egg white on the lattice top and sprinkled with a little sugar. Thank you for the recipe! I used fresh local peaches from a fruit stand. They were soft, but not overly ripe.

This is a very delicious pie!  My peaches were VERY ripe and they worked out perfect, not at all too juicy.  I couldn't even wait for the pie to cool before cutting a piece, it smelled SO good, and the peaches stayed perfectly in place without sliding out of the slices.   This recipe has a lot of sugar so I didn't quite use all of the sugar/flour mix, but I don't like overly sweet things.  I also added cinnamon and peeled the peaches :)

My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it last night and said it's his favorite pie he's ever had!  It is definitely the best peach pie I've ever made!

This was delicious!  I made it with a single pie crust, since that is all I had.  I also added 1 T cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  It did not set up well though, and the filling tasted doughy from the cornstarch.  I used very ripe, fresh peaches, and boiled them for 1 min. with the skins on, then into cold water to remove skins.

This was exactly what I was looking for in an old fashion peach pie.  I did add a little lemon juice to keep the peaches from turning dark and about one-half tsp. almond flavoring.  I also found that temp. was a little low and cooking time just a little short. Excellent pie!!

This is the first time I made hommade peach pie, and I loved it.    I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great, I love the peachy flavor, I did follow advice and left it in the oven a bit after shutting it off, and it was perfect.   Not too runny at all, and I used fresh peaches.   The lattice top also looked very nice.

This was my first homemade pie. I read all of the helpful suggestions before I started.

I boiled the peaches for a minute and then plunged them in cold water. The skins slid right off with my hands.

I also did not use the butter in the flour mixture. I add six pats across the top layer before adding the lattice.

With the flour mixture, I also used 1 tbsp corn starch, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and used 1/2 c regular sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar (instead of 1 c regular sugar).

I used the egg wash on the lattice and then sprinkled some cinnamon on it.

I cooked the pie for 15 mins at 450, then 30 mins at 350, and then turned off the oven and left the pie in it for one hour. Then I let the pie sit on the stove to cool for another hour before slicing. Perfect firmness!

Delicious pie filling, it was not runny at all. I did leave it in the oven after it was finished baking to keep the filling from runny. I also used canned peaches and it turned out fine. Thanks.

Wow sooo easy! I loved this one. It was my first pie and turned out great. I used fresh peaches and peeled them using the boiling water for one minute and plunge in cold water trick...perfect. My dad and husband had 2 pieces! I used the Pastry for Double Crust recipe and it was easy too! I also watched to video that was posted with the recipe and it was really helpful. Give this one a try!

Followed a lot of others suggestions and added cinnamon and nutmeg to original recipe, as well as a tablespoon of cornstarch. It tasted wonderful, but was very runny! My family actually used the juice as topping for ice cream! Next time will add tapioca instead. I used my own crust recipe.

Mine came out super runny. I made it as is but followed the instructions of cooking it for 15 min at 450 and then the rest of the time at 350 and then letting it sit in the cooling oven for a while. I also did 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and added a little cinnamon. It tasted great other than it was a runny mess, so next time I will follow other's advice and add a heaping scoop of cornstarch.

I used Walmart deep pie shells. Poked holes in the bottom crust and brushed with butter and sprinkled sugar before I added mixture. Then cut 2nd crust into strips and brushed those with butter then eggwash-sprinkled with sugar again. My family actually likes this crust very much-it is sweet and flaky. The tip about turning off oven and letting juice set was a great one. This is a restaurant quality pie. Oh yeah -I put a pinch of nutmeg and 2 pinches of cinnamon for a deeper flavor. It was still eay to make, and never lasts more than about 3 hours before everyone is getting seconds to wipe it out..

This was great.  I used fresh peeled fruit (only needed 6 peaches since they were large).  I took the advice of using half brown and half white sugar, and used a little less butter.  The best tip was turning off the oven and leaving the pie in the oven to completely cool (about 2 hours or so).  It was the best pie I ever made.  Plan to use this cooling technique with all my fruit pies.

Because of the reviews, and because my peaches were extra juicy, I added a Tbsp of corn starch. Turned out really well. The family loved it!

I had extra peaches my kids picked at a local orchard and they were starting to get really soft and soon would rot. I went to this website knowing I could find a peach pie recipe using fresh peaches. I have never made peach pie and quite frankly I have never been a big fan of it. However, my husband is and I had to use these peaches. I liked the idea of no thickeners other recipes call for other than flour. After reading reviews I was concerned about juicy peaches turning it too soupy so here is my solution: I added 2 extra tbls of flour and after cutting my peaches up the night before in a covrd container which made more juice, I strained them in collander and dumped them onto paper towels to soak up a lot of juice just for a few min. I also added 1/4-1/2 tsp of cinn to flour mixture. Here's a trick from Martha Stewart, instead of using an egg wash, if you use a full (not lattice) crust like I did, use a basting or pastry brush and lightly brush milk on to of crust then sprinkle with sugar. It gives it a nice crusty glazed top. Also I used Pillsbury crust (not store brand) every time I make a pie. Homemade crust is too much work. It took at least and hour to bake, no spillage because no excessive juice. Like others, at an hour after crust lightly browned, I turned oven off and left it in until warm, not hot.  Letting it sit and cool lets everything settle and thicken. It was wonderful. My husbnd loved it and I liked it too. It was not too sweet at all. This one is a keeper.

I never made a peach pie before.  This was such a huge hit with my family that I had to make another pie.  I pre-bake my pie crust about 7-10 mins prior to pouring the peach filling into it.  Also, the fresh peaches that I used were very juicy.  I drained so of the liquid for fear that too much juice would make the pie crust mushy.

Ok, so in order to combat possible runniness, I added 2 tbsp cornstarch but instead of using 10 FRESH peaches, I used 5 cups sliced CANNED peaches (which is the usual amount of fruit I use for Apple Crumble Pie, so I figured it would be enough)

I will def. make again, and with more peaches!

This is a great pie.  I use Marie Callender frozen pie crusts.  After I slice the peaches I add a little almond extract.  Other spices make it taste too much like an apple pie.

OK, I hereby swear that I will never again make a recipe w/out reading the reviews first.  The crust was seriously undercooked and the only thing that saved this pie is that the fresh peaches I used were wonderfully sweet.  Next time I will add - 2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1 t. vanilla, and bake the first 15 min. @ 450 deg then bake another 45 min.  I believe the bottom crust should have been baked before adding the filling, too.  Oh well..

I ended up with a GREAT pie but I felt that I had to adjust this recipe too much.  I will not be using it again.
First of all, I made this into a Peach Raspberry pie but substituting some of the peaches for 2 cartons of fresh raspberries.  
Like everyone else said, it was too runny, even with added cornstarch.  Cornstarch is much better for fruit pies so it should probably be used in replace of the flour.  Luckily my lattice top held up nicely because I ended up pouring much of the liquid out through the top!  After it cooled, I put it in the fridge to help it set up a bit too.  Thankfully all this helped and it had a nice consistency when I served it.  Also, I have never seen a pie recipe that bakes at 350.. thats way too low.  I started it at 350 and then realized there was no way it was going to bake right so I changed it to 425 and basically baked it for the full time at that temp. Worked perfectly.
I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar, like other reviewers.. I added in some vanilla extract and I mixed everything together instead of layering.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg into my pie crust, and a bit of ginger into the pie.  I ended up with a great pie but basically changed the whole recipe.

I soak the peaches in lime juice.  I also used 1/2 white , 1/2 brown sugar. And a some cinnamon and  a bit of nutmeg.  I didn't need the cornstarch.  Maybe it's because I rested the peaches on paper towels to dry off a bit before tossing in the crumb mixture.  As for the butter cut into the pie, I put the stick of butter in the freezer for a little bit and then used the cheese grater and grated the butter into the crumb mixture and then tossed the peaches in the mix.  I do the same thing when making the pie crust--what a huge time saver when cutting the butter into the flour!  
You know what?  This recipe is an excellent basic starter that's easy to customize to your taste/preference.

This was a great recipe and easier than most.  We have to avoid sugar, so I used 1/4 cup Splenda Baking Sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar.  To cut the sweetness, I splashed the filling with lemon juice before putting the top crust on.  Like one of the previous reviewers, I also added a heaping tablespoon of corn starch to the flour.  It was my first non-runny peach pie!  All in all, this got rave reviews from the extended family and I'm getting ready to make a 2nd pie for my husband, who wanted more!  Thanks...

Presentation was fabulous, it was not runny whatsoever and it tasted really good with vanilla ice cream, but I will go back to my recipe where you toss the peaches with the sugar, flour and cinnamon and dot with the butter. This one with the layers just didn't have a smooth all around flavour (you could tell it was layered). As others suggested, I also used half brown sugar, some cinnamon and did an egg wash with sprinkled sugar. I baked at 450 for 15 min and then 35 min @350. Still a tasty recipe but wouldn't make again, sorry.

Very best peach pie I have ever tasted and very easy to make. I did as suggested and left it in the oven while the oven cooled and it worked great. I made one with a double crust and that was just as good.

Made just a few changes here. I melted my butter, added an egg, only two tablespoons of flour, about a teaspoon of cinnamon and poured the mixture over the peaches. We loved it Marcia!

Very good! I baked tris pie 2 or 3 times already, last time come out VERY runny; I think it may dipend on the peaches: 10 weighted more than 5 pounds! I only used 8 but still  were probably too many. I think it would be more accurate to give a weight more than a number of peaches... Size can vary!

Ok i did this recipe 1. because I was in a hurry and it was the simplest and 2. the beautiful picture.

Boy was I surprised!!! 

It turned out looking exactly like the picture and was the BEST Peach Pie EVER!! 

I have to admit on the first one I goofed and I used a full stick of margarine instead of half a stick of butter. It was an awesome mistake! I am waiting on the second one to come out of the oven right now to see what it will be like with the original amount. I bet it is just as good.

This was so easy!  I only used 6 peaches and added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the flour, sugar and butter mixture.  I layered the pie by putting two peaches in bottom of pie pan, added 1/3 of the flour mixture, then repeated with the peaches and flour mixture two more times.  Cooked at 425 for 15 minutes and lowered temp to 350 for an additional 1/2 hour.  Came out perfect!

This was the first time I have ever made a peach pie so I was not sure how it would go.  I read some reviews, and followed some tips.  Used the half and half sugar.  I added pumpkin pie spice.  A heaping tablespoon of cornstarch.  I mixed it all together in a bowl and plopped it in the shell.  Didn't do a lattice top, just regular.  Washed it with egg and a bit of sugar. I cooked for the 15 min and 30 min ratio.  Then left in the oven when done for an hour or so.  It was awesome.

Very yummy! I followed other reviews and left the pie in the oven as it cooled, and I also glazed the top with a butter, cinnamon and sugar combo - it turned out fantastic!

Loved it!  It is a bit runny but was like a syrup and went awesome with ice cream.  Will make over and over again.  I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg but other than that, followed it to a T.

I followed this recipe exactly, and my Georgia-bred husband declared it the best peach pie he'd ever eaten! Pretty high praise for something that was so easy to make!  The peaches were a tad overripe, and we both think this really boosted the flavor.  If you don't have time to make the crust, Trader Joe's carries frozen dough that made a perfect crust.

WOW, I have never made such a nice pie and this was easier than making an apple pie..using the tips of boiling the peaches to remove the skins and running them in cold water after. Easy easy!
I follow the other advise with 1/2 c Brown 1/2 c white sugars, 1 tbls cornstarch and crumbled the butter in the flour mixture..1/3 cup of flour. 
Cooled the pie in the over as other had said, it set up perfectly! 
Thanks for all the tips, they really helped and this was a keeper recipe. Even at High Altitude

This is the best fruit pie that I have ever made!!!!  I did not change anything except I added a tsp of cornstarch to the flour, butter and sugar, and I topped each layer of peaches with sprinkles of ground cinnamon.  So good!  Also, I recommend peeling the peaches(even though this can be laborous, I just use a knife.)  But it is not neccessary.  Also, you do not have to do lattice strips for the top pie crust.  I just followed the instructions from the lady in the cooking video attached to this recipe.  Thankyou so much! my family loves this!:)

I liked this pie pretty well, but I had to bake mine 20 minutes more to make the peaches cooked all the way through. That could have just been the kind of peaches I was using, though-they were white and hard peaches.

It was very simple and easy to make, but the flavors were simple as well-if that's what you like. 

I think next time I would add some warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and

 use brown sugar instead of white for the crumbly mixture inside the pie. 

I might also use more ripe, sweeter, yellow peaches for this.

Easy, perfect pie!  We made the recipe with peaches from our tree using the ingredients listed.  The only change was to put a top crust on instead of the lattice.  I put plenty of slits in the top and then after cooking for 45 minutes, I turned off the stove and left the pie in the oven for an additional half hour or so.  It was wonderful.  I am about to make too more that I will bake and then freeze for later. Thank you Marcia Kammann for the wonderful recipe.

Overall...very good recipe.  Easy to assemble, followed the 15 mins @ 450 then 30 @ 350, added the tbsl of cornstarch as others suggested.  Looked BEAUTIFUL when it came out of the oven.  I never made a peach pie before and was quite proud of myself....mission accomplished!  Almost....I ended up with WAY too much liquid, but crisis averted....turned it into a wonderful cobbler and topped with some vanilla ice cream!!  I'm pretty sure that the excess liquid was my fault though....I used peaches I froze last year and they were only about 1/2 thawed when I made the pie.  I didn't account properly for all the excess liquid I'd get.  Will definitely keep this and use it again...with fresh peaches next time!

I am not a big fruit pie person, but this is great!  I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar mixture and sprinkled it on top of the pie.  I followed what others had recommended and baked at 450 for 10 min and than 350 for 30 mins.  I left the pie in the oven after I turned it off for about 10 mins.  It was perfect.

Perfect!  I did use half brown and half white sugar, plus about a Tablespoon of corn starch.  I baked it at 350 the full 45 minutes, then turned off the oven and let the pie sit in there for another half hour (as suggested by previous reviewers).  Great!

Set up perfectly (I turned off the oven and left it in to cool). I just followed the recipe--no cinnamon or anything. I think next time I'd add a dash of ginger & nutmeg or something to awaken the flavor a bit. Very good though!

This was my first peach pie and it was a hit! Everyone raved about how good it was.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added blueberries, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I let the pie cool in the oven for 2 hours to let it set, came out perfect.  I had to make it twice in one week because of how good it was.

With peaches being in season, I wanted to make a fresh pie.  This recipe is wonderful.  I mixed the peaches with the flour, 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugar and about 1/4 teasp salt and put it into the pie shell. I only used about 1 tablespoon of butter to dot the filling.  It took longer, about 55 min to bake, but came out perfectly.

The pie was good but very runny. I added corn starch as suggested and let it cool in the oven but you could not get a slice out of the tin, had to scoop it out with  a spoon. My peaches were very ripe so that could have been part of the problem. Next time I will also cut back on the sugar. Added a little cinnamon that gave it a nice flavor.

I read the reviews and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and added cinnamon.  This is an easy recipe and the payoff was wonderful.  Great pie!  I will definitely make this again.

This comment is for erin1975, who said her crust did not completely cook at the bottom. I have not tried this recipe but I do bake desserts from time to time. I have found that when I bake sweet potato pies I bake my crust about 5 minutes before adding my ingrediernts to ensure the crust gets fully cooked. Works like a charm! Hope this helps.

Delicious! I used two bags of frozen peaches (run under water beforehand to thaw, I didn't know if you could just bake them frozen but I didn't want to risk it). I also used half brown sugar, half white, and threw in a tbsp of cornstarch. And now that I think about it, I forgot the butter completely! But it was delicious, didn't notice the lack at all!

Very good pie! It did come out a bit runny though despite incorporating some of the suggestions here - turning off the oven once done and letting it sit & also leaving out on the counter for a while after that. Maybe the peaches were just unusually juicy??? Good pie none the less!

My husband and I made this pie with the peaches we bought from Georgia. It was delicious and I think it will be a new family favorite!! Very very easy also!

We stopped and purchased fresh peaches on the way back from our 4th of July camping trip. This recipe caught my eye, with the use of the crumble mixture between layers. I followed the recipe , but did a full crust on top.   I also followed the cooling down advice to prevent a liquidy pie and it worked beautifully. This peach pie is fantastic, just like grandma's. I'll definitely stay this recipe - it's the one!

the pie was soupy for some reason, and I followed the recipe precisely. I think more flour was necessary.

I was worry about this recipe since alot of people said it was runny so I did use some of the suggestions. I did add a heaping tablespoon of cornsarch and 1/2c. white and 1/2c. brown sugar and added Allspice which next time would leave out Allspice and just add cinnamon for my taste. Over all this pie turned out GOOD and not runny.

Decent place to start, but too sweet for our tastes.  I would cut the sugar back by 1/4C and use brown rather than white.  I used a heaping 1/3 cup measure for the flour and baked it at 450F for 15 minutes and then at 350F for the remaining 30.  I had other things to bake, so I couldn't leave it in the oven to cool.  But it set up just fine anyway.

This pie had a good flavor.  But it was too messy. A few others had the same problem, but alot of people didn't mention the problem. So, it might be the peaches. Depending on the type of peaches and their ripeness it might cause more liquid.  I will try this again, use a little more flour to thicken it up and bake a few minutes longer.

omg. this peach pie is insane. I just made my FIRST fruit pie ever and it was this one for a BBQ with fresh peaches. Everyone gobbled it up and said it reminded them of their grandmas or moms pie. I was almost laughing, because it was my first one ever!!!!! LOOK NO FURTHER, this should be in everyones recipe box.  Because you can probably use a lot of different fruits for this pie. THANK YOU!

This is such an easy recipe and we absolutely love it! I also used half brown sugar and only added cinnamon as it was all I had.  I let the peaches dry out for awhile so it wasnt too juicy or runny and it turned out perfectly! Thank you so much for the recipe, I will definately make it again!

This is a great pie! I used frozen peaches, and followed others' recommendations to use half white and half brown sugar. Also added 1 t cinnamon and 1 T cornstarch. Baked for 15 minutes at 425, then 30 minutes at 350. Then let sit for 15 minutes in the oven after I turned it off. A very simple, easy recipe for an old-fashioned favorite.

I have made this pie several times now using not only peaches but blakberries as well and we LOVE it!!! It is a wonderful simple recipe that has worked for me every time. I used a full crust on top instead of the lattice and my oven required additional cook time but other than that I did not change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I had to cook the pie about 20 minutes longer before the crust browned up some.  It was delicious fresh out of the oven.  After it cooled, though, it was quite thick and a little too dry.  One thing I might try is cooking the filling on the stove top until it gets a little thick and to experiment with flavoring-you can keep adding spices and tasting this way.  It's a little cheat trick of mine.  Then pour it into the crust while hot and bake until the crust is done.  I think the hot filling will help the crust cook faster and probably not over bake the filling making it so thick after it cools.

I just tried this recipe last night, for Thanksgiving tomorrow and it was good. I bought that new premade crust from pilsbury in the biscuit/butter aisle that just rolls out (instead of the crappy folded crust) and it was very good, but the bottom of my crust was a little too moist. I'm going to prebake my crust next time.

This pie has a good flavor, but it was too runny. To me it was more of a cobbler instead of a pie, I even let it set in the oven after it was done. I will be looking for a different recipe.
Thanks

I thought it was easy to make. The finished product was way too sweet,it might be wise to lessen the amount of sugar.But, otherwise,the ingredients made a nice filling for the peaches. I used ready to bake crusts and it came out fine.

This pie was great! I took one cook's advice and added 1 heaping tbs. cornstarch, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. nutmeg.  Mix it all together with the peaches, did not layer, and dumped it into a Pillsbury pie crust. Added some cubes of butter and put the top crust on.  I didn't lattice the crust. Brushed it with an egg wash.  I baked it  at 450 for the first 15 min. then turned the oven down baked it for 30 more minutes.  When done I turned off the oven and left it in there for over an hour and served it warm.  My husband is not a fan of peach pie, but he loved it!!  I would definitely recommend this pie.

I substituted nectarines for the peaches.  The fruit was very sweet, very ripe and very juicy, and I was a little concerned that I'd end up with a runny pie filling.  I added 2 Tbsp of Minute Tapioca and about 1 tsp of cornstarch to the nectarines, and cut the sugar in half (personal taste preference).  Ended up taking about 1 hour for the pie to bake and start to brown.  Good pie!

I made this for the first time last night.  I followed the directions precisely; I don't like to mess with a recipe the first time. It turned out amazing!  Sweet and delicious, just like we like it.  My whole family loved it.  It was a bit runny, so I think next time I'll follow a previous reviewer's suggestion and cool the pie completely in the oven (if I can wait that long!).

Bought a box of fresh peaches from a local fruit stand & made 4 pies. Used 1/2 c white & 1/2 c brown sugar. Added 1 Tbsp cornstarch & 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Used top crust because i didn't want to mess with lattice. Baked at 425 for 15 min then turned down oven for rest of baking time. Let pies rest in oven for a couple hrs to set. Served a la mode, of course.

Pie tasted delicious.  I took advice of other reviewers and left pie in the oven after turning off to set and pie crust was somewhat on the well done side. Nothing to do with the recipe itself, just next time I will turn off oven little sooner and let it set as it continues to bake.  Thanks for the recipe Marcia!

I do a lot of cheating! First off, I purchase premade crusts. Secondly I buy a jar of peaches (a glass jar, not a can) from Trdaer Joe's. They taste like fresh and they're not dipped in syrup! The very first time I made this recipe I followed the instructions (layer peaches and filling until you use up both) and it was way too runny. So the second time I only used about half the filling and I just tossed the rest away. Also I added the cinnamon and nutmeg that other reviews mentioned and it was AMAZING! It makes the whole pie better! And thirdly I listened to other viewers and cooked the pie at 450 for 15 mins, then at 350 for 30 mins. Well, the second time around I had a raw crust on the bottom. What? I googled this and it seems to be a common enough problem. The advice was not only to leave the pie in the oven cooling but, if your oven allows, take out the bottom rack and rest the pie tin directly on the metal base of the oven. The lingering heat will keep cooking the crust even as the rest of the pie cools down. The third time I made it - Perfecto!

I used this recipe for the first time making a fresh peach pie.  I used my mom's homemade pie crust recipe that I have been using for 35 years!  I thought it was great and my husband became mesmerized from it!!  He said to me, "what are you doing to me!!" Next time I am going to try the suggestion with the brown sugar.

Didn't anyone else's glaze turn into a doughy mess from the 1/3 cup flour?  Bells & whistles should have gone off when I made this recipe!  It would have been great, but a glaze should be a glaze!

I will give 4 stars only because of the adjustments I had to make to the recipes.  The end result was delicious.  Three tips:  add 1 Tbsp cornstarch, decrease the amount of sugar to 1/2-3/4 cups and leave pie in the oven 1-2 hours AFTER baking time to set.

I made this last night and it was awesome! I used frozen peaches and it was great. I do highly recommend starting it at 450 for 15 minutes and 350 for 30 minutes. Works very well for me. With 6 kids this didn't last a day. Today I made it with three fresh peaches and a small bag of frozen raspberries (minus any juice) and I think I'm in heaven. With a recipe this easy, how am I going to continue to fit in my pants? !

A very good recipe!  I HIGHLY recommend using this filling with the "French Pastry" recipe posted by an allrecipes user named "TJ"  It makes the pie SO much better and you can use either butter or shortening depending on if you like crispy or soft crust!
I would add vanilla!  And it takes time and attention to ensure it sets right!

Super easy to make! We have a peach tree so I thawed out the last of our peaches. I used two premade pie crusts. I split the sugar between brown sugar and Splenda sugar and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to it. I also did as others recommended and added a little cornstarch to the mixture. I baked it at 450 for 15 minutes and finished the 30 minutes on 350. I just left it there with the oven open. PERFECT! My husband had two pieces and said it was delish!

Not my favorite. Not bad, but doesn't taste like peaches anymore--i have to say, i took everyone's advice, used half brown sugar, half white, added some cinnamon and a little nutmeg, and it was ok--but it tasted more like a weak apple pie than peaches. i will try this again without all of everybody's input--but i think i'll use cornstarch instead of flour and cut out the butter. last time the pie was SOOOOO dry because all the flour took up every bit of the moisture!!! ALSO: i strongly suggest blind-baking the pie--it didn't say to do this, so i didn't, and other reviewers said they didn't do it and it came out fine--the bottom of my pie wasn't fully cooked so i wound up taking each slice and putting it upside down in a hot oven for a bit for it to get cooked and crispy. again, not bad, if you're looking for apple pie flavor, if not maybe try the recipe as it is written (even though i'm definitely recommending using cornstarch instead of flour--3Tb should do fine)

This pie was delish. I found it a little sweet for my taste (which is quite shocking to me) but I think it could have used more peaches.  Some of mine had gone bad by the time I wanted to make the pie, so it was a little lacking in peaches.  Overall, a GREAT pie!

This is delicious, mine did turn out a little runny.  I did make some changes based on the other reviews.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also did a full crust on top, cutting 4 slits and doing an egg wash with cinnamon mixed in and then a light dusting of sugar.  I will definitely make this again, possibly adding more corn starch or cut down the butter so it is not so runny.

I added lime juice while I let the peaches drain. Also used yellow and white peaches. Tossed in two strawberries. Also I tossed everything in cornstarch about 2 tablespoons. I also used half white and half brown sugar. I used a store bought frozen crust. I removed the top crust from the pan while it was still frozen and let it thaw upside down for about !0 min. Then I added cinn sugar to the top and coated with a little butter. The recipe is a good base to start with. Also I let the pie sit in  the oven for 10 min. Everyone loved the pie! very easy! One more thing I didn't need 10 peaches I only used about 5 and most my peaches where not ripe. However they came out nice and soft and delicious.!!

Wow! I have tried many different variations for peach pie, and this one is absoluely the best ! scoop the peaches up with a slotted spoon to drain off the juice,,it will be perfect anytime - off course you do need a perfect flakey crust !!

WARNING - The great ratings for this recipe are for a MODIFIED version with CORNSTARCH. With fresh peaches, the original recipe came out of the oven a soupy mess.

DELICIOUS as written!!! I got many compliments on this pie and it is DEFINITELY a keeper!! I did follow the other posters suggestion of leaving it in the oven to let it thicken, and I only had one crust, so it wasn't a double. It was still great!!

Tasteless, runny.  I had to use frozen peaches, as no fresh we available.  I allowed them to thaw so the pie wouldn't be runny.  I followed tips of others and did half brown sugar half white....it was bitter and tasteless.  Guess I will continue looking for a GOOD peach pie recipe, cause this is not it!

We loved this pie. However, it was runny so it was more like a cobbler than a pie.  I used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar as some recommneded.  I also let pie sit in the oven past bake time.  Still runny.  What I might do next time is bake at higher temperature for a bit longer, and protect pastry w/ foil so it doesn't burn.  All in all, it was delicious.

Simple and easy to make, and delicious, but a couple of key changes: 1) I used 1/2 the sugar which was plenty 2) I would blanch and peel the peaches - much more palatable than getting peach skin in your teeth!

this recipe was pretty good, I followed the advice of adding some cornstarch and a bit more flour and it didn't run at all, actually the peaches were even a bit mushy but that might be because i used really ripe peaches. anyway it was delicious!

I'm not a big pie maker but decided to give this recipe a try. I used a combination of nectarines and peaches and added cinnamon to the fruits. I'm horrible on making homemade crust so I used store bought dough. I ended up with two pies. I brushed an egg wash over the lattice and covered the edges with foil. I also placed foil under the pie pan to prevent spillage. Then took of the foil off the crust after 40 minutes. The crumb mixture was an interesting twist to the pie recipe and it's a great idea. The pies turned out delicious! Will make again, maybe try it with apples.

Hello I just made this pie this morning with fresh farm peaches I had and I am certainly glad I did it was very easy to follow for me I used store bought crust tho I followed the directions by letting it set in the oven while off for about an hr I tried to wait as long as I could before cutting a slice there was juices but it was still rather warm I just couldn't help myself in waiting any longer lol I will definitely make this again  I actually prefer some juices in the bottom of my pie plate oh I forgot I did one change I brushed the top then with melted butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar I'm sure by this evening it will have set up more and be just as delicious as it is now thank you I will make this over and over while peaches are in full season  Tammy

This had a good taste but it was super duper runny. I should have followed other's advice and added flour. I also didn't put the lattice top but added brown sugar & cinnamon to the top with the sugar/butter/flour mixture. Next time I will definitely add flour to the filling.

Great flavor, left in oven like the others did but it was still a little runny.  Next time I will add some extra cornstarch, I would rather have it be on the thick side than the runny.

This was pretty tasty.  And easy, not counting peeling the peaches.  Despite someone's recommendation to boil them for 1 min. and plunge into cold water, I still needed to use a vegetable peeler.  Also, use small to medium peaches.  I had 10 large peaches from Costco and it made 2 pies.

Glad I tried this. I was trying to avoid a runny cobbler. This was a good recipe. It avoids runny and undercooked crust. I added lemon zest and a sprinkle of nutmeg. This will become my standard peach pie.

Excellent pie!  I only managed to fit about 6 peaches in my pie pan - they were big ones from our local orchard.  I let the pie sit in the oven after I turned it off, as others have recommended, and the pie goo set up just fine.  I will definitely make this recipe again!!!

This was my first peach pie and it turned out great! I added a little cinnamon to the mix and as another reviewer did, I tossed the peaches with the flour and sugar and dotted the butter over the top. I also left the pie in the oven to cool and set-up and that worked too! great recipe.

Delicious, but a bit sweet for our family. Also, turned out real soupy. I think it was because we used our fresh very juicy peaches off our tree.

Wonderful! I changed added/ changed a few things. I used 1/2 half brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I did also add 1tbsp cornstarch also. I used canned peaches, drained them while I was doing the other part and after they drained I used them. I topped the lattice with an egg wash and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the top. I also did cook on 450 for 15 minutes and then back to 340 for 30 minutes. It was so easy and I will be making this one for family gatherings soon!

How odd to read an identical version of the pie I have been making 'forever', passed down from my Mom.  We are pie makers and eaters.  Actually, pie making is so easy, I only used approximate measurements and they turn out perfect everytime.  It's the love!!  Just ask my brother and friends, who often request pie for breakfast!!

Soooo yummy, I did use the T. of cornstarch, added 1 cup of blueberries and sooooo couldn't wait the whole time for the "leave it in the oven to cool down" trick suggested by others. I left it for about 45 min. and it was still runny...but, I don't care it was delic. And the next day, it wasn't as runny.

This was my first time to make peach pie with fresh peaches! It was just wonderful. I used the suggestions of using white and brown sugar and adding a little cinnamon. I also let it cool in the oven, and while it still came out a little runny, it was amazing! I will try adding a little corn starch next time to thicken it up, but a definite repeat!

Very easy and tasted like a traditional peach pie, the crumb mixture sounds odd but is very good.  I didn't quite use all of it, next time I will probably cut the mixture in half--also added a little ground ginger to the peaches.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I added one teaspoon of cinnamon and one heaping tablespoon of cornstarch.  Also, I used canned peaches and left the pie in the cooling oven to burn off excess liquid.  Overall, the pie turned out perfectly.  It was delicious after cooling and firm after refrigerating.

I used a lot of the reviews for this pie when making it. I think the addition of cornstarch and leaving it in the oven for a little extra time (with the oven off) was helpful, as well as a higher baking temperature (I did 375 for 45 minutes). It was still a little messy, but it was a good tasting pie. I also added lemon juice, ginger, and a dash of cinnamon to mine. Oh, and I pre-baked the bottom crust so it wouldn't be mushy or not cooked through. I did an egg wash over the top crust, so it was a really gorgeous little pie when I was done. (In order to not burn the pre-baked bottom, I made a guard with foil over the edges for most of the cooking time, only removing it for the last maybe 10 minutes.) Though, I think there are better recipes out there, so I will either continue tweaking this one while I try to find another. Overall, it was good, but I think it could've been better.

I made the mistake of not reading reviews before making and it was a runny mess and the crust was not cooked.  I am going to try this recipe again because I love the simplicity of it, but next time I'll use the advice listed below and maybe even update this review.  I'm determined to work this out because I love peach pie!

This is a good recipe, but I made some changes. I added one teaspoon of vanilla to the peaches, then I used 1/2 cup of BROWN sugar & 1/2 cup of regular sugar. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Instead of layering the peaches & sugar, flour, butter mixture, I tossed it with the peaches & poured it all into the pie shell. It took a lot longer to cook than the recipe stated, but it tasted great, especially with the Cinnamon Ice Cream (submited by Elizabeth) from this site.

First time pie maker with this one. It came out great.  I used frozen peaches about 40oz and found I probably could have used one more package.  I added about 1 tablespoon corn starch and filling was perfect.  Forgot the spices, but will try next time.  I will also try less crust on top or a crumb type topping.  My family just is not a big crust fan.  I mixed all ingredients together in bowl instead of layering per other reviews, really worked well.

My husband is a friut pie fanatic, and he went haywire for this pie. It's  totally delicious! You shouldn't waste your time w/ store bought crust - make your own, it's worth the effort! FYI I love the Martha Stewart pie crust recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I had to use frozen peaches because they are not in season right now, but it still turned out perfectly!  As another reviewer said I let the pie sit in the oven after turning off the baking heat to set.  I also added 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour.  Delicious!!!

I wanted to make this pie the easiest way possible last night (I was feeling lazy!).  So as a previous poster suggested, I mixed the flour, sugar, and a tablespoon of cornstarch and then tossed/coated the peaches with this mixture.  I piled the peach mixture into a store-bought crust, cut the butter into pats and placed them across the top, and covered with another store-bought crust.  Cut slits and baked at 350 - I had to bake for an hour, but I'm not sure if that was my oven or because I was using a dark nonstick pie plate.  The fresh peach filling was the ABSOLUTE perfect texture, not the least bit runny, and tasted delicious.  My husband was in heaven.  I doubt I'll make this any other way from now on.

What an amazing recipe! I made it yesterday and it was gone before we knew it. My husband went to the store today to get me some more peaches...so that I could make it again..right away! It was the best peach pie recipe Iv'e ever tried (I've tried quite a few) I did use half brown sugar and half white. I just sprinkled some cinnamon on top before I put the top crust on. We ate it a little warm with ice-cream, yum.

I used the recommendations in the other reviews and changed my cooking time/temperature, used 1/2 brown sugar and added cinnamon!  Everyone loved it.  Even my son ate it and he is really picky!  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll use it again!

Excellent recipe.  I used Pillsbury pie crusts and used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white.  I baked it at 450 for 15 minutes and then at 375 for 30 minutes - turned out perfectly!  I gave half the pie to my neighbor and she loved it too.  One thing the recipe didn't specify was to peel the peaches, which I did.  I'll be making this again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly as instructed and and my pie came out very watery however,I found it to be very tasty.  I will try to bake another, and this time leave it in the oven to cool to see if it makes a difference in respect to its thickness.

Next time I'm sticking with a scratch peach cobbler. I spent more time than this pie called for. It is missing a lot of ingredients. Very runny, and no taste. I live close to SC, and we get the best peaches in the USA so I'm much used to better. Sorry Marcia.

So easy to make!  I did find that I only need 5 peaches.  I followed the suggestions to let the pie sit in the oven as it cooled. Turned out lovely.  I made a lattice for the top of the pie, brushed it with egg and sprinkled sugar over it.  No one would have guessed that I didn't slave over this!  Will make again.

Excellent!!
This was the easiest peach pie I've ever made.
Fresh peaches were not available, so I used frozen,already sliced. I also cheated and used frozen pre-made pie crusts. TALK ABOUT EASY!
But,Everyone loved it!  We've already made it once more and plan to make it for our big family Christmas Eve Dinner. Next time I will try the cooling thing, as it can be a little too juicy.

I have NEVER in my life (44 yrs) made a pie. I just got married for the first time and decided to domesticate myself a bit. I tackled this Peach Pie. Even if I do say so myself it was absolutely delicious! My husband is still in culinary shock over this pie! Thanks for this great and easy recipe. If I could bake it ANYBODY can !!!!!

Since this was my first ever peach pie, I didn't know it could get runny! I should have read the reviews about cornstarch, etc.   The taste was definitely there especially with my go-to crust recipie. I love simple and fresh.  Better luck next time!

I used this recipe to make a pie for a pie competition and won first place. I didn't seem to have any of the problems other reviewers  mentioned. In the beginning i was actually afraid the recipe would be too dry, but it turned out perfect!

Disclaimer: I did make some changes. The flavor was great, but mine was an incredibly soupy mess. I used nectarines instead of peaches, brown sugar instead of white  cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup, and didn't have a whole crust or even a lattice for the top, since I was using a previously prepared dough and didn't have enough. I can't imagine that letting it sit in the oven would have set it up anywhere near enough. As it was, I poured easily over a cup of liquid out of the pie, and it was still a puddle. It also leaked out all over my counter. Maybe it was the substitutions? I can't see how nectarines instead of peaches or reducing the sugar would make it wetter, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Again, the flavor was great.

I made this pie following the directions and was not very impressed with the flavor. It tasted OK, but it wasn't memorable. It wasn't runny because I added a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch & let it sit in the oven 2-3 hours after baking. I gave 3 stars for the lackluster flavor.

I made another pie a week later, and it absolutely blew me away! (It's the pie in my photo.) Here's what I did differently: I put all the sliced peaches in a bowl with 2-3 Tbs of melted salted butter. I added 1/2 C of white and 1/2 C of brown sugar, followed by cinnamon to taste and that heaping Tbs of cornstarch. I gently mixed this up & set it aside while I made the crust. I always use "Best Ever Pie Crust" by Jean Haseloh from this site. It's a home run. (I recommend a lattice-top. It's pretty easy & it combats Runny Pie Syndrome. Just Google a video on how to make one.) I put half the dough in the fridge while I rolled out the bottom layer & put it in the pie pan. I added the filling, then made the lattice-top out of the chilled portion of the crust. (Helpful hint: I roll my crust out on a sheet of parchment paper to make it easier to transfer into the pan and to pick up the lattice strips.) I added an egg wash on top to give the crust some color since it didn't get very golden the first time around. Then I sprinkled 2 pinches of coarse-ground raw sugar on top for added texture. This adjusted recipe was SO good that my husband's friend ate 3 HUGE pieces for dessert in one sitting!

Delicious and very easy!  
I followed the directions exactly and took the suggestion of other reviewers and let the pie sit in the warm oven after baking.  The pie was still a little runny, I will try a little cornstarch next time.  I will peel the peaches next time too.

Best pie ever!!! We made it with organic fresh peaches from our tree....made a few additions. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg..1 tsp Cinnamon..1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup white sugar and the rest brown sugar to make the 1 cup sugar. Made a crisscross pie top and coated with egg white from organic egg from our hens. My friend and I made 2 pies in deep dish crusts adding more peaches than recipe calls for. To top it off ..when they were served we topped slices with Vanilla Bean Ice cream..mmm! What a life! Highly recommend this easy delicious Peach Pie recipe !!!!!

After reading other people's reviews, I added cornstarch and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup white sugar.  Even with the cornstarch, it had a lot of liquid and the bottom was mushy.  However, I gave it four stars because I loved the taste.  The peaches were fresh and sweet, which, in my opinion, made up for the excess liquid.  I will definitely make again, but will try more modifications to combat the mushiness and excess liquid.  This recipes is definitely worth a try.

Delicious! I followed some ideas in the comments - added some cinnamon and nutmeg, half/half brown & white sugar, some cornstarch, cooked the pie at 450F for 15 minutes before reducing to 350F and continuing to cook for another 45 minutes. I also left the pie in the cooling oven for another 1.5 hours after baking, and it set up beautifully without the crust getting too done. We actually ate it warm. Best peach pie I've ever made!

Made this pie as the recipe directs but with a crumble topping. Delicious but very sweet. Next time I will use half white & half brown sugar and a touch of ginger. Was wonderful served warm with a small dollop of mascarpone!

I followed everyone's suggestions and it was super runny still. That may have been partly my fault though. I used very ripe orchard peaches that were soooo juicy that we had peach juice running down our elbows just cutting them. We haven't tried it yet and will update my review once we do. 

We made it late last night and I fell asleep while it was cooling down in the oven. I woke up this morning and my husband said he took it out of the oven while it was still hot and steamy and covered it with foil to cool on the counter overnight. I ran to the pie to take the foil off but i was too late, the crust was no longer crisp and flaky. It had steamed in the foil and the crust is now soft and gooey. Sigh, I will have to try this again sometime in the morning where I don't have husband errors. Lol

Excellent, This is the first time I tried making a pie. I used store bought crust. Next time I will try my own. The only thing i did different was I followed someones suggestion and baked the first 15 minutes and 450. I think that was a little too hot.

Fruit pies can be tricky to get just right, but this is an awesome peach pie recipe. The peaches I used were large, and it only took 6 or 7 of them to fill up the pie plate to heaping. Also used a store-bought crust. Will make this crowd-pleaser again for sure!

I followed this recipe to a T...and it never set up. There was way to much juice to cut it. The taste of if was still pretty good though.

Delish!!! Next time will try the brown and white sugar combo. My peaches weren't really ripe so did not have a runny issue but if they are really juicy will remember to add the cornstarch. Thank you for the recipe...it was a big hit!

I made this as instructed, however, I felt the filling was a little too runny. Otherwise, it was good. The second time I made it, I doubled up on the flour.  That did the trick.  My husband and I were also fighting over whether we should have a peach pie or a peach 'crumble' the 2nd time around, so I negotiated the pie with the crumble on top.  The crumble I made consisted of 1/2 c flour, 1/4 c packed brown sugar, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg and 1/4 c of butter (softened).  It turned out great and was just what we needed the 2nd go round since I only had 1 crust.  We both got what we wanted.  I got my crumbles & my husband got his pie.  :)

Pie tasted and looked great.....until I cut it, way too runny.  My peaches were not overly ripe which I know can cause pies to be too juicy.  I will make this again but increase flour or add some cornstarch.  We still ate the pie, but it was more like a cobbler.  In fact next time I will make as a cobbler

Delicious. I added blackberries as well to the peach pie, about half a bag of frozen ones. This made enough for 2 pies. Easy as well. Would definitely try making this again.

I didn't change the recipe, but baked for a little longer, about five minutes, and left it in the cooling oven an addtional 15 minutes. The pie was moist, but not runny. We loved it.

Taste is DELICIOUS...BUT...even though I followed the directions, even though I heeded the advice of others and added cornstarch and just a little bit of butter on top, I still got a very wet cobbler.

This is the first time using a pie recipe with this type of filling.  It was a good pie overall, using the Crisco pie crust recipe.  I will use more peaches in the future.  I expected the pie to be sweeter than it was but was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't overly sweet.

This was a family hit!  Quick and easy to prepare. I have diabetics in the family and so I made it with Splenda blend brown sugar (using less than equivalent of brown sugar) and it was perfect.  It was served warm with "no sugar added" vanilla ice cream and was enjoyed by all!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I've already passed it along to 2 friends.

My 4yo daughter made this pie, all I got to do was cut the peaches and measure the dry ingredients for her, and help with the latice top. She litterally did EVERYTHING else. And, it tasted WONDERFUL. Only thing I would do different that we didn't do this time is an egg wash on the top so it's shiny. Other than that, perfect. If a 4yo can do it, so can you :)

I can see that it would have been good if it had cooked all the way. mine came out doughy. I think if I try it again I would cook it longer. It was very juicy, not saying thats a bad thing but maybe thats what made it not cook. like I said I would cook it longer maybe 55 to 65 min. instead of the 45min. like it says. It does have a good flavor, just needed to be cooked longer.

I just loved how this recipe turned out.  This was my first time making a peach pie and I must give myself a pat on the back.  But there was just one problem.  It was tooooooooooooo runny!!!  I have to admit that we used canned peaches, not fresh ones.  I think that had a lot to do with it.  We drained the peaches but to no avail.  We ended up filling up a coffee cup with all the juice that came out.  Taste is awesome, flavor is to die for.  After draining, it was edible.    Will make alterations next time if we decide to use canned peaches again but will definitely come back to this recipe.  It's a winner!

First peach pie I've made and it was excellent! Used fresh peaches. I left it in the oven and let it cool like some suggested, not runny at all. Everyone loved it!

I don't really like peach pies...and this was no exception. It was easy to make, and my family liked it, so I guess that's what counts! I tryed putting in half a cup of brown and white sugar as someone had suggested and added cinnamon. I think that inproved it a bit...

I read the reviews saying the pie came out sloppy so I followed the suggestions to add some corn starch.  I also baked it at 450 for the first 15 minutes then reduced for the rest of the baking time.  However, I still ended up with a sloppy mess? and the bottom crust didn't get baked.  I added cinnamon and allspice, which made the flavor good.  I might try this again, prebaking the bottom crust...but I'm not sold on this recipe

I used the recipe as well as some of the comments from other reviews.  I had very juicy peaches so I added about 1/4 cup of flour to them before putting them in, I also added cinnamon like another review said and it was divine!  The only issue I ran into was that I cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 and it was really gooey, so I cooked it for about 30 more minutes and it set up just fine.  The taste is fantastic.

Flavor was fabulous but I did have a prblem with is being runny inside.  I agree with other reviewers that I may have had really juicy fresh peaches.  If I make it in season again I'll add a little extra flour.  I'll also try leaving it in the oven to cool as others have suggested. Try serving with vanilla ice cream and butterscotch carmel topping. I'm repulsed at myself for doing that, but I'm going in for a second helping right now.

I have never made a pie in my life and this could not have been any better.  Very easy and VERY good.  I blanched the peaches in boiling water for 30 seconds and into ice water and the skins came right off.  The pie took a lot longer to bake, but came out delicious.  Don't be afraid to try this one!

should have read the other reviews - mine came out super runny, but also SUPER yummy. Ran out of sugar (!), so substituted about 1/3 of the white sugar with brown sugar - DEEE-LISH!

Loved this pie. I used some of the reviewers ideas. I added spice but I think I would like it without them. Next time! I cooked it at 450 for 15 min. then lowered to 350. After 15 minutes, hubby was pestering me to go somewher so I just turned the oven off and left. When I got back a couple of hours later, I had a perfect pie.

Very good recipe. The only thing that I didn't like was how the sugar/flour mixture seeped out after the first cut and seemed to be very separated when cool.

This is AWESOME!  I add a cream cheese layer under peaches.  8 oz cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 cup powdered sugar, whipped.  This makes it AMAZING!  I also use fresh strawberries sometimes using the same basic recipe.

Pretty darn good and so easy to make.  Mine came out a little runny, but it didn't detract from the flavor.  Warm with a scoop of ice cream, who cares if it's a little runny?

So easy and perfect results.  Used 2/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 white, but otherwise made as is.  Did as another reviewer suggested and blanched 10 peaches for a minute in boiling water then plunged into cold - skins slipped right off. It sat in the oven for a while (maybe an hour), then on the counter for another hour - it was absolutely perfect in terms of consistency, not watery at all, and those peaches were *ripe*!  Will definitely make this again.  One note: I like the crust a tiny bit more browned; might start at 450 for 10 minutes before reducing to 350 next time.

I had a big problem with soupiness, even after adding 1 T. cornstarch and letting the pie set for about 45 minutes after baking; however, the next day (today), it's perfect. Jumbo peaches were on sale, so I bought 10... only used 5 for this recipe. Think I'll buy another set of pre-made crusts and try it again to see if I can reduce the amount of liquid produced in the pie pan.

Fabulous!  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cornstarch to the flour mixture, and then added that to the peaches.  I also did half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also sprinkled cinnamon on the bottom of the pie crust.  Instead of the lattice, I did a regular crust, brushed with egg wash, and sprinkled with sugar.  I used frozen peaches instead of fresh and it worked great!

This pie was good but not great.  Unlike the some other reviews I had no problem with runniness, in fact mine was almost to dry.  I do have to say though that this pie seemed better the second day then it did the first.

GREAT recipe! Sprinkle cinnamon on the pie crust, do 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar, and add both cinnamon and nutmeg into the flour mix. Bake at 450 for 15 mins, 350 for 30 mins, then let her cool  for 1-2 hours in the oven with the heat off. All the reviewer adjustments proved this to be a delicious pie. Also delicious if you pour some cream into the dish for dipping.

This was the best pie.  I never made a peach pie before and this was so easy and set up perfectly!!  I took the advise of CBAMOM and made the same changes.  (That's what I gave it a 4 rating) And, let me tell you what, the boiling the peaches for a minute was time and peach saving.  I the first few peaches without boiling them first and barely had a peach to use.  I left the pie sit in the cooling oven... I actually made my at night and left it sit all night then refridgerated it in the morning.  It was BEAUTIFUL!!  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe and to the reviewers for all their wonderful tips.

This was the first time I made a peach pie and it turned out wonderful. The only thing that I changed was adding some corn starch because of extra juicy peaches. I also added a little cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.

This was my very first effort in baking a pie and it turned out wonderful!!! It was slightly soupy, but that might have been because my father-in-law couldn't wait for it too cool before cuting into it!

Great pie with these few changes as suggested by others, added a tsp. of cornstarch, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, also added extra spice. Cooked for an extra 15 minutes and allowed to cool before cutting. Came out perfectly.

This pie is awsome. I doubled the crumb mixture (but used about 1 3/4 c. sugar instead of a full 2 c.) I did not blanch the peaches, but as long as they're ripe they're easy to peal. I only ended up needing about 6 peaches. Next time I will slice my peaches a little thicker so they stand out a little more. I also used a full crust on top. I baked it at 425 for 12 minutes and at 375 for 30 minutes. Don't forget to put a baking sheet under the pie after about 30 minutes of baking so you don't get drips all over the bottom of your oven. DELICIOUS!!!!

This review may be unfair because I did not follow the original recipe and instead followed the suggestions of others. I started out by blanching the peaches for an easier removal of the skins. This may have been my first mistake, as there was a lot of liquid in the bowl. Along with the ingredients listed in the original recipe, I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 2 T. cornstarch, as well as cutting the white sugar to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 brown sugar. As others suggested, I mixed all of these ingredients together rather than layering. Once all of the ingredients were mixed together, I think I scooped out over a cup of liquid. I'm glad that I had a deep dish pie plate, because the peaches were overflowing. I baked the pie at 450 degrees for 15 minutes, and then at 350 for 40 minutes. My lattice crust was drowning in liquid. I had hoped that this would become thickened once it cooled, but I was wrong. When I cut into it liquid quickly filled up the gap in the pie plate from the piece I had just removed. The bottom crust seemed undercooked as well. Even with all of the above going wrong, I may have attempted again, but the flavor wasn't very good. I will keep searching for a better recipe.

So good! Mine was very liquidy too, but i didnt mind.
update: i used less butter as someone suggested and let it cool completely and it was not runny at all!  I did not add any cornstarch and peaches were perfectly ripe. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cut out little hearts from the leftover dough with a cookie cutter and did an egg wash too.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used the suggestion to add cornstarch and let it sit in the oven an extra 20 minutes on low to evaporate the juice.  Held together very well, but the bottom crust was a tad underbaked.

Next time I will use all the suggestions for the spices.

Thanks for such a simple yummy recipe.  :)

This was very simple and turned out great! I followed the basic directions with only a few differences. I used two bags of thawed frozen peaches, and thawed deep dish pie crusts. I also sprinkled a little nutmeg and cinnamon in the butter crumb mix before adding and topped the crust with an egg/milk wash and sprinkled in cinnamon and sugar. I live at a higher alt. so bake time for me was about 15 min. longer. Next time I may pre-bake the bottom pie shell a little before starting.

Great with the modifications suggested.  It came out very runy, even with a teaspoon of cornstartch.  Next time I'll use more, and possible put the crust in the oven for 5 min. to set, then add the peaches and put back.

This was the best peach pie I have ever made.  I followed the suggestions from other reviews, 1/4c tapioca, and the baking for 10 minutes at 425 and 35 minutes at 350.  It turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I have never made peach pie before and was overwhelmed with the number of variations out there!  I chose this one based on previous reviews and was glad I did!  It was a big hit!  I, too, used half brown, half sugar.  I also used frozen peaches--simply thawed and patted dry.  Finally, instead of cinnamon, I used some mulling spices and it turned out beautifully.  
Great, easy recipe!

Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!
Wow! I absolutely flipped over this pie! It was very simple to make, and absolutely delicious! I followed the advice of those before me and used a hotter oven and allowed it to set a bit there before allowing it to cool. I also split the white sugar with brown, and added a touch of cinnamon. Perfect! Thank you!

I had a problem with the consistancy of the filling with this one. The peaches were very ripe so this may have caused it, but it was a swimming pool when I cut it the next day. Also, I think it should start out baking in a 450F oven so the crust will set up. All the other recipes I saw started baking at a higher temp. and then lowered to 350 or so. But the taste was very, very good!

I made this pie and it was WONDERFUL!!!  All gone in 2 days!!  I took another's advice and added a bit of cinnamon to the mix.  Next time I will use more peaches though, as we like our pie with a bit more filling.

mm mm good! I subtracted 1/4 cup of the white sugar and replaced it with brown sugar. I also placed a few peaches at a time into the sugar mix to coat the peaches and then placed them into the pie crust. This was easy and fast!

Outstanding recipe. I have been looking for a peach pie recipe that would equal my grandmothers peach cobbler (a childhood favorite) for a long time. I go with a pie because Pillsbury does not make a square crust (my grandmother always made her own crust).

This was my first time making any kind of pie and it was great!  The pie was wonderfully easy to prepare and my family just loved it.  I did add a little extra flour to mine as some suggested (closer to 1/2 cup) and added a little pumpkin pie spice to my peaches.  Delicious!  My husband actually thought I bought this pie at the grocery store...it turned out just right!  Not runny at all...Thanks!

I thought this was okay, but bland. I added toasted almonds, cinnamon & nutmeg to the sugar/butter/flour combo, but still I wouldn't make it again. It is very simple & quick to make and maybe with a side of ice cream in the summertime it would make a refreshing light dessert. I used three cans of peaches (no fresh available) and drained them well, so I didn't encounter the run over problem.

This is really a good peach pie recipe.  I used frozen peaches as some of the other reviewers did, and had no problems.  I also let the pie set up in the cooling oven after the baking time was complete.  If the whim ever strikes me again to make a peach pie, I will be digging out this recipe.

Even though it did taste good, I had to eat it like peach pie soup. It was incredibly runny, I will not make this pie again.

I loved this pie and so did my neighbors.  I have made it quite a few times and found that sometimes it was juicy and sometimes not so juicy.  I think it depends on how ripe the peaches were.  Great recipe and good pie.

The best and easiest baked pie recipe to follow.  I had never made a pie before and have made more since and this was the easiest and tastiest.  My husband's favorite pie is peach, and he couldn't keep his hands off of it.  It was gone within the day I made it...

This pie gets eaten before any of the other desserts at family gatherings, and my husband requests it so that he can impress his family with my yummy cooking! It's actually the delicious sweet crumbly mixture that makes it so good, and I've never had a problem with consistency. This is the *best* peach pie I have ever eaten.

After reading some of the reviews, I tried adding extra flour used (1/2 cup) in hopes of making it less runny. I also cut the sugar in 1/2...I find most recipes use WAY too much sugar. It tasted good, but it was still VERY runny. I'm not sure I'll make this recipe again.

I'm not a baker, but this pie is SO easy and tastes SOOOOO good! It's probably a good idea to let it sit for about an hour after you take it out of the oven, in order for it to set. You gotta try it!!!!

This pie was good, my boyfriend really liked it.  The only problem was that it was VERY runny.  Not sure if it was something I did wrong.  I've made it several times, but it's always come out so runny.

A fine recipe made easier with ready made crusts.  Perfect for fresh Ga. peaches.  Next time I will cut down of the sugar some, but the taste is very good.

The pie seemed a little runny the second time I made this recipe.  I think that if the flour was increased by a 1/4c that it would help.  Also 45min baking time would have burnt the crust I recommend only 35min.

This is the BEST peach pie recipe I've ever used
and my family loves it!  There are only four of us
and we're still lucky if there is any left the day after I bake it.  
The only thing I did differently was to add
a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the crumbled mixture.
DELICIOUS!!!

I followed the recipe to the tee and even added the TBS of cornstarch and also cooked it for 10 minutes longer at 350* and it was soooo running and the middle the crust was doughy the flour was still visible I wish I would have read further the reviews saying to bake at 450* than I wouldn’t have wasted fresh picked peaches WHATEVER YOU DO FOLLOW THE REVIEWS NOT THE ORIGINAL RECIPE

This was a great pie, I used a lot of others suggestions as to use white and brown sugar and cinnamon. I accidentally put pumpkin spice in one of my pies and it was so good!!!!! Best peach pie recipe! Thank you I did use about a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken sauce and it was perfect

TOO RUNNY.. the recipe as stated does not work for fresh peaches and the cooking timeframe.  All the 5 star ratings have specific tweaks they made to combat the liquid situation in this pie but this recipe doesn't account for that.  My kids wouldn't even touch it because it made the bottom pie layer soggy.

Made it exactly like the recipe, except for a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice in the sugar mixture. I was skeptical that it would even turn out...recipe totally different than any I'd ever used, and so easy. Used 4 large SC peaches, heaped pie pan full. Topped with full crust, vented, sprinkled with milk and raw sugar. My husband, a pie liver...said it was the best ever.

My first pie ever. Turned out really delicious. My peaches were early in the season so a little hard, this caused them to release a lot of juices at the end making for a “wet” pie. But the flavor was delicious. I’ll keep learning and experimenting

I looked at some of the reviews and changes that people made. I added cornstarch to the flour and sugar and dotted with butter rather than blending it in. I cooked it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then down to 350 for about 45 minutes but it still seemed a bit underdone. Hubby thought so too. I used less sugar too as my peaches were very ripe. Otherwise it tastes great. What the video doesn't show is that the easiest way to peel peaches is to immerse them in boiling water for 30-45 seconds. The peels come away easily

Deliciously simple pie. It’s all about actually tasting the peaches!
I decreased the sugar to 1/2 C because some of the peaches were lovely and ripe, others not as ripe. If I hadn’t decreased the sugar, adding vanilla ice cream would have made it way to sweet. The taste of the peaches would have been lost to the sugar. 
I used a potato peeler to peel the peaches- which worked very well.
Simple is often better- a very easy pie to make with simple everyday ingredients.  This peach pie has now become a  summer staple. Thank you!

I guess I should have read the suggestions in the reviews first and added cornstarch. It turned out more like peach soup than peach pie.

Love, love, love this pie!  So tasty and you don't need any of the other spices people are recommending (cinnamon, nutmeg...)  The fresh peach flavor really comes through with this simple recipe.  I did use 1/2 brown sugar, but that was the only thing I changed, other than leaving it in the oven after it was done.  I cut into it when it was still warm, so it was still a bit runny, so next time I need to wait longer...patience is a virtue!  :-)  I also think I might need to turn the oven up a little bit, or preheat the cookie sheet I used, because I see the bottom crust could have used a bit more time...a little raw in the center...but then again I used 9 huge peaches, so my pie was nice and thick.   Or maybe I need to roll my Pillsbury crusts out a little thinner.  Regardless, don't change a thing until you've tried this the way it's written.  It's fantastic!  Thank you for the ridiculously simple recipe.  Oh, use the boil and plunge method for the peels.

The flavor is good, but by putting the crumby butter mixture between layers f peaches the top layer has crusty bits of this crumble.  I would say put all of the butter crumbs between layers until the final layer, then dot the top layer with butter only before putting on the lattice.  The lattice is quite pretty!

Very flavorful. I used melted real butter to glaze top and then sprinkled sugar with cinnamon mix on top before baking. My family and everyone at the annual Owen family Christmas dinner loved it. Not overly sweet or bitter, just right.

I have made this pie twice in the last week. I am not a superior pie baker but I had a ton of peaches as it is May in S. GA. I followed the directions added some cinnamon and it came out just like the picture and it was delicious. I think the secret is the flour, butter,  sugar, plus a shake or two of cinnamon( added some brown sugar and stevia to replace the real sugar).  This is my dessert to bring anyway! Thank you so much!

I made this but used plums instead of peaches, and a little less sugar (about 2/3 cup). It was easy and delicious! A great way to make a good fruit pie.

I have never made a peach pie in my life.  Just seemed like it would be too hard.  Used this recipe and was astounded!  I donated my pies to the church to be sold at our fair food stand and people raved.  I made it just as the recipe stated, but I did add cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg to my layers as some reviewers suggested.  Outstanding and will now be my go to peach pie recipe!

The 350 degree temperature wasn't hot enough.  The crust didn't get done  and it was way to juicy which just made the crust turn doughier.

quite good. I didn't think it was too sweet at all and maybe I used a smaller pie plate but 10 peaches would be WAY too many for mine. It is a standard 9" glass pie plate, not a little aluminum one. I always add some tapioca pudding mix to all my fruit pies. It helps it thicken and adds a nice flavor, I think.

Heavenly!  I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, brushed cream on top of lattice and put a very light dusting of sugar & cinnamon.  I've made this recipe with or without the cornstarch (other reviewers had suggested), and you can't tell a difference if you leave it in the oven after cook time, with the oven off (another reviewer's suggestion) it sets perfectly every time.  My husband has favored strawberry-rhubarb pie for decades and after tasting this he told me that this is the BEST pie ever & it's his new favorite!  That's impressive.  Bravo

The best peach pie recipe ever. The pinch of cayenne enhances the flavors and gives the pie a slight kick ! I even used store bought pillsbury pie crust (sorry purists) and it was wonderful. The filling had the perfect texture, not runny, not gluey, but form and juicy.

Simple to make and very yummy.  It did take a lot longer than 45 minutes for the crust to brown but was well worth the wait.

This recipe is a keeper!  I made it yesterday, and it was delicious - and so easy!  The only change I made was using half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The filling was delicious and not runny at all.  I will definitely make this recipe again, and I want to try it using different fruits.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made this peach pie in a 13 x 9 baking pan to take to an event. I doubled the ingredients and I didn't altar. My husband said it was the most excellent peach pie he's ever had,and he never been a fan of peach pie before he took a bite from this pie. Very easy to make too! ;)

I followed the recipe exactly. Fresh peaches not canned, white sugar not brown and white no extra spices! Please if you change the recipe don’t bother to rate it!! The pie turned out perfect! It’s easy and delicious . Thank you for your recipe.

Didn't change a thing.  I would make it again.  I baked it in my oven on convection bake and covered the edges with foil.  I used fresh peaches that had been blanched and peeled and had been sitting in a solution of fruit fresh for a couple days.  After baking the pie set out a room temperature for about 24 hours until we ate it.  Consistency was perfect.

So easy and yet so delicious I have make this recipe many times since finding it on the computer. . I substituted 
corn starch instead of the flour,  It has turned our perfect every time I make it. I agree with another review, homemade pie crust is best.

I don't even like peach pie, but was given a bunch of peaches that were going to spoil if not used, so I  decided to look for a peach pie recipe and am so happy I found yours!  It was so easy to make,  just a few ingredients,  bake and enjoy,  and enjoy we did!  It was super delicious!

I love this recipe, it's so simple! I did half Brown/White sugar, 1TB spoon of cornstarch, and I let cool in oven a couple of hours. I agree with one other reviewer, it's a bit too sweet.  Next time I will add some lemon juice. Otherwise bravo!!

I made it with the modifications suggested in the reviews: 1/2 cup brown sugar, little bit of cinnamon, corn starch.
Maybe I'll skip the cinnamon next time because the cinnamon was a bit strong. It was really delicious, but I want to taste the peach a bit more next time. The cinnamon made it taste a bit like apple pie.
I used really juicy, soft, slightly overripe peaches that were huge(I only needed about three to fill the crust) but the result was still fine. I let it rest for about two hours(but I think it had already settled before that) before eating it. 
In 175C it wasn't done in 45 minutes (my pan is a bit larger than 9 inches btw). I put the temperature up to 200C and baked it for another 15minutes or so. 
My family loved it! This recipe is easy but yields great results! I will definitely make this again.

Honestly this pie was just one big wet mess! It was sweet but the peaches weren't soft (probably my fault for not getting ripe enough peaches) but it had way too much liquid

Used store bought crust, did what other reviewers suggested - 1 heaping tbsp. cornstarch, 1/2 c. White sugar and 1/2 c. Brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Mixed altogether w/peaches and dotted with butter. Baked at 450 for 15 minutes, then turned down to 350 for 30 minutes then turned off oven and left in for couple hours it set beautifully.  A lot of work but tasted great, don't forget to foil edges though. Also did one with blueberries and peaches, don't forget to flour blueberries before adding them.  YUM!!!

I made this using the crust recipe on a box of Crisco.  The pie was delicious and looked incredible with the egg wash and cinnamon  sugar sprinkled on top.  I think it was even more attractive than the photo : ) I had company that I made this for and everyone raved about it. Fresh perfect peaches made for a perfect pie. I did not  leave it in the oven very much longer but it was perfect. Not runny at all.

Simple yet delicious. I used fresh peaches from the farmers market that were nice and ripe and I think it helped with the flavor. Everyone loved it so much I'm making a few more this weekend for the friends party for the holiday and work.

This pie tasted delicious!  The only thing I didn't like was that it was runny.  I even added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it cool in the oven like others suggested and it was too 'gooey' to slice so we spooned it in dishes.  I did add cinnamon and used drained canned peaches.  The taste was great, just need to work on the consistency.

Mine came out runny even after cooled down.  Maybe a little cornstarch or tapioca to keep the filling together.  It was good, but I think would've been 5 star if a touch of cinnamon/nutmeg.  Will make again adding the above.

Made it just as the recipe describes. Great flavor, but a little runny. Will read other comments to see how I might be able to modify it to have it set up a bit better.

I followed the tips of mixing the crumb mixture right into the
peaches. After pie was done, I also turned off the oven and left
it in there to cool. My husband thought it was the best pie I ever
made. It was not runny and it set up fine just like they said it would.
Making it again soon. Thanks for the tips.

This was really a good pie. I didn't have any problems with mine being runny and it was sweet but not overly sweet. We super enjoyed this pie and it is indeed best when eaten fresh.

I added Chinese 5-spice to the mixture, which provided a nice seasoning. As others have said, it was very runny and didn't set up well. Taste-wise, it was great, but the juices soaked the crust and it got soggy. The juices running out (while they tasted good) were a visual turn-off. I'd use the recipe again because it was very easy, but I'll experiment with some of the other readers'suggestions to combat the sogginess next time.

Added a tsp of cinnamon and some berries, and used a heaping tbsp of cornstarch instead of flour. Baked at 425 for 15 min then 325 for 30 min. Perfect!!

The various tips posted by other reviewers were great. I added the cornstarch and 1 tsp. cinnamon as suggested.  I let the pie rest in the oven one hour after turning it off which was effective.  However, for me there was entirely too much sugar in this recipe. I used half brown and half white sugar, but instead of tasting peaches, I tasted sugar and the cinnamon.  So, for that reason, I will not make this recipe again.

Made this for my hubby's birthday today, and it was a hit!  I used premade pie dough but sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the lattice-work and it looked so pretty!  I did add cinnamon to the crumb/butter mixture as well as a bit of pumpkin pie spice.  I used frozen peaches, too.  YUM

Excellent Peach Pie.  The filling was not overly juicy which is a problem I have experienced with other peach pie recipes.  Pretty easy.  I just Pillsbury pre made crust and recipe was awesome.

Overall, I did not like this peach pie. It turned out soupy, floury and grainy & not good. I tried all of the suggestions from other reviewers and it never set. Even with amazing end of summer peaches the flavor was missing something. The top crust was the only thing that worked and it was my own recipe. I will not try this one again. A waste of time & peaches!

The is a nice base recipe.  The first time I made it I followed it to the letter and the pie came out runny.  Husband said that the best thing about it was my homemade crust.  Second time around, I mixed 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/3 c. flour, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp. cloves together then cut in the butter with a pastry blender.  I added this to the sliced peaches and mixed it together, then I arranged the peaches in my pie plate.  I did not add the remaining liquid because I felt the peaches would add their own juice and I just wanted to sweeten and spice them up a bit.  I also applied an egg wash to the top as well as a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar.  The pie turned out fantastic and, bonus, my house smelled great!  I baked at 350 for 55 minutes, then turned the oven off and allowed the pie to cool in the over for 2 hours before removing.

I egg glazed it during initial cooking temp

The bottom was too soft, had to cook for an extra 1/2 hour on higher temp, 425, covered top to protect it  Making sure nothing was between the bottom and the heat except a rack....

This recipe is amazing, and simple. Use it with peaches or nectarines. My trick is to use the firm ones, not overly juicy, and leave the skin on. Separate the fruit and crumbs in to thirds and it works out perfect, ending with crumbs on top before the lattice. I tried it with very juicy peaches, and the juice came out the sides. Put some foil on a baking dish and set your pie plate on that before you put it in the oven. It catches any juice that bubbles out, and makes the hot pie easier to lift. Very tasty. At the end I sprinkled cinnamon sugar, and a quick shake of sea salt for some zing. Recommended as a great pie for beginners.

Made it tonight and am surprised at how well it turned out.  Thanks to all the other reviewers for the tips and encouraging me to make my first pie!
Here's what I did differently and it still turned out fantastic:
- 50% less sugar (only had white sugar. I generally believe that desserts are way too sweet.)
- no lemon used (forgot)
- no flour flower used (outside of the pre made pie crust from Trader Joe's)
- mixed fresh peaches and apples (peeled and cut)
- used vegan butter much less than the recipe called for

Despite cutting down on butter, sugar, and flour, it still came out very rich and not too sweet.  It tastes so good, now I need to get it out of the house I don't eat it all.  Also, I made the crumble from the left over pie crust, just put more cinnamon and sugar and baked it separately in the oven, and added it to the pie after it was done baking.

I followed the advice of some other posters-- mixed half white sugar, half brown, and let it set.  I also added pumpkin pie spice.  It was PERFECT!  Quick and easy pie with rave reviews.

This peach pie was VERY good. Kind of a sloppy mess, but I'll use other reviewers' idea of not adding the butter to the flour mixture next time. I did add cornstarch, and I did turn off the oven and let it sit in there while the oven cooled. Delicious, just messy (which makes me not want to bring it to gatherings, etc.).

Just made this recipe. Family loved it. Used Crisco Double Pie Crust Recipe and used fresh picked peaches. The only recommendation that I would add is to top the pie after baking with a light dusting of cinnamon. Happy baking.

This was great! I used 10 really fresh peaches and it turned out great. I did not need to add cornstarch as some suggested, I just let it sit in the oven after baking. I did add cinnamon and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugars. After peeling and slicing the peaches, it was an easy pie to make!

I made a Peach/Mango pie using this recipe for a Thanksgiving dinner and party and it was a hit! No fresh fruit was available so I did have to use frozen fruit from a bag, which may have added a little more juice then I needed. Even following the comments posted by others to leave the pie in the oven to cool down it was still a little runny… I will drain off some of the liquids next time. I cut the mango chunks in half to make them thinner. This recipe is quick and simple and tasted great (I also made a Peach/Mango Cobbler)

Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of hot fruit except under very specific circumstances. I had bought a bunch of white peaches because my husband claimed he was going to make a pie, but I had to step in to avoid having to toss all those beautiful peaches in the composter. Used the fabulous tip of putting the peaches in boiling water for 1 minute then submersing in ice water. Worked like a charm. Not sure why I've been hesitant to try that technique—heard about it years ago in reference to peeling tomatoes. I'm definitely a believer. Also took other reviewer's advice to use half white/half brown sugar. When I first started layering in my peaches, I thought I'd have a bunch leftover, but they all fit in the shell very nicely. Next time, I might just toss the peaches with the sugar, flour and butter instead of layering just for ease. Used the old aluminum foil over the crust edge trick, but it kind of stuck to the crust and pulled it off in places. Will have to work on that. I didn't add any starch because I had planned to let my pie sit in the oven after the cook time was over as suggested by some, but my husband could not leave well enough alone and took the pie out about 30 minutes after I turned off the oven. Sadly, it was pretty runny. Next time, I'll have to make it when he's not around. Overall, the pie was super easy to make and tasted fabulous.

I made this for a gathering this weekend.  I used frozen peaches (1bag) and added frozen raspberries (1 bag).  The raspberries overpowered the peaches so next time not so many raspberries.  Also, next time I will buy 2 bags of frozen peaches so I won't feel cheated out of one of my favorite fruit flavors.  With the addition of raspberries, I will add a bit more thickening agent - maybe a tablespoon of cornstarch in with the flour, sugar, butter mixture.

I used Trader Joe's pie crust and made miniature pies.  I used a jar of TJ's peaches in white grape juice, which were sweet and perfectly ripe.  I should have cut the recipe in half for the filling.  I had more than enough.  But overall it was perfect and easy.  I'm saving this and will make again.

There is no reason to leave pie in oven or "boil it off".  Simply add 2 1/2 T. of Instant Tapioca plus 1 T. Flour to peach mixture and stir.  Pie will be bubbly and juicy when removed from oven.  After pie cools it will firm up and be a perfect.

I made this pie twice in one week and had success with it both times.  As others have mentioned, I also left the pie in the oven when the time was up, leaving it to cool completely.  Each time, the pie set quite nicely.  The only addition that I made was to add a sprinkle or two of cinnamon to the butter/sugar/flour mixture.  Aside from that, it was made as indicated!   The time seemed to be correct for me as well!  Nice recipe.  Thanks!

My first time baking this and I did exactly as recipe stated -  I also left in the oven as it cooled as some others suggested. 
BUT, although the flavor was really good and it looked beautiful, it was still too "soupy" for my liking.

Next time I will add 2 Tbsp. of corn starch to help combat the problem and still leave in the cooling oven.  I will use this recipe again as it was simple and tasty.

I don't even like Peach pie (barely like Peaches) but since my mom has a peach tree I thought I'd have a go at it. I was stunned at how delish it is!!! I would say it needs some cinnamon though, didn't realize this until after I cooked it.

Awesome pie. The previous reviews helped. Made my crust (Pie crust I  recipe with butter instead of shortening) and slightly modified this recipe by using half brown/half white sugar and by dumping all the ingredients together in one bowl and adding cinnamon. I also let it sit in the oven after baking or it would have been soupy. Rave reviews and was so good that we all ate it for dinner too.

So easy!  I did take the recommendation to sub in 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 sugar instead of a full cup of white sugar.  I turned off the oven when cooked and let 'set'.  I did not do the lattice work as I only had 1/2 package of Pillsbury pie and put vanilla ice cream on top.  I got a 5 out of 5 thumbs up from picky eaters.  Will be a staple recipe in my arsenal.  My prep time was only about 15 mins.

This was the first peach pie I ever made and it was the best peach pie I have ever had.  It was also very simple to make, the hardest part was pitting and slicing the peaches.  I think it is the simplicty of the filling that makes it so wonderful.  I received rave reviews when I brought this to a family dinner.  I can't wait to make it again.

Wow, this was delicious and easy!  Will be my peach-pie go-to forever!  The only changes I made was to add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and to mix the peaches and the suger/flour mixture together instead of layering.  I used frozen peaches (it turned out GREAT) and used a whole top crust instead of lattice.  Fabulous!

My peaches were not the juciest so my pie was rather dry. If I decide to make this out of season agian I will probably use canned. Overall good. (took 9 peaches for my 9 inch pie).

I think it's all a matter of peach quality--mine weren't fantastic. I added the cornstarch to avoid runnyness and added cinnamon. A good base recipe to showcase good fruit, which, I didn't have.

Also first time pie baker.  I didn't crumble the butter enough in the crust so it melted over the pan, but hey, that made it even more delicious.  I didn't have all the peaches to use, but can see that it could've used them all because they cook down and flatten a bit.  The flavor was delicious and I'll use this one again!

First time pie baker...very simple to make and absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make it again and again.  It was a little runny but I should have added a little corn starch or left it in the oven to set when I had turned oven off.

I added a bit of cinnamon to the crumble layer mix, but I don't think that's responsible for the less than exciting results.  The pie was extremely wet (beyond juicy), really quite messy to eat.  Good flavor, but I attribute that more to the quality of the peaches than this recipe.

Another 5 Star dessert!  I used a 24 oz. bag of frozen peaches (as it's Jan. in western Pennsylvania and much fresh produce looks pretty sad!)and it turned out terrific.  I added nothing of my own; followed this recipe to a "T" and it was delightful. I have to say it reminded me of true southern peach pie...just a touch tart but with a rich peachy flavor.  I also used the whole pie crust on the top, adding a brushing of egg white for a nice browness.  Great recipe I am sure we'll use again!

I haven't actually made the pie yet (I will be doing that for Christmas), but I have to say this is the first recipe I have found yet that looks like what I was going for!  I wanted to put a piece fo advice because I saw that someone wanted to know how to keep the edges of the pie from burning.  The trick is, put strips of tin foil around the edges of the pie for about the last fifteen minutes of baking.  The rest of the pie continues to bake through to a golden brown while the edges are protected from turning a nasty shade of burnt!

Love this pie!  Followed some of the suggested variations (cornstarch, cinnamon, tossed peaches with crumb mixture), and I haven't had any real problems.  It is a little runny right out of the oven, regardless of the cornstarch, but it tastes so good that no one ever notices.  Once it's cooled down it sets up nicely, but it's best warm.

Easy to make, however, next time I will cut the sugar/butter/flour mixture in half- I prefere more peaches!

As a first timer this recipe was great. I used 5 big fresh peaches, and 1/2 bag of frozen. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry mix, and used a crust mix from a cook book. I started off with the oven at 400 degrees, and about 3 minutes in I turned it to 350. I didn't have any crust for the top, so I didn't want the peaches to get overly dry. It was in the oven (on) for about 30 min when I opened the oven and it seemed really runny. I took it out and drained some of the juices in the kitchen sink. I put it in for another 15 or so, and left it in until dinner was going in. It turned out just fine. I served it with vanilla low-fat yogurt, and it was delish! My hunny likes more crust, so next time I'd spend more time making a top! :)

I made this tonight and just finished my first warm piece.  It was delicious!  I had really big peaches so I measured 4 cups and that was just the right amount.  I followed the recipe just as it is written (with the exception of the amount of peaches) and it made a perfecty sweet, gooey, not watery pie.

We enjoyed this simple pie.  I made mine with peaches and blueberries and it turned out great.  The first time I made it I took the advice of others and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  Second time I used all white sugar and preferred it that way.  I didn't layer it - just put the peaches in the bottom and dumped the sugar/flour mixture on top and then did not lattice the top crust.  Because of the flour, you really don't need to add cornstarch.  The filling should be thick enough.  I think next time I make it with just peaches I will add 1 tsp of cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  Otherwise, you really don't need to modify this at all!

Wonderful!  It was quite juicy and I was glad that I put a drip tray underneath.   Next time I will follow others advice and try adding some cornstarch (maybe 2 teaspoons) to the flour. 
    I cooked my pie crust about 5 minutes before adding the peaches to firm it up a bit. 
    This is a tasty way to use up extra peaches.  For my 8 inch pan, I used about 8.

Nothing better than fresh peaches!  I made a mistake (oops) and used 1/2 cup of butter, but had luckily added 2T of cornstarch because of past reviews of it being runny....turned out decadent.  I also topped with a crust and put a sugar glaze.  Yummy!  Next time, I would be sure of my butter measurement and hope that the cornstarch would keep it from being runny, because I did run into that problem as well, but attribute that to my mis-calculation.

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I did find it a bit too sweet and tried half the sugar the second time around.  It just didn't taste as good.  I think next time I'll just top it off with vanilla ice cream to balance it out.

This was my first time making a pie and it was so good! I didn't make my own crust, for fear that'd mess up but it still tasted great. I left it in the cooling oven like other readers have suggested. Not runny at all! My bottom crust was soggy though, don't know how to combat that...

Well it was my first pie ever and I didn't know if I should bake the crust first.  So I did two.  The one I baked the crust first turned out really good.  I let it sit and cool, then added all ingredients. The one that I baked the crust with the peach mixture was really running and messy.  I added a little more sugar for my husbands sweet tooth and he loved it!  I will definitely use again.

I was expecting a lot more from such a highly-rated recipe. I follow popular suggestions--half brown, half white sugar and a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. These changes make for a delicious filling. I added a heaping tablespoon cornstarch for thickening and took the advice of reviewer EKM1220, and left it to cool in the oven. The pie was STILL a sopping mess...I couldn't even transfer it from pie pan to plate without it completely disintegrating. I ended up spooning out the extra juice after eating the first piece, and now it's sitting in the fridge, HOPEFULLY firming up. Great taste for the filling, but something needs to be done about the runniness...

This was my first pie. I made it as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom. I used 2 bags of frozen peaches since this is not a good time for fresh ones. I also used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg although my Mother said this was not necessary.

I loved this recipe the first time I made it exactly to the recipe. The second time around I used nectarines instead. I also added 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1tbsp nutmeg 1tbsp cinnamon or two to the sauce mixture. I also noticed if you let the sauce mixture simmer for a little it thickens which combats the runniness. I also made my own pie crust following one of the recipes on here which made the pie even better. Awesome Incredible Wonderful Pie Recipe a definite keeper.

This pie was really easy to make. Thanks to reading the reviews I didn't run into any runny problems and I added the cinnamon & nutmeg -without that I don't think it would have had much flavor. I also put the peaches under the broiler for about 10 minutes to help with some of the moisture. Seems to have worked really well. Cornstarch is a must with this pie. I also put cinnamon and sugar on the top. I would definitely make this pie again.

I made this pie because my step-father loves peach pie. He absolutely loved it. He did say that there was something missing from it and I should try making it again and keep on trying until I find that little something he thinks is missing. Which would be another pie for him to eat!!

This pie needs something else...but I'm unsure as to what. The sugar/flour/butter crumble mix is strange - the pie would be better without it. I will try this again with a few tweaks.

Despite the pie being runny ( i have never read reviews to let it sit in the oven) I have to give it 5 stars for taste. It is sweet and tart and just excellent alone or with ice cream. I will try the oven trick. WOnder if a little cornstartch would help it out?

"NOW THAT'S A PIE" is all I needed to hear!!  I too added cinnamon, did half brown and half white sugar and baked the pie at 425 for the first 10 mins and then down to 350 for the remainder.  It really was a family pleaser!

This pie was so good.  I found no problems with it being runny.  I was way better than any store bought pie.  My husband loved it so much he asked if I would make one for his dad on Father's Day.  Excellent!!

I think this recipe is GREAT.  It is simple, easy to mix with ingredients that you already have at home without having to go out and pick up extra items. It is a "Good Ole Fashion Recipe."

Excellent--My husband was asking for Old Fashion Cobbler like his mother made and the juiciness of this recipe made it turn out top of the line.  Thanks Marcia.   Fire Mom, Elsberry, Mo.

I just want to make the pie thick, how do I do that?  Other than that, it is great.

Tried this today for the first time, came out runny and a mess.  Followed the recipe 
exactly and rechecked to be sure!  Don't know what happened.  Husband thought
it was too sweet, kids didn't really care for it.

A very good recipe, but I am told that it is not as good as my apple pie.  I will have to Give you that recipe.
