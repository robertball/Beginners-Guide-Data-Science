I'm actually only reviewing this recipe for the candied walnut portion. The salad looks amazing though and I'm sure to try it in the future. But, I was specifically looking for a recipe for candied walnuts and this one was great. The only thing I changed was sprinkling some salt on them as they cooled. I like "salted caramel".

This recipe is slamming!  It's a great bbq coleslaw that can stay out of the refrigerator since there's no mayonnaise.  The Jicama was hard to find but worth the search!

Excellent and refreshing!  As I started peeling  the jicama, I noticed it was a little hard todo.  I used a sharp knife and cut back some of the outer layer.  This makes julienne slicing easier and it's not so fibrous.

Yummy, crunchy, sweet, salty, taste of summer! I have also made this receipt in winter and substituted apples for the jicama, it's hard to find that time of the year. Delicious either way! And healthy
