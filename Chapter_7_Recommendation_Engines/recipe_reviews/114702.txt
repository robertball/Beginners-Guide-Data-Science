OMG AMAZING!  Awsome presentation, youll feel like a 5-star chef.

I recommend using wheat bread as it looks way better than white bread does after being baked.  

Also go for jumbo asparagus (as thick as possible) for this makes it much better than skinny little spears.  

Thing to make sure NOT to do: overcook the asparagus.  It ruins the dish.  Remeber the asparagus will continue to cook in the oven after youve already pan fried/steamed it

have made this recipe several times and always a huge hit.  have use canned asparagus to cut corners and don't think it makes a difference.  Have made it before with zest from a lemon (saw it in a separate recipe) in lieu of chives.  Either way, delicious app and always well received.

I used a large tortilla wrap for this recipe. I cut off the round edges and divided the remaining square into 4. each 1/4 was used to roll the spread and asparagus. This party appetizer was a huge hit. All the guests were taking the recipe home with them:-)

These were a hit at our New Year's Eve celebration!  They were fast and easy.  I did prepare them earlier in the day...then just before baking brushed them with butter and topped with cheese.  If you are looking for something different and new, this recipe is perfect!

This was so much better than I thought it would be. I was making about 3 different appetizers at the same time & I got a little turned around. I mixed some italian seasonings with the cream cheese. But they were really good. I was afraid rolling them in white bread would look a little "cheesy" but you can't tell it's white bread so it makes a great presentation. I'll be making these for a baby shower in a couple weeks and I think I'll double it to 2-3 asparagus spears (fresh, then roasted with olive oil, s & p) to get a better asparagus taste. These were pretty darn good served at room temperature.

I'm sorry, but neither me nor my guests really liked the bread crust on these.  My first thought when preparing to make these was to replace the bread with a Pillsbury outside, and I should have. I won't make these again.

These are fabulous!  I was a little hesitant when I read the recipe included plain white bread (although reading the prior reviews helped).  However, these are great and super easy.  Our grocery store was out of fresh asparagus, so I had to use frozen as plan B and they were fine.  These will def become an app staple at our house.  Followed the recipe to a "T", except the frozen asparagus and I didn't measure the cream cheese mixture, just spread a thin layer on each slice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Even though the recipe is quite simple, it is bit time consuming with rolling the bread and whatnot... but SO good!!!! I made these to a T and it was fantastic! (Oh I didnt blanch them because I hate soggy asparagus, so I just wrapped them in a damp paper towel and cooked them in the microwave for about 20 seconds knowing they were going to cook in the oven... and it was perfect!!  Not mushy like some reviewers say!  )

Everyone wanted this recipe after last night!  They were absolutely delicous and easy to make.  I love the idea of leaving an extra bag of them frozen in the freezer for unexpected company or a quick snack on movie night.

OH MY!  These are great!  I tested them before a cocktail party and my husband and I ate them all in one sitting.  At the party, it was the most requested recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and WOW!  I did snap off the woody ends of the asparagus and then used a vegetable peeler just to make sure they were tender enough and not in any way chewy.  And I used plain, ole Wonder bread.  They were fantastic.  I made these several hours in advance and kept in the fridge but did not put the melted butter or cheese on top until right before I baked and they were fine.  If I could give them more stars I would!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved these. I used cheapest bread( I do not recommend it) so it crumbled on me when i tried to roll the asparagus.   I would suggest using a wider loaf of bread instead of your standard Wonder bread size. It would help hold more of the asparagus.  I actually doubled the asparagus and bread but used the same amount of filling called for in the recipe.  I though this made lots of filling.  I  aslo recommend warming your cream cheese filling to make it more spreadable. These tasted awsome but nex time ill use 2  or 3 asparagus in each roll. I just love asparagus.

I gave this a 4 because I'm unsure whether or not I actually like asparagus at all, I was testing a couple different recipes... this one was the best one of all though...  a little rich, but good.  I don't know if I'll make it again though.

ADD CRUMBLED BLUE CHEESE!!!!   My mom always made a recipe like this and the blue cheese made it!  Sometimes in the store you can find Blue Cheese spread--use this instead of cream cheese.  This recipe is one of my favorites--try the blue cheese it's sure to "wow" everyone!

Next time I make these, I'll use the thinnest asparagus spears I can find to make eating them easier. Also, I used sourdough and buttermilk breads. The sourdough rolled out better but didn't bake as well. Other reviewers were right that the bacon really makes this appetizer come together, so I doubled the bacon. Excellent advice!

We made these for Christmas.  They were good, and they dissapeared quickly.  But there were a few shortcomings.

- They are very filling at the current size to have as an appetizer before dinner.  We would recommend cutting them into even smaller pieces, or just serving them on an occasion where appetizers are the main event.

- The overwhelming flavor is the cream cheese.  Of course it tastes good, but the flavors aren't anything original, so don't choose this recipe if you are really looking to impress.

These were great and they all disappeared at last night's party. 
I cheated and used Pillsbury Hot dog wraps. I also used onion and chive cream cheese like another reviewer suggested. I used bacon bits just to keep it simple (and a tad healthier).

I left out the bacon and rolled in some prosciutto instead.  Also steamed the asparagus in my steamer.  Additionally, the asparagus I used was not super-thick so I was able to roll in two spears per roll-up (tips facing opposite directions) so when cut, each piece of roll-up ended up with a protruding asparagus tip.  Boom.

These were alright. I made as is with the exception of wheat bread. I wasn't super impressed & I love asparagus. I might make them again, but not positive.

So easy and it was a great way to use up my big bunch of asparagus that only I seem to eat.  I like to use 2 of the narrow asparagus as they are more tender.  I stick one top out of each end so everyone gets a top when you cut them in half.

A great appetizer, easy and quick to make.  I boiled the asparagus only 5-6 minutes --otherwise it's too soft. The best bread to use is the worst nutritionally for you!! --you know, the white sandwich bread that keeps soft forever?  It easily rolls out very thin which is what you want.  I tried Italian fresh bread and it didn't work as well. Make sure you sprinkle the cheese on top before baking.  That gives it a good flavor.

I brought this to a potluck today and set it out on the appetizer table.  I thought it would be a good dish even if at room temperature.  Well my tray was empty in 30 minutes!

I did make the spread filling the day before so the assembly right before the event was easy.  Just remember to take the filling out to warm to room temp early.

Made exactly as per recipe and, while the taste was very good, found that there wasn't enough cream cheese filling for a tablespoon per slice. Will definitely make again, but up the quantity of spread. Thanks for the recipe.

These were so good and well received by everyone at our New Year's lunch today.  I used freeze-dried chives (all I had at home) and added hot sauce, lemon juice, and more bacon to the cream cheese mixture and they were delicious!!

This was fast and EASY.  I combined the bacon, chives, and cream cheese in the food processor and used 2-3 thin spears of asparagus in each roll.

Love these and I always get compliments.  They freeze nicely too, just assemble, put on wax paper in freezer for a couple hours and then place in storage bag or container.  Can then take them out of the Freezer and bake whenever needed - no need to defrost.  My kids LOVE these too - great way to eat veggies.  To make these vegetarian, I have left out the bacon and they still taste great!  These appetizers will not disappoint!

these were pretty good. the bacon was a little overpowering, so i think i'll leave that out next time. the one other thing i'd do differently is to add more than one spear per roll. the were too "dainty". and don't overcook the asparagus, or they will be very limp coming out of the over. blanch for just a min or two. and chill in cold water before baking.

These were a hit at a party I recently threw!  Even my fiance, who NEVER eats asparagus LOVED these delicious little bites. We'll probably even have them at our wedding! Definitely a must try....I just suggest adding a dusting of salt and pepper before coating with cheese.

These are so good.  I had an aunt who used to make these with chez whiz, but they are so much better with the cream cheese mixture.  I didn't have any bacon but I did add a dash of wostershire sauce for a bit more zip.

A real crowd pleaser!  I made two versions, one with wheat bread and bacon and a white bread vegetarian with goat cheese, roasted garlic and chive.  I like the wheat bread better than white.  Next time I think I will try a bleu cheese and pear combination

I was shocked these came out so poorly after the fab reviews.  Maybe my asparagus was too thin.  The bread and cream cheese flavor overwhelmed the asparagus.  The tips dried out in the oven.  Too bad, it sounded great.

I substituted burrito-size tortillas for the bread, left out the bacon and placed thinly sliced deli ham over the cream cheese mixture before rolling up. Also subbed a diet spread for the butter and used a light sprinkling of garlic powder with the parmesan. Very tasty — plan to make this a traditional spring treat.

I used cream cheese mixed with garlic powder and parsley because that's what I had. Also rolled them sideways and made the delicious mistake of dipping them in the butter! Wonderful!

These were fantastic! Even my picky brother loved them! Next time tho I will try more than 1 spear in each for a more prominent asparagus flavor.

These were a big hit at the Christmas party. There were a number of vegetarians on the guest list, so I left out the bacon but added sea salt and an herb mix to the cream cheese & scallions. I didn't miss the bacon flavor like I was sure I would. 

Very easy to make, and they were quickly devoured.

I wouldn't have pegged these as a big hit but after reading the reviews, I decided to give them a shot.  Took them to a New Years Party - everyone LOVED them.

A TOTAL HIT...even with the older family members from Italy who don't like ANYTHING.  They never complimented me, but they went back for second and third roll ups!

This sounded SOOOOO good, but it just wasnt "all that." It was a bit tedious to put them together, and the cream cheese and bacon took over the asparagas. I think they are just too heavy for such a delicate vegi. I really wanted to like it...

I wasn't really sure how to rate this. I thought these were good, however, when I brought them to a party....what a flop!!  I took almost ALL of them back home with me.  Alot of work for nothing.  I may make them again, just for my husband and I.

still think the best way to serve thin asparagus spears is to wrap them in some lunch meat smeared w/ a little cream cheese.  if the spears are much thicker than a pencil, might want to lightly steam them, but otherwise- fresh is best!

My bread was too grainy/hearty for rolling up, so I cut them into pieces and did this 'cracker' style.  Very yummy.  Next time, I'll do more variety and put pepper slices or zucchini slices on top as well.

These are awesome!  I do not use the bacon, and they still taste fantastic with just the cream cheese & chives.  I also put 2 or 3 small spears in each 'bread roll' if the asparagus is very small.  They're always a big hit - so many people have asked me for this recipe!

These were awesome. I Kept everything the same but I only used 12 pieces of bread and asparagus spears. I cut each asparagus spear in half before rolling up, but I did not cut each roll-up in half.

What an unusual combination of ingredients!! However, I made these exactly like the recipe and for once, I would not change a thing, unless you want to sneak some shredded cheese into the cream chesse. Extra yummy.

My parents loved them as I made them and said it was a 5* recipe, but I think next time I will cut down on the cream cheese a bit, and add some more asparagus. The cream cheese was just a little overpowering. The only changes I made was I used green onion and garlic salt in place of the chives since I didn't have any on hand. Great flavor though, and I will definitely make again. My dad does not like asparagus but he said these were great. Thanks!!

I found by the time everything was finished baking these were fairly blah in terms of flavor.  The asparagus was overcooked in my opinion and the cream cheese mixture really over powered it.

I only had dried chives and canned asparagus-  they still turned out wonderful!  I also used 6 pieces of bacon instead of 8. I put a little less than 1 tablespoon of spread on each bread slice, as there was not enough to put in a whole tablespoon. I will make these often!

I made this for an appetizer on Christmas day.  Even some who were not crazy about asparagus liked it!  I can't wait to make it again!
