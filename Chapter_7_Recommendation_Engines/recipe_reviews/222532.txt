Very good recipe.  I added a little Tony Cacheres seasoning to the mix to give them some spice and they were excellent!

great recipe.  The recipe is more family size than party size, which makes good for the weekday dinner. The hushpuppies are moist and very tasty. Definetly give this recipe a try.

I just got done making these...we hoped they would turn out better. The batter was VERY runny and that made it hard to get the shape right so I suggest adding more flour. Also, they were really bland so we will add sugar to the batter next time if we make them again. Adding butter and sugar on top really helped and made them savory and sweet. Good luck making these! They turned out pretty good with a few adjustments. (we left out the celery)

Very good recipe, turned out great. I like sweet hush puppies so I added a little sugar. To the reviewer that thought the batter was too runny, add small equal parts of flour and corn meal until you get the right thickness.

I found this recipe when my husband and I were having a shrimp for dinner. It was absolutely delicious ?? . I will most certainly be using the hush puppy recipe many times ! Thanks for such a delightful side dish when we have seafood ??

I made this today- first time ever for making hush puppies! I have never been a fan of hush puppies- but hubby is. They were the best ones I have ever tried! With reading other reviews- I did omit celery and garlic- but did add garlic salt and a little white sugar- that were awesome!! Thanks for sharing!!

Loved the consistency and flavor, but were a little bland.  I added a fresh jalapeño from the garden. Chopped it in the chopper with the onion.  Next time will add more jalapeño, Cajun seasoning and salt.  It is a keeper.

I made as directed  but took other's advice and added more spice and also added sugar. I tasted the batter until it tasted right and then cooked it. OH!! I almost forgot! I added about 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I fried them
In peanut oil at about 375 and they puffed up beautifully and were DELISH!!

This southerner approves! I use seasoning salt and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I also add 2Tbs of melted butter to the wet ingredients  (plus a little extra corn meal). Rest of recipe is spot-on! Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly - turned out fine, but tasted like fried stuffing.  Not quite what I was looking for - plan to try a different recipe again.
Was quick, though, just like I was looking for!

I read several of the reviews where they said they were runny, or too wet. So were mine. I couldn't get them to clump up in balls. That's not to say these weren't bad. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little sugar. Very good. I will also try these again to see if I can master the batter by getting them to clump up better

The batter was quite gooey, which meant that the hush puppies came out in some fanciful, Dr. Seuss-like shapes. That said, they tasted GREAT! Next time I'll add a little bit of flour to stiffen up the dough, make it easier to mold into balls, and hopefully make them more uniform in shape. I'll make this again.

It needed more flavor. I expected to be able to mix them into balls but they just kinda flattened out when frying. Will not try this one again.
