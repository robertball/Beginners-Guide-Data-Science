We raise our own pheasants, so I look often, usually in vain, for good recipes.  This was quite the winner.  The sauce, as well as the slow cooking, took away any toughness or gamy taste.  I only had button mushrooms, but the result was still wonderful.  Wow! Here is our own "pheasant under glass," if you count the lid of the slow cooker. I think this would work well with nearly any game bird.

Cooked this twice, once adding spicey sausages. The chilli's in the sausage added a nice flavour and in my opinion, both recipes were wonderfull. Tip: do not exceed the stated cooking time or you'll start to lose flavour in the bird.

We have had trouble with our pheasant being tough and this recipe solved that problem.  The pheasant was fall off the bone tender and the flavors were delicious.  It was neither too sweet or bland, and there was plenty of sauce to go over rice. I might next time add a bit of red pepper because we like a little bite to our casseroles.

My husband goes Pheasant hunting every winter and I was looking for something different to do with the birds.
Found this recipe and it is wonderful!  Everyone who has tried it couldn't get enough.

Absolutely delicious; easy to put together (after the pheasants are cleaned and cut up).  The sauce produced the most tantalizing smells throughout the house and it tasted just as good.  The pheasant was very tender, moist and flavorful.

This dish is excellent!  I prepared it on Valentine's Day with pheasant we had in the freezer from my husband's hunting trip.  I did it almost exactly as written, with perhaps a few more mushrooms and olives than specified.  It's a keeper!  I've been looking for a good recipe for pheasant for years and this is it!  A Keeper!  Thank you.

Did EXACTLY like the recipe. My hubby had gone pheasant hunting and was so excited for me to try the recipe.  We missed something, I guess...

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and my husband, the hunter, and I both loved it.  I was a little hesitant about the olives but I too hate it when people alter a recipe before even trying it so I left them in. I was glad I did because you don't taste them specifically they just add to the yummy flavor.

I did need to add a little more olive oil for browing because the coated meat absorbed it pretty quickly. 

The next time I make this recipe I will save the leftover broth from the can and add more as needed (the mixture was pretty thick when done) about 15 minutes before serving.  I served it with noodles but would use rice next time.

I have a few tips for those who commented about the tiny bones because I have experienced that in the past.  These tips alleviated the problem.
#1  Do not overcook.  I cooked these for 4 hours on high and they were moist and perfectly cooked.  
#2 and most important.  Debone the breasts before cooking.  You don't really lose much meat (I breaded every small piece)and by taking out the ribs you eliminate the small bones.  If you don't overcook them the legs stay pretty much intact. This also helps you catch any BBs that might have been missed during cleaning.

Thanks for a great pheasant recipe MBETHCOOKS. I've been looking for one for a long time and this is the one I will use from now on.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! Added a little smoked paprika to the flour mixture... used shiitake mushrooms instead of crimini and added a 28oz can of diced tomatoes (drained) alongside the sliced olives. Incredible flavors and a great stew-like consistency. And the pheasant was unbelievably tender. Highly recommend this recipe for cooking pheasant. Can't wait to make this again. Thank you!!!

Made this recipe for the second time and it is just as good as the first!  I love how all the ingredients take away the gamey taste of the bird.  I will keep this recipe forever and make it over and over again.

I put this in the slow cooker for my husband while I spent the day with a girlfriend shopping so I did not taste it myself however my husband who is a bird hunter and who has eaten game his entire life said this was very good, moist and didn't taste gamey.  After years of cooking "dried out" pheasant I have finally found a recipe that is GOOD!!!!!!! (I substituted wild mushrooms that I had on hand )

Another hit in my family.  It appeals to all ages.  The kids had friends over the night I made it.  Everyone loved it.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  It turned out great!

Excellent, tender pheasant from this recipe! My parents used to make homemade baby food for me from pheasants they killed, and this is the first time I've had it in 30 years because it's an intimidating bird (tough, gamy, that kind of thing). No fear here, it was fall-apart delicious and flavorful.   I modified in the following ways: I only had one pheasant so I essentially halved it. I brown-braised pearl onions with scallion, and sauteed the mushrooms, both a la MTAOFC in addition to the onion called for in the recipe. I julienned half of the onion called for instead of cutting it into rings.. Instead of chicken broth, I used beef as I had no chicken broth on hand. I used soy flour instead of all-purpose. I omitted the olives as I didn't have any. I used an additional half-cup of white wine; white pepper instead of black; and 6 cloves of garlic thru my garlic press instead of chopping. Also added a minced small shallot when I sauteed the onion. I loved it, my BF loved it (we will serve it over rice pasta next time per his suggestion), and my uncle loved it.   To reiterate what an earlier poster said, do be careful of the bones.

Very good and easy.  I had never cooked pheasant before and this was a hit.  Would cook it this way again.

This is an awesome recipe!  The pheasant was cooked perfectly.  I served noodles as a side dish so there was a non-pheasant option for the kids.

as the others have said "Wonderful - succulent, and delicious"
I used a 2011 South African Pinot Grigio, only one bird, and chestnut mushrooms. Cooked on High, I ended up using at least as much liquid as the recipe called for for 2 birds. The result was sweet from the wine, moist and yummy, not too salty. Definitely a 'make again' dish.

This recipe was supurb - never did I think pheasant could turn out so darn good!
My husband grew up in a family that always cooked game and he said that this recipe was the best pheasant he has ever had (and his mom is the most amazing cook I have met!) 
Will use this recipe again and again every year around pheasant season.

This recipe is definitely a winner and you can't go wrong with it.  Sometimes I add a little hot pepper sauce just to spice it up a bit.  This is definitely a winner.

I was so impressed with this recipe.  First time cooking Pheasant. Could not find crimini mushrooms instead I found a package of assorted gourmet mushrooms to substitute. Other then this I followed the recipe as written.  After cooking in the slow cooker at the required time the meat fell off the bones.  This bird has many tiny bones so be careful when pulling the meat off the Pheasant.  Can't wait to cook this again.  Roasted potatoes with the sauce and a salad make a nice meal. Have some French bread for dipping any extra sauce.

Never felt strongly enough to rate a recipe before (sorry, I'm a lurker by nature), but I had to speak up for this recipe.  I used 6 legs instead of whole birds, and this was the best pheasant dish I've ever had.

This was wonderful. I had a single pheasant but used the full recipe for the sauce, using baby portabellas and a Riesling (no olives). I cooked it on high for 4 hours and feel I lost too much sauce in that high heat so I will make more next time. I felt the breast got a bit overdone but the dark meat was perfect.   I will make this again. I make stock from the bones and will have that wonderful pheasant stock for the next bird or whim.   Thanks for a great recipe.

Brilliant! This was one of those dishes that had my dining partner enthusing over every mouthful - and demanding a repeat performance. I had to make do with vile tinned olives (rinsed to get rid of the vinegar) and red wine, but it still came out beautifully - and I'll try making it properly & take a pic next time, because there will most definitely be a next time, and a time after that, and a time after that... Thank you!

I tried this recipe with the pheasant and it was great, then I tried it with chicken then again with pork.  Wow it was wonderful with both I think I like it best with the pork loin.  I have served it at a dinner party and got rave reviews, it is a keeper.

This was the best pheasant recipe I have ever had!  Had great flavor and meat was so moist.  Will always use this over mushroom soup!

Two bunches of visiting pheasant hunters raved about this recipe. The first time (she said almost embarrassed-ly) was with pheasants at least 3 years old (vacuum-packed). They were on way past recommended cooking time because DH shot a huge deer and we had to go get it (living in Montana is a strain...not!). The second was with brand new birds. Both times all parts of the pheasant were falling-off-the-bone tender and tasty, no waste at all. Since the cook (me) doesn't like olives, they were left out. The recipe went home with hunters to California, Washington, and New Jersey. Thank you so very, very much for this recipe!!

This was a delicious and simple recipe. I omitted the olives because my husband doesn't like them. Otherwise, it was great!

Very tender, but extremely filling we thought. What should've been a meal & a little leftover turned out to be enough for 2 full meals. We didn't put the black olives in because neither of us like those except for maybe on pizza. I did put a dash of liquid smoke per reviews, but that didn't help for something that seemed missing. I think next time I might try the red pepper flakes. Putting more salt in while cooking did help since the broth I had was unsalted. Hubby wants to try this with chicken sometime too.

Followed the recipe exactly except I had to use marsala wine as I had no white wine.  We loved it!!! Thought the olives was strange but added them. Will make again. Pheasant season is just around the corner for us so cant wait to make this again real soon.

This is a very good recipe, but I didn't include the black olives and added bacon! I also added a little cayenne pepper.

I served with spaghetti and fresh shaved parmesan and it was delicious!

Thank you for the great advice on slow-cooking pheasant!

Easy to make and good flavor.  Adjusted the liquid ratio just a bit as it was a little dry for me.

This is more like it. I just didn't add the Olives. It's a fair to middle recipe. It is tender etc. I really love Pheasant, I can eat a whole one. I never like hung meat, not that it suggests this. I don't like it green. We always prepare it the same day it's shot. Oh dear, some hate that idea but it's not all in a plastic wrapper.

Great recipe and very easy to prepare. It didn't look very appetizing in the crockpot so I added a drained can of Rotel tomatoes and 1/2c of frozen green peas halfway through the cooking time. Served the dish with yellow rice and brussel sprouts. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  Even my picky 12 year old daughter loved it.  I added red pepper flakes...will add more next time.  Served it with rice.  Yummy!
I used pheasant breast and the meat was tender, better than chicken any day.

Btw...it was my first time ever to cook pheasant.  Enjoy!

This recipe kept the pheasant moist and was quite tender. I followed the recipe as given. It needed perhaps a little more salt, pepper plus some smoked paprika and red pepper flakes as suggested by others. Will make this a keeper for sure.
