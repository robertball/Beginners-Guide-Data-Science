I grated some lemon zest and added it in with the cake mixture and also the egg with condensed milk mixture.  On top of the filling, I put some fresh raspberries, then the crumble topping and baked it.  All these additions made the bar very flavorful.  Great to take to work and share. Would make these again.

I had to use a Butter Pecan cake mix, because that is all that I had on hand, but it turned out perfectly.  the lemon flavor was good, and would likely be more intense with a blander cake mix like the yellow mix called for.  Otherwise I did everything according to the recipe and loved it.  I think I would intensify the lemon flavor a bit by adding some lemon extract or maybe a teaspoon or so of lemon zest
The second time I made it with a white cake mix and added extra lemon zest and extract.  Made it an even better dessert. All the grandkids loved it, even the youngest ones.
