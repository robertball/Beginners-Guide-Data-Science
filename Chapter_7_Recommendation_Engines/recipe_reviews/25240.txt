This recipe is heavy on the brie and crumb topping.  I used only a quarter wheel of brie and it would have been plenty for 2 bunches of asparagus.  Cook it a little longer to melt the brie completely and get a nice crust on the topping.  I would definately use 2 bunches of asparagus next time, or halve the amount of topping, quarter the amount of brie if you are using the recipe verbatim.  If you love brie, this is a fantastic way of enjoying it with asparagus!

This dish was wonderful! It won over my veggie-hater husband too. I substituted slivered almonds for the sesame seeds, which also turned out really well. I know what I am bringing to the family Thanksgiving this year. Thanks for the great recipe Vicki!

Definitely a good side dish, although the recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH cheese and bread topping. I followed the advice of reviewers and cut the cheese and topping in half, but next time I make the dish, I'll only use a quarter of what's called for in the recipe.

I thought it was a delicious and decadent combination with that "special occasion look," but my husband would have preferred melted cheddar or white sauce.

Delish! I did use some of the suggestions: I only used 4 oz of Brie, and only 4 Tb of butter with the about the same amount of breadcrumbs. This was absolutely to die for and I can't wait to make it again.

Frist off let me say I couldn't find Asparagus, the store was sold out!  I substituted Purple Cauliflower and it was excellent.  The sesame seeds add such great flavor.  This dish is so simple yet, great enough for a company dinner. I served it on Easter and everyone loved it.  Great recipe, thanks!

I have made this recipe an uncountable amount of times now.  It is my husbands favorite!  I have even modified it for the grill, and I use different cheeses depending on what I have, but it is always good.  Even with canned asparagus.  My friends and family love it too!

MMM!  So Yummy and Easy!!  My Dad the Asparagus hater ate it!  Changes I made: I simplified this recipe by microwaving the Asparagus in a Glass cassorole  pan with chopped garlic.  Crushed seasoned croutons for the bread crumbs, added mushroom halves, used olive oil.  Pretty much winged it and it turned out GREAT! Flavors compliment eachother well.  TRY THIS!

easy, fancy, delicious.  while asparagus is a great stand-alone this offered a dressed-up alternative.  keep the main dish simple, though.  This dish was rich enough on its own.

It was a very delicious and a relatively simple dish. Much better than boring ol asparagus! I thought it was the best asparagus I'd had in ages...and I tend to eat out alot.

I didn't have sesame seeds so I substituted roasted sliced almonds.  I let the asparagus bake five minutes longer than original recipe before turning on the broiler.

It was good. I used half a wheel of Brie, but shredded it and spread it out over the asparagus in a casserole dish. Came out nicely.  Next time, I'll use chopped almonds instead of sesame seeds to give it a sweeter taste, because it came out a bit salty. Otherwise, very enjoyable.

I had to omit the sesame seeds, as I didn't have any on hand. And next time I make this, I'll probably use more asparagus. But the boyfriend and I were pleased to find a way to eat brie without crackers, so thanks!

Very yummy, although I don't exactly know how much was in my hunk of left over brie.  I cut the brie very thin and let the topping get very crispy under the broiler.  I'd make again if I had some brie to use up.  I doubt I'd buy brie just to make it.

I made this just today, and sauteed the asparagus instead of steaming.  Not the healthiest modification, but it was the most delicious dish I, and my company, have ever tasted.  And we can all bulk up a little for sake of Thanksgiving, right?  

Thanks so much!

The crumb topping was excellent with the sesame seeds.  The cheese did not melt like I expected as the white rind of the cheese sat on top of the asparagus and the cheese melted to the bottom.  My company loved it though.

This is a really great dish.  The brie and asparagus compliment each other very well, and we'll be having this again.  Just not too often, because it is very rich.

Funny, those who already love asparagus will like this dish, but those who really don't care for asparagus will REALLY like this dish.  Even kids - not sure if its the cheese or what, who cares as long as they eat it!  Thanks!

Thank you for your recipe idea and instructions. Since I don't personally care for the flavor of any cheese in the category of soft cheeses I opted for the semi-soft smoked gouda instead. As with others who mentioned there is too much cheese I also halved the amount because prefer asparagus and cheese not cheese and asparagus. I also substituted Panko crumbs for the bread crumbs because Panko gives a lighter crunchier coating (used your recommended amount though). Oh, and did use toasted sesame seeds because I love their flavor and was a nice compliment to the smoked gouda.

A little greasy but good nevertheless. Used slivered almonds as I thought that flavor would go better with the brie. Still liked grilled asparagus better.

This recipe sounded so good but I was very disappointed.  I thought it would have a better flavor, but maybe it would have been better with a stronger cheese.  The brie just didn't cut it.  The preparation that went in for this side dish just was NOT worth the effort.

I really love the topping and I am going to use it again on other  dishes. I am a little crazy when it come to brie. If it is not completely fresh I don't like it's taste. My brie was not past date, but I think the dish would have been better if it was fresher.

Oh Muh Gaaah....Iit was Delicious!! I did a double bunch, only used a wedge of Brie ( frozen and shredded), substituted almonds for the sesame seeds and used Tastefully Simple's- Garlic Pepper Seasoning in the bread crumb mixture. WOW....Thanks for the Inspiration!!

I used 4 oz double-cream brie, sliced in two long strips. Baked 8 minutes, then used the back of a spoon to mash/spread the mixture a bit to cover the asparagus more before broiling 3-5 minutes. The brie flavor wasn't too strong, and I'd actually like to try doing the butter/breadcrumb/sesame seed mixture on asparagus without the cheese.

If you like Brie Cheese and love Asparagus you'll really like this combo!!! I made just 2 servings and a little less cheese.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't use the complete wheel of brie and only half of the bread crumbs.  We prefer to taste the vegetable with the add on as a complement.  I will absolutely make this recipe again!
