This was ok, but, unfortuneately, not one of our favorites. While there were a lot of different flavors going on, I felt that it was still lacking...something. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but maybe salt, pepper and garlic in both the salsa and pork glaze would've been nice. I was still glad to try something new, but it just didn't hit the mark w/ my family. Thanks for sharing. :)

I loved the pineapple salsa however in the future I will leave out the cilantro.

Probably one of my favorite pork loin recipes. Easy to make and not very messy. You might think two pounds is a lot but it cooks down a bit and it tastes so good that your family will pick it clean.

I actually only made the salsa as I served it with Jerk Pork instead.  For the salsa I added about a tablespoon of fresh lime juice and it was delicious.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit! My only serving suggestion is let the salsa warm up to room temp before serving otherwise the cold salsa sucks the warmth right out of the pork. This one makes the permanent master list at my house!

I made this as is no changes. My husband and myself love this recipe! The pineapple salsa in my opinion sets this over the top. We have used the salsa for other recipes as well. We make this once a month and never tire of it!

Tried it and loved it. Contrary to another reviewer I kept the cilantro but added more ginger and garlic. Lovely dish.

This was a big hit. The pork was perfectly cooked... juicy and delicious. This is a super easy pineapple salsa recipe. I removed seeds and membrane and the salsa had the perfect amount of heat. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this several times over the last few years. I like to brown the meat first with salt and pepper in olive oil. I also baste the meat a few times while it is roasting. I heat the salsa in a fry pan with a couple of table spoons of soya sauce and I double the sweet pepper. I don't cook it I just warm it up and then I serve slices of the tenderloin over rice with the salsa on top!
