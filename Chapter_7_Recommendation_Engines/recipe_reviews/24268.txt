I loved how easy and delicious this dish was.  I did make some modifications though, which I think truly added to the flavor of this dish.  I added olives and a couple splashes of red wine as the sauce was simmering.  I used pennine rigate instead of fusili.  After tossing the pennine in the sauce, I added some crumbled feta cheese and then tossed again.  I served with grated parmesan cheese on top.  This dish is to die for....so yummy.

I enjoyed this recipe and plan on adding it to my regular rotation.  I followed the recipe exactly and recommend it.  Some people may want to add some garlic.

Very good recipe!  Definitely add salt. I added a splash of red wine and some Italian spice and a dash of fat-free creamer, and I think it would have been fantastic without the pesto, which itself was great.  The addition of the pesto makes the red tomato sauce an unusual color...I didn't mind but it might throw off kids or people who aren't expecting it. All in all, a success.

I was very impressed with how this recipe turned out. I guess by some interpretations it may be a bit bland, but I fully enjoyed the light flavor as did my guests. I will definitely make it again.

Okay, well this is good and will do for a busy day. It is a no-brainer, soooo easy to make and I did not even have to buy any of the ingredients since I already had them all on hand. I might make this again but will add grilled chicken.

This is a very good dish I will make again!  
Modifications:
I used long fusili and topped the pasta with pieces of grilled chicken.
I added kalamata olives and a couple splashes of red wine to the sauce as other reviewers suggested.

Excellent recipe... I used garlic-flavoured tomatoes and it was still a tad bland.  Would be good with fresh basil, maybe feta cheese for more flavour.  Tastes like a decadent restaurant meal!

This was very tasty! The whole family enjoyed it, including kids 9, 7, and 4. I thought the amount of sauce was perfect for the amount of noodles (we used brown rice fettucine.) The pesto I used was a homemade spinach basil pesto with lots of flavor, so I think that made it extra yummy. The color was a little strange, but once it was mixed it with the noodles it wasn't as noticable. Also, I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers but only used 4 T olive oil. A perfect quick lunch.

Made this for dinner last night, I followed the recipe as is, except did not add any salt & pepper and used 16 oz. of fusilli. This was absolutely delicious with some chicken breast tenderloins marinated in Italian dressing then baked at 350 for 40 minutes. My husband went back for seconds, something he RARELY does. We sprinkled some red pepper flakes over the top of ours, really brought out the flavors. I can't wait to eat some of the leftovers for lunch today, maybe with some pine nuts sprinkled on top!

This was excellent and so easy. My husband raved over every bite.  I recently started using whole grain pasta and he didn't even notice! I'm good at missing the small details in recipes, such as draining the tomatoes, but it made no difference in this one.  Based on previous reviews, I added a splash of red wine and some Italian seasoning. I'll definitely be making this one again and again.

Very nice! I used a sun-dried tomato pesto, added more garlic, salt, pepper, and dried basil, and threw in a few tablespoons of red wine as well. Served over whole-wheat fusili. Nice, full-bodied pasta that's a nice (and easy) alternative to the store-bought marinara sauce.

I loved how easy and fast I was able to make this.  I added 1 more clove of garlic, a splash of Shiraz, some Italian seasoning as well as a little basil for added flavor.  As for the Pasta, since I didn't have Fusili I used Rotini.  It was delicious.

Tasty and easy. I used a pound of pasta so I added another spoon full of pesto and I didn't drain the tomatoes because I wanted it a little more saucy. Turned out great.

Very very good.  I used the Pesto Sauce recipe from this site.  I added more pesto than called for...like 1 cup.  Without the addition I don't think the pasta would be very pesto-y.

This was very easy and I made it and loved it as is. I might add a little more pesto next time, as I love the flavor it adds (not sure if my kids will like that as much, though.) Also would double the sauce next time  for the name amount of pasta.

I found this recipe very easy to follow. Don't burn the garlic like I did. The recipe said use fusili but I'm pretty sure that they meant spaghetti. Although I have given this dish 3 stars it actually deserves 4.

Great if you are in a hurry. I added red wine, beef, pasta water, and lots of cheese plus spices. Next time, roasted grape tomatoes.

We added a can of black beans at the same time as the tomatoes.  It came out pretty good.  I liked it more than my boyfriend, but he's not big on pasta.  I had leftovers for several days.

Very good.  Easy to add any spice.  From my spice rack, I added dried oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper and pepper flakes for a nice kick.  I also added onions and fresh chilantro because I didn't have basil and used 3 cloves of garlic instead of two.  I only had speghetti noodles, worked just fine! Sprinkled freshly grated parmesan cheese on top, delicious!  I like it because it's nice and light, however, my husband would've liked it better if it was thicker.  Because of that, I'd rate 4.5 but I'll give it a 5 because I'm the cook! Thanks for the simple recipe.

Has the potential to be great. I too found it a little dull even though I used fresh tomatoes. Next time I would more tomatoes and some other veggies like spinach, mushrooms, green peppers. Feta cheese would be good
