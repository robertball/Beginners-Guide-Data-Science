I followed the instructions but had to cook a smaller portion and they came out a little burned. In another recipe for Brussels sprouts from the airfryer it said about 2 x 5 minutes on 350 degrees or 175 celcius.  That seems safer. But apart from that.. nice recipe!

How to make Brussels sprouts without smelling up the house. I loved the simplicity of this recipe. I used a Philips Viva air fryer and found that at 7 or 8 minutes they were almost burnt. I turned down the temp to 160C for another 5 minutes and they were crispy outside, tender - not mushy inside. There are many variables to consider (machine, size of vegetables, etc.), but this is definitely a fantastic way to cook Brussels sprouts! Thank you for the recipe.

Simple and delicious! The one problem I did have or almost had was with the cooking time. I went to shake them at 8 minutes and they were pretty charred. I turned them over and went for another 2 minutes. Any longer and they would have burnt. Next time I might cut them in half to get the flavor more throughout. Overall great recipe just watch them closely so you don't end up burning them.
