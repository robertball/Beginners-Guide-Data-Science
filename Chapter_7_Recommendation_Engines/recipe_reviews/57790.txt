Excellent both hot and cold. Quite similar to a cajun recipe but much lower in fat and easier to prepare. Excellent as a topper for a quick salad. I used a nonstick pan and a little cooking spray and was able to reduce the butter to 1 TB (just for flavor). 2 TB chipotle in adobo sauce (this is the correct spelling, not adobe!) gives a high mild/low medium heat level so increase/decrease the amount used to suit your taste. FYI - you will only use 2-3 chipotles in this recipe. Empty the can into a plastic container and store in your fridge. They keep for quite a long time. The adobo sauce adds a nice smoky and spicy flavor to recipes.

I have made this several times now and we thoroughly enjoyed it!  I could only find whole chipotle peppers and found that if I take the seeds out before mincing, it's not quite as hot - which is how we like it. I too made it with chicken breast strips using non-stick spray for the chicken breasts and 1 Tbl. margerine for reduced fat. I sauted the chicken first and removed it to a warm platter.  Then made the sauce, putting the chicken in the re-heat. When making the shrimp, I used pre-cooked, frozen thawed shrimp and put it in the sauce while it was simmering.  Use the large, pre-cooked frozen shrimp (our store has been running 2 for 1 specials on bags of this).  Delicious!!  (also, I served the rice on the side)

Tossed this over pasta instead of rice.  Added stir-fryed vegetables with it and doubled the sauce ingredients to cover the vegetables.

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe.  I was looking to replicate a dish we had in a restaurant and this was very close.  The salt is absolutely unnecessary and I recommend removing the chipotle seeds - we love hot food, but this recipe can easily get too spicy.

If you can't cook and want to impress someone this recipe is DEFINITELY the way to go.  I love to cook, and I can't get enough of this one.  We like to eat it over orzo pasta!

I made the recipe as outlined, but had a little confusion about "chipotle peppers in adobo sauce".  Do I make adobo sauce and then put the peppers in it?  Is there a recipe you use for adobo sauce?  I didn't see adobo sauce on any shelf at the grocery store so that part of the recipe has me stumped.  Can someone explain?

This is so GOOD!!  But be warned unless you like spicy this is not your dish.  My tips would be if you like it real hot don't change a thing if your in the middle use only 1 tblspn chiplote.  I also served it with pasta.  would not be bad wrapped in a flour tortilla!!

Excellent dish!!  And so quick too!  Shrimp were done before the rice finished steaming!  The sauce was delicious over rice.  I may use a little less salt next time.

My husband & I absolutely loved this!  As suggested, I took the seeds out of the peppers & only used a pinch of salt.  I fixed pasta instead of rice & doubled the sauce recipe.

This was awesome...I loved the flavor. I only used half the pepper because my girlfriend doesn't like it spicy.  I also added deep fried tofu for my girlfriend who doesn't eat meat.  Both turned out great, I will totally make this again.

I added a bit of lime to the shrimp as they were cooking (~1/2 tsp) since other chipotle recipes call for lime and added soy sauce to taste at the end instead of salt to give the flavor more depth.  I enjoy spicy food and didn't find this hot at all - it just had a nice smokey taste.

Great recipe with a nice kick to it.  I too used linguini and it turned out great.  Since I wasn't using rice, I did 1.5x the sauce ingredients, and once the shrimp was done cooking I removed them.  I raised the heat to high and reduced the  sauce until it was reasonably thick.  Adding the shrimp back in, this resulted in a great coating when tossed in with the pasta.

Instead of shrimp, I used chicken drumettes. Brown them until the skin is crisp and cooked through. Combine sauce ingredients and add 2 T. honey to balance the saltiness and spiciness. Dip drumette pieces while still hot and coat with sauce. Serve as an appetizer with a cold beverage. Addicting!

I thought that this was really spicy, but I have wimpy tastebuds.  My husband thought it was just right.  I used chicken broth instead of the wine.  I also had small shrimp that was already peeled and deveined, which made this dish very fast to prepare and cook.

This was very good! I altered it by thickening the sauce with some cornstarch and water, I also added some lemon and lime juice as well as some brown sugar to sweeten it up, I couldn't find chipoltes in abode sauce but used ones I found canned in some kind of tomato sauce, I also didn't have dry red wine but I used the white wine I had, overall this was delicious and I will forsure be making it again!

This had fabulous taste - but I didn't have the chipotle in adobo sauce... so i improvised.. I added 1tbsp of crushed chipotle and added extra wine, whorchestire, some vinegar and oregano to add some boost. I found the sauce very runny and wasn't thickening to my liking. 
so i took the shrimp out once cooked and added some heavey cream to thicken it. it was delcious. 
i would double the ingredients next time to make more sauce. 
great flavours!

The family liked it a lot, but the flavor wasn't pervasive.  I used precooked shrimp so the next time I will use raw.  Hopefully they will pick up more of the flavor.  Also the Chipotle's may need a finer mince.

Wow, loved this dish & it was super quick to get on the table!!  I cut down the butter by half and also sprayed my pan a bit.  Only thing I left out was the salt as I didn't think it was necessary.  Served over basmati rice with steamed carrots and beans on the side.  Repeat dish for sure, yummy!  Oh, and yes, the chipotle peppers w/adobo will keep for quite some time stored in an airtight container in the fridge (mine are in a glass pyrex)!

What a great, fast dinner.  The taste was superb and I look forward to using the Chipotle/adobo sauce peppers again; they have a wonderful smoky flavor. I added 8 oz of portobella mushrooms because I add them to just about every recipe I make. I'm not giving it 5 stars because my kids complained that there wasn't enough "sauce" for the rice.

This is a good recipe that 'Gourmet' published a few years back and used it as an appetizer (no rice). It was a big hit as an appetizer. Seems a bit much for an entree. It is really rich. I think the butter could be cut back and still be as good and better for you.

This recipe is awesome.  Spicy, and really fast and easy.  I'm not a big fan of rice, so I do it with linguine. This one is a hit with my family.  It's definately on the repeat order list!

Made this for supper the other night. I liked the spice but my husband thought it overpowered the taste of the shrimp. Maybe next time, I'll cut down on amount of chipotle pepper. Thanks for a different and easy shrimp recipe.

I like this well enough to make it again for dinner tonight. Last time I let it get a tad too thick. This time, I'm going for a looser sauce. Quick, easy and delicious!  Be aware that all chipotles in adobo are not equally hot! They range from relatively mild to singe-your-hair-off. If you haven't used a particular brand before, it's a good idea to taste-test the heat before using them in a dish.

Great recipe. It had a nice bite to it and left the lips tingling. Works great with a side of steamed veggies.

This was really good.  I loved the flavours.  It didn't make much sauce for the rice though, so I squeezed some fresh lime into it.  I like the bit of tang the lime added to the bite of the peppers.

I have to give this 3 stars, because it was so HOT and SPICY!  Most folks seem to like things that hot, but it really was difficult to eat this. I love Tabasco Chipotle sauce and thought this would be similar but it wasn't. Also, my husband who loves spicy foods (jalapeno on anything) and he admitted that this was too hot.  It would probably be better for wimps like me if it was mixed with some diced tomatoes to break up the spicy bite.  The smokiness of the dish was wonderful though.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I took one of the tips on here and doubled the sauce ingredients (except the butter). I also added just a little conrstach to thicken the sauce at the end and garnished w/cilantro. I didn't think it was too spicy at all

This recipe was OK, but the chipotle flavor was overpowering for us, and there wasn't enough sauce for the rice. If you really like chipotle you'll love this recipe.

I've made this many times now and I can't get enough.  My hubby and I are chileheads, so I add about another chipotle, increase the red wine to half a cup or more, add the juice of one lime and garnish with a couple handfuls of chopped cilantro.  I only add salt to taste as the butter and worcestershire sauce (and the shrimp themselves, for that matter) are quite salty on their own.

Excellent smokey flavor!  This is a perfect dish for a cold winter night.  I needed more sauce at the last minute, so I think next time I would double the sauce ingredients.

This was so tasty.   I also removed the seeds from two peppers (came out to 1T of peppers), doubled the sauce ingredients, and only salted to taste at the end.  I served it over the Cilantro-Lime Rice recipe also on this site. This was fast and delicious!

This is not a main dish. There isn't anywhere near enough sauce to put over rice, but what an appetizer it makes! Make early in the morning and store in refrigerator til cocktails are served.  Everyone raved!!

Great recipe and the heat was just right. I did make a slight change. I used only one tablespoon of butter and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. This is a keeper.

This was tasty, but I have to agree that the chipotle overpowered the dish.  Halfway through enjoying it our noses were running!  Unless you are one of those people who put tabasco on everything, I think 1 tbsp would do this meal nicely.

This is so tasty! I was surprised at how good it is without reducing the wine or simmering the flavors! This is my new favorite because it takes less than 5 minutes! Just discovered this recipe and already served the shrimp on salad, in  tacos with slaw, and over rice with the sauce. Great as appetizer too! Easy and flavorful gives it a 5 star rating!

I tried this recipe twice... first exactly as written.  A Good recipe and worth four stars.  The second time I thought that it might need a little extra, so I added the juice of half of a lime and two tablespoons of fresh cilantro.  Both ways work well... it's just a matter of taste.

Delicious.  Added onions, which absorbed the sauce in an amazingly delicious way, and zucchini to make it more robust.  Also served over brown rice.

I made this tonight and while it tasted fine it is a bit unusual in flavor. I wouldn't rave about it like others did but good if you want something different. Agree with using less salt and butter which is what I did.

This recipe was okay, as is...The chipotle peppers (I used 2) would have been way too spicy had I just followed the recipe exacly (at this point it was about 3 stars).  After I cooked the shrimp in the adobo/wine sauce, it was a deep red color (from the wine and peppers) - looked nothing like the photo, so I added heavy cream and sour cream to soften the flavor - turned out much better!  I also stirred in some chopped cilantro and lime right before serving.

Very tasty, but extremely HOT!  I had to pick out every little red dot to avoid as much of the chipotle pepper as possible, but it was so good it was worth it!  I do like spicy foods but I don't like to sweat while eating.  I think next time I will pull all of the peppers in the can and just use 2 Tbsp of whatever is left in the can!

These were really easy to make and surprisingly delicious. As you can tell from my picture, I served them over rice. They'd be great grilled (like on skewers) and served as appetizers.

I loved it--I am a spice lover and I double the chipotle.  My husband's drank a lot of water that night.  I am going to use chicken breast the next time.

I love spicy, but this is a bit too much.
This is fast and easy. A recipe to work on and improve. Needs a bit more of a less spicy sauce.

A great, quick recipe. We used orzo, slightly undercooked instead of rice. Orecchiette would probably be great as well.  We puree a small can of chipotle in adobo and keep it  in the refrigerator indefinitely -  can also be frozen but this will increase the  intensity or the pepper taste.  1 tsp of pureed chipotle is probably sufficient  unless you really like HOT. On the advice of others we also omitted the salt in the recipe except for a little in the wat er to cook the pasta.

My husband and I enjoyed the dish and will probably make it again for ourselves. Our two daughters age 4 and 20 months) hated it. No matter what I did my 4-year-old said it was too spicey -- and I admit it was a little spicey. I ended up fishing out as much of the chipolte peppers on their plates as possible. Then I stirred in a bunch of chicken broth. my 20 month old girl loved it this way. My 4-year-old ate it but acted like I was torturing her.
