I followed the recipe. It was too much mayo and the chicken flavor did not work. I added 8 oz. sour cream + a dribble more of lemon juice.  This complemented salmon very well.

A great way to make cauliflower more interesting! Very simple. The sauce is very rich, so I served it on the side. We entertain teenagers a lot, and it was a hit with them!

I made this but instead of the soup, I used plain greek yogurt (which i use instead of sour cream), Greek Thyme , lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I also ran my cauliflower thru a processer, so I could mimick the look and feel of potatoes which on a low glycemic diet, i cant have.

Great sauce.  It was a perfect enhancement for cauliflower.  Would probably go well with broccoli, too.  I will definitely make again.

I only tasted the soup.  The previous rating was correct in suggest serving the sauce on the side if you want to try it.

I've had 2 bags of frozen cauliflower in my freezer for months.  This recipe got them used and eaten with no complaints.  Super easy, super quick, and with very good results.
