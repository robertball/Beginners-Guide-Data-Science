I just made this and absolutely love it! The flavor is fantastic. I was a little skeptical about the lime juice and a full tablespoon of curry but it is great. I did add a medium onion. I used light coconut milk and a 4 cups of vegetable broth. Oh and only a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Thank you for this great recipe.

Really good, especially for a healthy vegan soup. Consider cutting the pepper in 1/2. It's pretty spicy as listed.

I absolutely adore this soup!  I added extra curry and lime because I don't like the taste of coconut very much. Tried it once without the lime because I didn't have any, and it wasn't nearly as good.  Also, I have made it with both vegetable broth and chicken broth, and I think the chicken broth gives it a better flavor.

Amazingly delicious soup. Readily available ingredients, simple to make, vegan friendly, healthy, and very affordable add bonus points to this recipe! We made this as written. Blended the soup in a Vitamix blender making it very smooth. After blending, sampled the soup and it tasted fantastic before adding the coconut milk & lime for anyone not having or wanting those ingredients. We garnished the soup w/ toasted herb bread crumbs which created a great combination. Great recipe jes5ika, and thank you for sharing!

Incredible soup! I adjusted the recipe for 8 servings and am sorry I didn't make even more.  It was as good or better than any soup I've had in a restaurant and that comes from a soup-aholic! 5 stars from me!

Very, very tasty!  I will add to my rotation.  Used almond milk instead of coconut, all else was the same.  Very tasty!  It was creamy as well.

Super easy delicious soup.  I didn't have any curry powder, but I did have red curry paste, so I substituted 2 tsps.  I also used the entire 32oz carton of vegie broth and 1 can of lite coconut milk. Definitely a keeper!

So good!  I've never tried making a coconut-based soup before (but I love them at Thai restaurants), and I was amazed how thick and rich it is.  The taste is amazing, and it freezes beautifully!  Next time I'm going to roast some cashews and puree them with the soup.

Good soup recipe. We didn't have lime and still enjoyed it. I may add more curry next time as it was a little mild for us. My husband had his second bowl over jasmine rice and it was also good.

This soup totally hit the spot for me tonight! It wasn't vegan friendly (I used chicken broth I had made two weeks earlier and added lamb meatballs) but it warmed me right up! I used a lot more vegetables and garlic than recommended, so I could puree about a third of them to get the thickness and could leave the rest of the vegetables chunky in the soup itself. I also added ginger and didn't even need the coconut milk. I ate it with a dollop of plain yoghurt mixed in. De-li-cious!

I found that the soup was quite bland when I made it initially. I added some rice to it and let it sit for a day- I found that the flavour was a lot better after that. I also added some ginger which heightened more of the carrot flavour. It tasted good drunk as well.

EXTREMELY delicious!!  We have a farm, and was looking for a cauliflower soup without the cheese and cream.  Used skim milk and a 1/3 of a cup of evaporated milk.  Tastes creamy and delicious!  Used sweet onion and a bit of red cayenne pepper.  It is spicy, but good!  Tastes fattening without the fat!  A real winner!

With a few tweaks, this recipe turned out awesome! My hubby roasted the carrots and cauliflower but also sauteed half a sweet onion and the garlic to add to the soup pot. Before blending everything, he also added in some roasted yellow pepper. We garnished it with crispy shallots. Excellent!

Loved it! Added some green curry paste instead of curry powder, and added an extra pinch of ginger.

This soup was delicious! I enjoyed the flavor of coconut that came through. I finished it off with a teeny bit of lime due to a review I read about the amount overpowering the dish. For a non-vegetarian option, I crisped up some pancetta to spinkle on top.

Really easy tasty recipe. Curry powder varies in spiciness, so I suggest adding half a tablespoon first, puree, taste, and then add more to taste. It was yummy even without the coconut milk, but lovely with it and the lime. I added a cup of extra broth and the puree was still pretty thick.

Great recipe, a really nice and tasty soup with a fairly simple ingredient list.  I doubled the garlic and added a sprinkle of garam masala when roasting the vegetables, which only roasted for about 25 minutes total.  I blended it in my regular blender because I don't have an immersive one and I wanted it smoother than a potato masher could get it.  Great find, will definitely make this again!

This is really a delicious soup! I made only a couple of changes. After roasting the carrots and cauliflower, I cooked 1/2 a chopped onion in oil until translucent, then added the garlic, about 1/2 tbsp fresh grated ginger, and the curry powder and cooked for about 2 minutes. Added the roasted vegetables and 4 cups of chicken broth and simmered until vegetables were tender. I used an immersion blender to puree, then added salt, pepper and coconut oil. Very flavorful- will definitely make again!

I made this with a larger quantity of carrots and cauliflower, and intended to add more liquid than I did (also changed), but it was soooo good just the way it turned out!  I used about 16 long medium-skinny carrots, a small head of cauliflower, a large sweet onion and 4 cloves of garlic. I tossed it all with 2 tablespoons olive oil (next time I will use 1 tblsp. to cut the fat) and salt ground over top. I only added about 1/4 tsp black pepper.  I roasted all veggies at 400 but for an hour. Then I heated a carton (900 ml) of veggie stock, stirred in the tblsp. of curry powder, juice of 1 lime, and a can of coconut milk. I mashed the garlic cloves that I roasted, and added to liquid. Then I added the rest of the veggies and used an immersion blender to create a very chunky pureed soup. Such awesome blending of flavours.

Hated it... too much curry and too much stock.  I could barely taste the refined roasted cauliflower flavor.

This soup is amazing! I didn't have any coconut milk so I used half and half.  I needed to puree mine in a blender because I wanted it really creamy, so I recommend that!  I tried using a potato masher first, and it just wasn't working.  The soup has a little heat to it, but I don't like spicy things and didn't mind it.  It's especially delicious if you serve it with sour cream and tortilla chips! YUM.

This is a fabulous fall soup! I added a red onion, cut the curry in half and used lite (5%) cream in place of the coconut milk. I would make it again the same way.

My spouse and I loved it! It is a very flavorful soup...the lime gives it a bit of a surprise tang. I used 6 really large carrots and a whole, small head of cauliflower. For the liquid, I ended up using the entire 32 oz. container of vegetable stock and 13.5 oz can of coconut milk. It is on the sweet side, with the carrots, coconut milk and lime.

So I made it twice. Once with curry and once without. I really liked it without. I also added an onion, juice from 2 limes and the whole can of coconut milk. Super easy to make. I’m might try it with a little sweet potato next time.

I just made this soup.  Not something I would normally go for, but I had all ingredients and it was complex and very tastey.  My cauliflower was a small head and I would have liked some more.  Overall, 4 stars.

I  had to guess on the quantity depending on the size of my cauliflower head and carrots.   It would be better if they listed them as how many cups of diced vegetables.  

My immersion blender made for a smooth texture.  I doubled the recipe and used about 3 tablespoons of curry paste, which gave it a nice kick.  Served topped with a dollop of sour cream and sliced green onions.  My husband was skeptical but he had seconds.

Absolutely love this soup. I have made several times and it's always a hit. I pretty much follow the recipe exactly, maybe adding slightly more lime juice. It stores well and tastes even better after a day or so.

Great taste and texture. I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm on the Daniel Fast so as is, it works for my eating plan but it could use some kind of sour cream or something to break up the flavor.

Made it once following the recipe.  I'd give it 4 stars.  Quite good.
However the 2nd time I made it I used Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste instead of curry powder and I threw in about 1/2 cup of raw cashews to boil with the stock.  This made it a 5 star recipe- so creamy and a hint of lemon grass from the curry paste.  We make it all the time now like this and all 4 of my kids love it.

Just had a bowl, steaming hot. Delicious!! I doubled the recipe since I had a head of cauliflower I needed to use up. I added half of a large leftover red onion & 2 portabella mushrooms. Like someone suggested I sprinkled some garam masala before roasting. 30 minutes in the oven was perfect. Used the food processor in batches, left it slightly thick and a little chunky. Thanks for another great recipe!

I wanted a way to use up half of a head of cauliflower and came across this recipe.  I roasted a couple of medium onions and I forgot to chop the garlic so I roasted a  couple of cloves along with the carrots and cauliflower.  I didn't have coconut milk so I substituted with plain 2% yogurt.  It gives it a bit of a yogurt/sour taste (which I like) but I will have to try this with the coconut milk.  I also added 1/2 TBSP of cinnamon - it just seemed to me it it would suit this recipe, and it does.  Very good!  I will definitely make this again.

I had more cauliflower than carrots but otherwise made this as-is, and it was delicious. Both of my 2 year olds ate it, even the picky one. I made 1.5 recipes, and it was probably enough for 4 adults and 2 kids.

I doubled this recipe but reduced the number of carrots to 9 from 12.  I  used no salt added vegetable and no salt added chicken stock and didn't add any pepper.  And of course I didn't add any salt.  The curry in this recipe adds lots of flavour and there is no need for the salt.  Other than that I went by the recipe.  I love it.  Perfect flavouring.  This one is a keeper for our family.

I was going out of town and didn't want to waste a head of cauliflower I had in fridge. I really liked this—very satisfying. I had to use more broth, I think bec I used a whole head of cauliflower instead of half; I added onion to the roasting veggies (as submitter suggested); and I added some cumin, coriander, and grated fresh ginger, too.

Made this soup tonight after doing a web search for the ingredients I had on hand.  I'm sure glad I found this recipe.  I did make some changes: (1) I doubled the recipe (figured that roasting 2 batches of vegetables at once made sense), (2) included a chopped onion in the roasted vegetable mixture, (3) Used quite a bit less stock (8 c for double recipe) and more coconut milk (2 cans for double recipe) than called for, (4) used red curry paste instead of regular curry powder (1/4 c; these pastes do vary in heat so I tasted along the way so as not to add too much), (5) Chopped some fresh basil into the soup at the last moment (happened to have it on hand), (6) Cut down on pepper.  Used an immersion blender to achieve a smooth consistency.  The final product was a restaurant worthy soup.  LOVED it.

It's a 4-star recipe with a full teaspoon of pepper.  With less pepper it's a 5 star recipe. Definitely worth a try! It's creamy, delicious, and healthy!

This was SO yummy I'm making it again tonight. I agree with some of the other reviewers and added a little extra broth and an onion. I only added a pinch of pepper and used skim milk. Overall, excellent!!!!!

Fabulous! I used 2 small cans of coconut milk (160 mls each), which amounted to a little more than a cup, and all the juice of one lime. Once it was ready, we could hardly wait to dig in and it did not disappoint. Wonderful recipe!

This was excellent. I would keep some extra coconut milk on hand in case you feel like it needs it and add more curry powder. I agreed with another reviewer and added sautéed onions to the pot the same time I added the roasted veggies.   I also added a bit more lime and salt for taste. 
If you like spicy sprinkle dome cayenne. So good!!!

oh wow, this is scrumptious!  just the right balance of the sweet from the carrot, the tart from the citrus, and the creaminess of the coconut milk.  So simple. I think roasting the veggies added a slight bit of a nice roasted flavor so I would not skip this part. I had a whole head of cauliflower so I used it all and basically eyeballed. used lemon instead of lime, as it was what I had on hand and I always use some of the zest because it seems to add more citrus flavor without being too sour. Used the whole can of coconut milk, and 3 cans of veggie broth. I also roasted the several pieces of garlic, and half an onion with the other veggies.  so simple, quick, easy but with an incredible amt. of flavor and complexity.  thank you so much for this recipe; will be one of my favorites each fall/winter.

Kind of unusual flavors, but this was tasty and comforting.  Tasted even better as leftovers!

I really enjoyed making and EATING this soup!  A rich, warm dish for  a fall evening. The color and texture is wonderful.  I agree with the earlier comment that it tastes a bit peppery, so would reduce the amount of pepper used. My variation, I added onions to the mix.

Delicious, healthy soup with interesting flavor profile. I added onion also.  It's not quite 5 stars, but 4 1/2 for sure!

Really superb! I added one more cup of stock and next time I would use 1/2 as much pepper, it's a little overpowering. This recipe is rich, and has a really fantastic flavour profile!

As written, the lime was so overpowering that it spoiled everything. We had to add sugar to compensate.

A really delicious soup! I used a whole cauliflower, 1 onion, four carrots instead of the recommended veg. Also used 5 cups chicken broth and a full can of coconut milk. And I added I tiny bit more curry powder. I will definitely make this soup again!

Omg soooo good.  I'm not sure if my ratios were off but I ended up adding an entire can of coconut milk. I also sautéed onions, then added the curry powder, vegetables and stock.  So good!  Restaurant quality for sure as another reviewer mentioned.  Will make again and again!

This soup is really yummy!  I know it's a vegan soup but I did add some diced chicken breast to it because of who I was feeding.  It really didn't need the chicken though, it's good enough on it's own.  :)

Delicious and easy! I found the carrots took longer to cook than the cauliflower, so I might chop them smaller next time? I used half the curry powder and it had a nice 'bite'.
