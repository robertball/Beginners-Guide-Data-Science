Made it for for 12, it was delish! Homemade guacamole and homemade pick de Gallo, used corn tortillas for more flavor. I would use crushed pineapple next time.

I am a big big fan of the Al Pastor at my local Mexican restaurant. Have been a little intimidated by the traditional spit roasting, so looked up a recipe that was a little more accessible. 

This is so so good. Does not taste like what my restaurant serves, but I will definitely make it again. 

I forgot fresh garlic and didnâ€™t have minced, so I used a liberal tablespoon. Also was liberal with the cumin. 

I used two pounds of meat and cut into smaller chunks, so I only pressure cooked for 30 minutes. I used fresh pineapple, and after shredding meat and adding pineapple, I sprayed with cooking oil to help with browning under the broiler. I definitely went more than 5 minutes, but I stirred it a few times. My favorite parts of the meat are always the super crispy parts. 

Downfall: just a smidge too spicy. My kids will not eat it. Next time I will only add one chipotle. I served it with caramelized onions, fresh cilantro, Monterrey Jack cheese, and lime wedges.  

Also: So as to not waste the extra pineapple juice and chipotle peppers leftover, I made a second batch of marinade and froze it. I actually added a bit more chipotle peppers to that batch.... so most definitely will either use more meat or plan on feeding the kids something else.
