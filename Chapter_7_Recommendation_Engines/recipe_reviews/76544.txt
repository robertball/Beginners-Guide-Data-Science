Everyone liked this recipe.  However, it's better if you double the batter (it makes it thicker ) and if you use grated apple instead of slices.

THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  I DOUBLED THE RECIPE & INCREASED THE BAKING TIME TO 20 MINUTES...IT WAS PERFECT.  WE'VE HAD IT 2 WEEKENDS IN A ROW FOR BREAKFAST, BUT WHO SAYS WE CAN'T HAVE IT FOR DINNER WITH SOME SLICED HAM AND NICE FRESH SWEET BREAD...YUMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I melted some cheddar cheese on top before sprinkling the cinnamon. It turned out quite delicious.

This recipe definitely needs something... Perhaps if I ever try this again, i would double the amount of eggs.  I will also give the apple grating a try.  Cook time was not 10 mins... i gave it at least 30.

AH! We loved it! I did have to double the recipe simple because it wasn't going to be enough. Just be sure to slice your apples thinly otherwise they'll take longer to soften/cook.

This is really good. I didn't have any apples so I used sliced strawberries. I didn't double the mixture. I was only serving 2 people. We each had half with an english muffin on the side. I'll definitely make this again. I might play around with it a bit.

Excellent flavor. Instead of sprinkling white sugar on top, try brown sugar.

I did 1.5 times the batter and did not peel the apples.  I wish I had doubled the apples, though and will next time I make it.  My children both LOVED it.

Yummy! I made it with granny smith and it was lovely.  I didn't double the apples, but I also didn't have a mixer on hand so I wasn't able to produce the peaky height of the eggs.  I would only do so if the egg could stand up to the weight of the apples.  Definitely nice for something different - anyone have suggestions for what to serve it with?

Submitter's suggestion of doubling apples was a good one.  Although I like cinnamon, I omitted it in this recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was a little bit on the sweeter side then I would have liked and I think that it would have been better if I added more apples to the recipe. As it was I doubled it but I think that I will layer it next time. Otherwise good recipe and I will be making this again.

Loved it, we've made them multiple times. Quick easy and not too filling if you are looking for a light meal.

Easily one of my kids' favorite meals. Easy to prepare and fun to eat. I tripled the recipe though. And I cut the sugar by one third. Still very edible and tasty.

This was a fun change.  I made it for Saturday brunch just for my husband & I.  It would have been very plain without the apples, but was good with!

it was more like a pancake than an omelette possibly because of the flour ingredient. may try again without flour or baking powder.

Put 1 Tbspn sugar instead of 3 in the omelete ( leaves possibility of sprinkling over brown sugar, honey etc later, or lower sugar option ). Also not as time consuming as preparing single serves for more persons.

I made this as directed, my husband loves it. His review? "It's like having dessert and dinner at the same time"! I might reduce the sugar in the meringue portion, and add apples, but it definitely works as written.

Turned out delicious. 
I used it once for an Omelet, but I also used it for a base for muffins. Instead of putting the apple pieces on top, I shredded it and put it in the dough and mixed it with all the other ingredients. 
My friends and I just loved it. :)
