An excellent base recipe for an authentic tasting plum pudding. I used brown sugar instead of white and moistened the mix with molassas and Guinness stout.

Delicious! Walnut in place of pecans also taste great, as do candied cherries instead of candied citron. I thought I'd just try this out this Christmas; this may become a must-have for every Christmas!

Very nice compliment to fruitcake as well as plum pudding cake. I usually make a double recipe.
