BLT's for breakfast! What a great idea! This was really good and microwaving eggs really saves on time especially if you have leftover bacon. I spray a little Pam into a microwave safe bowl so the eggs just slide right out. I use a bit of milk instead of water and do watch you microwave timing. The first time I microwaved an egg it blew up - what a mess! I didn't have a panini press, so I just used a skillet to grill the sandwiches. I put a bit of salt and pepper on the tomatoes and no matter what type of cheese you use as long as it's nice and melty you're bound to enjoy this sandwich.

Pretty good.  I used american instead of swiss and left out the tomato.  It's a good starting point for a sandwich that can be easily customized.

I made this for my husband and he loves it! I used colby cheese instead of swizz cheese and follow the direction on this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I made this tonight and it was very simple to make and wonderful to eat. It was very cold outside, so I made a pot of soup and served this sandwich on the side. Will definitely make this again.
