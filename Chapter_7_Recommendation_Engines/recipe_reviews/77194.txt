This was so delicious!  I did make a few changes but nothing too major and mostly at the suggestion of other reviewers:  blanched peppers for 3 minutes, added one clove minced garlic to carrot/celery saute, doubled red pepper flakes because we like our food spicy, added some salt and garlic powder here and there, and mixed 2tbsp panko bread crumbs to parm.cheese topping for added crunch.   This is definitely going into regular dinner rotation.

First, I hate bell peppers but really wanted to try this dish, I am soo glad I did. I used 4 red bell peppers and made this exactly as the recipe calls with one addition I mixed panko bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese topping to give it a light golden crispy taste and look. The presentation was right out any gourmet cook book photo. The taste was out of this world. My brother hates bell peppers and absolutely loved this dish going back for seconds. I will make this often.

Lovely combination of ingredients creating a beautiful sauce. Almost a shame to mix it up with rice and stuff it in a pepper, but I'm not complaining! I added onion and garlic to the vegetable mix for a more classic Bolognese and even tho' I generally prefer bacon over pancetta, in this case I felt it was well worth using the pancetta as it imparts its own, unique flavor - much different from bacon. Having my own marinara on hand that I had put up from my garden was a definite plus. As I always do with stuffed peppers, I parboiled them for a few minutes before I stuffed them and I believe that's a necessary step.  The filling is not enough to fill 6 peppers so plan on making more than the recipe states.  These were pleasant to prepare as well as to eat  - a definitely enjoyable dinner.  All the ingredients meld to create a flavor all its own and each ingredient plays an important role.  Creative and delicious departure from the classic stuffed pepper.

Out of this world delicious! I made as directed with the only changes being that I used onion instead of celery (didn't have any), added some garlic & didn't slice the peppers in half lengthwise (I took the tops off & gutted out the seeds). I made my own tomato sauce to use in this but I don't think it mattered- we couldn't tell the sauce was homemade with all the ingredients in this recipe. I'll just use jarred sauce next time. I served with polenta although a light salad would make a better side dish. Panna cotta with fresh raspberries on top for dessert (cannoli would also make a fine dessert to go with this). This was a lot of work & took a long time to make but was worth the time & effort. My husband says it gets 10 stars. I highly recommend. Thanks for the recipe.

The dish was very tasty, a hit with my husband and friends.  However, I found prep time to be quite a bit more than 30 minutes.  Also, only had enough rice and beef mixture to fill 4 peppers (the recipe says should be enough for 6 peppers).  Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli - presenation was very colorful, expecially when red bell peppers are used.

Big hit.  I added shredded zuchinni and replaced celery with onion.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Great way to serve vegtables!

Loved this!  My brother said it was absolutely delicious.  I did blanch the peppers for 3 minutes and used onion instead of celery.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly!

I had to use regular bacon because I didn't have time to shop until I found pancetta.   Using pancetta would make it much better, I think, and I also liked the flavor better before adding the cream. Stuffing  peppers with bolognese sauce is a brilliant idea, and I will do this again with brown rice and my regular bolognese sauce.

This was just fabulous....it's a keepr for sure.  I doubled the filling recipe because it just didn' sound like enough, we like the peppers well stuffed...it turned out perfectly!  If you like bolognese, you'll LOVE these stuffed peppers.  Bet they're even better as leftovers...

Absolutely delicious! I really think the pancetta made it and would say if you don't have any it's worth a trip to the market to get that flavor in the dish. I used brown rice instead of white and added some white cheddar to the top of the peppers. The only thing I would do differently next time is to make a double batch because these things go quickly! I also only used 4 peppers and it fit perfectly.  I will be making them again, probably soon. A big hit with the family.

A do again and again!  There was not one single complaint in this family of 4.  

Recipe made exactly 6 large peppers. The only things I did different from the recipe was... 1.)Blanched the peppers for 3 minutes. Next time I will blanch 4 minutes.  2) Added diced mushrooms and red onion. I had some that needed to be used up but this recipe would be great without them too.

A different taste for us but very good stuffed peppers. I've never made a bolognese without onions and garlic, so added those to the veggies. Also par-boiled the peppers for a few minutes to make sure they were tender. Hubby and most of the kids commented that they really liked this but son and I both felt that next time a little more wine can be added and the simmering time will be extended to deepen the flavors a little more. I prepared 1 1/2 times the sauce ingredients and it was the perfect amount. There would not have been enough meat mixture without this adjustment.  We will make these again with the tweaks mentioned. Thanks for sharing!

These were excellent!  The stuffing flavors were awesome.  The cooking time was just about right.  I think blanching the peppers ahead of time might have made them less crunchy, but I like them that way.  I also cut the peppers in half to stuff them.  It seems to be easier for me and I like the presentation.  It is also easier if you do not want to eat a whole stuffed pepper yourself.  The only thing I did differently was leave out the cheese and used coconut milk for the cream due to allergy in the family.

This recipe was delicious!  I usually stray from a recipe quite a bit, but this one I only changed a few things: used brown rice, grated my carrots, and didn't use pancetta.  I also added onion and garlic to my hamburger meat as it was cooking.  I followed some other reviewers and blanched my bell peppers first, and I think that helps a lot.  I also filled my peppers halfway, put a pinch of mozzarella in the center, and topped with more filling. I added a little mozzarella on top for presentation too. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!!

This is so delicious as is, but its also easy leave out ingredients to cut back on prep time without sacrificing taste. When I feel lazy, I often substitute the parmesan cheese, whipping cream, and marinara sauce for Classico's Vodka Sauce and dont bother with the celery or carrots. If I do these things it cuts the prep time and the rice is usually done by the time Im cooking everything else. I top with parmesan cheese. Great recipe, thanks!

Fantastic! I'm a vegetarian, so I left out the pancetta, and used veggie crumble (substitute meat) instead - both my boyfriend and brother, self-proclaimed carnivores, LOVED them. I didn't have celery or red wine on hand, so substituted onion and some vegetable stock - it tasted delicious. Also substituted italian herbs for the pepper flakes as we're not good with spicy food. Delicious, and you can make them ahead of time and refrigerate until you're ready to bake them!

I make a variation of this dish using 1 pound of ground chicken instead of beef, half and half instead of heavy cream, and I add 1/4 c minced onion, and a clove of minced garlic.  Instead of marinara, I add a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes. This recipe is fantastic with red bell peppers.  Serve with a green salad.

Great recipe, it was a big hit! I added onion and garlic to the vegetable mixture, which I think added complexity to the flavor of bolognese sauce. After I sautéed vegetable mixture, pancetta, and beef, I deglazed the pan with red wine, then added marinara sauce. Also added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because my marinara was really thick. The recipe does not talk about salt/pepper, but I suggest flavoring the veggies with salt and pepper, and also add a sprinkle of salt after you add the ground beef, otherwise I think the sauce would end up pretty bland. Per the suggestion from the recipe, I used orzo instead of rice, which I thought was excellent! I thought the sauce had enough flavor before I added any cream, so I added just about 2 tbsp of half and half. I think that was enough to make the sauce creamy. Definitely making again! Thank you.

Wow! The sauce in this is amazing! I made some changes because I was working with whatever was left in my fridge. Brown rice instead of white (takes forever...don't try this unless you have lots of time!), added 1/4 of an onion and a clove of garlic to the veggies, used only bacon, no ground beef. I also used white wine (it was all I had...) and skipped the Parmesan in favour of some old cheddar sprinkled on top. I also added some corn, and blanched the green peppers as other reviewers recommended. Wonderful stuff!

This was delicious! It was my first time making a traditional stuffed pepper and I made some tweeks to fit my style of cooking! I used 1 cup of instant brown rice, one small onion and two large cloves of garlic chopped instead of the carrots and celery, a full pound of ground beef seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin and a few sprinkles of italian seasoning! When I added the marinara, red wine(chianti was delicious in the dish), and crushed red pepper I aslo added a can of rotel that I had drained.  I boiled the peppers for about 5-7 minutes to help the cooking process along. I stuffed the peppers sprinkled them with some parmesan put in the oven for 15-20 minutes then I topped them with a generous helping of shredded mozzarella and let that get melted and just a little toasty! About 10 minutes! Served it with a fresh salad on the side! And my boyfriend was very happy to have left over stuffing and a left over pepper too! We'll definetly be making thins again! It's our new favorite dish!!!

Fantasic recipe as is!  I like to prepare things ahead of time for quick and easy dinner, this freezes very well and takes no more time to make a second batch!  Also works great as a casserole when layered with peppers from the garden (sweet bananna, bell, even a mixture including some hot peppers), just freeze in advance and then thaw and bake as directed!  Wonderful way to use up small peppers from the garden!

These were fantastic!  I only gave four stars because of two important details that should be mentioned.  I made the filling exactly as written but fell short and had to make more to fill 6 peppers.  I used 3 red and 3 green peppers.  After I removed them from the oven they were so beautiful I had to snap a pic on my phone and I never do that.  The second thing I wanted to mention was the peppers were not done after 30 min so I had to cover with foil and bake an additional 20 min.  I usually read the reviews but didn't this time I didn't.  I will make again and agian.  Big hit with the husband too.

OMG this is AWESOME. My family loved it and so did I. The sauce alone is fabulous but in the peppers it is also great. Highly recommend.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could! The BEST recipe I've come across on allrecipes.com and I use this site every week! 
I converted this to the slow cooker, (sauteed some garlic with the celery and carrots) put the uncooked rice into the sauce and simmered 10 min. before spooning the mixture into the peppers. Even put a small chunk of mozzerella on top. I'm glad I took other reader's suggestion - the filling is only enough for 4 peppers, not 6... 
My husband is still talking about them. I'll be making this again and again and again! Thanks!

If there was the option for adding more stars, I'd do it for this recipe--delicious! I did heed the comments made by other reviewers about how much "sauce" the original recipe made and upped everything a touch (for example I used 3/4 # of ground beef and 1/2 c. heavy cream...). Also followed my instincts & other's suggestions to par boil the peppers first-good idea. I added a liberal sprinkle of shredded mozzarella on top with the parmesan just because that's what my mom always used to do. I also added in a couple cloves of minced garlic & about a 1/4 c. of finely diced onion because I thought I read it in the recipe (it's not) but it was delicious anyway. The only tiny compaint I might have is that the pancetta wasn't crispy--I figured it wouldn't be, but wanted to not mess with the recipe too much on the first time out. Next time I'm going to crisp it up first, remove it from the pan. Use the little bit of grease instead of olive oil to saute the vegetables & then stir it in just before stuffing the peppers. Paired it (like mom always did) with homemade mashed potatoes and we had one heck of a dinner!

I thought this was an interesting and unique recipe for stuffed peppers!  I loved it!  My husband, ahhhh, sort of only because he didn't really like the peppers, but he did like the stuffing.  I read the reviews and changed a few things.  I did blanche the peppers like other reviewers said.  I did not use celery because we are not fans, but replaced it with yellow onion which was delicious.  I also used about 1/3 lb of ground beef and a 1/4 lb ground sausage - which was really flavorful.  I also cooked the rice first in my rice steamer...I never have good luck with "uncooked" rice in a recipe.  It was fine, I just added it at the end and let it all simmer for 10 minutes.

I wanted a side dish and made polenta...yum!!  It was a perfect compliment to the peppers and it all tasted good mixed up together.

I did have left-over stuffing because I only stuffed 4 peppers so after a few days when the stuffing was all yummy and marinated, I added a jar of marinara sauce, cooked it up and served it over spaghetti...THAT my husband loved!!

I would actually make this again but as a creamy bolognese sause over pasta.

Wow, what a recipe!  In an effort to lower the calories/fat, I did alter some ingredients: ground turkey breast instead of ground beef, turkey bacon instead of pancetta, orzo instead of rice. I also omitted the Parmesan cheese but I kept the heavy cream.  I can't imagine this recipe tasting any better; it was fantastic. Thanks so much for this new staple meal for our household!

I am not a fan of stuffed peppers, however we had an abundance in the garden and decided to try this recipe.  What a surprise, this recipe was delicious.  I will certainly prepare it again and again.

Enjoyed by all. Only changes I made, I cooked the ground beef with bacon and sautéed onion, garlic and butter. I sautéed the carrots and celery in butter instead of oil.

After many more times preparing these, I have decided I like the recipe a lot, but I add garlic & onions with the carrots and celery, use brown rice, ground turkey or chicken. Blanch your peppers, especially if you're going to use whole peppers. I use this sauce to stuff everything from peppers to portabello caps, and eggplant. The best!
~These were amazing, the sauce hit the spot for me. I've been looking for a good stuffed pepper recipe for a long time and was overjoyed with these when I took the first bite. I used regular bacon because I had some on hand, and didn't halve the peppers, just stood them up and filled them. Added extra red pepper flakes, and a little big of dried bread crumbs to the Parmesan topping. Also didn't have carrots or celery, but they still turned out amazing. Prep time took a little longer than half an hour though!

Loved these!
If you like your bell peppers "very al dente", pack large bell peppers side by side in pan ... otherwise give 'em a little space to cook bell peppers through.
No carrots->double celery;
No Pancetta->replaced w/ beef;
Added jalepenos and Sciracha sauce to some.

This is a relatively easy and super recipe for stuffed peppers. I used ground turkey in place of the beef, and half & half instead of heavy cream, and they were delicious! I would suggest roasting the peppers for 5-10 minutes before adding the filling - we followed the suggetsed baking time and our peppers required a knife for cutting. However, the flavor was excellent.

These are still in the oven and I can already tell these are going to be good!!! I have never cooked stuffed bell peppers, but always wanted to.  I figured I'd use the ol' standby recipe, but I saw this and said heavy cream? Orzo pasta? awesome!! 
I had to use bacon instead of Pancetta (store didn't have any, bleh), and I sauteed onion and garlic.  I also added 1/2 cup red wine (LOVE cooking with wine). Finally, when I put the peppers in the dish, I surrounded them with crushed tomatoes.  I can't wait to eat!! mmm

This was such a delicious recipe!  I used my home grown red bell peppers and they were cooked to perfect tender crisp doneness.  My husband who usually does not like cooked peppers loved it as well.  They also made great left overs for lunch.  The only thing I changed was topped them with a slice of motzarella...I love cheese :)

AWESOME!! This has become one of our favorite things to make, my husband LOVES this. He raves about it every time. I do a few things differently:  season the beef (I use ground sirloin) salt, pepper, and worcestershire,  double the garlic, add onions, I cook the meat, onion, bell pepper (I chop up the extra bell pepper that you cut off the top and add that into it, not to waste anything :)) carrots, celery, and garlic all at once. I don't use ANY oil at all. use any spag sauce that you want. I have greek plain yogurt in my fridge always.. I use it in place of sour cream and heavy cream in everything I make, I skip the red wine, and the parm in the recipe. and blanch the peppers. I make this at least once a month and being so, I just take a bag of croutons and smash it until it is crummy and then add equal parts parmesan cheese and keep that in the fridge till I need it to top off the peppers. I cook them on a foil lined cookie sheet to make clean up easier. Thanks SO much for this!!!

Made these tonight and they are well worth the effort!  Used Orzo pasta instead of rice.  Also doubled most ingredients based on other reviews.  Can't get pancetta, but found marinara in a jar (Marzetti)that is flavored with onions and pancetta.  Also used 1/2 lb italian sausage.  Big hit at dinner, but leftovers will be even better!

This was delicious, per others suggestions, I minced 6 cloves of garlic (we love garlic) and added it to the celery/carrot saute. I used ground turkey instead of beef and added an extra 1.4 cup of wine. I also added a pinch of sea salt, garlic powder and black pepper for extra flavor.  This will be added to our menu rotation.

My husband and I love this dish! I made some changes to it based on what I had in my kitchen (didn't have heavy cream so I added some Alfredo sauce from a jar for that thick creamy flavor/texture) and I added more wine, maybe double. It turned out fantastic! This will become a regular at our dinner table.

Wow, really yummy!  I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars, because if I would have followed the amount of ingredients, my peppers would have only been 1/2 full.  And I didn't have huge peppers, just regular size.  I used 1 full cup of cooked rice, 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 pound italian sausage and I added onion and garlic.  The rest, I just doubled the ingredients and used homemade marinara.  Really, really yummy, my family chowed on this, thank you!

Holy Toledo these are GOOD! The filling is amazing! I don't think it is absolutely necessary to add the cream, it was just as good before I added it. I did follow the instructions of others and doubled the filling. I also blanched the bell peppers for about 6 minutes. They came out perfect! Next time I'll skip the heavy cream and have it over pasta. Delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I'm sure it would have been luscious as written, but since I'm not a huge fan of marinara sauce, in place of the marinara I added 1 T chopped fresh basil, 1 heaping t. chopped fresh oregano, 1 T chopped fresh parsley and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes, drained.  This recipe was simple and delicious!  Thanks for sharing KASM75!!!  Will definitely make this again!

I made something based on this recipe for dinner, I put in celery, onions, garlic and mushrooms for the veggies, and since I didn't have cream, I stirred in some cream cheese

Delicious! we all loved it!

OMG THIS WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!! I made this tonight and my boyfriend and I stuffed ourselves FULL!! I blanched the peppers like some reviewers said and it was PERFECT! I also left out the rice (we don't eat carbs) and it turned out SO WELL. The combo of the marinara, wine, cheese & cream are DIVINE!!!!!

This recipe for stuffed peppers is a striking departure away from your usual one. One thing that struck me odd about the recipe though was how little hamburger was called for to fill 6 peppers. I'm very glad that I bought 1 pound. I only had bacon on hand so I decided to use a bit more of that as well and everything turned out perfectly. I also added about 1/4 c. chopped onion to the carrot/ celery mixture. Using the orzo instead of rice was a great suggestion too - much better. I'm making this recipe part of my regular arsenal for sure. Enjoy you cooks out there!

these were great. I've always loved stuffed bell peppers. but this was a new twist for taste. yummy. one suggestion ... make your rice slightly on the drier side. the rice  soaks up the moisture out of the meat mixture  , so it's not too runny.I also put my peppers in the oven while I was making the meat to give them some extra cook time. I think the peppers would have been too "raw" if I hadn't . ;)

These peppers are a favorite in our house.  Because my husband tries to limit his beef intake I bought ground turkey to make these the second time.    I accidentally bought Italian seasoned ground turkey which, as it turned out, was a happy accident.  I then used plain tomato sauce which works because of the seasoning in the turkey, and brown rice.  I also increase the amount of the carrots and celery to at least 1/4 cup and add onions as well.  I also parboil the peppers, cut lengthwise, and using red, yellow and orange in addition to green makes for a colorful presentation.  

The beauty of this dish is that it lends itself to many modifications which is the hallmark of a great recipe.  Make piles of them as they are better as leftovers.

My family really enjoyed this.  I prefer to stuff my peppers while the meat is raw, so next time I might try cooking the bacon and vegetables together, letting it cool and putting it into the raw meat.  I like the texture of the meat better that way.  However, the flavors were great.

Very scrummy...but I did make a few adustments (added garlic, thyme, cream cheese instead of double cream and chicken stock instead of red wine). If you put a cup of boiling water into the bottom of the roasting dish it helps the peppers to steam cook and they turn out juicy... No basting required!

My husband doesn't usually like stuffed peppers and he LOVED these!  The only changes I made were to use quinoa instead of rice and to blanche the peppers as some other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fantastic and easy to make, everyone who ate it tonight thought it was excellent.  Taste is excellent very creamy and the pancetta is very nice when it's done.
I would point out that the ingredients will only fill 4 large peppers or probably 6 medium peppers.  I stretched the baking time to 50 minutes uncovered.

7.31.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/77194/bolognese-stuffed-bell-peppers/ ...Quite good!I read reviews & had to adjust things with what I had.Here's how it went:'Not perfect, but gardenfresh peppers.I cut chopped m'gold peppers;had about 1 1/4c.'Had a pound of ground beef so doubled -pretty much.Wow,the more I'm thinking about this the more changes I made BUT I still think I can review this because I didn't go wild,just nutty :o  I cooked four slices bacon then drained & set aside.Sauteed a half cup onion & 1.4c minced carrots in that same pot.No celery here.When tendercrisp or so,I added the ground beef I'd precooked.After that was heated,I added the bacon,3c homemade easymcpeasy (tom sauce with just spices added) marinara,1/2c red wine & only 1/2t crushed red pepper.'Brought that to a slight boil & then simmered about twenty minutes.Plopped in my leftover rice,2c.That thickened nicely;stirred in 1/2c heavy cream & 1/4c shredded parmesan;more shredded parmesan on top.Dinner is served! :)  For looks,not a beauty,but i made it to eat,not look at.Had a glass of that cheap wine I put in the sauce & dimmed the lights.Thanks for the recipe,KASM75!Next day,it's better.'Think over zoodles or noodles instead of rice.'Better the next day & have now renamed "Sloppy Giovannis" -serve on toasted bun with provolone.  :) ...When asked what he thought, E, 21, said it was his new second favorite food.  Surprise!  :D  Note:  Try with half the sauce - including wine & heavy cream, et

One of my absolute favorite go-to recipes. It's perfect as-is and it's also a good recipe to tweak for your needs. I've made with both ground beef and turkey and both are wonderful. I've skipped the heavy cream and still very good. I love this recipe too as a great way to use leftovers. I might use separate leftover rice and meat from different meals and doing stuffed bells is great way to reuse those leftovers and I always reference this recipe. Superb!

Fantastic! My husband LOVED these.  To make it a bit healthier, I used brown rice instead of white rice, and used 1/2 cup of carrots and 1/2 cup of celery.  He also likes spicy foods, so I used a premade spicy marinara sauce.  I finely chopped the pancetta, because I don't like big chunks of pancetta, but do like the flavour.  I blanched the peppers first (cooked about 2.5 min), and also added 1/4 cup breadcrumbs to the top before putting in the oven.  Tip: Make extra filling and eat it on its own the next day - will freeze and reheat very easily, and it is delicious even without the peppers!

Highly recommend if you like spicy meatsauce/filling.  My bell peppers ended up being spoiled, so I just made some pasta and poured this sauce over the top of it!  Making it again for my family, without the bell peppers and putting it on top of Rigitoni!

I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of using 1 lb. ground turkey instead of beef and orzo instead of rice (to use up a pkg).  I've tried lots of different ways of making bell peppers and this will now be my "go to" recipe.  Delicious.

YUM.  Not to cheesy and not too grainy- I don't really like rice in my peppers, these were perfect.  the flavor was so good.

Stayed with the recipe but used Quinoa instead of rice for added nutritional value.  Also, added some mushrooms. Mmmmm.

Delicious!!  Made a few variations. I blanched the peppers for 3 minutes, added more red pepper flakes and omitted the heavy cream. They came out perfect. The pancetta added an incredible flavour. Will be making again for sure.

I saw that I made this once before and only gave it 4 stars then...it must have been the beef and the wine that made the big difference because it was 5 star food this time!  I used our own ground beef and used a full pound even though I only made two large green bell peppers (cut in half for 4 servings) but followed the rest of the recipe.  Hubs loved it, I loved it and the last piece I gave to my 92 yo neighbor who is quite a food critic.  Looking forward to her feedback:)

This was SO good! I could have eaten the sauce/meat mixture before I even stuffed the peppers. I could see how the bolognese sauce could be excellent on pasta as well. I highly recommend this!

Wow. These were a hit at dinner! I made the rice in a rice cooker, and during the last 10 mins of cooking time I added about a cup the marinara sauce so the rice would soak up some of the flavor. I used about 1/4 cup of carrots and celery to make the dish a little more healthy. My boyfriend said that this will be a regular in our kitchen!

This was pretty tasty, i tried it with green, yellow and red bell peppers. I would like it to be more tomatoey in flavor, so i guess next time i'll add more sauce or eliminate the rice. I bit too much rice for my taste, maybe i'll try orzo like another recommended. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I did par-blanch the peppers for 3 minutes but I don't think it is necessary. Only used 3 pcs. bacon for lower cals and flavor.

These are the best stuffed bell peppers I have ever had! I did change up the recipe a little bit because I didn't have any red pepper flakes, I used some hot paprika instead. I also topped the bell peppers with some mozzarella before I baked it. They were fantastic!

Delicious!  I've never cooked made bolognese, and for a first-timer, this was so easy and turned out so great!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I only made a couple of changes, adding garlic and onion to my celery and carrot saute.  And because I don't drink alcohol, I use apple juice in place of the wine (a suggested substitution in one of my cookbooks).  This really was a great dish.  I'll be adding this to the regular dinner rotation!

I found the rice and beff amounts were not enough to complete the recipe.  I didn't cook the rice first and used 2 cans of tomato soup in place of the marinara sauce.  Added 1/2 teas. of each rosemary, nutmeg, fresh ground pepeper and dill.  In place of the heavy cream I just half and half.

Very tasty and easy for a beginner.  If you are not one for spicy taste you could cut back on the red pepper flakes.

This is an excellent, but extremely rich, recipe. I loved this, but my husband is Italian and he thought the flavor was too much. I suspect this was in my choice of julienne de bacon, which was extremely powerful. Next time, I'll try to leave this and the cream out to see if it is less rich.

Great Grilling recipe!  My husband and I stuffed as instructed, wrapped in foil and grilled for about 15-20 minutes.  I added minced garlic to cook with the celery and carrots, along with onion soup mix and Worcester sauce to the beef while it was cooking.  I had about 2 servings worth left over after all peppers were stuffed.  We both did not feel it necessary for the finishing touch of Parmesan cheese.  I will make this again!

Very delicious. Next time, I would half the bell pepper as pictured, instead of halving the bell pepper from top to bottom. It's more stable that way. My guess (and more than 5yrs experience cooking) is that using the same cooking time will be sufficient since the ground beef is already browned and fully-cooked on the stove.

While these were really good, my only complaint is the peppers didn't get done enough for my taste; I don't care for cripsy stuffed peppers.  The filling is fantastic--I did add some minced garlic.  When I make them again, and I will, I will parboil the peppers and add a bit more red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I served them with garlic toast and tossed salad.

This recipe was awesome!!  It tasted like something served in a fancy restaurant!  I only changed 2 things as others mentioned.  I sauteed the carrot and celery in 3 large cloves garlic (we love garlic) and I sprinkled the panko bread crumbs on top before baking....oh, and I was a little generous with the red pepper flakes.  My family loved it.  I can't wait to make this recipe for other people.  And, lastly, it was really easy to make and didn't make a big mess with lots of dirty pots and pans.  thanks for the great recipe!!

These stuffed peppers were fantastic. The recipe did not fill up 6 bell peppers so I doubled the recipe. My peppers may have been to big, I'm not sure. I made 2 small changes: first, I sauteed onion in with the carrot and celery and I used regular bacon because I did not have the pancetta bacon.

I also thought the amount of stuffing was appropriate for 4 peppers rather than 6, and we thought it tasted better in yellow and orange peppers than in green.

LOVE it and my husband couldn't get enough of it! I added minced garlic for the sauce and it came out perfect. I doubled the recipe so that I can use half for the stuffed bell-peppers (with rice) and the other half as pasta sauce (without rice) - two meals in one! This will be our family staple - thanks!

These were great!  I took suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the mix (ended up having about a cup too much), blanched the peppers and added extra red pepper flakes.  I used some 2% milk and flour instead of heavy cream and used a mix of brown rice and orzo instead of the white rice.  Exceptional!  (Oh, and I totally agree...no need to homemake sauce, the jar stuff's flavor was completely transformed by the pancetta, red pepper, etc.)

Well, after searching for a recipe that sounded good I settled on this one. What a good choice!! I doubled the recipe as I was making for a bunch of people - worked great. We are also heart-conscience and eat pretty low-fat around our house. So I used less oil, 98% fat-free ground turkey, reduced-fat parmesan and fat-free 1/2 & 1/2. It was spectacular! I think next time I will increase the red pepper flakes as I like the spicy side of Italian food. Try this one tonight!

This is good that's what i heard from my husband.Its just that i added a broth to the pan before baking to get the peppers more flavorful and not dry.

This was good. I added an onion and used pancetta as the bacon. Served with a green balsamic salad and garlic bread.

Delicious.  I did pre-cook the peppers for a few minutes in boiling water before stuffing and baking.  My family won't eat them unless they're soft.

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  Very good Bolognese sauce.  I doubled the sauce and used double orzo instead of rice...and had lots left over to go around the sides of the peppers in the casserold which is the way we always like it.  May make the sauce as a stand alone one night with pasta.  Great recipe.

This is such a great recipe.  The pancetta added a terrific flavor.  The spices melded beautifully.  I made two stuffed peppers and froze the remaining filling.  I can't wait to eat this again!

My boyfriend was impressed with all of the flavors! I used orzo vs. rice and suggest using red bell peppers. They are great as a meal or served with a salad. I will do this again real soon!

Very good.  Never heard of 'pancetta' so I used bacon.  Couldn't find marinara so used chunky tomato sauce.  Definitely recommend.

I made this tonight for dinner.  Followed the recipe as is.  It went straight to the disposal after we took the first bite-sadly.  Did not like the pancetta flavor.  Peppers were mushy and my husband disliked the textures.  Well, you win some and you lose some.

I only used 4 bell peppers. Used onion instead of celery.  Added large clove of garlic. Used 3 mild Italian sausage links instead of ground beef and bacon instead of pancetta. For the rice I used a precooked rice by VeeTee. It’s 9.9 oz and I used it all. I also precooked my peppers until they softened a little.  Rey good!

Delicious. I too found that the filling was only enough for 4 peppers (without filling them all the way). Fortunately I only happened to have 4 anyway. I even added more cooked rice to the filling than called for. Nonetheless, I would make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I made it as is except I did not have hamburger so I used hot Italian sausage that I had on hand instead.  Sooo good!  My only real complaint was that it was supposed to make enough for 6 peppers and there was only enough to fill 4 and that was a stretch.  My husband requested more rice in his, but I think having less rice was why I enjoyed it more than other stuffed pepper recipes I’ve tried.  And that sauce is amazing!  I think the only thing I would do different next time is I will double the recipe so we can have left overs!

I'm not sure anybody ate the pepper part but man that was some good meat filling and I only used hamburger meat. I did parboil the peppers and add onion and garlic as other suggested. I would love to use this as a sauce for some pasta.

This is so delicious and so easy to make! I used these beautiful striped peppers I found at Fred Meyer. I substituted the celery for onion. So amazing! I’m going to make a small batch to take to some clients since I know they will truly enjoy. I would recommend blanching(boiling) the peppers in a pot of water for 5 minutes before stuffing and baking. They turn out much more tender.

This recipe is my go to for stuffed peppers. My family absolutely loves them.  I've made a few tweaks over the years to suit my family's taste but these recipe is delicious! As others have commented I do blanch the peppers prior to stuffing and baking. I typically use whatever leftover grains, rice or quinoa and omit the celery in favor of onion and the tops of the peppers. They always turn out fabulous.

Excellent Recipe!  Easy and delicious.  Doubled the recipe and used ground turkey instead of beef and 3/4 cups of rice and omitted the red pepper flakes.  It was a hit!!!  Can"t wait to make it again :-)

These were very tasty even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I added some chopped onion and garlic, and  omitted the pancetta.  I topped the peppers with provolone because I wanted to use the  cheese up.  They made a delicious meal that everyone enjoyed.

This was a big hit w our whole family. I have since made it w leftover spaghetti in place of the rice as well. The first time I made it was for Halloween & carved little jack-o-lantern faces into the orange peppers & placed the stem tops back on after cooking. Turned out very cute!

Very tasty! I used 1.5x the wine (used a carmenere-Syrah blend) and let the mixture simmer a few minutes longer to give it all a richer taste, but otherwise followed the recipe. The peppers came out just firm and crunchy enough. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty. Although the recipe called for 6 peppers it makes enough to only fill 4 large peppers.

Fantastic! I did not add bacon; everything else was spot-on. I have made it a favorite!

Made it as specified by recipe, but used thick sliced bacon instead of pancetta. I also trimmed most of the fat from the bacon before frying it, to reduce fat some. Note to self, is to add more meat and rice. Might just be a guy thing though. Very tasty dish.

These were the best stuffed peppers I've ever had. I did leave out the wine and replaced it with more marinara, and also left out celery. I made a half recipe but kept certain items un-halved, like the rice and bacon. This is a truly flexible recipe that is foolproof as changing the proportions of the ingredients to taste or preference will not harm the taste.

Sauce is truly so good- could be served over pasta instead of combining with rice and stuffing into peppers. Great as written with the exception of peppers not cooking in short bake take. - will blanch peppers first next time. Will definitely keep in my rotation.

I enjoyed this dish, but made changes that probably changed the taste quite a bit.  I had no pancetta and my regular bacon is buried deep in my freezer, so I used two slices of peppered turkey bacon; because the holidays are just over, I had no red wine, so I used about 1/8 cup sherry (if I only had sherry again, I'd use at least 1/4 cup).  The turkey bacon added a unique flavor to it that I liked a lot.  Next time I'll try following the recipe more closely and see how I like it.

Goodbye old stuffed green pepper recipe! This is outstanding. Didn’t change a thing except baking for 35 minutes and peppers were done perfectly, no parboiling necessary. Great recipe, congrats!

I loved these and I'm not a great fan of bell peppers.  I used red ones though and together with the bolognese, it was a really good combination.  Cheesy, creamy goodness.

It was delicious! The only difference I made to the recipe was I boiled the bell peppers for 3 min before stuffing them to make sure they would cook all the way. It turned out awesome. The only thing I will do next time is to add cheese on the top the last ten minutes of cook time instead of the beginning, I didn’t like the hard crust top it created. Can’t wait to cook this again!

I picked some peppers from my garden and was looking for a good stuffed pepper recipe when I came across this one.  This recipe is so good!  My husband wouldn’t stop raving about these.  I did pre-cooked the peppers a little bit before stuffing them.  I put a little water in a glass baking dish, placed the peppers, cut side down, in the dish, covered them with plastic wrap, and microwaved them for 3 minutes.  They came out perfect!  I will be making these again and again.

Second time making this recipe.  My wife won't let me make stuffed peppers any other way now.  Only changes I made were to add garlic (as suggested by others) and minced onion with the vegetables.  This can be time consuming so I just made extra sauce to freeze then next time I only have to worry about the peppers and thawing out the sauce.  Certainly a keeper in my opinion.

Love love LOVED this recipe! The filling is just to die for. I substituted marinara sauce for salsa (because i realized after i got home that i didn't have any...) But i can't say if that made it better or worse All i know is it was delicious.All i suggest is boiling the bell peppers in salt water for a while before stuffing so they're soft after baking because for me the Peppers were still very firm!

I spent the summer getting 1 pepper here and 1 pepper there from my own garden and a neighbor's. I started blanching and freezing the peppers as they came in. As soon as I had enough to make stuffed peppers, I used this delicious recipe. Besides using blanched peppers, I used canned Italian flavored tomatoes. I sauteed an onion and some garlic and added them to the tomatoes. I also added some fresh snipped basil to the cooked rice, tomatoes cream and parmesan. A big change was for me to use RAW ground beef to the rice and tomato mixture. I then stuffed the peppers while they were still frozen so they held their shape. I cooked the stuffed peppers for 90 minutes to insure that the ground meat was cooked through. I also added mozzarella cheese to the top during the last 15 minutes of cooking. SUPER YUMMY!!

I decided to do like a lot of others and blanch the peppers for about 4 minutes.  After they bake time I thought they were perfectly cooked!  The filling was WONDERFUL, we just really loved these!  I doubled the filling and filled 5 bell peppers plus a zucchini and a portobello mushroom.  All was good!  I still had enough filling leftover for probably 4 or 5 more peppers, so I froze it for later :)  Very Yum!!!

These stuffed peppers where incredibly delicious! I've never been a fan of stuffed peppers, but this was so good that I made it twice in one week!  I did change the recipe a little - did not use celery, red wine or red pepper flakes, but everything else I used per the recipe.

Add a pound of Italian sausage, don't cut peppers in 1/2, just cut the tops off like the picture. Can also substitute orzo or cauliflower rice for the rice.

No complaints! Very good. Quite a bit of prep, however, I made extra to freeze and use later. It'll be easy and quick to pop out of the freezer and do stuffed peppers again, or, it would also be good in cabbage rolls. Yum!

Totally yummy twist on stuffed peppers. Definitely parboil the peppers for three minutes prior to stuffing. I tend to overstuff so this mixture only fills four peppers. Enjoy!

These were very tasty and delicious stuffed peppers!  Five stars on taste but found the recipe amounts to be off.  I did use very large peppers, so this filled six halves.  Next time I'll double the meats for a larger batch.  Also, used only about half of the sauce in the mix, and warmed some additional sauce to top the finished product.  Much less cooking time on the stove than recipe states, too. Just used enough cream to blush the sauce,  less there needed as well.   Half hour baking time yields crunchy peppers, so I would recommend par boiling the peppers first if you like them soft.  Hubs raved over this dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

I didn't have marinara in the cabinet, so I made my own. Used green bell pepper. Added crumbled bacon leftover from breakfast (just one piece), skipped the cream, pancetta, carrots and celery, and it came out great. I suggest keeping it in the oven longer, and maybe at a lower temperature for all except for last 15 min to get the cheese melted just right - not too toasty.

Quite good.  I'm not personally a fan of stuffed peppers but my mom is so I decided to give this a try.
I followed the directions to almost a T, other than I added minced garlic and onion to the veggie mixture and I probably put in too much ground beef (closer to a lb than a 1/2 lb) .
I think my biggest downfall was that there were a lot of ingredients  (veggies, Pancetta) that didn't seem to stand out to me which makes me question the necessity of including them, adding to extra cost and calories.  I'm sure I will make this again because my.mom.loved them and I liked it very much except I'm very full now:)

I think my quest for a stuffed pepper recipe has ended!  A few modifications - didn't use pancetta - upped the amount of ground beef instead; didn't use the heavy cream;used onion instead of celery and added minced garlic; only used 1 cup of marinara (because that's all I had).

I made this for both my family and my daycare kiddos (just the filling for the daycare kids).  The children ate it up as did my family.  I made it as is though I think that instead of the Parmesan sprinkled on top, next time I might do Monterey Jack.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. Sooooo good. I do add a bit of garlic and onion to the carrots and celery, and sub Italian sausage for the ground beef and only use 4 peppers, which I boil for about 3 minutes before stuffing.

This recipe always turns out fantastic and the whole family enjoys it. I make a simpler version of this meal though. I only use sausage for the meat sauce and I add onions and garlic in the carrot mixture. This is a repeat in my household.

These were pretty good and a nice change to the regular stuffed peppers.  I did think it needed some additional flavor though for our liking.  I did add in some extra seasonings and chopped onion and garlic to saute with the sauce mixture.  I also used orzo in place of the rice.  I par boiled the peppers for 4 min. to make sure they would cook in the 30 min.   The filling filled 4 med/large peppers.  I also topped with lots of mozzarella cheese and added panko bread crumbs with the parmesan to give a nice crunch.  I would next time add the cheese on top when there is 20 min. left of cook time, instead of in the beginning.  Overall it was a nice change up and made a nice meal, but I think we still prefer regular stuffed peppers over this one.  Thank you for the recipe!

The has become one of our go-to dinner favorites! As other reviews suggested we add a bit red pepper flakes, garlic, salt & pepper and panko bread crumbs for the topping. It also works well with ground turkey.

Being that this meal was made for a person that can't have salt and spices. I seasoned the meat "turkey" with Mrs. Dash no salt seasonings, cut up a clove of garlic, minced celery, with left over organic chicken broth and let it simmer. She inhaled it! Over all this meal is fast healthy and delicious.

I prepared it for dinner I made it in the morning let it sit all afternoon in the refrigerator then I cooked it for 30 minutes it's an awesome recipe just like moms
 The only thing I did different was cut the sausage into  pieces to cook a little quicker that way and it keeps the peppers more crisp.

I made some changes:  used Italian chicken sausage instead of ground beef, 1 package of Uncle Ben's microwave brown rice, red peppers are the best to use,  and I like a spicer sauce like Arrabbiata sauce.  It is delicious!!

First I never use the celery (because I rarely have it on hand). I only use red peppers and just cut off the tops and take out the seeds and insides. I also boil the peppers for three minutes and then take out and set to the side as I prepare the rest of the meal. I always use smoky bacon. I chop it and fry it in the pan and keep some of the drippings to sauté the beef, onion, garlic, and carrots in and add the rest of the ingredients exactly as stated in the recipe. I always use the same no sugar added tomato basil spaghetti sauce. I always add some panko breadcrumbs to the Parmesan cheese and top the peppers with that. Then drizzle some olive oil over the top and bake. The flavours in this recipe are outstanding. The smokey, creamy, mixed with a hint of sweetness from the tomato sauce is just out of this world. Ten star recipe. Thank you! I've made it many times.

I used  1 pound of Italian sausage instead of the other two meats. I also added 1/3 t. each of garlic powder, cayenne pepper and curry.   OUTSTANDING!  
Paired with a spinach salad with dried cherries, almonds, blue cheese crumbles and a vinegrette dressing.

Definitely needs more spice. 
I added onion and garlic to the mix, and it helped, but I like my food with some kick, so I'll be adding more red pepper flakes next time. 
For those that said this does not fill 6 halved peppers, they're right. I used 1 lb of ground beef and a bit more rice and that filled all 6. I am going to use half beef half Italian sausage to give it some additional punch next time.
Finally, blanching the peppers is definitely something I'll do again.

This is my new favorite dinner recipe. The filling is absolutely delicious. I only changed a few things just for personal taste. Onion instead of celery, added 1 minced garlic clove to veggies, uncured bacon instead of pancetta, and I cut the tops off the pepper instead of halving it. I also doubled the recipe and was able to get 9 peppers out of it. My advice is just tweak to how you like it (i.e I don't like celery) and just taste it as you go.

First time adding a comment, this was a disappointment.This smelled wonderful while making. Will not be making again however. All the ingredients seem to be fighting over "taste me, no taste me!". VERY TIME consuming.

So delicious and a big hit with the family.  The kids even ate the peppers for once! I used Orzo instead of rice and added minced onion and garlic to the celery and carrots.  IMO a true Bolognese needs to cook quite a bit longer to get the meat to be super tender and fall apart, so I also added a bit more marinara than the recipe calls for and allowed the sauce to simmer on low for about three hours.  I would also say that the wine should be added first and allowed to reduce a bit before adding the marinara.  These are just a few things that I picked up from my hubby's Nona (very Italian Grandma :)) but I do think that the added time and ingredients make a difference.  I also added Panko and parsley to the parmesean topping.  That was my favorite part, cheesy, crunchy and delicious!

We did orzo instead of rice.  We LOVE garlic and added to taste.  Seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  Added 1/4 cup diced sweet onion to the vegetable mix.  I would add more carrot and celery than the recipe calls for.  And we did add bread crumbs to the parm cheese.  We grated our own parm cheese also.  Much richer taste!  6 peppers are too many, we only did 4 with this recipe without adjusting our measurements.  My husband HATED stuffed peppers until I made this!

This recipe was very good.  Such a nice change from regular stuffed peppers.  My husband could not get enough of these!  Definitely boil peppers for 2-3 minutes before stuffing!  Great recipe!

Very flavorful!! The carrots added a nice crunch. Very tasty your way, however, I have since replaced hamburger with Italian sausage and topped it with smoked Gouda. And the service kicker.....A splash of balsamic vinegar just before service.

This recipe was alright in my opinion.  I used bacon instead of pancetta and it really didn't add anything to the dish.  If you use it you definitely should cook it separately so that it crisps a bit.  It did not cook to a crispy state when cooked with ground beef as the recipe tells you to do.  The filling was good, however it really wan't all that flavorful.  I even added onion, pepper, and garlic to spice it up a bit.  The peppers do not really soften much so they have a good bit of crunch still after baking in the oven.  It seems like this recipe needs a bit of liquid to help the peppers cook a little bit more.  This recipe calls for 1/2 pound of ground beef and I did not read that carefully and used a hefty pound of ground beef.  There is no way you could fill 6 peppers with only 1/2 pound of ground beef.

Beautiful recipes, as-is, but to make it healthier, I use ground turkey, brown rice, and 1% milk.  Very low in WW points.

This was so tastey. I changed it up just a bit to be more like a Bolognese I would make. I added a little garlic and onion to the mix and used crumbled Italian sausage instead of bacon and used just enough cream till it looked good. Served with garlic bread and salad and had a wonderful meal.

wow. we loved these so much! I used home grown bell peppers (which were small) so i had a ton of left over filling, which taste awesome by itself. I didnt have ground beef on hand, so i used ground sausage, i made it with the bacon and just used regular pasta sauce. we didnt have red wine or heavy cream, i just used 2% milk. turned out nice and thick anyway.

Great recipe! Only modification I would make is using sausage instead of bacon. And don't be afraid to use a little more meat than the recipe calls for. I used about 20 or 25% more and had just enough filling for the peppers.

These were THE BEST stuffed peppers I have ever had. I did notice in the reviews that the recipe as written for a serving of 6 did not make enough stuffing for 6 peppers. I made the 6 servings and was able to fill 5 VERY LARGE peppers whole. I used 2 times the cheese in the mixture and topped with potato chip crumbs. My husband HATES peppers so I blanched them before cooking and he ate 1/2 of a pepper!!!! He said comming from someone who hates peppers that they should have been blanched longer than 5 mins. I feared they would become to mushy so I stuck with the 5 min Blanching. I will be recomending this to everyone!!!!

I love this recipe.  I added a clove of garlic, used onion in place of the celery and added a bit of seasoned panko crumbs to the parmesan cheese sprinkled on the top - it gives the peppers a nice crunch out of the oven.  I chopped the top off the peppers and stuffed them that way (instead of lengthwise) and found that this makes enough filling for 4 bell peppers.  Delicious stuff!

Excellent!  This isn't the quickest recipe around, but it sure paid off with an excellent meal!  I used pork instead of beef and added a little extra red pepper because we like spicy food and it turned out great!  The bacon also added a really nice flavor.

This was absolutely delicious. My little sister doesn't care for meat and hates bacon and she loved it. The only 2 things I didn't use were the red pepper flakes and the carrots because I didn't have any. I will definitely be making these again. Thank you so much for this recipe my family really enjoyed it.

We bought good peppers from a local place with the intention of making stuffed peppers; I liked the ones I had growing up, but I knew my husband would not.  These, with the addition of the cream and parmesan cheese, were just what we needed.  I used italian turkey sausage instead of the beef and the pancetta--that's what I had, and I honestly didn't want the pancetta or bacon in there (it sounded weird to me). I halved the rice and used 5 peppers.  It was just enough. Thanks!

I've made these a few times and they always turn out fantastic. My favorite version is to substitute Italian sausage for the ground beef and bacon - yum!

This recipe is amazing!  I did do a few things different though.  I blanced the peppers as others suggested.  I used mild ground sausage instead of the pancetta/bacon and I used chicken broth instead of the red wine.  I also added onions because I like onions.  :)  After that I followed the recipe to the letter.  So tasty!!

These are so good! I love the stuffing mixture. I did have some changes though based on what I had at home and what I like. No celery, no wine. Brown rice instead of white, turkey bacon instead of pancetta. Added some chopped onion and zuchinni with the carrots and seasoned the beef mixture with salt and pepper while cooking. Still came out great!

I am not sure if it was because my meat was too lean or what the problem was but I followed the recipe and found the meat mixture too dry (not creamy at all) while the peppers still hard. None of us were crazy about this dish so I won't be making it again.

We thought this was a great recipe! The filling is very good just by itself. Like some other reviewers I added Panko bread crumbs but found that it really didn't contribute to the dish. We will definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe.  I am not coordinated in the kitchen, but this was quick, easy, and filling.  Not to mention delicious!  I added a little extra olive oil to the ones we kept as leftovers - they were great the next few days, too!

This is fantastic!  MUCH better than alternative recipes found on the site.  Used onion instead of celery, and topped it with shredded mozzarella (instead of parm) 1/2 way through the baking time.  Great flavors, just the right amount of spice!  Already have requests to make again!

Have made these a couple times. I have added some of my own ingredients in the mixture to have more flavor to it. Would definitely make this allot more because it gives you so many choices on what to put inside the bell pepper

A good twist on traditional peppers.  I cooked peppers for 3 minutes as others suggested. I added onion to the celery/carrot mixture. I also added panko breadcrumbs to the top for crunch.

This is the first recipe that actually thrilled me enough to write a review. It was very good. The only thing that I did different (after reading other reviews) was blanch the peppers and added minced garlic and minced onion in when cooking the carrots and celery. This was a great recipe! Thanks!

I didn't have carrots or celery so I substituted it with whatever vegetables were at hand. Also I rubbed each of the peppers in a spice mixture of paprika and salt for some extra flavour.

They were the best stuffed peppers I have ever tasted. My husband loved them and says this recipe had the best flavor of all I have tried so far. I did take some variations from other reviewers as well as not cooking the meat before stuffing and they turned out MOIST! Love them!

Pretty good recipe: I added garlic and onion for more flavor and used red, yellow, and green bell peppers for more variety. The next time I make this, though, I will use more spices as it didn't have enough punch for me.

SOOOO good!  I've made stuffed peppers before, but never as good as these were. Maybe it was the pancetta that made the difference.  The only change I'd make next time would be to double the recipe.

I had to change the amounts on a couple of things here and there and I added some spices. I also used red bell peppers because they're sweeter and topped them with shredded Italian cheese blend and put them under the broiler to brown the cheese up at the end. They were fantastic! Thanks!

quick, easy & delicious. I had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand and because i love garlic. I already had some cooked couscous, that i used instead of rice. I had no celery, so I added some red onion. I had no pancetta, so I used 2 slices bacon. I also added 2 diced italian mushrooms when i added the sauce and I added some dried oregano and basil, salt & pepper & garlic powder. I had no heavy cream, so I added about a 1/4c shredded colby jack. It was delicious. It's just my husband and I so I only stuffed 1 bellpepper (2 halves) and we had a scoop of bolognese on the side, and I still have a jar of bolognese left over to serve over pasta. Next time I will add fresh garlic :) thanks!

Great recipe!  Just make sure you don't use regular smoked bacon, like I did the first time, as the smoked flavor is way too overpowering.  Added sea salt and fresh ground pepper along with the red pepper flakes

I made this with onions instead of celery (Husband isn't a fan), and I blanched the seeded peppers in boiling water for about five minutes to soften. The meat mix was a tad bland so I threw in some onion powder and Italian herb blend. It turned out pretty good but I wouldn't bother with the heavy cream next time. Thanks!

Made a few minor changes like added egg, bread crumbs, garlic, and chili pepper instead of red pepper flakes, but it was sooo good!

Really good.  My husband, 14-month son and I both ate it up!  I skipped the red wine b/c we were out.  I added garlic and onion with the carrots and celery.  This is a keeper.  Filled 4 big peppers wonderfully.

Sooooo good! I followed the recipe exactly other than pre-boiling the peppers so that they would be soft. It was delicious.

Turned out wonderful!!  I steamed the peppers first before the baking to soften them up some.  My boyfriend and I devoured it, I can't wait to make them for guests sometime.  I felt like it really spiced the the old style stuffed bell peppers.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I just made it last night, and I only had a few tweaks.  First, I left the peppers whole, and just cut off the caps, then I blanched them in boiling water for 2 minutes.  For the filling, I added about 1/4 cup of onions in with the carrots and celery to saute.  I also added some oregano and cinnamon to the sauce, and I was very generous with the parmesan cheese (more like 1/3 cup in the filling and 1/2 cup on top).  They turned out beautifully--definitely a do-again.

I had never had stuffed bell peppers but always wanted to try them.  This was very good.  Even my 4 year old daughter loved them. She asked me to make them every night.

This recipbe was awesome. I used arborio rice and substituted ground turkey for the beef and fat free half and half for the heavy cream to make it a little more healthy. I used about 1 1/3 lbs of turkey because other users had said they could not fill 6 peppers and I was still only able to stuff 4 peppers. I can only imagine how good they would been with real beef and heavy cream.

Wow!  My partner and I thought these were the best stuffed peppers we'd ever eaten.  I didn't have any pancetta, so I used bacon instead.  Also, I substituted onions for the carrots and celery.  As others reported, it was only enough to fill four green peppers, but that was fine with us!  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!!

I made these last night with fresh peppers from the garden.  Surely not low-fat, but this recipe is a winner!  Very tasty, not the usual coated in tomato-ey stuff.  I'm not real big on stuffed peppers and really liked this.

This recipe is fabulous!  I only cook for two, so we had leftover filling, and my husband even just ate that, no peppers needed!  Really delicious and I can't wait to make it again for company.

Wonderful! My husband and I loved this and would just eat the orzo and sauce and add a salad if we didn't want to bother stuffing the peppers.
