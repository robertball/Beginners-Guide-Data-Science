Good "down home" country cooking! Hubby loved it.  I made it according to the recipe (using ham hocks) but I added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes. Very filling and would be great for a cold winter day.  Next time, however, I'll add the cabbage during the last 1/2 hr. of cooking since the cabbage was mush after cooking almost 2 hrs.

I love cabbage and I love beans.  I never thought to put them together.  Yummy.  Changes I made-- omitted the butter and hamhocks, added 2 chicken bouillon cubes instead, and my can of tomatoes was a tad spicy.  I did add the sausage as directed but I think it would have been fine without it.  So next time I will do it without the sausage.  Oh, and instead of soaking the beans over night I followed the directions on the bag and quick soaked them in an hour.

This is an awesome meal.  I left out the hocks and cooked the beans with a small amt of bacon grease, left out the butter.  Cooked the sausage and drained as much grease as possible! Used some  home canned tomatoes and oh was it delish!!  Thanks BDuke this one is a keeper!

I gave this 5 STARS(*****)Count them, 5. I am a big fan of soups. This is delicious. Didn't use Ham Hocks, none  on hand. Only thing I added was a little onion powder, and some tomato juice.       Thanks BDukes

This turned out much better than expected.  I didn't use a ham hock but subbed 6 cups of chicken stock for water.  I ended up cooking the beans and sausage in the broth/water for about 2 hours before adding the other ingredients.  The cabbage was added in about the last 45 minutes.  The sausage I had was a hot product so the soup had some heat but we enjoyed it.  Thanks!

I left out the cabbage and served over yellow rice - a family favorite.

Yummy flavor.  I omitted the ham hocks, added 2 chicken boullion cubes like another reviewer did, only added about 1 T of butter and added the cabbage during the last half hour of cooking. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Very tasty pot of beans.  My limas turned to mush, however.  Next time, I won't just set the timer for 90 min. and not check them.  I am sure 60 min. would have left some texture.  I used bacon instead of ham hock and added mustard greens instead of cabbage, because that's what I had.  Will make again.  Love a good bean recipe.

I put 3 stars because I shoulda read the reviews and put the cabbage in more towards the end because it did turn to mush. I used navy beans instead of cabbage just because I don't like lima beans and my mom always used navy. I didn't have ham hocks but I used spicy sausage. I'll make this again for sure just not put the cabbage in until more towards the end.
