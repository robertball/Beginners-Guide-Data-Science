Flavors just didn't mesh well for me. I normally like citrus salsa but not this. Had a serving with dinner and couldn't finish the rest.

We didn't care for this. There was too much salsa for it to be a salad but not enough ingredients for it to be a salsa. We tried eating it with a fork and with chips and didn't care for it either way.

I made this for a potluck, and it was great.  Roasted some frozen corn, and only used less than a half cup of salsa verde (La Costena brand found in Toronto nofrills).

I completely disagree with the other reviewers.  I made this recipe with Trader Joe's Salsa Verde and used fresh corn on the cob.  Served it to 6 adult guests and they couldn't eat enough of it.  Delicious and fresh tasting.

If you don't have salsa substitute 1 tomato cut up, 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt & pepper, 1/8 tsp each ground cumin and chilli powder.  Add cut up avocado just before serving for a change.  Enjoy!

I served this salad on a bed of lettuce with a chipolte sauced chicken on top as a dinner salad and we just loved it.  My BF said he'd be happy with it as a side or served with tortilla chips.  The only things I changed was to only use 1/2 the salsa and dried cilantro (we don't like it fresh).
