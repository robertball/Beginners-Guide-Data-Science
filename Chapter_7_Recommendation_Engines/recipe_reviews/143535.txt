I made these as cookie bars (uploaded a photo) using pouch sugar cookie mix made according to directions spreadable marshmallow creme Nestle baking morsels and crushed graham crackers. I spread the cookie mix in bottom of 9X13 baking dish and cooked in oven (dough should be cooled for a bit in fridge before spreading); spray spatula with non-stick spray for easier spreading. Once cooked sugar cookie base was cooled I put mallow creme in microwave for about 15 seconds to soften for easier spreading then sprinkled with chocolate morsels. I put the dish back in oven on WARM to just soften the morsels for spreading then topped with graham cracker crumbs. Passed the taste test with my twin boys!
