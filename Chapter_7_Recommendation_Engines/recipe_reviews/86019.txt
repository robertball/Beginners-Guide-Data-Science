This was excellent!  I did make some, minor changes.  We are usually trying to cut back on carbs and fat thus I wanted to avoid the breaded coating and frying.  I used boneless chicken breasts that had been marinating two days in Good Season's Italian salad dressing mix.  I cut in small pieces and sauteed in a little olive oil until cooked through.  I also used a lower carb, high protein pasta, Barilla.  They didn't have bow ties so I used rotini.  We all loved this and though I had increased the amount served to 8 for my family of 5 and a guest, there wasn't a bit left.

This recipe was wonderful, although I changed the vegetables to fresh tomatoes and zucchini from my garden.  Also added homemade greek salad dressing instead of store bought.  Great recipe in salad dresings link works wonderfully!

Great recipe.  I crumbled Feta cheese to match the Greek dressing and it was great.  Try it if you like Feta!

I enjoyed this recipe as it was unique and very different, my friend, not so much. I tried to follow the recipe exactly but there were some issues: my store was out of red bell peppers so I used yellow and green instead, I forgot to get fresh mushrooms so I used some sliced canned mushrooms from the pantry, I was short on pasta so I used only half the amount called for. I look forward to trying this recipe again and next time will follow it exactly. The greek dressing I used was "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" that can be found on this site. I am only giving this recipe four stars because the directions for breading the chicken was difficult (using a ziplock bag is/was much easier) and because it did not have a recipe for greek dressing.

Great recipe but I had to make some adjustments to use what was on hand.  Didn't have a "Greek Dressing"; used Hidden Valley Ranch Italian from mix using virgin olive oil. Also did not bread chicken but used seasoned frozen chicken breast which made the cook time quicker. Red onions gave a nice added color.

This recipe was amazing. As a beginning cook, my only concern is that it was hard to do all three parts of the recipe (veggies, chicken, and pasta) without one of them getting cold (my pasta actually stuck together because i made it too al dente and left it out). Besides that, the recipe was perfect. I added extra grape tomatoes instead of mushrooms, and the recipe says just the right amount of dressing to add. Eat it cold the next day - it's still great!

Edit: I've made this recipe maybe ten times now, and I've found that the easiest way to time it is to boil the water while preparing the chicken and vegetables, then put the vegetables on to be cooked, followed shortly by the chicken (the pasta goes in once the other two are almost done). I use extra oil for the chicken so that the pieces don't blacken, just pouring extra in as needed. If you cook it the next day, I advise putting a bit extra dressing in; otherwise, the pasta can get crispy. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe almost to the letter, and it was delicious! I was glad that I coated the chicken in bread crumbs (something I don't usually do). It added texture and flavor.

Followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the garlic and mushrooms. This was excellent. I did not have trouble with the process had my bowls side by side near the stove. egg water=bread crumbs=frying pan. Thank you!

I absolutely love this recipe! I use pearl cous cous instead of pasta and I use sun dried tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes. Other than that, I followed it exactly. My 4 year old and I enjoy it every time!

Delicious! Next time though, I'll add more peppers, onion, and mushrooms, since when they saute they get so much smaller. Took about 20 min longer to make than the recipe states, and that was with help cutting and cooking chicken, so plan accordingly.

This was really a great meal when I was looking for a different healthy way to cook with chicken.  I used Girards Greek Feta Vinargarette and finely shredded parmesan for the topping. I cooked the bow ties thoroughly (not al dente) and I cooked everything at once, but let the chicken and veggies simmer in their separate frying pans while waiting for the pasta to finish cooking.

I followed other review advice to adapt the recipe by sauteing the chicken in olive oil. I also used quinoa pasta to make it an even healthier dish. I added zucchini and tossed in cut up fresh tomatoes at the end instead of grape tomatoes since they're in season. Also did the feta instead of parmesan for an added zip. Delish!

This recipe was super easy to make!  I used the whole yellow, green, and red pepper because I didn't want to throw them away, but it still turned out really good!  I let a few people at work try it and they all asked for the recipe.  Really easy and really good.  Thanks!!

The chicken was fantastic! I recommend mixing the dressing in before adding the chicken, so the chicken stays crispy and the dressing coats the pasta and vegetables evenly.

I cooked this for my fiance and needless to say she was very impressed. All the flavors melded together nicely and to add an even more meditirranean feel I added some crumbled feta. As suggested, I had cold leftovers for lunch the next day and it was awesome! Great add.

This recipe was very delicious!  I was a bit hesitant since I usually like my pasta with sauce but the Greek Dressing brought the whole dish together.  To simplify the recipe even further, I baked the chicken breast using Shake and Bake instead of the Italian bread crumbs... I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

This was a nice change from the normal chicken pasta dishes. It will definitely be a regular for my family.  Frying the chicken first adds much flavor.  I also tried adding canned dices tomatoes which worked well.

This is a fantastic dish - and one that is made weekly in my house.  It's a great alternative to the typical chicken/pasta/cream sauce dishes out there. Any leftovers will reheat beautifully - though they don't last long in my house!

This was a pretty decent, quick dinner. Neither my husband or I enjoyed the grape tomatoes with it. I think they could have been better cooked, or if the whole thing was cold. It had potential, but if I make it again, I will probably try and tweak a few things to get a bit more flavor out of it.

It was good, and fairly easy to make, but a bit too bland for my taste.  Maybe it would have been better with the feta cheese someone else suggested?  I did add olives and thought they gave it a little more kick...

Too much pasta with too little sauce, in our opinion.  We added some soy sauce at the table to give it more kick.

I had never made a pasta dinner quite like this one. It was like a hot pasta salad...it was delicious! Instead of dipping the chicken I just put it in a large bag and shook it up. I followed the recipes exactly as written. I made the Greek dressing from a recipe here on this site. I also used a variety of mushrooms. Next time I will try it feta cheese.

I hate to be a downer, but i wasn't impressed with this recipe. It was rather labor intensive and in the end, quite bland despite the high fat content. I added some tobasco, salt and olives to heat it up a bit. On the good side, it keeps well for a number of days which makes it a good carry-along dish for work.

This was wonderful!  It is essentially hot chicken pasta salad.  I have made similar recipes served cold but the flavors come alive when served hot.  I made it a few days ago and my husband has asked for it for dinner again already!  Thanks!

I used peanut oil instead of olive and my chicken was meat cut off a thigh and drumstick - but it turned out delicious.  I used the Greek dressing on the site here and it was very good.  I included sauteed zucchini in mine and chunked Romas for the top.  Family said would eat again - which is a little bit unusual for a "veggie-heavy" meal!

This was easy and wonderful!  I couldn't find Greek dressing at the store, so I substituted Ceasar, which worked out great.  My husband won't eat tomatoes if they aren't cooked, so I cooked the grape tomatoes with the other vegetables.  Great recipe!  It made a HUGE amount, so we will be eating it for days!

Very tasty & easy.  Did not bread chicken, still turned out great.  Followed recipe except for that, but omitted tomatoes as we didn't have any.  Great fast dinner with a salad.

I followed the instructions except for leaving out the mushrooms since I don't like them.  The recipe was wonderful.  They were great cold the next day as left overs too.  So easy and tasty...we'll be making this again!

Dinner was great. Leftovers were wonderful, reheated great. Added fresh tomato/parm cheese on reheating. Next time will try sauting chic without breading.

This was fun!  I was soooo tempted to add crumbled feta, but I made the recipe as written.  We both enjoyed this.  Not a lot of work either.  I think we'll try the leftovers cold.
