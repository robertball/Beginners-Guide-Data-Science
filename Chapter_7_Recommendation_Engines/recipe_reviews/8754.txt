Excellent flavor.  I find that oven cooked chicken is so often dry.  So I cooked one pound boneless thighs (that's what I had--will try with breasts next time) in a skillet, about 6 minutes per side and spooned the apricot glaze over them during the last 2 minutes.  Made the glaze with 1/4 cup preserves, 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar, and 2 tsp brown sugar.  (Will probably add 1/4 tsp Dijon next time.)  Removed them to a serving plate and poured the pan juices over.  Very good and moist.  And the total time was about 15 minutes.

Super easy, but my husband and I found this tasteless. The cooking time is too long for boneless chicken.

Excellent, I added 4 cloves of garlic and some fresh ground pepper and it was great. We will have this recipe again. We served it with long grain brown rice and fresh steamed aspargus, I would serve this to company

When I made this, I sprinkled the chicken breasts with store-bought "citrus pepper" seasoning (also containing garlic powder), which added some flavour. I also added some white wine and a bit of water to the sauce. I only baked it for maybe 30-35 minutes and served it with roasted potatoes, squash and salad. My friend and my sister raved about it and there was none left over!

This recipie was so good!  I have had it for only a few weeks and I've made it twice.  I don't usually even like anything sweet with my meat but this is too good to pass up.  The apricot sauce that it cooks in is also delicious over rice so you have the whole meal in just two dishes. Hope you give it a try and enjoy it.

I was a little skeptical at first about making this because of the vinegar in the recipe.  Well, I tried it and LOVED IT! My husband and I thought it turned out fantastic, had a nice sweet and sour flavor to it.  This is definitely something I'll make again.

This recipe was remarkably easy to make and tasted great.  It goes really well with a salad or even potatoes if you prefer.  The juices tasted great poured over the salad to add flavour as a dressing.  Overall, it was much better than i expected.

Chicken was very dry. Would have liked the sauce to have more taste...too bland for us.

It was pretty good, and required so little prep work!  I halved the recipe, and used 4 chicken thighs.  My sauce was runny, so I added some corn starch to thicken it up, and then I repoured it over the chicken.

My husband I thought this was very good.  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and they turned out very moist.  The only problem I had with the recipe was that the sauce was kind of thin so I would like to come up with a way to thicken it some.  I served it with rice and used some of the sauce to flavor the rice.  Will make again, possibly as a stir-fry.

I used bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (because they were on sale) and placed some of the sauce under the skin and some on top of the chicken.  Turned out pretty good.  I would use the cut of meat called for in the recipe next time since the sauce became somewhat diluted by the juices of the chicken.  Overall, you just can't beat this for a QUICK, tasty meal.

My family loved this recipe!  I planned to use rice w/ it but ran out. Instead, I used 2 pkgs. of instant Ramen noodles (plain)& put chicken/glaze on top of them.  It turned out great!!

After reading the review about the chicken being dry I decided to start with the basics and develop a salad recipe.  I used the sauce as a base and used balsamic vinegar and minced garlic (two minced cloves) along with the marmalade and brown sugar.  This was the best salad I have ever had, bar none.

I started by by cutting the chicken in strips and marinating it for 15 minutes.  Then I grilled the strips on the large round George Foreman indoor electric grill.  As soon as the chicken was close to being done, I then sauteed onions, mushrooms, red pepper and garlic until done.  I made up a beautiful romaine salad with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, celery, etc.  I put the salads on individual dinner plates for a whole meal salad.  I sprinkled a little italian dressing and then added the hot chicken and vegetables on top.  I sprinkled with fresh parsley.  What a meal.  Please try this, you will never forget it.

Wow! My husband loved this and I have been giving the recipe to others at work who love how simple and great this is. I adjusted a little... I only used 4 breasts, apple cider vinegar instead of distilled white, and I ended up with at 9x9 pan.

This recipe was easy to make, but turned out dry, and not very flavorful. Luckily, I cooked a few delicious side which made up for it.

Just cooked it up - grabbed 3 pieces of chicken fillet instead of chicken breast, boneless skinless chicken fillet from my local butcher, measured out some brown sugar and the vinegar and it came up really good :)  Might want to add a little bit more vinegar/sugar to make sure it marinates well, and also any remaining sauce in the tray, pour over steamed rice and the chicken pieces. (recommended to cook at home, always better, and not steamed is better than fried rice for this one imho)

Also I used dried apricot pieces instead - burn them a little bit and let them cook for a little bit longer, they come up rather nice and taste well with the chicken.  :)

Too long a cooking time made the chicken a bit stringy and the sauce was watery - should be cooked without a lid.  Not interested in making it again.

This sounded really good, but when I took the foil off I found a lot of water that did not evaporate later on. Better to bake or broil the chicken, make up the sauce, and pour it on before serving.

okay, but nothing i'd make again. I cooked it less than the alloted time, but it was still a little dry and bland.

Has good potential, nice flavour, but cooking time was too long, and mine ended up dry. It's worth a second try though. I also added some chili flakes.

Was a great success when I had a some friends over for dinner.  I did not have white vinegar so I just used some water to break up the consistency of the preserves and added a pinch of salt and dash of pepper to the marinade.  I added in the canned apricots during the last 15 minutes of baking.

Ok, maybe I really shouldn't be rating this because I really dont like when people rate things and they made a bunch of changes...and I made a big one, I didn't use apricot preserves I used peach...it was all I had on hand.  It was still a great chicken, I just thought there was a bit too much sugar.  I think it would have been that way regardless of the preserves being apricot or peach.  Thanks for a great recipe, I will make this again...with apricot.

This dish is so good and so easy to prepare.  It is one I plan to make again and again.  The apricot preserves break down with the juices from the chicken to make a wonderful sauce that would be great over rice.  I even left the chicken in the oven a little too long, and it still came out great with wonderful flavor.  It's mildly sweet, not overpowering.  And don't worry, you won't taste the vinegar.  I saw others were afraid to use distilled white vinegar, but I followed the recipe as stated, and it came out great!  You have to plan ahead for the chicken to bake in the over for an hour, but the prep time is super quick.  I plan to use the left over chicken on a bed of romaine with dried apricots, walnuts, feta and a vinaigrette.  yummy!

Cooking time was shorter than recipe stated.  After the chicken finished cooking, I took the juices and syrup in the baking dish and boiled it down to make a sauce for the chicken. Pretty much tasted like sweet and sour chicken. It wasn't spectacular, but slightly above average. The ease of the recipe was great.

WEll, let me just preface by saying that we love sweet and savory combinations and my husband added a bit more brown sugar than suggested, but I still found it way too sweet. It reminded me a lot of chinese style sesame chicken, so next time I think I will just add a bit more vinegar and use balsamic, and turn it into a healthy version of the chinese favorite

Great chicken. I followed the recipe except I used seedless raspberry jam because that's what I had. I diced it up and served it on a tossed salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing. So good. I think next time I'll try it with peach preserves or jam. I bet that would be great too.

I made this for my Husband, put with rice, and steamed asparagus! I also added 4 cloves of garlic & freshly ground pepper which gave the chicken a good flavor! I am a beginner cook, this recipe was so easy even I made it AMAZING, which was also a confidence builder ;D

This is a good recipe with a very delicate flavor to the sauce. I used 4 breasts instead of 6, apple cider vinegar and sprinkled "Mrs Dash Spicy"(R) over the breasts before adding the sauce. During the last 10 minutes I rebasted the breasts with the hot sauce and threw a handful of slivered almonds on top of each breast. I served it on buttered brown rice and added Mrs Dash Table Blend. I think it will be even better reheated when the sauce is a little thicker.

I add a dash of hot sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little extra something something.. it could have use a little more.. good flavor, but I was looking for a little extra.  Over all it came out perfect.. In my house they call it a make again.

very good recipe nut it needs alot of tweeking. I'm too new at cooking to know what it needs but I did use peach preserve instead and I did listen to the other reviews and used some crushed red pepper but i don't think I used enough of it. Will use more next time I cook this.

This has been a family favorite for years.  My husband requests it almost everyweek.  My only suggestions is to use Peach Preserves and add a little red pepper flakes to give it some heat.

This recipe was great...after I changed it a bit. I used two chicken breasts, about 1/3 cup of apricot preserves, a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, 2 tbsp of brown sugar, about 1/3 cup of white wine, some chopped up dried cranberries and a tiny bit of minced garlic. I mixed the sauce together in a casserole dish, tossed in the chicken, and cooked it for about 45 minutes with the lid on the entire time. I served it over brown rice with roasted potatoes and corn...fantastic and super easy--I wish I had leftovers today!!

Totally freaking love this recipe. The only minor change I made was to add 1/4 cup white wine to the sauce and sprinkled the chicken with Lemon Pepper seasoning before putting the sauce on top. This is one of my new favorites!

I cut this recipe in half, and the cooking time was still appropriate. The chicken came out moist, however, it tasted rather bland. I will not be making this particular recipe again.

Very good recipe.  Really simple and delicious.  I thought the cooking time was a little long.  The chicken came out slightly dry - I'll just shortent the cooking time next time and make it.  I'll definately make it again.

Great!  I added a bit of sea salt and a good amount of ground black pepper.  The pepper was a wonderful contrast to the apricot.  I used apple cider vinegar and regular apricot jam and cooked chunks of chicken in a skillet with the sauce.  I didn't have enough time to bake it, but will try it that way next time.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Delicious, the whole family enjoyed. I personally will use a bit more brown sugar next time, maybe 2 tbsp instead of just one. Thanks for the recipe!

I added a Tbl of chopped chipotle in adobo to the sauce.  This gave it some needed kick.

I used two ripe apricots and used the blender to liquify them and then used 12 chicken thighs (which were huge)  instead of the breast halves. This dish was delicious and so easy to make. I hade to bake a little longer than the 50 minutes in the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful! It's incredibly easy and delish! I added another tbsp of vinegar and cut the brown sugar down to 1 tsp. I also added a dash of tarragon which gave it a slight anise flavor. I will certainly make this again!
