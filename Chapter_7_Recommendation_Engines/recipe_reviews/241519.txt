This is the same exact way I make my banana lumpia. Thanks for posting this recipe. Banana lumpia is a favorite here in Hawaii!

Followed recipe except added a sprinkle of cinnamon and drizzled a tiny bit of honey.  Served hot with vanilla bean sorbet - delish!  Great for company...

Great easy to follow recipe.  I used apple bananas and cut in half since they are smaller than regular bananas.  Made a bunch and put in the freezer.  Perfect for potlucks

I made these but instead of banana I used  ripe plantain and some pineapple cubes. When in the Philippines my wife added jack fruit instead of pineapple. They are so good.

I made this recipe as written and it was great!! You have to buy the lumpia (spring roll) wrappers from an Asian store for this to work really well.
