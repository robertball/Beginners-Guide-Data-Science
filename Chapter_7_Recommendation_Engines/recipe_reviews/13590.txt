I cut this recipe in half to ten servings. I had to make a couple substitutions only because I was limited in ingredients. I used pecans instead of walnuts, light brown sugar and instead of coconut milk, I used equal amounts regular milk with a teaspoon of coconut extract. I baked my muffins at 350 for exactly 20 minutes. Though they turned out moist and delicately spiced, these were a little too sweet. The coconut flavor with the pumpkin was different but in a good way.

The first time I made this, it was good, but seemed to lack flavor.  So the second  time, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and it really made a difference.  This bread comes out very moist and both vegans and non-vegans have loved it!

I made many changes, but this turned into a fabulous (and healthier) bread:

-subbed 2 c. whole wheat flour
-subbed 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 oil
-used light coconut milk
-omitted white sugar!  (Trust me--this bread is so sweet, you won't even notice)
-increased spices by adding a little extra cinnamon, 1/2 t. cloves, and 1/2 t. ginger
-omitted flake coconut.
-increased nuts to 1 1/2 c.

With all these changes, this was the most satisfying pumpkin bread I’ve ever eaten, vegan or not.  Baking time was exact—they were perfect after 1 hr. 15 min.  My kids loved it, and I will make it over and over again! I'll also try this recipe for banana and zucchini bread...

i was so glad to find a vegan pumpkin bread recipe, especially one with such a creative alternative! the coconut is a great touch and it really does come out very moist. when i have a loaf to some vegan-skeptic family members they begged for more! i did substitue half a cup of applesauce for some of the oil (.5 cup oil + .5 cup appleasuce) and it turned out just as great and even more healthy : )

Wonderful bread. I made a pumpkin bread recipe the other day and incorporated from that 1/2 tsp. Allspice and 1/4 tsp. cloves to give this one a little more kick. Smelled wonderful baking and tasted great too. Mad a spread with cream cheese, honey and cinnamon to spread on this.

As I only have one loaf pan and didn't want to bother with halving the recipe, I can say it turned out beautifully when done in a 9x13 baking dish.  An excellent recipe for vegan families (just substitute the white and brown sugar with rapadura and a little molasses) or family members with dairy allergies.

This is a very good vegan pumpkin bread.  I have had trouble converting my pumpkin-based baked goods to vegan recipes that will still please my husband, but these did the trick. They have an ultra-creamy texture reminiscent of coconut milk ice cream, and a nice fall flavor with no artificial ick aftertaste like so many vegan products. 

The changes I made: used half a cup of oil and increased pumpkin to three cups. Severely cut down sugar: half a cup of dark brown and about a third of a cup of white, but I did add bakers chocolate chunks instead of nuts. There is no need for all that oil or sugar! Doubled the spices and added a heaping tsp of powdered Ginger as well as 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Overall result very good, will make again!

I was skeptical initially because there are no eggs in this recipe, but this bread is wonderful.  Each time I've made it I ommitted the walnuts and shreddd coconut and it still turned out GREAT.  Incredibly moist - the best I've had.

I have used this recipe many times for several years now.  It's THE BEST Pumpkin Bread.  I do make several changes.  I simply use one whole can of pumpkin rather than measuring the two cups.  I also omit the flaked coconut.  Most importantly I loosely cover the loaves with aluminum foil one hour into baking as they tend to burn on top.

I first made this bread about three years ago for Thanksgiving as my SIL couldn't have any dairy or eggs.  I'm so glad I tried it.  Its become my favorite.  I also add extra spices and some cloves and substitute a third of the oil for applesauce.  I've never added the shredded coconut as most of the family doesnt like it.  I like to make a glaze with some of the leftover coconut milk.  I take the coconut milk and mix it up with powdered sugar and maple flavoring and drizzle it all over the top while the bread is still warm so it seeps into the bread.  I then like to freeze the bread for at least a day.  Once thawed it seems to be extra moist.  I've got a couple of pumpkin bread recipes and I always come back to making this one, give it a try :-)

update: I have to give this 5 stars...I'm making yet again, this time made muffins and sprinkled the tops with raw sugar.  The texture is perfect!  I did half oil, half applesauce this time and they came out very moist but not too dense.  And, as an added bonus, enjoy eating the batter, its delicious and no raw egg to worry about!

Delicious!! Made this twice already, the first time I made the recipe (but without walnuts because I am allergic) and it was amazing. The second time I made it, I altered the recipe a bit and it came out just as good but  a lot healthier. I halved both sugars, doubled both spices, and put in 1/2 cup extra pumpkin instead of half of the oil. It was even moister and a lot healthier!

This was very tasty. The first pumpkin bread I've ever made. I baked it so I could send it as a treat for a vegan friend who's going on a long car trip.   I halved the recipe and used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices.   I added 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract and a teaspoon or two of molassas for added flavor since some reviews said it was only so so. I omitted the nuts and coconut shreds because I didn't have any on hand at the time. I'd like to try this again with dried apricots, cherries or cranberries and pecans.  I used about half the required amount of sugar and it turned out fine, plenty sweet enough but not too sweet.   Since it was only 1 loaf it was ready a bit earlier than the recipe indicated. I covered it with foil and took it out about 15 minutes early.   I bet this could make a lovely Harvest French Toast for a special autumn brunch.

I made this recipe into 12 jumbo size muffin.  I also changed a few ingredients.  Cutted the oil by half and substitute 1/2 cup apple butter and 1/2 cup oil.  Omitted coconut milk for 1 cup enriched soymilk.  Also, omitted coconut flake and substitute it with 1 cup raisins.  I didn't have any nuts on hand so i substitute the nuts with 1 1/2 cup of multi-grain (oats, barely, and rye).  Last but not least, I instead of what the recipe called for i used 2 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves.  The pumpkin muffin came out moist and delicious, even the next day it was still moist.  I would definitely make this again, but this time with nuts and dried cranberries.

I made this recipe into 12 jumbo size muffin.  I also changed a few ingredients.  Cutted the oil by half and substitute 1/2 cup apple butter and 1/2 cup oil.  Omitted coconut milk for 1 cup enriched soymilk.  Also, omitted coconut flake and substitute it with 1 cup raisins.  I didn't have any nuts on hand so i substitute the nuts with 1 1/2 cup of multi-grain (oats, barely, and rye).  Last but not least, I instead of what the recipe called for i used 2 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves.  The pumpkin muffin came out moist and delicious, even the next day it was still moist.  I would definitely make this again, but this time with nuts and dried cranberries.

I halved this recipe, added 1/2 tsp of cloves, and substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil called for, then baked it for 45 minutes in a 9x9 pan. It is absolutely scrumptious and could pass for cake!   I bet this would be even more special with a simple vanilla glaze. Yum.

Soooo good!! I went ahead and added 2 eggs and didn't add the nuts or flaked coconut. They are so moist. I'm going to add mini loaves to Christmas goodie baskets and hand them out to neighbors.

This is a fabulous recipe to which I only made a few minor revisions based on the recommendation of others.  I, too, substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil for the 1 cup of oil.  I also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to the mix.  The best part was that I used organic shredded coconut from Whole Foods and it is finely shredded and unsweetened and the perfect addition to the recipe.  I think it would change the consistency to use regular shredded coconut so if you can find unsweetened shredded coconut, use it.  The bread smelled wonderful baking and I made one loaf and one 8x8 pan and only needed to bake them for 50 minutes.  When I made 6 mini-loaves, I baked them for 30 minutes.  I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and was shocked when a picky eater of the kid variety bypassed everything on the table and went straight for the pumpkin bread and even ate two slices.  My kids love it and I have even made small muffins to tuck into lunches.  YUMMY!

This is truly a gourmet bakery quality recipe and it's as Super Moist as it claims and gets better the second day if you wrap it well in cellophane.  I add 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves for an extra kick and using light coconut milk gives the same yummy results.  No need for the flaked coconut and you can use the walnuts as is.  I think toasting it gives it a slightly bitter taste to desserts.  We finish a loaf a day in our house and it's great for giving since it stays moist so long!

I had 3 pumpkins I had to do something with my son wanted to make pumpkin bread.  So I looked up a recipe.  This one sounded very easy.  It was absolutely delicious.  I took a loaf to work and it was gone in 30 mins.  I got a lot of request for the recipe.  I will make this again and again.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla. It kicked it up a notch.

If you are looking a moist pumpkin bread recipe, this is NOT it.  I Made this yesterday and I especially made it because of the title of the recipe...super moist pumpkin bread.  I'm still trying to find what part of the loaf is moist.  Followed the recipe to a T...I wasted my money here on this recipe.  Had to give it the one star...had no choice.

Great bread! Had no coconut milk or milk substitute so was forced to use plain old water and it turned out fine! Also sub'd half of oil for applesauce. Muffins turned out good as well.

Turned out great.  Made a couple minor substitutions - was short on oil, so I used half applesauce, half oil.  Had just a half cup of coconut milk; used some extra flaked coconut instead.  Also added extra cloves and allspice, per others' suggestions.  Definitely a keeper - and not just for a "vegan" recipe - I'm not vegan; it's a great recipe by any standard.

My family loves this bread. I had to make a couple of changes due to what i had available at the time. I used light brown sugar instead of dark, and only used 1/3 cup of white sugar. I did not have the spices but i did have pumpkin pie spice and so i used 2 rounded tsp.. I also did not have any coconut but i always have coconut milk and it did call for that yeah! No nuts though. This was the most delicious sweet bread I have ever tasted. It oddly enough has a bit of a chocolate hint to the taste. I can't make it often, the stuff becomes addicting! Love it!

this bread is delicious! very moist and flavorful. i made a few small changes by using all brown sugar and leaving out the flaked coconut. i also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon allspice because i had them on hand, but i'm sure the recipe is fine as is. i will definitely make this again. i recommend it!

this bread is delicious! very moist and flavorful. i made a few small changes by using all brown sugar and leaving out the flaked coconut. i also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon allspice because i had them on hand, but i'm sure the recipe is fine as is. i will definitely make this again. i recommend it!

I used 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1/2 cup of canola oil & I added a tsp of vanilla. Forgot to decrease my sugar some for my sweetened coconut so I cut back on the coconut. I wish I had put it through teh food processor to shred it up more. I used pecans for walnuts because that's what I had & I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & nutmeg. I made 4 half loafs & 2 tiny loafs (for my grandsons). I baked @ 325 for 30 minutes on the mini-loaves & baked the half loaves for 50. This was very good! Because this stays so moist I am mailing a loaf to my Dad...it should still be perfect when it reaches him a couple of days from now.  Thansk Kevin!

This was wonderful!  I made it as muffins instead of as bread and added a simple cream cheese filling.  Also, I didn't use walnuts because I didn't have any.  Try this recipe; you will never look for another pumpkin bread recipe again!

I made this bread for work & it was a hit.  I have tried it with both sweetened coconut & unsweetened. Both have worked fine. When I used the sweetened coconut, I used 1/3 cup of coconut milk & 1/3 of coconut water insteadd to compnesate for the sweetness of the coconut.

I used cashews instead of walnuts and it turned out great. I ate practically an entire loaf on my own!

I am rating it 5* because I made this without the walnuts and coconut (my own fault) and have to say it definitely needs those.  Without it, the bread is still good, but it lacks texture, and some may find it even too moist or gummy.  

I, like others, would definitely recommend using much more spices (up to twice as much as the recipe calls for), or you might find it too bland/simple.

Made the recipe with 2 cups of whole wheat flour, half of the sugars and no nuts. I decided to make muffins because they're easier to send in lunches! Smells awesome.. They look good.. be back in 5 to tell you how they taste! Mmmm they're good! They could use more spices or sugar but really good.. :D

Really great recipe with a few method of preparation changes. I placed the brown sugar, white sugar, pumpkin, oil, and milk together in one bowl and the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in another. Slowly I added the flour to the liquid folding until combined but not over mixed. Then I gently folded in the coconut and walnuts. I also Used cake flour to make these more like cupcakes. I separated the batter into 24 cupcakes and caked for 23 minutes at 350. I touch the tops to determine the doneness of the cake. Sticking with the vegan theme I attempted to make shortening butter cream but I couldn't take the sickly sweet tang that came with it so I took 2 1/2 cups sugar and 2/3  cups water to a boil to make caramel and dipped the cupcakes in the caramel. Came out great everyone loved them.

This pumpkin bread is AMAZING! I have never baked anything so moist and delicious...EVER!!! The flavors were perfect and it was easy to do! I followed the recipe as is and reduced the sugar as the author had suggested because I used sweetened coconut flakes. So good!

Perfect vegan dessert. I made the following changes and it was incredible: maple syrup instead of brown sugar (same amount), a bit more salt (1 tsp), and I stuck approximately 15 cloves into the cake before sticking it in the oven. It adds an incredible aroma to the kitchen and spice to the cake. Without the changes, I think it would have tasted too chalky.

We loved this bread.  I added raisins to one loaf...not so good, but ok.  We didn't like the coconut in it that much either, but it was ok.  The bread-bread part of it was excellent!  Very moist and yummy!

I omitted the nuts and coconut, halved the recipe, added 1/2 tsp each of cloves and cardamom, and made muffins instead of loaves and they came out amazing! I made them for my vegan friend and all the rest of my classmates and EVERYONE loved them!

I quartered the recipe (I have a tiny toaster oven) and subbed soy nog for the coconut milk, oatmeal instead of coconut, and used fresh roasted buttercup squash. It made 6 dense and very moist muffins, probably because there is no baking powder. Still delicious though.

Finally, an outstanding vegan recipe that absolutely no one would know is vegan. I made the following changes:
Used one 9 inch pan, used 2 cups of packed dark brown sugar and no white sugar, used 1 cup of natural apple sauce and no oil, added lots of spice: heaping amounts of allspice, ground cloves, cinammon, and nutmeg plus about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla. I forgot to put the walnuts in so I roasted them and sprinkled them on top. I also omitted the coconut flakes and used a low fat coconut milk. This is an excellent recipe and probably would still be perfect if you made it as listed.

Used one 9 inch pan, used 2 cups of packed dark brown sugar and no white sugar, used 1 cup of natural apple sauce and no oil, added lots of spice: heaping amounts of allspice, ground cloves, cinammon, and nutmeg plus about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla. I forgot to put the walnuts in so I roasted them and sprinkled them on top. I also omitted the coconut flakes and used a low fat coconut milk. This is an excellent recipe and probably would still be perfect if you made it as listed.

I added a little clove & 5-spice and substituted 4 oz applesauce for half the oil.  Next time, I will leave out the coconut and add raisens. I baked the entire batch in a silicone bundt pan and it turned out very moist and tastey!

Great bread. Mine was done in 55 minutes, so watch carefully! I added more spices and raisins.

This looked and tasted like a brick from my driveway. I was making it for friends and had to throw away. Maybe eggs would have helped.

AMAZING loaf! So moist. 
I used pumpkin seeds, as this was all I had. AMAZING!
Freezes well. 
Will definitely make again.

This recipe makes a dense, substantial bread. I didn't realize it until after, but its also vegan , and handy for that reason. The cook time given was too long- I took it out early because it was starting brown up too much. We enjoyed the nuts and coconut addition. Thank you!

After skimming thru other reviews, I cut back on the oil and sweeteners. I replaced all the sugar with 1 cup of date honey, used just half a cup of oil and skipped the coconut milk  (since I was using a liquid sweetener, I  didn't want to use too much liquid). I also added a bit more spice (1 tsp each cardamom and ginger). Came out moist, fluffy and just a touch of sweetness to set off the pumpkin and spices. Yum!

I added chocolate chips, vanilla and a cinnamon glaze. I didn't add the nuts. It was wonderful and huge and fed a ton of people. 10/10 will make again.

I made this gluten free by substituting Better Batter GF flour. It is a dense loaf. I halved the amount of regular sugar and used unsweetened coconut flakes. I used pecans instead of walnuts. It also only baked for 1 hour and 2 minutes. It turned out soooooo tasty! The nutmeg flavor was a tad strong for me so next time I will use a little less. I will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation.

It was very good. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and 2 cups of organic cane sugar instead of the recommended 2 and 2/3 combined. It was still plenty sweet. Oh, and I used 3tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the recommended spices. We like a lot of spice, and not too much sugar. 
Waiting on second batch now. :)smells so good.

It was okay.  I added pumpkin pie spice hoping it would ease the nutmeg flavor.  The spices were a little too overbearing for me, but for others it may have been just fine.  My bread was too dense for my preference, but moist.  I may alter the recipe the next time, that is if I get ambitious again.

I followed the recipe except no nuts (food allergy) and I used a half cup of unsweetened applesauce and half cup of oil.  It was very moist, but something is missing.  Not as sweet as I hoped for, but it's not bad either.

I over cooked it, my oven cooked it alot faster than the time called for. But it was excellent. Has a wonderful flavor and I love the shredded coconut in the bread and the walnuts are a must. Will definitely be making this one again.

Wow this is really good! I've never baked with coconut milk before, and I loved the consistency of it. I had homemade pumpkin butter that I used in place of the canned pumpkin, so I adjusted the sugar & spices a little bit, and I added cardamom. I used half applesauce for the oil and omitted the nuts and coconut. Very moist bread and just delicious.

I halve this recipe and make 12 muffins, but only cook for about 45 minutes. These are friggin AWESOME muffins! They are moist, but not at all "gummy" like vegan muffins can tend to be - trust me, no one will ever EVER guess these are vegan! They are simply delicious!! The best!!! Even my sister-in-law, a pastry chef, was raving about them and said I should sell them! Thank you!
