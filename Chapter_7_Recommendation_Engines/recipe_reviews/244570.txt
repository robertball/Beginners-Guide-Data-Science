Made as written except that I pulled the onion and bell out as the shrimp went in and sauteed them in a skillet until they got good and caramelized for that extra depth of flavor. This is a perfect meal for hot summer nights!

I was looking for an exciting new salad recipe - this is not it.  I thought the flavor was very "mundane" for the work that went into the preparation.

We are fond of shrimp salads so I thought I would give this recipe a try. I made it as written. We both thought the lack of flavor was disappointing. I probably will not make this recipe again.

Refreshing salad for a hot summer's day. It was very flavorful and the shrimp were great. I love Shrimp salads. I had a few extra veggies so I tossed them in too. Hubby loved it too.
