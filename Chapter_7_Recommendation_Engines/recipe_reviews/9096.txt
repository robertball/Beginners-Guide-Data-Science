Tastes just like you think it would. The recipe was a bit like corn chowder instead of corn pudding. Mine didn't set up very well and was a bit runny but the next day the left overs had just the right amount of "body" to it. The taste was very good and both my wife and I had seconds. We don't care for bell peppers so I used a red onions instad. That added color and taste. I suggest you melt the butter in the microwave before trying to mix it with the corn in step two. I will use a little more flour next time to give it a little more body. The beaten egg whites are what makes this so special. Thanks for the recipe Erika!

This is great.  My entire family loved it.  I changed a couple of things though.  I used 1 can of cream corn and 1 can of corn niblets.  It using these it helped to thicken more.  I also pushed the layer of crust that forms on the top down at 20, 40 and 60 mins of cooking time and in my oven the cooking time needed to be increased to 90 minutes.

This is one of the easiest and quickest recipes I have made.  It took about 5 min. to prepare and 20 min. to cook in the microwave.  It tasted just as good as any baked corn pudding recipe baked in the oven.

This was absolutely horrid. It came out a soggy wet mess, it was more like corn soup than pudding. I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure what went wrong. Sorry, but I won't be using this recipe again.

It tasted great but the consistancy was a little strange.  I think it's from stirring the crust in every 20 minutes.  Good overall.

This is the best recipe for corn pudding I've make so far.  It came our perfectly.  You must do the pushing down steps in order for the casserole firm up and cook all the way through.

This was a great side dish to my Christmas dinner. I made a few changes though. I used 1 cream corn and 1 corn niblets. I did not push down the crust that formed at all and increased the baking time to 100 minutes this allowed it to set up sort of like a casserole. My kids loved it! Thank you so much for sharing it!

Was very good, left out red bell pepper and used frozen corn instead. I microwaved the corn and mashed it with a fork.
