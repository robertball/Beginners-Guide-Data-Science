karbol is right, this is a light and refreshing salad with nice presentation, and breaks down well nutritionally.  The flavor of this salad is mellow/mild, so don't forget that little splash of rice vinegar just before serving, as I think it's important to the overall taste of this recipe. The recipe calls for hot chile peppers, so I used red pepper flakes and will increase the amount in the future.  Although not by most people's calendar, it's already summer in Florida, has been for a while, and this will be a perfect main course summer salad served over a bed of crisp salad greens. Thanks for sharing.

Great, light recipe with little effort! I added fresh pineapple because we had some on hand; husband thought the pineapple was essential, I think it was a nice addition, but not necessary.  I'm thinking about putting it on a bed of romaine lettuce for lunch. Perfect recipe as-is, wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for the fantastic recipe! Will be a staple over the summer, for sure!

i made this salad for a Hawaiian themed dinner. I tripled the recipe but did not add the chilies. Took the suggestion of others and added red peppers and pineapple for color... it made a beautiful presentation.
the vinegar was key to the flavor. next time I will add the chilies as it needed a bit of kick. and there will be a next time!??
