I substituted frozen yogurt for the ice cream, soy milk for regular milk, Truvia in place of sugar and pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. My pumpkin was frozen so I omitted the ice. It came out extremely thick, I imagine it was due to my pumpkin being frozen, so I wound up adding about 1/4 cup more soy milk. It was good.

I was so excited about making this...I love anything pumpkin...but this wasn’t as yummy as I had hoped. I don’t know why.
