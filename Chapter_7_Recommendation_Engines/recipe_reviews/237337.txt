I followed the recipe almost exact, except I only had 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 5 cups.  It was pretty easy to make.  I liked the consistency of the soup with the beaten eggs added, but I felt like the soup as a whole was missing something.  I probably should have added another potato to make it more hearty, and I should've made my own chicken broth (I had used the store bought kind).  The dill flavor came out really light.  This soup would be perfect for those looking for a light soup.

Tasty. I was skeptical about how well the egg, lemon, and dill would work here, but I was really pleasantly surprised.
