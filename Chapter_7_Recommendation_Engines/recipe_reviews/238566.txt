Glad I found this recipe while looking for a way to use up summer squash - when I started it, I thought it was a side dish, then realized it was a dessert.  I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup, added extra squash.  Loved it - with that amount of sugar, it could be dessert or a side.  Nice and low fat, sweet and has a veggie - perfect!  For a side, I'm going to cut back the sugar next time to 3/4 cup and add a little more salt.  I made this in a 9 x 13 pan, so it was very thin - may try it in a smaller casserole to see how it goes.  Thanks so much for this great recipe - definitely a keeper.

We liked this - a good way to used up some more of those summer squashes.  This was moist, flavorful and wonderfully lemony . . . and somewhat  healthy.  That makes it a keeper for me.

I was looking for a way to use up some squash that was given to us. No one in our house likes squash, so it had to be undetectable and this fit the bill. I made a few minor adjustments, most notably substituting vanilla for the lemon (realized I didn't have any lemon when I was already in the process of making it). We all liked it, my eight year old loved it! I would have loved it with lemon, as it was, it was too bland. 
I don't usually rate recipes, but since there were only two other reviews, I thought I'd pipe in. It was certainly worth making, but make sure you have the lemon!

Thank you MegaWoman for giving me such a tasty way to use up the yellow squash from my garden!  These smelled so good baking that I had to eat mine warm.  It was almost like a very soft gooey cake. I processed the squash in the food processor instead of mashing it and it worked well.  I accidentally forgot to add the lemon extract but I still really liked this.  I pressed some fresh berries into the top while it was still warm.  
The flavor reminded me of cornbread.  Can't wait to try it with the lemon next time.

This was the strangest and probably the worst dish I have made from the allrecipes.com website.  It is not at all the way it is described. The texture is very gummy, the taste is weird (squash and lemon?), and the appearance is not appetizing. Don't waste your time. If you want a lemon bar, make a lemon bar. If you want a squash casserole, make a squash casserole. This is NOT a good substitute for EITHER!

Not bad at all! I was looking for a lemon recipe when this one popped up. I had so much crookneck squash to use up so it was perfect. Definitely make in a smaller pan. I replaced the sugar with stevia (and reduced the amount to 1 cup). Next time I will make it in an even smaller pan (9x9 was too big) or double ingredients. Very chewy but delicious!

I scooped out seeds, chopped & steamed unpeeled squash. I mixed sugar( I used only 1cup sugar), milk and egg together. Food processed steamed squash with butter, added sugar mix. Next the flour & dash of vanilla.  It turned out well, next time I’ll use a smaller pan for thicker servings.

I've made this several times now. The first time, according to the recipe. My whole family loved it, and my husband had no clue it was full of squash! We just told him they were lemon bars (for the record, he loves his veggies and was pleasantly surprised).  I've also made it with vanilla and chocolate chips (good), and hope to try with vanilla, cocoa powder and chocolate chips! I pureed the squash in the food processor, so it has a great texture.

Loved it! I did however use 1/4 C. vanilla greek yogurt and 1/4 C. apple juice instead of milk. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 C.

This was one of those dishes where it was strange, and the texture was weird but the flavor kinda good you just keep eating it anyway. I would describe this as tasting like a very dense lemon bread pudding or a very dense, too moist lemon cake but was a tad bit of a too gummy texture for me. I also pulsed my squash in the food processor and got around 2-1/2 cups semi-pureed squash. Also added 2 Tablespoons more butter and used a 9×9 pan.  Ok flavor, unappealing texture. I took a bite of it cold and it was not good, could only eat it warm.

Honestly, I didn't like the taste or texture of this one bit, but everyone at the BBQ I brought it to raved about it and fought over taking the leftovers home!! I used coconut oil instead of butter.

I halved the sugar too and used a food processor to mash the squash, once cooled we sprinkled them with some powdered sugar and they looked and tasted great :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe!
