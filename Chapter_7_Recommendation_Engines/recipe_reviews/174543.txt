I am Indian, and made this for my American hubby who loves butter chicken.  I made it with chicken breasts, which he prefers, and on the stovetop (just simmer for 15-20 minutes once you have everything together) and it came out great.  I agree with many others -- a little bland when made as is.  But add these two things and you will have a more authentic flavor: 1/4 tsp. red chili powder & 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi).

FINALLY! I love Indian food and I have tried for YEARS to perfect a butter chicken recipe, only with something a little off, every single time. This one is right on the money!  I found all the spices at Whole Foods. I truly believe that the quality of spices is part of what makes the dish. Curry paste can be hard to find but you can find the Red Curry Paste Thai Kitchen Brand in the ethnic food aisle of any super market.  I used non fat plain yogurt and low fat coconut milk. It still had a hearty texture to it, but with less fat and calories!   I mixed the spices separately together in a small cup before I spread it over the chicken,  this allowed the flavors to blend.   I am definitely adding this to my weekly menu!

Exceptional flavor and a wonderfully easy recipe. Made exactly according to directions (had to make my own Tandoori Masala). Will absolutely make this wonderful recipe again. Entire family loved it, and believe me, our 90 year old mother is real picky about what she likes, and she loved this. What a wonderful blend of spices, and yet the dish itself is far from overly spiced.

Excellent that evening, but even better as leftovers! Very time intensive for a dish going into the crock pot, but it turned out well worth it! Doubled recipe (my family LOVES butter chicken). Considering the other reviews, I only used half the amount of tomato paste and it was not at all too "tomatoey" but just right. I stupidly made a mistake and did not double the cardamom pods (it would have made it even better). I did add an equal amount of fresh ginger as garlic.  Rather than just mincing the garlic, I used my food processor (small bowl) and ground the garlic and ginger into a paste as that is usually what is called for in Indian recipes.  Added this at the very end of the cooking of the onion and chicken. I used Greek yogurt rather than regular - 0% fat and makes it creamier.  Lastly, although the recipe suggests adding the yogurt before cooking, I have done so in other recipes and yogurt and other dairy is likely to curdle in the crock pot. I added it right before serving.  It really pushed the dish over the top.  My family hasn't stopped raving.  They said it was better than our favorite restaurant's.

I've never had the traditional recipe, so I can't compare it, but i did like it very much!  I love the ease of a crock pot, so I didn't Pre-cook the onion since 1) it means I'm defeating the purpose of the crock pot, giving me another item to wash, and 2) the onion will cook in the hot liquid in the pot anyways.  I cannot imagine it made much of a difference in the flavor, if any at all.  I mixed all the ingredients, except the chicken, together in the crock pot, then added the chicken, and stirred to coat the chicken.  To me crock pots are meant to be a 1 step cooking method :)

My slow cooker and I have a love/hate relationship - I love the convenience, but hate the fact that when I stray from the basics (roast) I am inevitably disappointed.  I am happy to say this is NOT the case with this recipe.  I LOVED this one.  I mixed my own tandoori masala (minus the mace which I did not have) following another reviewer's recipe.  I added a chopped tomato instead of canned tomato paste as I am avoiding any canned tomato product.  I also only used 10 cardamom pods - it was still pretty heavy on the cardamom.  I cooked it for 3 hours on high and 1 1/2 hours on low.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make this one again.

This was pretty good, though was lacking some key ingredient that I can't quite identify - possibly fennugreek?  I modified this by adding about a teaspoon of sugar, maybe a little more, and the juice from half a lemon. Several other butter chicken recipes I found include lemon, and I thought this recipe was a little flat until I added this.

This was a good overall recipe, although I did find the 15 green cardamom pods a little over-powering.  I used hot curry spices and pastes.  I did have problems finding the tandoori masala, so I made my own. http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63077657/tandoori-masala-spice-mix/detail.aspx

I LOVED this recipe!  I always get this dish when I go out for Indian food.  It was so easy to make too!  I followed the recipe as is.  I decided to omit the curry paste and I only used half of curry powder.  Only because I am not to big on spicy food.  I will be making this on a regular basis!

Oh and one more tip.  I went to an indian store to get the ingredients, and the owner of the store told me that there is an indian yogurt I should use when making Butter Chicken.   The brand I used was Taaza Indian Style Yogurt.

This was so easy to make and turned out very well.  I did not have cardamom pods so I added a bit more of paste & spices and included some ground cardamom instead.  Still had a really good flavour.

I've made this 2 times.  The first as the recipe describes, pre-cooking everything.  The second time I just put everything in and cooked it together.  I can't say I noticed a difference, so from now on, I'm avoiding all the extra labor and just using the slow cooker.   I did notice that the leftovers tasted better, so perhaps the extra time setting helped the flavor.  Just a personal preference.  A great recipe!

I tried to write this review w/o a star rating because I changed the recipe, but wasn't able to. Because I don't think those two ingredients (cardamom & tomato paste) could have made enough difference I gave it 3*. I didn't have cardamom and I didn't want to use the tomato paste because I don't like it. I doubled the recipe and after cooking it in the crockpot the chicken was dry and the sauce was bland which is strange considering there's several spices, so I added 3 chopped tomatoes, 2 large cans of whole tomatoes which I blended, one chicken cube, extra yogurt, and cayenne pepper for a little kick. Was definitely better. This might be better if made on the stove so the chicken doesn't dry out. Hope this helps.

I always brown chicken before I put it in the crock pot; no matter if the recipe calls for it or not ( the look of unbrowned chicken freaks me out!), so this extra step was of no concern for me. Prepping the recipe is slightly time consuming but worth the 15 to 20 minutes of effort. I prep it before I go to bed and put the crockpot bowl in the fridge with the lid on. In the morning, I drop it in the heating element of the crock, set on low for 8 hours and head to work. I wrap the cardomon seeds in a cheese cloth and tie with butcher's twine. I just fish in out before serving. The needle and thread method recommended is way too much too ask of someone cooking dinner in a crockpot. I also recommend using more chicken then called for. I usually do 6 large thighs.

LOVE THIS DISH!!!  I've had Butter Chicken at our local India restaurant and it was great, but couldn't imagine how great a crockpot version would taste......it's awesome!!  I've never cooked Indian food before so many of the spices were unfamiliar to me I found everything I needed at my local Whole Foods market (thanks to another reviewers suggestion) and pleasantly surprised to find every spice I needed was either available in bulk or in small, packaged portions.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 tsp ground red chili pepper and plenty of salt to taste (to me, the chili powder and salt gave enough of the flavor kick that it was missing but that is just my taste). I used plain greek yogurt, next time I will add that at the last 1/2 of cooking time.   Other than those changes, made exactly according to the recipe and it is amazingly good!!! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!  My husband and three kids all thought this was an excellent recipe.  I'm already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

Loved this- SO good with the coconut milk!  I used TJ's light coconut milk and it was fine- just separated a tiny bit from the sauce, but I was expecting that.  I did not have tandoori masala and just used extra garam masala.  I also added ground ginger.  I had to add a bit more spices before we ate, as the slow cooker tends to mute their flavors.  I added the yogurt right before serving so it would not curdle.  Loved this!

Wonderful! I used half a package of 3 1/2 lb boneless, skinless thighs. I also doubled the garlic, and used tandoori paste, since I didn't have the tandoori masala.  I was surprised to find out I was out of tomato paste, so I subbed about half a small can of sodium free tomato sauce.  I used Thai Kitchen red curry paste, as well as Greek yogurt (added at the beginning and had no curdling issues). Otherwise, used the recipe completely.  It wasn't quite spicy enough, so I put in some crushed red pepper to taste. I didn't thread the cardamom pods--I used cheesecloth to make a "bouquet garni". After cooking this in the crockpot for about 4 hours on high, I threw in a chiffonaded bunch of Swiss chard (needed to use it from my CSA!). Turned down to low for another hour, and thickened the sauce with a little bit of sauce thickener. Delicious! I served with some jasmine rice and roasted, shredded beet salad (seasoned with a little green onions, lemon, & tiny amount of cumin). After tasting this, I think the addition of a little fresh ginger would put it over the top.

We really enjoyed this.  I had everything except for the cardamom pods which I have no idea what kind of flavor they impart so hope I wasn't missing out too much.  Great meal over rice and with some warm whole wheat naan.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend is the main cook in the household, but I've been trying to do more and this recipe is perfect for any ability level! The spices are amazing and make the whole house smell delicious! The chicken came out beautiful and tender! I live in New Zealand and there were a few things I had a hard time finding, so I improvised a bit (used 3/4 tsp ground cardamom instead of pods, used a butter chicken paste instead of tandoori masala) and it was fantastic! I might use low fat coconut milk next time to cut down on calories. I didn't put enough salt into the slow cooker, but adding it in to taste was just fine. My boyfriend said "the only thing I would do differently is....cook it more often." That's a big compliment coming from him!! :-)

Really liked this one. I love Indian food and it was a treat to make it at home in my slow cooker. I agree with another reviewer that the tomato paste was a little too influential in the overall taste and will try replacing with a chopped tomato. This is just a personal preference though. Wonderful recipe!

This chicken is phenomenal. Wars have been fought and won over lesser poultries.

 Seriously, this chicken is a carnival of flavor in your crock pot. I never review recipes online, but I made an exception for this, the most superior of all the butter chickens.

Great recipe and very easy for the slow cooker. I did not sauté my ingredients, I simply put everything in at once in typical slow cooker style. I did increase the spices at lease by 50% and some double. My milk and yogurt did not curdle. I cooked on high for 4 hours with fairly small pieces of chicken. Very yummy and will defiantly make again!

Made this on stovetop, not in slow cooker; also had to sub ingredients. Skinned whole thighs but left bones and didn't cut into chunks.  Sauteed onion, garlic and spices as per recipe (used 1 T. canola, 2 T. light butter), then added thighs to pan.  In separate pan, simmered coconut milk and 1/2 t. Red Thai curry paste,1/2 can tomato paste, 6 cardamom pods-- then poured over chicken.  Didn't use any yogurt.  Covered and cooked about 1 and 1/2 hours on low.  Delish--was not hot so put more curry paste in if it you things hot.  Spices blended beautifully---fragrant and tasty!

I thought this was very good.  I adapted it to be made on the stovetop, but otherwise made no major changes.  While I liked the thickness that the tomato paste gives, I might add less next time because I found the tomato flavor a bit strong for my taste.

I did not care for this recipe. Indian spices must be cooked on stove top until fragrant, they just doesn't work in a slow cooker.

This is the best butter chicken I've ever had- usually I get sick of the smell of slow-cooker meals, but this was mouth-watering for every minute of a long Sunday.  I increased the tandoori masala & curry a bit as well as added lots of salt toward the end.  I also used my rice cooker to steam basmati rice mixed with cardamom pods (next time will add curry for color), and a quick pan naan (no yeast) recipe from thefreshloaf.  By the time all of it was done, my husband said I *had* to invite someone over for dinner to share in the awesome smells permeating the house.  The couple we invited demanded the recipe- this is going in my regular rotation!

Having tried this recipe, I definitely would prefer to cook this dish stove top. The texture of the chicken after it has been slow cooked like this is not something I prefer. However, it was overall a good dish. I had to add some more spices because it was a tad bland for my taste. I'm not taking stars off because of that though because I didn't have the cardamon and did not add it. That might have something to do with it. I'll go with stove top next time.

This smells wonderful while cooking, however the end result was rather bland for my taste. For those who prefer a very mild Indian dish, this would please. I am going to keep working with the recipe to see how I can kick the flavor up a few notches.

It sure smelled delicious while it was cooking, but after waiting all afternoon for my slowcooker to work its magic, I was left disappointed with the lack of flavour. If I were to make this again, I would add more spices. I still prefer "Easy Indian Butter Chicken" by MN from this site.

Much easier. Instead of mixing all the spices, use an Indian butter chicken spice mix from Ethnic foods Aisle.  Coat chicken with 2-3 Tsp spice mix, leaving on for half an hour. Sauté on stove as recommended 10 minutes with onion, garlic and half the amount of tomato paste recommended. Pour into slow cooker. Add coconut milk, yogurt, 10 ground almonds/cashews, cardamom and a little chili pepper. During the last hour, add cup of frozen peas and three potatoes sliced into 2 inch cubes. It gives it more color and allows stretching the meat.

Made this in a dutch oven on the stove instead of the crockpot. Simmered everything for about 1.75 hours. Added the yogurt at the end, after turniing off the heat. It was delicious! The flavors merged beautifully. I used ground cardamom instead of the pods and Greek yogurt. Probably needs more salt but I'll wait to see how it tastes tomorrow.

I made this following the recipe (doubling it) with a few minor changes - added extra curry paste and cardamom pods, and used Greek yogurt.  I used around 12 small chicken thighs and I still feel like it could have used more chicken because there was a ton of sauce (but I could almost drink the sauce anyway.... So good!). Cooked 4 hours on low and it was perfect

My 2 star review had nothing to do with the flavor of this dish - the recipe was perfect.  I followed it as written and made the mistake of cooking it in my 6 quart crockpot. The condensation of steam from the underside of the glass cover began to fall back into the dish, and when it was finished it was actually watered down to something like an Indian butter chicken soup! So disappointed, as the wonderful spices lost their intensity.  I will make this again, but will prepare it and slow cook it in my cast iron enamel pot for a few hours in a 300 oven, and add the yoghurt when the dish is finished.  I'm thinking that way I can control the liquid.

Very very good.  Except for baking, I'm not much for following a recipe to the 'T'.  But it gave me the perfect guide as to the ingredients I needed to use, and an approximation of measurement.  I do make curry a lot, so the only thing I needed at the grocery store were coconut milk and plain yogurt.  The rest I always have lots on hand, because I never know when a hankerin' for curry will happen!

LOVED this recipe!!  It was my first time making Butter Chicken and I read most of the reviews before I started.  It came out AMAZING and my husband kept telling me how great it tasted all during dinner.  Definitely keeping this one in the dinner rotation!  I found the Garam Masala, Tandoori Masala, Cardamom Seeds and the Red Curry Paste at Cost Plus World Market. Everything else I already had.  I used my Cuisinart Multi-Cooker so it was a one-pan dish since I could saute the chicken and onion right in the pot.  I used Greek Yogurt at the beginning and no issues with separation, and I made a bouquet garni out of cheesecloth for the cardamom pods. I was heavy-handed on the spices and I added some Chili Powder and minced ginger as others had suggested.  I set it on low for 8 hrs and my house smelled heavenly!  I served it with Jasmine Rice and warm Naan bread.  YUM!!

I had been dying to make this and had a serious challenge finding all the ingredients. I went to several supermarkets and no luck. Finally I searched out a store that carried Indian spices. The spices alone were $17. It was an easy enough recipe but the taste was so so. Everyone ate it but no one wanted the left overs. In fairness to the recipe, we rarely eat Indian food but my husband loves curry dishes and felt this was very average.

This was good and easy to make.  I was concerned about using coconut milk since I am not a big coconut fan, but luckily I could not even taste it; it just added a smoothness to the sauce.

My family loves this dish -- even my very picky 15 year old considers it one of his favorites. We make it about twice a month. I always increases the spices by at least 50%. As written it's a bit bland. But with that minor change it's perfect!

Followed directions exactly except - because I started too late I cooked  it on the stovetop.  I had very good quality spices which likely make a difference.  I agree with other suggestion to add a splash of lemon juice at the end.  I've eaten a lot of butter chicken and this was right up there and much quicker than the authentic recipes (which require yogurt marinade and multiple steps).  I like that this recipe calls for coconut milk in place of the usual cream and butter.

I made this recipe exactly as per the ingredients/instructions. It came out very good and I will make it again, however I found it to have a stronger taste of tomato than my favourite butter chicken dish that I've had in the past. Next time I might omit the tomato paste entirely. It wasn't too spicey, so that was good because my kids were able to eat it. If you like it spicey though, you might want to add something to it to make it hotter.

I added some freshly grated ginger with the garlic then replaced the chicken with chickpeas and omitted the yogurt to make a vegan version, just drain and rinse the chickpeas and add them once everything else is in the pot. I didn't have tomato paste so I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead and I think gave the sauce more body. This recipe works great on the stove as well as in the slowcooker.

I have give this five stars because it was so easy and I didn't have any leftovers.  NONE!  Well, what there was they were fighting over.  
So good!  I didn't change the recipe even though some ingredients were not found at my usual supermarket.  So I had to make a special trip to World Market to find the spices and I was surprised at how inexpensive they were.  Thank you so much!  And the Naan bread recipe on this site pairs perfectly.

I made this for a serving of 2. BUT I added all the ingredients into the slow cooker at once, mixed them together, then added my uncooked chicken and coated it with the mixture. I set the cooker on low and it was done in 4 hours. Simple and delish!

I loved the flavors that were put into this recipe. What I didn't love was the fact that the chicken was totally overcooked and rendered tasteless. This recipe should be done on the stove top. THe slow cooker just overcooks everything.  I also added the yogurt at the very end.  Next time I cook this it will be on the stove top.

This looks really good and I can't wait to try it as is, then I might make adjustments. I am amazed at the people that make tons of changes to the recipe and then gripe about how crappy it is. Then it's not the original recipe anymore.

My family really liked this!  I had to eliminate some items due to spiciness (I have young kiddos) and their unavailability in the grocery store, but it still had great flavor.  I did not use curry paste, tandoori masala, or the cardamom pods, but I upped the quantity of the garam masala and the curry powder to 1 Tbsp each.  Also, I added chopped zucchini and fresh spinach to the slow cooker for the final hour of cooking.  YUM!  Serve with Naan.

Smelled wonderful when cooking and the taste was to die for!  I like Indian food but made it for boyfriend who LOVES Indian food.  He said he needed a 3rd helping to make sure it was good (yes, I rolled my eyes because I had already figured it was a hit when he was scraping his plate clean on the 1st helping).  Will definitely be making this again!

Loved this recipe!  Made it tonight for supper and doubled the recipe for my large family and probably should have tripled it. They devoured it!  Only change I made was I only used one can of tomato paste in the doubled recipe.  I thought it was perfect, so 1/2 a can for a normal recipe will be what I will do in the future if I make it.  I also want to say that I added the yogurt at the beginning as the recipe called for and had no problems at all with separation.  My family have requested I make this again!

This is very good and can easily be made in slow cooker or stovetop. By the time you make the sauce, you only need to wait for the chicken to cook. I have made this more than once and this time, I needed to sub some things because I didn't have everything and still came out very good. It's 4 stars just because I needed to add extra amount of spices than what was in the recipe. This probably depends on brand of spices so keep that in mind. I changed sour cream for yoghurt since that all I had. I used extra curry powder( store bought)  since I didn't have paste. I added 1/4 tsp chili powder as another reviewer suggested and also added extra of garam masala. (Only because accidentally mixed up amounts of tandoori masala so I got 2 tsp of each but ended up really well) both masala spices I mixed myself. Also make sure to " cook" the spices with onions before adding tomato paste to release the spice flavor. I also skipped cardamom because I didn't have any. Still yummy.

First time making butter chicken in the slow cooker and it turned out delicious. the chicken was so tender and I used chicken breast. Only changes is that I added fresh ginger , 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper  and added the yogurt 15 minutes before serving. I made basmati rice but since my husband is not a big fan of rice , when I can home I diced up some potatoes  and boiled them in 15 minutes and then added them to the chicken for about 5 minutes before serving it. I know it is not traditional butter chicken but it was so delicious. So it was carb overload since I also had it with the basmati rice and let,s not forget the nann bread that soaks up the sauce.
Next time I am making my own mann bread. There is a recipe on this site that has great reviews.

I LOVE Indian food and this is finally a recipe that is identical to my favorite Indian restaurant.  I found all of the spices that I needed at an International grocery store.  Next time I will try adding the fenugreek leaves just for kicks, but this recipe rocks just the way it is.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

Tried this recipe and it was delicious.  Used boneless breast because that is what I had.  Will make with thighs to see which I prefer.

This came out amazing !! I added some kasoori methi leaves and some sugar. I found it to be a little tart, perhaps it was due to the Greek yogurt. Other than that, it was perfect.

Served on a bed of Basmati Rice it was my first time cooking Butter Chicken and it was easier then I expected! However I would have to say that 4 hrs on high is enough cooking time any longer would dry the liquid out. The taste was just amazing! cook it and enjoy your meal :)

I doubled the recipe as we were having guests.  Time slipped by so briefly cooked on the stove top and transferred to my Clay Pot and baked for 1-hour as I prepped the rest of the dinner, enjoyed wine & appetizers with our guests. So glad I did! The chicken was so tender and the spices were perfect! Rave reviews from everyone including my hubby who is a food critic!  Can't wait to make this again!

Just throw everything in the slow cooker and give it a stir.  Its unnecessary to cook everything in the skillet and then cook it again in the slow cooker.  The vegetable oil is unnecessary.  I also added some chopped up red pepper.

This had the potential to be good, but putting yogurt and coconut milk in a slow cooker is just a really silly idea. It ended up separating and the texture was horrible. I think if one were to cook the chicken in one pan and the other ingredients in another pan, then combine into one pot and add the yogurt and coconut milk last, this might be ok. Unfortunately, the method called for in this recipe caused me to waste perfectly good ingredients.

So yummy! I made a few changes though. I substituted 1.5 tsp. of ground cardamom for the pods and used only half a can ( 5.5 oz ) of tomato paste. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and squeezed a wedge of fresh lime over my plate before eating.

This is the best butter chicken recipe I have ever made. It tastes just like butter chicken from a good restaurant. I used 6 chicken thighs which seemes to work with the amount of sauce. We'll definitely be cooking this again!

This is one of my all time favourite recipes, I make it at least once per month! My husband is of Indian heritage and he also gives this recipe his seal of approval for the level of flavours and authenticity. I find that the recipe does not really make enough for leftovers and it does freeze well so I double it. I also use chicken breast not thighs. I don't like picking the cardamon pods out so I enclose them all in a disposable tea bag and then just fish that out at the end. Serve with warm naan, samosas and basmati rice - delicious!!

This was fantastic!  I have a slow cooker that has a non-stick pot that goes from stove top to in the cooker without dirtying a pan to brown things first.  I highly recommend it...  So I cooked the onions and chicken on the stove, added the ingredients (used cardamom powder, had no tandoori masala so added some tumeric)  Served with the basmati rice recipe from this site.

So Good!!! Love the tip about the cardamom pods. We like a little more spice with our Indian food so I added a little Sambal Oeleck. It also didn't take as long in our slow cooker as it called for but ours is a turbo cooker. Other than that, this recipe is as good as it gets for Butter Chicken. We will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe The Meal Planner.

I love butter chicken and this recipe is pretty good. I made a double batch but had only 1 can of coconut milk, so I used a can of evaporated milk and it SMOOTHED it right out! So creamy and rich and wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly, even went to a small local Indian market for some of the ingredients I thought I might have trouble finding at the grocery store.  

It had a nice texture but I thought it was bland.  I eat in Indian restaurants quite a bit and love most of the dishes.  I don't think I've ever had butter chicken before. 

It may be that I am just not a fan of that particular dish.

I am committing the big sin of not actually making this but I am sure it is wonderful.  I have a couple of comments about the recipe, however.  The spices are not typically on my shelf and would entail trying to find them around my area; all that is prepared basically on the stove and could be finished up there or in the oven with the addition of the coconut milk and yogurt.  Putting it all day in the crock pot would be unnecessary in my estimation.

So I've made this twice. As suggested, I added 1/2 tsp of Chilip, and 1 tsp of dried fenugreek.  I cracked the shells of the cardomon, and toasted in a pan with the fenu. I put the cardomon and fenu in a garlic net for easy removal at the end.  Added 1 tsp of cayenne, and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, and 2 tsp of salt.  I used 2 lbs of chicken breasts cut into chunks, instead of thighs.  I skipped the olive oil and just used 3tbls of grass-fed butter. Added the yogurt in the last 30 mins of cooking. With those changes, I am changing my prior rating of 4 to 5 stars, it was delicious.

This was great. I also added the yogurt before serving instead of slow cooking it and used fat free greek yogurt. I grated the garlic in with a zester as I do for most recipes. I served it over brown rice and it was delicious. Don't make the mistake of not using all the tomoto paste. I halved it since another relplier thought it was too tomatoey and we ended up adding a coupl cans of tomato sauce that time as it was not butter chicken without.After adding the tomato sauce cans it was so so much better.  SO the next time we did it as recipe states and was perfect.

I haven't tried other butter chicken recipes but I've tried several other Indian recipes with no success.  This was a winner!  Even the kids loved it.  
I didn't have cardamon pods so I used some ground cardamon and I also had to substitute some "homemade tandoori masala" which consisted of throwing in a few spices that are usually in tandoori masala that I had in the cupboard.

Big hit even with the kids. I followed exactly and then added cashews and golden raisins at the end.I also think more meat is needed. I'd double the chicken next time. Delicious!

Excellent!  I couldn't find tandoori masala so I just left it out.  Also, the only "curry paste" I could find was red curry, and I think that's what made the dish a little spicy.  My husband loved it!  Oh, and I did string the cardamon pods together like someone suggested.  Easy to fish them out that way.  Served over basmati rice.  Plenty of leftovers.   Thanks!

Excellent recipe. I did replace the tomato paste with a quart jar of canned tomatoes(drained). We'll kick it up a notch on the heat next time, we tend to like it hot! Made with Mic's Naan bread on this site....soooooo good!

Very good! Very authentic. I just cooked the chicken and sauce on top of the stove on a slow simmer and it turned out fabulous... I also used chicken breast (which is why I cooked on top of the stove as chicken breast gets dried out in the crock pot).

I've made this a few times now, and it is a total hit. My whole family loves this recipe! I use whole chickens, so I just cut them into pieces and throw them all in there. The meat is falling off the bone when its done. We don't eat grains, so I'll use the sauce for other meat or more chicken or sometimes I've even added it to a soup - and it was all good.

Very  good, esp. for a slow cooker meal. Couldn't find tandoori masala so I just used an extra tsp. of garam masala. I doubled the butter and omitted the vegetable oil. Only needed to cook about 3 - 3 1/2 hrs. on high, 4 hrs. made chicken a bit overcooked. Lots of sauce. Hubby thought it was good, but not as good as the recipe I use for making Butter Chicken on the stovetop, which doesn't have coconut milk.

Love love love this take on butter chicken. I am an Indian food fanatic and was so excited to see a slow cooker version. 
I did make two small changes. The first time that I made this recipe, I followed all of the instructions, including the extra chicken prep. The second time I made it, I just threw all the ingredients into the crockpot, turned it on and said goodbye. Honestly, I didn't notice any difference in taste, so now I strictly just use the plug and chug method. 
Also, all of the times I've used chicken breast instead of thighs. I'm just a white meat kind of gal. Turns out great. Usually I throw in three medium to large breasts and it is the perfect amount.
Lastly, one piece of advice I would give is to cook it for about 4 hours on high and then be done. I did the 6 hours on low option, and for some reason, I like the taste of the high option better. 
I make this dish weekly and will continue to do so. It's a kitchen staple. Happy cooking!

I really enjoyed this and plan to make it again soon.  I was very disappointed that my boyfriend ate the leftovers before I could get to them.  Next time I will double the chicken for a better ratio.  I couldn't find tandoori masala - I substituted with extra garam masala and a little cumin, nutmeg, and coriander (didn't make my own tandoori masala spice blend, since I didn't have everything, but threw in those few components that I did have).

One of my all-time favorite..  Delicious and very creamy!  The only change I made was to omit the cardamon pods, as I do not like this spice.  I have made several times and this is now one of my go-to recipes.

Oh my, is this ever GOOD! My step daughter is an incredibly fussy eater, but butter chicken is one of her favourite dishes ... however, she only likes it from "certain restaurants'. She loved this - said it is her current favourite.  Made as written except used extra hot curry paste (gave a nice kick, but not too hot), zero fat plain greek yogurt and light coconut milk. The greek yoghurt adds thickness that you loose from using light coconut milk. I also added a tsp of kasoori methi, as suggested by one of the Indian reviewers (thank you!). The cardamom pods add such a delightful flavour! But definitely use an infuser or put them in a tea/mesh bag, as they are bitter when bitten into. Served with naan, cauliflower rice, raita and a crisp riesling - heaven!

The sauce was nicely flavored, but the chicken came out too shreddable and no longer had a chicken consistency.  Because of the length of time in the slow cooker, it became more like a pulled chicken.  Next time, I will not have the chicken pieces cooking all day in the slow cooker and I will just cook up the chicken separately after some marinading during the day.  Since I've tried this recipe, I've found a much easier non-slow cooker recipe that was just as tasty.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It had very good flavor.  I made the recipe as is, but the next time I will try adding the ground fenugreek leaves and the chilli powder, as suggested by another reviewer, just to see if it adds an extra spicy kick.

After finding all the ingredients at Whole Foods ($$$), I embarked on the journey of creating this recipe.  Didnt't know what to expect as I am not familiar with these types of ingredients.   I used just a container of chobani plain yogurt and omitted the cardomom pods (couldn't find any).  It was delicious!  Served it over organic brown rice.  Will certainly make again, especially after spending so much on the herbs!

Made this for dinner and served with naan bread. The house smelt like an Indian restaurant with the aromas omitting from our slow cooker. Very popular with our butter chicken- lover, my brother.

I'm sure this dish turns out great. It looks & sounds very flavorful, but it's not butter chicken.  BC is a mild tomato based dish w cream & ground cashewnuts , never coconut milk. Again, I'm sure it's  a great dish don't mean to  be negative but a  quesadilla  &  fajita's are not the same thing.

This is really good, just like most all the other reviewers have said.  I love it b/c I cooked it mid-afternoon and then transferred it to the crockpot.  I am usually so tired by the end of the day that I don't want to spend a lot of time preparing a meal.  With this recipe, I had most of the clean-up done by 3:00 and dinner was cooking away.  All I had to do was turn the stove on to cook the rice.  Simple!!  I served it with my garden fresh cucumbers, onion and Greek yogurt salad.Big hit and a keeper for sure!!

We thought this was delicious.  Traditionally, I (my home family) HATES anything from the crock pot.  This was an exception.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and added chili powder to the recipe.  I did not have "tandoori masala" so I googled it to see what is in it.  I had most of those ingredients but not all, and didn't miss anything at all!  One reviewer suggested adding fenugreek to the recipe but I couldn't find that either and found that depending what flavor you're going for, you can add lemon, honey and/or Dijon.  I added a dash of each since I wasn't sure.  The dish is very "forgiving" so don't worry about what you don't have or measuring exactly.  We loved it with whatever I threw in there.  I served it will chick peas in a spicy sauce I threw together.  This will definitely be a repeat dish in my house.  We are Indian food lovers all the way!  Give it a try!

I didn't have the more exotic ingredients, but made it just with what we had in the house, and it was great! The coconut milk gives it such a rich feel and taste.

Oh, I was so ready to love this, It really does smell delicious.  But the taste really fell short for me.  The chicken was a bit dry, I did it for 5hrs on low in the slower cooker.  At the suggestion of others, I used 2 diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste.  And I added the yogurt during the last 30 mins of cooking.  Its just lacking flavor.  My house does smell delicious though.  Very disappointed in the taste.

Wow!  This is superb!  It is time consuming.  First I bought organic chicken thighs and yogurt and tomato paste.  The other, more exotic, ingredients were not to be found either at Kroger or at the international grocery.  (Or else I just couldn't find them and no one who worked at the store seemed to speak much English.)  I found the rest of the ingredients at Whole Foods.  Thank goodness for the bulk spice section as I could just buy what I needed.  We had to look up the ingredients on our smart phone as to how to make garam masala (this website) and tandoori masala (another website).  I found curry paste and coconut milk.    The cardamom pods were in the bulk spice section (if the first person doesn't know--ask someone else).  When we got home, I strung the cardamom pods as directed (be sure to have a durable needle as mine broke).  Then I made the garam masala and the tandoori masala.  The next morning, fixed it exactly as directed.  When it was ready to eat, I thought that it could benefit nutritionally from the addition of some frozen peas and the rest of a large package of raisins.  Served it over rice and with naan.  Is it as good as takeout?  Absolutely, and it made a huge amount.  Was it more expensive than takeout?  Indubitably!  Was it fun to make?  Sure, as my husband helped me to hunt and gather ingredients and my mother kept me company.

This was great!  Restaurant quality.  It tastes even better leftover, I think because the spices mingle.  I didn't use the cardamom pods and even without them it tasted exactly as I hoped it would.

Just made this recipe.  Added cayenne pepper like someone else has suggested and added 50% more of the spices.  It was so easy and delicious.  This will definitely become a regular in my house.

I made this dish today and couldn't believe the fragrance that came out of the combination from the spices.  It smelled so delicious that I kept peeking in the top of the lid to see what was going on.  I added the fenugreek leaves and chili paste as suggested by a previous reviewer.  I don't know what the difference is without them other than giving the dish a kick.  Salt is definitely needed.  Once I added it the flavors came out that much more.  My guess is that it'll taste even better tomorrow and am looking forward to finding out.  Thanks to all the reviewers for your input and suggestions!

By the way, the dish did taste better the next day!

UPDATE: I substituted cauliflower as an alternative and used a dutch oven to cut down the cooking time.  It tastes just as delicious!

I am not a big fan of Indian food or curry but my husband likes it and I know he really liked butter chicken he tried in the area. I looked at a couple of similar style dishes but decided to try this one because it seemed the simplest. My husband liked it and got a second as well but for the second, he added a little half and half and a little more salt. He said he remembered it being creamier. I thought that actually made it really good. I had a little bit, too with naan bread and to my surprise I quite liked it. I did make a little bit of change. I just used a whole bag of frozen chicken breast(2.5 lb) and like one of the reviewer suggested, added 1/4 teaspoon chili powder(and also 1/4 cayenne just for a little kick) and 1 teaspoon fenugreek?) and 9 cardamom pods and half of suggested tomato paste(also suggested by another review) and also 1 1/2 cup of refrigerated coconut milk instead of can(since we had an open carton already and the coconut flavor was getting a bit too overpowering after one and a half cups). I will definitely make it again and add some half and half again. Oh...it was quite spicy when I tasted at first but after adding the yogurt at the end, it wasn't that spicy anymore.

Needed more spices, recipe as is is not flavorful enough. Just tweak it a little and it comes out well enough.

I followed the recipe as is, and it was bland.  It didn't have a lot of flavor or spice.  The overriding flavor was tomato. I tried to add extra curry paste towards the end once I knew it wasn't turing out as I had hoped, but that didn't save it.  I was hoping for something more restaurant quality, and this wasn't it.  This wasn't even a good base recipe, because there wasn't even enough flavor to build on.  I'm going to keep searching for a better recipe.

This is delicious!  It's so much better than the bottled version which is loaded with preservatives.  I added 1 tbsp of Patak's mild curry and used non-fat Greek yogurt.  I also substituted 2 1/2 tsps of ground cardamon instead of using pods since I didn't have any on hand.  I left the thighs whole instead of cutting them and it turned out perfectly.  I thought cutting the meat would maybe make the pieces too small once they were cooked.  As it was, the meat was so moist no one needed a knife!  I served it with jasmine rice and raita. I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sraing this recipe!

This recipe is amazing!! Definitely a keeper. The house smells fabulous all day too. I think it is even better the 2nd day after the flavors have had a chance to meld. I added fresh ginger to the recipe, more of all the spices and some hot peppers. Everyone I serve it to asks for the recipe.

Good recipe! I didn't have cardamom pods nor tandoori masala (used 4 tsp of garam masala instead), and it was fine. Served with white rice. Will put this in the Indian food craving rotation :) Cooked it just under six hours on high, but there's not enough volume in this recipe to tolerate that many hours on high (mine was burnt around the edges -- wasn't home to adjust).

after all the work to get the ingredients, this was a bit of a letdown. I added the yogurt at the end as others suggested and it totally overwhelmed the flavors. I used non-fat mountain high plain active yogurt which is pretty tart, and the whole thing ended up tasting very tart. i'm going to try to other easy butter chicken recipe on this site next.

I have no time to cook so I literally just put all the ingredients into the crock pot and it came out pretty darn good. I would make this again. I am going to add some coconut milk next time to sweeten it up just a tad but even without, I still liked this!

This was so delicious!  I LOVED it.  Looking forward to making it again. I followed the recipe to a T except  I used 10 cardamom pods instead of 15.  (the pods can be found in the spice section of the grocery store)

Love this recipe! It fits perfectly in a small (1.5 quart) slow cooker. I'm pretty heavy handed with the spices,  have found that the coconut milk that you find in the "natural" section of your grocery store (by the soy milk, etc.) works just great, and use about 1-2 teaspoons salt. Also, it tastes even better the next day.

This butter chicken was fabulous. My husband LOVED it. He's been to India and hasn't found a butter chicken he likes since then until now :) I added another 1/2 tbsp. of curry paste to make it a bit spicier. Love love love this! :

this was good, but just shy of the mark...it is reminiscent of Butter Chicken but missing something, and i'm not expert enough to know what that is!  perhaps it is dependent on what kind of curry paste you use;  i used Patak's Madras curry paste...however, even tho it isn't really Butter Chicken to me, it is a nice quasi-curry that i will be making again!  thanks!!

I made this tonight and it was fantastic.  Butter Chicken is my favorite Indian dish and this slow cooker version is easy and awesome.  I served it with some rice, naan and two chutneys - tamarind and mint.  Even my picky 11 yr. old son liked it!

Quite good!  I substituted a little extra yogurt and a splash of heavy cream for the coconut milk.  Take the advice others have mentioned, and string together the cardamom pods before cooking this dish.  I never managed to fish all of mine out, and whenever I bit into one, it made for a very intense flavor that overshadowed the flavors of the dish.

I didn't have tandoori masala or its' constituents. Instead I opted for grated ginger, cinnamon, and garlic powder. It turned out legendary. Don't forget to prop your slow cooker open for the last 2 or so hours to let it reduce.

This was without a doubt, the best butter chicken I have ever tasted. I went to an Indian Grocery, got all my spices and prepared this meal the next day, with my husband. It was quick and easy and very tasty. I highly recommend people try this recipe. It’s great with Basmati rice and Naan garlic bread.

This is very good!  I married into an East Indian family and they snicker at my not-quite-butter-chicken -- but -- they all go back for seconds or even thirds (yes, Uncle, I'm looking at you!).  Obviously I've made this several times and it is on permanent rotation for large family dinners.  I adjust the spicy up a little, knowing my audience.  

But the real key here is *do not* hurry it.  It is best when you cook it in the crockpot eight hours.  The best it ever came out was when I cooked it for eight+ then our guests were delayed and it stayed in the crockpot two more hours in "keep warm" mode.  The worst it ever came out (relatively and all) was when I started it at lunch time for a 7:00 p.m. dinner.

Never made this dish but have ordered it at restaurants.  It was delicious! I made it in my tagine. Only problem I had was with the yogurt. It was a little lumpy. I think it needs to be added once pot has been removed from heat.

I made this with some necessary alterations and it came out divine!  I live in a rural area so I don't have easy access to east Indian spices.  I made the Tandoori masala myself from the only spice mix recipe for this found on AllRecipes (the only spice I didn't have in my spice rack was fenugreek powder).   I did not have any curry paste, so just added another teaspoonful of curry.  I did not have green cardomom pods, I had black - added only 7 of those since I wasn't sure what the flavor difference would be.  I also didn't have any coconut milk, and neither did my local grocery store.  I substituted the regular yogurt with two containers of Greek coconut yogurt and mixed it with coconut water before adding it to the crock pot.  This made a great substitute for the coconut milk.  The last change I made was I used 3 skinless chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs, and I doubled the sauce recipe so that I could add vegetables.  It all came out wonderfully, and it was served on long grain brown rice.  I also agree with other reviewers that using a half-can of the tomato paste is plenty, a full can would be too much.   I can't wait to make it again, I just love Indian food!  This is a fantastic recipe.

This has become a household favorite.  I add a teaspoon of cayenne and chili powder to give it more Indian heat.  I often substitute lamb for chicken.

I was short on time so I made this on the stove in a dutch oven.  Took about 45 minutes (not including chopping).   We LOVED it.  I doubled the recipe and the 3 of us almost knocked the entire thing out.  I did add about 1/2 tsp of salt and an extra tsp of curry powder.  Enjoy!

This is one of my favorite recipes!!! I have made it quite a few times.  Tonight is the first time I used the crock pot and it came out good.  I usually just cook up the chicken on the stove and heat all the ingredients and it turns out great. I use chicken breast, and Mae Ploy's Panang Red curry paste which gives it some heat! I also put the cardamon pods in a metal tea ball so I can just take them out.  Thanks for such an amazing recipe!!

I was missing the garam tandoori and cardamom pods but went ahead anyway and it was still delicious. I did the whole shebang in the show cooker, including sauteing the onions. Also, I tripled the garlic. This is a super recipe for a busy day and the leftovers were perfect for lunches.

Very flavorful dish.  My son liked it but said it could have used some more coconut milk to make sweeter.  He said it was a bit bitter but I think he may have eaten a cardamom pod I didn't take out.  I didn't have tandoori masala, but still enjoyed the flavor.  Not a weekly dish but something I will make again with some substitutions.

I've made this several times.  I skip the cardamon and use chicken breast instead of thighs.  It  is so yummy.  My husband and I really enjoy it!  I think you need the tomato paste, but if you don't like it I think you could certainly cut the amount in half.

I make a restaurant version of Butter Chicken that involves marinating in a yogurt mixture overnight, cooking chicken in oven and then adding to sauce.  The seasonings are similar.  This version is good but definitely needs more seasoning; as other commenters have said, it's pretty bland. I halved the tomato paste per other recommendations.   I doubled the seasonings and added a little, minced hot pepper (you can use crushed red chili or a few dashes of cayenne).  As the original always has ginger, I added some ginger/garlic paste that I already had in the fridge  (or just grate some in there), as well as a squeeze of lemon.  We loved it!  We'll still make the other once in a while but this is good for fast, in-between times.

I made this per the recipe and the results were delicious. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and served over basmati rice. Our family likes spicy dishes so we garnished with a light sprinkle of cayenne pepper at the table. I will certainly make this again.

I've made this over and over for my hubby and me. I don't use a slow cooker, but just make it in a skillet. I increase the amount of curry to increase the heat. Otherwise it is perfect. The recipe actually make a lot of sauce for the two of us, so I freeze part of it for future use, or for a really quick meal freeze it with chicken included. This takes a few minutes to make, but is well worth it.

This is family's new favorite dish I make! Great flavor! I couldn't find tandoori masala so I looked up what spices it's made of and add all those instead. I don't measure them. Just. A little of this and a little of that. Works great!

I like to use honey yogurt instead of plain.  I also use cardamon seed powder instead of the seeds, about a teaspoon's worth.  Finally, I add a couple handfuls of chopped baby spinach for some added color and nutrients.  It's one of my go-to meals.

I will start by saying that I am a horrible person.  There were a number of ingredients that I did not have on hand, so I made substitutions with what was available.  I used bone-in chicken breasts, a combination of curry powder and spices to resemble the  tandoori masala mix (thank you for guidelines, Britishbaker).  That said, I gave this a high rating because, despite my best efforts, it was still delicious.  I suspect my version would not pass for authentic butter chicken, but I still enjoyed every  bite.  Thank you for sharing.  I will try to come closer next time.

I made this dish for my boyfriend who is Indian and he absolutely loved it! I followed all the instructions, except I added fenugreek and chili powder for extra flavor. In the future I will try to just throw all the ingredients in the crockpot, rather than sautéing the onions and chicken separately on the stove, as the point of a slow-cooker meal is to throw it all in the pot and walk away.

Easy and delicious.  I solved the pod problem by wrapping them along with some Fenugreek seeds in cheese cloth and tying the little package with some kitchen twine.  I used 2 % reduced fat Greek yogurt and 1 tbsp of grapeseed oil to 3 tbsp of butter. Didn't have curry paste but did add Indian curry powder.  Otherwise perfect as it.  Will serve this later with a cucumber and scallion salad along with the rice.

Great flavor!  This tastes even better on day 2 or 3. Also, it doesn't overwhelm your office break room when you reheat it- it doesn't have that overpowering curry scent. One of our absolute favorite dishes.

I tried making it in the one pot method, so I didn't sautee the onions.  They came out a little firm in the final product, probably because I used the high setting rather than the low setting on the crock pot. It didn't seem like there was much chicken in the recipe.  I would probably add 1.5-2 times more next time.

I made this to spec.  I personally did not care for the slight hint of coconut from the coconut milk, next time I will probably use heavy cream.  I do think the foundation of this recipe is excellent though, and is one that will stick with me for sure!

I have grown to enjoy going to Indian buffets to sample dishes, and this is one of those that I've always wanted to try and make. I after doing it the first time, I'm quite excited to eat it. This is definitely one that I will be making many times.

Not as good as my favorite restaurant version, but still very tasty. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, because I don't really like thigh meat, otherwise everything was the same as written. The sauce had a nice creamy texture and was very flavorful and the chicken was tender and tasted great. They don't sell garam or tandoori masala at my local grocery, so I mixed up my own using recipes I found on the internet. Served over some basmati rice with a piece of naan bread.

My husband loved it. I didn't think too much of it. It was really bland when I tried it at 4 hours and I added more curry and fenugreek and tandoori masala. I omitted the curry paste because I couldn't find a small jar at a decent price. I put everything in the slow cooker at the beginning and cooked it according to the directions. The chicken dried right out. But overall I don't like curry and I'm not a big fan of indian food but this wasn't too overwhelming and I really appreciated that. Because my husband loved it I gave it a four. I think it would be better on the stove top rather than in the slow cooker.

This is easy! Our local grocery stores charge way too much for these spices so I make regular trips to the little Asian store. I took cozycook's suggestion and added the chili powder and kasoori methi. It really does bring more authentic flavor. The idea to string the cardamom pods together would have saved a lot of time nervously searching for them. I added diced potatoes, green pepper and garbanzo beans because on a weeknight, I just felt too tired to do the other dish those usually go into.  It turned out to be a great AND HUGE one-pot meal.

After reading a number of reviews and suggestions I decided to make this dish and what a pleasant surprise at how it turned out.  The key is the spices.  I took the suggestion of adding Fenugreek leaves and I'm sure it enhanced the dish.  I received a compliment from a co-worker by telling me that it rivals a local Indian restaurant.  Thanks for everyone's input and comments.

Update: Since my last review I've experimented a bit by using a dutch oven and substituting chicken with Cauliflower.  Using the dutch oven cuts down cooking time.  I've simmered it for 2 hours on low heat using either chicken or Cauliflower and it comes out just as delicious.

Was very good however I would add the coconut milk to the dish in the last half hour of cooking. Other than that, my family really enjoyed it!

This needs double the amount of spices & more tomato paste.  It was a little bland compared to what I've had at Indian restaurants.  The recipe is a good starting point, but needs tweaked with regard to flavor.
2/13/15 - I made this again using 1.5 times the amount of spices & chili paste it calls for & it was much better - 4 stars now.  I also found that for some reason, I prefer the green chili paste over the red chili paste in this recipe.

I did not use the curry powder and instead opted to use a mix of the following instead: 
1 tsp turmeric, 
2 tsp ground cumin powder, 
1 tsp ground coriander powder, 
1 tsp red chili powder, to taste and put it all in with the chicken. 
I then also added: 
Pinch of cardamon powder,
lemon juice,
1 teaspoon of ginger powder,
it was good, but still I agree with everyone else, it's missing some depth... 
I have made this both on the stove stop and in the crockpot and didn't really tell much difference in the sauce, but the chicken was dryer in the crockpot.

Made it last night- got rave reviews! Can't believe how easy it was to put together!! I used low fat coconut milk and non fat yogurt, also added fenugreek leaves as suggested by a reviewer but other than that followed the recipe completely! Will make it again- thanks for the recipe.

I love butter chicken and this was just awesome. I did take the advice of another review and added red chili pepper and fenugreek leaves and increased the cardamom seeds to 25. Will definitely make again and again:-)

The flavor was so delicious and the chicken was so tender. I didn't cook it near as long in the slow cooker as called for since the chicken is essentially cooked beforehand.  But the favors still had time to blend. Play with the amount of curry paste for spiciness also. I'll make it again!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I used half the tomato paste and added a little cayenne pepper and salt.  Next time I will use the light coconut milk.  I also added cilantro on top at the end, it needs that touch if fresh.  Lastly, I made this on the stove top and added the yogurt at the end.

Soooooo disappointed. Expensive, time-consuming, and followed the directions (which I never do) and it was simply tasteless and flat, though loaded with lovely Indian spices, it was missing the wonderful layers and flavors we were craving. Did not taste like butter chicken that we know and love at all! Rinsed the chicken pieces off, ditched the sauce, and gave my backyard racoon the meat.

Just made this tonight and it was delicious. The only thing I substituted was the tomato paste with tomato sauce because it was missing in the pantry. The yogurt/coconut milk did curdle in the slow cooker on high, but this problem was fixed by removing the chicken and blending it with a hand blender. There was a lot of sauce because of the substitution however it tasted incredible.

I made this,and I LOVE Indian food... but felt that with all of the spices, there was surprisingly not much of a "middle" flavor. I was even heavy handed in my interpretation of the spices, using rounded spoonfuls....I could tell the spices were in there, but they were watered down. The sauce was not as rich as I had wanted, either. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the mix, and it gave it a little more body...I know, NOT Indian, but it just needed something. It was pretty good then...just my opinion.

My husband loves the Butter Chicken at the Indian Restaurant, so I attempted this recipe and found it to be a winner. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and we really enjoyed it. The next time I tossed the chicken with some extra garam masala (I loved this spice blend and bought a huge jar of it)and let it rest before cooking (like a dry rub) This intensified the flavor even more. The only other change was to add the yogurt about an hour before serving, which kept it from curdling and kept it nice and saucy. Now my husband loves my Butter Chicken even more the the restaurant (which might be because he can have a huge portion)   The main difference for me is that the chicken in this recipe is so much more tender, because the restaurant (if authentic) is adding cooked tandori chicken to the sauce, and the chicken ends up being a little bit tough and stringy.

This recipe seemed to have potential with all the spices, but really was terribly bland. On another note, this seemed like a lot of prep work and I just as easily could've let it simmer on the stove for a bit rather than simmer all day in a crockpot.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this.  I would have given it 5 stars but I feel like the prep instructions for a crockpot meal were too labor intensive.  I did follow the instructions but next time I will either throw everything into the crockpot from the beginning or if I do the skillet routine I will keep it in the skillet and put a lid on it and simmer for 30 minutes, adding the yogurt in the last few minutes.

Yummy.  I eliminated the oil.  Used red curry powder and green curry paste.  Used 1 tsp of cardamon instead of the pods (no pods).  Added the yoghurt in the last 20 minutes.  Cooked on high for 6 hours.  My first Indian dish that tasted Indian!

Tried this recipe twice now and it really is worth its 5 stars. First time I tried the recipe I used chicken breast and found it quite dry (after being in the slow cooker for several hours) so would recommend using legs (or some other meat with a bit of fat on it.....might even try lamb !)

Enjoy

This was delicious. A five star if I mixed it with the right vegetables: diced potatoes, cauliflower. my husband might like asparagus and chile peppers. Served with naan.

Amazing! I forgot to buy tomato paste, so I used a jar of basil tomato pasta sauce, and it was delicious.

I made this for an Indian pot luck. Everybody raved about it, even the Indians! Used chicken thighs with bones still in and then pulled out the bones before serving and chopped up the thighs a little. Very easy!

I have tried many butter chicken recipes and this is the tops!  I was pinched for time, so I prepared it in 30 minutes via cooktop and it was still gorgeous.  Having time for the spices to bloom can only make it even better, aka in the crockpot.  I used homemade tandoori & garam masala and added a extra teaspoon of the tandoori, because we like a lot of spice.  We also added a touch of cayenne for some heat.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and even added a few tsps of Fenugreek per others suggestions.

First of all, there is a lot of work to be done for a so called "crockpot mean".  In my opinion, you may as well just make this in a large pan and let simmer for 30 min or so.

Secondly, it had the same issue that all other Indian recipes I have tried. It tasted too much like tomato and lacked "something" in flavor.  I even added more of all seasonings, thinking maybe the long cooking caused blandness.

Made recipe as stated except for doubling it.  Fabulous just as written.  Great spicing that is not over the top for my five year old daughter and 72 year old Mother-in-law.  Dish was even better then next day as lunch for work.  Mixed rice into a portion of the leftovers and ate it with saltines.  

Going to try it with veal next time.

This was an amazing recipe! I basically doubled the ingredients (we eat a lot), and made a couple minor changes ( used tandoori paste bc my local store didn't have masala, added garlic powder and garlic salt and lots of red pepper, 5 pods), and it was awesome. I threw all the ingredients in the crockpot, only sautéed the garlic and onion for a quick sec. Big hit in my house and my bf and I loved it. Will totally be making this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was soooo yummy and tasted restaurant quality!  I did not use the "tandoori masala" but did have the "garam masala".  Also did not have cardamom, but instead used 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Lastly, I added 2 T. of brown sugar to better please my children.  Because she didn't include any vegetables, I took it upon myself to throw in some frozen peas and carrots.  I would make it just like this again, for sure!

I was surprised by how bland I found this recipe, leading me to believe that the quality of the spices that you use directly influences this dish. It smelt amazing but tasted 'meh'. But I bought inexpensive bulk spices and only had margarine instead of butter... will make again to give it another shot with spices from an indian shop and butter, because there's clearly a lot of potential here.

I made this chicken for some of my girlfriend and they LOVED it. The chicken was tender and not at all dry. I didn't use the cardamom pods, but there was plenty of flavor. Next time, I might add some really hot spices I bought in Tunisia...it wouldn't be very traditional, but I think that will add a kick!

This was easy to make and outstanding !  Added 1/2t of Cayenne Pepper to the mixture just to wake it up, a bit.  Don't skimp on the sale amount called for, its really needed to help bring up the wonderful flavors in the sauce!  Speaking of sauce... we had a good bit left over and Mrs Green Eggs & Ham baked meat balls in the oven then put them in that wonderful sauce.  Most excellent !

I was so excited about this recipe, and was terribly disappointed. It smelled really good as it was cooking but ended up being very bland. My husband, cousin and I all agreed it was subpar. I was surprised, since usually with such high ratings i'm very pleased. Maybe the fact that we have some really good authentic indian food in our neighbourhood has exposed us to the more aromatic and full flavoured dishes.

Made this in the Instant Pot pressure cooker and it was wonderful (10 minutes to sauté, 10 minutes to reach pressure and 15 minutes to cook - all in the same pot)!  I didn't have the tandoori masala, curry paste or cardamom pods so it might have been even more savory.  Definitely a new go to recipe.

I took the advise of a reviewer and made it in a skillet with chicken brest. I used spices I had in my pentry (didn't have the masalas, so I used carry and cumin and cinnamon etc) came out great any way and spiced our dinner up.

I took the easy way out and just mixed all the spices with the yogurt in the crockpot, without precooking the spices with the chicken.  I'm sure if I had done that the flavours would have been even better.  It was still really good and satisfying.  I did add fenugreek and red chili powder as many other reviewers suggested.  I also added a cup of chicken stock as I was worried there wouldn't be enough liquid to keep this moist for 10 hours while I was at work.  I lightly crushed the cardamom pods, as my Pakistani friend advised me to, and put them into a coffee filter, which I folded like an envelope.  Once I had mixed all the ingredients together, I submerged the filter.  I will definitely make this again!

Very Yummy. I used 1.5 lbs of chicken thighs which turned out to be more than "4". This recipe would be good with peas, cauliflower, and pea pods too we thought. Next time we plan to try more veggies in there.

This recipe was very easy to make once I had bought and assembled the ingredients.  It was SO delicious!!!!  We will definitely have it again soon.  As advised, I would put the cardamon seeds in a little muslin bag (found in cooking stores) or thread them together to make it easier to retrieve after cooking.  I didn't do it and was sorry!  I can't imagine anyone NOT loving this dish!

I have used the All Recipes website for years, and this is my first time to be so 'wowed' I am posting a review. This Butter Chicken was DELICIOUS! My husband said 'This will be part of our regular rotation for sure." and that was from the aroma before tasting it. I used 6 boneless skinless thighs rather than 4 as indicated in recipe. I found all the spices needed at Whole Foods, took several reviewer suggestions and I strung the 15 Cardamom Pods together with needle and thread which did make discarding them after quite easy. I also added the 0% fat Greek Yogurt at the end just before serving with small amount of jasmine rice and warm Naan bread. Amazing! Will do this regularly. I will experiment with crushed/diced tomato in lieu of tomato paste next time just to see difference. I also opted for Lite Coconut milk. My slow cooker has a brown/sauté option in addition to slow cook, so next time I will do the entire preparation in the slow cooker rather than initial sauté of chicken, onion and garlic on stovetop. Thanks for sharing Meal Planner!!!

Followed directions completely save for cutting up the chicken instead of leaving it together.  I also used boneless breast.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was excellent with a mild curry flavor.

Excellent.  I just tried this recipe today.  I cooked it on low for 8-9 hours.  My husband and 18 month old baby loved it!  I omitted tandoori masala since I did not have any in the pantry.

As written, the recipe is a yummy curry. However, it is not a buttery mukhani. I noticed that when I poured the coconut milk and yogurt into the slow cooker at first, it had that great mukhani (which means buttery, not butter) consistency. So, I would make this recipe again with just a couple of changes. Instead of 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter... use all butter. And, wait to add the coconut milk and yogurt until 10-20 mins before serving. Also, I really like the Northern Indian dishes, and they use cream (not coconut milk or yogurt), so next time I will probably just use cream instead of the coconut milk.

Like indian food cooked itself in my kitchen...delicious! I followed the recipe to a T, except I ended up using chili paste instead of curry paste-just subbed it right in there. Spiced it up a bit, but not so much that I couldn't taste the complexity of flavors, would probably do it again on purpose :)

This is missing something in flavor. I went to an Indian market and got a tandoori butter chicken spice blend and also used garam masala, tandoori chicken masala and the other spices in the recipe. I ended up adding sour cream too at the suggestion of the Indian market owner to tame the heat (they only had hot curry paste) since I'm nursing my daughter. The sour cream really helped the overall flavor. I also added more butter, pepper, salt & spices toward the end. It was good but still not excellent. I buy an Indian butter chicken mix in a box that is just as good and done in 30 minutes on the stove top so I'm not sure if I'll try this again until I'm not nursing and can go to town on the spices.

I am crazy about Indian food, so this idea really appealed to me.  It was very good, but the first thing I want to warn everyone about is the green cardamom pods:  DO NOT PUT THEM IN LOOSE, as the recipe states!  Either steep them in the coconut milk first & strain them out, or put them in a cheesecloth bundle.  It was VERY difficult to find them all after cooking, as the chopped onions look an awful lot like cardamom pods when everything is covered in sauce!

Secondly, this recipe needs about double the amount of chicken, IMHO.  It was almost like soup -- not such a bad thing, though, if you're serving it with rice - I only had naan this time, but next time, I will definitely make rice.  :)

Having said all that, honestly, the Patak's Butter Chicken Sauce is pretty much the same thing, but a lot less work (granted, more $, in the long run).

The aroma emitting from the Kitchen as this cooked was devine! I LOVE butter chicken, but find it hard to tolerate food that is too hot/spicy for my Aussie palate (which can be the case on occasion when dining on traditional Indian cuisine).
This recipe however, was not too hot or spicy for me OR my family!
Admittedly, I did not add the 'tandoori masala' as my supermarket did not stock it, so I'm not sure how much this would have added to the intensity had it been used.
This recipe is definitely a 'keeper' & will certainly make a regular appearance on my Winter Menu :)

Seriously, fantastic recipe.  I followed the recipe....almost exactly...except I  don't use the crockpot,  I used breasts instead of thighs and greek yogurt instead of regular.  Also, I didn't have cardamom pods.  This turns out perfect every time.  Restaurant quality!! The flavors were really rich and fragrant, I can't say enough good things about this. We make this probably twice a month!

We LOVED this! I followed the recipe almost as written. I added an extra thigh and 2 tsp of sugar. 
I took the thigh meat off the bone myself.  I didn't have to worry about getting it all off because I just threw the bones in the slow cooker, too. The meat was all cooked off and I'm sure it added alot of flavor. I took bones out along with the cardamom seeds. I also read about adding fenugreek leaves but while I was shopping I read the ingredients of the curry powders and found one that had fenugreek in it. SCORE!
Oh man, the flavor was excellent and to our surprise ours had a really nice spicy kick to it. Now, that I have all of the spices I will definitely make this again and again. The only thing I need is some Naan next time.

When I got this recipe in my email today it inspired me to 'go for it' - I had some, but far from ALL of the ingredients. I couldn't resist making "Indian" for dinner tonight, so I browned the boneless chicken thighs I had on hand in extra butter (no oil), onions and roasted garlic granules--in the meantime, in the slow cooker, I threw in a can of evap. milk, a can of tomato soup, a tsp. of garam masala, a heaping tsp. of curry powder, a jar of Trader Joe's Masala sauce,  a tbsp. of coriander paste (jarred "chutney" from the Indian market), about 3/4 cup shredded coconut, and about a cup of nonfat plain yogurt. Cooked that sauce first and then added the buttered onions and chicken with the garlic.  I salted the chicken slightly.  If you could smell my house right now you'd think you were in a 'good' Indian restaurant!  The sauce tastes divine and it's not even cooked for more than an hour.  I know it's going to be excellent tonight and better tomorrow--and I promise I will make this again, and do it just as the recipe calls for but for now, I wanted to put this in so that I can remember how I improvised on this! But Indian IS forgiving, isn't it? LOL

Granted, I'm no expert on Indian-style dishes, but this turned out really well. I couldn't find all of the required seasonings in my store, so I bought a premade jar of yellow curry sauce, then added the yogurt, tomato paste, etc. I'm sure the original version of the recipe is much better, but even with my modifications I was pleasantly surprised.

This was Yummo! My kiddos even liked it. I could not find cardamon pods so I just omitted and added an extra tablespoon of curry.  I will also cut up more chicken for this next time. This will be in our monthly menu rotation.

This was fantastic!  I bought the wrong kind of cardamom pods (black, not green) so I just used ground cardamom instead.  I also used chicken breasts rather than thighs, and it was so good.  Even my 6 year old ate it without complaining, which is rare :)

this is one of my families favorite recipes.  The only changes I make--lite coconut milk and fat free greek yogurt.  Also--we like to eat this with/on naan, similar to a flatbread wrap.  YUM!!!

Following the advice of other reviews; I too used chopped tomatoes instead of tomato paste and added the yogurt just before serving. It was a hit! I didn't have cardamon pods so I used 1/2 tsp dried cardamon. Served with basmati rice and naan.

My Butter Chicken has been in the slow cooker for about 3 hours now and I just sampled it. I followed the recipe exactly and at this point in the process I must say, I'm not thrilled with the taste. I will agree with other user reviews that the tomato paste is too overpowering. If I were to make this again I would definitely use a chopped tomato in lieu of the paste. The sauce tasted very acidic. I sprinkled and mixed some baking soda into the crock pot, as well as about 2-3 teaspoons of sugar to take down the acidity. It definitely helped, but I still wasn't in love with it. I love Indian food and was really excited for this recipe; Sorry to say, next time I'll have to pass on this one :(

This turned out really nice.  It makes a lot of chicken and sauce, but it is so easy and good that it's worth it.  I was a little worried about the coconut milk and the yogurt being gross in the crock pot but it turned out fantastic.  I made my own Tandoori Masala bc I didn't have any; I used a recipe from an Indian website.  I don't have cardamom pods, so I used 1/2 tspn of cardamom.  I probably could've used more, but cardamom is a pretty distinctive flavor so I didn't want to overdo it.  This is really nice served over rice and I bet it would be nice with naan too.  thanks for the recipe!

I made some tandoori masala for the recipe, but had no ground fenugreek or ground cardamom to add to the mixture (did have cardamom pods, 15, in the crockpot in a loose tea holder).  I used about 3 lb. chicken breasts, added 2 cans of drained chick peas, and about 1 tsp. freshly zested ginger to the cooking chicken.  Used low cal coconut milk, and will add 1 c. whole fat greek yogurt/salt just before it's done.

This recipe is fantastic! I will definitely be making it again. I had some trouble finding tandoori masala in the stores near me, when it occurred to me that I could buy a box of “tandoori meat rub” and that would do the trick. Next time I may collect the ingredients to make my own tandoori masala spice from a recipe here on Allrecipes. I may also omit the curry paste next time. I found the sauce only mildly spicy, but since I have some reflux problems, I could cut the heat a little. My kitchen currently smells divine!

This was very very flavorful. I tried to up the curry heat a bit but it was still not too hot. Pretty much followed the directions. I was amazed I had all the ingredients but yogurt and tomato paste. Which I dutifully got the next time I shopped. Plain Greek yogurt ups the protein level and fat free works great. It's a game changer.  I used thighs and they came out muy moist. I'm sure it will make a great couple lunches for my 100 year old Dad. His assisted living place never serves spicy Indian food.

This was delicious.  Not a lot of ingredients like there usually is in Indian food.  It was simple and delicious.  I didn't have yogurt on hand so I used sour cream.  It was excellent.  My husband said "that recipe is a keeper."

When I made this I was not impressed. I added fengreek and chilli powder for more athentic taist. After looking thru the recipe again I realized there were a little butter in it. I finished the sauce with 1/2 lb of butter. This made it edible but I may up it to 3/4 to 1 lb to finish next time.

This is almost exactly what I do for my butter chicken recipe. I usually don't use any vegetable oil and use all butter. Sometimes I omit the cardamom pods if I can't get to the specialty grocery. Still delicious.

I will make this again! Not the absolute best butter chicken I have ever tasted, but I can’t afford to go to the Northgate Saffron Grill in Seattle as often as I would like to have butter chicken, so I’m happy. I did serve this with jasmine rice  spiced lightly with saffron, and Major Grey’s Mango Chutney.—- good dinner! Looking forward to leftovers.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! I make it just as is but add golden raisins to it and use ground cardamon instead of the pods. I serve it over Jasmine rice with butter/garlic naan. Yum!

This was an instant favorite!  The prep time was lengthened by sewing the cardamon pods together (I did not have any cheese cloth) but well worth it.  The rest of the prep time was brief.  It needed only 3 hours in the crock pot (vintage 1974; does that matter?) and excellent over basmati rice and with spicy bok choi as a side.  I usually goof with recipes a bit but did not touch this one; good thing...

This recipe was good but surprisingly bland. Don't forget to salt/pepper your chicken thighs or breasts beforehand. This is not spicy at all, so I recommend adding red pepper flakes to bring some heat to the dish. I also added some lime juice (about a tablespoon or 2) to give it some zhuzh. Instead of using cardamom pods, I used cardamom powder which was easier/tasted good.

Need to buy a few spices I didn't have, but will be making this again, so the will not go to waste. Instead of sawing the cardamom pods together I used a disposable muslin tea bag worked awesome!

Definitely the best slow-cooker indian food I've made! I've been making a different Butter Chicken recipe for years, and I liked this one just about as much.
That said, it lacks acidity. It needs more tomato...I blended about a cup of cherry tomatoes and it made a big difference. I'd recommend adding a can of diced tomatoes or adding 1-2 cups of blended tomatoes.
Also it's a little on the bland side depending on your tastes, so you can kind of just over-do all of your spices and it perks it up a bit.

This was surprisingly easy and very good, I actually skipped the crockpot and just simmered it on the stove for about 30-40 minutes.  I used lite coconut milk and made my own spice blends since I had most of the ingredients.  The teenaged boy liked it also which is a plus.  It makes a ton of sauce - I used 2lbs of chicken, and honestly I'd up it next time to 3 lbs - hated to waste any of the yummy sauce.

Excellent flavors, made as is. Added the suggestion of ginger, extra chicken and added yogurt last hour of cooking. A little spicy. Next time I'll decrease the cayenne,  and keep the chili paste as is

Good but I didn’t follow directions exactly...I doubled the recipe and didn’t have tomato paste so used tomatoe sauce (think paste would’ve been better)  and I had thrown everything  in the crock pot without cooking spices and onions, etc in the pan first. It was little bland (may have been since I didn’t cook in pan first?) even though bumped up spices 50%. There is a lot of extra sauce...put that in the fridge and the next day put more tandoori spice and salt in pan with a little oil and heated a few minutes, the added cubes of tofu and fried, added another chopped onion and cubed potatoe, cooked until onions starting to carmelize, then added a can of diced tomatoes, frozen peas and carrots, simmered about 20 minutes and it was delicious 2nd meal.

Amazingly simple and delicious!  I had all the spices, so it was easy to make.  Used cardamom powder rather than pods and came out fine.  Refrigerated and served the next day was even better.

We loved it. I skipped the cardamom pods (couldn’t find) and stirred in some fresh spinach and frozen peas a few minutes before serving. I used chicken breasts since that’s what I had in hand.   Very rich!

I am writing this review based on the recipe almost as is. The only difference is that I used ground cardamom at a 1/4 teaspoon to 5 pod ratio since I didn't have the pods. As others have mentioned, the dish is a bit bland. When I was doing the prep work on the stove, it seemed that the dish would be well spiced based on the aroma. However, when it was served at the end, it was just there. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce looked like it was supposed to. However, it was only ok, even while increasing the salt. Next time I think I'm going to try adding a chicken bullion cube or something else.

Wonderful  flavour.  I couldn’t find Tandoori Masala at my local grocery store so I looked up the spice mix and made my own with cumin, coriander, garlic powder, cloves and ginger.

We've tried quite a few Butter Chicken recipes and this one is the best we've had. It is very easy to adjust the spicy-ness to whatever you desire

There are tons of butter chicken crockpot recipes on the internet.  I have tried many of them.  From NYT Cooking, well known food bloggers, etc., etc., etc.  None of them compare to this recipe.  It is the best.  For those of you who think its bland, you just need to add a little more salt.  This recipe kicks that butter chicken craving in the arse.  Recommended!

Super yummy! The only downside was that I could not find the tandoori masala spice at my local grocery store. I added some turmeric and did a another teaspoon of the garam masala and it turned out awesome! I paired with some basmati rice and some naan.

First time making Indian food after falling in love with this dish at our local restaurant. I encountered a few problems due to my complete inexperience.
     1st - getting the masala required going to a specialized spice store, but even they did not carry curry paste. I bought a curry "sauce" at the local grocery marked mild and it seems to be fine, though I would guess it is not as thick as paste. 
     2nd- didn't know if I should use regular or unsweetened coconut milk. I read a review which suggested it could use a little sugar, so I picked the regular. 
     3rd- as it was cooking I LOVED the smell, but the taste was not quite the same. Then I noticed the "salt to taste" direction, which I had omitted due to lack of clarity. Once I added this (about 1- 1.5 tsp) I was VERY surprised to find what a difference it made. It went from a mild, slightly sweet dish to the savory irresistible one I fell in love with. Thank you for this wonderful recipe & for bringing the wide world that much closer to home!

Excellent recipe. I am atypical and like more spice so I upped the curry paste I put in and used a thai red curry so it really has a jump to it. Super easy recipe. Literally throw it all in and walk away. make the final additions and boom!

I did this as a make ahead meal - I cooked the onions, garlic tomato sauce, spices and chicken and froze it. We thawed before adding it to the slow cooker with the yogurt and coconut milk and it was a great midweek work meal. Definitely making again but making much more for freezing for easy slow cooker meals.

I made this almost to a T. Minor changes were: fresh tomatoes rather than canned paste, 3 chicken breasts, 1/2 a jalepeno, a tbsp of blanched almonds ground up, used 10 cardamon pods instead of 15 b/c that's what I had on hand. Didn't have yogurt so I left it out.

It was done at 3 hours in the slow cooker on high. The chicken was deliciously tender!! The con was it was quite watery and seemed to lack some flavour, so I let it reduce on the stovetop for a couple hours (without the chicken). Very tasty after that!!

It turned out great! I wanted to make an Indian dish for my step daughter, who is half Indian. Exposure to her culture and such etc. I think she liked it, but I sure did! (I could not read her mother)

I did not make any substitutions.  The flavor was good but was definitely missing something.  I thought it was a little on the bland side.

Really good! Of course, I made some substitutions...chicken breast in place of thighs, sour cream in place of yogurt (I had no plain yogurt), added 1/4 t. chili powder and cooked on the stovetop as another reviewer did. Delicious!

This was great.  We had this with rice, a salad and homemade naan from this site. I used chicken breast instead of thighs.  I also didn't have time to slow cook it and making it in a skillet sped things up.  We will have this again.

For all those spices, the flavor was pretty bland. I might try it again with double the spices and see if that helps.

A family favourite!!  We like to use about 1.5lbs of chicken breast (as my youngest doesn't like chicken thigh) and add fenugreek and chili powder as someone else suggested. I also cook it on the stove top for about 20 minutes as was suggested by someone else. We like it on basmati rice with Naan Like Easy Flatbread (I found on this site as well).

Five star as written, however I did make changes.
I was out of tomato paste so I used my mixer wand to puree a can of diced tomatoes and drained off as much liquid as possible.  I used dried minced onion instead of sautéed since I was skipping the stovetop step.
Because I absolutely loath overcooked chicken, I chose to slow cook the thighs whole so I could use a meat thermometer.
I whisked together all of the ingredients in the cooker then submerged the chicken.
In my cooker (maybe it runs hot?), the chicken reached 165 in less than 3 hours on low.  I can't imagine cooking small pieces for 8 hours.
I am taking this to Grandma's for Sunday dinner this week.

I thought this was fantastic. I did not find it bland at, all as some other people mentioned. I did "toast" the dry spices first (in the microwave), which I have learned is very important in bringing out their flavor. I used cheesecloth and string for the cardamom pods so I could make a little bundle that could easily be removed. The only other change was I used full-fat yogurt. Delicious!

I've used this recipe many times. I've added a few ingredients throughout my process.  First I add equal parts ginger to garlic, sauteeing the ginger at the same time as the garlic. I also add 1 tsp fenugreek leaves and 1/4 tsp of chili powder (depending on the heat of the curry I've added) I omit the yogurt until just before serving ( I tend not to add it since I feel the recipe is rich enough with the coconut milk)

I doubled the recipe and simmered it on the stove as my slow cooker was a tad small. In the final hour or so, I added cauliflower and some frozen peas. Served it with some basmati rice and some garlic naan. Everyone loved it. This one's a keeper.

Only changes I made were the following:  I could not find tandoori masala in the store, so I used more of the garam instead.  Also, I used red curry paste since I had it on hand.

V tasty. I chucked it all raw in the slow cooker & let it do the rest while I was at work. Took the lid off toward the end and put on high to reduce the sauce. Substituted lactose free yoghurt for hubby. Didn’t add the salt as all those pastes have some but did probably need some in hindsight. I used tandoori paste and butter chicken pastes (Pataks or Sharwood’s)..

I followed the recipe completely and it was fantastic. I have made 3 times in the past 10 days. The family love it and say it’s even better than the Indian restaurants in our area. It is definitely one of our favorites and very easy to make.

I live in a fairly good size town. I spent 2 hours trying to find cardamon pods. Not available. Had to approximate and use powder. Either way, it lacked the unctuous background notes of true Indian butter chicken.

This is the best Butter Chicken I have ever made.  It is as good as any I've ever had in an Indian restaurant.  My daughter asked that this recipe become a part of our monthly rotation.

The prep time is about one hour (45 minutes to measure the ingredients and cut the chicken, the onion and crush the garlic, and then 15 minutes of cooking prior to putting it in the slow cooker).

I was pleased with how quickly this came together.  It took me less than 30 minutes to get it in the slow cooker, and considering there are no finishing steps on the tail end, that seems like a reasonable time for making dinner. I didn't have tandoori masala, so used an extra tsp of garam and put in 1/2 tsp each of powdered ginger and garlic. I also used half thighs and half breasts, which I thought worked out well (the breasts didn't dry out at all). After cooking for a while, I tasted it and was disappointed. The flavor seemed disjointed and lacking. However, after adding about 2 tsp of salt and 1 tbsp of sugar, it tasted much more like butter chicken at a restaurant. So don't give up hope if you feel like it's lacking flavor. It still lacked a certain something for me, but as I didn't have the tandoori masala, I'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt. If I were to make it again, I would make sure to have the tandoori masala and might try toasting the spice mixture before adding it to the skillet.

My husband and I are big fans of butter chicken.  It is so nice to have found a slow-cooker recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  We will definitely be making this many times in the future!

So ridiculously good! I did all the spices in heaping proportions as we like lots of flavor. I also didn’t use the slow cooker, just simmered on the stove top.

I made this and, while a healthier version, it was not creamy enough to counter the tomato so I did end up adding 1 cup heavy cream.

This was nice. It was missing something though. I can't put my finger on it.  I think I will add some sweet potato next time to give some sweetness.

Surprised at how good this turned out in the end! It was definitely a big hit. My husband said it was restaurant quality. Will definitely make again. FYI I had to substitute ground cardamom cuz couldn’t find pods and only used masala garam cuz couldn’t find masala tandoori. Tasted great to us anyway. Next time will use the masala tandoori too cuz found it later.

A bit disappointing  I loved it last time I made it. I t was delicious. But this time it was OK but not marvelous  The only thing I did differently was to use both breasts and thighs while before I used only thighs. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise Hmmmm?  I will give it another try using thighs only.

Easy to make; I added far more spices as some reviewers noted.  Made in about 4 hours in the crock pot, 3 on high and one on low.  Saved it for the next night dinner and sauces soaked in  nicely; MUCH better the next day.  Thank you for the recipe.

My family told me this was better than any restaurant. And I have two professional chef's in my family. I had to make my own tandoori masala which was easy and beneficial to get to make it to my liking. I actually made this in my Dutch oven on the stove top instead of using the slow cooker and it still turned out wonderful. If you can't find tandoori masala just google it and combine the spices to make it on your own. Thank you so much for this recipe, my family requested that it becomes a regularly made dinner. I am grateful!

Family enjoyed. I did make some substitutions-my version was much higher in calories I'm afraid. I used heavy cream instead of coconut milk-an Indian friend said she always uses cream, and it was what I had on hand. Used regular yogurt, not low-fat. Also what I used was ginger garlic paste and not curry paste. I had garam masala but no Tandoori masala. My friend said the main reason for the Tandoori masala in this dish is the red color, so she suggested just adding a drop of red food coloring to the garam masala. I added several drops, but that's OK. My teenage son loved this dish.

Made it a few times, we love it, easy to prep and cooks while I am at work.

As a tip, I put the cardamom seeds in a tea ball for easy extraction without all the tediousness of threading them.

This was a big hit at our house. I had to buy some spices which I had never used before, although I make quite a lot of curries. My teacher is a Sri Lankan friend, and Indian cooking is really quite different. I will absolutely make it again.

I love this recipe!  I made this and sent a bowl of leftovers to my Indian friend.  Her mom was visiting from India and said it tastes just like her butter chicken!  Score!  My 17 year old son requested this again, so I'm making it again for tonight!

This is so good! I did cut the tomato paste in half, and I thought that was just right. I also used a little extra butter and didn't use the oil as specified. I had fresh Indian spices and I thought it was quite spicy! My hubby added red pepper flakes to make it more spicy for him. Yum! Thank you! . I'm definitely going to make this again!

5/16/17 - rated 4 stars (not yet eaten).  Prepped everything (except yogurt) and put in crock pot to start cooking this am - used 1 tsp red and 1 tsp yellow curry, didn't have the tandoori masala or the cardamom seeds, and added 1 tbsp. of ginger, 1 tbsp. of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of fenugreek per other reviewers.  Adding yogurt when I get home just prior to serving over egg noodles.  Flavor was good but next time I'd add in a shake of red pepper flakes and/or use all red curry - good recipe but I like more spice!

This was so good! I threw a 1" piece of minced ginger and a chopped jalapeno into that first step. I didn't have tandoori masala but used a tsp of ground fenugreek instead. Will definitely make this again.

I used 2 chicken breasts and reduced the coconut milk to 7oz.  Unfortunately, I didn't decrease the yogurt as well, so it was a bit to tangy.  Also, forgot to add the cardamon.  Next time, I'll try to follow the recipe and hopefully it will turn out better.

I watch calories closely, but this only needed minor tweaking and retained it's authentic flavour. I used margerine instead of butter ( skipped the oil ). No salt added tomatoes, fat free sour cream instead of yogurt. Light coconut milk. Was awesome! Friends request this recipe all the time!

I made this dish which is a favorite of my wife when we go to Indian restaurants. Initially, I wasn't going to brown the chicken and onions but after reviewing the recipe s written by some Indian cooks and food bloggers I felt this was an important step in cooking to extract as much flavor from the ingredients. I did a 2 step marination that I found and used thighs with the bones. Basically a lemon juice,salt and paprika for 15-20 min., then marinated in plain yogurt and some tandoori masala overnight. I did my 2 days, since couldn't cook the dish until later. To prevent any possible curdling of the coconut milk and yogurt. I whisked  them together prior to cooking. I added a dried red chili pepper, then cooked for 5 hours. Served some jeera rice and naan. Needles to say, my wife loved it.

The onion I had was rotten, so I had to skip it, and I had chicken breasts, not thighs. I could not find Tandoori Masala (at the local Asian market or Walmart), so I made my own (minus the fenugreek and mace which I could not find). I also couldn't find any cardamom pods, so I just used about a tablespoon of ground. I increased the red curry paste by 1/2 tablespoon. I deviated slightly from the instructions. Instead of a large skillet, I sauteed the chicken and garlic in a stock pot. Then, instead of transferring it all to a crock pot (why mess up another pan?), I just put the lid on the stock pot and simmered it on the stove for about 4 hours. The aroma was wonderful, and it tasted just as good. There was plenty of sauce to pour over rice and zucchini that I served it with.

This is the first time I have written a review but I read the reviews before I make anything so I thought I should contribute.
This was excellent. I followed other peoples suggestions and added a bit of lemon juice, ginger and chili powder. I made the tandoori masala following the recipe in allrecipes.com I can't wait to try some other Indian recipes and I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out almost inedible.  Acid level was super high, which I attribute to the tomato paste.  I tried adding some sugar and salt to mitigate that but it didn't help.  I won't make this version again.

I will give this recipe 5 stars with the adjustments I made - I used ghee instead of butter and added about 1 tbsp of fresh minced ginger to the garlic, onion, chicken part. I also broke a 2" piece of cinnamon stick in a few pieces and added when the cardamom pods went in. I added the yogurt at the end just before serving as well.

I made significant changes to the method of this dish and it came out perfect.  First I used bone in, skin-on chicken thighs, whole milk yogurt and added a few Fenugreek seeds and chili powder to taste.  I sauteed the onions in the butter and oil, added the garlic after the onions where translucent to prevent burning and then added the spices as directed.  I let the spices cook a few minutes, added the tomato paste and coconut milk to the skillet to combine and then put the sauce mixture in the crock pot.  After a quick wipe out of the skilled I added butter and oil again got it hot and browned the whole chicken thighs on all sides before placing them into the crock pot and sauce.  The thighs will cook through in the crock pot and come out tender, moist and delicious.  I cooked on high for three hours as I started late in the afternoon.  Served with basmati rice and homemade naan.  If you precook diced chicken in the skillet it will cook through and then get dry in the crock pot.  Using the thighs whole with the bones and skin adds more flavor and saves the meat from overcooking.  Plus I can't be bothered to bone, skin and cut up the chicken.  My family loved it!

Used chicken drumsticks instead. Didn't have tandoori masala or curry paste, added some ginger and tumeric and felt it came out more like a curry. Regardless, it was amazing. The flavor and aroma was excellent. Can't wait for the leftovers. Will make this a regular menu item.

Yum!! I used cardamom powder instead of pods. I also use matsaman curry paste. Amazing dish served over rice! I usually serve with naan bread and steamed broccoli. My whole family loves this (including my 2 and 3 year olds!). We make this on a monthly basis at minimum.

Do not substitute tomatoes for tomato paste!! Tomato paste is a thickening agent while fresh tomatoes produce a HUGE amount of water and make your curry miserably watery. The meat, though flavorful, came out super dry after 4 hours on high.

As written, for me this recipe was missing something and just fell flat.  As other reviewers did/suggested, I added some additional spices and increased the quantity of the ones in the recipe.  I added salt, red (cayenne) pepper, dried fenugreek leaves and turmeric.  I  doubled this recipe and made it on the stove-top and used one can regular and one can light coconut milk.  I think it was missing some of the richness from that 2nd light can and I ended up stirring in a heaping spoonful of coconut oil.  This combined with the added spices really kicked it up a notch and my whole family loved it.

This recipe came together fairly simply, and had a warm, mild flavor.  I made the curry paste and tandoori masala myself, which may have altered the flavor somewhat (for better or for worse).  The recipe seemed fairly forgiving.  For example, I added the yogurt only during the last hour of cooking, and the dish didn't seem to suffer for it at all.  Went well with both rice and naan.

Loved this, so easy to make, and nice to have it in the slow cooker.  I couldn't buy tandoori masala in our town, so I made it from a recipe I found on here, and used 1/2 tsp cardamom  instead of pods.  Will be making this one often .

This is fantastic - my family loved it! I use ground cardamom instead of pods, and it worked well. I like to dump a small bag of defrosted frozen peas in for the last 30 minutes to make a one-dish meal.

This is s great base recipe. I'm Asian Indian and butter chicken is one of my favorite dishes. This is my first time making it in the slow cooker, and with a few modifications, it was awesome! I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and doubled all the spices to give it an extra kick. I didn't add the cardamom and I didn't miss it. After it cooled down a bit, I added chopped cilantro leaves. It tastes significantly better the next day, so it is worth waiting a day to eat it. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was awesome!  I love chicken masala, but am pretty unfamiliar with some of the spices.  I couldn't find cardamom pods, so I used the powder (about 3 tbls).  I also couldn't find tandoori masala, so I followed a reviewer's recipe to make it (minus the mace, which I didn't have).  I otherwise followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was super tender and moist just like the restaurants.  One family member doesn't like spicy, so I didn't take it as hot as I would've liked.  If you make it and find that it needs a kick, I ended up smearing some extra curry paste on my plate before plating my dish and mixed it in with the chicken/sauce.  Simply wonderful - thanks for the recipe!

Great. easy.  I used chicken breast and it was dry.  try thighs next time.  I also just threw evening in the crock pot. no cooking at the beginning.  onions didn't quite soften up as expected.  even the leftovers got eaten up.

Have made this several times.  I tend to add more curry and Garam masala.  Love this with rice.  The aroma is exquisite.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious, I skipped the first section of frying off the chicken onions and spices and just threw it all in the slow cooker from the start.. the chicken and onions with cooked beautifully, and the flavour will have been released into the whole dish..

I thought it was easy enough to make, but I agree with some of the reviews here. For the amount of delicious and exotic ingredients in this recipe...it lacked depth for me. I added some lemon juice and way more salt that it called for. It was a good test for making indian in a slow cooker. I think I'll likely stick to my stove top tikka masala recipe that takes way more time and effort, but the flavor is undeniably better.

Great version of butter chicken! It does need some heat, so we added Cayenne pepper to taste. We also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. To cut down on starch/carbs, we served it over cauliflower rice (finely chopped cauliflower steamed with broth). Will definitely make again!

Good dish with authentic flavor! I made the tandoori spices using the recipe someone else provided in the comments - though I didn't have some of the Indian spices, so they were omitted. I also used chicken breast which I pounded thin & cut into chunks - this created a perfect texture. I used 2 lb, but feel I could've put in another pound easily. I cooked on high for 3 hours & low the 4th. Next time I think I'll hit low after the 2nd hour as it was getting a tad dry. I'll also add more spice next time. It was good, but could've been more powerful. It took me quite a while to make since I pounded the chicken & added the individual spices for tandoori, but I'll definitely be making this again!

So delicious. I made this in the middle of a busy day which meant I had to make a lot of modifications. I ran out of curry powder so I made some from a recipe on here. I didn't have cardamom so I left it out.  I also didn't have yogurt until the last 30 minutes of cooking. Besides all of that, it turned out wonderfully! So good over rice and naan. It may have been my slow cooker, but when I left it on high for 4 hours, I came back to one side being burned.

I love this recipe - but better.... my family did, too!  Didn't change a thing about the spices / key things.  I have added garbanzo beans / cauliflower / eggplant -- just because everything tastes good in the sauce.  I have made it several times now and will make it many more times.

I made this recipe as written except that I could not find cardamom pods locally, so I used ground instead.  It was WONDERFUL.  My yogurt (plain Greek) did NOT curdle.  Only thing I may change in the future is to decrease the amount of tomato paste and to add some mushrooms to the recipe.  Thank you---we loved it!

Tastes almost as good as restaurant Indian food, mild spiciness. Made the recipe as is, except for the following: excluded the veg. oil (used olive oil), added 1 tsp fenugreek leaves, 1/4 tsp chili powder, and doubled the cardamom pods (30 pods),  and 1/2 to 1 tsp salt, and 2-3 chicken breast halves (about 1.5 lbs). I also used Thai kitchen green curry paste. I cooked it in crockpot on high for 3.5 to 4 hrs. Try adding yogurt toward end of cooking, since the heat made the consistency a little grainy.

I've made this maybe 5 or 6 times. I included the cardamom pods the first time but have just left them out since then. I find it VERY saucy (maybe my crockpot doesn't allow as much evaporation as others?). I usually use a bulk/family package of chicken thighs and double the ingredients except the coconut milk and yogurt. Definitely a family favourite and well-received at potlucks!

When cooked on High, some of the sauce burned on the sides of my slow cooker, giving the entire dish a nasty charred flavor.  I won't be making this again.

My son who loves Indian food thought it was great! Only change I made was that I substituted some cardamom for the pods. Made a Yellow Indian Rice recipe to go with it.

The plain yogurt to just overwhelmed all other flavors.  I was SO excited to make this recipe - even went out and bought specialty spices like - tandoori masala & cardamome pods. The yogurt just made this butter chicken dish BLAND. On the plus side I did really enjoy all the spices, will just continue looking for the perfect recipe, because this one just didn't do it for me. :(

This was pretty darn good, and much better the next day. I also wish I'd gone the 8 hours on low rather than 4 on high...my chicken just wasn't as soft as I'd have liked. Great flavors. Definitely go for full-fat coconut milk! I also ended up adding sour cream to my bowl right before eating. It added a nice tang. Tandoori masala is hard to find- I had to hit three stores! Ended up getting some made by Urban Accents. Also just avoided the cardamom pods as I ate :)

We enjoyed this the first time I made it, but I did think it lacked a bit of the kick I enjoy from Indian food.  I have added a can of crushed tomatoes, and 2 fresh jalapenos, as well as slightly increasing the salt, adding a bit of cayenne, and a little more of the masalas and curry powder.  With just this little bit of extra work, we liked it even better!  I also use plain Greek yogurt, which gives it just a little creamier texture and a bit more tartness than regular yogurt.  Most of my modification ideas come from a recipe my mom brought home from New Zealand, so I can't claim great originality, but the fusion of the two recipes yields an easy, delicious version that I'm about to make for my birthday dinner!

This is very good! My husband, from Nepal, can't get enough of this. He says it is just like what they serve in (good) Indian restaurants... I'd have to agree. I didn't have any curry paste on hand, so I substituted with tandoori paste and used lots of curry powder. I also used cardomom powder instead of the whole spice. Good stuff!

I didn't have the time and made this in my large 12" skillet on the stove top. Didn't have cardamom pods so did without.  Next time I may add more chicken or less liquid. There was definitely plenty of sauce for the rice. It was better the next day after spices got to marry more. My Curry Paste was of a Thai variety.  IDK if its different from one I'd find in an Indian market, but I added extra to heat it up a bit more.

This is amazing. We made no changes!  Perfect!  The flavored are amazing but when you add to rice it looses the flavor a bit so you may need to lightly salt.  We all licked our plates!  Wow!

I've made this specific recipe a dozen times, each with great success.  

The first time I made it, my family gobbled it up so I always double the recipe.  It is great the first time serving but even better when rewarmed as leftovers.  I agree that it is a little labor intensive for a slow cooker recipe but is incredible!  The long simmering time really adds to the flavor.   You can cook on the stove-top if in a hurry though.  

I usually add the yogurt (been using fage brand) during the last hour.  I find that it curdles if added in the beginning.  

Finding the spices locally can be difficult, look online at Indian grocery retailers.  

Great when served w/ basmati rice, mango chutney, and naan.  "All Recipes" has a great naan recipe which is super simple and my kids love helping me with it.

This is one of my favorite dishes and this recipe makes it much simpler than others I have tried. The flavors are all there.The only problem with this recipe is that my family loves it so much I need to double or triple the recipe. We do make it with Chicken breasts instead of thighs. This is now a regular in rotation.  It is simply WONDERFUL.

So good and fairly simple! We loved the blend of spices and ate this with jasmine rice. We will definitely be making this again.

This was a great meal. I doubled the recipe to use the chicken I had so there were a lot of leftovers! The dish was deemed too spicy by my 5 year old so if your making this for kids be advised to adjust the spiciness. Next time I will use the recommended needle and thread for the cardamon seeds. All in all very yummy!

Prep is definitely longer than 15 minutes though!

I made it just as written, though I used more chicken, and it was fantastic! The flavor is mellow until you get the little kick of heat from the spices.

Disappointing. The flavor was a little flat and the consistency was mushy. Could have been the curry powder I used? Won't be making it again.

There is definitely a flavor missing. Doesn't come close to restaurant standards. Needs some decent salt, maybe a dash of sugar. I wouldn't again cut the pieces to recommended size above - falls apart too easily at that size and it becomes more soup like.

Absolutely AMAZING!!! Finally a delicious Indian dish that is spicy but not hot. I had given up on butter chicken because I prepared it using a sauce that came out of a jar and quite frankly, we found it to be rather flavorless. This recipe was well worth the trip across town to purchase the spices I needed. While at the store I picked up some frozen naan. Not as good as the naan my daughter makes using a recipe from this website, but much better than some other naan I once purchased that wasn't frozen.

We love Indian food and I was quite skeptical about this recipe since I didn't think I could ever make a successful dish that tasted like the restaurant food I love.  Well, I was wrong.  This is now an oft-requested family favorite.  It smells good from the moment you put it in the skillet and then all day long.  I can barely keep my family out of the crockpot.  We fight over the leftovers and that's another way I judge the success of a recipe.  So glad to have found this!

This was pretty good but a little bland, I think some of this is due to the curry paste I picked from among the MANY options available. I also couldn't find green cardamom pods so I used powdered instead and may have gone a little light. I'll make this again but will tweak it a little.

I made this for my family last night and it was delicious. I rated it 4 stars because I used a mild curry paste, and I felt it needed a bit more heat. That being said my kids ate every bite. If I had made it more spicy then they wouldn't have eaten it. I read the reviews and made my own tandoori masala, left out the cardamom pods because I didn't have them in the pantry and I added the yoghurt just before serving. I served it with long grain rice and naan bread. Perfect!

Thank you loved the recipe ,cooked all the spices in the butter and oil for a minute on top of the stove in a  large pan, i included a teaspoon of chilli powder only i like mine hotter ,then added the onions garlic and chicken, cooked for another few minutes till onions were soft and chicken was coated in spices .Used a tin of tomato sauce instead of the paste only i think the paste makes it bitter .Gradually added coconut milk and 1/2 cup of yogurt .Cooked on simmer for about 15 mins or to desired doneness  ,added salt to taste .Served with basmati rice and homemade naan bread ,onion chutney and poppadoms. Loved it and so did my husband and he is very fussy when it comes to indian food .So great job loved it .

Truly exceptional recipe. 
Very simple fire and forget type of recipe.
Mix ingredients put it on slow cooker and after 4 hrs dish is done.
Everyone loved it.
I am afraid you would not go to indian restaurants once you have tried this recipe.
I made couple of changes. I added 2-3 tb spoons of dried kasoori methi.
Reduced yogurt and added some lite sour cream ( i do not know why).

This smells DELICIOUS when cooking.  It's just that it's a bit bland, but nothing that a little sriracha can't fix.  I followed the recipe (pretty much, add me to the group that doesn't think that slow cooker cooking should dirty extra dishes, so I just threw all the ingredients into the slow cooker).  I am not a huge fan of cardamom, so I lowered the pods to 10 and it was still a bit overwhelming.  I didn't add the yogurt until the last 30 minutes (when I turned the slow cooker to warm).  I will definitely add it to my slow cooker recipes because it is tasty and easy.

This is really yummy!  I made it on the stove top this time.  I used 1/2 of a can of blended diced tomatoes, added a little more curry powder and graham masala and at the end I took some of the sauce and added about 1/2 tsp of glucammanon powder to thicken it in the blender.

This was a great recipe. I'll definitely be making this one again. It was my first attempt at Indian food and it really turned out great. The only reason I knocked a star was because I had to go through a lot of trouble to find all of the ingredients. I substituted a few ingredients based on what I was able to locate.

I considered giving this 4 stars because the taste was slightly off, but it gets bonus points for how incredibly easy it is. Everyone else said the taste was perfect.
I'll be making this again.

I've had amazing butter chicken at the Indian restaurants here in Nor Cal.  So, my standards are probably high. I think cooking in the crock pot is just too much cooking for this dish.  You could easily make this stove top with the same results.  It is definitely missing something.  I added fenugreek powder which is a MUST add.  I also think it needs more spice, possibly with cayenne.  I also favored the flavor before adding the yogurt.  So, I would either omit it completely or decrease the quantity.  I think taking this recipe along with others I've found will potentially make a great butter chicken.  OR, just order Indian take out.

Delicious, but not what I think of as butter chicken. This recipe is still really good, although the chicken came out a little dry and the cardamom flavor was a little overpowering. I followed the recipe, but used chicken breasts and cooked it on low for 6 hours. Perhaps the chicken would've been less dry if I had cooked it on high for less time.

Great recipe! Time intensive to start with (about 15 minutes to prepare for crock pot), but well worth the effort. The chicken is delicious! I served with some naan bread and basmati rice.

Flavor was great!, Aromatics were definitely there. Recipe was easy, as well.  Had to use store bought tandoori paste as the only change but it was still great. Not too spicy for the kids, either.

Not bad, but doesn't taste like any butter chicken I've ever had.  The tomato is way too strong.

Made with chicken breasts and we didn't have tandoori masala so a little improvisation there. Tasted great, just wish I'd read the cardamom tip earlier!

This is one of the first times I have made Indian food that actually tastes like it came from a restaurant! I followed what "cozycook" said and just cooked this on the stovetop and used lite coconut milk and no fat yogurt. I also added the fenugreek and chili powder as coztcook said. Delicious!!!

I have made this about 4 times now and love it. I did not use the cardamon pods only because I could not find them at my local market. It taste great without them. My 2 girls and picky husband also liked the recipe. I am going to try it with chopped tomatoes tonight instead of the paste like some have suggested.

Very flavourful(Canadian spelling! Haha!) and I found it so easy to make! I was able to throw it together quickly before I went to work and then, after a day of work followed by swimming lessons with the kids, we came home to a warm and very tasty dinner!  I too have had a love/hate with the slow cooker (the recipes I've tried tend to be bland) so this recipe will definitely be a keeper!

Great recipe. I had a fun time trying to track down all the ingredients. Throw in a can of garbanzo beans to add some variety.

I love everything about this recipe except how much cardamom you call for. Wow, it's strong with that much in there... Next time I'll use 1/4 of this amount and it should be perfect. It could also be my taste buds...who knows.

Very good, the house smelled great. I was able to find everything I needed at a local Indian grocery store and price for the spices was considerably better than my regular store. I used 2 extra chicken thighs and I am glad i did, this made a lot of sauce! I was heavy handed with the spices and the only  change I made was to add a couple shakes of cayenne because we like spicy. Will make again!! thanks for the recipe!

Amazing authentic flavor!  Took another cook's advice and made a cardamom pod "ring"--much easier than fishing out all 15 pods.  This will definitely become a staple in our house.

Excellent recipe. The only thing amendment I made was to add brown sugar to add an element of sweetness. Otherwise good to go.

The whole family loves this recipe. We have it at least twice a month in the winter months. I use more chicken than the recipe calls for--a 1.88 pound pack of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which is usually around 6-7 thighs. I also add in a little salt after it's done cooking. We eat it with rice and naan. Is it authentic? I have no idea, but we think it's delicious.
