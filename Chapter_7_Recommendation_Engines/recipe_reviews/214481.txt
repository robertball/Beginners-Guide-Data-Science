To make Ranch Dressing I used 1/4 c. nonfat plain yogurt, 1/4 c. light Mayo and 1/4 c. skim milk. Mix with 2 T of the dry mix. Store in the fridge.

This was GREAT! I made one slight change by using chopped green onion (because I usually don't have dry minced onion on hand) and followed Scotdog's directions on how to make it into a dip, only I doubled it to use 4 tbsp. of the dip mix,  1/2 c. nonfat plain yogurt, 1/2 c. FF sour cream and 1/3 c. lowfat milk. Even doubled, we inhaled this. My boys thought this was better than my Zesty Ranch Dip!!!! NOM. NOTE: For all you confused on where to find the dry buttermilk powder, it's usually with the dry milk powders on the baking aisle of your supermarket.

I’ve been dying to try this and it did not disappoint.  Found everything at Wal-Mart:  buttermilk powder in the baking isle; celery flakes with the spices.  I used this in a couple of recipes that called for ranch mix and I couldn’t tell the difference.  I also made dressing with it and it was good, but it was phenomenal the 2nd  day after the seasonings had time to meld and reach their full potential, so if at all possible, make your dressing or dip a day ahead of time.

This recipe is the closest I've encountered to a substitute for store-bought Ranch. Thank you for those who rated properly and convinced me to try this.

BTW: There is nothing more obnoxious than rating a recipe, complete with review:

for a recipe you’ve modified completely out of proportion to the original – “ooooh, we just loved this after I omitted this, added this, doubled this. . .”

for a recipe you haven’t tried – “Oh, I haven’t tried this, but I love it!”

for a recipe whose directions you didn’t follow or whose ingredients you changed or omitted – “We left out half the ingredients, and we’re sooooo disappointed with the results.”

This one has them all.  Please rate the original recipe, as is.  Your modifications shouldn’t feature into your ratings at all. You're supposed to be rating THIS one, not your version.  This certainly explains why all the recipes on here are magically 4’s & 5’s.  Not helpful at all, people.

This recipe is great. I love the idea of making my own ranch mix without the MSG. I especially like that I can tweak it to our own tastes. I like that I can tone the garlic/onion down if needed. I have made this twice now. I used my coffee grinder in order to grind up the celery flakes a bit and it worked great. The first time I mixed it with Greek yogurt, low-fat milk, and light mayo. The second time I mixed it with full fat sour cream, low-fat milk, and light mayo. I liked the yogurt version the best.  I am dipping my celery sticks in it as I type my review! Thanks so much Kelly for sharing this recipe! I will be making this often!

I tried 3 stores and couldn't find a source for buttermilk powder so I improvised by using low fat milk powder in the mix.  When I made the dressing I used fat free Greek yogurt, low fat mayo and full fat buttermilk with just a few drops of lemon juice to make sure it still was tangy.  It was great for the Rosemary Ranch chicken Kabob recipe from here.  Thanks, Kelly this is a keeper.

I'm so glad I finally found buttermilk powder! I probably quadrupled the dill, because I *knew* I'd want more and it's so good. I used some to make a buffalo chicken sandwich for lunch. YUM. I mixed this up in a little Mason jar so I could just shake it up after I added the ingredients. It looked so pretty before I mixed it that I'm thinking seriously about packing it up this way and giving it as gifts. Thank you, Scotdog! Love this stuff...

I have been looking for a Ranch Dressing/Ranch Dip mix with out MSG and all the other yucky stuff that store bought has.  This is it!  Perfectly what I wanted.  Great flavor.  I have received lots of rave reviews on all forms of this ranch.   Add less liquid (buttermilk or milk) to make it a dip or more to make it salad dressing.  I store the dry mix in the pantry until I need to whip something up.    I have also substituted celery salt for the celery flakes, and just omitted the salt.  And before I found dry buttermilk powder, I just prepared it with real buttermilk and it did the trick.

I was so excited to see this recipe.  All the great reviews gave me such high hopes for this recipe.  I am disappointed beyond words.  I thought (as did my family) it was terrible.  First off it's way too much onion.  And it was missing something,  I am not sure what yet.  It's not smooth as you would expect ranch to be.  I pulsed it in my food processor many times and the minced onion doesn't break down enough.  The chunkiness is a personal preference, but it's still way too much onion.  The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead on the original one I had, is that I am willing to try it again and put in less onion and play around with the other ingredients to see if I can make it better.  Otherwise, I just wasted money buying the buttermilk powder.

I have been making this for a couple months and never have all the spices. I finally had them all to make as written and gotta say....I'm addicted. I mix with all nonfat plain yogurt and eat it by the bowlful with tortilla chips.  The only thing that doesn't work for me is the pepper, which I halve. Great recipe to replace the packets with which I used to make my dip.UPDATE 9/13/11-I think I had an "odd" batch of pepper originally. Since replacing, I make exactly as written. I finally made the salad dressing using SD's amounts since I had some veganaisse(can't have reg. mayo) and it was much better than when I tried to make it with extra yogurt in place of the mayo. Will definitely make again.

I don't think I've ever seen dried celery flakes, so I ended up using 1/4 t. celery salt.  That was a bit much so I may reduce that further, or use a bit of celery seed.  I had to experiment a bit.  I've only made dressing out of it.  Used it on a pasta salad, which I thought was bland, and wasn't sure what to blame.  So I used it on a chicken recipe I'd already made and the dressing I'm happy to say was fine.  (It was the salad's fault. :-))  There is a slight difference in flavor from the packaged, and I haven't quite put my finger on what, but it's close and does taste like ranch.  This is about half as flavorful as the packaged kind, but the volume is twice which makes up for it.  So treating this as one regular package works.  For anything calling for dry mix, I'd use double the volume of this.  For dressing, about a 1:4 ratio with whatever "gunk" used works pretty well.  That is, like 1/4 cup of the mix and 1 cup of gunk - for dressing that's 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. milk and then let it sit in the fridge a bit.   (Haven't used it as a dip yet.)  I like that I can make up just enough to use for a recipe.  As a side note, it says to store in a cool dry place, but my buttermilk mix requires refrigeration so this would too.

What can I say......THE DRY MIX IS EXCELLENT!!!! I can't believe wow. I used my ninja processor and polverized it finer because of the celery flakes. And well the powder mix tasted great on my fingers. I bet I could add some zest and make some home made ranch toritilla chips...yum! I also when making it into dressing took SD's notes and found it was soo nice, a little thinner then bottled Hidden Valley but soo comparible to Kraft verison. I bought Dannon's Greek Yogurt and matched up the mayo to the little 5.3oz container yogurt and used 1/3 cup of milk with the 2 heaping tbsp of the mix and I had what I thought was as close to Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing. My daughter thought I was joking when I told her I made it, and she was stunned...we did a taste test with the bottle and this verison...and it was pretty darn close. I think 1 batch of the mix makes 2 batches of dressing...O SD!!!!! Thanks you for your recipe and the suggestions on how to make it into dressing....I'm soo keeping this. I always have the ingredients on hand....TOTAL HUGS!!! Thanks! You Rock!.

Thought that I should have rated this since I have been using for 6 months now.  I just love this Ranch Mix.....Use to make chip dip, use in mashed potatoes and use in a soup recipe that calls for ranch dip.  I keep plenty on hand for whenever a recipe might call for it.  This mix is great.....

Ran all the ingredients through my food processor until they were powdered, like in store packets.  Made a double batch which I keep in an old glass jar, for burgers, fries, dressing, dip, etc.  Great idea and great flavor.

I made this recipe today.  I didn't have celery flakes so I used celery seeds (using equivalent 1 tsp celery flakes= 1/8 tsp celery seeds). Two 0.8 oz packets Saco Buttermilk mix = 3/8c powder.  I made 1.5 recipe.  I put it in my mini cuisinart to make a fine powder.  This stuff tastes amazing!   DH said it is better than the store bought powder-- no sugary taste.   I used my kitchen scale to measure 2oz for Alabama fire crackers.   Thank you for sharing this recipe Scotdog!

A recipe for an appetizer called for a store-bought packet of Ranch dip mix.  Since one of my guests is allergic to MSG, I often struggle to find a way to get the ranch flavor into that appetizer without the MSG.  After just one try, this recipe is my new go-to recipe.  I will always use this over the store-bought packets, even when that friend will not be around.  The flavor is so much better than the store-bought mix.  I did add a bit extra salt, but it was not necessary, and in the future I will do it exactly as written.  My conversion ratio was four tablespoons of this mix in place of one packet of store-bought dip, and it turned out much more flavorful than was necessary, so in the future, I will probably use two or three tablespoons.

This is just SO good! I love being able to make this myself and be free from pre packaged mixes.  We actually made a few variations of this, one with bacon salt, one with jalapeno powder, one with chipotle powder... all delicious.  Thanks, Scottgod, for giving us such a great recipe!

I really liked this recipe - I used it for a dip for Buffalo wings and veggies.  I also thinned some down for a salad dressing, but that didn't seem to have enough flavor.  Maybe I thinned it too much.  As a dip, it was fantastic.  Because I have fresh chives, I used them and they worked great.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Excellent.  I have tried several ranch seasoning mix recipes and I like this one the best.  It has more depth and tastes more like ranch dressing should.  I used this recipe in the Monterey Ranch Chicken Bake recipe and it really added a lot of flavor.  Thanks Scotdog for a great recipe.

I have wanted to try this for sometime now. Finally found buttermilk powder at a Minnenite bulk store. I almost always make ranch using the packets, so I was thrilled to find a homemade version of the mix! I liked the dressing, however, I like robust flavor, so next time I plan to play around with the spices a bit. This is a great start though! Thanks so much for sharing!

I haven't even used this mix yet, but I know it will be great.  I went to my garden to cut chives and parsley.  Chopped, they dry in the microwave on a paper towel in 30 to 40 seconds.  I used freshly ground black pepper (personal choice).  About 2 seconds in the blender, it was ready!  Truly, it smells good enough to eat with the scent of the fresh herbs.  Can't wait to make some tomorrow. Be sure to store in the refrigerator; the can of buttermilk powder says that as well.

Perfect! I love this - I just made a batch to use as a dip and I have some left in the fridge I'll use as a dressing. I love how easy it was to throw together and I can adapt to my preferences or what I have on hand (no dried chives, but I do have some in my herb garden I will chop up!). I've already shared the recipe with my family! Thanks for the recipe!

Ooh I love ranch! This was great. I used dry milk powder, not having buttermilk powder on hand, and used it on pretzels and to make veggie dip (with sour cream, yogurt and mayo). Thanks Scotdog, this is awesome!

I love this recipe.  Was trying to find a store bought packet with no MSG but it's nearly impossible and still doesn't have as good a flavor as this one.  It costs a little bit to buy all of the spices for the first time you use it but the investment is well worth the money.  I use it primarily with the slow cooker buffalo chicken recipe on this site and it makes for a winning combo.

This is fantastic! I used this recipe in order to get away from added sugar, and I am so impressed! The recipe is easily adjustable, if you like more or less of any particular seasoning. I followed a reviewers suggestion to make the dressing with 1/4 c. plain non-fat yogurt (I used Greek), 1/4 c. mayo, and 1/4 c. milk, mixed with 2 T. of the dry mix. I will never buy ranch dressing again!

I made the mix and it is my favorite, I love it, I use 2 spoons of the mix, 2 spoons best food mayonaise, 2 spoons of sour cream and milk until I like the consistance of the sauce.
I love it and I bought everything in the bulk section from Winco so it was so cheap

This worked out pretty well for me - I made it to use for Pull-Apart Bacon Bread (coating the bread balls in oil and dry ranch seasoning). It worked nicely for that purpose, but when I used the rest of it to make dressing (with sour cream, mayo and milk), I have to say I didn't really care for it like that - I'm just used to the bottled stuff, I guess! I'll make again to use as the dry powder in recipes, though I think I would use onion powder rather than the dried minced onion. Thanks for sharing your recipe Scotdog!

This is perfect just as written! I have looked for Ranch Mix without MSG but nobody makes it. I was resigned to a life with no Ranch Salad dressing since I'm allergic to MSG. Everyone loves this and I will never buy bottled dressing or refrigerated dip from the produce section again!

Love this :) Made as directed, but with black pepper instead of white (who has this anyway??).  Made a double batch to have extra on hand since my family goes through a lot of ranch.  I read in other reviews to wait 12hr to 24hrs for the seasonings to meld together but found after refrigerating for 3 hrs it was good to go.  Note: it was a strong enough flavor that next time I make this I will use LESS seasoning.  Could possibly get away with 2/3 seasoning with 1 c mayo & 1 c milk.  Thanks for submitting! This will be my go to recipe from now on.

I add 1/8 o f a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (I use red and it doesn't change the color) to add a tang to each batch. My batch is 1 Tbls of mix to 1/3 C of light mayo and 1/3 cup of 1% milk. I've also done 1/2 fat-free Greek yogurt and half mayo.

I wanted to love this..I really did, but just did not. It just didn't taste like ranch to me. It was bland. I admit, I did not have any chives, so I added just a bit more onion, but other than that followed the recipe to a tee. It just didn't have much flavor. I really think it needs much more salt. I had another recipe for this that uses crushed saltines, and I really liked the idea of using the buttermilk powder instead. The other recipe tastes like Hidden Valley to a tee, so I just made it with substituting the buttermilk powder for the saltines. It has a great flavor, just waiting to see if it will thicken up a bit more.

My kids loved this!  They made this themselves!  We used 32 oz plain yogurt. 1/4 tsp black pepper(no white),  1/4 tsp celery seed and no chives(didn't have any).  They started tasting it after 30 minutes.  I couldn't keep them away from it!

I used this in a recipe calling for the packaged version. I skipped the buttermilk powder because I really couldn't find it. It has a flavour though subtle, but not the ranch-y kind. Needs to be tweaked.

Love, love, love this!  My husband and I sprinkle this on potatoes and burgers, but I'm surprised we haven't tried it with more seeing as we will eat just about anything when it comes with Ranch dressing.  We also use it to make a dip for our veggies (thicker than dressing).

I love having a home made alternative to store bought mixes. This one fills the bill very nicely. I followed the recipe exactly, using 1/2 tsp kosher salt. After running the mix through the grinder, I mixed it up with light sour cream, light mayo, and 1% buttermilk. Even though I did use the buttermilk powder the recipe calls for, I had some buttermilk to use up. There was no need to let it sit for the flavors to meld, and it was thick, creamy and very flavorful with a nice tanginess to it. I'll be interested to see how this one works for other uses besides dip. I'll be trying it in larkspur's 'Hidden Treasures Ranch Pockets' next! Thanks for coming up with this one, Sd.

I have some heart problems so I need to watch my salt intake (among other things). I like this recipe because it is very low in salt. I buy unsalted nuts, put them in a container, add some ranch mix and  shake.

It’s good, but there’s something missing that I can’t pinpoint. It’s an awesome base recipe for a dip or salad dressing, but it doesn’t taste quite like ranch to me - that’s the reason I took off a star. If you’re looking for delicious and herby, it’s worth 5 stars. Definitely let it hang out in the fridge overnight so the flavors can meld.

I would love to whip up a quick delicious ranch dressing for my kids, however, I was disappointed.  The amount of milk is too much, normally I would have added it a little at a time but this time I made it as directed.  I also used light mayo which is another reason that it was runny.  The flavor was ok, but watch the milk.

This is GREAT!  I didn't have the buttermilk powder nor paprika so I left those out.  (I added buttermilk to the mix when I used the spice mix) I did narrow it to 10 servings which equaled a little less than 2 packs of the store bought.  OH!  And I doubled the dill.  Will absolutely be my go to recipe!  THANK YOU so much for sharing!!!

I used a bit more garlic powder and omitted the salt.  Yum!  On a warm and sunny spring day, this recipe really helped the salad in our meal stand out.  I'm looking forward to using this dry mix in hamburgers, on pork chops and even mixed into chicken salad.  This is a keeper!

So Good!!!! Looked high and low for dry buttermilk powder and found it at my local Walmart! Omitted the dried chives and celery flakes since I had none on hand....other than that...this was a great Ranch mix! Used it in Zucchini Ranch Meatloaf from this site....used to rounded tablespoons....may use even more....nice! Thanks Scotdog!!!

I had tried a homemade ranch dressing recipe from here and wasn't too thrilled. So, when I saw this one and the reviews, I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. I did what some reviews advised and made this with 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt, 1/2 cup light sour cream, 1/3 cup fat free milk, and 4 tbsp of the mixture. For some reason it had a little bit of a sweet taste (which I don't like in ranch dressing) so I added more salt and per another reviewer,  added some lemon juice to tang it up a bit. It definitely helped but I'll be researching other ways to make it more tanging. I tasted the dry mix and it seemed to taste way to peppery but when I added the dairy products it was a great blend. Overall, I really enjoy this and will do it again! Plus, even with all the dairy, no points for 2 tbsp is a Weight Watcher's friend!

Like you I have to be very careful about what I eat so I have been making my ranch dressing fresh whenever I needed it.  This recipe is wonderful, it is nice to have it on hand when I run out of fresh buttermilk, or decide on the spur of the moment to have salad for dinner.  Thanks for posting this.

I really hate to not give this a good review but we really didn't like this. I have made it twice the first time it tasted like french onion dip thinking maybe I messed up the measurements I made it again and left out the dried onion but it still had an odd taste. I'm thinking that it may be the celery flakes so I'm planning on making it again and either reducing them or omitting them all together. Keeping my fingers crossed I really want to like this

Excellent! I used for vegetable dip and it was a huge hit, I mixed with FF sour cream. I couldn't find celery flakes so I substituted ground celery seed and omitted the salt. **I added 2 tbsps mix, sour cream and butter to our mashed potatoes, fantastic, even the kids liked it! ** I made ranch chicken, added a heaping tbsp to the marinade, really good.

We were packing a picnic to take out of state and I thought I had a packet of this in the cupboards.  Guess not.  So, I saw this, mixed it up and it was spot on, Scotdog!!! The only thing I noticed is that this makes about 2 packets worth of the store-bought...and to get the same amount of flavor (or seasoning) that you would from 1, you have to use the whole amount of this.  May have just needed more salt, I will play with it next time.  Otherwise, very happy with the finished product!  I will be making a large batch this weekend.

This is a great recipe.  I always need ranch dressing and forget to buy it.  The package dry dressing is a little salty.  This is perfect.  I use it for making a dip for vegetables. Thanks for such a great treat!

Yes! Thank you! This mix is great. My ratio for mixing is 2 tablespoons per cup of base for dressing and 3+/- tablespoons for dip. Dips using Yogurt as a base needs a little more, sour cream needs a little less.
When making a dressing I add a splash of Worcestershire Sauce.

My question to anyone is this, if the carton of buttermilk powder states to refrigerate after opening, does the ranch seasoning mix needs to be refrigerated?

I liked it.  I needed it as an ingredient for a slow cooked chicken breast recipe that is topped with cream cheese and ranch mix and then slow cooked for 4 hrs.  Great flavor.
The boxed mix has msg in it  which some of the family can't tolerate.

I admit we modify the recipe pretty significantly, but we are so thankful we found this recipe! My husband is a huge fan of Ranch dip but needed something much lower in sodium than our name-brand mix.  We make this mix without  the dry Buttermilk and without the salt.  Both of those add too much sodium for his diet.  With that change, we multiple everything in the recipe (except the onion!) by 4 and use 3 tbs at a time to mix with sour cream to make Ranch dip. With those changes, it is definitely different than the name-brand mix, but it satisfies his Ranch NEED! Thanks so much for the recipe.

Good, but thin, but I have to clarify:  I didn't see Scotdog's review  mentioning only 3/4c added ingredients.  I read the editor's that said 2c each of milk & mayo.  I halved the recipe & added only 1 3/4c.  Thin.  This morning, I just added 2T buttermilk mix (the other "half") & the other half spices to the prepared dressing.  What that means is I made the recipe as written, but 1 3/4c mayo/milk.   Letting it settle.  :D

First time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  But I felt like the celery flakes or dill was too overpowering.  Next time I made it, I omitted both of those ingredients, and I added black pepper because I love black pepper.  It came out perfect.

perfect! just what I was looking for, I suggest adding the mayo and milk slowly alternating until you get the consistancy you like best. The addition of papkrika is great. You can mix up the ingrediants as you see fit, but keeping the garlic, and dill at a minimum is key to not overwhelming the other flavours. I have tried a lot of ranch recipes using buttermilk powder and this hands down is the best I have found yet! Thank you!

I like the idea of controlling the ingredients of what I eat and this recipe liberates me from the "what's that ingredient" surprise on commercially-made foods.  
When I made my first batch, I had to sub out the celery flakes with 1/2 tsp of celery seed and used fresh chives, but otherwise stuck to Scotdog's recipe.  I used 1/2 cup each of 2% milk, nonfat Greek yogurt, and light mayo to 2 Tbsp of dry mix which turned out too thick.  For the second batch, I upped the milk by 1/4 cup or so (eyeballed) and it turned out creamy with just the right mix of herbs and spices.

Pretty close to store bought.  I used all the seasonings except for celery flakes, which I didn't have.  For a dip, I used 16 oz cream cheese, 1/3 to 1/2 c. light mayo, 1 tsp. vinegar, 1 tbsp. milk, dash of worcestershire, and 1/4 c. of the dip mix.  It is best if you let it set for a day or so.  WE will see how the family likes it at our Tgiving dinner today!

The dry mix doesn't smell like much, but when mixed up as a dip or dressing, it tastes even better than the packaged mix.  I did mix my dry ingredients in the food processor to make it less chunky.  Wait a few hours before eating it in whatever you're making, so the dry spices have a chance to rehydrate.  More economical than the packaged mix, too!

Thank you so much for this recipe. I just joined Weight Watchers and have not wanted to buy the packages of ranch dry mix or dressing. This will come in handy.
