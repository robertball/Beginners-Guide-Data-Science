I submitted this recipe and want to add that I sometimes use pizza dough from the refrigerated section in the store to cut down on time. Then it's a breeze! Add or omit any "pizza toppings" you want to suit your taste. It's great for guests - just omit the colors and shape in a U.

My family loved this from the presentation to the taste.  I used canadian bacon instead of pepperoni but it still tasted fantastic.

I used pre-made pizza dough from Pilsbury. This is a great way to serve food to the kids any time. I made cheesburger calzones. The picky kids ate them right up. The egg was key in keeping it together. Next time I think I'll add bacon!

I absolutely love this recipe! my family scarfed this down and wanted more. My family loves sausage so i added some into the filling. I love this recipe partially for the fact that it is so adaptable. I will definiely make this again.

Awesome idea for Halloween dinner!  I omitted the ricotta cheese, since my crazy family won't eat it.  Instead I added extra mozzarella and about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was great!

I love this recipe! We don't shape it like a snake though. I did make a few changes though. I always double the recipe. When i proof my yeast i use 1/2 cup of water and when it is time to add it to the flour and other ingredients i use 1  1/2 cups of warm milk (to replace the left out water) In the dough I add 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1-2 tbsp of parsley and 1-2 tbsp Italian seasoning. In the cheese filling I add 2-3 more minced garlic cloves! (we like a lot of garlic) and about 1/2 cup of parm cheese. I like to keep the pepperoni separate from the cheese mixture. I put a thick layer of it on one side of the rolled out dough, then add the cheese mixture and close her up. They are delicious! And if there are any left overs, they taste really good cold the next day too!!!!

I did not get this to work.  I used refrigerated pizza crust dough from the store.  I was lucky to roll it out to 12 inches and if fell apart as soon as I tried to pull the ends together.  What a mess and such a disappointment.....

5 stars for such a FUN creative idea! 5 stars for a good base recipe to customize! This served everyone at our Halloween party, with enough for seconds, and it was just plain fun to cut into and eat. The kids really enjoyed helping to make it - I made & rolled out the dough and they layered on cheese, pepperoni, spices and olives before we sealed it and "painted" it with egg-yolk-food-coloring paint. We even put the fillings into "zones" and tried to make a gross Halloween anatomy lesson out of it with the pepperoni zone being the intestines, the black olives being the "spleens" etc. Then it was extra giggle-y and gross when I could ask them which PART of the snake they wanted to eat! Sauce for dipping makes it extra delicious.

Tremendous fun to make & eat.  I cheated & used a can of crescent roll for the dough (pinched together seams), then simply put a light layer of spaghetti sauce, followed by a single layer of turkey pepperoni & a generous sprinkling of shredded mozzarella.  Used pastry brush to add diluted yellow food coloring to dough, then used diluted green food coloring to add spots & lines, dabbing gently with a paper towel to ensure green did not run.  Even my incredibly picky daughter (who never eats) finished all her "Snake" AND salad (that is a huge compliment for me!).  Great concept that can be made more easily using pre-made ingredients...great time-saver & inexpensive meal for a busy weeknight...have fun with this one!

Good foundation recipe, but needed more seasoning.  My calzone split open because I didn't have a good seal, so it ended up looking like a calzone boat :)

This is a great one to make with kids.  My 5 year old loved it!  Does take a long time to make so we did a little activity while it was rising.  Used the bread machine to mix and rise the dough.  Next time I will cut the ricotta cheese in half and use sausage with the pepperoni.  Served it with pizza sauce for dipping.  Will definitely make the dough again for other recipes.

Made this for our family's annual Spooky Halloween feast...looked great!  And we all enjoyed it.  We changed the filling to fit our taste,including some olives and fresh red pepper, and omitting the ricotta cheese. We will make it again.  Thanks!

This was so cute! I baked this with my sister on Halloween for something to eat before taking our kids trick-or-treating. We used refrigerated biscuit dough to make it quicker. It was fun! Next time I am going to try putting the pizza sauce inside and baking it with the rest. We all had fun eating this - even our husbands!

I used refrigerated dough, and it turned out horrible. It stayed together for the most part, but it was too bready and bland. With a little adjusting I got it to look like a slug. Anyway, it was fun for a party!

This was just okay.  If I were to make this again, I would add tomato sauce and make individual snakes.  I did like the idea, it was very cute.

I made this for my intended halloween dinner but towards the end, I decided to shape just like a normal calzone.  I omitted egg mixture for the dough and the crust came out perfect.  I also added cooked sausage into the mixture.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper. :)

My family has been making "the snake" for our Halloween dinner for years.  In fact, one year I figured my kids had gotten too old for it and served something else...my family STRONGLY protested!  I try to change the filling up every year.  This recipe and the ham/cheese combo are our favorites.  It seems like it takes awhile to make but that is just because you have to wait for the rise.  Plan ahead and you wont have a problem.

I loved this idea! I didn't remember to come back on here and get the actual recipe you used though. I happened to have another All Recipes one on a cue card: Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, so used that as my crust and filled it with mozzarella, pepperoni and pizza sauce. I decorated my snake with watered down food colouring. While cooking, it exploded in a couple part, but we just it guts, and enjoyed it! Tasty, and a great addition to my Halloween party!

Came out really cute! I cheated and used Pilsbury pizza dough, and it was so easy! It comes out in a long layer, so you just stretch it and then stretch it width-wise a little, put the filling in the middle, and seal it up. I used egg whites with green food coloring to make a green snake.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it was just a tad dry. It was probably me. I may have cooked it a little too long.

This calzone snake was alot of fun to make and taste great too! If my son had his way he would have me make "snake for dinner" every night.  All in all this was alot of fun, taste great, and I definately will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

I too used the refrigerated pizza dough, I bought two of them to ensure I had enough and it was a hit! Disappeard at a Halloween party, so definitely will make again-  I added a bit of pizza sauce to it, and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta- worked well and people seemed to enjoy it!

I made this last year for my two young grandsons I was babysitting. They looked doubtful when I told them I was making snake pizza for supper, but when they saw it they loved it! I used refrigerated pizza dough , not the kind in the tubes, and pepperoni, sauce and cheese, since they're kinda picky.  the only problem: they both wanted the "head" :-)

It got eatten so fast that I forgot to take a photo. Will need to make again. I was debating, why bother since it's like a pizza, but not really with the ricotta cheese instead of tomato sauce. I made it with chopped anchovies near the head for people who prefer them to salami and with salami instead of pepperoni the rest of the way. It was a great hit with the kids and adults. I baked it at 450 for 20 minutes and it was nice and crisp on the outside and chewy and soft inside with the cheese well melted. I also added an egg to the cheese mixture. Will definitely make again.

I made this for my 5-year-old daughter's Halloween party. It was a big hit! Not only was it "creepy," but it was yummy. There was none left at the end of the night.

Overall, these calzones were good. I left out the mushrooms and olives, though. The dough for this recipe is quite good. It would be good for pizza crust or breadsticks. I kneaded with my hands, let rise for an hour, kneaded a second  time and let rise for 2 more hours. Also, I didn't attempt the snake shape. I rolled out my dough and cut it in half to make 2 triangle calzones. They were huge, so make 4 at the least.

This was a HIT! The dough was super easy to make and it tasted great! We used sliced pepperoni, sliced Canadian bacon and Italian sausage with the ricotta and spices listed above.  We didn't waste time with veggies before trick or treating! It was so so good! Also if you buy store bought dough and your dough is garbage how could you rate this RECIPE correctly??? come on people!

My 4 y.o. grandson wasn't impressed. I found the taste rather bland. I'll try making it again but adding more toppings to cheese mixture to kick up the flavors.

I added mushrooms and other veggies, which ultimately made the interior toppings too big,  so my scary snake turned out to be an ugly eel, but everyone loved the taste!

I made it for a kids party and will make it again for our grown up party it was really good! It took about 2 hours total. I added a little italian dressing inside, and ham and some cheddar cheese.  Dyed it blue with food coloring egg wash and the boys were stuffed they ate so much!

Great idea! I used store bought frozen pizza dough, thawed overnight. Also I added a layer of pizza sauce before adding the filling, which ended up making the marinara dipping sauce redundant. It was beautiful and the kids loved it, though there was some fighting over the snake’s head!

Love this recipe. So fun and easy to make. I made two of these for a church game night and they were a huge hit. I did not try the colored stripes but I definitely will next time. I sprinkled garlic salt all of the top. the dough is dense and Crunchy. love it.

I made this for Halloween, I cut pepperoni into diamonds to decorate the back, used a sliver piece for the tongue, and green pimento olives sliced in half for the eyes. I also pulled the face end upward and curled it over to make room for olives to set
in and to make nostrils. It came out scary good. I'll try to post a picture later.

I made this lovely  snake for a surprise Halloween supper for my husband.   It was a "Graveyard Smash,"  as the song says.  Using two Pillsbury canned pizza crusts lessened a lot of time and work, but still kept it very tastey!   I used an egg yolk wash with green food coloring, practically smothering the outside.  As it baked, it turned a slimily green/gray/brown  color.  Perfect for grossing out husbands, but probably not so much for kids!  We couldn't believe how wonderful this recipe was.  Will make often using different shapes and colors for other occasions!

This was a good recipe that could become a great one with a few tweaks. I used Pillsbury's refrigerated pizza dough, added a layer of sauce inside before adding the toppings and used chorizo instead of pepperoni. It was good but the parmesan was overwhelming and made it too salty - next time I'd use 1/3 of what the recipe calls for.

My husband loves this recipe. Sometimes I make the dough from scratch, but usually I use pillsbury pizza dough. I substitute the olives for spinach and sprinkle garlic salt all over the outside. Delicious!

It looked good (before baking) and tasted great even though it looked extra weird coming out of the oven! We divided it into three sections so daddy and daughter could have their favorite ingredients and I could have mine. I used refrigerated dough and we had a wonderful Halloween dinner.
