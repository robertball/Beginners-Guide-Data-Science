This is delicious, I had to reduce the red curry paste to 1-2 tablespoons , 1/2  cup would be inedible ! Reduced the sugar to a teaspoon and I used 1 can of coconut milk , omitted the beans as I didn't have any , used 1 large red pepper and 6 shallots for the onions , 1 can of  bamboo shoots and fresh pineapple . Reduced cooking time as well  to maybe 10 minutes total as I used cooked large shrimp. We  love Thai food I cook it often.

Will make again but with a few changes: do not saute the shrimp in chili paste. Saute the onions and peppers in this mixture. Only use one can of coconut milk. I did not use leeks. Maybe cut back slightly on the fish sauce and definitely do not need 5 tbsp sugar. I used about 1 1/2 tbsp.

Mostly followed the recipe but added snap pees, the entire can of pineapple 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice 1/4 cup of palm sugar rather than the white.  Served toped with crushed cashews, cilantro and scallions.  DELISH!!!

Delicious flexible recipe. Use any vegetables you like and substitute tofu triangles for the shrimp.

This was excellent.  I would reduce sugar in future.  I don't know that I would completely remove it but with the sweetness of the pineapple, it doesn't need 5 tbsp's of sugar.  Had one guest comment that it was a bit sweet.

An easy, tasty recipe! Fish sauce might be difficult to find if you don't have an international food store nearby, but it really makes a difference in the sauce. Be sure to buy a good red curry paste, too!

I substituted coconut oil for the olive oil, omitted the jalape√±o and added some red pepper flake instead. It was delicious! My husband loved it, I will be making this again.

Cooked as written minus the sugar with added water chestnuts.  Filled up an entire 3qt pan while cooking so I'd try something larger next time. 

I think the extra 14 oz of coconut milk makes the recipe bland. It doesn't have a signature flavor, but is serviceable. After this is consumed, I will not be making this again.

Turned out really yummy :) next time I will use maybe 2 tbsp sugar but use all the pineapple juice, and probably only 1 tbsp red curry paste - so the rest of the family eats it too :) thank you so much for the recipe! :)

My husband loved it!!  We are both big Thai foodies.  I couldn‚Äôt find a Spanish onion so I used a yellow onion.  The grocery store didn‚Äôt have shallots so I replaced them with more green onions.  I would like to turn up the heat a little.  Next time won‚Äôt rely simply on the jalape√±o.  Maybe throw in a few of its seeds

Made this last night for dinner guests and it was well received by all! I did add thinly sliced carrots and fresh grated garlic, ginger, and lime zest and only used 1 can of coconut milk, but used an entire 15oz can of pineapple tidbits with the juice. I stirred in 1 heaping cup of instant rice when I added the shrimp - why dirty another pan? - and after simmering to absorb the liquid, had a great 1-pan dinner. Thanks!

This  recipe is a must you will receive many compliments. If I had to change anything it would be to chop the pineapple into smaller pieces and to use heavy coconut milk throughout.  Great recipe !

I used one less tablespoon of sugar...could prob go with just three. The pineapple ads a lot of sweetness. We also used slightly less jalape√±o and it was the perfect spice amount for us. Loved it though! Would definitely make it again.

This is a very good curry. I recommend stir-frying the green beans for a full 5-10 mins before adding other veggies. Otherwise they come out a bit tougher then everything else.

First time using red curry paste.  I didn't know that this is already so spicy!!!  No need for chilli peppers.  So be aware of the curry paste you buy.  Also I agree with the no extra sugar necessary folks.  The pineapple should provide all the sweetness you need.

This was excellent. Taste like eating out in a Thai restaurant.
