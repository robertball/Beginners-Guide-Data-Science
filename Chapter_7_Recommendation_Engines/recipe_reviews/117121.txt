This is a new family favorite.  The first time I made it exactly as it is written and it turned out fabulous.  My daughter, however, isn't fond of stir-fry sauce, so we did it the next time with Asian Sesame dressing and added those Asian Salad toppings. YUM!  Next time we're adding water chestnuts and some baby corn for extra veggies.

This was really, really good and it was easy to make, but I also added my two cents to it.  To start, I used some of the stir-fry sauce, about two-three teaspoons and not quite an 1/8 teaspoon of minced ginger to marinate some chicken tenders for about 20 minutes.  I also added about 1/8 teaspoon to the 1/2 cup of stir-fry sauce to give it an extra punch of flavor.  Next time I might try using marinated tofu and different veggies.

I love this recipe! It's such a good idea and it's also pretty basic so it's easy to get creative and expand on the ingredients.  I use a mix of soy sauce, asian dressing and also a lil bit of stir fry sauce. I do not use mandarin oranges. I use whatever veggies I have as well; though the best I have found are celery, carrots, onions, red peppers and green peppers. However, the one ingredient that makes this dish so good is cilantro.

i forgot to take meat out of the freezer tonight so i was scrambling for something tonight and happened upon this recipe.  i ended up using canned chicken which was alright in this recipe. i used green beans, peas, carrots, and broccoli for the veggies instead of the combo recommended, based on both what i had and what we prefer.  i used chinese noodles instead of spaghetti, too.  i found the mandarin oranges to be an odd taste - my kids seemed to like them, but ifi made this agian i think i'd leave them out.  one addition that i might use next time is to add sliced almonds - yum!  thanks!

I really liked this recipe!  I am always looking for ways to use sugar snap peas because I love them.  For the sauce, I used an asian sesame salad dressing mixed with soy sauce, since I didn't have prepared stir-fry sauce.  I sauteed my chicken in olive with garlic and ginger for extra flavor.  Delicious!  My only complaint was the carrots, since I don't really like cooked carrots.  I think I would just leave them out next time and substitute julienned zucchini or mushrooms instead.  Very versatile recipe!

This was great!  I didn't have any leftover chicken and I found that sugar snap peas weren't in my budget.  I sauteed cubed chicken and minced garlic together and substituted green beans for the sugar snap peas.  Gourmet-cooking MIL said it was very good! :D

I made this cause I was looking for a way to use up a bag of sugar snap peas I had forgotten about.  It was delicious!  Definitely will be making it again!
