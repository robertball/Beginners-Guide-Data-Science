Quite delicious. The amount of paste is significant. Thankfully, it can be used in so much more than drinks. Add it to soups, curries, and stews. Thank you for the recipe.

I added the cinnamon and ginger  to the paste. I add my soy or other milk, a teaspoon of honey, heat it up and this becomes what dreams are made of.

Delicious and comes with an impressive list of health benefits. Not hard to make, and now I have enough paste for several more batches. Looking forward to them!

I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred it half way and done. I used the same small glass dish to stored it.

I often add 1/2 a banana to the drink.  Yummy
