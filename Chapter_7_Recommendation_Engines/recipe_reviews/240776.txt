Spinach/mushroom is my favorite quiche . I like this recipe but I oten make changes to it. One, I use only nutmeg , salt and pepper for my spices. Two, I often change up the cheese I use. Feta is my favorite for this but swiss is a close second. Three, I use frozen thawed spinach instead of fresh. Sometimes I do all three.
 I usually mix the spinach into the onion/garlic mixture on the stove, add the cheese, eggs and milk, stir and then pour into my 9" pie crust. I like the frozen pie crust that comes in a roll. The one in a tin plate is not deep enough.

Sauteed onion and spinach using bacon and fat.  I also split the milk with half and half.  I used garlic and herb goat cheese instead of feta.   It turned out awesome!

I substituted Swiss chard, about 3 big leaves, for the spinach. Very tasty. Watch out for Cajun seasoning in which the first ingredient is salt- turned out too salty- my bad.

Made it for a few friends, and all of us loved it.  It's just right for a light lunch; served it with corn/tomatoes salad.  A big hit!

Way too much onion, overpowered the quiche.
