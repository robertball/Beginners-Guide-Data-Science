Quick & Easy Jambalaya Haiku: "Four and a half stars! Really, this was outstanding. Just way too much rice!" Funny that other review says not enough rice, whereas I read 2 cups as insanely too much. Ended up making the rice (1/2 c. brown basmati, non-instant) separately to avoid it being smooshy or crunchy, and just stirring it in when we served the jambalaya. Really delicious, and very, very easy to make!

Everybody loved it.Great flavor with minimal prep work.I didn't have instant brown rice but did have already cooked white rice.I knew it would be a bit soupy this way which was fine since I served the rice separately,and those who liked it soupier could scoop up more juice,those that like it thicker could skim off the top. Thanks for sharing.

I made this tonight and all of my people really liked it!  Of course, I had some modifications as I didn't have bell pepper or fresh celery--I used dried celery seasoning.  And we didn't want the chicken in it either, so just used the turkey keilbasa.  I used white rice and a can of roasted diced tomatoes mixed with a little salsa.  I had Webers N'Orleans Cajun seasoning and that worked like a dream!  Great flavor! We served it with shredded colby jack cheese, sour cream and corn bread muffins!  It was so good and so quick and easy! Highly recommend!

Needed something with instant rice and gave this recipe a try. This was super quick to make. A few modifications happened out of necessity: I grilled the sausages first on my indoor grill as it was faster than boiling. I did not have fresh onion so used dehydrated onion flakes.  I did not have a can of tomatoes so used  5 fresh tomatoes instead. I also used a package of pre-cooked grilled chicken pieces. Super fast recipe. I thought the rice ratio was great. This recipe is delicious and I will make it again!

This is a great recipe! If you use regular rice like I did that's not instant you may need to add some more liquid. It was easy to make my own seasoning by doing an internet search for Cajun seasoning. I happened to have "file" or "file gumbo" from the spice shop, which will give it a nice touch and thicken any remaining liquid. I didn't have smoked sausage so I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika - I used Italian sausage.

Be sure to drain the water.  The recipe does not really say how much water to use.  The taste was fairly good.  I cooked some chicken breast instead of using can.

Great recipe. I added garlic and shrimp. I think the rice measurement may e referring to the cooked rice, I halfed it (to better match the amount of liquid) when measuring the uncooked rice and it was just right. If I had measured the uncooked rice according to the recipe it would've been too much and there would not have been enough liquid to cook it. I easily tripled the recipe for our large family.

Will make it again since I didn't have brown rice and used white and  had to mix up my own cajun spices and put double amount in by mistake. Also used dried celery since I was out of fresh. It was still very quick and easy and I loved it.

I was skeptical, but I needed to throw something together quickly. This was absolutely devoured by my family of 4. (Everyone had seconds.) Is it "authentic"? Not exactly, but one pot in ~30 minutes = perfect weeknight meal.

Awesome awesome awesome ! Easy recipe and so delicious. I accidentally cooked the rice before mixing together but it worked out just fine. I used green peppers instead and added shrimp. Scrumptious !

Not nearly enough rice.  Probably won't make again, but if I did, then I would double the rice and chicken broth.
