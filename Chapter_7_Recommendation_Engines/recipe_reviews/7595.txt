This wasn't at all what I expected.  It was rather bland and odd tasting.  I thought it would be somewhat like a cheesecake, but it's not.  I would not make it again.

This was the worst cake I have ever baked!!!! I had it for New Years day.  I followed the directions fully but the cake had no flavor and the cheese mixture settled to the bottom and tasted terrible!!  Needless to say no one at the dinner liked it. I have usually had good luck with other recipes but this one takes the cake, literately!

I've made this several times in the past few years and people always love it. Because it is not as sweet as other cakes, we pour strawberry topping (frozen or canned types) on top of ours and it tastes yummy!

I have made this cake several times and loved it everytime.  I have changed it around a bit and put differnt fruits on it but everyone I served it too also loved it and asked for the recipe.

This is not  a "Scratch" cake.   If you want a ricotta cake made from "scratch" try Louisa's Ricotta Cake!  You will be very pleased.  YUM!!!  Had to make it twice in 2 days for a family of 3 who devoured it!!
