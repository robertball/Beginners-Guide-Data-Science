Absolutely delicious tasting! This CAULIPOWER pizza crust is amazing. I would have never known it wasn't a regular pizza crust. This is something I would make again and again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

What's gluten-free, delicious-tasting, and better-for-you? Pizza made with CAULIPOWER pizza crust is the answer!! It was so crispy and the crust was made from cauliflower, but it seriously tasted like regular pizza crust. My family's only complaint was they wanted more! LOL That's a good thing! Not a bite was left. We love cheese and we didn't even miss it in this recipe. I highly recommend it...

Who would have thought that pizza without cheese could be this delicious!? This was gourmet all the way, and easy to throw together using the pre-made CAULIPOWERÂ® pizza crust. I was surprised at how crispy the crust was (being that it's made out of cauliflower). I wouldn't have known it was gluten-free either.  I threw the bacon on a sheet pan and cooked it in the oven while the oven was pre-heating. I also quartered the tomatoes to distribute them more evenly over the crust. I did top the pizza with the optional avocado, which I just diced. It was so good! I can't wait to make it again!

I really enjoyed this! Loved the basil mayo. This was my first time using the CAULIPOWER crust and I am impressed. No one would know it was made with cauliflower. The crispy crust gave it the crunch like the toasted bread on a BLT sandwich.

Delicious!  I used all spinach as my husband and kids don't like arugula.  I halved all of toppings- I think as written there would have been the perfect amount for 2 crusts (two come in a package) but I suppose that's simply a matter of preference.  The flavors are fabulous and CAULIPOWER crusts are simply amazing- I've never had a cauliflower-based crust that turned out so crispy and delicious-tasting.  I'm SO impressed by how delicious they are and how they have held up to all of the pizza toppings I've tried on them so far!

This CAULIPOWER pizza was great!  I had been craving pizza and wanted to do a better-for-you option that was different than they typical pizzas.  This did not disappoint at all.  Great flavor and my daughter even liked it and asked for me to make it again sometime!

I made this for my husband and me to share but he ate it all! He loved it! He also had no clue the crust was a delicious tasting, gluten-free CAULIPOWER crust, made from cauliflower. I will be making it again!

Delicious, better-for-you, crispy pizza made with CAULIPOWER crust! I wish I had made two, it was so good. So quick to make as well, great for a quick lunch on a busy day.

This wa absolutely delicious! My family had no idea they were eating a CAULIPOWER Pizza crust. If I did not know I never would have guess that the crust was gluten free, it was so tasty, crispy and delicious. I used regular bacon for this recipe. I also used fresh basil and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the basil aioli. The fresh basil made the sauce. Definitely going to make this again!
