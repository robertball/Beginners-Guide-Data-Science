I am really picky about scones; they have to have the right texture, too moist and they are muffins, too dry and they are bisquits. These are great and I have been looking for a good pumpkin scone recipe for awhile! I did add 1/4 cup brown sugar because I prefer sweet scones, and I added up the spice quantities (makes 1 T) and used pumpkin pie spice (also used pumpkin pie spice in the glaze). Baked at 425 as instructed and they were perfect at 16 minutes of baking. I only made one round that I cut into 8 pieces and I put them on parchment paper for baking. Absolutely delicious!

Hi!  I'm the original poster.  I live at sea level, so I don't know if that affects baking time/temperatures differently.  While I've never checked if my oven is calibrated, most other recipes work fine at posted temps and times.  My husband and I prefer less-sweet scones, but if you want them sweeter, add 1/4 c sugar (I think brown would be better with the pumpkin, personally).  It is a healthier scone, so if you want something that tastes more like a junky pastry, this is probably not it!

I can't figure out how to edit reviews, so sorry for a duplicate.

For all those that say it is bland, make sure your spices are fresh.  The spices used here start losing their potency as soon as they are opened and need to be restocked every 3-6 months if you buy the pre ground stuff.  I didn't think they were bland at all, but I always bake with fresh spices.

I also agree with the reviewers who say this is more of a healthy recipe, and if you're looking for a junky sweet treat, this is not for you!  People who are health conscious will be more likely to like this recipe.

Loved this recipe!  For those of you who are expecting sweetness in the scone... scones are typically NOT sweet.  The icing on top will give some sweetness.  These came out perfect and just as I remembered eating in Scotland.  If I could... I'd give it more than 5 stars!!

1 star  Only after taking out of the oven, realized these are not sweet.  There is no sugar in recipe.  They must be frosted.   425 degree oven is too high.  My oven is correctly calibrated, but after 15 minutes the top was getting too dark and the insides were still too moist.  Drop the temperature and cook for a longer period of time.    The baking sheet should be lightly greased.  Not mentioned in recipe but they stuck and broke apart as i removed them.    Frosting needs more than 1 TBL of milk, more like 2 TBL. These are definately not like the famous coffehouse scones I had hoped for.

This recipe was very good.  I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and added 1/4 cup of sugar to the recipe after reading reviews that it wasn't sweet enough.  Tasted great!

These are delicious!  Better than any coffee shop scone, these are moist and have just enough flavor, not too pumpkin-y.

Made these this morning. They were very good. They were dense and not muffin like. I gave 4 stars because I added 1/4 c. brown sugar after reading all the reviews about how they weren't sweet enough. I used 1 t. cinnamon and 1 t. pumpkin pie spice. Instead of milk, I used Caramel coffee creamer. My dough was a little dry so I added 2 extra Tbs of creamer.  I also added a small handful of mini chocolate chips. I used a cheese shredder  and shredded my cold butter into the flour mixture. It was easier thank using a pastry blender. I would like to try subbing some applesauce for the butter next time to see how they turn out to cut down on the fat. I just used a pastry brush and brushed a light  layer of glaze on top.  I would make these again.

When I tasted a bit of the dough, it tasted awfully bland! But with the sweet icing, I think it's perfect! Instead of zigzag drizzling the icing over each scone, I just dunked each one upside-down into the bowl of runny icing and let it drip down the sides. The spiciness is really great, and I love that this contains oats... so it's healthy, right? :)

I have been looking for a 'healthy' scone recipe for a while. This is it!! Super yummy. I used all whole wheat flour (sifted to keep it from getting too dense) and it was perfection.

Good flavor!  I like the fact that some could eat the scone with no sweetener, and others could have sweetener in the form of frosting.

Delicious! Made half the recipe this morning for breakfast for my teen son and I.  Easy, quick, healthy.  I will certainly make these again. We live at high altitude so I use double acting baking powder. Thank you MattsWife.

I was very happy with these. I tend to prefer my scones a little more flavorful so each time I've made these I've at least double all of the spices, along with adding a pumpkin pie spice that I found. 
The glaze gets a little sticky, but it brings a nice sweetness to the few bites that it touches.

I do like these because they are not sweet however I may add a little sugar next time. I added raisins and maybe if I added more raisins it may have been sweet enough without adding sugar. I made this a couple times and if you put the topping on they don't need sugar ether. They are good with tea, love the  texture. The temperature and time is perfect. Theses are more of a healthy food. Healthfood addicts would love them. Junk food lovers would hate them. I love them and will continue making them.

This recipe baked up nicely, however, next time I will try using less oatmeal, add a bit of brown sugar and use buttermilk in both the scone and icing (buttermilk is made from skim milk, so just as heath conscious), this recipe was extremely bland and not even slightly similar to those from that 'famous coffee store' other than the fact that they have pumpkin in them and icing on top.

I was so disappointed that when mine came out of the oven after baking as recommended, they were chewy and too moist.  The glaze wasn't that good, but I added 2 TBS of pumpkin puree and it tasted much better.  The scones taste like pumpkin flavored oatmeal cookies without the raisins.  I am still on the quest to find a recipe more similar to Starbucks.

As written this recipe is a little bland, but only because of the lack of sugar; if you were looking for a sugar free recipe this would be great.  I added a couple tablespoons of sugar & made them for a preschool tea party, adding the glaze for the grownups and that worked pretty well.  You can also substitute part of the all purpose flour with white whole wheat flour to increase the fiber without negatively affecting the results.

We liked these. I am fan of baked goods with oatmeal and pumpkin anything though. I also don't like really sweet baked goods, so these worked good for me. With that being said, I had leftover pumpkin pie filling and this recipe was recommended. I really think, this recipe benefits from pumpkin pie filling over pumpkin puree due to having absolutely no sugar. It is a scone and not a biscuit. It should have even a little. So my rating is on making that necessary change. I don't care much for frosting or icings and opted to make just a half a recipe of it. I actually thought they were fine just as is. The icing makes them look more decorative though. After I measured out half the powdered sugar I realized it still needed the same amount of milk and spices as using the full amount. It tasted a little flat, so I also ended up adding an equal amount of pumpkin spice. That seemed to do the trick. I followed the recipe, as is, and had no troubles. I did knead on parchment and bake on it also. The suggested bake time is also way off. They took 30 minutes. During the last 5 minutes I used a sharp knife to separate the scones to ensure the centers were properly baked. ty

Liked these scones.  I did add a Tbsp of coconut sugar and used coconut oil instead of butter. I found I needed to cook them longer and separate them to cook them through but they are very tasty and I love the savoury scone as opposed to a sweet one.  Because of that I did not frost them at all. Another time I will brush them with milk and a sprinkle of sugar instead so they look nicer.

I made the scones but used pumpkin pie spice. These scones are pretty darn good.  They will be delicious with a cup of coffee in the morning.  They are not sweet but I really liked them.  I noticed people added sugar or swapped out wheat flour for part of the white flour.  I'm sure those variations are yummy, too!

Wow, it didn't even dawn on me that this recipe had no sugar!  It DEFINITELY needs sugar.  Throw a quarter cup of brown sugar in there or something.  They're good but just... not right without a touch of sweetness.  I hate that drizzle powdered sugar icing so I left that off.

These were perhaps more cake-y than what is technically considered a scone, but I prefer it that way  :)  These were great.  I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the recipe.  After the frosting, these were just the perfect amount of sweetness.  My 9 year old son says they taste just like the ones at The Coffee Shop That Shall Not Be Named.  I loved the texture the oats gave them.  We will be making these again.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the additional texture the rolled oats provided the scones.  Wonderful recipe; thank you so much for sharing.  I thought the addition of 3/4 cup of jaggery (unrefined cane sugar) would allow me to get away with less icing, and it did.

Delicious! All I had were quick oats and it still came out well just had to bake it a minute or two longer. The spices gave it a nice kick too.  Not really a fan of the frosting but I have never really liked the powdered sugar frostings. This will definitely be a keeper.

I did not like this recipe. I followed it verbatim, and I found it far too dry. The oats made it feel even more dry and starchy. I also like my scones to be somewhat sweet. These had no sweetness to them, save for the icing. They tasted nothing like the scones from "a well-known coffee shop."

Very bland and didn't taste like a scone to me. I was very disappointed. I was looking for a scone recipe so I don't have to buy them individually. My scone recipe hunt continues.

I totally butchered this recipe...and it still came out great!!  
It was 5:00 in the morning, I was feeding a baby and trying to make coffee, and I unthinkingly just dumped all the ingredients together into a bowl and forgot the butter; so, I used oil instead and added chopped pecans. On the top, I sprinkled sanding sugar instead of using a glaze after it baked.
Delicious!!

My name is Connor H Dogan. I am a Sophomore from Noxon High School, and I LOVED this recipe. I made it as a culinary arts class test and gave it to teachers and they loved it too. I would definitely do this again for the future. I really do appreciate you sharing this recipe with me.
 Sincerely Connor

These turned out so well that I made them again about a week later.  The flavor and texture were awesome even with oats in the recipe which I've never used in scones.  A really pleasant surprise.

These are great! Not too sweet and my kids loved them. I've made these twice now, once as written and once slightly modified. The second time around I added 1/4c sugar, subbed half the flour for spelt flour, and added dried cranberries. They've just come out of the oven and my plan is to split them and serve with butter. Thanks for a good recipe.

The use of oats attracted me to this recipe which was easy to make and with the addition of 1/4 cup brown sugar had the right amount of sweetness. I baked half the dough in a ceramic pie plate in our toaster oven and froze the other half. We did not put icing on. Leftovers were kept in a metal tin and were just as tasty again after reheating in the toaster oven.  I’ll be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe.

We enjoyed these - I did add ¼ cup brown sugar as the original poster recommended for sweetness.  I was not as fond of having the oats in the scone, although they probably added some fluffiness to the overall scone, but my kids ate them up!

I didn't like that the dough wasn't sweetened. In my mind, that's fine for a savoury scone, but I wanted sweet for a sweet scone. So I added 1 cup of white sugar. It tastes great but a little sweet. Next time will try 3/4 cup of brown sugar. The other reason I sweeten the dough is that the icing does not travel well and didn't work for mass quantity charity baking. So I just top off the pieces with an egg wash (thank you Chef Jon) and a sprinkle of coarse sugar for effect. I've gotten rave reviews for this "modified" recipe so this will become my staple. Thank you so much! The spice mixture along with the oat blend is divine!

This recipe turned out pretty great! I added brown sugar as many of the suggestions said and added extra cinnamon. These have still tasted great a few days later toasted with butter. Satisfied my fall pumpkin craving wonderfully.

This is a great versatile recipe.  I've made this with coconut oil instead of butter as well as a combo of whole wheat and brown rice flour and sorghum flour.  I like to make the frosting with maple syrup.  Such a good flavour with the pumpkin.  Just keep adding a few drops of it into icing sugar until it reaches the consistency you want.

Delicious.  I did add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the scone itself, and I also did not use a full teaspoon of nutmeg.  I used freshly grated, so I just grated the nutmeg right into the bowl and couldn't really guess how much it was. I'm sure it was closer to a 1/4 teaspoon.

I think these are great just as they are- baked up perfectly at 425º, and the icing drizzle really makes them pop.  I will definitely be making these again.

The scones were good, and the pumpkin flavor was evident, but I prefer a traditional scone. They were nice to serve during the Thanksgiving weekend though.

I made the following changes: mixed the dry ingredients in the food processor and added the butter in there. Added 1/4 c sugar to the pumpkin mixture, and brushed with milk and topped with cinamon sugar before baking. They are tasty, and not very sweet. Adding icing to the top would be delicious for those that want a sweeter scone. Yum!

I used quick oats and they turned out fine.  I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar and they were still not sweet enough, even with icing.  I tend to like healthy/non-sweet things, but they need a bit more sugar.  The texture was dry which is how I like my scones. They could used more of the spices as well.  The poster who suggested cutting in the butter with a cheese grater is a genius!

had a craving for pumpkin scones... I used half whole wheat flour, tossed in some walnuts, raisins and almost 1/4 c. honey.  Tastes great, lightly sweet and yummy fresh out of the oven!  Don't even need the glaze

I thought these were great. I did use whole wheat instead of all purpose flour to up the nutritional value and added extra pumpkin and 1/3 cup brown sugar (other reviews said it wasn't sweet enough.) I used the glaze suggested then also melted 1/3 chocolate chips and drizzled that on top as well. Plenty sweet. Delicious treat. Thanks for sharing.

These were really good as-is, but too cake-like for a scone. I made a few adjustments the second time and they were perfect (for my taste). I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp, reduced the butter to 4 tbsp, reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and added 2 tbsp of brown sugar. I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and eliminated the egg. I also added 1/2 cup of raisins. For the glaze, I used 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, 3 tsp milk, and 1/8 tsp ginger and cinnamon.Baked at 400 for 15 min. This is a keeper!

I think these scones are delicious and very flavorful.  I thought maybe the sugar was left out so added a dash.  After reading comments wish I had used brown sugar.  I used whole wheat flour, turned out great.  How anyone could say these are bland??????

I have not tried many scone recipes, but I am a scone-fan and greatly enjoy this recipe. I have made them twice, the first time true to the recipe, and this time I replaced the butter with olive oil. They are quite moist, and I may have undercooked slightly for the outside is a bit soft.  The flavor is great! However, I will say the recipe calls for too much nutmeg. And I love nutmeg. I would half the amount. Great recipe - thank you!

Blah. I didn't read the 5 star reviews before I made these -- almost every reviewer added sugar to the mix! I would try this again with sugar in the dough, but this recipe straight is pretty bland, almost salty in taste. The icing only helps a little.

These scones do not have any sweetener in them.  They are dry and flavorless.  I followed the directions exactly.  I'm sure they'd taste better if I tweaked them by increasing spices and pumpkin and adding sweetener, but I think the recipe submitted should stand as it is.

these are ridiculously good.  i read the reviews and used half whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup brown sugar.  the frosting needed 4 tblsp milk instead of 1.  I will be making these and sharing them with friends and neighbors.  They'll make great holiday gifts too!  YUM!

I made this a 5 star recipe by increasing the spices to about 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of "pinches", and I added cinnamon chips.  Also, I used the Vanilla glaze recipe by Jamie Langston on this site and added pumpkin pie spice to that.

Really good. Added about 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 cup pumpkin puree and raisins. Will make again.

I thought this recipe was excellent. It took well to minor tweaks in the ingredients. (i substituted pumpkin puree for the oil, and added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the icing). Perfect the very first time!

Loved this! I use slightly less oates than recipe calls for and added about 1/2 cup of local honey.  These will become a fall staple in my home.

These did not work out for me. There wasn't nearly enough pumpkin flavor. Is 3/4 cup of pumpkin accurate? They tasted floury and oatmealish. I was quite disappointed. These also lacked scone texture likely due to the temp/baking time. If I make these again I'm bumping up the pumpkin and baking at 350 and I will check them after 20 mins. Also the directions were phrased oddly, I had to re read them about 5 times mid knead.
UPDATE- I tried these again tonight (I really want some scones!) but these still don't work for me. I make pumpkin cookies with oatmeal and I love them but it just doesn't taste right in these scones. Not sure about the butter either. Anywho I bumped the pumpkin up to a cup, added some honey and added a little more flour while folding because it was so wet. Baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. Still a no go. Lowering my rating from 2 to 1 star.
