Delicious soup! Used 8 cups of broth and no water. Made our own meatballs, didnâ€™t add any cheese.

I cut the portions back to 4 and used Pecorino Romano instead of Asiago. I also used all chicken broth no water. I loved how fast this came together for a quick lunch. #Allrecipesallstarscanada #Soup Stew Chili

This Meatball; Soup is excellent. I make a huge pot so we can freeze some meals. I will make it again. Good winter soup for us.
