This soup is fantastic!!  The only changes I made was to use a whole pound of ground beef and I added a can of green chilis.  If you wanted it hotter you could use Rotel tomatoes instead of the crushed.  Will make over and over again!  My whole family scarfed it up!

This one will get rave reviews from all ages.  It's a hardy soup that my family found addicting!  I used flour tortillas in place of chips.  Very good!

Great recipe!  I really enjoyed it although I must admit I didn't follow it exactly.  First, I used one can of low sodium/low fat chicken broth plus three cubes (plus water) of boullion.  Second, I used fresh tomatoes I had quartered and frozen plus one small can tomato sauce.  I only had one can corn and I used ground turkey.  The spices I kept the same which is the important part.  Lastly, I had no cornstarch so thickening the soup was not done and I used corn tortilla chips since that's all that I had.  Thanks for sharing!

Great!  I've made this soup many times now and really like it compared to other recipes, even though I usually prefer chicken to beef.  I live alone but made a full recipe to have for lunches this week and to freeze for future meals.  This time, I made it with beef broth, doubled the meat, and only put it 1 can of corn.  I also used shredded cheddar instead of American and used broken-up blue corn tortilla chips and chopped avocado as the garnishes.  These garnishes really make the dish complete! Sour cream would be great too.  This is a great meal as it has a good amount of spice.  There isn't much of a difference when using beef stock compared to chicken stock.  The first one is just more "beefy," obviously!  The cream corn is a nice touch.  Finally, if I were going to recommend any alterations to the recipe, I'd say to DEFINITELY double the meat. I added in just over a pound and I think anything less would have been too little.  Thanks for sharing! Enjoy, everyone!

Great recipe. The entire family liked it and said it is a keeper. A good change of pace from Chili. However, after wondering what to do with the other half of a package of ground beef I decided to put in a full pound. It turned out just right for the 8 very large servings it makes. Thanks Erin for a tasty recipe.

I cooked this in a crock pot.  I used one whole pound of ground beef and  added 1.5 cans of black beans and 1/2 can of whole corn.  I only used 1 big box of chix broth and did not use the C of water.  Used one 14oz can of tomatoes blended and two cans of rotel (one blended).

HUGE hit in the house!  I switched the beef for chicken.  I poached chicken in my favorite spicy seasonings and just shredded it up for the soup. Instead of putting the tortilla strips in the soup I just placed 2 corn tostadas in each bowl. Only 3 people in my house so I adjusted the ingredients for 4 servings and had leftovers for 2 days at work.  Soup only gets better. I went a bit heavy on the cayenne, chili powder and cumin and it was delicious.  Amazing recipe!!

This recipe makes a LOT of soup!  I used half crushed tomatoes & half diced tomatoes with jalapenos, and increased ground beef to 1 lb.  Crushed tortilla chips over the top.  I like the previous reviewer's idea of avocado.

I read the reviews and saw someone else had used wheat tortillas. So that's what I did and it wasn't good at all!! So I fished out the tortilla strips and put in corn tortilla chips instead. It is much better now and was a quick save or I'd have thrown it all out.

This was great! And so easy.
I used cooked cubed chicken instead of beef, and I used tortilla chips instead of real tortillas and 3 cheese mexican cheese instead of the cheddar. The pot was empty by the end of the night! This is not a broth like soup but more of a rich creamy sauce. Served with avocado and chopped cilantro. This was great thanks for sharing

Excellent base. I used 1 lb. beef, 3 cloves garlic  cooked with 1/2 chopped onion and beef. I used 2 cans tomato quick pulsed in blender. I used 1 can creamed corn and 1 can regular corn. You can add more spices as needed. I served it with pepper jack cheese and pizza peppers on the side to use as desired. I also doubled the tortillas, dicing two for the soup and toasting the others to put on the bottom of the bowl before adding the soup. Excellent casual meal for company.

Awesome on a cold day!! I added a full pound of ground beef and whole corn instead of creamed corn. I also spiced it up with some Louisiana hot sauce.  It was well received.

The flavor was good! I threw in some rice; which helped thicken it up. We roll up the tortillas and dip them in instead of cutting them into strips. I'll save this recipe and next time I'll add black beans instead (for something different).
