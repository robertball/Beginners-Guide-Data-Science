Made exactly as described and it was super easy. A little spicy for the kids but great shredded chicken for burritos salads etc.

This is a keeper.
 I made the sauce in the food processor and dumped it over the chicken and black beans in my instapot. Set the pressure for 12 minutes and let it naturally release for 10 minutes. Roughly 30 minutes later I was enjoying a delicious dinner.

I'm thinking of adding a sweet potato and quinoa to create a chicken bowl. Yumm!

This was tasty!  I halved the recipe, but when I make it again I will do the six-serving version for the sauce because it could have used a little more sauce.  I had it over rice with some sour cream and fresh avocado.

Made this recipe exactly as written. It was very good, easy with minimal ingredients. Nobody in the family found it too spicy, we usually eat mild to moderately spicy for reference.

So good!!!! I put on salad, my husband had his in a warm tortilla, also on toasted garlic bread, made a quesadilla also. Itâ€™s so versatile!
