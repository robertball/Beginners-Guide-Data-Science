This is a very basic, 'gist' of a Pittsburgh style sandwich. I live in Pgh, and am a big fan of Primanti's. Vinegar based slaw is a MUST. Also, the fries have to be FRIED, not baked. Don't try to save calories on this one. Also, fresh, hand sliced italian bread is key. It's nice and soft, so after the sandwich is made, you can press it down and dip it in hot sauce. YUM.

This is a copycat of Primanti Brother's sandwiches - famous in Pittsburgh and oh-so-delicious!  You can use any meat - I prefer capicola.  Heat the meat in a pan with provolone on top until it's warm and the cheese is melty.  Put it on Italian bread (I cut mine in slices to be more authentic), pile on some fries (not thin fries but not as thick as steak fries - homemade are best), then a vinegar-based cole slaw (not mayo-based).  I used the Amish Slaw recipe from this site and it works great!  Best sandwich ever!!!

Yep -- fries & slaw on a sandwich; it's a 'Burgh thing.  After a move to the Kansas City area a few years ago, I started missing my Pittsburgh foods and have been making my own Primanti's sandwiches at home, which is what this recipe is based on. If you have the time & equipment, I'd recommend making your own fries -- better tasting, IMHO.  Secondly, use a vinegar-based slaw/dressing, if you're really going for authenticity.  Lastly, you can use any type of meat in this sandwich -- cappicola is one of my favorites, as is steak with a fried egg.  Now, if I could only replicate Kennywood cheese fries at home.... =)

This was freaking awesome to have on a Sunday night dinner for my three men. They loved having a sandwich they saw on "Diners, Drive-in's and Dives" sandwich and I get to clean out my freezer. I used Oreida french fried potatoes that I spiced up with Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning and I made my own coleslaw. To say this was a huge hit would be an understatement and you can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you like. It's great!

stikychikn  must not have actually made one.  This is the sandwich celebrities and presidential hopefuls seek out when they come to Pittsburgh because despite what it sounds like, it is an amazing sandwich.  Any deli meat will do and as others have suggested, use vinegar based coleslaw and don't be cheap with the calories.

I gave you four stars due to it's named a Pittsburgh style sandwich and not Primanti style for ALL Pittsburgher's know....never use a mayo based coleslaw!!!  Must be a vinegar base coleslaw and the fries are fried not baked for a TRUE Primanti sandwich.

It was pretty good, serve immediately! I waited a bit and it was just okay. Ended up throwing it in the microwave for 40sec.

Being from Pittsburgh, this sandwich is a staple. This is a great play on it too! I used a sausage patty made from Johnsonville hot Italian sausage instead of lunch meat, and I have to say that it was fantastic! I agree w/ others that said it doesn't matter what kind of slaw you use (it's not specified in the recipe which to use, so use what you like), this is one tasty sandwich~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Five guys fries work very well(if there's one in the area), an apple vinegar coleslaw base with a bit extra sugar made it taste very close to the original.
