Served with Yaki Mando & Kimchi Fried Rice.  Par-Cooked chicken ahead of time and came out pretty tasty.

I made this soup minus the fish sauce and shrimp since I have a shellfish allergy and I replace the chicken breast with drumsticks since it hold the flavor better in soups to me. Love love love this recipe!

This soup came out wonderfully!
I did however double the recipe and I baked a black peppered pork tenderloin and cut it into thin slices to place atop the soup when serving. We didn't have lemongrass at the store so I opted for the zest of a lemon and the juice of half a lemon (only use half a lemon squeezed if you're doubling recipe).
Again this soup was wonderful and it made my husband and I very happy.
