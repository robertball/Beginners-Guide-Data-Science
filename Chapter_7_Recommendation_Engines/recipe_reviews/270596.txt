I think this was very good.  I made it as written and will do so again, perhaps trying some different and additional vegetables.  I could not find the dried red chile so I used some garlic chili paste, which works as long as you are careful as it's very hot.

Instead of cornstarch and want it to be authentic and better tasting you should use tapioca powder. All in all though great recipe well done!
