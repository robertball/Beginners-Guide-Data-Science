we did not have heavy cream so I used sour cream.  I did add onion, even my picky eaters  liked it. I think italian sausage instead of bacon would be a good exchange.

After getting a very large bag of spinach from my mom, I needed something to use it in other than salad. On these cold winter nights, this was the perfect recipe! I do have two children with dairy allergies, so substituted unsweetened almond milk for the half-and-half and this soup was still so creamy and delicious! Will definitely make this one again.
