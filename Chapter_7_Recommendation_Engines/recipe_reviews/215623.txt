My bananas were REALLY super ripe (I dug them out of the deep freeze--trying to use up everything in the deep freeze to save on money), so I cut the sugar back by half. I also used all whole wheat white flour. My batter was a little dry so I threw in one more mashed banana--could be because I used all whole wheat white. I got twelve biggish muffins and one small "gift" loaf pan out of one recipe. Awesome basic banana bread that is full of flavor and the plain yogurt gives it a nice little twang. This was quick to make and will provide a nice snack/breakfast for tomorrow PLUS a nice random act of kindness for a special friend with the extra "gift" loaf. Thanks for sharing! NOTE: I didn't notice Rachel's review on her own recipe until after I'd made the recipe. For me, the amount of flour was perfect. If I'd added another 3/4 of a cup, it would really have been too dry. I'm not sure if it has been fixed since November, but as the recipe looks presently with 3/4 cup of each=1 1/2 cups of flour total, it worked out perfectly. EDITED: I've made this particular recipe many times now and it's always a hit with us here in my home but all my husband's family and coworkers love it, too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

It looks like during the publishing process of this recipe one essential ingredient was taken out.    The recipe is missing another 3/4 cup of all purpose flour.

Granddaughters made this, 5-9, used a potato masher.  Find quick breads get tough with a mixer. 
Used Yoplait WHIPPED Chocolate yogurt, NOT SUGAR FREE one.  Used the whole 6 ounce (whipped made less.)
My neighbor taste tested blindly and demanded the recipe.  I made the rest exact as listed, same amounts, except the yogurt.   Oh, used mini pans (3 = 1 large) and time was 35 minutes.   Cooled 10 minutes then wrapped and frozen immediately.  We are making items for the county fair.  Moisture disappears within the first 15 minutes of quick breads cooling. Even if going to use it later, freeze moisture in. Then thaw still wrapped.

After seeing that the recipe was short 3/4 c. flour, I just used 1 1/2 c. of whole wheat.  The bread turned out very moist with the perfect level of sweetness.  Required a little more time in the oven to firm up.

This recipe was rather good. I don't have any complaints other then hmmm, nope nodda ;-) My bread came out nice, thick not dense, light flavor of spices with a very telling taste of banana. Can sub sour cream for yogurt...but I used Greek Yogurt in mine. This is a keeper.

Kid approved!  My girls are loving these healthy muffins. I used. 1c of whole wheat flour and 1/2c of white.  I also used sugar substitute instead of real sugar. Moist and delicious and a great way to use up over ripe bananas. Thanks!

I love this bread and it has become my go-to banana bread recipe! I have made it as written and it was amazing, but I have also had to make substitutions due to not having stuff in the pantry, so I will share with you what has worked in the past. 
I now substitute butter-flavoured shortening because it's less expensive and I do not find it makes ANY difference in texture/flavour. I often don't have vanilla yogurt, so I use strawberry...again, no noticeable difference. I use all white flour with great results as well. I have made it with 2.5 bananas  because I didn't have the 3, and I always add 2 handfulls of chocolate chips because my kids love banana bread with chocolate chips. I have made it into a loaf as written, and I have also made it into muffins, which usually takes around 35 minutes in my oven. i almost get 2 dozen muffins from this recipe. 
When I use these substitutions, I have used them one at a time as needed, or have used them all at the same time...the recipe is great either way!
I hope you try it...it's a great and versatile recipe.

I received rave reviews. I reduced the sugar by about 1/3. Used 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup almond flour, and an extra 1/2 banana. For yogurt I used greek. I also added a hand full of dried cherries, shredded coconut (the good stuff from the health food store) and some pecans pieces on top. VERY moist and full of flavor. Butter wasn't needed, they were yummy plain!

I made a few changes... Instead of the butter I used unsweetened apple sauce.  I used 4 bananas instead if 3.  I sprinkled walnuts on top to decorate (didn't have enough to actually bake in the bread).

I did not care for this recipe. Likley WOULD be a good banana bread if it had less baking soda added, but the one I made came out with that terribly bitter aftertaste that indicates too much of the aforementioned ingredient. Big dissapointment for my whole family.

Instead of butter, I used apple sauce. I used only 1/4 cup of white flour (it was all I had left) and the rest whole wheat. Instead of yoghurt I used sour cream because that is what I had in my fridge. I baked for 18 minutes for 11 muffins. Very moist and delicious!

I made this vegan by substituting the yogurt with applesauce and the egg with 1/4 C. water + 1 tsp of Vegg vegan egg alternative. Added 8 chopped dates and about 1/2 C. chopped walnuts. So good!
Ended up baking it for 75 minutes and it was crunchy on the outside but super moist on the inside.

This is a great recipe!  We prefer generally less sweet desserts, so i lowered the sugar down to 1/3 cup, to suit our family's preferences.  No damage to texture or taste, with slightly reduced sugar.   I put these into muffin tins (with silicone liners), 375 degrees, 18 minutes and they came out fantastic.

My family adored this.  I added a few chopped walnuts, a handful of sweetened coconut and used coconut oil instead of butter for the fat. It disappeared in a few hours.

I doubled the recipe but didn’t have enough bananas so I used applesauce to make up the difference. They were delicious but I think that was too much butter. I also used 1 cup flour, 1 cup ww flour, and 1 cup oats.

This was delicious, and I am not easy to please!  I used self-rising flour (and omitted salt) because that is all I had, and added a few chopped walnuts and dried cranberries.  It was perfect except for being a little crumbly, which I think may be because of my flour.

I reduced this recipe by 1/3 of everything since I only had 2 bananas. I omitted the vanilla since I used vanilla yogurt. I also added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts and sprinkled extra on top. It made 9 muffins, baked at 375 degrees for 18 minutes.

Very nice dense bread. I had 2 large bananas that I chunked,  used all whole wheat flour, and added 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut. I put everything in my bread machine and used the quick bread cycle. Came out great and very tasty!

I added about 3/4 cup of finely chopped pecans, and baked it in mini-loaf pans.  Wonderful!!!!  

Last week I made a batch, and made another batch yesterday, my grandkids love this banana bread.

Wished I had used a little more leavening agent as the centre was undercooked and edges were slightly overcooked after 60 minutes.  Tastes great!

Not too sweet but not lacking in sweet either. The amount of flour in the recipe worked just fine. Was glad for the tip of substituting three gift-sized loaf pans per large one.

I made a few substitutions. I used brown sugar, all white flour, one egg and one egg white that (i beat before adding anything), four ripe bananas, used 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of butter, and pink Himalayan sea salt instead of kosher. I folded everything together and only used my mixer to whip the eggs. I topped with flax seed before baking. I used a clear glass pan and baked on 375 for around 80 minutes and it was still gooey. I am blaming my additions and not the recipie

Husband and I agree this is the best banana bread we have ever had! Straight out of the oven it was AMAZING. We'll see tomorrow how it handles being day-old! I did only cook it for less than 40 minutes. (I think my oven might be a bit hot.) And our bananas weren't even overripe.

I have never left a review even though I have used this site for years! This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. I always try a new recipe every time I make banana bread but I won't any longer! The only changes I made were adding walnuts and chocolate chips(which I always include with any recipe.)
