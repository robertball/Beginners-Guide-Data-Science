My batter was extremely thick and I could not coat the chicken pieces. After adding another 1/2 cup of water and an additional 1/4 tsp baking soda the batter was of a dipping consistency. I added 1 chopped green bell pepper and upped the fresh pineapple to 1 cup, adding both to the sauce. I was unable to taste the orange marmalade and if I ever make this again I would leave it out. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Love what she did.  I too added red and green bell peppers, some halved cherry tomatoes, some onion, and used the juice from the can of pineapple instead of so much water.  Good directions in the recipe.  What came out was better than most Iâ€™ve had in restaurants.  I served over basmati rice.

Very good but, kind of boring as written. Add a red bell pepper and an onion..both in  bite size pieces and you've got a great dish!

This dish is good, but excessively sweet, even though I reduced the sugar in the sauce to 3/4 cup.  If I make it again, I'll try it with 1/2 cup of sugar.
