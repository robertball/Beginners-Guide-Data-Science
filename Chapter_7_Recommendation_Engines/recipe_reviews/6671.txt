I've made this recipe twice, the first time I followed instructions and it was really good, but after a few tweaks it was GREAT!  I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat, and I used 3/4 cup rolled oats and 1/2 cup of steel cut oats for more texture.  I also used slightly less molassas and substituted honey instead.  DELICIOUS!!!

Great bread!  Very smooth texture.  I was very worried that it would be dense, but despite appearances, it was light and fluffy.  Rose very well.  It only took 3 hours to rise and then I had to take it out of the fridge because it was getting too big.  I would advise letting it rise on a cookie sheet... there is no way it would have been contained in a bowl.  Wonderful flavor.  Quick oats worked as well as any.  NOTE:  The author does not recommend cooking time... this was done for me in 35 minutes.  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.

This bread was wonderful. Making it and letting it sit overnight was great. It was quick to put together in the morning. You need a very large bowl to have it sit over night. It really rises and needs lots of room. It is really a delicious bread.

The best oatmeal bread I have made!
Based on an earlier review I was leary about the amount of molases so I went 50/50 molases and honey. To my taste the result was perfect. I made it into two very large sandwich bread loaves.  The result a very soft, light, well textured sandwich bread.

Delicious bread, and this recipe is very adaptable!  I like true whole-grain bread, so I only used one cup of white flour.  Other than that I used a mixture of wheat flour, the oats, rye flour, and flaxseed meal.  I also went 50/50 on molasses and honey.  The result is a nice tender crumb, great for toast, and the overnight directions make this very easy!!!

I got 3 9x5 loaves and one mini loaf. The bread is light and fluffy and tastes really good. This would make a good sandwich bread. It's pretty easy to make too; you just have to plan ahead a bit.

This is GREAT!!!  I do believe I've found our all-the-time bread.  I didn't notice people's idea of using part honey but it was still great with all that molasses.  Will use half or maybe even all honey from now on (mostly because it's cheaper).  I used all whole wheat flour (and added at least a cup more flour than the recipe said) and it still turned out light, fluffy and wonderful.  My husband will love sandwiches made with this bread--he likes softer bread.  For me, this recipe made one large loaf and 5 large rolls that I baked together in a second loaf pan.  I promptly polished off 2 of the rolls with butter for breakfast.  Baked the bread for about 25 minutes.

This bread is really tasty and very moist, but I think that you have to reduce the molasses to 1/4 c and add a 1/4 cup of honey, even at that, there is a slight molasses flavor. I let the bread rise in a giant Tupperware bowl in the fridge for 6 hours, and it pushed the lid up, so make sure you give it a lot of room to grow.  I started it in the a.m. and had fresh bread for dinner. I made two large loaves of bread, and my daughter just loved the cheese sandwiches I made with it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread was really good. The slow-rising in the refrigerator didn't work so well, so I took the bread dough out and it rose beautifully.

Easy recipe and excellent results. I didn't have time to do an overnight rise and it wasn't necessary. Just 1.5 hours and the dough was doubled at 80 degrees (placed on top of oven turn to warm). The dough was a little tougher than I'm used to so the kneading was a bit of work but definitely worth it. I only had about 2 hours for the second rise and it worked fine. I made two large loaves but if I had more time for the rising could have made 3. I did substitute 1/2 honey (after reading the suggestions) but don't think I'll do it next time as I like the taste of molasses. I also added an extra cup of whole wheat flour but forgot to reduce the white flour but it didn't affect the bread. Tastes very good and toasts wonderfully. A really beautiful loaf of bread -- very hearty but not heavy.

Made a few suggested changes. Used half honey and half molasses. I also used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour. Great, sweet flavor and seems very light. Will be making again!

I haven't made fresh, homemade bread in probably 15 years....until today that is. I made this oatmeal bread hoping that it would taste like those loaves you get in restaurants while you are waiting for your meal. I think this recipe is pretty darn close!! After reading through all of the reviews I added 1/4 cup each of molasses and honey. I also used only bread flour. I ended up with two full sized loaves of thee most beautiful, moist, and tasty bread that I have ever prepared!! This is definitely a recipe I will use more often!

I am a bread baking fiend, and this one really fell a bit short in my book. First of all, it really, really needs more salt. Or, use a finer grain salt, like pickling salt. After I made this as it was, it had no flavor. Texture, yes. Egg sizes vary and you should try and use powdered eggs and cut the amount to one eggs worth. I would reccomend mixing 2 cups of flour with the warm wetworks and add the yeast. let it sit for about 20 minutes then start adding the rest of the flour. I make a lot of Rye and pumpernickel, and so the molasses concept didn't bother me. However, to speed the rising, I would definitely switch it to dark corn syrup or a honey mix. It make s a slightly lighter consistancy.

I scaled this recipe down so I would only make 1 loaf, also I didn't rise it overnight in the fridge, I just rose it regular. Also, I used all honey because I didn't have any molasses. It turned out tasty, but for some reason my breads are almost always flat. I'll get it someday.

Halved the recipe and subbed honey for half of the molasses.  This bread has a great flavor, but I was looking for something with a slightly lighter texture.  When I make this again, I'll use rolled oats (used quick oats this time because it's what I had).

I replaced molasses with honey (and increased the amount of salt), resulting in a wonderful bread that's gone without hours of being baked.

I didn't have all night, so I proofed the bread over my warm oven. I just gave it about twice as long as usual to proof each time. This bread is tasty and had a decent crumb. It could be used for sandwiches which is the ultimate test. That said, my loaves weren't pretty. They were fairly rustic looking which is not typical for this experienced bread baker.

Just made this recipe for the first time.  While it is light the loaves didn't get as tall as I would have liked.  I also had to let it rise for more than 90 minutes.  I think the next time I'll only make 3 loaves instead of the multiple loaves written in the recipe. Made it with honey, but next time will use 1/2 honey, 1/2 molassas because I think the molassas will add a good flavor.  Overall I like the texture and will probably make it again.

Made this in early December 2008, froze a loaf, and I am eating it right now.  It still tastes as good as when freshly baked.  I toast it and have it with butter.  So comforting.

Terrific!  I, too, used 1/2 honey instead of all molasses. Even with 1/2 honey it was still dark and had good molasses taste. Great texture and flavor!

Rich and crusty, this bread has a nice hearty flavor.
