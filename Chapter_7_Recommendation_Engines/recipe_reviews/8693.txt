My husband and I loved this dish!

I also used the suggested changes which include using 1/2 cup butter (instead of the 3/4 cup suggested), 1 cup of chicken broth (instead of 1 1/3 cup of water) in the stuffing, and 1/4 cup of milk (instead of 1/4 cup water) in the soup. 

I also mixed the chicken and onions into the stuffing. Then packed it down into the casserole dish and poured the soup on top. 

This is perfect for cool fall evenings!

My family and I absolutely LOVED it.  I'm giving it four stars only because I did a lot of changes, based mostly on other reviews.  I did all the prep in one pot.  Used only 1/2 c butter and put that in my stock pot.  Sauteed the onions and chicken in that.  (By the way, cooking onions in butter gives them a wonderful sweet flavor and infuses the butter with said flavor, dispersing it throughout the casserole. Mmmm!)  Stirred in chicken broth in place of water, stirred in soup, stirred in milk in place of water, stirred in my selection of herbs, spices and seasonings.  I used half seasoned stuffing and half unseasoned.  Tasted it and decided to lose the cheese.  Poured it into a 9X13 and baked it.  My changes for future attempts will be to add another cup of stuffing, then let the whole thing sit in the stock pot for about 10 minutes so the liquid is better absorbed.  (The center was a bit runny.  Still delicious!)  I'm thinking this will be a good "base" recipe.  I'm considering trying smokey, spicey sausage with cornbread stuffing and diced tomotoes for some southwestern flavor, and maybe some beef roast with mushrooms and wild rice stuffing.

This was very tasty.  Used low sodium chicken soup; low fat marg. and low fat cheddar.  Stuffing was a bit salty for me but we still enjoyed it.  Will make again.

Great - definitely make this!  Changes I made:  1-cut chicken breasts in pieces & sauted with onion, sage and garlic, 2- used only 1/2 c. butter - AND I would decrease more the next time, 3-used cream of mushroom soup.  Would be something I'd serve for a casual meal with company.  A bit salty - perhaps use low salt soup?  Yum!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I was nervous about adding the cheese because I did not think it sounded to great, but boy was I wrong! This is a recipe I will be making a lot. Best thing...it was quick and so simple. I had all the ingredients already. Thank you Dusti

This recipe is good but I already have a recipe that tastes similar so it wasn't such a sweet surprise afterall.  I used a little more stuffing than required and a little less butter. I also sauted the chicken with paprika, onion salt and S&P.  Good, but I think I'll stick with my mom's version of this recipe.

This dish ended up tasting surprisingly GREAT. Used only 1/2 cup butter... it's plenty. No water. Used cream of broccoli soup and mixed with 1/2 cup of milk. Added a layer of broccoli in between the chicken and stuffing to round out the meal. Used chicken broth in place of water and  half the amount of cheese. Tasted great leftover, as well. Thanks, Dusti!

Was a little skeptical with the condensed soup, but it was really good.  Followed the recipe exactly (which is unusual for me).  Will make again, but might tinker with some spices to flavor up a bit.  Thanks for the post.

This is an amazing, easy recipe. I added broccoli and mushrooms before I poured the chicken soup and I can't imagine this dish without it. The cheese didn't need to be there but it was otherwise a fantastic dish that I can stir up in no time. I will make again.

I had the same issue other reviewers complained of with the recipe being a little on the salty side.  I used low sodium chicken broth, but that didn't seem to matter.  But the dish was tasty and I will make it again.

This was very easy and tasty. Everyone loved it. The only thing I would do differently is add more stuffing. There did not seem to be enough stuffing to go around. I served it up with jellied cranberry sauce which just made it all the better. Thanks for a quick, tasty meal idea! I will make this again!!!!

I made this recipe as written, except I did substitute leeks and green onions because I had some that I needed to use. This was excellent!  Even my picky husband loved it.  It will definitely go into "heavy dinner rotation."

Followed recipe exactly, except I used Mozzarella cheese instead of Cheddar. It was a little dry, but overall it was an easy and tasty meal that the whole family enjoyed.

I just loved this recipe.  I came home one night after work and was not sure what to make, since I had all but he cream of chix soup (I changed to cream of mushroom) I thought that I would give it a try.  It was better than I expected and super easy.  My kids even liked it, and they do not like trying new things.  Thanks for the great recipe to add to my collection -- I will definitly be adding to to my dinner selections.

I have been looking for this recipe for a few years now - I had lost it! I have made something similar with the chicken in the past and it was one of my favorite meals. This time however, I made it with leftover turkey pieces from Christmas dinner. I used Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing, 3 C. and 1 C. of chicken broth. I added 3 Tbsp of butter melted with celery & onion. I forgot the second layer of turkey and poured the cream of chicken/water mixture on top of the stuffing and then topped with Mexican blend shredded cheese - it was delicious!

I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts because we prefer the dark meat, and decreased the amount of butter to cut down on fat.  Also, I added 1 tbsp. dried chives and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder to the soup mixture for more flavor, but was still a little bland for our taste.  I think I will try Stove Top stuffing mix next time as others have suggested.  Still, overall a very good and easy recipe!

This recipe was ok. Very salty even though I used low sodium soup. If I make it again, I think I will change it and use rice instead of stuffing.

I was looking for a kid friendly recipe, this wasn't it, it was very salty, I cut the butter back to a 1/4 of a cup and left everything else the same. I don't think I would make it again but thanks for sharing your recipe anyways.

I have to say this is probably one of the worst tasting meals I have had in a long time.  I threw the entire casserole in the trash after I tried it.

This recipe is good, however the butter could be scaled down to one stick.  The dish was so greasy when I took it out of the oven that my roommate and I had to swab it with papertowels before eating.  I added mushrooms and bell peppers which added veggies for a meal and made it taste even better!

This was good and pretty simple.  My teenage kids liked it.  Not exactly healthy, but good.  Tastes like thanksgiving kind of.

Delicous! I turn to this recipe every time I'm making a meal for a family from church who just had a baby, is recovering from surgery, etc. Everyone LOVES it, and I get great feedback each time. It's a favorite for my family as well! Tip: It will be easier to cut up the chicken breast pieces into cubes if it's a little on the frozen size. Do not let it completely defrost. I find it much easier this way. I love that you can make this from start to finish in less than an hour! Also, you can top with ANY cheese you like. I've used all kinds - parmesean, swiss, pizza cheese, taco cheese, etc.  Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we all do!

You do NOT need all of that butter-1/4 of a cup will work just fine.  Cut down on the water added to the stuffing to one cup and exchange a 1/4 cup of water for the soup to a 1/4-1/2 cup of milk.  Add a can of drained mushrooms, some italian seasoning to the chicken and the recipe will work great. Preparing it this way, it wasn't greasy or mushy.  I also didn't use an entre cup of cheese.  You'll get all of the flavor from just a half a cup.  Good luck11

This is one of my favorites from the slowcooker/casserole cookbook.  It's very easy, I usually have all the stuff on hand, and best of all, it's NOT TOO DRY.  My husband and I are big eaters, (a nice way of saying we're a little padded around the middle!) and for us, this recipe was very FILLING.  I plan on trying it with different flavors of stuffing and cream soups.  I'm surprised others have had problems with this...I should note I spread this in a 9x13 pan, rather than using a round casserole dish.  It was perfect textured, took the right amount of time, and definitely not too greasy or runny.  Maybe that's the problem?

Some of the reviews for this recipe were very poor and I have no clue what they are talking about.  We love this one!  I think it's very important before making a recipe to read other reviewers suggestions and try to follow the ones that sound good.  Per suggestions, I cut the butter back to 1/2 cup, used cream of chicken with herb soup, and added some extra Italian seasoning to the chicken and onion while it cooked.  This turned out fabulous!  My family loved it and we are now putting it into the "rotation" to make it regularly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was ok, but a little bland tasting.  The chicken needed some flavor and I didn't particulary care for the stuffing.

My husband & I really like this. I, as others suggested, used chicken broth with the stuffing & milk with the creamed soup. I also used a little butter while cooking the chicken & onion. I have R.A. & look for easy to make & also filling for my husband dishes. This fits the bill. Thanks for the recipe;it's added to my rotation.

This was really good and my wife liked it as much, if not more, than I did. I used less butter and used chicken stock instead of water. I also used a lot more dressing.  Next time, I'll try a few different things.... For one, I think, with all the dressing, some celery would be nice. And maybe use ground beef instead of chicken... Sounds good to me! I would like to thank Dusti for a really good and different recipe!!!

Pretty good.  I used mushroom soup instead of chicken and I sprinkled the top with frozen peas before adding the cheese.  I'll probably make this again.

This recipe looked so bad once it was cooked, I wondered what I had done wrong and almost ordered pizza.  However, once we tasted it, the entire family loved it.  My husband had thirds.  I will definitely make it again.

Super simple recipe that tastes good!  It was super the next day warmed up!  I will make it again with these changes, save 1/4 of the "stuffing" mixture to put ON TOP of the whole deal....Im a crunchy person!  Also, I wouldnt use the whole 1 cup of cheese, it just seemed a bit too strong of a cheese flavor, not smooth like the cream soup.  Oh yah, and I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup! ( a new kind I guess!)  All and all SUPER!

I used a little bit of olive oil when I cooked the chicken & onion.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I followed the recipe and once I had all the stuffing ingredients mixed (to see how much liquid there was compared to stuffing) the mixture was a bit watery, which some people may enjoy.  My family likes stuffing so I added a little more stuffing but not too much so it was still moist once baked.  My family enjoyed this and I am sure that they will request this again.

Tasty and easy!  You do NOT need all that butter....I only used 1/4 cup and it was plenty.  I also used chicken broth instead of the 1 1/3 cups water and used milk for the 1/4 c. water.  I did add some garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the chicken while it cooked for extra flavor.  Also, I just mixed it everything together and sprinkled the cheese on top.  With those modifications, we enjoyed it a lot.

5 stars with the changes I made, most from advice from others' reviews.  I left out the onion, seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash, only used 1/4 cup butter, mixed the soup (low sodium soup) with  milk, and added some frozen veggies.  It cooked up wonderfully and is requested from my boyfriend on a regular basis.  If possible, eat it all while it's fresh.  It's not quite as good re-heated.

If I could give it more stars, I would.  This dish is delish! The only changes I made, which aren't major are :  I added 1/2 a bag of frozen crinkle cut carrot rounds to  the chkn/onion mixture, and i used Cream of Chicken & Herb soup, instead of the plain Crm of Chkn soup, I also did not use the whole cup of cheese, just sparingly sprinkled on top (even though I love cheese!)  My boyfriend and I loved it, it will be one of the recipes I will definately use over and over again!  Great comfort food for Fall! :)

This recipe was very tasty.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water in the dressing and mixed the soup with milk.  Next time I will cut up the chicken in bite size pieces.  I will diffently make this again.

Hubby loved this one!  I cut chicken into cubes and added to cloves of garlic to saute.  I also thinned out soup with drippings from chicken pan in addition to 1/4c. water.  Reduced butter to 1/2c.  Good with Stove Top chicken flavored stuffing mix.  Yummy and easy!

Good recipe for family meal. It tasted great! I substituted mushroom soup for chicken soup.I have also seen a recipe like this which uses swiss cheese, 3/4 dry white wine and herb stuffing. It is delicious also. -- Thanks!

We loved this.  Very quick and easy to make.  Like the others, I used 1/2 cup butter and seasoned the chicken with paprika, onion salt and s&p.  Next time, I will leave off the cheese to lower the fat and just didn't think it was necessary.  Overall-great and easy!

I just made this and it was really good! I changed it a little... I can't ever seem to follow directions completely. I sauteed the chicken in bite size pieces first, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and mushroom soup, I added a can of mushrooms, I doubled the cheese and, finally I added a small bag of slivered almonds to the top. I also reduced the amount of butter.  This is really really good!!! Also- there is so much of this left that I would say it serves at least 6!

I improvised a bit by cutting the chicken into bite-size pieces before cooking it and seasoning it with salt and pepper.  I also added chopped onion and celery to the stuffing mix and prepared it according to the directions on the package.  I also doubled the amount of water added to the soup to make it a little thinner.  I doubled this recipe to feed a family of 6, and there was almost nothing left over.  I guess everyone enjoyed it!

My husband loves stuffing so this is now his favorite chicken recipe.  It was really simple.  I added a little fresh garlic to it.  Yum.

Great one for the kids - used whole wheat stuffing and 98% fat free soup.  We'll add it to the monthly menu rotation.

Very easy recipe.  I made this ahead and warmed it before serving and it was great.  My husband is picky about casseroles and he loved it.  No leftovers.  The only changes I made was to season the chicken with some Italian seasoning and used low-sodium stuffing.  Next time I make this I will replace the water with chicken broth.  I will make this many times in the future.

Well, this is comfort food, hearty and filling.  However, I don't think it had great flavor, just something easy to throw together.  And it was definely way greasy, I could feel my heart clogging.  I would recommend using less than half the butter stated, and also just a sprinkling of cheese should be enough if you want to make it healthier.

Based on other reviews I used less butter (1/2 cup) and chicken broth instead of the water. I used corn bread stove top stuffing and instead of the cream of chicken I used chedder broccoli, yum! Next time I will use less stuffing and maybe anotheer can of the soup, it was a little dry.

This is very, very good and easy.  I had left over chicken breast and wanted to make something different so I tried this recipe. After cooking the onion I stirred in my leftover shredded chicken breast and added some steamed broccoli to make it a complete meal.  I followed the advice of others and used chicken broth instead of water.  I used herb seasoned stuffing mix.  To save time I put all the chicken mixture in the bottom of dish, topped it with the stuffing mixture, then poured the soup mixture over the top. Baked it uncovered for 25 minutes, removed it from oven and covered it with the cheese then baked for 10 more minutes. Next time I going to add carrots and broccoli!

I've been in a cooking mood lately and I was trying to find something that my boyfriend would also enjoy when I came across this recipe. I convinced him that this would be something he liked, something he would eat. He finally let me make us dinner tonight...I took some suggestions from the other viewers such as substituting the 1 1/3 water for chicken broth and substituting milk for the cream of chicken mixture. I added garlic powder and salt to my chicken as I cooked it as took into consideration the butter suggestions before and only added 1/4 of it. I added the cheese to the end of the cook time. I was upset that the bottom of my mixture of everything burned. Not bad, but it was still fantastic. My boyfriend told me to keep the recipe and we will use this later, for us and for family gatherings. We love it...thanx!!

They should change the name of this to Chicken Slop. I only used 1/2 cup of butter, but, wow. It was NOT a casserole. I had to tell my husband it was chicken and stuffing chowder! Would NEVER serve to guests. The texture is strange, but, it tastes good. There is way too much liquid in this. I will never make this again. Stick with chicken and stove top.

My husband LOVES this stuff and says he could eat this every day!!!  I made a few changes though, I like to use boneless skinless thighs (they're cheaper). I also mix the soup with milk to make it a little richer.  I have also used chicken broth instead of water to mix with the stuffing mix, although it really doesn't change the flavor much!  Serve with a salad and makes a great meal and leftovers (although I never have much leftover) re-heat beautifully.  This is a real comfort-food meal that has the flavors of Thanksgiving without all the work.

Excellent Flavor - a definate keeper!
I did make adjustments also based on other reviews and only used 1/4 C butter, 1 C chicken broth, and milk to mix with the soup.  I also added garlic when satueeing the chicken and seasoned with Italian seasing.  Yummy!

I followed some advice in other comments by using  1/2 can chicken broth instead of the water and added 1/2 package of mixed vegetables with cream of chicken w/herb soup.  I would strongly suggest adding vegetables because it would've been pretty heavy otherwise.  Also, it's a great way to get the family to eat some vegetables for dinner.

With modifications, this recipe is excellent!! I used LOW FAT (99% fat free)/low sodium soup, reduced fat cheese, and 1/2 cup butter, and the texture turned out PERFECT (moist but not greasy). I also sprinkled about 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt into the stuffing mixture and layered about 1 cup cooked chopped broccoli. I used a 9x13 pan so chicken only made one layer, but the oven time stayed the same. Will definitely make again soon!

I make this dish quite frequently but a little different... The ingredient that many are missing in their reviews may be the vegetables. I half fill the casserole dish with a mix blend of frozen vegetables, then pour over top a can of cream mushroom soup, or cream of celery (mixed with half a can of water), then on the  top, cover over with prepared box of stove-top dressing/stuffing. I don't add cheese. Can't remember the time in oven...check the vegetables after 30 minutes. The stuffing on top should be lightly browned. It's a great quick dish.

Very good! Nice and gooey! This is an excellent and easy comfort food. I used 2% cheddar and 1/2 cup of butter rather than 3/4 to help cut back on the fat. Hey, anything helps! I, also, added mushrooms and celery. Canned mushrooms complimented this casserole better than fresh (I never thought those words could comefrom my mouth).

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It's very quick and simple to prepare.  I substituted a box of Chicken Stovetop for the bread stuffing.  And, as others have suggested, I substitued milk for water when mixing with the cream of chicken soup.

I used stovetop stuffing and seasoning.  It was an ok dish for weeknights, I wouldn't serve it for company though.  Good, but not spectacular.

I wouldn't serve this to guests, it was very sloppy. I really liked the taste of it but my boyfriend who isn't crazy about stuffing thought it was just ok. I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, substituted onion for garlic and spices. I used poultry seasoning, celery salt, salt, pepper, and paprika. I only had a can of low fat cream of mushroom which I used instead of cream of chicken and I only used 1/2 cup of margarine. I will make this again when I'm craving a turkey dinner but don't have the time.

I tried this recipe on a busy Monday night, cooking for 4 adults, a 12 year old, and a 2 year old.  It was quick and easy, and best of all it was DELICIOUS!  It will remain among my favorite chicken casserole recipes!

I read that this dish didn't have much flavor so I grabbed up my spices and went to town!!  I seasoned the chicken bits with various spices and sauteed it in the onions and minced garlic, for the stuffing I used Stovetop Stuffing Chicken Flavor!!!!  My husband positively raved about the taste of this dish and my 2y.o. daughter who won't sit still long enough to eat, gobbled it up too!!!!  As everyone has said, I will make a few adjustments next time, but overall awesome recipe!!

I found this recipe very simple and easy. However, I felt like it was most defintely missing flavor.

I followed some of the suggestions in prior reviews, and cut back the butter to one stick, added a little bit more water to thin the soup out, and cut up my chicken.  I also added some fresh garlic with the onions.  It came out wonderfully, my guests were quite impressed and immediately asked for the recipe!

This was a great dish!  I did add fresh mushrooms and minced garlic, sauted them with the onion, and I only  used one stick of butter.  It was fantastic.  My 3 and 1 year olds loved it, too.

The recipe was tasty, but too oily with the butter and cheese.  I will make it again and cut the butter.

This is my go to recipe. My family doesn't like onions so I don't use them and I use Chicken Stuffing instead of plain stuffing but beside that I follow the recipe and it always turns out great. Everyone I have ever made this for loved it, I have never had any complaints and everyone always asks me for the recipe. This is such a simple easy tasty recipe!!

I use the Stovetop chicken stuffing. Skipping the cheese will make it less fatty. I've made this with and without cheese and it was great both times.

This was very good. Hubby liked it. I followed suggestion of less margarine and using milk with soup.  I have a similar recipe that takes 2 hours longer to make - this is a good weeknight dinner and just as tasty.

I read the reviews before making this and replaced the water with broth and cut the butter down. It is tasty, how I imagined it would be considering the ingredients. A little salty, so if I make this again I will cut down the butter a little more- maybe just 1/4 cup. I also used milk instead of water for the soup mix and I mixed the cheddar in with the soup. It wasn't greasy as others had reviewed. I mixed the chicken with the stuffing as well. I didn't use much onion either. I thought it was good, just needs a few adjustments. My picky toddler loved it!

My husband and daughter are extremely fussy eaters, and this was a hit! My friend made it for us when we had our 2nd baby, and it was so good, we had to get the recipe.  She got it from here, and we loved it. We literatelly eat it just about every other week!  I just leave out the onion since my husband and daugter don't like onion, and they absolutely devour this dish!

This turned out great. I read reviews first and replaced the water with chicken broth. I added about 1 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning. I only used 1/2 an onion because it seemed to be plenty. Without the changes I would have given this 3.5 stars, but after my changes based on reviews, my family rated this a "keeper". We all decided the cheese wasn't even necessary. It was a little too moist, and so I think I will also cut back on the broth by a tablespoon or so the next time.

This recipe turned out great!  I changed it up a bit, only used 1/2 cup of butter, chicken broth instead of water, and I doubled the amount of stuffing.  I also mixed the chicken in with the stuffing before putting it into the oven, and I will definately be making this recipe again!!

My family loved it with the additions suggested by previous reviewers, only 1/2 cup of butter, stock instead of water, milk mixed with the soup and a generous layer of steamed broccoli. Great taste for a quick weeknight throw together dinner in one pot.

This is definately a keeper!  The only thing I did different was instead of condensed cream of chicken soup I used condensed cream of celery.  Hubby said the recipe is a keeper and my middle daughter (she's the picky eater) asked if I could make it again tomorrow!

My boyfriend and I liked the taste but found it  too runny.  Is there a way to make it less runny. It felt like there was way too much water.  Maybe I need to cut back on water substitute with chicken broth and add extra stuffing.  Don't know if I will try again.

This is a great recipe.  I found out halfway through making it that I forgot to get butter and it still turned out fantastic.  I can only imagine what how much better it would have been with a tad of butter.

This was a quick, easy, delicious recipe. Would be great for Thanksgiving or Christmas leftovers (i.e. Turkey and stuffing). Will make this again. I used Chicken flavored Stove top dressing. Worked great.

I loved this recipe and so did most of my family.  It was easy, quick and a full meal that I served with a side salad.  I will definitely prepare this one again.  My husband added more cheese and devoured it.

I thought when I was making this it seemed like a lot of butter. I should have read the reviews first. It was such a greasy slimy mess. It tasted okay, but I wouldn't say it was delicious, and I won't use this recipe again, although my husband thought it was good.

I used 1 pack of pre-cooked seasoned chicken (frozen food isle)and instead of 'layering' I just mixed it all together. The seasoned chicken made it takek MUCH better and cut down the prep time by 15+ minutes

This was very good !! My family really liked it. I used seasoned stuffing mix, 1/2 cup butter and chicken & herb soup.  It was a keeper. Will definitely make this one again.

Oh my gosh! What  a great fall dish! My family loved it!  I too  cut down on the margarine used (I do this in most recipes if I can get away with it).  I used Stove Top stuffing mix for chicken, and it was great!

The dish came out of the oven bubbling with grease all over the top. Apparently 3/4 cup butter is a lot more than I thought it was, not to mention all the grease from the cup of cheese. We should have used the turkey baster to suck it off, but I thought maybe that was how it was supposed to look. It didn't taste that great, and I was sick for hours afterward from all the fat. Imagine a meal of two cooked chicken breasts with some stuffing on the side: then pour 3/4 cup of melted butter and a cup of cheese over that. That's essentially what this meal is, and it's exactly what it tastes like.

This recipe was very tasty.  I did make a few modifications based on some of the reviews I read.  In the stuffing mixture I only used 1/2 cup of melted butter.  I also added mixed frozen veggies and celery to the onion chicken mix.  I will be making this again.

I have made this twice now...and we really enjoy it.  I did use a box of stuffing, and less butter(maybe 1/3, all that I had).  I added a bit of left over sour cream to the soup mixute.  I also added canned mushrooms and a leftover jar of chopped pimentos.  This recipe is great because it is tasty as-is...but there is plenty of room to "make it your own".

Wow-this is a great recipe!! I make this on the nights that I don't really have time to fuss.  To cut down even more on the cooking time I will cook a whole chicken or turkey with celery & onion--over the weekend and use the chicken stock for soup and cut up the rest of the chicken and freeze it.  Then when I go to make this recipe I just thaw out the frozen chicken---it takes under 10 mins to prepare.  So far I've tried a "Turkey" dried stuffing mix and a "Chicken & Herb"--the chicken tasted better, but I'm looking forward to trying different stuffing mixes. This recipe is going in to my "regular rotation" of meals that I make. Thanks Dusti

My husband liked this recipe but then again, he was brought up on casseroles and hot dishes.  I was looking for a tasty casserole and this is more comfort food.  It was OK to me and I will make it again for my husband but I like something with more kick.

I made this exactly the way the recipe stated and was not impressed. I will try it again but next time cut down the butter and flavor up the chicken. My stuffing was wet and soggy and way too heavy with flavor. My husband really liked it though so I will experiment next time.

This was very good!  My husband and kids really liked it.  I (like others) cut the butter back to 1/2 C. and seasoned the chicken with paprika, salt and pepper while cooking it.  It was a definite success, and I WILL make this again for my family!

EXCELLENT recipe. It's one of those "good to taste" but not "good for you." The amount of butter is my concern.I made the recipe with the butter(not all of it though) and it was still fabulous. Next time I will try chicken broth instead. This would be a good dish for guests even!

This was awesome! The butter seemed alittle high so I cut it in about 1/2, it was so good there were no leftovers. We had a professional chef here fo diner that night and he couldn't say enough about this dish. So simple and easy anyone could make this.

I'm a really bad cook but I made this for Kelly because I wanted to impress her.  She either really liked it or was just trying to be nice and say she did... either way I think it was a success.  If you can't cook a thing and just wanna look like you can... this is your recipe!

AWESOME! My 15 year old daughter made this using 1-inch chicken pieces and mushroom soup (it's what we had in the pantry). This was so incredibly good that I told her she couldn't make it any more or I would get too fat.

This is one of our favorite meals. I don't cook the chicken before hand, just put it in a 9x13 sprayed baking dish and then layer on slices of what ever cheese I have on hand ( the original recipe I got from my cousin called for Swiss) some  drained canned mushrooms or green beans,  the soup, ( I like to make my own condensed soup, usually cream of celery) top it with the stuffing mix and bake for one hour covered with foil and then uncovered 15 minutes more or until the stuffing starts to brown.

Modifications were made, but the bones of this recipe are pretty good, if a little greasy for our taste. We used Swiss cheese on top--only about 2.5 ounces-- and only a half can of the soup. We also added broccoli, as many have suggested. I imagine that, as written, it would have been much much too heavy/greasy for us.

I love this for a hearty dinner that I usually have ingredients on hand for. I've made some modifications (cube the chicken and cook together with the onions, mix in a can of green beans) and turned it into a casserole (throw everything but the cheese and cream of chicken soup into a baking dish, mix the cream of chicken with a little milk, pour over the top and add the cheese on top of that) and it's one of mine and hubby's favorites.

I made this exactly as above and found it to be very bland and mushy. The next time I made it, I added the following to the chicken/onion mixture: 

- 2 Tb minced garlic (from a jar)
- 1 tsp poultry seasoning
- 1 tsp salt

And I added the following to the soup mixture:

- 2 Tbs Dijon mustard
- 2 Tbs sour cream
- 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup (to make extra gravy)

This really helped add depth to the flavors and made the sauce a little more distinct from the stuffing mixture. I also baked it a little longer so that the stuffing had more texture and less mushiness. Hubby really liked it!

This was really yummy.  Had a few additions...  Had frozen left-over, deboned chicken.  Fried 1 piece of bacon chopped.  Cooked onions in that.  Added 3 cloves chopped garlic.  Added some chopped fresh mushrooms.  Sauteed all of these in the bacon.  Added chicken to warm it up.  The rest was as per recipe.  I think some added fresh or frozen spinach would add a nice color plus some vitamins/minerals.  Really Good!

Pretty Easy!  Family liked it.  Used 1.5 lbs of chicken. Almost forgot to put only 1/2 chicken and onions on the bottom, then the stuffing, then the rest of the chicken on top part. I'd probably go with the suggestion to cut down to about a 1/2+ cup of butter next time.

This recipe is great and very easy. Followed the others reviews suggestions.  Added milk instead of water for the soup. Add some garlic along with the onions, and some extra spices depends on what you like. I would double the amount for the stuffing because i felt it need more. I also add some frozen veggies to make it a one dish meal.

Holy cow! My picky family dug right into this and cleaned their plates. This was a very pleasant surprise (feeding them can be a bit nerve racking). It was slightly salty for my tastes, so I'm going to play with the recipe a bit next time and see if I can't resolve that issue. Otherwise, it was fabulous!

This was simple to throw together on a busy evening, and my kids LOVED it. I wasn't as keen on it, but then again, I think it's more to do with the fact that we only had Sage & Onion flavoured stuffing mix, and it was a bit overpowering. I added a small tin of sweet corn, because my boys love it,and it did turn out quite well. Will definitely be making this again!

My husband loved this dish. I used Kelly T's ideas, but also added celery and garlic with the onion. I also used low-sodium cream of mushroom soup and it tasted great. Not too salty. I used Fresh Gourmet Seasoned Multi-Grain Stuffing wtih Cranberries and I think that added a nice touch.

Like some others have stated, this was way too salty...perhaps it would taste better with the new "low sodium" stuffing mixes. It was all right I guess, nothing spectacular though.

After seeing how many reviews this recipe had, I was hoping it would be a hit for our family.  It looked much better after cooking than the actual flavor.  It lacked flavor, and bread crumbs were mushy.  I even followed other reviewers' advice and used chicken broth in place of water.

I haven't even finished making this recipe, but I am excited. It was so simple, and before I added the cheese and stuck it the oven I had to sneak a bite. It is delicious. I used cream of mushroom soup and added snuck some peas in (I have a five year old who isn't a big veggie eater). I haven't made anything with stuffing before, but I will definitely be using this recipe (with different variations) over and over again!

This was pretty good.  I served it with mashed potoatoes and a veggie, and it seemed like a traditional "Sunday dinner" with a lot less work.  I added pepper to the chicken when cooking.  I think next time I make this I will use milk instead of water for the cream of chicken soup mix, and probably skip the cheese all together.  I love cheese...but I don't really know what it added to this recipe except extra calories. Thanks for an easy casserole though, I will make it again!

This needs a bit of tweaking for our taste.  Will try again starting with omitting the soup/water, instead, use a jar or two of Heinz Chicken Gravy.

This tasted great, but it turned out very mushy. I'd cut the amount of butter at least in half and add some veggies next time to give it more crunch.

Delicious! I modified the recipe per other reviewers suggestions- 1/2 cup butter, chicken stock instead of water, I also doubled the amount of stuffing ( we really like stuffing!) Family loved it, and it was so easy to make with stuff you usually have lying around the house. I will definitely make this again!

My 8 yaer old daughter was the only one who liked this. All I tasted was the soup. I think you need to mix it in, not spreasd it on top. Also I did what other reviewers suggested and used broth instead of water. That made it way to salty.

This was really good, but way too much butter. I used 1/2 cup and it was still too much. Next time I'll try 1/4 cup. Other than that, it was quick to throw together and pretty tasty.

I read most of the reviews and followed the most popular advice I only used 1/4 cup butter, I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 1 1/3 cups water and used 1/4cup milk instead of water I also added some frozen mixed vegetables.  I layered the ingredients but added the cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.  I agree with the  reviewer that stated it doesn't look that great but my whole family enjoyed the taste.  I served it with green beans and cranberry sauce (a little like Thanksgiving)I usually have grilled chicken in the freezer so this was quick and easy to assemble in the afternoon I will keep all the adjustments and make again.

This was pretty good, but way too much butter, and I LOVE butter.  Next time I'll reduce it 1/4 cup.  I'm giving this 5 stars because my kids loved it.  My husband and I thought is was ok, but when my picky eaters don't complain, it makes it all worth it.

This recipe really needs some spices! I used all chicken broth instead of water and cut it by 1/2 cup. The texture was good with a nice mouth. It would be a good dish for Thanksgiving if you were in a hurry. The down side was that this recipe is lacking in any type of spices. I put in jalepeno peppers and tabasco in the leftovers and it was delicious.

Pretty good.  I agree with some others that the presentation isn't great, but the taste is good.  I substituted chicken broth for the water in the recipe.

It had good flavor but I thought it had WAY too much butter and I only used a half cup, I also only added 1 cup of water. I will make again but with less butter.

Great dinner!  nice and hearty and perfect for Fall!  I just combined all ingredients instead of layering.  I used Stove Top's mushroom stuffing which was perfect.  My boyfriend didn't finish his last bite before he asked when I was making it again! 
I might throw in carrots to the mix to make it a one dish meal next time.

This recipe was very quick to make.  It had excellent flavor.  Everyone liked it except my picky 5 year old.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom soup.  I would recommend this dish and I will definately make it again.

we found that if you place the stuffing mix on top and bake then ad the cheese and bake a few min more the stuffing isn't quite so soggy. Flavored stuffing mixes work well in this recipe/

Pretty good. I made some changes to make the recipe more to my liking.  I didn't use onion. Instead cooked chicken with onion salt and Mrs. Dash. Also cut butter back to 1/4 cup.  Good suggestion.

I think I like my chicken and stuffing separate. I used the chicken with herbs soup and the chicken tasted great. I will not make "this" again but i will make the chicken like this and serve with stuffing.

Yuck.  A big gooey, greasy mess.  Taste was decent after draining some grease off and adding more stuffing mix.  Unfortunately, we didn't see the suggestions further down the review list before making.  Do yourself a favor and make this a somewhat decent dish by cutting back on the butter and water.

This turned out to be a big, sloppy ness. The taste was alright. I had to drain the greasy liquid and add more bread crumbs to make it edible. 
In my opinion, something that needs major tweaking to turn out right, does not deserve an average rating of 4 stars.

Too greasy.  I raised the temperature to 375, added more bread crumbs to the sides (where it was really greasy) and left it in about 10 minutes longer.  The taste was wonderful, however, the texture was still too mushy.  Perhaps less butter and water to the bread mix?

awful. I read others reviews and I cut down on the butter. I used 1/2 a cup and it was still greasy. It was mush with chicken in it. The soup was awful. I did not enjoy it at all. 2 thumbs down.

I took a lot of liberties with this recipe. I cooked the chicken with carrots, celery & onion. I was out of stuffing mix, so I used Italian style breadcrumbs, only 2T of butter & about 3/4 c water. I also used Cream of Celery soup, substituting milk for the water. I cut the cheese down dramatically (cheddar/jack mix) to just be moderately sprinkled over the top, maybe 1/3 cup.

It was creamy, not greasy, and very good. Even my three picky children ate it all up!

A family favorite. I did a few changes...1/4 cup butter, 1 cup water, 1/4 cup milk in place of 1/4 cup water and then only 1/2 the cheese. It wasn't soupy, only yummy. Thanks for sharing.

An excellent meal! Very easy to prepare if you are in a hurry. Everyone raved about this one. I did boil the chicken first though and used the stock from that instead of water. Also I added fresh mushrooms and sauteed with the onions.
