Excellent breakfast burrito!  I always cook the chorizo sausage and drain it to avoid a bunch of grease and cook the eggs and onions separately. I also have a non-stick pan so no need for cooking spray.  These were so good, especially with some salsa on the side!

I've been making these for a long time without a recipe...and they are definitely a fan favorite.  I have found there are a few tips to avoiding a greasy mess.  1.  Drain the chorizo a bit. and 2. push the chorizo off to one side of the pan and scramble the eggs by themselves and then mix them with the chorizo.  This helps keep chorizo from muddying up the whole thing.

Thought this would be like what I got back home in Texas.  These were good, but not "eggy" enough for me.  I will make these again, but use more eggs next time, as I want a more of a scrambled egg type burrito.  This was all meat, like no egg at all in it.

very good, but be sure to use "beef" Chorizo as the pork kind is a bit too greasy.

Tasty recipe. This was the first time I had used chorizo so I wasn't sure how long to cook. This isn't the prettiest dish but it tasted good. I used canned diced green chiles as a timesaver. Will make again. Served with a potato/onion side dish.

I used beef chorizo.  Added another egg.  Didn't use any peppers, family doesn't like spiciness, BUT I DO ~sigh~.  Did fry up some potatoes to add to the burrito mix....yummy.

So so so good! Just the way I like them. The proportions were exactly right! I made them for my husband to take to his co workers ( and of course some for me too) everyone enjoyed them!!! Be sure to not get cheap chorizo. I got mine from a great butcher. Get quality and you will taste the difference.

These are very good!  I changed it up a little by making more of a quesedilla by using Pam and grilling the tortilla and adding the chorizo, egg and some cheddar/jack cheese.  Yummy!!  My kids really enjoyed this for Sunday breakfast.  They are quesedilla addicts!

Store didn't have chorizo, so I substituted sage ground sausage. I drained is as other reviewers have suggested. I also used a yellow onion, 1/2 c red bell pepper & 1 clove of garlic. Also used  a 4 oz can of  green chiles, drained and chopped.   I liked it :)

I have to give it 5 stars with slight changes:  I used chicken chorizo sausage that I found at Trader Joe's. Also eliminated onions to make it lower in carbs tho I love red onions andI eat w/o the tortilla.  Good w/a variety of different cheeses too.  My teen son and husband love it so much they ask for it regularly!! Delicious and satisfying!!

These are wonderful. The only way to go is to use Basque (instead of Mexican) Chorizos. They are very hard to find but Gem Meat Packing Company in Boise Idaho makes the best and most authentic chorizos.

My family is Mexican so we grow up eating chorizo and eggs regularly and I have to say I have never had chorizo with onions and eggs.  I thought it was delicious!  I use soy chorizo now that I am grown since it is less fatty.  My husband loved this (although we did not serve it as burritos, we made tacos instead using corn tortillas).  I used about 1/4 less of the chorizo than called for since we made used some earlier in the week.  It was great!

I used this recipe as a reference and went my own way. I cooked a yellow onion and garlic in the pan with the chorizo and added a chopped orange pepper, a can of Rotel, a can of seasoned black beans (drained), and chopped green chiles from a can (I have found that buying the whole chiles and chopping them yourself is REALLY easy, and has much better texture and flavor) and fresh cilantro that I had leftover. I fried eggs separately, warmed corn tortillas in the oven and served it open face topped with over easy eggs, Queso Fresco & salsa, INCREDIBLE and not that much more work. With my leftovers I cracked 4 eggs directly into the mixture and scrambled it all together in the pan, wrapped up individual burritos with cheese (in flour tortillas that keep better without cracking) and stored them in the fridge. They've been amazing reheated in the morning. Just 1 keeps me full until lunch easily. It's so nice having a quick and nutricious breakfast in the car on the way to work. 1 minute in the mircowave wrapped in a paper towel. Glorious! I hope this long read was worth it for at least 1 person :)

These are just like my mom used to make when we were little.Now, I use Soyrizo or other non-meat chorizo products. You do have to add about 3 teaspoons of your favorite cooking oil so it doesn't stick to the pan. My favorite oils to use are grapeseed oil or walnut oil. I am not a Vegan, just a person who prefers a less greasy chorizo with a healthy oil. Believe me, someone who has been eating and making beef chorizo for the past 55 years, you cannot taste the difference between a meat chorizo and a nonmeat chorizo because it is all about the many spices and vinegar used to make chorizo.

In the picture you can see the eggs, but if you follow the directions you won't.  I would cook the onions & peppers and then set them aside in a bowl...cook the chorizo (medium/hot heat, the mild had no flavor), then drain in mesh strainer.  Put the chorizo with the onions/peppers in the bowl.  Cook the eggs seperately and add cheese on top to melt - then layer your burrito with the chorizo on top of the eggs. I just used 1 casing of chorizo out of a 15 oz pack.  I'll save the rest for another recipe.

I love chorizo and eggs for breakfast!  I usually cook the chorizo and then set it aside in a bowl.  Cook the eggs in the same pan and add the drained chorizo back into the eggs when they are nearly done (like in an omlette).  But occassionally we cook diced potatoes and onion (found in the refrigerated section Simply Potatoes) with the chorizo and add them together to the eggs.  Also, fold the end of the tortilla like you would when rolling a burrito and the grease won't get all over the place.  The potatoes help soak up the grease too!  Yummy!!!

Great burritos! I cooked (scrambled) the eggs separately from the sausage... Also after reading other's reviews, I used paper towels below and on top of the cooked chorizo to remove as much of the fat as I could. This worked very well I thought. Oh, we all added salsa at the table. These turned out so delicious... family wants me to make them again next weekend. Thanks  for a keeper!

We made these with store-bought pork chorizo. They were so yummy! I use my electric burner on the stove on a heat of 3 to brown my tortillas. I recommend this over microwaving. You get a more authentic tortilla. I learned this from my babysitters in San Diego. :)

Easiest last minute dinner idea I've made in a loooong time. My LARGE picky family all loved this, everyone of them. Here are the changes I made. I used the whole pound of ground chorizo, chop it up with the spatula as it cooks to have smallish pieces, I then used a whole small yellow onion chopped and browned in the chorizo, I added 11 eggs with about 1/3 C milk beat in. Once I poured it in I sprinkled about 1/8 t of paprika and chili powder and then sprinkle about 1/4 t of garlic powder and 1/2 t of seasoned salt. After it is all mixed and eggs have cooked through I then topped it with cheese and popped it in the cold oven turned on to 350 degrees for about 7 or 8 min while I warm up tortillas in the pan with butter.

I used green bell pepper, seeded and diced, in place of green chile pepper. I removed the casing and cooked the chorizo, drained the grease then set it aside. I highly recommend draining the grease as it is very greasy and releases a lot of red oil from the chorizo. I cooked the red onions, 1 garlic, minced, bell peppers and eggs separately. I also fried up one russet potato, peeled and cubed. I then layered the burrito with the chorizo on top of the eggs. I topped it with some fresh cilantro. The serving amount was just right for us this morning. I liked these burritos and thou my family ate these they also thought the chorizo was a little on the spicy side. I think these would have been really tasty with some mild salsa as well.

These were awesome!  I used "soyrizo" instead of the chorizo, and I cut out the onion because my husband doesn't like it.  We added bell pepper, and paired the mix with sprouted grain tortillas - magnificent!

I have been making thewe burritos for years.  the only difference is that I do not add chilu peppers..The chorizo is spicy enough without them.  I also add diced potato.. Cook a diced potato in butter until soft, then add the chorizo...My teenage son and his friends just love them

Ive been eating this my whole life. My mom always made it for my brothers and i as kids. She sometimes would add diced potatoes..YUMMY!!! She also would sometimes serve it on white bread with mayonaise on both sides. The bread with mayo way is my favorite but tortillas (especially corn) are very good too!! Also my mom never did the onions..so i am excited to try that addition to this fond family recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I love me some breakfast burritos!  This is a great start, but I do have modifications.  I substitute light kielbasa in place of chorizo for less grease.  Cut the kielbasa into fourths and then dice it up and saute with the onion, 1 green or red pepper and minced garlic.  While mixture is sauteing, whisk 8 eggs together in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons half and half (or any kind of milk you have on hand).  Then, this is where I go crazy. I add a lot of spices to the egg mixture: paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, salt/pepper and cinnamon.  Yes, cinnamon.  It really makes the dish!  Be generous with the spices (1-2 teaspoons each) but don't use more than 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Once that's all stirred together, scramble in a pan and then combine with kielbasa mixture.  Chop up fresh cilantro, add to mixture. Heat tortillas in microwave for 30 seconds to soften them, add mixture and toppings and prepare for a taste bud explosion!  I like to add Franks hot sauce, Jack's Special salsa (usually found near produce aisle of grocery store), shredded mexican cheese and sour cream. My husband and I eat these burritos every Tuesday night along with refried beans and yellow rice.  Muy buena!

Used a fresh Anaheim and sautéed with the onion and added 3 cloves minced garlic.  Removed from pan and cooked chorizo.  Spooned out as much grease as possible then add 1/3 cup of water and cooked  till water was almost evaporated.  Spooned into bowl layered with paper towels to remove more grease.  Wiped pan and scrambled eggs and pepper/onion/garlic mix. Filled tortillas and topped with cheese and  chorizo and then drizzled with  Green Salsa from Dallas Tortilla Factory.

I use Soyrizo which is much better for you and taste practically the same as it's beef or pork counterparts.

Nice change of pace.  I used 14 oz of chorizo (2 sticks) and 15 eggs.  Next time instead of 1 can of green chiles I may try 2.  I might try around 20 eggs too.  I would suggest serving with cubed potatoes that people can add themselves to burrito and some hot sauce/sour cream as well.

This is a wonderful dish made just as receipe states. When I don't have fresh green chilis I used canned diced ones, still a very good flavor. Well Done Thanks.

This is one of my favorites, but you have to do it a certain way - don't mix the eggs and chorizo.  Cook separately.  Add cubed hasbrowns.  Use beef chorizo, not pork chorizo (but pork is OK).  You can omit the chile.  I LOVE this dish!

great taste, definitely has potential.  i would cut the chorizo in half and add more eggs.  or better yet, after cutting the chorizo in half, i might scramble the eggs separately then combine.  the eggs get lost in the chorizo.  great flavor though!

Just made one serving of this chorizo for breakfast and I must say it was super deelish!  A few things:  I didn't have red onion, so I just used chopped yellow onion, and I didn't have a chile pepper, so I left that ingredient out.  I really love the soy chorizo and whole wheat tortillas from Trader Joe's (the wheat tortillas have 7 grams of fiber!!!) and the recipe was super easy and took just a few minutes to make.  Will def be making this more often!

I made these for my son and he loved these. I used canned green chiles only because I had them and not fresh. I served these with picante sauce as well. These would be even better with some cubed potato cooked in as well and some cilantro next time too. This would probably be just as good with breakfast sausage. Thanks Barb75 for sharing this keeper!

Made this for my father's birhtday and everyone in my family loved it. I made it with different peppers, but other than that just the way the recipe said. The pork chorizo is indeed greasy, but as the family is Hispanic they eat it all the time, so that wasn't a problem.

Enjoyed this recipe. Tasted great. I didn't have the green chile pepper so used a yellow pepper.  Added some sour cream & cilantro.  Will use again.

delicious, i used a paper towel to sop up the grease, because of the other reviews, but other than that did this just like it said to and it was really good. my husband asked for hot sauce with it but i think it was a hit...

You never ever heat tortillas in a microwave.  Take the time and do it right.  Use the stove on an open flame.

I live part of the year in Mexico and find most of All Recipe Mexican food recipes....to not resemble Mexican food at all, but this is how a chorizo breakfast burritos is made! I would only use 1/2 lb Chorizo since the flavor can be strong...Jack cheese can alsobe used, although authentic breakfast burros don't usually have cheese....
Good recipe!....it's probably the vitamin C in the chile that helps your hangover ; )

Great weekend breakfast!!! As a rule of thumb for those wanting a scrambled "eggy" burrito use 8 eggs per pound of chorizo.  I prefer to use 1/2# mild and 1/2 # hot chorizo combined. Then you no longer need to cut up onion and chiles for spice. Also at the end of cooking sprinkle cheese right into pan to melt and then serve. Very authentic Mexican dish!!!

I have to say, this one surprised me. I made it as stated and it didn't look that appealing. Was I wrong! This burrito was tasty! I took it with me to a brunch potluck and everyone loved it!
I would definitely cook the eggs in the chorizo mixture. Yes, it is hard to see the egg in the final product, but otherwise you miss out on all seasoning in the chorizo. Also, corn tortillas are the way to go!

Way too much chorizo for me... maybe use 1/2 (6oz) of what is in this recipe if you want to know that there are eggs in the burrito!

I make my own version of these with slight modifications.  I use traditional breakfast sausage instead of chorizo.  I do add salsa to help punch up the flavor some.  It allows each person to better personalize their own burritos incase they don't want them too spicy.  This is definitely a keeper in our house & something that will always be on our meal plan options list (for breakfast or dinner)!

Pretty good, but I'd reduce the amount of chorizo to 8oz. Seemed more like chorizo than eggs, otherwise pretty good

Excellent recipe.  Made exactly as written, but instead of green chile, I used a tbsp. of chopped jarred jalapeño with seeds removed.  Fabulous, with a terrific little kick. We LOVE it!

Very good! I used a mild chorizo sausage, and like other reviewers I drained all the grease I possibly could before adding the eggs to the mixture. This was excellent, I squeeze a little fresh lime on top. Will make again!

over kill with the chorizo. chorizo is used like a spice, not main ingredient. 3 or 4 inches is more than enought

I used more than one jalapeño and I didn't take the seeds out.
