This recipe was delicious! It took some time, but was easy and well worth it. I followed the recipe as stated only adding a pinch more garlic salt and it smelt and tasted just like pizza. The pepperoni's are what gave it that flavor. Will definitely make again.

I followed this just like the directions said. It was yummy!!! Everyone loved it and said it tasted just like pizza because of the basil and oregano. Next time I'll add some sausage to the sauce so it has a bit more meat. Great recipe.
