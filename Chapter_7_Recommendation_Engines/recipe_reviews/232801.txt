Loved it.  I did make a change to it the second time I made it.  Instead of drizzling the oil over the tomatoes--I put the cut tomatoes in a small bowl and mixed the oil in with the tomatoes then placed them around the goat cheese and baked.  I found that the oil was more evenly distributed.

Served this over mixed baby greens with slivered onion. Then drizzled 1 T balsamic dressing over greens before topping with warm Caprese Salad.  A meal in itself!

Love this recipe! Although, I did add minced garlic and salt. Even made it once with rosemary olive oil and various colored cherry tomatoes - delish! For 8 - 10 appetizer servings I doubled recipe, baked in one dish and successfully used anywhere from 8 to 10 oz. goat cheese. - served with garlic pita chips. Using individual ramekins with crostini would make for a very elegant first course for the holidays. Thanks Chef John!

This was phenomenal!  I made the recipe using grape tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes (the grocery store didn't have the latter), so next time I might increase the ratio of tomatoes to cheese if I use grape tomatoes again.  My husband, who tends to be hit and miss when it comes to goat cheese, said twice that it was "very nice".  (That's his "speak" for "I loved this!")  I look forward to making this for company, it's so easy and presents so well.  GREAT post, one of the best recipes I've come across on this site!

**UPDATE**  I usually make this on the same day that I make basil pesto, as not many basil leaves are required for this recipe and if I don't plan to do something else with the basil, it goes to waste.  Today I inadvertently forgot to put some basil aside for this dish, so I used a dollop of my freshly made pesto in place of the basil.  I couldn't have imagined this recipe getting any better, but it did!  I think I may use pesto in place of basil from now on!  So incredibly good!

It was a hit!  I used one of the really big logs of cheese (16 oz) because I was going to a large party.  Using my small (1-1/2 C) and medium (3 C) vintage Pyrex refrigerator dishes, I put 1/3 of the log in the small one and 2/3 in the large one.  Had to bake the large one 7 minutes longer.  Served with Pita Chips and Multi-grain chips.  Lovely!

Wow, made this for a ladies group and everyone loved it.  I baked it in a small casserole and it was tremendous.  None left.  Will be making it again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and used 4oz ramekins that came with my dinnerware set. Used recipe exactly as printed  evcept for the cayenne pepper which I left out, and they were terrific! The only confusing thing was the title---it said it was a salad and the body of the instructions said it was a dip! We had a salad in addition to this. The ramekins need to be spread on a cracker to eat so being that they were warm to the touch, we found it more comfortable to sit  at the table to eat the appetizer! Next time I would use it as the salad course and eliminate appetizer!

I used green chili pepper infused olive oil as the topper instead of chili pepper and added a jarred mango cube. This recipe can be adapted 1000 ways!

Chef John does it again!  This was so easy and delicious. I used home grown tomatoes and basil and served with toasted leftover Naan I had on hand. Yum!  Any crusty bread would be good with this. Thank you Chef John!

It was good. Might be better as a dip for French bread instead of something to spoon into alone. Goat cheese to me just seems like something you want only a taste of as opposed to a mouthful.  But it was nice to try something different.

I made this appie and it was to die for delicious..I used a larger piece of goat cheese and put it in a Brie cheese container, stuffed lots of cherry tomatoes around..there was not a speck leftover. I used garlic flavoured olive oil, for sure this recipe is a winner... Don't forget to use the fresh basil.

I was going to make a caprese salad but unfortunately my fresh mozzerealla was bad :( I had a bunch of Campari tomato cut up already and picked some basil from the garden, so I searched for an alternate to caprese that would use my ingredients I had prepared already.  Like others, I mixed this all together with the olive oil and the goat cheese. It came out quite nice.

This was easy to make and delicious.  My local store was out of fresh basil so I used pesto.  I tossed the sliced tomatoes in the olive oil.  A keeper for sure.

I have made this several times and each time I serve it as suggested earlier - over organic greens with slivered Visalia onions and avocado which added a great depth of flavor.  The mixture of the balsamic drizzle over the goat cheese is sublime! Excellent!

I made it as is except that it was in a big dish for a book club meeting so I had to buy a big log of the cheese. It was AMAZING!!! I served with some crustini crackers and Balsamic wheat thins. I have to say it was the best on the wheat thins!!
