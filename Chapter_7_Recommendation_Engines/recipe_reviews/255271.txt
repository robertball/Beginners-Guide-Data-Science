Although some cooks put down processed cheese, it has it's place in the homey, gooey good category!  I can't wait to make this recipe!  Splurge, we don't use it that often.

I'm trying this on my next mac & cheese extravaganza!  Adding anything from Johnsonville has got to kick it up a notch.  And I have "nooooooo" problem with processed cheese of any kind, often using various flavors of it along with natural cheeses.  Not only for mac, but many other dishes too.  Good idea on the sausage!  Thanks.

My husband and I love this dish, but here's the deal... I use real extra sharp cheddar cheese and whole milk to make the cheese sauce.  I mean, seriously - Velveeta?  Do people really eat that stuff?  I used smoked beef sausage sauteed with onion and garlic, and whole wheat pasta.  This dish is rich and sinful, but serve it along side some lightly steamed broccoli and a green salad, and you will be forgiven.

Made this last night for dinner. I halved the recipe since my boys don't tend to eat a lot & I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I liked the flavors, but it seemed too dry to me. I may have gone too heavy with the bread crumbs on top, but it also didn't seem creamy/cheesy enough. Next time I'll either add a bit more cheese or maybe some cream or more milk to the mixture. It was tasty, tho, & I'd make it again. Thx!

So easy and a huge hit.  The first time I made this I had a little leftover, great for lunch the next day right. Wrong, it was gone. The next time my 10 year old daughter made it. The only change we used a little extra Italian sausage.

This was a total hit! I used Jonesville "hot" sausage and I doubled the recipe - my crew loves spicy and it was just enough but not too much. Served it with a crisp salad and fresh warm applesauce made from apples from the farm stand. The spicy, crisp and sweet was the perfect trio. Love this recipe. Will be a staple now! Won't be any leftovers either!

Turned out incredibly dry as made. I would try it again, but reduce the panko by a third and double the cheese sauce.

I doubled the sauce like another reviewer suggested because I like my Mac n cheese on the creamy side and it was perfect!

I wasn't sure about the spicy sausage, with my kids but they loved it.  I did change the cheese to our personal favorite blend "Mexican".  The sausage added a nice flavor to the dish.  Definitely making again.

Another excellent recipe by Johnsonville.  I've become a big fan of their product.  It is always so tasty!  I used the cheesy sausages (3 links) and saut√©ed them a bit before adding to the pasta and sauce as we like them with crispy edges and a caramelized flavor.  Yum!  Can't wait to make it again!

I usually love Johnsonville recipes but unfortunately this one was a miss for us. I will say I did use Target's Mac n Cheese Blend instead of just  American cheese (it did include american cheese). The sauce definitely needed doubled and it could use some seasoning and grown up flavors. The sausage also needs increased/doubled, for my families taste. I used regular bread crumbs  because I couldn't find gf panko like usual and reduced that mixture by half and probably could have reduced it a bit more.

I try to avoid overly processed cheese so opted for a more natural type cheese and used Kraft Big Slice American Cheese Slices. American cheese is a mild flavored cheese which is ok but when I choose to eat mac & cheese I like to taste the cheese. Next time I would consider using sharp cheddar or a mixture of cheeses for a little more flavor. Even though I prefer a baked drier version of mac & cheese which this, I would double the sauce since this soaked it right up. The sausage was a nice addition making it an easy one dish meal. My meat eater hubby would have liked the sausage doubled as well.
