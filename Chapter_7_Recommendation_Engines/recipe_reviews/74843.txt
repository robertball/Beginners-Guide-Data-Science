Put the potatoes on the bottom and throw in a couple carrots.  Add remaining ingredients including the liquid from the can of peas, but don't add the peas until the last hour of cooking or they turn to mush.  You could also cut back on the ketchup and substitute a little chili sauce instead.

My potatoes did not cook, this was a weird tasting dish that did not go over well with my family.
