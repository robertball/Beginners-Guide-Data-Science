Loved this! Very easy to put together. I added garlic to the onion and used fresh cherry tomatoes and a splash of water instead of the canned. While the sauce was simmering, I added some Italian seasoning and about a teaspoon worth of red chili flakes for a touch of kick.

Other than using Farfalle pasta instead of rigatoni and adding 1 large clove of garlic, I followed recipe. I really like all the fresh ingredients and when making this again I will not use canned tomatoes, I will substitute fresh tomatoes. I think the leftovers are going to be delicious.

I used one container of grape tomatoes rather than the can, added a couple cloves of minced garlic, one pound of heated and sliced chicken sausage, and substituted the rigatoni for whole wheat penne. Also added white wine towards the end of saut√©ing and used grated Parmesan cheese after serving. We did not want the calories of the mozzarella! This was very good and will definitely make it again as quite healthy and satisfying!

Really great recipe! Like others, I added garlic and Italian seasoning, though I dropped the mushrooms (kids don't like them). Will definitely make again!

Super easy. Like the others, I added garlic. And extra spices, including red pepper for some kick.
