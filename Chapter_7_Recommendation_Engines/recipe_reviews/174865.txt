I just made these after finding the original Nestle recipe in my recipe box...it's been there for about ten years, but I'd never made them.  THEY ARE AMAZING homemade brownies.  Had two requests for the recipe on my first debut :)  Highly recommended to anyone looking for thick, fudgy delicious brownies that are not out of a box!

This was great! At first, even though the batter may seem a bit thick for brownies, that's the way it's supposed to be. Although, I think they taste better without the pecans and caramel topping, but that may just be a personal preference.  My friends are all begging me to teach them how to make these, they loved them so much!

Wow!  I can end my brownie recipe search!  I thought the batter was too thick too, but it worked out just fine.  These are fudge, yet melt in your mouth good, and super rich.  I used oil instead of butter, peanut butter sauce instead of caramel, extra-dark cocoa, and milk chocolate chips.  You know they are done when they raise slightly and crack on the top.

I wanted to use a 13x9 pan so I doubled the recipe and it was fine. If I did it again I would decrease the caramel by 25% so the cake doesn't drip over. Every body totally loved these brownies.

This recipe is amazing and I will totally make it again. At first I was a little freaked out because the batter was really thick, and the recipe didn't make a lot so the batter didn't cover the pan quite well, but the brownies were amazing! I also thought that the brownies were powdery, almost, and I thought that was kind of weird but oh, well. I recommend not measuring out the ice cream topping and the white chocolate chips. I felt like there was not enough when I did that. All in all, these brownies were AWESOME!

I loved this recipe! Made it for firefighters after a training and they loved it! I did leave out the nuts (for allergy reasons) and I threw the brownies in the fridge for about 2 hours after they cooled so they were hard enough to cut into individual bites. They were definitely a hit and I will be making this again!

I am rating this a 5 star for the chocoholic in mind.  For myself personally, they were very sweet and rich but they are decadent.  I doubled the recipe using a 9x13 and baked a tad longer.  They are rich, fudgy, and moist.  The bottom layer batter will be very thick, as it has to hold the chips and caramel, and you don't want it to sink to the bottom.  for doubling the recipe, I only used 1 cup each of the white chips and pecans.  It was plenty.  You will want to use a good caramel, and a thick one.  I used Mrs. Richardson's which is very buttery and good.  It is also very thick.  I think if you were to use a thinner caramel, it would get lost.  The Richardson's held a nice thickness.  I used mini chips in the top portion of batter.  I intend to cut these in smaller pieces, as they are very rich.  The caramel middle looks very pretty and something different. I think this recipe could very easily stand on its own if one chose to fore go the caramel and white chips.  I also made sure that I didn't spread the caramel too close to the sides, as I didn't want it to stick to the sides of the pan.

These were OK, but not sure I'd make them again.  Too much going on in them that they lose definition--everything just tastes sweet.  No chocolaty, just sweet.  I think I'll just stick with nut in my brownies.

I was torn between 4.5 and 5 stars, and was influenced to give 5 stars based on the other reviewers scores.   I did really like these, but I had the highest hopes for the "best" tasting brownies of my life.  Don't get me wrong, they are good, just not mind-blowing.  I've had other brownies that are equally as good and use less ingredients...there's a lot going on with these and the many various ingredients.  I would make these again, but I will go back to regular brownies also.  Especially when craving a simpler brownie.

I made this with gluten free flour and skipped the nuts.  They were very good, but honestly I think they would be better with regular flour and add the nuts.  But I was making recipe changes for a friend so they could eat them.  Still delicious.

Doubled the recipe for a little bigger pan and it still turned out delish! They may be a little sweeter than expected but still really good. I couldn't contain myself from eating them! I like these because you can taste the real cocoa unlike boxed brownies. I went crazy with the chocolate chips and white morsels and still tasted yummy!
