I couldn't agree with the previous reviewer's (Bethany S.) assessment of this recipe more. She hit the nail on the head. The dessert is very rich but not much malt flavor and we found the cake to be pretty dry. I too was making this recipe for my dad's birthday because he loves malt. I don't think I will make this dessert again.

I made these for my dad's birthday (he really loves malt) and I was disappointed that they did not taste "malty" at all! I even added some malted milk powder to the chocolate part and it didn't help. I think the brownie base was too strong that it covered up the malt taste in the frosting (which by the way tasted great and "malty" by itself). Everyone in my family said the bars were very good but really rich. However they didn't even know that they were MALT bars until I told them (they thought that the frosting was made from condensed milk not malt). I think next time I will double the frosting recipe spread it over a light cake instead of the brownies and still sprinkle it with the crushed malt balls. I'll keep looking for the malt recipe that makes my dad say "Wow!"
