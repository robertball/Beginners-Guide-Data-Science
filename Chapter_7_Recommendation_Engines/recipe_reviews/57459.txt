Great recipe!!! My husband caught me putting the eggs in the oven, made a funny face and said "What Are You Doing?!!!" He wasn't very happy that I was "wasting" our eggs trying this. He LOVED them!!!! He ate most of the eggs himself. I did modify the recipe slightly buy saut√©ing some onions and garlic and tossing them in with the batter, and adding cheese when almost done. Will definitely make over and over again!

FANTASTIC way to make scrambled eggs perfect every time!  We have used this recipe countless times when cooking for a men's breakfast for 60 men.  We found some great additions to be chopped green chilies and cream cheese that we cut off the bar with a knife and stir into the egg mixture.  Love this recipe!!  THANKS ERIN!!

I made this recipe for my daughter's graduation open house.  It was very well received.  The only change I would suggest is to make smaller amounts at a time.  The 24 eggs called for in the original recipe overflowed in my pan when I tried to stir it, making a mess in my oven.  I cut the recipe in half using a slightly smaller pan and it worked great.  If you are planning a brunch and want eggs of some kind these work well.  They did not seperate or become runny from sitting for a while if kept warm.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  The eggs came out moist and fluffy and we have no left overs to show for it!  It's also great because you can add any extras you want!

**A couple tips though:

*If you down scale this recipe; use your judgement for the milk, you may need to add a little less.

*Also, if you use a smaller glass dish (ie 9x9) you will have to up your cooking time between 5-10 min.

Thanks for a great recipe! :)

These eggs were light and fluffy and EASY!  I only made half the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish.  Stirred it several times so mine came out more like scrambled eggs but fluffier than scrambled eggs cooked on the stove top.

This makes perfect scrambled eggs, soft and fluffy, but thoroughly cooked, and it is so much easier than standing over the stove making them.  I halved the recipe since it is just my husband and me (babies are too young) and added ham.  I love the versatility of this recipe.  Next time I will try adding salsa and using slightly less butter.  You could also try adding cheese or vegetables.  Enjoy!!!

These were the fluffiest, best tasting scrambled eggs I think I've ever had. They were also incredibly easy to make and a will definitely be a new staple breakfast item whenever I need to serve a crowd. I served them with warmed tortillas and an assortment of sauteed vegetables for people to make their own breakfast burritos. Everyone at my brunch commented on how delicious the eggs were.

I added smoked Gouda cheese and red onion, yum yum!
*TIP* preheat oven, then put the butter & pan in the oven to melt the butter while you mix the eggs. saves cleaning an extra dish*

I didn't care for these at all. It was probably (seeing as everyone gave these eggs such a high rating) something I did.
I think it was because I had to bake them for so long since I used a very tall dish to cook them in.
I also used water instead of milk since I've been told and have experienced for myself that water makes the eggs fluffier.

A very simple scrambled eggs recipe for a large crowd.  This dish has become my go-to brunch dish when my family comes over.  I usually add the real bacon bits that you can get in a jar and a handful of cheddar cheese if I want to make them extra special.  They come out perfect every time.  I've even scaled them down to 2 servings for my husband and me and they were still delicious.

Great!  We used 12 eggs. After 10 minutes we added shredded cheddar cheese.  They were done after 10 more minutes.  We used a 9 x 13 pan.  Easy and tasty!

This recipe is outstanding!  I've made it several times for breakfast burritos for a crowd.  After baked, I use a pastry blender to "scramble" the eggs and then put the eggs in a crock pot to keep them warm.

This is how we used to make eggs for our sorority when there were 75 or so of us eating breakfast. We used the large 10x14 disposable pans. You can customize this as you see fit. Thank you.

Rather than 2 1/2 cups of milk, use 1 1/4 cup evaporated milk and 1 1/4 plain milk and they'll be even fluffier.  Easy and delicious!

This recipe is AWESOME! I love love love it! I scaled it back a bit and used a 9x9 pan. I omitted the butter using canola oil cooking spray instead. I added lowfat cheeses, fresh chopped mushrooms, green onion chopped, fresh tomatoes, and chopped white onion, and bacon. This was better than any restaurant even. I CANNOT WAIT to make this for company. Yum Yum and SO SO simple! Thanks so much to whoever posted!!!

Okay my two cents: Definitely use a bigger pan. I used a 11x13 and it was 2/3 full. My hens lay pretty big eggs, but still! I try to cook without salt whenever possible, but everyone knows you can indulge with eggs. I used 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of Mrs. Dash Original Blend. Yum-yum! This recipe calls to the creative cook. Have fun with it - after all they're just liquid chickens! :p

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  We have used this recipe so many times now.  I actually make it in bulk, and we just eat it as the week progresses.  When we finish it, I just make more!  You can make egg sandwiches out of it, normal scrambled eggs, put it in a breakfast burrito...so easy!!  I do have to cook it a little longer than the recipe states or else it is still hasn't set up.

I make these to serve 200 people at a summer camp. I use 60 eggs to feed 40 people especially if we are also having French Toast or pancakes. The usual rule of 2 eggs per person doesn't apply with this recipe. Because of the amount of milk, 1.5 eggs per person is plenty. I use the large foil pans for easy clean up.

This is an amazing recipe. I have cooked a lot of scrambled eggs but never done them in the overn.  These would have a 10 star rating from me.  Incidentally, I am OLD, and have around 15 grandchildren (mine, his and ours) to feed on big holiday occasions. All love this recipe, including their parents! :))) And their moms use this recipe.

These were so easy and so good! I also thew a cookie sheet of bacon in when I started the oven to preheat, and by the time the eggs were done, so was the bacon! A perfect, hassle free breakfast :o)
When making the eggs I substituted buttermilk, and used Creole seasoning instead of plain salt. But I'm sure they would be just as good plain- the consistency was terrific!

Wonderful!  For less carbs, I used heavy cream in place of milk (1/2 amount + 1/2 water).  Turned out  WONDERFULLY!!!

As the cook for a daycare center, I made 80 servings (colored green!) for a Green Eggs and Ham lunch in honor of Dr. Suess' birthday. I had to use liquid egg subsitute to somply with state health regulations, but the results were easy, fluffy and tasty. It took a bit longer for the eggs to set than the recipe says, so give yourself a bit of extra time. It would be very simple to add ham, cheese or chives midway through baking.

I cut the recipe in half, and added 1 tsp Italian seasoning, buttermilk Ranch dry dressing mix, and smoked seasoned salt to the mixture, and it turned out fluffy and delicious! I let it cool, then cut the egss into 1/2-inch strips to make 20 wheat breakfast burritos for the upcoming school year's breakfasts. I put the egg strips on top of shredded cheese on a wheat tortilla, and made 2 varieties; both had pan-fried hash browns. but DD wanted Canadian bacon, and DS wanted crumbled breakfast sausage and sauteed mushrooms. This is a keeper! Thanks, Erin!

This is my go to for a brunch crowd.  The reason for 4 stars is the milk makes the eggs runny. I replace the milk with about 1 cup of light sour cream to prevent the baked product from becoming runny.  I also add finely diced ham and Velveeta chunks. The pan is always empty!!

Great Brunch Buffet style eggs, just like the fancy ones restaurants make, my family went for seconds. I halved the recipe for the 5 of us...someone rated this recipe and used water instead of milk well  tests by Cook‚Äôs Illustrated (the ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Test Kitchen‚Äù people) revealed that scrambled eggs made with water are less flavorful, do not fluff as well, and are not as soft as those made with milk. Keep the recipe as is you can't go wrong!

I was making this for 2 people so I scaled it back accordingly and they came out great!  They were a little bland though, so I think next time I'll add some pepper and maybe a little more salt.  Otherwise, they came out perfect and fluffy!

Delicious and super easy to make. Don't be afraid to decrease the butter, while super yummy I think it would have been just as good without half the butter.

I found this recipe about 20 minutes ago and decided to try it out because I'm cooking a church breakfast for 150 people.  I am SOOOOOO glad I ran across this recipe.  I didn't really follow the exact measurements but I basically just mixed up the ingredients as I normally would for scrambled eggs and then followed the oven technique.  I never knew "oven scrambled eggs" could be so good.....

Good recipe. My only criticism is that is is way too salty for my taste. I will definitely make it again, using un salted butter plus the salt called for in the recipe. I can always add more salt when it's on my plate if I want it!

I've made this in triple quantities for brunches with 50 attendees twice now.  Always turns out fine & people comment on how fluffy.  Do keep an eye on them in the oven, though, as the time can really vary by oven, pan, etc.

This recipe is great when you have other things to do besides watch eggs cook. I browned some sausage and threw it into the pan with the eggs. It turned out great and I was able to watch my 3 kids in the mean time. I also added some cheese to it right before it was done and made some texas garlic toast with it. We had it for dinner... I will use this recipe again!!! Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe is great.  I have used it for church  events and for a baby shower.  It couldn't be easier and is also almost fool proof.  One time I forgot to stir it  and it was almost set up but was still good.  If you have super large eggs, you may find the recipe is too big for a 9 x 13 pan.  It puffs up and expands as it cooks.  Perhaps put a cookie sheet under it the first time to capture and spills.

Had these on Christmas morning for brunch, with all the other items I had to make, it was great to just throw it in the oven.  I didn't use the butter, I just sprayed the casserole dish with Pam Spray.  No complaints here! :)

This was awesome! I only made four servings, down to 8 eggs as I couldn't fathom using 24 eggs, and I added green and red peppers, onions and cheese.  This will definitely be a staple in my home.  Thank You!!

I made for 3 people and the serving converter worked out fine. The only thing I did differently was to add some cheese.  Was fine as is, but next time I will try some crumbled bacon and green chili.  It was nice to be able to bake home fries and eggs in the oven at the same time.  No mess on the stove top!

Wow!  I will never go back to making scrambled the old fashioned way.  This is a good basic recipe that comes out perfect everytime.  I usually add the following: 1/4-tsp black pepper, 1/2-tsp crushed red pepper, 1-tsp dried parsley and 8oz package of Kraft Crumbles Mexican Blend Cheese. I like the crumbles instead of shredded because you get a more cheesy bite. I also sometimes add cubed ham or pork sausage.   I highly recommend it.

I'm planning a huge breakfast, 125 people! I made one pan as a test and I'm torn whether or not I should use this recipe. The eggs were beautiful, and fluffy, however the time it takes to cook is WAY off. After the ten minute prep, which was pretty accurate, the eggs cooked for 40 minutes (and still very moist) making the actual time a t total of 50 minutes:-( it doesn't take a well seasoned cook to know that you could skillet scramble 24 eggs in 10 minutes (or less). So, while I think the eggs are good, I'm not sure the actual time is reasonable.

They were edible but not light & fluffy - I can't imagine what I did wrong.  Do cut the butter down as I had to drain the butter off the top.  They did take longer to bake than directed.  Would be easier for me to cook on the stove.

These egss turned out fabulous! I had to make 2 huge pans of them for my office of 25 hungry co-workers. I whipped them up quickly the day of the breakfast before I left for work, wrapped them tightly with foil and even after an hour commute-they held their heat.They were nice and fluffy which surprised me with such a large amount. I'll be preparing them again soon and this time I plan on adding some sauteed onion, green peppers and cheese.These would be a good base to build a lovely holiday breakfast buffet around:=)

Okay I had my doubts but this recipe is great for making the most fluffy scrambled eggs.  I reduced portions down to 6 eggs worked great.  Will for sure use this next time family is staying with us.  Thanks for sharing!!!

These eggs were very fluffy, but they took about 25 minutes to cook. They ended up being very salty,maybe because I used salted butter in the recipe? Next time I'll use unsalted butter and season after cooking. It's nice not having to stand over the stove, though. Thanks for sharing.

AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL!  Soooo light & fluffy & nearly no work involved!  I made a 4-serving recipe and it was just enough for my family of 6 (to be part of a huge Breakfast For Dinner).  I threw a couple handfuls of grated cheese in after the first stirring.  DELICIOUS and SIMPLE.... takes a little longer, but less work and better eggs in the long run!

Best home-made scrambled eggs I have ever had. I added green onions, mushrooms and green peppers and it turned out moist and fluffy in exactly the same cooking time.  The aroma as they were cooking was phenomenal.  No more pan-fried scrambled eggs for me ever again!!

These were quite good, but I found the cooking time and amount of liquid / salt called for to be WAAY off. Because of this, I can only award 4 stars. The concept of this alone makes this a 5 star recipe tho.... It's a real shame I can't give this a perfect rating. :( A few tweaks can take this from good to great, IMHO. Here's what I suggest: a) use less liquid than called for. I halved this and instead of using a 9 x 13 inch baking dish, I used a a smaller (8 x 8 inch) one. This may be why my eggs took double the amount of time to cook thru and why they were slightly soupy, even when set. I ended up tilting my dish to drain the excess liquid, but I'd like to avoid that next time. b) reduce the amount of salt by HALF. and finally, c) adjust the cook time. My eggs took double (if not more) time to set up. 
Thanks for a great starting point, Erin! This was a lifesaver for my Easter brunch! :-)

Great recipe, and easy to adjust since I don't need quite this much when just cooking for my family! :) The eggs come out perfect and fluffy, and this frees me up to finish pancakes and bacon without worrying about burning anything. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We have a family of 8 and the last thing I want to do on Sunday morning is stand over a stove cooking.  These are so easy to throw in the oven, then follow up with a couple of pans of oven-fried bacon.  Hot, filling breakfast on the table in no time and clean-up is sooo much easier than dealing with grease splatters on a stove-top.

Wow!  I halved the recipe, subbed fat-free half and half for milk and cooked this in an 8x8 glass dish. My brunch guests and I were all blown away. Not only were they light and airy, they were also cooked through perfectly and not at all runny. This recipe is going into my permanent collection for when we have breakfast guests.  What is even more amazing is that when I popped the leftovers into the microwave for a minute the next morning, they were delicious all over again. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

FLUFFY! I'm terrible at making scrambled eggs! Now, I can be good at it! I was skeptical at first always being told to use water when making scrambled eggs. But, these were delicious! I did halve this and used an 8x8 dish. I can't beleive how fluffy they were. I did stir these 3 times. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe, except use half of the salt. Turned out perfect for teachers' breakfast. I scaled it to 18 servings and used 2 13x9 Pyrex dishes.I stirred it at intervals with a handmixer attachment. The recommended cooking time was about right. I was also able to do bacon in the oven on a single layer on cookie sheets at the same time. Pretty easy and it was appreciated more than the usual stale bagel group breakfast.

Good and easy, but add some shredded cheese and fresh snipped chives and you really have something.

I must agree.  I have never baked scrambled eggs.  But, turned out beautifully.  Never would have thought of it.  Also, a great basic recipie to embellish as you wish.  Very fluffy and tasty.  Fear not on this one.  We will be using regularly.

I will never scramble eggs on the stovetop again!  So easy.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 b/c of the butter/salt content.  Just not necessary.  I sprayed pan w/ canola oil and used 1/2 tsp salt.  Everyone can add salt, pepper, . . . to their individual plates.  Thanks for a great method of scrambling eggs!

We used less salt and less milk than the recipe called for (1.5 tsp salt and 2 cups milk) and these were perfect!   I will be making these again and again!

These were a complete failure!  They were NOT cooked in 25 minutes, but completly raw and liquidy!  I had to turn the heat up to 500 and then try to scramble them in the hot oven without burning myself for another 10 plus minutes!  I was then late to the function they were intended for, and within 5 minuites of coming out of the oven, there was lots of water in the bottom of the dish.  I was sure glad I wasn't being served these eggs!  I left before anyone would know that I brought them!

Made a HUGE batch (15 pans) of this for a church dinner after reading the reviews.  I didn't use butter or margarine, but just sprayed the pans with cooking spray, and I also halved the salt as suggested in some reviews.  These eggs are perfect!  Cannot believe they were so creamy and fluffy.  Delicious.  This is the way I will do them from now on for a large crowd.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were absolutely WONDERFUL - light, fluffy, and VERY tasty. Great for a crowd, but be forewarned that doubling or tripling the recipe also doubles or triples the cooking time.  AND - strangely enough, they cook from the top down! :-) My family didn't care for them as much as I did, but only because they like their scrambled eggs really firm. I think this is a keeper - especially for company!!!

Oh my goodness, I was really skeptical when I read this recipe as scrambled eggs in the oven just didn't seem right!  But... These eggs are absolutely delicious!!!  I cut the ingredients in half exactly and cooked in a 9x13 casserole with the time as written and they turned out beautifully. When I took them out to serve, they were light and really puffy... I gave them a stir to break them up so they looked more like 'scrambled' eggs.  I took another reviewers advise and melted the butter in the casserole dish on the stove top first.  I chose to saut√© finely chopped onion in the butter before adding in the egg mixture plus at the ten minute mark, I stirred in some shredded cheddar cheese.  I'm sure glad I did as it turned these delicious restaurant quality eggs from excellent to amazing!!

These eggs were not what I was expecting at all. They were really wet and mushy, and their texture was overall, hard to choke down. We had to have toast just for some different texture.

I mixed cream cheese and basil into my batch of eggs. I was a little put off by the amount of pouf in the eggs in the oven. They turned out fine. I'd reduce the milk just a bit next time to remove a little of the watery-ness.

YAY! I can FINALLY make perfect scrambled eggs! I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings and loosly followed measurments. It cooked up perfect in 25 minutes @350. Will try Pam next time so eggs don't stick to sides. All I addd was cracked black pepper and a handful of shredded cheese after plated. YUM.

These eggs were a big hit - fluffy and tasty. They did take about 5 minutes longer to bake than the recipe states. I added the cheese on half of the eggs and that turned out great. One big note: the eggs were WAY too salty! I would recommend cutting the salt in half when making this. Otherwise, great!

Great eggs.  Loved the texture. Was worth the time it took too cook. Kept thinking these better be good, and they were. Added cut up ham, omitted the salt and put some cheddar cheese on top when the eggs were almost done, turned out great.

This recipe is fantastic as is. They're perfect for brunch because they come out perfectly fluffy (more fluffy than I when I do scrambled eggs on the stove) and I can focus on finishing other dishes or welcoming guests and getting them drinks. I always add a little pepper and small cubes of cream cheese to make them extra special. 
For a breakfast/world cup party tomorrow I've also added a cup of caramelized onions and 4 links of chorizo. This recipe is infinitely adaptable.

At our Bed and Breakfast here in WV, I tried this recipe. After 10min the egg mixture hadn't even started to cook.15min added not any better.  I followed the recipe, I am not sure why it didn't work. Had to pull it out and scramble them on the stove.

Great recipe!  I cut it in half (only 2 of us) and cooked it in an 8x8 pan.  I think next time I'll use a larger pan to get a thinner result (better for sandwiches).  The first day we had these I used them for breakfast burritos (sauteed peppers, onions and mushrooms separately).  The second day we ate them I made breakfast paninis with cheese, ham and baby spinach.  Both were really great.  I think you could definitely reduce the amount of butter used if you want to, I will next time.  This is a super great, easy way to make eggs either for a crowd or to have throughout the week.

These were SENSATIONAL!   I made these as part of my Easter morning brunch this year.   I've never had such great scrambled eggs before.   Let's be honest....it's all that butter mixing with the eggs while they bake that keeps them moist and gives them that wonderful flavor.   I definitely used less milk (about 3/4 of what is prescribed) because I know I don't like my eggs that diluted.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.   In a glass pan however, I found it took about twice as long to cook.   LOVE THIS RECIPE and the oven option  when you have 3 or 4 other things on the stove top  to keep you hopping.  I might try halving the butter next time to ease the guilt and see if they still come out as good.

I will NEVER fix scrambled eggs on the stovetop again!  I cut the recipe in half for the four of us, but we had some left over. I'm going to try reheating them for breakfast in the morning. These were delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. Although next time, I would cut the amount of butter in half...or more. There was so much butter that parts of the top had a layer of it. Other than that it was really good and fluffy!

We used this recipe for our school's lunch and served it with oat cakes, sausage, bacon, and homemade maple syrup that is produced by the school.  I personally made 7 pans to feed about 90 people.  It was easy and delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Easy to add meat/veggies/cheese as you like.

Too much butter and not enough salt. I had to pour the melted butter from the top of the eggs after cooking. I will make this again for the convenience, but use half or a quarter of the butter and a full tspn of salt.

Well, I make it in a smaller batch when i just wanna make eggs for the family. I use garlic and onion powder, some shredded cheese and milk into the scrampled eggs, bake until I feel they're done (With 5 its usually about 15 minutes at 350) then add some more cheese and melt on the top. Its a total hit.

WOW - why didn't I find this sooner?? Our house is often used as the gathering place for friends and family, so it happens fairly often that I have a houseful of guests to feed breakfast to. I am able to make 2 pans at one time to serve the masses. All of the ingredients are too much for one 9X13 pan, but I just used a slightly larger pan and didn't have any problems with overflowing. It is perfect as it is. No need to make any changes or substitutions. Thank you so much for posting this. It gives me a fresh breakfast to feed friends and family and gives me more time to spend with them instead of standing over a stove all morning.

Light, fluffy, easy!!!  I love this recipe.  Eggs are so versatile.  I put the butter in  my backing dish  and put it in the oven while the oven preheated.  This probably helped with  the cooking time being correct - and I only had one bowl and one baking dish to clean!   I set it out in the morning for our house full of company with hot sauce, salsa, shredded cheese, salt and pepper on the side.  They were gobbled up!  Not having to stand over the stove and being able to sit with my company was an added bonus!  Thank you for the great recipe!

I'm so grateful to have found this recipe. It's made a huge difference in the mornings when we have a crowd of family in the house. I don't use nearly as much butter, sometimes add some sauteed vegetables or cheese at the end of the baking time, and sometimes I use buttermilk or some other milk-like substance for a little variety. I also adjust the number of eggs according to the mouths I'm feeding. It's perfect to get the eggs going while I bake the bacon - easy, delicious, and quick clean-up. Watch carefully, though, as the eggs go from nice and fluffy to dried out in no time, and if you use less butter you'll probably have to soak the dish.

So this is one of those recipes where you feel real dumb afterwards, wondering why you haven't been making scrambled eggs like this for years!  These eggs turn out perfect, something that I don't say too often.  You can make eggs this good on the stove top, but they require constant attention and the results are a little more inconsistent.  These and some buttered toast is all you need for a great breakfast.

These were very good!  I used 12 eggs and adjusted the recipe accordingly.  I had to bake them for about 40 minutes total in my glass 9x13 pan, and I stirred them four times throughout.  I also added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese about 15 minutes into baking.  I used skim milk in my batch, and also added garlic powder.  Just before eating, I sprinkled my dish with a little more shredded cheese and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I will make these again.

Made a third of a batch for 4 people along with some other items, and it was plenty.  They were definitely light and fluffy as others said.  I baked it in the toaster oven as described, and it worked great.

These are fine and good for when I am making various other things since I can just leave them.  However, mine NEVER cook in the stated 25 minutes.  It's always closer to 40, even with a higher oven temp. Also, I have to stir them a few times throughout cooking to avoid sticking and burning. I've not had any complaints about them though so I'll keep doing it this way.  I like to prepare a few days ahead (along with pancakes) so my kids have a heat and go breakfast.

Served a swim team of high school boys and kept the top of the stove open. Bakes up light like a souffl√©. Used a hand blender. Skim milk worked. Used half a stick of butter instead of whole. Will use this recipe to make up a freezer full of hand-held breakfast burritos. Just what I was looking for.

This recipe took me by surprise in the nicest way! I tried a small batch changing the servings to four. All of us were pleasantly surprised at how fluffy they turned out! I did stir/chop them up a bit near the end when they were still just a tad moist/runny, sprinkled some grated cheddar over the top, covered with foil and kept in the warming drawer for 20 minutes (or 200 degree oven). Perfect! Doing the Bacon for a Crowd recipe in the oven along with this will make breakfast for a group so incredibly easy and good!! Thank you!!

Great if you don't mind the extra wait. We like scrambled eggs right off the stovetop but they definitely seem much fluffier coming out of the oven. Sprinkle some cheese on top right after taking them out and you're set!

I was a little skeptical about making scrambled eggs in the oven but Oh My am I ever glad I did!These were the fluffiest and most delicious scrambled eggs I have ever eaten!  I used half and half instead of milk (only because I had some in the fridge that I needed to use up) and added some chopped ham after the first 10 minutes.  Sprinkled with cheese before serving - fantastic!

I was skeptical about baking scrambled eggs in the oven, but these are by far the yummiest eggs I've ever made! I baked a half quantity, and as another user had suggested, I added browned onions and garlic to the mixture. So good and very light and fluffy!

Great and such an easy dish to make to serve a crowd at breakfast. I used a non-stick pan so I think I'll cut back on the amount of butter next time.

Awesome, easy recipe.  Word of caution....when it calls for 24 eggs, I assume this is the small eggs.  I used jumbo eggs and this made a huge difference in the baking time.  But it is pretty easy to tell when they are done.

Yum!  These were delicious and easy.  I used some garlic salt instad of normal salt to give them more flavor.  Mine stuck to the pan a little, so next time I will grease the pan better.

Perfect!!!  Tried this recipe this weekend for Sunday brunch while my Mom and Dad were up visiting.  Turned out so well - and couldn't have been easier. I halved the recipe - 11 eggs (all I had) and 1 cup of milk. I also added in sauteed onions and crumbled bacon at the halfway point and then stirred in some cheese during the last minute. They were awesome!! So fluffy with tons of flavor. This will be a staple for when we have company.

I cut this recipe in half and can't imagine it fitting in a 9x13 pan with the whole amount.  I used a slightly smaller pan, but next time I will use the 9x13 with the recipe cut in half.  I found it called for too much butter, milk and salt.  A little less all around and I think this will turn out great.

by far he fluffiest, easiest, scrambled eggs I have ever made...good too. I cut the reciepe in 4 and added cheese, cooked for closer to 1/2 hour, but could of been because it was sharing the oven. I would do it again.

LOVED this simple recipe. I only have to cook for myself, so I cut the recipe down to 6 eggs, and it left me with enough leftovers to have tomorrow morning on an onion bagel then :). 

I mixed the butter in with the eggs & milk though, but sprayed the baking bowl I used with Pam Organic ... the eggs didn't stick at all & slide out nice & smoothly. Very handy recipe though if you're cooking for a large number of people; or want leftovers for the next morning to save cook time.

Tried this today, cut it down to 2 people, was very easy and extremly lite.  Only had cream cheese and added onion and garlic powder for just the first time, did not want to take away fron the recipe.  Was very good, gonna make this for the crowd when we go camping, will be easy to do.  Oh yea, omitted the butter and used Pam a little heavy since lots of people said how much  oil/butter was sitting in the bottom.

It's just me and the dog, so I cut this recipe in half, cooked it in a 8x8 pan and added 1 c of shredded cheese.  It was very good!

These eggs could not be easier! I only had canned milk in the house, so I add a couple of tablespoons since I was only making about 2 servings. A dash of pepper and an couple shakes of garlic salt. Unsalted butter and a hot oven= a perfect batch of eggs! Thanks so much Erin. My DS thanks you too.

Fantastic!! Scaled it to serve 4.  No problems, just a few adjustments time wise.  Made them in a non stick pan in the oven. Added peppers,onions, chives...the usual players.  Delish! Thanks for the recipe.

These were so easy to make and they had great texture!  I loved that I could cut them into squares to put onto bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and we didn't have to worry about chunks of eggs falling out.  I did have to bake them about 5-7 minutes longer but I was using my toaster oven and I'm not sure how accurate the temperature is in there.  I think I will be making my scrambled eggs like this all the time now.

Absolutely delicious and extremely easy.  Made for ten people and everyone loved it!  Good grinding of black pepper before baking is essential.

Excellent and sooo easy! I have a habit of screwing up scrambled eggs (too dry, not fluffy enough, etc) but these are a no-brainer! Just add whatever seasonings or spices you normally like in your eggs (we like garlic powder and hot sauce) and stick in the oven. Even if you scale the recipe down for 2 people you can't mess this up!

This recipe is a life saver.  I use it for my husband's men's group meeting - 12 hungry men -and it turns out perfect every time.  I usually split the recipe between two 9x13 pyrex casseroles (I add cheese to one and leave the other without).  The eggs go in the oven and I'm free to do other prep work without standing over a skillet.  My husband likes these eggs so much that I had to cut the recipe down for 2 people.  He doesn't want to eat his eggs any other way now.

Not as good as I was hoping. It took longer than stated to cook and was way to wet. It had way to much butter. I will stick to the frying pan. Thanks anyway.

1/4 c butter would have been enough.  The texture is much lighter and more "airy" than normal scramble eggs.  Use less milk for a firmer scrambled egg.

These eggs are wonderful, light and tender.  I made the recipe as written.  The end result is beautifully set, flavorful eggs.  I served these as part of our Easter brunch buffet, offering salsa and grated cheddar cheese to top.  None of us had done eggs in the oven, so we weren't fully expecting the yummy results.  So simple, so delicious.

Excellent recipe!  I scaled it down to 3 servings for myself and 2 kids, added handsfulls of cheddar cheese and a bunch of diced ham leftover from the ham I baked last night, tossed in a little garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  This turned into a ham & cheese omlet in one dish!  Kids ate so much they weren't hungry for lunch and my 3 yr old is usually VERY picky!  Thanks for the recipe, it's going in my recipe book for sure!

Very light & yummy flavor. After the 10 minute point, I added cheese. Very good, however, it was still very liquidy after 20-25 minutes, so I had to bake it about 7 minutes longer. Contrary to the "Serve Immediately", I refrigerated it overnight, and microwaved it in the morning. Still very good.

This is an easy way to do this while you cook other things.
We added in mushrooms and onions.  My picky child who usually loves scrambled eggs would not eat it tho. All the rest of us loved it. * would be even better with cheese

Who'd of thought anyone could get excited about scrambled eggs!  This is a perfect way to make a lot of eggs without just standing over a pan!  I scaled the serving to 7 and still used a large 9x13 dish, glad I did because it would have spilled over.  I stirred it one extra time, but that's the only thing different.  Delicious, light and fluffy and lot's of time to work on other foods!  Thanks!

I'm rating this based on method alone.  I used my own scrambled egg recipe (2T OF SOUR CREAM FOR EVERY TWO EGGS AND 1/4 TSP. CORNSTARCH FOR EACH EGG) but I still added the butter.  My eggs took about 1/2 hour and I stirred them about every 10 minutes.

These are perfect as is but as others have said on here it can be a base for so many other options.  I made them to make frozen breakfast burritos but I will make these in various way again and again.  It is a lot of butter but that is why they are so yummy!  I do think you could do about half and still be happy though.  Thank you for posting!

Very easy and good.  I halved the recipe and it was plenty.  Added bacon bits and cheese plus a garlic and onion powder.  Next time should add green chilies or bell peppers/onions....

I have made this recipe four times now for a dinner group that likes Breakfast for Dinner. Everyone loves these eggs! I follow the recipe exactly, but it does take about ten minutes longer than the recipe states. My kids are so excited when they hear I'm making oven eggs - they like them way better than regular scrambled eggs now!

Absolutely perfect! Light, fluffy, delicious eggs! I didn't change a thing! I went straight for the non-complicated original recipe this time, but intend to play around a bit with other additives in the future. This recipe is perfect the way it is, but has tons of potential for customization!

Really good and still good warmed up the next day. I used a nonstick roasting pan, and I am glad a had the extra space to stir the eggs.  I also used a cup of cheddar. Next time I will try 1/4 cup butter.

Super easy!  Pulled out of oven when I knew it was close to being done...finished cooking with one last stir before serving.

Took to a brunch. Traveled well and arrived warm and moist. I cut the recipe in half and used a pyrex 8 x 12 pan. I have a Bosch dual-fuel oven, which automatically reduces the temperature by 25 degrees. I made the mistake of starting with the convection setting. After 10 minutes, they were still liquid and not ready to stir. Switched my oven to regular bake setting and upped the temperature to 350 and they were ready to stir in 10 minutes. Did take longer for them to bake. Tried stirring with a meat fork, but switched to a mixing spoon, since the edges bake first and a spoon fit the side curve best. Will make again, with some of the suggested additions.

Like some others, I struggled with this one. I scaled it down to just 4 servings and had it in the oven for over an hour but the eggs still didn't set. I finally got frustrated and finished it in a skillet. When I tried them, I thought I felt my heart stop. There is FAR too much butter proportionally in this recipe for me. Like, I felt like I was eating straight butter. I'm not saying this is a bad recipe, but it's not for me, and there's some trick that not everyone can figure out that's keeping eggs from setting for many of us.

This idea freaked me out a little, so what better time to test it than on a birthday brunch for my Mother with the whole family attending(sarcasm).  I cut the recipe in half and used a smaller pan as I was cooking other things for breakfast as well and it worked great!  I sauteed peppers and shiitake mushrooms with garlic and butter first and added them with cilantro and cheese to the eggs before I cooked them.  You could really add anything to this recipe depending upon your taste preferences and I suggest doing so; sausage, jalapenos, green chilis, bacon, etc.  Who wants to eat scrambled eggs with nothing in them?  No one. Fantastic idea that is pretty fool proof!

This is so much better than standing over the stove to scramble eggs.  They turn out nice and fluffy, and it's easy to tailor the amount of eggs and milk for your needs.  I usually make 8 eggs with slightly over 1/2 cup of milk for the 4 people in my family, and bake in a small casserole dish.

I have made my eggs this way, and have had very good results.  The convenience alone, is worth it.  I agree with LDSMOM01, when you have a crowd to feed, it's much easier.  Thank you Erin for sharing.

This was great. I split the recipe and actually used unsweetened trader joe coconut milk since I did not have any regular milk on hand but everyone loved then. Took about 50 minutes baked in 9x13 dish added shredded mild cheddar cheese about 15 minutes before I took it out.

These came out fluffy and perfectly done. Very easy, and practically foolproof; the only thing missing is a pinch of salt. I would, however, recommend spraying the sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray, because the eggs will stick to the sides of the pan. If trying to cut calories, the butter can be omitted, but this makes the nonstick spray all the more important. I cut the amount of ingredients in half and used an 8"x8" glass Pyrex dish. Everything fit fine, but because of the deeper depth, I ended up cooking it an additional fifteen minutes (specifically, after step three: stir + cook ten minutes + stir + cook five minutes + remove from oven). By doing this, the eggs were scrambled hard with no browning and no leftover runniness (the way I like -- others may want to pull them out instead of giving them the extra five minutes).

Turned out awesome! Fed 24 people all by doubling the recipe. Used the heavy whipping cream instead of the milk. It took about 45 minutes in the oven for 24 servings. Added 1 pound velveeta cheese cubed the last 10 minutes. I also stirred every 10 minutes in the oven. You can probably use the milk instead as the recipe calls for.

Very good eggs. Cooked as expected. I would decrease the amount of milk in the mixture as the eggs came out a little too fluffy. -1 star for me on that point. -1 for cook time as well. I could do this on the skillet faster by about 10 minutes. 

5 stars if you like 'em extra fluffy and too busy to actually pan cook the eggs.

Followed recipe exactly. The eggs are  wonderfully light.  Warmed up some little smokies and cinnamon rolls for a very easy, no mess breakfast.  Leftovers will make ummy egg sandwiches or breakfast burritos.

Wonderful! The dish was beautiful, light, and delicious. I never could get milk to make eggs 'light' before, but these were the epitome of fluffiness. They might even be too fluffy for *some* heartier applications (such as Tex-Mex styled eggs, etc.).  HOWEVER, THESE ARE PERFECTLY FLUFFY FOR FANCIER TOPPINGS such as goat cheese, cream cheese, asparagus, thinly ribboned spinach, etc. -- Yes, the butter and salt are not to my taste - and perhaps quite unhealthy.  However, that's an easy adjustment anyone should be ready to make with any recipe.  NOTES TO SELF: depending on toppings, cut butter to 1/4, use oil instead, or eliminate altogether and use spray oil and possibly cream cheese instead of the butter; cut salt by half for now; try 1/4 t cornstarch per egg sometime when everything else is settled at a 'constant'; add some sort of pepper depending on the toppings for the day (white, black, red, cayenne, jalapeno, green chilies, etc.); try 1/4 t garlic powder for now - depending on toppings; use anywhere from a 5th of the milk to all of the milk, depending on how fluffy you want these: or use sour cream, buttermilk, half-n-half (fat free would be fine too), or evap milk); try FF cheeses, pesto, sour cream, parm, ricotta, swiss, not just cheddar..; don't forget kielbasa or Italian styled chicken sausage; fresh or dried herbs to compliment other toppings such as basil with pesto, oregano with Italian ssg, etc. -- Can keep warm in slow cooker! Make extra for panini, burritos....

These oven-baked eggs turned out perfect! I made two pans for an Easter brunch, one 9x13 as directed and the second was a half recipe baked in an 8x8 pan with shredded cheese on top. I was a little worried because they had to sit about 15 mins before serving while the biscuits baked (the recipe says serve immediately), I just covered the pans with foil and they tasted great and the consistency was perfect. Will definitely make again!

This recipes calls for a ridiculous amount of butter and salt.  I used about 1/3 cup of butter and 2 teaspoons of salt and it was still too much.  Next time I would use about 2 Tablespoons of butter and only 1 teaspoon of salt.  This recipe states it should be cooked in 25 minutes.  Mine was nowhere near done in 25 minutes.  My total cook time was 40 minutes.  Next time I would bake for 20 minutes, then stir, then bake for another 20 minutes.

Hands down ladies and gents, the only way to make
Scrambled eggs. Put the skillet away. The eggs are super fluffy. I would however cut back a tad on the butter. This can be adjusted to any serving size.
Thank you for sharing

Tried this for the first time today... I never write reviews... I cook at a large group home and this turned out beautiful... When the eggs were almost set I added shredded cheddar cheese and shredded ham... I would give 10 stars if I could... Thanks...

Excellent!  Light and fluffy and oh so very easy.  I put the eggs in my stand mixer with the salt (reduced to 1 tsp) and freshly ground black pepper (a few turns of the pepper mill) and beat until combined.  Then added milk and beat until frothy and completely combined.  A keeper!!  You can also add cheese or whatever else you like before putting in the over.

Hands down, the best, easiest scrambled eggs I've ever made!!! So simple, and easy to make a skillet big enough to feed our whole large family in one go! Will never go back to frypan scrambling, thankyou.

This is an excellent recipe, especially when you need to make a lot of eggs. I use this for my church's men's breakfast. It couldn't be easier and much better than using a pan. Sometimes I put in onion but they taste great plain!

I re calculated the recipe for two of us.  I often make them on Sunday Morning while getting ready for church.  My husband and I love them!  
Sometimes I add pepper and onion, and or sprinkle cheese on top.

I modified the recipe to feed 4 but used all the same ingredients. It is an easy receipe to feed a crowd but it is a little blander than scrambling them in a pan.  I think next time, I'll use a little less milk and maybe try 1 tsp of dash as someone suggested as I felt it needed a little something.

Good starter recipe. Some liked it/some didn't. They said it needed more flavor. Will add sausage, sauteed shrooms, onions, red pepper and more cheese next time. Can change it up in whatever your tastes desire. I love using the oven and being able to "do" something else while it cooks. The cook time needs to be adjusted. After baking what the recipe called for, we increased the temp to 400* for approx. 15-20 more minutes.

Made this recipe this morning and will never go back to the old method again!  It was by far the best scrambled eggs ever.  I added cheese and chopped ham.  Will add more options next time.  Perfect for large crowds.

Oh. Em. Gee.  I fell in love with this recipe the first try! Hubby loved it too.  Added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar.  It came out of the oven like a souffle!  Next time will try adding ham, mushrooms, onions and bell pepper or green chiles to make it more like a strata, because that's what it reminds me of.  YUM!!  Will NEVER cook scrambled eggs in a skillet again!

Family loved it! The thing about scrambled eggs is that they're hard to keep hot. Not these! They stay hot, even when everyone was ready for seconds.

I just made these for dinner for myself, daughter and her friend.  I added cheese and put them in the oven.  I have to make eggs for 100 people on Saturday so this batch was experimental and they were delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am so excited about this easy recipe.  I know everyone will love them on Saturday.  Thank you!

These eggs were easy and very tasty.  Great consistency.  The burrito idea worked well, and they are still good leftover the next day.  I'll make these again.

My boyfriend just made this for the two of us, and it came out fantastically!  We cut the recipe down to 6 eggs (and reduced the other ingredients proportionately).  He baked it in a loaf pan, and it took ~25 minutes, stirring twice. Fluffy and delicious with just the right amount of butter and salt!  Served with pepper and ketchup :)

This was alright.  A good idea for making lots of scrambled eggs at one time, but there was too much salt and too much butter.  I'd cut those way down if I make it again.

I made these eggs to serve our adult Sunday School class. I used 42 eggs with 4 cups of milk and still only used 1 stick of butter.  I cooked ground sausage and mixed it in at the end and served with grits.  Everyone loved them, and we had no leftovers.

This recipe is phenomenal!  Best eggs anyone in my family has ever tasted!  I promise you won't be disappointed!  AMAZING! Update:  I've been making this for awhile now and thought I'd add that I cook mine in a 9X9 glass baking dish.  I do only scale it down to four servings though.  These really are delicious!  For an awesome casserole to go with this for breakfast, try scalloped potatoes n' franks from this site, except sub the franks for Eckrich skinless smoked sausage.  It's so so so good!  Best breakfast around!  The potato casserole is even better the next day, so it can be a make ahead breakfast to cut down on time!  =)

just be sure and check your eggs periodically. the first time, i halved the eggs and used an 8x8 dish, and it took longer than suggested. the second time, also halved ther recipe, and used a 1.5 quart corningware -- that worked a lot better. either way, this is a wonderful way to make a lot of eggs!

After reading all the rave reviews I decided to try these as we were having out of town guests for breakfast. Wow these turned out fantastic. Very light and fluffy and kept their staying power as some guests arrived an hour late. But they were still great. Added  onion and some drained canned mushrooms and a couple of handfuls of cheese. The mushrooms floated to the top. So next time I'll wait until 1/2 way through then stir them then put in any add ins. Also they took 30 minutes at 350 degrees. My oven just may be off though. Everyone loved them and they were fast and easy and a great consistency and it made ALOT. Will definitey be making these again.

I cracked 60 eggs, and fed the Waterpolo team this morning using this recipe.  Overwhelmingly rave reviews!  Light, fluffy, delicious.  I only added mild shredded cheddar to the recipe.  Very easy.  A keeper recipe.

Have used this recipe weekly for Church breakfast and is everybody's favorite. We cook for 30 people and this is a big time saver, the eggs are fluffy and buttery. I can't imagine going back to a frying pan for scrambled eggs.

I was looking for an easy way to free up some space on top of the stove while cooking breakfast, and this was it!  The eggs turned out super fluffy, I just broke them up a bit with a spatula before serving to give the "fried" look.  My only suggestion would be maybe to half the amount of butter, and spray the pan really well with PAM first.  The edges of the pan would not come clean after putting through the dishwasher a couple times.  Had to scrub with an SOS pad!  Will definitely make again!

Super easy if you're having a bunch of people over for brunch!  The eggs came out nice and fluffy.  But keep in mind if you have something else in the oven at the same time, you will need to cook these for a longer time - at least 15 minutes longer.

Excellent, excellent!  I omit the butter and just spray the pan with cooking spray.  Everyone loves them, especially DS who prefers his scrambled eggs cooked this way.

Everyone that ate these on Christmas morning were astounded that they came from an oven! The only thing I did different was to use olive oil on the sides of the pan instead of using butter to make it healthier. Truely a great find! Healthy, and moist.

I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast. It was easy, fast and all my guests thought they were great. Next time I will cut down the amount of melted butter used for the pans. I made 12 servings and split it between a 9x13 glass baking dish and a 9x9 glass baking dish.  Great recipe!

This recipe was very easy to make and better yet very good. I did add chopped onions and green peppers that I sauteed first and then added to the egg mixture. I also made breakfast burritos with some soft burritos that I had on hand. I served the eggs with Easy Spicy Roasted Potatoes, a recipe that I got from this site and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. Thanks!!

I have to make breakfast for our church group soon and everyone there likes scrambled eggs. I hoped to find an easier way to make a large quantity without using the stovetop & worrying about them drying out.  This was VERY easy, and produced moist fluffy eggs with barely any effort or babysitting.  Definitely a keeper---not just for crowds!

These eggs were the BEST scrambled eggs that I have ever had. My whole family gobbled them up. The recipe can easily be fixed to suit smaller or larger families. I will NEVER make scrambled eggs on the stovetop again! Thank you so much!

I think I'm terrible at making eggs, but i followed this recipe, for 1, and used Vanilla Soy Milk instead of regular milk, i also used a smaller pyrex bowl instead of the pan.  It came out delicious, the best scrambled eggs i've ever had!!

Excellent--I was never before able to make scrambled eggs quite right, but this recipe made it so easy, and it was nice not to have to constantly stir it!  I made it with only 6 eggs, and lessened the other ingredients in proportion, and I also added black pepper, green onions, and sharp cheddar and it was delicious!

Good way to prepare eggs for a brunch or large crowd of people and you don't want to stand over the stove forever and ever. This will be perfect the next time we have overnight guests. May experiment with added green chiles, mushrooms, peppers cheese etc.

I wondered if there was a way to do scrambled eggs in the oven to avoid the hassle and mess than can come with preparing scrambled eggs in a skillet (sticking - ugh!). After a quick search, I found this recipe. This method worked great. I used a 9x13 rectangular glass dish and the only changes I made were to add black pepper & onion powder, and to use less milk. I only used about 1/2-3/4 of a cup because I thought 2.5 cups was unnecessary, and the recipe still came out fine with less milk. I stirred once with a spatula after 10 min, then again after 10 more minutes, and then once it was completely set I just ran my spatula through to 'scramble' it all. They're perfect to pop into a breakfast burrito, have it on toast, or just as a side, and yes this recipe is an ingenious way to easily make scrambled eggs for a crowd. As there are only two of us, we reserved some to eat now and then froze the rest.

I made this this morning as part of a breakfast taco bar. Served 40 people and they loved it. I followed the recipe for 50 people and used shallow restaurant pants two of them. It took nearly an hour to cook,Stirring every 15 minutes. This is an excellent recipe if you are cooking for a crowd. I have a time served over 100 people utilizing this recipe. The oven method is so much better than frying.

I made these for a brunch,  I have a convection oven. I would recommend  tenting with foil and stir frequently. The first time I made these followed exactly. They started to brown bake at the 10 minute mark didn't care for that.  second time around  tented with foil and stirred frequently. They came out moist fluffy.

These eggs were so easy to make! They turned out so fluffy. I had 11 people and there were plenty eggs, we actually had some left over. My husband heated the leftovers the next morning and they were still moist.  There's nothing fancy about these eggs but they are a great way to make eggs for a large group.

Perfect scrambled eggs! The only thing I wish I would have known is that you should not panic if after the first 10 minutes your eggs are not set at all. Mine were still liquid then. After  the next 15 minutes they were pretty close. Mine needed just a little extra time, but they came out perfect. Really, the fluffiest scrambled eggs I have ever had - and I have had A LOT of scrambled eggs!

I thought it was perfect. I scaled mine down to 4 servings which ended up using 2 T butter, 8 eggs, 3/4c milk 3/4 tsp salt  in an 8x8 dish. Baked 10 minutes and stirred and then put it for 15 more minutes and they were wonderful!!!! The boyfriend was highly impressed and couldn't wait to share the recipe with his mom. Will be making scrambled eggs this way from now on!!!!

I‚Äôve been making this at least monthly, but scaled down to 12 eggs; I add 1/2 tsp of pepper, use 1/2 stick of butter, and 1 cup milk. I also add diced Black Forest ham and shredded cheddar. My roomie has a trach tube so he has to be careful what he eats, and this will last him 7-10 days!

I made these for bible study and everyone loved them! I added crumbled breakfast sausage and stirred half way thru baking, afterwards I stirred in shredded cheddar cheese and they were awesome! The only thing I did different was I used a hand mixer to "whip" the eggs and it made them super fluffy and they took a little longer to cook but we're fabulous! If you are doing add ins like sausage or veggies be sure to stir half way thru baking so they don't all settle to the bottom.

This was awesome! Before I go further though, a shout out to the person who gave this one star because they used WATER instead of the milk or cream. SeriouslY? A SMALL amount (like a teaspoon or two) can be added to eggs in certain circumstances (omelets primarily) to keep them from getting tough. However this is NOT that type of recipe.  What a cook she must be.  I have a picture in my head of her adding 2 1/2 cups of water to these, and the looks on the faces of the poor souls who tried to eat them for breakfast...yummy!

In any case..on with the review. I only went with a dozen eggs and the 9x13 was still quite full, 2 dozen must really fill it up.  Had these for breakfast on Sunday and used the leftovers through the week for a quick breakfast. 

A little tip if you want to portion these out for leftovers. Taco Bell has a new Mini-Skillet  breakfast bowl that comes with eggs and potatoes and fresh pico de gallo on top for  a dollar.  Anyway this isn't about 'The Bell'...I do like the item (its a steal for a dollar), but I LOVE the LITTLE PLASTIC BOWLS with lid that it is served in. I wash and reuse mine. Perfect size for a serving of eggs in the morning if you make them in advance and throw them in the fridge. 

Sorry if that sounds weird but I like a quick egg in the morning and the right size re-usable container is hard to find.

Fantastic recipe!!!!  They are so very easy to make and oh so fluffy and moist.  I will never cook them on the stove top again.  My husband loves them too especially when I add the Jimmy Dean cooked sausage crumble,  the Hormel bacon crumble  and the Smithfield Anytime diced ham.   He melts cheese on his serving while the eggs are still hot (no cheese for me).  I spray the pan with PAM in lieu of melted butter.  I cut the recipe in half for just the 2 of us and still have enough left for another day.  This is something I will do forever.  You will love it too!

Perfect recipe. I've made it several times, following the recipe as shown. I may be a scrambled egg addict now.  Tried it once with water instead of milk (because I was too lazy to go to the grocery store) and while the eggs were tasty, the consistency just wasn't as good. I've also figured out that stirring at the 10-minute mark is key. If I get distracted and wait until 15 minutes in, I miss out on some of that fabulous fluffiness.

AMAZING!!!  My kids say these are the best eggs they have ever eaten, and I have some very picky eaters.  Note: I have made these 3 times and each time I have to add 10 minutes to the bake time.  I originally found this recipe for a church breakfast for 50 people, but I think this is the only way I will make scrambled eggs from now on.  Also, the "serve immediately" is just a suggestion.  They taste great even after sitting out for awhile.

Great recipe.  Made it as written but  after 10 minutes I stirred in cheddar cheese, saut√©ed mushrooms and baby spinach.  I used a  11 x 15 baking dish to accommodate the additions.  It took 25 minutes to set the eggs.  This dish was light, fluffy and custard like.  Will make it again and again.

I have been making these eggs for 8 years now.  I am the cook for a very large marching band that travels and competes.  We stay in schools, sleep on gym floors and cook in the school kitchen.  This recipe has served me well for feeding 250 plus or my family for Easter or Christmas Brunch!!  Hands down the fluffiest scrambled eggs ever....fast and painless!!

These were fantastic!  I used water instead of milk in the cooking time was just right.  I especially love that it freed me up to do other things!

These were great and so easy! Best scrambled eggs I've ever made. I did halve the recipe and cooked in a smaller square glass pan. After 12 min. I stirred and added 6 slices velveeta and cooked addt'l 15 minutes. Perfect! A must try!

This is a good and easy way to make scrambled eggs for lots of people. The only change I need to make is to adjust the cooking time. It takes at least 35 minutes in the oven.

recipe is divine! I do whisk mixture one time through the second baking, and bake about 20 minutes on that second baking, to insure eggs are done.

I made these scrambled eggs for Christmas breakfast and they were a hit.  I added green and red bell peppers and onion.  Very light, moist, and fluffy eggs.  So delicious and so easy to make.  No leftovers!

This is one of those recipes that becomes a tool in the arsenal of the good cook, which is whipped out when need arises.  It's hard to make eggs for a large crowd, but these are so good, I wouldn't even limit them to just that application.  I made it for the first time with a little skepticism to feed a crowd of 50, but I'm thinking of how I can use it for normal Monday morning cooking.  It's so good!  I made three batches with 24 eggs each, adding the completed batches to large slow cooker set on warm.  Variations:  I stuck to the original the first time through, except I used rendered bacon fat in place of about ¬º of the butter.  The second and third times, I used a little more bacon fat and added pepper and cheese (grated cheddar).  I think if I weren't making it for a large group of kids, I'd try peppers and onions as well.

These are seriously good, and so easy. I scaled this down to 3 servings, and made it in glass loaf pan. Followed the recipe exactly. The grand kids ate them up. Will definitely fix them this way again.

I made these today for my family (4) plus three extra teenage boys and it was great. Really light and fluffy and easy to make. I appreciated being able to throw it in the oven and not have to babysit it on the stove so I could other things (pancakes and bacon). I did add shredded cheddar cheese and shredded mozzarella to the mix. The ONLY thing I will do differently next time is cut down on the butter. It was way too much. Keep in mind you will need more time in the oven then stated. Also, I used a foil pan so I could just toss it and not have to clean. GREAT.

I made this last night for a church group of  ~40 junior and high schoolers. I made  two batches (plain and with cheese) using "institutional-sized" stainless steel baking dishes, which are deeper, like lasagna pans. Baking time was a little longer (about 40 minutes) because of two pans and because of the extra oven openings to scramble the batter. But the time and trouble was worth it! The finished dish was light, fluffy and very easy to slice into squared proportions for easy dish-outs. Breakfast was served buffet style and the kids had no problems serving themselves. My advice is to use the deepest baking dish you have. The egg mixture shouldn't fill more than 2/3 of your baking pan.

Really lovely - the eggs turned out quite fluffy and had a nice texture.   The only change I'd make is to use less butter next time; however, these are otherwise fabulous and a GREAT go-to when you've got a crowd to feed!

Yummy, fluffy eggs!! They come out so wonderful this way.  I made the recipe as written, except for cutting it in half, the first time I made them and they were perfect.  I have since made them several more times and have played around with additional ingredients, cheese, ham, various spices..all teriffic.  Don't be scared to try these baked eggs, you'll be pleasantly surprised!

Probably the best and easiest recipe I have found for making scramble eggs. They are light and fluffy and have good flavor. Also its much easier than standing over the stove, since you pretty much set it and forget it.

Just made half recipe in a 7 x 11 casserole and everyone loved it. I did add a little sauteed onion and green pepper with a cup of cheddar cheese at the 15 minute mark. Wonderful recipe easy to customize to taste! I'll use this regularly now. Thanks, Erin!

It didn't turn out like I was expecting, I ended up cooking quite a bit longer than 20-25 mins, & that was w/ recipe halved but still in 9x13 pan....??? I think the milk was too much in my batch & they lacked flavor. I think I've done pretty well on the skillet cooking of scrambled eggs so I will probably just stick to it. But it was worth the shot, I just did not like how they turned out for us.

Wow! Perfect consistency and great taste, very easy to make. Thanks so much for this recipe it is a keeper. No need to change a thing. And although it says to serve immediately, these taste wonderful as leftovers.

Made this with 11 eggs and a 7X11 glass dish, using 1/2 of all recipe items. I also added some grated cheese at the 10 minute stirring. I did need to stir it at 30 min and let it go another 5 min to finish setting up. I also added pepper while mixing in the milk.
Everyone liked the recipe, and it saved me a lot of time on top of the stove. Possibly the cinnamon rolls cooking at the same time made this cook slower than it should have, but it was delicious, without so much ingredients that the 4 1/2 year old fussy eater did not turn it away. She thinks PopPop can do no harm to eggs.
I think if we had all adults, I could have slipped in some onion and green and/or red peppers.

In my oven, the cooking time was about 10 minutes longer than listed.  Very happy with the ease of prep and the satisfying results!!

Worked out perfect and very delicious!  I topped mine with some leftover bacon and shredded cheddar.  I am really glad to have this new way of making scrambled eggs for large crowds.

I made this recipe last year and it was way too much butter and it took longer to cook than the recipe stated. But I just recently made it again, only a half recipe. I used half the amount of butter in the recipe and used an 8 x 8 pan. It cooked up in 25 minutes and was fantastic. Definitely use half the butter but if you make a full recipe you will need additional time to cook it.

Eh. Still searching for a great Scrambled Egg recipe. Maybe, this doesn't translate when you make it just for one. I divided everything by 8 to accomodate 3 eggs. Oh, well.

These were nice and fluffy.  We were surprised, but they did seem a little something.  I guess it's a texture thing.

Made this for the first time for my boss' birthday.  It was so easy and super fluffy.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe (LOL).  The only items I added was 2 cans of diced green chiles and some diced red bell peppers.  It was a Mexican Breakfast Buffet.  Will do eggs like this all the time, especially for a large group.

Served it at a Thanksgiving brunch.  Great way to make eggs for everyone, finished at the same time.  They were the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest eggs I have ever had.  Even the leftovers, reheated the next day tasted great.  Thanks for sharing.

Light and fluffy.  Yummm.  Be careful pulling it out of the oven to stir, however.  I pulled too fast and a bunch of the eggs slopped over the side and onto the oven door.  What a mess!

I just made this recipe tonight and it was great. I'm not much of a cook and my scrambled eggs don't come out so well but this was was just easy and the eggs did turn out fluffy. The only thing I added was some American cheese since I like cheesy eggs. I will make this again, maybe for my family at Christmas. I would add a photo but it's too late, I ate it all, lol.

I adjusted to 4 servings and used 9X9 pan.  These were delicious, fluffy, easy.  My only changes were to use 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 Smart Balance, and 1% milk.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this just a couple of hours ago and it was so amazing. I made it just for 2 servings and added peppers,smoked chicken breast and three cheese( Parmesan,mozzarella and provolone). I used 350F at first but it was too slow so I made it 375 and it cooked a bit faster. Thanks for the recipe.

I couldn't believe how easy and yummy these eggs were!  Like others before me, I think I may have cooked my last scrambled eggs on the stovetop! I'm dreaming of fluffy eggs with onions and mushrooms, cheese, oh, so many things I can do with this! Thanks for posting this recipe, I never would have thought of doing it this way; now I'll never do it any other way!

I just made these this weekend for a brunch.  Made two batches and they were fantastic and everyone asked how I made them.  I will use this over and over.  I did find that I needed to cook them a bit longer.  Maybe it's my oven.  So simple!!

I added  8oz cream cheese to butter in pan and melted them together.   Then mixed chopped fresh chives with the eggs.  I have already been asked for the recipe.

Really, really good and easy. I used about a quarter less butter. Also, I think the cooking time depends on how big your pan is and how deep the egg mixture is. I cooked at 375 degrees and it took about twice as long as listed.

Fabulous!  I don't do eggs any other way anymore.  I have also adjusted the time down for only an egg or two.  My kids do these for breakfast.  Great recipe and easy to adapt to your own tastes.

I thought these eggs were delicious, though very rich. My husband, who usually eats 4 times as much as I, could only eat a small serving of these eggs. I would suggest leaving the butter out, or at least cutting it down a bit.

I made these this morning, I scaled it down to two servings for my two little boys and myself.  I melted the butter right in the glass baking dish in the microwave.  I stirred them a few times.  These turned out very good, definitely a step up from regular scrambled eggs.  I will make these again!

This was the perfect recipe for a function I made breakfast burritos for. The only thing I would change is the amount of butter. Once I took the pans out it seemed like a layer of butter was just sitting on the top! I suggest using half as much as what the recipe says, basically just coat the pan.

Outstanding. I had to add ten minutes to the final cooking time, that may have been due to using cold ingredients straight out of the fridge. But other than that, this was terrific.

Made a 1/2 batch for egg/bacon sandwiches on bagels.  Added some shredded cheese to the mix before baking and put it in a smaller glass pan.  Took alot longer to cook doing it that way and made them pretty thick.  Had some big air bubbles as well.  They seem to taste good though.  May need to play with it some more, but I'll know more tomorrow when I take my bagel sandwich for breakfast!  OVerall .. pretty good It hought

I did not care for the flavor or the texture of these eggs.  I don't know that I've ever had re-hydrated eggs but this is what I imagine them to taste like.  Most of my guests did comment on how tasty they were but I'm not sure if that was just out of courtesy.  I will stick to stove top eggs from now on.

I made these for our MOPS ladies and they were so easy and good. I'm doing it again this week. Last time it was for Burrittos this time I will add cooked bacon and maybe a  little cheese.  I did stir them several times during the baking process. I had to trasnport them, but they were still pretty warm by breakfast time.

This recipe couldn't have been easier and it was delicious!  I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because I think it could use a little zip.  As is, it is typical scrambled eggs only easier, so if your family has a simple palate or if you're cooking for a crowd and want to keep it basic, the recipe is perfect.  Next time I'd like to try adding some other seasonings or some veggies.  Based on other's reviews, I cut the salt in half and used 6 tablespoons of butter instead of 8. For some reason, mine took about 15 minutes longter to cook than the time stated on the recipe.  Enjoy!

These were really good.  I used half and half instead of milk because I had it.  I scaled down the recipe to test before I serve them on Thanksgiving morning.  20 minutes was perfect in my oven. I'll be adding linguica when serving company.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It was definitely easier to cook these than regular scrambled eggs in a pan, but they ended up waaay to salty based on the recipe. They weren't as flavorful as usual either...

Made this for Easter breakfast.  Followed this recipe as directed.  They came out so nice and fluffy. Took about 15 more minutes to cook then stated.  Will never cook scrambled eggs on top of stove again.
I've been using the 9x13 casserole dish whenever I made it.  This Easter I used a 15x10 (128 oz) baking dish,  dish isn't as full and easier to stir, don't have to worry about spilling over.

Really good.  Made these for Easter Brunch and there were no leftovers.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 and was glad I did.  Otherwise these were excellent and fluffy.

These eggs were perfect!! I was looking for a recipe that would give me fluffy "restaurant style" scrambled eggs and this is it. I made them for Easter breakfast at church and EVERYONE wanted to know my secret! It did take a lot longer for them to cook than listed though. But I other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  I consider myself a good cook but I have never been able to get really good scrambled eggs until now.  I cooked a breakfast for 40 people last week and used this recipe for the eggs.  They came out wonderful!  I did need to leave them in the oven a little longer than the 20 min., probably because of the quantity. I will always make my scrambled eggs this way in the future.

Great recipe. Very tasty and easy to make. I made 1/2 the recipe and it took a little longer to cook than suggested. I also stirred the eggs at the end to make them look more scrambled. Everyone loved them and they still tasted great the next day for left-overs. Will definately make this again.

PERFECT!!! Holiday breakfast eggs will never be made on the stove again! You don't even need all the butter. I cut it in half next time. Fluffy and exactly how eggs should be. And SO easy!!!

I made this for a family brunch that my boyfriend and I hosted. I found it took longer than the recipe called for. 40 minutes in total as opposed to 25 minutes. They were great and so much easier than making in a pan. I will continue make scrabled eggs this way from now on.

Perfect eggs! They are fluffy, moist, easy to make, and a huge hit at our Mother's Day brunch. I used slightly less salt and butter, subbed in half-n-half in place of 1/2 cup of milk, added shredded cheese after baking, and served with chopped green onions, salsa, and hot sauce. The leftovers will be perfect for breakfast burritos. YUM!

I put off making these for a long time because they just sounded weird.  I finally made them last  night, and they were amazing.  I can't imagine making scrambled eggs any other way now.  They came out fluffy and moist and perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly except scaling it to three servings.  My family raved about them.

EXCELLENT!  I usually add four different seasonings to flavor my eggs, but chose to follow this recipe to the tee.  The eggs were light and fluffy and did not require any more flavoring.  I'm glad I didn't adjust the recipe.  It might have been a bit much.

What a great idea.  I won't make scrambled eggs any other way! This recipe is so convenient, you can adjust the serving size (I usually make enough for 3...) without fuss and add any extras that you prefer. Pop these babies in the oven and prepare the rest of breakfast! Its so simple.

I made these for a brunch - one batch with a handful of cheddar cheese tossed in, the other with some goat cheese and some snipped chives. WOW! Everyone asked for the recipe and now, these have become the eggs we all make for our regular group brunches. The only change I would make is that I always need to bake them about 10 extra minutes to get the texture I like.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My mom and I fixed this for dinner and it was WONDERFUL! They were light and fluffy. We thought it was weird fixing our eggs in the oven, but they were great! We did make some chages that other reviewers suggested. We used PAM instead of butter and we used half the salt. We used 10 eggs and cooked them in a 12x8 pyrex glass baking dish and it got done right about on time. We might add some cheese next time for variety. I hope we make this alot.

easy!  I omitted most of the butter and instead sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.  I also used 12 eggs and one carton of egg whites and added a dollop of sour cream and some sausage.  Everyone raved!

This dish is similar to one my mother-in-law makes using cornflakes and sausage.  This was really simple and turned out good.  However I did make some adjustments.  I was only cooking for two so I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 dish.  Maybe I should have quartered the ingredients.  It took about 15 min. longer to cook and the last 5 min. I actually turned the heat up to 375.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it was a little too plain.  Then again that makes it easy for anyone to add whatever they like.  You can add whatever you usually add to your scrambled eggs or omelets.  I added onions, shredded cheese, oregano, seasoned salt, and pepper.  When it was almost done I added more shredded cheese to the top and broiled it for two min.  Next time I think I will only use 6 eggs, 3/4 cup of milk, and bake in the same dish.

Amazing! I have never achieved eggs this fluffy on a pan. Dead easy to make, even a novice cook would have success. This is the ONLY way to make scrambled eggs for breakfast lovers. It's so easy to adjust the ingredients to cater for the number of people you are cooking for. My parents were shocked that these eggs were made in the oven! A definate keeper.

Great basic recipe! After adding seasonings and a little italian sausage before baking, it was perfect. I cut the recipe in half for a smaller crowd (6 whole eggs and one package of Southwestern egg beaters). I plated it topped with sauteed onion, and mushrooms. Thanks so much!

This was a hit with our family.  It was very easy to make and the timing was fine.  Next time I will reduce the amount of salt.  The eggs were a little salty for my taste.

what a GREAT way to feed a crowd the most incredible eggs!  Followed the recipe exactly, and can't wait to add other ingredients like others have suggested.  It took a while for the eggs to begin to set, but well worth monitoring carefully...what a dish!  A million thanks for this one!!

This is a busy moms dream come true. I have put this recipe to use in ways I never thought I would have. They or great just as they are and I use them most often in breakfast burritos. This way I have to stove top for all the other things and don't have to mess with the eggs. They come out perfect everytime. Thanks for the great recipe.

I scaled this down to 4 eggs since that is what I had, and it was perfect for 2 people. I used an 8x8 enameled cast iron pan.  The eggs were light and fluffy without any of that crusty brown stuff that I hate!  I'll be making scrambled eggs this way all the time now.  We tried it a second time by throwing in chopped bacon and shredded cheese at the 10minute mark and that was also very good.

I do this recipe in half in a 9x9 glass pan.  It works well and is much tastier than scrambled eggs. Great for a large group

This recipe took about 15 minutes longer to bake than called for. The edges were then over-baked, while the center was just set. It would have taken less time to just scramble the eggs in a skillet (or two).

While cooking several things, I took this recipe for granted and checked the eggs with 5 minutes to go, they weren‚Äôt even close. Timer goes off and they were way over done, I had it set for 3 minutes early. I think if I hadn‚Äôt wanted to be able to leave it and count on it, it would have been fine. If I have to watch it like I do eggs on the stove, I might as well have the control of doing them on the stove. Then I‚Äôm a bit of control freak anyway.

I made it for a breakfast party at work today exactly as is and it was outstanding. People were seeking me out to tell me how wonderful these eggs were. Light and fluffy. The only thing I had to do differently was cook longer. I‚Äôm guessing cause the milk I added was so cold. I did exactly as it says but after stirring after the second 10 minutes I added another 10 minutes then stirred again and still too runny. I added another 5 minutes and that did the trick. So total baking time for me was 35 minutes.

OMG! Best recipe ever! These came out better than when I make them in the pan especially for a large quantity of eggs. Perfect for a crowd, brunch, dinner, etc. I am going to make these again & again.  Very versatile too. Try adding saut√©ed spinach, tomatoes, onions,  cheese.etc. Going to try to cut back on the butter to make it a little healthier. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

I just made these eggs,  I forgot to take a picture!  I cut the recipe in half as did not want to waste two dozen if it did not turn out good.  However, the eggs are marvellous!!  and I will absolutely be making them this way for our Christmas brunch!

Made for a Veteran's Day Breakfast this morning and it turned out great, easy and fluffy! I did 25 eggs, (Just what I had left in two cartons,) 2c milk, 25-ish grinds of my salt mill and added pepper. Other tips -whisked w my hand held mixer/whisk attachment to save time and hands. Also, did a 10 x 15 Pyrex dish with a little Cooking spray, (I went bigger on the dish per suggestions and was glad I did.) I still melted 1/4c butter at the end of the preheat for some extra flavor.  But, 1/2c seemed like it would have been too much. Poured in, stirred a bit and cooked as instructed. Watch at the end they do puff up! They broke up nicely just with a rubber spoonula. ;-) Awesome for a crowd. Served with green chili, cheese and tortillas.

Made this exactly how the recipe called for it. The eggs turned out really good. The texture was amazing. I recommend cooking eggs this way when you are preparing other things with them. Takes too much time to make them alone.

Great recipe. We added cheese. Only thing I would say is plan for a lot more than 20 minutes. Ours took about 45 minutes to bake.

One word: AMAZING!!!  I use this recipe for burritos.  I used salted butter and 1% milk.  I do drain them for burritos, but I wonder if I would have to drain them at all if I used whole milk.

I had high hopes for this, after reading the reviews, but this just did not work for me. I cut the recipe in half, using only 12 eggs, but kept the pan size the same (13" x 9"). I counted on the 25 minutes baking time, which should have been even less being that the pan only contained half the egg mixture, but after 25 minutes, the eggs were barely starting to set on the bottom. I was making brioche french toast and sausages at the same time, which I intended to serve all at once along with the eggs, but that didn't happen. After 25 minutes,  my guests ended up eating the french toast and sausage, while I transferred the eggs to a frying pan on the stove to finish them, so we could eat them after the rest of our brunch. The eggs were tasty once completed on the stove top, but the baking time stated in the recipe has to be off. It's not my oven either, as I had just baked biscuits at 350 degrees prior to putting the eggs in the oven, and my biscuits baked up in the required time. I won't be using this method again. Much easier to just cook them on the stove, in a large pan. Sorry!

Perfect!  I used the servings converter for 18, reduced the salt by 1/4 tsp. Replaced 3/4 c of the milk with half/half.  Divided this amount into two 9x13 pans and it cooked beautifully. I stirred both pans after 10 minutes.  Since one pan is darker than they other, the dark pan only took an additional 13 minutes while the other took 15.  Put the eggs in a crock pot on Keep Warm for a ‚Äúmake your own breakfast burrito bar‚Äù. Served chopped fresh veggies, shredded cheese, salsa, crumbled sausage, bacon, ham for toppings. It was a hit and I was happy I could do lots of it the day before!

I loved these eggs. They take longer then it recommends to bake and for some reason water/juices collect on the bottom of the pan but other then that I would recommend these. Anyone cooking for a lot of people needs to try these. I like them better then when using the flying pan.

I adjusted the recipe for 30 & divided between 2 pans because I was cooking for a crowd. It just took a few minutes longer. I omitted salt because we don‚Äôt use it. The eggs had good texture & flavor. We ate them all. I saved the recipe to use again.

This is a great base recipe.  Based on the reviews of others, I wanted to make this a bit healthier but still tastey for my large gathering.  I used 12 eggs and 24 egg whites (or 3 cups of the liquid egg whites), and 1/4 cup of butter.  Some reviewers also said they found the milk to egg ratio too high, so I cut the milk down to 1.5 cups.  I like to season mine with pepper and onion powder as well.  I found the timing to be right, and the instruction to scrape the bottom of the dish every 10 minutes was very helpful in getting everything to cook evenly. This will be a go-to potluck or large gathering brunch recipe!

Easy and good way to do scrambled eggs for a group. I cut the amount of butter in half and cut the salt down to 2 teas, then thought it would be too salty so I added 4 more eggs with a little more milk and it was just right. Would have been too salty without adding the extra eggs. 1 teas would be plenty. Definitely will make again.

Light and fluffy. Added parsley and sharp cheddar after the stir. I turned the oven off after 15 minutes and let the heat from the oven finish the cooking. Otherwise, it would have been overcooked when halving the recipe. Served with bacon and home made English Muffin bread. Amazing!

I was surprised to discover that the eggs turn out moist yet fluffy through baking. I think the key is to avoid stirring them too often. I made this to feed a group of  15 people two days in a row. On the first day I cooked bacon and toasted bread while the eggs baked. The second day I split the ingredients in half and added minced garlic, spinach and cheese to one half. And cheese only in the second half. I received compliments on all three versions. I will definitely make these again for large groups of people.

Great way to serve scrambled eggs to a big crowd! I've made this quite a few times for 40-60 people. This morning, I doubled the recipe + a little and did whipped 54 eggs in my kitchen aide mixer. Just before they were finished cooking, I stirred them again and added cooked sausage, cheese, and diced bell peppers. As usual, I got rave reviews. They were served with tortillas and breakfast burrito toppings. Thanks for sharing the recipe and making my life easier!

Easy and delicious!   I made half the recipe and baked in an 8 x 8 glass pan.   Cooking time needed to be increased by an additional 10 minutes .  Everyone loved these and I will be making again soon!

It was so easy.  And I think tasted better than scrambled eggs in a frying pan.  I did only make four servings.  I also added pepper, and then added cheese and crumbled cooked bacon after 10 minutes.  My eggs were done after about 12 minutes.  Delicious!   ????

Worked out super well for our family's New Year's Day brunch.  I had to cook it a bit longer, but probably because people kept opening the oven - but it didn't hurt it.  I will make this again - and I will season it more aggressively.  It's a beautiful base recipe for a crowd that can be adapted so many different ways.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I made 8 eggs with 1/3 c milk in an 8x8 glass dish. I started by melting the butter in a saute pan then saut√©ing 1/4 c each of chopped green pepper, onion and tomato. I then dumped this in the glass dish and poured the egg mixture over.  At 15 minutes I stirred & at 30 minutes I stirred in a little shredded cheddar. It was a delicious hit!

I used italian cheese blend finely shredded cheese and adjusted the recipe for 18 eggs. My bf was skeptical about eggs in the oven but I've made them before when I was a cook and knew they'd be good. He loved them. They were nice and moist, we just added pepper to taste at the table. I'll add it to the recipe next time. So much easier than the stove top!!

This recipe turned out fluffy, moist eggs--they were really good. I cut the recipe by 1/4, using 18 eggs and reducing other ingredients proportionately. They fed my company, with eggs to spare. Will turn to this recipe again.

Delicious! I've tried doing it by stove and had issues with it. I also had resorted to do it via microwave in a mug. But this was easy to make. I had no tweaks and paired it with avocado and a few slices of turkey bacon. Would make it again for sure.

I did have to cook longer than the recipe says...about 20-25 minutes longer.  Also for an easy clean-up, line the baking dish with parchment paper.

This dish definitely is husband approved.  I made a half-recipe for the two of us for Saturday morning breakfast.  But, I will served the full recipe to guests for the Thanksgiving holiday.  I served it with the sauteed vegetables, but my husband liked it better without.  The flavor is awesome!

I‚Äôm giving it a 5 star rating because everyone said they were great.  I made 2 trays but I didn‚Äôt get to taste them.  I used disposable pans which were bigger than 9 by 13 however they took longer to cook than showed in recipe.  Perhaps because I had 2 trays in the oven, not sure.  I will make them again, friends loved them.

I thought this was very good, and I was surprised how fluffy the eggs got.  I made this for only one serving, to try it out, and I thought that there might have been a little too much butter, but maybe it would be the right amount for the full recipe  The only change I made is that I used about 2/3 half and half and 1/3 water because I didn't have any plain milk on hand.

I used the original recipe but reduced it for 2 people using  the following proportions: 1 tablespoon butter melted in a round glass 6" diameter ( 3" high) dish.   Thoroughly mixed together 3 eggs, 1/4 heaping teaspoon salt  and 3 tablespoons milk.  Put the egg mixture in the dish and then into the oven for 5 minutes.  Added chopped fresh spinach and pre-cooked fresh mushrooms, then stirred before returning to the oven.  I stirred the mixture again after another 5 minutes and removed the finished eggs at the end of a total of 15 minutes in the oven.  The dish was wonderful and so adaptable to any meats, cheeses and veggies you might have on hand.  This is SO much easier than making eggs on the stove top.

I added chives and truffle oil to the mixture. It came out very rich in flavour,  but still delicate in its texture. Great formula to make scrambled eggs.

I followed the recipe and the eggs came out light and fluffy. This was a crowd pleaser.
NOTE: use Pam on the sides of the baking dish so the eggs don't stick to the side of the glass baking dish

This is a great and easy recipe for the harried cook needing to put breakfast together for a crowd, it's super easy and basically makes itself.  I added some shredded cheddar, and next time may add some saut√©ed mushrooms, onions and peppers.

Very easy, simple and DELICIOUS! Took longer to cook but that could be due to my oven. Highly recommend this recipe. Made extra for breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. Also, added cheese and ham. Next time I am going to try sausage. Thanks SO much for sharing this with us!

This is a great way to make scrambled eggs. Very light and fluffy and very easy. I've made this with skim milk but for best flavor use whole milk, half and half or cream.  I make these often on the weekends and for morning work functions. They are great on their own or as part of a breakfast burrito bar.

I will definitely make this again!  I loved how they turned out, very fluffy and delicious.  The only thing I had to change was the cooking time and oven temp.  After 15 minutes at 350 degrees it was all still liquid, so I had to kick up my oven temp to 400 degrees, and it took 20 more minutes until the first stir, then another 15 minutes to finish baking.  Next time I will add cooked sausage and cheese.  Very good, thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are excellent.  Period.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the only complaint I have is I had to cook them MUCH longer than the recipe called for.  I baked for 10 mins. and stirred and it was still very runny.  Baked for the next 15 mins as suggested and when I pulled it out it was starting to set on the sides of the pan, but it was still VERY runny, so I baked it for another 10 mins and viola, it was PERFECTION!  Yummy, fluffy, delectable eggs.  I will be making these again for sure.

Very easy, tasted great and I think you could alter it in many ways (add veggies, meat, etc.). The only thing that needed adjusted was cooking time. It took almost twice as long as directed. Keep a watch though because near the end it cooked fast.

I have made these many times, often for large groups. They always turn out great. I have made the recipe exactly as listed and it is great. Sometimes I add cheese and ham to make it more of a casserole, but the recipe "as is" is perfect! Takes a lot less time to bake and the eggs turn out really light and fluffy.

I made these eggs exactly according to the recipe for Mother's Day brunch instead of our traditional breakfast casserole. To avoid the splash-over during stirring that was mentioned in reviews, I used an extra-deep 9 x 13 casserole. The eggs took about 15 minutes longer than stated and I gave them an additional stirring. When done, I covered them with my casserole's ceramic lid to keep them warm for about 15 minutes until we ate. They were absolutely wonderful and everyone remarked how fantastic the texture and flavor (due to the butter) were. This will be a permanent family recipe from now on!

I have made this several times, for brunches and just when I don't feel like putting much energy into breakfast (or even dinner). This method is awesome! You can prep the eggs and milk the night before, so you only have to melt the butter and season when you're about to cook them (don't add salt until you're actually baking as it pulls water from the eggs and makes them tough). These taste like restaurant-quality scrambled eggs- fluffy, creamy, well-cooked but not dry, and just delicious. Add finely diced cooked bacon or ham, (cooked) veggies, and/or shredded/crumbled cheese at the halfway point for eggs-tra special eggs! ;)

Halved this recipe and baked in 8x8. Took significantly longer than expected which was no big deal. However, even after slightly reducing the halved amount of butter and salt, these were way too buttery and salty. Texture-wise, I prefer stove-top preparation. My husband, myself and our sons, ages 15 and 12, all commented that this was way too much butter and salt. Edible but definitely not going in the saved recipes.

These were PERFECT!! To use for breakfast sandwiches,  just halve the recipe in the same size pan and cut them into 12 squares!! They  are peffectly fluffy and moist! I'm hoping to freeze the squares from this to make ready-made breakfast sandwiches!

CRUCIAL INFO:  24 large eggs plus 2 1/2 cups of milk DO NOT FIT in a 9 x 13 baking dish with enough room to prevent pouring the contents all over the floor when trying to move the dish to the oven.  Also, 25 minutes is not nearly enough time for the eggs to be done.   Don't ask me how I know these things, I just do.  I had to pour them into a LARGE skillet to finish them in a more expedient fashion.  HOWEVER, all of that said, the flavor was excellent, and they were nice and fluffy.  I will likely use this recipe again, but with a larger baking dish, and allowing more time if done in one larger dish, or perhaps if separated into two dishes they might cook in the stated time, but I haven't tried it yet.

Since I was just cooking for my husband, my 2yr old and myself I did 1/3 of this recipe. I may have made an error in the conversion but found it a bit salty for my tastes. I loved the texture and flavour otherwise (although we added garlic seasoning to ours). My husband loved the flavour but prefers his eggs more "runny" style so didn't like the texture. If you want a nice fluffy scrambled egg this one is for you!

These eggs turned out quite well given the standard recipe. I like that they are easy to tweak as far as flavour is concerned and can be made with minimal effort (freeing up one's time for other meal prep). I really liked topping mine with thick sour cream, smoked trout, and dill. Meanwhile, the kids liked theirs with ketchup or maple syrup. There are many different options available.

I took away one star because the eggs weren't ready  after the recommended time (timing matters when the directions say to serve immediately). I found they needed 30-35 minutes with stirring every ten minutes. 20 minutes left them 1/2 soupy and 25 had them looking 1/3 soupy. 35 made them firm yet moist. If you like your eggs pretty dry, I would even suggest 40-45. 

I have an oven thermometer and know my oven temperature is accurate. I think using a deeper baking dish might have helped. The eggs were very close to the top, so the oven door needed to be completely opened each time to carefully put the eggs in without spilling. That probably let out quite a bit of heat. That being said, I appreciated the extra time to prep other items and the results were still great.

I used EggBeaters instead of eggs and non-fat half & half and it was not only delicious, but EASY.  They were nice and fluffy, and even tasted like my mom's used to taste! (must have been the milk!)
Since it was just my husband and myself, I revised the serving amounts, and cooked it in a medium skillet instead of a dish (like a frittata).  It came out just fine.
ALL my scrambled eggs from now on will be baked!!

I used this recipe for breakfast for a crowd!  They came out exceptionally well.  The ease of doing 2 dozen eggs at once was incredible!  The only change I'd try would be to use less butter, they seemed to be swimming in butter in dish by the time they were half gone.  My family reaves about their fluffy texture and taste!

I'm very picky about my scrambled eggs and I *hate* making them - they just never seem to turn out right. I saw this and had to give it a shot. I was so happy I did!
The eggs came out perfect- not runny, but still a great consistency. I added some scallions but that didn't effect how it cooked in any way. They were  SO good and easy- try them! You won't be disappointed.

First time I made scrambled eggs in the oven and it came out fantastic. Compliments all around at brunch. To make it richer, I used cream instead of milk.

This is a fabulous recipe! Scrambled eggs have never been my favorite and this recipe has made me into a believer in scrambled eggs. It is fluffy, light and delicious. My family loves scrambled eggs and  from now on this is how we make scrambled eggs  in our household.
thanks for posting Erin!

These were so delicious!  My husband loves scrambled eggs, but when I make them on the stove top it is hard to get them just right.  Not  so with this recipe.  They were moist, fluffy, and delicious.  I did add bacon and cheese after the first 10 minutes.  So good.  My husband asked for the recipe to use at a church breakfast that his group is hosting in the future.

Needed to cook longer than the 20 min. stated.  Added seasoning that suited our taste.  Did use 2 doz eggs for a group of 14 and there was a small amount left, I just refrigerated them and reheated them the next morning for our breakfast burritos.  They were still fluffy and didn't seem dried out.  I did have cheese and salsa added to them.   will do again when we have a group.

Just like the scrambled eggs at the hotel hot breakfast buffets.  Quick tip: put butter in the cooking pan/dish and let butter melt in oven while oven is preheating. Pour egg mixture into hot dish, directly on top of melted butter.  Also, if you need a smaller portion, this recipe works well when proportionately reducing ingredients; cook time stays the same.

From what I've been told, I overcook eggs. I always fear they're under cooked and we're going to get sick. This recipe has saved me! Moist, flavorful, fluffy, yet DONE eggs that everyone can enjoy! I even tested this out when meeting my boyfriend's parents for the first time and they were impressed! Thanks for a great recipe! I also love the use of the oven instead of the stove!

I made this exactly as written (scaled down to my family size) The only thing I changed was cooking time, I did 15 minutes and stirred, then 15 minutes and done. They came out perfect!  My husband and I loved them. They were light, fluffy and moist. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe is fantastic for a crowd! I always make these for my family when they are in town. And last night, I was over a friend‚Äôs house for a brunch themed couples gathering and whipped up a pan of these eggs on short notice. I added shredded cheddar cheese after the initial 10 minutes and some adobo seasoning. This is definitely a keeper!

What a timesaver! I added 2 pounds of cooked breakfast sausage and 12 slices of American cheese. Then the eggs go into tortillas and into the freezer for breakfast burritos. When daughter #2 goes to college, I will replace some of the milk with salsa. 

Thanks for sharing!

Used this recipe to feed our small town football team for 3 Saturday playoff games last year. They were quite the meals with bacon, deer sausage, caramel rolls, etc. Our boys won STATE, so  guess this is a good luck recipe. I reduced the eggs by about 3....and a bit less milk. They run over and make quite the mess otherwise. Great recipe!

Very good. I made the mistake of adding pepper before baking, which, only clumped together and made black swirls in the eggs. I will be sure to add it after next time. Plus, I personally don't like a lot of salt. I added 2 scant tsps., which I think was still too much. I will cut back to 1 1/2 tsp next time. I love how easy it was and how you can add whatever meat, veggies or cheese you like. I did have to increase the baking time, but that was no biggy. A definite keeper!

This is an amazing recipe! I have made it several times, for large breakfasts and brunches. I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and it was fine. Be sure to stir the eggs at 10 minutes as directed.

This is a great way to make eggs!  I can totally see the logic for making this for larger crowds - but that is not why I chose to make this way.  I like the ease of the cooking method; especially when I am cooking multiple things at the same time. Genius idea.

This is incredible and so easy. I wanted a healthier version so I omitted the butter altogether and sprayed the dish with olive oil spray. I used an immersion blender to beat 24 eggs and added the salt and 1.5 cups water and some cracked pepper. I was worried without the butter and milk that it would be bland but it was DELICIOUS and so fluffy. They tasted buttery and rich. No one could believe they just has water and salt and pepper. I highly recommend this version!

These turned out perfectly. The only change I made was to turn the broiler on high for 2 mins after they were done because my husband likes the little crispy egg bits.

Very easy to make and taste good, however, did find it was too salty. Will make it again when I have company for breakfast but will decrease salt a bit. I rated it 4 stars because it was a bit too salty and also because it is not quite as good as stovetop but still great if you need to cook for a big group. Tasted just like scrambled eggs you would eat at a buffet style brunch.

It set off the smoke alarms while cooking. It was great tasting and filling. I'd make it again but maybe less salt and butter overall .

Came out perfectly!   I had 4 college kid guests, and they all approved.  I like the simplicity of it.   I made a half-recipe in my 9x13" pan.   At the 10 minute mark, I stirred with a spatula, as you do on the stove.  About 15 minutes later, I sprinkled on some grated cheese and let them finish with the oven turned off.   Yay!

These are the best scrambled eggs I've had in a long time.  I used almond milk, we are lactose intolerant and they came out great!  I did halve the recipe and used a glass casserole and had no problems.

Had people coming for brunch in 15 minutes and had 18 eggs to cook. This recipe was wonderful. Quick, and delicious. The eggs really looked and tasted like scrambled eggs. My new go to recipe.

Super easy, tasty, and fluffy! I've made these several times because they're so easy when cooking for a larger crowd. The key is definitely to stir them several times.

Amazing scrambled eggs.   So easy to prepare in the oven.  Made three batches for teachers' breakfast meeting.   I was worried about baking time and possible overflow so I used three aluminum disposal large roaster pans.  Eggs baked up quicker and I was able to transport all three batches in one roaster pan.  I stacked them for extra support and warmth.  
I used whole milk, unsalted butter.  I did add cream cheese for creaminess.    I served them in a Bella 6 quart electric warmer.   They were perfect.   Thanks Erin for sharing a great recipe.

I was hesitant to make this recipe for party but did based on all the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! Even our boys who normally refuse to eat eggs had second helpings. Everyone at our party enjoyed them. We will definitely be making them again!

I make these eggs at our vacation home.  Easy and delicious and satisfies a big crowd.  Because everyone gets up at staggered times, I transfer the eggs to a crockpot on "warm".  Easy self serve!

I probably used too deep a casserole dish so it did take an extra 10-15 minutes to finish.  However, baking these in the oven saved on stove space when we made brunch for twenty!  If no one had seen me pull the dish out of the oven everyone would have thought this was a traditional scramble!  The eggs were very tasty!

I've made this twice now.   I liked it better the first time, when I used 13 eggs in a square cake pan.  I stirred when the eggs hadn't yet set, and the dish turned out like a souffle.  The second time I made a 7-egg version in a loaf pan, waited until the eggs had partially set before stirring, and so the dish was really more like scrambled eggs.  Still good, but not as fluffy as the first time.   My husband and son love this, so I will be making it again very soon!

4 stars because the eggs left a lot of liquid behind, which was a little unappetizing.  But the eggs tasted amazing and looked good on the plate!  Everyone LOVED them and couldn't believe they were made in the oven.  This will definitely be my new go-to method for scrambled eggs.

I made these on a much smaller scale in my cast iron skillet in the oven. The only change I made was adding a dash of Franks hot sauce and freshly ground pepper. We like pepper so I used a lot but you can vary that to taste. Yum!

Followed the recipe added a little cheddar-just made it for
two. I wanted to test it before serving for a family brunch.
I thought it was very good and easy and will be making it along with a apple german pancake.

Super easy, great quick dish!  I added melted Boursin cheese to the egg batter before baking - So delicious!

I'm going to try it with pepperjack cheese, and add diced tomatoes and avocados once cooked.... YUM

Tried these for Easter brunch, thought how easy is this to put in the oven and not have to watch over them, if only it worked.  After 45 minutes the eggs were still totally liquid and I had used a larger pan.  Had to transfer to a skillet and finish cooking in order to get them on the table in time.  Good concept, but need to add a lot more time to the baking schedule.

I scaled this down to one serving and it came out perfect! Cooking scrambled eggs in a pan never works for me. It always looks too runny and then ends up burnt. That didn't happen with this recipe. I used a ramekin and adjusted the time for a small portion and the eggs were fluffy and delicious. Fresh cracked black pepper takes it to another level. Next time I'll play around and add cheese.

I tried the recipe as directed, however it didn't start to set until perhaps about 15 minutes into the cook.  If you're making this for a crowd it's excellent, just leave some extra cook time.

The eggs come out fluffy and delicious.  You have no more 'black stuff on side of pan' that you have to keep scraping off.  I did exactly as stated above, and a couple of times fluffed them while they were in the oven.  My daughter, not knowing how I made them, said she liked these eggs better than the ones I usually make >.

Best ever! I made this for a work breakfast and noone could believe it was baked! Lightest, fluffiest eggs I have ever had. And they stayed warm longer than they would have out of a skillet ?

I followed the recipe exactly and these eggs were GREAT!  Nice and easy, fluffy and buttery.  The next time I make them I'll try with less butter though, I think 1/4 cup would probably be just fine and more healthy.

Great recipe.  Cooking takes a bit longer and I recommend a little less butter. Best way to make a large batch of scrambled eggs.  Can't get any easier.

Great.  Made this for the ladies at the quilt retreat.  Added saut√©ed veggies (onion, mushroom, green pepper).  Very easy, none left.  Took longer to cook - about 45 minutes.  Also put a little cheddar cheese on top.

I halved this recipe and used a smaller dish.. it took longer to set, (I think maybe I used too small of a dish and it came out sort of "deep-dish"), but it was still delicious. So light and fluffy. I put a few slices of American cheese on the last few minutes. Great recipe

So, so easy and delicious.  On the advice of other reviewers, I halved the butter, then put in cheese, onions and diced red and green peppers for Christmas morning brunch.  The eggs turned out great, and I got to watch the kids open their stockings instead of standing over the stove.  Hanging on to this recipe!

So I live in low altitude...yes that makes a difference. I make 6 eggs with 1/4 cup melted butter in 2 quart casserole dish. I added 3/4 cup milk, 1/3 cup black bean salse and salt, garlic and chili pepper (to taste). Cooked at 450 for 12 min and then turned for another 7 mins...added 1/3 cup chedder cheese with another 1/8 mild for 2 mins ..awesome...fluffy. Add spices to your liking. Don't fault a recipe for flavor with spices if you don't put what you want. I will never use stove top again.

I halved the recipe and added  about one-forth of a large chopped diced onion,chopped cilantro, and half of an 8 oz. package of shredded Mexican cheddar cheese.Once it is finished cooking, add the remainder of the cheese to the top and pop back in the oven and melt the cheese. I would chop peppers in it but my children wouldn't eat it. They loved it. Cook time was about an hour. Stir about every 15 mins.

Made preparing a big breakfast much easier without having to babysit a skillet! I did have to increase the cooking time (my baking dish was small and rather deep) but the eggs were still light, fluffy, and moist. My oldest daughter hates scrambled eggs, but ate these and said they were better than being cooked on the stovetop.

These were a HUGE hit at a breakfast I served to a big crowd! Once prepared, I kept the eggs in a chafing dish, and they remained moist clear to the very end of our 3 hour open house serving time...although there were barely any eggs left!    Many people were amazed when I said the eggs were done in the oven. I did put a very light coating of virgin olive oil in the chafing serving dish to prevent any sticking, but not sure if that was really necessary.  This kind of serving dish provides a warm, moist heat, so that may have also contributed to helping the eggs remain moist for such a long time.  The cooking time in the oven took longer than the recipe stated, but that may have been due to the fact that I had other items cooking in the oven at the same time.  This is now my favorite way to make scrambled eggs!

The 2 1/2 cups of milk was way too much in my opinion.  I'll cut it down to 1 cup or less next time.  I added cheese, pepper, salsa and crushed tortilla chips to mine, and it was similar to migas.  Easy and quick to make without standing in front of the stove!  For that, I give it 4 stars.

So easy for Christmas morning.  Offered different topping.  Bacon, avocado, green onions, cheese and tomatoes.  Everyone raved about them which is funny for something so simple.  I think I will be doing this every Christmas since we have so many allergies and this can accommodate the different needs easily unlike the egg casseroles.

Super yummy! The kids really enjoyed it. I added a couple of handfuls of shredded mild cheddar cheese and pepper which was delicious! I stirred it again after 25 minutes too. Had to cook it for 35 minutes.

Really yummy and easy.  Although, I find that it takes much longer to cook than the recipe indicates.

A great recipe for convenience, and very easy to vary the taste by adding cheese, herbs, chopped meat, etc. A fabulous way to do breakfast without having to stand over the stove to stir the eggs. Thanks!

Very easy and turned out nice and fluufy as described.  Makes a huge dish of eggs.  We added some cheeses and other omlet type stuff and everyone said it was a winner.

I've made this recipe several times, and it is one of my facorites. I too, though have always had to increase the baking time by about 7-10 minutes. Thanks.

As far as scrambled eggs go, these were great!  They could definitely stand to be made more interesting with breakfast meats, vegetables etc.
