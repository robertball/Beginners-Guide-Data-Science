I think these are the best sandwiches I have ever had!  We had to modify a bit because it's still snowing here in WI - in April.  With these changes it was an easy indoor meal.  I tossed the chicken breasts and onions on the Foreman until they were done and toasted the bread in the toaster.  I used cayenne pepper (to taste) instead of the serrano.  I'm probably going to be dreaming about these until we make them again!

I made a few changes due to what I had on hand (whole chicken thigh on the Foreman grill, spinach instead of lettuce, no onions, everything combined on one sandwich for extra drippy goodness), but I think this just may be the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The minty lime, conjoined with the light spice of the peppers made for one of the most unique flavors I've ever tasted!

Loved this! I've made this several times. The only changes I make are: cooking chicken breast in crock pot and mixing it all together like a chicken salad. I also substitute cayenne pepper instead of serrano chilis for convenience.

This was pretty good. If you only put a few leaves of mint on the sandwich it actually blends perfectly.

Fixed this up and it came out tasting great.  Made a couple of small changes (cayenne powder instead of the chili and I seasoned/marinated the breasts with some poultry seasoning and lime juice).

My wife and I both thought it was great, but she wants me to fix up some bacon to go with it next time.  Looking forward to fixing it again.

I've made this a dozen times and it's a family favorite.  We especially love this in the summer on hot days.

Wasn't sure about the flavors at first but it was excellent.  Very refreshing summer sandwich and steps away from ordinary.

This was delicious! I was looking for a marinated chicken, though, so I used the same amounts of lime juice, mint, lime peel, and serrano chili with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and marinated for about 30 minutes before grilling. Then I followed the recipe for the mayo, grilled onions, and tomato. Outstanding! I'll be making this again!

Good and easy.  I added extra serranos and used my George Foreman grill for the chicken and onions.

Very refreshing sandwich indeed. Used plain yogurt instead as we don't like mayonnaise. Also omitted the 1/4 cup mint leaves as I don't like to eat mint leaves like that.  The chicken does need to be seasoned though which I'm glad I did with just salt & pepper. Finally, I sauted the chicken in a cast iron skillet instead of grilling as I wasn't in the mood to grill.
