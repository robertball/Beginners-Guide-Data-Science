Very tasty. since I don't like cottage cheese, I substituted the cottage cheese with shredded cheddar cheese. I also added half a packet of taco seasoning to the rice.
For the lovers of hot and spicy like me, I topped it with pickled jalpeno slices.

This is better as a dip because the corn chips get soggy. Next time I'll add more cheese, take out the corn chips, and add tortilla chips for dipping.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to do some substitutions, but it still turned out well. I didn't have any vegetarian chili so I used a can of black beans. I also left out the corn chips all together and just served some tortilla chips on the side. A good staple of a recipe that can be played with and still have good results. It's a keeper in our house.

This was pretty good. I made it as written except I thought 7 oz. of green chilies were too many for my taste, so I used one 3.5 oz can instead. I also used a bigger can of corn. I was a bit scared because it really doesn't look appetizing, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ate it as a casserole, but I can see it would be good used as a filling for tortillas or with tortilla chips as a dip for a party. Very versatile.

yummy basic recipe to use leftover rice and cans in your cupboard...I only had chilli oil and 2 cans of flavoured (hot) chilli beans and 1 can of tomato puree, so used these instead of garlic/salsa/chillies/veg chilli. Also used 3 green peppers, 1 red pepper and increased corn to make it more veggie-laden. Added an egg to bind it. And to make it healthier I crushed up Corn Thins instead of corn chips (if you've never had them search for them! they're popular here in New Zealand/Australia and are like rice cakes but thinner, tastier, more fiber, baked and made from corn, yum!  you can find where they're sold in the USA/elsewhere http://www.cornthins.com/)  served as a casserole w/ chopped tomatoes on side.  will make this recipe again, very tasty!

This was easy, but had too much cumin and chili powder.  I will make it again, but with less spice and more cheese.

This was great!  I made it almost exactly as the recipe indicated-I am not a huge cottage cheese fan so used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 cheddar cheese instead.  I made this about a month ago and it made a HUGE amount of food so I froze half of it before topping with the cheese and chips.  We just ate it last night and it freezes really well!  I served it with with tortillas, sliced avocados, and sour cream and it was fantastic!

I question the ingredients of 3 TBSP of chili powder and cumin.  The spices were overwhelming.

Heads up this calls for way too much chili powder.  I would say use only about 1/2 of what it says.

LOVE this dish. Last time I made it I added less chili powder but this time I forgot to heed the warnings of others and it was not good. Three T was way too much and I like spicy but that amount killed all the other flavors. This is a great dish to use up any left over homemade chili, I dont like the canned stuff so much.

The bell peppers went bad before I could use them and the casserole was still very tasty without them in it.  And next time I might add some chips to the bottom layer by suggestion of my husband.

Not nearly as good as I expected.  The crushed chips on top just separated from the rest of the dish after I baked it and just made a hard layer on top that was not good.  The rest of the dish was just okay.  I will continue looking for a better recipe.

Easy and quick to make. A little less chilli powder and garlic then the recipe calls for would have made it better. Those two flavors overpowered the others. But, it was still good. Would have been excellent with less of the two things i mentioned.

My spouse is on a diet and so I used low-fat ingredients, leaving off the cheese for the topping.  This made a very delicious meal with an added bonus of using the leftovers as filling for burritos!

There are way too many spices in this.  I should've read the other reviews before making it.  Also, it's not much of a casserole, more of a dip or filling.  It was alright, but even my mexican loving husband didn't eat that much of it.  So I doubt I'd make it again.

Delicious, quick and easy!  Make sure you use the largest skillet you have, because this makes a lot of food!  I serve it with extra corn chips for dipping.

This was great- i didn't add the bell peppers and used regular chili instead of veggitarian- it was really good- we rolled it up in tortillas and made burritos- hubby approved- and it will be something i make again--very easy and satisfying,
i would never think the combo of these ingr. would blend well, but they did-- TRY IT---

Took out the cottage cheese & used 2 T of chili powder...3 is WAY too much. Also added more cheese &, much needed, hamburger meat. I just posted the picture of how it turned out. It was ok. Won't be something I do often

This was delicious! Go easy on the spices and salsa if serving this to small children. (my son said it looked "super gross" and was too spicy, but he ate it all)It is also good w/o the cheese if you are vegan!

A good and tasty meatless supper that makes a lot.  I did cut the chili powder, cumin, and oregano back to a third of what was called for though.

This one was an instant hit!  I skipped the chip layer and sprinkled top with cubed velveta also replaced 1 T chili powder with chipolte powder because we perfer a little spicy.
