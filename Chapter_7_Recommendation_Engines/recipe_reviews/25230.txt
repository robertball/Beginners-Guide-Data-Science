OK,this really is quite good and is served in a restaurant here in Holland,MI. What you have to do is mix the softened butter and pumpkin together. Yes, it's curdled. Now put it in the microwave to soften the butter (this only takes a few seconds), and then take a fork and whip it. If the curdling is not gone after whipping, put it back in the microwave and whip again. Now, add your spices. Beat and then put in the frig to harden. You can always take it out to reach room temp if you prefer...and add ground pecans to it, too.More spices if you prefer.I used brown sugar instead of XXX sugar and only enough to lighly sweeten.

I didn't like the way this mixed up.  It didn't seem smooth enough.  It tasted okay, but the look and texture left a lot to be desired.

It's very bland as written. No flavour.  So, after tasting it I needed to  double the spices and I added 1 Tsp of pumpkin pie spice and also used 1/2 C. of sugar total.  It doesn't look very nice either.  The margarine separated and it gave a curdle look. Look at my pic as it's very noticable.  Apperance and taste is not very appetizing.

Tastey!  Used up some leftover canned pumpkin along with Country Crock margarine and it tasted yummy.  The only down side was that it does not look very appetizing, looks similar to hummus.  However, I will make this again to spread on toast and bagels !

The taste of this butter is okay but it does not look appetizing.  It seemed to curdle.  My coworkers wouldn't even try it due to the appearance.

I was disappointed by this recipe.  I was expecting a more flavourful and sweeter "honey butter" type spread but this didn't seem to have much of a taste at all unfortunately.

Simple to make, yummy on fresh bread or pumpkin muffins.  Could use some more spices.

This is really a great base recipe to build on. I used butter (not margarine)and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 3 oz of light cream cheese and a bit more powdered sugar to reach the consistency that I was after. It is a great spread to go over the cake based cinnamon roll recipe on this site(using the spice cake instead of the pound cake mix)

We are not big fans of margarine here. This separated and was just not very yummy. I think I'll stick to my own pumpkin honey butter recipe.

The pumpkin butter recipe was little trouble (since I have 1/4c of confectioner's sugar in the cupboard). I used packed yellow sugar, just a less. 
So the deal was "How do I use leftover baked pumpkin (which I puree-ed)? 
Nancy's Pumpkin Butter recipe could be a spread for baking, tart-filling, or as an appetizer served along side some crackers & head-cheese ball.

Maybe my next cooking will be making Pumpkin Crepes served with Nancy's Pumpkin Butter...
