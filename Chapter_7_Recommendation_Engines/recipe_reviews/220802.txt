To those who may think there is not enough banana in it, there is a simple solution. Add more banana. I had to say that because people complain about these sort of things a lot.

Like this recipe.  It has only a slight taste of banana.  The consitance was thin but after I had refidgerated it for a while it was fine.  The next time I make this I will whip the butter first before I had the banana and lemon juice.  Should mix better also if I can find some banana extra will add as well to bump up the banana taste.

Love this recipe. However I did add in some vanilla and an 8 ounce block of cream cheese to mine and it was amazing. Thank you for posting this.

I added extra banana and was careful when adding the other ingredients. Made a half recipe for banana bread. Made certain the butter was very soft, added banana alternating with sugar until I had the consistency I wanted. Doubled the lemon juice for tang. Added 0.5ml good quality vanilla. Outstanding frosting. My 17-yr-old was eating it directly from the bowl!

It was good but I would add a little more banana to bump up the flavor

I read people's reviews that the frosting was more of a glaze and had that experience myself. However, I just added an extra cup of powdered sugar, and it was great. It spread easily and set up nice and firm. I used it to frost a banana chocolate cake. I really struggle to understand people who say the frosting is too sweet. It's frosting. It's made of sugar. Of course it's sweet! If you want something that you can better control the sweetness, go with something cream cheese-based.

Mine never thickened up and was more like a glaze then frosting. Will try again and maybe not let me bananas get as ripe. The flavor was good though and everyone enjoyed what little did stay on the cupcakes.

Great recipe!  I did add some vanilla and 3 TBSP of cocoa powder and used less sugar (judging the consistency as I mixed it).

Perfect for the banana cake I’d made.  Didn’t need a full batch, but was easy to cut in half.  Loved it just as written!

Delicious! I made this with 2 cups of icing sugar instead of 3 1/2 since I didn't need that much.  Even at the reduced amount, I found that the recipe was still a bit too sweet for my personal preference, as when you eat it, the banana taste comes out and later fades so that the last flavor on your tongue is of the icing sugar, so I added some more banana and a splash of banana extract.  I'll definitely by using this recipe again!

Real easy and quick. I used two overly ripe bananas that were very sweet, followed recipe but added a dash of vanilla. I put it in the fridge before icing the cake so it could thicken a little. Was very good in a pinch and especially on my husband’s favorite strawberry cake.

My bananas weren’t quite ripe enough to produce that big banana flavor that I wanted, so I cheated and added 1 tsp. banana extract. Perfect! Thanks for sharing!

I thought that this recipe had a really good flavor, but it did not get thick.  I would recommend adding at least one teaspoon of cream of tartar to make it a frosting consistency, and,  I would add twice as much butter.  Overall, I think that this recipe is a good idea, but it could use some tweaking.

This was AMAZING! I put this on cake, but I now want to put it on cupcakes. Do you know how much it will use for cupcakes?

Followed directions to cream everything first, then add banana.  Tasty but stuff NEVER got thick.  I even chilled, frosted then chilled again... so sloppy.  Tasty, but too sloppy.  Maybe good for a filling?
