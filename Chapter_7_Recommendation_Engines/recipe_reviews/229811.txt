I like to roast the brussel sprouts instead of steam them (toss them with a little EVOO, salt/fresh ground pepper) for 25 minutes, cool and toss them with the italian dressing/hot sauce. This is also tasty when you toss in a little finely grated parmesan cheese.

Really good simple way to prepare Brussels sprouts, I have always microwaved my sprouts so that is how I cooked them.  I only added enough salad dressing to coat the sprouts and I found that was enough.  This is how I will be preparing Brussels sprouts from now on.

This is indeed very easy!!  But it isn't outstanding!  I might suggest trying a different marinade such as Greek Caesar.  Also, go heavy with the hot sauce, you can't really taste it if you follow the recipe.

I really hate Brussels sprouts in general.  I just hoped this recipe would make them tolerable.
