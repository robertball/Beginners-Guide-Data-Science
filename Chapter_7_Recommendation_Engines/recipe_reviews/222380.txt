Never would have thought to stir-fry tortellini...Glad I did! Left the sausage out and did just veggies, pineapple, and pasta. Delicious! Good alternative to a cream or tomato sauce.

My family loved it! I cut the veggies very tiny and cooked them a little longer so the kids would eat it.  Was crossing my fingers it would turn out good and was well pleased with the result, very interesting dish
