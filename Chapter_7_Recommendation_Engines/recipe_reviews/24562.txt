Perhaps the people that had problems with this and hated it, are inexperienced with baking or the traditional napoleon (mille-feuille).  It's not a highly flavourful dessert-it's puff pastry and cream!  Simple, and rich.  Most of the major grocery stores, here in Canada at least, sell frozen puff pastry in pre-rolled sheets (I like the President's choice pastry). Thaw, unroll and bake (probably at a higher temp than 350 degrees, but read your package!).  The pastry cream is simple to make, and very good.  I couldn't be bothered icing the sides, just iced the top.  I don't feel good about eating raw egg white, and didn't have any pasteurised whites, so mixed my icing sugar with milk instead-just enough to make it spreadable.  Instead of using artificial colour, I mixed in a bit of melted chocolate into the icing for my stripes instead (cocoa probably would have been the better way to go though, consistency wise).  Over all, a very good recipe.

OMG this recipe is soooo good!  I have made it now 3 times and now it is a favorite request from all of my family for our special gatherings.  Does require quite a large platter to assemble but the presentation is awesome when done right!

i hated this!  I expected so much more recipy . It was a mess...everything from the cream to the icing. what a waste of ingriedients! i will never make this again.It had no flavour and thats after i added extra sugar and vanilla. I left everything else excatly how the recipy asked for it and it is aweful.  if you are not experienced with puff pastry do not try this , find a differnt recipy and try it first.  i love baking and hate dissing others' recipies but this is the biggest dissapoitment EVER

Need to bake the pastry at 400 for 15 mins. For the icing, use about 1/2 the egg whites, mine was totally runny and spilled over the edges, what a mess.

I wanted to do the traditional recipe and this one fit the bill.  I like the flatter pastry and the icig to look like a real French Napoleon.  I think it worked ... you be the judge.  Good recipe with a few teaks.  :)

Very good. Apricot is traditional and ideal, but my mom puts up blackberry jelly every year so it's on hand and I used it. I "buttered" the top and bottom of the center pastry and very much liked the color contrast. Also used thin stripes of blackberry on the top. I served it cool, not cold, and it fit a summer dinner fine.

I made this for my daughter's Paris birthday party. It looked really beautiful but only a few of the kids actually liked it. I thought it was ok. I think it might have been better if the puff pastry was baked at a higher temp.
