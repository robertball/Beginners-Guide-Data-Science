Followed recipe exactly as directed. Super easy and super delicious! Used a 9x14 pan, spread out on the thinner side, but that's the way we like it. Very fudgey consistency. My hubby spreads a thin layer of peanut butter on it, yummy!!

These were delicious!  I have a very picky family and these were a hit. This recipe was so easy and I highly recommend using the exact coco powder he used. Made them even better!    I did add just a slight touch of Raw honey for a bit more sweetness.

A little disappointed because it did not stick together to form a bar, instead crumbled and fell apart. I guess I should have played around with the water/coffee a bit more. The recipe is pretty good, but is bitter as others mentioned. I ended up putting a layer of chocolate on top because adding agave did not help. Should taste good as granola/crumbles on yogurt, but overall was a bit disappointed in this recipe.

Fantastic and Whole30 approved bar. I rolled mine into balls and coated them with the extra shredded coconut. Ended up looking like truffles and tasting like an almond joy! Subbed 1/2 cup of roasted hazelnuts for 1/2 cup of the raw cashews. Takes longer than you think in the food processor. I though it wouldnt come together  but I just kept going (and added another tbs of coffee) and it formed a mass eventually.  Super tasty, cant recommend these enough.

Wow!  These are really good!  I've tried lots of energy bars and these are by far the best.  The taste a lot like RX Bars but they have more texture, which I really liked.  I think if  I had sprinkled some flaky salt on the top the would taste like salted caramel bars.  I did add a tablespoon of honey since they seemed a bit dry.  My only problem was my food processor is not big enough to make the whole recipe.  I used half the ingredients and made it twice.  I will absolutely make these again and again. Thanks so much Chef John

My husband was watching Chef John's YouTube channel and saw this one. He knew I would love them. He asked me to get the ingredients. I did and he made me a batch. Just wow. I can even say it backwards -- wow. Love these.  My guy even ordered up the expensive brand of chocolate Chef John recommends for future batches.

These bars are incredible! I will never buy pre-packaged again! 
 I did not have the dates so I used raisins and still just as moist and chewy. The natural sweet from the raisin, balanced with the bitter cocoa = fantastic!!! 
I also added peanut butter, pecans and chia seeds. Very happy with results. 
Thanks for the great recipe, Chef John!!!

These things are excellent!  I used Brazil nuts and Macadamia nuts instead of what the recipe called for.  Also added in half a cup of dried cherries.   Also used Cold Brew versus Espresso and didn't seem to phase how good it came out. Beyond Excellent stuff....more addictive than Oreos!!!

Thanks Chef John!!!

I make this often and give to friends as special treats. I don't make them in bars, rather, I make 1 Tbs balls. They hold together much better if you roll them in your hands and put them into the fridge to set.  I've made the recipe "as is" a lot and have never had a problem with them holding together.

Did the exact recipe minus the cayenne. They came out perfectly. I made a couple balls with swerve confections. It was like a truffle.  For anyone that states theirs crumbled, you need to keep adding just a couple drops of water at a time til it makes one big clump. Trust me it works. 

DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG THEY STAY GOOD IN THE FRIDGE!? Can I freeze them? 

Thanks.

This is a great recipe. I did make some changes due to what was in my pantry at the time. I had no flaked coconut, so that was omitted. I had no cashews, so I used pecans. It took about 2.5 tablespoons of espresso to gain the desired consistency. I did what another reviewer suggested, and formed the mixture into 24 balls. I will make again.

Wow! These are like the bars we buy (practically by the case) but much better!! They're a big hit in our family. We're cyclists and I usually take along the store-bought energy bars on rides but these will be going in my jersey pocket from now on - hopefully they won't get too soft to eat on a ride. They've got everything we need for energy in a healthy bar. I'll be trying different ingredients along with the dates but I can tell you these will probably be my favorite! Thank you Chef John!

Thank you, Chef John! I wish I could give you a big hug! I love date energy bars, especially to have around during labor and postpartum for much needed emergency snack that I can just grab and scarf, but they can be expensive. These were easy to make and delicious! Even my kids like them! I followed the recipe, using water instead of coffee, and just kept adding water until it stuck together when I squeezed it in my hand. Next time I will add dried cranberries.

Easy to make and they taste very good.  The only problem is that everyone likes them and they disappear from the fridge all too quickly.

These are a quick fix energy bar that does the trick. My husband took them on a trip to the boundary waters and said they were just what they needed for a healthy snack on the trails. I cut my bars 1"x2" rather than the 12 bars suggested by the recipe. I also wrapped them individually using saran wrap to keep them from sticking together.

Super easy and delicious! I added 1 tsp. of honey and used cold brew instead of espresso. I used a 9x13 pan and it gave just the right thickness. It turned out perfectly and I definitely plan on making it many more times.

These are delicious! If you find the mixture is crumbly, add more dates (not water/espresso). There needs to be 2 cups of packed dates to make it turn out right (seriously push as many as you can in that little cup!).

These were the ideal snack for a diabetic that wants something sweet. They are great. Save this recipe for sure. I left out the cocoa and it was great, anyway. Then wrapped them up individually and put in refrigerator.

I made these the other day. Mine did not get as gooey and the finished bars are very crumbly and don't hold together. I'm not sure why. Maybe didn't have enough dates, however I put them in a 2 cup measuring cup and filled it with the chopped dates. They do taste great though! I will try again, maybe adding more water and a few more dates.

Delicious!  Watching the video was helpful.  I ended up adding more coffee.  When I removed from the blender, some cocoa was not mixed so I worked it all together before spreading to the pan.  They were very moist and everyone loved them.

I substituted walnuts for the cashews and did not add the coconut ... neither cashews or coconut were not in my pantry. I also ground down the nuts in the food processor by themselves first to make it a finer consistency and added 3 Tablespoons of decaf espresso to get to the moist consistency as shown in Chef John's video. The flavor of these are amazing and will be great energy for workouts, bike rides and runs!

I didn't use Medjool dates, they were far too expensive so I substituted the cheaper regular dates and because they are drier than the Medjool dates I added more espresso. They taste amazing!

So delicious. I used Noor dates as that is what I had available. And I just blended the dates separately with a little bit of water and it seemed to work very well for me. Love these and have one every day!

Originally, I made these for the family and I used what I had in the house - pistachios, almonds and walnuts - instead of the cashews and shredded coconut. I also added a scoop of protein powder.

I'm on a restricted diet because I've type 2 diabetes so I tested my bsl before and after having a 1"×1" piece and was thrilled to find that it barely raised my sugar level. This is now my go to when I'm craving a little chocolatey sweet treat. 

Try freezing them. It brings out the chocolate more and they taste more fudge-y. Thank you so much Chef John!

My husband and I enjoy your videos. We love your sense of humor.

Withheld the cashews, added 1/4 cup of peanut butter, used a sugar-free mocha blend for the coffee for that extra chocolatey hint and wow this came out amazingly. It might not taste completely like a brownie, but it comes pretty darn close with a fudgey consistency and a dark chocolate flavor, these only lasted a couple days in the household! Makes for the perfect quick breakfast too.

These are fantastic and so good for you! No added sugar. I have made many times for my daughter's school snack. I pressed the bars into a 9x13 pan and cut into 40 square bars, 103 cal a piece. I have also used dutch cocoa and are great, and roasted unsalted cashews and almonds as well as peanutes bc that is what I had. Often will use 1 c each. Needed about 2-4 Tbsp espresso each time.

these are great for keeping you energized if you don't have time to eat a full meal during the day. I referee basketball on Saturdays so I'm  running around a gym for about 7 hrs and i don't have that much time to eat  between games so, I brought these with me and they worked out  great!!!! However, I don't  have a food processor so it took me a little bit longer to make. totally worth it though!!

Followed the recipe exactly. Used in a Vitamix as I do not own a food processor. Delicious, healthy and totally satisfies the occasional sugar craving. Gonna try a mixture of dried figs and dates next time.  Girlfirend loved it too and I scored some brownie points.....pun intended.
