Made this and OMG. I didn't have any mushrooms so I used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup instead. It is great.
I served it over egg noodles.  This is definitely a keeper. It is worth the wait.

Beef cheeks are a rare treat in our house. I usually follow a well tested beef and noodles recipe so I was a little nervous trying something new.  Glad that I took the chance because this was oh so good.   The only change was that I used fresh baby bella mushrooms, its all I had.  Will definitely use the dry porcinis next time as I think they will hold up better.  Thank you Robert for sharing!

Fantastic! I only used about 2 lbs of beef cheeks and didn't blend the braising liquid at the end; but otherwise I kept  everything else the same. It may take awhile to braise, but it really doesn't take much time to prepare. I could also see this being made into a slow cooker meal as well. The meat is fall apart tender and full of flavor. Great with polenta or garlic mashed potatoes!

I followed the recipe st I used 2 cups of cabernet. It was the most delish. A real meat and potatoes type of meal!
