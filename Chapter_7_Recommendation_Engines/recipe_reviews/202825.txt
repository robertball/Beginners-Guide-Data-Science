I made these for my kids using FF evaporated milk and half the sugar. Using the evaporated milk gave it the creaminess that I was looking for with half the fat of whole milk. Instead of molds, I poured the mixture into dixie cups and let the pops firm up a bit before I stuck in the popsicle sticks. Great to make overnight so it's ready to go during a hot day.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

These are fantastic!!! I made a few changes - 2% milk instead of whole, 4 tbsp flour instead of corn starch, and 2 tsp peppermint extract instead of vanilla. I added the chocolate chips (dark chocolate) when the pudding was still warm stirred them in while they melted as mentioned by other reviewers. These turned out creamy, smooth and addicting (made 11 - 1/4 cup pops that I made in 3oz dixie cups). I'm going to try cutting the sugar in half the next time and trying different extracts but I will NEVER buy fudge pops again!!!

**Update** 
I don't usually comment to this extent, but I just can't say enough... I've made these twice more cutting the sugar in half (still sweet enough) and adding 1 tsp almond extract to one batch and replacing 1 cup of the milk with coffee in the other. The almond one is tasty and satisfies the chocolate covered almond craving, and the coffee make a decadent cafe mocha fudge pop that I really just can't get enough of.... using coconut extract in the next batch and I can't wait!!

Wow, these have a wonderful taste! I'm always after sugar-free lo-cal treats, so I used splenda instead of sugar, 1% milk instead of whole, and light margarine instead of butter. The mixture didn't look chocolaty enough for me so I used 3 tablespoons cocoa instead of 2. Even skipping the chocolate chips, I thought the end result tasted creamy and decadent. I'm making a double batch next time!

YUM!  This recipe is a keeper!!  I only had 2% milk but the results were excellent.  After 20 minutes I added the chocolate chips as stated in the recipe.  I failed to make sure the mixture had cooled.  It didn't and the chips melted but I like it that way and probably won't wait the next time either.  Thank you ying for such a YUMMMY  recipe!

Even using 2% milk (with 1/4 c of powdered milk added), these were creamy and delicious. Plan on the pudding taking considerably longer than the suggested 20 minutes or so to cool enough to put the chocolate chips in. I put them in after it had cooled for an hour, and it was still warm enough to melt them. I would try stirring the pudding every 10 minutes or so during the cooling process to speed it up. They were quite sweet, so I might try cutting the sugar down next time. Using 5 oz dixie cups as molds and filling them 3/4 full, I was able to get 5 pops. The kids give these a 'million stars' rating and had fun helping make them.

These were delicious! After switching to a real food diet over 3 years ago, this is JUST what we needed to satiate Hubba's "need" for the store bought fudge pops!! We left out the choco chips (though he asked to try them the next time) & I used raw organic sugar. He said they may very well be the best fudge pops he's EVER had. High praise coming from a man that was a processed food "freak." Thank you!

These are really good. Make sure to use the whole milk called for in the recipe, skim milk makes them too icy. I love that these are gelatin-free. Thanks, Ying.

*Dairy-free version*  I couldn't make this as is, but I did make a variation as close as I could.  I used canned, full-fat coconut milk instead of the milk and omitted the butter completely.  The result was YUMMY.  I plan to make it again, and soon.  One important tip, though-- sift your cornstarch.  If you don't, you may end up (as I did) with weird globules in your fudge-sicle.  So good!!!

These were very good.  I made them with 2% milk, but I see from another review that I should have really used the whole milk; next time I will.

Totally hits the spot on a hot summer day. Made some adjustments: - used plain yogurt instead of butter and halved the sugar. Used coarsely chopped reese's cups instead of choc. chips. So good and yet, not as evil as a brownie or candy. mmmm. THANK YOU!

Delicious!  I used half the amount of sugar (1/4 cup) and it was plenty.  I added the chocolate chips while it was warm so they would melt (I didn't want chocolate chunks in it).  Everything else was the same and it was excellent.

I was so pleased with these pops! I made only a few minor changes. I replaced one cup of milk with one whole banana, omitted the cornstarch, and just threw everything (except the chips) in the blender, then added the chips and poured it into the popsicle mold instead of cooking it first. They turned out fabulous with excellent feedback from everyone I served them to. This recipe is definitely going into the family recipe book. Thank you for a great recipe!

These were awesome! I made a double recipe, my family loved them. With nine siblings and mom and dad, these hardly last for three days. I melted the chocolate chips, I thought it tasted better. Thanks for the great recipe Ying.

I have tried all kinds of frozen bars and did not really like them but THIS is the bar to try. It is really good.  I read the reviews first and did use 1/2 the sugar and it is plenty sweet. I used 2% milk and that was fine too. I did put the chips in while hot to melt them but try letting it cool just a little then put them in. I made a batch with 2 t. of almond extract and that was our favorite. Now I am on to the part coffee, part milk that another reviewer tried and liked. FYI, this is about 3 points for Weight Watchers.

So yummy! I made them almost exactly as directed and they were amazing. The only change I made was instead of chocolate chips, I cut up part of a dark chocolate bar. The chips all sank to the bottom so they are all on top of the pops. But I'm not complaining! If I make them again in my Zoku, I'll add the liquid ingredients in steps so that I can layer the chocolate pieces.

Lightened the ingredients by using Splenda, skim milk, and margarine as another reviewer mentioned.  The taste was OK on this, but the texture was very, very icy as opposed to creamy.

These were quite good.  I used silicone cupcake liners, which are heat proof, so I was able to freeze immediately.  An ice cream scoop makes filling cupcake liners fast. I stood them in a cupcake pan, and when frozen dropped them in a plastic bag.  I didn't have sticks.  To eat them, we turned them out of the silicone and then used it to hold them.  The milk may be preheated in the microwave to speed things up.

Fabulous treat!  I doubled the cocoa and used organic raw cacao powder. I cut the sugar a little bit and used So Delicious cultured coconut milk in place of the whole milk. Skipped the butter do but did not skip thr chocolate chips!  Loved using a hefty quantity of Nestles Mini Chocolate chips. These Popsicles are better than the original Fudgicles!

I probably won't make these again.  The taste just didn't suit me and the pops turned out more icy than expected.  Worth the try though.

Really good!  Made as stated and didn't need to make any changes.  It really doesn't need any extra chocolate either.  We added chocolate chips, but the pops would have been great without them.  We used the Dixie cup idea as well.

What's not to like about this one.  Frozen pudding is always good.  Kick it up a notch by using peanut butter chips in place of the chocolate.

It was okay, but the mixture wasn't enough for even 4 pops, let alone 8. You'd have to double the recipe.  it was like eating chocolate flavored ice with chocolate chips.

I liked it it was hard for me to make without proper moulds but that’s on me the chocolate chips will always be at the bottom. It’s basically just frozen chocolate milk

These turned out so yummy! Chocolate-y, creamy, and delicious! I’m sharing this recipe with everyone! I didn’t make any substitutions and just made it as is. I used 25¢ molds from wal-mart and it wasn’t easy to get them out but that’s not the recipe. ?? I don’t need to look any further for a recipe!

These were pretty good!  I halved the sugar, but definitely like my pops a bit sweeter so next time I might add a few packets of Stevia. I also used 1% milk.  Thanks for the recipe.  Look forward to making these again!

I really really liked it! But instead of making it thick I used my Cuisinart Smart Stick to mix for one minute and when I tasted it it tasted the same as when you mix it for two minutes, so if you have a Cuisinart Smart Stick, use it.  I have to say, it tasted really good and pleased my siblings.  If there were more than five stars on this I'd give this a whole lot more.  I really hope whoever wants this really likes it!!!!!

We purchased an Onyx 6 popsicle mould set a few weeks ago, and this was our first recipe. 

It was not hard to make, and in the end it came out perfectly frozen. The posicles tasted amazing, and we thought they were quite substantial because of the milk. 

One suggestion, instead of chilling the mixture all the way before putting in the chocolate chips, let the chips melt a little in the semi-cooled solution. Also, we used a little less sugar than what was called for and 2% milk. But they probably taste even better with the full amount of sugar and whole milk, but going healthy doesn't diminish the recipe at all.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the recipe exactly, loved the flavor but it was more on the icy side, the second time I took other reviewers suggestions and substituted evaporated milk and this was the creamy texture I was looking for. Both was are excellent it is just a matter of preference.

Inititally, I intended to make this as written although sugar and carb free however, I did make a couple changes and decided to leave it as pudding.  Instead of cornstarch I used low carb flour called Carbalose and 4 tablespoons.  The cocoa replacement was Hershey's unsweetened and replaced the sugar with Splenda increasing it by half.  For the chocolate chips, I used Lily's stevia sweetened baking chips and heavy cream with 1/2 cup of Half and Half for the milk.  I was still going to freeze it but after cooking the consistency was such a lovely pudding that I just put it in the fridge.  I did add the butter and chips while it was still warm which makes it more like a ganache.  Also, used a whisk while simmering to break up the cocoa and flour.  Super yummy and perfect for that chocolate fix.

Enjoyed this!  I used Splenda and 2% milk and it turned out really good.  I wanted to use  dark chocolate chips but couldn't find them in the mini size, so used regular sized ones.  I let the mixture cool on the stove and just stirred it now and then until it was cool enough to add the chips.  Next time I'll add them sooner so the melt into the mixture since they were kind of big.

This was over-the-top great! Fudgy rich and creamy and decadent, all rolled into one. I don't use milk, but I did have 2 cups of coconut milk creamer on hand, and I added 1/2 cup water to make it 2.5 cups. Next time I'm going to play with a coconut milk creamer/coconut milk beverage mix to get the calories down a bit, but keep the creaminess. I used 1/4 cup Truvia baking blend sugar, but I think I'll cut that in half next time. I used 2 heaping tablespoons of raw cacao. And I always double/triple vanilla extract in any recipe. I had some no-sugar choc chips on hand that I bought from Whole Foods last summer. I might even eliminate those altogether, as it was super chocolaty. And I LOVE chocolate. The batch made 6 pops with my molds. I calculated the calories with what ingredients I used at 128 calories. I can get it down to about 75-80 calories without affecting the awesomeness that it is. I warmed the mold up a bit in my hands for about 30 seconds, and the popsicle slid right out, no issues. I can't get over how great these are. I love that I don't have to use a pudding mix. My hubby is going to flip over it when he tries one tonight. From now on, double-batch for sure. Once I get the recipe just right, I'll play with different flavorings, like others have suggested. This is a keeper that you can easily lighten up.

I love these BUT the times listed are so wrong!  It takes more at least 15 minutes for the mixture to start to thicken.   when I double the batch(which is always) it takes closer to 25 minutes.  The cooling time is closer to 40 minutes for one batch and 60 minutes for a double batch.

These are really delicious and a great hot weather treat. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and that gave this recipe a real deep chocolaty flavor. We drink 1% milk, but I had some heavy cream on hand and added 1/2 cup of cream to two cups of milk. I put them in ramekins because we didn't have an acceptable mold or the sticks. We dug it out with spoons and it worked okay, but I have the appropriate mold on the grocery list.
