Okay....I've been choosing and cooking some really great recipes from allrecipes.com for a couple of years now, but have never reviewed one.  However, this recipe is one of the most fantastic yet and deserves all 5 stars.  Changes... used fresh corn scraped off the cob in dish, 1/4 cup water, cover, and steam in microwave.  (still used 1 can cream corn)  Also added 1 pint of heavy cream, left out the creole seasoning, added 1 1/2 capfuls of liquid crab boil.  Got an "OH MY GOSH, MOM, FORGET THE GUMBO, YOU'LL BE COOKING THIS ALL THE TIME" FROM MY 2 DAUGTHERS.  ENJOY!!!!

We are from New Orleans and usually have corn and crab, but my mother is allergic to crabs and the crawfish worked out well. We used cream of mushroom instead of potato, and corn that has been removed from the cob - with the corn milk. Extra seasoning was a MUST. A spoon of liquid Crab Boil makes it really New Orleans! If your grocery doesn't have it, try www.zatarain.com for many authentic treats & tastes of New Orleans.

I am from South Louisiana and have just recently ate this dish for the very first time at a restaurant. I absolutely loved it and wanted to learn how to make it. I just made it and all I did different was added a ton more seasoning. Next time I will also remember to buy unsweetened corn. I had to add alot of salt because the corn was really sweet. Other than that my fiance loved it and so did I.

My mother-in-law and husband loved it. I made one addition though. We had potatoes left over from the crawfish boil so I cut those and added them to the pot. This was perfect for the leftover crawfish!

We loved this soup!  I used the crawfish from our boil that I had frozen and it was perfect!  It added another layer of flavor.  I used regular corn without added sugar and semi pureed it instead of the cream style corn.  As suggested, I added a couple of caps of Zatarain's liquid boil and it was fabulous. I think I will try this with shrimp.

Great recipe! I am born and raised in south Louisiana and I have never eaten corn and crawfish soup but I am trying to instill our heritage in my kids and trying to cook more authentic Cajun food...My husband who isn't from here absolutely loved it and the kids did too.. This one will go in my personal recipe collection! Thanks for sharing this!

Thank you for having this recipe up.  An old friend of ours used to make this all the time.  I got the recipe from her but she left some things out for instance how long to cook and which recipe goes in first, she used to do it in her head.  It's a great way to impress for company. Delicious! Recommend it highly.

I went to a crawfish boil last night and came home with lots of leftovers. I'm from Texas and I've never cooked with crawfish before. This recipe was so much more delicious than I could have hoped for. I added more creole and pepper sauce to kick it up a notch. This will be a staple when I have crawfish available. Thank you for a savory evening!

This recipe is the BEST!  I used to work at a restaurant that served Crawfish Corn Soup and it was one of my favorites.  I started to crave it one day and so decided to look up a recipe and make it myself.  This recipe turned out better than the restaurants!  I changed nothing, made it just like it says and everyone loved it, my step-dad especially...and he never likes anything! haha  Definatly a recipe to try if you like crawfish and corn :)

Made this last night!  Took the suggestion of one reviewer and added a small chopped red potato.  (Don't add the potato too early or it will turn to mush) This was delicious!!  My mom enjoyed it too.

I'm live in New Orleans and love this recipe. Instead of pepper sauce i use a dash of crab boil, adds that special flavor and spice to it. I also saute the crawfish in butter before hand to give it some flavor. Great recipe, we love it!

This is native Louisiana girl LOVES this recipe.  So does my family, who i tried this out on.  Make it as written, but add 1.5 capfulls of zataran's concentrated liquid crab boil.  Also its better when made with golden corn, not sweet corn.  YUM!

This is absolutely the best soup I have ever eaten!!!  I love this soup and find that it has the perfect combination of textures and flavors.  I do increase the amount of Creole seasoning and hot sauce to give it extra kick, and a little more worshester sauce.  I also used fresh corn from 3 cobs.  Perfect, Perfect, Perfect!!!!

Very good, I did add a few things, Bay leaf, sautéed garlic, heavy cream, blue cheese crumbles, Honey roasted corn, Gulf caught shrimp. The soup is perfect as is, as a chef I just had to make it my own. LucyF... this is a really good recipe.

I am the original poster of this recipe. You HAVE to add Tony Chacheres  or Zatarains creole seasoning to your taste, this seasoning really makes a difference. If you don't want it as sweet, omit one of the cans of cream corn. 
I always get rave reviews on this one :-)

This recipe is awesome. After a crawfish boil this weekend my boyfriend wanted a stew but i wanted something different so I made his stew and I also tried this. It was amazing! I did not add any seasoning because my crawfish were already highly seasoned and it was just perfect. My boyfriend works nights and he just texted saying how it tasted so good its better than restaurant quality! I will make this again and it was so easy to make. I had some half and half and some pet milk so I used that in the place of milk. I brought some for lunch and cant wait til 12 oclock gets here!

This almost exactly like a recipe I have been making for years, only my recipe calls for shrimp. I used leftover crawfish from a boil & after shucking all them myself, I vowed that I have eaten my last crawdad. ;o) The soup was really good though I added a cap of of Zatarain's seafood boil instead of teh hot sauce. Thansk for a tasty recipe for my leftover crawdads lfreytag...it was really good!

I followed the instructions and it was good. I too would prefer if it wasn't so sweet. Maybe I'd look for creamed corn with no sugar added.

This was delicious! I used Zataran's liquid crab boil in boiling the crawfish. I also used frozen instead of canned corn and cream-style corn, and 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream. Finally, I doubled the Creole seasoning and Worcestershire sauce. None of these modifications were my ideas - all suggestions by other reviewers. Great recipe and will make again.

Excellent, made as per recipe and everyone liked it. Next time will double crawfish and cream of potato soup to make it more chowder like vs a good soup.

I recently made this for a wake.  The family loved it so much they even called the next night to ask for the recipe.  This was also perfect for a Mardi Gras party.  A friend said they had bought it at a restaurant for about $25 a gallon, but that mine was more flavorful! (and less expensive!)
