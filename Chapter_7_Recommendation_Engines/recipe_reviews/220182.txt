My husband never likes my sloppy joes.  We had his family over and I agreed to make sloppy joes.  I panicked knowing mine were not up to par so I typed into my iPad and picked this recipe. As everyone was ranting and raving about the sloppy joes my husband leaned over and said these are the best sloppy joes you have ever made. My I have another one?  We have been married for 43 years and I finally found the. Best sloppy joe recipe.  Thank You!

I have never been a fan of Sloppy Joes made from canned Manwich.  But this recipe was great, the whole family liked it.  I didn’t have brown sugar so used a little maple syrup. Sometimes you have to improvise and that’s ok.

Once again, Chef John, "Thank you" seems so inadequate.  Made this for dinner last night and there was happy silence from my husband's corner as he finished his portion and then not-so-silent (but relatively subdued lest he resemble Bambi in the headlights before running away) ecstatic chatter from mine, when he got up for seconds.  Normally, when I make sloppy joes, there is the animated discussion about how ketchup should be used only as a condiment on the side to adorn hot dogs, hamburgers, the occasional french fry, but it should never -- and he repeats never -- be used as an ingredient.  There was none of that with this meal :) -- not even the suspicious, "Did you put ketchup in this?" or the disappointed, "Honey, you Know I'm not a big sweet-and-sour fan".  A note to those reviewers who thought this was too "sloppy", I would say make this again and be more patient next time -- the liquid does evaporate eventually.  The flavour is superb that it is well worth the wait.   So .. Thanks again!  I have myself a new sloppy joe recipe!

Too sweet for my liking...I had to add more worcestire and a bunch of hot sauce to tone down the sweetness. Good for a starter recipe.

I made this into a sloppy joe pizza! Followed the recipe almost exactly (didn't have peppers in the house and I added a bit of red pepper flakes), made a homemade pizza dough and used the sloppy joe mix as the sauce and covered with sharp cheddar.  Delicious and very filling!

Boy does this recipe bring back memories! I haven't had sloppy joes since I was a kid. Definitely a "retro" kinda meal that dare I say...tastes better than my Mom's! This was so easy and so good - perfect for Sunday football. I doubled the recipe using 96/4 ground beef, one red pepper and one green pepper, half ketchup and half Bennetts Original Chili Sauce along with a generous splash of white wine vinegar, and brown sugar to taste along with the rest of the ingredients. I highly recommend watching Chef John's video. It's only a few minutes long and was very helpful. You really do need to add the water and let it simmer down for at least 30 minutes - and don't be afraid to add the cayenne it really does make a difference but doesn't make it "hot". All I did was keep it warm in a crock pot during the game. I served these on slider rolls with chips and pickles to rave reveiws. Thanks Chef John for another awesome recipe!

This is a great recipe! I especially like the fact that it includes mustard, which is left out of many recipes.  You don't taste mustard, but it adds something that you really miss if it isn't there.  If you don't have Dijon mustard, using whatever kind of mustard you have would be better than no mustard. I left out the black pepper, because I'm allergic to it.

WOW!  Gotta say I was skeptical but my husband says I need to be open minded; so glad I was.  We are both on a diet so the salt concerned me therefore I omitted it and hoped for the best.  I also chose regular mustard as it has less fat, sugar, sodium & carbs (again for our diet.)  As I was making it our 11 month old twins decided they were hungry too so after step 1 I threw everything in the pan and tended to them stiring every few minutes.  I gotta say after an hour or so it was so delicious.  I only had a pound of meat but it made about 8 small "diet" appropriate portions for us.  Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Hello!
First of all, allow me to explain a few things. I'm twenty-one, I work part time and I attend college full time. I'm involved in multiple clubs and societies at school, and I happen to be engaged. I hope to give you context when I say that I am not always bountiful in time. I love this recipe, I make it every month or so for my fiance, my roommate and me. It feeds us for approximately 4-5 days of heavy eating, they're two guys and well.. you know how they eat. 

Now, I don't follow the recipe exactly but I do use its basic bones:
- I mix a pound of lean ground beef with a pound of lean ground turkey. 
- I add a can and a half of Bush's Original Baked Beans (my father used to add beans to sloppy joes)
- I add a whole onion, a whole green bell pepper, and a whole red bell pepper. 
- I also add sriracha and some red pepper flakes.

This being said, I let it simmer for roughly an hour. It's brilliant and perfect consistency, definitely flavourful and not the worst thing you can put in your mouth. Also, really nice for a couple of low-budget college couple and their silly roommate.

Did not care for this. I think I would use regular mustard and cut the brown sugar by 2/3rds.

These Sloppy Joe's are SO good!  I followed the recipe exactly and the whole family loved them.  These are so easy to make there's no reason to buy canned sauce!
Note: if you have picky eaters, you might consider dicing to pepper very fine to 'hide' them.  Thanks, Chef John, and as always we enjoyed your recipe!

Not better, not worse, just different ? I think this dish has a lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll will be make it again. Before attempting this again, I'll have to figure out what seasonings to use, by reading all of the review, and see that will work for others, and than for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes here. It's O.K. but better the next day after the flavors have blended. I can't do the happy food dance!! On this as it is. sorry!! 2-3 Stars

It hurts my ego to hear that Manwhich is a recipe that could be considered retro. 

I love this recipe. I followed the recipe as written. And my husband drizzled some Sriacha on his meat. I'll try that next time.  

it isn't a quick meal but it is worth it. I cooked it the night before I wanted to serve for dinner. I broke apart and fluffed up the meat and warmed it in the microwave.

Yuck. Way too much catsup and way too much sugar. It's been over 40 minutes and I had to turn the heat to medium, and it's still too soupy. I'm a good cook and I will not try any more of his recipes. I've disliked every one I've tried.

I put less water just 1/2 cup. Instead of just Ketchup I put 3/4 of BBQ Sauce and 1/4 of Ketchup, and add more veggies like fresh tomatoes, Yellow, green and red bell peppers and Cayenne pepper (it brings more flavor to the dish) and just 1 tablespoon of brown sugar (2 is too sweet for me). Really really good recipe! Love it!

I love this recipe. I scale it to use 1 lb. of ground beef, and cut the brown sugar to just about a teaspoon. I also like my joes pretty sloppy, so I cook the mixture, partially covered, for about 30 minutes instead of the full cook time. I served these on Pumpkin Sandwich Rolls with jack-o'-lantern faces for a great Halloween-themed dinner!

My recommendation is follow the recipe exactly and you can't fail. There is only two of us so we make the whole batch and freeze it portioned for two in freezer bags for last minute meals.

This is a great base recipe for a standard sloppy joe. I used onion powder, sweet red pepper, and a good pinch of cayenne powder. I used a mix of white sugar and molasses for the brown sugar and doubled the worcestershire. I didn't use all the water called for it seemed way too much for it just to cook back out again. Instead of salt I used a bit of chicken bouillion granules. This took a little over an hour to simmer down to nearly dry. This was just standard sloppy joe, not tangy enough for me though and I like it kicked up a bit so it was kind of boring for me as it is. (I love Ruby Drive or Dallas Style) So... overall not my favorite from here, but pretty darned good, Thanks Chef John.

Delicious recipe! I tend to cook 3 to 5 lbs of ground beef at a time with puréed onion, garlic, and tomato and then use in different recipes during the week to cut down on cooking time. I mixed the sauce ingredients with 1 cup of water and a dash of paprika instead of cayenne pepper and 1 tbs of dried mustard (was out of Dijon) and simmered until beginning to thicken. I then added precooked ground beef and simmered until thick. Turned out with a lot more flavor than the canned sloppy joe sauce!

I made this recipe for 60 people using the adjusting app.  I added two pounds of carrots, shredded, only 1 cup of water, and a little cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  There has to be a misprint in the water amount as it would add up to 20 glasses of water.  Also increased meat to 16 lbs.  Made it in a roaster the day before and refrigerated it overnight - then put roaster on 200 until heated up, removed cover and heated it on 250 - which cooked off some liquid.  Everyone kept saying it was the best sloppy joes they'd had.  They could pick up the sandwiches which was nice.

Very Good Recipe.. I would cut down the brown sugar butter 2t. - 1 T. Up the Worcestershire sauce a bit to equal 1 T.  (I use LOW sodium  Worcester ) At first I thought the amount of water was too much, but then I  realized Chef John may be trying to go for more of a bolognese style ( cooking down the water over time developed more depth of flavor).Howerever to achieve that I would cook it down a little longer.  If you do not plan on using  AT LEAST  all the cooking time indicated then definitely decrease the water.  Also I  would actually use no sodium beef stock or broth instead of water for a bit more flavor.
..I preferred using yellow mustard over dijion for this recipe. I do use dijon in other recipes, but in this one it is just a tad sweet for my taste.
BTW if you have leftovers try stuffing this mixture in  jalapeños or pablano or in large portabellas & top with cheese and warm up in the oven..yum

I really like this! I used butterball ground turkey and it was perfect, I like a thicker sauce so I added a little less of each wet ingredient.  My family ate this up! Will add to the menu for sure!

I don't like sloppy joes but my girlfriend does so I made this recipe for dinner tonight. I was pleasantly surprised by how good they tasted, then again I've only had cafeteria sloppies so never really had a good experience anyway.  Gf said she's never had onions and peppers in it but that she liked them as an addition. I don't like onions or bell peppers either but they actually weren't too bad mixed with the meat texture, tender and could hardly tell they were in there. I added a pinch of garlic powder, cayenne, onion powder and some chili powder while browning the meat, btw. I'm not sure if it did anything different, as I've never made this recipe before. Split the recipe basically in half (1/2 lb of meat) for 2 sizeable sammies. Verrry  sloppy because of all the moisture (was difficult to stay in burger every bite) but I guess that's where it gets the name.

Overall, I thought it was average.  It was a little too sweet.  Next time I would cut back on the brown sugar.  Not the best, but not the worst either.

2 tablespoons of brown sugar is way too much! I had to add additional 4 tablespoons of vinegar to try to compensate. And even then it was too sweet. If using ketchup there's plenty of sugar in that, I might try this recipe again but not add the sugar. Also be aware that the simmering time is not long enough to thicken the sloppy joe mix. It took 1 hr and 15 minutes for mine to thicken. I would recommend reducing the amount of water.

I've searched off an on over the past 20 or so years for that perfect sloppy joe recipe and this is it. Followed the recipe, except I added some smoked paprika to the mixture. If my son goes back for seconds, it's usually a keeper.  Thanks Chef John!

Could we eat it? Yes. Did we like it? No. I love Chef John's recipes, but this was a miss for us. This was way too sweet and we tried adding more mustard and even a little lemon and cider vinegar to counter the sweetness, which helped ever so slightly. To no avail, still too sweet. Will try a different recipe or go back to one we've made before.

This was quite good, but after reading the ingredients I knew I would make some changes.  I added more Worcester than just a dash,  more onion and substituted black pepper for spicy pepper medley.  I didn't add any salt and thought it was just right .  11/2 tsps of salt is way to salty.  I added the brown sugar but thought it was to sweet so will leave it out next time.  I also added chilli flakes instead of cayenne and cut the ketchup to 1/2.cup and added a little taco seasoning.  I liked the results and enjoyed it on a toasted burger bun.

I've been making this Sloppy Joe recipe for my family for years. It is definitely the best! All the flavors come together perfectly! It's hard not to want a second helping! After eating this, my family would never eat Sloppy Joe out of a can. In fact I'm not even sure they know such a thing exists.

Excellent decision making this homemade Sloppy Joe  recipe! Bye bye package mix! This was really good. So good, I made it twice in one week! Easy, quick, and just wait a little to let recipe simmer and cook off extra liquid. I only used 1 lb ground beef and 1 cup water.  with only the pound that I had, it made a full eight count of sloppy Joe's.   Great recipe and thank you for sharing!

As a vegetarian, I used Beyond Meat Fiesty Crumbles.  Didn't have any brown sugar so I used molasses.  I didn't add the second cup of water and didn't simmer for 40 minutes because the faux meat would have fallen apart.  Very very good.  Tastes just like I remember Sloppy Joes from my childhood.

Family loved these, this recipe is  going on my meal list. I followed the recipe and didn't have any problem with the amount of water as some reviewers mentioned. Don't try to rush the cooking time. My dad had seconds and raved, this is unusual for him.

Super delicious! I omitted the green bell peppers, because my husband doesn't like them. I was a little sketched out about the amount of water to put in. Don't skimp on the water! After simmering for about 40 minutes on the stove all of the water was gone. What was left was packed full of flavor Sloppy Joes! It was a little on the sweet side for my taste. I might omit a little bit of the brown sugar next time. However, my husband LOVED this as is!

Don't gimme no balogna... and don't gimme no manwich!  Excellent recipe, only thing i changed was a little more worcheshire and skipped the 2nd cup of water.  I also used Ballpark mustard (Bertman's, best in the country!) instead of the dijon.

One of my weekly go to recipes! We love this. I buy firmer rolls from the bakery as they hold up better. Even as a drier meatier sloppy Joe, this still is juicy.

I added 1 1/2  cups of water instead of the 2 cups, just because I liked the thickness. The flavors were outstanding. Better than store bought, without the chemicals. I can even imagine "fixing" this recipe up. Add black beans or corn and black olives...

This is THE best Sloppy Joe recipe  that I have ever made! I'd say I was  fortunate when I came across this one when I lost my usual recipe. My husband and son absolutely loved it!  I will most definitely be making it again. The only changes I made was that I used  less salt and  a bit less green pepper, a little more Worcestershire sauce and cut the amount of water down a tad. Thank you Chef John :)

If you love SWEET sloppy Joes this is for you. If you  like more of a tange, you will not like this one. I even added apple cider vinegar that someone else suggested, didn't work. I added more mustard. Nope. I also let mine simmer twice as long as called for and it was still watery.

This is now a family favorite.  The bell peppers are the key, I add more than the recipe calls.  I ran out of brown sugar last night and used homemade applesauce instead, that just added an even better level of flavor!!  Thanks,

My husband is on a low cholesterol diet so made with ground turkey. I also added a little jalapeño and a dash of A1 sauce. Made into sloppy pies using Grands bisquits. Super yummy!!! Mahalo for the recipe!!

These are great.  We added extra ketchup and mustard.  Added some sriracha for a little kick at the end.  Easy recipe to adjust to your tastes!  Thanks.

My family was VERY happy with this. I followed the recipe but didn't have enough kethup so I added 8oz tomato sauce. There was a little more brown sugar than I'd like because more fell out of the bag than I was expecting but the family didn't mind at all. I actually had to note that with manwich there's always some left with 2 darn buns left. All buns and Joe were gone :)

I used Vegetarian Ground Soy and followed the rest of the recipe "as is" and the whole family LOVED it!  We won't be using the packaged stuff or canned stuff ever again.  Very yummy indeed.

We love this sandwich! I drained most of the fat, reduced the brown sugar by half, added 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, and a tad more salt. YUM!

Very good, will definitely make this again.  The only suggestion I have is to use less brown sugar if using red bell peppers in place of green ones.  Otherwise was quick and easy to through together and tasted great!

A recipe to please the whole family!  The kids have requested this over and over.  The first time I made it, I didn't change a thing and it was delicious but just a little too sweet for me.  The second time, I added a little more Worcestershire and dijon.  Now I always make it that way, but that's really just a matter of personal preference.

This recipe was delicious:)  Instead of two cups of water, I added tomato paste to one of the cups of water.  I also splashed it up with cider vinegar and added a teaspoon of cayenne:)

This is a delicious homemade recipe for an All-American favorite... I didn't really measure (shame on me...) but used each of the ingredients here, including the cayenne.  It came out like a sweet hot mixture and we loved it.  Lots of sugar between the ketchup and brown sugar, however.  I only added water the first time cooked it down real good and then while that was cooking down, I made my sloppy mix and kept taste testing for a good 45mins, adding this and that.  Mixed it into the meat in the skillet and let it all cook down more, for 30mins.  Very yummy with the cayenne... We like a good kick to our dishes.  :o)

Tried this last night - everyone loved it!  Some said that it was even better than Manwich!!!  Doubled the recipe because we had extended family over.  Followed it pretty much as listed, with the exception of water, only used 2 cups even though doubled would have been 4!  It cooked down perfectly!  Added a little extra Worcestershire sauce and used brown mustard instead of Dijon. Very tasty!!!  Thanks!!

Very easy to make and my son loved it!!! I added mushrooms and I used 70/30 lean meat instead of the extra lean. I didn't add the extra cup of water at the end it was already a bit liquidy from the first cup. but it came out great!!

I made this just tonight and my whole family loved it.  I only had regular mustard so I used that and didn't need the brown sugar (as my family doesn't love sweet tasting savory meals and ketchup is plenty sweet).  I thought it was awesome!

I doubled the garlic, as I do with most recipes.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. It turned out fantastic! My husband and I loved them. This will definitely be made again and recommended to others.

My husband is a tried & true Manwich sloppy joe fan  but I am not!  So I was searching for a recipe & found this one.  We both absolutely love it.  I will not make anyother kind now that we've discovered this one!!!  The only thing that I did differently was to add 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and then 3/4 cup water.  Delicious!!!

A bit sweet, it can do without the sugar. I omitted the green peppers as the kids don't like them - overall it was good. The kids really liked it - the litte one ate 2 sandwiches!

I've been using this recipe for years and my whole family loves it...from my 9 year old daughter to my 33 year old son, it's a favorite for everyone!   I follow the recipe exactly and it's a hit  every time.  Make sure you simmer it until the consistency is right, it's worth the wait!

I’ve made this twice now- exactly as written and we LOVE it. To make it lower carb, I’m serving it over spaghetti squash instead of on a bun. This will be added to our menu regularly.

Recipe is good as is, thought can be very sweet depending on the katsup you use. Still 5* as it is. 

I reduced katsup and substituted some tomato paste, used half the sugar and double the mustard.

Pregnant and craving sloppy joes, and this recipe NAILED it! Thank you! I didn't have Worchestershire sauce on hand, but it was still yummy without it. I'm sure with the sauce it would be even better.

I had everything except the green pepper so I substituted with hot pepper sauce. Delicious! Hubby’s taste buds change daily and he liked it 3 days in a row. That never happens. The consistency is perfect for eating on a bun. Thanks.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too sweet and watery. The second time I made it, I cut the sugar by half, omitted the water, threw in a table spoon of white vinegar to give it some zing, and added a little extra Dijon and Worcestershire. So much better, and my kids and their friends gobbled it all down. Good for a starter recipe.

This is the only sloppy joe recipe I will ever make again. We used grass fed beef in a 1 lb. package. We did not have green peppers and it was still delicious. We served it in a top split hotdog bun. So yummy! A total do over!

Great recipe. The only thing I’d change is that 1 cup of water is too much. I had to let a lot of it boil out because it was so watery.

Made it as is last night and everyone loved it.  I was skeptical about using ketchup, but it was actually really good.  I may cut back the brown sugar to 1 tbl next time because I found it a bit sweet.  It's definitely much better than the canned stuff.

The flavor of this Sloppy Joes takes you back to the cafeteria at school!  So delicious!!  And  I made it  EXACTLY as recipe stars.  The sprinkle of cayenne pepper at the end is a must!!  Don’t be intimidated by the amount of water added.   It cooks off nicely and makes for an amazing sauce!

Best ever home made sloppy joes! I did make it again and again, now on my menu. I do make a variation, using Gardein crumbles for ground beef, it is really good and the flavor is better plus it is not as much work, you don't have to worry about pouring off the grease.

Made this for my family, they loved it.  I saute my onions and bell pepper first, then the beef and added them together.  We like our veggies very tender.  Changed the method but kept the ingredients the same, adding a little cayenne  and dijon to offset the sweet.  Lots of pickles and big buns.  It's easy and so much more flavor than canned.  We will do this again.  Thanks!

Outstandingly delicious as is but as a Carbless Home we modified a couple things.
Instead of Brown Sugar I use half the amount in Molasses.   I use yellow and orange peppers instead of green.
We also top roasted spaghetti squash with Joe mixture. 
PS: it's great over scrambled eggs in the morning.

I like this recipe with the peppers & onions and would make it again.   At first I thought it was too sweet, but after adding the water and 1/2 can of tomato paste this evened the flavors out.  I eyeballed how much water to add.  I recommend NOT to add a full cup at first.  You can always add more if you need it later, but if you add too much that's when you'll have a soupy 
Sloppy Joe.  Have fun with this recipe.

A BIG 5 with my changes.  I'm out of ketchup so I used a small can  of tomato paste.  plus  2 TBSP of apple cider vinegar,  tsp of dry mustard (plus the Dijon), pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Test for salt and pepper.  Ketchup has lots of sugar, so maybe using the paste cut some of the sweet and also worked to thicken it up.  I used the 2 TBSP of brown sugar, 2 cups of water and allowed the full 40 min. to simmer low.  wow.  sooo good !

This has become a staple at my house. It is so good! You can make little changes to make it your own. I chopped pickled jalapeño and threw some in one time, that was extra spicy and delicious. A little tiny bit of vinegar makes it more tangy. More sugar for more sweet. Chef John’s recipes are always amazing and this is no exception, you’ll never make canned again.

I made this last night and honestly it was delicious! I did end up adding in some extra spices (garlic salt, paprika, onion powder) and I cut the sugar in half since I generally don't like sweet foods and the ketchup had me worried. I also didn't use both cups of water, I didn't end up needing it. I will definitely make this again ^^

The taste is ok. adding the second cup of water added almost an hour and 15 minutes to the cooking time though. I like the recipe, though it isn't what I was looking for.

Yes I Used’s A1 sauce instead of  Worcestershire only because I didn’t have any. Also I used an orange pepper instead of green.

I found it too sweet. So I added 2 tablespoon s of vinegar and half of tomato paste. I will do half of sugar only next time. My grandkids lived it!

My family really loves this meal. It's great because it tastes better than the canned version, and it has none of the chemical  found in the big brands.  You can control the quality of your ingredients.

The  only change I make is the bun. I use the Hawaiian buns.

Thank  you for the simple way to make classic sloppy joes.  I liked them BUT a little too sweet for me.  I will decrease the sugar next time to one T.  I only used 1 cup of water.  I've been looking for a recipe that reminded me of my childhood.  Thanks  Chef John

Best Sloppy Joes I've had. Absolutely the best! The only change I made was I used 1 lb of ground meat instead of 1 1/2. I only had a pound. Maybe it made a little extra sauce as a result, but that was fine. This is a keeper.

Delicious - used ground turkey since with a sauce this flavorful you can’t really taste the meat... and left out the green pepper as my family doesn’t care for it. Otherwise followed pretty faithfully, and it was perfect! Why buy the canned/package stuff when you probably have all these ingredients in your cupboards already!

This was way too sweet for me. You may want to start with one Tbs. of brown sugar, and then add more according to your tastes. I added it all at once and had to adjust the flavors accordingly. I ended up adding a bit more ketchup, some beef bullion and some hot chinese mustard I happened to have on hand. With those additions, it was pretty good, but I don't know that I'll make this again.

First time I made it I didn't have any bell pepper, so I added celery with the onion instead. Second time, I made it as written with the bell pepper. Very good both ways, but better with the celery.

Very good!  I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and a dash of worcestershire to ground beef after draining along with a few crushed red pepper flakes,  then a splash of acv and balsamic vinegar to the sauce mix.   Hubby says it's on the rotation list!

I substituted ketchup with a similar amount of sweet chili sauce. Also added chopped onion and about 1/2 cup of celery. Next time I'll reduce the water by about 1/4 to 1/2 cup because it took a while to cook down. Surprisingly terrific flavor.

Fantastic.  I’ve never made or eaten a sloppy joe before because the cans of Manwich in the grocery store look awful.  My husband asked me to make this sandwich for dinner so this was the first recipe that popped into my google results.  These homemade sloppy joes were delicious.  Saved this recipe as a fave.  Definitely will cook again.

We loved the taste! The only thing I need to adjust is the amount of water-after 50 minutes of a little more than simmering, there was still too much liquid (and I cut the last cup of water to 3/4 cup). I haven’t seen any other reviews mention this, so I’m not sure why-maybe I used a little less meat.

very good recipe. i did not add the cayenne pepper as my husband does not like too much heat. however i did add a couple of drops of liquid smoke  and it turned out great. also i added a half cup of water the second time and the consistency of the sloppy joe mix was perfect.

This was pretty good but a tad bit too sweet.  I'll make again but I'll probably omit the brown sugar as there is enough sugar in the ketchup for my taste.

Really simple, but great flavor. I too used red bell instead of green pepper. I tripled the amount for an event and I came out perfect. I’ve been looking for that “old polish lady recipe” and this is my go-to!

This is really tasty! My entire family enjoyed. I followed the recipe but added a splash of apple cider vinegar as another reviewer suggested. I didn’t add the 2nd cup of water so I only cooked it for about 20 minutes..we were hungry!

Made sloppy joes for the first time in my life.  My husband was so impressed with this receipe he had me invite our neighbor for dinner this Sunday so he can enjoy them also.  He said  these were the best sloppy joes he had ever eaten.  Unfortunately I can not attest to this  as I am not a fan of sloppy joes nor chili.  I definitely am making again for him.

Best sloppy Joe's ever! My new go to. I used 4 pounds of ground beef , red, yellow and green peppers (I have them frozen in a mix), decreased the salt, upped the cayenne to around  1/4 teaspoon, probably upped the Westchester. Sorry, I don't measure to many things unless baking.

I am fairly new to cooking and this recipe was fairly easy for me. (With the assistance of my man, who loved it). The only thing that I think I may have done wrong, was the type of meat I used. Does anyone know, or can anyone please tell me if I am correct with what went wrong? I saw the lean ground beef and had it in my shopping cart, but then the angus beef stood out to my man.  When I prepared this dish I last night I did not add the second cup of water and still had a lot of juice in the pan upon finishing up. Did I have too much juice because of the fact that there was more grease from the meat or did I do something wrong to make the water not fully evaporate?  Other than that, the flavors were amazing. I will never use Manwich for Sloppy Joe’s, as I have eaten in the past. Thank you for this website and this delicious recipe. It was actually very fun to make!!!! I’m gonna go eat the left overs now. The flavors have most likely set in even more. Yumsters in my tumsters!

I used vegan (soy protein meat/beef less) ground.  I also used coconut aminos in place of the Worcestershire sauce, and used agave nectar in place of crystallized brown sugar.  Accompanied with gluten-free onion rings!!?????????????????

Thank you Chef John for another great recipe. I had 1 lb of ground beef so I adjusted accordingly. I did NOT use 2 cups of water as I used one of those copper frying pans (no stick) and the ingredients was blending beautifully without all that water. I did add a cup to the end and simmered for 40...Perfection. Served on Rustic Farm Boule (yum) with sweet potato puffs and it was a great hit. First time for me to make a sloppy joe recipe so I was thrilled when it came out looking like your video. Thanks again. Will make it again real soon.

I’ve made this many times for my family and for parties. Everybody LOVES this!! It is by far 100X better than sloppy joes from a can! The only thing I have changed is the amount of water. I have found 2 cups is way too much. I just made this again tonight and only used 1 cup and that turns out much better! I can’t say enough how awesome this recipe is!!

Made this for dinner last night. Overall, it was pretty good!  I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and some chili garlic sauce. Hubby said it was a little sweet for him (and he likes sloppy joes sweet) so next time I'll do just 1 T of brown sugar and a bit more spice.

Great starter recipe! I only used half the water, 1 lb of ground beef, and equal parts tomato paste, sun dried tomato ketchup, and regular ketchup. I've seen some reviews where  they've added a splash of vinegar so I may try that next time along with some minced red pepper. Using less water made for quicker results too.

Pretty good sloppy joes. It could use a little more flavor so I ended up doubling the mix for 2 lbs of burger. I only used 1 c water, and thought it was too much. I couldn't imagine how messy it would have been if I used the 2 c called for.

My family really liked the Sloppy Joes.  I have made this recipe twice and will be one of my regular recipes.  I did make a couple of changes; I added more Worcester than called for and I added a few dashes of Tabasco sauce.  I did add the cayenne pepper and in addition some of my home grown and dries Anaheim chili flakes.  This is a great recipe as is but the added ingredients step it up a notch.

I came upon this by accident while looking for a SloppyJoe recipe. I use a red or orange pepper ??instead of green ??  and 1/2 cup of King Syrup (table syrup from Pa) and it is the best SJ I ever had. My family LOVES it and always asks for it. I will never make it any other way again!

Awesome recipe.  Very easy to make and not too many ingredients needed. Had everything at home in my cupboards.  My friends loved it and begged me for the recipe. Loved the slight sweetness of the brown sugar which I never had in a Sloppy Joe before. This will be one of my regular go to recipes from now on. Easily the best Sloppy Joe I have ever eaten! Thanks Chef John & Allrecipes.

This recipe was absolutely on Point and even better than my old stand-by Manwhich which is no longer a standard in my kitchen.   My husband and Brothers -In- Law were over watching a game and I had just read up on the Sloppy Joe Dip recipe on Chef John's Food Wishes and thought I would try it out and it was a Super Hit!  They thought  Manwhich stepped up their sauce a bit cause it tasted way better but when I told them I made it from scratch from a recipe on the net, they were surprised.   Thank you Chef John, I was a "Star" for about a minute and a half but felt good anyway being a new wife at 24.

I made this recipe last night it was very good, the brown sugar made it  a little to sweet for me so I will reduce the amount I added to half of what the recipe asked for. Other than that it was perfect. I will be making this recipe again.

I put in a cup of  Spicy Bold V8 Juice instead of the 2nd cup of water.    Makes it a little spicy and sneaks in 8 vegetables.  It was very yummy, and I like the texture.  The tip of putting it on a flat spoon and make sure it doesn't drip off....Great Tip.

It was much better than Manwich  or canned sauces.  It was  sweet because of the ketchup and the addition of 3 tsp of brown sugar.  I didn't have brown sugar so I just added white.  Outside of that substitute,  I followed the recipe.  I have never made sloppy joes  homemade before so I was very impressed!  I think I will add some Worcestershire sauce or beef broth favoring and  use 2 tsp. of brown sugar. I really like Chef Johns recipes.  They're GREAT!

Very easy and you can’t beat homemade. I would just go easy on the brown sugar. Too sweet. Toast your buns a bit to make a firmer burger.

Very tasty! Good flavor. Had to let it cool longer to allow more evaporation of liquid (5-7 min). But at the right consistency it was over the top!

Chef John has done it again!  This recipe is super easy to follow, uses everyday ingredients and produces excellent results.  There won't be any more canned sloppy joe sauces in our household, this one is full of flavor and as mentioned in the recipe, can lend itself to so many variations. Making your own sauce allows you to reduce the liquid that both super enhances the depth of the flavors and creates a filling that isn't as sloppy/soupy as the store-bought ones.  I'm thinking a Mexican version using enchilada sauce instead of ketchup would be a yummy variation and it could be kicked up a notch using chilies /jalapenos instead of the peppers.  You can really get creative with this basic recipe!

My family loves this recipe! I leave out the bell pepper (can’t have it) and the black pepper (don’t like it), and used regular mustard. It is delicious! It’s our regular sloppy joe recipe.

This was very good!  I only used 1 pound of ground beef and I used a red pepper because I hate green peppers.  Because of the smaller amount of beef I only used 1 cup of water instead of two.  It all worked out perfectly and was great!  This was the first time I have ever made them from scratch instead of using Manwich.   Thank you for this recipe.

I've just started getting more serious about cooking recently, but this is a wonderful rendition for beginner cooks. Simple to follow, and tasted absolutely delicious!

I read a couple reviews saying it was a bit sweet, so I only used 1 cup of ketchup and a bit less brown sugar than suggested. I also used 1 (fairly large) onion, and both a green and red pepper. Also not a fan of mustard, and as such didn't add it in.

Fairly sweet still, so I'd recommend going easy on the sugary ingredients, but this recipe turned out wonderful and I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future!

I added extra mustard but other than that, I  kept it the same. It was fantastic. My family could not stop eating them.

Super yummy.  I am low carb so I made this with no sugar added ketchup, Spenda instead of sugar and added a dash of sriracha.  This was a really good recipe.  Thank you.

PERFECT........ I tripled the recipe for our lake friends. I cooked up the meat with the onions and added the seasoning and sauce mixture the next day in a crockpot. Put the crockpot on warm for about 4 hours while we went skiing on the lake. When we got back it smelled so amazing in the house. Everyone LOVED them and the whole thing was gobbled up. Thank you for sharing. This will be our new go to recipe for large, quick family, lake dinner recipes.

Sloppy Joes are my hubby fav.  I made it and he loved it. I followed the recipe closely. My only change was I made my own Ketchup and added some beer instead of water.  I added the beer because it was very sweet. Next time I will use less brown sugar. This is a keeper.

Made it almost as stated (I only added 1 T of brown sugar at first because you cant take sweet out, but you can always mix it in)- then I had to fix it.  It was brown, not red, and tasted like sweet watery seasoned meat.  Added a tablespoon of regular mustard, a 6 oz jar of tomato paste, a tablespoon of flour to thicken, and a teaspoon of beef stock base paste.  Then I let simmer until thickened.  It passed the test with my kids- we eat organic to avoid herbicide/pesticide exposure and my kids thought we were cheating with an old family favorite mix :)

Only used 1 cup water to soften peppers an half of diced big yellow onion an 3 cloves of garlic.  Compared to can of manwich. Very close. I also  added 4 soup spoons of brown sugar.  I only had 1 can and was in a pinch.

This was..okay.  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't so much better than a can of Manwich that it was worth the extra time, money, and effort.  Also, it took an hour to simmer, and that was with the last 20 minutes being on high.  If I made it again, I'd probably use barbecue sauce instead of catsup and way less water.

We made no changes although i did not measure anything, just kinda eyeballed it.  That’s not true, i did measure the brown sugar abs water.  This is our second time making these and my teen who hated sloppy joe from a can in his youth devoured these.  I’ll add pics once this batch is done and bunned??.  I will say that once payed with pasta salad this will be a pretty high carb night.  The salad has lots of veggies!??

Made it to order, and it was fantastic. Went over big with the other half. Flavor was hundred times better then the can stuff. Only problem with this is, time. You really get a great Sloppy Joe, one of a kind, but it doesn't come quick. This is not a quick week night meal you can throw on the table.  (Unless you plan you meals out for the week, and cook this on the weekend for one of the busy week night It would reheat well). I will be making it again. Thanks Chef John.

Only changes were: 1) a splash of rice vinegar), 2) red pepper since green doesn't like me,  3) probably more than 2 splashes of Worchetershire, and 4) the pan would have overflowed if I had added all the water (oops) so cut back some. It took well over an hour for the water to disappear, but I had the heat on very low for most of the time, thinking more time simmering would enchance flavor since I used less water.

I make this recipe all the time. I personally do not like sloppy joes, or I should said I did not like them. I had only every had sloppy joes from a can. My husband, on the other hand, would ask and ask me to make sloppy joes, but I resisted. Finally as a compromise, I found this recipe. I think its yum, so now my husband gets sloppy joes and I like them too! Thank you!

This has become my go-to recipe for sloppy joes. I do keep out half the water and just add more if needed as it simmers. I will add celery if I have it or sometimes some grated carrots. It is tasty anyway I serve it to my hungry crew.

I love Chef John's recipe's and helpful, fun videos.  I didn't put in the green pepper.  I didn't have any and I know that my two sons don't like cooked peppers.  The consistency  was perfect and very flavorful.

Really great recipe!  I lost my mom's recipe years ago, but hers tasted exactly like this.  Thank you so much for bringing back such a nice memory, it is in regular rotation at my house.  Sometimes I add a little liquid smoke, especially if I'm using TVP or tempeh instead of ground meat

Delicious! I wasn't sure that I would need to cook for the full 40 minutes, but the timing is correct. I ended up with just the right consistency! My only change was to use 1/2 cup of tomato paste in addition to 1/4 cup ketchup, since I was running low on ketchup. I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar to compensate. The sweetness was just how I remember it "back in the day". Thanks Chef John!!!

I don't add the mustard due to my husband's strong dislike for mustard and usually add less water. Otherwise, my whole family enjoys this recipe, even my 6year-old!

I added about a tablespoon of Worcester sauce (the end of a bottle) and we loved it! Also red instead of green peppers. I will definitely make this again.

Everyone gobbled it up! Cut down on the brown sugar and used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I used a jalapeño instead of a bell pepper since it's what I had on hand. Added in some red pepper flake. Served with oven fries. I also didn't add the second cup of water since I felt like it didn't need it. Ty for the recipe!

Beer instead of water, molasses in place of brown sugar, and spicy brown mustard rather than Dijon. Bangin and will definitely keep tinkering.

Nostalgic yummy recipe.  We used to have sloppy Joe’s as children on special occasions. This came up in the thread so I thought I’d try it making  a double batch for family. 

Four generations devoured the two batches in one sitting. I will definitely make this again. Sweet, flavorful, wonderful recipe that is easy to make. This is a fun fall supper recipe.   Recipe called for green pepper but I only had red peppers, delish.

This recipe is, hands down, the best  Sloppy Joe recipe ever. The ONLY thing I changed (or rather, added) was about a teaspoon or two of cider vinegar. Another reviewer mentioned doing this for a bit more of a tangy flavor and it was a great suggestion. My husband doesn't even LIKE sloppy joes and he loved these!! Going into my regular rotation. Thank you!

Good recipe but my family felt it needed more ketchup and I also added Heinz Carolina tangy vinegar sauce. That gave it a pleasant kick. Served at a family gathering and some asked for the recipe. Will make again!

I've made this a few times now. As another reviewer said, it is on the sweet side, but that's easily remedied. When I make this, I cut the sugar in half and add extra dijon, Worcestershire, pepper, and some liquid smoke. I only add a small amount of water as well; no 2 cups across the recipe. I make the sauce in a separate pan and tweak it until I'm satisfied with the taste, and then add the ground beef. I made this again today and made one batch with vegan Boca crumbles instead of ground beef, and it was delicious. This is an excellent base recipe. I will never buy premade mix again!! Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!

Used elk meat from my husband's hunting rather than beef - good flavor and low fat.  Also, don't like green peppers so used red.

As some  reviews said, good flavor but a little sweet, so added some tomato sauce. 

Likely will make it again, but substitute some of the catsup with tomato sauce.

This was so good and easy!  I was a little short on some of my ingredients, so made everything to taste, using the measurements as an approximation of the amounts to use. 
 I also used frozen seasoning blend (red peppers, celery, and onion) instead of the green pepper and reduced the water.  Yum!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was using celery instead of green pepper just because that's all I had in the house.  I will definitely make this sloppy joe recipe again using the green pepper.  My husband loved it!  He is quite picky and always wanted the canned stuff but he is now completely won over with this recipe!  I saw that some reviews stated this was too sweet, but it is really just right!  We loved it!!!!

Very good though next time I think I'll skip the brown sugar or just half the amount.  A bit too sweet for us.

With some changes can be a great recipe.  Against my better judgement I followed the recipe and did not drain the beef.  This changed the way the beef cooked and my meat overcooked

My husband told me to SAVE this recipe. I also added a small 6 oz can of tomato juice for a little zing. Awesome and we loved the smell throughout the kitchen!

This turned out to be hardly more than seasoned beef with peppers and onions. I did not add the extra water at the end, it would've been too wet. It was too wet as it was.  It did not make a "sauce" that resembled traditional sloppy joes. I could have done as well or better just making up a recipe myself, however it's all a matter of personal preference.

I read a lot of people questioning the amount of water in this recipe - I simmered for exactly 40 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  I added an extra dash or two of worcestershire sauce as well as doubled the dijon but that's just my personal preference.

I used 1.2 lbs of hamburger because that is what I had, probably about three tsp of minced garlic and a tsp of  Worchestershire. This is my favorite "Go To" Sloppy Joe recipe. I have been on a Sloppy Joe quest for the past six months. Why? Because I am transitioning from natural teeth to dentures. For a switch I like the Sensational Sloppy Joe recipe from TOH. I did not use any hot additive.

My awesome husband of 43 years LOVES sloppy joes!!!  So do I, but I don't seem to make them enough!  This recipe is very similar to the one I got from my mom years ago!  Although, I've changed it up a bit only because of my allergy to bell pepper...I substitute with celery.  I also add a dash of vinegar.  Thanks Chef John, Your recipes are always great!

My husband & I liked it but will adjust it to our taste.  It was a little too sweet for our taste, so we will reduce brown sugar to 1 tablespoon & add some sriracha sauce to add a little zing to it.  Will definitely make it again.

I made my very own sloppy joes today. I was very happy with the recipe given to make this and it's super good. I see myself making it again. I made it just like chef John but I added just a tab of sweet baby rays barbecue and that was it.

A good recipe, but I needed to modify it for my taste. I didn't add the second cup of water (I didn't have time to wait for it to simmer off) and I didn't have any green pepper. Next time I'll only use half the amount of brown sugar. It was too sweet with 2 TB and ketchup, so I added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes to balance it out and give it a little heat with the cayenne. But not bad overall, and worked for me when I needed it.

My large, picky family all said it was the best sloppy joes I have ever made. I just made a slight change due to lack of ingredients.  I used half ketchup and half bbq sauce.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and it always turns out really good. This past time I realized I was out of ketchup so I used Stubbs BBQ sauce instead. I also had to use up small red and yellow peppers so I threw them in too. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John :)

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it.  My husband raved about how delicious it was!  I thought it was too sweet.  The second time I made it, I added the brown sugar to taste.  Probably a teaspoon or so.  Much better!  This recipe is a keeper!!!

I made it exactly as written and I had my doubts about the sauce thickening up but it came out fine.  Very good flavor.  Will make again.  I will probably add a little cider vinegar next time to make it perfect.

I didn't make any changes, and I thought it was just a little too sweet. I'd tone down the sugar just a bit and add double the onion.

My family literally scraped the skillet clean. I am never using anything from a can ever again. The only thing I did different was cut down the brown sugar a bit and add honey bbq sauce. It was a winner!

Great recipe even if you don't have all the ingredients.  Sadly, I didn't have an onion, but used powdered onion and it was absolutely  delicious.   I'm definitely making this again and am predicting that it will be even better with a fresh onion.   Thanks Chef John!!!

Great recipe. I used beer instead of water (half as much), added a dash of cider vinegar and a small can of tomato paste. Also used half sausage/hamburger, next time will use less or no sausage. No one has spoken since I served, pretty sure it's a hit :)

So happy to find this recipe. The flavor is incredible! My husband loved these. We hadn't had sloppy Joe's in years, now this recipe changes that! It took longer than 40 minutes to thicken (mine took about 1.5 hours), I will reduce the water next time. Great, yummy recipe!!! Thanks, Chef John.

These were great... The only things I changed are that I didn't have any onion or fresh garlic, so I omitted those...did use garlic powder on my meat. And I left out 1 cup of water & simmered for about 10 min less. They were great though & we had very little leftovers!! Will definitely make again :-)

Seriously the best sloppy Joe I've ever had.  Making things like this from scratch always makes me feel good about dinner because I know exactly what I'm eating (I really didn't know ketchup was used in Sloppy Joes until today). Best of all no canned food taste! lol

You saved me! I forgot to pick up the canned stuff and was desperate. I had promised the kids Sloppy Joes! After frantic search, I found this recipe (everything in my pantry!!) but was skeptical.  Made it EXACTLY and everyone was SO happy!!! Made the kitchen smell amazing! Will be using this for tailgating next!

Really good change up from the canned stuff. It was a bit sweet, so I just put a little less brown sugar.

I made this and it was delicious. I doubled the garlic and added a red pepper for colour. We used ciabatta buns. Next time I will add celery.

So, I used this recipe and added a splash of ACV based on a review on here and it was perfect! Not too sweet or tangy, it was the perfect balance. This is going in as one of our staple meals... Thank you!

This a great recipe and I have made it often with half venison and half beef. I have made my own additions. I use Ketchapeno from Kitchen Fire, in place of Ketchup, great stuff. That spices it up! If you can't find Ketchapeno then add a jalapeno or two to jazz it up.Enjoy the retro.

So good!  My memory of sloppy joes from childhood is that they're kind of "meh," but these are incredible.  You really do need to plan in some time and be patient enough to let the liquid reduce way down.  I really like that there's not a lot of tomato in this recipe--only the little bit of ketchup.  Some sloppy joe recipes call for lots of tomato sauce and/or paste, which I think would drown out the other delicious flavors.  This is a favorite in our house!

I made this recipe with ground turkey and it was a HUGE HIT!  Even a person who does not like ground turkey or sloppy joes loved it!!  I didn't add the second round of water as I was putting it in a crock pot to keep it warm and it had plenty of moisture.  Have made it twice already and GONE both times!  :-)

I really don't understand the reasoning behind all the water. It can slow simmer with the lid on the pan and accumulate plenty of moisture but I followed the instructions anyway. No lid, just simmered it until it was thick. I think I used a little too much cayenne. All in all, my husband loved it. I really eyeballed the ingredients. I think I used a little too much sugar so I toned it down with vinegar. I guess I was surprised to hear my husband say how much he really liked it. I have a couple other recipes from this site that I like just as much but this is a keeper.

Not bad but too wet and not enough kick. I added 1 can of RoTel, 1 can of diced tomatoes, no water at all, 1 small can of Penn. Dutch mushrooms and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and simmered for 2 hrs so all flavors could be tasted. I also upped the Worcestershire and Dijon, but a great starter recipe though!

Made this for dinner tonight. It was very sweet. If you like it like that,fine but we do not. So I added a lot of vinegar to counteract the sweetness and we really like it then. I will not buy another sloppy joe mix or manwich. This will be my new recipe using less sugar in the future.

I found this recipe a bit too sweet and I only added about 1 tsp of sugar (the ketchup seems to have enough sugar).  In an attempt to improve the flavor, I added more worcestershire sauce and some paprika.  Still, I loved the way that the sauce thickened up which made it the perfect consistency for a hand-held sandwich!

I traded the beef for beefless meat and it came out really good. I read some reviews saying it was a bit too sweet, so I cut back on the brown sugar by quite a bit. The recipe is straightforward so it was easy. I followed the recipe very loosely adjusting for my taste. All in all, I liked it.

Far far too sweet.  I had to really work to rescue this one.  Next time I'm leaving out 75% of the sugar since there is more than enough in the ketchup to start with.  I'm also going to add a couple pinches of Crushed Red Pepper for just a hint of heat.

My husband is a picky eater! He certainly loved this sloppy Joe! I've made this twice in one week! Awesome!!!! I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce and sea salt instead of regular salt.

This recipe is delicious.no need in be going back to the canned stuff!I did mine a little different. I browned and seasoned the meat with seasoned salt, diced onion, garlic powder and black pepper. I halved the meat and doubled the sauce and only used 1/2 cup of water. Mixed and the sauce and COVERED and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. My boyfriend HATES sloppy Joe's (canned) but even he ate these and liked them.

I tried this recipe for lunch today. Yes it is sweet. In future I may cut back on the sugar. Not totally sure though as my husband and children prefer sweet. 

I did make some changes. I did not have time to mince the peppers so skipped them. Otherwise my husband would not have eaten. He is allergic to onions so those were left out as well. I used precooked beef already seasoned. I also used powdered garlic instead of fresh for the time factor. In future I will use fresh as I prefer fresh garlic. 

I almost forgot to add I used bolillos instead of hamburger buns. As they are a bit chewier I chose to scoop out the center to help the meat stay put. Then I thought to cut short the simmering time and add the scooped out bread to thicken it. This way I did not waste the bread. Whether I do this again depends on the bread I use. If I use regular hamburger buns I will not. If I use chewy bread or rolls than I think I will as I like the way it turned out.

I really enjoyed making and eating this.  I did not have worcestire sauce and I thought it was still good.  Look forward to making it with more precise ingredients next time.

Had a couple of teen-age boys working all day with us, so I fixed this for supper. Received raved reviews.
My husband ask if we could have this again...absolutely. I even went back for seconds...oh yeah, there wasn't any.

Made exactly as written recipe. I did add the cayenne pepper, about 1/4 tsp. Very tasty. You do have to simmer the entire 40 plus minutes in order for enough water to evaporate, otherwise will be runny. Best homemade sloppy joe recipe I've found so far.

I made this last night and it was great. I added Asian salad instead of Cole slaw on top and my wife said it tasted like a gourmet Sloppy Joe.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. It's the perfect balance of sweet and savory, and a great way to sneak green peppers and onions in my toddler's food. I used this as a filling for biscuits and baked at 350 for 12-14 minutes. Delicious! Such a perfect, quick meal.

These are so good. I followed the recipe to a T. Don't hurry this one. Prep is easy but have patience on the simmering,.. simmering... simmering. Joe's were not overly sweet like the canned stuff. I think it is very, very important to use very lean meat. I used 93/7 hamburger. No crease on the bottom of the bun - very important for taste and presentation. Served with Tater Tots and Cole Slaw.

Tried recipe today. Had to leave out bell pepper, but added celery.  Thought it would never cook off the liquid, but to my surprise it did cook down & turned out delish!

this is a great take on sloppy joe sauce from a can. Tastes richer and I know exactly what's in it! Like my mamma used to do, I always add a medium diced potato when browning the beef, just adds a nice little something and stretches the beef a little further. So I just used 1 pound of ground beef. I also added more than a few dashes of worcestershire (by accident!) and doubled the mustard after tasting, and then cooked it down til nearly dry as suggested. Fantastic! I can't eat processed lunch meats, and so keep this in the fridge just about all the time for a quick sandwich.

Way too sweet for our taste...used organic ketchup and Stevia brown sugar...will make it again but will cut the sugar by at least half.  Celery might be a nice addition as well.

Made 5 quarts (40-half cup servings) for son's High School Church group last weekend.  Huge hit!  First time I've made it homemade and so much.  Used food processor for onions which REALLY helped a lot.  I don't think the original recipe stated if a serving was for 1/2 or 1 cup.  I used 4" hamburger buns and a 1/2 cup of sauce was perfect.  Although my sauce was not supper thick, the kids asked for spoons and the plates were spotless!  Guess the sauce passed the test.
Thanks for the recipe!  Will have to make it again.

Definitely 5 stars!  This was fantastic!  My husband who has claimed he hates sloppy joes loved these. I made enough for 20 servings for a church dinner.   Only change I made was instead of 3 cups of water I used 1 cup water and 1 cup beef broth. Other than this made no changes.

I used this recipe as a place to start and I was SO happy with the results! I did make some changes, though. I used 1/2 lb. of ground beef and one 15 oz. can of kidney beans. I used yellow mustard, closer to 1 tbs. of brown sugar and only one cup of water. I left the rest of the measurements the same and opted to add the cayenne pepper. I loved them and so did my husband and daughter. You couldn't even taste the beans(kid-friendly!) and they were so flavorful. It made enough for 7 or 8 sandwiches.

This is a great recipe for sloppy joes!  The only change I made was to use less water with the sauce.  I served this with the French Fries I recipe and the Becel® Browned Buttery Brussels Sprouts recipe (both from this site and both delicious!!).  Perfect, easy dinner!

Made exactly as written and it was awesome! The best thing is - now that I've made it more than a few times I can just eyeball everything or swap ingredients depending what I have on-hand. No excuse ever to buy a can or package of mix cause it is so easy!

Now this is a sloppy joe like my mom used to make. Excellent recipe thank you! The only drawback is the sodium is really high, but that can be easily adjusted.

Exactly what I was looking for an easy, retro meal. I feel like I've taken a trip back to the 70's... Man, I miss Mom!
