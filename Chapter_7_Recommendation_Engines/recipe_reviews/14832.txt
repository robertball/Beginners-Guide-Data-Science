I give this 5 stars for inspiration. The dinner I made from this won rave reviews. I made the marinade as per the instructions, except used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and green onions instead of regular. Sliced the pork to 1/2" thick slices and laid out, slightly overlapping in square baking dish. Marinated it overnight, then drained off marinade into saucepan. Baked as per instructions. In the meantime, made brown rice and added a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies the last 5 minutes of cooking. Spread rice/veggies on plate and laid slices of pork over top. Served with boiled marinade in small condiment dishes on the side. Superb!

This was so good my husband and son ate it before I could get the other food out on the table.  I used this as a main dish.  The flavor was good and so tender! Next time I will use the low salt soy sauce to reduce the saltiness:)

This dish is wonderful but more of a main course than an appetizer (or this dish is better suited if using bite sized pork with bones).

WOW!  I made the recipe and poured it into a baggie with 4 chicken breasts, then froze it.  The day I used it, I defrosted it for 20 minutes in the microwave then put it in the fridge for the rest of the day.  We barbequed the chicken breasts for supper and we will definitely be making it again!

The whole family liked it. I will definitely make it again.  I cut up the pork into bite size pieces for quicker cooking and served over rice.  The will become a regular for dinner at my house.

Delicious recipe despite how salty it was. Next time I am going to use low-sodium soy sauce. Followed the recipe to the letter but added a tad of sesame oil. Marinated overnight. Husband remarked at how tender this was and how the flavor really permeated the meat. Served with stir fry veggies. Also, I cut mine up as appetizer sized bites.

I love soy sauce, and it was good.  But for the average person I would say it is a little too salty.  Served it with Fried Rice for a nice Japanese style meal.

I made this a little while ago, and it was pretty good.  I used half teriyaki sauce and half soy sauce.

I made this the other night for dinner, and it was great. It was so easy for a busy Mom like me... Marinade, then cook 3 hours later. Even my kids (2 & 9) liked it.

While the pork looked very attractive, we aren't sure that this is such a great appetizer because it would get cold so fast;  we used it as part of a regular meal instead.  The flavor of the pork was OK, a little too salty.  But the dipping sauce was WAY over the top too salty in our opinion.  The pork was OK without the sauce anyway, though.  Not bad for a change of pace, but not something we're too excited about either.

Very yummy! I eliminated sesame seeds and onions (didn't have them on hand and hubby doesn't care for onions). I'm giving it four stars because it was a little too salty (I think i will try low salt soy sauce next time). I also marinated overnight. A big hit otherwise though!

My family loved this recipe, I highly recommend it.  I changed it a little, I used fresh ginger to give it more of a zing and used mushroom soy also.  I marinated the pork strips for about 10 hours and it really made a difference.  I baked the pork with marinade, about 1/2 cup of water and seasame oil (instead of vege oil) in a small casserole very slowly for about 1.5 hours.  I took the advice of another review and used brown rice and then stir fried some fresh veges such as bok choy, cauli, capsicum etc and layed it on top of the brown rice then put the pork and marinade on top of the veges in a line through the centre.  My family couldn't eat enough of it, fantastic!

This dish was far too salty, I guess because I used regular strength soy sauce.  It was tolerable only because I served over white rice.  Will not be making this sauce again.

I served these for an appetizer dinner party, and they were a big hit.  The pork came out really tender and wasn't dry.  I didn't have enough marinade leftover to make the dipping sauce, though, so we just ate them as it.  Still yummy!

This is a great marinade for pork.  I loved it- I wrapped the cooked strips into wontons and sauteed in pan to lightly brown and crisp up wontons...drain on papertowels and serve with a favorite mustard honey sauce...

This was pretty good. I only marinated it about 1 hour and it was still very tasty. I'm not sure the sesame seeds added that much. It seemed like there were a lot of them though. Will make this again.

I did really enjoy this dish. I actually could only marinade it for 1.5 hours and it was still very flavorful. I would agree with the others that it was a bit too salty because of the soy sauce. I think next time I will cut down on that and add some honey or more sugar to even the taste out. Overall, this is a keeper for my family:)

This was a delicious main dish with asian influence. However, I would recommend doubling the recipe if you are doing a large pork loin. I pre-sliced my pork, laid it out in a 9x13 dish, covered my pork in the marinade, and then baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. This allowed the mariade to really stick to the meat and made the pork nice and tender!

I have tried this and it was just okay for us....The flavors didn't seem to compliment each other as well as I would have liked them too and it seemed a bit too salty.

I used a 1 1/2 lb. pork tenderloin and doubled the sauce.  I cut the tenderloin into 2-inch slices and baked for 20 minutes.  We found this to be very flavorful and tender but also very salty.  If I make this again I think I'll add more sugar to balance the salt.

I've served this to company on several occasions and it always gets rave reviews.  Easy to spruce up with a little garnish.  What makes it better....it's very easy!  This one is one in which it's fun to play with the seasoning a little as well (especially if you're familiar with Asian spices).

I used this marinade on center-cut boneless butterfly chops, since that's what I had on hand. Wow, what an awesome marinade for pork chops! I let them sit in the marinade in the fridge for about 8-9 hours, then grilled them outside. Excellent flavor, not too salty/overwhelming and if you're lucky, some of the sesame seeds will stick to the meat and get nice and toasted during the grilling process! I substituted brown sugar for the white, which gave a nice carmelization, and served with Thai peanut noodles and steamed broccoli. We discarded the marinade vs. boiling and serving it, as I decided that condensing it during the boiling process would have made it way too salty, but the marinade on the pork chops themselves was perfect! Thanks so much for the recipe...this will be our standard marinade for chops from now on!

Very good flavor.  I added some water to the boiling marinade (about 1/4-1/2c), so we didn't find the finished sauce too salty.  I wish the outside of the tenderloin had been crispier.  Next time, I may try bbq-ing it.

We put the tenderloin on the grill instead of in the oven.  It was very tender and flavorful, but the sauce was salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce.  I served the pork with sauce over rice and broccoli.  I will definitely try this again.

I used these pork strips on a romaine salad with onions and mandarin oranges to create an Asian Pork Salad with an asian-type dressing.  It was very good.

This was really good, although the sauce was what made it. I cut the soy sauce in half and substituted red wine for the other half. My wife didn't think it was too salty, and she is constantly complaining about how salty dishes are. However, next time I may cut back even further on the soy sauce and try either white wine or chicken broth as a substitute. By the way, the sauce was great with Polenta as well.

All I have to say is WOW.  Delicious.  I used the marinade for the pork and also shrimp on skewers.  My daughter said "make this every week".  I use to buy marinated teriyaki pork and it would cost $10.  This one was less than $5.00 (not including marinade, I have on hand.  This is definitely better.  Thank you.

This was really good.  We marinated this over night.  As another suggested we sliced this before cooking.  Then we tried the sauce on another night and marinated shrimp, broiled (2 1/2 minutes per side at 450) on skewers and added the seed at the last minute of broiling.

Really good flavor.  I made some adjustments though.  I didn't have the sesame seeds, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil instead.  I also added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar.  And one extra tablespoon of soy sauce.  They were excellent.

This would have been perfect if I could master soy sauce. The reserve marinade after boiled was gorgeous,just too salty. I will make this again with low sodium soy and see if that is more suitable.

I had quite a bit of leftover lo mein and pork fried rice in the frig from Chinese takeout the nite before - so I made this dish since it had an Asian flavor.  I followed the recommendation of other reviewers and cut the pork into bit size chunks - only had 2 hrs to marinade and it still picked up all the flavor - it cooked in 30 mins.  I'll definitely make this again.  I'm also going to put this in my appetizer section - would be great to serve with toothpicks in the pork and have the sauce and maybe some Chinese hot mustard on the side for dipping.  Thanks submitter.

Made it last week, it was so delicious! My family loved it! I grilled for an hour half instead and added a bit of honey flavored whiskey. Definitely will repeat this recipe!

Very tasty! I used a 3-lb roast and made 50% more marinade. Slower roasting is best for moistness and I always use a thermometer to make sure it doesn't get overcooked.

I had high hopes for this with all of the stellar reviews - but we found this to be just okay - Followed the recipe exactly - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't in our opinion a 5 star - we could take it or leave it.

East and very tasty recipe.  I went along with the other reviewers and sliced my pork before cooking and then cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes.  Perfect.  Can't wait to make this for company.

Great!  I'm not a fan of pork but this was delicious. Also, it looks beautiful sliced and served fanned out over rice! I omitted the sugar, halved the garlic, and substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.
