What a great dressing! I found it when I was looking at the Chicken Fiesta Salad reviews, and another reviewer mentioned this dressing. I am not a tomato soup fan AT ALL, so I was leary. I tasted it right after I made it, and still wasn't sure, but after letting it sit and blend the flavors, I was so happy!! I just finished making it for the second time, this time, I put everything in my Magic Bullet. Used only 1/2-3/4 cup oil, and about 1/2 the sugar. We actually use it on all salads for a different flavor. So good! Thanks!!

We really liked this recipe and it deserves a five star rating.  I used all of the ingredients listed in the recipe (yes, I used the cornstarch).  I used Campbell's condensed tomato soup.  Placed everything inside my food processor, pulsed a couple of times, poured it into a jar and refrigerated it.  I served it over taco salads! I've never tasted the original Dorthy Lynch (R) Style Salad dressing - but this recipe is perfect as written!  Thanks Angel for sharing!

I had to make a quick switch out to make what I had on hand work--I did not have celery seed, what I used instead was celery salt which meant I omitted the additional salt. When it came to adding in the oil, I did what Sherri did and started with a half cup of oil and then added it by tablespoon until it got to the consistancy I was looking for. I used this as a dressing for Mexicali Pasta Salad. Both my husband and I thought it was a little too sweet, I'd make this again but I would cut back on the sugar by at least half. I was thinking that this would also make an excellent dressing for taco salad.

Love, love, love this dressing!  I have a friend who brings me this dressing from Nebraska, as I cannot find it in Indiana.  This dressing is soooo very close to the real deal.  I made as written using the blender to mix everything, including the cornstarch.  I will be making another batch when school starts to leave there for my daily lunch salad.  THANK YOU Angel for sharing this recipe - it rocks!

Oh my, this was great!  Hubs and I both really liked it.  I made half this recipe to try it out.  I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the sugar in half, using 3 T. for my half recipe.  I also didnâ€™t use the cornstarch.  I whisked everything up in a bowl and transferred it to a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shook it to further emulsify it.  We enjoyed this on Chicken Fiesta Salad, also on this site.  And to use up the remaining half can of tomato soup, I made half a recipe of Tomato Soup Spice Cake, also here on AR.

I've made this dressing many, many times and it's always loved by family and friends.It's very close to the original Dorothy Lynch Salad Dressing and it's so easy and inexpensive to make! I do use apple cider vinegar, I think it works best. Try this~you will be so glad you did!

I used my blender for making this dressing, I started with 1/2 cup of oil and then added in more until it reached the right flavor as another reviewer suggested, probably 3/4 cup total. No need for the optional cornstarch. My husband couldn't stop raving about this dressing, he really loved it, as did my son. It was tad too sweet for me, but then I don't put sugar on anything...so that is just me. I can't compare to the store version, since I've never had it. We used on a regular green salad.

Absolutely loved this creamy, tomatoey, sweet dressing.  I followed the recipe as written, but prepared in the blender, drizzling in the oil a little at a time.  No need for cornstarch.  I served this over taco salad as suggested, delish!  This is a keeper, for sure.

This was very close to the store-bought dressing.  I left the garlic out (hubby is allergic) and used Splenda instead of sugar.  It is delicious! So happy to find this recipe!

This was excellent and easy.  I first made it per the recipe but with only 1/2 cup sugar.  That seemed to be a good choice as it came out sweet, but not "too"
Later, I made some adjustments.  Pepper total 1/2 tsp, garlic powder total 1/4 tsp. corn starch total 1 tsp.
Then I read the actual mfgr bottle label and added 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp rice flour.
All of the changes made modest improvements.

I also add 1/4 tsp potassium sorbate solution to prevent mold and yeast spoiling.  This is found on Amazon under winemaking supplies and some is in the factory dressing.  I do this for all tomato sauces and salad dressings that aren't used right away.  It really works.

Yum. I used less oil, sugar and salt and more garlic/pepper but it is easy to play around with. Really easy and tasty dressing. It was really good with an organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. My husband loves Dorothy lynch so I was skeptical but he didn't even notice it wasn't his usual salad dressing. I did use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch.  It turned out the perfect texture. The second time I made it I used slightly less vinegar and slightly more sugar and I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Then I pulsed it in the blender and this is now our favorite salad dressing.

I made this to go on the Chicken Fiesta Salad (recipe also on AR) per the recommendation of other reviewers for the salad.  I was skeptical about this salad dressing - really tomato soup in a salad dressing?  But it was very good!  I really enjoyed it on the salad and can see how it would be good on any taco salad or the like.  I halved the recipe and let it sit all day in the refrigerator.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Spot on!  Excellent to dress the chicken Fiesta Salad from this site.  I would use this again on any salad!  I made the whole recipe and half left over, so will keep it in the frig for another occasion.  I did add 2 cloves a garlic, just because we are garlic lovers!  Kids also loved it!

I made this with fresh tomato sauce that I made from my homegrown tomatoes and it was fantastic! I didn't add the oil and backed way off of the sugar and used brown sugar instead of white and Braggs Apple cider vinegar. If the tomato soup isn't something you want to use (gotten bad reviews)  and you don't have your own home grown sauce, maybe try stewed tomatoes instead. It definitely had the Dorothy flavor without a lot of calories.

I never rate a recipe unless made exactly as written, How can you?  This was not the best at first because I used store brand tomato soup.  The next time I used Campbell's and it made all the difference in the world.  At first I used a jar and shook it up, it separated.  The blender is the only way to make it mix together well and stay mixed.  Although I use it frequently, it stays  in the fridge for much longer than several months. The rating is for the way it was written--not specific enough.

This was wonderful! I did only use 1/4 cup sugar.  Since I am diabetic I may try liquid Stevia next.  This is a keeper.

I was born in Omaha, Nebraska and lived there until I was 32. I miss "Dorothy Lynch Homestyle Dressing" and am so glad to find this recipe with the taste I remember!
There really was a Dorothy Lynch.

This is not very good. Thin, odd flavor with the canned tomato soup, just not impressive.
