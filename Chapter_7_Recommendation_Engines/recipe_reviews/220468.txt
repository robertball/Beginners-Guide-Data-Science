Delicious!  Easy and awesome. I love, love, love all of the ingredients in this salad, so it was a no-brainer. The bite of the arugula paired with the sweet figs and balsamic vinegar are a perfect balance.

Really good salad - I did change it - used blue cheese crumbles and parmesan cheese and instead of balsamic vingear, used balsamic vinegrette. I also added dried cranberries.  Would make again!

I generally don't care for a salad made with arugula on it own.  It's just too bitter for me and typically needs to be tempered with another, milder green.  Unless you choose to use this dressing that is. Use a high quality aged balsamic for this salad for best results, and the freshest figs you can find. I brought ours back from Seattle, WA and they were better today, one week later, than those I recently purchased here in Wisconsin (they molded the very next day). Oh, what a salad.  Five stars - from both of us.

A quick salad that is sure to impress guests! This was my first time using fresh figs and it surely won't be my last! Figs can be hard to find, but when you do, be sure to try this recipe! I used a bit more arugula than called for so the portions would be a bit bigger, given the number of figs. I recommend whisking the honey and balsamic together in a small bowl before drizzling over the arugula. A light sprinkle of salt and freshly cracked pepper in the dressing would be a nice touch. Thank you Serena!

I substituted walnuts for the pine nuts and goat cheese for the parmesan, so a bit different, but delicious--thanks for the inspiration.

for me, this is a tough recipe to judge. i'll give this a 5. I like figs...but these are not the type figs I like. I like the greens, but mine were more bitter then peppery. I also didn't realize pine nuts were so expensive. I used fresh grated cheese. this was weird---wife disliked the fresh figs, I hated the arugula. WE BOTH LOVED EVERYTHING WHEN COMBINED. ma-n-law said to cut the figs smaller, we did have some whoppers. i'll make this again when our figs start coming in. you are either gonna love this or hate it. WE LOVE IT!

Surprisingly very good for the few ingredients & ease of preparation. I made a dab more dressing because I like a little more dressing. Also works well with baby spinach & toasted pecans.

This is super healthy, easy and what's not to love about arugula and figs :)  I have a fig tree so this is a keeper for me.

I must admit, this was just okay for us.  I made it twice to use up the ingredients I purchased.   I probably won't be making it again very soon.  Fortunately, the figs were  a BOGO, so the cost of  them didn't hurt so bad.

Hit the spot.  I only had unsalted pistachios, no pine nuts in the kitchen.  Still a wonderful salad for a quick and easy lunch.  Will certainly make again real soon!

This is such an easy yet elegant salad.  The spiciness of the argula paired with the sweetness of the figs and honey is wonderful and the balsamic ties it all nicely together!  Very versatile recipe.  Next time I'lll use fig balsamic (was out).

Substituted red grapes for figs as no fresh figs available, figuring 4 grapes = 1 fig.  Used chopped walnuts as another reviewer had suggested.   It was delicious!  Doubled recipe to serve four people and all loved it.

Delicious and simple salad.  A little too sweet as is for me so minus one star.  My changes to make it a 5 star - grill or roast the figs first so they are nice and soft.  To the dressing I added about 4 TBSP olive oil and a dash of salt and pepper.  Whisked the dressing up first before pouring it over the salad.  I used feta instead of parmesan and that was very nice.

We loved this salad.  We are arugula lovers, so if you can't hang with the strong earthy flavor of this type of lettuce, I wouldn't even consider this recipe.   As is we loved it!  We could only find dried figs, so I will be searching for fresh next time around.  I did mix the dressing in a small bowl to pour on.  We will cut it with a bit of Olive oil next time just for extra fat.  We eat this as a main course item, so the extra fat will be welcomed.

Delicious!  This is now one of my favorite salads.  Thanks for sharing!  The first time I made it I used arugula but found the arugula to over power the figs.  The second time I used baby spinach and it was perfect.  Tried a couple balsamics and liked the white balsamic wine vinegar the best.  I used a less expensive Parmesan but next time it would be worth splurging for the harder more aged cheese.  Wonderful flavors together and very refreshing!

Enjoyed this simple salad but I found it overly sweet. I cut way back on honey the second time (reduced to 1 tablespoon but will cut back more next time), used white balsamic vinegar and added some extra vergin olive oil. Sadly, fresh figs are out of season so I used dried white Figs.

Great combination of ingredients :) I added finely chopped up cucumber and some red chilly for an extra kick. Also substituted the honey for silan (date honey) in the dressing and it paired really well with the balsamic vinegar.

I have made this recipe many times and I have used fresh fig and dried figs. I have also used these ingredients on top of flat bread pizza with some goat cheese sprinkled on top. Fast, easy and very addictive!

I added Grammy smith green apples to it. It was delish! Soak Grammy smith sliced apples in ginger ale and it eliminates turning the apples brown.

Delicious!  And so few ingredients.  I didn't have figs the first time I made this so I used pears and it was awesome.  The second time I made it I used apples and candied walnuts I had leftover from Thanksgiving - still excellent!  I'm sure it would be great with many different fruit and nut substitutions.

We really enjoyed this salad.  It was very simple and easy to make.  The combination of sweet from the honey and figs worked wonderfully with the bitterness from the arugula and the balsamic.  I had never thought to use fresh figs in a salad before seeing this recipe.  I am glad I tried it.  I will definitely serve this recipe again!

The parmesan was a little bland, I think the tartness of Goat cheese, Blue Cheese crumble or feta would be delish instead.  Loved that there's no olive oil or other oil needed for this recipe... Will make again with one of those cheeses.

Family loved this recipe. Made a substitution. Used Blue  Cheese Crumble instead of Parmesan. Had to skip the pine nuts.  The honey and balsamic dressing made it a perfect compliment. Thanks

This salad is a keeper. I used pears, as suggested, which worked out perfectly. Loved the combination of flavors and so easy to prepare. I served this with fettuccine alfredo. Will definitely make this again.
