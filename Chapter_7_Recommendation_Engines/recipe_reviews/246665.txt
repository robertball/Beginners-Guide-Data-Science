It was great. I used garlic powder and onion powder along with the salt and pepper. Also added a little more olive oil and a couple of drops of  sesame flavored chili oil. We couldn't stop eating them. Mak sure that the edamame are dry when you start if you want them to be crispy.

Only change was to sprinkle on some grated Parmesan last few minutes.  Was quite good and received compliments from my guests.

Healthy easy snack. I like it hot so I added a little crushed red peeper flakes. I substituted Sesame oil for the olive oil to give it that Asian flair that we love and used garlic powder in place of the cloves. I loved it.

Absolutely AWESOME!  So quick and easy to make, and tasted AMAZING!  We no longer need go out for beer & Edamame beans!  The only thing I did differently was added some parmesan cheese (sprinkle) like another reviewer had done!

I love this recipe. Itâ€™s just my husband & I at home so I made the recipe for two. Also, I used garlic powder instead of cloves and sprinkled Parmesan on top of them. Excellent!

This is one of the easiest most satisfying recipes I've made to date. Easy basic ingredients that produce a healthy tasty fun little snack, quickly. What more can you ask for? I changed nothing and it got 5 stars from me. A cook of 49 years. Thanks for posting it.

A little heavy on the garlic but overall very tasty.
