The classic white sauce. Add cheese for a cheese sauce. Other sauces based on this would use tomato puree or lemon or egg yolk. People shouldn't give this a lower rating because it is bland. White sauce is by definition bland because it is used as a base or starter for other sauces. Works perfect for a macaroni and cheese base, add about half a block of Velveeta and it's a great sauce.

This was so easy and a great base. We were having Shrimp so I added crushed garlic, parm cheese, parsley and pepper. Next time I will add tomato and bacon and have it over penne pasta.

I have used this recipe for many years (about 50) and I learned how to make it from my mother, so it's been our family for a long time.  I make a thinner sauce sometimes and use it for a cream soup base.  It's a recipe that every child needs to learn  :)

Great starter white sauce, texture was perfect. I added salt, pepper, nutmeg, fresh crushed garlic, bacon and parmesan. Next time i will add green onions and shrimp instead of bacon.

Use a stainless steel pan and stir with a steel spatula.  This allows you to cover more surface area vs using a spoon and results in less likely to burn.

Very good base white sauce recipe! You can add to your tasting. I added 3 grated cloves of garlic, sun dried tomatoes, grated parmesan cheese, dried basil, salt, pepper and chopped fresh flat leaf parsley. I also added more milk. Tasted great with whole wheat penne and grilled chicken.

Doubled the recipe, added 1/2 cup of good chicken broth, a lot of black pepper (because we like pepper!), salt to taste (kosher and garlic salt blend), and dried parsley. I also added roast chicken from the night before, which I shredded. Then I boiled egg noodles and tossed it with the sauce. SUCH A GREAT QUICK MEAL!... especially when you've had a long day :)

This sauce is AWESOME! Who knew that so few ingredients could make so much food!

I doubled the recipe which resulted in an absolutely perfect ratio of sauce to one box of Penne Pasta for mac n'cheese (added an 8oz bag of shredded cheese to the mixture). 

I will absolutely keep this as a go, on hand recipe! Thanks CJO!

This is the standard white sauce for use in other recipes.  It needs nothing more. This is intended to be used in another recipe.  It is classic cooking, and a sauce every cook should have in their recipe collection.

This recipe saved my bacon!  I had put together a chicken and green chili casserole but it came out dry.  I used this white sauce as a base and then mixed in some diced jalepenos and chicken broth- voila!  The casserole was saved.  The great thing about this sauce is it makes a good "base" and you can add things to it from there.

My family is big on sauce.. and they always use a lot, particularly my husband. I bumped the servings up to 20 *hahaha* and it was perfect! 

I added in Ground thyme, basil, salt and pepper and a dash of horseradish for a little extra kick. It was fabulous!!

This basic sauce can be the start of cream soup also.  Double or triple  the recipe and add milk to get the desired soup consistency.  Stir in any meat or vegetable and simmer until vegetables are tender.  Season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, basil or whatever you like.  It's cheap, tasty and easy to make.   And you can be as creative as you like.

Just finished making some mac and cheese using this recipe as my base. I used 2 cups of milk instead of one and did not double the butter/flour. Once it began to thicken I started adding cheddar cheese, hand fulls at a time which came out to 3/4 cup (approx). I had boiled 3 cups of elbow mac and poured the cheese mix over it, stirring as I poured. I then salted to taste, about 1 tsp by the end of it all and the mac n cheese was perfect. Thanx for the basic recipe, I can't wait to mess around with it.

This recipe is great sauce base for creamed chipped beef and salmon.  For the salmon I add a bit of dill and some peas, but for the SOS it is perfect as is.

perfect base for anything really... just have to season it appropriately. I threw in a splash or two of white wine... parmesan cheese, a fistful of pre-grated pizza cheese, some crack peppercorns, a block of frozen chopped spinach, garlic puree and some coarse salt.... but throw in what you like im sure it will still come out great! best of luck to everyone :-)

This was such an easy recipe!!!  I added 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese after mixing the flour and butter.  After the sauce was thickened I added broccoli cuts and then served this over noodles. My family loved this quick and different meal of choice!  My 1 year old will not eat broccoli but after mixing it with the sauce, he ate it all...  Definantly a new hit for our busy on the go lives..

make it even easier and pop everything in the microwave. No risk of burning anything and lots less stirring. Just melt the butter first, stir in the flour, then put in micro for about 90 seconds. stirring once.

Easy and adaptable!  Halved the recipe, added garlic, white wine, dijon mustard and pepper and served over steak tips--delicious.

Like said in an earlier review, this is a great base with endless possibilities.  I added a garlic clove to the butter and then some sharp white cheddar at the end to melt through.  Awesome over steamed veggies.

I add a pinch of salt and pepper to season.  Sometimes I add a cup or so of cheese to make a cheesy white sauce. This is a wonderful base for many recipes.  I no longer use cream soups in any of my casseroles instead I substitute this white sauce or the cheesy sauce.  I use it in chicken noodle casserole, green bean casserole (use velveeta in sauce top with french fried onion), great topping to trick your kids into trying veggies (worked for me when I was young) also courtesy of Rachael Ray it is a great "glue" for hot ham and cheese sandwiches or pour down over top for a yummy knife and fork sandwich.  Couldn't live without it!

Amazingly helpful sauce base.  First time using it, I replaced the milk with gradually added heavy cream whipping it at the same time until it thickened up  to a cheese or cream sauce consistency.  Salt & pepper.  Then added pasta with fresh spinach, generous bits of sundried tomato and fresh mushrooms.  I recommend serving it this way with Easy Flat Iron Steak in Wine Sauce SUBMITTED BY: Jackie B on this site.  Thanks!

It`s so nice to have some of the most basic recipes posted on this site. I am a mechanic that actually loves to cook but I am not that adventurous and do not usually try to make anything without a recipe. This sauce takes me back some 40 years ago when my Mother would make me creamed peas on toast, just add a can of peas to sauce and cover a slice of toast with it. Eat it with a knife and fork, delicious.

Thanks CJO for the post.

A fine recipe! This works well as a base for a pot pie filling.  I just add a little salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning.  It's much better than any canned soup.

This is a really great and easy recipe that uses everyday ingredients.  You can also use this as a quick base sauce for other pasta recipes like carbonara (add bacon, pimentos, onion) or al fredo sauce (add cheese).  White wine is also quite good in this sauce.  It is a little bland though.

I am 20 years old, and have lived with my parents all my life, so have never really needed to cook anything more adventurous than poached eggs on toast. When I found myself off work for a couple of weeks with problems with my arm, I wanted to cook a nice meal for my parents to come home to, so I made steak and mushrooms with chunky fries... I needed a sauce and quick! I found that modifying this recipe for white sauce lightly made the perfect garlic and peppercorn sauce! I used the 2 tblspns of butter and flour, doubled the milk, and added a generous pinch of salt. A good teaspoon of garlic blend or puree while the butter was melting, A teaspoon of crushed black peppercorns, stirring all the time and perfect! You might need to add more milk depending on how thick / sweet you like your sauces. But let me tell you, the sauce went down a treat!

Love this simple white sauce base. I tweak it every once in a while to compliment the dish; replace milk with half and half, add a can of condensed mushroom soup, dash of garlic and Parmesan or dehydrated onion mix.  It's a great base to build on!

This is a good sauce-what I like about it is that it's a base for other sauces.  For a cheese sauce, just add cheese.  Definitely gonna be using this recipe again:)

Simple and versatile, a great starter sauce for any pasta. Alfredo isn't an option sinice Hubby doesn't like parmesan, so this is a nice alternative to the standard tomato sauce that the kids love.  A little salt & pepper, and some extra milk to thin it and it was perfect on bocconcini pasta (mini rigatoni).  Will use again and again!

My 1st time making a white sauce (bechamel) and this recipe made it so easy - thanks so much!  And thanks to the reviewer who said to double it if making a whole box of penne.  That is exactly what I did and it is indeed the perfect amount! :D  Oh...I did add seasonings, namely salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried parsley.  And I was aiming for a mac & cheese style dish so I whisked in grated parmesan, romano, and fontinella cheeses.

This year I've pledged to make dinner from scratch with my niece and nephew once a month. This time was mac and cheese, and I was hoping to find a cheese sauce recipe, rather than a baked mac, which would have been too "different" from boxed for their narrow pallates. I was nervous that I didn't get a chance to try it first, but I made it, (they cut up the ham and shredded the cheese) and it was a hit! My nephew who is a notoriously bad eater cleaned his plate!!! I used heavy cream instead of milk, and added deli ham and grated British cheddar, stirred over the heat, then immediately stirred it into the drained pasta. It was so easy, I'll avoid boxed M&C from now on! It was rather bland, but I plan to have fun and experiment with celantro and garlic, other herbs, and perhaps a stronger cheese.

Great base white sauce.  I use it for my Chicken Pot Pie and add 1 tablespoon of curry and proceed as usual.  I'm making Mac & Cheese for a party Sunday and am going to use this white sauce as a base for that.  As noted in many reviews, it can be used for lots of recipes and is good to have on hand.

This is a fabulous base white sauce. You can add anything to it for more specific flavoring depending on what you're using it with. Thanks for sharing! I've already used this multiple times for multiple reasons. :)

Excellent and super easy base with endless possibilities.  I added onion, garlic, baby peas, salt, and pepper after the milk.  Tossed the pasta with the sauce and sprinkled in some pine nuts.  Delicious!

I can't count the number of times I've used this recipe. I've added things and changed it up for almost any recipe. When I could only have lactaid milk, I used this recipe as a base for anything that called for cream of whatever soups as well as a sub for any type of white sauce. Thanks for posting this!

Made the perfect base for my experimental concauction that turned out GREAT! I added to this recipe 2 tbsp romano chese, a little bit of sprinkle chedar chese, some tomato sauce and a little dash of salt, I also added a little cracked peppercorn dressing....I had to use what I had available and it turned out to be a masterpiece better than ollive gardens creamy tomato sauce!

Is a good base for a white sauce.  I sauteed some finely diced shallots and garlic with the butter.  Then I added a couple dashes of salt and balck pepper to the final product.  Very tasty.

I literally pulled up this recipe while my pasta was cooking because i didn't feel like the red sauce I had the night before. It is so easy and so good! I added a little bit of Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning and minced garlic. It came out great! I also used whole wheat flour and whole wheat pasta for a little healthier meal.

Great base with endless options.  I have made this several times and usually just add fresh garlic and sometimes basil, salt and pepper.  It was very good on top of bowtie pasta with small pieces of (leftover) garlic fried chicken.

This is the recipe I am always calling my mother for, she adds nutmeg and pours it over blanched cauliflower.  Getting it from her is always confusing, she doesn't measure and I never get it right.  So glad to find it here!

I needed this recipe in a pinch, and was relieved to find it on this site.  Thank-you!!  I added Basil, Kosher salt, ground pepper, and 1 clove of garlic and served it with baked Talapia and white rice.  It is a new family favorite.  (Even with the two kids, 4 and 8.)

This is great but I really don't see what's original about this as you can find this recipe everywhere. Add a pinch or so of nutmeg to add more flavor and great for mediterranean dishes like moussaka or lasagne.

This is a must-have recipe for every cook as the variations are endless.  I made this into 'parsley butter' with the simple additions of salt, pepper and fresh parsley to accompany a ham for Easter dinner.  Thanks for reminding me that sometimes the basics are best!

Oh my word, this is a fantastic recipe!  So simple, so quick, and so tasty; just my style.

I whipped this up in a jiffy one night and was pleased with how it was so creamy and velvety.  Also, I added some fresh ground pepper/salt and voila, it was perfect for biscuits and gravy!

White sauce isn't sopposed to be THE flavor, it's the base. You add cheese or other ingredients to achieve the flavor you desire. 
Having said that, this is a wonderful basic white sauce recipe. My technique and the way I teach people to make it is a bit different. 
I melt butter with salt & pepper. If I'm adding onion, bell pepper etc. I do it now. When butter is melted, veggies softened I add the flour slowly whisking in in. I cook the flour mixture, stirring to cook the flour & eliminate the floury taste. After about 5 minutes slowly whisk in the milk. Continue to whisk or stir it as it thickens. Then you can add grated cheese or whatever your final destination indicates. Stir, keep over low heat & enjoy!

Perfect white sauce when you don't want a tomato base or something from a jar. Always have the ingredients on hand and I don't have to worry about using cream cheese or heavy cream.

Being a lazy cook, I am always looking for recipes with few ingredients. This white sauce is very simple, basic and very versatile. My husband and I like strong flavors so I added some fresh minced garlic to the butter before adding the flour. I also added some salt and went to town with the black pepper. It came out as good as what you'd get at a top restaurant.

excellent. yeah it's bland without much flavor and could easily be white gravy. but you add ANY flavor you want to it and it takes on the taste. i used some sweet and sour seasoning mix that was supposed to be fried on chicken or pork. the flavor was light and tasty. my family ate it up. next brown sauce. lol!!!

It was great as a base..I added pepper, salt, garlic powder, and one big mushroom, chopped up real good....put it over chicken that I saut√©ed with mushrooms, sweet peppers, onions, spices..and I cooked a roll of croissants - kept it flat for a base...kinda like flat chicken pot pie....It was delicious!!!

I was sceptical to say the least.  I could not find my usual packaged white sauce and with trepidation at Christmas was forced to try this from scratch. Fabulously easy, turned better than I could imagine.  I added cheese and a sprinkle of Tarragon...give it a try, if I can do it so can you!

I made this today for a quick lunch when my four year old said he wanted pasta. It turned out perfectly, and was quite good. I did add a little salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to spice it up a bit, otherwise it might have been a little bland. And to give it a cheesier flavor I added a little grated Parmesan cheese, too. Both of my boys ate it right up, and loved it. Because it is so easy and quick I will definitely be making this again since we always have these ingredients on hand. Thank you for sharing your recipe, CJO!

Well believe it or not I've never made my own white sauce-mainly because I can't do regular milk! However I gave this a go, using unsweetened coconut milk (Silk brand) It worked perfectly!  I added one clove fresh minced garlic and some basil pesto and some parm cheese. I had sauteed some veggies, so this was perfect with some angel hair pasta.

Excellent white sauce.  I doubled recipe and added grated parmesean cheese, italian seasoning and black pepper.  I loved that I was able to refrigerate leftover sauce and use in a different recipe a couple nights later.  It did thicken when cooled but reheated was back to original consistnecy.

Hooray for white sauce! I wanted to make a real live cheese sauce for broccoli like my Mum always made, and this turned out perfectly. I used to be her designated stirrer and cheese adder. I think I added about 6 oz. of grated cheddar. I will use this recipe base for all my sauces from now on. Pure nostalgia.

I added minced garlic, chicken bouillon (instead of salt), some poultry seasoning and a dash of paprika.  We had it over pasta, steamed chicken and cauliflower.  Yum.  Thanks for posting a recipe so easy even I was able to follow it.  (I tend to concoct, rather than cook.)

Tonight I was cooking carrots for dinner and remembered my mom making a white sauce for them.  Google brought me to this simple recipe.  It was EXACTLY as I remembered it... we put it on top of a serving of cooked carrots, and of course add salt.  I cannot wait to try some variations of this base sauce.

Good base as others have noted. Paired it with the ravoili recipe and added chives garlic and parsley. Yum. We also make it with canola oil instead of butter.

Simple, adaptable, perfect. I can't stand canned condensed soups, so whipping this super fast sauce up is a great alternative, and SO easy to customize. I normally add a little nutmeg, salt and pepper for a basic beschamel, but I've also added a spoonful of pesto for a flavorful twist in white lasagna. Delicious!

I love this recipe. It's basic and allows the chef to add a variety of spices without compromising the maleability of the sauce.

This is a very nice base white sauce. For pasta I add diced onions and garlic and grated Parmesan. Makes an excellent base for Mac n Cheese. This also makes a great gravy for biscuits and gravy. You can't go wrong with a B√©chamel sauce!

This is a great base for any white sauce.  It's just like what my mom used to make. I made cheese sauce with it by adding salt, pepper, and cheddar cheese.  It turned out great over my breaded chicken!  Yummy!

So easy that my 6 year old daughter made it for dinner.  We used unsalted butter, so had to add salt.  We also added a bit of onion powder and dry mustard.  Fantastic on our noodles, served with salmon burgers and mixed veggies.  My daughter's comment on the noodles, "it's my favorite food."

Fabulous flavor and texture!  Wonderful basic white sauce.  I added a pinch of salt and pepper and a dash of chicken bullion powder. I served mine over steamed veggies (zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, and onion) and rice. Delicious!  It was so good I was spooning it all on it's own before the veggies had finished cooking.

This is an incredible base for white sauce. Plus, it's much less expensive than store bought sauce. I added mozzerella cheese, salt, and pepper and had a delicious sauce that my husband loved.

v. good!  For a whole box of pasta I would triple recipe. I added fresh grated parmesan, garlic powder, chopped sun dried tomato and fresh basil - the fam loved it! I did have to add some red sauce b/c it wasn't enough and it was still great!

Good starting recipe... definitely need to make some additions to it, such as salt, pepper, white pepper, garlic powder, herbs, etc... my first time making it, I added all of what I suggest above^, and still seemed rather bland. Will try again, I'm sure its a great recipe with some tweaking.

Super easy; the first time I made a sauce. It was quite thick because I think I added a bit to much flour, but cuts easily with more milk, as the recipe suggests. Added garlic, salt, onion salt and bacon. Without it, it probably would have been a bit bland for my tastes.

When making for Mac n Cheese I add 1/4 cup minced onion to butter as it's melting. Then cook down onion for about a minute and a half before adding flour. Follow the directions as stated and then add black pepper, cheese but hold off on the salt till the end if it needs it. My cheese preference is smoked cheddar for a southern flare. If unavailable smoked paprika and regular cheddar will work in a pinch.

I made it for left over turkey. I added turkey to it and put it over mashed potato's family loved it. And was able to use the turkey left over from Christmas dinner. You can use chicken also. My mom used a white sauce for a lot of left overs.

So I have tried making this a few times and just never got the ratio to pasta right which was entirely my fault. Tonight I made the perfect amount with the pasta we had and it was amazing! I knew if I just stuck it out and kept trying I'd eventually get the portions right haha. The recipe itself is great, super simple and versatile which is exactly what I was looking for. If anyone is looking for a good replacement [and honestly better in my opinion] for alfredo, make this sauce [I used half and half cream because we don't ever have milk] along with garlic paste for flavour and just keep adding the paste to taste. It is amazing! Anyways, thanks for this really perfect base recipe for a white sauce.

Edit: I wanted to come back and edit this because I have been using this for my alfredo sauce in which I just add some garlic and salt to it, and tonight I used it to make scalloped potatoes! It has such a wide range of uses and it works out perfect every time. Glad I stumbled across this recipe! Super simple and easy to alter to make into whatever I need it to be.

Perfect white sauce! just what I was looking for. I only had 2% milk and at first I didn't think it was going to thicken, but it did and turned out nice and creamy. I used this for Chicken Pot Pie in the slow cooker. Thanks for this recipe!

I added 4 sticks of imitation crab to the sauce.  I  mixed it with linguini.  It was so basic, easy, and oh, so good.
Next, I'm thinking of using this sauce as a seafood Lasagna sauce, and with a seafood Enchilada recipe.

With being allergic to tomatoes and potatoes (basically the nightshade family) I've had to create my own sauces for pizza, spaghetti etc. This recipe is the base of all the sauces mixed with fresh herbs and spices for whichever meal I'm preparing.

Great sauce. I however alter the mix with fried onions, thyme, garlic and sweet basil. We then pour over thinly sliced potatoes and ham.

I add chocolate, sugar and vanilla flavoring to make a chocolate gravy and serve over biscuits.  Sometimes I leave out the chocolate for a vanilla gravy.  My kids loved this growing up.

The first batch I made took a little while to combine, but it would have been really good! I unfortunately had to dump it due to the pan I way using. (The inner coating started flaming off while I mixed and I didn‚Äôt want to risk anything) 
The second time it didn‚Äôt come together at all though. If I was successful I‚Äôm sure it would have been wonderful.

I used this as a base sauce tonight. I added some roasted garlic & spinach. A little salt and pepper and my word it was so heavenly. Even my picky 4 year old cleaned her plate. Going to try using it as a base for a cream enchilda sauce next.

My first time making white sauce from scratch and this was a perfect starter! I always read the reviews to get tips on the recipes and I am glad I did! I added garlic salt and some black pepper, turned off the heat and mixed in some shaved parmesan cheese as well as some Kraft 5 cheese Italian blend. it was so creamy and good!

I think it's great. This recipe is just giving you the start to making your own sauce! In my picture it looks almost ranch-y but is one of my best tasting sauces yet! I used 8tbs butter and equal parts flour. I then added 1tbs of minced garlic and 1-2tsp of thyme, oregano and basil. About 2tsp of onion powder. After that I added about 2 cups of milk, maybe more depending on how thick. I had to add some salt to bring it all together. For someone who doesn't know what they're doing (me) I added things I thought were yummy and I'm very pleased with how it came out. (I made a LOT of sauce! Enough for a few hearty servings of pasta.)

Simply the best.  This is the absolute in a base white sauce. I wanted a simple white sauce, adding nothing but salt and pepper and it was so good.  You can add anything to this sauce to suite all sorts of different recipes.  It's not bland, you make it into what you want.  Excellent recipe.

This is a good, basic cream sauce.  I have made it three times, loved it.  Tastes good if you add salt and pepper to taste, then spoon it over pork tenderloin.

I added bullion (a couple cubes/to taste) with the milk and stirred in a few slices of cheese at the end.  This was enjoyed over vegetables, grilled chicken and of course, biscuits!  My 7 year old boys loved it.

I, too, learned how to make white sauce in 7th grade home ec class and, until today, 53 years later, I never made it!  I made the recipe as is except cut it in half and added cheese.  I poured it over noodles and tuna.  It was delicious!  I will make it again!

A great base sauce to use when you have pasta and no sauce on hand. Easy to make!

It was a great base. I added a jalape√±o pur√©e & it was perfect! Poured it over some ground beef. Delicious.

I am about to make this sauce, but definitely it needs some salt, to be adjusted depending on the other ingredients this sauce will be combined into.

Very simply and easy recipe that is a great base. I made it and added salt, pepper, and dried rosemary to taste and then mixed in chicken (or turkey) and put it over some puff pastry or bisque to for a nice and easy meal. The sauce had a perfect consistency without me having to add any extra milk and it barely took any time to make. Though for more then one person (two depending on how much they eat) I'd suggest doubling the recipe to make sure you have enough for everyone.

This is one of the five  classical mother sauces, B√©chamel in culinary terms. Add cheese and you have Morney. Add Parmesan and garlic and you have  Alfredo. Etc, etc...

Basic sauce. I added Cheddar and parmesan cheese w dried basil and oregano. I added more milk to thin it out some as well, but I think the leftover pasta water would've worked as well. I will probably add some hot sauce and garlic.

This is a fool proof base recipe. 

I added 1/4 c grated Parmesan, 2 tbs lemon juice,  2 tbs chopped dill and 1 fillet of steamed salmon. Served it over pasta. Yummy.

Great base. I doubled the recipe and added minced garlic to saut√© while I melted the butter. Parmesan cheese, sundried tomatoes, parsley flakes, couple shakes of nutmeg, white pepper, and tore up some fresh basil. I also added more milk to thin it a little more as it was pretty thick. This was SOOOOOOO good!

Very good base recipe! We are on a low carb diet, so I substitute the flour for flax seed meal and the milk for half-n-half and heavy whipping cream. I love to add a cup, or more, of cheddar cheese and use it as a cheese sauce over our broccoli. It is delicious!!!

Easy recipe. Was looking for a way to make "country gravy" and modified this recipe a little. I added course pepper to taste and two chicken bullion cubes to the flour and butter, cooked it until it began to brown, added milk and wisked until smooth.  Worked pretty well.....got compliments from the family.

Quick and easy. I added a 1/2 tsp crushed rosemary and served it over ready-made, frozen panko chicken breasts. Yum! I may add a dash of salt next time.

I haven't quite figured this one out yet. Every time I try the flour and butter clump. Even with water..just looks like mashed potatoes. I always end up trying 2 or 3 times and then just straining it out.

It was pretty bland and definitely could have used some salt, pepper, and other seasonings. Overall, it was a very easy recipe and can definitely be changed to taste, but it could use a few changes. I served this at a dinner party and everyone piled on loads of salt and pepper, so make sure you taste it before it is served to guests.

Excellent base!  Criminally easy to make, and there are so many things that can be done with it  (My family finds the addition of cheese fantastic).  And because it's just a bit bland, it's great to experiment with - goes well with just about any spice you add.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight! I had leftover chicken and rice and didn't want to eat it "dry." I made this white sauce, and added parmesan cheese. Yum! The leftovers passed over by everyone else in my family were suddenly what everyone wanted a bite of. What a difference a sauce makes!

This recipe is an ideal "base" recipe. Once the butter was melted I added minced garlic (1 clove) and about a tbs of freshly chopped parsley for about 30 seconds before adding the flour. This added a little bit of flavour without making it too overpowering. I also used 3/4 c milk and 1/4 c heavy cream because I had it in the house and it needed to be used anyway. Overall, great recipe to add onto with your own favourite flavours!

This was so simple to make! I made crepes with a crawfish filling, and did 1 1/2 batches of the sauce. I mixed in 1/2 with the crawfish, onions, celery, garlic, and cajun seasoning. I used the same ingredients for the sauce, but switched the ratio of crawfish:sauce, and toned down the seasoning a little. My boyfriend LOVED it! Thanks for a simple, basic recipe for the sauce base!

I've used this recipe for years. I make it in the microwave in a measuring cup and use it as a substitute for the dread can of cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup. When it's cream of chicken I add a bit of chicken bouillon which also adds the salt.

My mom added a can of tuna to this sauce and called it creamed tuna which was served over toast for dinner. I wonder if the older people remember the canned white sauce by Aunt Penny. Homemade white sauce is so wonderful with different cheeses added.

Great started for white sauce.  I use it for chipped beef on toast and add salt, pepper and a few shakes of hot sauce.  So versatile, you can add anything to make it what you want.

I wish more people on AllRecipes would search for "roux" because I'm constantly seeing recipes that look good, and then I stop right away when I see "1 can of cream of  soup". Dumping a can of soup on top of something else isn't a recipe, it's cheating. Do they even know what's in that stuff? Stop and read the ingredients, people. It's not cooking, and it's certainly not healthy. Make a roux. The video accompanying this recipe should be able to help even the worst cooks.

I was looking for a good base for a sausage pasta using ingredients I had on hand and this worked great. Browned up some pork sausage with onion, garlic, italian seasoning and crushed red pepper; added s&p and grated parmesan to the white sauce and tossed with linguine and had an easy meal. Thanks!

This was in an old 1960s cookbook I can't find. For breakfast, cook sausage and use 2 Tblsp drippings instead of butter. Add some pepper and pour over hot biscuits. 1 Tblsp flour and shortening gives a thin sauce and 3 Tblsp a thick one. Use water premixed with flour in place of milk for making turkey or chicken gravy.

Perfect base recipe. As is, the sauce is quite bland, but with a few extras it becomes a delicious sauce. I added garlic powder, black pepper and parmesan cheese, and served it over penne pasta. Very good.

Great recipe, really easy. I was out of milk so I used heavy whipping cream (ended up using ~1 1/2 cups). Added some salt, pepper, sriracha, and 1/4 bag mexican style cheese, and then mixed it into half a box of rotini, some spinach, and a can of tuna for some loaded mac n cheese. Only way it could have been better was if I'd had some bacon.

Wonderful! I use this for macaroni and cheese all the time. I add whatever cheeses I have on hand and eyeball, stir, and taste. As another reviewer said, double this for a full (13.25oz) box of pasta. Tonight I used Smart Balance, half and half, 1lb of frozen broccoli, wheat elbows, and a mix of cheddar and feta. I top with some Panko and either Parmesan or just sprayed with cooking spray to brown.  Delicious as always. Thank you for the recipe!

This is also a great base for a vanilla sauce I use on Pumpkin cream cheese cake.  You just add sugar and vanilla.  That simple.
Good to use for cheese sauce, just add grated cheddar and grated Parmesan.  Any good cheese that will melt make for tasty veg topping or mac and cheese. YUM

I remember white sauce being used with many vegetables such as corn, peas, mixed vegetables, lima beans, etc. Also, Moms would mix up a batch of white sauce and add canned vegetables for a quick vegetable soup. Chipped beef or fried hamburger was added to white sauce for gravy.  Add a little salt and pepper to the white sauce and this recipe is perfect. Thanks for sharing a forgotten  favorite.

I added a tea spoon of VEGETA Gourmay Stock yum. I made mine in a microwave jug on high; one minute stir, further 30 seconds it was done. Being an oldie on my own I tend to use the Microwave a lot.

This sauce was fantastic!! I live in Africa and was looking for something new to spice up pasta, but simple and easy for me to get basic ingredients. I sauteed fresh garlic,tomatoes, onions and sausage and added to the sauce. It was Awesome!!

This sauce is wonderful! It is a great base :)

 I added a crushed garlic clove, basil, parsley, pepper, salt, and a bit of parmesean cheese, like suggested. I then mixed it with pasta and it was a wonderfully cheesy dinner! 

I also use this basic recipe with margarine instead of butter and soy milk- 1/2 as much) as a substitute for cheese in quiches when I cook non-dairy; i just cook it down until it is a thick consistency. It tastes amazing and has wonderful texture.

My first time doing white sauce! I was really scared that it wouldn't thicken, and at first it didn't. So I just added an additional tb. of flour and it got nice and creamy. From there I added salt and pepper and stirred in 1 cup of shredded mozzarella. The sauce got pretty thick so I then whisked in another 1/2 cup milk (I used skim, btw) and the consistency was perfect. I don't eat dairy, but everyone told me it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Supremely inexpensive and easy to make. It is so versatile that you can add cheese or onion or pasta or bacon or chicken or tomato or all of the above and you can't go wrong. Next time I want to add butternut squash and cardamon for a fall flavor.

Great basic recipe.  I substituted whole wheat flour instead of the white so my "white sauce" was more of a light beige-ish sauce but the taste was still great.  Served it over pasta with salmon and it was the perfect side.

Great base recipe. It can be used in several dishes. I sauteed garlic with olive oil instead of butter, once ready I added a lot of fresh grated parmesan cheese and black pepper and served over whole wheat spaguetti.

This sauce can be used as the base for many dinners. I double the sauce recipe and add cut up cooked chicken or turkey. Serve over rice or toast, it's one of my kids' favorite meals.

My husband said it was the best white sauce I had ever made. I added a little cheddar and parmesan cheese along with some freshly ground pepper. This is a keeper for sure.

I love recipes that you can experiment with! I ended up putting some fresh basil and adding it to some whole wheat pasta.
I felt like a superstar!

I agree with another poster, this is a MUST know, teach your children this one! It is the basic elements and you build on it anyway you like...you will never buy this again from a store!I have added all sorts of yummy spices, seasonings and goodies to it.

Oh my goodness, this white sauce base was sooooo easy.  I had always thought white sauce was very difficult and it would get lumpy etc.  This was perfect!!!  I would normally use cream, yet this was much healthier with milk.  Thanks sooo much for sharing.  This is a FAB FAB base.  I added salt, pepper, garlic, mixed dry herbs and a cup of cheese, and made it into the yummiest cheese sauce.  Thanks!!!  :)

For a nice sauce over fish, instead of milk use half 10% cream and half chicken stock. Sprinkle in some dill and fresh ground pepper. 
My husband is gluten intolerant, so I substitute potato flour for the wheat flour and it works just fine.

Such a simple recipe!  I made it once and then came home and made it again with the ingredients from my head.  It definitely needs a little peppercorn spice or something of the likes...  It hardly has any flavor at all as given in the recipe

Very nice white sauce. My kids always like "red" sauce on their sphagetti but this time they said they loved the "white sauce".  The texture is just perfect for the seashell pasta. I didn't even add salt and it tasted great. Thanks for the great recipe.

GREAT!  This base is fantastic for so many things... just add the spices/cheese/etc to adjust the taste.  I have used this in all types of cuisine.  I have even used this as a sub for the "cream of this or that soup," which is called for in a lot of the quick fix recipes.  Easy to tweek, easy to make, and I know what's in it.  THANKS!

Wonderful base, I added 4 ounces of brie cheese with walnuts and a tablespoon of fresh minced dill, at the very end, used it over some grilled prawns and it was supurb. Like other posters suggested, this is just a basic sauce to start with you flavor it to your taste.

I would rate this a 5 star if it was perfect as written. It is the exact texture and thickness I was looking for, but it definately needs some spices and salt because it is bland otherwise written. Thanks for the base!

Love this recipe, But i sujest you heat the milk before you add it, that helps break down the flour. I use it with Lasagna, I just mix it with a tomato based veggi or meat sauce, then  layer as you would any Lasagna. Add a little pepper and salt. You can use this to make croquets too.

An excellent sauce!  I throw in a little salt, pepper, and white cooking wine.  I also pour it over cooked pasta, mix in some home-made tomato sauce, top with a variety of cheeses, and bake it in the oven for a few minutes. Trust me, everyone will love it!

Great!  Very simple base for tons of  culinary creations. I started by adding 1/4 tsp of salt + pepper, added a bunch of shredded parmesian and mozarella and a little bit of basil and put it over some pasta. Excellent. Can't wait to try something different with it next.
