This wasn't bad. I added a bit more sherry instead of the rum. I was worried I wouldn't have enough sauce for my pasta so I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup of milk near the end just to make a bit more. This may just be because I reduced the serving size for 1 instead of 4. I cooked up a pork chop in the pan before making the sauce, but I think next time I may just cook the meat in the sauce.

ok. Didnt have any rum. Added garlic. Not worth all the effort of making homemade sauce.

We really liked this recipe. I have made it a few times. After the first time I now skip the rum.
