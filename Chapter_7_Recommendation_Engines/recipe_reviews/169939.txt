I think I may have misunderstood the directions.  I had some garden jalapenos to get rid of and tried this recipe on them.  I am guessing the peppers need to be pickled first?  Did not work on fresh peppers.  Needs clarification.

I had these at a party and they were absolutely delicious! When some friends and I asked the host how to make them he told me he would sell us a jar at 20 a jar. We all laughed at him thinking he was kidding but he wasn't. The last laugh is on him because now I can make my own and hand the recipe out! Thank you for this FREE recipe!

I couldn't find a large jar of these but bought a large can at sams club. I drained some of the juice off and added the 5 pound bag of sugar and heated it on the stove until all the sugar dissolved. After they cooled some I put them in smaller canning jars and made sure that the peppers were covered with the juice. I put them in the fridge for a week and they were delicious. I didn't flip the jars over daily because the sugar was dissolved and the jar was full of juice. They were a HIT!!!

I despise when people leave a low rating on a recipe because THEY misread or misunderstood! This recipe is perfect we make it with sliced jalapenos and it's delicious. Thank you!

I made this simply because I had left over jalapenos and was not going to waist them. I made this thinking I would probably never enjoy it. I mean sugar and jalapenos? yuck! Well today I finally opened that jar that had been sitting in the back of my fridge for two weeks. I did what the others did and used it on crackers and cream cheese. This was amazingly good. I will say that I found I needed to get as much liquid as possible off of the jalapenos before putting on top of the cream cheese. Otherwise it was too sweet for my taste buds. I can't believe this tasted so good especially when I expected it to taste pretty bad. I'm glad I tried it! Also if you wanted to make a spread you could just add the peppers to the creamed cheese and mix. If you were planning on making a bunch of little cracks that would probably be the way to go.

I made 1/2 gallon due to not being able to find a gallon this morning at the store one of my friends brought some of these to work with crackers and cream cheese and I could not stay out of break area. If there was a 10 star this would get it.

So easy and so good - we had cans of sliced jalapenos that I'd forgotten what I even bought them for... we're not huge jalapeno fans and tested this on a whim but THESE ARE ADDICTIVE! We served on a cheese tray and these on top of a simple cracker with cream cheese and venison sausage are SO YUMMY!!! I scaled back to 5 servings to just test one can; we love these so much we'll be making some to keep in the fridge all the time - can't wait to try on a sandwich or in potato salads - oooo - tuna salad! Thanks!!!

these were amazing. I only had a 16 oz jar of sliced jalapeno peppers so added just over 1 cup of sugar. I recommend pouring off some of the liquid and adding the sugar to the jalapenos in a separate bowl. Add jalapenos back to the original container and add back what ever liquid that will fit in jar. We served over cream cheese with wheat thins. Our friends loved them!!

I did not follow the recipe but used it for the right proportions. I wanted something quicker than a week. I used two small cans of diced jalapenos and 5oz of sugar - combined over heat until boiling; let it cool and spread over cream cheese and dipped pretzel in it. Delish! I will definitely give the original recipe a try.

OMG! You know something is good when everyone goes back for more and the only leftovers are hidden so no one else finds these bites of heaven. And you'll be asked for the recipe which is so easy! Hardest part was waiting a week to try them but worth it!

After making this and living with it in my fridge for a month I wonder how I ever lived without this staple? It goes on/in everything! I put these in sandwiches on crackers toss a few in a bowl when I eat popcorn... What did I ever do without candied jalapenos in my life?

This is a very easy recipe and very yummy! I made them in the larger jar then poured them into smaller jars to give my co-workers as Christmas gifts. My aunt's always made this recipe and brought it to family gatherings. It's so addictive!

My husband and our sons love candied jalapeños. The guys relish when the jalapeños are sticky and the syrup is super thick.  I make a simple syrup from the sugar and pickling juice after it has fermented. My sons like to use a bit of the syrup in their martinis and float a jalapeño on the top. My husband uses them for a garnishment with his bloody Marys.  I serve an open jar with a bowl of whipped cream cheese and buttery crackers.

These are so good on a variety of things. Be careful breathing the vapor from the juice it will choke you up.

I used the recipe as written, except for the size.  I used a 16oz jar of jalapeños and scaled down the the sugar equally.  I put the finished result in my cuisinart, to make something similar to a relish.  Now, I can’t have a hotdog without it!  Fabulous recipe, and SO easy.

These were great! I did buy a jar of HOT jalapenos next time I will make sure to not to buy those as they were very hot but still great!
