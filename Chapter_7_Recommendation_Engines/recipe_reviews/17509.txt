This cake tasted like a cross between angel food and butter cake.  It rose up perfectly and I did not think it too sugary as others thought. I dripped a chocolate glaze over it  and it tasted great.  I will make it again but I might experiment with adding more butter for a more  tender cake.  Though the glaze went really good with this, I'm thinking that the firm texture may not go well with frosting.  This recipe really came through for me as I racked my resources looking for a cake that was fast, easy and didn't eatup all my groceries.  Thank You.

I was in the mood for a good rich cake, but not in the mood for a big mess, and this cake was convenient. Plus I don't like adding tons of butter, so the recipe was really friendly to me. It has the taste of ladyfingers. I noticed it had a nice firm texture, so I thought it would hold up great in milk. I drenched the cooked cake in normal milk and it tastes just like a tres leches cake. The cake was a bit sweet, but adding the milk made the sweetness just right. I will use this as my base cake when I am in the mood for tres leches.

This makes a great cupcake. I found it a little too sweet on it's own, but with a cup of coffee it was a perfect after-dinner treat. And hey, it didn't need frosting of any kind so it was perfect.

This is an awesome cake.  It was very simple to make.  My family loved it, and so did I which is a really BIG compliment because I don't usually like cake.  When I made this cake I put strawberries between the layers.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Great, versatile cake ... made it twice in a week. I like you can frost it different ways.  Be sure to use Baking POWDER and check after 28 minutes.  I also find it so easy to increase it by 1/3 in quantity... to get a bigger cake if needed (for ex: 6 eggs, 3 C flour, but kept only 2 C sugar since I like lower-sugar). VERY Good. I will also use this for cupcakes... ingredients usually on hand.
