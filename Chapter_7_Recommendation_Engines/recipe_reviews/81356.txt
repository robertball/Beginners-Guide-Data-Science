This was really good and easy.  I just used my rice cooker and cooked it as I normally would (one cup rice, 2 cups water), but added in the seasoning from the recipe.  Turned out great!  Next time I will chop up the peanuts a little more.

I actually just ate this for a light dinner. It was very good, I did make a few changes though. I used some leftover Brazilian White Rice from this site (which I did make with white basmati rice). Also, I didnt have any tumeric, and I added a splash of soy sauce. And I chopped the peanuts pretty finely. It was very good. I'll have to get some tumeric so I can try is as is :)

Took the advice of some other reviewers and added more salt and chopped the peanuts up well. I also nearly doubled the peas and prepared mine in a rice cooker. Excellent side dish with beautiful color. We had this with curried lentils and they worked very well together.

I used jasmine rice for this recipe (which is what I had on hand).  Instead of putting in the peas, I got a Green Giant frozen package (10 oz box) of peas, mushrooms with an herbed flavor packet to mix in, which I combined with the rice and topped with almond slivers.  The result was yummy.

Not bad, found it bland. Added crunchy peanut butter instead of peanuts. Adds more flavour!

This is a pretty yummy way to make rice.... it does seem like it could use some sort of sauce over it, but I haven't figured out what would go well with it and still be pretty healthy.

I used brown rice instead of basmati rice.  I omitted the salt.  This is delicious!

This is very yummy. It is very simple and a great side dish.  We had this with the buter bean burger recipe found on this site. They went well together.

Very good, but lacked a little something, like green onion or soy sauce. Served this with Ginger Salmon. Would make this again.

Really easy and yummy! I forgot to grab peanuts at the store, so I substituted slivered Almonds instead and it turned out just fine. It could have used a bit more flavor, so next time i'm adding more salt, but all-in-all, a really good way to make rice. I'll definitely be making this again!

I used white rice for this recipe because I didn't have basmati rice, and it was fine. It was actually very tasty, and a nice plain rice substitute. It went really well with the red lentil curry - my first successful Indian cooking! Hooray!

Made it with black eyed peas since I didnâ€™t have peas and it tasted pretty good. I also added scallions at the end. Will try with peas next time.

Added Garlic and Garlic Salt and replaced Peanuts with Sliced Almonds and Peas with Diced Carrots. Wife LOVED it!

This is a pretty good recipe!  I use this as a basis whenever I need to use up leftover rice.   However, I much prefer it with curry powder instead of turmeric.

I did not have any peas on hand, so I used baby lima beans as a substitute & followed the recipe completely for all other ingredients.  I was amazed that this is so simple & so delicious!  I loved the texture & taste & will definitely make again!!  Thanks.

The rice was a good accompaniment to the roasted chicken we had. Because of some of the reviews, I did make sure to season the rice more than the recipe called for, even using chicken broth instead of water. I chopped up the peanuts so that there was even more of a peanut flavour throughout. A good side dish overall!

I think using dry roasted peanuts is essential. I used a little basmati and some arborio (ran out of basmati) and it was just fine. The turmeric adds a beautiful color. I also added some freshly chopped carrots. It was a great, simple side dish.
