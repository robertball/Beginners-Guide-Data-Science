The concept was great but the flavor wasn't really balanced.    I added 4 tsp balsamic vinegar, 2 tsp brown sugar, and used garlic salt rather than himalayan salt and it was AMAZING.  I only used 4 habaneros and it was plenty spicy.  It was good with pork but I REALLY loved it with tortilla chips.  I think it would be delicious with fish as well.
