I followed the directions precisely, and the rice stayed just as crunch as it was when I poured it out of the box.   My family ate it the first night, then refused to touch it again. Next time I'll try preparing the rice before adding it, if my family will give it another chance.

This was so good! Reminded me of a dish my mom made with rice and beef and she called them Porcupine Balls.  It was a Sunday Dinner hit!

This was a nice change from my regular meat loaf.  The rice added a nice texture.  There wasn't a lot of flavor though and next time I think I will add some additional spice to give it a little more kick.  
Also, some of my rice on the edges got crunchy.  This may be because I didn't bake it in a loaf pan.  If I do make again I will try a loaf pan to see if it helps.
My husband and 14 month old both seemed to like it a lot and neither noticed the crunch rice.

I made this last night and while it had very good flavor it was too dry, although I made it exactly as recipe indicated.I think it needs some liquid added to it. I will definately make this again adding a cup or so of tomato juice. My nine year old son loved it and he hates meatloaf.

A little on the bland side (easily spiced up tho') -but it is the only meatloaf my daughter will eat, and that makes it a winner in this house.

My sister used to make something similar with the canned spanish rice (that we haven't been able to finad in Arkansas/Oklahoma anymore for some reason).  She just mixed it & the meat, covered it with golden mushroom soup, I loved it!  I made the packaged rice, chopped onion, one egg, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  I put a thin layer of salsa on top, then the golden mushroom & added cheese the last few minutes...it was good, but not my favorite, my husband really liked it though.

This was pretty good. I did make a few changes however. I added 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup salsa and this made it moist. It did not hold well but was moist. The rice was fine excpet for the pieces on top of the meat they were dry of course but expected that. Wil make again. Also added garlic powder and worch. sauce

The flavor was good but it was a little dry. I'll make it again but I think I'll add some salsa for a little extra zip and to help moisten it up a little

SOUNDS GREAT I THINK I WILL USE LEFT OVER RICE AND SOME EXTRA SEASONNG.  I THINK COOKING THE RICE FIRST AND LETTING IT COOL OVER NIGHT IN THE FRIDGE WILL GIVE IT JUST THE RIGHT CONSISTANCEY.  I ALWAYS ADD EXTRA EGGS TO REALLY HOLD MY MEAT LOAF TOGETHER SO I AM GOING TO TRY THAT ALSO.

While the flavor on this was good, I also had trouble getting the rice to soften. I even tried having it covered in foil for the first 45 minutes to kind of steam up (I do this for porcupine meatballs), but that didn't help enough. The texture was kind of funny for my kids as a result. I might try this again and experiment, but not any time soon.

I made as directed but like some of the written reviews, the rice was hard and crunchy and using lean ground beef made it dry. Flavor was decent as I used Zatterands Spanish rice. I might try again using 20/80 fat percentage ground beef,and 98% lean and cooking the rice mix first before adding the the ground beef mixture.
