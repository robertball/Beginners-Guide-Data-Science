I made this recipe for this past Thanksgiving, but I forgot to review it.  I doubled the recipe but instead of using two packages of cherry jello, I used one cherry and one cranberry.  Otherwise, I made it exactly according to the recipe.  It was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner.  I didn't even think I liked whole cranberry sauce, but I've changed my mind after this recipe.  My family has had gelatin salads at every holiday meal my entire life, and we all think this is the best one.  My daughter asked me to make it for every holiday meal from now on.  Since she loved it so much I'm going to make it for her birthday this week.  I'll try making it lighter, using low-fat, sugar-free ingredients where possible.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  UPDATE:  We loved it just as much this time around.  In fact, my daughter has nicknamed it "edible paradise" and says she is addicted.  Again I used one package of cherry gelatin and one package of cranberry gelatin.  I also used fat-free cream cheese and sugar-free gelatin, and we couldn't really tell any difference in the taste.

Lot's of potential. I also found it way too sweet but it was good enough to make some notes to try again some time. This time I had a bag of cranberries leftover so I made whole cranberry sauce to add to the gelatin instead of the canned. I ended up adding a bit more of the juice to the cream cheese to make it a bit more spreadable and flavorful (total of about 1/2 c). I also used walnuts instead of peacans. Next time I will try one box of gelatin and half the crushed pineapple. One note.... it took a lot longer than 10 minutes for the first layer to firm up. Maybe that was because I used home made cranberry sauce, not sure, but it eventually firmed just fine. Thanks!

I made this today for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. What I liked best about it was it's something different. I followed the directions exactly and don't think I would change a thing. I put it an 8x8 clear square dish and it fit perfectly and looked nice.  I would point out the recipe doesn't say to let the first layer set for 10 minutes as some have said. It says let the first layer set, then spread the cream cheese mixture over that and refrigerate THAT for 10 minutes before putting the rest of the jello mixture on top.

A beautiful cranberry salad to display in a clear bowl. Many compliments around the table!  Definitely a keeper! The first layer does take more than 10 minutes to set. I also used 1 box sugar free and 1 box sugared jello.  Cream cheese center was a little hard to spread, but not a problem if you wait for first layer to really set (maybe 1/2 hour depending on bowl shape.  Excellent!

This recipe was so good!  The only thing I changed was to use a box of cherry jello and a box of raspberry instead of two cherries.  This was completely finished off at our Thanksgiving meal.  And that's saying something considering there was a TON of food with lots of choices.  I'll definitely be making this again all year round!

We absolutely loved this salad. I will be making it again for Thanksgiving. I did pour just a little more pineapple juice into the cream cheese mixture, but not much. The cream cheese layer is alot easier to spread if it's at room temp, or even warmed up a bit in the microwave. This fit perfectly in an 7 x 11" glass pan. Would need to double recipe if you want it in a 9 x 13". It's so good, I'm sure it would get eaten if you doubled it!

I love this recipe! I leave out the mayonnaise though and I don't think it makes a huge difference. I also only make two layers, and I put the chopped walnuts in to the Jello. I also add about 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese and pineapple juice. It comes out so nice and creamy. This disappears every time I make it.

This was very tasty!    But it yields a HUGE amount - it's like a double recipe and would fill two regular sized salad molds.  Unless I were bringing this dish to a very large banquet, for the typical up to 10 person family dinner next time I would definitely cut the recipe in half.

Made this in a trifle bown and it was beautiful!!  The cherry jello was just way too overwhelming for us in this!  I think this would be a 5 star recipe if it actually tasted like cranberry.  I'll be making this again...next time I'll use cranberry or raspberry jello though!

I love this salad if you can call it a salad.  It's a dessert to me and it is so refreshing and yummy.  I put it into a plastic mold and added green food coloring to the cream cheese mixture.  It made a nice Christmas presentation.

Yummy is all I can say to this.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner for my friends and family and it was a hit.  I didn't have any pecans, but the result was still delicious.  I was even asked for the recipe.  Will make again!

Made this for a Labor Day Picnic and it was a hit.  It wasn't terribly sweet and the color was festive next to the salads.  I used the smaller can of pineapple and it worked just fine.  Easy to make!

I was a little surprised at how this tasted.  IT is a beautiful side dish, put it in a clear container for everyone to see.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't taste as good as it looks.  The pecans to me seem out of place, I think it would have been better without it.  And it has a very strong, pineapple-like taste.  Persons liking traditional cranberry sauce probably should avoid as this is very different. Everybody jumped all over this because of the appearance, then didn't finish what they got.  Also it was very hard to spread the creamcheese/pecan mixture over the first layer of jello, came out very lumpy and uneven.  I may try again without the pecans.  Does look very festive though.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I followed the recipe and instructions but my family thought it was terrible. The pecans in it was probably the worst.  Thanks anyways
