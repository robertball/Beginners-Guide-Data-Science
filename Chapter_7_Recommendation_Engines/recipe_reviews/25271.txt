This is a really easy recipe to make macaroni and cheese! I made a few changes, though. I left out the mustard powder, Swiss cheese, and sherry. I also added a lot of cheddar cheese (1 cup mild or 3/4 cup sharp.) I have made this many times (at least 5) for easy macoroni and cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Loved this recipe!!! I found it to be very easy and not time consuming at all. Although first time trying I admit that I tweeked it a bit by adding a 1/3 cup more of sherry, 1 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and 2 cups Kraft finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Once butter is melted on low heat, I found that by turning the heat up to med./low you must stir and watch carefully after adding the initial ingredients and before adding cheeses as the mixture will lump up terribly. Should this happen don't dump and start over, simply stir a bit vigorously mashing out any lumps that have formed for about 5 min. once mixture is smooth again you can begin to add your cheeses and lower the heat some and continue to stir. I found that if you add too much cheese such as the cheddar it may be a bit too much taste wise, but adding some extra milk not too much will get it just right. Poured it over some steamed broccoli and it was simply "DELISH"...Thanks So Much Glen. Can't wait to try it again!!!

I halved this, and only used cheddar cheese (medium) as it was all I had. Very nice, mellow cheese sauce. Will definitely make again.

This is a pretty good recipe - the instructions on making the roux / white sauce are sorely lacking.  Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour & spices until smooth, then continue to cook and stir until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Gradually stir in the milk / sherry so that no lumps form and then simmer until thick, stirring the whole time.

I didn't have sherry, so i used a dry white wine.  It was too winey tasting.  I would omit the alchohol next time.

I followed the advice of Lady Jaypee and doubled the cheese. I also added a splash of Worchestershire sauce. I omitted the salt. Nice sauce for my broccoli. Thanks Glen!

This recipe is well done, with a more "gourmet" flavor than the typical cheese sauce.  The mustard, and particularly the Swiss cheese and sherry (I used dry sherry, not cooking sherry) all contributed to a more elegant sauce.  Still, this was not something we were particularly crazy for - not on our broccoli anyway.  Actually, this would be an excellent fondue with crostini or rye chips.

We really enjoyed this delicately-flavored sauce. I wanted a thicker sauce so doubled (or maybe 3x) the cheese.  Had to use all cheddar as my Swiss gruyere was frozen! I think the Swiss, combined with the sherry, would be really good too. Served over steamed cauliflower.  Thanks for the recipe, Glen.  I'll use this one again!

EXCELLENT! I used this sauce for a ham and scallop dish that guests raved about.  Didn't have sherry on hand and used about 3 c of mixed cheeses.  Turned out very creamy and delicious thank you for a great basic cheese sauce recipe.

Yummy. I didn't have dry mustard so I just used regular mustard. I didn't have sherry so I used white wine. I wanted a cheesy cheddar sauce for broccoli on top of potatoes so I omitted the swiss and put 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. Delicious!

This was really good. I added extra cheddar so it was  3/4 c each of cheddar and Swiss/needed a little more cheese to balance out all the sherry.....but only a minor tweak.

Yummy sauce.  Of course on this site, no one makes anything to spec.  I used only cheddar as I had no swiss.  I also had no dry mustard, but I put in a squirt of Grey Poupon.  I have no idea if that is similar but it added a nice zest!  I put this on broccoli and baked chicken, and it was delicious both ways!

This is the perfect cheese sauce! We use only sharp Cheddar instead of Swiss. My children will happily eat any veggie if I mix it with pasta and top it with this sauce. I have also added ground turkey to the pasta, veggies, and sauce, to make a quick and easy dinner.

Love, Love, Love it!  I have been making essentially this same sauce, minus the Sherry,  for years, I'm always experimenting with the cheeses, so I came here to look for ideas for different cheeses to try.  Adding the Sherry made all the difference!  I made my basic 60/40 Swiss/Cheddar blend and it was fabulous. It's a much more sophisticated flavor.   I'll (almost)never make my bechamel without the Sherry again.  I think even when a more subtle sauce is needed you can just adjust the amount of the Sherry.  Thank you Glen for helping me kick Grandmas green bean casserole up a notch!

I loved this over broccoli. But I wasn't paying attention to the amount it makes!! So after using it for the veggies I used on leftover taco meat for quick nachos and then I tried for mac and cheese. Really good basic gooey cheesy sauce. I did use an extra handfull of grated cheddar. And I sprinkled a little more cheese in the mac and cheese.

I'm giving it three for effort. Although my sauce thickened properly, it came out grainy. The flavor was not apealing as well, which I found odd because I like sherry in food. Perhaps it needed to be cooked longer.

I had made this today and it was great... I never had any sherry but I will pick some up at the store this weekend and will try to see if it adds more flavor... I used only old cheddar in this but might try it with both chesses next time... I served it on the Norwegian Flat Bread from this site with sliced up steak with veggies (green pepper/onion/mushrooms... Was great but just thought it was missing that little zing to it.

I did not use sherry and cut the recipe down. Very easy to prepare and was still great after my amendments. I thought it went well over mixed vegetables and used it as a "fondue" as well.

As others had said, I had to use 2 to 3 times as much cheese to get a thick consistancy. Next time I will probably just use the right amount of cheese and halve everything else because it ended up making a lot more then I needed. Also, next time I will use more cheddar and less swiss, but thats just a personal preference. Overall, it is a very good cheese sauce. I will definately make it again with the changes I mentioned.

This had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I added more salt, which made it a little better, added more spices, tried some garlic, and added some Worcestershire sauce.

I made this recipe for our dinner tonight we had it over the broccoli...  I changed a few ingredients and left a couple out as well. I used half and half instead of milk, 1 cup shredded colby jack, instead of swiss and cheddar, I left out the sherry, and used garlic powder and onion powder in place of the mustard powder and the paprika. I used a bit more salt and pepper than called for (you should season to taste), and a sprinkle of chopped parsley just to be fun... It turned out pefrectly, and I must say it was delicious. Probably one of, if not, the best cheese sauce I've ever had.

Excellent cheese sauce.  I like it when made exactly as per the recipe and I'm sure I'll enjoy the suggested variations.  In regards to clumping I've found that after adding the liquid to the butter/flour mixture it's best to use a whisk and to continuously whisk it until it thickens.  I've never had a butter/flour/milk (white) sauce clump when done this way.

I made this sauce to serve over cauliflower for Thanksgiving and it was DELICIOUS! I did add more cheddar though, at least doubled, but you can make it as-is and then gradually add to taste.

I really love this sauce, especially for broccoli and cheese baked potatoes. I've also used it to make mac & cheese, or added some hot sauce to make a tortilla dip. Wonderful! My only real change is I do usually add twice as much cheese as what it calls for.

I was asked to make a swiss "gravy" for a baked potato bar and I used this recipe.  I made it as written (minus the sherry) at first, but then found that the swiss cheese was very stringy!  After some research, I realized the sherry is needed to "de-string" the cheese if you use a lot of swiss.  I added a little bit of lemon juice and it worked wonders to loosen the strings!  I also ended up adding a good bit more cheddar to even out the flavors, as well as some half-n-half for extra creaminess and thinning.   I added a package of tiny ham chunks and it went over really well.  Makes a great topping for a spud bar!

Very easy and delicious!  I made this as a substitute for cream of mushroom soup in a ground beef and potato casserole. The casserole recipe also called for a cup of cheese so this was perfect. I didn't have any sherry or paprika but that didn't seem to matter.  I also used Italian blend cheese because that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely be using this for other dishes.  Thanks!

This was alright - neither good nor bad. I think it was how I used this that didn't work for me. I had some leftover spicy shredded beef in the fridge and decided that nachos would be a good use for it. I LOVE cheese sauce with my nachos and decided on this one in lieu of a more traditional, spicy sauce (mainly because my beef was already SUPER spicy). Both my hubs and I agree that this would make a fine fondue, but it doesn't work for much else than that. I can see this being popular at a dinner party when served with bite-sized meats (i.e. filet), bread, fruit, etc. I might consider making this for my next holiday get-together, but I'm not sure about making this for the two of us again. Thanks anyways, Glen! :-)

I used this on some steak nachos.  It was good...but I think I would do all cheddar, or a different cheese than Swiss.  Was easy enough to make though, and no one complained!

My family loves cheese sauce but we didn't care for this one. I followed the recipe accurately but we found that the sherry was overpowering and didn't go well with our steamed vegetables. Next time I will just add a little more milk.

Very good cheese sauce! I didn't add the sherry but it still came out very yummy. And I added a dash of nutmeg.

Yummy.  Mine thickened up just fine - those who had trouble with that probably need to raise the heat just a little and let it cook a bit longer before adding the cheeses.  I'd use less sherry and more cheese next time.

I made this tonight for supper. The family all really loved it. I used mozzarella in place of swiss and I also substituted taco sauce for the sherry. It was great!

This was tasty!  I'm usually not good at sauces that need to thicken, but this was easy!  I used more cheddar than swiss, and did not add paprika since I did not have any on hand.

I just tried this on top of a breakfast egg bake in place of cheddaer and it was delicious. I will also try the fondue suggestion.

Great cheese sauce. I did double the cheese using only sharp cheddar, a heaty sprinkle of ground cayenne and about 1/2 tablespoon of worchestire instead of salt. I am using on broccoli tonight but I think it would make a good sauce for macaroni.

This was very good sauce however, I doubled the cheese which I think is necessary to achieve a thick rich sauce.  Without the extra cheese it was a bit bland and too runny.  Also the sherry adds a nice sophisticated touch!  Will use as my standby recipe for cheese sauce.  Very Tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was excellent. The sauce was very creamy. I did use more cheddar than called for. I also added parmesan cheese. I love strong cheddar taste. I used it to make macaroni and cheese> Very quick and simple to prepare. Looks of flexibility as well with cheese varieties depending on what you have in the fridge.

I have been looking for a cheese sauce for broccoli and cauliflower and I have found it.  This was a great sauce.  It would be great on any vegetables.  My husband liked it.  I cut the recipe in half and substituted red wine for sherry.  It's a keeper.

I made only 4 servings and used on cheddar cheese and it was still very good!
