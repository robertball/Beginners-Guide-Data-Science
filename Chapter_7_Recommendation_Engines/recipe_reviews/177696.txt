I've made this a few times and it's been a solid recipe. I add chopped onion and shred the chicken and it's phenomenal

I needed a quick comforting soup for lunches at work--this was good for me. I used Imagine organic chicken broth and I added in more carrot and celery along with a mess of fresh minced garlic and a pinch of salt/some fresh ground pepper that I sauteed in butter for a bit before adding in the chicken broth. This was a good quick chicken noodle, after I portioned it out, I got six serving size portions for lunches. I'll make it again. NOTE: One large chicken breast was enough meat for one recipe's worth of soup.

We doubled the recipe and let the veggies cook for 30 min. with the chicken.  Added noodles 10 min. before serving.

I made this soup for lunch today. I only had 1 can of chicken broth so I added 4 cups of water to 4 teaspoons of boullion. I added garlic to this and garlic pepper, mrs. dash, red pepper flakes and a little bit of seasoned salt. This soup was excellent. I served it with a salad and cheese and spinach muffins. It was an excellent meal.

This is super easy, super quick and super yummy.  I keep a case of Swansons on hand and use this recipe for those nights when I am too busy or too tired for meal prep.  The kids love it and my hubby loves it although he does add more freshly ground pepper to his bowl. I have added scallions and parsley sometimes but it is great just as it is written here.

I made this when I was feeling pretty under the weather. It was pretty good, but was lacking something I can't put my finger on. Maybe it was because when you're sick, chicken noodle soup by a loving mother is always the best. :)

very good.  The carrots do need extra time to saute for a good soft texture.  I used dumpling type noodles and a prebaked chicken.  Yum!!

Not bad for being so simple- it does lack a bit of flavor, but it's still a good recipe to use as a guide for a quick soup.

Very simple and my family liked it. I doubled this and used 2 chicken breasts that I cooked with the  veggies in the broth. This turned out well but was a bit bland for my tastes although my hubby loved it.

This soup is mmmm good! I used the recipe as more of a guideline. I added more veggies, chicken and pasta, but the broth is amazing just as it is!

Very good and simple.  I usually buy a small rotisserie chicken which adds a lot of flavor and cuts down on time. It's my go-to recipe for chicken noodle soup!

First time making soup and it turned out fantastic :) Used Campbell's broth though - couldn't find Swanson. Found it just a tad salty and a bit too many ingredients for amount of broth, so I watered it down a bit (maybe added almost one cup of water), also added a bit of onion and it was perfect. Will make again for sure.

We tried this soup last night and loved it.  Even my one year old son couldn't eat the soup fast enough.  There wasn't any left.   We will be making it again in the future.  I did however use wacky noodles instead of egg noodles.

This soup is a staple in our house, especially on cold days or when someone isn't feeling well.
I added parsley and a little garlic powder, and sometimes we use only carrots, no celery. depends on what's in the fridge.  I also use canned chicken breast, because I'm usually in a hurry.

This is quick and easy enough for a busy weeknight.  I used a rotisserie chicken to save more time.  I doubled everything and added extra carrots.  Even my picky son loves it!

This recipe was full of flavor, especially considering the few ingredients. The 2nd time I made it, I added garlic, some onion, and a small amount of fresh thyme. Delicious!

I'm rating my version with a few changes. I have to feed six so my recipe was increased some! I boil 3 breast w/ bones in water and added salt, pepper, a bay leaf, and some dried parsley. After the chicken is done, I set it aside and sauteed 4/5 carrotts, 3/4 celery, small onion in a little butter and EVOO and salt and pepper. When the veggies are tender I add two large cans of Swanson's broth and the noodles let the noodles cook till almost done then add shredded chicken to the batch. My whole family gobbles it up!

I am feeling a little under the weather and just made this and I changed a few things too. I added dried minced onion, Lawrys season salt, dash of cayenne, and dried thyme with the broth, carrots, etc and simmered for about 20 mins. I added a little more noodles then the recipe called for and cooked for about 7 mins. I added 6 oz. diced cooked chicken breast and just let it get warm. Because of the extra simmering in the beginning, I had to add a little water for more broth, but it was still very flavorful.
