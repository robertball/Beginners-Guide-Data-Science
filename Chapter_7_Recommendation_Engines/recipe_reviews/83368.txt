Adding cumin will greatly enhance the flavor of this hummus.  For cooks who prefer a creamier texture, pour the garbonzo beans into a large bowl of water, and rub them between your fingers.  This peels them of their rough outer skin.  Skim the floating skins from the water, and drain the peeled beans, proceed with recipe.  Good stuff!

Really great stuff, and super easy.  I thought I had tahini at home, but I didn't, so I just threw in some seasame seeds.  I added a little more lemon juice because I had extra.  I couldn't find canned roasted red peppers, espeiclally in 4 ounce sizes so I just estimated.  

The hummus smells like salsa, but tastes great.  Texture is perfect, as well.  Just note that it makes a lot more than you would expect it to make, and hummus can be super filling.  The next time I make it, I probably will slice up some of the red pepper to make chunks in it (I know, not much of a hummus that way, but it works).

THis recipe was very easy to make.  I double it, but only used one red pepper and the juice of one lemon.  It was a little bland so I added 1/4 tsp of cumin and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.I also added about 1/4 cup of fresh basil.

This was a good base, but I found it a little bit too liquidy.  I will make it again, but skip the water next time, there is plenty of water in the red pepper as is :).  I added for sund-dried tomato halves for extra flavor (they were packed in oil, so I skipped the oil in the recipe).  Great flavor!

Very good hummus recipe - so many that I've tried are bland and have no flavor.  Used another reviewer's suggestion, and used cumin and cayenne pepper to spice it up.  Excellent, will most definitely make again.  Thank you!

So easy and so delicious! I chopped up the pepper in my mini-chopper and then blended the whole recipe together using my immersion blender...so quick and easy and yummy. I will definately make it again!

I love this hummus. I make it weekly and I'm very upset when I'm out! It's my "snack" at work and really hits the spot with some celery and carrot sticks!

I thought the recipe was a good base recipe without any flavor. I added 1 tsp. of cumin and a handfull of fresh basil and a little more lemon juice. After the adjustments I think it is pretty good.

I wasn't totally wowed by this, but I still liked it. I used lemon juice instead of lime, but kept everything else the same. It went over well at a dinner party and it was really easy to make.

I'm glad I used 1/2 a roasted red pepper. I think the more intense flavor of them is better. And I figured it would also make a smoother hummus. But it was still a little too bland for me. Much better after some cumin, cilantro and cayenne pepper were added. I also chose to use fresh garlic. I went with this recipe because I had a lime to use up, but I was surprised to see that lime flavor didn't really come through.

This was okay.  I didn't add the water as I thought it would be too much liquid.  It was fine without it.

Liked this a lot.  Did add the cumin after tasting it.  Good as is but even better with the cumin.  Will make often as I love hummus in the summer as a hot weather meal.

It was just alright to me.  A full lime juiced seemed a little strong on citris and I did not add water non was needed.  I added cumin as others suggested.  I liked the touch of red provided by the pepper, I didn't have a ful pepper, but 2/3 and it was perfectly fine.  Will try again but reduce lime juice.

This was super easy and was well received at a party I took it to.  I did sub 1 1/2 tsp of sesame oil as I can't find tahini in my grocery store.  I served it w/ home made pita wedges and fresh veggies.  I found I DID need the water to coax my blender into blending everything together.

Delicious!!  I had every kind of pepper but red (green/orange, yellow, even PURPLE!), but figured the premise would be the same so went with the green/orange (figured purple might be too odd looking, but I'm going to try it next time!).  Instead of just using the pepper raw, I halved it lengthwise and broiled it, cut side down, until the skins began to char (approximately 5-7 minutes).  Removed most of the skin, then added it to everything else.  I omitted the extra water and used two HUGE cloves of fresh garlic.  Didn't have tahini on hand, so I ground down some sesame seeds (just shy of a tbsp worth), and added a tsp of extra virgin olive oil.  This recipe is wonderful, great with warm soy pita bread!!

Awesome with cumin and a dash of cayanne. Wound up wrapping them as somasas with some feta. My carnivorous family loved it, thank you.

I really wish I hadn't listened to the comment that said to add cumin, it ruined the hummus taste. But aside from that this is very good. I used real garlic instead, I dont believe in garlic powder!

It gets 4 stars for being healthy- a whole red pepper in the mix... but it's a bit lacking in flavor in my opinion.  I made it as written except for using fresh garlic and it was ok, but still a bit boring.  Added sun dried tomatoes and a bit more lemon juice (and 3 cloves of garlic), but still wasn't my favorite.  I like how healthy it is though- thanks for the recipe!

I lovvvvvvvvvvved this!  I did use the fresh garlic and I think that's what gives it a little more kick.  The red pepper made it taste fresh and exciting.  I'll definitely make this when I have company. It's so easy! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is awesome and easy to make.  One suggestion, do not add the water until the very last. If at all.  I must have had an especially juicy pepper because my first try was yummy, but very thin.  The next time I made it with no water at all and the consistency was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

This hummus recipe was pretty good, but I roasted the red pepper and it made a huge difference, and also added some cumin. Roasting a red pepper isn't hard and it really adds a certain flavor to it, so I recommend it that way! This recipe is fantastic!

This is a great basic recipe - I also omitted the water, and doubled the chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, and seasonings. the consistency was very good. I will say that it is not as garlicky as we prefer - next time I will use at least a clove of fresh garlic, instead of the powder.

This is a fantastic and flavorful hummus. My friends and I loved it. I did think it was a bit too liquidy but I might have over blended it in the processor (this was the first time I actually made hummus). I'll watch out for that and maybe skip the water next time. Great overall!!

Jarred red peppers is very expensive where i live, so I substituited with 10 dried red chillis and 4 fresh red chillis - deseeded, soaked in hot water for abt 10 mins, and blended (1 used 2 cans of beans). Provided a lovely reddish hue and a mega spice kick! Not for the faint hearted. For dips, I used sliced bread, rolled it flat with a pin, brushed with a mixture of olive oil, salt and pepper - toasted crisp.

I added the cumin and cayenne that other reviewers suggested... excellent!  The red pepper does give a lot of water so I will omit the small amount of water added next time.

I agree with others that adding cumin makes it tastier. Cayenne is a given, at least for my family. BUT, my little secret with any hummus recipe is True Lemon or the Lime. If you taste it and it needs a little more tang, try adding 1-2 packs and it makes a big difference.

This recipe is awesome!  I also substituted cumin and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of minced green onion.  It was great before and after the onion, I just like onion.  Delicious and healthy snack!

This recipe for Red Pepper Hummus is very good. It is just as good as the store bought if not better, because it is fresher.

I didn't care much for it, but my husband loved it, so it gets a four. I usually like Hummus, but tend to be partial to the mediteranean blend at my local supermarket. Thanks for the recipe though.

5 stars for a delicious recipe as-is.  This is a great recipe to make your own!  The measurements for the spice are pretty spot on for the first time making it, then.... you can reimagine it  to your taste! I did flavor it up a bit.  The red pepper  I chopped well first in the food processor which left beautiful specks of pepper throughout. Then added the garbanzos, substituted  1-2 Tbs fresh lemon juice instead of lime, added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, no water, then the other ingredients as noted.   I prefer my hummus with substance - not runny or too soft and feel the red pepper provides enough moisture.  I topped it off with a drizzle of EVVO and a toasted pine nut mixture.   It was delicious and beautiful.  I added a picture to this page - check it out!

Remove hulls per MUSIC_MINX (TY!) Can substitute jarred roasted peppers (use/adjust liquid) for fresh, sesame seeds for tahini, lemon for lime juice, fresh garlic for powder. Flexible! So creamy via VitaMix.

I am not a fan of hummus or garbanzo beans, but tried this while on a "Daniel fast," just hoping to find something interesting for my husband and I to try. My friends and family enjoyed it so much, I make this often.  It's wonderful, even when made with an instant dry hummus mix.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great.  Added cumin and cayenne per previous suggestions and only added a small amount of water while processing.  Love this and will definitely make it again and again.  Thank you!

Perfect! The only thing I did, like others, was add cumin. I also threw in a clove of garlic instead of garlic powder. It was delicious. This will be a staple in our home!

I didn't know hummus was so easy to make. My husband and both loved this recipe and I can't wait to try variations of it. I did add some EVOO and an extra garlic clove and it was way better than store bought.

Wow!  This is very good.  I had leftover grilled eggplant that I used in place of the red peppers.  I also added cayenne and cumin at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It's good, healthy and stores easy. This is another that I made a big batch and froze half for later. I pulled it out the other day to take some to work and it tasted great. My friends thought it was store bought!

This was delicious. I used 1 1/2 T of tahini instead of just 1 T. I put the chickpeas in a bowl of water and rubbed them between my hands to remove all of the shell thingies. I also boiled the canned chickpeas in water for 20 minutes to remove the weird crunchiness that usually comes along with canned chickpeas.

This was my first attempt at making hummus and it turned out super-yummy!  I took it to work and everyone said it had so much flavor!  I roasted my red pepper and also threw in 5 cloves of roasted garlic (cuz I love garlic in almost everything) but other than that I stayed true to the recipe as posted and it was a hit.  5 stars for me!  I will definitely be making this again!!

I didn't even know if I liked hummus but wanted to make it because it is a healthy snack.... I LOVED it!!!  Drizzle a little bit of olive oil and more fresh lime juice on top.  I served with baby carrots and pita chips.  Thanks for the delicious, healthy snack!  Will be making often.

Great base recipe that is simple and leaves room for you to add your own touch. I doubled recipe, added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and used lemon instead of lime. I also did not have tahini so I substituted with Sesame Oil.

Delicious! and Simple. After I tased it, I too added a little cumin. Also, I added Greek Kalamata Olives as well to another batch.

This hummus is a base for a mind blowingly delicious hummus. I broiled red pepper, carrot and garlic cloves for 5 mins. I ended up taking the skin off of the red pepper. I added smoked sea salt, freshly grated black pepper, paprika, more basil, and some of the juice from the garbanzo beans' boiling juice since it was really thick. I used 5-6 of key limes instead of lemon juice. This is the best!

As everyone else says, add cumin. Also, drain the water from the can of beans and use that, instead of tap water - more flavor. Used fresh garlic. I eat hummus as a healthy snack, so I use this recipe (without the peppers) as a base for other kinds of hummus. Fresh basil is nice, stir in chopped green olives, roasted garlic - whatever strikes your fancy. Threw in leftover green beans recently. I generally make a double batch, because my food processor is too big for this recipe.

The recipe lacked seasoning and was rather bland, but it was a good starting point. Like a blank canvas, you can add your own twist to give it some dimension.  I added some smoked paprika and cumin. You might also want to bump up the salt & pepper, too.

This was a great recipe...I used fresh garlic and sesame seed oil instead of Tahiti oil and still very tasty. I added little cumin and cayenne pepper. I love fresh hummus. I will never buy from the store again.

I served this to my guest at a get together along with 5 other Hummus varieties from this web site.  It was the first one gone and also the most requested recipe.  Thumbs up!

I used fresh cooked garbanzo beans, 2 Tbl olive olive, 1 fresh clove of garlic, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp turmeric (because it is such a great anti-inflammatory and eliminated the water.  I also didn't have tahini so I ground 2 Tbl of sesame seeds and added them.  I liked the idea of using a raw red pepper but I'm not sure I like the consistency.  I'm sure if I had a better food processor I would have a smoother hummus. I also used lemon instead of lime.

Didn't have tahini, so I used other reviewers sesame oil recommendation. Also used another's suggestion about "fingering" off the peels in a bowl of water to get a creamier texture (GREAT tip!!!) used jarred roasted red pepper. Turned out very nice!

I made this last night, I think I added too big of a pepper cause mine was more pink. I don't eat hummus but I thought it was pretty good. My husband is the one who eats it and he liked it. 

I have a question,how long can your keep this in the refrigerator for?

I love this recipe. The only change is I don't add the water. A favorite that is most often in my fridge and goes well with sea salt pita chips for a snack.

I really liked this recipe; it was quick and very easy to make. I added some garlic to give it more of a flavor, and I cooked the peppers in a frying pan for a few minutes ahead of time to give the hummus more of a roasted taste. My family loved it!

This is the first time we liked hummus. I only had a quarter of a red bell pepper, had I had a whole one, the flavors might have been more intense, and I accidentally dumped more garlic powder than called for.  Regardless, we really enjoyed this one.  Thanks!

We removed the garbanzo skins & added 1/4 t cumin as per the previous suggestions but otherwise followed the original recipe. Yum! This was really good hummus!!
