I made this the other night and it was absolutely delicious! I didn't have a few of the ingredients (kelp, pork belly, the special korean chili pepper flakes) but I substituted Gochujang chili paste for the chili pepper flakes and it seemed to work perfectly. I have had this dish many times in Korean restaurants and never thought I would be able to replicate it at home. I was wrong. This recipe is awesome. Thank you so much for sharing it.
