We've been making orange roughy similar to this for years.  To make this recipe even healthier, I skip the butter step.  Then I sprinkle the fillets with garlic salt and press them into equal parts seasoned bread crumbs and parm cheese (I actually prefer the stuff in the green jar over real, for this dish).  Bake on a foil-lined baking sheet coated with a bit of spray.  Sometimes we spritz the tops of the fillets with spray, which makes the coating a little crispy.  My husband is NOT a fish eater, but he requests this dish at least once a month.  You will be surprised how tasty this is!

I have made this recipe many times with great results. I keep frozen orange roughy from wholesale club on hand because everyone, esp. my 9 yr old, loves it. To save time I do not thaw, and simply place the ingredients on top of the fish (must bake longer). I substitute olive oil for butter, do not use the salt, and add fresh lemon slices. Very moist & tasty! Have also used tilapia, but prefer orange roughy.

YUM!  I used frozen mahi mahi and soaked them in milk for about a half hour to get rid of the fishy taste.  My seafood-hating husband liked this too.  Will make again!

This dish added versatility to my fish cuisine.  For me, it was better than always frying or baking plain using the usual seasonings.  Unlike the previous rater, this dish is a keeper.  Is it 5-star chef, gourmet delicious?...probably not, but like most recipes on this site, it's home-style, family friendly and perfect for the busy professional like myself.

Wonderful flavor and very low fat, as I only needed a tiny bit more than 1 T. olove oil instead of the butter. My 11-year-old son ate three portions, and our daughter (13) had seconds. A real hit for this household. Will definitely make it again. Thanks!

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY - a great new way to enjoy fish!  I just sprayed the fish with olive oil then coated it and it cooked up flakey and full of flavor - no fishy taste at all!  To complete the meal I saute' some squash, zucchini, mushrooms and onions while the fish cooked and it was a great meal.  My husband is not a fish lover and he went for seconds!

This was just okay for us - kind of a "sleepy" dish. Also, most Italians, like me, generally don't add any cheese to seafood dishes and while I do enjoy it in certain dishes, I didn't particularly care for it in this one.  The boldly flavored cheeses are a little TOO bold for the delicately flavored fish.  I used grouper filets and because I didn't want all that bread crumb coating I just sprinkled some over just the top of the filets, then drizzled them with melted butter.  We ate our dinner, but it was without enthusiam.

very nice.  Orange roughy has a mild flavor and a delicate texture, and this method did not kill the texture or the flavor.

Very good, but not exceptional.  An easy weeknight meal.  I omitted the butter and added olive oil spray (once before the bread crumbs and once again afterward to get the breading a little crispy).  My hubby and toddler both enjoyed.

Really, really good! Crust wasn't too crispy but with more butter/olive oil, it might be.

OH MY GOSH!  HUGE THUMBS UP!  I don't really care for fish but loved this.  I hate when people say the recipe wasn't good but of course they "added or substituted" this or that.  But due to the other reviews, I did cut down the salt a bit and added a little more Italian seasoning - not much.  This fish was easy, delicious and even good warmed up the next day.  Loved it.

Excellent dish!  I used Smart Balance Light instead of butter and drizzled the extra on top before I baked it.  It tasted wonderful.  I served this with spaghetti tossed in garlic, parsley and olive oil.

This recipe is perfect.  Easy, tasty, healthy.  Everyone I have made it for absolutely loves it.  For super tender and moist fish, soak it in a bowl of milk for an hour before preparing.  Dry it thogoughly before coating with butter.  If you have a cat, they will love the milk!

WOW!  This was really good.  I used olive oil spray instead of butter, and plain bread crumbs with my own Italian seasoning.  Will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times for my family and we all love it!  I've used Tilapia each time since it was cheaper.  The flavor is perfect for a light meal.  I add a little lemon juice to the melted butter and I soak the fish filets in milk for a few minutes before I brush them in butter so they'll taste less fishy.  Easy and quick but delicious!

Was a really good, quick and easy dish to make. I didn't feel like I was eating fish. I made it according to directions but I didn't have Romano Cheese. Parmesan only was just fine. I suggest eating it with steamed rice and asparagus. YUM!

A hit at our house! Hubby gave it great reviews with the first bite, and I enjoyed it as well.  VERY quick to prepare (I used packaged Kroger Orange Roughy filets--grab out of the bag and go!) -- the dish only took me five minutes to assemble and it cooked for about 17.  I did not have Italian bread crumbs so used plain with Italian herbs mixed in. Yummy! We added asparagus spears and rolls to complete the meal. We'll definitely make this again.

Half the people in my family LOVED this the other half not so much. I think it was the fish (we may not be Orange Roughy people) not the recipe. My try again with a different fish. Also could use a sauce

I absolutely hate fish but my husband brought home some fresh cod from his fishing trip today so I had to find a recipe to cook it.  I LOVED it.  It was so moist and delicious and did not have the "fishy" aftertaste that I hate so much.  I did soak it in milk for a half an hour as previously suggested.  In addition, because our fillets were so huge, it took a little longer and I turned on the broiler for two minutes at the end to make the crust a bit more crunchy.  By the way, my husband said it was the best fish he had ever tasted, even better than his mom's fish, and that says a lot!  Thanks so much.

I have made this several times, it is so easy and satisfying. The only thing I do different is that I don't add very much grated cheese to the bread crumbs. Instead, I sprinkle some fresh shredded parmesan on the fillets about halfway through baking. The cheese is melted but also kinda of crunchy, adding a nice taste and texture. I'll be trying this one on my boyfriend who hates seafood but wants to start eating it for health reasons, I bet he'll be pleasantly surprised.

This melted in my mouth.  When I first tasted it, I almost couldn't believe that I made it!  How could little ole me make something that tasted like a restaurant dish??  I did follow the advise of several others and soaked the roughy in milk first to get rid of the fishy smell. Worked like a charm. My grocer said that Grouper is a good substitute for roughy; less expensive with a better flavor, so next time I may try that. The only thing I would do different is cook it a little longer. My boyfriend said it was a little undercooked but it was fine for me. Other than that, fabulous!

My husband and I really liked this.  I used grouper, instead of Orange Roughy.  I used VIGO Italian bread crumbs and mixed 1/2 tbsp red pepper seeds, and used reduced fat margarine.  I made a "topping" of about 2 tbsp. mayo, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. italian seasoning.  I baked the fish for 6 minutes, then topped it with a thin layer of the mayo mixture, sprinkled it with italian cheese mix and paprica and baked for the rest of the time.  I served it over thin spaghetti tossed with garlic, olive oil, and italian seasoning.  Yummy :)

This recipe ROCKS. I made it for my crew at the firehouse, but since we're trying to be 'healthier', I substituted non-fat yogurt for the butter, brushing it on the fish before rolling it in the crumb mixture. Works great!

Nice recipe for baked fish.  You can instantly reduce the fat without drastic consequences by using butter flavored cooking spray.  I do, however, recommend using full fat cheese for maximum flavor and enjoyment.

Excellent!! I don't usually care for fish, but I went back for seconds on this one! I think I'll try using olive oil next time, for more "Italian" taste. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

YUM YUM YUM.  This coating was DEEEEEEELISH!!!  I didn't have romano so I just used all parmesian and it was so yummy.  I didn't use the melted butter to save on cals/fat and I just sprayed my fish down with "butter spray" before dedging. 
I did have to cook a bit longer then suggested but I used two HUGE filets (over 1/2 lb each) - the smaller peices would have probably cooked in the recommended time!

This recipe was great as written - I used REALLY big pieces of Orange Roughy and ended up broiling after 20 minutes of baking didn't do the trick  - and it really helped both the look and the taste.

this is so good! next time i make it i will cut back on the salt.  the cheeses have enough salt in them so that unless you are crazy for salty food you might want to cut back the first time you make this.

I thought this was good; my husband thought it was great.  We used much less butter than called for which worked fine. I also soaked the fish in milk for 10 minutes first to get rid of the fishy smell/taste.  I only just started cooking fish myself, and this was very easy.  Thank you.

Oh my gosh!  This recipe is outstanding!  I did add a little lemon pepper to the bread crumbs and I also baked it longer since our fish was nice and thick.  Hubby thought I was quite the gourmet cook and of course I didn't tell him how EASY it was to fix.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this Tonya.

Made this exactly like the recipe. It was a little too salty, it didn't really brown and was soggy. The fish I had was fishy too. The place I used to buy it does not sell it anymore and this new place must not freeze it soon enough. :(

Sometimes I think most people do not know what good fish tastes like.

Mine turned out a little watery but may have been the frozen roughy.  Will use leaner cuts and a roasting pan next time so water will drip off.  But very good.

I've made this fish a million times for my family and they alway devour it!!!! It's simple and easy and very healthy. Instead of using the butter, I just use spray butter or butter flavored cooking spray. You can't tell any difference.

My husband and & I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe, and have even tried "kicking it up a notch", but ultimately feel that some recipes don't need enhancing or any extra additives (even though we're Italian and LOVE taste...just bellisimo the way it is!!!)  I added this to my Recipe Box over 5-6 years ago, and keep it the same as it is...Thank you for sharing

This is a delicious way to prepare orange roughy!  It's quick and easy.  I did cut the salt in half, though, which I'm glad I did because 1/4 tsp. was plenty for us.  Highly recommended!

I tried this recipe with the additional advice left by other reviewers, and it was fabulous.  I recommend soaking in milk for at least 15 minutes per fillet, as well as using cooking sprays instead of butter.  The recipe still tastes great if you only use the parmesan cheese and not the romano cheese.  The cooking time is definitely much longer than suggested in the original recipe; one fillet cut in half took 25 minutes to bake until golden brown.  A really great recipe overall!

Delicious! It was very delicate and simple! I didn't have any romano cheese so I just used extra parm.  It was very easy! I served with broccoli and mushroom flavored rice.

This was very good.  Next time I will be sure to dry the fish before I coat it with breadcrumbs so it isn't soggy.  I used butter flavored crisco spray in place of the butter to make it even healthier.  The flavor was very good.

This recipe is wonderful!  I'm not a big fish person, but my husband is, so I'm constantly looking for fish recipes that I too will enjoy.  I used Tilapia instead of Orange Roughy, and it turned out great!  It has great flavor, though not too fishy, and is low fat since it's baked.  Even my two year old eats it right up!

This is the first breaded fish recipe I've tried that actually has lots of flavor. My whole family loved it - even my son who is not a big fish fan! I used tilapia and all parmesan since I didn't have any romano on hand. I will use a little less salt next time. 12 minutes baking time was perfect for the 1/2" to 3/4" filets, and the fish turned out moist. I served it over a basmati rice medley cooked in chicken broth and olive oil. I'll be making this for my in-laws next weekend!

This wasn't anything special.  It was extremely salty.  The cheeses themselves contained enough salt so I don't think that adding more is prudent.  I probably won't make again.

This isn't my personal favorite, but I have to give it five stars for my family's reaction. My picky daughters loved it and my picky husband said, "You can make this anytime!" Very simple, quick and easy recipe.

This was wonderful!  I have enjoyed orange roughy since I was a child but wanted to try something new to spice it up.  Even my fiance raved about it and he's pretty picky when it comes to fish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  i've found a new way to enjoy orange roughy.

I've been a fish lover since childhood, and this recipe has become an all-time favorite! What a wonderful recipe, as well as a wonderful and mild fish. You have to try this! The taste reminds me of a baked schrod dish I used to get at a Boston restaurant, called Legal Seafoods. The only thing I changed was to add a bit of lemon pepper and a couple of shakes of dill to the bread crumb mix. Thank you Tonya, 5 stars for this!

Absolutely delicious!!!  My family members who don't like fish ate it, describing it as the best fish they ever had it.  I will use this recipe again and again.  It microwaves great, and it didn't smell up the entire office, (unlike other fishes), when I took it to work the next day for lunch.

My family loved this...even my son who is a very picky eater.  I used toasted wheat germ instead of bread crumbs, and just sprinkled in Italian seasoning.  I only used Parmesan cheese, and I substituted olive oil for butter.  I also used frozen orange roughy and cooked it a bit longer.  It was delicious!

Would probably give this 4 1/2 stars.  Very good and easy to make.  I thought I was going to be a little short on the bread crumbs, but it was the perfect amount.  Thanks for sharing.

Probably really four and a half stars. Surprisingly easy to prepare and very delicious! My husband and I both really enjoyed this. I did omit the butter and instead just brushed the fillets with fat free Italian dressing before dredging in the bread crumb mixture. No other changes. Served with lightly seasoned mixed vegetables. We were both wanting more - I'll definitely be making this again within the week. Thanks for a great recipe.

This for me was just okay, but it wasnt the flavors I didnt like. It was the fish itself. It kind of reminded me of the fishsticks I ate growing up. I think that had I used talapia this would have been great. I followed the directions, but instead of butter, I brushed the fish with Ceasar dressing. This was really quick and easy and im looking forward to trying it with a different fish

This was my first time eating orange roughy, and it was wonderful!! I skipped the butter and squirted the fish with lemon juice instead. That way the breading stuck anyways, and I loved the lemony flavor. Wonderful recipe, I will be making this again soon!!

This is a great recipe.  I have used it with several white fish, and it always tastes good.  I sometimes add a little more cheese, but just because we like it.  A great match with steamed asparagus.  This made it into our family recipe book as is--it's great!

Great recipe! I used 2 beaten eggs to coat the fish instead of butter. I sprayed the dish with Pam, sprinkled a thin layer of the cheese, then topped it with garlic powder + salt + pepper. The fish was placed on top of all that, then sprinkled with more cheese, garlic powder, salt + pepper, and topped off with the parsley.   The dish came out very moist and the extra cheese on the side of the pan gave the outer ring of the fish a nice crisp layer.

This is excellent.  The only modification, although not my style to modify then rate is that I added lemon pepper seasoning to the prep to the fish.  The top is crunch and all so flavorful.  This is a must try.

As a beginning cook, this was easy, yummy, and made it seem like I've been cooking for years! I used only Parmesan, substituted olive oil for butter, and made my own Italian breadcrumb mix with regular breadcrumbs and Italian seasonings. Scrumptious!

Very nice flavors, but too much butter. Next time, I'll take the advice of those who opted to use the butter spray.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

This dish came out very well. I first dipped it in the butter, then the breadcrumbs. I then dipped it in egg and then another layer of breadcrumbs. It really added to the flavor, and came out with a crispy tasty crust.

Fantastic!  I only use Parmesan since I don't usually have Romano cheese on hand, and it still tastes fabulous!  I make this 2-3 times a month...definitely a keeper!

This was fabulous, it was so easy, quick and delicious.,  I will definitely pass this one on to my friends.  I can't wait to make it again .  I didn't change hardly anything.  The only thing I did different was, poured the extra butter on the bottom of the casserole dish and used all the bread coating, sprinkled any leftover on the fish.

What a great recipe for orange roughy! We both loved it, although next time I am going to reduce the amount of Romano cheese slightly (just a little too overpowering on the cheese side) This is now one of my favorite recipes!

This recipe was similar to chicken parmesan but with fish.  It was very easy and inexspensive.  I did use grouper instead because it was cheaper at the time and I soaked it in milk first.  I used a parmesan blend that already had romano in it. It took a little over 15 minutes and served it with cous cous.

Really good, and really fast.  Soak fish in milk first, though, to eliminate the fishy smell.

Absolutely delish, family-friendly recipe.  My entire family, including two preschoolers, gobbled it up.  I soaked the fish in milk for 30 minutes, and used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray instead of real butter.  I also (gasp!) used dried parsley instead of fresh because I was out of the real thing.  It was a teensy bit mushy, so I will broil for a minute or two next time, but the flavor was great.  Highly recommend this one.

EXCELLENT orange roughy recipe! This recipe would probably work well for practically any white fish. I made it for dinner guests (parents & gma) who are not very adventurous when it comes to trying anything other than 'meat' and 'potatoes'. They loved it. There wasn't a single bite leftover. Only change I made: used more romano cheese than called for.

Believe me!  Roughy does NOT smell, or even taste fishy!  A fish market person once told me "This is the fish for people who don't LIKE fish!"  My Mother(who fried the best fish in the world)hated fish for more than 85 years.  Once she agreed to try it and was amazed that she "hadn't even smelled it cooking!"  My daughter, a fish hater from age 5, was also a convert. A good and interesting recipe, but I have one that is even more diet-friendly.  That is the ONLY reason for my 3* review.

This recipe turned out quite nice. LOW FAT IDEA - I used Light Olive Oil instead of Butter and it tasted great. I will try soaking in milk next time. I also used frozen Roughy and thawed it from morning till evening. I love this moist non-fishy fish. Great Italian flavor. I will use a glass baking dish next time to keep the fish from slightly browning on the bottom.

This was really good.  My fish hating husband even liked it and said he would eat it again.  My kids said they liked it too.  I made a few changes.  I soaked my roughy in milk like previously suggested.  Then I halved the salt and butter and added fresh chopped basil with the parsley.  I also used home made bread crumbs instead of canned so my bread crumbs were larger.  At the end I had some butter and bread crumbs leftover so I mixed them together and put them on top.  Turned out good with the extra bread crumbs being crunchy.  Not fishy either, which my husband hates.

I tried a great tip i got from other reviewers...to soak the fish in milk prior to cooking...worked out great.  Served with garlic and olive oil flavored couscous and was a real winner. Thanks to submitter and fellow reviewers.

This recipe was very good.  We didn't have the Romano and doubled up on the Parmensan.  We feel that fresh Parmesan would have given it a richer taste.  We also would have prefered to use fresh fish, but the frozen worked just fine.  This is a nice change for fish.  Would do this one again.

My husband and I enjoyed this and it was a quick and easy dish.  I was looking for a recipe for flounder fillets and this worked very well. I didn't have all the ingredients so I added some oregano and basil to bread crumbs.  I also doubled the parmesan cheese as I had no romano cheese.  No garlic powder so I put minced garlic in the butter.  I used dried parsley and I am sure fresh would have been better. It's important to me to add more fish to my menus and I appreciate finding such an easy and tasty dish.

This was divine!  We live too far inland to get really good seafood much of the time, but even with the frozen orange roughy from Sam's Club, this recipe was awesome!  Even my vegetarian preschooler ate it.

This recipe tastes wonderful- I've made it several times and always add on a sauce of pre-cooked capers, tomatoes, black olives, red pepper flakes, onions, zucchini, seasonings, and garlic to boot and let that sit on the orange roughy as it is baking... YUM!

I used flounder instead of orange roughy.  Everyone thought it was delicious.  But, then again, how can you go wrong with melted butter, cheese, and bread crumbs?

I don't even EAT fish!  I picked up some Orange Roughy to be adventurous, then realized I didn't know how the heck to prepare it.  I pulled it up here, it literally took 20 minutes tops to make it.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I subbed cornbread crumbles (from stuffing mix) and Italian seasoning spice, and didn't have romano cheese, so I threw in some Mexican cheddar/jack, and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!

Thank you, thank you!

Tender & delicious with a nice italian flavor and aroma (no fishy smell). We even tryed them with a little italian tomato sauce and it added a nice taste as well.

This is a great recipe.  It is very quick, easy, and it tastes wonderful!  Could be used for many types of fish. (I also use this to make chicken nuggets in the oven).

Simply Delicious!!! My Family loved it. I made a couple of changes for a lower fat recipe by using non-stick cooking spray and omitting the butter; and it was still very good. This is a great recipe that is easy to prepare. A keeper!

This was amazingly easy to prepare and my girlfriend absolutely loved it.  Will be making for the family soon.

Coating is light and does not over power the delicate flavor of orange roughy.

I thought this was a good recipe to top fish off, but next time I will use a different fish, perhaps tilapia.

FANTASTIC!!! I substituted walleye with the skin on for the orange roughy since it's what I had on hand. Kept everything else the same, baked an extra five minutes- can't wait to make again!

Really Good! One of my favorite fish recipes. It doesnt over power the flavor of the fish, which you wouldnt want to do to Orange Roughy! I just use a basting brush to put some butter on the fish so it is not too much, then sprinkle the bread mixture over only one side. I think that is healthier and not as messy. It doesnt need it on both sides anyway because it has a lot of flavor. I serve it with a small side of shrimp alfredo and fresh green beens. YUM!

Great flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly although I did put it under the broiler for 2 mintues at the end to crisp up the top.  The amounts of ingredients were spot on.  I loved it.

THIS WAS AWESOME!  I am not big on fish at all, but this was really good!  I had never had Orange Roughy before but it is now my favorite fish!  I also did not use butter, but instead i used mayo and a bit of olive oil mix.  It was great!!  Will definitely make again!!

Very good recipe, my mother is hard to please and she liked this recipe very much.  We soaked the fish in milk as per another reviewer, then coated with egg beaters instead of butter.  I probably used a bit more romano than specified.  We baked for 20 minutes instead of 15 because our filets were quite thick.  Overall, a real winner!

I poured a puttanesca (roasted red pepper and nut) sauce over this and it was great.  Haven't tried it without a sauce but this is a great base fish recipe to add a sauce to (my family doesn't like "unbreaded").

Excellent recipe! My family are not big fish eaters and they just loved this. They can't wait to have it again. Thanks for post. No heavy breading or really strong over bearing herbs. Perfect combination.

I was very good, but for some reason the Roughy had a very fishy taste to it, i think the next time I’ll use sword or halibut, our favorite is Tilapia so that’ll be on the list for next time. The only thing I did different was broil the fish for the last 2-3 minutes to give it a crispy topping, I’ll definitely use this recipe again, I just wont use the Orange Roughy...

Absolutely wonderful. I think 1/8 cup of butter would have been enough. We served this with Angel's mushroom alfredo ravioli from this site. Great weeknight meal.

My favorite fish meal.  I was suprised how tasty it was.  My 7 year old son and husband loved it too.  It is now a family favorite.  I served carrot raisin salad and mashed potatoes with it.  I made my own bread crumbs and added wheat germ.  Fantastic!  Thank you for the recipe.

Very good recipe.  Moist, flavorful and a nice slight crunch to the outer coating.
Once again I followed many of the suggestions of other folks, soaking the fillets in milk and hot sauce for about an hour.  Doubled up on the cheese and garlic powder.
My hubby would have liked it alittle more spicy, but both my son, and myself, liked the mildness of this dish as is.

Just tried this tonight, turned out pretty good. It was a little salty, but I brushed the fillets with a little seasoned salt (I always worry about fish being seasoned enough)and probably would skip that next time.

Instead of butter I brushed olive oil on both sides before dipping in the bread crumb mixture. I used a canned parmesan-romano cheese combination. I also cooked it in an oven compatible cast iron skillet sprayed with pam.

This recipe (with my minor modifications) was fabulous! I marinated the fish for about 1 hour in milk and hot sauce, then flour, then butter, then breadcrumbs with romano, garlic, salt, black, and cayenne pepper.   I thought it would just taste like baked fish, but it was so tender and juicy! Good flavor as well.

Made this last night - and it was good, although I think from reading all the stellar reviews I expected too much.  It's definitely healthy, so I'll make it again, but maybe try tilapia like other users. Like others suggested, I soaked the fish in milk before assembling and I served it over rice.

Excellant! Low in fat and the whole family enjoyed it. Needs to cook longer than 10 minutes though, although probably depends on thickness.I did not cover it when baking.

My family liked this dish and I loved it because it was so easy and uses ingredients you usually already have.  I used tilapia instead of orange roughy just because the tilapia was half the cost.  It tasted great and I will make this again.

After inquiring at my local fish market i discovered that Orange Roughy is a native New Zealand fish that's hard to acquire in my neck of the woods (US Northeast). I substituted Cod and it was pretty good but a bit too salty. I'd make it again but put less salt in the bread crumb mix or try a different fish (maybe Halibut)

This was a great find. I made this recipe tonight using whiting fillets. I used less butter and as suggested by other reviewers, soaked the fish in milk prior to dipping in butter and topping ingredients. It came out delightful! I squeezed on some fresh lemon after serving. My 5 yr. old picky eater even said she loved it! Thanks for the easy, quick and healthy recipe!

Excellent fish! Orange roughy is the best because it doesnt taste like fish, it tastes like butter! I used all parmesan cheese and omitted the other cheese and used spray butter for convenience. five stars!

This was a big hit with my family last night.  I've never cooked fish before and wasn't too sure how it would turn out. I didn't have any Romano cheese so I just added more parmesan and it turned out great!

This fish was incredible flavorful and moist. I followed several suggestions in the reviews. I soaked the fish fillets in milk for about 30 min before I brushed them with butter. I also added lemon pepper to the bread crumb mixture. I made a topping of 2T mayo, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/4 t italian seasoning. I topped the fish with the topping after it had been cooking for about 6 min. I served the fish over spaghetti tossed with garlic, olive oil, and italian seasoning. All of these additions only increased the flavor, but the recipe would have been wonderful even without them.

I liked this dish; however, drenching it in butter made the it greasy and heavy. I will make the breading again but will substitute the butter step either with the light olive oil mentioned below or with a butter substitute.

Very nice... reminds me of Mom's recipe for white fish.  I used haddock instead of the roughy due to the cost of orange roughy in this area.

Wonderful, easy recipe. I used fresh grated cheese,  which added added to the flavor and helped keep the breading from being too dry.

What a delicious, easy way to prepare fish.  I used haddock since that's what I had on hand.  My husband loved it--he had 3 helpings.  I will make this often.

This recipe was Fabulous,great tasting and most of all fast.  I used Talapia instead of Orange Roughy because it was cheaper.  I also added red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Overall this was soooo good.

We are not in anyway fish type people but my husband stated he wanted to try.  This was my first ever attempt at even cooking fish.  Let me tell you... if this is an example of how easy and delicous a fish dish is we are fish lovers now.  Thanks for the recipe... tender, flaky, well seasoned.  I did substitute crushed Peppridge Farms Cracked Pepper and Parmesan croutons for the bread crumbs.  Big Success!

The overall taste of the fish seemed a bit dry with the breadcrumbs, parmesan, and romano cheese coating.   Next time, I might omit the breadcrumbs, and add the two cheeses and seasonings to some mayo for a "wet" coating.

We're not really big on fish, but this way of preparing orange roughy (a really mild tasting fish) is excellent!  Everyone had seconds.  Definitely a keeper!

Great taste and texture! I will make this again as my daughter who is a finiky eater really liked this!  I did cut down on the amount of margarine used...its not really necessary to use so much and it cut down on the calories and fat by doing so.

This is a great recipe! I used grouper instead of Orange Roughy, and it turned out fine. Very easy to make, and unlike so many other recipes, I won't have to "tweak" this one when I make it again. My husband liked it a lot, and he's not a big fish fan.

I made this fast, easy recipe again last night and it was great! Although the recipe is wonderful as is, I experimented a little - instead of just using melted butter, I sautéed 2 crushed garlic cloves (instead of garlic powder) in butter and a little olive oil.  I steamed fresh broccoli while the fish was baking and less than 20 minutes later sat down to a delicious meal. Thanks so much for this recipe.

FANTASTIC....I read the reviews and I added feta cheese and chopped tomatos on top of the breaded fish.  Not only did it look like it was prepared at a fine restaurant, but it tasted out of this world.  We had some left over (I bought 2 lbs) and took it with us to a family thing the next day and it was devoured in minutes everyone wanted the recipe.

This was quick enough for a weeknight dinner, but really fantastic.  The butter adds a lot of flavor to the fish.  I threw the cheese in the food processor to get it very finely grated.

This was delicious and easy to make. I just recently found out that I love orange roughy. We used olive oil because I didn’t have butter. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This one is a keeper!

This was really good. I had 2 orange roughy fillets. I only made one minor change. I sprinkled half the bread crumbs over the bottom of the baking dish and the other half on top. The rest, I followed exactly. My husband who is not a fish lover, but loves Italian food, really loved it. I love fish but am not fond of most Italian food. This was the perfect recipe for both of us. Thank you for the recipe.

The flavor was good but I had hoped it would be crispier.  I brushed both sides of the fillets with melted butter then dredged in the seasoned bread crumb Parmesan mixture.  I used Panko and shredded Parmesan cheese which didn’t adhere to the fish very well.  I baked at 400 for 20 minutes before the topping browned.  Everyone thought it tasted delicious so I’ll try it again.

Delicious.  I am really picky about my fish and often don't like fish dishes at all but this was the best I've had in a long time.  Even better than some I've had at restaurants.  I love salt and I did feel this recipe was a little salty.  I slightly reduced the salt this time but would reduce it even more next time I make it.

Very good!  Made per recipe with addition of two shakes of Mrs. Dash for added zip.  Did not realize how mild a flavor orange roughy is.  Found a fish my husband will be ready to eat again instead of suggesting we go out when I mention fish.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and the fish was light and flaky,  juicy and absolutely delicious.
The coating adds perfectly to the fish without weighing it down.

very good! took exactly 11 min in a gas oven. Only change I made was not adding bread crumbs. Put all seasonings on top, sprayed with olive oil butter and baked.  Fish was moist and flavorful.  A keeper

This is the first time making Orange Roughy this way and it will become my go to recipe for this fish. The buttery crust gives the fish a wonderful flavor. This is much better then my usual baked roughy with butter lemon garlic and paprika. The only thing I will do different in the future is allow the fish to sit out a short time to come closer to room temperature as the very cold fish hardened the butter and made it a bit harder to keep the crumb coating on it.

Easy to make and tasted great!  Even my picky six year-old finished her piece!  I had to cook it for much longer than the recipe recommended because the bread crumbs didn't brown up like in the picture.  After about 20 minutes at 400 degrees, I turned on the broiler and watched over it until they turned barely brown.  I was afraid that I'd over cook the fish but that seemed the better alternative to soggy breadcrumbs.   The fish handled the extra time without getting tough.

I seasoned and prepared this recipe exactly as described, but I cooked it on the plate setter on the Big Green Egg to give it a smoky flavor. Phenomenal!!! My husband doesn't really care for fish but he loved it.  I will be making this again.

Underwhelming. Oddly for those who thought it too salty, I found it vastly under seasoned. Fish didn't crisp much, the flavor of the roughy might be too subtle. Overall, I'll need to find an alternative recipe for orange roughy--and considering this is $14.99/lb, a real waste of potentially good fish.

Great recipe! Fish turned out perfect and I didn't have any parsley. Great flavor and a little crunchy on top! Husband loved it, will make again and again :)

This was super easy and everyone really loved it!  I sprinkled some fresh grated cheese on top as well.  I also added a few pinches of mrs. dash herbs to the bread crumb mix as well.  they ate every bit!

Used Garlic and Herb bread crumbs instead and it had good flavor but was a little too rich for me, but the bf loved it.  Had with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Next time will try with the right bread crumbs and maybe less romano cheese.

My husband is a picky eater.  He wants something beyond plain orange roughy.  He really enjoyed the light taste of this breading and it was very easy to prepare.

My husband and dinner guest both LOVED it. We had just all wished our fish filets were larger because I only made one for each of us and they were on the small side. You will want seconds.

The fish had really great flavor and will be a regular weekly meal for us. Like other reviewers, here is what I changed: Cut out salt altogether, cooked for about 25 minutes, broiled at the end to get it crispy, used something instead of butter (spray, olive oil or egg). This recipe is better than fried fish (which I love) and the fish comes out moist and flaky.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed garlic croutons and it came out awesome.  Two teenage girls that have never eaten Orange Roughy that it was wonderful. I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made with sole, because there was no orange roughy available. Everyone seemed to like it, some more than others. Easy to put together, and fast. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy!  I scaled the recipe down to two for two filets and it was perfect.  A little breading left over, but not much.  I did bake 20 min, but my filets were thick so I didn't want to underbake.  Only thing I did differently was use the spray butter--didnt' feel like melting butter.  I sprayed on the top of the breading, too, and it crisped a little.  thanks!  We will be having this one again!

Really tasty!  I used the extra breadcrumbs and butter on top of some steamed broccoli (steamed in the microwave) and put that in the oven at the same time as the fish.  Great meal, and quick and easy!

I made this for my boyfriend who hates fish. I surprised him with it. He was not that happy when he first saw it. But he ate all of it and liked it.
I will be making it again. It had a great flavor.

Very tasty.  I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs so I used regular bread crumbs and added 1/4 teaspoon Italian Herb blend.

Good recipe for a quick weeknight meal. I did not use parmesan  b/c I only had ramano, and used garlic and herb seasoning plus a little Old Bay. Overall, I'd try it again.

My husband does not care for fish fillets, but this is one he enjoyed.  It was a fast, easy, and delicious.  Used another reviewer suggested soaking fish in milk, great suggestion.  This one will stay in my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing.

WOW- my husband and I were both surprised by how much we liked this simple recipe! I used the reviewer suggestion to soak the Orange Roughy in milk ahead of time and used a little less salt than called for. It was Fantastic! Thank you to who ever posted this recipe!

We really liked this. I didn't have romano cheese so used all parm cheese. Also didn't add the salt. As others suggested I also soaked in milk and used pam instead of butter. Will make again! It did take my fillets a lot longer cook.

It's a keeper! I didn't tell my husband it contained parmesan cheese (he won't have anything to do with parmesan cheese)and he really enjoyed it. We felt it was a little salty, so we'll cut back on the salt next time. It did take longer to cook than the recipe stated.

I didnt have any breadcrumbs so I smashed up some Ritz crackers & mixed in Italian seasoning, I shouldnt have ground the crackers so fine as the whole dish came out a little mushy, as others have stated. The taste was amazing but the texture was off, maybe I'll go without the cheese for the baking portion and then grate some cheese & broil for 2 minutes.

The fish came out rather soggy and the cheese flavors were a little too strong for the fish, I thought. I might use the same recipe with chicken in the future, though.

This was the best fish recipe that I have ever made at home. My husband said that it was the best fish he has ever had anywhere, and that's saying a lot for someone who only likes his mother's cooking.

I have never been very fond of fish in general. Due to my current new years resolution of eating better, I was beginning to tire of chicken and beef so I decided to try some Orange Roughy. This recipe is a definate hit! I added a bit more cheese and cut down on the butter (only used about 1½ Tbsp).

I will definately be making this one again!

This is a great white fish recipe.  I use mayonaise instead of butter & it makes the fish so tender!  I also soak the fish in milk for about 30 minutes prior to cooking - it helps remove fishy taste & smell.  Definitely a keeper!

Wow!  Even my husband loved it!  I am watching my carbs so I used Atkins break in my food processor to make low-carb bread crumbs.  This was AWESOME!

This recipe is a keeper!  Melts in your mouth.  SO EASY and QUICK.  The flavor from the Parmesan and Romano cheeses is wonderful.  I made this recipe for Valentine's dinner, along with the Lemon-Horseradish New Potatoes and the Winter Fruit Salad with Lemon Poppy Seed Dressing (both from Allrecipes.com).  My husband and I love the orange roughy and thought it tasted like it could possibly be from the menu of a fine restaurant.

Excellent flavor.  I used cod because my fish market did not have orange roughy this week.

1/18/2005: For me not being much of a fish liker, this came out OK taste wise.  Husband sorta liked it, but no one liked it the next day.  In my opinion it left an aroma of a strange fish in the house more like fish sauce and I wasn't too crazy about the left over smell.  Probably just me not used to making a fish other than salmon  and the smell just seemed overwhelming to me. UPDATE: Considering this recipe stands out in our memory 14 years later as never again , dropped rating to 2 stars.

Very good but a little soggy.  I would either turn it over once or broil it for a moment to crisp.

Good recipe.  My husband and I are trying to eat more fish, but I haven't cooked much of it yet.  We both like orange roughy, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I will make it again.

Not nearly as flavourful as I expected after all the reviews...it needed the salt and then some!  Next time I might consider pan-frying this recipe to make it less soggy.

this dish is a big hit in our family and i've
tried doing a few things differently.   we found
that regular bread crumbs tastes better and i've
tried this breading with tilipa fish instead of
the orange roughy and it tastes just as good.

We loved the flavor of this.  Even though I made more substitutions than I intended, it was great.  I used tilapia and light butter intentionally, left out the bread crumbs (!!!) because I discovered at the last minute that I was out.  Used a little Italian Seasoning, which I ground and added some paprika for color.  Thanks for a great flavor mix.  Think I will try this combo the next time I "oven fry" chicken.

This recipe was pretty good, but I'd probably be dissapointed if I ordered it at a restaurant. The leftovers were really good, though. I think it would be better to use dry parsley flakes than fresh chopped parsley, because in the leftovers it tasted a little overpowering. Overall, very good!

This is an excellent recipe. I lightened it up a bit by dipping the fish in eggwhites before the breadcrumbs, then I sprayed the fillets with butter spray. The result was great.
