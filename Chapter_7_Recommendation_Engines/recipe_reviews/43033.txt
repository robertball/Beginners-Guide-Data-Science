This has great potential for a delicious blend of flavors, but I agree it is a bit bland as is.  I even squeezed several orange slices over the salmon before baking to try to increase the flavor.  Next time I will try an orange juice-red wine marinade with some nutmeg sprinkled in, before baking according to this recipe.  Still a great mix of flavors, if you can get them into the salmon more!  Also, an extremely easy, extremely fast dinner - that's what I like!

Um, nice to meet you, Chris Dabis.  Anyway, this recipe is really good and really really easy.  Cut the oranges carefully and neatly because they look really good served at the end if they aren't messy-looking.

salmon was bland, needed more nutmeg or something to bring out more of the flavor.

I made this last night for Valentine's Day! Thank you so much for a light, easy on the palette (my boyfriend doesn't like strong flavor) entree. Served with steamed string beans and soba noodles flavored w ginger and orange and yellow bell pepper. I will make this again!

Absolutely love how simple this recipe is. I have  used regular oranges and even switched nutmeg with ginger at one point, still tastes delicious. I do not use the wine, so I squeeze a whole orange, and slice another on top as recipe says and let sit covered in refrigerator for a few hours..

Added more of pretty much everything and allowed the salmon to soak up the marinade over night. Still really bland.

I made it with sweet mandarin oranges but it didn't really make it have any flavor after cooking. Perhaps it should marinate for a while before cooking?
