Excellent.  Quantities seem a little whacky as made this for 40, served 60 and still had a mountain left over.  Probably better calculation would be one potato per person.

Had some left over New Red Potatoes (with skin on) that I had boiled so I decided to make a potato salad.  I halved the recipe due to the number of potatoes I had. My husband's exact words were"now that's what I call a really good potato salad!"  We both really enjoyed the flavor change - just the right amount of "curry" flavor for us.

I am not a huge fan of potato salad generally, but this recipe was really good. The curry flavor was fantastic and the apples add a sweet surprise to every bite. Very flavorful, easy, and delicious.

Very flavorful, nice curry flavor without being overpowering.  I almost think some raisins or golden raisins or craisins would be good in there.

Great!!! Went to a BBQ last night and it was the hit of the meal. Many compliments and requests for the recipe. Took a little longer than 30 minutes for me to make it, but well worth it. Will make it again for sure. Made it with about 2.5 lbs of potatoes, but no other changes and it was sooo good!

I had to make a few changes due to what I had in the house and it still came out great.  I used just mayo, no celery and chopped dill pickles.

If you like the taste of curry, you will love this potato salad.  The sour cream makes it super creamy.  I skipped the celery and sweet relish.  It was a big hit with my husband!

I omitted the egg, sweet pickle relish and celery and replaced the red potatoes with russets, and replaced the red onion with white onion. Overall a great recipe... so much so that I have been eating rather large bowls :)

I'll be the first to admit that I had to leave out the apple because, after cutting into the only one I had, I found out that it was not fit for eating.  My bad.  Other than that, followed the recipe and got lots of surprised "oohs!" after tasting and lots of, "I never thought about adding curry to potato salad!"  It was truly yummy and I will be making this again.

If you like southern style comfort food this recipe is not for you. I looked at the reviews and decided to try it. I took it to a family reunion and people took bites but would not eat it.

hmmm, yummy and delicious. I used green granny smith apples. I peeled and cubed them, and it made a contrasting taste to the curry. Will do this again on my son's birthday next month.

This is delicious.  I used red onion rather than the green, and double the curry.  I also used russett potatoes.  If you like potoato salad or curry, you'll be pleased.

Made this for a company picnic last night.  HUGE hit!  It was the dish everyone was talking about.  I was concerned that maybe the curry would put off most people, but it was very well received.  I recommend this dish if you want to bring something to a potluck that will make people talk!

I pretty much went by the recipe and 2.5x'ed the recipe, which, for 50+ people, I think I would have been okay 1.5x'ing it because I have no idea what I'm going to do with all the leftovers.  The only adjustment I made to the ingredients was substituting onion powder for the chopped red onion.  I'm not a fan of crunchy onions, and the recipe already had enough crunch with the apples and the celery.

We all agreed that the curry and apples are a surprisingly spot-on combination.  I used red delicious apples because I was afraid the tartness of a different type would fight with the other flavors.

My family loves curry so this was a big hit. I substituted red potatoes for sweet potatoes. The contrast of sweet potatoes and apples with curry was a good combination.

Wonderful flavor.   Didn't have apples so doubled the celery for crunch.  The touch of curry made this otherwise everyday potato salad very special.  Made it twice now, still no apples and family was impressed.  Makes a lot and my family ate it all!  No leftovers!!

Made this recipe which was very good.  I only used 3/4 cup of sour cream and mayonnaise and left out the apples.  Liked it much better.

Everyone loved it, having the apples makes it a little lighter and the slight curry flavouring is always a hit!

The dressing is DELISH!!! I left out the eggs cuz that sounded weird for curry, and used green apples instead of red. Next time I'm going to try with sweet potatoes, it just didn't seem to meld with the regular ones.

What a wonderful combination of flavors!  Love curry, and with the sweet touch of apple it  really sets it apart!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I think you could get away with 3# of potatoes.  thanks so much!

Wow! This is actually the best potato salad I've ever eaten. Husband says "very strong like." Simple to make (I made it exactly as written except that I cut the qty in half), with easily available ingredients ... not only will I make this on a regular basis, I'll be bringing it to parties too. TFTR!

Great recipe and very easy to alter for individual tastes.  We didn't have any curry powder so I used paprika, but only about 1 tsp.  I also double the sweet relish.  The apples add interest!

made this according to the recipe with no changes...first time ever to make potato salad. Very good...took it to fellowship and got great response. Tasted better after two days as the flavors had time to really work through the dish. Do not change a thing...great just the way it is! Will make again!
