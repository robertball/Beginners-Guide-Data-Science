Absolutely horrid!  I wasted two mangoes, and a bottle of tequila on this.  This will definitely not stay in my recipe box.

Wow don't waste a good mango on this it would take 5 mangos to a blender to make any flavor at all at that rate you'd have to charge your company!

I thought this recipe was good.  The mango was ripe, so it had a lot of flavor.  I did think it needed to be a little sweeter, so I added just a little bit of honey.  Sugar around the top of the glass would have probably had the same effect.

These were delicious! I had some frozen mango I needed to use up, and it was perfect for these!

We made this and found that 3 oz of tequila was just right! Otherwise the recipe was great!

Absolutely delish :) I used one ripe mango, didn't have triple sec so I used a half juice orange and agave nectar for some sweetening.  Was not too sweet, which I love, but mango flavor was nice.  Definitely worth a try!
