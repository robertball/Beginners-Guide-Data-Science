I made this last night for my husband and he really enjoyed it. I cheated and bought tzatziki sauce at the Greek market and just added a squeeze of lime. It was easy and tasty. Great recipe.

Holy Cow! This recipe has got a great base to work from. Loved everything up until I added the Newman's Own Light Lime dressing. The dressing gave a funky taste to the dressing (it's that weird taste you get from "light" stuff that kind of tastes fake.) Next time I'll just squeeze in some real lime and I am sure it will be delicious.

Very tasty! I have made this 2 different ways - one with Newman's Own and without. Both yummy! You can marinate the steak with just about any marinade you like and instead of the Newman's dressing you can use fresh or bottled lime or lemon juice instead. Definitely will make again!

This was probably one of the best salads Ive ever had! Since I didnt have any skirt steak I used chicken! Yummy
