I gave this recipe four stars because it's very easy to fix but the rice gets kind of dry after adding the extra veggies and chicken. I think next time I will turn the rice off when there is still some of the liquid left so it doesn't dry out as much. I used some frozen peas and carrots that I threw in the boiling water when I threw in the rice. I steamed some fresh chopped broccoli in the microwave in one of those microwave steam baggies (they are so awesome by the way) and some frozen cooked chicken. I had to add some soy sauce at the end because the rice was dry after adding all the extras. I will make this again! Thanks.
