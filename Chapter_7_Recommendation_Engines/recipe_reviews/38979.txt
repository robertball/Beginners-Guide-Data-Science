This was very good and very rich!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I used regular graham cracker crumbs, low-fat cream cheese and sour cream, and added caramel syrup and pecans on top. Next time I might leave off the caramel, because the chocolate chips make it rich enough!

This cheesecake was absolutely fantastic.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because someone said it needed extra sweetness. They were wonderful.  I also used a different recipe for the chocolate graham cracker crust.  A wonderful guilty pleasure.

It's almost not sweet enough for me.  I'm going to make it again tonight and drizzle the top with caramel syrup to see if that helps.

Very creamy! I made this cheesecake half plain and half with the chocolate chips. Believe it or not, but my husband does not like chocolate. He did enjoy the oreo cookie crust, however. Great recipe!
