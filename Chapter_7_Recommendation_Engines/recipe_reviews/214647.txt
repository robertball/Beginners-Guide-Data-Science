Such an easy recipe, and they came out great. I didn't have any white cheese, so I just used shredded Sharp cheese. I ended up baking 20 minutes.

This is the best biscuit recipe I've ever tried -- and believe me, I've tried a bunch! I use half cake flour and half bread flour, which make the biscuits lighter and fluffier. I've also played around with various cheeses and herbs with great success. It's an easy and versatile recipe, and quite a crowd pleaser!

I made only two small changes and that was using buttermilk instead of 2% milk and I added a teaspoon of garlic powder. Instead of making drop biscuits, I shaped the dough into a round circle and cut the dough into triangles, like scones. Awesome biscuits--very tasty! GREAT with barbeque chicken and pasta salad.

These were awesome!  I followed the recipe as directed and they tasted much like those at a certain popular seafood restaurant!  They are good as they are and also very good with a little garlic butter brushed on the top.

These are excellent and easy.  I don't like thyme, so I added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  My whole family LOVED them.

These were amazing. I did not use herbs and olive oil and substituted honey for the white sugar. When mixing I added half the milk to the dry mixture to minimize clumping when adding the butter. Baked for 15 minutes and they were SO good. Will definitely make them again!

We didn't like these at all.  They were very chewy, and the insides took longer to cook than the outside, making for a crunchy exterior.  And the taste just wasn't quite "right", though I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about it.  We won't be making these again.

There are many recipes similar to this on this site and most are good.  This is one of them.  But what I don't understand is the directed baking time of 20-30 minutes for a biscuit 1/8 cup in size.  I made mine twice as big, using a 1/4 cup measuring cup (these will be great for breakfast sandwiches in the morning) and they were perfectly baked and beautifully golden at 15 minutes.

These smelled really great & the texture was fantastic, but they didn't have the really cheesy taste that I was expecting. We will be making them again since they are so easy, but using sharp cheddar instead. Maybe adding a garlic butter on top like suggested by other postings

I wanted cheese biscuits and this was the only one I found that didn't call for bisquick type mixes.  I make everything from scratch here.  I had all ingredients on hand and my whole family had double helpings.  Very good.  I did cut the salt in half but I think next time I'll follow the recipe to the T.  Very good, easy, and quick.  Just the way I like my recipes.

While these baked up nicely we felt there was a lack of flavor and a heavy baking powder aftertaste.  Might try again with some changes since they had a nice texture but not impressed as written.

Skipped the herbs, used whole milk because that's all we had, and sharp cheddar along with some remnants from a 3/4 empty mexican cheese bag, because I wanted to use it up. They were fabulous! Wonderful crunchy outside and fluffy and moist inside. We will be making these more often and I'm happy to hear they freeze well.

Have to agree with the other consumer that these really lacked flavor.  They were, however, crispy on the outside and kind of fluffy on the inside.  I don't think I'll try these again.

SO good!  Used only old cheddar and switched out the parsley for oregano and basil and oh ... my ... word!  Awesome!!  And so much easier than rolling them out and cutting it into shapes.  I'll be making this again 'cos the family loved them.  Perfect with meatloaf. :)

Fantastic!  Substituted more white cheddar for the colby and they were amazing!  Loved these biscuits and will definitely make again!

I'm not a baker but didn't have any frozen biscuits for breakfast one morning.  These were delicious and even I didn't mess them up.  I didn't have block cheese and they were really good with the bagged grated cheese.

These biscuits were quite good. I used sharp cheddar, freshly grated. The biscuits were crispy on the outside, and soft inside. Although they were very good when hot from the oven, they weren't nearly as good once cool, when the texture seemed odd for a biscuit. I appreciate that they are a cheese biscuit, and NOT a garlic-cheese biscuit like so many recipes are.

Just okay. Not as cheesy as I hoped. Next time I'd cut the salt. It tasted much better with butter brushed on top.
