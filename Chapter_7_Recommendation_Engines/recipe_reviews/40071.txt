My mom tells the story of how when she and my dad were first married (she's German, he was an American GI stationed in Munich), he asked her to make him some pancakes.  She knew only how to make German pancakes.  When she put the plate in front of him, he looked at it, asked "What's this?" and ate them all.  This is almost exactly the way my mom taught me to make German pancakes.  When they are hot off the pan I sprinkle the inside w/cinnamon and sugar, roll them up and serve them with chilled canned peaches spooned over them.  We eat these almost every Sunday as our evening meal.

if you have trouble flipping the pancakes, try running a toothpick around the outside of the pancake and using it to grab the pancake.  Then you can use your fingers to flip it.

I love German pancakes and have looked for a recipe for them for ages.  This is so easy that it is hard to believe how good they are. Remember though, the first pancake to be cooked has to be thrown away.  (Really, it does!) When the pancake is cooked and put on the place, spread a little butter over it and then fold it over itself twice.  Top with a little more butter, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  Fantastic.

My mom makes these (she is German). So far this is the easiest recipe to remember and make. When I would ask my mom how to do it she would say, "eggs-flour-milk, it's easy." But she never used measurements! She just knew how to do it. So my attempts always came out  like rubbery discs.
One thing I would like to say about Barbarella's recipe is that those tablespoons of flour should be on the heaping side. I also added a few grinder spins of rose petal infused salt.
The thing about these is you can make them as fancy or as plain as you like, use the leftovers sliced up in soup, make them savory or sweet...try filling them with leftover cranberry sauce!
The trick to flipping these in the pan is to wait until the uncooked portion looks dry, loosen the sides all around the skillet, then with a wide spatula flip. A non-stick pan helps, but my mother made these things in a cast iron skillet!

These tasted great, but I also had trouble getting them to form into a round shape.  I have a small frying pan that is great for making one pancake at a time, so I used it and found it was much easier to get that round shape.  I also used 1/4 cup of flour instead of the amount suggested in the recipe to mellow out some of that eggy taste.  After the alterations I believe that these are the best pancakes I have ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.

My Oma used to make this for me as a child, I misplaced her recipe and I tried this and it fit the bill perfectly!  My german grandparents used to call this "polojinka" I make mine with Rosehip Jam in the center....if you are ever in a german store grab a jar of this jam you wont regret it.  Thank you for replacing her recipe for me so I can enjoy it again with my family.

As a Mennonite German we made these large flat pancakes, we call them flinsin.  We roll them up with butter and homemade syrup, the best treat.  It's my daughter's favorite meal served with bacon.

Being a Catholic, we of course never ate meat on Friday's. This was a dish that my german mom made every few months on those evenings. My brother's and I loved it and certainly still do. Sometimes we used maple syrup and others we spread jam on the pancake, rolled it up and then sprinkled with powdered sugar. Always an occasional treat, whether it be a quickie dinner or a leisurely breakfast. My kids love it just as much as I did. Thanks for the memories, Deborah......

These pancakes tasted fine but I found them very hard to create.  They were extremely runny and hard to control in the skillet.

I really liked how this tasted and it was easy to make. However, I had a hard time flipping these! When I'd get it right, they turned out great. But when I couldn't flip them (they are very thin), they were a mess. I think I might need a wider spatula or something to make these work.

Would be 5 stars except for the practice needed to make these work. The taste is great. I used heaping TBSPs of flour and added a dash of salt. After messing up a couple, I finally "got it". What worked for me was using a small nonstick skillet and wiping it with vegetable oil on a paper towel between uses. The toothpick trick also helped a lot. There is a point at which the broad tip of the toothpick will loosen the edge w/o tearing the pancake, then just go around the edge enough to be able to put a thin spatula under for flipping. If the whole edge is not firmed up, it will tear. I used low/medium heat, because the first one was 'way too brown.   Also, I did not fill these, but rather sprinkled them with fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar. Without filling, this recipe makes two servings at most.

I wanted to edit this to give all you folks who are having issues flipping these some tips.  I make these probably once a month and they are my daughters favorite breakfast- about the only thing that will get her out of bed. 
*Use a good non stick skillet
*make sure you are starting with a hot oiled (Pam) skillet
*you will need Pam and I reapply after every 2-3 pancakes 
*you have to make sure most of the moisture has evaporated before flipping.  For me it is about 35-45 seconds depending how thick they are.  They should look "dry" not wet.
*to get the perfect shape I pour with one hand and rotate my pan with another until I get the size I want.  I just eye it.  They are usually very thin on the outer edge.
*To remove from the pan I go around the edge with a rubber spatula then flip with my hands.  Yes hot but doable.
*they should be very light golden brown when you flip
*the second side just needs a little time in the pan you don't want these to be crunchy



When I was a kid in elementary school they had an International day where Moms came in and cooked things from their native land.  I stumbled across the room where one of the Moms was making German Pancakes.  I probably ate 10 of them that day and have never forgotten the crepe with the lemon and sugar on them.  I made these this morning for my lemon crazy dd.  She loved them and so did I.  It doesn't make a lot, in fact, the two of us ate the whole batch.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Deborah. I will make these again.

These are what I was taught in Home ec, to make. They became our week-end breakfast. I LOVE them with cottage cheese in the middle, strawberries & strawberry syrup over the top and a dash of sour cream. Like Blintz's. I'm not German, but boy do I LOVE German food. Thank you for giving back to me the recipe, I thought I had lost forever!!

Wonderful German pancakes!  I also add a good dose of vanilla extract and a little almond extract.  I serve it with pears (canned pears chilled overnight with a little honey and cinnamon) then top with a little bit of whipped cream.

These are just like the German pancakes I love order at IHOP! Great with fresh lemon juice squeezed over them, then dusted with powdered sugar. These are lot like thick crepes, so you might find it easier to cook them that way. Pour some batter in a small, oiled skillet & swirl the batter to evenly coat the pan. The edges will appear dry & slightly browned when it's time to filp them. You can alternate between 2 heated skillets to make it move along faster, too.

I have not tried this recipe yet, but it is correct  (except we do not put sugar in the batter). Milk, eggs and flour. German pancakes are like a crepe or a blintz, very thin. I was reading the reviews and most people complaint about the pancakes sticking to the pan, naturally there should be butter in the pan, I think Deborah forgot to mention this in the recipe. 
Pancakes can also be served with apple sauce. Some people spread jam on the pancakes and roll them up. Taste very good with fried apples etc. 
Leftover pancakes are cut in very thin strips and we
make a "Flaedle Soup" in Schwaebia.

I followed the recipe exactly, and was disappointed.  The pancakes were extremely eggy and hard to flip as there wasn't quite as much flour in them as I felt there should be to really hold their shape.  My grandmother made German pancakes throughout my childhood and hers were more crepe-like and not nearly so sweet.  I won't be making these again.

This is very difficult to make.  The serving for four does not make enough for four, maybe three.  You have to pour enough to make it a little thick in the pan so you can turn it without it breaking.  I would suggest using a very small frying pan.  The low rating is predominately due to the degree of difficulty in cooking this.  Flavor was ok

While the flavor was nice, they were just too difficult to work with. It seems all those with a German background had more success....what is the trick? I let them cook until dry, as one reviewer suggested, but the problem is with flipping them. Where they didn't tear, they instead bunched up which led to them being underdone in those spots. I used a non-stick pan with a little butter but they just flat out refused to flip nicely.

Made exactly as written.  My husband liked them better than I did and my son really didn't like them...so that is why I gave this recipe 3 stars.  Could only make one at a time which was a little time consuming...probably will not make again.

These are fantastic...I used the toothpick around the edge idea and the first one didn't work out so good but the rest worked great! I made an Caramel-Disaronno Apple Filling and these were delicious as a dessert for my German dinner!

A little too sweet so I would suggest less sugar.  But otherwise they are just like my German mom used to make!  Wonderful memories!

I loved this German pancake and will be making this often. These can be a little tricky to flip so I used a small Teflon skillet and buttered the bottom before adding the egg mixture.  Loosen the edges before you try to flip the pancake.  It is a nice eggy pancake that is light and excellent served with fruit and a little powdered sugar.  For us, it was a perfect breakfast.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I also used 1/4 cup of flour instead of what the recipe calls for though to make them a little less eggy and a little thicker. I coupled the pancakes with some jam and my toddler gobbled them up for breakfast.

I have been making regular pancakes for many years. Sometimes my husband and son would complain they were too thick and had no taste.
I made Barbarella's German pancakes and my husband and son they were the best pancakes they have ever eaten. Definitely a keeper, a very big thank you!

Really easy.  Fun to serve with a couple kinds of berries, some whipped cream, chopped pecans and maybe drizzling a little chocolate or good quality espresso balsamic across the top of the rolled pancakes.

These were way too thin. I couldn't even flip it over I had to add a lot more flour. Crepes are better.

After making my first couple, I would have rated this a one. They were so thin, and hard to flip...I kept sticking them to themselves whenever I touched them, and on top of that, my pan was too hot and they were burning within the first three seconds. Needless to say, I got frustrated. And so I decided to make them thicker...LOTS thicker. They still stuck to the pan, but they were easier to remove since there wasn't as much chance of ripping them if you made a wrong move. They were delicious, but I'm not sure they were worth the headache of making them.

Very simple, good tasting, quick recipe. After reading other reviews I took a step from swedish pancakes and added a bit of melted butter to the batter for easier flipping. Worked great, nothing stuck!

Very good. I thought they tasted a bit on the "eggy" side, but still found deliciouos. I think of these as crepes. They were great with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and jam, and would be equally good filled with some kind of creamy chicken dish for dinner. Also, I put some chocolate chips in the middle of one, rolled it up while still hot so the chocolate melted, and then sprinkled on some powdered sugar and served with raspberry jam. Yummy!

It needs a pinch of salt, to balance it.
I love adding real vanilla bean extract.
Fill it with creek yogurt and drizzle some maple syrup. Serve with fresh fruit... and the mornings will never be the same.

These are very similar to the German pancakes my Mom used to make when I was a kid - she's full German, married an American GI in Berlin - only brought over 1 suitcase to America - and 1 cookbook was in it - 

I changed this recipe to resemble the thickness of my Mom's recipe - basically multiplied the ingredients by 4, added a pinch of salt, but removed some of the milk:

1 cup flour 
2 cups milk 
pinch of salt 
1/2 cup sugar 
8 eggs 

mixed in the kitchenaid until mostly smooth

cooked as described, on medium heat in a non-stick skillet

delicious served with sugar and lemon (like in my childhood) or with syrup (for my kids) 

YUM! LECKER!

Exactly what my mom was craving.  Now that she can't go to her favorite pancake house, she asked me to find a similar recipe and this was it!!!  Melted butter, powdered sugar, and lemon juice make this a tastey breakfast treat.

These are really lovely, & cut carbs but are rich.  Much easier than crepes.  Skipped the blender, whisked only, still tender.

I made two batches:  one as is, and one with whole wheat flour & raw sugar.  We actually preferred the whole wheat/raw sugar version in a side-by-side comparison!  The texture was the same, and the raw sugar did not overpower the flavor at all, just made the cake a touch richer.

We followed the suggestion of using heaping tablespoons of flour, added a tiny bit of salt, used a pre-heated cast iron skillet, sprayed it on rare occasion with cooking spray, and the only pancake that I needed to throw out for the dog was cooked on a cooler pan half-way through the cooking process when I was both playing with the temp *&* trying to fit two smaller cakes onto my skillet......., so IMHO, trying to cook on a non-pre-heated pan is probably the cause of having to 'throw out the first pancake'?  ....... but it took time for me to know that we want to use the heat setting just above the third notch on our burner's dial........  

Yes, these are somewhat crepe like, but are more dense........., leave it to Germans to have a heavier more solid 'crepe'.

I personally liked the butter-cinnamon-sugar combo more than any other we tried (the lemon/powdered sugar was nice, but not my fav...), pancake syrup was okay too....... depends on what you have with these perhaps......

Want to try a savory version in soup next, and to make these ahead.

Very simple to make and tasty. I realize these aren't meant to be crepes, however, they are pretty similar and if I have to choose between crepes and these, I'd definitely go for the crepes. The batter was really thin and a tad harder to flip than what I'm used to. My son enjoyed them and so did I. I might make them again but again, I prefer crepes.

Been making these ever since I tried one @ the old Farmers Market in Kitchener which is a huge German community in Ontario.  My sons all request these when I ask them what they want for breakfast.  We spread them with jam then roll them up :) LOVE!!

I used 1/4 c orange juice and 1/2 c french vanilla coffee creamer because I was out of milk.  The flavor was great but they are difficult to cook without burning.  I measured them out by 1/4 c and got 7 medium-sized pancakes.

The taste is great, but the creation of these things is too hard!  I made 4 servings and it was too hard to flip them and this isn't my first time making them.  It also wasn't enough to feed four, just my husband and 3 year old daughter.  I had to make a new batch for myself, but I used another recipe.

This was a great recipe. I have a great deal of experience flipping pancakes (was a breakfast chef for quite some time), so I had no problems with the cooking process. I was worried the batter was too runny but tried it anyway, they came out perfect. I'd never had german pancakes till now but I definitely will again!

Fabulous! My tips are to add about a 1/4 tsp  of vanilla extract, and you can cut out about 150 calories by using Splenda instead of sugar, you can't tell the difference! Also, I stuffed the inside with hot strawberries in a Butter Lite syrup. My favorite pancake recipe by far!

I really liked this recipe. They tasted great! The only thing i would suggest is that rather than tilting the pan to get it circular just pour the batter into the pan and cook it like a regular pancake

My grandfather was born in Germany, and my mom made these when I was a kid. The taste of this recipe brought me back. I had a hard time getting them as thin as I remember, and also staying together as I flipped them, and I used a small pan. My mom used a large pan and we rolled then up with powdered sugar or jelly. I did find that it helped some when I lowered the heat on the burner. I will try again in the near future.

Ok,  so I made this recipe this morning and it brought me to tears.  They tasted just like my Oma's. I have a family of five so I tripled the recipe.  But I used one cup of flour and added vanilla to our taste.   Sprinkled sugar, rolled them up and they were perfect!  As for them sticking, don't try to flip them too soon.  The edges need to be curling up a bit and the surface should be dull, not shiny.  Butter helps too.  Thank you for bring back so many wonderful memories.  Now I can make them with my kids!!

I made it with 4 Table spoons of flower instead of 3, it makes it easier to make a circle because it is more thick.

I'm 68 and these have been a Sunday morning event forever!  So the word GREAT doesn't even cover it!  BUT.....and there is always one of those lurking.............to do them justice, I made them almost cover the bottom of the pan when tipping, dipping and shaking the pool of batter in the pan.  

Sprinkle a bit of sugar on a warm plate so they don't stick.  When you remove one from the pan, put butter on one side of it, followed by sprinkled granulated sugar.  Then, squeeze about a quarter lemon on there.  Then roll it up and place on a warm plate in the oven.  Repeat until you have about 4 or 5 on the plate.  Then, pour a big glass of cold, whole milk to have close by.  You will be needing it!  Cut the rolls into about 1 inch sections, one bite at a time, and make your way through this delicious feast!  Then hit the milk!  

I put my recipe on RecipeCenter.com in 2005 but the site went south.  People there loved them!!

Only thing I would change next time is to leave out or reduce the sugar and add a wee bit of salt.  But excellent as is, as well. Used a smaller skillet to control the size and shape to make them easier to flip,with a silicon spatula run around the edge to loosen it  and then slid underneath to flip it.

I don't have a picture to show as we ate them immediately.  They were a bit tricky to get out of the pan for the first flip.  By the time they came out(the last two)the batter was gone. Some were served with cinnamon sugar mixture and the favorite were with Nutella.
By the way I used a non stick pan that I coated with oil and reapplied as I thought it needed. Cooking spray would be more convenient.

I love the simplicity.  Easy to make (with some practice) and tasted like they should.  I did take the advice of some of the other reviewers and used heaping table spoons of flour.  Honestly, I'm not sure if that helped or not but it certainly didn't hurt.  And the toothpick idea to help detach from the edges and to help flip worked very well also.

**AMAZING**  ... did I mention that these are amazing!!!  The only thing I did different was I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 3 "heaping" tablespoons of flour, the rest I followed to a tee!  I put a good amount of melted butter in my pan and had the heat on 5 (medium), made sure it was nice and hot and then put the mix in.  They were a bit tricky to flip but not difficult, just be gentle and patient and it will work like a dream.  I got it on the first try!  I added raspberries, bananas, sausage pieces, maple syrup and Oikos vanilla greek yogurt and rolled them up and ate them.  So amazing.  Thank you so much for the recipe, one of the best on All Recipes.

Fast and simple to make. Be sure your oil or butter is hot enough before you pour your batter into the pan or on the griddle. I make homemade butter pecan ice cream and save the pecan flavored butter to use in making these pancakes. The result is delicious! 

Be brave when turning them, I use a rubber spatula. If the underside is nicely browned and you've got enough oil/butter in the pan, the pancake will slide around without any problems. Simply use the spatula to slide under the pancake ~ it will bunch up on the spatula, but when you flip it over, it will straighten out when you slide/push the skillet around.

These are so simple to make.  Good for a quick breakfast.  They are more like crepes.  For those who had trouble flipping them - Make sure pan is hot and spray with a cooking spray and also use a good dollop of butter, put the lid on until pancake is pretty much cooked and then flip.  You should have no trouble flipping them using this method.

easy delicious recipe for crepes. I could not shape them at all though because the batter was so runny, they came out all kinds of crazy shapes, lol. Used cooking spray to make them easy to flip. Once done, I put a little butter & Squeezed a lil lemon on them and they taste like german crepes from Ihop. You could add all kinds of fruits and flavors to this. next time i'll try with vanilla extract and a lil more flour.

I've been looking for this recipe for years!  My Grandma used to make these "Swedish Pancakes" for me as a child.  Funny, all of Europe wants to claim their country's name on them!  HA…my Grandma wasn't German or Swedish!  
These are so easy to prepare and so easy to make…but they are AMAZING!  Thanks Deborah for sharing Barbarella's pancakes…my Grandma has passed and I didn't have the quantities of ingredients…tomorrow's breakfast for my family!!!

I have to give this 5 stars as it is close to the pancakes my Great-Grandmother made.  My family calls these "Roll Up and Cuts " since we spread the cooked pancake with jam or sprinkle it with sugar, roll it up and cut it.  Wonderful.

For those who have trouble flipping the pancake, it does take a bit of practice.  I was taught to tilt the pan and lift a corner for the batter to run underneath the pancake, but again, it takes practice.

Easy and delicious.  Brushed the pan with butter before adding the batter and used the toothpick trick (ran it around the pancake before flipping).  The last one I made turned out the best as I had gotten the hang of it.  The only downside is that it does only make four.

This recipe was very good but it was so much like a crepe.  Same method of cooking. I followed it exactly. It's just a little bit thicker.  I will stick to my crepes. But thank you for a good recipe. Was worth trying.

This recipe is made exactly how I was brought up to make german pancakes, we love to put jam on them (lightly) and roll em up... my son is a diabetic and this is a good easy diabetic friendly way to cure a sweet tooth.  We just use sugar free jam and it's enough sweet to save the day! Thanks for posting this recipe!  Anna

Easy and delicious!!  I did run a toothpick around the edges to loosen it before flipping (as suggested by another reviewer).  I used a small skillet also and sprayed pam in it for just the first pancake.   I topped mine with honey and powdered sugar! Yummy!

These pancakes were excellent! The taste was so much sweeter and lighter than normal pancakes. I added just a pinch of salt to the batter and the only issue I had was sticking when I tried to flip them, but by the last one I got the hang of it. I put a thin layer of grape jam in the middle and sprinkle of powdered sugar on top and my 3 year old ate them up - he is normally so picky!

This recipe is okay, but I've had better German pancakes.  Also, I had to add about three extra tablespoons of flour to the batter.  They were practically impossible to flip without the extra flour.

These are almost exactly what my German grandma used to make for us.  We would eat them with butter, powdered sugar and lemon juice.  It takes me back to a little girl, spending the weekend at my grandma's house.

My German grandmother used to make me these on the weekends for dinner. The flavor of this recipe was great! The smaller pan you use to cook these, the better. They were extremely difficult to flip! I added a little extra flour to make them thicker, which made them easier to flip.

The flavor of these pancakes is really great, but I think I should have let the batter sit for about 30 minutes before making them.  The latter cakes had a better texture than the first ones.  If you make these, make sure to use medium to medium-low heat and wait until the surface is no longer shiny before attempting to flip them.  Also, the thinnest spatula you can find is a must! Finally, wiping the pan after every pancake comes out helps me out a lot, so you don't get uneven cooking from leftover bits of butter/oil/cooking spray.

The flavor of the pancakes were delicious just like the ones my Oma made for me when I was a kid. I would have to agree with some of the other reviews on the servings. This recipe only made 5 pancakes (although they were large the light texture was hardly enough for 4 servings). I will double the batch the next time I make them. I also added a  dash of vanilla & cinnamon to the batter before cooking and filled them with chocalate Nutella (from a jar) and fresh strawberries and bananas. This is a perfect dessert.

This was very good and reminded me of my mother standing over the stove cooking me crepes when I was a child. I loved them and she couldn't cook them fast enough! I used the orange sauce for crepes, which I obtained from this site to pour over them. Delicious.

These were a real treat with butter, sugar, and cinnamon rolled inside.  The texture and taste were just like my German grandmother used to make...  I made them on a griddle and it took me a couple of tries to get the shape right - but they sure were easy to turn!

I had made these pancakes years ago, but lost the recipe.  I tried others that were baked in the oven, but we prefer this one.  Thanks!  I usually serve with apple slices that I cook with a little butter, cinnamon and sugar.  Place the warm apples on half of the pancake and cover with the other half.  Sprinkle with confectioners sugar.  Yum!  Tonight I had more pancakes than apples, so I made rhubarb sauce with rhubarb from our garden.  I used that in place of the apples and we liked it even better.  The sweet pancake and tart rhubarb was a real taste treat!  You must try this.

This is definitely a German version of pancakes. For those who crave rich, thick buttermilk pancakes, this recipe isn't for you! I got kind of nervous seeing how runny the batter was, so I cheated and doubled the flour amount. I also only had whole wheat flour, which made it gritty. I also didn't want to use a blender to mix the ingredients, so I kept at it by hand. The cakes were very flat in shape, so I just made several. Once covered with syrup and butter, it did the trick OK. But I doubt I'll make this recipe again.

In short, don't listen to me. Be your own judge. Maybe it had to do with my rebellious nature to not follow the instructions!

I use this recipe each year for a New Year's Day brunch.  Adults only attend and I platter all kinds of cut fruits with a simple syrup, powdered sugar and shaved chocolates.  Everyone can pick their toppings and it is a big hit!

SO good! and  these are easy to make.
Thank you for posting recipe!  
I had 1 that ripped,  but fried up the last of the batter for patch, added filling & rolled it up- worked fine!  : )

My absolute go to for Swedish pancakes!  We cook these thicker than crepes (we don’t like paper thin crepes) and I always have to double the recipe.

Really hard to make. I had trouble keeping the batter in one place on the griddle, amd they were difficult to flip... :( 
But they tasted awesome!(Especially with some pear butter added on top with powdered sugar!)

I must have made them too big, only got two pancakes out of the measurements for 4 servings but they were almost as good as my Germa mama used to make. I remember rolling them up with applesauce on the inside and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar

I'm an awful person. I double the flour. Otherwise it was too runny and had the consistency of a fried custard. Whole wheat is also easier to incorporate by hand and avoid clumps if you have it available already, and there isn't enough of it, even doubled to really leave a flavor. I'm on the third time of making it now. Good recipe. GREAT way to use up a bunch of eggs fast if doubling or quading the recipe.

Wow, this is very easy! I can make this pancake easily. I thought about German food because my mother and I met a German lady last week having German bread and some salt for the wedding we attended. She gave the bread to the newly wedded couple, and the couple shared it with everyone.

For those of you having a hard time flipping them maybe try this recipe instead! I have been making these for years and I use a very similar recipe. Tastes great, still thin enough to roll, easy to flip!
3 eggs, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 2TBPS sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp vanilla. Sprinkle with cinnamon, sugar, and syrup when you done and roll it up!

As others have stated, the pancakes are incredibly runny. I did add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg  for some extra flavour.

It's our go to meal. However I suggest hand mixing rather than blending as it gives a lighter product to mix by hand.

My mother who was German also made these.  Wonderful treat for breakfast, she ALWAYS made a simple syrup (sugar and water), I never knew there was maple syrup until I was in my teens.  Some of the German Heritage Groups have cookbooks, I have one from CO that is full of recipes I grew up with.

This was a great omelet! For nearly 45 years I enjoyed German pancakes that seemed to have more something in them then these eggy culprits. These pancakes were tasty but not what I remember. I never got the recipe before my mother passed away, so I will keep looking.
