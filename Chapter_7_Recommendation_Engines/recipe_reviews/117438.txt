This recipe is so awesome, tasty and easy to make.  I did make two changes though, I used a can of diced Italian style tomoatoes with liquid (wal-mart brand) instead of the tomato and I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp.  Everything turned out so tasty!  I will be making again and again!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

I was surprised at how much great flavor there was in here, as it came together so quickly. There isn't a whole lot of sauce, so if you really want to coat your pasta I'd suggest adding white wine or chicken stock, whatever you prefer to make it more liquid. I used canned tomatoes since fresh are out of season up here, with green chilis, and we really liked the spice. This dish is like a blank palate - adding fresh herbs or seasonings can really make this your own, but the flavor is fresh and fine as-is. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was very tasty and a nice balance of ingredients. I noticed there wasn't enough liquid in the sauce just before adding the noodles to the spinach, tomato, garlic mixture so I scooped about 1/2 cup of pasta water into the skillet and that helped a lot. I added sliced red bell pepper and next time will probably also try some artichoke hearts for extra flavor and texture. Very good recipe to work with.

Wonderful! I made minor changes, using canned diced tomatoes. I added 1/4 c chopped onion and  used about 16 oz of fresh baby spinach. (I had a lot I needed to use up), 20-25 med size frozen shrimp and about 4 oz of fettucini. I had a mix of romano and parm cheese freshly grated that I used and threw in one oz of laughing cow light to make a creamy sauce. OH MY WAS THIS GOOD!

Very good!  I would definitely cut down on the pasta - about half.  I also added some wine to the sauce which gave it a great flavor.  We will definitely have this again!

Using this recipe as the base I did tweak it somewhat. I used 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of butter and fresh oregano for the seasoning. I smashed 8 cloves of the garlic and minced it with the salt. I added a half cup of good white wine after the spinach had cooked. Everything was done in one skillet as I already had enough cooked acini depepe (soup mac ) on hand. I did not use the tomato or the shredded Parmesan. I put a tablespoon of grated parm at the end of the cooking process. This was the best shrimp and pasta dish I ever ate!!!

I had to double everything to the one pound of pasta.  It seemed too "empty".  After doubling, it was awesome!  Loved it very much!!

Very good recipe.  The first time I made it I followed the original recipe, but it was a little to dry for my taste.  But enjoyed it even more the next time I made with a can of diced tomatoes with juice like the other reviewer suggested.

This turned out great.  I tweaked the recipe just a little.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and I used a bunch of spinach and next time I will use two bunches because we like spinach.

We really enjoyed this. I did not have fresh tomatoes or spinach but it didn't matter, I followed the recipe otherwise. I drained a box of frozen spinach very well and used a can of diced fire roasted tomatos. I can only imagine this will be even better when tomatoes come back in season!

My husband really liked this.  I used thawed frozen spinach 9not well drained), some garlic powder and salt (then omitted the plain salt), and added about 1 tbsp of white wine.  Used cooked shrimp and accidentally heated too long and they were a little tough.  Used a can of tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano and did not drain.  Topped with mozzarella since that is what I had.  Was good.  Definitely no problem with low liquid.

Wow!  I made a lot of changes, but this was a great starting off point and I ended up with a delicious dish!   I sauteed red bell pepper, red onion and garlic, then added mushrooms and the spinach, sauteed for a while longer, then added Lunds Tuscan Seasoning (like italian, but a little spicier) and white wine.  Let the white wine reduce then added a can of tomatoes and more seasoning and a little more wine and cooked a few minutes longer.   Then added about 1/3 lb of rotini, parmesan cheese and as suggested by another reviewer added 2 triangles of lite Laughing Cow swiss to add a little creaminess.   Turned out fantastic!

this was pretty good for what a short time it took to make it, but definitly nothing special. lacks consistancy and could use way more spice.

Very tasty!  And it makes for a great weeknight dinner because it's so quick to make.  My tweaks:  I added 1/2 cup of white wine, 1/2 cup of low-sodium chicken broth, 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, and a little more parmesan than what the recipe calls for.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I love this recipe! It is quick and easy and delicious! I agree that it is a good base for you to change to suit your palette. As other reviewers noted: It is a thin sauce. So I use canned tomatoes with the juice. The sauce is still a lil thin for me... So I then add a small amout of water or canned tomato sauce or a lil bit of both. I added onions, more garlic and a pinch of sugar (sometimes I don't add the sugar). And I tried the recipe with mozzarell cheese. Family loves it!

This was excellent, but I did make some adjustments, similar to the other reviewers.  Quantity wise, I used about two thirds of a pound of pasta, a 9 oz package of fresh spinach, and added a half of a red pepper, chopped into about 1 inch squares.  I removed the spinach & garlic from the pan once the spinach was wilted to keep it from overcooking.  It only took about 3 - 4 min.  I also added some white wine to the shrimp/tomatoes/peppers in the pan to make a bit of a sauce.  Finally, I added a dash of salt after putting the pasta and spinach back in with the other ingredients.  Will definitely do this again!

This was good, I only made a half batch and I used sun dried tomatoes since I had some on hand and I don't like plum tomatoes.  I also used frozen pre-cooked shrimp because that's what I had on hand so I just warmed them up in the skillet.  I thought it was a bit much pasta for the amount of shrimp and spinach, but the flavor was good.

Ahhhhh-mazing!! I've been looking for new recipes that are not only healthier, but that the whole family can enjoy; and this one hit the spot!! I changed it up a little, as others did. I used about 2/3 of the fettucine, added broccoli, and used del monte canned tomatoes. I also used a bag of frozen shrimp. The kids ate it up and me and my husband loved it too. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

As these types of dishes go, this was very quick to make as there is little to no chopping and cutting involved. The first thing I did was set the water to boiling, and by the time the pasta was cooked, the rest was ready to go, so it really is not a time burden. The flavors could have infused together a bit more - it seems like the type of dish that might taste better left over on the second day. However, it was still quite delicious.  Note: I did use canned tomato since it was on hand.

I was skeptical about this recipe because it looked too simple to be good, but I made it because I happened to have all the ingredients. I used a can of tomatoes as the other reviewers suggested, frozen spinach instead of fresh, and added black olives and green onions. This was excellent! Even my 3 and 5 year olds liked it. I like that it is easy and healthy. Will definitely try again, maybe add some lemon juice and red pepper flakes.

This was delicious!  My picky 6 year old loved it (he ate around the spinach) and the rest of us enjoyed the whole dish.  A great weeknight meal- prep to dinner table is SUPER fast.  Really recommended for an easy & yummy meal.  Am going to try this with chicken in tbe future- I'm hoping that will reheat better for lunch leftovers than shrimp does.
