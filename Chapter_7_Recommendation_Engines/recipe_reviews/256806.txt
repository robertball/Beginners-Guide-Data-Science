It was very good!  Everyone loved it at both superbowl parties we went to. 

I used the McCormick's pulled pork seasoning packet because our store didn't have the pulled chicken one. Not sure how different they are?

I made it in the crock pot the day before, put it in a smaller casserole dish, warmed it up in the oven right before the party, and sprinkled a handful of shredded cheddar on top and garnished it with some green onions. It was pretty delicious looking and I forgot to take a photo, of course.

Anyways, it easy to make a super good.

Being from Kansas City I can say that we love our BBQ and we love our sports teams, With that being said, this is the perfect dip to sit down and watch a game. It was super simple to make and bursting with flavor. I really liked the addition of the red onion on top because this is something we always did with chili as well. Thanks for representing Kansas City in this great way McCormick!
