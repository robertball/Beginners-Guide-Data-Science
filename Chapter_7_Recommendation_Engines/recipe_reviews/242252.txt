Excellent!  I made a small batch of this for another recipe.  No tequila on hand, but this was still pretty good.

Initially this was lacking punch and heat.  We  added a jalapeno and a 2nd onion which picked it up a little.

Tastes great, but took way longer than 20 minutes. Maybe I just stink at chopping tomatoes... :)
