These cookies need time to develop their moistness and flacor.  This recipe should state "Ready in" 1 day & 40 minutes!  I made these last night, and was so disappointed that I almost didn't bake the remaining batches.  But this morning....YUM.  What a difference!  I added a dash of cinnamon to the dough, and used a glaze instead of the frosting.

There are truly terrific. After a year, this is the recipe that finally got me to join allrecipies.com - just so that I could rate it. I used fresh cranberries lightly chopped with my Braun hand blender. At a request from a friend, I added some white baker's chocolate to the frosting which went over very well. I frosted only half of the cookies and found that many people (including me) preferred the tart, unfrosted cookie. I did end up having to bake them longer (18 minutes) before they turned "golden brown."

Excellent, soft, cake-like cookies.  Seeing that there was a little orange juice in the batter, I also added orange zest.  Then in the frosting, I added OJ instead of the water.  These turned out fabulous, and we all love them.  The cranberry combination with the orange is awesome, and the frosting is fabulous.  Not too sweet, not too tart, just perfect!

The cookie itself is 5-star quality, but I rated this 4 stars because I did not care for the frosting. It turned out to be an unappealing beige color, not white, and was more like a heavy buttercream frosting, more suitable for a cake. The cookies are tart and do need a little sweetness on top - after frosting only a few cookies and throwing the rest of the frosting out, I made the glaze from the "Iced Pumpkin cookies" on this site and that did the trick. BTW, those pumpkin cookies are easy, delicious and perfect for the fall holidays as well.

These are sooo delicious! Needless to say they didn't last very long in our house, even my 8yr old daughter loved them. The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I was surprised by the burst of flavor in these cookies. I was automatically demanded to make them again, and to share the recipe. When forming the dough, if you use frozen cranberries, they will become quite wet and smoosh together unevenly when you put them on the cookie sheet. Not to worry, though--they still stay together well and taste great.

I have been making these cookies (with the exact recipe) for years.  My friends and coworkers always beg me for the recipe or request that I bake them a batch every holiday. They have already put in their requests for this holiday season.

These are excellent.  Great texture and the frosting is a great balance - it sends them over the top.  I followed the recipe to the letter except that I used Craisins rather than fresh cranberries.  I used these in a cookie swap and must say that I had one of the best cookies there.  Will definitely make again.

Easy to make, i'm not real into this type of cookie...my husband requested a cranberry cookie, i found this. He said they "aren't bad" and would give them a 4 out of 5. When I asked if I should look for a different recipe, he said no. So I guess that means he liked them. I had him try one w/frosting and one with out, and he said definately with frosting. **Update, he made me change the rating to a 5. Said that they are definately a 5 the day after, but only a 4 fresh out of the oven. He also wants me to make another batch a.s.a.p.

Very good cookie..great taste.  I little soft and didn't set up as much as I would have liked.  Next time will increase baking time.  I preferred them unfrosted..the frosting was a little too sweet for my taste.  Will make them again.

These are great cookies. I didn't have any cranberries, so I used 1 1/4 Cup of Blueberry Craisins and 1 1/4 Cup of raisins. They turned out great. The icing I used milk in place of the water. Everyone loved these. Will make again maybe next time will try Cranberries or do 1/2 and 1/2.

I made these and everyone loved them the only thing I changed was I did half walnuts and have chocolate chips but the recipe still would have been great without them.

These are a cookie version of a cranberry bread.  The only change I made was I added two heaping tablespoons of fresh grated orange peel to the recipe.  I am taking them for Thanksgiving dessert!  They're yummy!

These cookies were AMAZING! i didn't use the frosting, and i was glad because it would have been too much. Also i would suggest baking only half the dough and saving the rest in the fridge, for later in the week. The cookies really softened up after a few days, so it was a good thing i didn't make them all that first day. Try these cookie, and i hope you'll love them just like i do!!!

I love how moist these cookies are.  I made them with fresh chopped cranberries, skipped the walnuts and used almond extract in the frosting instead of vanilla.

Very good.  No need for the frosting.
