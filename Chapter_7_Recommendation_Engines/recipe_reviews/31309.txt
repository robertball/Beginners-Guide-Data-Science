I substituted it with strawberry extract since the raspberry was twice as much.  Turned out nicely.  I added more sugar (3/4 c) and more extract (2T) and also added about a tablespoon of vanilla extract.  People really liked the dip.  In addition to the fruit platter, I included angel food cake.

This is a great dip!!! Used it for a fruit platter & wound up putting it on lots of other things as well!!! Couldn't find the Raspberry Extract though, (searched high & low) so I substituted with Raspberry Jam, to taste!!!! It came out so smooth & tastey!!!! Thanks*

Always a hit! I "lightened" it with Lowfat Cream Cheese and Sour Cream with no flavor loss.

I made this for a baby shower this weekend. The pink color was perfect (it was a girl) and everyone loved it.I couldn't find raspberry extract so I added a container of raspberry yogurt--it tasted great.

This is good - tastes like a very thick raspberry yogurt. My raspberry extract was virtually colorless, so I added a handful of frozen raspberries for a pinker color (baby shower was for twin girls, so the pinker the better!). The recipe doesn't sound like it makes a lot, but you'd be surprised how far 2 cups of fruit dip will go! I served with both red & green grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew and pears cut in thin wedges.

I'd give it more stars if I could...it's that good. If you don't make this for any occaision...you're REALLY missing out.  It isn't only how good it tastes, it's the ease of making it...almost no effort.

I changed this up for what I was wanting (a strawberry-based pretzel dip), and it turned out outstanding! I used a cup of low-fat sour cream, a block of low-fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup white sugar, no extract, and about a cup of diced strawberries. I mixed the strawberries with the sugar and let it sit for about five minutes to get juicy before adding the other ingredients. I mixed it well with a hand mixer and then let it chill for a couple hours before serving with pretzels. So good! I could eat it with a spoon! Thanks for sharing! :)

Very good BUT - it does need more raspberry extract than the amount given. I used real cream cheese (I appreciate the fat)

This was fabulous!  I made it for a BBQ and just served it with strawberries and there was nothing left over!  I used raspberry extract, but added about 1/2 tsp more because I wanted a stronger taste.  It mixed up plain white, so I did add about 2 drops of food coloring, but next time would just use 1 drop.  Will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe.  I use almond extract or amaretto.  It really is yummy with all fruits, especially strawberries, apples, and pineapple.  Also, instead of (or in addition to) sour cream, add a jar of marshmellow cream!  YUM!

This was delicious!  I made it for a baby shower and the pastel pink color was perfect.  I used strawberry extract since I didn't have any raspberry.  I will be making this again.

Wonderful!
Make day ahead so flavours can marry.
I surrounded dip with halved strawberries (including stems), kiwi slices, mango spears, pineapple spears, banana spears, pretzels & cubed angel food cake. I used light sour cream & light cream cheese, which didn't compromise the taste. Couldn't find raspberry extract at any specialty store so I subbed with berry cream cheese, added some frozen raspberries & pureed with an immersion blender, until I got the right colour. Served this at my 1st. grandchild's baby shower & there was none left. There's no better fruit dip! Thanks Heather.

Yummy! I brought this to a baby shower, an every raved about it! I wasn't able to find raspberry extract, but I did find strawberry. I know it would have been just as great with either one!

Delish... the only thing it needed was a little more color so we added a couple drops of red food coloring to get the pink we wanted. Everyone loved it.. no leftovers here!

This dip was really good, I made it for my own baby shower.  I used Philly light cream cheese and sour cream, really good.  Everybody loved it, and had the joy of dipping their favourite fruits.

I made this for my sister-in-laws shower and everyone loved it.  i only made a few changes to the recipe.  i used lite sour cream and cream cheese and i used seedless strawberry jam to taste.  i also added strawberry extract to give it a little more flavor.  since i used the jam, i did not have to add as much sugar. the only measurement from the recipe i did use was for the sour cream and cream cheese. everything else i did to taste.  i will definately make this again.

Delicious and so pretty.  Used strawberry flavoring.  Would consider using strawberry cream cheese next time just to save money on the flavoring because it would probably taste the same.

Excellent dip for fruit.  Loved it!  Just a tip - I didn't have the extract either but used raspberry jello (dry) instead.  Don't remember how much - just a few tablespoons.  Tasted terrific and super easy!

I made this today and I must confess that I did not read until just now that the raspberries were to be a garnish.. oops.  I used splenda and some sugar free raspberry flavoring that I had on had and it turned out very well.  In using low fat and sugar free ingredients, I ended up with a guilt free dip for my fruit!

I was disappointed in this recipe because it smelled and tasted too strongly of sour cream.  I had high hopes but will try one without the sour cream next time.  Thanks for sharing.

Soooo tasty! I just did the cream cheese, sour cream and sugar then I added one and a half containers of raspberry flavored yoplait yogurt. It was so simple and incredibly tasty. I liked it best with apples.

This was a huge success.  The baby's mom would not let me throw away the leftovers.  She was hoping there would be some left over to satisfy her late night cravings.

Good recipe, though I thought it was pretty typical for a cream cheese/fruit dip.  Others liked it, but it wasn't really a five star recipe.  It was good.

Yum!  Perfect consistency and tasted like a light cheesecake to me.  I also used strawberry extract because I couldn't find raspberry and just garnished with sliced strawberries.

Delicious and creamy dip.  Everyone kept asking me if it had strawberry (couldn't find raspberry extract) in it.  Of course the 32 ladies in my section at work almost died when I told them it had not only cream cheese but sour cream in it.  Oh well...you only live once!  Thanks!

Made the following changes after reading reviews...Replaced sour cream with organic yogurt (still used cream cheese also), replaced sugar with raw honey, did not use extract, I used real raspberries for the flavor and put everything in the food processor.

Very good, although I would like to use a seedless berry next time. Great pink color for a baby shower, though!

This is so delicious.  I can't even tell you how many times I had to print this for people.  I'm beginning to think people invite me to gatherings because of this recipe!

This is really wonderful! I may not have let the cream cheese soften enough (I can't get Neufchatel here) because I had to mix it again later to make the few white chunks blend in better. I used thawed frozen berries. Beautiful pink color. A little less sugar would be great, too. Thanks, Heatherfeather! :o)
