I really liked this. I scaled it down to 1 serving, but it was still rather large! I used my box grater instead of the food processor just because I wanted easier clean-up. The cauliflower adds a mild flavor to the eggs and is so good for you. I added yellow pepper only because I needed to use it or lose it. At the end, I garnished with fresh tomatoes, again because I had them. This is a basic recipe that can easily be tweaked with green onion, other fresh veggies, additional spices, and even a paleo friendly cheese.

I’ve been prepping breakfasts in muffin tins then freezing them for future days. This recipe is MUCH better than my previous ones! Only difference, I used avocado instead of avocado oil, added spinach, and used muffin tins to bake. Was AMAZING!

I did not have a pan that I could put in the oven. It needs this. I had to flip it to get it to cook on both sides. I did add some cheese on the top but I could have added more. I will try this again with the right pan. I liked the eggs with it. I would put more garlic in the recipe.

This was really good! Trader Joe’s cauliflower rice sautéed with Olive oil and garlic. When it was almost done, I added some thinly sliced zucchini and let cook for a few minutes. Added a little crumbled bacon. Beat 4 eggs with 1/4 cp milk, salt, and pepper. Poured over the rice/zucchini mix and topped with some queso. Baked at 350 for about 30minutes. Great flavor, although Next time I will skip the added salt. The queso was salty enough.
I know I took quite A few liberties with the recipe, but will definitely make again and the basic concept is the same. Hubby and daughter liked as well!
