So good!  Don't know if they're supposed to flatten out, but ours didn't.  We do live in Denver though.  Hard to stop eating.

This is the most wonderful gingersnap recipe ever!  My mom made this exact recipe every year when I was growing up. I am so glad to find the recipe again!  This makes soft gingersnaps, not the hard ones like you buy in the store. (Although if you want them crispy, just let them sit out for a day!)

This is the best gingersnap recipe I have ever tried.   I copied the recipe exactly for this first time.  Next time I may increase the spices.

This is my favorite ginger snap cookie.  I have been making it for years, don't know why I didn't review it before.  It's soft and chewy, a very "full" cookie.  Easy to make, and always a hit!

My husband loved these and isn't a fan of gingerbread.  These were the first recipe that I've come across that didn't taste too much like molasses.  We will be using these for gingerbread cookies come Christmas for sure.

These cookies are excellent and will definitely become a Christmas baking staple!  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly as printed.  The cookies did not flatten out as illustrated, rather they remained in little balls and were quite chewy (just how I like them). I just made them again today, and I guess I was feeling impatient because I did not beat the ingredients, nor did I refrigerate for an hour.  I just added all the ingredients together and stirred with a fork.  This time, they flattened out like the picture, and were about 1/4 inch thick....still chewy but much flatter.   I a pretty novice baker so maybe this is easily explained.  Regardless...a great cookie!! I'm going to go eat one right now!

Delicious! Best gingersnap recipe I have ever made. I accidentally burnt the first batch, but the second batch worked out perfectly.

I have made this recipe several times. Ginger preserves are often hard to come by. Finely chopped ginger root works as a good substitute or just up the ground ginger by a teaspoon or so.
Fifteen minutes at 375'F gives me a cookie that is crisp around the edges and soft in the middle.

These were awesome! I made them quite small, like the ones that you get in the store. They turned out perfect. They were just a bit crunchy, with the right amount of spice.

i have finshed making them and want to make following comments: 1) I suggest 4 to 5 tbsps. of ground ginger + 1 tsp ground nutmeg + 2 tsps ground cloves + 1 tbsp cinnamon. 2) recommend 3/4 cup sugar in the recipe and then use 1/4 cup sugar to roll the biscuits in before laying in the tray with 2" space. 3) use a small glass to press the biscuits quite flat then bake, this helps to make them crispy.For GInger fans i suggest the addition of some fresh ginger-juice made by grating fresh ginger and then straining the juice. Alternatively add finely chopped ginger preserve as well as the ginger powder.

Very good recipe! I realized I only had 1/4 C. shortening, so I substitited 1 stick of butter and 1/4 C. shortening and they turned 
out fantastic! 10 minutes on a Silpat and they were perfectly browned.
Gonna serve these with some Pumpkin Ice Cream for Thanksgiving...yum.
