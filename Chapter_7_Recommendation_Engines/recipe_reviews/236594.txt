This was very nice.  I did not have any thawed bacon but had the rest of the ingredients with the exception of Granny Smith apple (I used a Jazz variety).  My chicken needed more flavor, so salt and pepper were very necessary!  Thanks for a quick and easy dinner tonight, GRANDMADEB!

This is becoming standard Sunday lunch  in addition to our family tuna fish salad. I've made it once without the bacon because I didn't have any on hand and once without bacon and blue cheese, substituting goat cheese. The family really enjoys it and I find it a savory alternative to the sweeter chicken and apple/grape salads.

I omitted the blue cheese because I did not have it on hand.  I also used a whole apple rather than 1/4 cup.  It was a very interesting mix of ingredients.  I will definitely make it again.
