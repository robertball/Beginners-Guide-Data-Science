Excellent recipe - the boyfriend keeps requesting them! A unique cookie with a nice, chewy/cakey texture that I really liked. After reading other reviews, I skipped the glaze, and they tasted just fine - I think the glaze would have been over-the-top. For those whose cookies fell apart, it might have been due to having too much liquid. Squeeze the juice out of the grated apple before adding it. You can actually reserve the juice and use it as part of the apple juice requirement. Using two apples, I get enough juice to not need any additional juice at all. Also, last time I made these, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and didn't miss it at all.  I think next time I will also reduce the butterscotch chips to 1 cup.

Absolutely Delicious! I took the advice of others and used the juice from my apples but the dough still looked a bit runny, so I put about a cup of oatmeal in the food processor to make it a fine flour and added that. I also used the processor to break about a third of the butterscotch chips into bits. The cookies came out with perfect texture and a wonderful flavor. Even the after taste is awesome. I just want to eat one after the other! Highly Recommended!

my husband is a cookie guy and he voted these the best i've ever made, which is a huge compliment! i followed everyone's advice to nix the frosting, add more apples (and no juice) and decrease the butterscotch chips to 1 cup and they were so moist and chewy that they just fall apart & melt in your mouth! absolute perfection!

A nice cookie, but I'd prefer to taste a lot more apple, and a little less butterscotch morsel. It's extreme sweetness overpowered the more subtle apple flavor (and I didn't even bother with the glaze). But I believe with some experimenting, this recipe could lead to something great.

Great alternitave for the average cookie! Something new and delicious!  Substuting 2 egg whites for the 1 egg, reducing the butter to 8 TBSP,and adding a few tbsp of applesauce, I reduced the fat a tad to make them a little more healthy.  Well, this did NOT take away from the taste of the cookies and everyone raved about the nice fall treat! I have shared this recipe with many who have come out with equally pleasing results!

These were good, soft cookies.  It's nice to have a different flavor than normal.  I made half a recipe and still got 36 cookies easily.  I made them teaspoon-full size.  I also only made a quarter recipe of the glaze and glazed half the cookies, which worked out well because sometimes you want the extra sweetness and sometimes you don't.  Finally, I used apple juice concentrate instead of juice to make the apple flavor stronger.

I loved these. When I made them the dough seemed too runny to make into cookies and I was running out of time so I put it into a 9"x13" pan and baked it that way then frosted with the glaze. They stayed moist in the pan for over a week (I live alone and it takes me awhile to eat that much). Loved the flavor combination.

Okay, I'm not much a fan of non-chocolate and cakey dessert stuff, but I've gotta say these were really good. I took the advice of other reviewers and used only 1 cup of sugar & 1 cup of chips; I doubled the amount of apple shavings, omitted the juice and didn't glaze them. They only needed 8 minutes in my oven, and they were perfect- moist and cakey-chewy in a good way. This is a great way to use the abundant apples in the fall.

Was looking for a non-chocolate cookie.  This was perfect.  My nephew, who is very VERY picky, could not stop eating them.

This cookie is unlike any other cookie I've ever tasted!!!  If your board of the traditional chocolate chip, then this recipe is what you've been longing for. I gave some to all my close relatives and they wonderfully enjoyed every bite.  Some have asked me for the recipe, but I'm relunctant to pass it out, because I would like to keep this recepie, in a way, as our family secret.  Thanks Corwynn for this wonderfull tasty recipe.  I know this will become one of our family's favorite, if it hasn't already. : )

They cookie are nice because they're not too sweet. You can really taste the apple in the cookie, but once you put the frosting on top, there really isn't an apple flavor at all. Next time I'm going to make 50/50.

I personally thought the butterscotch was too much. Here's my variations, 3 TBS cinnnamon, NO butterscotch chips, roll dough into balls, then coat with a cinnamon sugar mix. Great Fall cookie!

This is a great cookie-just a little too sweet.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup and also used apple juice concentrate for additional flavor in both the cookies and glaze.  I also used half butter and half butter flavor Crisco.  I enjoyed the butterscotch chip/apple flavor mix.

i read over the reviews first... made the mistake of listening to the ones that said to cut down the butter scotch chips. definitely would have preferred both cups. also, omitted the juice as the 3 small/medium apples i grated were relatively juicy. overall, if these were crunchy - it would have been a 5 star recipe. instead it just tasted like individual piece of apple cake. good flavor though. simple enough. if you're looking to bake some cookies and dont want to do easy choc chip or snickerdoodle or oatmeal raisin.. this is a nice one to throw into the rotation.

Soooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was super good.  Moist and flavorful cookies.  The cookies themselves weren't too sweet, but the glaze is what put them over the top.  I made a batch with and without glaze to take them to a party, so those with less of a sweet tooth could choose between the two.  They seemed to be a hit.

I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used only 1 cup butterscotch chips and 1 cup sugar.  I also made sure to squeeze the apple juice out of the grated apple and made it part of the total apple juice measurement.  I used 1 cup total shredded apples.  I initially thought these cookies were delicious coming out of the oven warm but once they cooled, I didn't think they had a whole lot of flavor.  If you got one with a lot of chips then it was more flavorful.  I decided to add my own frosting to the tops of the cooled cookies both to pretty them up but to also add some sweetness. I combined confectioners sugar, a small amount of apple juice and cinnamon and whipped it until smooth.  I then drizzled it over the cookies in random directions. It was pretty tasty and definitely sweetened the cookies up a bit but overall, the cookies were just okay. Not sure if I would make them again.

These turned out more like little cakes than cookies and they were not very flavourful at all. Won't be trying again.

i was very excited to make these cookies, as apple cookies sounded scrumptious and butterscotch is a personal favorite. i left off the icing bc i didnt want to make more bowls dirty. im glad i did. after first taste, i have to say, these are the sweetest cookies i think i have ever had. good, but maybe i little too sweet for me.

Let me start off with saying that I am almost 4 months pregnant.  I am so picky right now that I pretty much have to go to the sotre to buy my meals on the spot because nothing ever sounds good that i have in the house.  Anyhow, my fiance loves oatmeal cookies, so I looked up a recipe on this site and made some since I couldn't find my usual recipe (they weren't very good, btw).  Anyhow, after flipping through a lot of cookie recipes I stumbled across this one, but had to bookmark it for later since my mission was oatmeal cookies.  I came back to it a couple days later, after my fiance with his sympathy cravings (HAH!) ate all the others.  I am so happy I made these! Even though my fiance ended up eating most of them, when I did get a chance to sit down and eat one it really hit the spot.. and that's a lot coming from my picky self.  I wasn't so sure about the glaze after reading other reviews and ended up halving the glaze recipe and just drizzling a little over the cookies.  I liked this recipe so much, I even whipped out my camera and took a picture.  (how rediculous is it that I squeeled when i saw my pic had been posted for the recipe?  ..Silly hormones..)  I think next time will add extra apple and maybe use raisans.

Good cookies. A bit different, as other reviewers have said. It's a big recipe too - expect about 40-50 normal sized cookies.

A few additions and corrections - yes, use less brown sugar (1 cup). I also suggest less butterscotch chips in the recipe (1 cup). I upped the apple (to 1 cup), and cut the apple juice in half (1/3 cup).

Excellent cookies.  I am an avid baker and so I naturally made a few adjustments.  I've seen a lot of complaints about not being able to taste the apple and/or too much liquid.  Instead of grating the apples, I decided to dice them.  It left more of the liquid in the apple and gave you a taste and texture of baked apple in every bite.  I also left out the walnuts (personal preference) and drizzled the icing on instead of spreading.  Delicious!!!!!!

This is a good cookie. However, the chunks of apple remain gooey even after cooking, which means this cookie won't keep long before getting...oozey. (Not sure that's a word...) You will be tempted to add more flour to the dough--it isn't necessary to do so. I resisted the urge to add oats or more flour to the dough, and it wound up working out fine. All in all, I'd probably use my apples in other desserts in the future, but I'm glad I tried these :)

I've made these twice, and they are always a hit!  The second time I made them into cookie bars (somewhat like a blondie).  They are definitely better with LOTS of apple shavings.

I went a little overboard with the apples (and omitted the nuts, due to personal preference), but even though these came out a bit more cake-like than cookie-ish, they are delicious! I also somehow managed to get 50 cookies out of a recipe that was supposed to make 18, most likely due to the over-apple-ing. All in all, a yummy and pretty easy recipe!

I've made these twice now & did a little change.  I used apples from our tree and doubled the amount to 1 1/2 cups.  I didn't use any apple juice at all as with the extra apples there was plenty of moisture.  I also cut the sugar back to 1 cup & added a bit of nutmeg. These are amazing cookies.  Took them to work & they were a hit.  Thanks!

I really had my hopes up for this recipe.  This recipe took so much time to prepare for.  The cookies turned out "cakey" and I like them to turn out more crunchy.  However, my husband took them to work and they scarfed them down so I guess they weren't too bad (but not what I expected).

The cookies were enjoyed by everyone but next time  I’d cut the butterscotch chips in half. The cookies were a little too sweet but overall, they were great!!

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I decided I really like the apple butterscotch combination, but WOW sweet even without the glaze.  Second time I cut back on the sugar, but didn't have a juicy enough apple to get the right consistency for the batter so I had to play with it.  Overall not the prettiest cookie, but a great flavor combination altough fussy with inconsistent results

Although It seems most of the reviewers had skipped the glaze I did use it. With the first pan of cookies it was too thick, like icing. I thinned it and then it was too runny, finally for the 3rd pan I was pleased. The cookies were good but quite crumbly.

These are amazingly good.  I made them to the recipe expect for one thing, I left out the glaze.  They are just fine without the glaze and the glaze would probably be too much IMO.  I did have to chill the batter before using.  Without chilling it it was impossible to deal with.  My only problem with it is the ingredients call for 2 tablespoons of butter for the glaze, and 10 tablespoons of butter for the batter, but yet the instructions only say half a cup...which is 8 tablespoons.  So where's the other 2 tablespoons of butter go?  For that reason I docked the recipe 1 star.  Otherwise I would've given it 5.

I accidentally left out the walnuts. I followed what most of the reviewers said, to cut down the butterscotch to one cup and increase the grated apple while omitting the apple juice. I also did not bother with frosting, they were sweet enough as is.
My son loves these moist cake-y cookies, but I had a bit of trouble with them spreading and not coming cleanly off the pan.

Just made these and they are delicious!  I'm not a big apple person, but decided to try these for my cookie pot-luck at work tomorrow-(plus my daughter had went apple picking so I had a bag).  I wanted something fall-ish.  I did alternate the cookie to 1 cup grated apple (about 2 apples),no apple juice, I also dropped the sugar to 1 cup per previous suggestions, and b/c I don't like things overly sweet I only put in about 3/4 cup of butterscotch chips that I had chopped up into smaller pieces, but I upped the walnuts to about 1 cup to help the texture.  The only other thing was I added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice & 1 tsp of cinnamon...The texture, taste, smell are superb!  It's still a little on the sweet side for me, but they are nice & crunchy & sweet.  Oh..I didn't bother with the glaze and i just dropped by rounded tsp.  This made about 39 cookies (probably 40 but I ate one in dough) Can't wait to see how they hold up tomorrow for work... This is a GREAT fall recipe!

These cookies are uniquely delicious.  It is a nice change from a chocolate touch.  I followed the recipe exactly and my cookie dough was perfect.  I would just remind you to really squeeze all of the juice out of the shredded apple shreds.  I couldn't stop eating the cookie dough.  Great recipe!

These cookies are delicious but there's very little apple flavor. It's great for butterscotch lovers! The cookies are chewy but become hard after only a day or two which isn't a big deal since they rarely make it that far.

Good Butterscotch cookie recipe.  I agree that you don't really taste the apple.  I prefer them without the "drizzle" (Of course my little helper elves used it more like an icing, so 1/2 of the cookies got it the other 1/2 did not).  The icing does dry up quickly, so we did have to reheat it. (We didn't wait till all the cookies were ready to "ice" them....couldn't wait to eat a few warm.)  We made some with and some without the nuts.  I prefer lots of nuts and added more to mine.  We gave Santa a choice and he left the kids a Christmas note saying that he preferred the ones without nuts. :)  
It does have a strong butterscotch flavor, so I would probably use less butterscotch, more nuts, and more apple next time.  I will make this again.

I was looking for a cookie that had apple in it and came across this. I wasn't sure how I would like it but it they are great. I did end up make a glaze because I didn't add the juice since my reviewers said it didn't need it. I will probably make these again.

These were good but there wasn't as much a contrast in the flavors as I had hoped. I was expecting more. They had a good flavor and were nice and soft. But I probably won't make them again.

cookie too bland the only flavor comes from the chips and they're too sweet. This is w/o me making the topping to put on after they came out of the oven.

The were too wet I even added about a cup of oats to the dough because it was just too loose. 

Hubby will probably love them, he's never met a cookie he doesn't like but I won't be making them again.

Yes, grating up an apple is a pain in the rear but oh so worth it.  I've made these twice and the second time I added in some minced up dried apple and it gave another layer of texture to the cookies that went over quite well.

All I can say is....DELICIOUS! Used approximately 1 cup grated(2 large) Granny Smith apples---which I think is the key to not have the cookies be too sweet---no extra juice from a bottle or concentrate necessary (except a few TBS to make the glaze), and no nuts and everything came out perfect! Better than I expected.

This was a diverse and amazing cookie. I love the idea and the taste! I added some nutmeg, I didnt have apple juice so I used cherry juice and I forgot to add the egg (I hate that when that happens) and it still came out amazing!

These were very good!  A little too sweet for my taste, and I didn't even use the glaze, so next time I'd use less butterscotch chips and more apple.  Everyone I made them for loved them though.

My cookies fell apart.  I liked the taste, as did my family, but they literally turned to crumbs after cooling.  I think I would try this again as a bar cookie -- maybe it would do better in a pan.

I used only 1 cup of brown sugar and one cup of butterscotch chips. They turned out pretty good but still a tad on the sweet side. There was definetly no need for the glaze.

This was a really good cookie with a nice texture. I was a little worried because the dough seemed a little thin, but the cookies came out soft and cakey on the inside with crispy edges.  Kids sampled them before they were cool enough to glaze, and loved them just like that, so I didn't do the glaze.

:) Tasty (and rather unusual) combination of flavours! The first time I made them I thought they were a bit too sweet so the second time I just omitted the glaze. My friends loved them both ways.
