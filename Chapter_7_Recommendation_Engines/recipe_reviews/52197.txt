I followed the recipe as written and we thought that it was a really nice cold coffee drink (especially on a hot afternoon when caffeine is needed/wanted).  For the banana:  I believe it is used more for a sweetener and a thickener then it is for flavour because you canâ€™t really taste it.  ( I used one over ripe banana. ) I also used cold refrigerated leftover coffee. We all thought this drink had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.  The coffee, hot chocolate & banana combined  together very well to please our tastes.  THX.

Not bad, but not really what I'd call a 'shake.' I kept all measurements the same except that I used 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of milk. It tasted pretty good and had a nice 'foaminess' on top...the banana wasn't too strong, so don't worry about that. Like I said, this really wasn't a shake in consistency...I'm thinking that it would actually taste best if you simply blend all ingredients (expect the ice) then pour the mixture of crushed ice.

The banana I used was probably too ripe because the banana taste was way too strong. I even used a 1.25oz pouch of cocoa mix and added another tablespoon Sugar. It was still alright, but next time I'll either half or eliminate the banana.

It was okay.  Not very cold, even though I used extra ice cubes.  I make my own Frapu... type thing and it's a lot better.  Banana and coffee go GREAT together, though.  I use it my frozen version.

This recipe was just okay.

I scaled this down to a one person serving. I omitted the banana, as I don't like banana-flavored coffee and I added a concentrated shot of coffee. I also subbed almond extract for the vanilla. 

I'm not big on the dry hot cocoa mix added to the coffee. I'd rather just stick to using chocolate syrup. Other than that, it was okay. Not real sure I'd make it again. I was just looking for a quick pick-me-up recipe.

A great summer cool down!  I used vanilla frozen yougert instead of ice cubes to thicken it up a little the second time I made it, and loved it.  Either way, its a great shake.

I ironically made a similar drink like this today. I'm diabetic so I used 2-3 packets of Equal. I also omitted the banana. Was very tasty.

I couldn't really taste the coffee or the banana in this. It was kind of more like a semi-bland chocolate drink. I did scale the recipe down to two servings with the calculate button. For the hot cocoa I used a spoonful of Ovaltine. I used a frozen banana, because I keep them in the freezer for smoothies. I also subbed the sugar for a packet of Truvia for the 2 servings I made. I did like that it was only 80 calories. Plus, using the ovaltine it added in vitamins and it was icy cold. I did never think to put coffee and banana together so that was interesting.

Pretty good, but more like an "iced mocha" as opposed to "milkshake". I filled a glass with ice & poured it over the ice and it was very tasty.

It was pretty great! But I had to add two scoops of Nesquik to it to give it some more flavor. Other than that I would make it again.

Made this yesterday morning for my husband and I. It didn't have much coffee flavor, maybe I need to make the coffee much stronger.  Overall it was good, but not as great as I had expected.  Still a nice change in the rotation of breakfast shakes we sometimes have.

Make this even lower calorie by using unsweetened vanilla almond milk in place of skim (only 40 cal per cup), 2T of PB2 (powdered chocolate peanut butter, low cal and delicious!), and splenda in place of the sugar.  I use a frozen banana (cut in half).  Try it.  You will be pleasantly surprised!!
