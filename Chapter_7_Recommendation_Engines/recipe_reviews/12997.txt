Tried a healthier version of this soup (down from 60 grams of fat per serv. to 8!!) Cut out the butter completely (we didn't even miss it amazingly) used 6 cups of 2% milk, reduced fat sharp cheddar, reduced fat sour cream.  Reserved a 1/4 cup each of sour cream and cheese plus all of the bacon crumbles & used 1tbsp each to top each serving. DELICIOUS - never would have thought it healthy!  I also used about 6 potatos and coursley mashed them as opposed to cubed. YUM!

I read every review only because I believe that even experienced cooks can always learn something. Some people complained that the soup was bland. At first taste, while it was still in the pot, I agreed. It tasted like soupy mashed potatoes. I added garlic and onion powder, parsley and cayenne pepper for some zip. When I initially viewed the recipe I felt that there was way too much butter/flour. I cut both back by half, not only to cut down on the fat, but because other reviewers stated that the soup was too thick. You definitely don't need all that roux to make this soup thick. If you do want it thicker, just add more potato, if you want it thinner, add more milk or chicken broth. This is the kind of recipe that you can put in whatever spices, herbs or meats that suit your own taste. You really can't ruin it. Overall, it was very good.

I make this soup all the time and my family loves it. To thin it down some I use 3 cups of milk and add chicken broth to our preferred thickness. The chicken broth adds even more flavor too!!!

Fantastic!! Better than any potato soup I've had in a restaurant and definitely my fav soup ever!! I have done a bit of tweaking to suit my own tastes.... sub 2 cups chicken stock for 2 of the cups of milk, instead of green onions I add a finely chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves garlic that I've lightly browned in the bacon grease. I mash the potatoes a little bit with fork as well, cut the sour cream down a bit, save about half of the cheese and all of the crumbled bacon to top the soup with. It's even more flavorful and thick the next day.  If it gets too thick I just add a little milk when reheating.

This was great meal.  My husband and I loved it.  But we did something a little diffrent.  It did not have much flavor.  So we got a ranch packet out.  The one that you make the ranch dressing with and just added some to the soup and it turned out great.  We did nto add all of it just enough for taste.  Just thought this might help.

This recipe does have potential, I wish I could omit the star rating, but that feature no longer works.  I tried this recipe exactly, but it was bland and had a thick flour taste.  My hubby said it reminded him of the paste from when he was in grade school.  If this sits for any length of time it becomes similiar to mashed potatos..  For all of you who said it was "bland" or "milky", try omitting 3 cups of milk and instead, cook half of your potatos in 3 cups of chicken broth.  Puree those, but bake the other half of the taters and cut them in small cubes.  Add you milk to the tater puree and heat to a simmer, you should not need the roux, potatos are a natural thickener.  I would recommend adding some salt, garlic powder and maybe even some chopped onion to the broth before you cook the potatoes, for added flavor.  Continue with the recipe ingreadiens and enjoy.

I love this recipe!  Can I give it more than five stars?  I have made it several times now and it is a favorite at our house making a meal in itself.  I will throw in about half of the potatoe skins for a little extra texture.  The really nice thing about this soup is you can adjust it to taste.  I have added everything from the onion, sour cream and bacon they suggest to steak and chives.  It is also really easy and quick unlike my potato soup recipe which I have to cook for several hours and usually forget about scorching the milk.

VERY good soup.  I recommend being careful how much flour you put in, though.  I put too much in.  The thickness comes at the final stages, so don't worry if it seems thin.  Also, I like it with more potato and bacon in it like a chowder.  I will definately be making this during the winter.

Thick and creamy - and very easy to make! This recipe is a 'keeper'. I lightened it up by using 1% milk and fat-free sour cream.

Made this for use in bread bowls and was perfect!  Comfort food all the way.  I did add a couple cubes of chicken boullion and 2 cloves minced garlic for flavor.  Also, just a little FYI when making a potato soup....if you salt the soup at the END as opposed to during cooking, the salt flavor will be stronger.  Potatoes naturally soak up salt, so you can salt and salt while it's cooking and you'll always come out with a bland soup. Try it, I promise it will be better!

I thought this recipe was great.  It was a little on the thick side, so I added more milk.  To cut down on the fat I used 2% milk, low fat sour cream, 2% cheese, and left the bacon out. I probably added more salt and pepper than the recipe calls for too.

Excellent and easy Baked Potato soup! One of the best I have tried. I read reviews and did a little tweaking of my own. For more flavor I sauteed 1 yellow onion in the butter and added bacon grease drippings too. I also threw in some minced fresh garlic about 3 cloves and sauteed all that together. Then I added the recommended flour. Not lower in fat but definitely adds the flavor. I did switch the 7 C. Milk, to 4 cups organic chicken broth and 3 cups milk. I also only used 1 cup of sharp cheddar and saved the rest to serve on top. The only other tweak I did was to puree half the soup before adding the bacon, sour cream and cheese. It give is a real nice texture, not too chunky and not too smooth. Better that your Houston's Restaurant too! Will definitely add this one to the recipe box!

when I make this soup, I use chicken broth instead of the milk and stir in instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it.  It's easy, it adds to the potato flavor and it doesn't add the fat of milk or cream....I also don't bother with the roux.  I just use a small amount of butter to soften the onion.

I made this yesterday and it was a HUGE hit! It tastes even better than the soup at my favorite restaurant. My husband asked me to make it again tomorrow. The only thing I did differently was I used 6 potatoes instead of 4. Very filling..and very tasty. I highly recommend.
ETA: A few more things I do differently: I use butter instead of margarine. I salted (needed quite a bit of salt) and peppered the potatoes before adding them to the soup. Once I add the potatoes to the mix I use my masher and give them a few rough mashes to thicken it up. Instead of cooking bacon I buy the already cooked kind and heat it up in the microwave - tastes the same. As for the cheese I use a bag of mild cheddar which is roughly 2 cups instead of the 1 1/4 cup the recipe calls for. This is my husband's favorite!

Really Good Soup.  I garnished with shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon and green onions. It reminded me of the soup I get at Bennigan's.  I microwaved the potatoes and used already prepared bacon to cut down on cooking time.  It turned out terrific.

This is the second time I have reviewed/rated this recipe because it is wonderful! I made some slight modifications to last night's batch, and think I have truly perfected it to suit my family's tastes. I used only 1/4 cup of flour, and for the liquid I used 2 cups of half and half, 1 can of Campbell's Chicken Broth, and four cups of milk. Yummy!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  It is extremely rich and satisfying.  I did add extra salt, pepper and cheese.  I also added a bit of sugar because I like most everything on the sweet side.  It was delicious!

My family loved this dish. They said it was the best potato soup they'd ever had. Everything was excellent, but I'd suggest using light/fat-free ingredients -- this recipe has so many calories and enough fat to last you a week. All in all, aside from the calories and fat, it's an amazing recipe.

Delicious! I decreased the butter and flour to 1/2 cup each, substituted 1 can of chicken broth for 2 cups of milk, and added a dash of cayenne pepper. I'll definately be making this one again!

I scaled the recipe down to 3 & still had lots of leftovers. I cut the sour cream in half & I still thought it was a bit much but then again I don't add sour cream to my baked potatoes. ;o)I used leftover potatoes from a roast & I used half chicken broth & half milk (next time I will decrease the ratio of broth). I also only used half the called for amount of butter & flour & I added sauteed garlic & chopped onion. Thsi did taste just like a baked potato & looked very tasty garnished w/ bacon bits, chopped chives & cheese...thanks Sherry Haupt!

Excellent soup.  I sauteed an onion and some garlic in the pot first.  I removed it and then made the rue as the recipie states.  I added the onion back when the potatoes went in.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I wanted to make it a little healthier, so I used oven broiled turkey bacon, light margarine, skim milk, fat free cheese, and fat free sour cream.  I don't think it changed the taste at all.  It was thick and creamy and wonderful.  I did add a little more flour to the last cup of milk to thicken it a little more, just in case it was thinner because of the skim milk.  No one would ever guess it was healthier.  Will definately make it again!

I saved some of the bacon grease from frying the bacon and sauteed some additional chopped fresh green onion and garlic before adding the butter and flour. Also, when I baked my potatoes, I drizzled them with EVOO and sprinkled them with steakhouse seasoning salt before baking. Because I did that, I cut back the salt I added to the soup. This soup is the perfect thickness but it really does need a little more seasoning aside from salt/pepper and the steakhouse seasoning salt I used on the potatoes.

Restaurant quality in my book....this was amazing! I made a few mini changes. I only used half butter /flour roux mixture which was plenty.  I also used 4c fat free/low sodium chicken broth and 4c skim milk. I used low fat sour cream and used a whole lb of bacon and 6 large russets. So rich, thick and comforting.  Even with the lower fat ingredients and skim milk this soup thickened perfectly with just 1/2 the roux called for in this recipe.  Served with a crusty whole wheat bread. Thanks!

I think that this might be the best soup that I have ever had!! It is now my favorite. I only made a few changes to the recipe based on our personal eating habits and preferences. I used real butter since we don't eat margarine and almond milk because that is what we drink. I also left the peeling on the potatoes since that's where the nutrition is. I'm a vegetarian so the bacon was added to the meat eaters bowls separately. Huge hit with everyone in the house. Will be a regular in our house from now on.

I really can't figure out why there are bad reviews to this recipe.  I have made a couple of potato soups from the website and this one by far is the best.  One tip, it just says to put in baked potatoes.  I took that as potatoes that I would use to make "baked potatoes" with.  I then realized that you should cook the potatoes first :).  I highly recommend this recipe.

This soup was awesome, I followed the suggestion of cutting the milk in half and used chicken stock for the other half.  I also bought bacon from the deli(not the pre-packaged) and had them cut it in thick slices.  The last thing I did was to add frozen western corn.

This is third time making this and an updated review... This was yummy! I scaled mine to 3 servings. I made mine Gluten Free by skipping the roux, which eliminated the butter. So I started with 2 cups of milk, then added the potatoes and green onions, seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Next I mixed 1.5 cups of milk with 3 tsp of corn starch and added that to the soup. Turned it up to come to a boil, stirring constantly, then lowered the temp and followed the remained of the recipe. Topped with additional chives, cheese, and bacon and it was yummy! Hubby loved it!

Excellent soup!!  Made this for our neighbors and they had three bowls.  I used 2% milk and light sour cream and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  This will be a cold weather staple in our home.

This recipe was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it!  I agree with other reviews that it is better when it sits overnight.  I made this on a Friday evening for a Saturday dinner.  Very tasty!

I LOVE potato soup and this one is a winner!

I made it as written, but with two small changes. FIrst, margarine? PUH-LEASE! Butter, baby. The second was unintentional but I think it made an improvement based on some of the negative reviews.  Some are mentioning that it came out mushy. Well, I cut up the potatoes and threw them in there without cooking them first. I like my potato soup to be more like chowder - thick and chunky - and that seemed to do the trick.

I am terrible at making gravies and roux, but take your time and put only a bit of flour in at a time. Then, be sure to add the first 2 cups of milk slowly, stirring it in well as you go. You can then add the rest of the milk and you'll get a nice base for the soup.

Two suggestions. First, it was a little thicker than I would like it actually, so I might thin it with a little chicken broth next time. It was also a bit more peppery than I like it - and I like pepper. I might cut it down by half and let people add it to their taste. I will likely add a bit of yellow onion next time. Not a lot, just enough to give it a smidge of onion flavor before adding the green onions at serving time.

Overall - excellent and EASY even for the roux challenged like myself. I will be making this one often for sure!

I have been making this for yrs now and like to come back to read reviews and suggestions. As far as the soup being too thick it depends on the base/roux, I know friends that have made it and thicken the roux too much...for me using 1% milk did not matter. I use butter and not margarine. I made this for a soup pot luck at work and doubled the recipe to serve 12 hungry RN's and doctors. I heard comments like I was personally responsible for clogging arteries to OMG this is better than Corner Bakery's "Loaded Potato" soup. It was gone before our 8 hr shift was over. Several RN's have made it since and all just rave about it...all the credit goes to website and Sherry.

I substitued bacon with real bacon bits. Chopped up the potatoes and microwaved them for 3-5 minutes before i added them to the soup. The first time I made it the pototes didn't cook well enough in the soup alone. VERY GOOD would make it again and again!

WOW! The soup was so rich, delicious and very filling. :)
Followed the reviews of others - ie: Added 2/3 packet of powdered Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, onion & garlic powder and cayenne for a kick. Added all this plus salt & pepper at the end. Found it needed quite a bit of salt.  
In addition, used 6 potatoes and the reviewes of someone else - baked 3 in the microwave and then cubed them with the skins on, peeled 3 and cubed and boiled them. 
We used 1% milk, non-fat sour cream, substitute 1 cup chicken broth for one cup of the milk and used low fat cheese. 
PS - Best of all, we got 5 servings out of this at about $2.00 per serving!

I'm not even a fan of potato soup and I loved this. I made just a few changes.  I used much less bacon than called for because I didn't have enough.  It worked out great.  The soup is so rich, you don't need that much bacon.  I also used sharp cheddar, light sour cream and a bit of garlic.  At the last few minutes I threw in a couple of cups of fresh mushrooms. It was great!  I did make some of my potatoes a bit underdone so I could have some texture in the soup.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

The BEST potato soup I've ever had! I tastes much like Panera Bread's potato soup recipe! But I think it may be better than that! Had many compliments at dinner. Even my 4 year old son said "This is the best stuff I've ever had!"

Absolutely the best potato soup I've ever made.  I did follow some the of other users suggestions.  I cooked the roux a little longer than called for and I used 4 cups of half-and-half and three cups of milk.  I also used yukon gold potatoes and didn't peel them.  I used a small sweet onion and the leafy tops of four celery stalks, both of which I sauteed in butter.  I added 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 2 tablespoons chives, 1 tablespoon parsley, and about 3 cups of cheese.  I also added a can of chicken broth during the thickening stage just because I thought it would need more liquid.  It came out extremely thick and rich, almost a chowder more than a soup, but everyone loved it.  They said it was very filling and flavorful.

This soup is WAY TOO THICK. It gets almost like a paste after sitting for just 5 minutes. You should expect to add an additional 2-3 cups of liquid and I highly suggest chicken broth to add some flavor and salt content. My husband and 3 year old didn't like it but I thought once thinned it was tasty. I'll make again but will add more liquid and salt from the get go!

Made this tonight for my inlaws. It was delicious! However, I thought it required considerably more salt (about 3 tsps). Also recommend cooking 3-4 extra slices of bacon to garnish.

This is my absolute FAVORITE potato soup.  U typically try and use 2% milk in it and reduced fat sour cream.  Still not healthy, but a wonderful treat.  Freezes well too, to pull out dinner size portions during the winter.  And I would say this makes more like 8 large servings, 6 would be overkill.

It was the best potato soup I have had in a while. Only thing I did differently was added a tablespoon of the bacon grease and then 1 cup of chicken broth for more flavor. Also added 1 teaspoon garlic salt during the simmer. I also did not cook the potatoes ahead of time. The cook time is much longer and wouldn't suggest that unless you are looking for more flavor.

so delicious! Made with a few changes. used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the 2/3 cup. Used 6 medium potatoes broken into chunks and only 6 slices of bacon. I added 4 pieces of bacon to the soup and save the remaining 2 for topping. I also reserved 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease and sauteed 4 carrots cut into 1/2 inch rounds and 2 ribs of celery cut into similar sized pieces. I added the veggies at the same time as the potatoes. Soup turned out great and I can't wait for the left overs tomorrow. will make again, most likely a double (or triple) batch.

My family loves this soup!!  I've made it several times.  I like to saute half of a chopped onion, and two stalks of chopped celery in a little butter, and then add it when I add the potatoes.  I also use one 3 ounce jar of Hormel Real Bacon Bits, which is equal to 12 slices of bacon. Why fry all of that bacon if you don't have to! I bake the potatoes in the microwave if I don't want to heat up the oven.  And, F.Y.I, 2/3 cup of butter is equal to one stick plus 2 tablespoons of butter!

Have made this many times.  First few times as written but recently Ive been changing the recipe to suit our tastes and to cut down on time.  I can make this in the crockpot, no butter or flour needed. I have also subbed the cheese for a little condensed cheese soup with great results.  This is a keeper

Use bacon drippings.  The extra flavor really enhances the soup.

This is the easiest & best potato soup I have ever made. I love onion, so I added a diced onion to melted butter before making roux. Tossed in some leftover ham. Made a great meal. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!

What I like about this recipe is that you can make it your own in so many ways.  I added broccoli to mine and some different spices that I like.  So use this recipe as a fantastic base to a soup that is just what you like.  I found the recipe to be just fine, the soup was a good consistency and personal touches make it great.

5+ Stars! This soup is delicious. My husband who won't eat ANYTHING with sour cream even loves it. I like to chop up a yellow onion (about 3/4 cup) and saute it with the butter in the beginning. Then I add a few green onions for the color in the end. I also add extra cheese. Make sure you leave plenty of time for prepping. Between the skinning of the potatoes, frying the bacon and chopping everything up, it takes a little longer than expected. It is worth it though! Also, be sure to use SHARP or even extra sharp cheese for a good zing!

This soup is 1,000 times better than O'Charley's Potato Soup (my former favorite soup)!  It is out of this world!  I am impressing my new husband so much with my culinary skills!  :-)  lol  Adding some extra potato skins really does give it extra texture and flavor.  I used fat-free sour cream, skim milk, and light margarine, and it didn't diminish the flavor in the least.  This soup was FANTASTIC!!!

This is GREAT!!!  It definately can be lightened up a bit!!!!  I used lowfat/sodium bacon and did in the microwave. I used skim milk and added an extra potato, which I mashed to help thicken the soup.  Also used lowfat cheese....YUM!!!!  Great for these cold Pennsylvania eves!!!!!

I made this soup for a very cold Florida night last night!  It was really excellent.  The only thing I did different was to not use bacon in the recipe.  I sprinkled Bacos on the top of the individual servings along with some extra cheddar and tiny bits of green onion.  I highly recommend this soup - you won't be disappointed!

This is very good.  Very close to Stuart Andersons. (West Coast)  It is on the "thick chowder side" of soup, but awesome nonetheless.  I made a few changes.  Cheated and used Bacon Bits, let them simmer in the milk broth while I cut the potatoes, would suggest letting baked potatoes cool all the way before cutting so they stay cubed - Substituted Chopped Onions for green (time saver) I have children. Shortcuts are my life! Tastes great.

My husband always Baked Potato Soup when it is on the menu anywhere so today when he had teeth pulled and I needed soup I decided to look for a good Baked Potato soup recipe.  HE JUST LOVED IT.  Since we are both on cholestoral medication I tried to keep it to a safe level by using a few cups of broth to replace the milk and cut the butter and flour by about half, it still was creamy and luscious.  I wish I dared try the recipe full strength.

Thanks Sherry

This soup is SO GOOD and relatively easy to make. It took a long time for me to prepare because I was so paranoid about scorching the bottom that I used lower heat to bring to a boil. Like another reviewer I used up some whipping cream and half-and-half that I had and then used milk for the remaining amount, it turned out great. Very creamy! I did find that I needed to add additional salt and pepper to suit our tastes, I also added paprika and in the future I may use garlic salt/powder. When I served the soup I garnished with shredded cheddar cheese. This recipe will definately be added to our family favorites.

When I initially made this recipe, I found it really thick and a bit bland.... so I tweaked it abit, added some finely chopped fresh mushrooms, for their flavour as well as their water content.  I also added a bit of water and some spices and then stuck a potato masher in the pot and mashed up some of the cubed potato.  I let it sit overnight and the next day, when all the flavours had come together, it was delicious!  I will definitely make again!

I made a few changes worth trying.  First, I used diced baked potatoes (peel after baking).  I sauted the onions and celery in the butter with some minced garlic.  Then, I added about 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and the potatoes.  I mashed the potatoes slightly and added the half and half.  I cooked and stirred it until it started to thicken and then added the soup.  The seasonings always have to be adjusted in a recipe like this, and I added garlic salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon crystals to make it just right.  It was simply wonderful, and my family loved it!  It was creamy and cheesey to the max!

This recipe was delicious, I did make a few changes, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour, I also used 3 cups of chicken broth which gave it more flavor and used only 4 cups of milk.  My family loved it.  I used 4 baked potatoes per the recipe but I think it needed a few more.  Next time I will use 6 potatoes, overall this recipe was very tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I tweeked this recipe with what I had and it turned out GREAT... I only used 1/3 c of flower and it was plenty thick. I used two 14 oz cans of chicken broth and 3 c of 2% milk. I chopped up a small yellow onion and 4 cloves of garlic and sauteed them in the bacon grease and added. I did not have cheddar cheese so I used 14 slices of American and 1/3 of a small container of chive and onion cream cheese (it gives amazing flavor) and then added salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and a little paprika. I had 5 baked potatoes (I rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled salt, oregano and basil on them before baking). I LEFT THE SKIN ON and cubed 3 and smashed up two. This makes it a good consistency while leaving some hearty chunks.  Hope this helps!

Well the end product came out good but I had a few issues....I did not know (as it did not state) whether or not you needed to COOK the potatoes before or not.  It said large baked potatoes, I figured that means those big russett types, it didn't say you should actually bake the potato, so I have no idea what the actual recipe called for.  I actually used a 3 pound bag of organic yellow potatoes, peeled, chopped (and I had no idea, so threw them in raw), so this whole recipe took a while to cook through.  I used butter (margarine is toxic to your system, and I can't stand the taste, butter all the way).  For the milk, I used whole milk.  I didn't use green onions, I took one regular onion chopped, and a clove of garlic, browned in some butter in a pan then threw it in the pot.  The rest of the recipe I followed, it came out SO tasty.  Everyone loved it.  I made this in my Le Creuset dutch oven.  I also saved a few slices of super crispy bacon for the top, crushed once I put the soup in a bread bowl.

This soup is great and so easy! Instead of baked potatoes, I used 6 russet potatoes and cubed and boiled them. I also used a package of Oscar Meyer real bacon bits instead of frying bacon, it was easier and less messy. Delicious!

I've made this a dozen times already, don't know why I haven't rated it before.  Love, love, LOVE this soup!  I always make a double batch, the leftovers are so good.  Just thin it out with some milk or chicken broth.  I do use a combo of fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 and 1% milk, totaling 6 cups.  Then I add 2 cans of chicken broth, because I'm making a huge batch here!  I also cook the green onions in the butter before I add the flour.  It's so good and comforting!  Thank you so much!

This was awesome! We followed some advice from the reviews and used the bacon grease to saute the white onions (which we used instead of green), and a teaspoon of minced garlic. We added some broccoli with the rest of the goodies and 2 cups of chicken broth when we added the milk. This was a keeper, super delicious!

Loved this recipe.  Of course I made a few tweaks like everyone else, I like to make it creamy, but not too thick, so I took about half the potatoes and blended them with some milk and added it in.  It turned out terrific.

Very good soup! This was really thick and ultra creamy "sauce". I used an extra potato than called for. I used pre cooked bacon and just heated it til crispy in the microwave. Easy and really fast too! Thanks.

This soup is awesome!!!  Very thick and yummy!  Good for a cold fall day.  The only thing that I changed was 4 cups milk and 3 cups of chicken broth.  If you like thick soups than this is the one for you.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The soup tasted better than the restaurant baked potato soups that I have tried.  My family LOVED it, too!  It is creamy, velvety and soothing.  A great comfort food to have during the cold weather.

This was a very simple and delicious soup.  The only change I made was substituting 4 cups of the milk with chicken broth since we didn't have enough milk.

This soup has really become a household favorite, however, if made according to thee recipe it is extremely bland. I add about a half cup of chicken broth and and a half table spoon of cayenne pepper for a kick.  I add more potatoes to make the soup thicker I also use more bacon for a "bacon potato soup" rather than a baked potato soup.

Came out very thick and was bland. Could have used a little more cheese and I had to add garlic and onion powder to give it a little more flavor.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, so it is not really this recipe anymore, but I did use it as the base.  I included the bacon fat with the butter, and then added about 1 cup of chopped celery and then cooked that until tender.  I also heated the milk.  I added 5 cups of warm milk, and then 2 cups of chicken broth.  Make sure to cook the mixture a while after adding the milk, it will take the starchy taste out.  All in all, it was a good recipe, but you can add much more flavor with the bacon fat and celery.  With these additions, I would say it is very similar to Outback Steakhouse potato soup recipe.  Very good!

We added a packet of powdered Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and would probably add two next time. In addition, we used 6 potatoes. We baked three in the microwave and then cubed them with the skins on. We peeled three and cubed and boiled them. The boiled cubes retained a bit more of their shape while the baked ones mixed into the soup more. I would suggest getting some extra sour cream for garnish (we neglected to think of this).

It's pretty high in fat \but there's plenty you could do to the recipe if that stuff matters to you. Use 1% milk, low fat sour cream, substitute chicken broth for half the milk, use low fat cheese, use turkey bacon, etc.

I made the recipe for 2 servings. (My husband doesn't like mashed potatoes.) I used 5 Fingerling potatoes, low fat sour cream, 1% milk, and non hydrogenated margarine. I also took advice from another review and added garlic powder. I didn't have any bacon, so I used bacon bits. I didn't cook the potatoes ahead of time. Instead I followed the directions without cooking them. I cut the potatoes in half then cut them in 1/2 inch pieces. They softened, but not enough to break up and become mashed. I also added more sour cream, and used Cougar Gold Cheese, it's a very sharp cheese you can buy online. The flavor was great! I gave this recipe 4 stars because without adding your own flavoring, it's bland.

Really the best potato soup I've had- homemade, restaurant, you name it.  My 7-year-old daughter even said it was better than my mother-in-law's!

The soup can be thick, especially when warming up leftovers, but as other reviewers said it's easy to correct if you prefer it slightly thinner.

This is a very easy and FORGIVING recipe.  I messed up the roux and got it too thick before putting in the milk (like Play-Doh!) But with a little whisking, gentle heat, and patience, it smoothed out perfectly.

I prefer a real thick potato soup. So my small twist on the recipe is once I put the potatoes in I grabbed a masher and went after it until the potatoes were broken up smaller.  This really thickened it up.

NOTE that the soup *will* thicken as it cooks and especially after you remove it from the heat. So don't worry if it seems thin.

OMG(osh)! Great recipe!!! I know this because my 16 y/o son and his associates (accomplices) ate my entire test batch, then had me make more. I did reserve about 1/3 of the cheese and bacon to add to the top while serving, and added just a bit more salt to taste, but otherwise made this to spec. It was great! Thanks for the recipe.

I love potato soup, and this recipie is very similar to the one I already had for this amazing comfort dish- with the exception that mine used 6 cups 2% milk. 

I also put in thinly sliced kielbasa sausage (that I have already par cooked for about 3 minutes in boiling water) and  a dash of nutmeg. It is wonderful!!!

I love this recipe!  It is perfect the way it is written.  I do add a little ham base to give it a little smokey flavor.  Another tip is to add a few dashes of tabasco.  Not enough to give it any heat but brings out the flavors.

Great recipe.  I half this and make it regularly for our small family.  I think I sneak extra cheese in.  I recommend leaving the bacon aside (use on top when serving) so that it doesn't get soft.  I use some of the reserved bacon grease for the roux giving the soup the taste of bacon.

This soup was very easy and very good!  I made some modifications.  i used red potatoes b/c I prefer them.  I also cubed several of the potatoes, but i took two small potatoes and 1 C milk and mashed in a food processor.  It gave the soup a thicker, heartier texture.  Like others, I used skim milk, reduced the butter, and used light sour cream and cheese.  You couldn't tell at all!  However, I also tried substituting turkey bacon and it wasn't the same.  It wasn't nearly as crispy and tasted more like I had included pieces of ham.  Next time I'll use real bacon!  Overall the soup was very good!  I'll definitely make again.

This is a really great "base" recipe.  As long as you got the roux and the potato part down, you can pretty much add or change anything you want!  I tend to puree some of the soup and add it back in to make it a little thicker.  This is the best potato soup recipe that I have found, hands down!

Fantastic!  Everything about this recipe is right on.  I "baked" my potatoes in the microwave and peeled and chopped them while still warm and I used butter instead of margarine, avoiding transfats.  We like it just the way it is, thick and creamy!  If your preference is for a thinner soup, add more milk.  It is AWESOME!  We will be having it regularly.

I adjusted the recipe for a vegetarian meal.  I made it without the bacon.  If you do that, you'll need more salt.

Bravo! I have been making Baked Potato soup for years (well trying). It always turns out okay, but this recipe was truly over the top! I love thick creamy soups, and this was just like the baked potato soup you would get in an Irish pub! I used light cream instead of milk, and didn't have any left over baked pots, so I boiled some pots and that worked fine! I highly recommend this recipe!

As written it would have been very bland but here's what I did differently.
1)I cut back on the roux like many others but found myself adding cornstarch and water to make up the difference.  Next time I'll leave the roux as is.
2)I used almost 2 pounds of small red potatoes instead of the 4 large ones.  I  also boiled them because I was in a hurry.
3) I used half chicken stock and half milk.  7 cups just seemed like a lot of milk.
4) I used much more salt and pepper than called for.  I also added cayenne pepper, basil, onions, and  4 garlic cloves for flavour.
5) I used a little velveeta and chedder mixed.
6) I left the potatoes cubed and used my hand blender to mash the potatoes after the soup was  cooked.  This way I got the consistency I wanted.
7) I added the sour cream last and only combined it.  This way I got maximum flavour from the sour cream.
8) I skipped the bacon because I don't like it.  Used white onion instead of green.
9) Lastly, I cooked the roux for a little bit.  Those who find their soup is a little "floury" it's because the flour didn't get a chance to cook.  Give the roux a couple of minutes  on the  stove over a low heat to cook the flour taste out.  It'll make a difference.
Hope that helps!  Great soup!!!

This soup is AWESOME!  We doubled the recipe, boiled the potatoes and as suggested used a bit less sour cream than called for.  Everyone loved this creamy but hearty soup.  Winter is coming and without a doubt we will be making this again.

Excellent!  Best potato soup recipe ever!  I make it at least once a week or so in the winter time. My famil loves it!  To lower the fat content I use reduced fat sour cream, fat free milk and reduced fat cheese and you can't even tell the difference!  It's excellent.  Thank you for such a delicious soup  =)

SO SO SO SO GOOD!!!!!  If I could give it 6 stars I would!  Be sure to get regular bacon, not maple flavored.  I did this the 1st time and it gave the soup a wierd taste.  Also, you HAVE to add the cheese to get the full flavor.  The 2nd time I made it as the recipe states, and it was FABULOUS!!!

Thought I followed the recipe to the "T", but was disappointed with the flavor.  Although other family members said they liked it, I thought the predominant taste was of flour instead of potatoes.  Even after dressing it with bacon, cheese & spring onions, it was still pretty bland.  Wouldn't take the time to make again.

I can only come up with one word...WOW!!! Amazing soup! I confess it's a little bit bland out of the pot, but garnish it with some shredded cheese, crumbled bacon, and green onions before serving and you'll be wow-ing too!! It's even better the day after it's made!!

I took this to a church fundraiser and it was gone immediately.  Do not try to cook large volumes at one time, however, as it is very easy to scorch the milk bisque.

This soup was THE BEST potato soup I've ever had! My family loved it, I loved it, I could go on and on! I tried using regular onions one time and it just wasn't the same! The green onions are definately a must! Bacon, cheese, and green onions atop makes this dish absolutely dreamy!

You have created the ultimate comfort soup, it is
just delicious. Sherry, thanks so much for your
wonderful creation. 
For those of us who are trying to watch our family's cholesterol levels it is a good idea to
substitute the cheese and sour cream with a low
fat version. I also decided to use the potatoes
as a thickener and just a bit of corn starch.
You have a winning recipe!

Fabulous soup! Very rich and creamy. I have also used chopped ham instead of the bacon, and it was just as good. Be sure to whisk the soup constantly while cooking so the mixture doesn't burn to the bottom. We love it!

The overall recipe is delicious. I would next time cut back on the flour because it is just a little to thick for me. Overall it is a great tasting soup. It is a keeper. Thanks ---John

WOW... WOW... WOW... oh did I say WOW! I loved this soup!
I'm looking for good soups for this coming winter and this one is a KEEPER!
It is a stick to your ribs type of soup that warms ya inside and out!  It SMELLS
great and TASTES even better! I like a little more cheese in mine that what it calls 
for but that is easy to add per bowl.
MAKE this soup! you will NOT be sorry!

Best potato soup recipe out there.  The thicker the better. I leave out the onion and with the price of bacon so high usually don't have any and still amazing.  I added Chuck stew pieces one night to have protein and was really good... Steak and potato soup. Can't go wrong

Really tasty recipe. I read a handful of reviews prior to making this and am surprised no one mentioned adding an acid to the recipe.  I didn't realize it until I tasted it... only the salt is working to bring the flavors through to your tastebuds. It needed some acid and something bitter to truly make the most of the ingredients. I squeezed a quarter of a lemon in there at a time until it reached my liking (ended up at 3/4 of a lemon but would have been fine at 1/2). For the bitter aspect, I added a dash of cayenne. You can't taste the cayenne, but you'll notice more flavors revealed. 
A tip for the potatoes, I peeled and cubed them for faster cooking.  I put them in a 9x13 and covered with foil, then roasted at 400 for 30 minutes.  Check them to see if they mash easily, if they don't, throw them back in the oven for a little longer.

This was fantastic! I did make a couple changes after reading some reviews saying it was bland. I replaced 2 cups of the milk with chicken bouillon (made from granules) and since it's going right to my hips anyway, I used butter instead of margarine. This was so easy and so delicious. My daughter requested the recipe be added to her 'off to college' cookbook.  TIP for easy bacon: lay bacon slices in single layer on cold cookie sheet (with a rim), not touching, and place in COLD oven. Turn oven to 400 degrees and set timer for 17 minutes. Perfect bacon every time. Remove to paper towels to drain. Sometimes takes a minute or two more, depending on bacon thickness.

I love a good baked potato soup recipe, but this isn't quite it.  First, you don't need even half of all that bacon, margarine or milk.  And let's face it, this particular potato soup recipe has the word "baked" in the title.  So bake those potatoes, cool them and start making soup later in the day.  When I bake the potatoes, I also bake some leeks, halved lengthwise, one whole leek for every large potato.  Then everything cools while I make a very thin bechamel sauce out of milk and chicken broth in equal parts (2 cups liquid to every large baker), a little bacon grease and flour, and some cheddar cheese.  You're looking for just a hint of cheese flavor, not a lot.  Then I liquify the baked leeks and half the (peeled) potatoes with a hand blender, stir in the cubed baked potatoes (with some skin) and then start playing with the other flavors we all love about a baked potato.  Chives, bacon bits, green onions, sour cream or Greek yogurt, depending on your preference.  This version really comes together at the end, when you add the "stuff".  Tasting for salt is a must at this point.   But the base flavor should echo a baked potato, and you can't imitate that by boiling them.  If you want a good, quick potato soup, then yes, boil away, this recipe will please you.  But if you are looking for the flavor of a baked potato, you have to actually bake the potatoes.  It's not a huge extra step, it just requires a bit of thinking ahead.  You'll be glad you went to the bother.

I'm giving the base of this recipe 5 stars, but it's really my modifications that make it a 5 (in my opinion).  I read the reviews below and took some ideas from others. I try and eat light so I tweaked this to cut some calories.  I used only a 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, 3 cups FF milk, 4 cups chicken stock or broth (I've done both), omitted the sour cream completely, and added garlic salt or powder. If it's still too thin I add a little more flour or corn starch. Because I used unsalted butter I did add a little bacon and a little cheese to add salt and thickness to the soup.  Bacon, cheese and scallions were used as a topping for whomever wanted extra. I've made it twice now and my husband even has rave reviews- that's saying a lot!!! I too think it's better the second day.  If it gets too thick I just add in a little milk when reheating.

Okay....here's in response to the soup being a bit bland....I agreed...so I added cayenne pepper, and luckily I had saved the bacon grease....then added two cups chicken broth and some crushed pepper.  Huge difference....so add the grease, cayenne, chicken broth and enjoy.

Perfect! I did use the bacon grease instead of butter for the flour mixture. Why waste all that flavor? I also left the skin on the potatoes it's so good I didn't want to waste it. Great soup for a cold and windy day!

I used peppered bacon and added in some roasted garlic cloves.  I also baked an extra potato and mashed it to add in some extra thickness.  This is a very hearty, good soup!

A perfect choice for a chilly night in Wisconsin!  Because several reviewers mentioned this needed more flavor (and I felt it would need a nudge, too, for our tastes), I used some diced sweet onions and a clove of garlic which I sauteed in the bacon drippings until soft.  I also added a shredded carrot.  Once that mixture was cooked, I added cayennne and smoked paprika with the flour, and then used 5 cups of milk and 2 cups of chicken stock.  I also used chives instead of green onions as that's what I had on hand and gold potatoes, again what I had on hand.  I used a freshly shredded, sharp, white cheddar.  We enjoyed this very much with the changes I made, and I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I used butter instead of margarine).  It was good.  I noticed it was more flavorful the following day, when I reheated it.  When I make it again I will add more spices to the soup base which is essentially a bechamel (maybe garlic and regular onions sauteeed).  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome soup. I used a little less milk, stick butter, and added chopped green pepper, sauteed the onions, and chicken seasoned in garlic.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I actually have to make it for the the girl friend's soup day at work.  Another note. I changed the servings to 4 persons and it makes at least 6.  So be prepared for leftovers.

Delicious! I halved the recipe since it's only me and my husband. Left out the bacon since i'm a vegetarian and added a little more milk to get it to a good consistency. The flavor was really good even without the bacon and it tasted just like a baked potato. We topped off this yummy soup with more cheese, green onions, and vegetarian bacon bits. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! This is one of those recipes that can either be really fattening or pretty healthy. I chose the healthy route and used fat free milk, fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheese and Smart Balance brand butter. It was so yummy, we did not miss all that fat/calories at all! Good enough to serve to guests!

We really enjoyed this soup, but found it needed more flavour and liquid, so I added 3 cups of chicken broth as well as some cayenne pepper, garlic and extra onion.  We also fried up the skins from the leftover baked potatoes (they came off the potatoes really easily), and served them as a topping on the soup ... my husband's crazy idea, but it worked well and tasted great!

This is very good if you are looking for a thick soup!! I had to change some things because I did not have it all on hand. I omitted the green onions and sour cream and added onion and chive cream cheese instead. It was very tasty!! I also added garlic salt instead of regular salt to give it more flavor. Goes great with a grilled cheese!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I often add some chopped garlic & Tillamook Garlic & White Cheddar cheese to it too. I'm not too experienced at cooking, so this takes me much longer to make than the times listed, but it turns out soooooo good, that it's totally worth it. :) Thank you to Sherry Haupt for submitting it!!

Loved this - but made it gluten and dairy free.  Instead of using flour as a thickener or milk as the liquid, I used an extra potato and 2 cans of lite Coconut Milk.  It made 5 servings.  One more can of Coconut milk would've made an additional serving.  Also, I let individuals add sour cream at the table when served rather than putting it in the entire pot.  It was awesome!  If you've never used coconut milk before - don't be afraid as the soup will be richer without a coconut taste.  And, it's better for you!

My favorite soup ever!  The only thing I did differently was used 2 large white onions (which I understand did make less aesthetically pleasing but I just prefer white over green) and instead of black pepper I used cayenne to give it a little heat.  So amazing. I ate it for dinner 4 straight nights!

Awesome soup!  Did make changes based on other reviewer suggestions.  Reduced flour and butter to 1/3 cup.  Used 4 cups chicken broth/3 cups milk.  Added salt, pepper, and a little cayenne pepper to taste.  Mashed some potato chunks to thicken soup a bit more.  Bacon, addtl cheddar, and corn(not in recipe) were alacarte.  Even my picky eater said this was good.  Which is the ultimate compliment!

This recipe was awesome, it was the best potato soup I've tried to make. Very good according to the family! It was really thick though. I will try it with a little chicken broth next time.

This turned out fabulous.  I used the bacon and cheese as garnish because I prefer crunchy bacon, and hubs likes less cheese.  Also, I used a hand blender to create a creamy soup by breaking down the potatoes.  Flavor and proportions were great, though!

Great soup!! Too much roux though!! Really it only needs to have a 3rd maybe a 1/4 the amount because the starch of the potatoes with thicken it. I did not have green onions so I browned about 2/3 of a large red onion in butter and added with the potatoes and added some broccoli as well. I added some salt and pepper at this point then after about 5 min I put the bacon in to increase the flavor as well. I had to cook it a bit longer to soften the broccoli. Next time I will use alot less flour because it was way too thick, but otherwiseth flavor was great!

This was VERY bland. After tasting it the first time I decided to go with the suggestions of other reviewers and add some chicken broth. Even after I added the chicken broth it was still very bland. Sorry to say, but definitely not the best soup out there.

Super delightful and satisfying - gave it 4/5 simply because its written to be a bit unhealthy:(  If you're going for soul food that's alright I guess but we made some changes and it still turned out wonderfully.  Vegetarian bacon, skim milk, left skins on potatoes (just bc we're lazy chefs), low fat cheddar and sour cream.  Still felt sinful and and serves like a meal!

I give it 4 stars as is. But 5 stars with a few slight changes!

Definitely less of the roux...I sued 1/2 cup of margarine and flour and would still cut back on that next time. Just a little thick for our preference! ALso I would use a couple more potatoes. It needs more salt & pepper than it calls for and I added garlic salt,onion salt, and basil. IT was a bit bland as written. But after those slight changes it was so good!

What a great way to use up leftover baked potatoes!! I cooked the bacon as directed, then carmelized a whole medium diced onion adding minced garlic when it was close to being finished. Cut the margarine and flour in half, the starch from the potatoes will thicken this soup even further.  It is a little on the bland side as other reviewers stated, but play with a few of your favorite seasonings and you'll end up with a delicious, economical soup.  I ended up adding a tad more sour cream, seasoning salt, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce - yummy and hearty. Garnish with additional bacon crumbles and shredded Cheddar.  Thanks for the recipe, Sherry!!

i'm sad to say that this soup was not worth the calories for me. i had high hopes because of the yummy ingredients and great reviews, but in my opinion it lacked flavor. it was very thick and creamy though. i had to add an extra teaspoon of salt. i also had to cook it for much longer than the recipe indicated, because the potatoes weren't soft enough for my taste. this was my first attempt at potato soup. if i decide to try this recipe again, i will make some changes that other reviewers have suggested. thank you though, my husband and i had fun making it.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, but used half the bacon (since that's what I had on hand) and 1/4 white onion instead of green (I added it to the melted butter before adding the flour).  I doubled the cheese and thought overall it was very good.  My husband was thrilled.  The only alteration I would make next time is to add one bouillon cube to add a little more flavor. The green onions would be a nice addition too, I'd probably make sure to buy some next time.

This was so good! I didn't have leftover baked potatoes so I used the microwaved baked potatoes recipe from this site for the baked potatos. I used 4 tbls butter and 4 tbls flour with 6 cups of milk ( 1%). I didn't add any sour cream or bacon to the soup just topped it with it. Very good and so comforting!!!

I joined this site just to rate this recipe!  I did not care for this.  Bland, not thick at all, and a bunch of money wasted since my family refuses to eat the leftovers (which I can't blame them because I won't eat them either!) Other reviewers said this is comparable to Panera-absolutely not!  I don't know how it rated as high as it has.

This recipe is delicious!  It did get too thick, so I ended up adding 2 or 3 extra cups of milk to it.  It's very caloric and fat-filled, so I am ready to try the lightened-up versions posted on here.  Thanks for the tips, everyone.

I cannot express how HUGE a hit this soup was!! I love the versatility of it. I made it almost according to the recipe this time, but I added a clove of minced  garlic with the melted butter.    This was my first attempt at a cream soup, and it is AMAZING. It does come pretty thick. so I do suggest adding a little more milk, especially if you plan on saving any leftovers.

This soup is hearty and delicious. Perfect for a cold, winter day. I have made it as the recipe says, and with a substitution of chicken broth for half of the milk, and both ways are wonderful. Excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe, but I did make a few adjustments.   First off, I did not have any green onions, so I sauted one regular onion with a large clove of garlic in some olive oil, then added it when the recipe called for adding onions.  For liquid, I used 3 cups milk and 3 cups chicken stock, then added more stock as needed to adjust the thickness.  I only had uncooked potatoes, and I simply added a few more minutes for the potatoes to cook.  I also left the skins on.  And due to family tastes, I left the bacon and sour cream on the side.   But the flavors were outstanding, and I thought this was a great base recipe to start from!

If I could give it more stars I would!!! This recipe is absolutely delicious. I only made one change and instead of the 7 cups of milk, I used 3 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of milk. The chicken broth gave it a wonderful flavor and I did not have to add any salt to it at all. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I love this recipe!!!  I have used it for years now and everyone in my family LOVES it.  I have actually won a soup cook off with it.  Like others, I use some of the bacon drippings to season it up a little more.  My family loves it really thick, so if it isn't thick enough, I just add some instant potatoes till it is as thick as we like it!

Wonderful recipe, my kids ask for this all the time now. And I can never make enough. Gives the taste of eating a loaded baked potato without the oven. Completely love this recipe.

Better than most restaurants. I only used 1/2c butter, fat free milk, 6 medium potatoes and a little less bacon. The trick is to keep stirring, otherwise everything settles and sticks to the pot. Everyone liked putting on different 'toppings' too.

This soup was soo delicious! I did use more bacon that called for because bacon makes everything taste better! Next time I will cut up my potatoes a little smaller as I left them big. My husband and 2 year old loved it! Gives you that nice warm feeling inside. I will defiantly make this again and again

Awesome!  Thank you for the recipe. I made some alterations, although I'm sure the original is just as good.  Here are my changes:  1 small onion, diced (just because I don't keep green onions on hand), 50/50 split of margerine and bacon drippings (just for extra bacon flavor), for the broth I used 50/50 split of skim milk and chicken broth (made from chicken boulion - just to save some pennies), no salt (because the boulion and bacon drippings add enough sodium).  I made it ahead and then kept it warm in my crock pot on low until we were ready for dinner.  Leave your diet at the door and just enjoy some comfort food for the evening!

This was delicious!  I knew by the amount of bacon and cheese in this recipe that I was going to enjoy it.  The only thing I changed was that I used cornstarch instead of flour because I can't have gluten.  Would definately make this again!

Wonderful and easy! (I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose and it still tasted great. Sauted mushrooms and the onions in the bacon grease before added them for more kick. Everything else per recipe = Yum!!)

This soup is amazing!!  I made this on a cold evening when we had company over...and there wasn't a spoonful left!  After reading quite a few of the other reviews, the only alteration that I made to the recipe was instead of 2/3 cup butter, I used 1/3c butter and 1/3c of the bacon grease...it sounds kind of icky, but the flavor of the soup was unbelievable!  And, if you cook the butter/grease and flour for a minute or two (stirring constantly) after it starts to bubble you will loose the "floury" taste that others have talked about.

This was a great, thick recipe for my husband's favorite soup!  The only change I made was that I lightly mashed the potatoes so that there wasn't big chunks of potatoes.  He loved it and so did my 2 year old daughter!

Awesome recipe. I was searching for a recipe like the one my mom made when I was a kid and this has to be it. I doubled the recipe because it's winter time here and it won't go to waste with the cold weather abounding. I add green onion, white onion, cheese and celery to it too but that is just my personal preference. I recommend adding the potatoes at the very end if they are rather soft from overbaking the night before-like mine were:) Potatoes heat up quickly and retain heat for a long time so the warmth of the soup will heat the potatoes to piping hot in just a matter of minutes. Also, be careful with your salt, potatoes retain a heavy amount of salt(in fact if you ever put too much salt in a soup or such, you can add diced potatoes and strain them out after an hour or so and they will have absorbed most of the salt so you can start anew). You may think your soup isn't salty enough while cooking if your potatoes are in-just because they will absorb the salt out of the rest of the soup. But as the flavors begin to meld together, the salt will redistribute and mingle with the other aspects of the soup, especially the next day!

Good, filling, and most definitely unhealthy... Not for those who are dieting but a good comfort food if that it your thing (and it is mine). I suggest using extra cheese and a clove of garlic (chopped) to add more flavor...

Oh my gosh!  Love it.  I made only one change.  I used half milk and half chicken broth.  Learn that from Rachael Ray. It makes it taste like it cooked all day.  Never any leftovers.  Made 5 times already.

This soup was awesome!  It has such good flavor.  I made on a weeknight...that may be a mistake because it is somewhat time consuming.  I think this is a weekend soup for sure!  It's worth every minute though!    We all loved it.

I used 1/2 stick butter and 1/2 cup flour and that seemed to work out just fine for thickness for us.  I also added garlic powder,onion powder and a touch of cayenne.  I did use one small white onion (I was out of green) but added some chives to make up for that. I used colby jack cheese (all I had on hand) This was a very good tasting soup and I'll happily make again.  Thank you so much.

This was an outstanding soup and sufficient enough for a dinner that will get you full. I sauteed white onion, garlic and celery in the margerine before I added the flour. It turned out to be amazing. TRY!!!

This receipe was a great starter. Me and my hubby like really bold flavors and this was just a little to bland for us so I made the following changes. 3 cups of milk, 4 cups of chicken stock, 2 cups of shredded cheddar, about 12 oz of sour cream, 1 lb of bacon and salt and pepper to taste. With these changes the soup turned out awesome!

My family and I just love this soup! I make sure I dice the potatoes really small. I also add only about four cups of milk and four cups of chicken broth. It makes the soup not as thick. And the chicken broth adds a great flavor!

I rate this a 4 because I tweeked it a bit. The first time I made this I went by the recipe this time I only used 1/3 flour 1/2 stick of butter(real) and I mashed up some of the potatoes and in order to not make this consistency of and actual baked potato I used almost a whole carton of chix stock on top of the milk I also added seasoned salt. It was perfect after the tweeks and kept better.

Ohmigosh!  THIS recipe is the best potato soup recipe I have ever run across!  The only thing I did was I added a couple of light dashes of nutmeg to the soup as it cooked.  I served this soup with some thinnly sliced onion deli bread, buttered it and toasted it until crunchy in a toaster oven.  Great flavor and great for dipping.  It was lighter than crackers and just added alittle more jazz to an already fabulous soup.

I made this last night, instead of the potato soup I usually make (also from this site). It tasted like flour. I had to add more flavor by using chicken granuals, celery salt and onion powder. It turned out extremely thick, like sludge, after it had cooled a bit. I would decrease the flour, and maybe add some more veggies.

I made this soup for this morning for dinner tonight.  It was really good and my family enjoyed it a lot.  I did make a lot of changes though.  As per previous reviewers, I reduced the margarine and flour to 1/4 c each, added about 1 tsp bacon grease and did a medley of carrots, celery and onion (each about 3/4 c) and sauteed them in the margarine before adding the flour.    I saved the bacon crumbles, cheese and sour cream for serving.  I used a lot of chicken broth and only about 2 cups milk.  At first I didn't add enough broth and as the soup cooled it got way to thick...I added about another 2 cups broth and it was the  best consistence for us.  It reheated well too.

WOW!!  This soup was wonderful! My six year old son said "it tasted like heaven".  I added more salt than the recipe called for and I used 6 potatoes like one of the reviews suggested.  I also coarsely mashed them.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I absolutely cannot get enough of this soup! I've been making it for about 2 years now and it is just awesome! I always end up using less milk than it calls for becuase I'm afraid it will get too liquidy and I like it to be a little thicker than regular soup. I always serve topped with shredded Cheddar, sourcream, fresh chives, and crispy bacon...mmm mmmm! I can't wait to make it again! Definately worth the effort.

I slightly underbaked my potatoes, but the soup still turned out pretty good. The roux in the beginning turned out to be a disaster... way too much flour for that little amt of butter. I added flour and milk gradually (adding flour to a warm mixture in a separate bowl), so it wouldn't clump up. I painstakingly mashed up the potato while they were in the soup in attempt to cook them--it worked! I used a little half and half b/c I ran out of milk, so I didn't quite add 7 cups of liquid. Anyway, thanks for the recipe, awesome except for the roux in the beginning.

This is my most favorite soup!!!!  I use whole milk and real butter, guess I'm not worried about calories.  For some reason my Hispanic husband doesn't care for it so my best friend and I make it when he is out of town.  It makes the soup more special.

My daughter loves Red Robin's Baked Potato Soup, so I have been trying to find a recipe that she will like.  She loves this soup and she is a very picky teenager.

This soup was flavorful enough but the consistency of the soup was just too strange for me to fully enjoy it.  I used only 1/4 cup of flour but next time I would omit the flour altogether and I also used bacon grease in place of margarine to add more flavour which I think worked but I wouldn't do it again.  I used six cups of milk and one can of chicken broth.  I will be trying a different recipe next time as I was very disappointed in the texture.

Perfect comfort food.  I've made it several times, to rave reviews.  I hold out some of the bacon to pass as a topping with additional sour cream, cheese, and chives.

I have made this soup several times each winter since 2001. I just use boiled potatoes instead of baked.  Low fat milk, cheese and cream are fine substitute. It is simply awesome.

OK, it bugs me when people rate a recipe but they change everything about it. I did do that here so I apologize. I give this recipe 5 stars because it gave me some new ideas...
First,peeled and pierced the potatoes and microwaved them.
Second, sauteed half of a chopped up white onion in butter.
Third, added the flour and milk..don;t think I needed to do that. Will omit the next time.
Fourth, added in the diced up potatoes into the milk. I did not add all the milk..just kept adding as it thickened and toward the end.Also added two cans of low sodium chicken broth.
Fifth, mashed the potatoes with a masher so it had little chunks.
And finally, did add the sour cream and used another reviewers super suggestion to add the salt add the end.Doing that at the end was perfect. Added pepper in the beginning and it needed alot--I also used more potatoes.(yukons)
Thanks for helping me find a better potato soup!!

Delicious soup!  I cut the margarine back a bit because I wanted to use some of the bacon grease added to a bit of the margarine for the roux.  The one time I made it I had to use some 1/2 and 1/2 as I had run out of milk - sure was creamy.  Will definitely make again.  Great base for many creamy soups!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is simple to make and tastes great. I used eight cups of milk instead of seven because other reviews said it was too thick.  I would also recommend using a bit less flour.  Yummy!

This was so nice on a cold, rainy day.  The only change I made was to use the drippings from the bacon instead of butter.  Not very healthy, but healthy isn't what you're going for when you make potato soup.

Hmmm a good treat for winter time. I did put garlic powder, onion powder, and chicken seasoning into the milk broth to give it some flavour. Halved the recipe, used only half of the butter and flour  to make the roux. Upped the cheese to 1 C and kept everything else the same. Very Very Yummy!

Defiantly awesome. First time I tried making potatoe soup instead of getting it out of the can. One thing you've got to be sure of is whisking it frequently. I didn't do it enough and it scorched the bottom of my pot. My mom wasn't too happy about that. But anyways, I cut back on the butter, milk and flour, as did everyone else. Still turned out awesome. Thanks!

My daughters friends tell me my potato soup is better than O'Charleys, and the only changes I make are to use Velveeta cheese in the block instad of cheddar(I use a litle more than called for) and I use a little more bacon.To die for!

This soup was quite good--very thick and rich; it needed a bit of spicing up, though, so I added cayenne pepper, dill weed (next time I may try chives), and extra cheese.  I used new potatoes (2 extra) and left the skin on, mashing them in the soup. It was a hit--thanks.

Taste was ok but it was a bit bland. The bacon enhanced the flavor but it was not enough. May be it would be better to subtitute chicken broth for some of the milk? I am glad I used only half of the butter and flour as suggested by other reviewers, otherwise it would have been too thick.

A very versatile recipe. I hesitate to rate it because I made so many changes it was more like cream of potato than baked potato soup. When I started making it I realized we would not like it as written because of the high fat content, so I eliminated the sour cream and used chicken broth and half and half instead of 7 cups of milk. I used six slices of bacon and skipped the cheese-we just added it to individual servings. I did let it sit overnight and I think that helped maximize the flavor. Thanks for sharing; I will make my version again!

This is a great cold weather soup. My son, a baked potato soup afficionado, loved this. I have used the pre-cooked bacon a few times and did not find it offensive as did some other reviewers. Also, have microwaved the potatoes and it still tasted great.

I cooked this soup for 80 men and boys at a Scout Camporee and it was a HUGE HIT!  I prepped a lot of it, but it turned out great.  I had some left over, took it home and froze it.  I brought it to work and everyone loved it!

I like that Allrecipe.com let me customize the recipe for 80, it gave me the confidence to try this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for about a year, it is phenomenal!  It is TRUE comfort food.  My husband says "soup is not a meal" with any other soup, not this one!  Everyone loves it.  Thanks for the great recipe. The only change I do is use raw potatoes, peel and cube them, and boil for 10 minutes.

There are some recipes that are only so-so and others that are just perfect. This is one of the great recipes I'm thrilled to find. What a nice way to use up leftover potatoes. I did add a bit of chicken granules. Everyone loved it served in the "Italian Bread Bowls," a recipe from this site, too. That is another winner (be sure to read the suggestions: add sugar to yeast and bake in bowl to form.)

This is an excellent soup, but WAY TOO THICK!  After refrigerating the leftovers, I had some the next day and the soup literally looked like a bowl of mashed potatoes with bacon and green onion mixed in.  I had to add some milk to it to thin it down, but it was still too thick for my taste.  The flavor was wonderful -- I didn't add any extra seasonings.  Next time, however, I will do as another reviewer suggested and cut the butter and flour by half.  Should be the perfect consistency then.  Add additional grated cheese to top each soup bowl as the cheese seems to get lost in the soup mixture with all that other creamy stuff.

This soup was absolutely delicious!!I made it on a very cold day, and this thick, hearty soup warmed me and my family up. Instead of using green onions, I used chives( it made it more like a baked potato). I would suggest using more milk if you don't like such a thick soup, like me. Also, you need to keep your eye on the soup while the milk and roux are cooking because the milk could easily burn if you're not stirring and watching it constantly. Great with thick sourdough bread! Make sure you have all your ingredients lined up and ready to go in to the soup before you begin cooking. I had to sprint back and forth doing all of the steps by myself at the same time! Very simple recipe, and quite easy to make if you only have a bit of time!

VERY GOOD. A great soup for those cold winter days. Stays with you for a long time. Very rich so it's hard to eat alot. Definetly will be making this more often.

This was an okay soup, but as is I don't think I would make it again. I add my agreement to the reviewers who have said it is bland. By nature, potato soup IS somewhat bland, so that isn't the end of the world, but there isn't enough "potato" flavor and that's where the bland factor is a problem. It tastes like white sauce with potato added instead of potato soup. Hints of sour cream and cheese are there but I expected they would be more dominant. I really wanted to like this soup better because it is a great combination of flavors. I think I will play with the idea on my own, maybe cooking some potato in the milk and then pureeing before thickening with the roux.

My husband and I absolutely love this soup. And it is SO simple! I've tried others on this site and they don't compare. I did add a little minced garlic and I've found it is best with extra sharp cheddar cheese.

We had this for dinner this evening and we all enjoyed it.  I didn't have any left over baked potatoes so I just threw several medium sized potatoes in my steamer for 35 minutes.  Even my son who isn't a potato eater ate this soup.  My daughter usually orders this kind of soup at a local restaurant chain and she loved it!  She said that it tasted just like it.  Believe me, that is a huge compliment.  :)  Thank you for sharing just a wonderful recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I followed previous suggestions and didn't make the roux as thick... I doubled the basic recipe but only did 1/2 c ea of flour and butter.  (I'd say I used this recipe more as a guideline than followed precisely, don't be afraid to experiment) To add some flavor, I used some chicken broth in place of some of the milk and then added a whole bar of cream cheese before I put the potatoes in.  I think the best thing I did was fried the bacon in the same pan I made the soup in, draining the bacon grease before I made the roux and then added some bacon in with the cream cheese.  I used hash brown cubes that I'd pre-cooked in the oven to make it easier.  Everyone really enjoyed it, it wasn't overly salty but had a good flavor.  I let each person add their own sharp cheddar cheese and fixins and served it with hot crusty French Bread and a salad.  Be forewarned, it requires almost constant attention and stirring to make sure it doesn't burn in the bottom of the pan so have everything ready and waiting... Then ENJOY!

This soup was very good, similar to the baked potato soup that they serve at Outback Steakhouse.  I needed to add a little more seasoning to it than suggested, but that's just a matter of taste.  I have a ton of leftovers, but will make this again.

I did as others suggested and cut down a little on the roux.  I believe did 1/2c. Flour to 1/2c. Butter, but I honestly don't recall.  It came out very thick, like a chowder, which is how I wanted it.  I would definatly suggest adding more salt than called for along with some pepper, because otherwise it is VERY Bland.  I also added some Sauted onions to the soup, and I didn't put the cheese and bacon in the pot of soup.  I sprinkled it on top of each individual bowl, so people could have as much cheese and bacon as they wanted.  This was a big hit in my house.  It's great for those cold winter days!

12/18/03 - Once again a big hit.  I can't get over how much this soup tastes like the soup at houlihans.

2/24/2004 - Mmmm Mmmm Good!!!You need to try this!

Oh my gosh -this is wonderful soup!  My hubby just raved and he is not a creamy soup lover. I did saute some minced sweet onion and garlic in the bacon drippings and added that to the butter and flour mixture for a little more flavor.  Also needed a little more seasonings for our tastes, but we did that at the table.  I will make this often this winter - thank you Sherry!

This was pretty good. For some reason (I guess because of all the rave reviews) I really expected something fantastic & I don't think this was all that great. It was good, my family wasn't highly impressed, don't know if I'll make it again.

GREAT RECIPE.  I topped each bowl with shredded cheddar bacon bits green onions and a dollop of sour cream.  Next time I will use only half the roux (flour & butter). it was a little too thick...but a great recipe overall.

Absolutely Wonderful.  I've always loved potato soup but never made it.  My husband and 19 year old loved it.  Definitely a keeper!  I will have to think the leftovers a little as the soup got very very thick (I love thick soup but this was a little over the top).  Will add another cup of milk next time.

this is the best potato soup recipe i've ever tried as well as the best potato soup i've ever had. it is one of my husband's favorites. he asks for it all the time. some suggestions: be sure to cook the roux constantly, from the time you combine the butter and flour. one time i took it off the heat to combine and blend the flour to prevent it from burning and the finished soup wasn't half as good. also, be sure not to use too much sour cream. if you do it makes the soup too bland. excellent recipe. thanks!

This was very good. I would add more potatoes and serve with cheese to give more flavor. I agree with the bacon bit suggestion. I used turkey bacon and it seemed a bit floppy in the soup. Great heated up the next day

Better than Tony Roma's! It is however very thick as other reviews have stated. It needs to be thinned and add salt to taste. I liked the cheese and bacon cooked into the soup. Make sure the bacon is cooked crispy.

This soup was delicious!  To make it a bit less fattening I substituted skim milk and just added a tad of cornstarch/water to help thickened it.  The whole family loved it!

Absolutely fantastic!!  I have made this soup several times now and each time I get compliments from my husband, who is not a big soup fan.  Like some other reviewers, I used Bacon Bits instead of crumbled bacon and I put in a pinch of onion powder.  This dish is becoming a "regular" in my household.  Thanks Sherry!

I made this soup for a church pot luck and got so many compliments for it. Even my husband who doesn't normally eat anything with cheese loved it! It was very time consuming, and I think it will be a special soup I'll only make a few times a year.  I added a bit more salt, and it was perfect.

This soup was *SO* bland, and took *SO* long to make. I agree wholeheartedly with the poster below - because the flour is not browned in this recipe, it was the only thing I could taste. This actually tastes exactly like my mother-in-law's bacon gravy, which has NO flavor whatsoever. I will definitely not be making this again!

I was so glad one of the other reviewers mentioned the soup at Bennigans, since that is what I was trying to re-create! This soup was fantastic, and not nearly as hard as I thought it would be. HIGHLY recommend for snowy days!

Thick and pasty.  This recipe has potential but needs a lot of changes. Use a bit less milk as it dilutes the flavour of the potato.  I would cut the flour to 1/3 and butter to 1/2.  Add yellow onions with the butter and saute.  I mixed in 1/2 cup sour cream at the end and garnished with a few real bacon bits, cheddar cheese and green onions just before serving.  Dish looks great like that.

I tried the recipe for "Baked Potato Soup". My two daughters ages 14 & 16 thought it was fantastic. Since we reside in the Southwest, I added a 4oz can of chopped green chilies which brought extra taste to the already rich flavor. Trying new recipes is something I really enjoy so I look forward to your newsletter.

Like other reviewers, I cut the amount of milk down to 2 cups whole milk, half of the sour cream, and subbed the rest of the liquid with broth.  The butter/margarine is also unnecessary in my opinion.  I added corn, 1 Vidalia onion, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and oregano.  The soup still came out delicious without all of that fat.

Yes I made changes, that is why I gave it a 4 star. This recipe as written has way to little seasoning. It needed more salt and pepper. I added a small can of steamed corn as well as more cheese. And some garlic sautéed with the onions. I also added bacon. It is a nice creamy and a bit chunky soup.

Super thunder and raining day today.  Had some leftover baked potatoes from over estimating the other night.  Used the ingredient  search, and this came up.  When the gang returned from school, wet and cold, they were greeted with this wonderful meal.  
As a kid I loved some chunky Campbell's soup that had big bites of potato in it.  This brought back those homey memories, but tasted SO MUCH BETTER.  Homemade for the WIN!
I made no changes.

Hands down the best recipe of all the Baked Potato soups we have tried.  I did use some of the bacon drippings for the flour roux and was my only adaptation of the recipe.  I made second lactose free version for my husband, using lactose free whole milk and Cabot brand cheese (brick style I shredded) and a non dairy sour cream.  No difference was noted by my kids between both versions.  I have made this twice in the past three weeks at the request of my family.

Awesome! I altered the recipe a bit; it called for 7 cups of milk and I decided to use 4 cups of milk and one can of cream of chicken soup. I also added garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, and a chicken bouillon cube in it.  Came out very thick and creamy; great for a cold rainy day!

One of my favorite recipes to make when I have friends over for dinner. I opt to use 5 cups of milk, and 2 cups of chicken stock. I also put in a bottle of beer (either Rogue Dead Guy or Irish Death) to add a bit more flavor. Another thing I do differently is use red potatoes since I prefer the taste of those a bit more. Awesome recipe!

Yum!! Have been making a similar soup for years but sometimes I couldn't get the thickness right. I used the bacon grease (just a bottom layer of the pan) and touch a butter to make flour mixture. Gave  it a little extra flavor. Otherwise perfect recipe for me.

Used 1/3 lb. bacon (all I had) and also added 1 1/2 cups chopped mushroom stems that I had left over from stuffed mushroom appetizers.  Sautéed mushrooms with onions,etc.  did not have tarragon so substituted 1 tsp thyme. Used half and half instead of heavy cream.  The soup came out great and was delicious!

I made some minor modifications: I used 4 cups of chicken broth + 4 cups of whole milk rather than 7 cups of milk that is prescribed; I did not use the sour cream; I added several chopped up stalks of celery; I used real butter instead of margarine and I used regular yellow onion rather than green onion. The soup turned out great! The flavor and consistency were very good. I don't eat pork so I used turkey bacon rather than pork bacon. My only suggestions are: 1. Use the bacon as a garnish on top of the soup at the time that it is served so that it stays crunchy; and 2. Use more potatoes than the stated four (it needed about 2-3 more potatoes in my opinion).

I made a couple changes as others suggested. First I used butter instead of margarine. I also used the drained bacon grease with the butter to make the roux. Then I used 4 cups milk, 3 cups chicken stock. The end consistency was perfect. I also used garlic salt instead of regular and I would suggest season to taste and don't follow the recipe. I probably put double the salt and pepper listed because it needed it after a tasting.

I adjusted this to ingredients on hand and preferences, and it was delicious! I used a few of the reviewers suggestions, added a little dry ranch dressing, sauteed some onions and garlic in the bacon fat (didn't have green onion) and added some extra spices. A very good, easy, and quick recipe that I will be making often! Thanks!

This dish was absolutely savory. I did reduce the flour by half and substituted 2 cups of milk with chicken broth as suggested in the reviews. This is another one for the books. Thanks

Wow!  Excellent, creamy and delightful for a cold day.  You can vary the amount of green onion and bacon per your taste but everything else should stay as is.  I used a triple cheese combination as opposed to straight Cheddar and it was extremely good.  My recommendation for the potatoes is to bake them at 425, wrapped in foil, for about 1 hour and then let them sit for an hour.  The potatoes have an excellent texture and taste.  I used russets.  Enjoy!!

I started my soup base  with ham fat   I cooked it down with water and butter then ( removed fat pieces ) 
added sautéed onion to it    cooled then used the next day
I boiled potatoes and cup and half of water with whole milk about three cups added the onion fat mix 
with pepper , salt ,parsley , garlic , and celery cooked it all up at the end I like to purée a few of the potatoes to help thicken  it up some with a little rue to help also 
add some bacon, scallions ,cheese

Really good, but a little bland as written. It needed more salt and pepper, maybe garlic would be good too. I skipped the sour cream to save calories and we didn't miss it.  As others said, it was too thick so next time I will try it with half the roux.

Great as written but for those of you that want to cut calories and still enjoy this soup....just substitute the flour and potatoes with 1 head cauliflower( or frozen bag florets) steamed then blended until smooth, just add a bit of your milk to this process to make it easier to blend.

This recipes is really good! It does come out thick so I did add more 2% milk at the end to thin it out. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and some bacon grease to enhance the bacon flavor (obviously I'm not going for the healthy version) ;)

I just made this for the first time as a trial run for thanksgiving. The recipe came out exactly as advertised. It was very very creamy, like eating thin mashed potatoes with cubes of potato in it. I thought it was delicious. 

The only change I made was to not skin the potatoes, which is a step I skip in any potato recipe. I don't understand why anyone would ever want to take off the delicious skin.

I did like the base of this soup, however, it lacked flavor. Next time I am going to put a can of cream of potato and possibly add some veggies such as corn and leeks. But it came out at just the right thickness and was very creamy and filling!

I made several modifications to this recipe based on other comments, and I was really happy with how it turned out. It tasted even better on the second day. I am vegetarian so instead of using bacon I added 1/3 cap-full of liquid smoke. I used one stick of butter and 1/2 cup flour. 2 cups of whole milk, 2 cups reconstituted powdered milk,3 cups veggie broth and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also added 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I like that this can be made in under an hour.

I alter this a bit. I use the bacon drippings to make the roux instead of butter. It's not heart healthy but it's very delicious.

I liked this but after reading lots of recipes & reviews decided I wanted to go 2/3 of the broth cream base & the other 1/3 a stock base, I went with vegetable stock since Im vegetarian. I sauteed 1 cup of diced white onion in the butter then added the flour for the rue. To the broth I added a small bay leaf which is a must for any soup just dont put too much, its another subtle layer of flavor so people dont take a bite & go ok, ya, milk & potatoes, bleh ^_^  I had russet & golden yukon laying around so I tossed the russets in then waited 15 min & through in the yukon golds so the russets boiled away to thicken & flavor the broth & the yukon stayed firm enough to give you little bites of potatoes in your spoon. Topped with the cheddar & green onions & sour cream. Yum!

My family loved this!!  Only changes I made, only 3 cups of milk and 4 cups of chicken broth. Also, I only put 1/3 cup of all purpose flour, it was plenty thick enough making these changes.

I made this as the main dish for a party figuring it would be good to keep in the crockpot as well as filling, plus I could prepare in advance and then have no worries during the party.  I tripled the recipe.  This really is an excellent recipe but I did think it was a bit bland.  After tasting it, I looked at reviews and followed another reviewers suggestion and added ranch seasoning packet to the soup.  That made all the difference in the world.  However, you MUST be careful.  The dairy ingredients in this will scorch / brown rapidly.  If you keep it in a crockpot only keep it on warm, and don't even try to keep it on low on the stove.  Just a hint.  I will definitely make this again but not to sit out and keep warm.  It was still really good a little browned but at its best first made.

This Baked Potato Soup was great!  I did make a couple of adjustments like the other reviews suggested.  1) I used 1/2 of butter and flour.  2) I used 3 1/2 cups of skim milk and two cans of Campbell's low sodium chicken broth.  3) Used 3 large potatoes and 6 green onions.  4) I used 3 Knorr Chicken Bouillon cubes and I did not add any salt.  6) I used fat free cheese and sour cream to cut down on the fat and calories.  My soup was awesome.  I had a ton left over to last the week while the cold weather is coming through! :-)

Loved the recipe but made a few tweaks. The recipe as is will easily make 8 BIG servings. I cut back to a "half" size and still fed 3 adults, and have two servings left over. Following some of the other users recommendations I made the following changes. 1. I did use all of the grease from the bacon (mmmm... bacon grease) 2. Instead of doing all of the milk. I split it with half chicken broth, half milk. I also added a cube of chicken bullion to add some flavor. 3. I added one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Gave it a nice flavor! 3. I sautéed 1 teaspoon minced garlic and just under 1/4 cut of minced sweet union in the butter before making the roux. 4. Lastly. I MASHED 1/3 of the potatoes to give it a thicker, almost chowder like soup. All in all... it was excellent.

My whole family loved it!  We did half milk and half chicken broth and added fresh minced garlic and onion powder.  It was delicious!

First time I made this is followed the instructions, but ended up having to add more milk because it was too thick. Made it tonight and used 4 cups milk (1%) and 3 cups low sodium chicken broth. Initially, I also cut the rue (butter and flour mixture) in half as well but found that was too thin. Whipped up the other half of the rue and added it before I added the potatoes and onions. Perfect!  In the end it was the consistency a bit thicker than tomato soup. The flavor is amazing!

Read all reviews.  Made roux w/ 1/2 of butter and recipe amount of flour.  Browned roux (dark gold color).  Sauteed 1/2 yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic in other half of butter.  Added to roux and blended well. Blended in chicken stock(1/2 of liquid called for) and cooked  half of potatoes.  Other potatoes in oven.  Didn't mash any potatoes. Added milk per recipe. Soup tasted great - no flour taste, but very thick. Next time, I'll bake all potatoes and, if too thick, just add chicken stock to desired thickness. All other ingredients in recipe added as written. Sorry to change recipe - prefer to prepare as recipe says, but so much info that I made changes.  I think the secret is in the roux. Didn't use bacon grease. Might tweak for fun, but original recipe is wonderful.

love this recipe!  I've been using it for years!  The only thing I do differently is I add a tablespoon or so of Tone's chicken base, and I don't peel the potatoes.  I pretty much do all the ingredients to taste, but this is a super soup starter!  oh, and I use the same for the bacon as I do the soup....get all that yummy goodness from the bottom!

This was very lack luster in the flavor department but it was a good base to build off of. I added chives, a small sweet onion chopped, roasted garlic and some good smoked paprika and it turned out great.

Excellent, thick soup. Because I like extra spice, I added two whole, dried cayenne peppers, a pint of heavy cream, and 1/2 a yellow onion, chopped and sauteed in bacon fat. I believe good soup uses what I have on hand--so at the end, I removed the two peppers before I added to the bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions an 8oz pkg of baby Bellas (mushrooms). It fed 3 grown men with just one serving take-home container for our guest. If you plan to feed teenagers, I strongly recommend doubling this recipe. Six servings, as stated in the above recipe must be for dainty, strict diet-driven individuals whose stomachs have been pre-shrunk.

I thought this would be too pasty with that much flour and butter, so I used my standard 2 Tbsp of each for the roux, and I used a mix of 2% milk and skim (cleaning out the fridge!), probably totaling closer to 5 cups of milk.  For flavor, I added a clove of garlic, some chives and used Italian truffled salt.  On a cold and blustery day like today, this was heaven in a bowl!  Even with the lighter milk, you can still get a thick enough soup but just simmering it a bit longer.  I also left my peels on the potatoes - that might not appeal to many people, but I like it that way.

Great potato soup recipe.  I did find it really thick so I used an additional cup of milk and a cup of chicken broth.   It set overnight before serving to let the flavors blend.   It was a hit!  I added brocolli florets (frozen and cooked) so that each could add or not.

Kicked it up a notch by substituting 1 cup of heavy cream for one of the cups of milk....added a little bacon grease to the roux...made it incredibly rich....but super thick...so I used a cup or so of chicken broth to thin it some....amazing flavor

Tried this recipe last night, OMG! I used non-fat Parmalat instead of milk and it was delicious. I also added the leftover frozen Honey Baked Ham from New Years, and only used 4 slices of thick cut bacon. Some shallots and garlic (my own addition) gave it great flavor. A little dab of sour cream on top and its ready! This is a great base recipe and allows room for your own additions. I definitely recommend this recipe!

This was great! I used 4.5 cups half/half and 3.5 cups chicken stock; in place of the milk. I added 2 celery stalks, and 3 Tbs bacon grease. Everyone enjoyed it, will definitely make again.

Delicious!!  The one thing i like to do when making a cream soup/ sauce is to melt the butter until it is golden brown (it takes less than a minute on medium heat).  When i add the flour, i let it cook for about a minute to help build the flavour. Do these two simple steps helps the soup take on alot of delicious extra flavour with little or no work.

I have made this several times so far. My family loves this soup, it is so good. I followed another reviewers advice of 3.5 C milk and 3.5 C chicken broth the first time I made it as I didn't have 7 C of milk and still do it that way. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

I made this last night. It was very good. I did add extra cheddar cheese and some cream cheese to thicken it up. I think it gave it more of a restaraunt quality, too. Definately will make again!

This recipe was fantastic. My husband is not a fan of creamy soups, but he LOVED this one so much he literally ate until he was miserable. Sad to say, I did too. I used skim milk to make it slightly healthier and was afraid it would be thin, but the texture was perfect. I did add an extra potato though as I do like thick potato soup. For sure going to have this again and again!

This is excellent!!  This is the first time I've ever made (cheese, potato, bacon soup) and it was super easy and oh so delicious!  I have enough to last me for a week!  The only thing I did differently is I used regular white onions since I didn't have green onions in the house at the time.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was SUPER easy! I recommend boiling peeling, dicing, and boiling the potatoes first. I just like mine a little softer for potato soup.  Also, by all means add salt to the water before boiling potatoes; they are hard to get salty enough after the fact.  Excellent soup! I will make this throughout this winter.

This Recipe is a great start for a great soup and very thick.  I did make a few changes.  I used butter instead of Margerine. I poured off all but a tbsp of the bacon grease to fry the chopped onions.  Also Added 2 tbsp Chicken Base after the Milk. Lastly, I for time saving I microwaved (instead of baking)8 medium Yukon Gold Potatoes.

Fairly simple recipe (appreciated by a beginner like myself) but it was, as others have said - bland.  Also a very HEAVY meal, plan on a good nap after!  I will certainly be making this again, with half as much sour cream and more pepper in hopes of adding a touch more flavor to it :) EDIT- Made this again last night with 1/2 C Sour Cream, 1 Tbsp Onion Powder, 1 Tbsp Salt and 1 Tbsp Pepper - MUCH better :)

As is, it has absolutely no taste. The consistency is fine, but there was no aroma (to me, a sign of no flavor).Needs a lot of pinches of something. :-(

This is a great soup! To make it go farther and reduce the fat content, we substitute one cup milk with 3 cups chicken broth.

excellent!  I used skim milk and atleast 10 cups to the rue amount they gave and it was very thick still.  I did try and smoosh some potatoes with the masher but they just stuck to the bottom.  I used a lot of little potatoes, a measurement by pounds instead of just 4 large potatoes would be nice.

I love this recipe but I feel the key to this is adding everything once you have the milk in. I add a pinch of garlic salt and let it simmer with a lid for an hour or until I feel it's ready! This will give the soup more flavor!

What a wonderful soup!  I added a mix of cheddar and Jack cheese for a little more flavor and it did the trick.  Also, I doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers.  The consistency was perfect and the flavor was great.  I will be making it again and again.

Good recipe for baked potato soup, but it is bland. 
I added a large Maggi chicken boullion cube that I disolved in about 2/3 cups of water, extra salt and pepper and grated some nutmeg into the soup. Next time I will add an additional chicken boullion cube. Very hearty soup on cold days.

Very good!  I had to make a few modifications because of what I had in the house.  I substituted the sour cream with French onion dip and the green onions with onion that I sauted in the bacon grease. It could probably use a little more milk.  It is VERY thick!

Had to put more potatoes in.  More bacon and green onions. Was a bit bland for me.  Maybe put some hot sauce in to give it zip!

i didn't quite have everything (no green onions or cheddar cheese), but it was still really good :) I really liked this and how easy it really was! The hubby, who doesn't really like potato soup, and is SUPER picky even ate some, and asked for more. Thanks so much!

I made this soup last week and it was great.  I added some shredded carott to it and next time I may add a different veggie.  But all in all my family enjoyed it.  Great way to use up left over baked potatoes!

This is a great recipe. It was simple to make.  Make sure you read that the recipe calls for already baked potatoes, because that will add some time to the process.  I did have to add some salt for more flavor, but that really just depends on your taste.

Excellent recipe! I peeled, cubed and boiled the potatoes to save time. Also, I added more green onions-GREAT flavor. Once I mixed the milk, butter and flour in a skillet I threw everything in the crock pot and cooked on low. I was a little worried that the soup was not going to thicken but it did and was very creamy. Next time I will double up since there was nothing left:)

I along with just about every body else, modified this soup a little.  I also used have milk half chicken stock.  I also roasted a head of garlic and put that in the soup, which really added a LOT of flavor.  I also like to leave the skins on my potatoes, makes it seem a little more rustic.  In general, I love this soup!!

I have made this recipe several times and everyone just loves it!!!
I wanted to make it today and didn't have the potatoes so I used a bag of frozen southern hashbrowns(the cubed potatoes) and it came out just as good as any other time I've made it.

Excellent flavor.  A little thicker than I preferred in consistency - reduced flour, added milk to dilute.  Added salt to taste. Will try the ranch packet as suggested by a reviewer.

I use this as a base but change things up quite a bit. I start by slicing potatoes thinly and bring to a boil. While that's working I cook about 10 strips of bacon. I strain the potatoes and return most to the pot and add milk and butter and use imersion blender to smooth. To soup, add sliced carrots and small broccoli florets to add nutients. Once bacon is cooked I add diced brown onions to bacon droppings and saute. In soup I add more milk as necessary, then add shredded chedar cheese, and remaining potato pieces to have chunks of potato in the soup. Add salt, pepper, maybe garlic powder. Serve with minced green onion and chopped bacon and more shredded cheese on top. DELISH!

I followed other suggestions and used a container of chicken broth and the rest milk, cut the butter in half and added some sauteed garlic. I semi mashed some of the potato and left the rest in cubes. This was SO good! Next time I might try a lower fat version but with the promise of -10* tonight this version fits well.

This was really good soup. My only problem was I had to use a little more flour than normal because the soup just wasn't getting thick, but once it did, it got really thick, but I like my potato soup to be thicker so it was just fine in the end :)

Very tasty! I read through the reviews before starting, so I halved the butter and flour for the roux, and I think I'll still need to add a little more milk to it when I reheat the leftovers; it does thicken up well. I didn't bother to peel and cube the potatoes (though unless I'm missing something the prep time is misleading since I don't have pre-baked potatoes around the house so I would add an hour to it), I cut them in half and used a spoon to scoop bits of potato out. I also chopped up the skin of one of the potatoes and threw it in for extra fiber -- the skin's the best part! I didn't find the need to add any extra spices, the bacon, cheese, onion, and sour cream definitely provided enough flavor. Maybe people who thought it was bland were using low-fat versions of some ingredients and that's where the taste was lost.

WOW!  This is hands down the BEST potato soup I have EVER had.  It's thick, it's creamy, it's cheesy.  Stop searching for the perfect potato soup recipe...you've found it!  I didn't change a thing and it was absolutely amazing as-is!!

I made this horribly unhealthy and made the roux using the left over grease from the bacon.  I also added more cheese and sour cream.  Also I did 2 potatoes the way described and roasted 2 potatoes with the skin on in olive oil, Parmesan cheese salt and pepper. Didn't add any additional salt and pepper other than what was on the potatoes.  Yum!  Wouldn't make it all the time but awesome when you are blowing your diet!

My family LOVED this soup. I over baked the potatoes a bit and left the skin on them and it was still very good. Next time i'll take the skin off, I found that I didn't enjoy the skin as much when I ate it.

This is a family favorite.  Easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I always add a little extra cheese because we love a "cheesier" flavor.

I read a lot of the reviews here and many of them said the soup was too thick. I thought it was perfect but maybe that's because I used 1% milk instead of whole milk. I also used reduced fat sour cream because I can't tell the difference between that and regular so I might as well use low fat.   Next time I make this I want to try it with pancetta instead of bacon. I thought 1 tsp. of salt was perfect, but I increased the amount of black pepper to 1 1/2 tsp. I also added 1 tsp. of dried parsley because this herb is so great with potatoes.  I think this soup would lend itself extremely well to many different flavors, ranging from cumin to curry. I think I'm going to try a curried baked potato soup next!

Yummy!!!  This is probably the most unhealthy soup I have ever eaten, but it was sure good. Everyone complimented how this soup tasted better than any soup they have ordered in a restaurant.

I loved this soup! It was relatively easy to make, and my co-workers all loved it! I used turkey bacon instead of regular, and went with the advice of others and didn't put in the butter. I didn't miss it at all either! :D

This was good, a little bland if you dont spice it up. I also think it was a bit much flour, i used less but coudnt tell you how much... im not much for measuring, just throw it in and hope for the best. :)

This was pretty good.  I cut out the butter and flour.  I used 6 large potatoes.  I also used ham instead of bacon only because I didn't have any bacon.  I cut up some sweet onion finely and cooked it with the ham.  Then I cut the potatoes and added the other ingredients.  When it was all mixed well together, I ran it through the food processor and it thickend up nicely.  I added garlic powder and dried chives in the food processor as well.  I folded in the ham and onion and heated it all up.  The texture was perfect.  Very good.

With my changes, this recipe deserved 5 stars! I added chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the melted margarine and cooked for 4 minutes. I also cut the milk and half and used chicken stock. I left some of the skins on the potatoes for added texture. Instead of shredded cheddar cheese, I cut up Velveeta into cubes. To avoid the sour cream from breaking, I added it at the end when the soup cooled down from the simmer. If you feel like the soup is too thin, you can always add instant mashed potato mix. Great soup!

This recipe was a bit bland for my taste. It also seemed like there was too much flour for the roux. The soap was very thick which is fine but I wished it had more flavor. I'm not sure if I will make this again but if I do I will definitely add a ton of spices to it.

This soup is good, but better with the changes that I made.  Like recommended by other viewers, I used only 5 cups milk and 2 cups chicken broth.  I also used 6 potatoes and left the skins on to capture the "true" feel of a baked potato.  I tried the soup as was and agree was very bland.  I used a ranch packet as suggested by another user and it was perfect!  Will definately make again!

my absolute favorite potato soup!!!!!  And everyone i have served it to has loved it too.  It can get a bit thick, but i just add some extra water to thin it to the consistancy I like.  Wonderful recipe.  I will make this again and again!!

I LOVE THIS ONE! This is great because you can add really any meat you like to it and it will be awesome. One short cut for the gravy part is to use white gravy mixes. Thanks for sharing.

My husband, who normally dislikes soups in about any form, asked that I put this on the regular menu! I added more bacon and cheese, as that's what we prefer, but it came out tasting great. It did take a while for it to thicken, and I may add more flour next time, but aside from that, great recipe!

I have tried this recipe twice now. The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe. No one in the house would eat it. It was very bland and the bacon was really mushy. Now after reading some reviews I made some changes. I used 1/2 cup of butter and flour, I used half the amount of pepper (more for personal taste than anything), and I cut back the milk only using 3 cups and adding 3 cups of chicken broth. I also kept the bacon to put on the top instead of cooking with it. With my changes, the soup becomes 5-stars for our family!

This was really good. Tasted as good as from a restaurant. The only change I made was to use 3 1/2 cups of milk and then 3 1/2 cups of chicken stock like the other reviews suggested.

Wonderful! I used 2% milk, light sour cream and light margarine. It turned out great and I will definitely make it again.

Dear sweet lord this is the by far the best soup I have ever made!! I of course did make a few minor adjustments though. I only used about 1/4 cup of butter. I substituted about 1/2 bacon grease that I had left over. I added pre-steamed baby carrots, broccoli and red onion, plus 4 cloves of miced garlic. This was so delicious. My husband said this is the best soup he's ever had!! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! =D

This recipe was fantastic!! So creamy and flavorful! I ended up using 2 cups of 2% milk, 2 cups of potato water (the water I boiled the potatos in) and 3-4 cups of chicken broth. I seasoned the broth with pepper and a cajun seasoning mix but didn't add any more salt b/c the bacon and cheese were salty enough on their own. So delish, can't wait to make it again!!

A very hearty soup - great for the fall!  I modified it a bit, using other reviews for guidance.  I combined 4 tsp cornstarch with 1.5 cups of whole milk in a crockpot.  After baking the potatoes and frying the bacon (only had 5 slices) - I coarsely mashed the potatoes and put all of the crumbled bacon in the soup.  I finely diced 1/3 cup of celery, 1/2 cup of white onion, and one large clove of garlic.  I sauteed the garlic and onion in the bacon grease before adding to the soup.  I added parsley, paprika, salt & pepper to taste - and then finally added 2 cups of skim milk and 1 T of butter.  I set the crockpot on medium and cooked the soup for 3 hours - stirring once in a while.  It turned out great (don't forget to top it with cheddar cheese) -yum!

The best potato soup hands down. I didn't add the bacon into the soup.  We just sprinkled some on top when served.  Also, I used skim milk and 1/2 the sour cream.  Added 3Tbs of ranch seasoning powder.  My whole family was wowed by this recipe.  Thank you for sharing:)

I followed this recipe pretty closely, and WOW, it is good. I used 1% milk, lite sour cream, and turkey bacon in an effort to reduce the fat in this recipe. I was a little wary of some of the negative reviews, but I was very pleased with how this turned out. However I do agree that it was a bit bland, so I seasoned it w/ extra salt, pepper, and garlic salt. But it's still a 5-star recipe, in my opinion. I thought the proportion of "stuff" in the soup was just perfect. And the soup itself has such a smooth, silky texture. I don't need to go looking for another baked potato soup recipe. This is it!

great recipie, and i will use it again. i made this recepie for 100 women this sunday and they loved it so much i got a standing ovation that i was real embarraced about. i didn't cook it with the cheese in it, i let it be an option. i served it in a sourdough bread bowl and i eyeballed the up scale. but it was delicious. i don't recomend the home cook to eyeball the recipie up to 100 because it doesn't always work just by multiplying the numbers.

This was a little too thick for me...I'm going to try subbing in a bit of chicken broth for some of the milk and see if that helps. The flavor was pretty good, though.  UPDATE: I doubled this recipe, but only used 1 cup each of flour and butter. I also subbed about 2 cups of the milk for chicken broth. Also only increased sour cream by 1/2 cup. My family enjoyed the soup even more with these changes!

I had two gallons of milk that was going bad in a few days so I was looking for a recipe to use up milk.    I combined this recipe with some ideas I got from others (used chirizo instead of bacon, added 2 cans of sliced mushrooms) and chopped fresh parsley.    It turned out great, but the consistency with the 7 cups of milk worked out perfect.  I would certainly recommend using this as a base recipe with your own spin.

Looking for a recipe to appease my 9 yr old who wanted Potato Soup.  Googled and this was the first recipe that popped up!  It was amazing!  My son and his friend ate it up!  It's perfect as is - I probably won't change a thing next time!

It was quite bland, but I added some garlic powder and marjoram and that seasoned it up quite nicely. PS - the blandness is probably my own fault because we use fat free everything and soy milk.

Oh, my, this recipe was so good! I just served it at lunch today for my friends, and they all had seconds. I did put just a little more bacon in the recipe than it called for, but otherwise I followed the recipe. And I put the rest of the carton of sour cream and the cheese out on the table for a garnish. My friends raved over it. Next time I will put just a little more milk in it, so it won't be so thick when everybody goes for seconds.  And I will have some onion as garnish, too.  This was as good if not better than  Ruby Tuesday's potato soup.

This is a very good basic recipe. I only gave it 4 stars because the first time I made it it had no flavor at all. The second time I made it I used 4 cups of whole milk and 3 cups of Chicken broth. I added about 4 heaping tsp. of chopped chives and 4 minced garlic cloves. I used 1 2/3 Cups of sour cream. This made it very rich and tasty. Instead of frying bacon I used the Oscar Mayer real bacon pieces that are sold in little pouches in the salad dressing isle. I didn't put any cheese in it at all as we don't care for it in potato soup.

Really good but modified. Add 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups half and half instead of milk. Add spices and seasonings to taste.

This was restaurant quality.  I can't say enough about it!  I used 4 cups whole milk and 3 cups chicken broth, but other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.  I was generous with my salt and pepper, but I tend to under season, so I think I just found the right amount for the soup.  Definitely stir often!!  I was distracted by my daughters in the beginning and almost burned the bottom of the pot!  Delicious!

This recipe is so good! Just all american classic comfort food at it's finest! 

I have made it countless times and it is always a crowd pleaser. I set aside the green onions as a topper only because I am picky but other than that it is wonderful!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was a big hit at thanksgiving dinner.  As other reviewers said, its a little thick and to some, it tasted floury, but if you cook the roux a little bit longer, you will lose that raw flour taste, just make sure you stir all the while to keep it from burning.I also sauted the green onions (tops and scallion part) in the butter rather than dumping them into the soup raw. I added a can of chicken broth when it was done to thin it out.  Was really thick otherwise a terrific tasting soup. Oh, and honestly, I'm thinking of cutting the black pepper in half next time I make it too.  Thought a tsp. was a little much.

After reading all of these great reviews I expected this soup to be a winner.  It is not.  It is the blandest potato soup I have tasted.  So disappointing!

I loved this soup. I let it simmer for an hour more to make the potato cubes that much more mushy since I didn't bake them before hand. I also used 1 cup of ranch dressing instead of the sour cream which still added the tangy flavor but also gave it more zest. I will use this recipe again!

This soup is sooooooo good.  Very easy and very filling.  I added a little extra milk at the end because it was a little thicker than I liked but other than that it was perfect.

I love this recipe.  I DID make a few modifications based on what I read from others.  I cut the butter and the flour by half.  I used only 3 medium sized potatoes.  Otherwise, the soup was too thick for me.  And I do  not put the bacon in the soup.  I use it as a topper for the soup, along with more cheese.  Great!

I used half milk, half chicken broth, and left the bacon on the side (we just crumbled it over the top).  This was a delicious soup that reheats well.  I froze half of it and gave it to my mom.  She raved and asked for the recipe.

I love this recipe as is! I make it for get togethers all the time and it is always a hit! I am not the best cook in the world but I sure feel like it the way people talk about how great my baked potato soup was. I have heard people say "have you tried Christy baked potato soup, it is awesome!" Of course I tell them it is not my secret family recipe!!! Thank you for the great recipe!

Ok, seriously...like this needs another review, right?  Of course it does!  We liked the original recipe a LOT.  However, it is a little thick.  I cut back on the flour to solve that problem.  I also just boil my potatoes until tender to speed this up a little.  Other than that, the flavors are WONDERFUL!

I love this recipe!  I use it about once a month and even my "I don't like soup husband" enjoys it.

I only add about 3-4 cups of milk, and I do not add the flour or margarine.  

Over all it's a very filling soup that is super YuMMy and is sure to be a hit!

Awesome winter recipe! I love to make this with bread bowls. After I scoop out the insides of the bowls, I save it for the next day. After the soup has sit in the refridge for a night, it is a lot thicker, perfect for dipping with the remaining bread! yum!

Couldn't stop eating this soup!  I substituted leftover ham for the bacon and added more salt and pepper for my taste.  I grew frustrated waiting for the soup to thicken, so I threw in the potatoes and onions while the base was still somewhat thin, but the starch from the potatoes seemed to help it thicken faster.  Would definitely make again.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous.  I used butter because that is what I had on hand.  It was a little thin until I turned off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes.  It thickened very nicely.  Everyone loves it.

This was very good but quite time consuming. I made the following changes: I used half chicken broth. I sauteed 2 celery stalks, 1/2 of a yellow onion and 2 garlic cloves in the bacon grease and added the mixture into the potatoes. I added about 4 pinches of nutmeg. I used the green onions and bacon as toppings. Next time I will half the amount of butter and flour the recipe calls for.

My husband and I are big fans but this soup had an odd sweetness to it and was too thick.  We added an extra cup of milk after the fact and lots of black pepper. We won't make this again.

This is a wonderful soup.  I've made this twice.  The only thing I changed the second time was I simmered it for about 5 minutes. It was already thick enough. For leftovers, I just add a little more milk to thin it out.

There are some things you need to know about this recipe.... First.. It an excellent five star potato soup. BUT.. the recipe takes MUCH longer than 40 minutes to prepare.  Just to bake the potatoes before you even get started takes at least 45 min. It says this will make enough for 6 servings... It makes enough to feed 6 people for about 3 days! I added a can of corn and some celery and it was excellent.  It would have been just as good without the extras I put in.  I'll make this often!

This was good. I took the advice of others and used 1/2 the flour and butter and added in onion powder, garlic powder, cayanne pepper and parsley. It is a very versatile recipe. I wanted it to be creamier... Overall, though, still a good recipe and still worth keeping. Thanks.

Even though this is so unhealthy, my family couldn't help but love it.  I get the request to make it alot but there is no way we can have a few times a week.  I sauteed some chicken breasts in olive oil and baked them and then shredded it and also put it into the soup.  It's perfect in the winter and can take a little extra time but it's so worth it.

This is a great recipe, but don't believe you're going to have this thing done in 40 minutes.... even if you already have the potatoes baked!  Depending on what kind of pots you are using (stainless steel, hard anodized, ceramic, etc...) you will most likely have to take your time.  The first time I made this, I used a stainless steel stock pot, and it came out GREAT.  The second time, I was using one of my mothers old ceramic stock pots, and I scorched the milk.  I was very upset about this, but live and learn. 

But with all that aside, this truely is a great recipe, and I really wish I had the time to make it more often.

We made this in a very large quantity to serve at a Girl Scouts Fundraising activity at a local church, this soup was the favorite of the 3 soups we offered for dinner.  Everyone was asking for the recipe, it was published in the church bulletin the following Sunday.

Very good. We had some leftovers in the fridge that became a variation on this recipe. A partially-used can of condensed cream of mushroom soup replaced sour cream. A bit of leftover bbq steak replaced part of the bacon. We kept the skin on the potatoes; it wasn't as pretty, but it tasted fine. We had no green onions, so worchestershire sauce gave it the zing.

This was delicious!  I scaled the recipe for 10 servings (7 people) and there wasn't any left.  I added more shredded cheese and a little more sour cream.  Also used chives in the soup and served with fresh green onions.  Made it the day before and reheated the day I served it.  I will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband said I have now made the perfect potato soup!  The only changes I made were I boiled cut up potatoes in chicken broth and then after 20 minutes added the rest of the ingredients.  I also only used 4 cups of milk.

I love this soup! I like to saute some diced white onions in the bacon grease before adding my flour then cook them together before adding the milk. This adds a little extra flavor to the soup. I have also use half milk and half chicken stock. I have made it both ways and It comes out just as wonderful with the chicken stock.

This is a thick, rich restaurant style soup. I made this for a party and everyone loved it. Makes more than 6 servings, plan on it serving almost twice that many if you have bread and dessert.

This soup was delicious. The only thing I would recommend is to add a little water or stock. My first batch came out thick like gravy, but the flavor was great!! My second time I added some stock and it turned out perfect. I'll definitely keep this recipe.

Wonderful! My family loved this. The key to this recipe is decreasing the amount of flour. Another review reminded me that potatoes are a natural thickner. So I used just 1/4c of flour and a mashed potato to make the roux/base. The consistancy was perfect the next day and no flour taste to overpower the other ingredients!

We LOVE this recipe.  As others stated, it's great on it's own and you really can't ruin it with your own additions to taste.  We didn't find it bland at all, esp with the bacon, in fact we usually leave out the salt.  We also substituted ham for the bacon when we had some leftover from another meal and it was great.  We also like to add a can of corn.  Very good recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing it!

This soup was delicious! I made it nearly a month ago and my family loved it! Now my inlaws are here tomorrow and I have all the ingredients bought and ready to prepare it again. I will definately reduce the amount of flour and maybe add a cup or 2 or milk, it was thick, especially if it sits for any amount of time. I will make it over and over again. THANKS

Excellent soup!  I used about half of the milk in the recipe and used chicken broth for the other half, and about half of the flour and it was perfect. I will definitely make this soup again.

This was delicious, my husband's favorite from all-recipes, so far! Tasted JUST like a baked potato, funny enough:) It was VERY thick, and I added some italian seasoning for kick.  Perfect for a cold day.

Yummy!  This is a great soup, nice for those cold days.  Easy to make and we really liked it.  You can double it and eat it for a couple days.  ***Update - this is the ONLY potato soup recipe I use now.  You can use any meat, in addition to bacon have used ham and even sausage.  My family requests this soup now.

I followed this recipe exactly and I really liked the soup when I first ate it.  However, I think it got too thick over time and my husband did not care for it at all.  Next time I will make it thinner by using more milk.  I thought the flavor was really good though just a little too thick.

This soup has a nice taste, but it is much too thick.  My husband said he would like to use it to retile the bathroom, it was so thick.  
This is definately not a "dipping" soup - don't even bother making grilled cheese sandwiches or bread with it.
Even though the taste was okay, I would definately add more bacon and cheese, and of course - milk to thin it out a little.

This is a great recipe!  I modified it to my family's taste per some of the other reviews and it came out perfect.  It's a definite keeper.

Such comfort food!  It makes a TON so be prepared for leftovers.  I definitely added more cheese, and used up some remaining heavy cream and half-half in my fridge before finishing off the required 7 cups with milk.  I didn't have sour cream, and it still came out wonderful.

This soup is very good.  However, I think if it simmers too long, it loses flavor.  Next time, I will not simmer but I will definitely cook this again.

I give a recipe 5 stars if I add it to things I cook regularly.  This fits the bill.  I use some half and half or heavy cream in place of some of the milk.

This was good just a little bland and slightly too thick for our taste.  I think 1/2 cup of flour would work best for us.  Also, leave the bacon on the side to add per bowl because it was soggy in the leftovers.  I did add some garlic powder.

Very very good. Very rich and thick. I put a little dash of onion ang garlic powder in mine just to give a little extra seasoning. I also used sharp cheddar. My family loved this soup. Highly recommend trying.

This was pretty good. I used Velveeta instead of cheddar. Hubby did not care for all the bacon but I loved all that bacon! It needed a LOT of seasoning up though. I'd make it again, I love how thick it is....you just have to be willing to doctor it up a bit.

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars, because this was VERY good, but it was just a bit flat for our taste preferences.  The second time I made it, I added an 8 ounce container of sour cream and it elevated the flavor a bit more to our liking.

Very good and easy.  Almost as easy as opening a can of soup, but WAY better and not "canned" tasting.  I did not add the bacon to soup, but rather placed the add-ons on top.  I also used my little submersible hand blender to help thicken.  Other tips - use  a bag of frozen hashbrowned potatoes to add more substance, not shredded but the little cubes, and buying pre-cooked bacon pieces cuts down on time and mess.

This is a great recipe! It was very easy to follow and the results were perfect. To save time, I used (3) 14.5ozs of Del Monte's canned Diced New Potatoes. I also added more cheddar cheese. I love sour cream, but I didn't use it in this recipe. Instead of mixing the bacon in the soup, I crumbled it on top when serving in bowls. Some reviewers had problems with the soup being too thick when reheated, but I didn't have any. In fact, it was better the second time around. It's well worth the time and a winner with my family.

Wow, this is delicious! I scaled this down to my leftover 1.5 baked potatoes. I made this for my 16 year old that can eat potato soup even if it is 100 degrees outside. I used 2% milk, bacon bits from the bag and reduced fat sour cream. Thanks for the post. I will make this all winter long I am sure!

This came out sort of bland so I had to add extra salt and some garlic powder. Maybe 1 cup of chicken stock could be added in place of 1 cup of milk because its to "milky". I cut back on the flour and the sour cream so that it wouldnt be so thick. It takes a lot of extra time to prep this meal and its just not worth the fuss in my opinion. It needs 2 cups of cheese and a few more taters. Do not use cheap bacon, yuck. Hubby said it was ok but my kids and I didnt touch it after the 1st taste. Good luck!

When I first seen this recipe I just had to make it.  But like I do once in a while I don't leave myself enough time to prepare something that I want to make.  So instead of using baked potatoes I just chopped some  potatoes up and cooked it just a little longer.  It was the best potato soup I have ever tasted!  The next time I used baked potatoes. My family and I liked them both ways.

This was my first time making soup and it was soooo good!  The flavor in this soup is amazing, I used chives instead of green onions & soy milk instead of regular. Very good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this soup, and so did my 3 year old son that doesn't like a lot of things. My grandmother just had to have the recipe, and I have to agree that it does taste even better reheated.

Fabulous!!!  I had to add this to my recipe box.  This is extremely easy and tasty too.  A big hit with my son who compliments me each time I make it.  My husband is hard to please but he liked this.  Leftovers are as tasty if not better and my friends found it very satisfying, tasty and warming on the cold day after a (dog) show.  
The first time I made it I excluded the onions and used more cheese.  Today when I made it I added 1/2 of onions so it wouldn't overwhelm the flavor we first experienced.
Still taste great but I think I will totally omit the onions from now on.
To lighten up this dish I used non-fat milk, low-fat sour cream, Kraft free fat-free cheese, low fat/low calorie margarine... still very yummy and a bit less guilt.  *g*

O'Charley's baked potato soup--look out!!  This was delicious.  My husband went to work raving about it and I had to send the recipe over.  I did follow suggestions and decreased the flour and butter to 1/2 cup each and sauteed 1 chopped yellow onion in the butter.  Thanks so much-I'll be making this alot!!

I made this for my family last night and they just ate it up!  This is a nice hearty & thick soup.  I reduced the butter and flour to 1/2 cup each and kept the milk at 7 cups and it was still thick.  I cut up and boiled the potatoes until just tender instead of baking them.  I didn't add the green onions, cheese, sour cream and bacon to the soup while cooking but added them in the individual bowls.  It makes for a nice presentation adding a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling the green onions, cheese and bacon on top.  I thought the bacon might get soft in the soup.  I did add more salt than the recipe called for...maybe because I used unsalted butter.  I will definitely make this comforting soup again!!

Tasty, but a bit heavy for our taste.  A good use for an abundance of leftover potatoes, though.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would it was absolutely amazing.  I did adjust the recipe slightly based on others reviews.  I changed the roux to 1/2 cup fl & 1/2 cup butter.  I also used 13 potatoes, yes this was alot of potatoes BUT it gave the soup great texture.  I also omitted the onions but used onion powder instead, my husband doesn't like onions. This is a recipe you can not walk away and allow to cook on its own, it can ruin very quickly if left unattended. This is definately a keeper, restaurant quality.  Thanks Sherry!!!!

This is ok for what it is.  I would have much preferred a baked potato with all the toppings.  A lot of work for soup.  Leftovers were thrown out.  I don't think I'll make this again.  Not what I was looking for.

Wonderful hearty soup.  Had to add approx 2 extra cups of milk it was so thick.  And now that it has sat for 3/4 hour, i find i will have to add another cup or two when i heat it up tomorrow.  My modifications:  I used butter for the roux and added 1 large chopped up onion to soften before adding the flour.  Also, stirred and cooked the roux for 5 minutes before adding the milk.  At this point i added 1 tsp salt and the pepper. I used 9 medium potatoes, and 6 green onions.  And I added 4 cups of shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese.  I checked the seasonings before serving, and had to add some more salt.  My husband, who does not like soup, had 3 bowls, and said it was worthy of being served at the finest restaurant!!!  lol

Very good!  I have tried other baked potato soup recipes & this is by far the best!  I didn't add the green onions, because I don't like them, so instead I added a little onion powder & garlic powder to the butter in the pan.  The only other change I made was to use Hormels Real Crumbled Bacon, per suggestion earlier.  It worked wonderfully.  One 4.3 oz. pkg was enough for the entire batch & there was no greasy mess to clean up.

Excellent. I made this just as the recipe said, with the addition of 2 cloves garlic, minced. I put my onion and garlic in with the melted butter, then stirred in the flour etc. I wanted to give the onion and garlic a minute or so to cook before adding it to the soup. I also added a few splashes of hot sauce, not to make it spicy, but to make it a little less bland. Loved the recipe and will make it all the time. My husband loved it as well and he isn't normally a soup type of person. Served it with crusty french bread and it made a great meal. Thanks!

I made this soup last night - I substituted about 12 small red potatoes for the 4 large ones. I also boiled the potatoes because I'm too impatient to wait on baked ones! It all worked beautifully and my friends and I enjoyed the soup greatly! I served it with fresh bread which was great for dipping! The only change I will make in the future is adding more cheese because I love cheese so much.

I have had this recipe in my box for awhile & have made it many times. This review is long overdue. I get a lot of 5 star recipes off of this site & this is my favorite recipe of all time!! I never change anything. In the past, I have been known as the daughter who can't cook. I made this for my family in Mississippi on a visit & the next time I came down my mother had all the ingredients ready for me to make her more. This recipe makes a lot & is very hearty! It makes for a great winter meal although, I'll be cooking it all year round! Thanks!!

Previous reviewers have said that this recipe is a little bland... I agree.  Here's what I did to make it BURST with flavor!!!

I didn't want it too thick, so I cut the butter and flour in half and it is very creamy, but not thick and gooey.  Instead of regular potatoes I used the Resers pre-cut, pre-cooked Rosemary & Roasted Garlic Diced Redskin Potatoes (two packages). I added a teaspoon (or so) of diced garlic to the butter. Added a few teaspoons of chives, used 8 green onions instead of four, and added one can of chicken broth.  Also used a few dashes of onion powder, but it's not necessary.  Also used 16 slices of bacon.  Absolutely yummy!!!
I think if you skipped all the changes except for the pre-cooked, pre-cut Rosemary Garlic potatoes it would still be fantastic.  They just add the extra punch of flavor.  Great basic recipe, but it does need a few extra touches. Thanks!

Wow! This soup is unbelievable. My 16 yr. old son wasn't crazy about trying it but wound up eating 2 huge bowls of it. I did add 2 ck. boullion cubes and a some minced garlic because it needed a little kick. This one is well worth the effort!

MMM, great cold weather soup. I did change mine up a bit to taste, though. I added three cloves of minced garlic and omitted the onions, and it turned out beautifully. I didnt think soup would be this easy and rewarding.

I love potatoes and bacon - so I really thought this recipe couldn't be bad. I was wrong!! I seem to be going against the grain, but this turned out floury, too thick and had little flavor! I wound up wasting all of those good ingredients.

All I added was more salt.  Other than that this recipe was wonderful!! I had been looking for a recipe like the soup served at Outback because it's my favorite, so I was so happy when I tasted the final result. YUMM!  Good work!

Very Good!! I added more salt, pepper, and a little touch of garlic (of course each person is different in taste.) Also had each person add more cheese to their individual bowl if wanted. Even better the next day warmed up! (I personally liked it MUCH better the next day.)

I can't believe how creamy this soup was, especially since I used skim milk (all I had) and low fat sour cream. I'll definitely make this one again.

Better than any other potato soup I have ever tried.  Thanks for sharing such an easy and great tasting recipe.  This recipe will be used more for those cold winter days ahead of us.  Thanks for sharing it.

This soup is AWESOME!! A friend of mine showed me this recipe because she was making it for dinner, so I decided to try it also!!  My boyfriend loved it too and he is not even a potato soup fan!  I am recommending this to all of my friends and will definitely make it again!  A great comfort food that is for sure!!

Oh, my goodness, is this recipe ever delicious!! Instead of bacon, I used celery, and I ignored the measurements for celery, green onions, and potatoes and just put in the amount I wanted in it. I also didn't add any cheese. It turned out soooo good! I am definitely making this time and time again, and even my parents love it!

I thought this potato soup was so thick that it took away from the flavor.  I had guest over and they loved it, but I personally thought it was kind of bland.  I ate at Outback Steackhouse the night before and loved their Baked Potato Soup, so I decided to find a recipe.  I think I was just looking too mcu h into it.

This soup was awesome!!  It tastes even better than my favorite restaurants version.  Very filling though and it makes quite a lot - a lot of work for only one bowl (lots of leftovers though).

I added garlic powder to taste and a dash of worcestershire sauce and cut the amount of sour cream in half. It was wonderful, very thick and rich. My family loved it!

I agree that this soup is very bland.  The first day it was horrible however by the second day it had more taste to it. Once it sits for awhile it is better. I am unsure whether I will make this again!!

As everyone says, "this soup is awesome".   Made it for thanksgiving.   My 90 y/o grandmother was licking the bottom of the bowl.   I did follow a few suggestions from other reviewers: 1) I made it the night before.  Personally, I couldn't taste the difference, but it does make it easier to have it already pre-made. 2) I added onion powder and garlic powder to season 3) I sauteed a large minced yellow onion in the bacon grease and 4) I served it with a dollop of sourcream and garnished it with crumbled bacon and minced chives.

Very rich and tasty.  A good solution to all those left over baked potatoes.  I thought it used way too much bacon though.  I'd probably half the amount when I do it again.

what a fantastic tasting soup!!
I used 1/2 cup of bacon bits and just a little more salt and this tasted wonderful.
This is great comfort food for the winter months.
I will be making this from time to time.

I think the baked potatoes gave the soup a funny flavor- they really tasted like potato skin eventhough I took the skin off.  I think next time I will just boil the potatoes in some chicken broth and then add the milk to make up the remaining liquid.  Also, I will add more scallions, salt, and pepper, as it was a little bland.

Not sure maybe I did something wrong- but this was really really bland for my tastes- however I will make again but will add more cheese, some garlic, etc. And will top with sour cream instead of stirring it in.

This soup was very good!  We followed the directions except using a lot less butter and some constarch to thicken and vegetarian bacon bits instead of the real thing.  We will make this again!

Addicting and De-licous!  I have made this recipe for birthday parties, on cold winter evenings and just because I had a hankering for some.  It makes a wonderfully hardy meal and has received great reviews from my family and friends.

I have made this a few times and it's been a huge hit everytime. I made it once for a party and for family dinners and always get raves on it. A great cold day meal that sticks to your ribs.

This soup was not that good, really bland, even with added salt.  Just didn't taste that good, I wouldn't make this again.

I thought this recipe was wonderful, but my husband didn't really care for it much, and he loves potato soup. My brother in law loved it so much, he took all the leftovers home and insisted on having the recipe!  I did omit the sour cream and some of the flour, and added extra cheese, and it was very good, and very thick.  I served it with grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches and had a great meal--well at least my brother in law and I did, but what does hubby know?????

Everyone was right! This is the best baked potato soup I have ever had! I cut the recipe in half (just me and my hubby) and it was plenty--even had leftovers--which reheat nicely. It is so thick, all you need is some garlic bread and a salad. This is now the only baked potato soup I will make! Thanks for sharing.

ABSOULTELY FABULOUS!  I didn't want to mess with cooking bacon, so I bought a jar of Hormel's Bacon Bits (they are REAL, not chips!) and used that.  It made it much easier to make and a lot less mess.  I bought small rounds of french bread and scooped them out and served the soup in them.  I added the scooped bread to the side of the plates for dipping.  It is REALLY wonderful and it tastes like you worked on it for hours days!

This is a very thick and delicious soup. I made it last night and is great leftover. It does take some time to make, but isn't hard. The only bad thing about this soup is that you shouldn't even think about eating it if you are watching your weight or your cholesterol. For this reason, I'll only make it on special occasions.

Yummy soup on a cold winter day.  I had to stir constantly to keep the bottom from burning, but it was worth it in the end.  Will make again!

I made this soup for a party I had.  I made it the night before and then warmed it in a slow cooker.  I never even got to try it!!  It was gone very quickly.  EVERYONE loved it!  I have had many requests to make it again and I can't wait to try it for myself!

I just made this last night- had everything here,It was GREAT! I made it because I was bored,my boyfriend is not big on soup, he loved it!Said this was better than any potato soup he has ever had! I did add a ffew more potato's alot of yellow onions,salt and pepper to taste also had bacon and green onions cut up but did not mix in soup,waited til we put soup in bowls than added what we wanted. I cannot wait til my neighbors try it-or my daughter she cannot cook but this will be easy for her to try on her new husband,he will go into schock-just to good, it seem like you put alot more work into it-my kind of COOKING!!!!!!!!!!!

I microwave the baked potatoes wrapped in plastic wrap.  I also add some garlic and more salt.  Sometimes I use One can of Evaporated Milk and the rest skim milk so it will thicken up better and faster.

Tastes just like Houston's baked potato soup.  I was really surprised when I took the first bite and realized how good it was.  I think next time I will put in half the sour cream.  I like sour cream but DH doesn't, but he liked the soup.  It was really delicious and filling.  I made this soup to eat with sandwiches, and we did not need the sandwiches.  The soup is a meal in itself.  Leftover soup was all gone the next day.  My whole family - even kids - loved it.

I had to modify this. Ya’ll need to season your  soup! I doubled the cheese to nearly 3c. And upped the salt to about 2.5-3tsp. No regrets. I added a little onion powder and a splash of Worchestershire sauce.

We read the reviews so we added additional flavor by adding some celery and carrots to the onions. We also sauted in the bacon grease to add additional flavor, and added garlic. I liked the thickness of the soup, used 1% milk and doubled the cheese. My husband ate all the leftovers the second day.

So delicious! Do as the other reviews say. Use less flour and margarine. Add chicken broth to help with thickness. Use onion and garlic powder for better flavor!

I baked my potatoes so I didn’t have to over cook the other veggies. I didn’t purée, used potato flakes toward the end to get that consistency. I added the bacon when it was mostly done. It needed lots more seasoning, more tarragon, garlic, salt and pepper.

This soup was very creamy, rich, and very filling, GREAT comfort food! Not exactly "figure friendly"  but everything in moderation, right? :>)  There's a bit of prep work involved but once that's taken care of this comes together fairly quickly, I will definitely make again. I would give this 5 stars for taste but because of the prep work involved I'm giving this 4 stars. Definitely make it you won't be disappointed.

I used 2 cups of milk and 4 cups of chicken stock. I halved the butter and flour for the roux and added finely chopped onions to the roux to add flavor. I made sure to let the roux cook and even brown a little for added flavor. It is a delicious soup.

Very delicious and I followed the recipe exactly. Our guests loved it too. Next time I make it, I will take other reviewers recommendations and thin it with some chicken broth - it's very thick.

Delicious soup, my kids love it! Here are my changes for a thinner base and fewer calories version: 1) add 3 - 4 cups broth to milk mixture, 2) omit sour cream, cheese and bacon from soup 3) add bacon and cheese as garnish only, plenty of flavor with smaller portions of fat ingredients.

This soup is absolutely delicious. I read reviews first and made a few adjustments. Added a full tablespoon of minced garlic, reduced the milk to 5 cups and used 3 cups of chicken broth. I also added a couple chopped raw potatoes and thick bacon just for a little more chunkiness. I will make this again for sure. Thank you.

Like others, I modified this.  1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup flour, 9 cups of milk.  Left the skin on my potatoes and then took a fork to the cubes and chunky mash them.  Added 1t. of onion powder, and 2 t. of Tony Chachere's.  Cubed up about 1/2 Cup of cooked ham.  Results were 5 star!

Delicious! Next time I will cook the potatoes a little longer so they’re softer, add more salt and pepper, and add 2 cups of chicken broth to thin it out.

I got ahead of myself and just tossed everything in a bowl, but once I put everything where it went it went rather swimmingly. It tastes amazing and I will definitely be making it again.

I utilized this recipe and made just a couple of tweeks for presentation.   Reserve some of the sour cream,  onions and bacon for toppings....this was  so delicious!

I didn't have any leftover baked potatoes, so I sliced up some red potatoes and boiled them.  Then I let the potato slices  cool and then cubed them for the soup.  This is the BEST soup on a cold snowy day!

Doubled the recipe.  I added a chopped onion to the butter before making the roux with flour, salt & pepper.  At the end, I felt it needed more flavor, so added about a tablespoon of roasted chicken  “bullion”.  Yummy! Next time I plan to include diced celery as well.

It was amazing!  A little thick for our taste so will add more chicken stock next time.  We used sharp cheddar cheese.  Just our preference but followed otherwise exactly as written.  YUM!

I am from true DownEast Maine.  I have been making milk based chowdahs for over 42 years....learned by over 120 years or more of wisdom from my grandmother and mother who were also born in the same region that Bar Harbor/ New England clam chowder came from.   I searched to see other ways of making it to try something different for a change and tried this.  It is VERY bland.  The roux is gloppy and reminiscent of quick chowders made by cheap restaurants or canned.  Roux is not needed, use your potatoes as a thickener by mashing some and keeping the remainder in larger chunks.  You will need more potatoes but worth it.  I have never used sour cream in a chowder before and do like that addition for this. This also needs more seasoning....?celery/onion/garlic?   
My husband and I are huge foodies and appreciate other ways  of doing things along with all cultures of foods.  I typically only review when something is good...but had to review this based on the large number of positive reviews.

I wanted to love this soup so badly but after following the instructions exactly it became WAY too thick. I'm a lover of all things white rich and creamy but this was too much flour. I've made roux before so I should have listened to my gut feeling but didn't. I'd say use less than half. Other than that this recipe is awesome. Note: If you are trying to add more flavor go easy with the garlic, it will start to resemble Alfredo big nope!

This soup is wonderful.  My family and I really enjoy the loaded baked potato soup at chili's,  and have been casually looking for a similar recipe for several years. I think this is the one. We have made it twice now and it's delicious!

I never follow recipes, but this is an easy recipe. I used heavy cream along with the milk and threw some sweet onion in the bacon grease to sauté for a few minutes and threw that in too. I could eat this soup for days on end.

Used 5 cups of 1% milk, 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth; a little less than 1/2 c of Hormel real bacon bits in lieu of bacon. Lite sour cream, 2% light cheddar. Used a little less flour too. Chopped two green onions instead of four. Excellent soup especially for St Patrick's Day!

This soup is super hearty and decadent just like I like it. Next time I will add more milk (1-2 cups) for a thinner soup consistency. Other than that the recipe is perfect!

It was delicious.  I did add a little chicken bullion, some garlic powder and some dried parsley. Yes, I would definitely make it again. Just know, it is a very thick and very filling soup.

The taste was good but mine turned out like thick curdled milk. I won’t be making it again just because of the texture.

Notes:
* I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth (with 1t salt) and used that for half of my liquid, then slowly added this liquid to the roux. I added to this three cups of 1% milk.
* Roux was 1/4 each of butter and flour. This was plenty.
* I added the onions and one clove of garlic to the butter before adding flour
* Cheese and sour cream amounts (used light sour cream) were perfect.
* I had red potatoes on hand and used eight.

A great base to start from... I’ve only made it once and kept to the base recipe fairly close.  I didn’t have green onions but had dried chives and onions from Penzey’s to add.  I also added their Arizona and Adobo seasonings... about a teaspoon of each right after adding the potatoes.  Also, I left out the sour cream and cheese to leave that as optional upon serving.  A great way to use leftover baked potatoes!! I doubt I will ever shy away from fixing a few extra when we have cookouts or potato bar nights!

Excellent soup. My new favorite recipe! It is very similar to the baked potato soup at 54th street Pub & Grill. I didn't have any green onion, so I subbed a tablespoon of dehydrated onion flake. Worked great for me.

Great recipe! 
If you like a more chunky soup cut your potatoes bigger or smaller for more of a creamier soup.

Made a couple of changes. Used about 1-1/2 cups of heavy cream and 6 cups milk, no sour cream was used. Added a cup of carrots and 2 cups of brocolli.  Delicious!

I always read the reviews and then make the recipe with others’ suggestions.  So...I didn’t make a roux at all.  It was not necessary.  I sautéed half of a chopped onion and garlic in 4T butter in a Dutch oven pan.  I then poured the peeled and diced diced potatoes in the pan with the onion.   I substituted and used half milk and half chicken broth (not stock) and poured over potatoes.  I then added teaspoon of Tony Cacheres creole seasoned salt .  After simmering until potatoes were tender, I used a hand held potato masher until the  consistency came out perfect!  I  saved the bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and added at our bowls. It wasn’t too thick or too runny...just too delicious!

This recipe is very good.  Several of the reviews said it was bland so I made just a few changes.

I used 5 cups of milk and 2 cans of chicken broth and a half cup of flour.  It won't thicken a lot so I put my potatoes and onions in along with a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of celery seed.  I also doubled the salt and pepper.  I put all of this in as I boiled my potatoes so that the seasons could meld.

At the end, I put mashed potato flakes in to thicken.  My 19 year old asks for this when he is home!

I have made this several times now, and each time it is as wonderful as the last. Talk about comfort food! The only modification I make is that my daughters don't eat bacon, so I make it without it, and when everything else is added, I split the pot in two, add (6 crumbled slices of) bacon and let it rest for a bit so the flavor infuses. For those who love the bacon, it's best to do it in the order it's written, but for anyone in a similar predicament to mine, this is a viable option. Thanks, Sherry Haupt, for the tasty recipe!!

My family loved it! 
I did use up leftover half & half in place of some of the milk. I added a can of mushroom soup and left half of the potato skins on. I increased the amount of potatoes to use up my stock and added garlic salt, dried garlic and cayenne pepper. I reduced butter and flour to half of what was called for.
I made the changes to try out some of the suggestions in the comments.

To adjust for my family and their love of cheese, I used 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and added 1 to 1 1/2 extra cups of milk to thin it down after adding the cheese. Everyone loved it!!

I used 4T of bacon grease in place of same amount of butter for the rue.  Heeded others advice and added mix of chicken broth and milk.  Kept the skins on the potatoes.  Used my dutch oven - love cooking in it! Will definitely make again!

I agree with the other reviews. Sauté a yellow onion & two cloves of garlic in 2 TBSP of the bacon fat & set aside to later incorporate into the broth. I also replaced 3 cups of the milk with chicken broth and didn't mash the potatoes. I simply cubed them & let them do their thing. 
All of this gave the soup a ton of flavor and my family really liked it. We will be making it again!

This was a delicious soup. I used one cup less milk because I like a thick soup. I also used less bacon (half the amount) because I didn't want to use up all my bacon. Lastly, use BUTTER! Flavor will be much better for sure (because everything is better with butter) Flavor was NOT lacking and was extremely delicious. I am not sure how anyone could say this had a flour flavor, it's a cream based soup, it shouldn't taste like flour. Saving this to my favorites!

Great recipe to follow tho I added some Foster’s Australian Lager to it. I’d say about 1/2 cup give or take. It adds that extra level of flavor.

Try using sausage instead of bacon.

It needs more seasoning and to be simmered longer. I added extra cheese & garlic/onion seasoning. It then was really good.

So tasty and not too labor intensive. I added one fresh shallot (diced) which gave it full bodied flavor, in my opinion. My family devoured it!

Good soup, it was better the longer it sat, if that makes sense.  I did follow some others and sauteed 1/2 of a large diced onion and some garlic in the bacon fat and did not use the butter.  I would use a little less flour next time, as I ended up adding a lot of chicken broth or else it would be like pudding. But tasty, added cheese and scallions as garnish to the top.

(Stir COLD milk into the sour cream before adding it to the soup to prevent curdling. )

I sautéed some onions in a combination of melted bacon fat and butter (to equal about 1/2 cup fat) and added 1/2 cup flour and used 3 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  Everything else the same.  It was absolutely delicious.

This was a hit.  I did lower the to 4 stars because I modified based on other reviewers' recommendations.  I cooked the bacon in my dutch oven.  I then got rid of most of the grease but left some for flavor.  I added olive oil, half a stick of butter and half a diced onion.    I used a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits.  I also substituted 2 cups of milk with a can of low sodium chicken broth and only used 1 tablespoon of flour.  I was worried that it was not thickening up but once I added the cheese and sour cream at the end, it was just right.  Thank you for a yummy, comforting soup!

Really the only thing I didn't like was the bacon. Whether it was my fault due to not cooking long enough, or perhaps the bacon pieces were too wide or just the result of being put into a soup, the bacon turned very stringy and chewy and didn't really add anything to the soup except for a disgusting texture that ruined my appetite.
If I remade this, I'd have to look at alternatives for the bacon flavor that I'm accustomed to with this kind of soup.

My entire family loved this soup, saying it was the best potato soup they have ever had.  I made a double batch and had it again two days later and it tasted even better.  My son has requested that I make this on a regular basis.

Perfect fall soup. This was one of the best soups I've made; with the following adjustments.

May I suggest:

Peel and dice potatoes; boil until tender. Drain. 
Sautée one diced yellow onion in melted butter.
Use 6 cups of chicken broth after flour.
Bring to boil.
Add bacon, potatoes. Heat.
Add 1 cup half and half, sour cream, cheese. Heat but do not boil.

This soup is EXACTLY what I was looking for! The taste, texture, everything. I love potato soup but have only made it once in my life years ago and it left a little to be desired. Last night, I went to a ladies night where we all brought different soups to share and I found this recipe. It was easy to make and it was a hit at the gathering! I didn't have time to bake the potatoes in the oven, so I microwaved them and it was still delicious. My kids got a sample taste and begged for more. I highly recommend this recipe!

My family loves this recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.  Like others I did make a few small changes.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I only used 1/4 cup of flour.  I used low fat sour cream (with hopes of making it a little healthier).  I also changed the green onions to onion flakes for my little girl.  (She won't eat green onions.)  Oh and I added extra potatoes.  The soup was thick and creamy and so good!

This was a great start! I LOVED the thickness & used a GF flour blend.I added a splash of white cooking wine, a tsp Tony Chachere’s original creole seasoning, & a tsp garlic powder. My husband got multiple helpings, 1yo & 4yo both ate it well. Husband said to keep this in mind to take to people for compassion meals.

Delicious! We like celery in ours so I added some. Many reviews said it was a bit thick and under seasoned so I added chicken stock to thin it down (as it thickens as it sits) and garlic salt but that is only a personal preference!

The best potato soup ever. I didn't have baked potatoes left over so I boiled some potatoes 2 hours prior to start cooking and let them set to get starchy, but worked just fine

Great recipe. I only had 4 cups of milk so I substituted chicken broth for the other 3 cups after I made the roux.. I also used a hand blender to make it smoother. Very delicious!

Quick & easy when you have left over potatoes.  We like extra sharp cheddar so that's what I used and that may help those that thought it was bland.

This is my go-to comfort soup. Sometimes, to cut down on complexity, I just add bacon bits rather than make a mess cooking the bacon. Otherwise I generally follow the recipe as written. It is a very thick soup, and given the starchy nature of potatoes you really don't need to do a roux if you wanted to cut calories.

I liked mashed potatoes, but never eat baked potato. We had several leftover baked potatoes after a family dinner, so I made this, using onion powder since I didn’t have any onions handy. My family loved it. I smooshed my potato bits up to make it more ‘mashed’ for myself, and even though I’m so-so about potatoes and not a fan of soup in general, I actually enjoyed this, too. I’ll make it again for sure...it was a great winter dinner!

I really liked the texture and taste of this soup. I used the ingredients as listed except for the sour cream, hubby does not like it. There was some adjustment of liquid amount so I could get the consistency I like.  That should be expected for almost any soup, start with a little less liquid and add extra until you are happy with the finished product. The same thing goes for the salt, add a lesser amount first, cook and taste, add more and taste until you are happy.I used a hand masher to get a potato chunk I found pleasing. 

I cut the recipe in half and I am glad I did. Hubby and I had a large bowl each and there was still 2 large servings left. But, it will be gone by tomorrow!

Make sure to cook the potatoes ahead of time. I personally don’t think it’s clear in the instructions but I knew the cooking time on the recipe couldn’t possible be enough to cook the potatoes. I did add seasoning to our liking; garlic power, onion salt, dried parsley, dried basil, salt & pepper. I’d add cayenne pepper for a little heat as well if I didn’t have picky kids eating it. I added an extra 2 cups of milk and it was still plenty thick. Overall I think the recipe is a good base and just needs slight modifications for personal preference.

THE BEST if rue is done correctly!  I’ve made this twice and found that substiting 7 cups of milk with 2 cans of Evaporated Milk and 2 -1/2 cups milk is better tasting...I also did 1 TBSP of salt and pepper rather then the recommendation...seemed like it needed a bit more.  Beautiful to this was a hit with the kids and mixing in the cheese, sour cream, onions and bacon was also awesome!

This is a great potatoe soup!!  So yummy.  I made this on a snowy day (great day for soup)!  I made with red potatoes because I did not have any Russet or Yukon.  I also sautéed my green onions in bacon grease first - and added the onions and bacon grease to the soup.  My only regret is I didn’t double the recipe.  4 of us (2 are hungry guys) and it is almost gone already!

Made this exactly according to directions, seems the only way to make a recipe for the first time.  It's a nice average tasting soup soup.  I rated it average--a little dull.  My husband would have given it 4-5 stars but he likes dull things a lot (he married me).  I like really thick, rich soups and this one was that. Just very light on flavor.

Make it a day ahead. Taste so much better! Also, I took someone else’s idea and cut the flour and butter to 1/2c instead of 2/3 and used reduced or fat free on everything to save some calories.

I made this for dinner last night and my only regret is that I didn't double the recipe. I read some reviews where people said it had a flour taste or it was too much milk but I measured everything according to the recipe and it was absolutely amazing! This will be the only way I make potato soup from now on.

I substituted 3 cups almond milk and 4 cups chicken broth for the milk. Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and a package of real bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon. The substitutions work for the FODMAP diet I try to follow. My hubby liked it even more than when I followed the original recipe. Will definitely keep it in my favorites!

This  was absolutely amazing! I used the advice of others and made the following adjustments: 6 cups of  2% milk, 3 cups of chicken stock, a sprinkle of garlic powder and 1/4 packet of Ranch seasoning. I also used only 1/2 butter and 1/2 c. flour. I realize that that is pretty much a different recipe which is why I did not give it 5 stars and do not want to sway anyone when I didn't actually cook what was presented, however, the soup ended up being a 5 star!

We used turkey bacon because we prefer it, the whole bag of cheese (2 cups), and a lot of garlic salt. And I actually had to puree it because my husband is having problems with his teeth. Still delicious! Very thick and hearty. We loved it. He was so excited to eat something besides applesauce or yogurt.

I make this for the marching band kids at competitions. I don't add the cheese, sour cream, & bacon until it is served. I let the kids add the toppings to their bowl. They love it!

My hubby is a meat-and-potatoes guy so I turned this into STEAK and baked potato soup! Just cook 2 ribeye steaks and slice them into the soup. I modified this recipe a little by adding some chicken stock for extra flavor and seasoning to suit our taste. Hearty!!

This is a good baseline recipe for a baked potato soup, but you should never follow a recipe exactly.

I don't use a roux as suggested, instead I just use whole milk as I don't think flour has a place in this soup.

Chives are also missing from this, as every baked potato should have on it. 

White onions can also be added at the beginning as it's a soup after all.

As a college student this is cheap and good. I used about double potatoes cubed and a whole onion plus spicy sausage and salt put the cheese in the bowl when serving omitted the sour cream and bacon.

My go-to recipe for baked potato soup and always a huge hit at winter holidays. I sautee an onion and a tablespoon or so of minced garlic  to the butter before the flour. Adds an extra savory layer to the rich soup.

It was a little bland, so I made sure to add extra seasoning.  I can't complain with the way it turned out though, my family really enjoyed it. My husband took the leftovers to work & fed 2 other soldiers & both of them really liked it as well.

I loved this soup. I did follow the suggestions of others. I added 2 tsp chicken powder, 6 slices of bacon but included the bacon fat in exchange for some of the butter. My potatoes were boiled, and a little too much, so some of it dissolved into the soup, which was perfect. I didn't have any sour cream on hand, but turned out great without it.  Wonderful recipe.

After reading the reviews (thank you everyone!), I decided to cut the butter and flour in half and saute 1 small chopped onion and 2 cloves garlic into the butter for the roux.  I also used 3 cups chicken broth and 4 cups milk. 
It was PERFECT!! So DELICIOUS! 
The consistency was smooth and creamy, and the flavor was on point. All five of my kids gobbled this up- including the picky eaters!
This recipe (with the changes) is definitely going down in the family cookbook.

I love the versatility with this recipe - you can add chicken, some spices, or a little blue cheese!  It's a perfect recipe for an easy meal after a busy day!  We usually pair it with Hawaiian rolls and set it up like a small baked potato bar to let everyone pick their toppings.  Using real bacon is obviously the best choice, but in a pinch, topping it with bacon bits is also tasty - just don't mix it into the pot (it will turn the soup pink).  It's also super filling as a meal, but so good you'll gorge and eat more than your fair share.

Made it according to exact receipe. Very bland. Very thick. Cooked roué for 4 min and result was it still tasted like raw flour. Very disappointed. Next time will reduce flour and butter to 1/2 cup each. Add onion and garlic powder to roué as well as 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Right now it's headed for the trash. Very disappointed it received such a high rating!

I added a lot of seasoning which made this a very tasty soup, can't say it would've been as good written. I used 4 cups of broth and the rest milk, added a sprinkling of garlic powder and onion powder. Instead of the margarine I used the leftover bacon grease for the roux. Used a potato smasher for the baked potatoes, next time I would try cubing most of them. each person added the sour cream to their own bowl instead of me mixing it in the whole thing.

Amazing soup! My husband and I couldn't stop eating it. Haha! I also did some changes though. 6 brown potatoes, 4 cups of milk, cooked two garlic cloves and  a small yellow onion in the bacon grease, and used a little less than 1/3 cup of flour, and 1/3 cup of margarine. I also used about 3/4 teaspoon of pepper.

Love, love, love this recipe!! I'm not a fan of onions, so I leave them out, and it is still super tasty (I use a bit of onion powder instead). Also, if you're a bacon lover like myself, you might want to use a few more slices.

Great base recipe however I  cut the butter and flour in half. There's enough starch from the potatoes to thicken this soup. I also reduced the milk to 3 cups and used 3 cups of Swanson light sodium chicken broth instead
 I also generously seasoned my cut potatoes with white pepper, garlic powder, Himalayan pink salt  and tyme before adding it to the simmering roux and milk. I love color and texture so I also sautéed 3 chopped medium sized carrots with minced garlic and chopped onion until it browned slightly then added it to the pot on top of the potatoes along with the green onion in the recipe. I received many compliments and it turned out absolutely delicious.

Very good.  If you don't have any leftover baked potatoes, you can use uncooked, and make this in the slow cooker.  I tend to make it that way if I have bacon left over from breakfast.

Delicious! I like sautéd onions in my soup and it's important to be sure your roux is cooked and brown. This soup is a hit and can be improvised upon pretty easily.

I followed the directions exactly and the soup turned out great! Since my first review I've made this soup 6 times and all 6 times got rave reviews. I have discovered that you do not have to take a lot of time whisking the milk into the roux. The soup will naturally thicken, if that makes sense.  I made a version where I added an extra 4 cups of shredded extra sharp  cheddar.  It was excellent.

I feel like I made a lot of changes, but I love the way the soup turned out!  Because some said that the soup was too thick, I used only half the flour in the roue.  I used 1/3 chicken stock and 2/3 1% milk.  I don't like cheese soup so I left that out but put some cheese on top in my bowl. I used thick-sliced bacon so I used half the amount called for.   I also added garlic salt and no other salt  or pepper.  It turned out just the right consistency.

My husband has me make this quite often, and he is a picky eater. I don't change a thing except to use 2% milk instead of whole milk. This is very tasty!

My wife and I loved it. I used sharp cheddar, added a heaping 1/4 tsp of Cayenne and about 1 1/2 cups of frozen mixed veggies.  Most Excellent!

I followed other remarks and cut the butter and flour to 1/3 cup each, and the milk to six cups. It wasn't thick enough so I added a bit of instant mashed potatoes. Very good and my husband loves it.

It was good, but I think I am going to try the healthier version that someone posted next time (eliminating the butter, using 2% milk and reduced fat sharp cheese).

What great Comfort Food!  I bravely doubled the recipe on 1st try.  Substituted almond milk for regular dairy.  For flavor I added leftover  bacon fat in order to avoid excessive table salt in bacon itself as we regularly  eat Himalayan Salt (complete major and trace minerals not just sodium chloride).   Added lots more chopped scallions, less cheddar cheese and sour cream; also 2-3 Tbsp sugar.  Topped with a liitle grated sharp cheddar and vibrant italian parsley.  Better than Panera's baked potato soup.  Glad we have 6 quarts left!

`1Few minor changes, added chicken broth to decrease thickness and a mixture of cream and milk for creamier taste. Next time we will cut the potato back a bit. We also added a sautéed onion, and added the potatoes last to avoid them getting mashed. Heres our version of the recipe.

Loaded baked potato soup 

Serves 6-8

3/4 cup butter
1 package of bacon
2/3 sweet onion chopped
3/4 cup all purpose flour
6 cups of milk 1%
1 cup cream 35%
1 1/2 cup chicken broth
5 medium yellow potatoes
4 green onions chopped
1 tsp salt
1 tsp freshly ground pepper
1/4 tsp cheese bacon chive epicure seasoning
1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup sour cream

		
* Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned. Drain, crumble, and set aside. Add sautéed onions until translucent.q		
* In a stock pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Gradually stir in milk, whisking constantly until thickened. Stir in onions. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.		
* Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Mix in bacon, cheese, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until cheese is melted.

I make my version of this often.   I sauteed my onions in olive oil before starting, I also used real butter.2% milk on low fat sour cream and cheese, bacon bits where on the side.  I learned something making this, I used bread flour cause its what I had.  Bread flour gets alot thicker I guess cause of the extra protein in the flour, I just added another cup of milk.

This is a good,and rich version of potato soup. Thick,creamy and full of flavor. The only issue was the serving size, the recipe states 6 serving, but the recipe yielded more than 3 quarts of soup! Bit much for my husband and I, but the neighbors enjoyed the abundance. Also have extra onions,bacon, cheese and sour cream for the topping the soup.

I usually follow the recipe the first time through but I was worried by some of the reviewers that it would not have enough flavor. So, I added about 1/4 onion (finely diced) and 4 cloves of garlic (finely diced) to butter (instead or margarine) before adding the flour. Because I thought the bacon would add plenty of salt, I didn't salt it but I will next time and I added more cheese to the bowl when served. It was great and I think I have found my new cold weather comfort food. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I'm sorry I kinda changed it.

I gave this recipe 5 stars but only after making some mods to it. I already had my bacon cooked up ahead of time. I melted the butter then added the flour. Added 4 cups of half and half, then 3 cups 2% milk to add up to 7 cups of milk. Whisked until it thickened, added the red potatoes (3 large cooked and chopped into 1" chunks), bacon, green onions. After 10 minutes of simmering I added the cheese and sour cream. It was way too thick for my taste so I added a 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth...that was perfect and added some more depth of flavor, salt and pepper to taste...which was more than the recipe called for. It yielded 4 containers of 4 cups each. Will eat one container and freeze other three for later.

As written, this soup is really good,  though I usually find it needs a touch more salt. I do make this a bit differently than written usually. I dice up an onion and saute in the butter until soft, then add the flour to start making the roux. I don't usually have leftover baked potatoes so I dice up raw potatoes and let them simmer in the soup until they are cooked. You do have to keep a closer eye on the soup and stir often to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Also, if the soup is too thick, I often add 2 teaspoons of chicken base + 2 cups of water (you can also do 2 cups of chicken stock). Very rich and delicious!

After reading some reviews from other users I decided to use 4 cups milk and 2 cups of chicken stock. I also cut back on the flour as well.

For my own additions, when I added the butter to the pan I added about a cup of finely chopped celery and yellow onion. Once the onions became translucent I added the flour.

Some helpful tips, bake the bacon in the oven for crisper bacon that you can actually find in the soup. I also microwaved the potatoes while the bacon cooked.

I did make this. And, of course, I did not follow the directions completely. It was an overall good basic recipe, but I did follow some suggestions other people left. I also doubled the recipe as it was totally not going to feed 6 (in my household, but maybe my potatoes were small). So, I added extra potatoes, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Turned out great. I will make it again. Thanks for sharing.

I used rice flour and Almond Milk to make this a gluten/casein free recipe. Awesome! You can use rice cream instead of regular sour cream ,however this soup was great without it.

The whole family was amazed that it really taste like baked potato. I had to reduce the ingredients to fit our numbers. I am going to try adding other ingredients to mimic our potato topping preferences.  I love this soup.

I had some extra baked potatoes so I found this recipe to use them up. I halved the flour & butter, then added 6 cups of milk. My potatoes were smaller, so I used 6. I mashed them really well then added them to my pot. I had to add LOTS of salt and white pepper, and I put in a dash of garlic powder. After simmering for 10 minutes it was plenty thick. After putting it in our bowl, we added oyster crackers, sour cream, bacon bits, and cheese. This is a good base recipe, it just needed some sprucing up!

I made this recipe the first time and it was good. I had to add more salt and pepper, and a little more cheese (a personal preference, I love cheese!). The second time I made it I made some more modifications. Instead of 7 cups of milk I used 3 cups of half and half and 4 cups of milk to make it even creamier and thicker. I also found that adding the bacon into the soup softened the bacon up, so it turned chewy. I still wanted to taste the bacon in the soup but I didn't want chewy bacon. Instead of adding the bacon bits nto the soup, I used the bacon grease in the roux! It gave it the bacon flavor and I just had bacon pieces as toppings so it would keep its crunch. 2/3 cup of butter is about 10 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons, so I added 5 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon of bacon grease and 5 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon of butter into the roux to give it that bacon flavor. Overall, it is a great recipe but for me, personally, I like it cheesier, thicker, and with crunchy bacon!

My husband asked where I found this recipe, and then told me to make sure I book-marked it for future.  I think he liked it!  I did add a bit more milk, as it was very thick, but that was the only change I made.

I added some chopped onion to the butter at the very beginning. Did not add as much salt as they said, but did later, as it tasted too plain. Husband wanted even MORE bacon in it.
I liked it then, but he was not impressed. So we are at a stand off, and will not go thru the work again for "not impressed".

Fantastic recipe.  As other reviewers had mentioned, I substituted 1 cup of chicken stock for a cup of milk, and chopped and sautéed some onion and garlic in the butter prior to making the roux.  Came out perfect- thick and creamy.

I followed most of the recipe as listed. I did reduce the amount of flour as others suggested. I used butter instead of margarine , light sour cream, and sharp cheddar cheese. My family loved this recipe. I will definitely be using it again.

This has become a staple in my household.  It is so very easy to make especially after a long day of work.  I have tweaked it of course.  I use one stick of salted butter.  I also increased the milk to 10 cups so that this has the consistency of soup vs mashed potatoes.  I do not add the sour cream or the green onions to the pot, I leave those to be added by choice by whoever is eating.  Even with the bacon this can be bland.  So when I am making my roux, after adding the flour, I add garlic powder, onion powder , celery  salt, and cajun seasoning.  I add salt and white pepper to taste after adding milk.  I garnish with sour cream, green onions, and garlic flavored croutons (my daughter loves those is her soup).  
Now when I cook this I have to make an extra pot for my in laws!

I made some changes to this recipe, I hold the cheese and bacon and use those as a garnish. As well I use Half and Half instead of milk, allows for a more stable and higher cooking temp.

I also upped the amount of salt and pepper a tad, Made this at the restaurant, Owner stated it was the best soup he's ever had.

NOTE: it will initially be very thin. I was concerned when I first started to make it but it thickened up. I liked the end result, but only after I fudged the numbers/ingredients a lot. 7 cups of milk was way too much. I only used 5 and even that much made it very milky tasting even with everything in it, plus I had to add more flour than it said. The numbers are pretty much guidelines for you to adjust to your taste, I guess. I also had to add more ingredients because it was bland; quite a bit more salt and pepper than it said,  a bit of garlic and some finely chopped white onion.

I did substitute the Cheddar cheeses with Colby Jack and add garlic, but it is an amazing soup! My boyfriend wasn't sure that it would taste good (because of the list of ingredients) but it was AMAZING and he loves it too.  I said I was making potato soup tonight and he said "I hope it was the one you made last time." XD.

So so good and very easy. I used skim milk since that's what in my fridge and it was thick and delicious. Not sure how necessary the flour was since it didn't thicken at all until I added the baked potato, but I wasn't about to change it up on the first try of the recipe. Definitely will make this one again, the husband LOVED it!

Reduced the butter and flour by half. Definitely add, onion powder and garlic powder to taste. Also added 1/2 tsp of white pepper.  Used 1/2 milk, 1/2 chicken broth. Still felt it needed a 1/2 tsp  salt. Good comfort food and will make it again.

This soup is absolutely delicious! I used 4 cups chicken broth, 3 cups milk. I sautéed a half of a sweet onion in butter first, then added the broth and then flour, then milk, salt and pepper, etc. Amazing!

I have never made a cream-base soup before.  This recipe was easy and delicious.  I made it according to how it is written with the exception of half the bacon and  cheddar cheese due to what I had on hand.  I also added 3/4 tsp Herbs de Provence.  This is a keeper recipe.

Needed a little extra salt and pepper but otherwise it was perfect. Only change I made to the original recipe was I substituted 4 cups of chicken broth for 4 cups of the milk.

This soup was amazing ! I did make some of the changes recommended on the reviews of others . I used 4cups milk and 3 cups chicken broth , added 1 yellow onion and 3 cloves garlic sautéed first and a dash of cayenne pepper . I thought this soup was full of flavor and perfect in thickness. I have made potatoe soup in the past with it ending up bland and very starchy . This was definitely not the case with this recipe. It will be my ' go to ' soup recipe now . Enjoy !

Perfect!!! Like some people suggested, I did half chicken broth and half milk. Increased everything a little to make more. Used yellow potatoes and omitted the green onion. Instead, used half a yellow onion. Added garlic powder. Very thick and filling!!! Will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe! However, I half the butter and flour as 2/3 is way too rich. I use 3 cups of milk and 1 1/2 cups of chicken  stock otherwise it is way too thick and add sauteed onions when I mix in the potatoes.

Delicious.  Used half the butter, a few tablespoons of the bacon grease, half the flour, half the cheese and no sour cream. I added half milk/ half chicken broth for a thinner, more soupy consistency. It was still thick and hearty.  Added one extra potato and left the skins on.  I also cut them into larger chunks. I added 3 to 4 times the green onion, a few red pepper flakes, and also added lots of kale at the end.  One of the best soups I've ever eaten.

I don't like potato soup, so the rating comes from the husband. It's 3.5 stars as written for him. We ended up skipping the roux, using 2% milk, and adding 2 chicken bouillon cubes to the milk. Good base recipe. In the future, I would add more green onions and a touch of garlic powder.

Just finished cooking this up and had a bowl. It was amazing. I boiled the potatoes a little but separately first and mashed them just a little.  Since I was going for a more mashed vibe I skipped the onion and added some garlic powder (maybe a tbsp? It was to taste) and for a little extra kick I also added sriracha sauce to taste. Just enough to have a subtle heat. 

I wish I was still hungry so that I could have another bowl!

This recipe was the best foundation I found. Of course I added my own flair, brilliant idea to use broth to thin it down some, personally i love using onion, pepper, celery (chopped and bagged together) in a LOT of what i cook.  I sauté these down a good bit before adding them.  Thank you all for sharing your ideas.

THIS SOUP IS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. And I followed the recipe AS WRITTEN. I am a very picky eater, and I couldn't believe how fantastic it tasted. It really was not bland in the least! Added salt/pepper to my own liking but no more than usual with any food.   Perfect consistency!   I will be making this again and again .

It's hard to say if this soup would be good following exact directions.  After reading the directions,  I felt that it wouldn't be flavorful,  so these are the changes I made:  Not quite all the butter, and only half of the flour.  While melting the butter, I added yellow onions because I didn't have green on hand.   I also was out of sour cream, so I added about 4 oz. Chive and onion cream cheese.   I substituted at least 2 cups of milk for chicken stock and the rest was half and half.  I served it with cheese, bacon, and broccoli on the side (just to get the veggies in for my kids!).  It was good...but nothing like the original recipe!

This turned out really good! I did make some modifications though. I used about 1/4 cup of yellow onions and sauteed them with 3 cloves of minced garlic in only 1/2 cup of butter and I added a little bit of bacon grease. I also only used 1/2 cup of flour and per the reviews I did 3 cups of milk and 4 cups chicken broth. The directions says to add the salt and pepper when you add the sour cream and cheese, I added it when I put the potatoes in. Once I added the cheese and sour cream I let it melt and served it a only a couple minutes late. Turned out amazing!

I needed a recipe to use up leftover baked potatoes from dinner the night before! This caught my eye. Very flavorful with some garlic salt and onion powder, a dash of cayenne! This will go into my regular rotation! Could also add some chunks of hot dogs for extra flavor if you don't have bacon. Yum

This is my go-to potato soup recipe! I love it!! I'd give it ten stars if I could. I usually substitute the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt and the green onions with regular onions. Mmmm good!

this is a great recipe. I made a few changes. I first cooked the bacon in a big pit with a diced yellow onion. When the bacon was cooked I added half the amount of flour to the Greece. I then put in one can of chicken broth and one can of evaporated milk to make it creamy. I then added about 2 cups of half and half and added about 8 medium size potatoes. I omitted the butter since bacon Greece is basically lard. seasoned with parsley, pepper, garlic powder, and a little salt. Then I cooked it on low for a couple hours and added sour cream and cheese a few minutes before serving! Great recipe and I served it with homemade cheese rolls.

ok wanted to try something different so i  found this recipe and read all reviews. I boiled my potatoes.  then i took approximately 2 cups of potatoes and pureed them with a splash of milk and a tbsp of sour cream. I used 4 cups of chicken broth. I also used the bacon grease. I mixed bacon, green onion, sour cream, cheddar cheese, celery salt, parsley, minced garlic,  garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into the soup. when serving it i  garnished the top with a dollop of   sour cream and onion dip, chopped green onion, cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. My family fell in love with this soup. I will definitely be making this again. I also cut the flour roux in half. I used 1% milk, low fat cheddar cheese.

This is a GREAT base of a recipe for potato soup.  I did make a few changes due to my guys liking a LOT of flavor.  First off, I doubled the recipe.  For the butter, I did use it, but I also put in some of the bacon grease.  So I did half bacon grease, half butter.  I also used gluten free flour.  Before adding the fluids, I diced 1 small onion and 3 cloves of garlic and browned these, then I added in the fluid.  Instead of all of the milk, I used half organic chicken broth and half heavy cream.  This way I still had all of the creamy goodness, but the chicken broth added more flavor.   Then I added all of my potatoes and let it thicken up.  Instead of the sour cream, I added greek yogurt.  By this time, I'm so far away from the original recipe I'm not even measuring.  I added sharp cheddar cheese, that I grated myself (so I'm not adding any additional things into my recipe).  Topped with chopped green onions when serving and it was perfect.

Wow! Not for the lactose intolerant but delicious. One thing I added was some chicken stock near the end just to lighten it up a little. Very rich and delicious. Next time I think I'll add a can of clams and some corn.

Not bad.
Used Applewood bacon, oregano, lots of garlic and some parsley. Served topped with Mexican cheese and bacon bits. Makes a ton of soup, be ready to be eating this for a while. Would make again.

I used 1/3 cup bacon grease and 1/3 butter instead of the margarine and 5 cups milk plus 2-3 cups chicken broth instead of 7 cups milk.  Subsituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and omitted the salt (since there was already so much in the bacon grease and broth).  The soup came out great!  Very delicious.  I will definitely be making this regularly!

"Don't ever make me a baked potato again. Make me THIS SOUP instead." These were the dramatic words of my teenager as she gobbled this up.

Warm, creamy baked potato in a bowl - what could be better? Like the others, I used less butter and flour, less milk, and added some veggie broth to thin it out a little. I didn't cube the potatoes but just scooped them into the roux and then used a masher to give it some good texture.

We are vegetarian so I used some Morningstar bacon on top and it tasted just like the real thing. This is a keeper.

Delicious!  I used quite a few more potatoes than this called for, and ended up having to thin it down with chicken stock, but it was very good--big hit in my family!

Made it as listed - but I did keep all the skins on the potatoes and added additional pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper. Garnished with bacon bits, a little sprinkle of cheese and green onions.

I suggest you precook your potatoes!!! This will save you loads of time and constant stirring to avoid burning all that milk . Otherwise yummy -- lots of modifications can be made for taste ---ie different cheeses? Flavored bacon?etc.

That is so good!  If this is better tomorrow, as some reviews remarked, I cannot wait for leftovers!  Because I am vegetarian, we omitted the bacon and added vegetarian chicken bouillon.   That was the only change and I do not plan to do anything different the next time we make this wonderful soup.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I am a novice chef, so there is still a lot for me to learn. I have tweaked this each time I have made it. I generally add a good tbsp of Garlic, and always add extra cheese and bacon. The one thing I have the most difficultly with is the time span it calls for. It takes me at least 3 hours to make. I'm not sure why initially, but I just like to say that it takes so long because I always cook it with extra love. :)

Super tasty and easy. I used half the butter recommended to sauté onion and garlic and left out the flour. Used 3 cups boullion, 4 cups milk. Followed the recipe otherwise.

My boyfriend, my 7 year old son, and I loved this recipe. I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and cut the milk in half and added chicken broth. I did not find this recipe to be bland at all, as I read in a couple of reviews. We thought it was great. I think next time I will possibly add a bit more chicken broth because it was very thick, but that's just personal preference. Thanks for sharing this one.

Was a really tasty and easy to make dish. I did not add bacon just because I didn't want to waste time cooking it. I added a little more green onions because I love them. This is a really great potato soup.

With modifications: I usually give most recipes 5 stars thanks to the recommendations from other reviewers that make it better.  Used 1/2 milk, 1/2 chicken broth, added salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste. Added more green onions, used butter and 1/2 the flour for roux. Mashed half the potatoes, baked the others in microwave. Added fresh chopped parsley, and have chives for garnish.  Mine could be slightly a little thicker but might thicken more by the time company arrives. Very tasty

I gave the recipe three stars because I had to doctor it up a bit to get it to my liking. After following the original recipe, I changed it up a bit to my liking:

First, I parboiled the potatoes in 4 c chicken broth, while cooking the bacon in the microwave. I reserved the bacon grease (which actually ended up being 2/3 c of fat). I then made the roux with the bacon grease and flour. For my liquid, I used 6 cups of whole milk and the reserved chicken stock from parboiling the potatoes. I then followed the recipe, as directed, adding seasoning, as needed.

I am, by no means, claiming this is healthy; it's quite the opposite. However, it IS delicious. My friends & family frequently request I make this.

The wife and kids think it's awesome. The potatoes need to cook just a little bit more or cut into smaller cubes to cook quicker. All in all a big hit. Especially on cold weather days like today.

Very good soup. I loved the idea of using baked potatoes. So much easier than peeling and boiling a pot of potatoes! I didn't have any sour cream on hand but it tastes just as good without it.

Great recipe.  I did tweak it slightly.   Replaced 2 cups of the milk with chicken stock.  Instead of green onions diced up a yellow onion and sautéed with some minced garlic in a little of the bacon drippings.  And finally added a lot more pepper than 1 tsp (although didn't measure, just added until it was to our liking).

Very good! We made the following modifications: Reduced the flour to 1/2 cup, used 1.5 cups of chicken broth in place of 1.5 c of the milk, added a couple of teaspoons of bacon grease and a teaspoon of ranch seasoning, and a little extra cheese. We will make this again with the same changes.

This was my first attempt at Baked Potato Soup and I have to say it was almost too easy.  More importantly, it is delicious.  I've made it a couple of times and everyone who tastes it loves it.  I love that I can heat it up again for leftovers.  Great, easy recipe!

I took others advice and left out the butter completely. Just mixed the flour with a little milk instead. Added 1/2 sautéed onion and minced garlic (didnt have green onions). Used 6 reg potatoes, 4 cups skim milk, 2 cups chicken broth, some garlic powder, 1/8-1/4 tsp cayenne, handful dried parsley and kept the light sour cream, sharp cheddar, and a few bacon pieces for on top of each bowl. Absolutely delicious, tons of flavor with not much added salt. The best part is I lowed the calories to about 369 per serving.

Absolutely loved this recipe! The whole family did, even my six year old! I used light sour cream, 2% milk (4 cups), chicken broth (2 cups), 2 chicken boulion cubes, and added a little cayenne after reading other reviews. We also had some French bread for dipping. Very filling! Very delicious!

Not at all bad. The potatoes needed to cook much longer than recipe calls for. I would recommend pre-boiling them before adding them to the soup. Good taste though!

My husband and I tried this last night. We, as well as our three year old son enjoyed it and found it very tasty. I had read some reviews previously that said it was very bland, so we added some all seasoning salt, and kept adding salt and pepper until it reached a flavor of our liking. Two small complaints: we used the exact measurements of milk and flour, yet still found it to be a little thick. I guess if you like your soup that way, it would be just right, but it was just a tad too thick for us. Also, I'm by no means a chef, so when I cook I need to have ingredients and instructions dumbed down for me as much as possible so I don't misunderstand anything. I was a little disappointed to find out after I already started cooking that the potatoes needed to be BAKED. I guess I should have figured it out on my own beforehand, however, like I said, I need things dumbed down. We improvised and cut them up and boiled them in water to soften them and it turned out fine, however, I still think it should have included baking the potatoes in the instructions.

This was very good but I doctored it a bit.  I added about a 1/2 cup chicken stock and a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot.  Also added about a 1/4 tsp garlic powder and lots of cracked black pepper.  Will def add to my recipe box!

This is an excellent soup. The baked potato adds a distinctive taste and texture that we all very much enjoyed. It serves a lot more than 6, though. It becomes a problem when calculating an increase in servings as I was - 50 servings - and I ended up with a lot more than that - probably double. I served the chives and bacon on the side for people to add in themselves and just in case there might have been some vegetarians.  Served it at our Senior Centre Bazaar Lunch - went over very well.  Will make again.  UPdate: made this soup again for the Sr Ctr fundraiser - this soup was a hit once again. It really is best to let people add their own toppings - it really dresses up the bowl of soup beautifully.

Used microwave bacon which was easier than frying bacon. Also added another cup of milk at the end because it was too thick. Really great way to use up leftover baked potatoes or bake extra ones so you can make this recipe!

This was super easy and very good. It's a great weekday meal by itself with leftover baked potatoes from the weekend. I left the skins on and mashed half of one of the potatoes to thicken it up. I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make. My 9 y/o said it is the best thing she has ever eaten. I don't know if I should be offended or not since I cook everyday lol but this recipe was great. I followed exactly except I used half and half instead of milk. Yummy!!! Thanks Sherry!

I added celery, onions, and used 4 medium (about 5 inch long) potatoes. The soup was pretty good, however it could be seen as bland. I meant to add chicken bouillon as suggested by another review, but I forgot. :( While there is nothing BAD about this soup, it's definitely a awesome basic soup to finish off with your own spices. For the "problem" of thickness, I used 7 cups milk, 2/3 flour, sour cream, and cheese and it was pretty thick (how I like it personally).

I made this tonight after my fiancé had oral surgery and needed something soft to eat. The prep was simple and easy, the cooking was really just stirring and, quite literally, throwing things into a pot. And for those who still have questions, the video will be a great help :-)

All in all, this came out amazingly well! I didn't change too much of anything, added a little more of ingredients to taste (the sour cream, salt, and pepper) and I did make extra to go on too as well.

We both loved this and is so much tastier than any canned version sold out there. I look forward to making this again and finding some changes that add to it :-)

Beautifully thick & creamy soup. I substituted 3 cups of milk with chicken stock and my baked potatoes broke up nicely after peeling and placing into the soup so there was no need to chop them.

I made it with 4 cups of milk and one can of chicken broth.  It was delicious and my mother, who is a great cook and 98 years old, loved it as well.  Instead of cooking bacon, I used the Real Crumbled Bacon from Hormel and sprinkled that on top of the bowls of soup.

I usually don't like baked potato soup, but I loved this soup! I used low sodium bacon and crumbled it using a food processor. I baked the russets in the microwave and after they cooled I peeled and chopped them, leaving them in big chunks because they were soft. I used lactose-free milk, regular sour cream, and the green onions. The shredded cheddar had 3 kinds of cheddar cheese. I used all measurements as called for and didn't add the salt or pepper until the end, as directed. I will definitely make this again. My husband thought it would taste good with clams in it.

I have made this recipe about 4 times now. It's been a huge crowd-pleaser! I substituted hot Italian sausage for the bacon (The heat from the sausage was really nice!) and used Yukon gold potatoes. I also used all skim milk and lite sour cream. It was wonderful! Used butter instead of oleo for the roux. My family loves it!

This soup was wonderful - perfect for a cold winter day!!   Made exactly as shown.   Next time will wait and add the browned bacon on top of soup as I serve it - felt like the bacon got too soggy - especially with left overs.    Can't wait to make again.

I made this recipe on a smaller scale but some changes I made were leaving some of the potato skins on, plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and less milk and added chicken broth as suggested in one of the comments above. My dad doesn't eat pork so I use turkey bacon and add a little garlic salt with pepper. One thing I would like to try is olive oil instead of butter but I'm hesitant. Either way this version was my favorite I've made/

First time making this soup and the recipe was awesome! Not much of a soup fan so I usually just buy it canned for my husband but he was over the moon about it homemade. Only thing I'd do differently is boil the cubed potatoes for about 10 min before adding them in to soften them up quicker. Also used garlic salt instead of regular for more flavor. Thanks!

This a great recipe.  I especially love it because it is made with ingredients that I always have on hand.  All experienced cooks ( over 40 years myself) know that you season to taste.  I liked that she didn't over season, because you can always add more, you can't take it out.  Thanks for sharing Sherry!

I have made this a couple times and everyone loves it. I made a few modifications, though. I used just over 1/4 cup butter and subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I didn't bother with peeling the potatoes and just mashed them up, skins and all. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 3 tablespoons of ranch seasoning (I make my own) and also added garlic powder and onion powder.

This soup is AMAZING! I followed the instructions exactly. It's really think but I find it good that way. All I added was a little extra seasoning for some extra flavor. Now this is my new official comfort food haha!

This is an excellent potato soup. Next time I will use less pepper.  I added a few extra "potato" seasonings, but it's very good just as written.

This is a great recipe for baked potato soup. If you follow the recipe to a t, it turns out really pasty, so I added more milk to it. I didn't measure how much milk I added, but I gradually added the milk and stirred the soup until I got the consistency I wanted to get. I adding the milk after it was all done, but next time I will do it while it's still cooking. I also used butter instead of margarine.  After reading other reviews about the soup being bland, I decided to add some garlic powder, Sazon Accent, and extra salt. Also, I think it takes much longer to prepare this recipe than stated above.  Now it could be that I take too long to cook and I have 4 year old triplets, but it just seemed like it took me much longer to get it done. The soup turned out great. We all loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Great way to repurpose ingredients from a previous meal. We had baked potatoes the night before and I made extra for this recipe. Instead of using the green onions, I sautéed some diced onions, red & green bell pepper and celery and added it with the potatoes.   I also added a a tsp of Thyme for a little more flavor, but would have been great without. My 11 year old and his friend loved it too. Asked that I make it again.

We really liked this recipe. I only added three cups of milk and one can of chicken broth. It still was a little on the thick side. Really good though.

I made this last night and it was delicious! My boyfriend said it was the best potato soup he's had, and even posted about it on Facebook. Once I added the sour cream, cheese, and bacon this was NOT bland at all. My only changes were that I used butter (not margarine), used 2% milk because I had it on hand, and cut back to 6 cups of milk and half a cup of flour. It was awesome!

My family and I really liked this recipe.  I put a little more potato and salt in the soup, but it was great! Perfect on the snowy day that we ate it on.  Had plenty of leftovers, but that is good for our family.  My husband said it was good reheated too.  Will be saving this one for the future!

I just cooked this tonight and my family loved this soup.  This was my first time making it but I did add to it.  I sautéed 1/2 cup of yellow onions and fresh garlic in EVOO.  I added 3 chicken bouillon cubes.  I had no problem with the roux using the 2/3 cup of flour; the consistency was perfect.  I did add the salt right before serving as someone suggested in the comments.  I didn't find that it was bland at all.  Excellent recipe!!!

YUM!!!!
I did make a few changes which is odd because normally I'm a rule follower. I added some chopped celery and carrots; I also added a chopped onion and some garlic to the bacon. It was DELICIOUS. The only other change was butter instead of margarine and that was only because we only had butter. IT WAS A HUGE HIT. WE WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN...AND AGAIN. Thanks so much. YUM! YUM! YUM!

Changes:  used left over baked potatoes, substituted corn starch for flour; used 3 cups milk, and served the chives and bacon on the side.  For those who complain of a flour taste, flour has to be 'browned' after adding to the butter; otherwise, you end up with a raw flour taste.  I wanted a silky base, so I did not mash any of the potatoes (and another reason I prefer corn starch}  The resulting dish was a silky smooth creamy soup base with a baked potato taste that tastes very different than when using fresh potatoes. After all, the recipe probably originated from using left over baked potatoes! Thanks for sharing, Sherry!

By following the directions exactly I found it to be too thick and slightly bland.  However my teenage son and husband loved it.  I made it for a second time tonight and cut the butter/flour in half, added some onion, and some extra seasoning and I found it to be more flavorful and the perfect consistency.

This was a good base as it is, but I prefer a thicker "soup" so omitted 2 cups of milk, added more onion, a good helping of salt and pepper, did not mix the bacon in, just crushed on top along with some chives.  We loved it.  Makes a ton - there is only two of us, I will try to half-it next time.

I thought this was a great, simple potato soup recipe. My girlfriend and mother both loved it. This will be part of my regular rotation of recipes.

My very picky son even loves this.  It adds extra fat, but I don't drain the bacon grease.  Gives it an extra flavor.

It was too creamy for me. I had to add a total of about 2 cups of water to thin it out. It made enough to feed an army!

I tweaked this recipe a bit based on the "bland" reviews. i added 1 can of chicken broth and omitted one cup of milk. a handful of fresh parsley chopped, fresh minced garlic, and a dash of garlic powder. Oh and i added broccoli florets.. it tasted great.

This is the best potato soup I've made. I followed the recipe to a tee except the bacon. I used thick cut bacon so I used about 8 slices instead but that's it.

Been getting over a cold and I was craving a hot bowl of potato soup. This was the first time I've made potato soup and this recipe was simple and GREAT! I did change a few things though. I know its supposed to be baked, but instead I boiled the peeled cubed potatoes in 4 cups of chicken broth. The potatoes absorb all the flavors of the broth which makes them so flavorful! Once boiled I added that to the milk mixture (which I cut down to 6 cups of milk, since there was about 2 cups of broth remaining with the potatoes). I'm a huge garlic fan so I also added 5 cloves of garlic minced. And I ditched the sour cream. I was also craving something meaty so I added 4 beef jalapeno sausages (Hillshire Farm), grilled and cubed. It was D-licious! I will definitely make this more often on cold rainy days :)

We made this recipe tonight and loved it!  I added chicken broth and instead of plain sour cream, we used Bacon Horseradish Sour Cream dip to give it more flavor!  Enjoyed a salad with it and everyone loved it, even the kids!

The consistency is good a little thick for leftovers though. It is bland I even added 5 cloves of minced garlic and extra sauce. So for the leftovers I added cayenne pepper and it's alot better tasting. But reheated it is quite thick and is more like mashed potatoes than soup.

I made this for my family. Even though it was summer, my guys gobbled it up. Our usual soup (made from the envelope soup mixes) has always left an aftertaste. This soup was such a fantastic change! I did add a few extra potatoes and left the skins on. I also added a few drops of hot sauce (not enough to make it spicy, it just added nice flavor)along with a teaspoon of garlic powder. It was really delicious. If we liked it this much in the summer, I can't wait to use it during the long, cold winter months here in Iowa!

I had been looking for a recipe for a potato soup....I made this soup for my family and it was a big hit and a cold first day of spring night. We all loved this baked potato soup and it was so very easy to make. Thank you for a great potato soup we will be making this for winters to come!

I didn't have left over baked potatoes, but I really wanted to try this recipe! I just let the potatoes boil a bit longer than it said to. I had  to use real onions instead of green onions and I added them with the milk. I omitted the butter and flour mixture and that was fine. At the end I had to add a bit of garlic powder because it was a bit bland. Despite all my lame substitutions, this was a hit! I'll make it again someday following the recipe correctly.

Very good- I used less butter and flour than recommended. The potatoes thicken the soup also. And I did not peel the potatoes since the peel adds extra flavor, texture and nutrition to the soup. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the soup and kept the cheese, scallions and bacon off so people could top the soup as desired. I chopped broccoli and steamed to use as an additional topping. Everyone loved it!

This recipe was really good, I made a couple of small variations. I diced 2 carrots and 1/2 a yellow onion (about 1/2 cup) and sauteed them in  1/3 cup of the reserved bacon drippings. I then added 1/3 cup of the butter and continued with the roux and the rest of the recipe. Nice layering of flavors with the variations, I will definately be making this again.

My family loved this soup.  It was quick and easy to make, and tasted better than any soup we have had at a restaurant.  I made as directed using skim milk and sharp cheddar.  I did substitute butter for margarine.  Next time I will use reduced fat sour cream and cheese as well -- I fully expect that it will still taste amazing.  We will definitely make again.

Very delicious! Couple of adjustments...
 Instead of cooking bacon in the beginning I used real crumbled bacon from Costco (approx 3/4 - 1 C.). I used a whole yellow onion instead of green (because it's what I had) and I sauteed it in the butter before adding the flour and milk.  This seems to bring out a really yummy flavor in the onion. Also, I didn't peel the potatoes.  I really like to leave the skin on my taters as I feel that it gives more nourishment and texture.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Made it for some company and got compliments.  Will definitely be my go-to potato soup recipe!!! 


Fast and easy to make

When I invited my neighbor to eat potato soup, she said she still had some left she had made a couple of days ago. She brought her "great" chicken broth based potato soup for us to taste. Hmmm, that is really hot (with pepper). Anyway, I made this recipe. My husband said, "Now. THAT is great potato soup!" Both of us had two bowels and we love this recipe.

Love4Food gives a great review of this soup. I would not make this recipe as presented. It is tasty but too thick and gooey.  Follow the advice of Love4Food and enjoy.

Made this tonight, and it was great.  I used one cup of chicken broth and 6 cups of 2% milk, and I used real butter instead of margarine.  It had plenty of flavor.  I also cheated and used a couple of packs of the real bacon bits (1-1/2 pks in the soup and the rest of garnish)instead of frying my own bacon, and it was really good.  Served with sliced, toasted french bread with roasted garlic.  A really good, hearty meal.

This soup is better than any I have ever ordered out. Very easy and not an all day kitchen job I sub 3 cup of milk and added chicken stock in its place and added chives, garlic, and a bit of dill. Thanks so much for sharing We will be having this again....

Loved it!! Looked for a recipe online and read many of the reviews on some of the modifications so I went with this one. Tried it for the 1st time and the adjustments I made were (2cups of chicken broth + 5 cups milk) and added 2 cloves of diced garlic. I didn't bake the potatoes first so it simmered for an additional 15+/- minutes. This was my first time making potato soup and it was a HIT, my husband loved it!!! I took some to work the next day to share and no complaints :-)

Yummy!  Made this soup for my family and it was a big hit!  I got it a little thick, but it was still delicious.  I also added more salt and pepper, garlic salt, pinch of dill & parsley.  It was a little bland otherwise.

This recipe was so good.  My entire family loved it and so did my neighbors as I shared it during Hurricane Sandy here in NJ.  It's easy to make and a very hardy meal by itself.  I give it 5 stars. - Linda Lee

Love it! I added a cup of water to make it thinner. Then used skim milk, turkey bacon, fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheese and added a little ranch mix. I also boiled the potatoes and added a chopped medium onion with the green onions. Perfect!

This recipe is great with some modifications. Took the advice of some others and added plenty of garlic powder (prob 3 tsp by the time all was said and done) and some onion powder. I also doubled the salt. Before those modifications it was SUPER bland. After . . . potato soup genius!

I made this soup for a party this weekend and it was delicious.  I used 5 cups whole milk and 2 cups low sodium chicken stock per other reviews.  I actually cooked the bacon, baked the potatoes and chopped the onions one night.  Then the next night prepared the soup per instructions and put it in the crock pot to cook the following day.  Cooked it on low for 4 hours and it was perfect.

LOVED this super easy soup!  I did use healthier options. I used everything low fat that I could and it was still delicious!  Also I baked my potatoes in the oven with a little olive oil and sea salt instead of microwaving them.  Will definitely be making this again!

I have made this several times and it so creamy and flavorful. My friend asked for the recipe. She and her husband raved about it.  My husband just says "Mmmm" the entire time he is eating the first and second bowl.  I always make a double recipe because it is so good, you can't stop eating it.

This recipe was good once I added garlic salt and extra salt. Otherwise very good and easy to make.

This is an exceptional recipe for left over baked potatoes.  I purchased the bacon at a wholesale club, lending this recipe to fit into my low food budget (feeding 5 kids!)  I served it with home-made baked bread and everyone loved it!

I substituted bacon oil instead of regular oil.  I added Cajun seasoning, onions and garlic.  Also I cut 2 cups or more of milk and added chicken broth.  After the adjustments, it was FANTASTIC!!!!!!

I love this recipe.  Simple and easy to make, few ingredients.  It is pretty thick so I cut in half the amount of butter and flour I used to make the roux.  I also added a can of chicken broth to give it a little flavor.  Everyone that has tried this when I make it loves it.

This was delicious and a great way to use up baked potatoes.  I didn't have green onions so I just used a yellow one I had on hand.  It was really good--thick and creamy because of the sour cream.  It reminds me of a soup you could get at Panera's.  Except better because it's homemade.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious soup and super easy!  Only used 1/3 of the butter that the recipe called for and used skim milk.  I also used pre-cooked turkey bacon.   I used pre-chopped chives (found in the seasoning aisle), and added a bit of extra salt and pepper to increase the flavor. Everyone who had some loved it!  Perfect for a cold fall/winter day!

I tried a recipe for baked potato soup in my newspaper a few years ago and loved it but lost the recipe, I searched for similar recipes and this was the closest, I chose to make 7 servings, SUPER EASY recipe and tastes amazing!! I'm definitely recommending it to friends

Ive made this recipe a hundred times exactly as it is and it is wonderful.  It has become a staple in my house.  I've read most of the reviews and honestly I don't know why anyone feels the need to tweak it for flavor or thickness, it is perfect.

The ultimate potato soup! So rich and creamy, it was very satisfying. My super picky 3 yo daughter ate it all up, so did the rest of her sisters and my nephews! Of course there was plenty left over for the rest of the family as well, this made a huge pot.

I added the chopped bacon to the onion and then added some of my favorite spices as well.  Cooked them till the onion browned and then added them all at the same time.  My fiance doesn't like crunchy onions so it was just to make sure but it all turned out wonderfully!!!!

Absolutely delicious! My husband and I loved this soup! My husband "grades my dishes on a 1-10 scale" so I know how much he liked it and this recipe scored a 9.5!! He's a tough grader too!  Loved this creamy delicious soup & it will become a regular in my soup repertoires!

This is a delicious recipe - one my entire family will eat. I used bacon bits from the store, since I had that on hand from a previous recipe. Also, I added the sour cream and green onions to each bowl instead of mixing it into the stock pot due to individual family preferences.

Very good basic recipe.  Everyone has different tastes, but for those of you who thought it was bland, just either double the cheese, salt, add onions, more bacon ... I even added some cream cheese.  I just tried to think what goes on twice-baked taters or stuffed tater skins and added that.  Can always add a bunch of chives before serving too.

Perfect classic, no frills potato soup recipe. This is a great foundational recipe you can add and/or delete from. when I'm entertaining I add more interesting ingrediants, you can also make it more of a meal by adding a salad and some bread, kind of a "soup, salad, and breadsticks" night. But my immediate family likes this one just the way it is, except we always add more cheddar :)

My family thought the flavor was great, but the texture was not.  Very thin, despite adding extra flour to thicken it. And it seemed like the baked potato pieces should have been mashed or something.

This was fantastic! I did have to thin it out with a can of chicken broth and added more green onions because I like them. A keeper for sure.

I make this all the time and here are my modifications: 
-I use half golden, half russet potatoes, and I chop them up and boil them until cooked. 
-I add chopped smoked sausage with the bacon
-I add as much white pepper as black. 
It always turns out amazing!

This recipes is kind of like the one I make except I add ham chunks also. It gives it more flavor I think.

Delicious recipe! I used skim milk and about 1/4 of a cup of whipping cream, it was delicious!! I also cut corn off of the cob and added it to the recipe, added a little extra flavor!

I made this for the first time today it turned out great after some tweaking. I didn't have the tools required to make this dish so it took some inventive cooking but it turned out to be a yummy and hearty soup. I added a bit of vegetable favouring to my flour and butter mixture about a tablespoon. I cut out the salt and pepper just because the flavouring is so concentrated. Also adds a nice colour. I also found there was too much bacon (I know right). I will use less next time. Someone suggested coarsely mashing the potatoes as well... I will have to try that next time or cut smaller cubes. Also the sour cream is not needed I didn’t add any in mine and I did not miss it nor did I miss the cheese.

Fabulous!  This may insult serious cooks - I am normally not an adventurous meal-maker, but I improved here.  You know those days where you just have to make do with what you have?  Here's how I made this and it was great!  I cooked an onion in 2/3 cup butter.  I added 4 cups of 2% milk and 2/3 cup flour slowly, whisking while it thickened.  As I did this, I boiled 6 peeled and cubed potatoes.  When the milk was thick (which it will be because I'm using 4 cups instead of 7), I added a 15 oz jar of 4-cheese alfredo sauce.  (I know, right?!?  I didn't have Cheddar.)  I threw in 2 big handfuls of the chewy bacon bits (the Costco kind in a huge bag) with the milk.  It's nice and thick.  Then I drained and mashed the potatoes slightly and added to the sauce.  Yummy!  Doesn't need salt because of the alfredo.  I did put about 1/4 c of this wonderful seasoning by Knorr called Caldo de Tomate...my kids wil eat ANYTHING I put this on.  Gives it the garlic, onion, chicken flavor others were adding, too.  I don't think this needs sour cream or anything else.  I'm betting it might need that last cup of milk 'cause it's pretty thick.

Very Yummy!  I did add a clove of garlic with the green onion and potatoes and used season salt instead of salt and pepper.  Came out great, would make again.

This soup was really thick, but it's easy to thin with adding milk.  You'll definately need to add more salt, I'd do so all along during each step of the recipe. Super delicious, and can be tailored to suit your tastes.

This was soooo good. The only things I changed... I added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and I used medium gold potatoes and left the skin on (to keep all the nutrients) and mashed them and for the bacon I used uncured beef bacon from Trader Joes. My husband (not a soup kind of guy) and 2 picky daughters LOVED this!

Wow!  This soup is fantastic!  A few changes - I used the bacon drippings and 2T of butter instead of the margarine.  I also used about 4 cups of half and half, and 4 cups of skim milk.  I also realized at the last minute that we did not have cheddar cheese, so I used 1 cup of monterrey jack, and about 1/2 a cup of Velveeta, and it still tasted fantastic!

I loved this soup! ;) Since the other reviewers thought it was too thick I used less flour than the recipe called for. I also used less bacon. I used about 4 slices and thought that was even a bit too much! This is a must try if you love soup like I do!!!

This was delicious! I didn't have any leftover potatoes, so the prep and cook times took quite a bit longer. I'm normally a skim milk girl, but chose to go with whole milk for added creaminess. This is PERFECT for rainy days.

This soup was amazing.  The only thing different I did was add a tablespoon of self rising flour to thicken it up a bit.  For some reason I couldnt get it right with the all purpose flour.  Maybe added to much milk. But my coworkers loved it.  We are having a soup day at work and I will be making it again.

Delicious! Gets even better as it sits in the fridge, so make enough for leftovers! I used red potatoes and boiled them instead of baking them which tasted perfect. Used half milk and half buttermilk, halve the sour cream, and halve the bacon (but would have been great with all of it). Bake your bacon!

very smooth creamy soup.  you can make a much healthier version of it.  i used olive oil rather than margerine.  probably 1/4-1/2 cup olive oil and about 1/2 cup flour.  no bacon.  i didn't even find it needs the sour cream.  i also added thyme,  rosemary and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  also threw in about 3/4 cup of finely chopped carrot.  very nice!!!

This was my first attempt at making this soup and i was surprised that it was so delicious. My husband, who isn't a fan of soup, wanted to know when i would make it again. This is definitely a keeper.

Great potato soup recipe that can easily be adapted to your preferences. I add some of the bacon drippings after frying the pound of bacon and it gave the soup a great flavor. I think that without this it would have been a little too bland for my liking. Easy to make and great on a chilly night. Thanks for the recipe.

this was fabulous! I used 2 tbsp of butter, and a tablespoon of olive oil. Extra addings included tbsp of dill, tbsp dried onion flakes, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I also used 1 1/2 cups of vegetable stock instead of all milk to break down calories and it was still very rich. I also did a topping bar with bacon crumbles, shredded cheddar, onions and sour cream.

Followed exactly and found it a little bland.  Added a few shots of chicken oxo and that was all the punch it needed.  The whole family enjoyed it, but can you really go wrong with bacon?!

I just finished a bowl of this soup and it is yummy but mine turned out VERY thick.  I had some half and half to use up so I used a little less than 2 cups of that and the rest skim milk.  Next time i will add half chicken broth half milk as others have suggested.  I also had to add extra salt and pepper.  But overall it was very good!

Wonderful, wonderful! I consider this resturant quality! I didn't have the green onions on hand, but I can only imagine if I did! My family is typically a skim milk clan but I recommend not using skim for potato soup.  My DH is also a huge meat eater and he enjoyed this for dinner and didn't insist that I still have some other meat to serve.

Awesome!!! My husband can't get enough and it is totally kid friendly :-) I always add in my favorite spices and it was all good. I use basil, parsley, oregano, garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. I do also add in some fresh minced garlic. For a shortcut, I have used the Oscar Mayer bacon pieces (not dried out bits--yuck) and it has been as flavorful as freshly fried bacon. As an added meat, I do use ham chunks to make this even more filling! I have to double this recipe since I have a BIG family, so a hearty potato soup with all that meat is a complete winner!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Great soup!  I cut the margarine and flour down to 1/2 cup each.  I also used half chicken stock, half milk, and omitted the green onions.  Delicious!

This is good. I used 2 cups chicken stock + 5 cups milk instead of the full 7 cups milk. Also added leeks, onion, & garlic in the beginning. Immersion blender helped with consistency at the end. Reduced butter to 1/2 cup. Added oregano, basil, garlic powder, light sour cream, and changed milk to 1%. It was yummy.

Sooo good !! Did not need all the tweeks others noted.  Did not find the soup at all bland or to thick.  I don't like potato soup at all but this was so good.  My husband loved it!  The only thing we did different was add extra cheese, bacon & salt & pepper because we love extra of those ingredients.  This recipe doesn't need altered to taste amazing.

I have a daughter who only wants us to go to restuarants (or wants me to pick it up for her) with this soup on the menu.  I thought it would be beneficial to learn to make it at home.  I cut the milk to 4 cups, added a can of cheddar cheese soup and chicken broth for additional flavor.  I used onion powder and garlic powder in place of the onions.  I didn't add any salt because the soup is salty enough.  The soup was delicious and my family requires me to keep it in the fridge now.  Thanks for sharing!

DEEElicious.  The only thing wrong with this recipe is that eventually we ran out of leftovers.  I used garlic instead of onions, because I don't like onions.

This soup was excellent.  I made a few changes. Following another reviewer's alterations, I used 4 cups of chicken stock, 2 cups of 2% milk, and 2 cans of low fat evaporated milk.  (I think the stock added to the flavor.)  I used only a few pieces of bacon because that was all I had on hand--and I did not think the soup lacked at all.  I also used half of a red onion (which I first sauteed in some butter ) because I did not have green onions.  I added half the potatoes to the milk base, then used my emersion blender to smooth it out.  I added the remaining potatoes and onions and boiled.  (I like my soup thick with some pieces of potato.)  I think this soup is well flavored as written, not bland like some others thought.  I do recommend being stingy with the salt at the start, adding slowly until you get your desired saltiness.  Overall this soup is delicious!  My two year old licked her bowl clean.

Excellent hearty soup!  I served it with a loaf of warm Italian bread and it was a deliciously filling meal.  I did add more salt, black pepper and a few dashes of cayenne pepper as well and it was anything but bland.  I mashed some of the potatoes and left others in bigger chunks for texture.  The best potato soup I've ever made!

We made this exactly as it is written.  This was thick, rich and very filling.  Tastes great the first day, and reheats well and tastes great the second day too.   It does a take a bit longer to cook than expected, so make sure to allow for a bit of extra time.

This turn out sooooo good.  I tweaked it a bit using a can of chicken broth and only 2 cups milk.  I also added a little garlic powder for flavor. Because I only used 3 potato's, I didn't use a full cup of sour cream. One thing for sure is I'll defintely make this soup again.

I made bread bowls to serve this in, which worked out well. I didn't quite use all the flour or butter the recipe called for. We like a lot more salt and pepper than the recipe stated. Other than that it was pretty good. I also mashed the potatoes a little bit, not a ton, but just enough so that it wasn't just potato chunks floating in milk-based broth.

Great recipe.  I teach Foods and Nutrition.  I followed some of the other suggestions.  Used less flour; about 1/2 c. Used less milk; 4 cups, then added some at the last minute to thin.  Used a lot more salt, garlic powder, and black pepper.  It is thick, but I liked it thick.  Reminded me of mashed potatoes, a thinner version.

I added spices to make it taste good. It was a very thick "soup." It actually solidified in the refrigerator overnight.

As written, this was mediocre at best. It was very bland, so I added garlic/onion powder, lots of dried parsley, and a healthy shake of cayenne pepper. Also subbed some chicken stock/broth for about 2 cups of the milk. After modifications, it was delicious! It does make a pretty thick roux, so be aware that you might need to adjust your liquids according to taste. Perfect for a chilly night!

i gave this recipe four start only because i had to add some seasoning to make it not so bland. the thickness and texture is right on for me and my family though. i made last night with some ham that i browned first (did not have enough bacon) and then added right before serving. i also always bake my potatoes and then mash them a bit before adding, do not like chunky potatoes in my soup. also added a bit more cheese,but overall, great. my picky kids (husband and four year old) even ate it, and husband, who doesn't like soup, took leftovers for lunch today!

My husband and I love this! We eat it fairly often. I typically make it in half batches though because otherwise it would be to much. I agree it can be a little bland, but I found that two chicken bouillon cubes (per half) gives it the perfect flavor. I also, use this same recipe and switch out the potatoes and bacon for broccoli.

This recipe was very good.  I did feel like it was missing something, so next time I will try seasoning it more, and possibly, add more butter.  Very good start, though!

This is a great recipe, however at first it may be a bit bland for some but it does leave plenty of room to work on new flavors without taking away from the consistancy.

Hmmmm.... I don't think I like this.... This soup is WAAAY too thick and chunky (i.e. too many potatoes IMHO) and quite bland. I like a nice creamy soup (yes), but this was almost like a thick potato casserole - in a bowl. There was barely any "broth" (if that's what you call it) to dunk my sourdough bread into. I did like the tang that the sour cream gave this, which is surprising since I usually don't care for it other than as a garnish. I couldn't decide b/t this soup and absolutely ultimate potato soup by Karena, so I did a little combining of the two. I sauteed a small yellow onion, 2 stalks of celery & ~ 3 T fresh minced garlic in bacon grease, threw my cubed potatoes in, s&p'd to taste, tossed all to coat & then proceeded with Sherry's directions. I did add equal amounts of fat free milk and chicken broth to enhance the flavor as others suggested (I needed to use my "about to expire" refrigerated broth) and ended up tossing half of my crumbled bacon into the soup and heating as directed. I topped my serving with the rest of the bacon, some scallions and a handful of shredded cheddar cheese. I'm going to try slow cooker creamy potato soup by ROZANRENEE as I think I will like that better. Thanks for sharing!

I made this soup at the request of a young friend who has had their jaw wired shut due to an injury, but I don't think they're going to get much of it, it's too good!   I followed all the directions, but omitted the onion at the patient's request and didn't realize the potatoes had to be pre-baked, but it only took an additional few minutes for them to cook.  I also used fat free milk and added salt and pepper to taste.  It did turn out very thick (probably because of the additional cooking time), but is easily rectified w/additional milk or water.  This will be puree'd for the patient, who needs the extra fat and calories while eating only things that will fit through a straw.  I'm adding this to my favorite soups!  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT!!! I found this to be a great recipe! Usually when I make this soup, I bake the potatoes, and instead of throwing the peels away, I make potato skins! About this recipe, I like the way the flour makes it nice and thick. But instead of using 7 cups of milk, I used 4 cups, and it fed 6 people!

This was great!  This is my daughter's favorite soup, and we don't get out to restaurant's much.  Now we can have it at home. We used butter rather than margerine.  The only "complex" part of the recipe was all the prep work.  Other than that, very easy.  This one is being added to my personal cook book for easy access in the future!

OMG...this was the best soup that I have ever tasted.  My son is a really picky eater and he also loved the soup so much that he actually requested that I send some for lunch in his thermos! I altered the recipe slightly only adding 8 strips of bacon which was all I had in the house.  I used skim milk and low fat cheddar and low fat sour cream and it worked out wonderfully!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I had to omit the bacon because I was much too lazy to run out to the store but I didn't miss it at all!  I also added a small can of diced green chiles and substituted one of the cups of milk for cream.  Yummy!

this recipes is pretty bland overall. i misread the recipe and added baking potatoes (russet), not pre-baked potatoes, so i had to cook the soup about 20 minutes longer to fully cook the potatoes. also sauteed yellow onion in the butter before adding flour, and added about a tsp of dried basil and a cup or so of shredded carrots. still lacking a lot of flavor, so probably will not make again.

Delicious!!  It is very harty, it's more a chowder than a soup.  The recipe is perfect.  I worried because it didn't seem as though mine was thickening, but don't worry it does, and if you're not sure it will just put in a few more pinches of flour.  Don't skimp on the bacon, I didn't put as much as it called for and I wish I had.  Also, all I had was unsalted butter and that worked perfectly.  This soup will impress people.  It looks, smells, and tastes great and doesn't require anything too fancy.

This potato soup is fantastic, and pretty easy to make (hubby's exact words: "this stuff is da bomb!")- sour cream gives it a special flavor and creaminess, and since we didn't have any leftover baked potatoes, I cooked some quick in the microwave in one of those cloth "baked potato bags" - which cut way down on the prep time.  Even better the second day, and a wonderful treat for those of us freezing our butts off up here in Iowa.  :-)

Making this on a short notice of visitors coming, I bought baked potatoes from a local fast food joint.  I followed the recipe but cut back on the bacon...I let my guests put the amount they wanted in.  I cooked the bacon separately and didn't use the grease in the soup (I know people enjoy it, but I did have a guest that doesn;t eat meat over).  Great soup!!!! Definitely a staple for my winter nights.
Thank you!

My husband actually made this on Christmas Eve and this will now be our new tradition.  This was terrific and both of our kids loved it.  Of course, we are from the San Luis Valley, Colorado...potato capital of Colorado and we love potatoes.  We didn't change a thing.  Thank you for the recipe!

I agree with some of the other reviews that this soup was incredibly thick. The next time I make it I will use probably less than half of the butter and flour mixture. I even added a can of chicken stock to the soup and it was still thick. Very tasty though- definitely tasted better the second day once flavors had a chance to meld together. Will definitely make again.

I felt that this recipe needs something.  It's kind of bland.  Its a good start.  I'll need to work on adding additional ingredients or maybe next time using half milk and half chicken broth.

This was a very flavorful soup. My husband and I really liked it, although I will be making it sparingly and not using so much bacon.  Hubby has high cholesterol :)
 Edit: I made this soup for the second time tonight and my kids loved it. Paired it with Irish Soda bread (with out the rasins) and it was a wonderfull filling meal.
 I did find it easier to fry the bacon in the same pot as the rest of the soup. Just cut the raw bacon, fry in the bottom of the pot, and with a slotted spoon pull the cooked pieces out when they're done. Drain the grease out and you're all set and it's one less dish in the sink.

very tasty! the only thing i changed was the amount of margarine. i used the remaining bacon fat and supplemented with a little butter to make about 1/4 cup. i found that it made a decent roux and added more bacon flavour!

I hosted a baby shower with 40 guests.  This soup was delicious. Everyone gave excellent comments. The only thing I did different was I served the soup in sour dough bread bowls.

Love this recipe, I use half chicken broth and milk I use a little extra then the recipe calls for so it won't be so thick. I also added  some seasoning to it like thyme,parsely,onion pwd.,garlic pwd,ranch packet and pepper.

This is a great recipe. It really hits the spot on a cold winter day. Very filling and great taste. I would definitely add more potatoes, bacon, and green onions. The soup base is a little on the thick side. I think you could thin it out substituting chicken broth for some of the milk. I'm adding it to my favorites!

I used butter instead of margerine, and since I don't care for green onions, I sauteed yellow onion in the bacon grease and used that instead. AWESOME!

I put only 1 Tbs of Margarine but added 1 Tbs of the bacon grease, and added only 1/3 cup of flour.  And instead of 7 cups of milk, I put 3 cups of milk and 3 cups of chicken broth.  Soup turned out very thick.  My boyfriend suggested adding a handful of frozen corn and it was an excellent idea as it gives a bit of sweetness.  Will definitely make it again.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I cooked the bacon in the bottom of the stock pot, then used the bacon fat and a little bit of butter instead of just using butter to make a roux.  No sense wasting all that liquid gold!  I also made some additional bacon in order to crumble on top for serving.

This was really tasty. I didn't make any changes, and the only thing that I might do differently next time is add more milk, because mine had the consistancy of a well, a baked potato! It was soooo thick. But that didn't stop my boyfriend and I from eating it all up!! Yum!

This soup is awesome.  I didn't have left-over bakers, so I peaeled and cubed four russet potatoes and boiled them before putting the soup together.  It was fabulous.  This one goes in my keeper box!

Since my original rating, this recipe was a keeper. We've been using it for a couple years now and honestly love it. It's a good stick to your ribs baked potato soup. If you want something healthy, you'll have to eat a plain baked potato. Definitely a good soup to have on the menu for the winter. 

Original posting - 
I rated this recipe low mainly because it's SO FATTENING! After I made it, I honestly didn't want to eat it because I knew what was in it! My fiance in Iraq has one request though and that's to learn how to make and master Potato Soup. I will be finding another recipe that's healthier for us.

I love this soup (although I think the original recipe's a little too thick to be called a 'soup'- maybe more of a stew)!  Instead of baking the potatoes beforehand, I simply peel, cube and boil them until they're soft.  I also use real bacon bits instead of bacon slices, and pretty much bypass the first step.  If you want a thinner soup, cut the flour in half.  Otherwise, a terrific recipe.

Real good recipe, nice taste. I think I'd add an extra potato next time, though, as it came out a little on the thin side.

This soup is really quite good. I agree that the roux was a bit too much and made it a bit too thick, but I compensated by adding vegetable broth before simmering. I also added some extra seasonings, including more salt and pepper than the recipe calls for. Still, overall this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've been making this soup for years! However, I use a ham steak cut into 1/4" because I hate to cook bacon.  Also, I leave the skins on the potatoes.  Always needs some thinning down with milk, but it is a winner on a cold night!

Great recipe.  In a hurry?  Heat milk in microwave before adding to soup.  Soup will thicken in half the time (and won't burn!)

My husband ate a potato soup in a restaurant and asked me to make it for him.  I had never done a potato soup.  This recipe is very easy.  I changed a little bit.  I put more salt and pepper and a lot of spices like lavender,thyme, basil and fennel.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  My family love it and they didnt leave me any leftover.  My husband even said that it taste better that the one in the restaurant.

THIS WAS AMAZING!! My granmother made soup just like this when I was little, and when I tasted this I instantly remembered that. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

 I made a few changes based on the reviews of other cooks. I reduced the flour to 3 table spoons, which is just under 1/4 cup, other cooks said it was too thick. I only used 4 cups of milk, (used half and half milk because that's what I had) and followed the advice of other reviewers, and added 1# 14oz. can of chicken broth. I only added 1 onion because that's all it needed.

 This made a GREAT MEAL with the italian bread bowl recipe also found on this site!!

This is the kind of creamy potato soup I have been searching for. I did add more potatoes and instead of baking them I cubed and cooked them early since that works better with my schedule. My husband thought it was yummy!! 
Thanks Sherry

Just made this as a clear-out-my-pantry meal, and it was wonderful. I took others suggestions and split the milk (2%) and chicken broth. I used red onions, and sauteed them seperately, and also parboiled some finely chopped broccoli and carrots, and added all of them in the same step as the potatoes. It came out a wonderful consistency and had a good flavor. Will make again!

This recipe is great! Try substituting cauliflower (for the potatoes) you can't tell the difference and it cuts way down on the starch content.

Sauted onion and garlic in butter before adding flour.  Would have liked to have added celery, but didn't have any so I used some celery seed.  Instead of using all milk I mixed in chicken broth (50/50)

So easy to make and a definite "comfort food". This is my favorite kind of recipe. Delicious on its own but totally workable to suit one's particular tastes. Sometimes I add extra bacon or cheese and I am not afraid of the butter. I know some cooks get away with less butter and lowfat milk etc and I suppose that's ok. But when I want the "REAL" thing I forget about calories and enjoy! I hope you do too.

My husband and I love this soup!  You can ask my husband what his favorite food is, and he will say, "My wife's potato soup."  I pretty much follow the recipe exactly, but I have started buying the precooked bacon, and I do add a lot more salt and cheese than the recipe calls for.  I am actually making it tonight for dinner, and I am thinking about boiling the potatoes, instead of baking them, to save some time.  I will definitely be making the recipe for years to come!

This is a great soup.  I had some fat free half and half that I needed to use so I used that instead of the milk.  I had to thin it down some but it was delicious.  My husband said it was better than the one we bought at the grocery store this summer when we were camping.  I don't know how often I will be making this, but I will diffently use this recipe when I want to make potato soup.

This soup is awesome. I follow the directions and it totally works. I cut the bacon into sort of large pieces (because it sort of disintegrates as you keep it warm on the stove all evening.) Everyone I have served this soup to has wanted the recipe.

What an awesome potato soup!! I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth to make it a little more "soupy." My family LOVED this recipe! My 14 year old asked if we could make it a once a week meal!!

Thanks for sharing!

This was a wonderful soup - just what my family needed on a cold evening.  Served it with some homemade rolls.  Leftovers the next day were even better.  Will make this again and again.

This was absolutely delicious!  It was a very nice comforting warm soup for a cold day.  My boyfriend kept telling me how good it was.  I saved some bacon, sour cream, cheese, and green onions to put on top of the soups just before serving.  It came out perfectly.  I will be making this again and again.

This was my first attempt at making potato soup and it turned out great!  Even my fussy kids like it.  The only changes I made were using dried chives instead of green onions and instead of using 2/3 cup of butter, I used 1/3 cup of my excess bacon drippings and 1/3 of butter.  It really kicked up the flavor - and the fat! It's OK to indulge once and a while though - especially when it added so much flavor.

I made this for dinner tonight (previewing it for a dinner party we're hosting next weekend) and we really enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe to a T and the next time I make it, I will change a few things.  I will increase the amount of green onion and I will decrease the amount of butter/flour combination (roux).  We found the soup a little thick for our taste, but apart from these two things, it's a great recipe.

Great recipe.  Will make again, but invite more people over to eat.  It makes a ton!  I'm sure the leftovers will be wonderful.

This recipe is delicious.  I used butter instead of margerine.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It probably does take a bit more time to prepare than the recipe states.

This was ok.  It was bland like some of the other reviews mentioned, so we smothered each serving with extra cheese, bacon, sour cream and onions, just like a loaded baked potato.  I followed the recipe except for substituting bacon fat for the butter.  I didn't peel the potatoes or mash them up all the way so it was more chunky, but by the next day the leftovers were basically just mashed potatoes.  I've had baked potato soup that was more flavorful, and this wasn't quite it.  If I decided to make this again, I would probably try one of the other Baked Potato Soup recipes on this site, or else cut the potatoes and milk in half or double the other ingredients.  By the way, if you want a great recipe with "loaded baked potato" taste, try the Baked Potato Salad I recipe on this site :)

I am a huge fan of anything w/potatoes, but this didn't thrill me at all. My family liked it, but perhaps they just didn't want to hurt my feelings (there were leftovers that I had to discard). I followed the recipe as written, and kept tasting the soup to see if I needed to adjust and improve the flavors. The final product was bland. I won't make this again.

Fabulous!  Tasted better than from a restaurant.  I mashed the potatoes while cooking and it turned out very thick and creamy.  Also cut extra onions, cheese and bacon to garnish each bowl.

The ultimate comfort food!! I have made this several times and it is always a great success. I have made a few alterations to suit our tastes. I use 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup sour cream and chives, 3 more green onions, 2 cups of cheese, and a full pound of bacon.

We make this soup often - a great comfort food!  You have to be careful that the milk doesn't scorch on the bottom and it sometimes requires more salt.  This is also good with chunks of ham instead of bacon.  My whole family loves this soup - and we have some picky eaters!

Tasted great.  Maybe a little too thick.  I didn't have sour cream but did have french onion sour cream dip.  I used less of this and it gave it nice flavor.

Okay, so I used all the ingredients mentioned in the recipe, but assembled the soup differently.  I didn't saute the green onions or make a roux, instead I dumped the potatoes, milk, a bouillon cube and 1/4 cup margarine in the pot, brought it to boiling and then stirred in 1/4 cup flour mixed with 1/2 cup milk.  Boy am I glad I didn't add any more flour, it was perfect in this amount.  I also used 2.5 teaspoons salt and had the green onions, bacon and cheese so we could put in as much as we each pleased.  This made a very delicious soup that was inexpensive and pretty healthy because I used low fat dairy ingredients including margarine, as well as turkey bacon!  Thanks, we both liked this and look forward to the leftovers!

This was a great recipe.  I used the bacon grease instead of the margarine/butter to make the roux, and only used about 1/2 cup of the flour.  The soup was plenty thick with the smaller amount of flour.  I didn't have leftover baked potatoes, so cubed potatoes and boiled them. I put about half the cubs in the soup, and mashed the rest to make the soup more of a "slurry" with fewer actual potato chunks.  It was phenomenal...with plenty for leftovers.

I thought this was very bland until I added chicken soup base.  I also used half the amount of flour and still had to thin with milk.  I doubled the green onions.  It was very good after the changes!!

This was so creamy and so tasty(wow).
I used half the bacon and used soya milk, and fat free sourcream. 
Will make this again, but not too often because I like to watch my fat intake.

I thought this recipe was very good especially for the little time involved. I didn't have any bacon, so I omitted that all together. I added some oregano and cayenne pepper. I will definetly make this again.

Yeah, finally a soup I can make that tastes great.  Like others, I added 2 cups half and half and 5 cups milk and to make it even more fattening I added some of the bacon grease, my mouth didn't complain, but my hips will.

This is such good comfort food. My kids loved it and so did I. I left out the bacon for my veggie daughter and substitited dried miced onion for the scallions since I had them on hand. Also used a blend of sharp cheddar and colby-jack since I didn't have enough of either. This will be perfect for those cold winter evening s after a day in the snow. Thank you.

Great recipe.  I also saved my potato peels and cubed about 1/2 of them and added to the soup.

Absolutely delicious, but a little thick.  Next time I think I'll add a little more milk.

We each this all the time.  My kids (who don't like soup) will eat it by dipping rolls or bread in it, then eating the potatoes.

I'm not sure what this would have been like if I made as directed, but I loved it after some modifications. Cut cheese, sour cream, & bacon amounts in half, used sm/med red potatoes (with skins), & added homemade chicken broth to thin a bit. Added the crumbled bacon & green onions as topping & it was perfect. I also adjusted the recipe to make this "For 3", but ended up with more like 5-6 servings. Great for freezing! Thanks!

This tastes even better the next day. I like to add diced celery and carrots. I usually microwave them until tender and then add to the soup. A family request on cold winter days! :)

Excellent!  I didn't have the green onions, so I just left them out.  I added some extra cheese just because I wanted to use up what I had.  And instead of cheddar, I used monterey jack, although I am sure it would be great with cheddar, too, but I wanted a milder flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this with skepticism.  Everyone loved it! And now I am being asked to make it weekly.  The best suggestion is to "truly" bake the potatoes.  I also decided to use a half/half mixture of shredded mild cheddar and monterey jack.  Additionally used some of bacon fat in the roux for more flavor.  Truly wonderful soup!

Nice recipe...I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added garlic and thyme...I left out the cheese, though. It is very creamy and thick (watch out that it doesn't stick to the pan...has to be stirred alot!

This is an excellent recipe.  I gave it 4 stars only because I felt it was bland - had to jazz it up with spices.  Definitely a keeper.

The best potato soup that I've ever made.  The only addition to this recipe from me was to increase the cheese by 1 cup and I added some garlic salt and thyme.  The smokey flavor of the bacon was a great addition to what is normally a pretty bland soup.

Would have given it 5 stars but my children were not fond of it.  DH and I thought it was wonderful, and so easy.  I only made half the recipe and we had leftovers.  Lots of soup here.

I am giving this recipe five stars as is, because it is absolutely delicious and the family loves it. If there are leftovers, they often thicken in the fridge but can be reconstituted with a little milk when reheated.

I have made some adaptations over time because I no longer use the recipe while cooking this, but I do think it tastes great as written.
- I peel and chop raw potatoes and boil them instead of baking
- usually omit green onions because the kids pick them out anyway
- time-permitting, keep the soup simmering for at least an hour instead of bringing to a boil
- if I do bring it to a boil, I stir CONSTANTLY, not frequently, as it frequently burns to the bottom of the pan very quickly
- garnish with a little shredded cheese, bacon, and green onions to make it pretty :)

Very good. Husband even liked it. Didn't have baked potatoes so I boiled some (with skins left on) with some garlic. I also didn't salt or pepper as much, left to individual palates. I added some garlic powder as well.  I added all other ingredients except the green onion. Used that as a garnish for the added crunch as well as extra cheese.

Pretty good.  The cheese made an odd (grainy?) sort of texture when stirred in, but still tasty.  The green onions were wonderful for flavor and a little bit of color. Next time I think I'll just sprinkle the cheese on top of each bowl and let it melt, instead of stirring it in.

This is the best potato soup recipe because its simple and doesnt contain anything thats not needed. Ive made this twice, the first time with boiled potatoes because i was on a time limit and the second with baked potatoes with the skins left on. Both times ive used less butter, flour and milk to make it chunkier and more stew like. This is a great staple for my family.

Excellent format for a recipe!  I used 5 cups milk and 2 cups of half and half mixed with evaporated milk.  Turned out very good!  My husband asked me to start making it twice a month!  It's VERY rich, I'll probably go easier on the butter next time!

This was SO yummy.  I was even able to get my children to eat some.  However the fat content doesn't lend itself to a frequently made recipe.  Worth keeping on hand for special occasions.

I made this for our christmas eve celebration and it was a big hit!!  Even the pickiest eaters took seconds.  After reading some reviews I made some similar changes.  I fried up the bacon and then used the drippings only as we don't eat meat on christmas eve.  I substituted 7 cups of milk for 3 cups of chicken broth, 3 cups of half and half and 1 cup of heavy cream.  It was great!!!  I will definitely be making this again.

This soup was pretty great!  I messed it up by having the heat up a little too far, so the bottom got burned.  But other than that it was excellent!  Great texture & consitancy... nice and thick!!  My only suggestion is to add more cheese and maybe less green onion... I like mine super cheesy!

This recipe was great! I only made a few minor modifications. I used more potatoes and boiled them in 4 cups of chicken broth, which I substituted for some of the milk ( I didn't have enough milk for 7 cups). I then added a little Velveeta (about 2/3 cup), some garilc salt and onion powder. It was fabulous! My husband wasn't feeling well and requested potato soup, and I'm so glad I found this recipe. We both loved it!!! Thanks for sharing! :-)

Really good. Only made a few changes to the recipe. Used half bacon grease and half butter to sautee the flour in...gave a little bit more bacony taste. I also only used 6 slices of bacon. I used diced yello onion instead of the green onions. I added them with potatos, but looking back I should have sauteed them with flour becuase they were still crunchy. Definitely needed more salt than recipe called for. It is yummy, but I'm afraid to look the fat and calories this soup contains!

I have always made a cheese potato soup that is divine! But for the first time I dared to try a new recipe in our home and this one is right up there with mine! I think I will switch back and forth! Great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic.
I went right by the directions and add a bit of carot and garlic! Is was great enough to call homemade passed down from generation to generation. ( if You want to add flare).

The soup was excellent! I ended up doubling the amount of potatoes, cheese, and bacon but didn't have room to double the milk.  It came out fantastic! Could use a little celary.

Definitely cut the flour as this soup thickens considerably!  In addition, I served the soup and the onions were still crunchy, so cook for 20 minutes...not 10.

It's the best for a reason! Save time by using pre-moistened bacon bits. I LOVE cheese- so we add more. Everyone will enjoy this soup- its a family favorite! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! One tip: Keep stirring, or turn the burner down, otherwise you'll burn your soup! If you do, just don't scrap the bottom and it will still turn out YUMMMMMY!

Having never made soup before, I was a little daunted by the idea of making a roux and cooking through the thickening process, but all came out fine. I did reduce flour and butter to 1 cup each, as suggested by other reviewers; even so, this soup did come out extremely thick. I used ~ a cup more cheese (sharp cheddar) than called for, and increased salt & pepper and added both minced garlic and garlic salt, but it still came out a little bland. The bacon helped some with flavor. Also, I was happy to discover peeling baked potatoes once cooled was as easy as peeling raw onces with a knife--I expected it to be far messier/difficult.

I took a few short cuts and that may have make it not as good as i though it would have been.  i sued pre-cooked bacon to save time and engery.  I also cooked the potatoes in the mircowave.  With all the fat, I thought this was have had more taste.  I might try again.

Excellent soup for a chilly day. Only change I made was using a smoked cheddar. Just my preference. I like a thick soup but this was a tad too thick. Will add a little more liquid than called for next time. Thanks for the recipe Sherry!

This warmed me right up on a damp, cold night. Very thick, so don't be afraid to add more milk if thick isn't your preference. I used chives instead of green onions, because then it was like a reall baked potato! My family like this a lot, the flavors meld perfectly.

Great soup, But did alter the recipe: I used ground sausage instead of the bacon, decreased flour to 1/2 cup, I used southern style hashbrowns so I didn't have to chop the potatoes, I added a can of chicken broth, added pearl onions in with the potatoes,and put in a few dashes of tobasco sauce to add a little zip.

Kind of disspaointed by the lack of FLAVOR. Was good but definitely not a 4 or 5 star. You'd think with bacon and 7 CUPS of milk and all that margarine you'd get more taste. Sad.You could probably find a better recipe.

First Time:This was very good.  According to other reviewers I used less flour, only 1/4 of a cup.  And to save time I used frozen hash browns instead of baked potatoes.  Next time I will add more salt than what this recipe calls for.  Second time: Made according to instructions except I used raw potatoes instead of baked...a thick and delicious soup.

An easy, quick soup.  I followed the suggestion of others and cut the butter/flour mixture in half.  I'm glad I did.  I really like thick soups, but this was plenty thick cut in half.  I don't really see how it could have gotten much thicker without just being gloppy.

This recipe was awesome! My family loved it. It had a really great consistency. I used red potatoes and left the skins on, and it was nice.

Very thick and very yummy.  A big hit with my husband and friends.  I have used ham on occasion instead of bacon with excellent results too.  Great recipe!

This was excellent soup. I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely make it again. I think there was too much milk. I will probably use less next time. It had an excellent flavor. It was fairly quick and easy. Not to much totally good for my figure (snicker, snicker). I loved it!!!!!

I love this recipe. I made it one cold winter morning. It hit the spot. Even my husband, who isn't fond of soup, loved it and asked me to make another batch the next weekend. I've taken it to a covered lunch at work...It was a hit. I will definitely make this again!

This soup was incredibly thick!  I thought it needed only 3 potatoes and more bacon and cheese.  When I reheated the soup the next night, I added about 2 cups of water to try to thin it out and it was much better.  Also thought that it needed more seasoning so added seasoning salt and more pepper.

Perfect for a cold winter day.  It's a little time consuming to make, but it has an excellent taste.  I followed the recipe exactly except I smooshed most of the potato pieces to make it thicker.  I don't even want to think about the calorie content, but it sure is good.

Pretty standard, but pretty good too.  A very, very thick soup.  I'm not a big fan of bacon, but it definitely made a difference in this soup.

This soup is very yummy!  I followed the recipe and added some of the potato skins, paprika, and parsley.  I took the advice of another reviewer and made it the day before.  Tasted great reheated!  My 1 year old couldn't get enough of this.  It did make a lot so I'm going to freeze it (hope it freezes well!).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This one is a family favorite...love, love, love it! I usually throw in a couple of extra potatoes, and I add an extra teaspoon of salt. If I'm feeling lazy, I'll use packaged bacon pieces (from the salad section of the grocery store). This makes lots of leftovers, and it reheats pretty well.

This si one of the BEST recipes I've ever gotten from this site.  It was thick and very creamy.  I added double the amount of bacon, and would suggest the same to anyone I recommend this recipe to.  The great thing is, unlike an actual baked potato, you are sur eto get the full flavor in every bite, so this soup is actually far better than an actual potato.  All in all, this recipe is a huge winner and will be made many more times in my kitchen.

This recipe is AWESOME! I didn't have any green onions, so I chopped up a half of a small yellow onion and sauteed it before adding it to the soup. I used one percent milk, light sour cream and reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese. Will I make this soup again--you bet!

Very thick, rich potato chowder.  My three children and husband loved it, too!  I have 2 lactose-intolerant in the family, so I used 5 c. Lactaid (all I had) and 2 c. regular milk.  I couldn't tell any difference.  No one had any stomach problems after dinner.  This is a keeper!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  My family and I found it very bland.  However, after adding more spices my husband thought it was "not too bad".  The kids general lack of enthusiasm means that I will probably not use this particular recipe again.

This was a great recipe, and very versitile.  I experimented by adding some chicken broth, sauteed onions & celery, and some bacon grease and the result was very good.  We had company and everyone enjoyed this soup.

Great restaraunt quality soup!  I made this for a soup cook off at work, and out of 8 soups it placed third.  It probably would have placed higher, but everyone was buying bowls of it and it was gone in only 10 minutes!

i made this recipe the first cold day of the season.  it was a great comfort food for a dreary day.  instead of using all of that butter i used some of the bacon fatin addition to half of the butter called for.  it made the recipe more flavorful.

This soup was good, but seemed to be lacking in something.  I'm not sure what, it was just a little bland.  Maybe double the sour cream and cheese and it would be better.  I will give this recipe another try with those modifications.

This is the best!!!! I can't believe some reviews called it bland.  It was super tasty, as thick as a good chowder, and very filling.  Perfect to whip up on a cool evening- takes no time at all if you've got leftover baked potatoes.  A definate keeper for this family, thank you!

This is, without a doubt, the best of the best recipes for potato soup.  I've never even tasted soup this good at my favorite "potato soup" restaurant.  It was also a hit with my entire family who won't even eat a milk-base soup.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!  Paula

wonderful soup, i'm still playing around with other recipes, but i may come back to this one if no others work out. this is very much like a baked potato, and i really want something that i can add bacon, chives, cheese and sour cream to only when i feel ilke it. it froze wonderfully though, and leftovers were also great (very important for soup i think)!! Also i cut back on the amount of sour cream when i make it.

Great soup.  I just added a little more flour and some corn starch because I was afraid it wouldn't thicken enough.  It turned out perfectly.  I also microwaved the potatoes beforehand since I didn't have any left over baked potatoes.  I don't think it makes that much of a difference.  Wonderful recipe.  May use a little more cheese next time but that is just my DH's preference.  I thought it was perfect as is.

We gave this recipe 2 tries and modified it just a smidge. 
 If you're at all sensitive to dairy, don't have this with milk. It makes all the difference in not having a stomachache from the abundance of milk.  
 We've tried it using crispy bacon and soft bacon - the soft bacon wins hands down. We used half a pound and will increase it to a full pound next time!
 Lots of cheddar cheese! We sprinkle a good serving on every bowl each time. 
 It reheats well in the microwave.
 We completely omitted the green onion the second time and didn't miss it!

This soup was WONDERFUL! It tastes just like the restaurant baked potato soup! It got a little thick after sitting, but it was very easy just to add some milk when reheating. In fact, I think it was better reheated because I could add more cheese and sour cream to the top! It was a little time consuming the first time, but it was definitely worth it. I think it would also be helpful to bake the potatoes and fry the bacon ahead of time. I will make this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

Good flavor, but the sour cream and milk separated towards the end of cooking.  Maybe I had the heat too high?  Will try again though.

Very quick and easy to make.  My 9 year old, who never likes anything, asked for seconds and wanted to know when I would make it again!  The only change would be to add more seasonings as it was somewhat bland and needed more salt.

Too good to be true!  I roasted a whole onion and a clove of garlic along with the potatoes then added them to the soup and fished them out later.  I substituted a little Velveeta.  I used 3 chicken boullion cubes (pototoes need a lot of salt!).  Don't forget to sufficiently cook the roux.  We also served the green onions, cheddar cheese, sour cream and bacon all as pick-and-choose garnishes.  Loved, loved, loved this creamy, hearty soup.

This was awesome!  My husband and 2yr old loved it.  I didn't use baked potatoes because I forgot but cooked them in a skillet with some of the bacon grease and added a little mrs dash seasoning.  It turned out great!!  I will make this again.  It is a little different from the way I normally make potato soup but was a nice change!

This hit the spot.  It was very cold last night,andI thought this would be perfect for dinner.  It's not the type of thing I cook often, because you have to pretty much be standing over the soup the whole time it's cooking.  The only change I will make next time is to season it up a little more.  As is, it's a little bland, but added some Montreal Steak Seasoning and that jazzed it right up.  Also, I'll use more potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I thought the recipe was fantastic. I have served it to friends who like it better than cheders soup. This recipe was the easiest of ones I tried while maintaining top flavor. The only change I make for personal taste is 8-10 potatoes.

This soup was very tasty. I used 10 slices of bacon because that is all there was in the package, however, next time I would use more. I also added a bit more flour to thicken the soup.

This is one of the best soups I have ever made--and I have been making a lot of soup lately.  My boyfriend and I have eaten it for three meanls since making it yesterday, and I suspect it will all be gone tomorrow. I even goofed while making it (I forgot to add the second 1/3 of flour...and had a very thin roux...felt pretty stupid when I realized it, but i added corn starch and it was fine).  I like to add a little shredded cheese and green onion to the individual bowls. Thanks

Tastes great, it is more like twice baked potato soup than anything.  I did add 1/2 t garlic powder and 3 T Grated Parmesan cheese.

This was a very good recipe.  My kids, husband and mother loved it.  I didn't add as much flour as the recipe asked for and I used salt and pepper to taste.  Next time I will make sure my potatoes are more mashed up than in chunks I would like it a little thinner.  Other than that it was very tasteful and delicious , very good for the cold wheather in Michigan.  I also used hormel bacon bits (taste the same as bacon on the stove).

This was wonderful!  Was the first time I made a cream based soup.  I did take others advice and reduced margarine & flour to 1/2 cup, increased milk (1%) by 1 cup, and reduced pepper to 1/2 tsp.  

My only complaint is it took longer than stated - more like an hour and 15 minutes.  It took me over 15 minutes just to get the sauce to thicken.

But it was worth it!  Took it to work for a luncheon and everyone loved it.

My husband and I both love it!  Very easy to make and very filling.  I forgot to buy bacon one time and it was fine without too.  We do like to garnish with some extra cheese though and typically use the four cheese blends you find at the grocery.

Fantastic recipe.  Even my kids eat it, and they're very picky.  I save some of the ingredients out to sprinkle over the top of each bowl -- onions, bacon bits, and cheese.  It is a little time consuming, but worth it!

I liked this soup but it's more of a chowder.  Be sure to NOT burn the milk when you boil it.  There's nothing worse than tasting burned milk in your soup.  I agree that it's a little labor intensive for this recipe to be under KIDS but no biggie.  It could be more flavorful so I would suggest adding paprika/chili powder, etc. to give it that extra kick.  I live in California where the weather is always mild so this soup doesn't have to always be prepared in the winter, cold months.

Thank you!

To make this recipe low-fat, or at least lower than it was intended, I omit the bacon and use fat-free or light ingredients.  I also use 4-5 cups of milk instead of 7.

This soup was very tasty, but like 2 reviewers before me, I thought the soup needed more liquid and not as much pepper.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is good and notoo hard to make, bt I would advise everyone to back off from he pepper a bit.  The first te I made it I was gnerous withhe pepper, but the second time I made sure I added only the PRECISE amount caled for, but it was still too peppery-- that takes away from the rest of the flvor f the soup o I coldn't tell if it really tasted like a baked potato or not.  God soup though-- I didn't use bacon, since I'm a vegetarian, I recomemend trying this-- it's good!  I will keep making this, bu will probbly cut the black pepper in half.

This recipe had a great base. It was very creamy. It was lacking some flavor, but still was very tasty. Maybe if the bacon is added in when the potatoes are that would help add a little.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that this soup is a bit too rich and too starchy.  I think next time I will try it with less flour, less sour cream, and use skim milk.  It is also a bit bland and might be better with some additional seasoning.

I've been trying to find the perfect potato soup recipe for a long time and this is it!!!  I don't think I used quite enough bacon, but it tasted great anyway.  The recipe makes a lot so I shared some with my boyfried and his kids.  They all loved it, and he's going to try making it himself, with chunks of ham instead of bacon.

This recipe is wonderful!  My teenage daughter had about 12 friends over for New Years this year and this was a great hit!  I made the Italian Bread Bowls and that's what they put the potato soup in.  They loved it!

There was hardley any flavor to this. I followed the directions, and it was soooo bland. Also, it doesn't really state how long the potatoes should cook. I did mind till they were tender, but i'm not sure if they should have been cooked longer.

Not going to make this again.

I thought this was good but no one else liked it-and my family loves soup as a rule.  It is a very expensive version of potato soup to make and I don't think the added expense is worth it.  My plain old potato soup is just as good.  I followed the recipe as it was written but dilluted it with a bit of chicken broth at the end because it was too thick for our taste. I think half milk and half chicken broth would have gotten the same taste.

This soup is tasty, although I know of recipes that taste similar without taking as much time to prepare.  I used WAY less than the 7 cups of milk because it seemed like a lot of dairy to me.  I substituted chicken broth for the rest of the liquid and it worked great.  I may try this again without the bacon and more cheese.

I just want to say that I've never made potato soup before.  I really wanted some, but not from a can. This soup is fantastic!  I didn't have cheese but it was still great.  I did use butter in place of margarine and added a couple of teaspoons of the bacon grease for added flavor.  This is a wonderful recipe!  Thank you Sherry!

This is GREAT!!  I made it exactly by the recipe. I did use only 3 potatoes 
because mine were so huge.  Next time I'd dice the potatoes a bit smaller.
I did add an extra 1/2 tsp salt.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

It is very good the first time.  But the leftovers were just good.  It seemed that the cheese maybe separated out a little and that gave it a weird texture.  Mind you this difference was very slight.

This is a very easy, quick recipe.  I used 1% milk and it was great.  If it gets too thick, I slowly added chicken broth over low heat to thin it out.  Very good, very rich.  I halved the recipe and it still made a lot of soup.

This recipe has turned me into a soup lover!  I only made soup once in my life before finding this, and now I'm hooked!  I have made this 3 times so far. To save time I microwave my potatoes, and use the bacon bits from the store.  Yummy!

This potato soup is EXCELLENT! I used half & half and milk. Very thick and rich. My family agrees that adding clams would have been an excellent addition. Another thought would be adding carrots and celery. Will definately keep this on my to do again list!!!

Yummy! I'm not big on bacon, so I added diced ham instead. Very good!

Tasted great, but found it to be too thick.  Maybe next time I'd use less flour or no flour at all.

My family absolutely raved about this soup!  The only modification that I'll make next round is to use less salt than the recipe calls for.  I don't use much when cooking and I think that the crumbled bacon would provide enough of flavor.

The kids wouldn't touch it, but what do they know?  My husband and I LOVED it!  I made some bread to go with it and it was a meal.  Combines all the flavors of a loaded baked potato into an extremely rich and creamy soup.  Fantastic!

Great, creamy soup! Modified the recipe slightly by adding lump crab meat and shrimp. Will have to make it all of the time now for my married children's families.

My boyfriend says this is the best potato soup he has ever eaten.  I have to agree with him on that - it was incredible.  I added extra cheese, bacon bits, and a dab of sour cream to mine after serving hot.  Yummy......
Thanks Sherry!

This soup was a little thick, however, it had a great taste & it was a great winter day lunch.  We also chose to put the cheese & onions on after the soup was finished. My husband & son loved it.  I will definately try this one again.

This has got to be the best potato soup I've ever tasted! I doubled the recipe, and I thickened it up a little more with some instant mashed potato flakes, and I used extra green onion.  My husband went crazy over it! I've made it twice already. Awesome recipe Sherry! Thanks for sharing it!

This is soooo good!  I added a little half & half to make it a little richer--mmmm,mmmm good.
I also made it for 20 people and it took a little longer than the prep time indicated.
It was a big hit and I loved it!

What a fantabulous way to celebrate the first "blustery' day of the season in California!  I was searching for a recipe I could easily put together with things I already had on hand and this was it!  The best part was that it certainly didn't taste like something I made out of convenience, more like a restaraunt meal! VERY delicious! I did add about a 1/2 teaspoon more salt, and a 1/2 cup more cheddar cheese.  I also included a pinch or so of Thyme.  I love it! I'm just hoping there are some leftovers for me to enjoy tomorrow once the family is done with supper tonight! I will be sure and double the recipe next time.  The only drawback was the constant stirring.  It took me quite a bit longer than the recipe stated to have this ready for the table. Of course I started from 'scratch' (no leftover baked potatoes) and next time I will cook the bacon in the microwave as well. OH! I also added one yellow onion in place of the green onion and sauteed it till transparent in a bit of bacon drippings before adding it to the pot. Next time maybe a bit of celery for additional texture.  I'm done now!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Very good but we prefer to individually add the sour cream, bacon, green onions and some of the cheese after we dish up. Makes a "pretty" bowl of soup.

This is an excellent cold day soup.  I found it far too thick. Next time I would either add at least two more cups of milk or cut down on the flour.  Tastes even better the second day!

Wonderful Soup. The bacon and sour cream adds a great flavor to it. I had some co-workers for lunch and they raved about it.

We boiled instead of baking the potatoes. This was awesome, very smooth and thick. A meal by itself.

This is an absolutely incredible recipe!  Talk about comfort food, I made mine in the summer for the first time, but can't wait to have it in the winter, cozied up to a fire with a good book.  Tastes an awful lot like Bennigan's Baked Potato Soup.

A "potluck favorite".  Made it with non-fat sour cream, fat-free cheddar cheese, and skim milk.  Came out wonderful.  Used six potatoes. Quick and easy.  Love it!

Yummy ! Needed a tad more salt for my taste, maybe more bacon next time. Very creamy, and very filling served with bread- a great alternative for dinner.

I tested this out while my family is out of town one night (they are pretty picky) and it was great.  It needed extra cheese added to the bowl, but was otherwise perfect.  My husband came home and ate some of the leftovers and loved it as well.  I'll definitely be trying this one out on the kids soon.

The final product makes this recipe worth making. It's FABULOUS!  One major drawback to making this recipe is having to constantly stir it for 1/2 hr so it souldn't burn.  I'd prefer to throw all the ingredients into a pot and let it cook. This recipe will not allow you to do that.

The soup was very good, although the first time I made it I thought it had a bit much sour cream.  The second time I made it I put about half as much sour cream as it called for.  My husband thought that it tasted fine the first time.  It warms up really well too. :)

This soup tastes wonderul!!  For a more creamy taste and no lumps of potatoes,
I used a electric hand blender to blend the soup before adding the bacon, cheese
and remaining ingredients.

YUM YUM!!!! I made this hearty soup for someone who had some dental work done. They loved it and so did my family. It fills you up great.I have made it two times using  whole milk both times instead of half and half and turns out great.

the first time i made the soup, i used the full cup of sour cream, but that was all you could really taste . . . the second time, i used half the amount, and in case you are like me and don't really care for sour cream, i suggest using half as well, so that it is not as potent.  even my finiky three year old sister loves it . . . and is mad that there isn't anymore, so i know this is a keeper.

Although delicious, I will not cook this soup again.  It is simply too rich. It was the texture of warm lard.  If I did cook it again, I would cut down the margarine that the recipe calls for, and almost halve the bacon.

Had to share more comments .... made this for a party over the weekend and the guests were scraping the bottom of the pot. Some people are "known" for a certain special dish -- I think this just may be mine. There's another party this weekend and guess what I'm bringing? :-)

I thought,"yeah, sure!" when I saw baked
potato soup and it was a pleasant 
surprise.  Rich and creamy.  Not so 
starchy as some potato soups 
I've tried.

This is a wonderful tummmy warmer on a cold night. My husband and son literally licked their bowls clean! Very easy and quick, especially since I used the microwave to cook the potatos and the bacon.

This is a delicious soup!  I brought some leftovers to a friend, and it was so good that her children wanted the soup for an after dinner snack instead of chocolate!

A great way to use up left over baked potatoes after a larger dinner party where you always cook too many.
