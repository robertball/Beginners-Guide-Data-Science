Fabulous!! I made this for my family last night and they all loved it! I changed a little to suit me though. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and then baked the chicken instead of pan-frying it. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. Then I layered shredded mozzarella on top and placed in the oven for 5 more minutes so it would melt. I took the advice of another reviewer and warmed the tomato and basil slightly in a skillet. Then I placed them on top of the chicken. My husband was raving all night. It is our new favorite meal and it is so easy!

This was EXCELLENT. Made a few modifications: didn't have any balsamic vinaigrette on hand so I made Mama's Balsamic Vinaigrette (on this website), which I highly recommend! Marinated chicken filets for 24 hours (poked holes in the chicken so they would absorb marinade even better). I put the whole thing - marinade and all (added a dash of Italian seasoning) - in a baking dish and put it in the oven for 30 min at 350. During the last ten minutes of cooking, I put tomato slices around the chicken in the pan so they would warm up and absorb some of the awesome flavor. During the last 5 minutes, I put mozzarella slices on the chicken so they would melt, along with dried basil sprinkled on top. I served it by pouring some of the leftover balsamic vinaigrette around the chicken and placed the tomatoes on top. It came out PERFECT. I will definitely make this over and over again - it was so easy, yet elegant, and it was incredibly tasty!

My family LOVES this recipe.  It is so easy to make, and tastes so fresh and "alive".  This recipe has become part of my regular repertoire.

10/09,2006:  Update:  I used the basis of this recipe with some fresh tilapia (white fish) and it was fabulous.  I marinated the fish in the balsamic vinegrette for about 45 minutes.  I lined a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil, and placed the fish on the foil.  I then covered the fish with shredded mozzarella and baked in a 425 F oven for 10 minutes, then broiled for 2-3 minutes until the cheese was golden and bubbly.  To make the remainder ingredients easier to eat with fish, I chopped the basil and diced the tomatoes before layering them on the top of each fish fillet.  Finally, I sprinkled with additional balsamic vinegar and served.  YUM YUM!!!  Thanks again, this is one we make all the time!

OMG- I read these reviews and I was just horrified- does no one understand cooking? every single review I read turned this into some kind of psuedo chicken parm "thing".  The recipe is meant to be as instructed it is warm chicken with A cold ensalade caprese on top.  the warm of the chicke and the cold of the salad are meant to be- to heat them destroys the entire meal. this is something I happen to make often-  i usually grill the chicken, but pan frying works well-  if you are going to try this recipe don't alter the process, or you are just wasting your time

A very good recipe for chicken. I didn't have time for a lot of marinating so put the dressing in a bag with the chicken for 1/2 hour at room temperature. To ensure there was enough flavour I pan fried the chicken for a few minutes per side (until golden brown) and then transferred the pan to the oven adding a few tbsp of the marinade. I cooked it for 20 minutes at 350 degees. Taking the advice of others I shredded the mozzarella and put it on the chicken at the end of the cooking time letting it bake for several more minutes to melt the cheese. I chopped the basil and tomato and heated it in the microwave putting it over the chicken before serving. Delicious.

AWESOME!! WHEN I READ THIS RECIPE I JUST THOUGHT IT LOOKED KINDA BLAH I TRIED IT ANYWAYS CUZ IT SEEMED SO EASY & I HAVE A NEW FAVORITE! I MARINATED FOR 24 HOURS & INSTEAD OF JUST SETTING THE LEAF & TOMATO SLICE ON THE CHICKEN I CHOPPED THE BASIL A BIT & MIXED W/ THE SLICED TOMATOES IN THE PAN OVER MEDIUM HEAT. JUST LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE THE BASIL GOOD FLAVOR BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH TO LOSE THE SHAPE OF THE TOMATO. WILL PROBABLY MAKE THIS ONCE A MONTH!

A really nice robust meal to make without that much hassel. I dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with minced garlic rosemary and oregano before sauting. Added a clover of minced garlic to the balsamic vinegar before drizzling it over the chicken. Served with Italian bread and a tossed salad.

I seem to be having a "daily recipe" day. Perusing through todays recipe's I thought I would give this a whirl along with the candied carrots from today's "daily's". Pounded out the chicken breast this morning and put them into the marinade. I have to admit I had hoped for more time than 12 hours but it still managed to permeate the chicken admirably. I made this exactly as stated with the exception that I grilled the chicken. 12 hours seemed a little weak which is why this is given 4 stars. Helpful hint: Let the chicken marinate as long as you can to let the full flavor shine through. Thank you TVMovieGirl!

I am a big fan of caprese salad (tomato and fresh mozzarella) and this recipe is exactly that but with chicken added. Reading some reviews here about melting the mozzarella cheese leads me to believe some people are not using the correct kind of cheese. You must use FRESH WATER PACKED mozzarella or in a pinch can use the plastic wrapped fresh mozzarella but even that is a bit too dry and hard for caprese. Shredded dry mozzarella will not work in this recipe. I modified slightly by using thin cut chicken breasts which cuts down the cooking time for a quick and easy meal. I also threw in some pine nuts when cooking the chicken. Instead of drizzling the balsamic vinegar over the assembled top I marinated the tomatoes in the vinegar while I cooked the chicken. I don't recommend marinating the mozzarella as it absorbs the brown coloring and will taste fine but ruin the presentation. This makes a great light meal served with a ceasar salad and breadsticks.

Wow this dish was amazing! So light and refreshing yet packed with flavor! I took the suggestions of others and made a few tweaks. I marinated my chicken in Newman's Light Balasamic Vinagrette overnight (roughly 21 hours) and poked holes in the chicken with a fork to help it absorb the marinade. I "browned" the chicken for 4 min on each side before putting in a dish with the marinade and baking for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. While the chicken was baking I mixed some extra virgin olive oil with italian seasoning and dipped the fresh mozzarella slices (water-packed) in the mixture for extra flavor. With 5 minutes of baking time left I added the sliced tomatoes to the dish (laid in the marinade) and placed the cheese on top of the chicken to warm. It melted the perfect amount (still held its shape but was warm and a little gooey). After baking I placed the freshed basil (snipped into small pieces)on top of the cheese and placed the tomato slices on top. It was excellent! I had one piece left over for lunch the next day and it warmed up beautifully! Definitely recommend this recipe!

so simple & so good! I made a balsamic vinegeratte (1/2 balsamic vinegar 1/2 olive oil oregano thyme basil & pepper). I then cooked the chicken on the grill and the last few minutes of cooking added the basil tomato & fresh mozzerella. Great easy & elegant! Thanks for sharing!

Wow! Excellent recipe. I added garlic and dried basil to the marinade and then baked the chicken IN the marinade in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes. During the last 5 minutes I added the cheese and basil and then about 2 minutes before it was done I added the tomato so everything was warm. B/F and I both LOVED it! Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't care for this like I thought I would. Could have been the modifications I made. I didn't have whole breasts so I used strips. I marinated and coated with Italian Panko before frying. I layered everything in a pan and put in oven just to melt the cheese. They only flavor I got from the dish was the Panko (thank goodness I used it) and the tanginess of the tomatoes. It wasn't bad but just not a 4 or 5 star dish in my opinion.

Very easy to follow!! My kids asked if we could have this every week!! I made a few changes. I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours. I then put it in the oven at 365 degrees for about 35 minutes. I took it out and put the cheese on top of the breasts for about 5 minutes. I took it out once again and put the basil and tomatoes on it. I turned on the broiler for about 3 minutes. This gave the cheese a brown crust. It was very moist and tasty! Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome summer dish - family loves this one! We often grill or bake the chicken which works just as well. In addition rather than placing a slice of cheese and tomato on top of the chicken will dice the tomato chop the basil cube fresh mozzarella and mix with balsamic to create a "salad of all of the toppings and generously spoon over the chicken. Good stuff!

Excellent! I marinated the chicken in Mama's Balsamic Vinaigrette as suggested by another reviewer. I used my grill pan to cook the chicken and when it was almost done I melted the cheese on top. I also sauted the basil grilled some sub rolls and made a dressing out of mayo garlic more of the fresh basil and olive oil (in the food processor). My husband said it was one of the best sandwiches he has ever had and I would agree. Thanks for a new favorite!

I made this for us and another couple for dinner one night and everyone loved it. I personally thought the flavor of balsamic was a little strong and would leave off any additional balsamic after the marinade. I took the advice of many reviewers and made these changes. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and then baked the chicken. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. Then I layered shredded mozzarella on top and placed in the oven for 5 more minutes so it would melt. I warmed the tomato and basil slightly in a skillet. Then I placed them on top of the chicken. I also drizzled balsamic on top and that is what I will not do next time.

I give this recipe five stars because it was not only tasteful but so easy to make. It tastes like you spent way more time preparing it than it takes. The fresh mozzarella was delicious however it does not quite melt as thoroughly as shredded mozzarella would have. Next time I will use shredded to give it a more thorough consistency.

I follow this recipe to a T...except that I bake the marinated chicken breasts 30 minutes in a convection oven at 350 degrees...I call it Insalata Caprese Chicken...it is an amazing dish when you have fresh basil and tomatoes in the garden during the summer!

This is a very easy simple and delicious recipe! Instead of frying in pan on stove top I cooked marinated chicken in 350 degree oven for 25 minutes. Then I topped chicken with tomato then mozzarella cheese in casserole dish drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt pepper and basil plus italian seasoning and put in oven for 7 minutes. YUM!

Thanks so much!:o)

We enjoyed this recipe. Only made very small changes. After cooking the chicken I put it on our plates and put the chopped tomato (which I had soaked in the basalmic vinegrette) and chopped mozzerella on top of the chicken. Then sprinkled dried basil on top (didn't have the fresh) Very good will make again!

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT -- I did not pan fry the chicken. I did cook it on my grill placed it on a serving platter and following the rest of instructions to a tee. I did top off tomatoes with a little feta cheese. Presentation was great and taste was great! Served it with baked potato (on grill) with corn on the cob (grill). Definitely a keeper!

I have been making this recipe for years. I marinate the chicken in sun dried tomato dressing chop the tomatoes and basil and mix with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I bake the chicken for 20-25 minutes then top with the tomato mixture and bake another 5-10 minutes till the cheese melts. I serve this with Capellini Caprese from this site. One of my hubby's favourites.

This was fabulous!! I browned it on the stove after marinating for 24 hours with balsamic garlic vinagar salad dressing. Turned heat down and let chicken simmer till cooked through. Put some shredded motz cheese and frest tomato from my garden and sprigs of basil from my garden. Served on a bed of spinach. So good and healthy.

This was very good I made it for my daughter and a friend and we all loved it I followed the recipe not sure why everyone has to change it the first time they try a new recipe. I can certainly understand making changes after you've at least tried to make it the way it was originally but saying how great it was but I made all these changes to me defeats the purpose of the original recipe.

Dear TVMovie Girl--This was a great concept. I always like to bake chicken instead of frying it because 1) it is more healthy 2) it requires less attention and 3) it is easier to clean up. So I after marinating I poured off the marinade I baked the breasts at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. Then I layered on the tomato slices basil and mozz and broiled for 3-4 minutes until golden. Excellent!

YUMMY!! My boyfriend and I loved it very much. I took advice from others and baked the chicken in the marinade instead of pan-frying it. I did not have fresh basil so used dried one. Also used mix shredded cheese instead of only Mozzarella. It turned out nicely! My boyfriend loved the marinade and actually drank some of it and used it as a bread dip. Will make this a regular dish.

Wow I loved this! I marinated the chicken for 24 hours. It was so tender and tasty. I shredded the mozarella as some reviewers suggested and also chopped the basil. Broiled it just long enough to get the cheese gooey. Definitely a winner! Quick easy and delish.

There wasn't that much flavor here though a nice idea. I would rather stick with keeping the mozzarella and tomatoes together as a salad (insalata caprese) and leaving the chicken by itself.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I made Mama's Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site for the marinade (deelish) and used roma tomatoes. I only marinated for about 5 hours so I baked the chicken in the marinade at 350 degrees F until temp reached 150 degrees (about 40 mins for thick breasts). Then I covered the dish with foil and let rest for 10 minutes. I followed the rest of the recipe topping with fresh mozzarella fresh basil and roma tomatoes and served. The cheese melted slightly from the heat of the chicken and it was perfect! Very refreshing and full of flavor! Next time I will plan ahead and marinate the full time and then cook as directed! Thanks again for a wonderful dish!

I've been making chicken with this marinade for years and it is absolutely delicious 5 stars. I use good seasons dressing mix and use balsamic for the vinegar. In the summer I BBQ the chicken on low for 8 minutes per side and add the slice of tomatoe(or even roasted red peppers--which I like more) and top with the mozz cheese and let that sit for 1 more minute on the grill til it just melts alittle...and boy does my family and guests love me. Don't pass this up. Any cooking method this turns out delicious.

I followed the advice of a previous review and tried this recipe with fish. I used salmon instead of tilapia and dried basil-all I had in the house. It was very good. I also used a recipe from this website Mama's Balsamic Vinaigrette to marinate. It was awesome! I can't wait to try it with chicken also.

The taste was ok but I wasn't thrilled with the way it all came together. This may just be a personal preference but I'm not a big fan of eating chicken breasts smothered in melted cheese. Would have loved a much higher ratio of vegetables to the meat & cheese.

This was my first time having fresh mozarella and I wasn't sure what to expect. I found the fresh cheese to be very flavorless actually but when eaten with the chicken tomatoes and basil it wasn't bad. I do think next time I will doctor this up with some seasonings and more balsamic vinegar. Or else maybe a different cheese. Garlic goat cheese maybe?

Great recipe! We've had it several times since I discovered the recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the chicken with the marinade at 350 for 30 minutes. I then added the slice of mozzarella and broiled until melted topped with tomato and basil just before serving. I could eat it multiple times a week!

This is really delicious. It's easy to make and sure to impress company. I scaled it way back because there are only two of us. I was afraid the 19 hours I marinated the chicken would make the flavor too strong but it really didn't. I also warmed the assembled dish briefly in the oven warm up the tomato and cheese a bit. Really an excellent dish.

This was great. Very easy to make and quite tasty. I didn't melt the cheese - put it on top like a caprese salad, which I think was the original intention, and it was fabulous. One thing - it didn't take nearly 30 minutes to cook in the skillet, more like 15, since I had thin chicken breasts. 30 minutes and they would have been cooked to death.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I tweaked it a bit though. I used boneless/skinless thighs instead of breasts (simply because I needed to use them.) They didn't take as long to cook of course. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a whole drained can of Rotel. That added some nice zest to the recipe. I used a generous portion of shredded mozzarella (a 2 Cup bag) instead of sliced. I served it over pasta. It was really good and I like the lightness of the meal.

This was excellent. On the advice of others I diced up a tomato and threw in some chopped up basil. I love balsamic so I also splashed some more on the chicken. When the chicken was almost done I put the mixture on top of the chicken then put the mozz. on top of that. Definately will make again!

I don't think I follow directions very well on this one. I don't really understand how it's supposed to look like the picture. Regardless the flavor combination was good but I found the balsamic overwhelming. My son liked it though and that's important. I will need to play with this one a little more to figure out how to make it better because it seems like a really good recipe. go figure.

I marinated chicken tenders in a bottle of dressing for 2 days. I browned them in a skillet then placed them in the oven for about 15 minutes. I covered them with fresh basil then mozzarella and baked until the cheese melted. We had this with angel hair pasta. Be sure to use some of the juice that cooks out of the chicken on your pasta.

I left off the basil and tomatoes which may have been a mistake. The chicken was still great but the cheese was a little bland and diluted the flavors. This would either taste great without the cheese at all or definitely WITH the cheese with basil and tom. I'll try it again and see what happens.

What a great gourmet-tasting recipe! I added some garlic and italian seasoning to the marinade and also used some fancy fig flavored balsamic instead of regular. I threw the chicken in a dish with the marinade and baked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes as another reviewer suggested. It came out so great! The marinade caramelized nicely and the tomato mozzarella and basil really complimented all of the flavors.

These are such great ingredients that it's probably tough to mess it up. I didn't plan very well and ended up marinating for only about 3 hours. When reading some of these reviews I decided it would be a good idea to poke some holes in the chicken and add some garlic...also marinated at room temperature. I had thighs on hand...not breasts. I took off the skin and de-boned which was not too difficult. I chopped the tomatoes and followed another reader by baking at 350 for 1/2 hour putting grated mozzarella on for about 5 minutes and then the tomato and basil under the broiler for another 4 minutes. Turned out great!

Wow. My husband even liked this and he rarely comments on meals even if they are very good. So this is a keeper! Very good combo of flavors--perfect for entertaining. The only thing I did differently was that I browned the chicken in some olive oil in the skillet and then baked them to cook through.

I liked it better than hubby but will make a few changes next time. We won't slice the chicken as because it was to hard to keep basil moz & tomato on. Next I won't use fresh moz pearls but slices of moz. Because I did those things so it could be presented nicely the chicken had a cool taste instead of being hot. Liked the flavors.

My husband loved this dish! After marinating I emptied the vinaigrette and used fresh dressing. I cooked it on the stove top for 15 minutes then in the oven for another 25 minutes (I used thick filets). with 5 minutes left I put fresh mozzarella on the chicken and sauteed the tomato to soften it up. It's a keeper.

I loved this and so did my husband who isn't a big fan of my "fancy vinegars". I did make a few changes marinating in balsamic vinegar olive oil and sliced garlic. Instead of frying we barbequed and I came across a bottle of balsamic glaze on clearance so I got that and used it to sauce the chicken when it was done. Also switched out roasted red pepper for the tomato slices just because I'm on a big roasted red pepper craze right now. The fresh ingredients really make this dish outstanding so splurge on the fresh mozzarella and fresh basil because it's worth it!

Great recipe - simplicity with tons of flavor. I baked the chicken instead of frying and broiled it with tomatoes and mozz for the last 5 mintues then garnished with fresh basil- yum! So good! Wonderful summer flavors without grilling

This recipe was great! My husband and I love the tangy-ness the balsamic dressing added and my 15 mo old son enjoyed the tomatoes! After reading some of the other reviews I decided to bake the chicken in the oven. I only had chicken tenderloins so I marinated those for 24 hours & baked for about 25 min. I added sliced tomatoes around the sides of the pan & put the cheese & fresh basil on top about 5 min before they were done. Thanks for the simple meal to get on the table after work!

This meal looks beautiful and is very light which makes it a wonderful summer meal. My chicken was a little tough even though I didn't overcook it and tasted a little bland so next time I may pound the breasts and dredge them in flour. I may also season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper prior to cooking it. Otherwise it made a gorgeous presentation with my homegrown tomatoes and basil. I served it with orzo as a side dish and a Caesar salad.

My family loves this. I sliced the chicken breasts into thirds and placed them in an oversized baking pan poured the entire bottle of dressing over them and marinated all afternoon. I sliced about six tomatoes and two large onions and placed them on top of the chicken sprinkled with basil and covered the dish with foil. I baked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes uncovered it and put a bag of mixed Italian cheeses on top and returned it to the oven until the cheese melted. The combination of the salad dressing and vegetable juices was delicious over rice.

This is very good. I made my own balsamic dressing from the Grilled Romaine Salad also on this site and marinated about 8 hours. We grilled ours to desired doneness then put on a baking sheet and topped with the fresh mozzarella. Then I put them under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese. I topped the cheese with the tomato slices that I had warmed slightly in the microwave. Then I sprinkled with julienned fresh basil and drizzled with a little more balsamic dressing. Loved it!!!

This was a very good idea but I did add some ingredients and my family was impressed with the outcome. First I layered some sliced onion garlic and dried oregano in the bottom of the casserole dish. On top of those ingredients I added all the balsamic marinade and chicken and baked it. After chicken was cooked I put the tomatoes cheese and basil on top of chicken to cook a few minutes. When cheese was melted I took out the chicken with the layered ingredients and put it on a plate. I then reduced the balsamic vinegar used as the marinade and cooking sause in a saucepan until it was the consistency of a glaze and then put it on top of the cooked chicken and served.

An average dish. I didn't have high expectations given the fact that I thought this would be very "simple" tasting (i.e. without a lot of flavor). I like capresse salad but usually as an "appetizer" preceding a more substantial (rich) Italian dish so the fact that it is light usually doesn't bother me. I guess I am a "meat and potatoes" gal.... I marinated my chicken breasts for about 7 hrs. in 8 oz. of Marzetti's balsamic dressing (made half the recipe for my bf and I). Also cooked chicken as directed on low heat for about 30 minutes and had no problems with dryness. Served "capresse style" - topped with a slice of FRESH mozzarella a fresh basil leaf and a slice of beefsteak tomato a sprinkling of coarse salt and fresh "cracked" black pepper and a drizzle of balsamic. Try this with Oven Roasted Red Potatoes and Asparagus by THREDDIES (on this site) and some warm Italian bread with olive oil and fresh Parmesan for dipping. Overall good but not great and won't make on a regular basis. Just not for me. Sorry!

Not only was the recipe a cinch to make (as written) it was delicious and beautiful on the plate too. I found that the chicken had a nice mild balsamic flavor that went well with the tomato basil and fresh mozzarella. Definitely will be a repeat recipe in our house!

This is absolutely deliciious. I marinated the chicken for about 20 hours then baked it as what other reviewers said. I did it for about 25 minutes until the juices run clear. The chicken came out moist. Two things though that I did prior to marinating my chicken was cut the breast lenghtwise because some were thick and then I took poked small holes on my chicken with my meat tenderizer so the marinate will really go through. They came out really tasty. My friends loved it and asked me for the recipe. I topped it with part skim mozzarella cheese broiled it until it gets a little bit melted. I cut my basil in pieces instead of the whole one. The tomatoes on the vine and dash of balsamic finished of the dish and everyone was very satisfied. By the way I made Sweet Spinach Salad that someone recommended for my side. What an awesome luncheon. My Husband said the chicken recipe is great. Will definitely cook this again!!!!!

I was totally surprised at how delicious this was. The only thing I did differently was to bake the chicken and add the mozz during the last five or so minutes. It's light and summery and EASY. I'm breaking this one out for the in-laws!

Wow! This tasted amazing to me and so easy! I love balsamic and this had great flavor. I agree with reviewer "realvintagegirl". DO NOT heat this after adding the mozzarella tomato and basil. The cold ensalade on top was perfect with the warm marinated chicken. My only change was adding a bit of minced garlic to the chicken the last few minutes of cooking so it wouldn't overcook and be bitter. Perfect for summer entertaining but I'll be eating this year-round! This is a new fav!

Do not change a thing!!!! My biggest pet peeve on here is when people change the recipe and then give it 5 stars. The cool insalata caprese goes wonderfully well with the pan fried chicken. My chicken was moist and delicious! I served this over a bed of gluten free pasta. Definitely a keeper.

really easy. I overmarinaated (3days) so the balsamic flavor was a bit mutch) other than that it was pretty good. I only rated 4 stars because it could use more flavoring (seasoning herbs spices) but too much would defintaly take a way from the simple flavor. I just think the fecipie could use a bit just a little tweaking but has potential for 5 stars. i used mozz. slices and baked the breasts for 20 minutes then put a small amount of shredded cheese atop the tomato so the basil had something to stick to. (adding the tomato and basil for an additional 3 minutes) I attempted to brown my breasts prior to baking but the step is unnecessary.

This recipe is wonderful however I did modify it quite a bit: I marinated the chicken for 24 hours (which I highly recommend) and seasoned it with garlic and onion salt before cooking. Like others I decided to bake it (35 minutes @ 400 degrees) and added the cheese in the last minutes. I warmed the tomato and basil over low heat before serving as well. This is a wonderful dish that I would highly recommend.

I didn't have enough time to marinade the chicken for 12 hours and I think it would have been even better if I had. I took the suggestions of others and cut the fresh basil into this strips with scissors and sauteed the basil with the tomatoes for a short time to meld the flavors. I also melted the mozzarella for 5 minutes in the oven. The only thing that I'm going to change next time is to saute some garlic and then add the basil and tomatoes. Excellent and easy dish- my family loved it!

The balsamic vinaigrette marinade is not enough for the chicken. It tasted pretty bland. In the future I will add some seasoning to the chicken in addition to the vinaigrette.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made this a few weeks ago for my sisters birthday and she loved it. She is a big fan of anything containing tomato fresh basil and fresh mozzarella so this was right up her alley! You definitely need to marinate the chicken for at least 12hrs as other reviewers have said. The chicken turns out so moist and flavorful! I plated the chicken and then layered the mozzarella tomato and basil right on top of the hot chicken which allowed the mozzarella to warm up just enough. Fantastic will definitely make this again!

Made this last night we loved it! I made a couple of changes. One I marinated in a super easy but delicious homemade balsamic vinaigrette. Two I filleted the breasts for really fast cooking--3-4 minutes per side over med. high heat. I think 30 minutes over even low heat would dry the chicken out. By filleting them you cook them faster and they stay really juicy and moist. Served with green salad tossed with more of our dressing. We'll definitely have this again--it's great for a warm summer evening and it tastes really fresh with the cool tomatoes and creamy mozzarella. Thanks!

This recipe is DELICIOUS... a wonderful combination of flavors! Based on other reviewers' suggestions I baked the chicken instead of pan frying. I also chopped the tomatoes and basil and heated them in the micro for a couple mins before putting on top of the chicken to serve. This recipe is now definitely part of my rotation. Thanks!!!!

marinate chicken breasts in trader joes balsamic vinaigrette didn't have long only about an hour but it was still very flavorful and tender. pound thin and used the stove top indoor grill. at the end added a little freshly shredded mozzarella and let it melt. served on a bed of orzo with spring lettuce mix on top of chicken and on top of the lettuce i diced up 2 very ripe tomatoes mixed with fresh basil s&p. very good.

Husband's review: Good but not great. I wished there was more flavor to the chicken which was marinated 20 hrs. Meat was moist. I'll try it again and maybe poke holes in the chicken to get more flavor infused. I actually baked it in the convection oven instead of pan-frying on the stovetop.

This recipe is incredible. It's a new favorite around our dinner table. I also used a homemade balsamic dressing the second time since the store bought kind was a bit stinky even though it still tasted good. It's a good idea to fillet the chicken breasts. I then cut them into thirds so that people can choose their own serving sizes.

Excellent and easy to make! I spread the "fresh basil in a tube" (because they were out of fresh at the store) on one side of the mozz and put it on top of the sliced tomato on each chicken breast. I put the pan in the oven for a few minutes before serving to make sure that the cheese was nice and melted. My husband LOVED it!!

I liked the idea of this but the balsamic flavour didn't really come through. I put the chicken under the grill for a few minutes so the cheese could melt over the tomato. I had to splash balsamic all over the finished dish to give it some flavour.

This is a great simple dish. I marinated it overnight in the balsamic so it really absorbed it! I also baked the chicken mozzarella and tomatoes all together rather than just cooking the chicken alone. It was awesome! Baked at 350 for about 40 mins.

I just made this recipe for dinner last night and it went over so well that there wasn't a bit left! marinating the chicken made it unbelievably moist. I drizzled a little balsamic glase over it when I took it out of the oven to serve it. Excellent!

This is a dish I will definately make again! I did make some minor changes to it. First I didn't have balsamic dressing so I used the Tastefully Simple's balsamic and basil dipping oil. I didn't marinate for the time stated. Instead I marinated it for about a half hour then fried it. I used cherry tomatoes and cut up the fresh basil. After it was all done I drizzled the balsamic and basil dipping oil over the dish...turned out great!

I made this the other night and I tweaked it a bit. I LOVE balsamic vinagraitte and fresh mozzarella together so I was very excited to make this dish. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked it. I placed the tomatoes on top after 20 minutes on 350 and baked for another 5 minutes. I then added the mozzarella (I added some feta as well) and baked another 5 minutes. It was pretty good.....but it did not live up to my expectations. I think I will try pan frying it next time....perhaps it will turn out better.

Simple and delicious. After 5 hours in some homemade balsamic dressing I cooked the chicken in a grill pan until done and then added fresh mozzarella and tomato. Baked it in the oven on the grill pan for about 10 minutes @425 until the cheese melted. I heated some remaining balsamic dressing tossed it with fresh spinach and served the chicken on top with a side of garlic toast.

This was amazing! I made it with 3 chicken breasts marinating the chicken from frozen. I baked the chicken instead of frying and it stayed nice and moist. I also put the cheese basil and tomato on top and poured the balsamic on top of that and put it back in the oven for 5 mins. The chicken tasted awesome and the topping was perfect. My husband told me the chicken was really good (high praise in this house) and he said it a couple of times. Will definitely make again! Served with Panzanella salad and it was the perfect combo.

I made sandwiches with this. I baked the chicken for 30 minutes at 350 and than put the cheese on top and baked for another 5 minutes. I also spread pesto on the sandwich rolls rather than using plain basil. I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

We liked this! Good and easy! Hubby gave it the thumbs up. Did cut into tenders (4 breasts) - Marinated from breakfast to dinner with balsamic dressing (1/2 bottle). Cooked for 30 min on 350. Repeating like others use FRESH mozzarella only!! I topped before serving with cheese basil then tomato balsamic and S and P. Next time I may drizzle a little dressing on it warmed up.

I made this for the first time for a church dinner at my house. It came out pretty well. Several people said that they liked it. I am glad that I splurged for the fresh basil rather than using the dried. I also baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. I wonder how it would taste if I had sauteed it. I was feeding several people so I bought two aluminum pans and used those for the baking. I would definitely make this again but I wonder what to serve it with.

This dish was excellent! At the suggestions of others I also baked the chicken after cooking it only for about twenty minutes. This also allowed the cheese to melt which is always a good thing...then I added the tomato and parsley (didn't have basil) right before serving. My boyfriend doesn't even like vegetables and he ate the whole thing tomato and all! Thank you so much for sharing I'll definitely be making this again.

Excellent summertime meal. Followed recipe as described. Not sure if it was operator error or the design of the recipe but the chicken was warm almost cool instead of hot when served. Thus the 4 out of 5 stars. Will definitely make again but will make adjustments to ensure chicken is warmer.

Great base for a recipe I took the advice of some reviewers and baked the chicken at 350 for 15-20 minutes in some of the marinade and it came out really soft and flavorful. Then I layered the fresh mozzarella and baked for an additional 5 minutes. I then spread the basil chiffonade over the cheese and then the tomatoes. I took some of the baking juices from the dish and poured over the tomato layer. A little bit of salt pepper and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to get the tomatoes soft and to help mix the flavors. The balsamic is a very strong taste and overpowers the cheese I may use a different cheese next time. Still very yummy.

Delicious! I forgot to marinade the chicken breasts overnight so slow-cooked the breasts in the marinade instead which actually made the meat more tender as it pan-cooked.

My family and I loved this dish. I'm a beginer cook and this was really easy. I have made it 3 times already. I put the mozzerella on top of the tomatos because I think it helps bring everything together nicer. I also put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes to help the cheese melt and I used more cheese (just because we like alot of cheese.)Also i just drizzled the balsamic dressing over the tomatos before I put on the chesse and then ontop of the whole thing after it was done because I like the flavor

This was excellent when i made it but i changed the recipe some by adding a diced green and red bell peppers and dicing some onion I then cooked them in extra virgin olive oil. After I added the cheese basil leaves diced peppers and onion I topped with a tomatoe slice. I then put in Oven for approximately 5-7 minutes. Other then that I only added some diced garlic and a tiny dash of lemon juice. This was by far one of the best meals I have ever prepared. Thanks for sharing.

Super easy and super yummy recipe. Similar to other reviewers I normally place the dish under the broiler for a few minutes to partially melt the mozzarella and soften the tomatoes a little but that's just personal preference. Even reheats much better than I thought it would. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the balsamic dressing from this site but would probably used store bought next time (I buy really good balsamic and it is a waste to marinate with it). I'm not sure I would marinate for 24 hours next time either. I think if you got this going in the am you would be fine. Good easy and tastey. You can not ask for more than that. Thanks for sharing.

This was tasty and my family liked it. They didn't LOVE it but they ate it up and said they would eat it if I made it again. It is extremely hard to please all the different paletts in my house. My husband likes to eat healthy so this scored with him. My daughter is like me a meat and potatoes kind of gal so this still worked due to the chicken and cheese. My toddler will eat anything so this worked just fine.

Not very flavorful. Will not try this again. I followed everything including fresh mozzarella perdue breasts that marinated for 12 hours (and I even tried poking small holes to let the flavor sink in) ripe tomatoes fresh basil etc. My husband and boys agreed....not a keeper.

I used Mama's Balsamic Vinegrette (from this site) instead of bottled dressing. It gave the chicken wonderful flavor. I also layered the tomato slices basil leaves and fresh mozzerella and drizzled with balsamic vinegar while the chicken was cooking so that they could absorb the flavor better. I placed the chicken breasts on good deli hoagie style rolls with the tomatos etc on top and drizzled with a little more vinegar. This was good...but I think that it was missing something. Next time I think that I might put some horseradish mayo on the bread to give it some bite.
