I could hardly wait for these to cool; they ARE SOO FREAKIN' GOOD!!! The amount of oil scared me at first but I used the full cup and great thing I did (so moist). My changes were to up the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup, used 3 eggs instead of 4, 1.5 cups of reg. sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 extra tbs corn syrup, and finally I omitted the confectioners sugar. I baked them for 28min and they are perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Not cakelike, not hard/crunchy at all! Best Brownies Ever! I'll never go back to a box again! Thanks so much for this recipe!

WOW - these are fabulous! Perfect chewy brownies. I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c. and it was plenty. I also upped the cocoa to 1/2 c. for more chocolate flavor. If you're worried about burning or dryness, bake in a 9x9 pan.

This is the BEST brownie recipe. I have been making it for over a year. Perfectly chewy! I always half the recipe because I can't stop eating them. Take note: if you up the cocoa powder, you have to decrease the flour. Too much dry ingredients will give you a more cake-like consistance.

Great brownie recipe for fudge lovers!!  The corn syrup is what gives them their chewy texture, so don't omit. I also added l cup of chocolate chips.  Bars should be fudgy and not hard or cakelike, be careful to not overbake.

I can only give these 4 stars as I made them, but I am positive they are 5 stars all the way.  I took another's advice and added a bit more corn syrup, and mine are very wet on the bottom.  They are chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  I was worried with the amount of eggs, thinking they would be more cake like, and they aren't.  I will make this again, reducing the amount of sugar a bit, and not adding any extra corn syrup.  I also had to cook much longer than the 25 minutes, more like 45 for me.  They are already half gone and I just made them last night!  Thanks so much for the post, these are going to be my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

I followed the advice from the comments and upped the cocoa to a 1/2 cup. I also replaced the 1 cup of oil with applesauce. I put a pinch of cayenne and a 1/4 cup of coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor as well. I threw in peanut butter chips and unsalted crushed peanuts! Thank goodness I did, otherwise these brownies would have had no flavor! I think I am being generous by giving it 3 stars and that is only because they have a fantastic texture. That's not enough for me though, so I won't be making these again!

These are definitely chewy!  They are good but didn't rate them a five because they are just not QUITE as chocolatety as I would like.  I think a 4.5 would be a good rating!

Excellent chewy brownies. I used 2 cups of flour, other than that followed the recipe. I had to bake them about 40 minutes to get the middle done. I pressed the pecan halves into the top of the batter before baking. I sprayed my 9x13 pan well and they didn't stick at all.

Here's the deal;  I've made these twice.  First time, texture was good but not enough chocolate flavor.  2nd time I added 1/2 cup cocoa and 1 tblsp. chocolate syrup.  Honey, these could have passed for Betty Crocker, only better!  I also cooked them 40 minutes.  They turned out absolutely perfect.

This is my first time to write a review and this brownie recipe really got me inspired to write about it. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! I finally found the brownie recipe of my dreams. I've been trying brownie recipes for years and this is the absolute best!!! It's moist, chewy and chocolaty! Very fudgy indeed! I actually used brown sugar and dark corn syrup for it since those were the things I had in the kitchen. I don't know if it makes any difference. I just really think this recipe rocks!

I love these! I drizzled hersheys syrup over the top of the brownies and swirled with a knife before I baked them and they were fabulous! My fianc√© didn't believe that I made them. Everyone at the party loved them as well..

I will not make this one again. It's too oily, it fell apart & it was just too fattening! The only thing I did differernt from the recipe was put 3 eggs & not 4 eggs in it. I was short on eggs. Also I had to cook it longer to get it cooked all the way in the middle & that left the sides cooked more than I like them. I didn't like the powder sugar on it either. I just felt bad eating this. Every bite gets worst to me.

I made this with 1/2 c of cocoa and 1 1/2 c of sugar, but it tastes  rather salty - I would definitely cut down on the salt.

Way too oily and Texture very granular.  Maybe if I had; used less sugar & oil, & more flour. Really wanted this to work, it was easy and didn't use eggs.

The recipe is JUST PERFECT. I like my brownies really chewy and I've tasted chewier brownies only one other time in my life. I'll definitely be making these again. Some people say add 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of 1/3 cup. But I don't know if i agree. If you add too much cocoa it has a weird earthy smell to it. I think this recipe is just perfect. I'm still looking for the perfect brownie but this will have to do till then.

Ok I have no clue why some people say they are too oily and that they leave oil residue on your hands because I did a half batch in an 11 by 7 inch brownie pan and they turned out crunchie on the outside and moist on the inside. Not even a speck of oil was left on my hand when I ate them.  Only different thing I did was do half brown sugar and half white suger and add choco chips instead of nuts.

These were sooooooooo good! Just the way I like them, nice and chewy! I overbaked though, I forgot that they continue to bake once out of the oven as well, so t hey would have been perfect had I taken them out before they were "tooth pick clean".  I also took the advice of others and did these alterations: 1 1/2 C Sugar 1/2 C Br. Sugar 3/4tsp Salt 3 Eggs 1/2 C Cocoa

This is a really good scratch recipe for brownies, mine turned out very well. I didn't have vanilla extract on hand so I used maple instead - which produced a molasses tasting browning. They were good even so! Next time I will try making them more chocolatey. The 1/3 cup cocoa doesn't make these super rich chocolately brownies so you can play with the recipe. But it is a very good one!

I followed the advise of another reviewer (Kandiee), and the brownies were just superb. It took longer for the center to bake completely, as a result I ended up with some not so chewy edges. Next time I will use foil to help keep the edges moist while the center bakes.  They were super chewy!!

For those reviewers getting a sugar film on top, I would recommend creaming the liquid ingredients together first, then add the sugar.  THEN add flour, cocoa, etc.  Make sure all the liquid ingredients are well creamed before adding the dry ing.

The recipe adjustments I used:
1 c oil
3 eggs
3 Tbsp light corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 c white sugar
1/2 c brown sugar
1/3 c baking cocoa
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 c chopped pecans

Cream liquid ingredients together for 2-3 minutes until well mixed. Add sugars and mix for another 2-3 minutes until well mixed.  Add flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Mix until batter is nice and smooth. Stir in pecans.  Bake at 350 for 25-35 minutes.  After 25 minutes, if center is still baking, wrap foil around edges (2" deep) to prevent drying.

Everyone devoured these!  I followed the recipe except added 3/4 cup chocolate chips and they were fantastic.  I used a glass 9X13 pan and they needed to be cooked for just about 40-45 minutes.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

I prefer fudgy brownies.  These were kind of cake-like when they first came out of the oven. I wasn't sure I liked them then. However, the second day, after sitting out in a sealed dish, they were much more fudgy.  I loved them on the second day!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Wow.  Made these and felt like they weren't worth the calories.  I missed the butter taste in brownies and you really need chocolate rather than cocoa for a good tasting brownie.  They were chewy but tasted like a box mix.  Even my kids didn't like them.

I altered this recipe, somewhat! I do not plan on making this recipe again; my husband and I didn't care for it! I do a lot of cooking/baking and I have to say... this is not one of the better recipes I have used!

First of all, it's cake, not brownie.  Second of all, the finished product tastes like you're eating vegetable oil -- and I only used 1/2 the vegetable oil called for (substituting the other 1/2 w/ vanilla yogurt).  Will not make again.  (And I followed the recipe exactly and bake all the time).

These brownies are perfect. I've always been a fan of the chewy, icing-less brownie and this recipe delivers. HOWEVER: I did increase the cocoa to 2/3 cup and added a full bag of chocolate chips. I also added an extra dash of vegetable oil. I too cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as many suggested, and I'm glad I did. Cooking time varies from 20-32 minutes, depending on how gooey you like your brownies.

This recipe is wonderful! I personally prefer boxed brownies to homemade any day ... homemade never have that richness, moisture, or chewiness that boxed ones do - well these have ALL of those things, and more! As per other reviews, I used 3 eggs instead of 4, bumped up the cocoa to 1/2 cup, and cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups. I added 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup chocolate chips. These brownies are amazing ... soft, slightly chewy, a little crispy on the edges, super moist. Really, really great - thanks!

These were really tasty. I added a generous cup of chocolate chips to them because I wanted them to be extra decedent. No need for icing!

Made these for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day and they came out perfectly moist and chewy he couldn't stop eating them and considering I've never made anything from scratch that means the recipe is a WINNER!

These are the first brownies I have ever made from scratch! I love them, they are hot out of my oven right now! I made them just as the recipe said, except I cooked mine for about 37 minutes, I think the only change I will make next time will be putting some chocolate syrup in them. Its something I like to do with any brownie I make, except I didnt have any syrup to use this time...I just pour the mixture into the baking pan and then drizle chocolate syrup all over the top, when the brownies are finished they are gooey chocolatey and very yummy!

These brownies are fabulous!  The texture is perfect--wonderfully moist and chewy, but also not too dense.  I will use this as a basic brownie recipe in the future, but to be truly fudgy there needs to be more chocolate taste.  I'll try substituting chocolate syrup for the corn syrup or adding some chocolate chips.  Mine also needed 40 minutes to fully bake.

I just found and tried this recipe.  It is the best recipe for brownies I have ever tried.  I made a few changes going along with the ideas of another member.  I put 1/2 C cocoa, used 3 eggs instead of 4, 1 extra Tbs corn syrup and I also omitted the confectioners sugar.  They are perfect and my family LOVE them.

If you like fried food you'll like these brownies.  They tasted like they'd been deep fried.  They left oil in the bottom of my pan and grease on our fingers.  They are good and chewy and definately moist, but moist with grease :(

Absolutely Amazing Brownies!  The best I've tried, and I've tried nearly all brownie recipes. :p   My only mods were an extra half Tablespoon of Corn Syrup (lets call it Two Heavy Tablespoons) and an extra Teaspoon of Vanilla. Meh.... not worth mentioning :) This recipe stands well on its own.

WOW ARE THESE GOOD!!! I signed up just to write a review for these brownies. Since I heard that if you want to have a chewier brownie, reduce the eggs, I only used 2 instead of 4, and reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp. The corn syrup made the dough come together like candy, so it was easy not to over mix. They took just under 25 minutes on center rack in oven. YUMMY - it's too bad no one is home because I put them in the fridge to cool first and just had one- going to finish the row now. AWESOME CHEWY YUM

AWESOME!!! To fully appreciate  these, you should wait til they're cooled off. I put mine in the fridge, and let me tell ya'....it was hard to stay out of 'em!! I used a glass pan, greased with vegetable shortening. If you  want a chewy brownie....this is your recipe.

OMG- remind me why anybody would use a box mix? These are FANTASTIC. Made just as directed.
I used the auto convert convection function on my new oven, but had to cook about 10 min longer than the oven thought I should (it converted to 325 but left the time at 27 minutes), which made me worry. Edges a little hard, but so chewy they blended right in, no complaints. I did oil the pan before adding batter, which may have added to a greasiness factor, but they came out of the pan all right. Great flavor and wonderfully chewy, not cakey at all.

I've made these brownies twice and the first time I don't remember anything too exciting about them and so I made them again today and they were a little on the salty side and didn't have a very good flavor. 1 1/2 tsp. Of salt seemed like a tad too much for brownies but I followed the recipe anyway.

These are REALLY good.  And they are best if you can manage to let them sit for hours before eating.  (So, they're better the day after baking them.)  Totally not healthy and full of sugar but SO good.  =)

Absolutely amazing!  I would have sworn by boxed brownies until I tried this recipe, but I wanted to make a whole-grain brownie.  Mission accomplished!  I used 1 1/4 c. King Arthur white whole-wheat flour, 1/2 c. cocoa, 1 t. salt, and 3 eggs.  My family loved this whole-grain snack!

Delish! I would sub half the oil for apple sauce next time, as well I used 1/4 cup cocoa powder and 4 melted squares of semi-sweet chocolate. This really helped to add depth to the chocolate flavour. Also, 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar was plenty. No powdered sugar, 2/3 cup of nuts sprinkled on top. Perfect!

This recipe was DELISH! I baked it for my school bake sale, and it was a HIT! It got sold out in 20 minutes! Instead of putting in 1 1/2 cup flour, put in 2, which feels good in your mouth and fluffs up the taste! I didn't use vanilla, or corn syrup, or pecans, but it still worked out perfect. I'm the class brownie-baking star, actually the class baking star, and everyone is begging me to make them again for tomorrow!

I thought these were pretty good. But my husband just thought they were so so even after cocoa was upped to ¬Ω cup, he said it could have been more chocolaty. With a few more tweaks I think he'll be won over.

I followed the recipe (minus the nuts and conf. sugar) and thought these were great. I will add more cocoa powder next time and maybe a touch less sugar but otherwise they were perfect for me - very dense, moist and chewy. They even had a slight touch of that thin, sweet & crunchy top layer you get from boxed brownies. I used one bowl - mixing the dry ingredients with a wisk first, then adding all the wet and then mixing again. They were very quick and easy to make. Great if you're ever in need of a last minute dessert.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and was very disappointed with the results. The rating is fairly deceptive, since so many people made their own adaptions. The brownies weren't very chocolatey or sweet, and were not nearly as chewy as I expected. I won't be making this recipe again.

Impressive recipe!  We were wowed with this one.  So moist and chewy.  I think others with cakelike and dry results must have overbaked.  I take mine out when I think they could use a minute or two more just to be sure they do not overbake, then they finish baking themselves out of the oven.  A few changes to make it a little healthier.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 unbleached bread flour and whole wheat bread flour, honey instead of corn syrup, and olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on as soon as the brownies came out of the oven too.  Great recipe.  Next time I will cut sugar down a little by omiting 1/2 cup, and using applesauce in place of oil.  We will be making this again soon! Thanks!

I have been looking for a recipe to replace a lost one my mom used to make...this is the closest so far...Delicious! I added 1/2 Cup Cocoa instead of 1/3 and also added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked for 25-30 minutes.  The edges will satisfy those who like their brownies chewy and the middle will be for those who like it gooey! Best recipe ever!

WOW!!! If you love a good Fudge Brownie, you'll love these, If you like a thicker brownie, Bake them in a 9x9 inch square pan, and increase the cook time to 35 - 40 minutes. Amazing !

These were awesome and perfect with ice cream. I will increase the cocoa next time for the more chocolate taste.
*update* Made them again with the extra cocoa and used less flour. These were even yummier! I also had some chocolate frosting from a boxed brownie mix from who knows when. So happy I found a homemade brownie recipe that tastes awesome!

These brownies are really really good. I made some changes and used one the reviewers advice about using chocolate syrup instead of corn syrup. They were sooo chewy!! Mmmmmm the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was because it took a lot longer 
than 25 to 27 minutes for these brownies to bake. 
They were still not done and very liquidy on the 
inside so I had to bake them for a lot longer until the
 inside was finally done.( Maybe I did something wrong I dunno).  Overall these will be the
 brownie recipe that I will be using from now on.
 They really are excellent. They taste very close to the ones in the box but trust me these are waaay better!

This is the first homemade brownie recipie that I  have used that the taste AND the texture came out exactly the way I like brownies to be. Very chocolatey, very moist and chewy. It was very simple to put together as well. Excellent

I am very happy with this recipe! I made the following changes and they have come out perfect every time...1 3/4 cups of sugar instead of 1 cup, used 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of 1/3, used 3 eggs instead of 4, and chocolate syrup instead of corn syrup. I also omitted nuts or confectioners sugar. Baked for 35 minutes. I grease and lightly flour the pan. These taste better then Duncan Hines! Moist, chewy, and chocolaty ....mmmm enjoy!

Very moist and tasty.  I did change a few things.  Like many reviews suggested I upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup.  I reduced the amount of salt to 1tsp.  I used unsalted butter instead of oil.  I cooked it for an additional 10 minutes.  After I cut and cooled them, I dipped the bottoms of the brownies in granulated sugar.

Great brownie recipe, first time making from scratch!  I also added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and had to bake for about 30 min for the centre to firm.  Excellent topped with CoolWhip.

I think these are really super good brownies.  I like the texture...not too cakey. Sprinkled a few chocolate chips over the top while they baked. A big hit in my house. I'll definitely be making them again.  And again...

I added the extra cocoa.  We loved them!  I did cook for the 40 min as well.  We topped it with a cheesecake recipe we have as well.  It was delicious and less than 24hrs. later they are all gone!  I loved mix brownies but these were better!

LOVED these! I also changed the ingredients slightly: 1 1/2 c sugar, 1 1/4 c flour, 1/2 c cocoa to be chocolatier. I used a 13x9 pan and baked for 25 minutes. I also chopped Andes mints and mixed them into the batter, then garnished the top with chopped Andes mints! My husband and employees LOVED them!!! The corn syrup was awesome! GREAT recipe!

Excellent brownies! What I do differently is add chocolate syrup. It adds extra chocolate flavor for those who wish these were more chocolate-y. ;) My family LOVES them and devours the whole pan in just two days(at the most)! I'm always making double batches so they'll last longer.

The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because they weren't chocolately enough. They were the perfect texture though, and I will make them again. I added chocolate chips and that made them extra good. Add chocolate and they'll be perfect.

I added about 3/4 cup of shredded coconut and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.    Mine turned out more like a cake than brownies but I just made them last night and the whole pan has been eaten so obviously they are scrumptious! :)  This has been printed and added to my recipe book as I will definitely be making these again.

Extremely tasty and moist.  A little too greasy for my liking, your fingers get oily from holding them (no other brownie residue, just oil). But still a great recipe!

These brownies were delicious.  I did change a few things per other reviewers suggestions, increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup and added milk chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe...!!

These brownies are my go-to now! I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup, and substituted chocolate chunks for the nuts (we don't like them). I baked them in two round 8" pans (I didn't have an available 9 x 13) and they turned out perfect!!

one of the best brownie recipe that I really like. the moistness and chewiness is just right, not that sweet and not that bitter. A perfect partner with Cafe Americano.

Pretty good, great texture but not quite as chocolaty as I like. Next time I will try some of the suggestions such as using Hershey's dark coco instead.

I was skeptical of such glowing reviews, but am now writing one myself! These are the best brownies i've ever had. Someone had mentioned that they weren't choclatey enough in their review so i sprinkled chocolate chips across the top just before baking. They are AMAZING.. Chewy and soft!

Awesome!!  Perfectly soft and squishy! Just like any brownie should be!  I had to change the cooking time to 40 min to adjust to my pan which was a little small and made the brownies thicker.  I started at 25 min and poked the center with a toothpick till it came clean adding 5 mins at a time till done.  But that's all!  PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe, my hubby says "not enough chocolate" so next time I will use 1/2 cup cocoa. I was nervous about 4 eggs because of the cakeyness of other brownies with that many, but these were so chewy and yummy!

I made these brownies three days ago and am making them again today .. just awesome.. I didn't have the light corn syrup so I used the dark and they were soooo good. DO NOT USE APPLESAUSE INTEAD OF OIL . I read one of the reviews where she had done that and said they weren't very good ... you must use the oil.. you won't be disappointed

This was great! I did change the recipe a bit by adding 1/2 a cup of cocoa powder and using honey instead of corn syrup. I also added just 1 cup of sugar because I add 1 cup of melted chocolate chips to the mixture after everything else was mixed. It turned out great.. Putting this one in the books!1

Too sugary. Not enough chocolaty. I even took another reviewer's advice and put 1 1/2 C sugar as opposed to 2 C sugar. The corn syrup made them "wet" at the bottom. These brownies go against everything I believe in (too much sugar, too much fat etc), but I figured the treat would be worth it if they were good enough. Alas, they were not. Too cakey. I will say that I haven't yet "cooled" them completely so maybe that will help. But even then, I don't think they are that good....

These brownies are incredible!  Very chewy and delicious.  I do agree with others that the recipe lacks enough chocolate, so I made my second batch with a mix of dark chocolate cocoa powder and regular cocoa powder and upped the amount to a 1/2 cup.  Also, it takes about 45 minutes to bake and a bit longer if nuts are added.  Overall, it definitely is the best brownie recipe I have tried.  Plus, I usually have all the ingredients on hand so I can make them anytime company is coming over.  Try em, you'll love em!

I love the chewiness of these brownies, but there are two things that will keep me from making this recipe again: 1)they don't have too little chocolate flavor 2)they are too oily (oily enough that if you touch them your fingers get greasy). That oil flavor is too much for me. They are also a little too salty, but that's minor.

I loved these brownies but made a few personal preference changes. I used 1/2 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons corn syrup, and only 3 eggs. Baked at 325 for 40 minutes. The brownies turned out wonderful. If it weren't for the raw eggs in the batter, I probably would have had let my two year old have a few more tastes before baking. She absolutely loved it! This was my first time making homemade brownies and will continue to use this recipe.

These were VERY GOOD!!!  I also used only 3 eggs since my family likes brownies chewy and not cake-y.  The only think i think i would change is the enormous amount of oil needed.  I don't know if it was just in my head, but they seemed a little oily.  Hubby LOVED LOVED them!!  So will definitely make again!  Maybe I'll try it will 3/4 cup oil next time!  Excellent homemade!

This is the best recipe ever! The corn syrup is that magic ingredient which makes the brownies moist and chewy. And I thought I would have to contend with the box mix. Never again.

really good brownies. Often, it is hard to get the perfect consistency, and these brownies have it. Perfect and chewy on the inside, and chewy and crispy on the outside (my 9 yr old son's exact words!). Chocolatey? Not much, but with the addition of a handful of chocolate chips in the batter, they were perfectly chocolatey. So easy to make, everyone who tried them said they were really good. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm a taste of home subscriber (where the recipe was first published) but still I was hesitant to make these brownies, thinking that there would be no way that they would even turn out...wow was I wrong!  This is _THE_ recipe to use if you want a great, chewy brownie.  I didn't use the confectioner sugar or pecans, but they were fantastic!
The only recommendation I can make to make them better...add some chocolate chips to the batter :)  If I could give more than 5 stars I would!

Yummy!  These brownies are delicious!  They taste great and are very chewy.  I only used 3 eggs and added some chocolat chips.  I had to bake them for about 35 minutes before the center was cooked.

The flavor was ok... but seemed a bit weak on the chocolate and it was cakey and not fudgy.  I didn't use my mixer to mix the batter, I did it by hand to make sure I didn't over mix.  I was a bit disappointed.

Not a great brownie in all honesty. I did increase the cocoa as everyone suggested. The texture was okay, the taste was really missing something. I've made a different recipe before where I mixed in on the stove top and then baked it and it really was a great recipe. I wont be making this one again.

I honestly could not be happier with the way these turned out! I added a little extra vanilla and used chopped walnuts on top, ive read reviews saying this recipe was flavorless and I cant agree at all, they were absoloutely perfect. five stars in my books.

The chewy-ness is PERFECT.  The ladies and I decided, however that they could be more chocolatey.  Next time we will be doubling the cocoa, and I will let you know how that is.

I am not a brownie person, but decided to make these for my husbands long rifle club. I did bake them longer, as ovens vary. I also make a plain white frosting to liven them up a bit. They were gone in minutes according to my husband. I will try adding some mint extract like another reviewer stated for a change, and I bet they will be great! As well, if you prefer a more chocolate taste, I would up the baking cocoa to 1/2 cup. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this recipe exactly as written numerous times (minus the nuts & confectioners sugar) and have been happy each time.  I made them again tonight with a few minor changes(3 eggs instead of 4 and 1.5 cups sugar instead of 2 cups) and again am pleased!  Delicious, moist and chewy!  This is my go-to recipe, haven't bought box brownies since I found this one!  Yummy!

Great recipe! This was the first time I have ever made brownies from scratch. I did however take the advice of many of the other reviews. I decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Increased cocoa to 1/2 cup and decreased salt to 1/2 t.

I made these for my husband one day and hes refusing to eat anything made from a box mix. They're fantastic :)
A nice variation is to add a little mint extract to the mix!!

As with other reviewers I increased the cocoa. I used 3/4 cup, plus 1 cup pecan pieces and 1 cup chocolate chips. Absolutely excellent. Exactly 27 minutes cooked these perfectly. If you line the pan with parchment paper you can easily turn it over on a cutting board, and cut it into squares. These freeze beautifully, and are actually delicious frozen as well. They reheat nicely in the microwave to serve with ice cream. I am a serious chocoholic and one of these satisfies my craving.

I did up the cocoa to 1/2 cup.  These brownies are WONDERFUL!  Nice and chewy, just like I like them.  I am making my second batch this morning!  Someone once told me that box brownies always turn out better than the ones you make from scratch.....not the case!  A+

Great Brownies!! They took way longer then 25 minutes though. I would say they took more like 40 to 50 minutes to bake. I followed the original recipe and added some chocholate chips to them. I think adding more cocoa would make them way to chocholatey. They were pretty rich with with just 1/3c. Over all great recipe! :)

These brownies are the chewiest I've ever tasted. My family loved them! I even gave some to my friends and they loved it! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because they weren't chocolatey enough, so I would up the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup.

Fantastic brownies, I've gotten great reviews and they've always disappeared quickly. The first time I made them I used Macadamia nuts, and they were so delicious. The second time I tried reducing the amount of oil by adding 1/4c water and 3/4c oil. They were still delicious, but a little less moist than the original. Also, they could be more chocolatey, and I will be adding more cocoa next time as others have suggested.

I made these brownies for my daughter's wedding since we are doing a dessert reception.  I used the perfect brownie pan and they turned out wonderfully.  Tasted really good and visually looked great.  Only added a little more cocoa since others said it need more flavor.

These are my fave, (& only brownie recipe), I've ever made from scratch. I like the fact that they're chocolaty & chewy. You can savor them without overdoing it. I added a bit more cocoa powder than called for but that's just a matter of taste. :o)

Perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to substitute dark corn syrup, and I used 1/2 cup baking cocoa. On the first try they came out dense, chewy, and chocolatey. I sprayed with Pam instead of greasing my glass dish, and there was no sticking. The edges were perfect, and there was no cracking on the surface. Great recipe that used what I had around the house. YUM!

I enjoy a nice, toothsome brownie, and these really did deliver.   For those fearing a lack of chocolate flavor, try substituting the cocoa for four ounces of unsweetened/bittersweet chocolate and cutting the oil to 3/4 cups. I also cut the sugar down to one cup and added half a cup of brown sugar. I only used three eggs and an extra tablespoon of corn syrup. I threw in a splash of rum which goes together marvelously with the chocolate.   I also made a caramel sauce by melting a cup of sugar and melting in six tablespoons of butter and stirring in a cup of heavy cream. I drizzled it over the batter before baking.

Good but a little too chewy for my family's taste. Can't say any of them went to waste though! We just prefer a little less chewy and a little more cakey.

Very good. I will be making these again. A couple reviewers had mentioned that the brownies were not 'Chocolate' enough.   I didn't have a problem with this, but maybe it was because of the cocoa I used.   I used Hershey's special dark cocoa instead of regular cocoa (It's 100% cacao).  I also folded in a cup of dark chocolate chips and frosted the brownies with milk chocolate icing.   One other observation, is that the brownies were even better the next day. It seems like they need to sit, or at least cool for several hours,  to achieve best flavor.     Also I had to cook these a little longer than specified, but maybe it's my oven.   I brought these to a Father's day party and they were very popular.  I plan to make these again in a couple of weeks when my son comes home from school, he loves dark chocolate.

This is the first time I have ever made brownies from scratch, as I favour the texture and taste of the grocery store boxed variety.  WOW! Extremely easy to prepare, and turned out beyond perfect.   I iced them with chocolate icing and topped with crushed pecans.   Delicious!

4 stars because even after upping the cocoa powder to 1/2 c. the brownies were not nearly as fudge tasting as what comes from the box. Strange, as I followed everything else.  Next time I'm going to add chocolate chips! I'm scared to add more cocoa powder because besides the taste, the consistency of these brownies are FABULOUS. Perfect.

We loved these! They stayed chewy and moist. I did have to increase the amount of cocoa powder, though.

Although these are very easy to prepare and have a fabulous chewy texture, they just don't taste that great. Not particularly chocolatey or fudgy as the recipe claims.

I am giving these 5 stars, EXCELLENT texture. My family and babysitters inhaled them. A full pan lasted us a whopping 4 hours. I personally wold like to have had more chocolate flavor. I think maybe I will add more coco powder and less flour. I like that they are still easy, but none of the boiling, and blah blah, I have little to no patients (or time really) for that.  Also, I used a clear glass pyrex dish, some people were having trouble with it sticking and being hard? Maybe you are using the wrong pan. Also, like anything, don't keep opening the oven door. It lets the cool air in, and shocks the brownies. Use your oven light, and don't look until the time is up, then you can start peeking.  Thanks sooo much for sharing :)

My batch was more cakey than chewey. I was out of eggs and used egg whites from a carton, so maybe that was the reason? Definitely not chewey enough for me. However, my boyfriend loved them as they had an airy, light texture.

I was very disappointed in these brownies.  I was pretty excited to try this recipe as I have had a hard time finding one that gives me the texture I am looking for in a brownie.  These had a good texture in the middle, but the edges cooked up rock hard for me.  The real disappointment was the flavor.  I used some of the suggestions from other users; I increased the cocoa to a little over 1/2 cup.  I still thought these had very little flavor.  Won't try this one again.

i should have read the reviews closer. I agree i liked the texture very much..but not enough cocoa and waaay too salty. 1 1/2 teaspoons is way too much for our family anyway..I will try again and modify.

Pretty good brownie, though I made some changes.  I used 1/2 cup of cocoa, and lessened the flour to equal out the dry ingredients.  I also eliminated one egg, and subbed a splash of milk.  Once i was done mixing them, I threw in a large handful of chocolate chips, to up the chocolate factor.  Took them to my son's pre-school Easter party and they devoured them!  They are actually better the second day, I think.  I'll make them again for sure!

These were great when warm but when they cooled...wow!  Moist and chewy!  This is a great brownie recipe.  I followed the directions exactly as written...the only modification I might make next time is to add a touch more cocoa.

When I got all my ingredients out to make these, I realized I had already used up all my corn syrup! Since they were mostly made already, I decided to make them anyways! Even without the syrup these were the best brownies I've had in a while! They were still "fudgy" and moist in the middle; nothing like a cake (which is what I always worry about with a new brownie recipe!). I split the batter between two 8" pans and added walnuts to just one (for those that like it). They came out great and were even crispy on the outside, fudgy on the inside the next day still! Thanks for this one...it's a keeper!

This might be my fault but these were EXRTEMELY sticky and I've been soaking my pan for 2 hours and brownie bits are still sticking to it. The overall flavor is really good, and i love the chewiness, but just way to sticky. Hard to cut and get out of the pan, even though i greased it.

Although I liked the chewy texture of these brownies, they weren't 'chocolatey' enough for my taste buds.  Also, I did use the 4 eggs the recipe called for and would recommend using 3, as some advised.  The brownies were a little more cake-like than I prefer. That said, perhaps adding twice as much cocoa powder would help, but I think I'll continue searching for another brownie recipe.  Thanks anyway.

These brownies were fantastic! Nice and chewy. I did add double the amount of corn syrup and 1/4 cup more cocoa than the recipe called for. So they were extra chewy. I also topped them with a great chocolate brownie icing. My family loved them!!!

These have an awesome texture! They are so chewy on the inside and the ones from the edges of the pan still have the perfect amount of crisp. I think if I make them again I'll add more cocoa because I'm a big chocolate lover. Everyone who tried them said "OH these are so chewy! I love it!"

I reduced salt to 1 instead of 1 1/2. (I read some of the reviews that said salty, so i just guessed) i had to cook for 35 minutes in my glass pyrex 9x13. Dont know what others are saying about oily  because there is NO oil on pan or my hands. They're chocolately without being super sweet (result of cocoa instead of chocolate). I can't even wait for them to cool anymore, we're going back for seconds. Thank You!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe, I made it just the way the recipe said. I had such high hopes that they would be great because of the great reviews. These are kind of cross between a brownie and cake. They were chewy, but not enough chocolate, and they don't have a brownie like texture, and they were too oily. I was craving brownies tonight, but I'm left disappointed. It seems like its hard to find a good brownie recipe, everyone has their own versions. I need to find my old recipe! What a let down!

Great recipe! I too changed the flour to cocoa ratio (1 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup cocoa). I also added mini marshmallows and caramel bits. Delicious!

Mine came out more cake like than chewy. I didn't have corn syrup and substituted 1 tablespoon honey and 1 tablespoon water instead. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup. The taste is exactly right but if you are used to store bought extra sweet brownie mixes then go ahead with the 2 cups of sugar. Next time I will use 3 eggs and see if this gives me the chewy brownie texture I prefer.

Followed the directions exactly with the exception of taking advice from other posts and only adding 1 1/2 cup sugar. Brownies came out like cake and way too salty.

I totally agree with one of the raters. Reduce sugar by 1/2 cup.  Even if you do not change the recipe......it is the best ever brownies. I only let it bake for 23 minutes.

I took the advice of some others reviewa and upped the cocoa to 1/2 cup.  It seemed a little dry in the mixing bowl so I added two teasoons of water then added two more (4 tsp Total)  That seemed to help and the browmies are great.  Chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside edges.  Thanks Sheila.

I took the advice of a few others and used only 3 eggs and a little more corn syrup and upped the cocoa to 1/2 cup. I love chewy fudgey brownies and I thought these were great! Not quite like boxed brownies but as close as I have come. I also added a little wheat flour in place of white. I felt that the wheat tastes was covered up pretty well (I'm always looking for ways to sneak wheat in). My husband thought you could still taste the wheat too much but he still ate half of them :) Just an idea if you're trying to make things just a tad healthier.

I don't like giving low ratings or negative reviews, but at the same time, that is what these are all about.  Having said that, I do not get the high reviews for these brownies.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were aweful.  All three of my kids asked me if they had to finish because they didn't like them and that has never happened before.  The worst thing is that they are way too salty, it was weird.  Also, too much oil, sugar, and eggs, and then not enough chocolate.  There has to be a fantastic recipe out there somewhere, I will keep looking... (sorry).

These were amazing! I made them for a lunch party & I came home with an empty platter. The only changes I made were to add a little more cocoa & less flour & added a cup of chocolate chips.

BEST BROWNIES I EVER MADE!!!  I followed others suggestions and made with the following changes: 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, and added about a tablespoon more corn syrup.  I also added milk chocolate chips (for me) and walnuts (for my husband).  The outside was chewy and the inside was gooey (but not undercooked)  I used a glass 13x9x2 in baking pan and it took about 35 minutes to bake (I lost track of time because I wait until I can smell the brownie goodness.  That's when I know they're done!) PERFECT!

These brownies were DELICIOUS! The only reason I rated a four instead of a 5 is that they really aren't "chewy".  Great flavor & dense cake-y texture.  Will definitely make again.

Very Good Brownies. I baked for 25 min and I thought they were undercooked until after they cooled then I realized they were perfectly baked. Chewy, not cake like. Next time I will use less sugar. Just a personal preference.

I followed the person's suggestion about upping the cocoa to 1/2 cup, adding the brown sugar, and 1 1/2 cup of sugar. To be honest, I didn't think that these had much chocolate flavor to it. If I would have left it in the over for the middle to get completely done, the edges would have been burned. I don't think that I will make these again.

Really great brownies. I found however after using all the ingredients it still wasn't the right consistency for brownies(too thick). I ended up using a few tablespoons of veg oil to loosen up the batter and melted semi sweet chocolate melted into it for something a little more moist. Very great!

I did the couple of suggested changes (decreased sugar to 1 c. white and 1/2 c. brown, used 1/2 c. cocoa and still used 4 eggs.  IT was the worst flop I've had in years.  Baked it for 30 mins. and it was almost burnt on the top but underneath it was gooey. It tasted like chocolate flavored egg bake.  I scraped it all out and dumped it. I'm so glad it turned out well for the rest of you.   Maybe I shouldn't have made any changes.  Anyway, I just went out and bought box mixes, because I needed 3 pans.

Warm from the oven, neither I nor my fiancee liked them.  The next day, though, we found they were much better.  A great chewy brownie that's hard to match in texture.  Like other reviewers noted, they need more chocolate.  Good recipe as a starting point but not a keeper as written.

Absolutely decadent; I will definitely make this one again!  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the nuts because I was fresh out of them...bf looooovvvveeeedddd it; he is a chocoholic.  I had to bake mine a little longer, about 30-32 mins.  I've been searcing for the perfect made-from-scratch brownie recipe, and now I've found it...so much more easier than the one I've been using that just didn't quite meet perfection the way this recipe has.  Thanks for sharing this recipe (:

Brownies are nice and fudgy but it took over an hour to bake (gas oven) at 350, not 25-27 min as recipe states.  My fiance and I like to top the brownies with vanilla ice cream, choc. syrup, and cool whip for a decadent and rich dessert.

These brownies are so good and so easy and quick.    The best thing is that I usually have everything in the pantry to make them.    Excellent!!
*Please do not rate recipes if you change them!   That is a different recipe at that point and not fair to the one who shared it.  *

I made this the first time from the original recipe and it was great, and the second time I cut the flour by 1/4 cup and added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and it was even better.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly (when will I learn!?) They're good, but not amazing. Next time I will follow exactly & re-review!
