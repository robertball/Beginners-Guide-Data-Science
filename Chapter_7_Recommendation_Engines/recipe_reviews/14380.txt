I made this recipe when I discovered I was having some unexpected guests for dinner. Didn't have salami, but added chopped celery and onion and some Italian dressing as I didn't think it was moist enough. My guests loved it, thanks for a quick and easy to put together recipe. Saved my day!

This recipe is missing something - the combination was too dry.

Good basic recipe! I think you can really add anything to this to your taste to jazz it up a bit.  Bacon, garlic and cheese will be present the next time I make this.
