Followed instructions and starter produced a heavy loaf that did not rise.  Tried a different recipe that included throwing out half and "feeding" for several days and it worked much better.

This starter works well with nature occuring yeast. It does not use store bought yeast. It produces a great bread as long as you baby the starter like it states in the directions.

Just found this recipe but wondered if yeast is not used or was it omitted

The whole wheat starter is great.  No store bought yeast needed.  Believe it or not, the stuff floating around in the air is enough to produce a great sour dough starter and, according to sour dough aficionados, the only way to make "real" sour dough.  Just take care of the yeast, no metal, anywhere from 60 to 80 degrees F temp is the best for beginning the starter.  If it is too hot you can get weird things growing, too cold, well it just takes a while to get going.  Follow the directions and feed your starter.  Store in the refrigerator once it is going and feed every week to keep it alive.

this is wonderful.  followed it exactly except I was out of honey so had to add a pinch of sugar.  I can't believe it is as seasoned as it tastes in just a week and a half.  Just made my first loaf of bread with it and it came out perfect. used the 'plain and simple sourdough bread' from this site.  kneaded by hand, 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes in the oven and it is perfect.  truly a great starter. love the wild sour taste.

I'm gonna give this a try. I mixed it all together and I will update my review after a couple weeks. I was looking for a starter that was natural yeast and this sounded like it was it. Does anyone know if there is a way to substitute starter in all recipes that call for yeast?UPDATE: I made sourdough bread and it is awesome. Now time to try pancakes, rolls... etc..... Thank you for posting this great recipe.

VERY impressed with the results of this recipe! I used "raw" honey and the bread it made was absolutely incredible! Both flavor and fluffiness are better than when I use store-bought yeast... Got my starter in the fridge ready to make more next weekend! May not be buying yeast anymore.....

I’ve been making this one for years now.  It’s my go to.  I almost always use it to make a San Francisco Sourdough recipe also on Allrecipes though it is versatile for pancakes and biscuits too. I don’t have a bread maker.  I find that kneading and beating the dough is a stress reliever.

The instructions do not mention feeding this starter for the first five days, so I didn't.  I fed it on the sixth day as instructed.  It never bubbled or foamed on top, but the liquid did separate.  To make sure I tried using it to make bread.  After at least six hours the dough didn't rise.

amazing. super easy lots of light delicious whole grain bread! i added a few organic unwashed grapes to the starter for a day or two then took them out. i use sprouted spelt flour and it's delicious. i often make it with raisins and cinnamon also. thank you so much!! after reading michael pollan's recipe i'm so happy to have found yours first or i would have been too intimidated.

Hundreds of recipes out there that need a food scale, a blend of flours, daily discarding, and multiple jars, but this so simple and it works! For anyone panicking about how their starter is working, here's some observations I made through the week (NOTE: I was not as diligent at note-taking as I was at stirring)

Night 1: lots of hooch already (black)
Day 2: more hooch, 2 or 3 bubbles on surface
Night 2: VERY sweet smell, 3-ish bubbles on surface but lots more visible beneath when I started stirring
Day 3: even stronger smell, hard and a bit dry looking on surface, yellow liquid underneath, mixes well and looks frothy
Night 3: took on vinegary undertones, more yellow liquid, more bubbles
DAY 4: sour fruit smell, fewer bubbles than last night [

I made this a couple of weeks ago but used half quantities throughout so as not to end up with so much starter. It worked perfectly and has produced super bread. No yeast is needed for this starter or for the bread. This is so good I shall be using it and passing it on to friends as well. Thank you.

Is it alright to omit the honey?
