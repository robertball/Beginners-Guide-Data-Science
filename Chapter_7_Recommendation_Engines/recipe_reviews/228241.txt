LOVE this recipe!  I have tried to recreate bibimpop, which is next to impossible in the States.  This was FANTASTIC!   I began the recipe by frying some tofu in the oil (wok.... 1 inch width slices.  Key is to not touch the slices for 7 minutes until you flip!) as my rice was cooking (in the rice cooker).  Then, I followed the recipe as written, but threw in some thawed freezer veggies as well (broccoli and spinach) with the shoots, sprouts, and shrooms.  I mixed the rice, soy sauce, and onions in a separate bowl, and we each served our own since I will kill people with gochu chung or siracha.  I give this 10 stars.  I have been searching for a good bibimpop recipe, and this reminded me of Korea as much as the ingredients could allow!!!  Loved the addition of the mushrooms.  I will make this over and over.  THANK YOU!  Perfect!

This was delicious and easy. I didn't bother to fry the rice, I just cooked it in my rice maker, and added soy sauce and green onions to my own plate. Reminds me of Loco Mocos in Hawaii, minus the salsbury steak, and with veggies. LOL

I thought this was good. It reminded me of my college days. This was served like this for breakfast, with an egg on top, at the Asian places on campus. For lunch they would sub. the egg with cut up chicken or beef. It was pretty quick to make, because I had leftover rice yesterday from the rice cooker. I just heated the rice, green onion, and soy sauce in the microwave to save on pans. I had the green onion, carrots, and zucchini and not the other vegetables and it was fine. I don't remember this having more than like 2 or 3 vegetables. I just made 1 serving and everything fit in one small pot and one tiny frying pan for the egg. It's a little salty, but I have that experience with most recipes that contain soy sauce. I did use low sodium. I would definitely have the chili sauce on hand. I used sirachi. Although, it is hot. So, I just put a few drops here and there. It's all that it needed.

Bibimbap is one of my favorite foods on the planet but I have never tried to make it at home before.  This recipe made it both easy and delicious!  I didn't bother to fry the rice -- just served the veggies over some hot, freshly-cooked basmati. A generous squeeze of Sriracha on top of my egg, and I was a very happy camper indeed.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This was super delicious! Mix up all ingredients and enjoy. The only thing I did differently is to double up on the bean sprouts instead of using bamboo shoots (not a big fan.) This only took several minutes to assemble and turned out to be absolutely delicious.

The wonderful thing about bibimbap is that you can make it with whatever is in the house. It's as common as a hamburger in South Korea, and everyone makes it differently (I lived in South Korea for a year). We've used peppers, kale and tofu. To me  the most important ingredients for a bibimbap is the gochuchang (spicy pepper sauce), sesame oil, egg, and the rice.

Delicious!!! I would have preferred 2 eggs (my husband had 2 and wished he had 3) but that might be personal preference. Can't wait to make again!

Easy, healthy, and delicious! I've always been a big bibimbap fan, and this is a good recipe to use as a base. I didn't cook the rice the way instructed in the recipe, but I've always used plain old cooked rice as the base for bibimbap and it was still very tasty.

Fairly bland, the only flavor it has was from the hot sauce.  I put the hot sauce on the side so I could see what it tasted it liked without the hot sauce and it wasn't that flavorful.

So good! I wish I had double this recipe as we would love more of this as leftovers (making an egg when reheating).  This is definitely something that will be going into the recipe rotation.

Yum Yum!!  I had to make a few changes for what I had on hand.  I didn't have bamboo shoots, but did have water chestnuts, so I used those.  Also for the first time in my life I had no mushrooms!  So those got left out.  I couldn't find my sweet chili sauce so I used garlic chili sauce.  This was delicious and got to use up my zucchini I desperately needed to use :) :)

Very fresh and easy to make! I like extra rice and doubling it really made the meal go further and have a more even rice to vegi ratio. Try it with teriyaki and sriracha.

My favorite dish! My mom always made it whenever we had leftovers, and it's still one of my favorite dishes of all time! I love it when she added mushrooms and dubu in it too. She would always call me every time she started making them too, just to make sure I wanted some. I still make it myself too!

Even though my daughter didn't like this at all, I am giving it 5 stars because I like it enough for both of us!I made it with brown rice to increase the nutritional value. This is simple to make, healthy, and open to many variations and adjustments. I will be making this many times in the future. Thanks so much!

We love this!  I skip the bamboo shoots and double up on the mushrooms -- fresh sliced, not canned (yuck).  To make it easier, I just cook plain, brown rice, add the green onions to the veggies at the end, just to warm them through, add soy sauce and a few grinds of the pepper and then serve the veggies on top of the rice, top that with the fried egg and drizzle on some Sriracha!  Along with kimchi from the supermarket and we're happy campers!

I have been trying to cook more vegetarian meals, and this was fantastic! The only changes that I made were to add baby corn and to scramble the egg. I also didn't cool the rice before mixing with the other ingredients.

It was tasty and healthy, but it took too long to cook. Too much work. I'll order it from a restaurant next time. I was done in a hour and a half.

Made it as written, but without the bean sprouts. My picky husband LOVED it and asked when we could have it again. Super easy and cheap; ingredients you'd usually have on hand. So good, I wanted to eat 10 bowls of it! Will definitely make it again.

Made this as written except used fresh mushrooms and garlic chili sauce instead of sweet red, and coconut oil instead of sesame (that's what I had).  It was very tasty and very spicy since I added lots of chili sauce.

Added chopped fresh spinach to the second phase of vegetables. This was fabulous! Hearty, healthy, and delicious. My four picky children loved the simple flavors and half of them had seconds. Yum!

Great vegetarian option and easy to make. With the exception of bamboo shoots, I used all fresh ingredients. Felt the recipe could use a little more soy sauce, but that's a personal preference (used Tamari low sodium soy sauce). Sweet Chili sauce with this recipe worked very well. Will definitely make again!

This was okay. It's not really Korean-Style bibimbap - no kimchi, no gochujang, no acid/pickling on any veggies, no hot pot for crispy rice - but if you take it for what it is it's a decent meal. Basically, this makes a healthy Asian veggie rice. Kind of bland but that is easily fixed with sauce of your choice. If I make again I might snag some veggies from an Asian food market so I can get some pickled goodies in this dish. I wasn't a fan of the soy sauce mixed in with the rice, would rather get some more flavor on the veggies so I can serve over plain rice. Good base recipe, will play with it!

This was very good.  I did modify it though.  I started by sauteing a little garlic and fresh ginger with the veggies.  I omitted the bean sprouts, bamboo and canned mushrooms and replaced them with extra carrots and some asparagus.  I thought it was delicious on it's own, but my husband ate it with a little sriracha.

I thought this was very good. I saved time by not chilling my rice, and serving it hot. Also I had no bamboo on hand, so I used fresh bok choy instead. still very good. Next time I will give the bamboo a try.

I made this for my husband and myself. We've only had Bibimbap at restaurants, but this was delicious and easy.  We both had seconds!

This was simple and good. My husband was weirded out by the fried egg on top, but I thought it added a nice dimension as well as needed protein!  I added some siracha as well for heat. This is easily adaptable with most veggies; I used carrots, broccoli and bamboo shoots. Nice and easy, I will make this again.

I made this for my adult vegetarian daughter.  My vegetarian recipes are rather  limited so I was happy to find this recipe.  She loved it and ate two big bowls!  I used fresh thinly sliced mushrooms and  soy bean sprouts. I also used pink madagascar rice which was a delicious addition.  I loved this dish also so I'll be making it it the future!

I love this recipe. I will definitely make it again. Its good with everything added together too. My two sons will eat this up in a heartbeat, and the youngest is a true meat eater and picky as all get out. I served Texas Toast with it for a more filling meal.
This is very easy to make, but I throw everything in one pan sometimes when I'm in a hurry. For more veggies I throw in choppped broccoli with the the rice and onions.

This is a fantastic take on bibimbap.   I also use a spicy chili sesame oil to fry the egg or to fry some meat in and it adds a great kick to the dish.   I have also left out the bamboo shoots and mushrooms in the past and the recipe is just as good.

Yeah, so I didn't have the sprouts or water chestnuts OR the chilli sauce but I had some sweet orange ginger sauce and it turned out great. I'm trying to eat less meat and this is a great quick meal. Substitute minute brown rice and you have a great meal for lunch or after you get home from working late.

Yum this is so good! It's perfect because the ingredients can be altered a little to what you have on hand and you can still get that great taste.  I served this with some kimchi that I needed to use! Thank you!

Ran out of white rice so used brown.  Was very yummy!  Bought some of the hot pot bibimbap bowls and used them to serve...recommend!  Also found a gochuchang sauce recipe online and that really punched up the dish.

This was yummy.  The  runny egg yolk makes it nice and creamy.  I made two eggs per person.  I didn't have bamboo shoots or bean sprouts but added the other vegetables.  I added some red pepper and mushrooms.  I will make it again.

Such a great recipe! The only thing I added was water chestnuts and I doubled the amount of carrots since I didn’t have zucchini. Make sure you cook the veggies a little longer than you think you’ll need to — the water chestnuts were still too crunchy!

Loved it!
To be honest, I chose the recipe because I had some older carrots, older zucchini and, oddly enough, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts that I had forgotten about and found in the back of my pantry.
As I was making it, I was convinced it would be bland, and was tempted to start throwing stuff in.  
But it was so good!  (I did add a teaspoon or so of wasabi leftover from some takeaway...barely noticable)
Glad I held off.  Will definitely make it again! (as I always seem to buy more zucchini and carrots than I use :-)
Thank you for sharing!!!

We really liked this! I didn't have sprouts or bamboo shoots, and I used fresh mushrooms and red bell pepper, along with the carrots. I was unsure of the zucchini, but it tasted great! This morning I cooked another egg and the kid ate the leftovers slathered in sriracha for breakfast. Thank you!

This was my first taste of bibimbap and I loved it made with these changes. I used 10 fresh mushrooms and 1/2 red pepper slivered as well as 2 cups of baby spinach and fresh bean sprouts. The only canned vegetable was the bamboo . I substituted brown rice for the white and ponzu sauce for the soya. Before adding the egg, I topped the veggies with 2 tbsp.jarred Pandjur sauce and topped the egg with Asian sweet chili sauce.  Fantastic and will make again.

This dish is fabulous! I had some leftover zucchini in the fridge so I decided to try this recipe. I didn't have most of the other vegetables so I added some sliced sweet onion and broccoli florets to make up for it. I didn't cook my rice since I made it fresh and just poured a bit of soy sauce over the rice and vegetables together before putting my egg on top. This is quick and satisfying!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it is excellent. Actually I did change one thing - as soon as the rice was done I tossed the soy sauce, etc. into the pot and stirred it up. Let that sit while I stir-fried the veggies, then all I had to do was fry each egg while plating. It was perfect! One strong word of caution, use PURE SESAME OIL, not toasted! Toasted sesame oil is dellicious but would overwhelm this dish.

Super tasty! Filling and easy. Didn’t have bean sprouts but didn’t miss them. Might add more zucchini next time. The gochuchang really topped it off.

It was a good alternative to our weekly stir-fry.  I made it exactly like the recipe called for, but thought the flavor was a bit bland.  Putting the sweet chili sauce on it helped.  I've got leftovers.  I'll try them with Sriracha tomorrow.  Next time I make this I'll have to put some meat in it.

My hubby and I love this Korean delight and finding this version was great! Can/t always put all the ingredients it calls, but when we have most of them, we just go for it playing with substitutions (palm hearts for bamboo shots for example).  Simple, fast and delicious =)

I dropped a few ingredients and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, but it was delicious.  Both my boyfriend and I were very pleased with the results and such an easy recipe too.

The only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms because I don't care for canned. I thought this was pretty great, but my husband wasn't impressed and thought it needed something.

I'm not familiar with Korean  food, but I can across this recipe and decided to try it. It's super simple to make and really tasty. I never would have thought to try fried egg on rice, but it's good! The flavors are not strong, but I added sriracha and sweet chili sauce to different portions and both were yummy.

I followed everything in the recipe, but I used poached eggs at the end instead of fried.  My family didn't care for the (salty) canned sprouts and shoots.  I was really hoping to love this, but it was not that flavorful, just salty.

Very quick and easy to make!  I left out the bamboo shoots and  used fresh bean sprouts and mushrooms.  Both my kids liked it, except next time we will leave out the mushrooms and substitute snow peas.  We definitely will make this recipe again!

Amazing! I made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit! That fried egg on top makes all the difference. When the yolk mixes in with the rice and vegetables... omg, so good. I couldn't find bamboo shoots in my grocery store so I had to  do without. I thinly sliced a fresh shiitake mushroom instead of canned and used fresh bean sprouts instead of canned but otherwise I followed the recipe. Next time I might add a chopped celery stalk or two and maybe either chicken, beef or pork.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Oh wow, this was so good! And really easy. Everyone liked it (I have picky kids), everyone ate a huge amount, and one of my kids said that it was the best thing I've ever made- it might even be better than smoked salmon! This will definitely become part of our permanent meal plan.

Awesome! Everybody loved it. Definitely a keeper and an excellent dinner for vegetarians. All I did was make a bit more to serve 4 and for seconds, and I added quinoa to cook with the rice...I like the combination. Served the hot sauce, and soy  on the side so everyone could control the amount of heat they wanted. Now I won't have to go out to get my bibimbap fix.

This was surprisingly good and very easy to make. I used leftover quinoa because I already had some in the fridge and I left out the bamboo shoots. My husband loved it but said next time I should use more than one egg. I will definitely be making this again!

Very Good... word of caution though.... recipe says it takes about 50 minutes to make which is true but be aware that most of that time is used in the prep work... once you actually start cooking it goes very quickly. So if you planning to do like I did and make steak for the meat eaters you need to allow for this or you'll end up with the Bibimbap done before your steak has fully cooked, next time I am going to put the steak on the grill when there is about 2 minute to 3 minutes left on the cooking time in step 1 that way when I get about 1/2 way through the cooking time in step 2 I can flip the steak allowing it to finishing cooking and should be done about the same time that my Bibimbap is, depending on the thickness of the steak (the ones we had were "London Broil" about 1" thick... perfect for grilling on the bar-be-que. All it all though this was a hit... even with the one person that isn't really found of any dish that contains any type of rice. Taking that into account I would still give this recipe 5 star. I used brown rice instead of the white rice and I also added water chestnuts because the primary individual that has to eat Vegetarian loves them.

I loved this! When I made it I forgot to add the bamboo, but I loved it just the same. When I fried the egg I left it pretty runny, and having the yolk touch all of the other food was really delicious! And I've discovered a new love for the sauce!

This was good but not great. Partly due to to the fact that I can't add salt. So I added a sprinkle of Chinese 5 spice instead. Not a good move! Also a lot of chopping. I will try it again some time.

So good. We loved it so much we made it again the next night! I followed the recipe but used fresh bean sprouts.  First night I used the canned mushrooms and second night I used fresh shitakes.  It was good both ways so I'd say just use what you have on hand.

I'm very happy with this recipe.  Honestly, I'm a bit simplistic.  I just did the carrots, zucchini, and fresh mushrooms.  Still tasted great.  I used sriracha sauce but I'm pretty sure the hot sauce tasted a little different the last time I tried this dish in a Korean restaurant... not sure which brand to buy but I'm happy none the less.

Love this. Girlfriend doesn't like the smell of canned bamboo shoots so I sometimes use water chestnuts when she is with me. I think she is crazy.

For the vegetables I used a large leek, 2 carrots, 4 stalks of celery, a red pepper, a small zucchini, 4 mushrooms and 1 bag of bean sprouts. I made 2 different sauces instead of just soya sauce, one was spicy and the other was not, I drizzled some of the non spicy sauce on the vegetables before serving over the rice, then everyone drizzled whichever sauce on their own plate to taste.

We didn't use canned veggies (with exception of bamboo shoots).For mushrooms I suggest white button or baby portobellos.

The smell of this dish made me a little nervous while it was cooking, but it turned out very tasty.   I added chili in oil, sweet chili sauce, and sriracha sauce to the sesame oil to give the vegetables extra flavor and a little kick.  I also included fried tofu on the side.  Everybody loved it!

There wasn't near enough sauce to give this dish any flavor.  It was very bland.

Quite delicious. I'll be making this frequently. I also added snap peas with the carrots/zucchini, but I should have thrown them in a little earlier because they ended up a bit too crunchy in the end. I also mixed Sriracha with the sweet chili sauce to emphasize the chili over the sweet.

7.2.2015 ~ I really enjoyed this very different dish.  Hubs liked it, but wondered "where the meat was and why was there a dunky egg on the top".  I have never heard of bibimbap, but am very glad I found this recipe.  The egg added a very nice creaminess to the entire dish.  I omitted the mushrooms due to personal tastes, and used sliced peppers and onions in place of the sprouts and shoots as I didn't have any on hand.  I will make this again, when I have those two ingredients. I think this is a great vegetarian meal option.  Thanks for sharing, Lisa.

OH MY GOSH!!!!! This was absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS!! I will make this over and over and over! It was also very easy to make. I don't even need the fried egg with it. It would probably change it up and add shrimp or tofu to it. This is light yet very filling!

This was really good (and we don't usually like Korean food!); I left out the mushrooms and added red bell peppers as well as substituting brown rice for white (so I guess it seemed a little more like Thai other than the fact it includes eggs!). Added a photo of how it turned out! I don't eat meat but my husband does and this was one of those dishes where I didn't need to add meat to his for him to love it also :)

Whole family really enjoyed this dish, even as the vegetarian option, which kids sometimes complain. Very flavourful and the egg definitely makes the dish. Found a healthy can of premixed bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and baby corn cobs. Drained the cans, and worked well. Otherwise, followed the recipe as indictated. Doubled the recipe to seving size six, very accurate. Will defintiely put in our recipe line up.
