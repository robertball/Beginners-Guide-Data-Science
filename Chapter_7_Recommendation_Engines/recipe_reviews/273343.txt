Made as written and this was okay but I would definitely make a couple of changes next time. While I love the flavor of lime, the juice made the popcorn soggy. The chili powder was also a bit overwhelming and crazy as  it sounds, the popcorn needed more salt. This was a fun recipe and one I will make again but I do think it needs some tweaks.
