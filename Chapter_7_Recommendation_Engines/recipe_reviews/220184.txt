Great, simple recipe! I had a package with both broccoli and cauliflower combined, so I added both to this recipe, and it was delicious. I also added a bit of sweet to the vinegarette to balance the flavor a bit (agave syrup). I wanted to also comment on Chef John's video presentation. He has a wonderful down-to-earth way about him and I picked up a lot of good tips about broccoli preparation in general from this video. Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!

This was fantastic! Cut the olive oil in half because I thought it might be too oily. It was great like that. It's a definite keeper for us. 3 of us ate it all up it was so delicious with a little bit left for hubby's lunch tomorrow. Follow Chef John's video.
I just have to add to my review: we have made this several times since my last rating and I LOVE this stuff!! I follow the video exactly for cutting it and putting it in cold water to stop the cooking. I do cut the oil though, because it would be way too oily if we did not. When I make it now I have to make extra we love it so much. I have never been a fan of broccoli in the past and do not really care for it raw. But I have become a fan of broccoli because of this recipe. It is simple to make and the red pepper flakes give it a nice appearance and pizzazz if making it for company.

I would have given this five stars but it had too much olive oil for my taste. Next time I will cut the olive oil in half. Other than that, the flavor was really good.

So simple, yet so good!  This really perks up regular 'ol broccoli and delivers a nice amout of sweet and heat.  I did cut back on the olive oil a bit but other than that didn't change a thing.  This is excellent warm or cold and would be great over green beans or brussel sprouts as well.  I liked the dressing so much I added a little sugar and it was perfect over a mixed green salad.  Thanks Chef John!

Nice, easy, and tasty.  I only used a couple tablespoons of olive oil, and let it sit in the fridge for an hour.  Served with grilled salmon kabobs, and the orzo with basil and parmesan from this site.

Who knew something so simple could be so good?  This has such a fresh clean taste.  The dressing is a bit more acidic than I like but that's just me.  I added about 1/2 tsp honey to balance it out.  We'll have this often!  I bet this would be great with asparagus, too.  Tomorrow night!

I bought 2 bags of broccoli cauliflower mix.  I steamed them for 4 minutes, dumped in a bowl and put right in frig for an hour, took them out mixed with dressing and let sit at room temp 30 mins-no peeling slicing draining or straining-plus the veggies retain more of their nutrients

Used only florets and tested after boiling for two minutes, which was plenty of time to cook tender.  Cut the oil back to 2 T. and next time will cut the rice vinegar back to 1 T.  Might be more interesting with cauliflower florets and thinly sliced carrots added.

Scrumptious! Absolutely too much oil, so the only change I made was to reduce the oil to 3 Tablespoons.  Very refreshing flavor.  I've served it both warm and cold. I like it both ways, but hubby says he prefers cooked broccoli warm. I had the leftovers a few days later and even though the broccoli was no longer bright green (due to sitting in the dressing so long), it still tasted delicious.

This salad is very refreshing. It was so yummy, we didn't have enough to fully satisfy our new craving for broccoli salad. The children are hoping we have more again soon. I did go light on the red pepper at first, but will only increase that slowly over time, until we figure out what 'pinch' means for our family. Also, just to cut down on dishes (we don't have a dishwasher, & we are a busy family), we cheated by draining & rinsing the broccoli right in its pan, then adding a bit of ice to some water in the same pan. After it cooled fully (hardly any time at all), we continued by draining the broccoli very well (but gently) using a towel, since we do have a clothes' washer! *grin* Then we put the broccoli back into the pot & added the salad dressing in the pot before presenting it in a nice, oversized soup-bowl sized bowl. It was lovely, & it chilled quickly in the fridge. Chilling truly is not needed for this to be enjoyable; both my daughter & I sampled some right after mixing in the dressing. However, the salad also chills very well; which we know because we had to wait for the main dish to be done)-We used a hand blender in a tall cup to blend the dressing & didn't have to even lightly chop the garlic as it blended right in.(2Make for a crowd (which we might), make dressing in a jar!)  Then, after folding the dressing into the salad, we simply washed the blender & the cup together with hot water. It was so little mess for such a beautiful salad. Thanks, Chef John!

Very fresh, watch the video for great tips!  I followed his advice and the broccoli was perfectly cooked, not mushy, and made my mouth pop!  :-)  Thanks for this!

Prepared this as a side dish with burgers.  I also blanched carrot slices and cucumbers for this - it was very good and colorful.  I didn't put as much pepper flakes in the recipe for our taste, and omitted the vinegar, but used a little more lemon juice.  Very tasty.  Will make again.  Thank you Chef John.

Good but needed a little more , so I added roasted garlic seasoning and some thinly sliced purple onion for color variation.

We love broccoli, but I think family was tired of the usual sauteed broccoli with garlic.  This salad has the perfect tang and family appreciated a new recipe.  Thank you, Chef John.

I have always made it a habit to read over the reviews when attempting a new dish, however, I must had been in a hurry to get this on the table and completely forget to read one single review.  Needless to say it was quite oily and the flavor was lost.  I tried adding more of the other ingredients and I added way too much lemon, that of course was my fault. I'm sure I will get a chance to try it again because I like other ways to eat broccoli other than just steamed.

Really like the dressing.  I didn't have lemon juice, and only used 1T of WHITE wine vinegar and a tsp of lemon zest.  Added less than 2T of quality evoo.  I can see this on reg rotation.  I found that my broccoli steamed in less than 4 min.  I'll keep a closer eye on it next time.

I made this a few times and for me, it is 5 stars with one caveat: it doesn't need that much olive oil. I added less than half and thought it worked fine. My family and I love broccoli and this was a fun way to make it more interesting without overpowering the taste of the veggie. I also like that the recipe makes good use of the stem. I served with lemon broiled salmon and rice.

Yum!  Light and fresh and very easy.  I steamed my broccoli for 5-6 minutes and I cut down on the oil (used 2 TB).  This is tangy but in a good way.  Will make again!

Made this night before last, and it was great.  Even the leftovers which I had last night were still firm and delicious.  Next time, I think I'll add some crispy bacon and sprinkle of parmigiana cheese on top.

I've always liked adding a little something to broccoli, usually a bit of parmesan cheese. My man is a a big fan of all things lemony, so I gave this a try. We both loved it. If I change anything at all, I'd reduce the amount of vinegar by a wee bit.

Excellent way to prepare broccoli.  Very fresh tasting and very tasty too.  I steamed the broccoli but made no other changes  I always enjoy Chef John's videos.  He is so entertaining and his recipes are great.

I have to say this wasn't my favorite; i prefer plain brocoli!  I think it's because I'm not typically a fan of  horseradish/dijon mustard and I found the flavour of that overpowering.  However, if you like those, you will like this recipe.

Not good for me at all.  Maybe way too much vinegar or lemon but it was not nice.

This recipe was excellent!  Even a vegetable hater would love it.  I made it with one head of broccoli without the stems and the regular amount of sauce.  About 2 large servings plus a little for the dog who also loved it.  I served it with roast rosemary chicken and roast sweet potatoes.

This recipe is just so good!  I've made it several times in the past month.  It is just that good.  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe indicates and it was delicious, but I wasn't loving the red pepper flakes.  So now I skip that part and it is still very flavorful.

Made it luke warm instead of a cold salad. Was good but think next time will increase spices and decrease olive oil. Good flavor all in all though.

This is NOT what I think of as a "broccoli salad."  It made a tasty warm side dish though.  We tried it 'cool' and microwaved it to heat it back up; we much preferred it warm.  To make the dressing, we whirled everything in the food processor and only used enough olive oil to make it 'creamy'.  I think 1/3C of oil would be too much.

I needed a make-ahead vegetable for a pot luck. This was easy and portable. I added some steamed baby carrots for color. This was gobbled up!

Quick and delicious.  I followed everything exactly the first time.  As far as taste, texture and calories, I didn't mind the amount of olive oil called for, but I do agree with everyone that it can be reduced, especially if you're in diet mode.  Jillian gave us a great suggestion to try fresh green beans or brussel sprouts & Nana Deb added cauliflower.  Their ideas inspired me to go crazy with it and try a medley - smaller cuts of broccoli, cauliflower, quartered brussel sprouts, green beans, carrots, button mushrooms and fresh chopped parsley.  My crew thought it was tasty.  I've also made the dressing as a salmon marinade with addition of dried dill & tarragon (I loved it but got mixed reviews from the crew). I'm taking the medley version to a bbq tomorrow so I thought I'd share my thoughts and let all of you know how much I appreciate and inspired by your ideas. To quote Chef John "AND AS ALWAYS...ENJOY!"

This was somewhat bland so I added sliced red onion which helped some, but not enough.

YES and I love it.  It is an excellent source of fiber and calcium.
I tweaked it only slightly and added a touch of sugar or stevia and reduced the olive oil in half. I am going to make it again and add equal amounts of cauliflower. SKAY

This had a good flavor, but I thought the olive oil was too much so I cut it back. That helped make it not so greasy.  I need to learn how to mash garlic into a paste.. My dressing was pretty chunky!  :). But I did like the flavor overall and will make this again. Thanks.

This was pretty good broccoli. A nice change from our usual boiled and buttered fare.  I served it chilled.

Yummy and simple. Reduced oil by half based on previous reviews, and I definitely recommend it. Only used 2 cloves of garlic because the kiddos complain that garlic is "too spicy" but I'll use all 3 cloves next time.

This was very tastey. I should have cooked for only 5 minutes from the moment I dropped the broccolli into the water (it was a little mushy).

Ok, what did I do wrong??? Could not get the dressing to thicken up using a small whisk.  The broccoli cooked fine at 6 mins. It spouse would rather not eat a cold salad broccoli.  May try this again as we like broccoli.. Thanks!
