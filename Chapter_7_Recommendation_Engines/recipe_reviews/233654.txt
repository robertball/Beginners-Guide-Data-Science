Disclaimer – I don’t like asparagus or whole wheat pasta, so I omitted the asparagus and used my regular pasta.  Also, I used dried herbs. Despite those changes, this was fabulous.  I cooked the chicken and then set aside covered with foil, then cooked the remaining ingredients in that pan to capture all the chicken flavor and save on cleaning pans.  At the very end, I placed the chicken in the sauce to finish.  This is delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

It was easy and very good.  Everyone loved it.  didn't go the olive oil route.  Used butter all the way.  Yum.

Sliced the chicken instead of leaving whole. Really like the buttermilk-based sauce, though it was rather watery even after cooking, but felt the spinach was overkill. I think it would have tasted better with just the asparagus. We ended up adding the pasta to the sauce to try and soak it up a little. If we make again, would add more flour and leave out the spinach.

Really good! Tastes like more calories than it is.  I make it ahead and freeze it. Just make sure to get high quality linguine if you are going to freeze it. The flavor is great. The sauce was too thin but I might have missed something. I was impressed overall.

A bit complicated to put together for a weeknight. I also didn't care for the flavor.

Very good recipe. Did not use red pepper because I don't like it, but other than that, followed recipe exactly. Loved it. Good way to sneak in some spinach.

This was excellent and will definitely make again. I recommend wisking together the Buttermilk, Parmesan cheese, wine and flour together before adding to the sauce pan.
I used dry herbs, I added about a 1/2 cup chopped onion, I doubled the garlic and also added extra Parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce a little more.

I made this to the letter.  Amazing!  Wanted to pray a prayer of thanks after every bite!  Can not WAIT to make it again soon... Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!! (Next time, I'll snap a pic to add to this recipe.
