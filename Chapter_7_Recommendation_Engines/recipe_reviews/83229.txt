This is a really good jam with an Indian twist. Just be careful while boiling it -- it shouldn't get too hard sticky. Take it off the flame before it thickens too much.

This is a really nice recipe. I think it needs some preservative if you want to keep it for months, but i kept it in my fridge and it stayed fine for two months.

I was looking for something different for a local strawberry jam contest.  I used St. Julian sweet red wine & the jam which didn't really thicken was overpowered with the gingerroot. i was very disappointed.

Delicious and simple... a lovely combination of sweet and spicy.  I used this on the peanut butter and jam cookies from this site and they disappeared by the next day.

I split the chile pepper down the middle and removed the seeds before tossing it into the pot for more punch. I also used less ginger than called for and Concorde wine. Spectacular on whole wheat english muffins with melted butter. What a treat!

this stuff is amazing. Love the ginger flavor. Made a batch without the jalapeno; simply amazing as an ice cream topping! I probably put 2 T of ginger in my match because I love the extra flavor

The flavor of the strawberries, ginger, and cinnamon is completely lost and I think the wine overpowers the jam.  I won't make this again.
