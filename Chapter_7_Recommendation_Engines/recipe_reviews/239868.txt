I made this over a dozen times and it's become my standard sweet/spicy side for ham. The only things I would adjust is that it's a bit hot (too much vinegar & mustard). I cut the vinegar in half and substitute with water. Also I use half the amount of mustard seed. One last thing is that I use half granny smith and half fuji apple. I notice I get more chunks this way as the granny smiths tend to break down into sauce. Thnx Chef John.

Amazing recipe.  I added a seeded scotch bonnet to give it more spicy hot flavour.  Awesome on crackers.

I would definely cut the vinegar in 1/2 and substitute with water next time. I had to add about a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/4 cup if not more of brown sugar to save it. It seemed to work and should pair well now with the pork chops I intended it for.

I had never eaten chutney before, but I had a huge box of apples from my cousin's tree and wanted to try something new.  Absolutely delicious, wouldn't change a thing, my favourite condiment to eat with pork, although good with anything.  I just finished making a double batch yesterday, and now its sitting pretty in my pantry waiting to be eaten.

I love chutney but have never made any before. I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was very good. I think it tastes even better after a couple days when the flavours have combined, and could be used to accompany many different dishes.

I love chutneys so I had to try this.  I used translucent apples, fresh nectarines a bit of pineapple and dried cranberries and it was wonderful with a smoked beef brisket.   has the consistency of chunky applesauce. I also used just a bit of lavender balsamic vinegar so my finished product doesn't have the pretty golden color, but it tastes wonderful.
