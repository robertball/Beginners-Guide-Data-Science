these are actually quite delicious.  Being Dutch from the Netherlands here is how I adapted these "oil balls" as my kids call them in English.  My parents used beer but I tried this recipe using a room temperature sparkling water.  Worked great.  Typically I only let the dough rise a couple of hours.  This too worked great.  I figured it out using the Weight Watcher points and I think if I make them a mini size they are 3 points and then I can have two!  They are a personal favorite and we always put a little food coloring in the powdered sugar and start making these Dutch homemade donuts towards fall.  I have been know to sneak in bits of Halloween candy!  Its all yummy.  I will try to post a picture when I have made a batch of mini Ollibollen.
