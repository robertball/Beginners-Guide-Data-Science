This is EXCELLENT! No changes needed. I bought an avocado for garnish but after tasting this once it sat in the fridge overnight I decided not to use it. It really doesn't need it and might actually take away from the deliciousness you've already got going on. Maybe not but I saved my avocado for another use. I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It is light, refreshing, flavorful, pretty, easy, and the lists goes on. It would be excellent served over a bed of lettuce too. Hearts of palms are expensive but I promise you won't be disappointed in this recipe. I highly recommend this.
