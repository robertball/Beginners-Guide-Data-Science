Hi - this is my recipe but I think the folks at allrecipes.com altered it a bit.  The cheese should be increased as one of you mentioned - and the chunky applesauce and crunchy onions on top are a must for flavor!!  Hope this helps :)

I thought this was good! Maybe a little bland...next time I will use 1 cup of Gruyere AND 1 cup of Emmentaller cheese, plus lots of salt and pepper! There were a lot of onions as is, but i did top with applesauce to serve..yummy!!

Since you slice the potatoes anyway, I scrubbed and sliced them before boiling and it only took 10 minutes, then kept the skin on for nutrition. I boiled the noodles only 4 minutes knowing they would cook more in the oven anyway with the added liquid. I used 1/3 c Wisconsin Brick cheese and 1/3 c Fontina and only 1/4 c Gruyere. I had only milk, so I didn't use heavy cream. I baked it covered for 45 min at 350 and it was perfect.

Different, but different does not necessarily translate to good.   My family did not care for this dish.  It was not very good.  I will stick to a more traditional mac and cheese next time.

Delish! Made this for my work holiday party and everyone asked for the recipe. Wasn't crazy about the apple sauce but the crunchy onions are a must!

We just got back from Switzerland and had this dish. It was made with the noodles and potatoes, but the onions were served carmelized on top.  Excellent! I liked it so much, I came to here in search of the recipe!  Can't wait to try it!

I just happened across this recipe - my initial reaction was pasta and potatoes together sounded strange. I usually search through allrecipes to figure out what to make for dinner (at dinnertime!), so I'm always looking for something matches what I have on hand.  That said, I almost never make something as-written. So I used a different kind of pasta and chedder, because that's what I had. I did the onions on the side & added to my plate, because my kids won't eat them. (The chedder probably worked well for the first time because my kids are super picky & they like cheddar.)  

I loved it and will be looking for the right kind of cheese to make this again! I tried it with applesauce but I wasn't a big fan of the sweet taste with it. I will try the applesauce again with the correct cheese & see if that makes a difference. I will also make my potato slices thinner next time (they didn't quite get soft enough & I had to put back in the oven, even though I had boiled them first according to the recipe). 

Thank you for submitting this.  I love trying new things from different parts of the world!

This was very good, and it makes me sad that I messed up in following the directions. I peeled the potatoes before boiling. I thought I would save some time. Bad idea. If I had left the potatoes in their jackets, they would have cooked evenly. Taking the peel off promotes the outside cooking far more quickly than the inside and it turns to mush. I had to cut the cooking time and slice them up. So I had under cooked potato in this otherwise lovely dish. The flavor is outstanding! I would recommend browning the onions just slightly. The extra flavor adds great depth. This is a real keeper recipe!
