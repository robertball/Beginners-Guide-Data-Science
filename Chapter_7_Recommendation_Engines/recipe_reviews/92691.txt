I've been making these for years. This is an excellent recipe & much easier than my old one. Less time consuming, and tastes just as great!

I made a big mistake by making these for a cookie exhange.  If I had more time I would make something else.  They are way to sweet.  I only sprinkled them with powdered sugar. My son did not like them at all & he loves candy and cookies, JUST TOO SWEET. They weren't the perfect balls either.

Very interesting flavor. I didn't have any almonds, so I used chpped walnuts and I think that made it even tastier. The almond extract is easily detected and mixed well with the walnuts. This is another great addition to my Christmas Cookie tins that I give away.

Very very good!  I added alittle more almond extract.  Takes great with the chocolate.  I bought a bag of kisses that were already unwrapped..they come in a bag of about 54.  Very convenient.  Great cookies.
