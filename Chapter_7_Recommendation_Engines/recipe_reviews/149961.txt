I followed the recipe roughly but didn't want to deep fry, so I just put 1/4 c. melted butter with about 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. nutmeg, and 1 TBSP sugar along with the potatoes in a bowl to coat them.  Baked in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20-25 min. turning frequently.  Very tasty and not as sugary as this recipe calls for.

i love sweet potatoes, but not this recipe. the potatoes were VERY sweet with the sugar coating and didn't need the glaze to make them sweeter. i was making for 6 so used 4 sweet potatoes, no one liked them so now have to figure out what to do with the already cooked overly sweet potatoes.

Just made this for hubby and myself.  It turned out great.  I added about 2 teaspoons of light brown sugar to the bag.  I also skipped the glaze.  I tried to drain on paper towel.  Would not recommend as the fries stuck to the paper towel.  I let the fries cool on a glass plate.  This gave the edges a nice crisp.  I will definitely be making this again.

Please do not fool your self into believing that this is a way to eat your vegetables. These are straight up sugar coated dessert sticks. My Kids actually said they tasted like 'pumpkin pie sticks" .  I prepared them exactly as the recipe was written, but didn't make the glaze. I don't think they needed them at all.  Also, one potato would have been enough to feel my family. I hope these heat up well, cause I have plenty left.  I will definitely make these again.   Edited to add:  These fries are soggy the next day, but after re-heating can be eaten with a fork, have more of a soft sweet potato texture, and flavor is still good.

Didn't use the glaze cause I was afraid they'd be too sweet, and they were absolutely perfect as is! Screw French Fries!

Frying with a sugar coating didn't work for me so I made a syrup.  I cut back cinnamon by 1/2 and added just enough water to liquify, then cooked it into a syrup, let it cool and drizzled over the fries.  Really good!

This recipe is great! It's quick and easy! Perfect for a snack or for company that just drops by. I used brown sugar instead of white, and I didn't bother with the glaze because everything was sweet enough. Make sure you serve it hot or else the sticks will stick together. I definitely will be making this again!!

This is a great recipe. However, I did change a few things. First I didnt use that much sugar, second, I added a little milk to the topping. Oh yea, and also I boiled the sweet potatoes a little before I fried them

Alert!!! This is dessert, not entree. But, if you'd like sweet potatoes that taste like doughnuts, go ahead.

I chose not to make the glaze and lightly topped it with powdered sugar instead. I coated the sweet potato fries in 3 tsps. homemade blend of pumpkin pie seasoning, 2 tsps. vanilla extract and half cup of sugar. I fried them in a pan; they didn't get crispy just slightly candied. I may try adding some cornstarch or flour to the mix and skipping the vanilla. Overall it is tasty, but definitely a treat for once in awhile. Served it with "Chicken and Waffles" from AR.

These were delecious, but very very sticky. Unless you want them tooth decayingly sweet, you don't need the icing.

I wasnt huge of this recipe but I'm not one for sweet potatoes.
The glaze IS good -- very sweet. I didn't add the sugar/cinn. coating before frying the fries but the glaze might be sweet enough as-is. 
but then again the glaze that i did make from this recipe wasn't enough for a whole sweet potato's worth of fries. i might try this again WITH the dusting of sugar/cinn. mixture.

I was really excited to make this recipe. Followed recipe exactly, and ended up with a hot, sticky clump of mess.

The glaze doesn’t work as printed. Will try more butter the next time. I think it should be 4 tbsp not tsp. The glaze turned rock hard
