I made this sherbet twice in a week.  That's how good it is!  The grape juice gives it a very refreshing taste.  I did cut the sugar back to 2 cups, because sweetened condensed milk is already super-sweet.  I also used lemon juice from the plastic lemons you get at the grocery store, because real lemons are expensive here at the moment. When you take the sherbet out of your ice cream machine, don't be disappointed if it seems not to have thickened as much as regular ice cream.  Once the sherbet is completely frozen in your freezer (cured), then it has a fabulous texture, and the taste improves as well.  Really excellent recipe!

This recipe should have won first place in the ice cream contest because it's a winner. This recipe has great taste and my family loves it. The flavor is better after it sets up and then it is terrific.

I tried this recipe out of curiousity; I wasn't sure what it would taste like. It turned out to be very delicious, a nice balance of fruity and creamy. I will make it again.

This sherbet was incredible--the texture is rich and creamy; the flavor superb!  Since Welch's Concord Grape 100% juice is very sweet on its own, I reduced the sugar by 1 cup. It was still sweet and had a gorgeous purple hue!  (Someone also commented the sugar didn't dissolve so I mixed it with the grape juice before adding everything else--dissolved beautifully.)  Our family is ice cream crazy and I'm the designated maker.  I enjoy trying new recipes (Six 3's from this site is also excellent)  and this one is definitely a keeper.  We had this for our Father's Day get-together with rave reviews. Dad even suggested I quit experimenting (especially  after a fresh mint/ chocolate chip disaster from another website the previous weekend!) & just stick with this one because it was the best!   I'm looking forward to trying other fruit juices as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks Tina for sharing a scrumptious refreshing treat!

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I've substituted multiple other juices for the grape juice and it's turned out quite well.  My favorite?  Pomegranate.  I just tried acai and it worked nicely, too.

I made a gallon of this at a huge ice cream social, and it was the only one with none left over.

This is one that I had a hard time review as the kids liked it but the adults found it strange tasting.  One the plus side, it was smooth and creamy with a great grape flavor.  The downside was the aftertaste of the condensed milk.  Not bad tasting, just weird.

Ummm...this is so very delicious.  I made it last year quite a bit - afraid I would burn everyone out on it - Not so!  It's a favorite!

This is so good. I could've eaten it all myself. Everybody loved it. I will make this again. I used a donvier 1 qt ice cream maker so I had to cut the recipe and didnt need to use any milk as it was full enough.

Every Sunday, our daughter & her family have dinner with us. We have a grandson that is 10 years old & a granddaughter who is 8 years old. Today, I made this wonderful sherbet for dessert & they both  loved it. My ice cream machine makes 1 to 1 1/2 qts. so I had to change the measurements. I used 1/4 can (14 oz.) sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 c. heavy cream, 3/4 c. white sugar ( my husband said I could have used a little less), 1 c. grape juice (I used Welch's Concord Grapejuice), 3/4 of the juice of 1 lemon (my lemon yielded 3 tbls. so I used 2 1/4 tbls.) and enough milk to fill to fill line. Everyone really enjoyed it. Thank you for this very refreshing dessert.

A little too sweet.  Maybe omit a portion of the sugar.  I think it would have been a great recipe.

This was spectacular! I'm not a huge ice cream fan, I make it because my family loves home made ice cream. They sure had a treat with this one!! Even I loved it. It was very tastey and creamy. I used only 2 cups of sugar, because the sweetened condensed milk is sweet enough. It took a long time in the machine, but that was because I didn't chill my ingredients first. Also, important note, this makes a gallon! I only have a countertop machine, so made the whole batch, filled my machine, then gave the rest to my friend to put in her gallon machine. BTW, her kids LOVED it, too!!! Thanks for a great recipe that's easy to make on a hot summer day.

My mom made this as her first recipe trying out her new ice cream maker. I am sorry to say, she and everyone who has tasted it was very disapointed. Even though she mixed everything well b4 pouring into the machine, while turning, the mixture separated, and left a thick white layer that stuck on the bottom of the bowl. It was sooo hard to scrape off and took such a loong time to set up! I dunno if it's the machine's fault or the recipe, but my mom was extremely disapointed. The machine, and cuisinart, is supposed to be one of the best :( . It tasted qite sour and strange. Some thought it tasted too sweet and too sour at the same time! I feel bad about the ingredients wasted. So sorry, it may have been something she did wrong, I don't know, but will she not make this again :(

My ice cream maker only hold two quarts, so I wasn't able to add any milk and had to remove some of the grape mixture.  Obviously, I didn't pay attention to how big of an ice cream freezer to use (oops).  It still turned out delicious!  It had to freeze for several hours to completely set up.  NEXT time I will either cut the ingredients in half or only pour half into the ice cream maker and save the other.  Yum yum!

I cut this recipe in half and it fit just barely in my cuisinart ice cream maker.  It was so creamy and delicious, like no other sherbet I have ever had.  My husband is not a big grape fan, but he LOVED it.  I made this for my son's third birthday party to go with a lemon cake and it was perfect.
