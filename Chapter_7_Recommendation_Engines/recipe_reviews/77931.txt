This soup was fantastic. I'm not sure how much my squash weighed, but I think it was less than what this recipe called for. I halved, seeded, and placed my squash half side down in a pan with nonstick spray, and baked on 375 for about 40-45 minutes. This is so much easier than peeling and cutting it raw. The consistancy will be mushier and moist, so when its in the pan it will not brown. I also slow cooked this recipe because I fell in love with the smell! When it came to adding the broth, I HIGHLY recommend that you slowly add this ingredient because depending on the size of your squash, this much broth may be the reason some of your soups came out watery. I would add it until its like a chunky applesauce. Then, while blending, add some cream and pulse your blender until it resembles traditional applesauce. I then put the soup back into the pan on a low simmer and chopped up apples, paper thin, and added them. I simmered this, allowing the apples to soften and absorb the flavor. If you are going to add apples, I advise you to add them after you puree, the apple pieces really finish off this dish. Again, fantastic!

Delish!  Since roasting the squash (cut side down, 400 degrees, 45 mins) helps keep in the nutrients, i roasted the squash, then followed the recipe exactly.  It was incredible.

I have made this soup twice now and it is wonderful!  I dropped a star not because of the soup itself, but simply because the descriptions of the steps in the recipe seemed to me misleading and thus confusing.  What I mean is that descriptions of what the vegetables should look like at different steps in the process, i.e. "golden brown," "spotty caramel color," never happened when I made it, no matter how long I let it cook at that stage.  So after waiting long enough for these color changes I would simply move on, and the soup still turned out great.

This might have been the best thing that I have ever made. It was our first course at our Thanksgiving meal and it got absolute raves from everyone (including my 5 year old!) I mostly followed the recipe except I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 1/2tsp (although the full amount probably would have been fine, I worried that it was too much). I was very lucky that I had all the veggies from our local organic CSA and I used my own chicken stock. I also added leeks because I had them, as well as a sprig of fresh thyme. I used a quart of chicken stock and about 2 lbs of butternut squash. It made a good consistency soup that needed almost no half and half at all (I probably used about 1/2 cup). The cayenne gave this a wonderful kick. I garnished with fresh thyme instead of apple chips. My family said that it was "restaurant quality" soup. It is a great recipe that I am sure will become a T-day tradition in our house.

I had a similar soup at the Princeville resort in Kauai and decided I was going to figure out how to make it.  I followed the directions except used heavy cream in place of the half-and-half (may as well go all out), added about 1 tsp of curry, and added blue cheese on top as a garnish. WOW!!!  We gave it 10 stars!!!!

This is possibly the best soup I've ever eaten!  I added a diced pear when I added the garlic and spices which gave it more texture and made it a bit sweeter.  Very yummy!!!

This was fantastic! I made it with a few variations though. I substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for the regular, and added four tablespoons of butter instead of one to make it richer. Louisiana Cajun spice (just a 1/2 tblsp) and a dash of nutmeg made it delish!!!

Delicious! Served this to a dinner party over the weekend and got rave reviews. Instead of apple chips, I topped with sour cream. I forgot to purchase the apple chips at the store otherwise I would have added them. Great presentation.  You should have heard the "ooohhhhs" and "aaaahhhhhs." Simple to prepare, cannot wait to make again.

Absolutely lovely. I left out the cloves (didn't have any), and cooked it a little longer than recommended (got sidetracked). This turned out to be a good thing, because when I got back to it, it could be blended with a potato masher- way less mess than a blender. It was a hit with my husband and the friends we were sharing with- everyone wanted the recipe. I'll definately make again.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Would probably give this 3.5 stars.  I think I would have just appreciated a sweeter end result, as echoed by my husband.  I think I am going to heat up the leftovers and add some brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit.  Was a lot of fun to make though, very easy directions to follow, and the kitchen smelled like a perfect autumn fragrance.

Lovely warm taste.  Made my entire house smell wonderful.  Taste to die for - not too thick, but still hearty.  Highly recommended.

This soup was fantastic!! Went to a friend's house for Thanksgiving and had to make enough to serve 16. My friend is a chef and has a degree in culinary arts. Her and her husband said it was the best Butternut Squash soup they ever had. Took some advice from others and baked the squash beforehand.  Also, steamed two apples and two carrots to purée with the squash. You have to adjust the measurements according to your taste. The soup should stick to a coated spoon.  Thanks so much!

This was delicious, even though I cheated a little. I used butternut squash that I had roasted and frozen a few days ago. Also, I roasted the onions and garlic (2 whole cloves) in olive oil, salt, and pepper on 375 for about 30 minutes. Then, I discarded the garlic cloves, melted the  butter in the pan, and added the defrosted squash and roasted onions to the pan...Mmmmm, mmmmm. 

I used ground cloves and didn't find it too overpowering. Also, I only used about 1/8 cup or so of heavy cream (all I had left in the container) and I don't think it needed much more than this, anyway. I also tossed in a little extra sugar, brown and white, because I think it brings out the flavor of the butternut squash so, so well.

Thanks for sharing this one!

This soup is amazing, I am 13 and i decided to cook for the holidays since i love to cook, my parents loved it so much they are adding it to our annual thanksgiving meal menu. I would not suggest adding milk, it's a little watered down im sure, i did not add milk... and it looks appetizing too! it was simple, it's healthy, spicy!! and very delicious, i would suggest this soup for anyone with a craving for holiday food or just wants to make something simple, inexpensive and VERY luxurious. Thank you for the recipe!!!!!

Delicious! Baked the squash first as other reviewers suggested. Also left out the half-and-half to make it healthier; the soup was plenty creamy without. Next time I'll skip the cayenne pepper.

This soup was amazing!!  I had some doubts at first, but I let it sit overnight and added some brown sugar because it was too spicy.  Everyone raved about it.  The apple chips are a must on top.  Thanks for teh recipe!!

Simple and delicious.  Perfect lunch to come back to after a walk on a crisp fall weekend.  I was brave a used as much spice as was suggested and it wasn't overpowering, even for the kids, but I might tone things down next time.  The only change was to use water instead of stock, it still tastes great.

Loved this.  Did this differently than listed and it was great:  Roasted the squash at 400 degrees for 45 minutes before beginning with the recipe instructions.  I did almost 2 lbs of squash but kept the spice quantities the same.  Instead of pinch of white sugar, I did pinch of brown sugar.  Didn't have half and half or whole mile, so I did 2 cups of 2% and then diluted 2 tbls of corn starch in about 1/2 cup of water to thicken the pureed squash mixture.

I thought this was a wonderful soup.  After reading the reviews I added less cinnamon initially, but then as I tasted it, I put in the full amount of spices requested in the recipe.  The only change I made is I started the squash in the oven because I was baking rolls and it worked out fine.  The thinly sliced apple is a great addition.

This is by far my favorite squash soup. I find the warmth of the ginger and cayenne very comforting. Using half-and-half (or whole milk) seems to bury the beautiful flavors. I prefer to use 1% milk instead.

Out of this world! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!  I substituted the cayenne with black pepper but otherwise with this recipe, you can stick to the actual recipe and not do a lot of altering. The kids even like this. FANTASTIC! Thank you!!!

I baked the squash in the oven and then used 3 cups of cooked, mashed squash.  I thought the consistency was quite nice using all other liquids in the proportions listed.  I used evaporated milk instead of half-and-half.  I followed the cooking times listed in the directions and not the color cues because I used the pre-cooked mashed squash.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it turned out much as I would expect from the description.  No surprises are the halmark of a quality recipe.  I don't think I will make this again however because it is a very sweet soup and I prefer something more savory.  I doubled the cayenne and still found that it did not have much kick.

PHENOMINAL!!!!  This has a perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  I roasted the squash and onions before adding to the broth for a deeper flavor.  Blending it in the blender gives it a wonderful, velvety consistency.  I used 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of a whole apple, and evaporated skim milk instead of regular.  Low fat, low sugar AND low calorie!  It was fantastic.  This is a new fall/winter staple for me!

Pretty good soup.  The cinnamon is not overpowering.  Added fresh apples instead of dried for garnish and added a granny smith apple in the soup.  Also, took others' advice and roasted squash (just under 4 pounds)--it was very easy and delicious.  I also used fresh ginger.  Will make again.

I've made a lot of soups in the past but this one is definitely one of the best.  I followed it pretty much to the letter except I used 2% evaporated milk in place of the 1/2 and 1/2.  Its also very important to use high quality chicken broth.

This was my first attempt at making Butternut Squash soup and my husband and I loved this recipe.  It was the right amount of taste and thickness, it hit the spot.  It tastes great with a little sour cream adding before serving.

I was really hoping to love this soup.  But we both didn't really care for it.  I roasted my squash instead of sauteing it and pretty much went by the rest of the recipe.  Even though my first few bites of this was very pleasant, I think I would rather have a small little appetizer size bowl of it before your main meal.  We had it with our meal and I think that may be why we didn't care for it.  But as an appetizer, I think it would be perfect.  Thanks for letting us try this recipe!

Excellent!  Not too much cinnamon at all. Upped the cayenne to 1/4 and added a 1/4 cajun seasoning and a sprinkle of turmeric.  The ginger hits the back of your throat and the cayenne and cajun the tongue.  Everyone liked it and I like hot, but just on the verge of a sweat.

I love this.  My husband thinks it has too much cinnamon.  It does sort of taste like a savory pumpkin pie soup.  Pretty yummy.

Wonderful!  Made it for a first course for Christmas Eve dinner last year and everyone loved it.  Tasted even better the day after, and the day after that, when I reheated it on the stove.

I loved the flavor but it seemed to me like it was missing something.  And I can't quite put my finger on it.  The directions were a little confusing/misleading when referring to the color of the squash while cooking.
Over all, a good recipe.

This soup was amazing and not too hard to make.  It tasted even better a few days later.  The touch of cayenne pepper was just the perfect amount to really make the soup warming without making it spicy.  I only used 1 cup of half-and-half to keep the soup nice and thick.  Terrific recipe!

A bit too much cinnamon for my taste, but aside from that, it was great.  Next time I will use half the cinnamon and add some tarragon.  The cayenne added a nice kick.

Flavorful fall weather treat.  Will make it again without the cayenne pepper.  Rich creamy texture.  Tasted fine with vanilla soy milk; probably could do without the pinch of sugar.

Easy and delicious soup.  The most difficult is blending the soup to a smooth consistency.  I was able to use my food processor (keeping it below the liquid fill line) to do it in 2 batches.    Make this vegan by using vegetable broth and not adding the cream.  Instead, add less broth to create the thicker consistency.    I chose to garnish with some nutmeg--really brought out the squash!

I make a lot of recipes from this site and I was really excited about making this one because I was craving squash soup super bad.  Compared to other soups I have had this soup was not good at all.  It had a strong onion taste.  When my mother came over to watch my daughter she tried it and didn't like it.  She couldn't even believe that I made this.  She told me she has never tried anything bad that I have made.  This was not the type of squash soup I was looking for.

This is good - but a little more spiced than I would normally like. I had to make a few modifications (added some potato to make up for the squash - I only had half of a large butternut) and found that the flavour was still a bit much. I love the concept though, so I'll definitely give this another go exactly true to the recipe!

Wow! This was absolutely devine.  I had this strange craving for butternut squash soup and initially couldn't decide which recipe on here to try.  I chose this one because I like cinnamon and I happened to have apple chips already on hand for the garnish.   I followed the instructions exactly as written except I roasted the squash for 45 minutes as some of the other reviewers had done.   I was happy that it made so much soup and thought I could reheat this for the next few days until my husband came home and ate 6 of the 8 servings.  The next day for breakfast, he consumed the last remaning serving!  Be sure to add the apple chips as garnish because it was excellent with the soup.

Very good and full of flavor. I added a stalk of celery and used sweet potato. I also divided the squash, seasoned with butter and brown sugar and baked it for an hour. I was much easier to cube and blend. I used 2 cans of broth and added light cream to my liking to make it creamy. So, so yummy!!!

I read 5 or 6 recipes before using this one. The only thing I did different was use 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 3 so it won't be so watery. I did not put apples and it still came out fabolous!!

Absolutely fantastic recipe!  I made it vegetarian, so used 2 cubes of vegetable "chicken" bouillon dissolved in 3 cups of water instead of the chicken stock.  I had fresh ginger on hand, and substituted allspice for the cloves.  

The cayenne gives a subtle kick to the recipe, and the spices complement each other perfectly.  I'll definitely be making this again!

FABULOUS! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. Very smooth, creamy, and a superb blend of spices. I made this for my husband and me, and I wish that I had doubled the recipe for our dinner-we both wanted more. This would make an excellent Thanksgiving or Christmas soup, but it is so good that I don't think that I could limit eating it to only the holidays!

Yummy. Instead of the pepper I added nutmeg, and I used milk instead of cream or half and half. Only used about 1/2 cup of milk. Was sweet and delicious and even my five year old enjoyed it.

Love this soup!!
Trying to eat healthy, so I didn't use any cream, milk or sweetener of any sort and it still tasted great. I also added an acorn squash and steamed both before sauteeing.  I used less than a quart of broth. If you feel it needs sweetening, I would add real maple syrup.

I didn't care for this soup.  I think maybe it was too heavy on the cloves.  It was pretty runny, even though I followed other reviewers' advice by only adding a touch of milk.  I probably would not make this one again.

This was a fantastic recipe!  It was easy for a novice soup maker like myself, and turned out fabulously, even though I omitted the cayenne pepper.  A nice touch I found was to garnish it with a bit of cilantro, not only did it look great beside the bit of sour cream floating on top, but for those who aren’t afraid to eat the garnish the flavors worked really well together.  The only draw back to this was that sadly it didn’t reheat well.
I will definitely be making this one again.

This isn't just making soup.. this is a culinary experience! The smell of the vegetables while they saute is wonderful. The golden  beautiful color of the vegetables is amazing and then the fragrant spices fill your kitchen. This soup is amazing. It has the most wonderful taste. Best butternut soup I have made or tasted! I loved the warmth of the cayenne pepper also; I might use a tiny bit less next time though, but don't leave it out! Wonderful for a chilly fall night or cold winter day.

Very good! I used 2 packages of trimmed, diced squash, which weighed more than the recipe called for, so I upped everything else as well. I also added a bit of marjoram...about a half teaspoon. Good recipe. Dinner tonight with ham sammies!

I will make this one my fave butternut squash soup. It's just what I was looking for.  Not too sweet, yet with the autumn spices that really make it cozy! I did not change anything other than leaving out the cayenne.

Great recipe but 3 cups broth was too much. The 2nd time I made it I subbed 1 1/2 cup broth and a can of light coconut milk.  My guests loved it!

Just made this fabulous soup!!  For the most part I followed all the instructions except I only had fat-free Half and Half on hand.  I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of honey at the very end which just smoothed out all the flavors.  The cayenne really gave it a kick!  YUM!!

Warning: this is spicy!! It is a godsend of a recipe for me however, because I just got braces and need exactly these types of soup recipes.  I used my vitamix blender which is made for this type of recipe.  I reduced the cayenne and onion a bit, and replaced the cream with silken soft tofu to make it vegan. I will definitely make it again!

This was a really easy recipe. I followed the suggestions and roasted the squash first, for 45 minutes at 375. The first time I made a squash soup it took me forever to peel it. This way I didn't have to do that. In order to use up somethings I had in the house I also roasted some regular and sweet potatos. I cooked the onions, and then dumped in the roasted squash and potatos. This changes the texture a bit, but is a good way to cheaply strech the recipe. I added a little more in the way of spices (probably about 1 1/2 times the reccommended amounts) and used nutmeg in place of cloves because that is what I had. I also added some pumpkin pie spice to taste. The last change that I made was using vanilla yogurt in place of the half and half. The end product is a slightly tangy, slightly spicy, slightly sweet soup. Kind of like pie. Really good. :)

This is a good recipe if you like spicy soup. However, it was too spicy for my 2 yo to even want any as a sauce for her gnocchi. My boyfriend and I both like spice and flavor but we found the cayenne to be too overpowering and not needed with the other spices.  To make it more nutritious and sweeter for my daughter I peeled and diced an apple and included it during the initial "browning" phase.  I served this with gnocchi to make it a heartier meal and added a dollop of sour cream. But again, my bf and I found ourselves adding more sour cream to tone down the cayenne.  I also discovered as I was preparing to puree the soup that our blender had stopped working so I used a hand mixer instead. CAUTION - only do this if you're preparing the soup in a deep pan!

This was a pretty good soup. I thought it odd that when I cooked the soup, it smelled different that when I tasted it. It has a really spicy aftertaste. My husband liked it too. However, I did not give it to my little one because it ended up so spicy. I would recommend this recipe!

I had a craving for some creamy butternut squash soup after my office cafeteria made some watery soup (flavorful, but watery).  My step-daughter and I found this recipe and quickly made it on Saturday morning.  We ate it all day!  The flavors are AMAZING!!  You can taste the cinnamon, the garlic, the ginger!  It tastes like the smell of fall to me and I will absolutely make this again.  I brought the remainder to work and it is a huge hit here as well.  I've already handed out the recipe a number of times.

Yummy!  Not sure how big my squash was as I only needed 2 cups of chicken broth, but used the same amount of all of the spices as listed above.  Next time will use the suggestions on adding the pears, I think that sounds great!

The essence of fall is captured in this soup. As others suggested, I roasted the squash first and used butter instead of oil. Also, I added a Bartlett pear, curry powder, nutmeg, and ground cardamom. Excellent! :-)

I made this using leftover roasted butternut squash, so I had to modify the technique a bit.  We liked the flavor, but all thought it was just too rich.  I would recommend using milk rather than half and half.  The apple slices as garnish add a nice touch.

so good! i had a TON of squash from our garden that was starting to go bad, so it was very ripe. i read the comments here, so i knew not to worry about the color changing and just followed the time directions and my nose. it's wonderful! the perfect blend of the autumn spices and just a tiny kick of spice at the end. i will DEFINITELY be making this again for holiday meals.

This soup is exceptional.  Just make sure you taste it after it's all put together.  My squash must not have been very sweet because the soup just wasn't sweet enough and all of the spices gave is a bitter aftertaste.  I added brown sugar one tablespoon at a time and by the time I'd added 3T it was perfect.  I will make this again and again!

This soup was good - not excellent...Like someone else said, I had to add some ingredients to get a better taste. I have since found a better butternut squash soup - one that is creamier- that my family likes much better. Probably won't make this one again.

It was delicious! If you're cautious with spice like I am, go easy with the cayenne pepper... the recipe suggested too much for my taste. Otherwise it is very simple and flavorful!

This soup was delicious!  I too roasted the squash (40 minutes at 375 degrees) before adding it to the saute mix.  That made it very easy to puree later on, as the squash had been scooped right out of its skin.  As for the other ingredients, I used the amounts called for in the recipe, with the exception of the chicken broth and half-and-half (used less for both). All in all, this was a wonderful departure from our normal meals.

I altered this recipe quite a bit (added an apple, a pear, and a few carrots, increased the sugar, omitted the cayenne), and it turned out fantastic! Definitely a recipe I will use again and again.

Delicious!!  Definately didn't use 1 1/2 cups of milk.  Maybe about 1/2 cup.  And, I didn't use all three cups of the broth either.  I also used someone else's suggestion and add some diced pear.  This is the PERFECT fall day soup.  As we speak I am eating it, and listening to my Christmas music!!

I guess everyone has different tastes, but my family could not even gag this one down, and we usually like healthier recipes.

I made this for christmas. I was a bit hesitant but everyone ate it up!!!!! It had a delicious cinnamon flavor. I added some sugar to sweeten it up a bit. The Cayenne gives a nice kick.

I substituted leeks and roasted the squash. I also added roasted parsnips as I had a pile of them. My guests loved the soup and I was asked for the recipe.

I tried to like this, but I really hated the texture of the puree. I thought it had a really odd flavor, and ended up throwing most of the pot away. Maybe it's just personal preference, but I didn't care for it.

I just made this soup tonight, mainly to use up the last of the butternut squash from my garden. It is delicious and  a perfect nosh for a cold, late autumn evening. Not at all difficult to make and a goes well with all that leftover turkey!

So quick and so delicious!   I've substituted the half and half with whole milk, which cuts the fat content from 3.5g fat for 2T of half&half to 8g of fat for a cup of milk.  This is the only way I have prepared this recipe, and I love it, so why add the fat, if I don't have to!!!!

I was very pleased with the outcome of this recipe!  All of the spices gave it a rich unexpected punch.  I cut the recipe in half just to test it out.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for the vegetarians in my family.  I used milk instead of half and half.  I plan to make this as the appetizer soup for Thanksgiving dinner.  I think I will use more butternut squash than is called for because I used quite a bit more even when I had cut the recipe in half.  And I'm going to watch the cayenne pepper and garlic quantities just because they might be overpowering for some of my guests.

Very delicious, slightly spicy soup.  I used more squash than the recipe called for (approximately 2.5 pounds) and it turned out great.  I would make this again.

This was fantastic! Following the reviews, I left out the cloves. I also used only 1 garlic clove, and 1/2 an onion to make the flavors milder. I used 1% milk instead of cream to make it healthier. Since I used acorn squash, I microwaved it first for about 8-10 min so I could remove the peel. We will make this again!

FANTASTIC...This soup was so tasty and creamy.  I only used 1 cup of half and half and no cayenne pepper or apple chips.  Very easy since I had all the ingredients in the house.  I cooked each step a little longer than it says. It has such a wonderful flavor and the color is so perfect for fall.  Made my Thursday night dinner seem like we were in a fancy restaurant. Will make for Thanksgiving. Hubby loved it.  Thanks alot.

We really liked the warm spices (cinnamon, ginger, clove) in this soup but the cayenne pepper overwhelmed these beautiful Fall flavors.  I served Boursin Snack crackers (from Costco) with it, which really helped to cut the heat.  The apple chips were a nice textural addition.  If I make again, I will eliminate the cayenne and sprinkle some crumbled garlic & herb boursin cheese on top with the apple chips.

The soup was so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I roasted the garlic,carrots and the butternut squash. the roasted veggies really gave this soup a rich flavor. I blended the soup smooth in my vitamix. It really tasted gourmet!! My family loved it.

Delicious!!! I didn't have some of the items, so I replaced them with other things.  I replaced the half and half with cashew milk, and the cloves with nutmeg, sugar with coconut palm sugar. I also added a gala apple in at the beginning when I put the butternut squash cubes in, as well as adding a little extra cinnamon and ginger, and a pinch of salt and pepper at the end.  I am sure that the original recipe was delicious as is, however I haven't tried it as is.  What I can say is that with the changes I had to make, it was extremely, extremely delicious, and it hit the spot.  Warm, aeromatic, autumnal, deliciousness!

I loved this recipe.  The only change I'll make the next time I make it is to leave out the half and half.  It diminishes the favors of the soup, and in my opinion, just isn't necessary.  Also, I puréed the soup very well. Next time I will leave just a bit of texture for a different feel n the palate.

I have made this twice but 3rd time was the (unintended) charm.  I was at the broth step when I realized I had none; I googled and got info that you could use 1 TBS soy sauce to 1 cup water as a sub.  I cut that back to 3/4 TBS per cup.  Also sub'ed allspice for cloves.  Used only 1/2 cup half & half. Did everything else as directed, and wow love this.  So do my dogs.  I dropped some on the floor and they were all over it.  It's not breed specific either - the lab and yorkie both begged for more!

I made this delicious soup.  I did change it a bit.  I omitted the Cloves, and Half n Half.  I added 1/2 of a peeled appled/chopped.  I, also, added 4 ounces of a brick of cream cheese which was a substitute for the half and half. Instead of using the cloves, I added 1/2 of a teaspoon of curry powder. I, also, roasted my squash which gives it a much deeper flavor.  The directions were a tad bit confusing but that didn't stop me from trying this recipe as I've made enough soups to do my own thing.   I would make this again!

Delicious, roasted squash first, and skipped out on cayenne pepper. I agree with the reviewers who say that apple slices really finish it off!

Great flavors! I used 2cups broth instead and only half cup half and half to make sure it wasn't too watery. Came out perfect.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I loved the way that it tasted. I wish I had seen the review where it told you to slowly to add the broth to make sure you don't put in too much, because my squash was a little bit small. When I made this, I also baked some crescent rolls and dipped them into the soup. It was amazing. This is something that is very versatile--I can see it being the base for other creations. Beans? Sure. Meat? Why not. I'm excited to see what I can do with this recipe.

I just made this. Taste very good. It was a success. Only thing is I added coconut milk instead of half and half or milk. I also sauteed squash and onions in blood orange olive oil. I also bought ready to cook squash from Sam's club. I have  a 13 1/2month old, so cubed was definitely best for me.

Very good!  The aroma and flavors definitely say *Christmas* to me, which made this perfect for Christmas Eve dinner.  I served it as the main course but, if I make it again, I'll serve it as an appetizer (soup shooters?) because it is so rich.

I've made this twice now and love it!  Not a fan of spicy Cajun so I followed the recipe the first time and it was a bit too spicy for my liking, so just reduced the amount the second time.
Will definitely make this again!

Soooo good!!! I made this in September and it was a perfect fall recipe. Spicy and hearty, and definitely filling enough to be an entree on its own. It fed me for days, and I never got bored of it. I should mention that, after reading other reviewers' suggestions, I roasted the squash beforehand.

This recipie was great!  I made a few minor modifications.  As previously mentioned, I cut the butternut squash in halves, scooped out the seeds and baked them on a baking sheet rather than sauteeing them.  Butternut squash is difficult to cut when uncooked, so this made cutting the squash into pieces later much easier.  I ended up adding a couple of potatoes, which complimented the butternut squash quite well.  I also added a pinch of sugar to compliment the cinnamon taste.  It was great, I will definitely be making this again soon!

This was a great soup!! I cut the squash in half and spooned out the seeds. I then brushed the meat with a little olive oil and placed in the oven at 375 for 45 min. Once it was out I spooned the meat into the onions and garlic and let them simmer together for about 5 min. I threw in half an apple peeled, cored and sliced into the squash mixture and then I eyeballed the amount of broth I put in so that it was still pretty thick before I put it in the blender. After I blended it smooth I poured about 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream into the blender and blended again. Once it was back in the pot I added a little more broth until it was the consistency I wanted and then added a little more sugar and the other half of the apple sliced. It turned out AMAZING!! The slices of apple really add something, and keep the soup from being texturally similar to baby food. the hubby loved it :)

I usually love alot of spices in my food but this one had too much cloves. I've made it twice and if we make it again it will only be as a starter, it's not filling enough for dinner. We used milk instead of half-and-half to make it healthier.

As much as I wanted to enjoy this soup because I love butternut squash, I thought it was okay.  I'm not sur e what was missing for me.  It almost felt like it needed some sort of crunch to it. But, it was worth the try!

This was my first attempt at butternut squash soup and it was absolutely delicious.  I used one 8oz package of cream cheese and one cup of milk instead of 1 1/2 cups of half and half.  It was very creamy.  Will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

Lots of ingredients but the flavour still wasn't there so I had to add things at the end to get a good taste - eg. dash of curry.  Sauteed squash with two granny smiths for sweetness.  Seemed really thick. Will try again, maybe my stock was too strong.

I was very disappointed with this soup. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I baked the squach beforehand like many reviewers suggested.  Both my husband and I did not like it.  I will say the soup has a very nice texture and consistency, however I felt it was lacking flavor. It tasted like it needed something, but I couldn't figure out what.

This was really really good, especially on a chilly Autumn night! Roasted the squash ahead of time, and only used about 1/2 of the half and half (fat free), but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Even my husband, who isn't a soup fan, LOVED it and agreed it was restaurant quality.

Followed the recipe as it was except I used onion powder (I NEVER use onions or have them in the house ewwww). This soup smells amazing! Tastes great too (my two year old ask for seconds!).  I'm definitely making this again!

Very tasty! I decided to add a Pear choped up in it since I didn't have any Apples on hand. I didn't have cloves either. Seems to be an easy recipe even for a mom with a 7 month old.

WOW!!!! This was amazing. I LOVE butternut squash...my husband does not- but he LOVED this. As did my mom.  The only change i made was instead of milk or half and half i used Silk Plain soymilk and it was wonderful.

I've used this recipe for over a year now.  I get many compliments.  I'm not a cayenne pepper fan, but it works very well with this recipe.

Soooooooooooooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly- except that I added only 1/4 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 cream.  Thanks for such a delicious treat!!  YUM!!!!!!!!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I made it almost exactly to the recipe except I cut down on the spices:  3/4 tsp. cinnamon, rounded half tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp cloves and substituted fresh ground nutmeg for the cayennne.  I didn't want it to taste like dessert and my gut feeling was right and my belly was happy! THANKS!!!

I am not a big soup fan at all. Also, I've never made soup from scratch this was my first attempt. I got a free butternut squash today and thought "what can I do with this?", came on here and found this recipe. Can I just say it came out SO GOOD! I loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except had to cook the squash in the chicken broth a little longer than 10 min. Next time I 'm going to add more cinnamon and a little less cayenne pepper. (per husband's request).

This soup was so tasty!  There were so many flavors at one time.  To quote my husband, "It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth!  It was the best soup I've ever had!"  LOL  Quite interesting!  It took a couple of spoonfulls to get into it though.  Mine didn't get thick enough, so I added corn as a bit more substance.  Not sure it helped, but it did add more flavor.  It was good the first day, but wonderful the second day after the flavors had a chance to really settle in.  Will definitely make it again.

Restaurant quality.  I don't add cayenne, salt or pepper.  I do add a little more sugar (1/2 tsp.) just to make it a tad more sweet but not too much. For a garnish, I make fresh whipped cream (no sugar) with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  YUM!  Great for a cold, fall day.

I found this recipe overly spicy in terms of "fragrant spices", but at the same time quite bland. I also didn't like the brownish colour from the spices. It was a little better once seasoned with salt & pepper, but I probably will not make it again.

I was really disappointed in this soup.  I followed the directions exactly.  My family thought the flavors together were strange and that it was a 3 star instead of a 5 star recipe.

A little time consuming but very good.  Although, my husband liked it better than I did.

This was a big hit with husband.  There are only two of us so I only used one 14 oz can of chicken broth and about a cup of half and half.  I also added about 2-3 teaspoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

This was the best butternut squash soup I have ever had! It took me forever to make (especially the peeling of the squash). I left out the ginger and I used half of a chili pepper instead of cayenne. I also threw in whole cloves.

This soup was easy and delicious.  My husband actually licked his spoon.  I might leave out the Cayenne pepper next time or only put in a dash.

Overall, fantastic!

Great.  I also added in a green apple with the squash and that worked well.

I don't think I got the full amount of squash required for this soup so mine was a little thin, but the taste was pretty good. I left out the cloves as others suggested to do, and the cinnamon and ginger made it quite sweet and flavorful enough. Not bad, but probably nothing I'd ever have a craving for.

This soup was amazing! Just the right amount of spice and thickness and taste--big hit! The only problem for me was this was my first time using butternut squash, and it was so hard to chop! I ended up using a melon scoop.
