I loved it. It has a "just right" taste. I used maple syrup instead of sugar.....same thing...yummy. I used it for chicken wings. Thanks. This time I didn't have gin & used Tequila and sugar and again...fantastic. Thanks again John it's my go-to.

I used this to marinade salmon. I let it sit overnight. After baking this fish.... Wow! Flavor was amazing! My husband said it was the best he had ever had. I wrapped the fish in aluminum foil. Baked it. Served!

This was amazing on a tenderized cheap cut of steak. Definitely using it again. I am writing this half an hour after I ate the steak and i can still taste the marinade in the back of my mouth (in a good way!).

Only giving this 4 because i haven't tried it yet, personally.   Wanted to leave a review though because a similar recipe has been in my family for years, going back to my Grandfather who got this recipe from a WWII brother.  Used it mostly on cheap cuts of meat, such as "country style" boneless pork ribs.   Excited to try this variation!

1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1 tsb white sugar
1/3 cup gin
2/3 cup soy sauce.
