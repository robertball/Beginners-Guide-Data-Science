These were super!  In the interest of health I did not use melted butter, but used Olive Oil instead...the coating adhered to the oil and they baked very quickly, with a great flavor.  thanks

Okay, so I modified the recipe, but they were still delicious! I used my own breadcrumbs, added some onion powder and italian seasoning to the dry mix, and instead of egg, I used 1 T.avocado oil and 1 T apple cider vinegar to dip the zucchini in. It took about 30 minutes for them to cook- I cooked them about 10 min. on broil after the original time so they would be crispy. My daughter LOVED them! I will be making these again- they were so much more enjoyable than frying them!

This is absolutely fantastic!  I love the deep-fried zucchini you get at some restaurants, but some places make it too greasy.  This is so much better.  I used panko bread crumbs, and to dip I made garlic aioli from another recipe on this site.  No trouble eating up the zucchini neighbors leave on my porch!  ;-)

I just love these!  They're really good and just about the only way I can get my husband to eat zucchini.  I've made them several times, but this last time I used panko bread crumbs and seasoned them myself.  I also used olive oil.  Delicious!  I dip them in ketchup but my husband likes them in honey mustard.  I bet some ranch dressing would be tasty for a dip, too!  Great way to eat up all the zucchini my mom is giving me from her garden.  And since they're healthier than your normal fries, I'm calling them Bikini Zucchini Fries!

Nice alternative to traditional fries.  I used egg white instead of butter to dip the zucchini into before adding the crumb coating.  This worked very well for me, and the coating stuck really well. This also cut down on the fat and calories to make this a reasonably healthy side dish. I also chose not to peel my zucchini.   My kids preferred theirs dipped in ranch, but my husband and I enjoyed these as is.

An excellent recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer and coated them in egg white instead of butter. I cooked them 5 minutes each side at 450, then broiled 2 minutes each side. They came our crispy and delicious!

This recipe is a fun way to use zucchini. However, the breading on was a little overpowering. If I try this again I will REALLY shake off the excess coating (had I coated the fries less I would have rated this recipe higher). I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used regular and added italian seasoning. I used 3 zucchini's so tripled the recipe to have enough mixture. I would recommend adding the breading mixture to pie plate as needed. the butter/marg makes it clumpy so the final fries are hard to coat.  I also made the Garlic Ailoli and added roasted red pepper for dipping.

I adore fried zucchini but don't want the fat from a deep fryer so oven baked is the way to go.  I might add that I have fried the zucchini in the past and now that I've tried oven baked I prefer it this way.  

I did modify the recipe slightly.  I like the spear shape better, so I cut 2 zucchini in half to make shorter spears (left seeds in since they were not big), then each half was divided into 8 spears.  I used 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and 2/3 cup Panko crumbs (instead of bread crumbs) and I added garlic salt and lemon pepper to taste (didn't measure, just added then tasted to see if I added enough - start with less then you think you need, add more if wanted).  I scrambled 2 eggs to dip the zucchini into instead of butter before coating them with my crumbs, but used a little butter to grease my foil since I didn't have any cooking spray. I baked mine for 25 mins (I like them crispy!) @ 425 in a convection toaster oven (didn't even bother turning them) and they came out perfect. I had to bake them in 2 batches because my oven is small. But still this was easier on me than deep frying because you don't have to stand over the stove monitoring the frying process and I was able to get more spears into my oven than I could have fit in a frying pan.  Will be doing this again SOON.

Yum! I used 2 garden fresh zucchini, and left the skin on. I made my own bread crumbs with some stale whole wheat bread & used my homemade italian seasoning. Didn't use that much butter & threw in some of my low sodium cajun seasoning. My husband thought they needed to cook a bit longer, but I thought they were good. Thanks!

I did a few things differently.  It was faster for me to just slice the zucchini (unpeeled).  I also used 2 Tbsp. of milk and 1 egg white mixed together, instead of the butter.  Near the end of the cooking time, I set the oven to broil to crisp them up.  I also, flipped them once half way through baking.  Very good!

These were pretty good and fairly easy. I think calling them fries is a little misleading though. Mine were still mushy and barely crispy at all.

I thought these tasted okay and I liked the fact that they cooked in the time specified. I used whipped butter to cut the saturated fat and calories and seasoned my own plain bread crumbs to make Italian bread crumbs. My zucchini I thought was a little small so I used 2 and still had nearly half the bread crumb mixture, as I suspected. I wouldn't really call these fries other than the wedge type shape, but they are similar to other similar recipes on here for baked zucchini chips. Although, I did prefer this thicker cut style more and that the bread crumbs were lighter because the zucchini was not dipped in eggs.

Tasty and easy to make. I used olive oil and plain bread crumbs with Italian seasoning and oregano. We dipped them in ketchup and honey.

Yum!!! With an over abundance of zucchini in my garden, I have been cooking up loads of zucchini in a million different ways.  My husband said this was his favorite recipe! I served them with a ranch dipping sauce.

Oven Baked Zucchini Fries Haiku: "These were just okay. (Spicy Ranch Dressing dip helped.) Bit too soggy." I made as directed, (except I didn't see any reason to peel the zucchini), but found that 15 min. in the oven wasn't long enough for them to brown up, so I flipped 'em, and kicked it to broil. I adore zucchini in all its prepared forms and flavor additions, but these were a bit wiggly for me. I did; however, make AR's "Spicy Spicy Ranch Dressing" for dipping, and that was nummy.

I love this recipe! It tastes so good and it's so easy to make. I highly suggest using egg whites instead of butter, and flipping them half way through cooking. I followed the directions exactly the first time I made them, and they were kinda falling apart. But then I used the egg whites and flipped them, and they're perfect!

Very good! I'm not sure what the difference between frying something and baking it dredged in butter, but whatever... It was delicious. I doubled the recipe and found that the melted butter wasn't quite enough to coat all of the fries. I added a few tablespoons of olive oil and that seemed to work out well. Also, Based on another review, I broiled on high for about 7 minutes after baking to make them crispier. It worked out well and my picky, vegetable hating kids gobbled them up!

Really good.  We have never slurped down Zucchini so quickly.  I had to fry it because the oven was busy and I changed it to saffron oil for a higher smoke point.  Next time, if I were going to fry it, I would put on a egg coating, flour coating, egg coating and then crumbs and cheese coating so that more of the coating would stick to the zucchini.  But since this was a baked recipe I would hardly hold that against this.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it didn't have an epic enough "wow" factor.  Peoples complements were all "for zucchini, this is great.." and I thought a five star shouldn't have the "for zucchini" qualifier.

The taste was ok. It was edible. But, the texture really threw me off. Nothing like fries. They were too soft and floppy. I was hoping for something crispy. Plus, the breading made a weird crust. Felt like sand on a worm.

These were pretty good - don't overcook or they will be a bit mushy on the inside.  Good flavor.

These were  a hit with my picky 7 yr old. I just sold them as "veggie sticks".  I added some ground flax seed to the mix too for some extra fiber and used olive oil as another person had suggested in lieu of butter.

I used flour, egg, breadcrumb method.  Everything stuck very well and the Progresso Italian Seasoned Panko bread crumbs browned and crisped up very nicely.  I made some skinny and some fatter fries, I think I enjoyed the "steak-cut" variety more.

OMG these are AMAZING I followed the advise to have them with the garlic aoili recipe thats on here! Totally goes with them! I used two zuccinis and there was a good amount, but if you want to do it that way I would recommend doubleing the rest! Also I deep fried instead so used egg instead of oil to hold the bread crumbs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

These do not get crisp, so if you are expecting a crunchy exterior you will be dissapointed.  I used plain breadcrumbs and seasoned with what my family likes.  Will make again is nice side with pasta.

Yum. For the first time ever, I used the salt, drain, rinse, and dry method to prep the zucchini to extract excess moisture. It made a Huge difference. I cut the (smallish) zucchini in half and then each half into 8 spears. I used half egg white, half olive oil to coat; then half parm, half panko with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. The spears were small enough to stand them up on the skin side (I always leave the skin on, that's where the good stuff is!) and I didn't have to turn them during cooking, and they only took about fifteen minutes to cook to perfection - ten minutes at 425, and five under the broiler. So delicious. Thank you!

Very tasty, but next time I will let the zucchini drain a bit longer. I wanted the fries a little crispier.

Like alot of recipes on this site, the picture doesn't match the recipe.  The recipe states to peel the zucchini and the picture shows that the zucchini is not peeled.  So the question is again, which one is correct.  This happens alot.

This was easy and delicious and I will do it again!  I did tweak it a bit - I used olive oil instead of butter and I didn't peel the zucchini.

This was easy, tasty, and a different way for me to prepare zuchinni. It was our "starch" substitute so I didn't mind the coating.  I did use crushed panko with olive oil and dried herbs, thought I will try bread crumbs next time to see how that works.

The recipe needs a better binder - not much of the crumbs stuck.  I will try it again will egg whites.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.

Excellent recipe, much healthier than frying.  I did use olive oil instead of the margarine.  Also I think the next time I make this I will put them on a rack so they can get a little crunchier,

Just tried this recipe and am very disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly and they were mushy inside.  I have zucchini at least 3 times a week (usually zucchini pancakes, grilled or sautéed with or without sauce) and definitely will not be making this ever again!

Made recipe exactly as written.  I loved them.  Quick & easy to prepare. Crisp & full of flavor.  My 12 yr old wasn't crazy about the buttery taste but ate a  few.  I would make them again, may consider substituting half with oil or egg white instead of butter & see how that goes over.

It was good - not a lot of flavor.  Will experiment with the breading next time and bake for longer to get them crispy.

These fries are really good. I think the butter helped with the slight crispiness and baking of the zucchini. I did make the zucchini chips from this site with an egg, they did not brown as well as these.I did turn them once 1/2 way through baking.

This is fantastic!!  I used the great big zucchinis that you don't know what to do with and just cut it in two.  We liked it so much that we had it 2 nights in a row. Easy, quick and delicious!!

Add pepper and garlic powder and dredge in flour and then egg. Also make sure the zucchini is patted dry to help bread crumbs to stick. Baked at 375 for 15 mins per side.

Awesome! But I would recommend baking a little longer if you like crunchy fries. They get a little soggy in the middle.

These zucchini fries were labor intensive for the results. The coating was rather bland-- my dining companion and I had to add more seasoned salt as we went. The zucchini became a little slimy; the texture was unappealing.

Variations I've tried: 1. Egg dip instead of butter to make it more healthy or milk. 2. Crushed pork rinds instead of bread crumbs for a low carb option.

It was decent, could have been better. Instead of butter maybe egg whites instead. Try reducing the breadcrumbs or knocking more of the breadcrumbs off and possibly increase the cook time by about 5-10 minutes possibly (I tried 5 extra minutes and they still weren't quite right), I liked it but my parents weren't a fan. It actually works SOMEWHAT well with making oven fried pickles.

They were really great!!  Easy to make and delish!  I found that there was enough butter and breading for  2 medium - large Zucchinis.  I will definitely make again!

Tasty!  I was looking for a new way to cook zucchini.  End product was kinda mushy on inside, probably i cut the pieces too small.  But loved the crunch and flavor.  I used seasoned Panko as my breadcrumbs.

It was really good, although did not live up to its description. We made some slight adjustments in an attempt to make everything crispy, but it was STILL not crispy, although it was delicious with the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese they had in the recipe.

These were a huge hit with my entire family.  A few tips if you like them super crispy.  First, cut the zucchini the shape of thin french fries.  Spread zucchini pieces out on a paper towel.  Sprinkle with salt and let sit for a while.  Then, take another paper towel and blot off all the water.  Repeat this step if you have time.

After you've removed as much water as possible, dredge the zucchini pieces in flour, egg, and bread crumbs mixture.

Next, spray a perforated sheet pan or other metal pan that has holes in it with cooking spray.  Then, arrange the dredged zucchini in a single layer. Spray a little cooking spray on top of the zucchini.  Cook until they begin to brown.  Then broil for a few minutes at the end.  So crispy and delicious!

I really liked this dish. Even my husband, who is not a veggie eater, said they were good. I didn't use the butter or bread crumbs. I used a little olive oil and the shredded Parmesan cheese. Kept the carb count down. Will definitely fix them again.

Way too much Parmesan for my taste.  If I make these again, I shall cut that and add some black pepper, parsley, and garlic.  The measurements for the crumb mixture and the butter could probably be cut in half, too.  I threw away a lot of coating.  The fries did crisp up nicely though :-)

We had fried zucchini fries in Italy last week and they were delicious. But I never make fried foods so this recipe has been tempting me. I made these tonight with chicken Parmesan and they were delicious! Very different from the fried variety....I used 2 large zucchini and made the recipe as written.  We could have eaten one more zucchini and I will definitely make more next time and will use less breading on each piece to make them healthier as they will be just as tasty. A definite keeper recipe!

I just really needed the recipe as I needed to know the oven temp and the time... I skipped the breadcrumbs, used olive oil, garlic and onion powder and Mrs. Dash, and Parmesan cheese in a gallon bag.  Put the zucchini in the bag and seasoned them up. A healthier way to eat without the trans fatty acids, and carbs which I'm avoiding to fit in a dress for next weekend!

I made these several times a few summers ago and we enjoyed them. Tonight I thought I would try cornflake crumbs - maybe the secret to ultimate crispiness?! Nope. And while I love corn flavor (cornmeal, cornbread, etc.) it did not work with zucchini. I'll stick to the breadcrumbs. Remember, if you want to broil them for a few minutes at the end, do not use parchment paper. I docked a star because they are kind of time consuming - the dipping and breading. Otherwise I would make them all the time!

We really liked this but I made a couple of changes.  Biggest change is coating everything using ziplock storage bags.  Easy and disposable.    I coated the zucchini with seasoned flour.  The moved it to another ziplock and poured it in the butter.  Then I used a spider to move it to seasoned breadcrumb.  I seasoned the breadcrumb with garlic powder, salt, pepper, penzey's  Tuscan sunset.   This would also work well with eggplant

These were great. Instead of dipping in butter/margarine, I dipped in 2 beaten eggs mixed with a 1/2 T. of olive oil. I also baked them at 425 degrees for about 20-25 mins. Served with a garlic aioli recipe I found on here. Delish!!

I started with a zucchini the size of my arm. I had marinated pieces let over from the Balsamic zucchini we BBQd last night, so no egg or butter. It is fantastic. Now I wont dread zucchini season ever again.

I wanted to make it & I gave it 5 *****but I really dislike making a recipe unless I can see the nutritional  values first.  If not too high in fat, sodium etc. I will then make it.  Is it possible to list this at the bottom of each recipe?

I made one pan with butter and the other pan with egg whites. Both were yummy.

Tried this recipe several nights in a row to work out the kinks.  Egg whites are a joke!  Butter was better.  The best thing I did was to coat the strips in melted butter, lay them out on the cookie sheet and sprinkle the bread crumb/cheese mixture on top.  It sort of "fused" together but it tasted awesome.  We actually enoyed pulling it apart as an appetizer between us. I suppose if you sprinkled more carefuly they would be fries.  I will do it again with my modifications. :P Yum

Awesome! Easy to make! And also great recipe to have kids help making. Kids loved dipping in butter and then crumbs. Served with ranch dipping sauce. Definitely going in recipe book!

These were a great way to get my 2 year old to eat vegetables. The only thing I would recommend is serve with marinara sauce.

Like several others I made some changes. I used egg beaters instead of butter and used my own homemade bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning, seasoned salt and pepper which gave them a bit of heat. They were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Made a dill dip and my husband said this should be a regular item on our meal planning.
They were really good.
Thank you for the recipe.

I made it to the specifications on the the recipe. Unfortunately for me the bread crumbs were not the best choice and the seasoned salt + the parmesan made it really salty. I will try using Panko next time or different bread crumbs with perhaps less/no salt. Can't wait to try it again.

These weren't too bland at all. I used egg like most others commented about. Eat them all because the leftovers aren't as tasty.

I liked the overall idea, however mine were really soft and soggy - the zucchini was not the freshest, so may be that had something to do with it. I'll try again with fresher veggies.

Great!!! I too modified. Use oat-bran instead of bread crumbs (gluten free). Used egg beaters (egg whites). So good, thank you for recipe.

Completely unimpressed.  The flavor was okay.  The zucchini was soggy, even though I followed the directions exactly and baked until the crumb coating itself was crispy.  I'll find another way to cook zucchini.
