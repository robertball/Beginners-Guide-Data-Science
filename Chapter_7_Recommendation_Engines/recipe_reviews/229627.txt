I made these again last night but this time I used the frozen french beans from Trader Joes. I steamed the beans instead of boiling them, I also doubled the mushrooms and also the slivered almonds. browned the mushrooms and almonds in the butter and then added the steamed beans with a couple of shakes of garlic powder, everyone loved it cooked this way, I will be making this many more times.

While this is not a recipe that is particularly inspired, it does not diminish the fact that it is delicious with great eye appeal.  I didnâ€™t bother with the sliced almonds and cooking them with the mushrooms.  Picking out a few almonds from my dish of mixed salted nuts and chopping them up worked just fine!

This was my lunch today. I threw in one clove minced garlic and I also used baby bella mushrooms, other than that I kept to the recipe. I'm not ashamed to say.......I ate the whole thing. This was delicious!

This recipe was an easy way to get veggies on the table - I would add some minced garlic and try it with olive oil instead next time, to give it a bit more kick and make it lighter. I heart green beans!

I thought this tasted okay. It is basically a green bean amandine with mushrooms added. I have made similar recipes, but typically steam the green beans in the microwave and buy a good brand of frozen ones. This took quite some time to make! I doubled the recipe and still only got about 3 servings, so the calorie count is a little high too.

A simple, good recipe. I changed the bean cooking time to 5 minutes and sauteed the almonds separately to keep them nice & crunchy.

I increased the bean cooking time to 10 minutes, left off the almonds, and added a lot of chili powder and soy sauce. The result was perfect!

Good recipe.  I added shallots with mushrooms and almonds.  Next time I will omit shallots and add almonds before serving.  I also used lemon pepper to season.  I will make again.

This is a great recipe! The only change I made was adding fresh garlic instead of garlic salt! I also cooked the green beans just a little bit longer!

Excellent, I substituted basil and oregano for garlic. Very nice, simple, tasty recipe!
