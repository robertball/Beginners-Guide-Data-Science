Everyone ate this but it won't become a family favorite.  The ginger was more powerful than we're used to and I would prefer a sweeter flavor to the sauce.  If I make it again I will add some brown sugar or more molasses.

Wonderful flavor--and eating the cold leftovers was every bit as good as when I made it!

This was just okay.  The pork didn't come out with much flavor.  The mollasses was a bit too strong.  I won't make again.

This was amazing.  The only thing I did differently was to grate the ginger...to get finer pieces. Very easy to prepare and very delicious.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is excellent!  My kids even ate all their food (that's a miracle).  My husband raved about how good dinner was and requested this be a "keeper" for years to come.

Our whole family felt like we were eating out at a yummy restaurant.  I didn't have the sherry so I used a little red wine vinegar.  A keeper for sure!

This was pretty good- I seared the pork chops, then finished them in the oven while I made the pan sauce.
