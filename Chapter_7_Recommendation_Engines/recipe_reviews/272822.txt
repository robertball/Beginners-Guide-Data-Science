These were really good! They were fluffy, just like an egg waffle would be. I added some dairy-free (small) chocolate chips and it added a little extra sweet to it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. I recommend!

I made these for my kids and they loved them. I did use gluten free flour instead of all purpose with no issues. My only issue came from my waffle iron. To save time I used two waffle irons, one was my husband's grandmother's, the other my own. The older waffle iron created flat, cracker like waffles but my waffle iron made perfect waffles.
