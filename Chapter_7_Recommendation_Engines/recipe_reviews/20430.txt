I can't really rate this recipe, but I just want to say that I tried it with mangoes instead of bananas and it turned out really great.

Was looking for banana, this is more citrusy, a.k.a grapefruit...was very refreshing however

I scaled the recipe down to two servings, I used lemon sorbet instead of lemon sherbet & I added a tbp. of honey...mixed it all up in the blender. Thanks Ann!
