I ignored the 1 3/4 c wheat flour. I also used sugar, bread four and potato flakes.
Here are my notes: Use 2/3c milk. Warm slightly in microwave, add butter to melt. Add 1 tsp Almond Extract or Vanilla, add egg, mix thoroughly. Should be 98° for proper yeast temperature.                                                 Slowly add as needed 1/2 c flour                   1/2c potato flakes + as needed.                            Place into greased bowl, turn over add spritz move oil, cover tight with plastic wrap in bread proofing oven until 2x size.                                    Preheat oven 350° and let it heat up for additional 15 minutes. Check every 10 minutes until golden brown, tap for hollow sound, approximately 30 min. Let cool completely.    Use white frosting, melt in microwave 20+seconds.
