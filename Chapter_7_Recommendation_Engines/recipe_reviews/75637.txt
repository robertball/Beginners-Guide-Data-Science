yep- very refreshing and crunchy and tasty!
don't skimp on the lime juice... add lots... needs a bit more salt, as well... 1 jalapeno won't do a thing with the spice factor- it needs 3 to get any kick at all.
and don't get impatient with the refrigerator time... it needs to flavor up for a while. :)

I've made this twice in the past week and it's been very positively received each time.  I just *learning* to like cukes and I don't really care for cilantro, so it's not my personal fav, but everyone else seems to love it!  I love that it's fairly easy to make and is a cool light alternative to many mayo coated calorie dense BBQ dishes!  I used 1 cuke (it was rather large) and 1/2 jalap (my jalaps were HUGE....5".....both times...I'd prefer a little more heat, but I always error on the safe side when taking for others).  I also couldn't find fresh cilantro, so I had to use dried (used 2 heaping tsps to adjust).    I also doubled the lime juice....everyone loves guessing what's in this salsa!  TY for a great easy recipe.  Oh yeah, I used red onion for both the bite and color and the second time I also added half a diced red bell pepper.

WONDERFUL!  I only used one cucumber and extra tomatoes.  The recipe as written is very mild.  Add more jalepenos to make it spicier.  This is the best salsa recipe I have tried!

This was fantastic! I didn't use parsley because I didn't have any, so I used about twice as much cilantro, I used an extra cucumber also. I added a little cracked black pepper and I didn't have a lime, so I used lemon, but I read the recipe wrong so instead of using half a teaspoon I accidentally used a whole half of the lemons juice, but it truly was one of the best salsas I have ever had! In fact I ate almost all of it the first night, so I had to go back to the store to get more cucumbers so that I could make another batch! Try this once and you will have it again and again!

We made this and took to a dinner party -- it was a huge hit.  We love cucumbers and this receipe really added to the simple cucumber salad we ate as we grew up.  We did not use it as a dip, rather it was spread over baked salmon and was delicious.

Great recipe. I used 4 jalapenos because everyone in the office loves spicy food, and I doubled the cilantro and omitted the parsley. I also used 4 tomatoes to give it more red coloring. I will certainly make this again.

FANTASTIC!  A real crowd pleaser!  Everyone raved about how different and delicious this salsa was.  It was very easy, everything was fresh from our garden. People (even men) were asking me for the recipe!  This one is a summer must!!!  Thank you soooo much for the recipe.

Fantastic! This recipe is beyond five stars in my book. Don't skip the dill! It gives this salsa such a great variety of flavors. The only change I made was to omit the onion. I served it with Hint of Lime Tostitos and it was a match made in heaven. I will make this again and again, thank you!

This was DEVOURED at a cookout I went to this past weekend. I got a lot of great compliments on this. I used the seedless cucumbers and added 4 chopped fresh jalapenos. It is cool and crisp and just plain good. Look forward to making this again. Thank you.

This salsa is amazing- everyone who has  tried it has asked me to make it for them.  I add a little extra jalpeno even though i don't like spice as one just wasn't enough, and add sweet white corn.  The corn made it amazing!

It was a 'cool' and refreshing salsa, but a little too tame, season-wise - for salsa.  I prepared exactly as the recipe said.  (I almost gave it 3 stars, but liked the ingredients; I may try it again and experiment with seasonings.)

I made this without the cilantro (husband won't touch cilantro) and without the parsley (just didn't have it), but with the dill.  It was good and refreshing.  Some people liked it a lot, others didn't care.  I think if you're a person who likes veggies more than the average person you'll like this.  I liked it, but my husband wouldn't touch it even though he loves cucumber (but few other veggies).  Also, I was afraid the raw onion would be overwhelming and I don't like raw onion at all, but it really was very mild - I would definitely add the same amount next time.

This recipe was a hit with all (kids too!) and a great way to use some of the many cucumbers we had from my Aunt's garden. A little extra lime juice was a must. It is very mild so I divided it into two portions; adding an extra jalapeno peppers (with seeds) and some hot sauce to one portion for those who like more heat.

this is excellent I made it last week and ate it all by myself in two days!  then made it today and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.
The only thing I did different is I added two tablespoons of lemon juice with the lime juice and doubled the parsley and cilantro.  Either way it is wonderfull!!!!

Yum!!!  We all loved this recipe!  I did add an extra shake of sea salt, and three jalapenos instead of one.  Definately a keeper!  Thank goodness I planted extra cucumbers this year!!

Awesome! Thank you for sharing this recipe. My husband and I have a TON of cucumbers from our CSA and from our family's garden. Slight modifications - I used 3 cloves of garlic (thought the original recipe called for 2, and I like garlic so I added an extra one - oops!), 2 jalapenos (one seeded/ribs removed, the other full seeds and ribs), and about 2 teaspoons of Cholula (for extra heat). I went heavy on the lime and added fresh dill instead of dried since we have so much in our garden. I will definitely be making this again and again and again!!

This is an awesome salsa.  I always make double because it's perfect.  I eat this salsa with chips, nachos, or on top of tacos/burritos!  It reminds me of the salsa I had at The Wet Lizard in Belize, C.A.

Loved it.  Only thing I changed was the spices - I don't care for Cilantro, so I added some cumin, chili powder & basil.  This was yummy.  It was great with tortilla chips, but I also used it on garlic parmesan toasts for bruschetta.  I will definitely make again!

I pureed this and ate it as a chilled soup! It was wonderful. I seasoned it with a bit of celery salt and pepper. I was looking for a recipe for chilled cucumber soup and modified this one! Would use again!

Refreshingly awesome! This is a great alternative to traditional pico de gallo. Especially if you have a garden that has produced an overabundance of the ingredients used within this recipe. That being my issue, I whipped this up in a heartbeat, but tweaked it a bit. I added and extra jalapeno pepper, used only one cucumber, added half of a red chili pepper for even more spicy heat, doubled the cilantro, used a whole lime, half a lemon and three cloves of garlic. It turned out excellent and is great on shredded chicken tostadas. The use of fresh vegetables did cause access water in the bottom of the bowl after leaving in the fridge overnight to further incorporate the flavors. I would sugest slicing up your cucumber and draining/leaving it sit in a strainer for a little while before adding to the mixture(as you would do to make homemade tzatziki sauce). That, or drain the access liquid the next morning as I did. Great recipe, and I'll be making it again for sure.

I made this as written except that I used fresh dill from my garden and dried cilantro because I didn't have enough of that yet.  It is delicious.  My kids even love it. (Just don't tell them that it's good for them!)

Refreshing and very interesting! Omitting dill was the only minor change because we hate dill period. Weird, I tasted something bitter but my husband didn't. Maybe my taste buds are out of whack.

I first tried this recipe @ the wet lizard in Belize. This salsa is very refreshing. Perfect for those who don't like spicy salsa but easy to make spicy for those who do. I used tortilla chips that had a hint of lime, and it add a nice extra kick. This recipe is definitely worth trying.

I am perplexed by the reviews on this item.  I felt this recipe really missed out on something.  A straight lime marinate needed some cutting of its tartness, so I tried adding some olive oil. Definitely add another jalapeno. This recipe takes more than 15 minutes to prepare too. Count on at least 30.  I was not impressed, unfortunately, and will not make again.

I give this a three because I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand I like the taste of fresh crisp veggies. However on the other I think it's mizzing something and want something creamy. I don't know...it's worth a shot to try it.

Very easy, refreshing and good for you!!  I left out the parsley and dill, increased the cilantro by a lot, used 3 jalapenos and used a purple onion.  All the colors are beautiful together!!  Eat it quick because it does get really watery by about day 3.  That wasn't a problem in our house...it was gone in a flash!

People seemed to really like this!  Changes I made - I omitted the cilantro (yuck!) and upped the parsley, used fresh dill, 1 large seedless/English cucumber, 2 large jalapeos and added an extra tomato.  Little advice - buy the most flavorful tomatoes you can and add a little salt right before serving.  If you add the salt too early, it will draw water out of the cucumbers and tomatoes and will make for a very runny salsa.  Also, make this several hours before serving for best flavor.

Very good.  Not your typical salsa.  It's very cool, refreshing and very addicting.  It does get very watery after a couple days so I'd make it the day before so that the flavors have time to blend, and it can be served before the cucumber has time to get too watery.

Good flavor, easy to make.  It had more of a pico de gallo consistency than what I think of as salsa but it was yummy with some corn tortillas or as a side with my enchiladas.

I had to leave out the cilantro and dill weed because I didn't have either one. I used green chilis in place of the jalapeno. This turned out ok, I added some jarred salsa after eating a few bites.

This was so good!  I did cheat a smidge, I had a can of Rotel tomatoes that i used along with one really big tomato.  I forgot the green peppers and the dill, but you really couldn't tell.  I used the juice from 2 limes and a little more salt!  What a great falvor!  This will become a regular for the summer BBQs!

I love this recipe.  The cucumber and sweet peppers give such a nice crunch and all the flavors are so fresh.  It was a bit too spicy for some, so I might use less heat next time.

This was great! I hadn't made salsa for probably 20 years and was looking for a recipe that included cucumber. For this I used lemon juice because I was out of lime, and omitted the dill because we don't care for it. I served it with homemade chips and it was cool and delish. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow; I'm sure it will be even better after sitting overnight.

Only gave it three stars because it was pretty bland, even though I doubled the Jalepeno and gave heaping measurements of the seasonings.  However, I did really enjoy it because I love cucumber.  When I make next time I will half the recipe and keep the seasonings and jalepeno where they are at.  does get liquidy in storage, but get the nice fat chips and it's ok.

Wonderful! We had just about everything in our garden, and when we realized we didn't have the parsley, we substituted celery flakes, which were delicious. The more it sits, the better it tastes. We have made it three times now, and it has made it's way into a chicken and rice recipe as well as on top of an omelet. Great party dish too - thanks!

This was okay but not as good as traditional fresh sala in our opinion (tomatoes, onions, jalapeno, cilantro).  The cucumber certainly did not add any to the flavor.

This was very good. A great change of taste to traditional salsa. My own opinion was it was much better after sitting in the fridge overnight. It had a chance for all the great flavors to combine. Thanks

I love this!  Store leftovers in fridge in a Mason Jar for easy adds to other recipes.  Great to add with chicken and a dab of ranch -makes a great chicken salad sandwich or wrap.  Thanks for sharing this!

Although I was leary about the combination of dill, lime and cilantro in the same bowl, I couldn't help but want to try this after reading the great reviews.

The reviews were right - this is different and refreshing and the combination of the flavors is really delicious.  Try it - you'll like it.  And people will appreciate something other than jarred salsa.

Made this according to the directions a few nights ago and in a word - amazing! I love salsa and adore cucumbers (especially in the summer!) and this was a huge hit for all the kids and adults alike. Lots of flavor and it is a great twist for an old favorite. A keeper! Thanks!

I made this with purple onion, added more salt and dill, but other than that, didn't change a thing.  It's delicious!

This was a great recipe.  I made this for about 40 people and it was a hit!  Next time I will cut back on the garlic and add an extra jalapeno.  Great summer dish!

The flavors of this salsa worked together really well; it was very refreshing.  I agree with other reviewers about adding more lime juice. However, 1 jalapeno was already quite spicy...and that's for my husband and I who love spicy food and can handle a lot of heat normally! So I would hesitate to recommend more than 1 pepper in the salsa.

I made this as is excpt I only had one tomato and red onion - even though I'm not a big cilantro or dill fan, this came out awesome!  Oh, I think I might have used more lime juice (personal preference) A very nice recipe!!

This salsa is the best I have ever eaten!  My partner and I are huge salsa fans, and both of us agree that this has the best flavour and is very addictive.  I added more tomato and fresh dill and it turned out perfectly.

I had a lot of cucumber to use up and wanted something to bring to a get together of moms. I made the recipe as listed w/o the dill (because I didn't have any) and with no jalapeno so it wasn't spicy. I then took half and added more garlic and a bit of jalapeno to it. It was a huge hit! I will be making it this weekend but with more jalapeno and garlic. We like it spicy!  

And the lime is a MUST. Don't skimp on the lime juice. It's what pulls it all together.

{I may or may not have had this for breakfast this morning as well!}

I live in the Middle East and my friend makes a delicious salad much like this one.  If you want to put a Middle Eastern twist to it add mint instead of cilantro and a little tahini(I personally like a significant amount of tahini in it, but makes it a bit more fattening) to coat the veggies.  It is amazing.  We also don't use dill. It is great with fish.

This is the same recipe listed on the Taste of Home website.  It is outstanding as is, but like others, prefer to add an additional 1-2 tomatoes to mine.

Took it to a pot luck and the guests were all hovering around it.  I used 1/2 yellow onion and 1/2 red onion just for that extra splash of color.  Also didn't have fresh tomatoes ... used canned diced tomatoes instead.  Omitted the dill because dill is not for me.  Also used lemon juice instead of lime -- what I had on hand.  I used 2 garlic cloves per another reviewer's suggestion.  Very glad I did.  Could have used another tablespoon of lemon to bring out more flavor.  Using 1 teaspoon rather than 1/2 t would have given it more flavor.  Other than that, wonderful recipe!!

Very good. I used with grilled chicken and wrapped in a tortilla. Perfect. However, the juice left it not so crisp the next day.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh to cut down cost and used what was on hand.

this is a wonderful summer salsa!!  It tastes so fresh and light.  I've made it several times now from fresh veggies from my garden and it has received rave reviews every time.  this year we've planted parsley and cilantro and I'm really looking forward to trying it with the fresh herbs from the garden instead of the store!

Excellent blend of Ingredients...Fresh flavor. I doubled the Garlic and added sweet bananna peppers from my garden. I use Mortons Lite Salt these days, added 1/2 tsp black pepper. This will be a  regular addition every year.

This was pretty popular as a summer appetizer -- the cucumber is a nice addition to an otherwise standard pico de gallo.  The volume was way too much, though, to be useable for a regular BBQ at our house, and it doesn't keep all that well.  Either halve the salsa, or double the chips and have a really big party!

This was ok but I will not make it again.  I ended up having to add about a 1/4 cup of my favorite salsa to the mix and it made it taste good enough to not waste.

Very good.  I decided to add a "sweet" note to the salsa, and added frozen corn (thawed).  I also used red onion, as that is what I had on hand.  This is a versatile recipe, and a great starting point.

This is so good served with some crackers. I love this because i cam eat as much as i want and not feel guilty, everything is fresh and good for you. The only thing is it doesnt keep but for a day or two because the juices from the veggies make it get very watery. DE-LISH!

I was hoping for better -but I think part of the reason mine did not taste as great as the reviews was due to my produce. I think my cukes and tomatoes wren't very flavorful and maybe not ripe enough. I should have tasted them first. There was plenty of heat though. I will try this again because I have had salsa with cucumbers before and loved it. Just make sure my veggies are in better shape. It definitely tasted better the next day.

This was a good recipe and I really enjoyed the addition of the cucembers to a garden salsa. I did find that it needed a lot more lime juice for my taste. Also, if you are lloking for a little more kick from your salsa, don't see the jalapeno. The seeds have oils in them that release heat.

It was a nice change from the regular salsa, but it was a little on the bland side for us.  That may have been because I put the minced garlic in the lime juice to tame the raw garlic taste before adding it to the other ingredients.  But it was good for a change, and had a nice crunch.

I made this to go with broiled fish. I left out the bell pepper since family isn't a fan, and one of the things I like most is that people have added/subtracted ingredients to fit their family's taste.  I added additional lime as it was recommended by many of the reviewers.   It's delicious.

This recipe was OK as written, but you need to amp it up and it will be phenomenal.  I used 2 cloves of garlic,  extra parsley, jalapeno and dill. I added salt and used the juice of FOUR limes. It is perfect now. I omitted the cilantro, but if you like cilantro, I would suggest adding more than the recipe calls for as well.  The flavors really go well together.  It's crisp and fresh.

I didn't have parsley on hand so it was omitted. It's delicious even before the flavors marry. With the bumper crop of cucumbers we have, this will be made several times before the end of season!

This is excellent.  We use Tostitos brand Hint of Lime tortilla chips to eat it with and it gives it a real tangy taste.  A great way to get non vegetable lovers to eat veggies!

Different, but surprisingly delicious! Very refreshing! Easy to adjust the heat in this based on taste preference by adding more jalapeno if you want more. Recommend letting it sit for a bit before adding more hot peppers though. This salsa worked perfectly for our burrito bowls tonight! Can't wait to try it with tortilla chips too! Thanks for the recipe recommendation BOOKIE and thanks to author for sharing the recipe!

I've made this twice now, it's wonderfully refreshing but has no heat. 2nd time I made I had 2 jalapeños, but still needed more heat. Next time I make it, I'll try 3 jalapeños.

Tastes light and fresh, letting it sit in the lime juice in the fridge for at least an hour really brings out the flavor.  I didn't have cilantro on hand so made it without.  Used 3 fresh jalapeños from the garden and it was the perfect amount of spice for me.  Probably could have added a 4th even.

I followed the recipe and the result was acceptable.  Not wow.  I'm looking for "wow."  I think I will try a hotter pepper, or maybe just move onto another recipe.  I wish I could rate as 3.5.

Must try. I've been making this for years. I don't use dill and use red onion for color and less bite. Extra lime juice and salt. Perfect with texas brisket on corn tortillas!!!

I followed recipe exactly and it tasted a little bland, it needed something, not sure what,  It could be really good if I figure out what missing.

I thought this was going to be great, but it fell completely flat for me. I followed the recipe as written, and it just tasted like it needed something more.

8 12 14 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/75637/cool-cucumber-salsa/ ... Good - & not too cucumbery either!  :D  I only had one large tomato.  Added an additional jalapeno as suggested.  'Serving it relatively soon so I sprinkled in garlic powder & onion powder.  Smelling & stirring now & then, I wasn't so sure about the dill; but it blended in nicely after a few hours' refrigeration.  'Subbed 1t cilantro for fresh.  The additional jalapeno was enough for heat.  They vary so I'd be careful upping to three.  Oh, I added 2t sriracha, but that may have not been enough to do much.  I also added a couple Ts olive oil to help the spices "stick."  :)  Final note:  This doesn't seem weird like the blueberry salsa I made.  The cucs give the same impression as tomatoes.  Who woulda ...?!  :)  Next day:  The heat is up to medium.  Very good, not quite "hot;" but much toastier than yesterday!  I'm having in flour tortillas with feta cheese & chip crumbs added.  Yum ... 7 2017 SUZYQ!  :)  Save this one!  (& AR says I made "Ginger-Spiced Cucs" three times.  I haven't; sometime though.  :D)

We've done tomato pico before without cucumber and we really liked the addition of the cucumber.  Overall it was yummy and a hit at our bbq-even for our NM guests.  But we thought it could use more kick or zing.  It made ALOT so I think I'll try adding more lime and maybe a little dill weed to the remainder and see how it is after marinating for a day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never made cucumber salsa before but make gallons of salsa every year with fresh veggies from my garden. This was awesome!!! I doubled the first batch and after 1 bite I knew I had to make more to can.

This is an awesome salsa recipe. The cucumbers add a nice snap or crunch. I didn't have cilantro and I didn't miss it. I used this salsa to place on top of cooked fish and will do the same with grilled chicken. Great recipe to make good use of cucumbers and tomatoes as they ripen and come in season!

Excellent salsa... Love the cucumber - so original and fresh, particularly good when u have a garden full of them and need to get rid of :) I would however, not seed the jalapeño, and maybe add another. It was great as is, but not hot at all...I was  able to heat it up by adding red pepper flakes to taste.

Used 2 oz. mild green chilies and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes in place of green pepper and jalapenos I did not have.  Also used dried cilantro and parsley and it still turned out AWESOME!  Yum!

12 servings is huge so I made 6 servings, but it's still A LOT! I didn't have green peppers so I substituted them with yellow and red peppers. It's so yummy! I pour this all over my salmon, which fills me up and I don't feel guilty for having so much flavoring on my food! Healthy & Diet friendly!
