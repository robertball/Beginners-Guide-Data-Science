This is a great recipe if you are looking for something, quick, cheap and kid friendly. It costs approximately $4.00 to make( including macaroni or rice to serve it on),makes a ton, and tastes wonderful. My 3 year old gobbles this up each time I make it. You can add vegetables, sour cream or different spices to add more kick if desired. This is a weekly staple at my house. Gourmet food this is not, but just simple, great everyday fare. Definitely worth trying.

I used some leftover homemade chicken veggie soup & it was great.  My two year old had seconds (we were about to call Guiness World book on that one).

It was surprisingly good for how easy it was!

I basically added the ground beef to my leftover chicken soup for a little variety. I added only a little bit of water to reduce thickness. It came out well.

Very kid friendly recipe.  I changed it up a bit to add more flavor.  Used one can of alphabet veggie soup and a can of beef veggie soup. Also added a half package of frozen mixed veggies.  While browning the meat, I added some garlic powder and Mrs. Dash.  Towards the end, I thickened it with cornstarch until it reached the consistency I was looking for.

This was good and so easyto make. I doubled the recipe as I wanted some for lunches for the week. I didn't double the water and I added another can of soup. We enjoyed this. My husband thought it needed more seasonings.

I made this tonight with rice and really liked the smooth consistancy this dish has. Like other's suggested, I only used 1/2 of the water & thickened it up at the end with corn starch. Seemed a little bland so I did add pepper & a few shakes of Emeril's essence. I would have given this 3 1/2 stars, but since my picky kids cleaned their plates, this one deserves at least 4. Great idea Lorieann for a quick dinner.  I will use this again & try other soups.

I only used 1/2 can of water which made the dish the right consistency. I added garlic and onion to the beef when I browned it. Next time I will add  mixed veggies. And then maybe even experiment with different kinds of soups. An easy dinner.

This was pretty good, and very easy/fast. Kind of bland. I guess what soup you use could change that. Also for the soups I used this was a high salt/ high fat (lots of meat) meal. Not so sure about the "good for you claim". Very hearty

I'm not gonna lie - this didn't sound good to me, I only tried it because it was cheap and easy, but I was suprised by how yummy it was!  I make this a couple times a month and everyone in the family eats it up!

We will definitely make this one again! Cheap, quick, easy and just plain good. Especially over biscuits--the refrigerator kind, of course. :-)

I don't think I even the full can of water in this.  This was surprisingly yummy and even my husband (a VERY picky eater) said he would eat it again.  Babygirl loved it, too - lots of things already toddler-sized in the soup.  Total comfort food.

Like a previous reviewer, I served this over hot biscuits.  Next time I'll be using the frozen biscuits and it will be even better :)))

This is such an easy and delicious recipe! I made spiced mine up a little with garlic and onion and like other reviewer's, used a little less than half of the water called for. I added a little Gravy Master to brown the sauce a bit and served over plain Couscous. Delicious!

Quick and easy for a flavorful meal. I'm sure homemade vegetable soup would work better than canned with the addition of garlic and onion.

I make a version of this I refer to as poor mans shepards pie. Using 1 lb lean ground beef and 2 cans condensed vegetable beef soup. Omitting the water. Before simmering I add 1 can of drained green beans and then make mashed potatos while its simmering. Add the potato's to the top and sprinkle with cheese. Once cheese is melted, its ready! Enjoy!

I just made this tonight for the first time. I had two starving men here, and this made for a super-fast, filling meal. I used Beef with vegetables and barley soup, as I was out of regular vegetable, and served it over rice. My males LOVED it and so did I. I will definitely make this again.

This was boring. Not a lot of flavor, but teen-aged boys liked it. Made some of the suggested adjustments and just had to admit that hamburger has little flavor.

I can't believe I've never thought of doing this before!  This was so delish!  The whole family loved it.  We ate with mashed potatoes and over some drop biscuits.  I'm telling everyone about this recipe.  Oh soooo good!  I seasoned my ground beef with garlic and onion powder but that's a normal thing for me.  It doesn't need it.

This recipe was quick, simple, and good. I added one chopped-up onion and a clove of chopped garlic with the ground beef. I used a can of Campbell's Ready-To-Eat Beef Vegetable soup since that's all we had on hand (I drained it into a cup, added the solids, and then added as much liquid from the cup as I needed to get the right consistency). My family liked it and we'll make it again.

Very easy to make and quick to prepare!  My husband is a tough one and he even liked it!  The kids gobbled it up!!!  I served it over rice with potatoes julienne and southern style biscuits.  Mmmmmm!
