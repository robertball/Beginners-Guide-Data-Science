This recipe took me a little over three hours, but it’s quick to put together and has good flavor.  So, if you’re planning on a lazy Sunday afternoon, you may want to give this a try.  Enjoy!

I was VERY skeptical about the oven temp and the baking time, so I lowered the temp to 300 for 45, then lowered it again to 250 for the extra hour I cooked it for.  I knew when I checked it after the first 45 that the cook times seemed way off, but I told my self (like an idiot) to follow the recipe!  I pulled the pan out of the oven after an hour, and the thighs were like jerky, and the potato's were so crispy on the outside, we had to use a steak knife to cut into them to eat the inside!

We really like this recipe. Easy, inexpensive, and tasty! I used the same ingredients the recipe calls for but used only six chicken thighs. We don’t eat out at restaurants very much so we are used to meals that are not overly salty or pre-packaged. For us the seasoning was spot on. Thanks for this nice recipe Dede!!

Not nearly enough flavour... not NEARLY enough.  I'd read an earlier review warning of this, so I used way more  seasoning than the recipe actually calls for and it was STILL bland.  The potatoes were fantastic, otherwise I'd give this recipe just one star.
