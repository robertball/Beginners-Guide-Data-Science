I make a similiar recipe, and found earlier on that dropping your pretzel into the water/ soda bath makes it sticky. Submerging in the bath for 15 seconds?I tried that method and the pretzels just started to disenegrate. My suggestion is to put your water and baking soda in a large saucepan so that the water is shallow. If you drop your pretzels into a pot of water, it submerges them and you have a "swimming" pretzel. It is hard to retrieve. I just lay the pretzels down flat in the saucepan for a few seconds just to absorb a little of the water and coat it. I actually make my twists smaller so they are easier to handle getting them out of the solution. Use a large flat spatula to lift them from underneath. After you dip them into your water, they tend to not want to stick on the ends and your twist can come undone if you are pulling it out with your hands or tongs. I also use kitchen scissors and instead of twisting, I cut the "rolled rope of dough" in two inch intervals to make pretzel bites. You get the same GREAT taste and they are easier to get out of the water/ soda bath. Probably yummier because you can leave them in the bath longer than the twists. They won't break up as bad. The recipe that I use I found in a Copycat cookbook, and it is the actual recipe used in the mall pretzels we love so much. It uses light corn syrup instead of brown sugar, much richer taste.

Very easy and good. I used to be a manager at a pretzel shop years ago and this is how we made them. A few tips...  After dipping pretzel in the baking soda/water mixture, place on a dish towel or layer of paper towels to dry the bottom off, this will help prevent the bottoms burning.  Also, use parchment paper. Oven should be at 400-415 (parchment paper cannot be used above 420).  Turn baking sheet halfway through for even browning. I used tongs to dip the face of the pretzel in a pie plate of melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven.  Next time I will try adding raisins to the dough for a breakfast pretzel.

These are the best homemade pretzels.  They are chewy and soft.  I have made them many times and have always gotten rave reviews.  They are gone within the hour.  I brush them with melted butter and sprinkle the salt on before I bake them.  It gives them a deep golden brown color and makes them extra tasty.  *For those without a bread machine: combine the yeast, water and sugar in a bowl and let sit until it is foamy.  Add your flour until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.  Knead it until smooth on a lightly floured surface.  Place in a greased bowl and cover for 45-60 mins or until doubled.  Then continue following the directions.*  The water/soda bath is an important step because it helps the rising of the pretzels in the oven.

Awsome!!! I used corn syrup like another reviewer suggested and it really worked to make the pretzels chewy and soft. We did half the dough as pretzel bites and half as twists. The bites went the fastest and are fun to eat. This was extremely simple and quick to make.

To dunk the pretzels: Use a large pot, and place your pretzel into a metal strainer or sieve.  The sieve allows you to properly bathe your pretzel, and makes it so easy to bring out, drain and flop onto paper towels.  Fantastic recipe!

Not exactly like the mall pretzels but if you do it right it's very close and well worth the t8ime spent for the money you save. To all the reviewers that didn't know what to do with the baking soda or ended up with batter I suggest you read the recipe because the soda and larger quantitiy of water are for the bath not the dough. I really liked this recipe but it could easily go wrong if you dont pay attention. I follow the recipe exactly except i use bread flour or sub 1 Tbsp per cup of gluten flour to make bread flour, this makes a much chewier pretzel. It is also important to knead well to get chewy pretzels. Also i used a small sauce pan and 1 Tbsp of baking soda per cup of water for the bath same solution just not as much of it. i use a flat slotted spatula to remove it from the water and brush with melted butter right after i take the mout of the oven and sprinkle with salt.

Did I do something wrong?  The dough, or should I say batter, was very thin for pretzel dough.  And very sticky.  I think this recipe needed a whole lot more flour, I know I measured correctly so what gives?

Dissapeared!  I made these on Thanksgiving for something new to try and they turned out marvelously.  I didn't have a bread machine, but looked up how to deal with yeast on this site and soaked it in the warm water like it said.  After boiling them in the making soda and water I gave them an egg wash and sprinkled coarse salt all over them.  Also I added 1tsp of salt in the dough.  Thank you for the yummie pretzels.

I've probably made these 10 times in the past month, they are excellent.  I used corn syrup instead of brown sugar, and both regular and fast-acting yeast.  They come out great.  I've wrapped a 4 inch square around uncooked cheese hot dogs, dropped into the boiling water for a minute, then baked, and they make amazing pretzel cheese dogs.  Thank you!

Yummy! Very good! I made these with the mustard sauce from the Taste of Home Kitchen recipe and I like them better plain! They did however look more like rolls than pretzels-next time I'll make more than 8... Also i cut the baking soda bath in 1/2-there's really no need to use up an entire box! :)  Oh! Don't forget to grease the pan! I didn't and ended up with only half a pretzel from each.  You can also put the salt on before baking them and then you don't need to dampen them-they're already wet from their baking soda bath.  Just be sure you don't get shampoo in their eyes! (tee hee)

These came out really great; they were nice and soft and the texture was nice.  If you want a tougher outside, you might want to do an egg wash, but I did not.

My whole family LOVED these pretzels!  They were a particular hit with my 13-year-old nephew!  I made these pretzels using the dough setting of my bread machine, as suggested.  I got busy with dinner and couldn't get back to them; so, they did rise once before shaping and baking.  I also used the corn syrup instead of the brown sugar because it was suggested that it made the pretzels softer.  I can't imagine a better soft pretzel recipe.  These do taste just like the ones you purchase at the mall.  I will definitely make these again -- SOON!!

I have tried several recipes for soft pretzels from allrecipes, and this one I like the least.  The dough from the machine was very sticky, and all five in our family agreed not to make these again.  We are big pretzel fans, yet we still haven't come across a recipe for the pretzels like we get at our mall :(

Making these pretzels was a horrible idea...THEY ARE SO GOOD!!! I read another review that used bread flour so I used an all-purpose/bread flour mix (2 cups all purpose, 1 cup bread flour) I don't know if it made a difference  but they were chewy on the inside.  Drenched them in unsalted butter and they sprinkled on sea salt and they tasted just like the ones from the mall.  They were great and I will be making these again and again!

These are FANTASTIC!! I was a little confused with the instructions though. You say to let it go through the dough cycle on the bread machine. On my machine the cycle is over an hour long, and when I looked at the prep time on the recipe it said 30 minutes, so obviously the cycle couldn't be completed. You also mentioned to check after 5 minutes, so I decided to pull the dough out at that point, only in the machine for 5 minutes and it worked out perfectly! Followed the rest of the instructions and Viola!, yummy pretzels. The only change I made was to substitute corn syrup for the brown sugar, and I am totally happy with the outcome. These will definately be put in my recipe book!

I followed this recipes exactly as it is written... That being said, these were so easy to make and they were delicious!  The bread machine does most of the work.  When coming out of the bread machine's dough cycle the doughnwas quite sticky, but I managed to dump it out on to a floured counter.  The dough was really airy and easy to work with.  I divided the dough into 10 pieces so that I had an equal amount for my family to eat.  I rolled them in my hands and twisted them into a pretzel shape and lightly pressed down on them.  Once they were all shaped I added 2 at a time to a stockpot filled with the water and baking soda.  Waited 15 seconds and dried them all on paper towels.  Baked them on a baking sheet sprayed with vegetable oil spray for 8 minutes.  They are crispy but not too hard on the outside and the inside is soft, airy and chewy.  A hint of sweetness, but not over powering.  I had a problem getting salt to stick after baking so I may try adding the salt before baking - and there will definitely be a next time, if I had more flour, I would be making another batch right now!

I followed the recipe exactly except for two minor adjustments suggested by other reviewers: substituting corn syrup for the brown sugar, and boiling the pretzels in a deep saucepan instead of a pot.  The pretzels turned out perfectly and were SO YUMMY!

I've never made pretzels before, they turned out really good.  I did what another reviewer said and brushed them with butter and sprinkled with salt before baking them.  Really easy to make and the taste is great.  I'll make them smaller next time, they raise a lot while they bake

I have used this recipe many times already. My mother nags at me to make more constantly! I may try the recommendation to use corn syrup in place of the brown sugar. However, I usually use splenda (brown sugar mix). They are wonderful. I use a strainer spoon to pull the pretzels out of the water/soda bath and have had no issues with the pretzels "dissinigrating" or falling apart or anything. I absolutely love the flavor of these. This is a recipe I will be using... forever! Thanks

This was a very easy recipe (compared to may other pretzel recipes)...especially since you didn't have to wait for the dough to rise.  With that said, there were a few things I didn't like: 1) I expected the inside to bake to a beautiful white but it was brownish, perhaps bc of the brown sugar, 2) they took much longer to bake than the recipe stated to get them really brown on the outside like a pretzel should be, and 3) they didn't tast much like a store-bought pretzel.  I prefer the "Buttery Soft Pretzels" recipe I've also tried on this site!

These are FANTASTIC!  As a mother of two children with severe food allergies, I am constantly tweaking recipes to make them fit with our restrictions.  These, however, didn't need any changes.  Next time, I'm making some pretzel dogs!  These will definitely be a staple in our home.  Thank you!

Oh wow ! It dosen't get any easier then this. Dough was a dream to work with right out of the mechine. Water bath was not that big of a deal, Thanks to the other grate reviewers that said use a shallow pan. He who never gets his way was verry happy. Neighbor wanted to pay me to make him some. He is a fireman and loves to snack.

I'm rating this five stars, but I really feel the directions could use a little more clarification. 
First off, I added a pinch of salt to the bread machine ingredients as a matter of preference, but they'd be fine without.
Second, here is what I did to assemble the pretzels as I felt the recipe directions were a little vague:  After running the dough through the bread machine cycle, I kneaded the dough a few times on lightly floured surface.  I found the BEST way to assemble these is to divide the dough, and then roll out all of the ropes at once.  Shape the pretzels one by one RIGHT before you drop them in the boiling baking soda water.  This helped them to retain the classic pretzel shape.  Shaping them earlier caused them to become misshaped in the water.  I also let mine go a little longer in the water.  This makes them a little chewier and more pretzel like.

My first try at pretzels and this was a great recipe. I did add a little salt to the ingredients in the bread maker and used 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoons of light corn syrup. I also had the water just simmering and set each dough pretzel on a large and dipped them into the water. I didn't have any trouble with the knots coming loose. Make sure and coat each hot baked pretzel with water and immediately sprinkle with kosher salt. Enjoy.

These are absolutely delicious!  I have made them several times now and my whole family loves them.  The only problem is that 8 pretzels are not enough!  The bread machine makes making these easy!

Excellent Pretzel!  Turned out soft, chewy, and yummy.  THe dough is very tasty.  I took the advice of a couple other reviews.  I Baked them at 410 degrees on parchment paper and boiled them in shallow water for 15 seconds.  I WILL make these again.

I had watched a demonstration of how to make the soft pretzels on a website called monkeysee.com.  A representative from Auntie Anne's Pretzels showed how to make their soft pretzels using one of their kits.  Well, i didn't want to buy a kit, I just wanted an at home recipe I could use in conjunction with the demo.  This recipe worked great.  Maybe this could help you too.  The part of this recipe where the water and baking soda are suppossed to be boiling...I didn't boil the water.  Just make it warm enough to dissolve the soda and follow how the guy on the video does it.

I made these pretzels for movie night for my 10 year old and her friends last summer. Since then, I've had to make them for these kids (and parents) six more times. They are better than the ones in the mall. Twice, I have made pretzel bites instead of traditional shaped pretzels with pretty good results.

Very nice.  I didn't have any problem with the dough--thought I would, it's snowy and wet here, but it was fine.  I didn't use the amount of water and baking soda called for--in my experience, you can do the baking soda bath with much less water and baking soda if you use a small, shallow pan.  So, that's what I did and just dipped the pretzels one at a time.  As other reviewers said, you don't have to put them in for 15 seconds--5 or 10 will do--you just want to make sure they get dunked so they will have the nice chewy crust that pretzels and bagels are known for.  I don't spritz with water after baking, either--I just add anything I'm going to add (salt, cinnamon sugar, etc) after the baking soda bath and prior to baking.  Works perfectly!  I put kosher salt on mine this time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made these so many times I can't even count them, and they come out wonderful every time. Next time I'll try the corn syrup instead of brown sugar, just to see if I like it better, but no improvements are necessary, in my opinion. The baking soda bath is a bit difficult, but still do-able with practice. I use a flat spatula to lift them out, and yes they're sticky at that point, but once you bake them, you realize how great that made them. I've tried all the stuff they do in the mall-plain (salted), cinnamon-sugar, cheese, etc...always delicious.

These are awesome!  Came out perfect - we ate these for supper!  Brushed with melted butter and topped with sea salt - they tasted just like a mall pretzel.  Next time I make the dough I'm going to try to make pretzel buns for sandwiches.

These pretzels were good but I've tried some better recipes. I tend to read the reviews of others who have had problems and try to make "mistakes" so i can help them... to the person who said the dough was like a batter and that you measured correctly.. i agree, you did measure correctly but the only way my dough turned into a "batter" was by adding the 2 quarts of water meant for boiling to the actual dough itself.

We don't have a bread machine so we mixed the water and the yeast in a small bowl and let sit for a few minutes.  Next, we added it to the sugar and flour and mixed w/the dough hook on my Kitchen Aid Mixer for ~5 minutes.  I did end up adding a few more T of flour so it wouldn't be too sticky.  I put the pretzles on a slotted spoon and put into the water - this made it easy in/easy out.  Also brushed w/melted butter instead of water.  Sooooo good - will definately make it again!

Oh, so easy and so delicious.  I wish my bread maker had a bigger capacity.  My family loved them and my husband said they were better than the pretzels at the mall.  I can't wait to make them again.

I found that the easiest way to submerge them is to boil the water/soda in a large pot, "tie" the pretzels on a large flat pancake turner, and leave them on the turner when submerging.

Still working on my rolling and shaping, but these turned out delicious.  My kids love walking through the door after school and smelling homemade pretzels.  They are one of their favorite after school snacks.  Love that this recipe utilizes the bread machine, so there is very little hands on preparation, until the rolling.  A keeper recipe in this house!

I made these with my 4 year old yesterday and it was a lot of fun.


I wasn't sure if you were suppose to wait for the entire dough  cycle (1 hour 30 min) or just let it mix and knead for 5 minutes.We also had a tough time making them into the pretzel shape so we made them into sticks. 


THey tasted great.

Easy, and so good!  I made three batches for a get together and the dough was consistent each batch.  Divided each batch into 12 smaller pretz and set out melted garlic butter, nacho type cheese and mustard.  Very well recvd, and I know I'll be making these a lot more often. Looking forward to trying them stuffed with jackcheese and jalepenos!

This was my first attempt at soft pretzels and I love how easy and fast this was. The first batch out of the oven I couldn't get the salt to stick, the second I got it be I prefer the saltless.  I cant wait to try them with cinnamon sugar and other dips, we had sharp cheddar spread.  Awesome football snack and makes quite a few, two cookie trays worth. I made them in our kitchenaid mixer with ease..thanks for the new snack!

These are awesome! My 3 boys couldn't stop saying YUM!  I followed the recipe to a T, but found that I need to add about 1/4 cup more water to the dough and friends recommended a pinch of salt for the dough.  I made some with no salt, some with coarse salt and (the best!) some with butter and cinnamon sugar mixture.  The last batch tasted JUST like pretzels from the mall! I couldn't believe it! I ended up cooking the cinnamon/sugar pretzel (sticks) at 400 degrees for only 6 minutes. Delicious!!

My babies love the pretzels at the mall stand and I thought we would try our hand at making them at home.  I was surprised that with so few ingredients and such an easy recipe- these were actually quite good!!  We had a blast shaping the dough and the boys just loved them.  thanks

This is a great recipe - makes very yummy pretzels! I found the whole process a little fiddly and tricky to avoid pretzels falling apart after being in the baking soda solution, but found that making the twists smaller (as someone else said) and using a flat mesh "spoon" (like the ones used for removing food from deep fryers) to hold the pretzel in the water was the answer :) My sons wolfed these down within minutes and the verdict was "two thumbs up". Will definitely be making these again!

I followed this recipe exactly and they tasted very doughy. My 7 year-old, who eats everything, would not eat them. I'll keep looking for a recipe like the mall pretzels.

This is a great recipe!  I used corn syrup sugge1s4ted by other reviews and it made it really soft and chewy.  I also turned the oven down to 415 so the bottoms wouldn't burn.

Yummy, chewy pretzels! And they were pretty simple, too.  I added maybe 1/3 c extra flour to the bread machine and they weren't hard to work with at all.  I gave this 4 stars because by itself, it's just so-so.  It's really whatever you put on top that makes them kick butt!  I used a butter, brown sugar, honey glaze and added a little salt to them before covering either in cinnamon sugar or chopped almonds.  My menfolk tore them UP!

Ridiculously Good!  You don't need to change anything.  I did bake on parchment, but that's it.  Also melted butter and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on some of them.  My family saie, "Oh, NO, please don't make too many" because you just can't say no to them.

These pretzels taste GREAT and are so easy to make.  The bread machine does all the work.  The changes I made were to dip the pretzels in a mixture of warm water and baking soda.  When done, I brushed them with butter and sprinkled with sea salt.  My 8 year old granddaughter was visiting and she rolled little balls with the dough and named them "pretzel tots".  They were perfect bite-size pretzels.  Why didn't I think of that.  Thank you Sherry Peterson for sharing such a GREAT recipe!

These soft pretzels were very easy to make with my bread machine. I followed the recipe for the dough and it was quite sticky trying to remove it from my bread machine. Next time I will  add about 1/4 cup more flour to the machine. I boiled them in the baking soda bath as directed and they did not fall apart. They tasted a little too sweet  for our taste so I will try less brown sugar next time.  The outside of the pretzels were a bit "moist" but I will use egg wash instead of melted butter next time. (I followed another review and put the butter and salt on before baking) All in all,  these tasted pretty good and are worth saving in my recipe box.

Very good!  I thought I messed up the recipe, because the dough needed a bit more flour, which I didn't realize until it was done, and was really sticky.  However, I rolled it in a little flour, and cut them into bite sized pieces, since I had a hard time working with the dough.  Turned out fantastic.  So, if you have a hard time working the dough, cut them up into about 1 to 2 inch pieces.  Great recipe!

This is an excellent, quick recipe for soft pretzels. The pretzels are soft, fluffy and puffy. I love the fact that they don't require any rising time and are so easy to make. I just throw all the dough ingredients into my standing mixer with a dough hook and let it run until the dough is smooth - about 5 minutes. You can even use part whole wheat flour in this recipe. Also, I find no need to drain the pretzels on paper towels. Just place directly on the cookie sheets (well greased or lined with parchment paper) and bake. Also, brushing water on freshly baked pretzels is something I don't like doing. It just makes them soggy. The pretzels came out better with those changes for me. Will definitely make again!

YUMMY!!! I've been trying to find the perfect pretzel for a while, now, I've found it. I let my pretzel soak in the bath for the 10-15 seconds maybe even longer and had no problems. Thank you for sharing.   *****************UPDATE****************** I've been making these preztels on a regular basis and every time they come out perfect. I took these to work for a treat and was asked to bring again and again.

WOW- my husband is from Chicago and loves the taste of these pretzels.  I have to perfect their shape and rolling but if you can get by what they look like, they taste great, we used melted butter and salt and of course mustard.  Would also be great with nacho/spicy cheese.

I made these twice in three days because they were so good.  The first time, we skipped the salt and made "Cheese Dipping Sauce" from this site and they were fantastic!  The second time I made these, we sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar and again fantastic.  They are even great as leftovers.  I jokingly said that I would make these every day and my husband's response was "I hear angels singing."  I boiled the water in a large skillet and used a slotted spoon or spatula to carefully place them in and scoop them out and I didn't have any problems with them breaking up.  I apparently will be making these often, I'm glad they were easier than it seemed.

These tend to go soggy so quickly after cooling.
I've never needed them to keep more than a few hours since they're so popular but I would like to send them in a care package.

I skip the water step and after they are finished in machine i roll and cut them into little bites (approx 1" long) and bake. When finished brush with melted butter and sprinkle on salt, parm cheese, garlic or whatever you can imagine... my family and friends love them! ENJOY!

My kids were wanting mall pretzels today when we went shopping--decided to try them at home.  I used my KitchenAid with the hook and let the water and yeast sit for 10 mintues as I do for pizza dough.  Then added brown sugar and flour and let the KitchenAid do it's thing for 5 minutes.  Resulted in perfect dough to use; even my 6 year old could handle it.  We ended up making pretzel bites and they were great!  We waited for the pretzels to float to the top before we fished them out and then baked them. Melted butter and salt was perfect and the overall effect was fantastic.  I might try putting a little salt in the dough next time, and putting melted butter and salt on before I bake just to experiment. Wonderful recipe!

Wow!  You do not need to look any further for the simplest, best home-made soft pretzel!  This is it, folks.  This could not be simpler to make and the taste is outta this world.  Thanks, Sherry, for a totally awesome recipe.

These were Awesome! Just like the ones you get at the Mall. I surprised Hubby tonight with them and they were a big hit. Only thing is 8 of these is way to much for just the two of us, does anyone know if you could refrigerate half of the dough , say just over night ?

Supremely easy to make and very tasty.  So good in fact that I am trying to learn how to adapt this recipe to gluten free.

After reading many of the reviews, I agree that the recipe does call for a small amount of salt within the dough. I also added garlic powder and Italian seasonings to the dough and then garlic powder to the baking soda wash.  The best way to get these in and out of the baking soda is with a slotted spoon and its not necessary to leave them in long. Enjoy!

We made these for several football parties and they were a tremendous hit... in fact, a second batch had to be made at halftime.  We found that rolling the dough into the ropes and cutting them into 1-2 inch bite-sized pieces was the easiest way to prepare them and even more fun to eat.   For a perfect cheese accompaniment, try:  8oz package cream cheese, diced and softened 8oz Velveeta, cubed 1/2tsp garlic powder 1/3cup beer, room temp 2 whole jalapenos, finely chopped  Add all ingredients into a small slow cooker and heat, stirring occasionally until smooth. Tasty!

This is a very good recipe, although you should add directions about what to do if we don't have a bread mixer. Then this recipe is 100% user friendly. Other than that, I just experimented and mixed it all together like the directions said, and kneaded my own dough. It could use a little more flavor in the dough, but all in all it was good and easy.

Awesome.  Only real change I made was to use half ap flour and half whole wheat.  Instead of topping with salt, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top.  Impressed myself and the fam with this one!  Thanks for sharing.

These were awesome! They taste just like the kind you buy at a pretzel place. My only suggestion would be to shape the pretzel, put it on a slatted spatula and place the spatula in the boiling water, that way you don't lose the shape of the pretzel like I did. My boyfriend came home and scarfed down three of these. I will definitely make them again, I'll probably try cinanamon and sugar or parmesan toppings next time.

These were delicious, but I think they need a bit of salt added to the mix if you are going to do other toppings other than the just salt.  I checked out other soft pretzel recipes and all seem to have salt in the dough.  I will make again, but will try adding 3/4 teaspoon salt to the bread machine.

These were sooooo good. I didn't have any of the problems some other reviewers had. I followed the recipe exactly except, for the water bath, I put 2 cups water & 2 tablespoons baking soda in a small pot, and I dipped one pretzel in at a time for 10-15 seconds. Before I baked them, I brushed the tops w/a beaten egg mixed with a little water, and sprinkled on Kosher salt. Delicious!!! I will definitely make these again!

YUMMY! Make sure you read the recipe carefully, the 2 quarts of water is for boiling! I'm glad I read the other reviews!!!! These are easy and delicious. I didn't have a bread machine, so I just let the yeast disolve in the water, added the remaining ingredients, and then used the dough hook in my kichenaid.  Worked Perfectly!

I am amazed at how well these turned out considering the machine did most of the work and there were not many ingredients! Chewy and delicious. I didn't alter anything. And the kids loved rolling out the ropes!

really enjoyed this recipe. My husband grew up in Philadelphia and he says these remind him of the pretzels they use to get there. Took others advice and brushed with 1/4 cup butter and sprinkled with salt before baking. Browned nicely.

These were fantastic. The dough was definitely way to sticky but I just added some extra flour and it was no problem. I made them into sticks instead of the usual shape and they are delicious. I'm going to make a cheese sauce to go with them (If I can stop eating the plain ones).

I checked the dough during the cycle and it looked very sticky so I added a little bit more flour, probably should've added a lot more.  When the dough was done it was a sticky mess but I wasn't going to waste it so I got as much out of the pan as I could and kneaded it a couple times on a floured surface.  It was very easy to work with despite how sticky it was and the water bath did make them sticky but once they were drained they were easy to move to the cookie sheet.  I will make them again but I will add a little salt to the dough.

These were good for the most part.  I did have trouble trying to shape them though and ended up just rolling them out with my hands into a long roll, folding in half and twisting the two sides together.  Once boiled and baked though it was more a lump than anything.  The taste was still there but lacking in presentation.  I don't know how others got them to hold shape?

I don't get it . . . why does this recipe have so many great ratings?  I saved judgment until the second time I tried this - just to make sure that I had done everything correctly.  It is a sticky mess, more like a batter, as another reviewer suggested.  The second time, I cut down the water to 1 cup and even added more flour.  Flavor is good, but this is not a workable dough.  I will keep searching. . .

I just took these out of the oven about fifteen minutes ago and they are already almost gone!  The only reason there are any left at all at this point is because i set some aside to try and freeze them to see how easy they are to reheat.  my husband was buying two or three boxes of the frozen cheese stuffed pretzels at the grocery store but this will save us so much money!   I don't have a bread machine so i put the sugar (i also used dark brown sugar because that's all I had), yeast and water in a bowl and let it sit for about 30 minutes.  I then added the flour a little at a time, mixing with my hands.  I had a little extra flour left over. I kneaded the dough for a few minutes, then I put the dough ball in a greased bowl covered with a couple damp paper towels for an hour until it doubled in size.  I rolled out the dough and cut it into bite size pieces.  I cut the water/baking soda mix in half and put the bites in a few at a time, flipping after about 8-10 seconds.  sprayed them with butter and sprinkled with normal table salt (all I had on hand, next time will use kosher!).  This was my first time ever attempting to make any kind of bread dough and it came out fantastic!  Like I said, my husband and a friend ate almost the entire batch in fifteen minutes.  Next time I will try adding cinnamon and raisins toward the end of kneading the dough!  Don't be afraid of making this dough without a bread maker it is very easy!

This recipe won great reviews in my house. Surprised since I am the only one "always" opting for the pretzels in the mall rather than something else. Easy, fast and best of all tasty.  I used bread flour and only 2 tbsp. brown sugar (as someone suggested). Came out great.  Also noticed that when some were left in the salt bath longer (20 sec.) they came out chewier than the rest.

Thanks for the recipe. My 5 year old helped make them and they were very easy. I did use agave nectar in place of the sugar.

We have never made pretzels at home and these were better then Aunt Annies (are favorite snack at the mall).  The only thing we did differently is used Sea Salt on them in the end and there were fantastic. We make them for are family movie nights now.

I had never made pretzels before, but had no problems with stickiness at all. They were fabulous! I had to make 4 batches in a row as it was during the weekend and we had drop-in visitors that kept devouring them! Thanks you for the recipe!

first time in my whole life I make pretzels, well, maybe there are even better recipes, but this one seems pretty good to me! the bread machine did pratically everything and my little daughter and me, we had all the fun, making ropes and entwining them to shape the dough. They were baked in no time, and it's been fun too! They were very good with rich soft cheese or Praga ham and pickles. I'm a fan from now on:-)

I made mine in my Kitchen Aid. I lowered the uncooked pretzels into the boiling water on a spatula so that they wouldn't get stuck to the bottom or be hard to get out. It worked perfectly. I brushed with egg-wash glaze and sprinkled with salt before sticking them in the oven. They are delicious! Very soft.

These were pretty good. Had an odd texture fromt the baking soda, but still good. Second and third times I tried it they didn't turn out that good. It was probably me though, good recipe.

These turned out pretty good despite a problem; they totally stuck to the paper towels I drained them on.  So I boiled them longer, about 30 sec, and plopped them right onto a greased cookie sheet.  I think next time I would knead in more flour, also, as they were very fluffy.  They were pretty good though, and I will try again.

I think this is the best Pretzel recipe on the site, super easy, and delicious.  These pretzels put the frozen store brand to shame, and can be made in about 15 minutes with a stand mixer and some good coordination and a preheated oven.  I want to try making with barley malt and increasing the soda bath time by 5 seconds, but WOW is all that I can say.

Yummy and super easy! This was a HIT with our kids. We followed the recipe and used the brown sugar as it states. We did brush with melted butter when we got them out of the oven instead of using water. Mmmmm!!

I was hesitant to try this recipe, figuring making soft pretzels MUST be hard.  But I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great!  My only complaint is that the salt didn't stick so well to the pretzels.  I'm trying another batch, and taking another reviewer's advice and doing butter and cinnamon sugar instead.  Great pretzel with lots of potential to spice it up!  Thanks!

Wonderful!  I even used whole wheat flour (white whole wheat - King Arthur), and the pretzels still turned out tasting quite like the ones you'd buy at a ball game!  Yay! The salt didn't stick well, but I wasn't using coarse salt, and I don't like lots of salt, anyways.  Excellent with mustard or marinara sauce.

This recipe was good.  I did throw all the ingredients in my bread machine, so it had a 1st rise.  I was surprised it didn't need to sit for a second rise.  Much easier to roll out than another recipe I have used.  After baking, I brushed with melted butter and then sprinkled salt on some and cinnamon and sugar on the others.  Next time I will follow Bobby Flay's suggestion and brush with an egg wash (1 egg and 1 Tbs water) and bake with the salt or cinnamon and sugar.  That made a crisper outside.  The taste was good.  Will make again.

Downright awesome!  Made them for the first time today, using the corn syrup instead of sugar like recommeded by others. They came out soft and chewy on the inside with a nice light crust on the outside.  I didn't have any coarse salt so I just used kosher instead, still tasted great.  Smelled amazing, too.  My children loved them!  Will definitely be using this recipe again!

So good!!! The only thing that I changed was putting them in melted butter right after taking them out of the oven, and then I sprinkled them with a little salt. They are as good as the pretzel place. My kids are thrilled!

These were so yummy!!! Only did a few minor things differently. I mixed the dough by hand to make sure it wouldn't come out too sticky. (5 minutes or so of kneading and 1 hour of letting it sit). And I used a cinnamon and sugar topping instead of salt (after brushing with melted margarine). SOOOO good !!! I had no problems with submerging them in the boiling water with baking soda. They stayed together very nicely. NOM NOM NOM

I also found the pretzels stuck to the paper towels as mentioned below and were a little too much more like rolls than pretzels. Someone else suggested more flour or longer cooking, so take that into consideration. I made smaller balls instead of 8 i ended up making 21 smaller pretzels. We also rolled some of them in melted butter and then cinnamon/sugar mixture. Overall a pretty simple and good recipe.

I have to tell you they taste so good especially with cheese but if you are in a hurry or do not want to make the shape of a pretzel then just make bite sized one they taste just as great even that better!!!!

These were so easy to make and I had no problems with anything. I did not alter the recipe at all. My 3 year old who does not eat as already ruined her dinner (like she would have ate it anyway) and ate three pretzels. There are fabulous as is!

It makes 8 but that is not enough when you take that first bite and are shocked to find that yes, they do taste just like the soft pretzels you can get at the mall. It then made me want to share with everyone so after making my first batch just hours ago I am making another but doubling it after dinner tonight. I gave them an egg wash on 6 of them. After baking I used spray butter to wet them and then sprinkled them with my course sea salt. My 4 yr old wasn't crazy about them so on the last 2 (that he made himself and germed up lol) we put cinnamon and sugar on them and hmm guess what?! His are now gone. Great recipe, thank you so much!

I followed the recipe exactly, still had to add extra flour after the bread machine mixed the dough because it was too sticky.  Even with that, after the dough had risen, it was still very very sticky.  I had a hard time getting it out of the bread machine tub.  Even so, the pretzels tasted good, especially brushed with butter and cinnamon and sugar.  I think next time, I will need to add even more flour to the dough, I only added about a spoonful, but it seems like I could almost have added up to another 1/4 cup and been ok.

How yummy!  This was the second time I used my new bread machine.  The first time I used a bread mix, this time I thought I'd try a recipe from scratch.  My friend and I made this today with her 3yr old and my 4 yr old.  We sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  What a hit!  The next time we make them, we will make them all into bite sized pieces.  Great recipe!

Good recipe.  Pretzels were nice and soft.  Recipe was very easy to make.  Even my 11 year old daughter assisted and really enjoyed making them.  I also took others' advise and used corn syrup.  We made salt, garlic and cinnamon & sugar ones.  It's a keeper.  Thanks.

I've made these a couple times and think they are great.  Fun to make and good to eat.  I add cinnamon and sugar on rather than salt.

I searched high and low for real pretzel flavor.  This is it.  Most pretzel recipes I've found taste too much like bread.  These taste like real pretzels.  I'm made this several times.  People love these.  I always get complements.  

I've made the dough with a bread machine and also with my Kitchen Aid mixer -- both with great results.  Follow Kitchen Aid's dough prep. instructions.  I doubled the recipe when I used the mixer.

These pretzels are so easy & yummy - I used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour, made 6 batches & took them to a Harvest Party, with some nacho cheese dip to dunk 'em in.  Everyone was shocked that they were homemade - they were so good! When I told my son I was thinking of leaving the leftovers for a big dinner the next day, he put on a face and said "I love these, I planned to finish them off myself!

This is fantastic!!  I did  use corn syrup instead of brown sugar and I made pretzel bites (that way the kids can't double dip).  I also dropped the bites into a shallow pan of water/baking soda.  Fished them out with a slotted spoon.  Sheer heaven.  So easy and so delicious.  Can't wait to make them for my friends.

Oh my, these were so yummy! We ate them straight out of the oven with butter and salt. It was my first time making pretzels, and they weren't the prettiest things ever, but that didn't matter because they were gone within minutes. YUMMY!!!

surprisingly, these tasted just like soft pretzels from the mall. I used melted butter and kosher salt on top. followed the recipe pretty much to a t but ran out of brown sugar so i used 2 tbsp brown and 1 tbsp white sugar.

These are amazing! I followed the advice of another reviewer and used corn syrup in place of the brown sugar. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. After boiling, I coated the tops with some melted butter and sprinkled generously with kosher salt. I made a homemade pizza sauce for dipping. YUM! Thanks for the GREAT recipe.
