This was one surprising recipe!  I would recommend adding a couple tablespoons of chopped raisins to the hummus after it's gone through the food processer.  Next time I'm going to stir in some chopped walnuts as well.  I used less pb and no oil in order to save a few calories.  I used plain old fashion rolled oats instead of instant.  The most important instruction would be to make ahead of time and chill well.  At room temperature it's still a little "beany", but refrigeration takes care of that and allows the flavors to meld.  We loved this as a dip for apple slices.

FANTASTIC!  You gotta give it a try- sounds weird, but it's surprisingly tasty.  Definitely chill, over night is best.  It's very thick, so you can add water if you prefer a smoother and thinner consistency.  I can't get over how healthy and clean this recipe is.  Protein, fiber, no added sugar- what else could you ask for!  Thank you soooo much for posting this!  It's a keeper

I used agave instead of maple syrup, and I used 2 cups of beans because I had cooked up the dry ones.  This sweet hummus is great with apples, as a dessert dip.  I will also shape some into balls, and roll in coconut to make a no bake cookie!   This really is sweet enough for the name of cookie dough hummus!  It's a great new hummus recipe!

Amazing!  I doubted this could actually taste like cookie dough but it really does!  And nice and easy...

Fairly healthy dip for an addition with apples, but not special enough for the party, but probably great for a regular snack.  I'd kick up the cinnamon and peanut butter for more taste.

Definitely one of my new favorite snacks. Tastes very "beany" by itself, but it's a perfect compliment to sweet apple slices. Used honey instead of maple syrup and coconut oil in place of canola.

Not very good. Kind of bland, and the flavours that ARE there, don't go very well together.

I scaled the recipe down to try it out, and used old-fashioned rolled oats.  My kidlet, who likes garbanzo beans, loved it.  Myself, I'm not a fan of the garbanzo, unless it's hummus or some kind of vegan meat.  I wasn't a fan of this either.  The garbanzos push through all the other ingredients and go "here I am!"  I averaged out the two votes for 3 stars.

Was not a fan of this hummus.... and rarely have I eaten a hummus I didn't like; it was disappointing to say the least.

this is just fabulous!!! I wish that I could give this 10 stars!                                                           I used 2 tablespoon of peanut butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla  and 2 teaspoons cinnamon. I also added some splenda.

I stir this into plain jogurt  and enjoy it for breakfast or as a very healthy  snack.                      
Children love it too!

I was thinking, yeah right...cookie dough from beans?  WOW!  Even my PICKY 7 year old ate it and liked it.  We changed it up a bit by adding mini chocolate chips and extra "real maple syrup".  Thanks Serafina for a great find!  :)

This is OK, but doesn't taste anything like cookie dough.  I added a tsp of brown sugar and molasses to try and get the strong bean taste out.  It's palatable on fruit but not by itself.

I searched for recipes with oatmeal & raisins and when I saw a recipe by someone named "Serafina" I thought, "how many Serafinas can there be?" and I had to check it out.. It was so funny to see my old high school pal suggesting an awesome recipe to me!! Thanks!! 
I, too, am a vegetarian ( and eat lots of hummus :) ) and love this unique idea & recipe for a sweet version of my favorite snack! Thanks!!!

This was fun to try; something different. I was really hoping my kids would love it as I like to give them variety in their lunch boxes. It was alright but probably not something they would be bragging to their friends about having; tho' the name alone might fool them :). We preferred it the most on a wrap with banana slices.

Me and my kiddos made this but left out the raisins, used sugar free syrup and added some sweetener (splenda/truvia) and the family really liked it!  My son likes it just plain and my daughter likes it with apples.  Thanks for the recipe, it really is delicious and nutritious!

I enjoyed this recipe very much. For someone with more of a sweet-tooth, it might not have a bold enough flavor, but I thought it was great. I think one element was missing though: salt. A tiny pinch of salt might help tie the flavors together and enhance what is there. Then again, I used dries pinto beans because I didn't have chickpeas on hand, so some rinsed, canned beans might be better in this case. Still, if I had any of my dark chocolate with sea salt left I would have chopped it up and stirred it in for some extra texture and taste.

Not really my cup of tea. Tried to spread it on a tortilla and top with bananas, but I could only do that a few times before I couldn't eat it any more.

I'm not entirely sure why I even tried this being that I don't like raw cookie dough, but it was pretty good for a "sweet" hummus.  My sister liked it a lot (she's a fan of cookie dough ice cream).  I don't think I'll make it again, but I would suggest it to someone who was interested in a more healthy, savory, sweet snack.
