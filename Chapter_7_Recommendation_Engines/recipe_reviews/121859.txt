I made 10 loaves of this recipe and gave as Christmas gifts.  I made 5 at a time - that's all the dough that fits in my Kitchenaid mixer.  It is better than an oil-based recipe that I used in the past.  The first batch stuck in the pans, so I greased and floured the next batch and they came out perfectly.  It also seemed to have a better end result if the dough reseted about 10 minutes before baking.

I used my own homemade organic applesauce and cut the sugar by half. I also used a teaspoon of homemade apple pie spice instead of the individual spices. This batter needed 1/4 cup more applesauce than what was asked for. I made muffins out of this recipe, I got 12 out of one recipe, not 16. 350* for twenty minutes and it was perfect. Really good muffin. Moist and chewy, just like I like them.

This was excellent!  I left out the raisins and nuts so my toddlers would at least try it, and they loved it.  Will make this again for sure!

I made this applesauce bread but I doubled the recipe then put the bread in a bundt pan, This recipe is the easiest to put together and wow it turned out great, i used a combination of pears and applesauce from our pear tree that I cooked and ground, and oh my goodness this one is a winner for sure, Iwill most certainly make it again,

I love this recipe! And it's healthy. I actually added a graded, large apple and did not use the raisins or nuts. It's a fabulous snack.

Wow!!! This was sooo good! It came out moist and flavorful - I'll definitely make it again; I made a few changes - I didn't bake it for as long, I used a little less nutmeg, a full teaspoon of cinnamon, added vanilla extract, and also reduced the margarine to 3 tbs but used slightly more applesauce.  Well I guess I revamped it a little but that was really just according to taste... Thank you so much.

So moist and the spices really help to compliment this loaf of sweet bread.I had some applesauce to use up and made this tasty bread and also the applesauce bbq sauce recipe on this site. Thanks for a unique recipe!

Too sweet! I doubled this recipe using lovely pink crabapple sauce and a dollop of homemade apple butter just to make the specified amount..maybe that didn't help matters? I also reduced the butter as suggested by others. I was very pleased with the taste and texture (nice and fluffy), but the sweetness was overpowering. Even if I don't have to use apple butter next time I will halve the sugar. Otherwise a delightful bread, (or muffins as I tried) and oh so pretty pink!
I baked mine at 325F.

Very tasty, moist bread. I love the nuts. I made several batches and reduced the butter to 3T.  It worked perfectly.  My applesauce was homemade and very chunky.  All the better for the bread.  Wrap it up quickly, or it will be gone!

I doubled the recipe and made it with homemade granny smith applesauce.  It made 6 mini loaves (baked for 35 mins) and is delicious.  I would not change a thing and will make them a regular treat.  I sprayed the pans with the usual baking spray (the one that contains flour) and they came out perfectly.

I have used this recipe countless times over the last 2 yrs and ALWAYS get compliments and is always the 1st to get devoured! I've substituteda few tsp. (or to taste) of pumpkin pie seasoning for the nutmeg and cloves and sometimes to craisins instead of raisins, sometimes pecans instead of walnuts. Whatever I have at the time. You can adapt it so many ways!

The kids LOVED this -  except they wouldn't let me put raisins or nuts in it.  Demolished the loaf for breakfast.  Have also made with Pear Butter instead of applesauce because I have LOTS from our pear trees and the kids loved that too.

Delicious! I really enjoyed this recipe! My family loved it! It is a very moist bread which is something that I really liked. It is a little bit sweet but you can just add a little bit less sugar. That makes it less sweet.  I frosted this bread with cream cheese frosting and I thought it was way to sweet with frosting but my family liked it a lot with frosting. I guess it depends on how much you like sweets. :)

This is so easy to make.  What a moist, delicious bread.  I follow the recipe with no changes.  I used homemade applesauce.  Definetly a favorite at our house.  Wonderful for breakfast with a cup of coffee.  The raisins plump up nicely due to the applesauce.

This bread was a BIG hit for Mother's Day. The only thing I will do differently next time is to grease & flour the bread pans. Other than some sticking to the pans, it was awesome!

Found this recipe to be quite good & moist. I wanted to lower the calories and fat content, so I made changes, doubled the recipe first. I used half sugar:half twin sugar substitute, half a cup of butter instead of 2/3, used 1 tsp. more cinnamon and 1.5 tsp of vanilla extract, and half the amount of raisins and no nuts. Almost forgot I used a cup of whole wheat flour to up the fiber content.

Good bread though not spectacular.  I soaked my raisins in hot water for a bit, which makes them plump up.  I think I was hoping the bread's spices would make it zing more.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

Like many others I omitted the clove because I didn't have it,this would be nice with just 1/8 tsp of clove. This loaf was very moist, I doubled the recipe, used a 3:1 of wheat to white flour,used 3:1 ratio of brown to white sugar, doubled the cinnamon and replaced 3/4 of the raisins with chopped Macintosh apple. The apple I think added some moisture but i also used smart balance spread instead of butter which added water so next time I will cut the butter spread in half. Overall this loaf offers a lot of delicious flavor, no toasting or butter required.

Just made this because I had leftover applesauce and hungry toddlers... it was fantastic!  I chopped up the raisins, omitted nuts, and added chocolate chips.  Baked as muffins, they came out great!  (Muffins took about 30 minutes to cook thoroughly at 325 convection.)  We'll be having these for breakfast this week!  Thanks so much, this one is a keeper.

We have been using this recipe for years and it always turns out moist and yummy.  It's more of a dessert for us than a bread. I  leave out the raisins and nuts.  Today, we made muffins and that reduced the bake time down to 20 mins.  Yummy breakfast food !

LOVE it! Used Canola oil, rather than butter, 2 Tbsp  ground flax, to replace equal amount of flour, and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp. Used 2/3 cup brown sugar. Super moist! Glass pan, 325 for 50 minutes. Sprinkled powdered sugar on top.

3.5 stars for us.  It took a little longer to cook and it didn't rise nice.  I used the same baking powder and soda in a muffin recipe that same day and they rose fine, so I know it wasn't that.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some applesauce I had canned, but for a quick bread I would probably make the Maine pumpkin bread from this site instead.

This bread is a HUGE hit with my family and friends.  I double or triple the batch every time now because one loaf is never enough.  I use half whole wheat flour and agave nectar instead of sugar.  Also, I like using frozen blueberries instead of raisins because they are so juicy.  But my husband likes the sweetness of the raisins.  So lately I've been doing half and half and we both like that best.  Great recipe!

Very good bread.  I love baking 'non-yeast' breads through the fall and this one will stay on my good list.  I did add a left-over apple chopped up & it added a nice texture.  It went over really well with my girls kindergarten class.  I did omit the raisins and walnuts since I'm not a big fan.  It was very moist and kept well in the fridge.

I have made this bread twice in one week and everybody loves it. It's more like a cake, very healthy and moist. I tweak it a little bit, taking advised from other reviews.   I used 3 Tablespoons of butter and 1/3 cup of sugar. I used unsweetened homemade applesauce from mutsu apples (they are sweet and very juicy). I think if you use sweet apples you have to reduce the sugar amount. Maybe this recipe is for applesauce made with granny smith or another tart apple.   The first time I used 1/2 cup of sugar and still was sweet, this time was just perfect.  I really recommend you to try this recipe. This is a keeper!

This bread is great and so easy!  I have three little ones at home sick today and this is the first thing that they wanted and stayed down.  Plus it is delicious.  Made with 3/4 wheat flour 3/4 cup white and only used cinnamon. Super yummy!

Fantastic and so easy,  I had a lot of pear sauce left over from last year and needed to use it before this years start to ripen- it was great with pear sauce.

Delicious! Very flavourful and nice and moist. I only altered one thing, adding a 1/4C of dried cranberries as well as a 1/4C raisins(I didn't have enough raisins on hand for the full 1/2C). This is a keeper!

This recipe makes great muffins for both adults and kids! I made these according to the recipe except I did not add the nuts. These then baked for 20 minutes and made about 2 dozen muffins.  I'll have to make these again!
