Traditionally, bamboo shoots are not used in korean cooking. I advice subsititing the bamboo shoots for shitake mushrooms. Also, I would add yellow onions in addition to the green onions and more garlic. We Koreans incorporate a lot of garlic in our cooking. I do not usually add nappa cabbage to my version, but it is nice to add for the additional color.

this is not the correct way to make the original recipe. instead of napa cabbage and bamboo shoots try fresh(boiled) or frozen spinach drained with a little sesame oil on it... and adivce is to slighty sautee the veges before adding them to the noodles.. and it looks prettier if the carrots are cut into veritcal pieces.. and sauteed onions with this dish wouldnt be bad.. lol personally i love it the way my momma makes it ^^~

I work in a Korean run restaurant and every once in a while, my bosses mom makes Chap Chae. It's my most favourite Korean dish. This is a very good recipe, the only thing I changed was I used sweet potato noodles instead of the cellophane noodles.

Tastes almost exactly like my favorite Korean place's chap chae.  I did not soak the noodles in warm water and instead boiled them for 5 minutes, like the directions on the noodles indicated, before draining them and setting aside for cooking.

I did not add bamboo shoots or salt but I did add mushrooms.  I plan on adding some red bell peppers and maybe onions next time.  It ended up tasty and was quick and easy to make.  Also tasted a lot better than chap chae recipes I've had from actual Korean cookbooks.  Finally, I think that this recipe is more like 2 servings.

This was very good.  I used regular shredded cabbage instead of the napa and added a little bit more sugar.  I also added some hot sauce toward the end of cooking and it really added a lot to the dish.  I found that the noodles were a little too long and it made it hard to combine it with the meat and vegetables, so I cut them into smaller pieces and it worked wonderfully.  Very easy and tasty!

Having spent time in Korea and a frequent visitor to the local Korean restaurant, I found this recipe to be very authentic...and not too hard to make! We doubled the recipe for a family of 4 though. Don't forget to make/buy the sidedish of kimchi.

Chap chae is one of my favorite Korean dishes... this is different than the version I'm used to but still very good. My friend Yeonsoon used to make this for parties when we were in college. Her version was made without meat and contained more sesame seeds and sesame oil. Thanks for a nice variation.

I cooked this for my Korean exchange student's birthday.  She loved it.  I made a few changes.  I substituted the cellophane noodles for some noodles we got at the Asian store. They were long, clear noodles made from potato starch. (She said those were the right kind to use.)And, I added more soy sauce at her request.  She also said she'd never seen the bamboo shoots in that recipe before.  It came out very tasty and my whole family liked it - even my picky 1 1/2 year old loved eating the sticky noodles.

If you want to cook Korean food, at least know what goes in it. 
You dont put bamboo shoots into chap chae. You dont put napa cabbage either. This recipe is also missing mushrooms. The authentic dish calls for dried mushrooms which are rehydrated in water prior to cooking. 
Oh and this is suppose to be made with pork, NOT beef. 
And for those reviews that say not to use cellophane noodles because of the bland taste, its NOT chapchae if its made with anything else!
Similar to people saying that taco bell seasonings and such isnt mexican food, this is NOwhere close to korean food

I know there were some negative comments for this recipe, but from my experience, there is no wrong or right way for recipes...I have many Korean friends who make this quite differently-depending on what part of Korea they are from. All of their recipes are good and so is yours! Thank You Chris, for such a great recipe!

i did do a little changing but it came out wonderful! I did not put cabbage or bamboo shoots. I added shitake mushrooms and sauteed the vegetables first like someone else had recommended.

I'm not much of a meat eater so I substituted pressed tofu, cut into strips, for the beef. Because the tofu absorbs liquid, I had to make twice the amount of marinade. I also substituted mushrooms for the bamboo shoots (not a fan) and rice noodles for the cellophane since that's all my grocery store carried.  I've never had Korean food before so I can't vouch for this recipe's authenticity, but it was a tasty alternative to the stirfry dishes I normally make. Will make again.

This has quickly become a favorite in our household.  We use rice noodles, julienned carrots, cabbage, broccoli, and whatever other veggies we have on hand.

This was very tasty.  The sesame seed oil makes it.  I used cooked brown rice linguini noodles in place of the cellophane noodles and it turned out great.

This recipe as written is okay. Using only the amount of soy sauce called for makes it pretty bland. I added fish sauce and teriyaki sauce, and I'll still probably have to doctor the leftovers.

This sounded  like it would be really good, but we just couldn't get past the pasty texture of the noodles.  Maybe I'll try it with whole wheat linguini if I try this again.

I don't know what traditional Chap Chee is "supposed" to taste like, but this recipe is FANTASTIC!  I loved it and couldn't get enough.  Sadly, the kids (ages 6 and under) were less than impressed.   However, this is a dish I will make again and enjoy with the hubs! Thanks for a new favorite! Yum!

Good recipe - but do not do what I did and use regular soy sauce. Use the low salt variety. I marinated the meat for 1 1/2 hours thinking the soy sauce would tenderize it that much more, but ended with a dish so salty it was almost unedible. So besides that change, it is a very fast dish that you could do variations on quite easily. I do think next time I'll add fresh ginger and red chile sauce for heat.

This dish has such great flavor! I used bok choy instead of napa cabbage, and I used a 10 ounce package of frozen chopped spinach instead of the fresh. I didn't add any additional salt because of all the soy sauce, and I am glad I didn't. I couldn't find cellophane noodles, so I used rice noodles instead (the kind you would use for pho or pad thai). I didn't have any problems with my noodles sticking together once I mixed them with the other ingredients. I have never had traditional Chap Chee Noodles before, but this recipe turned out great for me.

Yummy!  A quick and easy noodle recipe.  I'm not very familiar with Korean cuisine, so I can't comment on the authenticity, but this was quite delicious!

This was a good starting place for me, and I appreciate the inspiration.  To start with, I modified to fit our budget and family size - i used 1lb ground meat instead of the steak, and 8oz rice noodles. After it was all cooked and together, I had to modify further to get some flavor.  I added cayenne, garlic powder, soy sauce, and aji miran.  After that it was really good and we ate it all.

According to other raters, this may not be genuine Korean food, but it was good. I used:
onion powder (I was out of onion), snap peas, cabbage, bean sprouts, korean noodle, dash of seasoned rice vinegar, and 1ts Sri Racha hot sauce.

Say what ya want, I thought this was fabulous as did the rest of my family. I will definitely be making ths again!

Very Good! I doubled the quantities though as there didn't seem enough for four. I replaced with normal cabbage and also added brocolli and green beans. It tasted excellent. A way to stop the noodles congealing is to rinse them in cold water before adding to the pan to loosen them up. I will try this recipe again but I will try it with more substantial egg noodles next time. Thanks for posting it up!

My husband and I loved it! This is the first five star rating I've ever given! The only change I made was to leave out the cabbage so that I could serve it with a Napa cabbage salad.

I'm rating this on the sauce because I didn't use the meat or the specific vegetables and I used some egg noodles instead. I used a premade bag of vegetables with pea pods, water chestnuts, peppers and other misc. stir fry vegetables that worked well. The only thing I changed about the sauce was doing brown sugar instead of white, and I added a tsp. of roasted red chili paste for good measure. The sauce was simple and delicious. I look forward to trying it with meat and more authentic noodles and veggies. Oh and skip the additional salt-- you don't need it.

this recipe was quite a let down. i was expecting something richer in taste. the noodle was bland it didnt taste like anything. i had to add extra salt and soy sauce. however, the marinated beef tasted good. perhaps more soy sauce to the noodles?

This was good, but not 5-star good.  I have no idea what this is "supposed to" taste like.  I used chicken instead of beef because that is what I had to use up.  I felt that maybe there were too many noodles.  I may try again with beef and cutting down on the noodles.

We left the noodles out because my husband does low carb.  This was a GREAT dish, it was delicious, pretty and easy to make, my husband wanted to rate it a 10!  I'm sure I'll be making this monthly.

Thanks so much for such a fabulous recipe!!!

This was terrific! I had to make some changes, because I did not have bamboo shoots, spinach and cabbage at hand. I used broccoli, red and yellow bellpepper and babycorn instead. Kind of a difference, but it  worked. Next time I will try the spinach-cabbage-bamboo-combination because I think it is going to be more special. The  baby-corn I'll use anyway because my husband likes them so much. I had to add a little soy sauce to taste, but this of course depends on the kind you are using.

This was pretty good. I did add a teaspoon more soy sauce to the noodle mixture, as well as 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil to the noodle mixture. I also added a few more veggies, such as 1/2 chopped yellow onion, a can of stir fry mix veggies, and substituted shredded coleslaw cabbage for the napa/spinach. I also cooked a side of filipino lumpia to go with the recipe. Will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe!!!

Good recipie 
 I've made this a couple times. I'm no fan of canned bamboo shoots so I used mushrooms instead, broccoli would be good or asparagus. Didn't have cellophane noodles on hand and that was good with thejapanese noodles.

I found the cellophane noodles at Big Lots and so I needed a recipe that called for them and found this little gem (I like to experiment with different ingredients and styles of cooking). It literally took (including chopping) 30 minutes to put together {after letting the meat marinade all day}. I scaled the recipe to work for 1 lb. of steak, but used only about 7 oz of noodles. After soaking the noodles in warm water for 5 minutes I drained them and rinsed in cold water then cut them up really well with my kitchen shears. After reading the reviews I made the following changes: subbed a packaged coleslaw mix (16 oz) for the Napa cabbage and spinach, omitted the salt, subbed canned sliced mushrooms for bamboo shoots (it's what my store had), added 16 oz frozen thawed broccoli cuts and about 1 cup frozen thawed green beans, and b/c some of the comments were that this dish turned out a little bland I added 2 T oyster sauce and 1 tsp. chili sauce with garlic (BTW I decreased the pepper to 1/2 tsp. for the sauce, don't forget that I scaled the recipe for 1 lb. of meat). Turned out great; served with crunchy chow mein noodles and egg rolls. The flavor was both sweet and slightly spicy. I could only give 4* b/c my sister isn't fond at all of anything even remotely spicy; I give it 6*!!! Hopefully I'll be able to find these noodles again b/c I would definitely make this again then:)

This is a very tasty Korean style dish.  I went down to our local Asian market and bought sweet potato noodles to use with this recipe because I like the texture better, otherwise I made it exactly as written.  The beef was tender and flavorful, the vegetables crisp and the sauce was just right--not too salty and not too sweet.

I've made this now about 5 times, and have incorporate the suggestions from reviewers about more authentic ingredients (like shiitakes instead of bamboo shoots). The only thing I've never been able to get my hands on is the potato noodles, but I'm not giving up. Regardless, my husband and I both think this is a fantastic meal!

This is a great recipe! I'd probably make a few changes to adjust to my taste. My only problem was that the beef turned out quite gummy, but the flavor of the dish itself was very good. I'd keep the recipe cutting out the meat, but leaving everything else as is.

I would double the marinade next time, and double the final sauce that is cooked with the veggies.  I also didn't like the meat being cooked the entire time with the veggies, and will cook first, remove and then add later when all the veggies are done.  I would give 4.5 stars.

Really great- I've never had the traditional version, but this really is a great recipe. I used rice noodles because that's what we had in the cupboard. I also added some broccoli and used bok choy instead of cabbage. I did double the marinade and the sauce. Everything had a really great, mild flavor- perfect for us because of our small children. My husband added some red pepper flakes to his, but he said it was really just fine without them as well. Definitely a keeper- goes together in a flash once you have all the veggies prepped.

Fabulous!  Marinade was so good, the whole dish had excellent flavor.  I couldn't find cellophane noodles so just served over rice and omitted spinach.  I also added more steak and doubled the marinade.  Thanks so much!

Great flavor. I've made this several times and use regular spaghetti noodles instead since I have never been successful with the asian noodles before and my husband doesn't like them anyways.

Easy, quick and tasty!  I left out the green onions, salt and noodles, added some dried red pepper for a little zing and ate this over rice.  Used chicken instead of the beef.  Use bagged coleslaw mix and it doesn't get any easier than this!

this is authentic and was glad to find the recipe.  add any colourful vegetables like carrots and peppers that can be julienned.  that looks the best when displayed on a large platter.

I loved this recipe. A girl at work is having a baby and I sent this dish home for her so that she could rest and not have to cook. It almost didn't leave the nurses lounge with everyone taking just a taste. I added mushrooms, and a bit of white sweet onion. In my own dish I added a bit of franks red hot sauce. Yummy

Used the broad cellophane/glass noodles. Also, I added water chestnuts that needed to be used. In the beef marinade, I used regular soy sauce but used sweet soy sauce for the 2nd part of the recipe. Excellent dinner! Served with Asian Cucumber Salad and Pickled Daikon Radish and Carrot.

We don't like bamboo shoots so we substituted sliced celery. We also used angel hair pasta instead of cellophane noodles. Everything else was the same. My whole family loved this. We will be making it again for sure.

This is pretty good, but it could use a little more more flavor.  I used double the garlic, but it could possibly use more.  Next time I will probably sub fish sauce for soy sauce and add mushrooms as well.  Overall, I will definitely making this many more times.

As written, this recipe is bland. It's a good starting-off point to tweak it to your own tastes. I ended up adding more soy sauce, more garlic, rice vinegar, green onions, cilantro, red pepper flakes, and Sriracha.

This was OK.  We thought the sesame oil was a little overpowering.  We also added mushrooms.  Not my favorite but not all bad.

This was so good!  I double the recipe due to other reviews. I did not find cello. noodles so used rice noodle which worked well.  I added broccoli, (good choice) & used reg. cabbage.  Hubby thought it was a bit fry so I added some chicken broth that I had & it helped.  Marinade was really good!  Fairly quick too!

This was fantastic, even my picky 8 year old son ate it.  I added broccoli, red pepper, and mushrooms instead of carrots, bamboo shoots and spinach.  The flavor was great.  I did have the problem with the noodles sticking together.  It seems like once you put them in the wok they like to clump together.......still taste good just not as pretty I guess.  
Thanks for the recipe I know we will be making this again at our house!

Made this tonight for supper and it was really easy to make and tasted great:)  I did not know what cellophane noodles were so I used the same noodles that you make pancit with.  This is great!  My picky husband even ate it:)  Thanks for sharing:)

great recipe! I followed others' advice and used cilantro and dried red pepper flakes which gave a nice flavor. I also used japanese soba noodles instead of cellophane and it was delicious. Ideal for a weeknight meal. I will defnitely make this again.

We loved this! I marinaded the meat in the soy/sesame/garlic etc overnight, and it was soooo flavorsome! I doubled up on the napa cabbage because I have really gone off spinach recently, and I omitted the sugar because I felt it wasn't needed. It was really tasty! Thanks, Chris J!

I thought this was great.  Has a nice warm flavor, and the marinade is excellent.  I did make a few changes, mainly for the budget conscious.  I used rice noodles and regular red cabbage.  Also ommitted sesame seeds.  Otherwise, I followed the exact recipe (doubled).  Everyone liked it and I plan to make again.

I love this recipe! I double it whenever I make it.  It is just fine as is but I add more vegetables depending on what I have on hand. I've added broccoli, mushrooms, and baby corn cobs. I even made it with chicken before. It always taste great! Thanks for the tasty recipe! This is a keeper.

The sauce is what makes Chap Chee sooooo good. That being said, the next time I make this, I'm going to double or triple the amounts for the sauce. Everything else is right on.

I have to say that I was looking for a recipe that I could use bean threads  and broccoli slaw.  I changed a lot! I boiled the bean threads 5.29oz package with broccoli slaw 16oz package for 5 mins. I sautéed onions, garlic 2tbl and sesame seeds in 3 tbls sesame oil  , 2 tbls sugar , 2tbls soy sauce and 2 tbls amino acids (healthier than soy). Then,  I added in the cooked drained noodles and slaw. I stirred over low heat for 4 minutes added some broth to keep from drying out.  I served with grilled chicken. My family loved it even though it is not a true Korean dish. It was fast because I didn't have to clean and chop veggies!

I like bean thread noodle and this dish was good with the beef and vegetables. I did add hoisin sauce because I didn't think soy sauce alone would be enough.

Tasted great! I omitted the bamboo shoots and the cabbage since I didn't have any on hand. Plus I don't think I've had either on the dishes I've ordered from a Korean restaurant. I also used 6 oz of Korean starch noodle (pre-boiled) instead of bean threads and added half a red bell pepper for color. Finally I added shiitake mushrooms and ear mushrooms.
