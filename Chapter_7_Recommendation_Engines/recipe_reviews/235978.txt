Delicious!    I never had butternut soup before so I really wasn't sure what to expect.    Made it per the recipe the first time,  but the 2nd time, instead of broth, I used apple cider to make it more apple-y.   Love it both ways.

It was really tasty. I added a little to much cinnamon, next time i make it i will dial that back just a touch and it will be absolutely delicious.

This recipe for squash soup is the tastiest and easiest. I have tried many recipes and this is by far the best. I received many compliments from people who say this is better than restaurant soup. Another good thing about this soup is that it is great for vegetarians and vegans. Five stars all the way with this recipe. Save this recipe and toss the others.

This tastes exactly like Panera's Bread autumn soup! The other ones that add pumpkin, only tastes like pumpkin soup. This is the one you need to try to enjoy their soup at home.

This recipe has wonderful flavor as specified.  I made it according to the instructions, but used more squash, as I defrosted and used 6 cups that I had in the freezer.  It was quite thick and I thinned it with cream as needed to make it more like a soup than a stew---I'm sure that upped the calories, but the flavor was rich and terrific!

I substituted one cup of apple juice for the broth and I think it made the soup too sweet. Next time I'll follow the recipe because the apple and almond milk are sweet enough. It was still good, but tasted more like applesauce than squash.

Really a great soup!   Eight servings is really probably four unless each is a small cup of soup.  I would double the recipe next time so there are leftovers.  This is definitely a keeper!
