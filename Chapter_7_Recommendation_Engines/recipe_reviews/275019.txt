I WILL TOTALLY MAKING THIS AGAIN!!  Loved it, made it twice. Once without any changes except for spraying the liners which helps keep the muffins from falling apartment and sticking to the liner. And again with oil instead of butter and tossed the berries in a tablespoon of flour to help keep the muffins from being too wet which encourages spoiling, but they won't stay around long enough to.
