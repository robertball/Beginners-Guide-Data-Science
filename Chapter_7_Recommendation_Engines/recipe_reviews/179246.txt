Ehh....3 stars. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestions, and seasoned the chicken, dipped it in the egg whites, then Rice Krispies. The taste of the Rice Krispies were really strong. it's not a bad recipe, but its nothing without dipping sauce. I most likely will never make this again, it was a pain.

These taste wonderful! Our family substituted olive oil for the butter. We will be eating this one again.

I thought this recipe was good!  I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and coated the chicken with seasoning first, egg second, and rice krispies a little crunched up last.  It turned out great!  They were crunchy, tasty, and the coating did not fall off.  I think the coating falling off might be due to the chicken being too wet before putting it in the egg.  I would make this recipe again!!

This recipe did not work for me. I found the season/cereal mixture did not stick to the meat well. The seasons separated from the mixture and did not coat the chicken. I tried leaving the cereal whole and crushing the cereal which made no difference. When baking it, the coating was mushy and peeled off when flipping. It never seemed to get golden and crispy. I would suggest seasoning chicken 1st and then coat w/ cereal. Prefer Planet Hollywood's captain crunch chicken recipe better.

Made it like the recipe said and was not very impressed. It lacked flavor and taste. My kids pushed it away!
