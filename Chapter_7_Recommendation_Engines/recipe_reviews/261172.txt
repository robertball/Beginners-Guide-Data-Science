The recipe is unclear about when and how you deal with the cream cheese filling : do you cook it after you fill the cake up with it or put in the fridge to set ? There seems to be a step missing. It looks cooked in the photo ???

Hmm.  Not a fan. The cream cheese part, being on the top, got overdone before the middle of the cake with done.  The flavors were good though.  I think, perhaps, a person should make a "tunnel" in the middle of the cake and put the cream cheese there.

Excellent.   Followed the recipe and directions as listed and it turned out perfect.   Step 5, the directions for the cream cheese filling should be moved up to step 2, but it was obvious.   The cake is heavy and dense and super tasty.   It is soft and moist and very chocolatey.   Great for show and flavor.

The recipe is truly confusing.  Step 2 says filling to follow then Step 5 tells you how to mix it.  No mention of cookies or the chips.  Someone needs to reconfigure this recipe then resubmit
