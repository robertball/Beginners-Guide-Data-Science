zero stars-  I should have read the first review before trying this recipe. It was indeed AWFUL-  the sauce has way too much ketchup in it and I wasted a lot of expensive ingredients.

first of all, ketchup can be used for thai food--i learned to make pad thai WITH KETCHUP from my host family in thailand.  this recipe though would be better if you substituted sweet chili sauce for half the ketchup.  also try using oyster sauce instead of fish sauce.  it wasn't a horrible recipe, just needed to be fixed up a bit.

I tried this recipe and found it to be pretty decent. I added heat with lots of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce plus added garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, salt, as well as some water chestnuts. Why chestnuts? Just cos I love 'em. Recipe is basic- just like it reads- and we found it worth adding to our recipe box to use again.

I also wish I had read the reviews before trying this. Even with significant modifications (way less ketchup, etc.) it was STILL bad.

Strange version with funky taste. The curry (?), that didn't help. Bell pepper was a weird addition as well, especially that much. Sometimes I add 1 small Thai red pepper. Needs tamarind and fish sauce - both critical ingredients. Lime and cilantro to garnish.

Will not do this one again. True pad thai does not have peanut butter in the sauce, but I thought it might turn it into a tangy peanut sauce like you get for dipping at some oriental restaurants. I was wrong.

I made this and followed the recipe (no substitutions), we disliked it.  The sauce was too tomato-y and I also felt like the sauce to meat ratio was too high.
