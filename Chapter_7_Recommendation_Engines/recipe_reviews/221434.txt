Thanks for an authentic recipe, and for not altering it; otherwise it would not be authentic; that's the problem with most "Mexican" recipes; well-meaning souls try to dumb it down for Americans, and lose the authentic flavor. Very good!!

This recipe was great... Everyone loved it! It wasn't very spicy so I will add more jalapenos next time for a little more kick!

Well i hate to say it but I had to use a Enchilada verde sauce from a can cause it is way, way faster. I fried the corn tortillas and then dipped them in the verde sauce then followed the recipe the rest of the way. Our 2yr old loved them so much he asked for a second enchilada. I served this with a side of black beans and lime wedge. Pretty delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe, these recipes help me to improvise. Took me just 35 minutes to make the whole meal.

I am so excited with this recipe!  I made it as written and it is awesome!  We have a wonderful Mexican Restaurant in town and I always order the Enchiladas Verdes, and tonight these were just as great as theirs.   Thank you for posting this recipe!

I went to a mexican market last night to make this on Saturday, because you just can't beat fresh cheese, and corn tortillas just created, pressed, and still warm in the bag when you pick them up... I also have to give you total props for not modifying the recipe, if the recipe is too spicy, mooooove along! lol
