This turned out okay, nothing special. I would have liked a stronger chocolate flavor. I gave it a shot because it had 5 stars, but then I realized the submitter of the recipe gives herself 5 stars on all her recipes. Very deceptive.

One of my favorite whip topping recipes. Light and Fluffy and flavorful. Easy as 1-2-3 ;-) This was created on my 6th wedding anniversary for my husband and it's now a staple for all things chocolate topped. And I placed in the 11th spot for Nestl√©'s National Recipe competition for using their product and Goober's peanuts in a parfait.

this came out as a nice lightly chocolate flavored whip cream. if you are looking for a rich chocolate flavor you need to keep looking but it was still good :)

YUM!  Light and fluffy chocolate whip cream!  My only change was to drizzle with chocolate syrup, after all, I am a chocoholic!  This is five stars in my book!  Thanks for sharing your recipe mis7up!  I can always count on you for a good one!
