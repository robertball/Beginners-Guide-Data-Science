This recipe turned out very well, with a few changes. I used twice the amount of mushrooms (Crimini) and sauteed with 6 cloves of garlic.  I sauteed the chicken only with salt and pepper. Deglazed the pan with 1 cup white wine and 1/3 cup chicken broth. Added the mushrooms and garlic back into the pan with 1 tsp. dried Rosemary, parsley, and a touch each of thyme and red chili flakes.I used grape tomatoes, and no olives. This dish was great served over pasta. Thanks, senorita!

I changed this recipe a bit so hopefully no one will accuse me that I made it a completely different recipe, but I felt that it may make it better.  I dipped the thigs in flower then egg then breadcrumbs as many other recipes call for and then followed as specified. I cooked this in wine/ vermouth mixture.  Tend to use vermouth more than traditional white wine b/c it has a crispier flavor.  The breadcrumbs made it absorb the liquid quickly so unfortunately I kept having to add more wine and was required flip chicken over a lot so it would not stick.  However, after doing so I thought it came out great and BF liked it as well so I was happy.  The wine taste was really nice not over bearing.  I used pitted olives and overall I didn't have any complaints, the flavors of the olives, mushrooms, wine, and tomatos really did make this worth while and would definitely try this combination of flavors again.

I am giving this a five even though I changed it a bit.    I followed it  using bone in chk. theighs, but added Italain sausage. I left out red pepper since fiance doesn't like it and used dried Italian seasoning. (Even though I prefer using fresh) I added about 1/4 more wine.  I used a $3 bottle of Mathew Fox, which came out great.  I was in the mood for mashed potatoes so I reduced the sauce at the end with corn starch and water. (If you do this, plan to increase the sauce to ab. triple) I used the gravey to cover the chicken and sausage and of course mashed potatoes. I had no tomatoes and do not like olives so I left them out. Anyhow,  it had such a wonderful flavor.  Now I can make two diiferent meals, one with comforting  gravey and one with an elegant wine sauce over pasta.  I sugest yo

I was worried I was going to have a disaster on my hands!  My Fricassee was simmering on the stove (smelling fantastic, by the way!) when the phone rang.  Needed to tend to an emergency.  I put the "not quite cooked" chicken in the refrigerator and off I went.  Didn't return until well after midnight.  Not in the mood to cook at that hour.  Well, last night (sans emergencies) I put the dish back on the stove, brought it to a simmer, added the tomatoes and olives, and cooked it about 10 minutes more.  It was perfect!  Delicious!  Served it over egg noodles.  The only thing I did different was to add a few more mushrooms.  Gracias, Senorita!

This was delicious!!!  Even the leftovers were great!  Some slight changes due to what I had on hand.  I used bone in, skin off thighs, dried rosemary (1 TBL), no red pepper (little kids) and a regular chopped tomato.   I cannot wait to make this again!

Excellent recipe. I have made it twice. My advice is to use a decent bottle of wine, $8-$12, it is a huge factor in the overall flavor of the dish. My favorite has been Manta, a Chilean sauvignon blanc. There should be very little liquid left if this is prepared correctly. Cheers.

Excellent dish!!! We made this minus the olives and used dried rosemary, all else remained consistant with instructions.  My wife is not a fan of dark meat, but absolutely loved this dish.  We will definitely make this again!!!!

SUPER!  I used boneless thighs. I did'nt have fresh rosemary, so used dried and sprinkled generously over chicken before browning. My husband said he'd "owe me" for such a great meal. I'll be thinking and thanking you tonight Senorita Pupnstuff!!!!! Leah

This was good. I didn't have the tomatoes or olives on hand, so I didn't use them.  The only other problem that I had was the dish was very salty.  I will use again, but tinker with it a bit.  Thanks for the post.

As others, I modified the original recipe. Since I was using canned mushrooms I browned the thighs first in a big cast iron skillet, set aside, and added garilc and fresh rosemary, sage, and basil to the skillet. Over a low fire of course so as not to burn the garlic. I deglased the pan with the wine to get all those yummy bits up and into the sauce, then added the mushrooms, liquid and all. Tossed in a can of diced tomatoes, left out the olives...yuck...covered and simmered as directed. 
Served over brown rice. 
The hubby asked me to make it again, so it must be good.
The only addition I would make is to be sure you have a splatter screen to protect you from all the oil splatters when browning the chicken. (Aids in cleaning the stove too.)

Followed the directions to a "t" as a barometer for this first try. Overall the flavor was outstanding. However with just a baguette I felt it was lacking. I will review the "reviews" to see what others might have used to bolster this recipe and give it more substance. Will definitely do this one again.

We loved this recipe!  The chicken just fell apart, it was so tender.  I used chopped Kalamata olives and extra mushrooms (baby bellas) in the chicken, and served it over penne that had been sauteed with fresh basil, garlic, onion, olive oil (naturally), more olives and some artichoke hearts.  I threw some freshly grated parmesan on top, and it was amazing!

Delicious - but as usual, I made multiple changes. First, I took the skin off of the thighs, I love chicken thighs, it's the tastiest part of the chicken (people who are all "ewww" and only eat white meat, you don't know what you are missing), but if you are cooking them with sauce in my opinion it just makes a grease slick in the sauce which is yuck.  Second, I coarsley choppped the garlic instead of halving it. Third, I minced half an onion and threw it in with the mushrooms. Fourth, I added an entire cup of liquid but did 1/2 wine, 1/2 chicken broth. Fifth, I added a bay leaf. Sixth, I let it simmer uncovered at the end for 15 min to let the sauce reduce. I know that's a lot of changes, but I feel that it's a great base recipe. It was really, really delicious. I served over rice and honestly I was impressed. I would be very pleased if I was served this in a restaurant.

EZ and delicious! I didn't have tomatoes or olives and I substituted Sherry for the wine. I loved it! It would be excellent over rice or pasta. I served it w/ roasted asparagus. The 2nd day...  EVEN BETTER! Add extra garlic cloves to spread on  bread. Thank you so much!!

Tasty and yummy!  I skipped the olives (not a fan) and used grape tomatoes rather than cherry, but otherwise followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did double it, and I'm grateful I did, because the leftovers have also been numtastic!  At the end, I removed the chicken to a covered plate and boiled down the sauce for about five minutes, to thicken and concentrate the flavor.  Fantastic!  I served it with roasted vegetables (tossed in olive oil with kosher salt, garlic and fresh rosemary) and mashed potatoes.

Absolutely delicious. Couldn't find nicoise olives, so I slice up some kalamatas. I will definitely make this dish again. I used a little more mushrooms than the recipe called for.

We really enjoyed this one.  I had to make just a couple of substitutions.  I used a Tuscan Herb seasoning because I didn't have rosemary, and I actually used regular green olives. And I'm pretty sure I at least doubled the mushrooms.  The chicken was so tender, and everything really blended well.  Even my ten year old son loved it and asked that I make it every week!

I think it'd taste better if you soak the chicken in the white wine for an hour ahead of time.

This is a great recipe.  The first time I made it because I didn't have much else in the pantry.  I threw in some zucchini and canned potatoes with the tomatoes at the end and made it a one skillet dish.  Big hit!  Now I make it about twice a month... everyone loves it!  Kudos!

This was a very easy, very tasty recipe.  I did not have any rosemary, so I substituted Italian Seasoning, and it still had tons of flavor.  I served the dish over rice and it was delicious.

Loved it. Like the last poster I used wine and chicken stock. Awesome falling off the bone good and so tasty. We toasted bread and used the remaining juices as dipping sauce.

I made this exactly as written and it was fabulous!  I did use skinless/boneless thighs because they're easy and the recipe didn't specify.  The meat was cooked through at 40 minutes.  I will definitely make this one again... thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious recipe!!!!! I read some reviews and many stated that the chicken was bland. So, I seasoned my skinless chicken thighs with Goya Adobo set it aside while I finely chopped fresh rosemary and  8 garlic cloves.  As for the wine, I used Goya Cooking wine. I used small whole pitted Kalamata olives since I couldn't find Nicoise olives and used whole cherry tomatoes.  Followed the cooking instructions and OMG was the chicken flavorful. Served it over rice.  Thanks Senorita ;)

Delicious. I followed the recipe except for the wine. The fresh rosemary takes this dish from really good to Wow! To replace the missing wine, I used a splash of good quality balsamic vinegar. My DH said it was the best chicken he ever had. My FIL dropped in for a visit, had leftovers the next day. He said I have a gift! Great chicken. You gotta love rosemary.

Great recipe! Used Kalamata olives instead of Nicoise, mushroom caps instead of sliced mushrooms for a more chunky look, and added 1/2 cup of flour to thicken the gravy while it was simmering. Served over mashed potatoes with a dollup of sour cream (or creme fraishe).

This was very good.  I really enjoyed the tomatoes and olives in it.  My children LOVED it!!!!  They said "mom, can you make this all of the time".  I can't say that I "loved" it.  It just did not give me that WOW factor.  Don't know that I would make it again.

DH and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I made a couple of minor changes based on what I had available: small ripe tomatoes from my garden, roughly chopped, subbed for the cherry tomatoes and greek olives subbed for the nicoise.  I also goofed and tossed the tomatoes in with everything else to simmer... and it was still excellent!  I served it with couscous and chopped fresh parsley.  The chicken thighs were moist and flavorful (I temped them...165 degrees... so cook time was not quite the hour called for) and the sauce delicious over the couscous.  Delicious!  Thanks senioritapupnstuff!

Subtle flavours yet very nice
I followed recipe  pretty close  I pan fried mushroom and garlic in peanut oil good flavour I added more fresh garlic to pan with fresh rosemary and I only had moscato white a sweet wine pan fried chicken 
I then added as per recipe and threw in cherry tomatoes and a few whole medium chillies
Cooked on  medium heat in oven  for 60 min and served with sweet potato/potato mash with cream and butter with shallots sprinkled in and it was fantastic 
I think I would add more mushrooms in contrast to onions  all in all from down under in the sunny gold coast in Queensland. Australia. I found this dish simple fast and yummo

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe to a T and ended up with a bland oily/curdled mess.  Ended up added cream to the sauce to salvage it, which worked, but I am still not a fan of the flavor.

A nice tasty recipe that you can make and serve whenever. I made it before going to work and had it for dinner. If you substitute green olives, DO NOT season with salt. Over rice or pasta, it's a crowd pleaser. I used skinless thighs and recommend you do likewise

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!  What a great meal.  I upped the garlic to six cloves (love garlic) and didn't have any olives on hand so didn't use them.  Served over pasta.  Was Awesome!!!

This recipe is a good foundation, and for that I give it five stars. I was short on supplies and used chicken broth for the wine and skipped the olives and tomatoes. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this dish (even though I went overboard with the red pepper flakes -- eek!).

While this is edible, it did not make me want to do this again, followed the directions with no changes, used a very good wine and just didn't have the excitement I thought it would have. As an other reviewer said it just isn't worth an hours + wait.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it just isn't something that I would make again.  I don't really like chicken thighs, I find them very fatty, so maybe if your substitue chicken breasts it would be better.  I would recommend using high quality wine as you can really taste it in the chicken.  Be careful how much rosemary you use.  That may have been the problem with mine.  I didn't have any fresh so I used 1 tbsp dried instead.  All in all it wasn't worth the hour wait plus prep time.

Thickened the sauce a bit and used almost 3 pounds of boneless chicken thighs and there was plenty of sauce. We enjoyed this very much. I recommend accompanied by rice.

This is really delicious! My only change was using mixed olives from the olive bar that I had on hand instead of shopping for nicoise. I used boneless, skinless thighs (again, what I had) and cut them into chunks after the dish was cooked.  We served it over farfalle. The leftovers were great, too!

oh, yum! successfully substituted white wine vinegar diluted with water, a little honey, and a little butter instead of the white wine. Also subbed dried thyme, basil and bay leaf for the fresh rosemary, and doubled the garlic. Very flavorful!

Very happy to have found this recipe! I used 8oz of button mushrooms, thickly sliced and well caramelized. Had 4 large leg quarters which I separated the thigh and drum. Held off adding the garlic until after the chicken was well brown. Looking forward to making this often.

This is by far one of my favorite dishes.  I did modify the recipe a bit but not by choice.  I didn't have rosemary or red pepper flakes so I used italian seasoning and red pepper.  Also, I didn't have any dry white wine so I used so Pinot Grigio that I had in the fridge.  All in all the dish still came out excellent.  It's very nice when you are looking for a nice healthy dish.  After I was done cooking my boyfriend said "where did you learn to cook like this!"

Great way to cook thighs! I used vegetable broth instead of wine, and "normal" black olives. Served over egg noodles. Will make again! Thanks.

I made this exactly as recipe stated except that I couldn't find the Nicoise Olives, so I used plain black olives and it was fantastic! I've made it twice so far and my husband loved it and my two teenage daughters can be picky eaters at times, and they enjoyed it also.. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was super yummy! I added extra mushrooms like many others did. I used a $ 9 bottle of Sauvignon Blanc...and it out really good! I love spicy food as well as my boyfriend so I added a little extra crushed pepper and used fresh ground black pepper! I will make this one again!

Delicious, rich sauce.  Made it exactly as written, and it was a success.  Will make it without the olives next time, though, as husband doesn't care for them.  Used bone-in chicken legs and backs, and will probably use boneless, skinless chicken thighs next time.  Definitely spoon the sauce over rice - it's fabulous!

The flavor was good, but the chicken thighs shrank up really small. I also used dried rosemary instead of fresh and it was like eating twigs. I might give this recipe a 2nd try with bigger thighs or breasts and either leave the rosemary out or use fresh.

Great recipe. I used drumsticks instead of thighs (it works) and dry instead of fresh rosemary (doesn't work so well). I could have passed on the olives as the taste was overpowering - maybe just the type I used. The mushrooms were very tasty and the chicken so tender (one hour of cooking was worth the wait).

I did a few tweaks such as adding a can of Italian Stewed Tomatoes and also chopped sun dried tomatoes to the wine and let it all simmer together.  WOW! This dish is easy to prepare and absolutley fantastic.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

I've cooked this recipe several times (sans olives) and it's a great one pot dish. Works well with both thighs and drumsticks.

Wow! I made this today for my husband and my mother. I marinated the bone in skinless chicken with the rosemary, garlic, mixed dried hot pepper flakes (from our garden) and 1\4 cup wine for two hours before browning it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was excellent, the meat very tender and not greasy. I served this with a small Pepperidge Farms frozen sourdough loaf, asparigus and a taboolie salad. ( I thought the mirroring of the olives and tomatos pulled the meal together)We also enjoyed the remander of the bottle of pinot grigio I used in the recipe. My family and I highly recomend this meal and the house smelled wonderful too!

YUM. Love this. The only thing I did different was to slice the olives and tomatoes so that I could have a bit with each bite and add maybe a teaspoon of fresh thyme that I had in an herb pot. I used boneless/skinless thighs and they are fall apart tender.

Very good - my husband gives it a 5 but I would say 4 so if I could I'd rate it 4.5.  I would not say it was "bland" but next time I will season up the chicken and let it marinate a bit before cooking.  The sauce was very tasty but the chicken not so much.  Use good tomatoes with lots of flavor (home grown like I did or Cento brand canned tomatoes are very flavorful as well).  I used a Sauvignon Blanc that worked well, very subtle.   I did not measure the fresh rosemary but seemed to have used the right amount, it was not overwhelming.  The only thing I changed was to use butter for sauteeing the mushrooms with 2 extra cloves of minced garlic.   I  followed the recipe exactly from that point except for whisking a couple of tiny shakes of Wondra into the sauce at the end to thicken it just a bit (after removing the chicken).  I used bone in thighs and removed the skin before cooking.  The sauce was delicious and the chicken was very tender.

Didn't make any changes to this recipe.  It was a bit bland.  Would definitely recommend seasoning the chicken before browning.  It needed it.

Wow!  This is the best chicken I have ever made.  The flavor is terrific.  I put this in my favorite recipes and will make again.

I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes and sliced black olives instead of Nicoise olives and it was great.

This was so flavorful!  I did make changes only because some things I didn’t have on hand.  I’m often a last minute meal planner and end up using what I have and it worked!  Substituted canned diced tomatoes (the chunks mostly, not a lot of the juice), pitted large black olives for the Nicoise olives, and to compensate for missing Nicoise flavor, I added capers.  Hubby loved it and we’re having leftovers today. P.S. used boneless, skinless thighs

Excellent, but if deboned chicken is used, cut the fry time down by about 1/2.  Use meat thermometer to test doneness. The olives add a bit of salt, so I wouldn't use additional salt in this recipe.  If you don't have red chili flakes, use a bit of cayenne pepper, it does the trick.

I had high hopes for this dish but it didn't have a lot of flavor.  I made only minor adjustments to the recipe that shouldn't have made a big difference, mainly just substituting roma tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes and using Kalamata olives instead of Niçoise olives.  I put in a full 8-oz package of cremini mushrooms and used fresh rosemary from my garden.  It came out looking  very pretty.

Very good, but I made it a little too greasy. I should have removed the skin or else fried up the chicken alone and then removed excess grease before adding garlic and rosemary. All the flavors blended so well together. Simmering the chicken made it so tender. I only simmered for about 40 minutes instead of the whole hour.

I threw this together with the ingredients we had on hand and everyone enjoyed it. The 7 year old even asked for seconds - after finishing an entire thigh herself. Chicken on the bone is so much better than boneless it's worth cooking when you have time. This recipe was easy because most of the time it just simmered. (Though I kept an eye on mine and it was done in 40 minutes.) I topped the pan with a swish of heavy cream right at the end - otherwise kept it as written.  Will make it again.

Yes, I'm one of 'those' cooks who modify a recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs, because that is what I had on hand. They turned out moist and tender with a killer mushroom rosemary topping that was restaurant quality. I also omitted the tomatoes and olives per my family's preferences, and ended up with a beautiful entree that was simple, yet elegant. The cooking time was much shorter with the boneless breasts--I'd say about 20 minutes, so dinner was on the table faster too.

Very tasty! I change a little and next time need to reduce pepper flaks to half, to spacy!
Changes I make: thighs coat in flour before place in skillet and pour 1 cup of wine.
Delicious!

This  was so fun to make and absolutely delicious!  I used 8oz of baby Bella mushrooms and added a little pat of butter to the olive oil...used fresh rosemary and heirloom cherry tomatoes from the garden...I used Sea Glass Sauvignon Blanc and served it over baked jasmine rice (a recipe I also found on here...best way to make jasmine rice...it's so creamy and good) and sautéed Brussels sprouts, cut in half, with olive oil, butter, sea salt, fresh cracked black pepper, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.  I'll definitely make this dinner again...so good!

Very delicious!  Almost followed, but browned chicken first because it made more sense to me.  Added a small amount of diced onion and full package of baby bell mushrooms and couple dashes of thyme.  Added more olives and tomatoes.  I didn't think tomatoes added much, but hubs liked the "pop" of flavor..  Thickened sauce with 1/4 c chicken broth and cornstarch.  Great over mashed potatoes.  A definite keeper!

this was SO good.. i used 4 large skinless, bone in chicken thighs.. and my $5 pinot grigio went well in this despite it being a "cheap" wine.. i took the thighs out of the pan after the hour had passed, added the tomatoes (2 romas) and the olives (green stuffed w/pimentos), cooked them in the broth, shredded the chicken, and put it back in.. i added some chicken bouillon and onion powder to this and it sealed the deal.. bf said he wants to have this in tacos.. i'm sure it will be good no matter how it's served up.. ty for the recipe

Overall taste was great but I think next time I will thicken the sauce, little too runny for my taste. 
I like a nice rich sauce to go over noodles or rice but ty for the post

What a great recipe!  I only had 4 boneless thighs so for eight, I think you'll need to increase the liquid.  Had cheapo wine so I added a splash of cooking sherry.  Couldn't find the nicoise olives so I substituted calamata.  The only other change I made was to add a little cornstarch/water to the liquid to thicken.  It was wonderful!

I don't normally like chicken thighs, but this tured out pretty well. I used Jackson Triggs Sauvingnon Blanc and switched nicoise olives for kalamata. I ended up needing to add more wine, so next time maybe I'll let it simmer less.  I found the mushrooms soaked up a lot of win so next time I'll add them with the tomatoes.

We loved this dish. I admittedly changed it quite a bit because on the lack of availability of certain items & was too lazy to go to the store! It is a recipe that lends itself to modification for instance I added some lemon zest on top of the chicken & a little lemon juice to the vegis.

Fantastic!  I went the "cheap" way.  I used bone-in chicken leg quarters, that I divided and stripped the skin off myself.  I used fresh rosemary and cherry tomatoes from my garden.  I also used some leftover Reisling from about a week ago that has been just ~waiting~ in the bottle in the fridge for such an occassion!  For olives, pfft... good old black olives from the can worked great!
I served this over a bed of yellow (saffron) rice that I got for a dollar at Dollar General. lol  For something cold and crunchy to go with it I served it with a spear of cold cucumber that I picked this morning and put in the fridge.  The last thing I put on the plate were 2 pieces of a warmed up, quartered pita.
This recipe was mega easy and for me, downright reasonably priced and SUPER TASTY!

Full of flavour, I will definitely make it again.  I found that there was quite a bit of liquid, so I added 2tbsp of cornstarch to 1/4 cup water and whisked that in for a few minutes while it was simmering to make it more into a gravy.  It's best to do that just before serving.

I followed the recipe exactly.  No one in my family liked it.  Aside from the rosemary, the taste was somewhat bland.  We were hoping for more flavor.  The tomatoes just made it more odd.  Sorry I wasn't able to leave positive feedback.

Turned out pretty dry. Definitely do not need simmering for one hour. I would say half hour is just enough. Flavor was good, but no good sauce to dip.

I left out the olives as I had none.  Also I diluted 1/2 white wine and 1/2 water with a bit of cornstarch to get a bit of a sauce with some thickening.

This turned out very well. I did not have any fresh Rosemary so I used some dried from my spice rack.  I also did not have any cherry tomatoes so I just cut up some roma tomatoes and threw them in there.  I also did not have the Nicoise olives and would have forgot to put them in anyway as I didn't even notice them on the recipe until after I'd made the dinner!  Very simple dinner to make if you follow the recipe directions.  
I usually do not eat chicken thighs but was getting tired of eating the chicken breasts all the time and decided to try thighs out for once, and this was definately a good recipe to spice them up a little.

The chicken was very tender... fall off the bone tender! The sauce was good, but could have used a little more "punch"... I agree it could be spiced a little better to balance out how rich it is. I would make this recipe again, with changes.

The rosemary taste was far too strong for my liking.  The wine you use also seriously influences the taste. I imagine if the wine I used was a little higher quality, this dish may have tasted better.
