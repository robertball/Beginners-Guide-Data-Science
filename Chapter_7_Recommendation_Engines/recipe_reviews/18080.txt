These cookies were a hit with my family.  They liked my use of mini jelly beans in place of the chocolate nut, too.

So clever! They taste great! I used M&Ms chocolate covered peanuts, and they work marvelously, without falling out of the nests.

Great recipe but these are not Almond macaroons - they are coconut butter cookies.

I made these twice this past Easter weekend, the first time following the recipe exactly. The second time I watched the video & read all the reviews then made my own adjustments and would highly recommend the following changes: 1/2 Tbsp baking powder, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp almond extract and specifically sweetened coconut flakes and a variety of eggs (I used Lindt chocolate covered almonds and Robin eggs). The reduction in baking powder is due to cookies rising too much initially & not keeping the dip to hold the eggs. The recipe doesn't specify unsweetened or sweetened coconut flakes so I used sweetened and reduced the sugar because they were very sweet the first time! (For my taste anyway, but were still very much liked!) And finally the extracts were to give it a little more flavor, the almond addition went very well and also softened the cookies. The video is much more informative, don't forget to cool the batter before rolling in the coconut flakes to prevent spreading. Also baking at 325 for 14-15 minutes then allowing to cool was easier than the other way. The second time after the adjustments I enjoyed them much more, hope this helps!

I made these today and followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  and 1/4 tsp almond extract. I didn't color the coconut which I wish I would have. They taste fine but they spread out and don't look like nests. What did I do wrong?

Fun to make. I used jelly beans for eggs and added a little almond extract to batter.  Followed the baking instructions and very pleased with final product.  Will definitely make this one again.

Gave this 5 stars because I’ve had these before, they are delicious. The contributor states that they are filled with ‘chocolate covered almonds’...not in the recipe. I came here from the ‘6 Traditional Easter Desserts for Your Post-Church Lunch’. In that photo, did anyone notice that the candy-coated almonds are missing in the bottom, left macaroon?! Too funny...guess someone got hungry before the photo shoot.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! well-received at Easter dinner. The only small change I made was I added a bit of almond flavoring with the vanilla (1/2 tspn Vanilla, 1/4 tspn almond) . So attractive - so tasty! Will make again. You should try it! 

Should this have my name? Bev

I made these for Easter and they turned out cute- like little nests with peanut M&Ms for the eggs, but they weren't as sweet as I was expecting.  Too plain for me, I wouldn't make them again.

No almonds LOL,  but great tasting.   Made a few with no coconut for those who don't like it.   Made some with chocolate eggs and some with jelly beans (these didn't stay on well).  Easy &  tasty!

This was a fun recipe! I found the dough to have a tang like snickerdoodles, 1T seems a lot of baking powder but the little nests stayed fluffy so it worked. I did not use vanilla or food coloring.

One problem I ran into upon first test was candy covered chocolate (Cadbury mini eggs in my case) crack when baked and the little cracked eggs look so sad in their nest. Next try I did thumbprints in the rolled dough balls and finished with a dough decorating tool mid-bake to indent the nests.

I needed to bake mine longer to get the dough fully cooked (I chilled dough for easier handling) but when finished they are a lovely butter yellow with golden edges.

I used icing to cement the candies in their nests.

I will definitely make these again. Slivered almonds in the nests suggested by another reviewer sound bomb.

Thanks to the poster of this recipe!!

These cookies are easy and yummy!  As others mentioned there isn't any almond in the recipe, so I adjusted the recipe and used 1/2 tsp. of almond extract + 1/4 tsp. of vanilla to get the almond flavor I was looking for.  I think all the candies can be added after baking (much like peanut butter blossoms) to avoid the candy egg shells from cracking while baking.  Very tasty, thanks for the recipe!

Clever idea for a really cute holiday cookie.  My husband is diabetic so I made the macaroons with unsweetened coconut and Splenda -- used 62% chocolate for the "glue".  M&M's were a small indulgence, but everyone bends the rules a little for an Easter treat!
