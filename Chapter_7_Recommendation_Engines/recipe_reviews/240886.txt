Used a pound of baby octopus instead on one small one. Added cherry tomatoes, 11 olives. Then added a little olive oil and vinegar salad dressing to give it a little mor oomf at the very end right before the feta. Trying a reviewless recipe that had no pictures, I was a little hesitant. This turned out great though!
