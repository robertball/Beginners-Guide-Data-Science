This is a very rich dish.  In order to achieve a smooth consistency for the sauce, I changed the order of preparation.  Instead of adding the cheese and cream separately to the cooked pasta, I whisked it in to the butter, oil, and garlic in the saute pan.  Then the spinach was added to simmer just until wilted.  The cooked fettucine was tossed into the spinach cream sauce to finish.  This would be fine as a vegetarian dish.  I opted to add shrimp to the dish because we like it that way.  I would also suggest using a mild parmesan cheese to reduce the possibility of an overpowering pungency.  I think I'll stick to a more traditionoal alfredo sauce, but thanks for the recipe. Some may find this version more simple to prepare.
