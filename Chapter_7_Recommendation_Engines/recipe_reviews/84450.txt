I have used this recipe twice- excellent. Read carefully, I have been to 23 countries. This is how I modified: No meat-to greasy. No garlic- not needed. No sugar- use aged vinegar, nice and sweet. I also added one cube chicken bullion and one can of chicken stock, no fat. Also HALF the tomato paste. FRESH dill- lots.  
Cooked onions in grape seed oil, high burn rate. If you follow what I suggest, you will achieve culinary greatness and Ukrainian authenticity.

Very good. I cook my beets with the skins on for about an hour in the water I will use for the soup. The skins slip right off after boiling and its easy to chop or slice them, besides it increases the nutritional value of the soup!

My family and I lived in Russia for 3 1/2 years, and I have looked for a borscht recipe that was the same as we had there.  This one was perfect!  I've never had borscht with meat in it, so I made it vegetarian.  This was the real thing - especially with the sourcream, or "smeatana" on top!

Well, I grew up in Ukraine till I was 19, and this recipe has not much to do with the classic.First it is with pork meat- solid, juicy, not some boiled crumbs.No pork? Then chicken.Second-"boil beets they lost color(shape and nutrition value)"-why?It takes 10 minutes to have them cooked with love, preserving color,aroma, taste.Add even some more , finely shredded!  recepie.

I lived in Russia for 6 months and this is authentic!  Don't overcook it or the rich magenta color will turn brick red.  Delicious and so healthy.  Even my three year old liked it.

I tried out this recipe but added a few changes. First of all I prepared the sausage seperately and put it aside. For the veggie mix, I used a big bag of already prepared coleslaw mix since it has the cabbage and carrots already incorporated. I also used two cans of baby red beets. I prepared the vegetable mix and the onion and tomato paste mix separately and then mixed those two together. I then pureed the whole thing to give it a thicker and denser texture. I returned it to the pot and then added the sausage, salt and pepper to taste. I left out the sugar.

It came out beautifully but I think the use of a whole can of diced tomatoes AND the tomato paste made this soup more tomato-y than red beet-y. In the future, I'll skip the tomato paste. Really good with crusty French bread and the dallop of sour cream.

I made this as an appetizer for Ukrainian Easter, it was really good. I wish it had a deeper beet flavor though.  I added some red wine reduction in mine to give it a fuller flavor and to enhance the beets.  I also made the soup a day in advance to let the flavors develop.  I added some oregano to the recipe as well (I add oregano to everything) and didnt use as much tomatoes or tomato paste.  I have seen a lot of borscht recipes that either involve beef or beef broth and I had always thought this was traditional (although i dont really think it is) so I used a little beef broth in replace of some of the water.. i wouldnt use too much though because it can take away from the beets.  I plated the borscht in bowls that were set on top of leaves from the beets (which are edible and have a little purple coloring to them so they looked great with the soup). Overall, I would use this recipe again with a few adjustments. ...maybe more beets and less cabbage considering the cabbage doesnt add as much to it.

I must say that I was skeptical, but I absolutely LOVED it!  We like our veggies in chunks (it's hard to shred beets without turning the counter pink!), so we diced/chopped all the vegetables, and it came out great.  Thanks for this recipe!

I did like this borscht a lot and found it to be very authentic, but it was a little too sweet for me with the amount of sugar called for... I should have paid more attention to the "to taste" part and added it 1/4 tsp. at a time. I also (as a few other reviewers have mentioned) served it with dill instead of parsley. The Borscht I recipe on this site is also very good, but this one seems more true to the ones I have had in Russia or Ukraine.

I am a Peace Corps volunteer living in Ukraine so I know good borsch (borsch is originally Ukrainian, not Russian!), and this recipe is delicious!  You should know that every baba (grandma) has her own recipe that her family will learn and believe to be better than all the rest--so personalize this recipe away!  If it's authenticity you're looking for, use sunflower oil (not vegetable, and not grapeseed either--it's sunflower or bust around here).  Also, I've never seen anyone add sugar to their recipe.  A little bit of fresh dill is pretty normal too, as are white beans, if that's your thing.  Finally, most Ukrainians agree with user JOCARROL: boil your beet with the skin on for 45 minutes or so to make it soft before you shred it.  And remember--it's practically a sin to eat borsch without the sour cream so load it on!

Very good soup. I served it with a homemade crusty bread. I had never tried a Borscht before, so I didn't know what to expect. The tomato base reminds me of a old fashion vegetable soup ... just different vegetables. I didn't have fresh beets on hand so I used a pint jar of canned (that I had put up earlier this summer).  I just drained the liquid and added them after the cabbage so they would not cook down to a mush. I also did not have fresh garlic so I substituted garlic power.  I have no doubt that fresh garlic would taste better, but sometimes you just have to work with what you have on hand. The instructions call for a "large pot". You should use at least a 6 quart stock pot.  I started out with a 4 quart  and had to transfer to a larger one. I will definitely make this soup again.

Well, I'm Ukrainian myself and wanted to add some suggestions to the recipe. (since it's Ukrainian dish after all, it's probably different from Russian version). Anyway, we never add any tomato paste or diced tomatoes, or sugar. It's good just with beets, cabbage, potatoes, and meat. Also I usually cook my beets, then shred. Also, for meat - you can use any kind of pork meat, don't have to have pork sausage. Also, add cabbage at the very end (make sure you "soften" it by "scrunching" up cabbage in your hands. I hope it helps.

This dish is simple enough to make (my first soup attempt ever, and it went off without a hitch), and has an awesome old world, authentic kind of taste to it.  The sausage addition makes for a hearty soup!

I didn't add anything, leave anything out, substitute anything or change any of the instructions. Can I still write a review? I also have never had borscht before, so I have not the vaguest idea what it should taste like...but this tastes great! My guest tonight agreed and took some home to "share with her friends", and she took at least 4 large servings, so I think she may really do that! Anyway, Patti, thanks so much for this super recipe!

Apple Cider Vinegar is the secret to the perfect borsht seasoning. Try some in your bowl before you add it to the whole batch, the difference is amazing! Otherwise a great recipe!

I made this soup 5 times already and love it, so did my husband and his friend, both born and bred Russians. Please do no omit the garlic, it gives so much flavor, not sure what having been to 23 countries has to do with knowing Ukranian cuisine. My husband loved the garlic, the parsley and also absolutely add dill, lots of it. I add all three right before I turn the heat off, this way the flavors blend well, but the greens don't overcook. I agree with someone who said before, use sunflower oil, my grandmother, mother and MIL still cook with it. I used olive oil but it's not the same. I tried one with sausage - good, one vegetarian - very good, one with beans - didn't think it was great, but wasn't bad either. To save time you can shred the beets in food processor, though I dice them very finely for more kid-appeal. Also, buy the packaged Cole Slaw, saves you time and mess from chopping cabbage. About the tomatoes- I also thought it was too much, so I just halved the amount, so try it this way first and see if you'd like more or less. Serve with smetanka and hearty country bread and enjoy!

I know it may seem a bit unfair to review a recipe after making changes to it, but I think this recipe is very forgiving in that regard. So, I omitted the sausage and oil, and substituted chicken broth for the water. At the end, in place of the sugar, I poured some apple juice and because we had no parsley or dill, I threw in a bit of cider vinegar to give it a tang. With all of that, we thought it was a very good soup. We ate it cold with sour cream the first day and hot later.  It may not be authentic the way I made it, but my husband (who is a dedicated beet hater) gave it a 9 and said he would definately eat it again.  Oh, I also quartered and boiled the beets, carrots and potatoes in the broth and just mashed them with a potato masher instead of shredding beforehand, only because it was too much trouble to pull out the food processor.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe. I hadn't had borscht in a while, but it tasted like I expected it should. My modifications: boiled beets in the water I used like others suggested for about 25 minutes and then sliced instead of shredded, added two beef bullion cubes to this and some pepper. I also added to this about one tbsp of cider vinegar and probably about 2 tsp of lemon juice for a little more acidity. I threw in lots of fresh dill too, about 3 tablespoons or so. I skipped the parsley though, I bought it but forgot to use it. I used 4 beets instead of 3, skipped the tomato paste. I also added about 3/4 cup of shredded beet greens around the same time as the potatoes. Overall I was quite happy with how it turned out. If I make it again I would definitely skip the sausage. I skimmed some of the fat off the top as it was boiling, but it still ended up a little too greasy. The meat didn't really add anything to the flavor anyways, I just saw it as added protein for protein's sake. If you want protein with this just serve with cheeses on the side like I did. I'm sure that's not very traditional, but it turned out to be a great meal. Next time I make it I'll probably throw in extra bullion cubes to compensate for the lack of meat. Whatever you do, serve it with a nice dark rye bread. I baked Russian Black Bread with a recipe from Smitten Kitchen to go with it and it turned out fantastic.

This is a very good recipe, but I miss a few ingredients my mother used in her Borsch.  The most important is chopped up beet greens from the beets (this is essential), lots of dill, and a few smoked baby ribs instead of the sausage.  Otherwise this recipe is authentic (i.e., same as my mother's).

Honestly, there is no such thing as one authentic recipe...it's like indian curry, or any other national dish - you have regional variations, different recipes from family to family, and it changes seasonally to use what is to hand. It must have beets, and must have dill, is about the only rule. We liked this, as we have liked all borscht recipes, you just have to leave out what you don't like, and adjust the rest to taste.

I never added the sugar and didn't salt or pepper it, and I halved the recipe. I decided to just dump in the whole can of tomato, it didn't seem to matter. 
It was AMAZING. Simply amazing stuff. I read a lot of recipes and decided to give this a try, since this is my first time making borscht. It was amazing, I'm posting it to FB and bringing in the extra to work to share. FYI, I don't know where they got the idea that all of this could be done in an hour. It takes me almost 2 hours from start to finish (not including the dishes and mess it makes). Still worth every moment.

This was a good recipe,  but with one VERY large omission! This will taste absolutely nothing like Ukrainian borscht without the addition of large amounts of fresh dill weed. The dill is the most stand out taste in borscht (as made in UA.)

I've never had borscht before so I decided to try this, and the result? YUM!! This is a forgiving recipe. I am not a fan of sausage so I omitted that... but I think I will try it next time anyway. According to other reviews, I halved the amount of cabbage, and instead of skipping the tomato paste all together I put in half. I don't have parsley so I used dill as was suggested by other reviewers, but I only had dry and it seemed to work just fine. What a hardy soup, and so healthy! For extra nutrients, I didn't even peel the veggies I just scrubbed them and cut off nasty bits... but let me tell you, it definitely doesn't take 15 minutes prep - shredding all the carrots and beets took forever!! Otherwise, this is fantastic and I will definitely be making this a whole lot.

I ate borscht at a Ukrainian restaurant in NYC and loved it! Finally got around to trying it myself. After reading some of the reviews, I opted for vegetarian borscht. I left out the tomato paste entirely and just added a whole can of the diced tomatoes. I used 4 beets, shredded 2 of them and cut 2 of them in thin sticks. I added 1 quart of beef broth instead of water, some red wine and also lemon concentrate  at the end because I felt it had to be tangier (I really like marinated baby beets). The dill is really working wonders for this soup, I used lots of it.
All in all, an easy recipe to follow and I love how it came out. I think next time I may try to add one jar of the marinated beets and see how that works out.

Loved this! Did not add meat. I baked the beets rather than boil them, then peeled them prior to putting in the pot. I added a little veggie broth for flavoring. It is so yummy! Will definitely make this again. Probably will try putting cabbage and carrots in the food processor as hand grating was messy and time consuming.

I have done an amazing, traditional, non-meat borscht before and I found this one lacking in flavour, to be honest. I had to add quite a bit to it: chicken stock, lots of dill, lots of S&P. Wish I could find my old recipe, actuallly! The beet taste was subdued at best. But a nice, very basic "base," in my humble opinion!

I used veal as we don't put sausage into borscht here in Lviv, Ukraine.  It was very close to what my Ukrainian friends make.  We also put bay leaves into it.  Also on this side of Ukraine we don't put garlic into borscht.  Thanks for the recipe,  I will definately use it again.

Fantastic!  I assumed that the beets would need to be cooked and peeled before I started and did so before reading the recipe.  It was way easier to peel this way I think and worked fine when I added them with the potatoes and carrots.  I forgot the sugar and I don't think it was needed and I doubled the garlic which I think was awesome!  I also didn't shred anything...just chopped.  Will surely make this again!

Love this recipe.  Very hearty and reheats well.  I eliminated the sausage (allergic to pork) and sugar.  To me, the sugar didn't really add anything.  The only other sub was that I used garlic cubes, which i had on hand, versus garlic cloves.  I love and fix a lot of Russian/Ukrainian/Eastern European items and this recipe is a keeper.

Just returned from Ukraine and Belarus, where I ate Borscht soup repeatedly, using different local specialties.  This recipe is GREAT and AUTHENTIC using the following modifications: fill the soup pot half way with a combination of Chicken Stock and Water; omit the sugar; substitute Red Wine Vinegar (plenty sweet and nice tangy flavor);  omit the tomato products (wasn't ever in dishes I was served overseas);  replace garlic with lots of fresh dill.  Although pork was very common in Ukraine, we omitted the pork.  Instead we poured the soup over shredded extra lean brisket, prepared separately.  All of our family members loved it!  Thanks to the review from "eatmedetroit" for helping me re-create a favorite culinary experience from our vacation!

I had never made borscht before so I followed this recipe almost exactly as written and it was delicious! Definitely involves a lot of chopping, slicing and peeling but it was well worth it and generally a pretty easy recipe. Will definitely make again!

For those interested, here are the very minor changes I made: didn't use the sausage or any meat for that matter (still delicious and very filling); added a little more water than it called for, probably close to 1.5 cups by the end; added some salt and pepper while it was simmering before the onions and tomato paste went in; I mashed the vegetables slightly at the end to thicken it/break down some of the vegetables because I prefer a thicker soup overall rather than a thin broth with chunks of vegetable.  

I think this recipe would probably be just as good without these changes, they were just a matter of personal taste/habit for me.

i made this vegetarian with less water and pureed 1/2 of the beet/carrot/potato mixture.  made a less authentic but delicious thick stew -- my new favorite borscht recipe!  used lots of dill and a couple tsp of apple cider vinegar instead of sugar and garlic.  no tomatoes because i didn't have any.  yuuuuuuum :)

Phenomenal!! This is the best Borscht I've ever eaten and I've been to several Ukrainian restaurants.  I highly recommend this one.  Use the food processor for ease with shredding.

This is the first time I've ever tried Borscht soup. I made the recipe as is except I didn't use the tomato paste because I read the other reviews. I also chopped a big handful of fresh dill. The soup was delicious!

Delicious.  I made mine with freshly roasted beets which makes a huge difference in deepening the beet flavor. 

Another thing I did, because I was in a hurry when I made the soup, is that I added a jar of Sweet and Sour Red Cabbage.

Absolutely delicious.  I am Eastern European.

Overall a good recipe.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and boiled my beets for ~1hr before dicing, and then saved the water to use in the soup.  I accidentally added too much water, beware because it is easy to dilute the flavor.  Didn't need sugar at all!  And after adding LOTS of dill and letting the soup sit in the fridge overnight, the flavor the next day was even better!

Superb! I also omitted the meat ingredient. Lots and lots of dill really helps to bring out the borscht flavours, in my opinion. Thanks!

I have made this borscht a couple of times now and have blended my old recipe with it.  I add 2 tbsp lemon juice to the recipe which I have doubled to 2 quarts water and 2 quarts chicken stock.  I also omit the sausage.  I use 8  beets and the same amount of carrots called for.  I also garnish with dill instead of parsley.

Love this. I was looking for something to do with my beets - I love beet greens, but what to do with the beets...? I tried other recipes and they were ok but no one else ate them. So I tried this, without the meat. I cubed/chopped, rather than shredded since I'm not very good at shredding. I also used chicken stock instead of water and skipped the tomato paste, skipped the sugar, and used stewed tomatoes (2 cans). It was great and was better the next day. I really love when the potatoes fall apart. The soup has great texture. Finally, something to do with the leftovers from my beet greens :) As an aside, I took "cook beets until they lose their color" to mean when the beets color the soup, which for me was about 10 min., when they were also tender.

I don't give many 5-star ratings (and my husband doesn't give ANY), but we both love this. Best recipe I've come across on this site. I just ate three bowls, and my husband is serving himself a fourth bowl right now. Amazing. I followed the recipe as written but used only 1/2 tsp of sugar rather than a full tsp. It seemed just right to me. Some reviewers recommended using fresh dill rather than parsley. I looove dill, so I gave that a try, and it was very good. That said, my husband and I both prefer it with fresh parsley. Parsley accentuates the complex medley of flavors in the soup rather than blurring/masking them. Next time we will try this without the sausage to see whether we like it as much.

I thought this was delish!  I ate the left overs for more than a week at work.  Just added a dollop o f sour cream and was good to go.  Usually I add things or remove things here or there, this one however I did not as I have never tried to make Borscht before.  I did use the pork sausage, but my Ukrainian student whom I showed the recipe to said it was very strange for there to be pork sausage.  She suggested beef.

This was very good. Next time I would add more beets as it was a little watery. I ended up tossing in a couple of beef bouillon cubes at the last minute to make up for the watery problem. That worked nicely. We really enjoyed the end result.

I like this though I found it a bit bland, BUT  I had to sub some of the sausage with hamburger so may have lost some taste. It needed salt! it's my first time making it though and I don't have anything to compare it to. Didn't have sour cream, either. By the way I used frozen cooked beets from the summer, just thawed them and diced them and added after the other veg were cooked. Seemed to work well. I think I would use stock instead of water to try to round out the flavor. It did make a LOT! I have about 3L in the freezer!

This is delicious and the fact that it is loaded with nutrition is even better!  I like a more chunky soup so I cubed the beets instead of shredding them, but other than that I followed the recipe to a 't'.

great taste, but had no texture because everything was shredded. Will make again, but will dice all vegetable to give soup texture and visual appeal. Low rating due to texture.

I registered just so I could give this recipe a 5. Hearty and delicious. I use turkey sausage and a dash or two of cider vinegar instead of sugar. This has become a repeat player in my household.

Great recipe. As other sugested - boil the beets first and use the water for the soup.  But the most important aspect this recipe is lacking is dill !!! It gives a completely particular taste and it's a must. Finish the soup with smetana or sour cream, and add both fresh choped dill and italian parsley.

I made this at my son's request he loves beets!  It came out very good.  I took used dill instead of parsley.  I didn't use any meat and I kept all my veggies in chunks instead of shredding.  I also omitted the sugar and used balsamic vinegar instead.  It came out excellent!

My partner, who is Ukrainian, says it is nothing like the one his grandmother made when he was growing up (he thinks, no potatoes...).  Having said that, we both enjoyed it immensely It did the trick for me. The dill in place of the parsley is a must. This will be my contribution to my next potluck.

My Ukrainian mother made a soup like this but I never got her recipe.  This is a very good alternative.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I added a few variations to it- Half of a fresh squeezed lemon for a more tangy broth, as well as 2 tablespoons of oil for a richer broth. I also added celery and a can of corn for extra veggies. :)

Very Good! I followed the recipe except for the following...used 1 qt. beef stock with 1 qt. water and fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned. My 2 year old even gobbled it up!

I thought this recipe was outstanding. It canned very well. I have to add more salt for my taste, and fresh chives add another dimension as garnish.

We made this without the sausage and it wasn't a very big hit, but I'm not sure our usual recipe is very authentic at all :)

I used Veggy Broth instead of the 2 quarts of water.
I did not add the 3/4 cup of water.
I added some basil and dill at the end
and 1 Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar at the end.
This is so yummy!! Perfect for the  beets in our garden - this is a great recipe for that.  I am going to make more of this, to freeze to have later this winter

A healthy twist?  This is a delicious recipe.  I used bison sausage and added honey instead of sugar.  I also added tons of fresh dill and lemon juice - which was a recommendation from a Ukrainian Babba I know.  Yum.

Great googly moogly. Love this recipe. Okay, so I left out the sausage, subbed golden beets (assuming red were preferred), left out the garlic and used a can of tomatoes with chilies in place of plain diced. Definitely not Ukranian by the time I got finished, but I'm sure were I to offer it to someone who spoke Ukranian, they'd be okay with it.

I added lots of dill.  Aside from that this is a fantastic recipe.  It's good for you, it's cooked in under an hour, freezes and reheats well, and tastes great.  Cook it!  Eat it!  Love it!

I didn't find this recipe to stand out much. The flavor is just okay. I added more salt, balsamic vinegar, and thyme to try to add some flavor, and it was good, but probably not something I'll make again... unless I just have to use up some beets.

Wonderful! Perhaps next time I will dice some of the beets and puree some. The shredded beet texture was a little strange but the taste made up for it by leaps and bounds!
I also added a few beef bouillon cubes to round out the flavor a bit.

Tastes great!!! Very good soup for a cold day. I may try adding a little more water or some chicken broth because it came out more like a stew then a soup. Great anyways!

I lived in Russia for a couple of years and this is pretty close to authentic.  I've never had borscht with sausage though, only ever with beef.  I will probably make it with less tomato paste next time, as it was a little too tomato-y for me.  Also, try it with a dollop of mayo instead of sour cream.  We ate it that way in Russia all the time and it is delicious.

Very good recipe.  I used beef short ribs and added some beef broth.  I grated the veggies for uniformity.  No need for the sugar.  I added 1 T vinegar for that very subtle sweet and sour effect.  My family loved it served with fresh bread!

What an amazing soup! I made a few changes to it though and think it still came out beautifully. Instead of using pork sausage, I used about 6-8 slices of bacon (chopped) and a half pound of ground beef. This gave it a wonderful smoky flavor and reminded me of my grandmother's recipe. Also, I didn't add any of the tomato paste or canned tomatoes. I felt that the beet flavor would be more distinguished this way. Will absolutely make it again, my husband won't stop talking about it!

Really good. I didn't think the beet flavor was very strong, which was a plus for those who I made it for, but if I were going to make it again for myself, I'd add some more beets.

Really great recipe.  My husband and daughter took a very large pot of this to their church and served almost 50 people who were all raving about it.  They loved that they had brought something unique and they had a blast serving it.  We set out each serving with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling of parsley and some crusty bread alongside.  Thanks for sharing!

This is different than the borscht my grandmother from czechoslovakia used to make but just as delicious.  I made it without the sausage and added some beef broth in place of the water. It was just delicious.

This was awesome! I didn't put in the sausage, or parsley garnish (because I forgot), but it was great, especially with sour cream. It looks really cool because it's extremely red. It seems pretty healthy and alkalizing as long as you don't go hog wild on the sour cream. I'm making it again for sure.

I made this recipe last night, per the instructions, with the following changes:  we omitted the sugar (based on some earlier reviews and our penchant for things to be not too sweet), and I think I added more cabbage than called for.  I also added a bay leaf, as some other similar recipes suggested. It was quite good!  I've never had "authentic" borscht before, so I can't comment on that, but it was a hearty way to use up a good deal of our fall CSA farm share, which consisted of beets, onion, garlic, cabbage (the size of my car) and carrots.  We used pork sausage and added the sour cream, garnishing with flat Italian parsley.  I first peeled the beets, then grated them (along with the carrots) on a KitchenAid mixer grater attachment. I used large red potatoes, peeled. Otherwise, I believe I would have cubed them, like some earlier reviewers suggested.  I will be interested to see how it tastes a day or two after, once the flavors have had a chance to meld together.  There was no mention of serving this cold, but with the sausage, I think I wouldn't.  My husband and I agreed that it needed a bit more salt, or something.  Some recipes I found called for cider vinegar, so maybe a tablespoon or so would perk it up a bit.  Overall, this was really good!

Next time, I think I'd chop (not shred) the cabbage, and maybe try a splash of good cider vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic soup!  I had to use canned beets, and I wasn't paying attention and didn't drain the diced tomatoes, but I don't think the soup really suffered any because of it.  The dollop of sour cream on top gave it just enough tang to make it even more delicious.  Warning though, it took me a LOT longer than 15 minutes prep!

This is beyond good! I have never been a beet lover and only made this out of desperation when I didn't know what else to do with the huge beet crop given to me by a gardener friend. But in the three weeks I've had this recipe, I have made it five times already!! Wow, it is SO delicious, with OR without the sausage! Next year I'm growing my own beets...

This was my first time eating Borscht and it was very good! I got beets from the produce section but think I will used canned, diced beets next time. Maybe it's my location, or maybe they are out of season, but it was $1.30 for 4 small beets. Oh, I diced everything but next time will add the potatoes about the same time as I do the cabbage so they don't overcook and "disappear". Thanks for the recipe, and helping me expand my menu!

Really enjoyed this soup - so wonderful with all the yummy fresh veg. I do agree with a previous reviewer, however, who thought it would have been better with more broth as it was quite thick. Despite that though, the soup is delicious and I will make it again for sure.

I have made this recipe twice now. Each time I always cook the meat with the onions first in the pot I will be using so I dont loose any of the "fonde" for flavor. I drain the meat a bit to reduce the fat, but then everything else I do exactly to plan. 

My husband doesn't like beets at all and he loves this soup when I make it. 

I also microplane the garlic in to maximize the garlic flavor.

I doubled it because I usually double recipes, but I filled two family-sized pots and ended up eating borscht for almost three weeks! It tastes way better with sour cream.

I've had borscht only a couple of times and loved it. I actually like beets. But the tomato in this recipe completely overpowers the beets. Won't be making this again. Full disclosure: I'm vegetarian and omitted the sausage.

I come from a Ukrainian family and grew up hating red borscht until I grew older. The first time I made it, I was already living in Austria with my husband and kids. I decided to whip it up; going on my memories, and it was a huge hit. So much so, it's become one of our fall-backs. Traditionalists will cringe when I say this: I add Tabasco to mine; a bit of balsamic vinegar and tomato juice. Why the Tabasco? 
At Christmastime, red borscht is a staple dish, along with mushroom-filled "Vushka" or ravioli. There is always one in the batch that is filled with black pepper instead of mushrooms. The Vushka are then used, like dumplings, in the borscht. The one to bite into the one filled with black pepper, is the winner of all that year's luck. :-) I have had -- in my 43 years -- my share of the black pepper Vushkas. To be honest, I can't imagine a borscht without a kick. That's actually when I really started liking it... Maybe I'm Mexican, really.

Great recipe. I par-boiled the beets for half-an-hour then peeled them under cold water (avoiding staining everything, including myself, red)... Saving the boiling liquid as the base for the soup. I cut the beets up the same size as the pototoes and carrots. I omitted the grated cabbage and canned tomatoes. To avoid adding extra sugar, a tablespoon of balsalmic vinegar to the tomato paste/onions worked really well. Season with salt and pepper generously. This recipe was a really good base for making an excellent borscht!

Great recipe!  My monthly co-op farm produce box included three organic beets and a bunch of organic carrots.  Borscht was the first thing I thought of.  I found this recipe and was delighted.  A couple of changes:  No sausage - really not necessary.  I also substituted a box of TJ's vegetable broth for the water and left out the garlic.

I'd never tasted borscht before making this.  I don't know if it's authentic or not, but it is absolutely delicious!  I wish I'd discovered this recipe years ago.  I didn't have bulk sausage on hand, so I diced Polish sausage, browned it slightly, and then followed the recipe exactly.  I froze the leftovers and they're equally good.
Thanks for sharing this recipe, Patti.  I'll be making this one again and again.

We pulled out the winter garden today so beets, cabbage and carrots went from the garden into the pot. It is the kind of thick soup we love. BUT, as organized as I am, the prep took 35 minutes. I made it exactly as instructed but left out the sugar and garlic. the garlic would be lost, so don't bother.

I have spent many weeks in Ukraine this year. I used this recipe during the Holidays this year and found to be as close the what I had eaten in Ukraine. If you use fresh veggies then Prep time is not 15 minutes, about 30 minutes. I want to experiment with the meat. next time I want to use pork from the ribs.

I've never had borscht before so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like but I don't know how so many ingredients can produce a dish that has no flavor. I love vegetables and have never disliked any vegetable dish this much. I thought about maybe adding some spices to it to save it but I knew I wouldn't be able to stand eating chunky, spiced water.

This was delicious!  It brought me right back to when I was in Ukraine.  I didn't add any sugar, but everything else I kept right with the recipe.  I will definitely be recommending this to my family.

On a side note, toasted and buttered sourdough bread has always been my favorite "side dish" for this soup: so good!!

Super yummy! Baby loved it: blend it up or strain and give the soup juice in a cup with the veggies shreds on his tray. 
I didn't use meat, but used 1 t beef bullion. No sugar or tomato anything, except a squirt or two of ketchup (which is key). No garlic or garnishings needed either. 
Served withwarm crusty artisan bread.

SO good & always gets rave reviews. Even better the next day. I tried using turkey sausage, but it was tasteless. Used canned beets because it was easier, used nappa cabbage because it's sweeter. Other than that, made it as written, and it's fantastic!

Wonderful recipe.  I had Borsht at a Russian restaurant and loved it there.  This was a lot of work, though, especially shredding the beets - maybe there is an easier way.  I made the vegetarian version, and added some salt and spices to make up for it.

one thing Ive found as  a good extra (although maybe not the healthiest) is instead of sour cream, try a spoonful of miracle whip, if this sounds strange to you, then try it by taking just a cup of the borscht and adding just a drop, stir really good and then see what you think, i thought it would be weird the first time i tried it but my Russian friend made me, and im glad i did :)

Loved this. It's a great way to use a lot of root vegetables that may be sitting around in your fridge/pantry.  I'm not sure if this goes against the rules of what makes a borscht, but I added a little vinegar to taste, and found that it added a nice element to the soup.

This was the nicest borscht recipe I've ever used. I omited the can of diced tomatos and used leftover diced up garlic sausage instead of the pork sausage. I also used a couple of cups of chicken broth instead of water. It was so good and flavourful.

Really really good. I've had authentic Russian borscht before and this was fairly close. Not sure I got the seasoning quite right though... I used most of eatmedetroit's suggestions and my fiance ate 3 bowls... Delicious!

This was great, but I did make a few changes. I shredded the potatoes and carrots, and left out the sausage. I also added dill and caraway seeds. Even my cabbage-hating son liked it.

I followed the recipe but added aged vinegar instead of sugar and used dill instead of parsley as someone suggested. This is a real winner and one I will make again and again! In addition, it is low in fat and high in fiber! This really works with my lifestyle and freezes well too.

Beet borscht is one of my all-time favorite soups.  I start out with short ribs, braised and then covered with water and simmered for two hours along with a chopped onion, rather than the sausage...I have added sausage to the soup later, but find it a tad fatty for a soup base.  Also, I simply cannot make a beet borscht without adding a good 1/4 cup of chopped FRESH dill in the last half hour of cooking time. When I serve this soup, I add about a tablespoon of white vinegar to each bowl and a good dollop of sour cream...sounds weird, I know, but it is to die for, really!

It turned out amazing! I made this recipe for 15 people and they all loved it.  The only change I made was instead of sausage I used ground beef, and used both green and purple cabbage.  I would definitely make this again!

This soup has prompted me to write my first review. We have started a yearly "Borschtfest" and this recipe went over very well.  I would just use a more flavorful sausage than what I used.  Plus, I sliced the beets rather than grated them - gives more substance in the soup.

I used the shredded beets and followed the instructions which said to cook them until they've lost color.  I ended up with no broth or water left.  I ended up with a veggie salad.  Avoid this recipe unless you intend to make a lot of changes to it to make it work.

This is a very good borsch recipe.  

I omit the sausage completely, and cut down the amount of garlic.  

To the poster that commented on borsch always having meat - actually, in Ukraine during Lent there is a Lenten menu available in almost every restaurant with vegetarian meals listed.  It's common to not eat meat, at least on Fridays (though many avoid meat the entire 40 days), during Lent there.  So, vegetarian borsch is quite common at this time of year.  Otherwise, all borsch I came across while living there included beef, not pork sausage.

This is great! I have never had borscht before, and I love it. My Ukranian boyfriend says it is "not quite as good as moms"...go figure! He was devouring a bowl as he said it. I used 2 qt of water, and then ended up adding 2 c of water at the end- it was too thick once all of the veggies were in.

I liked this, although a lot of prep, with all the chopping, shredding, etc. Made a big batch of soup. I made changes based on the reviews (such as adding vinegar and dried dill, adding just half a can of tomato paste, boiling then peeling and shredding the beets and adding them to the soup at the end, substituting water from beet boiling plus some vegetable broth for the 2 qt. of water in the soup). My main comment, though, is you HAVE to use the sour cream--I was surprised how much it livened up the soup.

Good receipe.  I live in Ukraine for the last 5 years.  Another thing you can try is Chicken instead of sausage and shread your beets, and also, add a carrot shredded as well.  Plus, if you take your onion and cut it open and drop into the boiling water for 5 minutes before adding your sausage will add a little extra flavor then remove onion and dice, adding to your tomato paste with shreaded carrot as well.

This recipe was terrific! I've had vegetarian Borscht before and actually found it quite bland, but decided to try this recipe to use up the beets and cabbage from our farm CSA box. Both my husband and I had two bowls each, it was SO good. I did cheat a bit due to time (and not wanting to mess up another pan) - I cooked the onion with the pork (just used ground pork, seasoned with some salt and pepper), then added the water with the veggies in the order I chopped them up. I par-boiled the beets to help with peeling them before adding them to the soup. I didn't have chopped tomatoes on hand so I just used one can of garlic tomato paste, adding this in at the end with the fresh garlic, salt and pepper and one teaspoon of brown sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes then served with a sprinkling of fresh dill. My husband insists that I make this again - and since we get another vegetable delivery this week I think I will! Thanks!

Wow! First time ever eating Borscht… different than I thought it would be but very delicious.  I put in red cabbage instead or the green. I ate the sausage before I cooked the Borscht so ended up making it a vegetarian dish.  I bet this would be great with bacon.  Oh well, next time.

This is a top notch borscht recipe. I made it without the sausage and added 3T of olive oil for the fat. This is reminiscent of what they serve at Veselka on 2nd Ave. in New York.

My husband's background is Ukrainian so I wanted to find a recipe that was authentic. I didn't include the sausage this time as we had meat in our cabbage rolls, also left out sugar and potatoes (didn't have time to peel them). I did put in a beef cube to add a little more flavour and I basically just put all the ingredients in one pot at the same time and it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for this new and much easier borscht recipe.  My recipe is so time consuming that I very rarly make it - but now we will be able to enjoy this great soup more frequently.  My changes - I used 2 huge potatoes - diced and a small bag of baby carrots - diced - covered with ample water and cooked for abt 10 - 15 mins. Then added about 6 left over beets - diced.  I too used fresh tomates - and coleslaw - however next time I'll shred the cabbage - I found the coleslaw too stringy.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written but did add about a Tbsp of Dill Weed to the soup plus lots of pepper and a bit of salt. Cut the sugar down to abt 1/2 tsp but next time probably won't  use it at all or  will try a smaller amt.
Used plain yogurt and more dill weed for garnish.

This was EXCELLENT!  Even my husband, a card carrying member of the I-Hate-Beets Society, loved it!  Like a previous reviewer, I boiled the beets in their skins in the two quarts of water and then shredded them in my food processor after removing the skins.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to sautee the onions and I added the juice with the diced tomatoes instead of draining them.  I will definitely be making this soup again!!!  Thanks so much for a wonderful and very healthy recipe!

Wow wow wow!  When my boyfriend came home at lunchtime to find me peeling beets, he stoutly announced that I shouldn't be offened if he didn't like the "borscht," and if he didn't like it he wouldn't eat it.  Well, to my pleasure, he not only liked it BUT liked it enough to eat it again for lunch and dinner throughout the week!  I used a store bought bag of cole slaw mix, and cubed my potatoes and beets.  I didn't add the sugar to the whole pot, rather, I sprinkled the salt, pepper, and a LITTLE sugar on the individual servings.  I liked the sour cream, boyfriend wasn't into it.  Was a great soup, will definately use this recipe again and again when i have beets.

I really enjoyed this borscht. The only thing I had to adjust was the amount of liquid. The recipe calls for 2quarts and then 3/4c of water. I found the soup was too thick (I really like broth). At the end I added fresh dill and a dollop of sour cream in each bowl. Yummy!

This is a great recipe. I have never cooked with beets. I put them in the food processor because it was very difficult to shred them. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Will make again. Thanks.

First off, thank you for sharing this recipe. I’ve always wanted to try “real” Ukrainian borscht. I had cooked beets but hadn’t drained them when I cam across this recipe so I used the water that I’d cooked the beets in and added water to make about 7 cups. I peeled and shredded the beets (might've been about 2 cups worth) to add later. I peeled the sausage and chopped it to fry it in the pan. Cooked the onions separately the n added the tomato paste/water combination. I didn’t drain my diced tomatoes but that’s because I can my own with tomato juice and didn’t want to waste that good juice. I added chopped potatoes and shredded carrots to cook and when they were almost cooked I added the already cooked shredded beets and the cabbage. I didn’t have a head of cabbage so I used about 1/2 bag of shredded coleslaw mix.  I didn’t add sugar but mostly because I overlooked it and I’m not sure it was needed. Each to their own I suppose. The only ingredient I thought was missing was fresh dill and because I had just bought a bag of super fresh wonderful smelling dill I chopped about a handful of dill. This will be one of my favourite soups ever. It looks so pretty when the sour cream is mixed in. UPDATE:  I had a bowlful frozen and just tried it. Put this under the Freezes Beautifully column.

My boyfriend made this and it was super delicious.  Only modification was he used part spicy sausage.  He likes things with a kick.  If he hadn't, I'm sure it would be just as good.  Paired well with a nice crusty bread.

I’ve been eating and or making Borscht for 70 + years. My family came to the USA in 1900, so we know Borscht. This recipe has no dill in it. If there is no dill,...then it's not Borscht. You can change a lot of things in making Borscht but you must have Beets and Dill to even qualify as authentic borscht.
Also we normally made the stock the day before with browned and then very slowly cooked Ox Tail.

I made this soup last week, almost exactly as directed by the recipe (added a little less tomato and did add a little  dill and vinegar).  Served it for dinner, and the reaction was meh.  Not enough taste.  Put the rest away -- it makes a lot -- dreading eating the leftovers.  BUT when it came out of the fridge a couple days later, it wasn't meh.  It was yummy.   This may just be one of those recipes that is so much better the next day.

I liked it a LOT... but I had to fiddle with the ingredients in order to get a soup verses an EXTREMELY thick stew.  The ingredients really should be in grams in order to come out perfectly.  Mine still tastes great but I ended up having to add almost a full carton of Knorr vege broth to make it into soup.

Great recipe. I've used this recipe before! Excellent but  I use pork chops instead of sausage. I don't use diced tomatoes, only the paste. I like sour, so I add 1 cup of white vinegar and omit parsley but use fresh dill at the end. Pretty close to how my ukrainian mom made it. Don't add sugar. I add 3 cups of beef broth. I make it like a stew! Always taste better the next day !!! Smuchnoho ??

This is a pretty good recipe that I use as a starting point for my borsch.  I made a few changes. I don't use pork. I did add a little bit of sirloin in the bottom for my husband though. I added about 1 and a half bullion cubes to the water and added 2 more secret ingredients... It sounds gross, but I always add a little bit of ketchup and tabasco sauce. I think it takes it to the next level by adding a little more sweetness while also cutting the sweetness. Instead of parsley- I use a ton of dill, which is more traditional. I get a beautiful red color to it, and love to take it in my lunch for work with some smetana (sour cream)!

This recipe was delicious! Very similar to my mother-in-law's whose borscht is notorious as "best in town". This was my first time making it so would have liked a bit more detail ie. how long approx it would take for the color to cook out of the beets (about 50 mins) but otherwise good! I would make again.

I loved this recipe and gave it too friends who also raved about it. I had lots of produce from my CSA that I needed to use. The only thing I had to buy to complete this was the sausage. A great way to use all of the produce I had on hand. I'm making it again today.

I tried to follow the recipe closely, with the exception of using pork back ribs, which I cooked first then took off the bones and added to the soup.  I also gently cooked the beets, skin on, before peeling and shredding and I used the deep red cooking water as the base for the broth.  I added about two tablespoons of red wine vinegar as well, which I think is essential.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  It was good the first day, even better the next.  My kids loved it! I will use this recipe again. Might try using beef shank and beef broth next time.   Great recipe, thanks!!

This reminded me off my grandmother's borscht. Since I no longer eat meat, I used vegetable broth instead of half the water, and omitted the meat. I didn't think my grandmother used garlic in her recipe, so I omitted that as well. I also added a generous handful of fresh, chopped dill at the end and left out the parsley. Thanks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS! I doubled this recipe because I had lots of veggies on hand (thank god I used my huge stock pot). I omitted the sausage, used red cabbage (that's what I had in the fridge), and added 2 packages of chicken stock (the concentrated kind that's sort of a jelly texture). Served it with sour cream and fresh dill on top!

Made this soup many times after watching my Mother make it for years. She used to cook a piece of beef brisket for the stock first, but I choose to make mine meatless. She never added sugar, but did add lemon juice at the end for a tang. There used to be something called sour salt, but I haven't seen it in years to buy. Fresh dill and of course the sour cream was the final touch. Dad liked his potatoes cooked separately then added to the soup just before serving. Everyone has their own likes. I did cook my beets with the skin on first, then used the lovely red liquid for the stock. The skins slips off after simmering for an hour, then dice the beets.

Love the recipe. We don't use parsley for garnish, but add fresh dill to the soup, and on top of the sour cream as garnish if there is any left.

Very comforting dish!  I used only 3 sausages and bought pre-shredded cabbage.  Didn't think to get the pre-shredded carrots, that would have helped!  For my pot I added about 2 tablespoons of salt (this was about perfect).

This is a good start, but I definitely made some alterations. I used no meat. I boiled the beets in enough water to cover them for about 10 minutes to make them easier to peel. Then I kept about half of the water which was already a rich magenta and replaced the rest with beef broth. I also added some chopped beet stems and leaves which increased the beet flavor. I upped the quantity of fresh dill throughout the process. I added garlic powder and a dash of cumin and oregano and skipped the sugar.

My grandma was a native of the Ukraine, and this is the borscht that she made, minus the sugar and parsley. I suppose it's like anywhere else in the world where there are differing versions of the same dish according to the region and the chef. It was plenty close though, so this recipe is a keeper.

I love this stuff.  The only problem is your kitchen will be BRIGHT PINK!  Wear an apron and cover surfaces you don't want stained.  I have found that in particular, beet juice stains linoleum very easily.

It was good, no surprises – actually seemd a bit on the bland side to us.  I grated the beets as called for.  I was out of carrots so subbed  diced sweet potato.  Dairy allergy so left out sour cream.  All in all a good comforting soup, to go to five stars it would need another herb or two.  I agree with a few other comments, if you grate/shred the beets you shouldn’t cook them so long – they lose their color and that’s part of the fun of borscht – having magenta colored food!  Of course, if you don’t put them in first the broth probably doesn’t get as much beet flavor.

I used elk sausage instead of pork, coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil, and the rest of the ingredients from our garden.  This was absolutely wonderful!  I will keep this recipe for years to come.

This recipe turned out well, though it took much longer than 55 min!  Including peeling, shredding, and chopping everything, it took me 2 1/2 hours to prepare.  It wasn't labor intensive most of the time, just waiting for various things to boil, but be aware that it will take some time.

Amazing how well this turned out while still flying by seat of pants.  I boiled beets w/ skin on, and left cover off.  Thought I would need to add water, but it was fine. I think w/ so many hearty veggies coming together, you really can't mess this up too badly.  I bought some "stew meat" and braised in nasty red wine for a few hours and then threw in at the last minute.  It doesn't need the beef but it did add some more heft as a main dish.  No sugar, used beef broth as well, so didn't need additional sodium.  Really great soup.

i was just diagnosed with gallstones and was told beets are very good for gallbladder health ive never had a beet before this was my first time.  i was pleasantly surprised i did have to make changes im not supposed to eat cabbage or onions so i added baby spinach instead and a bit of onion powder. no sausage either since im also not allowed meat... it was very filling also

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I substituted ground turkey the sausage and used fat-free sour cream.  I also added about 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and maybe a tablespoon balsamic vinegar.  VERY YUMMY!

I have never made borscht before, but I was quite happy with the results. The only changes I made was that I omitted the sausage and added a good tablespoon of fresh dill. While grating the beets felt like a lot of messy work, I think it's a lot faster than other recipes which require you to boil them for an hour.

Delicious! I used eatmedetroit's suggested changes and it turned out amazing. Pretty easy to make too, I'm a very unexperienced cook but it turned out pretty much perfect.

Excellent recipe!  I made it just as written and it was delicious - excellent flavor.  I was pleased to see that it turned out quite thick - I remember it being a bit watery last time I had it.  I served it with dill which I think is key to the flavor, and with pumpernickel bread.  It makes a lot - I had quite a bit of leftovers... something to keep in mind when you are trying to figure out how to scale the recipe.

I decided to try the recipe as is instead of trying to combine all of the review comments.  I thought it was great!  I can't claim to be a borscht expert, but my husband and I thought it was great.  I doubled the recipe in a large pot and it turned out just fine.

Terrific recipe Patti. This is the first season I've grown beets in my garden in Calgary, Alberta, and was trying to figure out what to do with them. I didn't change a thing except cutting back on the liquid so it became more stew than soup, but it was still mighty tasty. Thanks. :)

This was a delicious soup!  Not quite what I expected (it was more tomato-y than I remember), but very hearty and filling.  Perfect for our mysteriously rainy day!

This was not good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't taste like anything at all.  I wondered when it started with water if stock should be used instead.  But, I assumed that all the veggies would flavor the soup.  WRONG!  I had to do some serious seasoning and added almost a cup of chicken broth powder before it tasted like anything other than water.  What a waste.

We substituted stew beef for the sausage, and I did not bother cooking the onions separate.  Overall it is a very good borscht recipe.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again! I made it vegetarian-style so omitted the sausage and also did not use any sugar - but it turned out wonderfully and was absolutely delicious.

I saw some great looking beets at the market and came home to figure out what to do with them. I then found this recipe! Fabulous flavor--young children said they liked it and hubby asked for it again next week. I took a reviewers reccomendation and used chicken stock in leiu of sausage, added kidney beans and the children ate it heaped with parmigiana cheese. (don't tell the kids but it's healthy as all get out!)

Very good soup recipe. I boiled my beets first, and then the peels just fall off.
It is much easier than peeling first. Thank you for a good beet recipe.

Great recipe! This is the second time I made it and I omitted the sugar, as it was too sweet before with it and skipped the tomato paste. We forgot to buy cabbage, so I used sauerkraut instead (but rinsed it in cold water first) It was a great substitute and gave it some extra flavor. I made the recipe without sausage b/c we are vegetarians. Goes great with sour cream, too!

This surprised me.  I had never used a beet canned or otherwise in my life and thought I would give it a whirl.  I really enjoyed this soup.  I used too much water and will cut back a bit next time.  Just get out your food processor and go to town - this is really easy and has a robust flavor. Thanks.

after making it I would have to say this is definitely a regional variation... likely more Russian my great grandmother says. We swap the garlic for dill and use seared pork ribs to make the stock. We dont shred our veggies aside from cabbage as we may spend a week eating a large pot. we usually make about 4x this recipe.

I made this for a dinner party of 8.  Every bowl was emptied and everyone had seconds.  So yummy.  First time for all of us to eat borscht.  I topped it with dill and sour cream because it said to do so in the recipe.  So good!

BEST BORSCHT EVER!  I have made many different beet soup recipes over the years.  The addition of an acidic ingredient (tomato) still allowed the beets to shine but removed the heavy, sometimes too earthy taste common to borscht.  I have never made borscht with meat before as this soup is generally a vegetarian dish served on December 24.  The added sausage raised the notch even higher.  My husband, who hates beets (and especially borscht) ate this soup.  'Nuff said.

One guest who was served this soup, indicated that she had been dreaming of a second bowl and hoped that we had leftovers; there is  no higher praise for a cook than that.  My wife wanted a second batch so we skipped hot pickled beets.  Do not omit the sour cream; I remove sour cream from everything, but it adds something to this dish...

Didn't have cabbage so used bok choy instead.  Also recipe is really only good if large amount of sour cream added per serving. It's fine.

I've recently got engaged to a Latvian and he requested for his birthday that I make him Borscht. 

This was my first time making it. I prepped all of the shredded, peeled, and chopped items first. I used sweet pork sausage. I got a tip from his mom, which is to pan fry the shredded beets using the left over sausage grease. I cooked the beets for about 8 mins before tossing it in the pot.

My future husband's words: "Babe, this is some of the best borscht I've had."

Fantastic! Very satisfying and good looking presentation. Very good the next day; everything changes to a uniform red. Freezes well. 
I used mild Italian sausage and it was excellent. A Russian friend said his mother added paprika or red pepper in the winter or if they were sick. 
Made it once with turkey sausage. It was very bland. Even adding 1/2 lb of Ialian. Sausage didn't help it. Just don't use turkey or chicken if you want flavor.

I actually canned the vegetables without the sausage. When  we were ready to eat it, we used kielbasa, cooked that, and had the vegetables over the keilbasa.

This was very good - I doubled it up and used butter to sautee the onions (and added some celery as it had it to use up).  Also added 500 ml of chicken broth as it looked like I had too much veggies for the amount of liquid.  Ended up with a giant stock pot brimming with it!  Yummy!

The pork sausage is a delicious twist on the traditional beef. Did not add sugar, squeezed a little lime into each bowl instead. Had to cook the soup about 40 minutes longer for the potatoes and cabbage to be tender

I made this.  It was definitely not like my grandmothers.  I did not like everything shredded, it was more like a stew than a soup because of the tomato paste. It tasted too much like tomatoes.  I made it again without the paste, and shredded only the beets to bring out the color and left the paste out.  I liked it much better.  I also made it from homemade chicken stock, and added a Tb or 2 of chicken soup base.

my girlfriend is from Ukraine, we use no sausage  only chicken breast, potatoes, carrots, beets;nor tomato sauce, only ketchup the size of a silver dollar. fry all the onions until they are transparent, then add. Fry the beets then add. add carrots and potatoes, chicken cubed, and chicken broth. You may need to add more chicken broth;then the ketchup. i'll double check the recipe i wrote it down, but its very simple, and its delicious. frying the beets gives them a beautiful shine and adds flavor. very simple Yep that's it. Everyone makes it different.

I substituted for a lot of things simply because I didn't have them. I only used one carrot, not three. Four beets, not three. Two tablespoons of heavy cream when it called for none (highly recommended for extra body/flavor). I added A LOT more sugar than what it called for until it tasted right. Didn't have any parsley so I used a bit of dried basil and FRESH DILL (super good). And I didn't have any quality pork sausage so I fried bacon and crumbled it over the top along with the sour cream as a garnish at the end. I would actually recommend all these changes because the soup turned out to be fantastic. However, in the future, I'd probably increase the carrots a bit and only use 3 beets :)

Followed some of the other reviews and left off the sausage, used tomato sauce (what I had), red onion,  1/2 chicken 1/2 beef stock, dill and probably more sea salt than is good for me. Diced everything and left out the cabbage. I like it a lot, but will probably look for a beet recipe with beef.

I made it twice and added more meat. Bison. Ground church,  and fresh grass fed  ground  sausage and more veggies made it even better. My husband preferred it more as Chunky Stew than a soup.

I modified this recipe to make it vegan. Instead of pork sausage, I used Light Life Gimme Lean Veggie Sausage. I didn't have any cabbage or crushed tomatoes, so I just used the 6 oz. can of tomato paste and I added 1/4 of a large chopped rutabaga and added one extra cup of water to compensate for the crushed tomatoes. I also added 1 tbsp red wine vinegar ( I highly recommend doing this!). I garnished with Tofutti Sour Cream and some fresh chopped Italian parsley and served with rosemary potato bread. Yummy!

My main question is... WHERE'S the DILL???

Other than that, I liked it. The sausage was a surprising new twist. I liked it. I omitted the tomatoes, but would like to try it with them, next time. I'm yet another person who has spent time eating Borscht in Russia. 

Lovely soup. Thanks!

Delicious! I am a vegetarian, so I did it without the meat, and it was really satisfying. But it was really annoying to prep. I wound up using a food processor for most of the “shredded” parts. This certainly isn’t something I’ll be making on a regular basis, but I can see making it on special occasions.

This is the best borscht I have ever tasted.  The recipe was super easy to follow and the results were fantastic.  I love the flavor that the sausage added.  I did use vegetable broth instead of water to add a little richness to the soup.  Also used fresh dill on top of sour cream for garnish,  tastes much better than parsley.  my family LOVED it!!  highly recommend this recipe

AMAZING!!! I used 2lbs bone-in beef chuck to make beef stock instead of pork, and had to use 2 pots bc i don’t have one big enough.  This is so so so good with the fresh dill and sour cream!

I first followed the recipe as written and was disappointed with it tasting bland, but then I added a lot of salt, sugar, garlic, pepper,and dill, and it tasted better.  Then I tried it again a few hours later after the pot cooled off and it was amazing!  Somehow just sitting all the flavors melded.  I wish the recipe included an approximate amount of salt, since it's such a huge pot.  I found I ended up adding at least 2 tablespoons before it wasn't bland, but I was doing it a half tsp at a time so it took a while.

Awful. Strong tasting raw garlic overpowered crunchy uncooked cabbage. Blech! Skip the gatlic and skip the cabbage and youve got a starting point. This batch gets flushed diwn the toilet.

OK, I never worked with beets before and quite honestly, I did not know if I or my family would like them.  But we found some at the farmers market and my daughter wanted to try.l  So I found this recipe.  Honestly, it looked a bit red but.. OMG it was so delicious I could not believe it.  DId not have pork sausage so I made the vegetarian version.. SO delicious!   Followed the recipe exactly.  Well, I did not measure but... Thank you for a new family favorite!

I not only liked the soup,  I had two guests  that also liked the vegetarian style borscht.   The only alterations I made was I used half of a medium sized sweet potato Instead of 3 potatoes because that’s what I had and I used half a can of tomato paste. I served it with a dollop of plain yogurt instead of sour cream and a hard garlic roll.  I will make it again!!!

I used only 1/2 a package of sausage, well drained and rinsed with hot water. Instead of water I used chicken bone broth for more flavor. I used a decent amount of fresh dill-3tbs in the soup and more for on top. And I also added 3tbs of red wine vinegar (which I had noticed used on other borscht recipes).

I made this exactly as this recipe says and it turned out great! I'm wondering if some kind of herb would be good in it... some say dill? I might try that next time.

Because I live with a vegan, I left out the meat. I added sour cream to my bowl rather than the pot and didn't miss the meat at all.

This is the first time I made Borscht. We had it when we were in Russia and Poland. This recipe is good and I made a vegan version of it using vegan sausage. I don't think it needs the meat. It would be so clean without the meat. It really tastes good but I think it would taste better without the sausage. I would make this again. It does not look like the picture because the beets are shredded. I will also add less veggies to make it more like a soup and less like a stew! My beets were huge! Thank you so much!

This will do but this is not a traditional borsht, it is a family recipe 
normally you would :
1) add beans; soak large beans for a day and then add it to boiled ribs
2) cook it with ribs for meat (boil them for half an hour before all other ingredients are added)
3) on skillet add long slices of beets as well-> it brings the taste
4) add 2-3 bay leaves 15 min before borsht is done. 

To make it vegetarian: 
instead of meat add mushrooms or do not add anything, usually that what people do for fasting, it is tasty in veg option as well.
Serve it with:
Take a piece of bread and brown it from 2 sides in olive oil, as soon as it cools down a bit, grind a clove of garlic on it; add minced dill on a top of soup bowl

The only reason to cook the Pork is for the flavour of the frond (meat caramelized) why not do it in the heavy bottomed soup pot? The instructions above throw it away by leaving it in the pan? Seasoned meat, liberally salted and peppered, gives more flavour. De glaze the soup pot with a little red wine, beer or any spirits, or meat or vegetable stock, or diced onion, garlic (celery, fennel bulb, bell pepper, shredded horse or other radish) tomato paste (for Umami) and any of the above liquids. Cook for a few minutes till softened then add your liquid (water or stock).
Parboiling or blanching the cabbage will reduce the flatulent gaseousness of this veg. Don't peel the beets if you're going to shred them especially, you throw away the flavor, color and all the best food value.  All the Ukrainians I've known, do not use tomatoes they use a splash of vinegar.  The acidity of the tomatoes should hold the rich color of the beets, you can also add some vinegar here to set color and give the soup a little kick. I add a splash of dill pickle juice. Dill fiends will also lace the soup with copious amounts of Dill weed when adding the tomatoes or the last 10-20 minutes of cooking. IMHO

The  things I changed were to substitute cross cut beef shortribs for the sausage, parsnips for potatoes,  and I  omitted the dairy garnish and the sugar.  (I made it Paleo-style.)  I also chopped the beets into cubes rather than grating them, since I didn't feel like cleaning up the hot pink kitchen crime scene.   As I've never had Borscht before,  I cannot comment on authenticity, but this recipe makes a subtle-tasting, delicious, velvety-rich stew.  The jewel-toned red color adds a visual that elevates the dish.  It's a new favorite.  I'll definitely make this again when I have sausage on hand.

I've just started cooking again now that I am retired and have the time. I try to follow recipes exactly, since I feel like an absolute beginner again. I made a couple small mistakes with this one: did not put in the potatoes and cabbage and diced tomatoes when I was supposed to. In spite of that, it was absolutely delicious! Only problem is I now have a huge pot of borscht despite cutting the recipe in half!

I will definitely make this soup again, though I changed a few things. I left out the tomato paste, as someone else suggested, and I garnished it with dill rather than parsley. I think I would like to try it with no meat and pureeing the final product., for a chilled summer soup.

Really balanced flavor!   Not overpowering beetiness as some are.   A really good way to introduce someone to this style of soup.   I used very mild pork sausage.   A very good and nutritious soup.   Fresh dill would be a nice addition

This was delicious!! It was my first time having Borscht and it won't be my last!  I boiled my beets for 1 hour and then pealed and shredded them.  I used 4 beets for more beet flavor as others felt like the beer flavor was weak. I left out the tomatoes past and tomatoes as I was told from a Ukrainian, she had never had tomatoes in hers.  I left out the sugar as was recommended by many and I added Apple cider vinegar 1 TBSP and a handful of chopped fresh dill at the end.  I served this with crusty garlic bread...so good!!

This is a excellent Borscht soup!  After reading many of the reviews I chose to leave out the meat and boil the washed beets in the water used for the soup (to easily remove the skin and grate).  Taste is good the first day,  it's amazing the second day after the flavors marry and get happy!

I'd never had borscht before, but this looked so easy, I decided to give it a try.  Turns out I like borscht, which is good, because this recipe made about two week's worth of lunches.  Not sure how "authentic"  it is, but it certainly is delicious.

Used red cabbage and Yukon Gold potatoes.  Came out very tasty.  Too time consuming to make often, but makes a lot, so I wound up freezing half to eat later.

As does everyone, I had a few changes, but minor.
This is a soup after all! I've made this 2 times. 
First time I cooked, drained and rinsed the sausage then deglazed the pan. I cannot digest excess grease. Second time I made my own beef stock from soup bone. The goal here really is a nice broth base.
I didn't peel the beets or any vegetables, just scrubbed well with veg brush.. Personal preference. Can't understand why you would throw all that flavour and nutrition away.  
I don't have a food processor so I cheat. I used a mandolin to julien slice 4 beets. I added them to 1 liter of beef broth and 2 liters of water and set them to boil for 15 minutes.  I then diced an onion, julienned 6 potatoes, 4 cloves garlic and added them with all the contents of a 16oz can of diced tomatoes. I brought to a boil again for 15 minutes.  I generously added pepper at each stage with a small amount of salt to taste.  I used no sugar or tomato paste. ( again...personal preference). I then added 2 bags of redi mixed Cole slaw(Red and green cabbage and carrots...750g total) and a little fresh cilantro. Parsley is ho-hum. Fresh dill would be my first choice. All are OK depends on your personal preference.
I then seasoned with salt and pepper to taste again and simmered till cabbage and potatoes were at desired tenderness.
Served in bowl with sour cream and fresh dill and fresh warm rolls for soaking up that awesome jus!

This recipe was good, with several changes.  I followed the other review's advice and skipped the sugar, halved the tomato paste and used 4 large beats instead of 3 medium ones, and added about a quarter cup of port wine, turned half the water into beef broth via bullion cubes, and doused it with at least 2-3 tbsp of dill.  All of that you can be pretty confident of before tasting it.  

I always 'fix' everything i cook at the end by tasting it, and then smelling various available spices to decide if they complement it.  During the taste it/smell it phase, I found the borscht loves smoked paprika, basil and black pepper.   It also needed salt to taste, and adding rosemary was interesting in the borscht, but I kept that to about 1 tsp.  All the others, add, stir stir, taste, repeat...

After reading a few of the comments, I made some tweaks to this recipe. I added chopped dill at the end when I added the garlic.  I also didn't add the sugar,  but did add some aged white wine vinegar (apron 1/4 cup).  That gave it a little bit of a zing,  which it seemed to need.  Also I needed to add more liquid -perhaps my veggies were bigger than medium.  I decided to add about 1 c of chicken broth.  The sausage I used was Italian mild and it was not a greasy sausage like some have commented on. Not sure if there would have been a better optioon for flavour,  but that's what I had on hand.  I removed meat from the casings and fried it,  leaving it in fair size chunks so it wouldn't break down while in the soup.  I also added the sausage when I put the carrots in, and it stayed in nice big chunks, even the next day when we had leftovers.  My husband loved the soup and really like the sausage it. I will definitely make this again. This makes a huge pot of soup. I froze some,  gave some to a friend and still had leftovers for today.

I made some changes to the prep, cooking time to reduce liquid e ... I used beef broth in place of water and beer to cook the pork, I also used fresh tomato's & red beets from the garden so that was an added time of 1 hour to the prep of the dish... In all cooking time was 2.5 hours, but wow this was a great soup!!!

Very hearty and delicious. I added extra garlic and omitted the meat. Followed the directions accordingly otherwise. Make sure you have lots of sour cream, this really makes the dish pop!

Wow! Deeeelicious! I used to work at a Russian spa in Miami beach where there was a Russian cafe. Their soups were out of this world and this recipe is the closest recipe I've found to their borscht. My Colombian husband said he'd never had anything like it before and just loved it.  You really don't need to add sugar...it is naturally sweet from the beets and cabbage. I did add the honey because it goes so well with apple cider vinegar. I will be making this again and again!!

Wow! Tasty, filing and beautiful! I am on a low sodium diet so I used low sodium chicken broth, low sodium cubed ham steak instead of sausage and did not add additional salt. Even with those changes this soup is very addicting. Oh yes I most definitely will make this time and again! I  want to share this treasure with guests as well as family......

My young son asked me to make this recipe, which surprised me a bit.  I grew up near the borscht belt, was never a fan, but I'll do anything for him.  I made this exactly as the recipe called for, it makes a boatload of soup, but it was excellent.

My family loved it, this time we didn't use any sugar at all, I was really surprised at the taste.  I love it.  I am sure that the sausage has a lot to do with it, I used Lightlife vegan gimme lean meatless veggie sausage, and it was so good! I will definitely make it again! the sour cream adds that last final kick of taste!

Very good. I used golden and "bullseye" beets from my garden instead of the dark red ones from the store. Added sausage, I used a paper towel to soak up grease before adding to pot. I omitted the sugar and used a few dashes of both apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar instead. I added them a dash at a time to taste.  Cut up some tomatoes instead of using canned ones, and used tomato sauce instead of paste. Lots of salt & pepper added to taste. I have no dill, but it was still SO delicious with parsley and sour cream. VERY good, and I have enough to freeze! I will keep this one on hand.

I made this without meat. I peeled then sliced the beets thinly and boiled them with the carrots and potatoes. Didn't add garlic but added some vinegar for an extra zing. When done I garnished with a dollop of plain yogurt and fresh dill.  So delicious.

Any beet soup is yummy!  This recipe is good, but I've never heard of sausage in borscht, so I ommitted it.  I'm not used to potatoes in borscht, but they were awesome.  And I added a fair bit of dill.  My ukranian in-laws would string me up if I didn't.   This is a good basic recipe.  Tweaked a little, perfect.

Added a bit of vinegar to taste instead.
Lots of fresh dill instead of parsley....to finish as well as a garnish.
Only 1/2 can of tomatoes added to onions, deglazed with red wine then added to soup.
Used 2 medium fresh tomatoes instead of canned, blanched, peeled and chopped.
Used olive oil instead of vegetable.
Had sausages on the side (bbq'd with homemade pierogies as a main - yumm-O!)

Great soup - would make again!

The amount of tomato paste and carrots obliterates the beets, and its not especially appetizing in its overall look.  Complete bait and switch and waste of time.

Had borscht once and I loved it... but then had it at a polish restaurant and hated it! It made me realize there are MANY ways to make borscht and it's very possible your going to like one and not the other. I loved this one because it had pork in it and the earthy beet flavor was not overpowering. The polish borscht i had was very overpowering with beet flavor and i realized that's what i dont' like-- and also why many people probably don't like Borscht. This one, however, was great! I used 2 large hot Italian sausage links out of the casing. Next time I will put 1 more link in there. Not too greasy with the pork... After i dumped the pork in the water, some oil accumulated at the top and i just skimmed it out. For the cabbage, i got pre-shredded coleslaw mix. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly swapping out dill for parsley. It was great! I did try one of the other recommendations of adding a bit of balsamic vinegar at the end - and that was a nice touch. I may also try to add a chicken bullion cube to the water just to see what happens. Otherwise great recipe and I recommend it!

My spouse loved this soup so I gave it 4 stars. He loved the sausage & tomato in the Borscht. While I enjoyed it too, I prefer a borscht that tastes more like beets. Made the recipe exactly as stated - we both thought it needed more salt. Next time I may use a beef or chicken broth base.

Half a pot or 2 quarts of water was too much and made the soup bland.  Had to add more dill, soup base, salt, pepper and lemon juice then boil to reduce it.  After all that, it was tasty.  Will start with 2-4 cups of water next time.

YUM!  A great hearty, tummy warming soup for cold winter nights! I disagree with earlier reviews...the added ground pork does NOT make it greasy.  Used Beef Broth instead of water to up flavor. Added dill as suggested by others to pump up flavor too! Served with Perogies for a VERY well liked meal. my family of 5 (three young kids) loved it!

This is a great recipe!! I recommend it to anyone just as it is.To make it more like my Mother"s recipe, I cooked and added a cup of dry white kidney beans,4 tbsp fresh  Dill,juice of a half lemon,2 tbsp Balsamic vinegar,and 4 Bay leaves.I would have added some beet kvas ,as that would have added some nice tartness, but you have to make that a month ahead of time. This would partner perfectly with Potato Varenyky( aka Pierogi)

This was my first try at borscht and my whole family loved it! I roasted the beets in the oven in foil with olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme. Then I skinned them and grated them. Then i used 8 cups of beef stock and used dill instead of parsley. I used a jar of red pickled cabbage instead of fresh. No need to add sugar. Plenty of flavor! Will definitely make it again!

update... have made this for many native Russians now and they all love it!

Excellent!  I've made this vegan once and once with pork sausage and I absolutely prefer VEGAN.  Great use of fall/winter vegetables.  Substituted vegetable broth/bouillon for the water for extra flavor and next time will throw in a couple more potatoes.  Huge hit with the boyfriend and his fam :)

Good and healthy soup. I did it without sausage. Next time I will add some spices to give more taste. I also shredded the vegetable too much. Next time I will just cut them in chunks.

Very good soup! Than goodness for a food processor! I followed some of the other reviews and added the chicken bouillon and only half the tomato paste.

This soup is FANTASTIC.   I too left out the sausage - I also added almost a liter of veggie stock in addition to the water called for.  After my husband and I ate some in its rustic, chunky state, I decided to blend up the left overs.  That's how you take something rustic and make it chic!  It has an amazing smell and texture and is completely addictive  as a smooth soup!  YUMMY!

I didn't put the pork in it and thought it was rather bland regardless of how much I tried to improve the taste with spices. I will try putting ham or making a broth next time.

I guess w/ a borscht I was expecting a dark red soup with a pronounced beet flavor. This recipe came out more like a winter vegetable soup. The flavor was of the vegetables (all of them) and the color was dark brown.

Out of all the borscht recipes on this website, this one is the closest to authentic!  Take out the meat (for sure!) half the tomato paste, and add WAY more parsley .

I was a little sceptical about this soup because both my mother and my sister had both tried making it, and ended up throwing it out. I find it a bit sweeter then im used to but the sourcream evens it out. I find out the time given for the soup is misleading, it took me two and a half hours to make this soup the first time, of course my beets were home grown and had to be boiled and skinned which added an hour. Can the soup be frozen?

Wow wow wow. The recipe is so easy to follow and the results are pretty unforgettable.  I enjoy my soup on the chunkier side so I diced the beets and I switched out the potatoes for some cooked pasta. I served it hot for dinner last night and served it cold as an addition to brunch.  Bravo!

Fantastic!!! The only thing that I did differently was to dice all of the veggies instead of shredding them for a chunkier soup. In the summer, I like to eat this cold with sliced cucumber, sour cream, and LOTS of dill! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good.  The only thing I changed was I didn't use the parsley.  I added probably a tbsp or so of fresh dill.  My husband says it's better than my Mom's borscht - but don't tell her that!

I'm used to Borscht with no meat or potatoes, so I left them out.  No sugar either.  I loved it!  And the soup has gorgeous color to boot!

Excellent - authentic and close to what my husband's Ukranian family makes.  I would leave out the garlic next time, and add a whole lot of dill.  Otherwise the texture and colour was perfect

This was absolutely wonderful!  I never bought a beet in my life and had no expectations of what Borscht tasted like.  I used the whole cabbage and didn't peel the potatoes.  It was like the best vegetable soup ever (only with pork).  We just loved this and couldn't get enough of it --hot or cold!  Thank you for a "forever" recipe!

I used turkey sausage to cut down the fat.  This is very mild and requires a fair amount of salt and pepper to have some life.  It seems serving size of 10 is pretty accurate.
