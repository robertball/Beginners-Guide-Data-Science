This had good flavor, but was too much work.  If I make it again, I'm just going to use instant lemon pudding.  My cooked pudding turned out lumpy, even though I was constantly stirring.

I might be biased because I have a taste for pudding dishes, but this was a great idea, and the flavors mixed wonderfuly

I always buy fresh cherries in bulk while they are in season.  I pit them with a hand tool cherry pitter that I bought at Crate n Barrel, and then bag them up in quart sized ziplocs, then put them in the deep freeze.  This way I have fresh cherries all year long!  Canned cherries are ok but FULL of icky preservatives.

Very yummy and so simple to make.  Everyone loves it and am always having someone ask for the recipe.
