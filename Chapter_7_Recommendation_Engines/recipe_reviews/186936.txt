I made the cookies and left out the Bourbon completely, they turned out GREAT! I also left out coconut and pecans in the end, but everyone who ate these absolutely loved them! I've already gotten a request to make these again for the holidays. This is a super easy recipe to use with any cake mix/icing combination. I'm going to try others at some point!

Delicious! I used a teaspoon of vanilla in place of the bourbon, fat free cream cheese for the icing, and left out the coconut completely. I love these! This frosting is pretty runny- I recommend leaving out the liquid. I have also tried these topped with a cream cheese frosting and pecans rather than as a sandwich, but they're just not as fun (or pretty) that way. I love how the cookie texture is not very cake like - it's super moist and really tastes like a cookie! Can't wait to try this with a carrot cake mix!This is definately a keeper.

I made these for a bake sale @ work and boy they went fast!  They are absolutely the best cookies you will ever eat.  I only made one subsitution.  Instead of bourbon, I used buttermilk.  This is a must try!!

These were a HIT at my office.  They were gobbled up in about 30 seconds!  I left the bourbon, coconut & pecans out.  Next time I may make 1/2 with pecans and 1/2 without.  Also, I used regular milk instead of evaporated (just because I didn't want to open a whole can for 2 tsp.)  I'm making them again this week!

Edited:  I tried this around Easter using Carrot Cake mix instead of Red Velvet and they were equally delicious !!

Cookies are soft and chewy and the frosting has a perfect texture! (I excluded the evaporated milk)  I made this recipe today for a Christmas cookie exchange, only I substituted devil's food for the red velvet and excluded the burbon. Then I added peppermint extract to the frosting and rolled the cookies in crushed candy canes instead of pecans. Yummy!

These were so easy and everyone liked them very much. I did use the cooked icing from another recipe on this site (Red Velvet Cake by Eleanor Johnson) since I consider that the ultimate icing for red velvet anything. Will make again soon - Thanks!

These are delicious and beautiful! I left out the bourbon in the mix. I measured my dough with a 1/2 tbsp to make each cookie uniform in size. The cooking time was perfect at 8 minutes for my oven. I did not add evaporated milk, coconut or nuts to the icing. These need to be refrigerated. They taste better if you let them get to room temperature before eating.

I made these exactly as directed.  I thought they were awesome.  Crunchy on the outside and still chewy.  Amazing frosting.  My 17 year old son said they were the best cookie he ever tasted!  The only suggestion I would make is to make smaller cookies.  I made walnut sized and came out with only 36 cookies, making 18 of the finished product.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

All I can say is....WOW!! These are my new favorite cookie!!! So easy to make, and soooo delicious! Made them for a cookie exchange, and for every holiday gathering with family....they were a huge hit everywhere I took them. All I did different was leave out the bourbon & the coconut. DELISH!

I'm a pretty easy sell on most things. With food, I'm certainly not picky. But there was something about the taste of these cookies that was kinda meh to me. I cut down the oil to 1/3 c. and made the frosting for this recipe and I definitely wasn't crazy about it. I then made the cream cheese frosting from McCormick's Red Velvet Cupcakes recipe on this site which incorporates sour cream and that DEFINITELY amped it up a notch -- really nice tang at the end and sooo much tastier. After I finish off this batch I probably won't make again. **UPDATE** I am upgrading to a 5 after bringing these to a get together last night -- the icing for the Red Velvet Cupcake recipe definitely was a hit, and instead of sandwiching the cookies to make whoopie pies, I just put a thick layer of icing on top of a single cookie and it was delicious! Perhaps there was too much cookie for the icing to balance out the taste. This was just right.

I made these for my Christmas cookie exchange and they were a big hit!  I omitted the coconut because not everyone likes it.  I drizzled them with white chocolate and they looked really cool.  I did find that it was easier to roll in the pecans after I chopped them in the food processor.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Easy and good recipe.  I used vanilla chips instead of the frosting, because I wanted a cookie that didn't need to be refridgerated.

Delicious, simple, easy to make small adjustments (i.e., swap vanilla in place of bourbon). Yummy!

Warning: these are so addicting! One of the easiest and quickest recipes. I omitted the bourbon and used store bought frosting. They were delicious as a stand alone cookie or a sandwich. Probably could have used a tiny bit less oil than what was called for. I do have to say that these were only enjoyable the first day of baking. They took on a different flavor after that which I didn't care for.

Well, I did the 1 inch balls, and they turned out huge, so I will probably do a little smaller next time. This seemed to be a crowd pleaser at work, but I thought they were just too big. I used sprinkles intend of nuts

I made these for our neighbors and I received a call from them after dropping the cookies off- she said she was going crazy out of her mind with how amazing they were.  Quick and easy, but oh-so-yummy, I will be making these for Easter tomorrow!  Next time I will try making the red velvet from scratch.

I made these last night for my bf and he was a little hesitant to try them. Once he bit into them, he was in heaven. Def will make this again. Only one substitution made and that was replaced buttermilk for the bourbon. Oh...wait, no pecans just cause I'm not a huge fan of any nuts in cookies.

These were awesome!  I did not use the bourban or the coconut or pecans (but will try those two next time) and they were fabulous!  I made some bigger in size and some smaller because they are very rich.  I kept them in the refrigerator and the cookies got nice and soft and I thought they tasted better the second day!  Yum!

Just made these cookies with my 5yo son... They were fantastic! We came up with tons of ideas to use these cookies for Christmas.  On the first batch we did the plain sandwich with frosting in the middle, but thought during the holidays we could roll the frosting in green sprinkles to make them festive!  We also put andes candies pieces in with the frosting for a mint-y cookie- those were my son's favorite! Then on the last batch we mixed in white chocolate chips and will leave them as cookies alone.  The possibilities are endless! Thanks!

The amount of oil seemed too high so I cut it down to 1/4 cup and then slowly added some water until the batter was the right texture. If you want puffy cookies you have to spoon smaller batter drops; the bigger the cookie the flatter it gets. Taste great and everyone loved them!

Delicious! But next time I want to make them bigger, like a tablespoon size or bigger. Because they weren't big and puffy, just flat like a cookie. I used cream cheese frosting recipe from this website instead of the one on here.

Easy & tasty.  I made a double batch of cookies & did not double the filling.  I had enough filling for all but four sandwiches & those I filled with ice cream instead.  A delicious alternative! As others have said, you could easily leave the bourbon out all together.  I substituted Chambord & that worked out well too.

I love red velvet cake...but VERY picky.  There are few good recipes out there...and as a cookie - this one's a winner.  It's hard to mess up, which I love.  I did leave out the bourbon, coconut, pecans (because of nut allergies, and used a splash of milk instead of the evaporated.  For 50 - michelan star restauraunt chefs...this was the first cookie to go.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  These are very soft and sugary (with the icing).  I chose to leave out the coconut and pecans.  They were not missed!  The cookies make for a beautiful presentation.

Wow... these are amazing! I bake a lot of stuff (and I mean a LOT), but these are serious stand-outs. Everyone raved about them. They're really pretty too, making them a great addition to any cookie tray. The only change I made was to omit the pecans, just because I forgot to buy them. I'll definitely make these again. Thanks! :)

I am making these for a cookie swap this weekend instead of the filling listed i am making my own cream cheese frosting I may crush up some candy canes to toss in and a few drops of green food coloring if i am feeling crazy.  I also left out the bourbon BUT I added about 2 teaspoons of peppermint extract instead...they smell amazing and are very festive cant wait to try one!!!

These were so easy to make, and so delicious to eat.  My daughter took most of these to an early holiday party, and she reported that everyone loved them and that I should have made more.  Because I was making these for kids, I omitted the coconut and pecans.  These would work with just about any cake mix, and I think lemon with a lemon cream filling or spice cake with a cream cheese filling would be wonderful.  But the red velvet is perfect for the holiday season!  Great, easy recipe!

Everything about this was easy! We didn't have bourbon so I also sub'd with vanilla. I also skipped the icing cuz i never liked those "double doozie" you got at the mall. Lol All the boys loved them and they are the chosen cookie of the house!

I made these as directed for Christmas- My familly loved them! Since then, I have made them using 4 different kinds of cake mix- they always come out great! Devils food has been the favorite so far, they take a little longer to bake, but come out like soft & fudgey brownies!

Delicious. As much as I hate it when people change everything and review anyway, I'm going to do it. I used chocolate cake mix with a dash of vanilla and made the icing as is-with food coloring, but without the coconut. They were fantastic and team colored for the Superbowl, my team lost, but the cookies were a huge hit-I'm so excited to try them with different mixes-and I think I've got a new go-to cream cheese icing recipe.

This recipe was 1. easy and 2. incredible! One of my favorite cookies ever! I must say my version lacks a lot of the things in the original: bourban, coconut and pecans... but I used chocolate chips and they were a hit.

These sandwich cookies are fantastic! Not only do they taste great, they are very attractive and make a great presentation. I've given them as gifts in clear cellophane bags, tied with ribbon. If you're in a hurry, substitute store bought cream cheese icing for the homemade.

Yum-Yum-Yum!! These were so easy! I made them for my father in law for Christmas and they were a hit! I did not use this icing recipe. I used a very old "mystery icing" recipe from the 60's that belonged to his mother. Delish!

The texture of these cookies is great!  Follow the cooking instructions exactly and you will have a great cookie.  The end result is pretty good.  I would try these first before you debut them.  They tasted good at first but when I revisted them a few hours later, they were missing something.  I honestly think it is the red velvet box mix that needs help, it's bitter compared to other red velvets.  I used this concept with a lemon supreme cake mix with homemade white chocolate icing and it was a far superior cookie.  I might try spice cake mix too.

These cookies are pretty good. I had to pass on the coconut and pecans because the cookies were to take to my daughter's preschool and no nuts were allowed in the food. This recipe was easy to make but the amount of icing here is way too much, I had half of it left at the end. I would suggest to cut the icing ingredients in half.
I can't believe I haven't made these for 6 years !  My daughter is now a 5th  grader and I am making them again for her school's bake sale. 
I doubled the recipe but kept the icing ingredients the same and still had leftover icing. I am posting many pictures of these cookies  being made

This is good but incredibly rich. masking smaller cookies is better. I used a tsp measure to portion the cookies & baked for about 41/2 minutes.  I also didnt really like the icing. Too tangy and too sweet. Made a second batch with another frosting recipe (buttercream).

The frosting was grainy and the cookies themselves had an unappealing flavor. I followed the instructions exactly as they were because i am very OCD like that. I will never make them again unless i use my own homemade recipes of frosting and red velvet cake cookies.

I have a serious sweet tooth. Even so, these are WAY too sweet for my liking!  The Icing recipe could easily be cut in half.  I was very generous with the amount of icing in the sandwiches and still ended up with 2 cups left over.  Probably won't make this one again.

Made these yesterday for a potluck with RAVED reviews. One friend who doesn't eat much literally scarfed 3 of these within 5 mins. I reduced the powered sugar for the icing to 2 cups b/c the red velvet cookies themselves were plenty sweet. I agree that walnut sized dough balls were probably a little bit large although no one seemed to complain! I put less of the filling in the cookies (they weren't fluffy or as pretty as the picture on the recipe). I wonder if anyone has actually mixed the nuts inside the icing so it makes the filling mixture look taller inbetween the cookies. Will definitely make again!!!

I thought these were fantastic! The only thing I did a little different was the filling - I used sour cream instead of butter and left out the wet ingredients, and we use walnuts on our red velvet so we added some walnuts to the filling before topping with the other cookie- only because we like the flavor but they are prettier just red and white. They are moist - eat them fast before they go bad!{{like thats a problem}} I also used this as a "base", if you will, to make dark chocolate cake cookies with peanut butter filling... yum yum yum ... and now im trying key lime :D I have to say that I like this recipe the best because the batter is not runny and not stiff enough to roll and cut - I use the larger side of a melon baller to scoop a slightly rounded little scoop - it makes the perfect size cookie in my opinion- with such a caloric treat you really dont want these huge cookies so its much easier to watch the cookie intake of myself and my son!

I love this recipe and so does everyone else I have made it for! 
I only made a couple of substitutes, I added melted coconut oil for the vegtable. I used carrot cake mix, and milk chocolate mix. I did in fact for the first trial of making this recipe use red velvet cake mix. Whatever changes you may make, or add to it this recipes is a winner. After I write this review, I am going to make a batch! :)

These were super easy to make.  I substituted whole milk for the condensed.  The frosting is too sweet, so I would add more butter, cream cheese and less powdered sugar.  My children liked them.

These were made for my husband on Valentine's Day!  I was hesitant to make them because they use a cake mix.  I've tried the many cake mix cookie recipes out there and have been disappointed by the taste.  However, I made these exactly as written, except no pecans.  Because of the holiday, I rolled them in red decorating sugar.  Bake them as written, leaving them on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes when they are removed from the oven.  This will help them set before trying to remove them.  Also, don't be tempted to allow them to bake much longer than indicated.  I did and burned a few due to the deep red color, it's hard to tell if they are "browned".

I made these for valentine's day - so so good! I made them plain..left out the burbon, coconut, and pecans..and they still got great. The cake mix makes it really easy. One tip is to take them out of the oven after they have just begun to crack (8 mins) just like the recipe says. I was a little hesitant with the first tray because they looked like they weren't nearly done so I left them in a few minutes longer and they ended up burning.

I really enjoyed these. Very Simple. I made them for my neighbor whose father passed away last night. He loves red velvet. Very impressed. I kept the pecans out just because I wasn't sure if he ate nuts or not. I would love to try this with chocolate cookies and maybe some mini chocolate chips in the cream cheese mix.

Easy and delicious recipe!  I used my own cream cheese frosting just because I had all the ingredients on hand (and I didn't have the coconut or evap milk for THIS recipe) and the kids gobbled them up...the adults liked them as well.  I made NO changes to the cake/cookie recipe part at all.  I'll be trying this recipe in other flavors, for sure!

Make sure you follow these directions for the cake mix and not the directions on the box, which would make the cookies too soft and cakey! The cream cheese frosting was deeelish!

I opted out of the bourbon, coconut and pecans (along with the evaprtated milk). They came out deliscious!! One box does make too many of them expecially when one sandwhich is more then enough for one person. Next time I think I'm going to make them smaller so they don't look too overwhelming and so I'll have more. Other then that, I wouldn't change a thing!

The cookies came out beautifully.  However, the cream filling was tooooo soft.  It needs to be stiffer.  I haven't used Crisco hard shortening, that's what this filling needs.

This was good. I used store bought cream cheese frosting, thinned with some Carnation. I added some milk to the cookie batter, which was a mistake since they came out flat. My bad! But this was quick to make and I will try these with different cake mixes! Thanks!

Visually attractive & extremely rich cookie. Great for visual impact, but you need a large crowd who will eat them quickly since the icing needs to be refrigerated ... and most folks can only eat one.

These cookies were such a hit this Christmas! I made exactly as written, except used Vanilla extract instead of liquor. I made half with no coconut or nuts and half with all. They are so rich a delicious, you can only have 1. Plus, the recipe states to make the cookies into walnut sized balls. When I did that I did not get the right amount of cookies. I cut it down to about chestnut size balls and it came out right. However, they really could have been even smaller. The cookies came out about 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide, which is pretty big for a rich cookie. These are definitely a keeper!!!

This was a little more work than most. I didn't get any comments on it. Thought the cookie cakes were a little dry. Maybe not bake as long as stated.

The 1st thing everyone who took a bite of these said was, "MMMMM!". These are great cookies, and they are so pretty! I left out the bourbon and coconut, but used the pecans. They were amazing. The only issue I had was that there was so much extra icing. My suggesion would be to get the icing recipie for 12 servings.

These cookies are both tasty and cute. I made them for my daughter's Valentine's Day party at school. Since cake mixes are only about 15 oz now, not  about 18 oz, I added a little less than a 1/4 cup of flour to make the dough a consistency I could roll. I also chilled the dough for a few minutes to improve rolling and prevent spreading while cooking. I used a cookie scoop/melon baller for the walnut-sized balls. The batter only made 12 sandwiches, so I ended up making another batch. As the recipe author said, there will be plenty of icing, so no need to double that.

I followed this recipe exactly. The dough was sooo oily, it was kind of disgusting. Somehow, they came out just fine. Both my sons love red velvet desserts & they really liked this one, so the oily cookie dough mess will be our little secret. I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the oil slick... Will definitely try again though.

Made these for a Christmas party.  Huge hit.  Substituted rum for the whiskey as I had none.  The dough was too soft to roll into balls so used a small scoop an made even sized mounds.  They baked nicely.  For the filling, I omitted the coconut and pecans.  I used a pastry bag to spread it then rolled the edge in red and white sprinkles.  I put them out in the cold in a Tupperware container for a few hours until the party.

This recipe was amazing! Cookies were so soft and the filling is so delicious. The cream cheese flavor is very light and subtle. These tasted like yodels to me. I skipped the bourbon and enjoyed the chocolatey goodness!

I made these twice for Christmas this year they turned out really good. I try to follow the recipe the first time exactly as it is written but didn't have bourbon and they turned out fine. i couldn't find the size boxes of red velvet mentioned for the recipe so the first time i made them the yield was way off and i had a ton of icing left over (which is delicious by the way and my new go to cream cheese icing) so I made them again Christmas eve doubled everything but the icing and finished up the icing. Easy to make taste fabulous and Thank you for sharing!

Wow!!  What can I say about these cookies except WOW!  The recipe was so easy and fun.  The cookies turned out perfect every single time.  If you do not like baking,  you will love baking these cookies.   I didn't change the recipe much.  The bourbon I used was honey bourbon and I left out the coconut and nuts but only because they were so yummy and so beautiful that they didn't need any help.   I had coconut and nuts ready to use but tasted first and I could not add 1 thing to change perfection!

Like others I left out the bourbon, otherwise the cookie recipe is the same. I am a bit lazy so I used store bought cream cheese icing and it was delicious. I added coconut to one batch and another without, more liked it without.  I rolled in mini-chips and sprinkles around the edges to be festive.

I did not get 24 servings. The taste is nothing special.  They are pretty though.

I'm giving it four stars just because I'm insecure enough to think that I did something wrong in making these cookies.  I followed the directions exactly, but the dough was beyond sticky an impossible to roll into balls.  I double checked the ingredients several times to verify that I'd followed the recipe exactly, and I had.  I added about 1/3 cup of flour to the dough, and it was still completely unrollable.  I even pulled up another red velvet cookie recipe but it was almost identical in ingredients and procedures.  I ended up dropping small spoonfuls onto the cookie sheets just to get them cooked.  Consequently, my cookies are not round, are taller than they should probably be, are about bite sized, but taste great!

I thought these were pretty good. They were very quick to make and the filling was sweet but very good.  I was able to make a double batch of cookies with only one batch of filling.  I took these to a 4th of July BBQ and they were  a big hit with the kids as well as the adults. Thanks for sharing your recipe, DAWNV4!

Super yummy. I didn't use the coconut or pecans (personal preference) and loved how these turned out. I made the cookies the day before I needed them and they stayed soft in a container. The icing recipe, even without the coconut, made about triple the amount I needed to sandwich the cookies. Maybe next time I will do a double batch of the cookies. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these cookies ,and they were awesome however the dough turned out a little gooey to handle so I had to place the dough in the fridge for almost 30 minutes . Other than that it is awesome.

This recipe is fabulous.  The cookies turn out perfectly round and very professional looking.  My family doesn't like the texture of coconut, so I omitted it.  However, I did use coconut rum instead of burbon.  My friends always request that I bring this recipe.

Instead of bourbon, I used 1 part vanilla 2 parts water, and for the evaporated milk, I used whipping cream or half & half will work. Just by reading the recipe, 4 cups of powdered sugar is way too sweet. I used 2.5 cups and Left out the nuts. 
It was an easy yet very tasty recipe. I would probably use this recipe when I'm limited on time. I prefer chocolate chips in my red velvet cakes.

Looks great but the cookies were dry and definitely more cake-like w/ not much flavor.  I don't know if it's due to the cake mix or what, but I didn't get the chewy delicious cookies I read so many people did.  The filling was too runny even after adding more powdered sugar and cream cheese and I ended up with a huge jar left over so I'd half the frosting recipe.  Not sure what happened. I was going to give these out to clients but I don't think I'm going to.  I was so excited to make these but they just weren't good.

I made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's day! Just finished making them. I made a few alterations though, couldn't find any red velvet cake mix so I used Devil's food cake mix instead. Used Vanilla instead of bourbon as I saw some people have done. The cookies are very soft and cake like! Quite tasty. The Icing is a little bit on the soft side but still pretty tasty and sweet. I like that they mimic oreos cuz my boyfriend loves oreos! I dropped some heart-shaped flakes on the cookies before putting them in the oven to make them more valentine's day ish. Anyways I am very happy with this recipe they are quite a delicious treat!

I cheated a bit and used store bought cream cheese frosting so I'm sure that is part of why they were not as good. A couple additional changes I made: toasted the coconut, left off the pecans. I took these to a cookie exchange and people really liked them.

Left out the bourbon and used a cooked icing recipe for another red velvet cake recipe, but wished I had used the one given here without the nuts and coconut. Next time I will make the cookies one-half the size of walnuts as the the cookies are just too big when put together in a sandwich. Like eating a meal and I cannot imagine a child eating one. Would like to try these with a lemon or choc. cake mix.
