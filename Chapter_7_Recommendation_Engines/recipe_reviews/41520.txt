A luscious cheese spread - the layering of the artichoke, herb, cheese mixture with the cream cheese makes this recipe a delight for the palette.  I used pickled red pepper (a commercial product with a touch of red wine vinegar) that  further enhanced the flavors.  Wonderful on crackers, or stuffed in celery. A hands-down hit at a New Year's gathering.
