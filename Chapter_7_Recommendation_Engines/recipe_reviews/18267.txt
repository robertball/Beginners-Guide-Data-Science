I sauteed the onions in butter and added some garlic.  Then about half the amount of green bell pepper and parsley (sauteed them as well). (I don't get on well with bell peppers; I also reduced the cheese a bit)
I used a potato masher for the cooked carrots and added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth.
My guests like the dish as did my family (two teenaged boys).  The consistency was not smooth (not like mashed potatoes) but we liked the texture.  I'll make this one again.

This recipe is a yummy, different take on carrots.  I do, however, agree with the reviewers who said it could use a bit more flavor.  The next time I make it I will probably add some green onion.  Very good over all though.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe and was worried about the review below that said it was bland. So I liberally used ground white pepper and garlic powder and ended up with a great side dish! Different easy colorful and yummy! It doesn't get five stars because it was a little too cheesy for my taste. I prefer lighter methods in the preparation of vegetables.

Everyone loved this recipie!! I baked it in a more shallow pan so they were a little dry so bake them in a deeper pan. And also whip the carrots until they are really creamy not just mashed they will blend with the other ingredients better. But I really loved this recipie you can add whatever veggies you like!!!

These were really great. They are very similar to mashed sweet potatoes. I was really surprised how much flavor carrots have. I did add some milk to the recipe because it seemed a little dry to me. I will make this recipe again however I think the next time I will leave the bread crumbs off. I used finely ground crumbs and they did not brown although the carrots did and it did not add any flavor just made the dish messier.

I loved these carrots. I really had to boil them for a long time to get them soft enough to mash. I wish I had a blender then I really could've made them fluffy and creamy. The cheese mixed in with the green onions makes a wonderful flavor. Thanks for this recipe! Making it over and over...

Nice change of pace for a side dish. I agree with other reviewers...Add 1/3 cup milk to overcome dryness and reduce breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup.

Here's the thing with this recipe: I wanted to follow it exact I usually do when making it for the first time. The problem was that I was out of sharp cheddar cheese which could have been a problem but Costco just talked me into buying some horseradish cheddar. Since I saw a few other recipes for carrots that had horseradish I thought hey it's worth a shot. And guess what this turned out delicious!!! Chock one up to Costco for making me buy some weird ol' cheese!

This is a good recipe. I didn't use the green bell pepper because to me they can have an overpowering flavor. Oddly enough an old boss' wife made a similar dish for dinner one evening except the carrots weren't mashed. I decided to use this addition and it was fabulous. Fried it up drained it patted it with paper towels crushed it and threw it in before popping it in the oven. Bacon...always a winner in our household. Thanks so much Linda.

I know that it is not proper to rate a recipe if you have changed it; however after reading the reviews and making the recommended changes I can honestly say this is a five star recipe. I pureed the carrots in a food processor added 1/3 cup of milk eliminated the peppers reduced the cheese to 6 ounces added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder used dried parsley flakes and just sprinkled enough bread crumbs to cover and finally baked it all in a 2 qt round baking dish.

This was a really nice side dish for a traditional Sunday roast. I left out the green pepper as it did not seem to go with the consistency and flavour I was looking for in this dish. Thank you for this easy and yummy recipe.

I used i T dry parsley and omitted the bread crumbs. I thought it was good - I liked the juxtapostion of crunchy bell peppers with soft carrots - but my family did not like this so I will probably not make it again.

This was fabulous! I did need to cook the carrots for a long time then used my hand mixer to get a creamy smooth texture. I added the minced onion to the carrots before beating them in order to release the flavours. It turned out great. I also omitted the green pepperbut added lots of italian seasoning. WIll make it again.

This is so delicious. I didn't have regular bread crumbs so I added Panko bread crumbs. I also didn't have parsley so I added ground 1/8- 1/4 tsp of: thyme red pepper cumin oregano. (I went a bit wild on the spices cuz I wanted to add more flavor.) The rest of recipe stayed the same.

We tried them on our guests. The consensus: dry. Suggestions were to whip the carrots with a mixer and only use a 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. Will try them this way next time. Thanks for the recipe.

This is just the best. I was wondering if there was another way to serve carotts other than just with butter and I found it. I didn't put in any parsley because I didn't have any but it was just delicious. I also took the hint from another cook and put it in a 9X9 glass pan instead of the size recomended. My husband just thought it was fantastic. I rate receipes by if I could serve it to guests and this one is a go!

I personally do not like cooked carrots but these carrots I eat as long as they last and usually they don't last too long in my house. Great recipe. A good way to make your family eat veggies.

This is pretty much how I've been making it too except for the green pepper and mashing the carrots. While I did like the dish I still like some texture to the carrots and think I would go without the green pepper.
