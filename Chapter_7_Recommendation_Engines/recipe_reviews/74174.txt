This is a great basic recipe that is especially good for people who tend to skip breakfast.  I'm not a morning person..and rarely eat breakfast.  But I've been making these every morning.  I pour them in a travel cup and drink them on my way to work.  The very best thing about these smoothies is that they keep you very satisfied.  After having one of these in the morning, I don't feel hungry for at least 4 hours!  I usually substitute orange juice for the milk and then skip the honey..and they're still quite delicious!  A few tips...you can use whatever type of fruit that you have and cut it up and put it in a freezer bag to save yourself a few minutes of prep time in the morning.  also, if you find that you don't like the texture of the ground flax seed..you can just substitute 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil (trust me, it won't make you fat..I've been having 1 Tbsp almost every morning, and I've lost 60 pounds!).  These whip up perfectly in a Magic Bullet blender, plus the cups that come with it are easily transportable.

The first few times I made this smoothie, I wasn't crazy about it because the protein and flax mixed together was too much for me.  Then, after seeing another user's review, I replaced the flaxseed with 1 tsp flaxseed oil.  It was fabulous.  I've been drinking one of these every day for about a month now and have lost about 7 or 8 pounds!

I buy fat free yogurt in the single serving containers, then freeze them. I make my smoothie in the blender using one of these, 1/2c or more frozen fruit, 1/2c or more skim milk, splash of vanilla, 1-2 packets Splenda, and a scoop of protein powder. It turns out extra thick because the fruit and yogurt are both frozen to start. I drink it on my 1 hour comute to work.

I HATE smoothies--but I loved this one!  One thing to remember though-- freeze the banana after you peel it! I forgot the strawberries, and used blueberry yogurt instead of regular, both of which worked out fine for me.  I also used the vanilla flavored protein powder, which gave the smootie a nice flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this, the only thing I changed was the use of flaxseed oil instead of actual flaxseed.  Since then I have been adding 2 ice cubes, as someone else here had suggested, which helps to reduce the powder-like texture and taste from the protein supplement.   This is a great smoothie considering it is hard to find something to mix protein and flaxseed with without having to force yourself to drink it each day.  I also add a little bit of Fibersure to make up for the fiber lost by using flaxseed oil rather than the seeds themselves.  It is a great way to up your fiber intake.  Thanks for the great recipe !!

I left out the strawberries and the honey, but did add a 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar and about a 1/3 a cup of ice, and WOW it was delicious!!! The ice seemed to perfect the texture for me.
I was looking for ways to add flax to our diet, and I'm glad I found this! In a tweaked version, I also added a tablespoon of wheat germ and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. That also was very good!
p.s. If your blender is like mine and doesn't grind the flax seeds up all the way, just grind them in a coffee grinder beforehand, for better health benefits and digestion. (Whole seeds don't digest.) I bought my Krups grinder for $16 at BBB (with 20% coupon).

This smoothie seemed to have a lot of calories, but it is really a meal. I wasn't hungry for 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. So that makes it worth the calories!

I keep ziplock bags in the freezer that contains 1 sliced banana and 8 chopped strawberries, 1 tablespoon of splenda and 2 ice cubes. All I have to add to the blender in the morning is 1/3 cup milk and 1 container of (vanilla) yogurt. I buy my strawberries on sale and make up bags to use for weeks in advance. Experiment!!

This was a really great recipe and it's very easy to come up with different variations. Instead of powdered protein supplement, I just used one teaspoon of spirulina. It made the color greenish but didn't change the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I make this all the time, and pretty much any frozen berry goes great with this.  I always add a handful of bagged spinach, and you can't even taste it!  I make this for my kids with the spinach too (leaving out the soy powder) and they still to this day have no idea that they're drinking something with spinach in it. :)

This is a no fail, flexible base.  You can switch it up as you please.  I used low fat almond milk, vanilla yogurt, skipped the protein powder as I didn't have any and Stevia for the honey.  I have flax bran that is extremely high in fiber and finely ground.  It works well in a smoothie.  I have made this several times and added different fruits I had on hand.  I added some ice cubes as well to lighten it up a bit.  (I usually make ice cubes out of almond milk, or orange juice to add to a smoothie)

This is a good starting point for smoothie novices.  I've discovered that I LOVE this variation: nix the protein powder, add a splash of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of blueberries (frozen berries work great!), and a packet of plain instant oatmeal instead of the flax.  Delicious, filling and really packs in my much-needed fruit servings!

I made this for breakfast this morning and thought it was great. I followed the advice of some and used a vanilla flavored protein powder. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I'm looking forward to trying this out with other fruits. Thanks for posting this.

Yummy! This is a really great recipe. I left out the honey, because I used Honey flavored Greek Yogurt, and it was delicious. I really like how it hides the protein powder and ground flax seed, which can have a bit of an overwhelming texture in some recipes. Absolutely delicious recipe!

Watch that soy! We consume far too much and it isn't as healthy as "they" say.  Try almond milk instead. This is really delicious and easy. Process the flax seeds in a coffee grinder before adding to blender to get their full benefit.

Use MILLED flax seed or flax seed oil, your body can't process regular seeds all the way so you won't get all the nutrients that flax provides.  Be sure to read the ingredients on the back of your protein powder.  Some brands contain neurotoxins such as MSG and artificial sweeteners, and artery clogging hydrogenated oils... you can also use silken tofu in place, lower in calories and high in protein.

After drinking this smoothie every morning for the past two and a half years, I felt compelled to review it, praise it, and share a few variations with the allrecipes crowd.  I typically begin by pouring 8oz of skim milk in the blender, then add flax seed oil, a tablespoon of agave nectar, 2 teaspoons of powdered dietary fiber, a heaping tablespoon of protein powder, frozen fruit, half cup of non-fat plain yogurt and half a cup of Plain Kefir (Lifeway), blend and enjoy.  I normally have the following frozen fruit on hand:  blueberry, strawberry, cherry, mixed fruit, raspberry, mixed berry, banana, kiwi, and mango.  My favorite combos are strawberry/banana, strawberry/kiwi, cherry/mango, mixed fruit (with a splash of orange juice), raspberry/mango, and blueberry/mango.  At least a cup of frozen fruit per serving.  I feel like I've covered so many of my dietary needs in the morning with this drink, and the taste and variety is endless!  Thanks to AmyJessica for this fabulous, meal replacing recipe!

I was looking for a good smoothie recipe to include protein powder in as I needed to up my daily protein intake.  After reading the reviews on this, I was really excited and expected it to be great.  It tasted awful!  And the texture was horrid - very grainy and gritty.  I made it again with less protein powder and used flax seed OIL as suggested by other reviewers and it is better - but still a little grainy (due to the protein powder I'm sure).  The recipe is workable, but as is - I was unable to drink it.

WHOLE FLAXSEED DOES NOT DIGEST!!!  MAKE SURE YOUR BLENDER IS GRINDING IT UP.  IF NOT, GRIND THEM IN COFFEE GRINDER.  SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EATING WHOLE FLAXSEEDS FOR A LONG TIME, ONLY TO FIND IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE!

I used this recipe as an outline and have created a smoothie I really love. I use 1/2 cup lowfat plain yogurt, a small banana, 2 tabelspoons soy protein powder, 1/4 cup blueberries, and 1/4 cup strawberries (I use water to get the desired consistency). It is only 235 calories, keeps me full for at least 4 hours, and tastes great! I don't think I will ever get tired of this smoothie. YUM!

Awesome recipe!  I've been looking for a smoothie that used yogurt instead of juice that actually tasted great, and I've finally found it!  And so versatile, you can use whatever fruit you want.  I used strawberries, kiwi and banana and it was just like a milkshake! Thank you for sharing :)

Fantastic!  Even though I made a few slight changes, overall I followed the ingredients to the T.  My youngest daughter loves it, as well as my husband and I.  My oldest daughter hasn't tried it yet.  I used 2% milk, vanilla yogurt, and I bought already ground flax seed.  I bought frozen whole strawberries (1 prior to chopping) and 1/2 frozen banana like suggested.  ***TIP*** If this is you first attempt at freezing bananas just for this recipe, peel the bananas first, then wrap in foil.***

This is pretty much the smoothie we make but I use Greek yogurt...just as non-fat but higher protein. If you are curbing calories protein is a must. I also use FF Smart Balance milk for more protein than regular. And no sugar or hoeny isnecessary if you use the fruited yogurt.

I agree with the rave reviews! Any kind of frozen fruit works (including pears, mandarin oranges, peaches, blueberries, or raspberries). If you use a flavored protein powder, you can omit the honey!

I love this.  First time I made it as written, but have since have made it my own.  I don't do milk well, so used this wonderful orange mango juice.  Costco sells these big bags of frozen fruit - mango, papaya, strawberries & pineapple.  I throw a handful (or 2) in with the banana, plain greek yogurt and protein powder.  Don't always add the flax seed because I don't like the texture.  As other reviewers, I drink it on my morning commute.

I really enjoyed this smoothie! I used other reviewers' advice and used fat free vanilla flavored yogurt instead of plain. I couldn't find any protein supplement at my grocer so I didn't add it, but I will when I get some! Very good! I gave it four stars instead of 5 just because it is a little grainy with the flax seeds.

I make this using a 80% banana 20% strawberry ratio. This in turn doesn't require the honey ingredient bc it's already sweet. I use Raw Protein Organic Supplement and Centrum ground flaxseed. This is perfect if you never have breakfast like me--very filling. I can't wait to experiment with different fruits. Thank you for sharing this recipe!! :)

I made this this morning and it was pretty good -- I used hemp protein powder and didn't add sugar which I think affected the taste a little bit. I'm not going to take any stars off for that though. I can see the health benefits in this and since I just bought a Ninja Master last night, threw all the ingredients in and it was super easy (and no, I am not a shill for Ninja). I know I am going to have a ton of fun making all different variations of this!

I didn't add the protein or flax (didn't have it) and it worked great.  The most important thing is make sure to freeze (except milk) all your ingredients even the yogurt.  I the individual cups of yogurt and freeze them.  If I buy fresh fruit I freeze it too. I've been trying all different combos.  Vanilla yougurt with Mango has been my favorite so far

I have never made a smoothie before.  I was very impressed with how fast and easy it is.  I made mine without the flax seed oil since I did not have any and they came out great although probably not as nutritious.

I made this today, but had to make a few changes. I didn't have a banana so I omitted it and used unsweetened, frozen blueberries inplace of it. I also used agave nectar instead of honey and low carb, sugar free carrot cake yogurt in place of the plain. This smoothie is absolutely delicious!!

Good basic smoothie recipe.  I've been a vegetarian for four years and I'm always looking for a way to sneak protein into my diet with out that not-so-delish "protein powder" taste.  I used vanilla soy milk and a low-fat vanilla yogurt, a single splenda instead of honey, and two ice cubes since someone forgot to pop a banana in the freezer :).  It's filling and made a little more than I expected.  Not to worry, popping the extra into the ice cube tray produced some rather tasty "popsicles" for my daughter.

This is so good!  Tastes more like a strawberry milkshake than a smoothie!  I made it for my husband and his friend on their way out the door one morning, and it's been requested again.  I was worried the flax might be noticeable - grainy or something - but I couldn't tell it was in there at all. I've been experimenting with smoothie recipes and this is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good much like my primary morning smoothie. Try adding Vanila Soy Milk instead of reg. Milk and skip the honey. Great for a Breakfast on the go.

It's amazingly delish!  and easy  the only thing i suggest is to freeze the banana AFTER you peel it(i learned by accident). Im going to start freezing my banana's that start to go bad into ice cube trays so i can just throw them in the blender.  i also buy singe 4 oz servings of vanilla yogurt, just peel and drop in the blender and being a single person i dont let a 5lb of yogurt go bad

I left out the protein powder and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, otherwise left everything the same.  The consistency (just thin enough to easily get through a straw) and amount (16oz) were perfect.  I don't like yogurt, but know it's good for me, and this is a way I can stomach it.  I put the flax seeds in first and ground them before adding the rest of the ingredients, and this got them well ground.  It was enough to fill me up for breakfast.

If you you are using this as a health or diet smoothie, do NOT replace the flax seeds with flax seed oil as some of the commenters suggest. I did some research before trying this smoothie, and although flax seeds are a great source of fiber and protein, flax seed oil is mostly just fat and not nearly as good for you. Some things I did try changing: which fruits I used (kept it seasonal for $ reasons), plain greek yogurt for regular yogurt (makes a VERY creamy, "heftier" smoothie with more protein but less calcium), 1 1/2 tsp honey for 1 tsp because my husband likes it a little sweeter. We also always use almond milk (unflavored) instead of skim milk because we usually buy things in large quantities to save money but don't really like skim milk, so the rest of it kept going to waste. Almond milk works well and we know it will get used before it goes bad. It does make the whole thing taste a little "nuttier" for obvious reasons, though, so if the flax seeds are turning you off, the almond milk probably will too. The contributor is correct - this really is an all-around good smoothie!

This was a very helpful recipe for me after I got my wisdom teeth removed and couldnt eat. I only changed the plain yogurt to greek coconut flavored yogurt (all i had), and frozen fruits such as mangos and cantelope instead of strawberries. It still turned out good and great for anyone looking to get some added protein!

I went rogue and made several changes.  I used coconut milk and honey greek yogurt.  I also omitted the tspn of honey.  I used a few extra strawberries and it was super delish!  Plenty sweet.  This is a great base recipe to experiment with.

I can't give this recipe enough stars.  It's absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  My daughter told me she froze bananas by slicing them (without skin) into 8 slices so she knows automatically 4 slices is 1/2, which I did, an entire baggie full now lives in my freezer, and they turned out beautifully!  I use the little cups of yogurt so I don't have to measure, I also use 4 or 5 ice cubes, and I don't even have to use the honey or any sweetener really because the banana  sweetens it enough.  With the addition of the ice cubes it's more like a fruit shake than anything else and it's scrumptious!  I've used bananas and strawberries, bananas and blackberries, bananas and blueberries and all are delicious.   I can't think you enough for posting this!

The name doesn't lie! I actually do 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup OJ, a tad less yogurt and the consistency is perfect (on the thinner side). No honey needed this way. I also add 1 Tbspn flax oil and ground walnuts for some extra omega-3s (I hate walnuts so this is a great way to hide the taste and get the nutrients). Never gets old with endless fruit combinations!

This smoothie is pretty good compared to most I have tried.  It's very thick, so if you like a thinner smoothie this is the wrong recipe for you!  I didn't have flax seeds so I added some ready in one minute oatmeal (warmed in microwave with water first).  Definitely makes you feel like you ate something very healthy and tasty afterwords!

I took some advice from the other reviewers and replaced the yogurt and milk with orange juice (I try to avoid dairy as it makes me congested). I'm pregnant so I'm trying to find different ways of getting my vitamins and this is definitely the best one I've found! Plus, the flax seed will help with some of my other pregnancy issues ;) Great smoothie and I'll definitely be making this again!

I have been having a hard time getting past the taste of the Soy Protein that I bought.  I figured since I rarely eat breakfast I need a supplement and I tried a smoothie, milk, yogurt.. they were all gross! This is the best so far, I think the only reason I can tell the Protein is in there is because I know.  I did sub. in blueberry yogurt, extra honey and needed a tad more milk... delicious!

I'm really not a smoothie person but this was really good!  I've been looking for different protein breakfast ideas and got tired of eating eggs every day. This will help me change it up.   I used 1/2 cup organic skim milk, 1/2 cup of Dole Wildly Nutritious Signature Blends - tropical fruit, 1/2 cup Stonyfield Farm lowfat strawberry yogurt, 1 tbsp ground flaxseed, 1 scoop vanilla protein powder and 1 tsp honey. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy! I didn't add the protein supplement, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was good, but I prefer a tad bit sweeter so I added a bit of Splenda.  I also made this for my toddler with whole milk and whole milk yogurt and he gobbled it up!

UPDATED:  Being inspired by this recipe I did some experimenting and made my own recipe, and am waiting for it to be published.  This is a great starter recipe, thank you! ORIGINAL:I loved this!  I will be making this every morning.  My 7 year old son loved it too.  I normally like to do the recipe exactly as it is written the first time around, but could not with this recipe.  I substituted plain rice milk for the milk.  I used raw honey instead of regular honey.  I used 1/4 cup of yogurt as we limit our dairy intake.  For protein powder, I used unflavored whey protein isolate I had on hand from baking homemade bread.  I also added a small hand full of ice cubes.  This was awesome!  Tastes just like the $5 smoothies I get at the smoothie place.

I use a tsp. of flax seed oil instead of flax seed. I couldn't handle the gritty taste. I lose the fiber benefit but keep the rest of the nutrition. Great healthy smoothie.

I have a smoothie every morning.  I can't eat when I get up, it's much too early, so I make the smoothie, pour it into a chilled thermos and take it to work with me to sip on throughout the morning. It keeps me from snacking between breakfast and lunch and feels like I'm cheating. It tastes too good to be healthy -- but it is.

Yummy. It was a little thick for my personal taste, so i added a little more milk. I used flax seed meal instead of just the seed, vanilla yogurt, and more honey.

Thanks AmyJessica for sharing this cool recipe and getting me started on smoothies!

I tried many different flavor combos and they all were very nice. My favorite is vanilla yogurt, 3 whole frozen strawberries and 8-10 pieces of frozen cut mango, 4 tsp flax seed in 1/2 cup skim milk. The smoothies tastes very yumm!

I was very excited to find this recipe since I need to find ways to battle hunger! I was disappointed that I was still hungry 2 hours later. I used soy vanilla protein powder because that was all I could find at the store. Also I used the flax seed oil as previously mentioned. I didn't think the taste of the smoothie was all that great, even with a few extra berries and fruit. (I hate bananas and have peaches, pineapple and other various frozen fruit) I may try the vanilla fat free yogurt even though it isn't as healthy. Good recipe though ... wish I could figure out how to get rid of morning and afternoon hunger!!

This is delicious!  I can not eat dairy, so I used almond milk and omitted the yogurt. I used hemp vanilla protein powder. This will be a do over.  Thank you!

Great recipe! Instead of skim milk, I use almond milk. I don't like the phytoestrogens in flax, so I use chia seed in its place.

Very good and easy. Didn't use protein powder or flax seed. Use banana, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, etc. Any fruit mix is really good!

It's fine. The reviewer Sara must be challenged in many areas. Flax seed vs. flax seed oil are two completely different things. The benefit of flax seed is obviously a take it or leave it ingredient here.  Honestly, a smoothie is some yogurt, with some milk, with some fruit, and with whatever else you'd like to health it up with.

Excellent!  I've been making these every morning for the past few weeks.  Mmm mmm good!  Though I do not put any honey in - no need.  Also, I use a tsp of flax seed oil instead of the seeds themselves.  Also, I like to mix it up by putting flavored yogurt; so far, I've tried strawberry, blueberry, maple and vanilla.

This was AMAZING. I have made my own smoothies before, but this was creamy and flavorful. I made some changes based on the ingredients I had on hand: I used yoplait light banana cream pie, strawberry flavored powdered protein, and left out the flax seed! It was amazing!

Love this recipe! The recipes is great as is, but my family likes to add extras to it.  Instead of honey we add vanilla and splenda. We like the combination of frozen strawberries, bananas, and blueberries best. Enjoy!

This was really, really delicious. I've made it as is and love it, however I have also experimented and added and/or subtracted ingredients based on what I have on hand. Today I used greek blueberry yogurt, skipped the frozen banana and added frozen blueberries instead, skipped the powdered protein and instead of the honey added organic agave nectar.  This recipe is so versatile and you just can't go wrong with it.

I've made a miilion smoothies, and this is a really good recipe. Some tweaks I made were to omit the honey (sweet enough on its own), use 1 cup of Kefir instead of the milk and yogurt, doubled the flax, and I doubled the berries (added in blueberries, raspberries and blackberries). If you have a good blender (I have a Blendtec) you can do the flax seed whole since that will grind up the flax seeds. All of my kids enjoyed it too.

Very good.  I used 1/2 of a banana and 1/2 c. of frozen peaches, because that is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make this again and try different fruit combinations. Great meal on the go!

Great basic recipe.  I used cashew milk this morning & goat milk yogurt.  (I make my own milk out of raw nuts because it's so good for you. No cholesterol, full of protein & easy to digest because the enzymes are still in tact.)  Skipped the honey because the fruit made it sweet enough.  One T of flax seed, one T of flax oil, & 1 T of whole grain oatmeal.  Yummy!!! (If you get the dark colored flax seed, it tastes fishy. The light colored flax has a nutty taste. If you grind it up before you add it to the smoothie, it tastes better & is easier to digest.)

I love this drink and have it for lunch every day. I'm trying to lose weight and this is a BIG help. I made a few changes to fit what I like. I haven't used a banana because I didn't have any on hand so I doubled the berries. I've used blueberries, strawberries and peaches since that's what I have in my freezer. They were ALL good! I use vanilla in place of the honey as I think it gives it better flavor. I also use flax meal instead of flax seed and that works wonders! I did follow the one reviewer's suggestion and used OJ instead of milk and that was also good. You can tweak this any way you want and it would still be good. Very easy and quick to make and will continue drinking them as they are very filling. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is okay. I put in a banana and (same amount of) blueberries, 1 tbsp of flax oil instead of seed and left out the protein powder. Next time I'll try strawberries. It didn't feel like the best smooth - maybe not thick enough?

Best smoothie recipe ever.  Plain & simple.  We omitted the flaxseed because we didn't have any and, substituted MANGO for the strawberries.  The consistency, texture, taste, smooth-ness, healthiness of it all made it the perfect smoothie!

I love this recipe!! So do my boyfriend and brother! I make it as a regular smoothie with no protein or flax seed as well as a healthy breakfast w/ those things! Its so easy to customize!! I used vanilla yogurt and frozen mixed berries. I used a fresh banana and added a little more huney. Everyone loves this smoothie and I make it in the morning before work!!

This is the same recipe I have used for awhile. My only suggestions..For Liquid I use Fusion Strawberry/Banana Juice from V8. and a little OJ. I use Frozen Strawberries and Frozen Blueberries. I also use Strawberry Creme Muscle Milk Protein powder.. 1 Scoop is all it takes. Non fat yogurt and Whole Flaxseed. I think it works out to about 500 calories.. not bad for a breakfast replacement.

This is a great smoothie recipe! My only substitutions are that I use vanilla flavored ingredients: vanilla almond milk, low fat vanilla yogurt, and also vanilla protein powder (hmm, do you think I like vanilla?!). I feel that this makes the smoothie taste more like a milkshake (only a whole lot healthier!). As other reviewers noted, I use the flaxseed oil instead of the ground seeds. I love that you can keep changing the fruit combo! I cut up all my fruit and measure to store in individual freezer bags to make it easier in the morning. I think my favorite combo so far was a strawberry/white peach with fruit I bought from the farmers market. Sooo good for breakfast, thanks for the awesome recipe!

I Love this recipe. I make it at least a few times a week. It's great after a workout. I give it a 5 just as is! I do sometimes change it up by adding blueberries or both strawberries and blueberries. It fills you up just perfectly.

Perfect for picky toddlers!  I very rarely give a recipe 5-stars, but this one deserves it!  I started making this smoothie for my picky two-year old for breakfast and he guzzles it right down.  I used plain, full-fat yogurt and whole milk for him, so I know he's getting some calories for the day.  I did not freeze the bananas and the consistency is perfect for his sippy cup.  I love that it's not too sweet and has more of a yogurt consistency, instead of icy.  This recipe has saved this worried mama's day!

I've been looking for a smoothie recipe that doesn't have tons of juice or sugar and this is it! I used 1 cup of plain rice milk and omitted the yogurt because of a whey allergy. The protein powder I prefer is the Whole Foods vanilla soy protein. One scoop was perfect. I used a frozen banana and frozen strawberries so it came out nice and cold without those annoying ice chunks. The honey I use for everything is the raw unfiltered kind from orange blossoms. Wonderful natural flavor..not like the processed junk you get at the grocery store. After reading the reviews I decided to use flaxseed oil rather than ground flaxseed and I'm glad I did. I think it helped to hold the smoothie together. I drank this for the first time today and went to the gym right after..I had such a burst of energy and felt great. One caveat, make sure the bottom of your blender is screwed on tightly..mine wasn't and there was smoothie all over my counter and blender! I can't wait to drink this again tomorrow morning!

Excellent! I use Stonyfield Farms Fat Free French Vanilla yogurt, 1.5 Tbsp of flax seed oil. I have tried it with and without the honey but can't tell the difference so I leave it out. I also add 2 ice cubes. You can add/exchange any fruit to this recipe. I like adding 1/4 cup of wild frozen blueberries. Perfect!

Great smoothie recipe!  I omitted the honey (I found it sweet enough) and used ff vanilla soy milk.  I think this will be my new morning meal before I hit the gym!! Oh, don't forget to either grind your flax seed (your body does not digest whole flax), buy it already ground or just use the oil.  Cheers!

I've been making this same smoothie recipe for years, and switching up the fruit as per whatever my mood is.  The only thing I keep consistent is the frozen chunk of banana that I throw in.  It really makes the smoothie thick.  Try adding half a ripe pear, a teaspoonful of cocoa powder and a pinch of instant coffee.  Mmmmm, mocha!!

Very good and filling.  I used flavored yogurt instead of honey. Any type of fruit you throw in there will work. My husband even liked it. Will make again.

This was good. The changes I made were: I used vanilla yogart, used frozen (thawed) strawberries, & left out the protein powder & flax seed oil because I haven't gotten to the GNC yet. Make sure you cut up the banana & peel it before you freeze it. I had only peeled it & cutting a frozen banana wan't fun. We had this at 6:30am ish & we were hungry around 9 but at least it was good. We'll be making these again.

This, was a very good smoothie!! The only change I made was using a whole banana because the one I used was kind of small and for the yogurt I had about 1/2 of a 6oz container of Greek vanilla yogurt left so I used that up for the 1/2 cup plain. I like how it incorporated flax seed and protein powder making it more filling. I got about 1.5 servings. TY

Wonderful smoothie, I left out the protein supplement since I didn't have any on hand but other than that I followed the recipe. Even without the protein it was quite filling. I like that I can switch the fruit for a different flavor, so far strawberries, blueberries, and peaches have all been very tasty. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good.  I used greek yogurt and a bit more honey.  My kids liked it too, which is nice since I can sneak "good for you" stuff in it!  I was glad I read other reviews and peeled the bananas before freezing them!  A pretty thick smoothie.  Thanks

I have made this smoothie the past 2 days for breakfast; once with strawberries and once with blueberries and I loved both of them. After reading the reviews, I think I will grind the flax seeds before adding. Looking foward to experimenting with different fruits and perhaps honey flavoured Greek yogurt.

Pretty good flavor, and great nutrition. I used plain nonfat Greek yogurt for more protein, and 1% milk. I also used 1 tbsp of flax meal instead of 1-1/2 tablespoons of seed, and added a small handful of frozen blueberries. I didn't find the texture from the flax offensive at all, but it might have been more finely ground in the blender since I started with ground seeds; it just reminded me of the seeds in the fruit. My nutrition calculations gave only 300 calories which is probably just a matter of the type of protein powder.

This is a great recipie for a smoothie,  only change I made was to use less ground flax seed as I have never used it before.  They say that too much if your not used to it can cause abdominal cramps, so I'm starting with 2 teaspoons instead.  Really turned out well.  Thanks!

I had to tweak it a bit.  Added ice because my strawberries weren't frozen.  Also, it's not sweet enough, so I added some Truvia.

These were really good and not too sweet. We did end up adding fresh fruit not frozen so we added some ice cubes to cool it down. We also added about double the amount of fruit that the recipe called for, that way it had a lot more flavor. I also omitted the protein powder in mine but my husband put it in his and we both really enjoyed this smoothie recipe.

I've made this every single day this week. I've made it part of my daily breakfast routine. It's great for those who don't have time to eat breakfast in the morning. Very healthy too. Slice the bananas, then freeze them. Frozen bananas last for a long time. Get ground flax seed in the pharmacy section of the grocery store. The frozen fruit makes it cold enough to not need any ice. Love it!

Delicious smoothie. I substituted agave syrup for the honey and only used a tablespoon of flax meal and protein powder, and sprinkled in about a teaspoon of Benefiber. Since fresh fruit is hard to come by here in February, I used canned peaches and apricots, packed in fruit juice. I cut up all the fruits, put a cup into 4 or 5 sandwich bags, and tossed the bags in the freezer overnight...the smoothie was the consistency of soft-serve ice cream, and really filling!

I just made this for my daughter.  She needs to eat way more protein so I thought I would give this a try.  I used mangos and blueberries.  Thought about using oj instead of the milk, but I think the milk might have more protein.  It is tasty and sweet and I HOPE she likes it.  I do:)

Yummy and easy to make.  I also love that the original recipe serves 1.  For dietary reasons, I substituted soy milk for non fat milk, pineapple/orange juice for yogurt and wheat germ instead of flaxseed.   Thanks for the recipe

I thought this was good, but i thought the protein powder was a little overpowering, so i might add more fruit or cut down on it a little next time. Thanks for a great recipe to mess around with!

Yummo!! I bumped it up to 4 servings, for the whole family. My bananas weren't frozen but worked fine. I had the smoothie pack from Costco with frozen yogurt and berries and used 2 of those, used the liquid flax seed and just for the heck of it, threw in an apple, as well as the other items in the recipe. Everyone seemed to love it and there was none left (very unusual)! I'll definitely make this again. :)

This smoothie is delicious and very versatile. You can use any fruit, although I tend to always put the 1/2 banana in it for fibre. I also omit the honey and add a teaspoon of green matcha tea (powdered green tea), as well as a bit of fruit juice when it comes out really thick. Fantastic! Note: be sure to finely grind the flaxseeds in a coffee grinder beforehand.

I am pregnant and this is a good way to get in lots of vitamins and fruit together in the mornings. I use fresh fruit (berries or peaches and half a banana) and I just use my immersion blender to quickly whip this up with minimal cleanup. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great smoothie.  The taste is exquisite and the texture is smooth. It reminds me of a milkshake. I've been trying to find a way to get my required protein without the awful taste and this smoothie does it.  When I read some of the reviews that they had a weight loss with this dring, I figure no way, but I've been drinking this for a week and have lost 5 lbs.

I love this smoothie, except I used full fat (but all natural) dairy products. I figure it's not the dairy making me fat but the chocolate cake and McDonalds. ;) 
Also I used Cane Juice instead of honey, and fresh berries instead of frozen.

This is great!  I'm drinking strawberry banana right now.  Had cherry banana yesterday.  I used vanilla soymilk, vanilla low fat yogurt and honey.  So mine isn't quite as low fat as the original but I still think it's delish.  Great smoothie and it's now become my morning routine.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great base recipe. I agree that the honey is needed to cover the taste of the protein powder . I add whatever frozen fruit I have on hand or whatever is on sale at the store that I know will freeze well. Another reviewer recommended trying it with orange juice. I do not recommend this since it makes it way to sweet even without the honey. Stick to the milk or soy milk and you will enjoy it. I promise!!!

This is the best smoothie I tasted.  I measure out my bananas and strawberries and freeze them in ziplock baggies.  Makes it much easier to prepare early in the morning before heading off to work. I've used both flax oil and flax meal. Either works fine.  It really does keep you full for a while.  I'm wondering if it is true what some reviewers say about it helping with weightloss. My flax oil has 13grams of fat.  I guess that's "good fat" and I'm hoping it won't add pounds.
Thanks for sharing this terrific MEAL.

I make a smoothie like this with 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup french vanilla yogurt.  To that I add 1 whole banana (I've tried fresh or frozen with great results from both), and 1/2 cup frozen strawberries.  Very yummy!
I haven't tried putting flax in it, but perhaps I'll try that.

mmmmm..Try this!!! I found it while searching a few minutes ago because I lost the recipe for the one I was going to make.  I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used 1% milk, ff plain yogurt, frozen mixed berries, 1 small banana, choc. carmel protein powder.  I didn't have any flax seed.  I also was so excited to make the recipe that I forgot to add honey!!  Didn't need it though.  Perfect the way it was made!!!

Great Smoothie, but it definitely needed some Splenda.  I didn't find it to be at all sweet without artificial sweetener, despite the fruit, honey, and vanilla flavored protein powder.  But the texture is awesome.  I also substituted flax seed oil for the seeds, and added frozen blueberries.  This is definitely a meal in a cup.

I didn't have protein powder on hand. I used 1% unflavoured yogurt and 2% milk, with 1/2 a banana and 6 frozen strawberries. I had to add a tsp of Splenda because the honey didn't sweeten it enough, but now it's perfect! Yum!

What a great smoothie!  The healthy combination of yogurt, protein, fruit, and ground flax seed is perfect.  Only changes I made were that I used frozen blackberries, and the 1/2 banana was at room temperature, not frozen.  I normally don't really like making smoothies for breakfast because it is too much effort that early in the morning :).  However, I think this has become a breakfast staple for me!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have been making a similar smoothie to this one for years, and I have tweaked it just slightly. I now use powered nonfat milk and 100% fruit juice, such as cherry especially if my arthritis is acting up, and I also grind my flax seed, since it has more health benefits that way, or I use flax seed oil, as another reviewer said. Throwing in a couple of ice cubes with the frozen fruit will cut the thickness you sometimes get with milkshakes.

Great smoothie recipe to use as a guide for whatever one has on hand.  I used almond milk, maple syrup instead of honey and I used whole grass fed Greek yogurt and some lime juice to give it a little tang.  I didn't use the protein supplement or flax seed.  Used a sprinkle of poppyseed instead as that's what I had on hand.  Also added a few ice cubes to thicken it a bit.  Turned out delicious!

Wonderful recipe, thank you.  I have made it several times using different fruits and then I freeze them in pops for the kids.  They LOVE them! (So do the adults!)

This recipe rocks! I just got my wisdom teeth out and had a terrible reaction so I can barely eat anything. Thanks to your smoothie I have a breakfast now. Instead of milk I used mango orange juice and added blackberries. I highly recommend it. I also used vanilla soy protein (which tastes like butt) and it was still delicious. Thanks so much!

I've made this smoothie a ton and changed it up very little. I use chocolate flavored protein powder and it really makes the shake delicious without adding any sugar.

My husband and I thought this smoothie was extremely bland.  I didn't include the flax or protein powder, so I suppose there's a possibility that those things add the flavor that this recipe is missing.  If so, I apologize for the bad review!  But I'm under the impression that those are mainly in the recipe for health reasons rather than flavor.  I salvaged the recipe by adding more honey and a lot of concentrated orange juice.

This was fantastic! I've made smoothies before, but this one tasted better than any I've tried, probably b/c of using yogurt. I used what I had onhand - a lemon flavored Weight Watchers yogurt, some mixed fruit I had already diced up and frozen before it would go bad(strawb, kiwi, peaches)used a tsp of flaxseed oil, scoop of protein powder and no honey (the flavored yogurt made it sweet enough.)Never thought I'd actually CRAVE something healthy as I do with this!

I used Weight Watcher's white chocolate cheesecake flavored yogurt and it was delicious.  I considered adding a little Splenda, but decided not to since it was already a light refreshing taste.  I left out the flax seeds.

I pretty much used this as a base and made a few substitutions. I doubled the batch and used the flax seed as directed, 1 cup 1% milk, 1 cup fat free vanilla yogart, 2 small bananas (and they were SMALL!) and 3 sliced nectarines. I froze the fruit the night before so it would be extra frothy. They were great and very filling! My husband didn't think he would like it, but he did! Next time I think I'll use a berry blend

I was looking for a good recipe, since I had protein powder and needed it to taste good!  I found this yesterday,tried it today,and it is great!  I followed the recipe exactly, just added frozen blueberries.  Very Good!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe as written, using vanilla flavored protein powder and yogurt, and it had a wonderful flavor and texture! (usually I'm kinda grossed out by anything with protein powder).  It kept me full for a good 3+ hours, and my husband actually said it was one of his favorite things I had ever made.  Wow!!

This smoothie tasted good, but it was way too thick and way too many seeds for my liking.  I omitted the flax seed and protein powder and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  I also used whole milk.  I wasn't looking for a low-fat smoothie, obviously!!  LOL!!

This smoothie tastes AMAZING and it is so easy to alter the recipe to your own personal tastes. For example, I forgot to add honey (oops) and I didn't have any bananas, but I still used frozen strawberries, milk, (strawberry) yogurt, and I added some orange juice, and it was fantastic. Great recipe!

Great smoothie recipe..needing something for on the go that will keep me satisfied for hours. I skip the flax seed oil and add my fish oil right in. Gives me my carb/protein/oil combo that I need for each meal.

This is the healthiest and best tasting smoothie I have found.  My southern food lovin' husband even loves it and doesn't realize how healthy it is.  The only thing I did differently was used light and fit low sugar vanilla yogurt and it was just as good and I love that I'm getting my flax intake.  Thank you for the recipe!

I am dairy intolerant, so I substituted coconut milk and non-dairy yogurt, and this smoothie is DELICIOUS! My banana was also fresh on my first go at this, and it didn't seem to detract from the taste at all. I will make many, many, more times!

This is my new favorite smoothie! Next time I will have to double the recipe so my toddlers don't hog it all. Only difference was I used oil instead of flax seed because I was out, added blueberries, a few more strawberries, and spinach. I wanted to add a nut butter too, but wanted to try without for starters. ??

GRAININESS -- Keep in mind that any 'grainy' texture is caused by the protein powder you're using. Generally, that comes from vegan proteins. Try using a whey protein instead if you're OK with dairy.

This recipe is a great foundation to any fruit smoothie.

LOVE LOVE this smoothie!!  This is by far my favorite smoothie - I make it quite often.  Sometimes I use blueberries instead of strawberries to change it up (and hubby doesn't like strawberries).  I use chocolate almond milk as my dairy.

not that the smoothie isn't good.use whole milk, mix regular fat greek yougart. 

Good fats are a great energy source and satisfy your body with the fuel it will burn until lunch. Eat more good fat at lunch and dinner will almost be an after thought.

Turned out to be pretty good. Didn't have any Strawberries or bananas on hand so I used peaches and mangos. Forgot to add the yogurt and substituted the flax seed for oil instead. Couldn't ask for a better smoothie

I was looking for an easy, yet healthy, Smoothie recipe when I came across this one.  First I made it just as the recipe directed, then I started experimenting with other ingredients.  Like other reviewers suggested, I added oatmeal and put it in first and blended it in my Magic Nutra Bullet.  I also added 1 tablespoon flax seed to the oatmeal and blended that together too.  This was an easy way to make it healthier and you really couldn't taste either the flax or oatmeal.  I also used 1/2 can of cocoanut milk, instead of the nonfat milk, 1/2 cup fat free strawberry yogurt and 1/2 cup fat free vanilla yogurt.  I also froze the yogurts and the strawberries, before adding them to the blender.  I tried this both with and without, the frozen 1"cubes of frozen bananas.  Instead of the honey, I used Splenda and the smoothie was plenty sweet and delicious!  I have even made up larger batches, frozen it and it still sets great, with a nice thick creamy consistency!  Sometimes I even add shredded cocoanut, pineapple, any other fresh frozen berries, slivered almonds, chia seeds, or just about anything else you can this of may work well too!  I am now a full fledged Healthy Smoothie Lover!

I made  this smoothie for my husband's breakfast today and he loved it. I am only rating the fruit to dairy ratio. I used, as usually, what I have on hand. To half the banana that wasn't frozen, I added a mix of frozen strawberries, blueberries, cherries and chopped kale. It's a frozen mix sold at my warehouse store. I skipped the powdered  protein.

I have this almost every morning. I recommend putting in 1/2 cup of spinach. You won't taste the spinach and it's a good way to get a serving of vegetables first thing in the morning.

With the banana, you can use the peel - it has lots of nutrients and additional fiber. You don't taste it at all once you blend the ingredients. Be careful with the flax seeds- too much will make you feel bloated.

For my taste the smoothie is a little bit on the bland side. I also didn't like the flax seed in it, next time I'll leave it out. Thanks for sharing this recipe though!

While I must forefront with saying that I did not have any protein powder to use, so I went without, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I did not think it was too great.  There is another smoothie recipe on this site that I like much more.  I thought the flavor was quite bland and it was not thick (although that could be due to the missing protein powder...I did end up adding some oatmeal at the end to compensate for that).

Very tasty and filling! NOTE: Use ground flax seed instead, blends better and better for the digestive system. I also used 1 cup milk, vanilla fat-free yogurt and 2 TBS of ground flax seed instead.  I even taped the recipe onto the cupboard right above where I keep my blender for everyday use :)

This is one of the best smoothies I've had! I'll never spend $5 buying a smoothie again! I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and left out the honey and it was still plenty sweet. I used frozen mango and banana. I also used flaxseed oil as others had suggested and a scoop of pretein powder. I was really amazed at how smooth it was! I have a hard time drinking the protein powder because of the texture, so this is a great solution for me. I will be making this everyday for breakfast!

Wow. This tastes fantastic! I had been making smoothies on the fly with a variety of fruits, milk, and yogurt, but wanted something a bit more filling and healthy - which is where the ground flaxseed comes in. I had never really thought of using flaxseed until this recipe, and special ordered some ground golden flaxseed specifically to try this out. Boy, was that a good move. :D Some say the flaxseed has a nutty flavor, but when I opened the package it really smelled more like a mild mango than anything else - perfect for adding to a smoothie! I did add more milk than the recipe called for because the consistency was a bit thick - it came out so good, and I will definitely be making this again. I tried it w/frozen banana and peach slices, and am totally look forward to using other fruit as well. I like the texture of the smoothie because it feels substantial. Thumbs way up!!!

I have made this smoothie a few times now.  As a new vegetarian, I was noticing that I was bruising very easily which can be a sign of lack of vitamin C and also protein/iron.  I wanted something in the morning with a little bit of kick and more nutrients in it than the honeynut cheerios I had been eating.  This is just what I was looking for!  The protein powder (Trader Joes has a great, inexpensive soy one) and flax seed have really made me feel good in the morning.  Plus the smoothie really fills you up too.  Some small changes I made were to use low-fat vanilla soy milk instead of regular non-fat and vanilla yogurt instead of plain and it was amazing this morning!  This recipe is fantastic!  Thanks again!

Definitely not my favortie smothie.  I used agave instead of honey and left out the protien powder.  I think it needs more banana and less milk.  Nutrionally speaking, this is a very balanced.

Delicious! I love the consistency. I don't have flaxseed and have no idea what it's for, so I didn't use it. I used pineapple juice instead of milk, used a whole serving 3/4 cup of frozen yogurt, with a handful of mixed frozen raspberries and blackberries, and another handful of mixed frozen strawberries and bananas. I also used the 2 tbs protein powder and 6 ice cubes. It was delicious!    Yogurt is good for digestion, so is fiber from all the fruit, not to mention Vitamin C for immune system. Yum!

A great recipe. I used soy milk in place of nonfat milk. Our peach tree was loaded this year, so I used peaches instead of the strawberries. Delicious.

Awesome and such a versatile recipe.  I've been making these almost every day with a variety of fruits since I discovered the recipe.  Thanks!

I've always been afraid to make my own smoothies.  But this is good.  I followed it almost exsact.  I used pulp free o.j. instead of milk and my flax was milled. You do notice the texture of the powder and flax, but it isn't bad.  I made blueberry/banana for myself and mixed berry for my husband. I wasn't hungry for about 4 hours. Hope they will replace my husbands no breakfast routine.

Wow!!  I never write reviews, but after taking one sip of this smoothie, I had to sit down and write one.  I used vanilla protein powder and flax seed oil and it was perfect.  I have never tasted anything so delicious.  And it gives you all the things you need after working out!

So yummy!  I substitute a blackberry, strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry mix for the plain strawberries and it's super delicious!

This smoothie is great.  The only thing I'm doing different is using flax seed oil, a couple of teaspoons, and it is wonderful!  It really does keep me full for several hours.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I use chocolate protein in this and I don't use the flaxseed oil I use the normal flaxseed. I love it and I will make this every day. It's keeps me full for a couple hours.
