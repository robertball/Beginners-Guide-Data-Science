Loved this recipe!  We are cutting back the bad fats from our diets, so there were some modifications... all successful:  I used 2 Tablespoons butter, rather than 4.  For milk, I used 1% milk... canned non-fat milk would have been good, too.  For the Parmesan cheese, I used the non-fat kind that is sold in a shaker can.  I used leftover poached salmon (skin removed), rather than smoked.  And, I was out of fresh spinach, so thawed a box of frozen chopped spinach and used it.  This tasted so rich, with a wonderful blend of flavors.  It is easy to eat low fat foods, when they taste this great!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Shane.

Good recipe.  I'll make this again.  I took the suggestion from another poster and added a little cream cheese. I only had skim milk and the sauce wouldn't have been creamy without it. I also used freshly grated parmesan; I wouldn't used the canned stuff.  Used about 1 tsp of dried oregano since I didn't have fresh oregano on hand.  Baked salmon in the oven rather than using smoked salmon (seasoned with a little olive oil and italian seasoning).  Also added some toasted almond slivers (very nice addition!).  I would have preferred pine nuts but did not have any.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and we were pleased. My husband doesn't like fish so I put very little salmon in his bowl.  He actually added more fish!  I couldn't believe it.

This recipe really does taste like something you would order at a good restaurant.  It was very easy to make.  The only thing I would change is to maybe add a little white wine to the sauce.  The blend of oregano, capers, & smoked salmon was wonderful.  I used fresh oregano from my herb garden & it was perfect.  I also used bow tie pasta instead of fettuccine.  It was very pretty & would be great to serve to company with a salad & crescent rolls.

I'm so excited to share my experience about this great recipe! I've made it at least 4 times and it only gets better everytime I make it! -Used some of the modifications sugg. by another fan of this recipe, and with some of my own little changes, it is now a perfection! I saute the fresh spinach with some garlic and olive oil along with the sundried tomatoes and italian spices then once that's cooked just enough, I add it to the white sauce. I even used the baby size shrimps instead of the salmon a couple of times and it was super!

I tried this last night, making a few changes acording to what I had in the cupboards, used fresh fettucine, bit of wine and cream cheese (like the other reviews suggested)I found that the sauce was really thick so I let it down with white wine which added to the flavour! Also I started off by lightly frying a finely chopped small onion & garlic in some of the sundried tomato oil. I must agree, the end result is as good as a restaurant dish!

Will definately be making this one again, it is fast, simple and tastes great!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it had really good flavor although I wish it would have specified that you have to simmer the sauce for a LONG time to get the right consistency. Mine was kind of gritty but now I know for next time! I used italian seasoning instead of oregano and diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried. No capers.

I treked this recipe alot after reading reviews and its a keeper for sure! I used leftover grilled salmon -left out capers -added several cloves of minced garlic - few slices of  mushrooms - used 2 tsp oregano -1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and added about 1/4  cup  white wine and squirted fresh lemon juice over it  --wow  its so good!!  - its really a fancy dish!  I would like to try the smoked salmon version with capers -probably has alot of different flavor -I really think this dish  needs garlic! thanks for sharing this recipe--I will  be making  it again for sure.

Excellent recipe! Great way to use left over salmon steaks. I recommend subsituting cream cheese instead of butter- this is a restaraunt quality recipe.

I made this exactly according to the instructions.  I am surprised that no one else said anything about the consistency of the sauce.  Because it uses flour/milk instead of cream, it comes out the thickness and color of roux (and has flour lumps unless you sift it).  I tasted it while cooking, and it tasted like nothing; and that was after I added garlic to it.  So, I added salt.  Of course, after this it only tasted like salt.  After I added all of the other ingredients the dish didn't look appetizing at all.

I grilled a piece of salmon and omitted the flour and milk and used heavy cream instead. I also used 1tsp dried oregano. My husband loved it. I did not try it because I don't like salmon.

This recipe is excellent.  I didn't have capers or sundried tomatoes, but added sauteed mushrooms and garlic, delicious.  For the poster who said it took too long for sauce to thicken, add the flour to the melted butter to make roux, and then slowly add the milk.  It thickens up pretty quick that way.  At first I thought the sauce wouldn't be rich enough using milk instead of cream, but I was wrong.  The sauce was probably the best alfredo sauce I've ever had.

Great mix of flavors. I added a dash of onion powder, garlic powder, and used fresh salmon fillets. It was absolutely fabulous. Thanks for sharing!

Exactly what I was looking for.  So easy and perfect ingredient proportions.  I seasoned a slamon filet with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning and sauteed in a tablespoon of olive oil.  I melted 2 tablespoons of butter into the pan I sauteed the salmon in with a few cloves of minced garlic.  I then added the milk and followed the recipe exactly from that point except that I added twice the amount of spinach.  Great, simple, tasty recipe.

Loved it! I did make a few small changes, only because of what I had on hand. Used evaporated milk (no regular in house) and thinned with white wine, added a tsp. of minced garlic and fresh mushrooms (we love 'em & they needed to be eaten). Also just a tad of lemon juice and S&P. And I did use smoked salmon and about 1 T dried oregano (had no fresh). Yummmm!!!

This is an awesome dish!  Very flavorful! I made some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers like the sauteed shallots, garlic and white wine.  I think I may use heavy cream next time instead of the milk just for a creamier consistency.  I won't worry about the calorie count since I won't be eating this all the time, but I will be making it again.  Thanks!

The entire family (10 and 12 y.o.) loved this.  Small changes: melt butter, then stir in flour to make roux.  Then, blend in milk w/ maybe 2-3TBL white wine.  Bring to light boil to burn off alcohol.  Assembly: add cooked or smoked salmon, capers, and tomato to drained fettucini.  Add fresh spinach to cream sauce, place lid on and allow to cook for 2 -3 minutes or until spinach lightly wilts.   Serve sauce over pasta mixture and serve.  Excellent.

I also tried this with pan fried chicken, very good. When i tried it with the smoked salmon, I put in too much salmon and it was a bit overpowering.  Otherwise an amazing recipe.

Simply delicious!!  To make things quicker I bought a fresh Alfredo sauce instead of making the white sauce with parmesan cheese, used sundried tomato pesto instead of sundried tomatoes and added some pre-cooked baby shrimp together with the salmon.  Definitely a keeper!!!  YUM!

This was a very good recipe.  I made a few alterations based on some suggestions:  1) I added 1 tbsp minced onion and 1 clove of garlic, minced to the butter and sauteed until tender.  2) Instead of adding the flour after to the milk/butter, I made a roux by adding the flour to the butter and gradually adding the milk.  However, I found that doing it this way caused it to became too thick, and I had to add extra milk.  3) While still yummy, I found the Parmesan flavor slightly overpowering.  We love Parmesan, but I was expecting more of a smoked salmon/spinach/caper flavor, and found that they came second to the cheesy flavor.  Next time I would cut the Parmesan in 1/2.  Overall, very delicious!

Entire family approved.  This was excellent and very simple.  I didn't have correct tomatoes, but used fresh instead and just heated them quickly in a skillet.  Will make again and again and again!  Thank you for sharing.

I made this for my family - my husband, his parents, and our kids. It went over very well. My husband was talking about it when he woke up the next morning!   There were a few things I did differently, but I imagine this recipe to the letter would be terrific. I did a 50/50 mix of half and half and milk; I used fresh salmon that I precooked on the grill; and for simplicity I used pre-grated Parmesan cheese. It turned out wonderful. Served with garlic toast.   I will try it with smoked salmon next time, because there will certainly be one.   This is a great meal for a dinner party; of course, with people who like salmon!

This was fantastic!! So elegant...my husband was very impressed. Great flavors. The only change I made was to use pesto instead of the cream sauce because I prefer it.

My husband loved this, but I felt that the 1/2 cup of oregano was a little overwhelming and the dish was a little too salty. However, I would make it again using less oregano and eliminating the capers.

This was delicious, my family loved it. The serving size was too small, said serves 4 but only served 3. Need to increase amounts.

Very good recipe. I made it just as listed except I wasn't sure about capers so I used only 1 Tbsp. We all loved it. I might try adding more spinach next time, but honestly, this recipe doesn't need changing.

Overall, a good recipe... I'd recommend making a roux (melt butter, mix in flour, cook a min or two, then slowly add milk) then add the cheese, etc. I think a little more of the sauce would've been better, but I just added a little more milk to stretch it because I was lazy. I wasn't able to get to the store as planned so I had to omit the capers, which I think would've really elevated this dish as Shane intended...so don't skip them! I DID skip the oregano as it didn't seem like it would be a good fit for the dish. A great way to use up some smoked salmon - I was pleasantly surprised. :)  **I  may play around with it next time and melt in some cream cheese... I thought that might be good too...

This was great.  I sometimes find canned alfredo sauce to be kind of bland but this was so good and easy I won't eat it any other way from now on.  I didn't have most of the ingredients, just the salmon really, but I followed some other reviewers and added some basil and garlic.

This didn't taste very good, and the sauce got all clumpy. The only changes I made were to use bow-tie pasta and dried oregano. This could definitely use some white wine and garlic, if only the consistency of the sauce was right. Lots of good ingredients, too bad it wasn't a favourite. Next time I'll stick to my favourite Alfredo recipe from AR and add some of these ingredients. Perhaps there were too many add-ins and this added to the bad result. Won't make again.

It all sounds good on paper, but was just a bit too much when all mixed together.  We love all the ingredients separately so it was unfortunately a disappointing recipe.

Awesome!  One of my top 3 faves ever!! The only change was leaving off the capers & adding baked salmon instead of smoked.  Great dish!

Wow, this is excellent.  I would only make this using real grated Parmesan cheese, either grate it yourself or buy it as grated shreds...not the kind that you shake out of a jar!  You will save a lot of salt by avoiding the canned Parmesan.  Even with the real Parmesan it was still ever so slightly salty, so next time I will try using unsalted butter.  This time I used shrimp, but will use left-over grilled salmon (or smoked salmon if I can afford it) in the future.  For the sauce, I only used 2T of butter, added 1/8 tsp cayenne as well as a little parsley, and used white wine to thin it.  In a separate pan, I used 1/2 T butter to saute fresh minced garlic, 1 tsp dried oregano, a little ground black pepper, then sauteed the shrimp in the mixture and added the fresh spinach at the very end so it was just wilted.  Then I mixed the sauteed ingredients with the sauce and pasta.  I did not have capers on hand this time.  This was a restaurant quality dish.

I made this last night, and thought it was excellent.  I'm giving it four stars because I made a few modifications as suggested by others.    I used salmon I baked in the oven, not smoked, and I used baby spinach that I sauteed in some olive oil with finely chopped garlic and onion.  When I added the spinach to the sauce I added it with the garlic and onion.  I also added some white wine, and some ground black pepper.  I only had dried oregano so I used a couple tsps of it instead of fresh.      I used 1% milk, and I thought the sauce was a thick enough consistency, without being too thin or too grainy.

Made (4 serving size) as printed except changed amt to 1 tbsp oregano (who would use 1/2 cup?!?!?!?). Recipe is delicious, but will cut capers in half next time, thin out the sauce with chicken broth, add half cut mushrooms, 1/2 tsp garlic, dash of cooking wine, and cut butter in half. Didn't like the smoked salmon, so will grill salmon next time, or use shrimp and artificial crabmeat. Also will add a little cream cheese on a batch sometime.

We loved this.  We used fresh salmon (just baked it in the oven and then cut it up) and skim milk.  Also used marjarine instead of butter.

I followed some of the suggestions and used cream cheese to thicken the sauce. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of sundried and added portobello mushrooms! Used bow tie pasta also! It was great...a big hit! Will definitely make again!

Didn't have smoked salmon, so I took fresh salmon, added salt and pepper, put melted butter on top and mixed together parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs (equal parts of both) and sprinkled it on top, baked at 400F for 12-15 minutes until flaky. Made the cheese mixture as suggested, but didn't have capers or sun-dried tomatoes, so I added subdried tomato pesto instead.  Mixed the fettucine with the cheese/ pesto mixture and then added the salmon on top.  My husband loved it!

tasty! would have given it 5 stars except i changed the recipe a bit. i used grilled salmon in place of smoked, used nonfat milk, only used half the parmesan called for and left out the tomatoes (didn't have any) and used whole grain angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine. and i doubled the spinach! so good! i was impressed that even when you cut the fatty ingredients down it still tasted amazingly rich!

Very quick and easy dish to make. I had to improvise with the ingredients I had. Used canned pink salmon, fat free milk, a few tbsp of sour cream, canned spinach, and chopped fresh tomato. Even with all these changes, the dish was very tasty. Thanks!

CAUTION: Taste as you cook, especially when it comes time to add the oregano!  I would have given this recipe a higher rating had it not been for the overwhelming amount of oregano.  I changed this recipe for 10 servings so I don't know if the conversion was wrong but 1 & 1/4 cup of the spice was entirely too much for my liking!  I might try this again without the all the oregano.

I was in a pinch for dinner last night, and used the Allrecipes ingredient search option to find this recipe.  I used a 1 lb. salmon fillet which I marinated in Italian Dressing for a few hours and grilled it on George Foreman before cutting it in chunks.  I doubled the sauce to compensate for the amount of salmon and spinach (I thawed a 10 oz. box of chopped spinach) but I kept the amount of capers and sun-dried tomatoes the same.  I really enjoyed this, I thought it was very tasty and yet chock full of yummy good-for-you foods.  Hubby enjoyed too, but stated he would enjoy it better with chopped chicken instead of salmon.  oh well, he's never been much of a fish eater.  I would probably give this recipe a 3.5 star rating if that was an option.  Recipes only get 5 stars from me if both husband and I agree on it.

This was pretty good. I used leftover salmon instead of the smoked stuff and cut back on the cheese and butter in an attempt to cut back on the calories a bit. I added fresh chopped mushrooms. It did taste good, but the mushrooms gave the sauce an odd color so if you add those.. beware! Next time I make this I think I'll play around with the seasonings a bit. Good recipe as is though.

This recipe was okay, but it just didn't seem to be anything really special.  I think that maybe adding some more texture to it might help.  Also, if you changed the type of smoked salmon used, that might help.

A bit salty with the capers and smoked salmon--but a winner otherwise.  I think the salmon may be a bit overpowering  (and I love smoked salmon)  so I may try it without next time.

I left out the capers since we don't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We LOVED it!

I used healthier alternatives: 
Low-fat milk instead of whole milk,
almond flour instead of AP flour,
nutritional yeast instead of parm cheese. 

Add some salt because the nutritional yeast isn't as flavorful as parm cheese. I also cut down on the butter by half.

Super delicious.  I used only 3 TBSP butter and non-fat milk instead of full-fat.  I substituted spaghetti squash for the pasta and gruyere/swiss blend for the parm.  I didnt have fresh spinach so I added 2 cups chopped frozen.  I couldnt find fresh oregano so I used fresh cilantro.  Very rich and filling, yum!  Around 330 calories...

Excellent flavor.  I didn't have capers so I used garlic salt and it meshed well.  Other than that, I did exactly as it says and it was very good.

Somehow the consistency was too cheesy and too thick.  The taste had no depth.  Perhaps I missed something...?

Add garlic, and this recipe is delicious.  Someone said to add sliced roasted almonds, so I tried it, but I did not like the addition of the almonds. It gave it a crunchy texture every now and then which I personally don't think goes with this recipe at all. I kept thinking it was a piece of fat or an undercooked noodle. My husband didn't mind it though.  I actually used Costco's salmon burgers from the frozen food section, and it worked out really well.  I did not add capers because I didn't have any, but I think it would have really added to the flavor.  My favorite part of this recipe was the sun dried tomatoes. I didn't chop them up, and I added WAY more than 1/4 cup, because we LOVE them. I didn't have enough parmesan cheese, so I used a half cup shredded mozzerella cheese and it turned out fine--I think the mozzerella helped added to the creaminess of the sauce because I had used skim milk.  One thing I should NOT have done is I used too much pasta (about 16 ounces). I should have doubled the whole recipe so it wasn't spread so thin.  Last thing I changed was I used a whole bag of spinach instead of just one cup, because I like a lot of greens in our diet, and I think it helped to absorb and spread out the flavor more.  I will definately make this again, because it was very tastey and very easy!

Love this, but changed it just a bit.  Instead of sun-dried tomatoes I used roasted red peppers, cut out the capers.  I broiled fresh salmon with cajun seasoning and served on top of the pasta.  My husband asks for it at least once a week.

Back away from the capers and oregano...made it twice in two days...wonderful after the alterations.  Will throw the sun-dried tomatoes (homemade the next time) in early for more flavor.  Very nice recipe all round though.  Thank you for sharing.

Yum. Had some left over salmon we had smoked on the pit I needed something to do with and found this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly with excellent results. After reading reviews I was wary of adding salt and since the capers are very salty I'm glad I was careful. It could be very easy to over salt this. It is a wonderful recipe I will make again without any changes. Thank you for the post.

This recipe is AWESOME!  We loved everything about it.  I didn't salt the water and used unsalted butter.  We didn't find it to be overly salty at all.  A lot has to do with the type of smoked salmon you get too.  I doubled the recipe only because the 12 oz. of smoked salmon I had was expiring soon.  We'll be eating this for days.....but that's OK.  It's THAT good.  Thanks, Shane.  Great job copying your local restaurant's recipe.

This was a big hit.  I made this on the fly and did not have a few ingredients.  I was missing capers and I used grilled salmon, and dried oregano.  I can't wait to try again with capers ~ I know it will be even better!!  I did spill some of my white wine in as it did get too thick ~ which is weird considering how little flour there was.  My girls devoured this...and they claim to hate fish!

I had high hopes for this recipe but was very disappointed because this dish was extremely salty. I made as is but used packaged parmesan and dried oregano because I didn't have fresh on hand. Not sure those fresh ingredients would have been enough to make this better.

Delicious, but sauce turned out to be too little or too dry/thick for 8 oz of pasta.  Next time I will add more milk or maybe less flour.

Oh this was yummy.  My picky teenage daughter even gobbled it up!  I made a few adjustments (baked salmon, heavy cream instead of milk, replaced half the butter with cream cheese, and sauteed the spinach with olive oil, shallots and garlic.)  This really could be served in any restaurant.  Next time will try it per the instructions and see which one I like better.  Thanks!

Great, just don't put too much cream cheese if you choose this option.  I used fresh baked salmon instead of smoked.  Not a fan of capers so added feta for a different salty twist.

Okay, but not the best. I don't know where I went wrong. I followed the recipe to the "t" but the blend of flavors just didn't go well for me. I ended up giving the whole pan to my neighbors who love spinach dishes and they loved it. So maybe it was just my household tastebuds :-)

Love the base of this recipe -- not too creamy, not to heavy.  I used 2 cups of uncooked spinach, added 2 handfuls of crimini mushrooms, 1 clove garlic, 1.5 tsps Italian seasoning to the veggie mixture.  I also added salt, and 1/4 cup white wine. Could have done without the salmon (I was not a fan, and I love salmon), because the sauce alone is so tasty. All in all, an AWESOME dish -- and such a hit! I will definitely be making this again, with my "tweaks" and perhaps with chicken or no meat next time.

Delicious!!

Halved the cheese and didn't use fresh and it turned out great!

Threw the tomatoes and capers in the blender so they wouldn't be chunks.

So good even after I cut down on almost all the butter!
I did not have smoked salmon so I baked some salmon with salt, pepper, some fresh ginger and a little bit of garlic at 375 for 12-14 minutes.
For the sauce, I just use half a tablespoon of butter.  I cut down the milk by half and did not use flour.  
This is was soooo good!  Thank you so much for posting this!

I only had mackerel filet (broiled in oven on high on top rack for 2 1/2 minutes) so I used that instead.  It came out a little saltier because of the mackerel so I had it with an extra handful of spaghetti (all I had).  This dish was yummy the day I made it, and it was more yummy the day after.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I don't get it...did EVERYONE rate this recipe using SMOKED Salmon?? I didn't care for the smokey taste, I thought it was too overpowering.  I didn't use the capers either.  Next time I will try it maybe with unsmoked.  The other stuff was good.  :-)

So incredibly delicious! The color of this dish is beautiful also! Only suggestion I have is to double the amount of pasta because this recipe makes plenty of sauce for a full 16 oz box of fettucine.  Made this for friends and they were very impressed :)

I wanted to impress a guy and made this...and he was beaming with delight at how great this was!!!  He wasnt sure that he'd like capers but I do so I used them.  He loved everything!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  To add a contrast in color I used spinach fettuccine, which complements the color of the salmon sauce mixture.  And I actually used 3/4 pound of smoked salmon fresh from the market.  Definately a keeper and I will make it again and again for a definate crowd pleaser that takes absolutely no time at all.  GREAT RECIPE.  THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!!

We used cream and milk to make it creamier. Also upped the milk volume a bit because it was so thick.

The amount of oregano is a bit excessive, smoked salmon overpowers the flavor of it all, did not use capers, a little bit on the salty side.  Overall I liked the idea of the recipe, will make minor modifications next time. =)

Excellent! We LOVED this dish and had it for a nice romantic meal. We used salmon fillets instead of the smoked salmon, and had no capers on hand. It was delicious and one of our favorites!

I used fresh baked salmon in this recipe. My husband loved it, but I guess I prefer my salmon by itself, not in a dish. It's an OK recipe, but, I doubt I make it again.

I found this recipe after buying smoked salmon on a whim and not knowing what to do with it that both of us would like. It was good. I realized too late that I only had a little Parmesan and used cream cheese to make up the difference. I used dried Italian seasoning instead of the fresh oregano. I only had 1 T capers so use olives to make up the difference.

I really thought this was going to turn out great - until I added the half cup (?!?!) of fresh oregano! The whole dish tasted like floral soap :( Would be better without it at all - and add some pepper and garlic too to the sauce too.

My husband gave it a 5 but I thought too salty (and I used unsalted butter). I made exactly as listed and way too thick so added LOTS more milk. I thought the 1/2 lb of smoked salmon was overpowering as were the capers.  Guess I will try again and make some changes.

This is delicious and not too much trouble.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and thin the sauce a little bit with some white wine.  And I substituted some sauteed kale for the spinach because my husband hates cooked spinach.  I hesitated to add the tomatoes because, eeewww, but since i was following a recipe, I threw them in.  I was glad they did!  They were a delicious addition!

I doubled the recipe for a full pound of Penne Rigate.  Don't usually do that the first time I try a recipe, but I had a lot of spinach. Wish I would have had smoked salmon,  it would have probably been ten stars. Other than doubling the recipe and using regular salmon, I followed recipe exactly, it was very rich . Thanks for the great recipe.

The dish turned out really salty and my husband complained it was too fishy. So next time I would use cooked fresh salmon and use only 4 oz of it.

1/23/17 - Made a second time, this round I doubled the amount of milk for the sauce, used canned tomatoes, added in some saut√©ed mushrooms and still left out the capers, as the fish makes it salty enough.  Delicious!

1/28/16 - Really enjoyed this recipe, giving it four stars but believe it could easily be 5 stars with a few tweaks:  I doubled the milk in the recipe to thin out the sauce (Daughter said it was still too cheesy).  I also would leave out the capers next time, as it was a little bit too salty for my taste (the smoked salmon has a lot of salt).  The sauce was very light and flavorful!

I tried to follow the recipe as closely as I could this first time but there were some ingredients I did not have. I didn't have capers or sun dried tomatoes so I left out the capers and used fresh tomatoes instead (and being a fan of tomatoes in dishes like this I used a lot more, as in  two whole small tomatoes).  I decided to use half milk, half heavy cream to make it a bit creamier. I used fresh parmesan and not the other stuff. I didn't have much spinach so I used what I had and supplemented with chopped kale. All in all, it was delicious and I will definitely be doing this again.

Loved it! Only had whole wheat flour, so had to add a little extra milk to thin it out. Only had 1% milk, so added 2 TBS of half & half. Other than that, we made as per the recipe. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow night. My husband said, " Honey, this one's a keeper!"

I cannot tell you how delicious that fresh oregano is in there!!!  This was the highlight for me...very surprising how delicious the combo of fresh oregano with the capers and salmon! This was so much better than I thought it would be!  The only ingredient that I did not have on hand was the sundried tomatoes so I sauteed some sweet grape tomatoes with some fresh garlic and spinach and added to the milk, butter, cheese, salmon mixture. Put fewer capers and more spinach. It's a keeper.

the smoked salmon overpowers the dish. Can't taste the other ingredients. Sauce came out very thick and gloppy. I'll move on and not make this again.

This is a great blend of flavours. I made this for 8 people for dinner and used costco alfredo sauce since I did not have the time. Also only dried oregano and omitted the parmesan since the premade sauce had lots in it. Great blend with the spinach (frozen) and sun dried tomatoes and smoked fish.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written with these exceptions: I melted butter in saucepan, stirred in flour and cooked it whilst stirring for about 5 mins THEN added the milk. I added one clove chopped garlic (which wasn't necessary and next time will probably try without). Afterwards I topped with fresh ground pepper which really tied the flavours together. It turned out beautifully rich, delicious and bursting with flavour. Two main suggestions to bring this dish to perfection: slightly less to about half the amount smoked salmon and halve the capers. That's it. It was delicious.

Great recipe and very easy to put together.  Instead of wine I put a little parmesan cheese and garlic sauce in it and it was delicious.  This will be included on my weekly menu for the family.

This was so easy!  I used cream cheese instead of butter, as the reviews advise, and I added mushrooms.  A rich, cheesy, luscious pasta dish!

Doubled the recipe, didn't use smoked salmon and omitted capers. Tasty and easy to prepare. Only problem I ran into was when I mixed in the Parmesan, it seemed to glue everything together and the salmon clumped together instead of flaking apart... Other than that, overalll yummy flavours.

omg this was excellent!! i was looking for something to salvage my salmon from a recipe i didn't care for.. i was worried about using coconut milk instead of regular milk (lactose intolerant etc.) but it still came out great.. one wouldn't be able to tell.. used run of the mill parm.. frozen spinach.. a little bit of cooked tomato leftover from the above mentioned dish since i had no sun dried and dried italian seasoning instead of fresh oregano and a few dashes of pepper as me and bf are pepper feinds.. there was also a little bit of onion in the other dish so i threw that in as well.. ty for making me and bf fat happy uncalifornians

I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't have any capers or oregano.  Still delish and definitely use fresh parm, not the pre-shredded stuff.
