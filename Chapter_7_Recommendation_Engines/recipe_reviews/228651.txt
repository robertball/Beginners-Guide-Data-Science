In reviewing the ingredients there's nothing in the recipe to make it "Italian" so I'm kinda scratching my head as to why it was added as part of the description. Made the recipe as written and baked up fine. I was a bit concerned with the finished texture of the Mac/Cheese it wasn't creamy cheese but more of a firm flan/custard like sauce after baking. There's not much "cheese" IN the recipe so much as its a topping. My husband enjoyed it and 1 of 2 boys did as well. I just couldn't get around the texture and lack of cheese in the sauce and lack of seasoning. I included Italian seasoning into this recipe so at least I'd be able to say its Italian Mac & Cheese.

Made it by the recipe with no changes except I used 16 oz of macaroni to stretch my budget. Came out good. A little on the plain side. Like Maria above I don't understand the "italian" part of the recipe title. But this made a easy mac and cheese for a side dish. Next time I might put in some Gouda or Munster too.

I didn't add salt. The boullion and ham lends enough.

Yeah there's nothing Italian about this and the texture isn't great. The flavor's okay it's just the texture I didn't care for.
