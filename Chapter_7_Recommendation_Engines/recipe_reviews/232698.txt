The biggest problem I had with this cake was the cream syrup.  Yes, the syrup was tasty, but IMO there simply was too much of it.  It totally saturated the cake making it sticky and gooey.  I understand that it added moisture, but the cake was soggy from top to bottom.  When I poured on all of the syrup, there was so much that I thought there was no way it would soak into the cake. I used a toothpick and poked holes in the top of the cake to help the syrup seep in.   And how you're supposed to get a cake baked in a 9x13 pan that has been saturated with syrup removed in one piece from the pan to a wire rack after 10 minutes is beyond me.  When first baked, I sliced a small piece, tasted it, and there was a decent flavor balance between the tart cranberries and the sweet glaze.  However, later in the day, the berries discolored to purple and the sweet syrup just overpowered the cranberries.   The cake's presentation was not good, and I ended up just piling whipped cream on the top to serve as a Christmas dessert.  If I were to make this again, the first thing I would do is cut the amount of syrup in half.  Sorry dday515 for the critical review, but this was a disappointment and just didn't work in this house.

Best desert EVER!!!!  My old-time favorite recipe is almost identical with the following changes. Evaporated milk instead of regular, no eggs in the cake, and increase the heavy cream in the sauce to 1 cup. Increase bake time to 30-40 minutes, and heat sauce to a rolling boil then simmer 10 minutes.

I made this yesterday and the family loved it! The only alteration I made was to add a tsp of Saigon cinnamon to the dry ingredients because I love the taste of cranberries and cinnamon.

This cake is fabulous and very pretty! Everyone loved it. I made just minor changes. I used 2 cups and 4 tablespoons of cake flour instead of the all purpose and I only used half of the cream glaze. I didn't want it to be soggy.

This cake is delicious! The only alteration I made was what others suggested on halfing the sauce. Perfect recommendation. In the sauce I used cinnamon and cloves instead of vanilla extract. It was a wonderful combination.

This is a tasty cake & very easy & quick to make.  I did feel there was too much sugar sauce for the top, so I cut it in half - 
1/4 c. Butter, 1/2 c. Sugar, 1/4 c. Whipping cream or milk.  I also put almond extract in the batter as well as the topping.  Also put Cool Whip & almonds on top.

I added 1/2 sugar to the batter, as a similar cake I tried called for the same amount, and it was too tart. However, 1 cup would've been sufficient, because of the addition of the sweet sauce on top. The cake was moist, sweet and tart, and delicious. It got rave reviews at the holiday party!

This was way better the second day.  The poured mixture didn’t seem to soak in very well at first.  Kids loves it though, we ate it right out of the pan with whip cream!

I made this cake as directed except I didn't have heavy cream for sauce so I used sweet cream (cold stone) creamer. I used a bundt cake pan and poked holes in cake before pouring sauce. I also added a little cinnamon to sauce. Very delicious. Will make again.

I made no changes.  This cake is excellent.  I especially like the tangy taste of the berries against the sweet sauce.

1.13.17 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232698/fresh-cranberry-cake/ ... As I poured it in the dish, this looked like one of those cakeoverthefruit type cobblers. It isn't, but it's not exactly typical cake either.  'Didn't attempt (wouldn't if I were you) to take it out of the pan.  The sauce makes an already delicate cake (because it isn't very high & full of fruit)  more likely to cause - well, it wouldn't be pretty.  Mine took longer to bake.  The sauce should, too.  The reviewer that suggested boiling then simmering had the right idea, I think.   Mine has a very slight "crinkle" when cut; not cooked long enough.  Because of it being not as thick, it didn't spread evenly, but the taste was good.  Another reviewer that served it on the side may have the best result - an almost attractive bar that tastes good.  I subbed one cup with blueberries since all my crans weren't "happy" so it was a little darker, but similar.

I didn't make any changes except for the fact that I didn't have brown sugar and vanilla extract. Substituted brown sugar with white sugar and reduced the total amount by 25%. I took it for my daughter's preschool Christmas party. It got over. Needless to say, I will make it again.

Made  2 cakes in  8" square pans. One to keep, one to give away.
I used all but 1/2 cup of the sauce and make ice cream sundaes with it.

This cake is quick and easy to put together.  I substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream in the sauce.  Instead of pouring over the entire cake, we put it over individual pieces.  Very yummy!
