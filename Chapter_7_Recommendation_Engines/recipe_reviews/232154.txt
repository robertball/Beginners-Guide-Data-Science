Good recipe, but most buttermilk recipes have baking soda.  I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the white flour and just added everything in one bowl.  I'm sure beating the egg whites and folded them it would make a nicer waffle.  Re the other review: There is no need to soak the oatmeal, it cooks in the batter when you cook the waffle.

A nice, hearty waffle with good flavor.  The only change I made was to soak the oatmeal in the milk for approximately 15 minutes to soften before mixing.

Made this recipe for my mom who's on a restricted diet. The only change I made was swapping the flour with whole wheat and it was great.

Very good. Made this watching my five and a half month old, so I simplified the directions and didn't separate the eggs out. Still turned out well. Added blueberries to the batter for hubs, who loves them. He really enjoyed these, and we had enough to freeze for another time.

I ground the oatmeal into flour.  This thickened the batter a bit and I had to add extra milk. The waffles turned out light and fluffy...just right.  Nice, simple flavor.  I did use whole wheat pastry flour.  Next time I would like to try brown sugar, or cinnamon.  I think this recipe is a great base for lots of variations.

Liked it for the most part. I used whole wheat flour instead just for personal preference. My only complaint is the amount of butter. I think I'll try a bit less next time. Otherwise, fantastic.

Super YUMMY! I didn't have buttermilk on hand but that didn't stop me :)  I made buttermilk myself by using milk and lemon juice. Waffles turned out wonderful still! Thanks for recipe!!

Excellent but without any oil in batter sticks to waffle iron if not oiled first.

These were great! I did as another review suggested and just mixed the eggs in as-is. I did not separate. And they turned out just fine. Yum!

The best waffle, I have ever tasted! Crispy on the outside & soft on the inside. I always make extra & freeze them separately once the are completely cooled off. When I’m ready to eat another waffle at a later time, I place in my toaster at the lowest setting & defrost mode. Once it pops up I flip the waffle upside down & toast at the lowest heat setting. It’s absolutely perfect each time!!

These were a great change up to the normal waffles.  I was so glad my two guys enjoyed them too, they are very particular with their waffles.

I added cooked quick oats leftover from breakfast and wasn't able to get the egg whites to peak (probably because the beaters had batter contents) but added them all at once after beating them to a froth.  Flavor was fantastic and since we like moist soft waffles they were perfect!  Added the vanilla to the rest of the liquid ingredients.

I love this recipe!  I substituted rolled oats and added about 1/8 cup extra flour, the let it sit for 5 minutes before cooking.

As someone from Scandinavian descent, I love anything that includes oatmeal. These are fabulous!! My only wish was that I had some sour cream and lingonberries or chokecherry to put on it.

Wow.. I can't believe how perfect these are.  I've been looking forever for a good from scratch buttermilk waffle recipe.  I wonder how to make these into pancakes!
