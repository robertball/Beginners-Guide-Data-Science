This is the best cheesecake I've made yet! I would suggest adding only 1 1/2 cups of the batter to the melted chocolate chips so that there is more yellow batter in the cheesecake. Also, be careful to only use the given amounts of chocolate syrup and carmel sauce--too much makes it a mess.

This is not one of my favorite recipes. Chocolate lovers would probably really enjoy it, though.  When I mixed the white batter with the melted chocolate chips, it became too thick and wouldn't mix up well.  It did look very dramatic and fancy when completed, too.

Very Good!  Used oreos instead of graham crackers and 2 tb butter instead of 1/3 cup. Also used hot fudge and way more carmel than suggested.
Looks and tastes like something you might buy at the store:)

WOW! That is the word for this Cheesecake! I made it  for dessert on Valentine's Day and it was INCREDIBLE! No one could believe it was homemade! I added milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cheesecake batter only because of preference. Yummy!!

Very Good.  Only one thing that I would change - no lime juice.  Made it a little too sour.  I think it clashed with the sweetness.  It is a keeper for sure!

EXCELLENT Cheesecake recipe! Very easy, considering it is a flavored cheesecake. The only thing I would change would be less chocolate flavored cheesecake, probably cut it down by 1/3 or 1/2. All in all, it was great, and easy! YUM!

A new favorite of mine that I just started making with a few minor changes. First I have made this with a both plain and chocolate graham cracker crust, I prefer the plain, if you truly love chocolate then make the chocolate crust, but it's very rich. For the chips, I have used the semi sweet, but I have also used the swirled chips made by Nestle. For the topping I have followed the recipe but I also have a friend allergic to nuts thus I used the mini morsels but also added white chocolate chips in place of the nuts along with the toppings. No matter what you change as far as the morsels...you can't go wrong, it's so good!

Was a nice enough cheesecake...not much different from others I have made....made my own caramel topping...which is much better than store bought...added caramel and nuts to crust which makes for a more realistic "turtle"

I took this to work for a celebration and it was gone fast.  Even the "healthy" people couldn't resist this.  I didn't change a thing

This was this first cheesecake recipie that I tried.  It was easier then I thought.  It was very, very rich, but very delicious!!  I don't like pecans, but put them in anyway.  Gave it a nice touch.  I made it again, and left it in the oven with the door open, and it didn't crack like the first one.  I love cheesecake.

This makes a very pretty cheesecake, but this is way too much chocolate!!  I would cut the chocolate at least in half.

This was very good! I cut the chocolate mixture down by a third per reviews and because I am not a big chocolate fan. Very tasty and looked professional!

This cheesecake is awesome... I changed the crust, and I used oreos and pecans. That was the best thing that I could have done. I will definitely make this again and again.
