This is absolutely the worst pie I have ever made!! Why wasn't there any vanilla in this recipe?? All this pie tasted like was sweet scrambled eggs!!

This a nice and easy recipe. Only thing I changed is to cut milk to 1&1/2 cups. With 2 cups there is too much left over.

This recipe did not come out and was not to our liking. I followed the directions exactly as written. It tasted like a sweet hard boiled egg. I used 6 large eggs and I had extra filling. I used a store bought pie filling in tin 9 inch as directed. I don't know why I had all the extra filling? Also why wasn't there any vanilla? My husband said it was awful.

Great pie! I used graham cracker crust instead of regular pie crust. I will absolutely make again-maybe with a layer of chocolate on top:)

One of the things that I loved about this recipe was that the cooking time exactly matched up with my pumpkin pie recipe making Thanksgivinp pie cooking that much easier. If you miss the additon of vanilla I suggest putting it in the cup before you add your milk. My BF loved this "eggy" pie and it reminds him of his grandmother's; (my old recipe just didn't do it for him)! It is now a staple recipe.

Although this recipe is very simple I found the end product to be very sweet and a consistency almost like scrambled eggs.

I always add vanilla to custard pie so I didn't pay any attention to it not to being in the recipe. I also omitted the spices because I added coconut to make a cicada nut custard pie....Love!!
