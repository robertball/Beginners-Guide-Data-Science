this cake was very good I used all purpus flour inplace of the matzo cake meal and it came out fine. I also made a glaze by mixing 3 cups powdered sugar, 1/3 cup pink lemon-ade, and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract. everyone at our passover dinner loved it!

I tried to make this cake for a presentation on Passover and i gotta admit, I did not love it.  I tried to add the pink lemonade glaze and it made the cake too moist and the flavor just seemed to clash.  I think I would have liked it more with just whipped cream and some sort of fruit topping.
