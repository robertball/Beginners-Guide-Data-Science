A perfect treat for your lazy afternoon thanks to the coffee ice cubes not watering down your drink.  White chocolate, coffee, and caramel just go well together. Thank you for the recipe.

The wonderful thing about this iced coffee is that it uses coffee ice cubes. I love keeping coffee ice cubes on hand for frozen coffee drinks, and it's wonderful in iced coffee too. No more watered down coffee drinks! The flavor combo is delicious, and I also like that this iced coffee didn't have milk in it. The only change I made was to use just 1 T of syrup, as I didn't want mine to be as sweet tasting. Thanks for sharing your recipe Yoly!
