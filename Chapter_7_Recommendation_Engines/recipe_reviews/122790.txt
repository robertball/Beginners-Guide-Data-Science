AUGUST 31, 2008 - Super easy!! Once everything was in the baking dish I stuck it in the oven and did other things for an hour.    Like a lot of the other reviews I did make a couple SLIGHT changes... nothing major.  I deglazed the pan with the apple juice since there were so many nice brown bits from the pork.  I didn't want to see them burn up while the onions cooked.  THEN I added the onions.  AFTER the onions, I slowly stirred in a couple tablespoons of the left-over flour to thicken the sauce.  Other than that I kept everything else the same.    Everyone LOVED it - even the kids!  VERY TENDER!  Served it with some freshly mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes and steamed julienned carrots.    July 9, 2009 - made it again with same great reactions from family... my 13 yr old daughter even posted a comment about it on her facebook page!!  Now that's GOOD!!

I changed the recipe a fair amount but, I LOVED it. I omitted the flour and sugar and added half the applesauce. I also used about 1.5 tbsp of fresh grated ginger and did the whole recipe stovetop. The sauce is LOVELY and I adored the bite from the ginger. I definitely will make it again.
UPDATE: I just made this again with a ~2lb loin roast (whole) by searing the roast then making the sauce in the searing pan with at least triple the ginger (grated fresh) and doubling the soy sauce. Baked uncovered for 1.5 hours, "basting" with the sauce every half hour. It was delicious!

This was the BEST!   All I had was Trader Joes cinnamon applesauce so that is what I used.  Also, I doubled the ginger and the garlic.  My family loved this.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you very much.

I think this recipe was great, but i changed quite a bit.  First, I chopped the tenderloin into sections and marinated in a mixture of vegetable oil, minced garlic, italian dressing, and red cooking wine for 7 hours while i was at work.  I dipped the pork pieces in egg, then rolled them in flour mixed with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I used 3 1/3 cups sweetened applesauce,1 2/3 cups chopped onion, and added 1/2 cup chopped scallions.  I sauteed the scallions with the onion and garlic in white wine.  I used the regular amount of soy sauce, and added 1/4 cup worcesteshire sauce.  I substituted white wine for the apple juice, tripled the ginger, doubled the garlic, and put in 2 tblsp extra of brown sugar.  My boyfriend and I like extra sauce and extra flavor, and we both loved this recipe!

Ohh... finally moist pork!  Mine always ends up dry, so it was lovely to make tasty, melt-in-your mouth pork tenderloin.  I used home-made applesauce made with Empire apples (from Ontario) and it was such a pleasant, homey meal.  We'll make this again next time tenderloin goes on sale!

I followed this recipe (almost) exactly but I didn't have apple juice so I used white wine in its place. I think it actually added an extra layer of flavor that may have been missing otherwise. Also I only had one pork tenderloin but it worked out because I would have doubled the sauce anyway. Really good recipe!!

Did care for this.  Thought it wasn't worth the 2 cups of applesauce as well as the other ingredients.  Not enough strong flavors. Sorry, I wanted to like it and was looking forward to it, but it wasn't very good.

This was awesome!  I made it as written and the only thing I would change is to add more ginger.  Really moist and flavorful.  My six-year old son even said, "This is the best pork I've ever had!"  Don't hear that very often!  Try it - it's a good recipe.

The only other ingredients that I used was Thyme and Rosemary and apple cider instead of juice. This was the best pork tenderloin we have EVER had!

I thought this was just okay.  It makes a lot of sauce.  Mine was not as moist and tender as some other reviewers mentioned. I followed the directions exactly as stated.  I wouldn't make this again.

This turned out to be a very elegant dish I would serve for company. I used (1) tenderloin that was  a little over 1 lb. & did cut into 6 pcs as directed.  However after the browning, I added 1/8-1/4c white wine and eliminated the apple juice & brown sugar.  Used my homemade applesauce which is sweetened and has a slight cinnamon flavor. Also used about 1 teasp. of fresh grated ginger and about 1/8 c soy sauce and a small clove of garlic & 1/2 c chopped onion. Baked for about 45 min & this will be enough for my husband and I for 2 meals. Very moist, flavorful and delicious!

My boyfriend and I LOVE how tender the meat turns out using this method of cooking.....however we only gave four stars because the sauce, although tasty, was not as savory as it was sweet, making the sweetness stand alone. We will definitely make it again but would add a savory spice of some sort!!!!!!

This turned out great for me & my family really enjoyed it.  My substitutions:   I didn't have any applesauce, so I used applebutter, so I decreased the brown sugar to half the amount-very flavorful.

Loved it!  Didn't have apple juice so I substituted white wine. Used regular "kids" applesauce (ok because didn't have sweetness of apple juice). Combination of flavors was divine. Easy, easy and quick. Kids loved it.

Our young family really likes how sweet and tender this recipe comes out.  It is easy to prepare and is always a hit with everyone at our table.  The flavour is mild, but tasty.  Sometimes we punch it up with a bit more ginger.

This was an exceptional meal.  Full of flavor.  I followed the recipe as is except I used what applesauce I already had and it was sweetened instead of unsweetened.

Everybody loved the recipe.  I didn't have any ginger on hand so I just left it out, also no apple juice.  As another poster suggested, I threw in a splash of white wine instead.  Comments from the family said it was like eating really great ribs without the bone!  Thank you for sharing.  Loved it.

delicious and pretty simple!  what a great sunday dinner...  definitely company worthy!

12/2011  made it again but this time omitted the apple juice and added white wine, deglazing the pan with it before adding onions and garlic.  even more delicious and flavorful this time!

WOW!  This is a simple and REALLY delicious recipe.  I took a few liberties, per previous suggestions, though.  Deglazed pan with white wine, then sauteed garlic and onions.  Also did not have enough applesauce, so I pureed canned pears to round out the 2 cups.   Also subbed 1 1/2 T chopped fresh ginger for powdered ginger.    My family loved it and I will definitely make it again!  Served with rice pilaf (to soak up the yummy sauce) and green beans.

Great recipie, I was pretty unsure how it would come out because of the reviews so I only made it with one tenderloin and made the other BBQ for back up (never know right?) But I wish I would of made both. My husband loved it and he is a plain/simple food guy. I did use cinn. applesauce because thats what I had and it was great. Will make again :)

I, too, found this in Taste of Home magazine.  I made the whole meal shown in the picture exactly as stated.  It is excellent with the garlic mashed potatoes and peas/asparagus side dish.   If I make any changes now it is only because I may not have a couple ingredients on hand.  Otherwise, no changes are needed.

I've made this recipe over and over. It's fabulous. So tender. I leave out the apple juice and use regular applesauce. Season the sliced loin before flouring but add a little season salt to the flour, also. Yum!

I think my boyfriend fell in love with me all over again! Great recipe! I had everything here except the Apple juice and sauce, so instead I used a little can of pineapple tidbits and it was great! I will probably use a bit less soy sauce next time and possibly omit the ginger. Thanks for a keeper!

I'm rating this 5 stars before I even try it because it looks awfully good! (Both the original recipe and the reviewers' suggestions.) My only question is this -- in the seventh sentence of the directions, does "Add remaining ingredients" include the apple sauce? I've never baked pork that way before, but it sounds like it might turn out quite well!

I made this tonight for my husband and I--as well as our picky 3 year old and we all really enjoyed it!!  I didn't have actual garlic cloves so I used garlic powder instead--sprinkled a lot of it on the onion as it was cooking and again once the other ingredients were in the skillet.  I also used regular applesauce.  I thought the flavor was good, but I can see how adding extras of some would make it even better!

One of the best pork tenderloin recipes I've tried. I did add a few more spices, such as some ground red pepper and creole seasoning. The extra boit of spice went great with the sweet mixes.

I made this dish, following the recipe, except that I replaced applesauce with real ground apples and apple juice with orange juice.  I cooked the pork for 45 minutes instead of 1 hour.  I served it with steamed rice and steamed snap peas.  It was tasty and flavorful, and the meat was very tender.  I think I can reduce the amount of juice and / or sugar, as I thought it was a bit too sweet to my taste.  I would also do without flour in frying the meat to be more calorie-friendly.  Overall, it was an interesting experiment.

absolutely delicious and easy to make too! My teenage son loved it too but I did leave the onions out for his benefit. Would definitely make this again. The only thing I'd do differently next time is not cook it quite so long but nevertheless it was very tender still.

This was an excellent recipe for a Sunday dinner.  The cooked applesauce mixture goes so well with pork.  The longest part of the prep is pounding out the meat (between 2 pieces of plastic, BTW).  The browning & then making the sauce was a zip though.  It was well worth the effort.  I served it with rice made with some mint and lime juice, which complemented it nicely and a green salad.  I will keep this recipe and make it again.

The pork does turn out very tender, but the flavor, for me was a little too bland.  My husband liked it, but wasn't in love. Maybe better with fresh ginger, grated, for a little kick.

This was a delicious surprise! It's not surprising that it tasted good as made, just that it still tasted good when I made it!  I followed the directions exactly and even my picky son loved it, tender and pleasantly sauced. Served it with butternut squash, roasted yukon gold potatoes and green beans.

What a great recipe.  It's one of those meals that you just can't stop eating, not to mention it is possibly better the next day as a leftover.   This one is destin to become one of my families all time favorites!

This flavor did not suit my family at all.  My oldest son took one bite and said "sorry mom", my youngest son and daughter said it was ok.  My husband ate it because he was hungry.  I ate it - it was ok.  I rinsed off the sauce and saved the rest of the pork for a fajita recipe for tomorrow.  Certainly not my favorite at all.

I discovered this recipe years ago in a "Taste of Home" magazine.....it is truly delectable! To KOISMITH and AMOMMEE.....did you follow the recipe? Have a friend who ruins things because she tries to cut out 'bad" things, like salt, butter, etc.... Big mistake for this receipe. Sometimes you gotta live a little.

Delicious!  It was easy to make and looked (and smelled) wonderful.  My kids and husband thought it was good too.  I used seasoned salt and garlic and onion powder mixed with the flour because I didn't have garlic.

We love this recipe.  I had to make two changes since I am gluten intolerant -  I substituted rice flour for all-purpose and omitted the soy sauce.  Delicious!  Will definitely make it again!

I thought this came out great!! I did make some changes.  I didn't have brown sugar or the kind of applesauce called for, so I just used regular applesauce.  Didn't worry about the brown sugar, I threw in about a tablespoon of honey.  Then I was short on time and didn't have an hour for it to cook, so I browned it, put it in a microwave cooker and poured the sauce over and cooked it for 15 minutes.  then I put it in the oven to finish it for about 15 minute. Came out great!!
