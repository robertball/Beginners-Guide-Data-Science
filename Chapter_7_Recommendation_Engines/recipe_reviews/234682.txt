This came out perfect. I was looking for this cooked in a cast iron dutch oven. Everyone loved this.

This turned out beautifully. Only change I made was to leave out the sugar as I prefer unsweetened cornbread. I didnâ€™t have a double boiler so I cooked it in a saucepan and stirred constantly and it worked fine. Served it New Years Day with black eyed peas.
