Awesome! Make sure you drain the tomatoes though- if you don't it's a soggy mess.  Well, it was a mess to make in the first place, but it really won't cook right if you don't drain.

Every time I make these for friends or family they can't believe their taste buds!!  These have SO much amazing flavor.  Yes they take finesse and practice to make without a soggy mess but even if they are a soggy mess just keep the roll intact bake it up and serve.  Nobody will care how pretty they are after tasting them!!

This recipe is delicious! I had it at a BBQ and it was like an explosion of flavor of only the best in your mouth in a matter of 4 seconds! Pesto! Crescents! Tomato! OH MY! So attractive, too. Great for everyday snacks or nice for a special italian dinner. Must try :)

This was just ok.  I drained the tomatoes pretty well and still ended up with a soggy mess.  I think it needed more garlic too.  Not sure if will try again.

Terrible.  I made this as an app for my dinner party and never even served it.  Luckily we had alot of other apps so this wasn't missed.  I drained the tomatoes really well and still ended up with a soggy mess.
