I would ask the recipe submitter to please check the quantities listed in this recipe.  You cannot fit all these ingredients in a blender at one time.  I have a 1L blender -  4 cups of milk is almost a litre all by itself, nothing else will fit in!  It just doesn't compute.  Was too much for my food processor as well. Anyway, I mixed everything together and baked in two 9-inch pans. I added the suggested coconut to the 2nd pan but you couldn't taste it.  Though I cooked them for longer than indicated in the recipe, they never baked up properly - gooey in parts, doughy in others.  It's not terribly expensive to make so I might try it again by halving all the ingredients - I would recommend ANYone trying this recipe to go with half the recipe for the first go at it.
