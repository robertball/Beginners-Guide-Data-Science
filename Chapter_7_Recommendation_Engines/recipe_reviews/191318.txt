This halves well and was great alongside Asian food.  I used 1 teaspoon of ginger instead of chopped since that's what I had, also added about 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and some salt.  I used broccoli slaw because I had some in the fridge, and I don't recommend that, but I don't think broccoli slaw would be good with anything.  This dressing was good, though, and I will probably try it again with cabbage as the recipe suggests.

This was a unique and tangy slaw.  I liked that it was creamy without being mayonnaise based.  I used plain Kefir instead of yogurt so it was even more tangy.  I cut the sesame oil to 1tsp because that is all it takes to get the flavor.

Very good! I used less sesame oil than called for, but still found it a tiny bit overpowering. Otherwise it was really good and a great twist on slaw. Thanks :)

This is very unique- I liked it.  I didn't have any honey, but I think it still turned out fine.
