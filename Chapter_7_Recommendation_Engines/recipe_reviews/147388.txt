I made this with one avocado so I halved the recipe. And since one reviewer said it was salty, I did just 2 tsps of ranch dressing mix, squeezed half a lemon and about 3/4 TB of mayo. It turned out good. Nice avocado spread for sandwiches when you want to change it up a little. I'd make it again.

Way too salty!  I think half the amount of seasoning mix would have been plenty.  One positive--it does hold its color well.

all you need to make a great avocado dip/spread is avocado, mayo, lemon and seasoned salt.

Based on the other reviews I did not use a whole package of ranch mix - with really nicely ripe avocados you don't need the mayonnaise - light or not it is just added calories.  Personally, I prefer lime with avocado - the lemon just didn't taste quite right.

This turned out really great. I didn't use the typical Haas avocados because we have green skin avocados which are much larger than regular ones. My avocado was the size of a small pineapple and so I only used one. Since my avocado was so large it wasn't overly salty.  I suggest using less dressing mix or adding another avocado.  My sandwiches will never be the same again! I think this would be great with other dry mixes as well.  Next time I'm going to try taco seasoning or fajita mix or Italian dressing.  The possibilities are endless!  I'm glad I found this recipe!!

After reading the reviews I just sprinkled in the ranch dressing until I got it my taste. I also added red onion. Great recipe!! Perfect on sandwiches or as a dip.

Yummy. It was a little zesty for my liking so I added another avocado and it toned it down enough for me. Will make again for sure

Listening to other reviewers I didn't want it to be too salty. I halved the recipe. I used one avocado, Tbsp of fresh lime juice, 1 Tbsp ranch seasoning mix, and a tiny dollop of lite mayo. This was still so tangy I could barely stand it. I added another 1/4 of avocado and that seemed to tone it down just enough. I now have way more than I need for my two grilled chicken sandwiches, but I'm pretty sure it will turn easily into guacamole.

I thought this was outstanding! Some people stated it was salty, I did not find that to be true for my taste buds.

I would rate it a 5 for being easy. Not very flavorful instead flat and salty.  Used it on ham and turkey on brioche buns sandwiches.  Everyone loved them.

I only used half of the Ranch dressing mix but could have used less as it was still a bit salty.  The lemon really made this spread special, nice and tangy and the creamy avocado which were perfectly ripe.  yummy...  I used it on a turkey, cheese and bacon sandwich (the bacon may have been the salty) and I used it to spread on crackers, it was perfect.

I really liked this spread but i listened to the other reviewers and used 1/2 the ranch dressing. A whole package would have been way too much! I like tangy so i did use 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Was awesome on turkey sandwiches and also as a veggie dip on baby carrots, cucumbers and snap peas. My 12 year old daughter loved it too! Will definitely make this again!

So glad I found this recipe.  Just as others stated in their reviews, only 1/2 a pack of the ranch seasoning is needed.  I didn't add the mayo either. I've never been a fan of avocados/guacamole but I know how good avocado's are for me.  So glad I found a way to enjoy them now.  I will be making this more often for sure.

I really wish I would have read the reviews before I made this.  I would have only used 1 or 2 Tbsp of the ranch dressing mix.  Made as the recipe is written this is salty and inedible.  Normally I read the reviews and alter the recipe accordingly.  But, I saw the 4 stars, and just went forward as I was in a hurry.  Never again.

I should've read the reviews before preparing this recipe. WAY too salty!! I'd use 1/2 packet of the ranch next time.
