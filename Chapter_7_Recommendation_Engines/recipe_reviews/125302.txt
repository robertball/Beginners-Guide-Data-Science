I made this "lighter" so I could have a treat without guilt. I used sugar free instant pudding, nonfat milk, omitted the honey, I used "free" Cool Whip and I used pecans instead of almonds, as that was what I had on hand. I layered this dessert in four custard cups. We all liked this well enough and it was a great dessert using pantry items.

Great dessert! Not too sweet and the zest really brightens the flavor. Great summer treat.
