I think Sara forgot the liquid part of this recipe. I put all the indredients in the mixing bowl and realized it was dry. Maybe Sara should review the recipe to see if it is all there.

This was very easy to make and was a huge hit at my friend's wedding shower. It's moist and rich and worthy of your family recipe box. I highly recommend it.

The cake was ok, but I wasn't expecting it to be so spicy. It isn't very chocolately.
