This is essentially the same recipe that has been passed down in my family however our process is a little different.  First, we mix the flour sugar salt and milk together and use ONLY flour (don't substitute cornstarch due to the pineapple reaction preventing thickening sometimes).  When cooked and thickening, add the DRAINED pineapple till bubbling custard, THEN temper the beaten eggs with a little of the hot custard added to bowl of eggs, mixed, THEN put the tempered eggs into the pan of custard stirring well.   Suggest a thick wooded spoon for this job.  When fairly thick...take off heat...add cold butter...and vanilla and beat with spoon till glossy and well mixed in same pot.  It will be a thick pudding like.  Pour into prebaked pie shell (regular 9 in).  Cover with meringue if you wish.  Otherwise...a piece of buttered WAX paper will sit nicely on top OF THE CUSTARD, touching the surface, after a few minute of cooling.  If put on too soon, condensation may occur...if wait till cool...then a skin may form after a hour or so...all of which won't keep the Texas men from eating every piece.  My family served room temp during cold weather...then IF there was left overs...we refrigerated the 2nd or 3rd pie.  Usually the first pie went as soon as dinner was over.
Using the tempered egg procedure is preferable since things thicken faster than if done the other way IMHO and if it is good enough for grandma...then it is OK with me.  I was the "stirrer" of pie fillings during hol

I am the one who shared this recipe. I used the recipe for Meringue Two today and it was magnificent! It took my grandma's pie over the top! Just wanted to share that and I added a better picture than that years old one of my grandmother's!

My husband's family introduced me to pineapple cream pie about 45 years ago & the recipe was shared with me.  He passed in '02 & I started downsizing. 6 months ago I moved and along the way  one of my recipe boxes  disappeared... hmm..  Needed to make this for Christmas dinner so I went to my favorite AllRecipes.com and found this similar recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and nobody noticed the difference. Thanks so much for sharing your Grandma's recipe. It saved  the day.!

This pie is divine!  I loved it more than coconut cream pie...and that was my favorite pie!  I plan on making this again for Sunday dinner.  Big hit and very easy to prepare.

My grandmother use to make a pie like this for my mom's birthday.  They are both gone and I wanted to try  my hand at  it. The recipe  was easy and turned out as good as I remember.

4 1/2 stars. Grandmas recipe has been replaced! Hers added vanilla after cooking but you taste the pineapple more without adding it.
