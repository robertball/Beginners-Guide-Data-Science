If you've never cooked a tri-tip roast, it's a must. It's the easiest, fastest, and tastiest roast that most people aren't aware of.  This is an old family tried and true recipe that my sister discovered thru a friend many years ago. In my family we bake it in the oven, so good for people who don't like to grill. Great for serving to big parties cuz people just go crazy for it and will ask for the recipe.  Using a dry rub and add a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, marinate overnite. The brown sugar balances out the saltiness of the rub. Make sure the meat is room temperature, and with the fat side up, bake in a 450 oven for 25 minutes. Then with the meat still in the oven, turn oven down to 350 and cook another 25 minutes for medium rare. If you want medium, leave in another 5 minutes. Do not cover with foil while baking, and make sure when it's done to leave it on the counter for 15 minutes to rest before slicing thin. If you don't let it rest, all the juice runs out and looks messy and dries out the meat.   Served best with a salad and baked potato. Enjoy!   This will be the most tastiest and easiest beef you've ever eaten. Most beef roasts take hours to bake, perfect for an after work dinner that you throw in the oven with baked potatoes and leave it alone. Always comes out perfect.

I used this on a tri tip roast but the weather wasn't so great so instead of grilling, I seared in olive oil and then roasted at 325 in the oven till done (about 1hr.15min.).  I reserved a bit of the seasoning to sprinkle on to the roast after searing.  It was really good.  I will use again in the summer when we are grilling more.

THE BEST!!! I wish I could give this 10 stars, it was that good! I did leave the rub on for almost 24 hours and the only thing I changed was to use granulated garlic instead of garlic salt, which worked out fine because this is a salty rub. We even accidentally cooked this a bit too long and it was still superb. I ran to the store to buy another tri-tip while they were still on sale so that I could make this again--soon. I will never cook a tri-tip any other way, now. Awesome!

The BEST rub, ever! I live on the central coast, where Santa Maria style BBQ is #1, and this recipe surpasses that in flavor, hands down! I used it several times for family BBQ's and everyone asks me what my secret is! I cut my salt down to 1/2 TBS and use only Kosher.

Very good. I think the key here is the celery salt and rosemary...possibly the sage. I usually work in a little Worcestershire or steak sauce before applying the rub (for slight carmelization), then broil each side until browned, continue to roast at 370 until done (use a meat thermometer). Amazing results every time!

YUM! This was an excellent Rub. I will keep on using this, it was delicious. I did bake my Tri-Tip (after searing) @ 350 for about an hour or so, I like mine Medium Rare :)

This was my first dry rub and everybody loved it. I did make a couple of changes, I read the other reviews and did cut out the salt and added 2TBS garlic powder, also increased the black pepper from 1/4 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon coarse black pepper, and I cooked it in a rotisserie. This is a keeper for sure.

Excellent choice for grilled tri tip roast. First time, I made the rub exactly as written. Second time, I corrected to 1 tsp salt and crushed celery seed instead of celery salt. Perfection! As other cooks recommended, moistened the meat with worchester sauce before the rub. Personal preferrence only.

This rub was great!!  As other viewers, I omitted the garlic salt & used garlic powder.  That is all I changed.  I had a 2 1/4 lb roast.  Roasted it in oven @ 425 degrees for 40 min; tented it, and it was moist and delicious.  My tri-tips have never turned out this great and moist.  Served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and salad.  It is only me & hubby, so we will be having leftovers tonight, and if any left, will be making 'fajitas' tomorrow for lunch.  YUMMO!!

This review is just for the flavor of the rub.  It is excellant!  One change, just used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, personal preference. I use it on sirloin tip roast, bake at 500 degrees for 10 min per pound then turn oven off for an additional 10 min per pound, do not disturb, no opening to take a peek. Then remove and cover with foil and let rest 15-20min.  Perfection everytime.  And the juices produced....so yummy to dip the meat in.  Everyone I have made this dish for loves it.  Thank you!

This is an excellent rub! The first time I made it exactly as the recipe and it was 5 stars, hands-down the best tri tip I've ever had (and I live in Central CA where Santa Maria Tri Tip reigns supreme!).

The second time I made two changes: add 1 tbsp brown sugar and rub the tri tip very lightly with 1/8 tsp worcestershire sauce before applying the rub. Even better!

Sorry but.....Waayyy too much salt as written.  And we didn't really care for the herb-y flavor.  Think we'll stick with our typical seasonings -- similar to this, but tons more garlic, and nothing "green".

This was really tasty but I took off 1 star because I cut the salt in half like many have suggested (& used Kosher salt); I doubt I would have liked it at all with the full amount. My tip: put the dry ingredients in an empty spice jar, makes it so much easier to mix & sprinkle on the spices! (Never occurred to me to do this until after I'd been cooking over 20 years, read the tip somewhere & thought "well...duh...." & I now do this with recipes at least once a week.)

This is without a doubt the BEST tri tip we have ever had! The only change I made was to add an extra 1/4 tsp of dill, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Then I followed happywifey's directions for baking in the oven. Then I take it out, put foil on it for 15 minutes and then slice! Comes out perfect every time. I am always asked to make this. This is the only way I will ever cook tri tip again. This recipe is a winner!!

My hubby is usually the one who makes all steaks, ribs, etc.. but this is one recipe I found and made that he requests over and over again!  He usually has me buy 2 so we have lots of left overs.  The only changes I made was to cut the salt in half (like others have suggested) and use the garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  He also likes his rare so I cook at 425 for 25 minutes, then kick it down to 350 for 15 minutes- and rest for 15 min....rare in the center and the ends medium rare like I like!  Perfect tri tip everytime!  I wouldn't go the entire hour in the oven unless you like your meat VERY done.  Excellent recipe... 10 stars if I could!

I am making this for the third time in two months it is so tasty!  I use my mortar and pestle to grind up the herbs.  I also prefer hickory chips when I smoke the meet after searing it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I first had a Tri Tip when I was visiting my sister in San Diego and have been searching for something close to make at home; I was delighted to find this recipe because it is fantastic!  The rub is great, but I did make 2 small adjustments.  I cut the salt in half (it was a little too salty the first time around) and I added 1/4 tsp of Oregano.  I've made it several times for large groups and it is always a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great! I used garlic powder, instead of garlic salt, but kept everything else the same. It was so tender and very tasty. Next time, I may cut back on the salt even more since we try to watch our sodium intake. Can't wait until we get another tri-tip.

YES.  Just - yes.  You will not be sorry!  Something about this combination of flavors really harmonizes well together. I tweaked it a bit; 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 TBSP garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 3/4 tsp celery seed, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 3/4 tsp crushed dried rosemary, 1/2 tsp sage, 1/2 tsp pepper.  Rubbed it in and baked... my kids were drooling on my shoes the whole time, and my ketchup/bbq sauce loving husband even gave it a Huge thumbs up!  Most of the kids had thirds and I caught my 11 yr old son licking the plate when he was supposed to be washing the dishes, lol.  I'm making a big shaker and going to try it on a lot more than tri-tip!

Always amazing. I do use garlic powder and celery seed instead of salt and instead of a TBS of salt I just sprinkle salt on both sides.

I live in Florida and could not find a tri-tip roast anywhere.  I asked my local butcher, who was happy to cut one for me.  He then asked if I was a California girl, because everyone he has ever had ask for a tri-tip roast was from California.  Anyway, I made the roast tonight, in the oven as several reviewers mentioned. I cut the salt in half as others recommended and rubbed the meat first with just enough Worcestershire sauce to moisten it prior to applying the rub.  I let it marinate overnight.  My roast was just over 2 pounds and I cooked it in my convection oven at 425 for 25 minutes, then turned it down to 325 for another 23 minutes.  I then let it stand, covered, for 15 minutes.  I initially missed the comment about not covering it in the oven, so it was covered for the first 25 minutes, then uncovered for the last 23.  It was done to medium-well, which is more done than I would have preferred, but still incredibly moist, juicy, tender and flavorful!!  This is an excellent recipe and a rub that would work on almost any kind of meat.  I look forward to trying it on the grill, as described, and also to trying it again in the oven, uncovered for the first part of cooking at the higher temperature.  The meat was nicely browned as I did it, but a nice crisp seared skin would have been even better.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was great and so did my picky husband. I didn't change a thing. On my 2nd tri-tip I did start making 'seasoning packets' in snack size resealable bags. It was just easier to measure 5 (or more) packets worth at once for future tri-tips. It is that good that one could eat it once a week.

This has become one of my tried-and-true standbys when having people over for a casual dinner on beautiful Southern California cool evenings.  It's always a hit (often served with parmesan baked red potatoes), and easy to prepare and cook.  For best results it's important to use a true charcoal barbecue and sear over medium-high to high heat to get the outer portion of the meat carmelized and sear in juices.  Then reduce oxygen to the barbecue to reduce fire heat for 10-15 minutes, then move coals to outside and place bread tin in middle of coal pit and fill with water.  Then finish cooking on medium to medium-low heat, and let the meat thermometer tell you when it's done to medium rare 135 degrees.

Delicious! I used a little less salt than the 1 TBSP and followed the cooking directions. Meat needed 30 min. at indirect to get to our desired taste. Will make again.

This is an excellent rub for tri tip!  I did sub thyme for rosemary-didn't have on hand-and only refrigerated for 3 hours but it was very tasty & tender.  I especially like the method given for grilling.  I've never used indirect grilling and it is the perfect method for tri tip.

This is one of my favorite rubs to use on tri-tip roast.  Once I've evenly rubbed the mixture all over the roast, I wrap it with Saran then put it in a ziplock bag in the fridge for several hours or overnight.  I prefer tri-tip done in the oven, starting it out at 450 degrees for 25 minutes as others have suggested, then dropping it to 350 until it reaches an internal temperature of 140.  I let it rest loosely covered with foil for 15 minutes before slicing thin with an electric carving knife.  I get raves every time I serve it at a dinner party.

Used this rub on a tri-tip roast (3 lbs) recently subbing garlic powder instead of garlic salt and celery seed instead of celery salt and used a teas. of sea salt instead of a tablespoon. That sounded like a lot of salt. Rubbed the meat and let it sit in fridge for 5 hours.  It was delicious.  We were rubbing the last few slices in the plate drippings and gobbling them up as we cleaned the kitchen, couldn't get enough of that flavor.  I plan to keep a jar of this all mixed up and ready to go to sprinkle on burgers before grilling, steaks, etc.  It's a keeper.

Used this rub on a tri tip today and absolutely loved it! Did add a cup of brown sugar and added garlic powder. Only thing I didn't have is dill. Marinade for 24 hours and turned out amazing. The brown sugar gave it that nice hint of sweet flavor and caramelized the fat while searing. I did not cook it the way this says but did use the rub and will def use again.

tri tip is just another name for a sirloin tip roast. I hate in when they make up new names for cuts of meat, just like flat iron steak, has always been know as a blade steak.

I am giving your recipe a 4-star rating only because my family loved it! I, on the other hand, was not a fan of the flavor which makes me reluctant to give a personal review, but I will give you my honest opinion since I was the one cooking the Tri-Tip. :) This was my first time cooking a Tri- Tip so I liked the idea of your rub recipe for easy insurance of tenderness & flavorful meat. However, personally, I thought the end result was too salty and the rosemary I think gave it the flavor I was not fond of. I love rosemary on my chicken recipes, but I guess not on my beef meats. Sorry to make that sound like a negative for your recipe so I hope others do not take it that way. My husband RAVED about the Tri-Tip so your rub was a big hit with him!! I will use your rub recipe in the future and maybe try it on my chicken recipe :)   Thanks so much.

I cut the salt down to 1tsp, used garlic powder (not salt), took other reviewers advice to first dampen meat with Worcester sauce. Our tri tip cut was just over 2 lbs and cooked on the grill for just 30 minutes came out perfectly medium rare. This is an excellent, delicious recipe! Will definitely make again.

I thought it was way too salty and that the rub mixture was too strong.  Husband and kid liked it though.  Will make again but just cut back the spices and salt.

Ok the first time around....Awesome everytime afterwards it's all I can say. I discovered that Dill is not a flavor I care for and even my husband who loved it the first time, agrees that it is better without it..  The only complaint is that no matter the size, there is hardly any leftovers...grrrr!!

I'm gonna have to go ahead and give this one 5 stars...all of the seasonings mix together to create a ridiculously flavorful outside that permeates all the way through. Even after only a few short hours of putting the rub on, it is fantastic.  One crucial thing I did add was 3 T of brown sugar...I MEAN!   Perfection...I have always been a med rare girl at MOST but cooking this one to at least medium makes the flavor out of this world!   One other note - we were working with 2 lb. piece and after 18 minutes at 450 it was Med Rare...the first time we cooked as said minus about 10 minutes or so and it was med/wed well...so....

This was very good.  I didn't have sage so I threw in poultry seasoning which contains sage.  I used kosher salt as well. Took the tip from previous reviews I read and made it into fajitas the next night with black bean garlic sauce, Yummmm!

Best tri-tip ever!  Placed in crock pot for 6 hours.  Added a sliced onion and a can of tomato sauce.  This rub is the best and can be used on any meat.

This is A+. I like it so much I keep a mason jar full of the rub in my kitchen. I have even used it on Salmon.   For my next trick I want to try marinating it in a vacuum sealed container. I have heard that allows the meat to absorb more of the spices.

I followed suggestions from other reviewers and added 2 tbsp brown sugar and let it "marinate" overnight (for almost 24 hours)after rubbing it on the beef.  To be honest, I wouldn't recommend letting it rest that long, the herb flavor was good, but EXTREMELY strong.  I still liked it but would have preferred it if the flavor were not so strong, but my husband wasn't wild about the strength of the flavor, and my 4 year old (who usually loves grilled beef) wouldn't eat it. My parents did like the flavor of the cold leftovers the next day.  If I tried this again, I'd only leave it on for 4-6 hours.

i chose this recipe for the oregon rub only.. i cut this in half and used it on 1 lb of ground chicken that i added an egg and some bread crumbs to.. i shaped them to fit in the hotdog buns that we had, hence the picture.. i subbed kosher salt for table salt.. garlic powder for garlic salt.. and celery seed for the celery salt.. i think i'd reduce the dill by half next time.. i'd love to try this on pork chops (i don't care much for red meat).. ty for the recipe

I made this last night but instead of putting it on the grill, I put it in a slow cooker after searing it on all sides. This tasted so good. I put my carrots then potatoes on top with a cup of beef broth in the bottom. It was moist, just great. My kids came over and they too just loved it. I used the broth mixed with the meats own mixed in and made a gravy using corn starch mixed with water and was very good way to serve a gluten free gravy. I did only use celery salt and the other such as garlic salt I replaced with garlic powder with only a teaspoon of sea salt. I was great and not too salty. I can't have a lot of salt now days.

Amazing!  I usually don't use rubs but boy was I glad we tried this.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, this rub stayed on the tri-tip for 48 hours!  It had outstanding flavor.  It was a little salty (and I love salt) but it could be because the rub stayed on too long.  So, I'll try again with it overnight.  If it's still a bit salty, I'll just use garlic powder or fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Give this recipe a try - it's worth it!

Delicious. The whole family was back for more. I was out of celery salt, so I didn't use it, but it was OK without. I also only had a 1.5 lb tri-tip so I divided the spices called for in half. This was so good. My butcher rarely offers this cut, so I'm going to start asking him for it more!

BEST tri-tip we have ever had. I omitted the dill (only because we did not have any) and roasted in the oven for 45 minutes. This will be a staple at our house.

I have made this recipe 3 times, always prepping the night before.  The first time was a bit too salty, as other posters have mentioned. I modified the 2nd time and it was better. This time, I took another poster's advice and added some sugar, only a tablespoon, and it was perfect.  Highly recommend this rub.

Made it tonight with a roast that weighed 1.65 lb., and adjusted the rub accordingly (for 7 servings).  We cut the salt (as recommended) by 50% and used kosher salt, and substituted 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic for the garlic salt and garlic powder.  My husband seared it on a gas grill for about ten minutes on each side, then turned off one of the burners and turned the other down (to about 390 degrees) and cooked it indirectly for 30 minutes, letting it rest (covered) on the counter, for about ten minutes.  It was medium rare, just perfect, juicy, tender and delicious! If it had any more saltiness to it, it would have been too salty.  By reducing the salt by half and substituting garlic for garlic salt, it was just right!!!

This rub is fantastic! I used kosher salt instead of table salt.  The meat took less time to cook than stated in the recipe.  Even though it was a bit med-well. it was very moist and flavorful.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

This is unqualified the BEST piece of beef I have EVER eaten!!! I used fresh crushed garlic, and seared it on the stove then oven-roasted it, but otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone loved it! It was a bit salty, but no one added any seasoning to it when served, so... perfection! Loved it!!

HERBS IN DRY WHITE WINE, WATER SMOKER
Dissolved the herbs in 1/2 cup of sauvignon blanc, and marinated four hours in the refrigerator. Then cooked the tri-tip at 200 degrees in a water-pan electric smoker. Delicious!

The rub mixture is nice except too much garlic for my tastes. I reduced from the 1-1/2 to 1 teaspoon. Did the rub, placed in plastic sealed bag and in the fridge for two days. Grilled at high heat 450 deg F for 5 min per side, flipped a couple times. Then into a low temp smoker at 200-225 F. My major criticism is the recipe does not indicated when the meat is done. I use a meat thermometer and call it done enough at 145-150 F. After resting this takes the meat to medium doneness. 140-145 is a little rarer. You've GOT TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE TEMP; tri tip is a little lean and over cooking is unfortunately easy to do and very unforgiving.  I do like this rub; with a smoker the flavors enhance each other wonderfully. This will not produce a deep smoke flavor, but in this case, mild smoke seems to be perfect. It's not overbearing, but it's still there.

My hubby made this, and honestly I didn't care about the meat anymore.  He used the rub on both Tri-Tip and also on some ribs that we had.  Wonderful flavor from the grill.  No need for napkins, your fingers will be licked clean!

This is amazing. We tried this a couple weeks ago and had some of our family over, we all got hooked. Even my little one loved it. I just stocked up the freezer with more tri-tip and we're having it again tonight. So delicious.

WAY TO SALTY.... I marinated my piece of tri-tip for 6 hours. OMG I was in shock how salty this ended up. I had to cut the edges of my meat of just to salvage of of my meat. Very disappointed. Im willing to try this again, just add a little salt and maybe garlic powder instead of garlic salt??

Can I just say, oh my goodness. This was delicious, mouth watering actually. What a great and easy recipe! Instead of using water, we dipped in soy sauce, we packed on the spices, one of the tri-tips we stuffed with garlic cloves. We only had to cook for about 1hr, about 30min on each side, browned it first for about 10min on all sides. Then moved both pieces to the center of the grill and turned the outside burners to low. The meat kept moist, even the next day. We will use this recipe again for sure!!!!

Thank you so much for this recipe. I just hosted dinner for seven folks and it was a huge hit! I edited the salt as other suggested. Here's what we edited and thought it was great:  1/2 tablespoon salt, garlic powder instead of salt, no celery salt, we didn't have any rosemary, so I just left that out and it was still great, and added 1 tablespoon brown sugar  Thanks so much!

I thought this had WAY too much salt and I come from a family who has been known to carry salt shakers in their purses.  I would at least cut the salt in half.

Excellent roast, I followed suggestions to use garlic powder, upped the paprika, and cooked it low and slow at about 275 to 300 with Hickory chips.  Yum. We felt that it should marinate longer, we only let it set overnight approx 23 hours, longer would be better.

I cook tri-tip all the time.  I've used lots of different marinades and rubs from all over.  I made this for a 4th of July bbq yesterday and it was a HUGE hit.  My husband is still talking about it today!   In fact, it's 11 am right now and i can see him in the kitchen eating the few leftovers straight out of the fridge!  Thanks :)

Amazing!!! I rubbed the roast with the seasoning in the morning, left it in the fridge all day, and then broiled it for 17 minutes for dinner. The roast was so flavorful, juicy and perfectly pink in the middle.

Delicious, came out great.  Followed advice of another reader, and rubbed a little worcestershire on both sides before rubbing on spices.  Turned out great!  Followed cooking directions to the tee and came out really tender.

This rub would have been 5 stars but it had way too much salt. I almost couldn't eat it because the salt was so strong.  The cooking method worked great and the meat was very tender. I will make this again but only use half the salt next time.

Amazing. I tripled it and made three on the BBQ. Awesome. Very salty, so you may not want to use all of the rub... but I personally thought it was perfect. In a party of 7 with one vegetarian 2 3/4 of the tri-tip was gone by the end of the night (6 lbs!)

This was great.  The rub is delicious. I smoked it about 3 1/2 hours.  I'm going to cut that down to 3 hours next time.  Meat came out medium, but was still very moist.

This recipe is like none other.  Flavors are absolutely perfect.  It came out moist, only thing I did was add a pat of homemade garlic butter to my slices (family did the same) and boy oh boy my husband raved for 3 nights.  Making again this weekend and will probably become a staple in our home.

Excellent flavor. After letting sit in frig for a few hours, I seared all sides in a cast iron skillet with olive oil and moved pan to oven to finish, covering with foil for about an hour at 300. Removed when thermometer read 140ish and let rest until I prepared my veggies. WILL make again but probably pull out of oven about 15 minutes earlier to achieve a more medium rare. Otherwise PERFECT AND MOIST.

We used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and just celery seed instead of celery salt.  In the morning, we rubbed the seasoning on steaks and let them set, wrapped in plastic wrap, all day. It was wonderfully flavorful! My husband absolutely loves it. He is currently on a strict diet, and has 6oz of flank steak each evening. No marinades or butter, etc. So, we use this. So glad we found it! I'll be making a large batch to keep using until his trainer switches his menu...and will certainly use it any time we have steak in the future!

Followed others recommendation about the salt.  Used 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder instead of what the recipe called for.  Also put Worcestershire on it prior to adding  on the rub. Turned out perfect.  Really liked the rub.

I've made this several times exactly as the recipe calls for with one exception. It is a bit to salty to my liking so I backed off on the amount of Garlic salt I use. 
Tri-tip is one of the go-to grilling favorites here in California so I have experienced it may ways and this recipe is my all time favorite. Marinating it at least eight hours will give it a tenderness not expected in a Tri-tip and the flavor is superb.

Followed the advice of people who suggested less salty alternatives.  Tasted the greatest rub todate. But still a tad salty and will reduce salt to .5TB.

Perfect combination for the rub, except for a little heavy on the salt.  And I love salt, so when I saw the reviews saying it was too salty I blew it off and made as directed.  Next time I will use half the amount of salt.  Otherwise, it was devoured by 3 adults and 6 children (with varying levels of food picky-ness).

I wish I could have grilled this, but circumstances prevented it.  I went with the oven method of 25 minutes at 450, lower heat to 325 until the roast hits 140 degrees (about 12 minutes for a 2.5 pound roast), then remove from oven and wrap in foil for 15 minutes before cutting and serving.

This rub was amazing! The only things I did different was I used celery seed instead of celery salt and I had no dill so I didn't use it. I rubbed it all in about 2 hours before cooking. It was so good everyone loved it. I will be using it again!

I used regular salt (1 tsp) and garlic powder cause I didn't have garlic salt. Put it on a 1.86lb roast. Marinated in the fridge about 12 hours. Cast iron skillet high heat one side for 4 minutes, flip, then a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. It was delicious!!

My daughter made this rub last night and brought over a  tri tip. Trimmed a little of the fat off the backside then put the rub on. We got a bit of a late start and only left the tri tip rest in the refrigerator for about a half an hour. I smoked the tri tip at 220 degree for two hours over Mesquite wood. It was outstanding. Know it will be even better after the rub sits on the meat longer. Will use this rub on tri tip from now on. Thanks CHIEFWMS.

Simply and AMAZING. The left overs were great on salads. I found this recipe when searching for Whole 30 compliant dinners. This is going into my rotation for sure. Everyone in the family loved it. I used fresh rosemary and sage because it was all I had.

This was really tasty and my youngest daughter especially enjoyed it and asked me to make it again. It worked really well as written and the herb rub is really nice, so I made extra to use on other steaks and burgers. The only draw-back with this recipe is that my vent is not strong enough so I had to open all the windows to get enough ventilation because I set the smoke alarm off and I got teased by the family, but it's still a very good recipe!

It's really good!  I put just a little bit of Worcestershire sauce on the outside.  Then for the rub, I need to cut a bit down on the salt.  Instead of garlic salt, I use just garlic powder. Instead of celery salt, I use celery seed.  Also, instead of dill, I use oregano. Added a few tbsp. of brown sugar.  I like to put the rub on the day before Fantastic cooked on charcoal with indirect heat over a pie pan of hot water.  I think I like the leftover tritip sandwiches even better.  Don't carve it all.  Save a chunk of it in the fridge and chill for the next day, then it is easier to cut in very thin slices.

So good. The sage brings all of the flavors together so nicely, cooked it just past medium rare. I didn't use all of the rub the first time around thinking it might be too salty that way, so I patted it down with about half of it and set it in the fridge for a little over two hours. I mixed all of the herbs again except for the salt, took it out and rubbed it again and left it alone while smoker went off. Really herby, in a great way. Great recipe. Think it became a staple.

This came out very well. Wet with Worcestershire and dry rubbed and let it sit overnight beforehand. I made it in the oven and baked it for 1.5 hours at 350 until it reached about 138 degrees, then took it out and let it rest for 15 minutes. My family loved it.

My family and I LOVED this recipe!  I didn't have celery salt but used celery seed instead.  Everyone loved it so much that they asked me to make it again the next night!

I made this exactly as written and it was amazing. It was a little salty but I love salty so maybe next time I will cut back just a pinch on that. But this rub is fantastic, it made the best Tri-Tip I've ever made.

AWESOME!!!
Followed comments to half the salt and add 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also "wet" meat with worcestshire sauce instead of water.
Turned out amazing!

Delicious herb rub. This has to be the best rub I have ever tasted. I made the tri-tip this time around(my husband usually marinades it) and he was impressed with the flavor. He even asked me to keep it in my recipe box. Great blend of herbs and I did not find it to be too salty at all.

I have never bought a tri-tip roast before and found it to be very tough. The marinade was pretty good so I gave it 2 stars, but the cut of beef was too tough for grilling and we couldn't eat it.  Maybe better in a very slow oven or crock pot?

This is the best tri-tip rub and has become a go-to in our home. I make large batches and keep ready made in a jar with my spices. The only change we make is to cut down the salt (I use less than half what the recipe calls for). Other than that, it is sheer perfection.

We mix up a bunch of the rub and save the extra in an air tight container in the pantry.  Makes prep really quick.  We also rub a light coat of Worchestershire sauce on the try-tip before adding the rub.

A "can't go wrong" receipe.  I punched some holes and added slivers of garlic, but that is my preference for roast meats.  Very Good.

Absolutely phenomenal!!!!! I am from the Central Coast of Caligornia where we all take our BBQ very seriously, and Santa Maria Style is always the way to go. I also love trying new things in the kitchen, so I was anxious to try this after reading all of the good reviews, and another local persons positive feedback. I followed thisgurlloves2cook's exact suggestion and it turned out perfect. I cut the salt in half and of course used Kosher. I only had time to let it rest for about 7 hours, and I can't wait to do it again and marinate it overnight. it was tender,juicy, and sooooo flavorful!!! Tri tip has forever changed. :)

Great Rub!  I didn't add the celery salt or the dill weed only because I don't care for those two things.  Everything else was great though.  Make sure you do this the day before.  I've done it just an hour before, but it's best when you do it the day before.  Try this, you won't be sorry.  Thanks so much Chef!

I was amazed at the amount of flavor that this rub produced, the tri-tip was delicious!  My family loved it.  It is rather hard to find tri-tip in our grocery stores, but from now on when I do, I will definitely make this recipe.

Wow this was delicious!  I followed the directions perfectly and was surprised at how tasty it is!  I was also surprised at how tender this typically tough piece of meat was.  We took the leftovers and chopped them up, added some bbq sauce and made sandwiches the next day.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

After reading reviews, I wasn't too sure about it. We usually use a package marinade or the classic, a Santa Maria rub. We liked the flavor of this rub. Very tasty and perfect for tri-tip.  I would not add the spice+salt combinations, I would just add the spice and keep the salt the same. I used Kosher salt. Also used celery seed.  I wrapped the meat in saran wrap and kept in fridge for just 5 hours. My first time grilling and it came out nice and tasty(hubby's the grill master and I got an approval)

This Tri Tip is AAA excellent. I cut back on the salt and added brown sugar and marinated 7 hours. Followed the cooking instructions and browned all sides the first 15 minutes then moved meat to low side of grill. Slow cooked covered for 1 hour then let rest. The best I have ever tasted. Special Note Be sure to cut against the grain. Check out on-line videos how to cut a tri tip if you have questions. Cutting the tri tip correctly is VERY important. Thanks for a great one.

This is the first time I have ever cooked tri-tip.  It came out very tasty.  I doubled the dry rub.  I rubbed the first batch on when I browned the tri-tip and then I added the second batch when I put it in the oven.  I also added some water with beef bouillion.  I am so not a cook, because it came out way too salty.  I will stick to one batch of dry rub next time.  Thanks!

Very tasty rub, though a bit too salty.  We didn't have celery salt and garlic salt, so we omitted them and just added a tad bit more salt - next time would suggest using the exact amount of salt (or a little less) and none of the other types of salt.  I followed happywifey's suggestion and added some brown sugar and baked the roast instead of grilling it.  Overall, the roast turned out great, but I had to cook it much longer than her suggested 450 degrees for 25 mins and 350 degrees for 30 mins - I had to tack on an extra 15-20 mins to get the roast to medium (internal temperature of 160 degrees, though undercook 5-10 degrees less as the roast cooks a bit more as it is resting).  Delicious recipe and easy to make.

This rub is wonderful!! It is so flavorful and easy!  We have tried it on tri tip and steaks (tri tip was better) and we have served it to family and now they ask for it specifically!! This one is definitely a keeper!!

Really really good!  I halved the salt and used garlic powder and celery seed as suggested instead. I know the salt is a tenderizer but I'm pregnant and watching sodium.  Eventually I'll try it will all the salt.  Next time I will use celery salt because the celery was prominant using seeds - it tasted great but thats probably not how its supposed to taste.  My tri-tip steaks from Costco were awesome!  Saved half the rub and added some brown sugar as suggested by another and used it on a tenderloin filet later and I couldn't really tell the difference but my husband said he liked it better...so I'll add brown sugar from now on.  Thanks for a great alternative to marinades!

We grill Tri-Tip often, but this is the first time I used a dry rub. In the past we have always used a marinade, Soyvay, which has a Teriyaki flavor. I was skeptical, but because of the great reviews I tried it. The reviews were right and this was absolutely delicious! Remember not to poke at the meat with a fork or all the juices will run out and you have to let it rest or you will have a tough Tri-Tip. Enjoy! We did.

The BEST! Even my 2 1/2 year-old ate this! A perfect blend of seasoning and flavor. We reduced the salt slightly and the seared on a Cuisenart grill and put in the oven on 375 degrees for 35 minutes, 10 minutes to rest...perfect and med-well! Will keep a container of this rub on hand for other cuts as well as tri-tip...maybe try it on a pork loin!

Well, I certianly do not see what all the hype is about. This was just ok in my book. I listened to all the reviewers regarding the salt issue and reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Personally I think it would have been better the way the recipe was written. I marinated it for about 24 hours. And I didn't think the flavor was all that spectacular. I am used to using FRESH herbs as opposed to dried. Maybe that's the reason we thought it lacked flavor. With all the comments about how flavorful this was I really had high hopes. It was just ok and I will keep looking for a better rub.

I would say this was excellent except there was way too much salt!  I don't have garlic salt, just garlic powder, and it is still too salty.  Bf agreed and we both think that this recipe is good enough to make again, without the salt at all.  I think the celery salt will work for the salt, so I'd leave out the tablespoon of regular salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for father's day recently for my boyfriend's family. We were heading up to the cottage so I had seasoned it the day before and it marinated for a good 30 hours. IT WAS DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I were talking about how it tasted restaurant-quality. The only modification I made was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Will DEFINITELY make again!

This recipe made me a rock star... thank you!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I rubbed down the meat, wrapped it in plastic wrap, placed it in a Ziplock (for a little extra protection), and let it chill in the fridge for 24 hours.  I removed the tri-tip from the fridge about an hour before grilling.  Then, I pounded the meat down with my fist (while it was still wrapped in plastic) before searing/cooking it as directed.  I am AMAZED at how the rub flavored the meat all the way through.  It was truly fantastic.  Thanks again!

I was a bit nervous when I first mixed up the spices, as I didn't really care for the smell. But after cooking on the grill, this came out much better than I thought. A bit salty for my taste, so I might follow the suggestions of others and add some brown sugar when making again. Overall, a nice change from slapping BBQ sauce on.

The best tri-tip I have ever cooked! I cooked it in the oven instead of the grill at 350 for an hour and a half.  This made it a little more done than I would have liked(medium), but it was still very flavorful and juicy. Two hours in the frige before cooking is a must.  This allows the flavors of the rub to penetrate the meat.  I cooked mine fat side up in a roasting pan.  Thanks again, I will be using this recipe again for sure!

Good, but a bit on the herby side for my family at least. I did substitute herbs for the herb salts, which may have helped with this. A bit of fine tuning may be in order to get the new ratios correct.  Still, overall the flavor was very good.

I'm a transplant from California so I love the original Pappy's seasoning for Tri-Tip but I thought it's time to try something different. It's hard to get a cut of Tri-Tip in the northeast so I put this rub on steak and broiled it for 10 minutes. AMAZING!! Can't wait to try it on Tri-Tip on the grill! Thank you so much!

This is an amazing rub!  I BBQ'd for the first time (usually my husbands job) and this came out so well that my husband is afraid that I am now going to take over the grill!  Even my kids who are not big beef fans loved it.

This was delicious and our guests raved.  The only criticism we had is that it did not serve as many as the recipe stated.  There were 8 of us and there was just enough for us to eat sparingly. (Fortunately, we also grilled fish so everyone had enough to eat.)

The meat came out nice and the rub was good.  I will continue to look for a better dry rub.
