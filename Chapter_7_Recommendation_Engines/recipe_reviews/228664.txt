I followed this recipe exactly BUT I added 1 more cup of water and 1 more cup of chicken broth as I had more ham than it called for and I'm glad I did.  WOW did this turn out good and so easy too.  Soaked my beans the night before, threw it all in the slowcooker in the morning and came home to a wonderful pot of soup!  YUM! Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I added more liquid and a can of diced tomatoes.  It was even better on the second day.  A great meal with some hearty bread or a grilled cheese sandwich.

Very good and makes a nice big batch!  Like some of the other reviewers, I added more broth, water and 1 15oz can of diced tomatoes.  Ended up using a 1lb bag of 15 bean mix, so eliminated the extra can of beans and threw away the ham packet that came with it.  Looked at another recipe and added 1 tablespoon of dried parsley, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tablespoon of worsh. and 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard.  Came out fabulous with great flavor!  Don't forget the ham bone.  Sometimes the Honey Baked Ham store sells ham bones…mmmm, mmmm, good!

Great soup and great way to use up the Christmas ham. I Also wanted to spice it up so added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, and one can of regular diced tomatoes with all the juice. I added in more spices and garlic and some chopped celery. The house smelled so good, makes a ton of soup.

Excellent recipe!  minor changes - added a can of diced tomatoes and several dashes of Franks hot sauce - just added some flavor, not hot.  I used 4 cups broth, 2 cups water.  The store was out of 15 bean soup mix so I used the dried great northern white beans (16 oz bag) in place of it and omitted the can of northern white beans, of course.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and will use again whenever I have a ham bone.  Blending two cups of soup and adding back in one hour prior to serving helped to slightly thicken up and enhanced flavor.  thanks for the recipe!

Amazing soup recipe!  Definitely add a can of diced tomatoes (I used the ones with garlic and onion)...Added a can of chick peas and white kidney beans instead of the 15 bean soup mix because I didn't realize they needed to soak overnight...Will be making this soup again anytime I have leftover ham...Thank you!

We didn't have a ham bone or add the northern beans. Our package of beans came with ham flavoring, which we added for additional flavor. I would probably add more liquid and a smaller pack of beans next time. Even after soaking overnight (and adding more water to the soaking after a couple hours because it was all soaked up!) it was more beans and less soup for us.  Definitely the flavor was delicious and we have been eating leftovers of it for a few days. I recommend serving with cornbread or a sourdough loaf.

This recipe was great.  Using the 15 bean soup was a great idea. I soaked a 1 pound bag for 8 hours. Put in 1 1/2 qt. of water and a ham bone with some ham left on it. Cooked 10 hours in crock pot. So easy. Soup was a little runny so I put it in a stock pot on medium for 20 minutes. Thickened right up. No wrong way to make this. Navy beans work well too.

Absolutely wonderful soup to utilize that savory ham-bone.  I followed the recipe pretty much.  I did add all 4-cups of chicken broth instead of 2 cups of broth and 2 cups of water.  After it cooked for 8-hours, I felt I needed another 1/2 cup of water to keep it soupy.  Otherwise, kids and family couldn't get enough!  Thank you.

I love finding a creative recipe that compliments what you've already tried and just makes it that much better! This recipe did just that.  Don't be afraid of the "unusual" ingredients for traditional bean soup - that's what makes this great! The tomatoes, Worcestershire and mustard are a BRILLIANT addition for great layered flavors.  I used leftovers from glazed spiral ham which added  the hints of brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg.  Since I can't resist tweaking a recipe, I cut the chicken broth to 4 cups and an equal amount of vegetable broth, added a dash of hickory liquid smoke, substituted Paprika and white pepper for the chilli powder. Pureeing 2 cups of veggies and meat and adding a little corn starch during final 1/2 hour made a smooth but hearty soup. As other reviewers noted, all low sodium products and no added salt is best!

I had ham broth from another ham bone so I used that in place of chicken broth other then that I followed the recipe as written. I served it for Sunday dinner and barely had enough left over for lunch today. Our guest loved loved loved it to the tune of second and third helpings.

Delicious.   Just made a pot of this soup.  Great way to use up my Christmas ham.  I didn't have the Northern Beans on hand and I added celery.  Everything else done according to recipe.  Yum!

This was very, very good.  It's the first time I made any kind of ham & bean soup.  I doubled the recipe so I used a 16 oz. bag of 16 bean soup.  I didn't have enough room in my crock pot so I had to omit the can of northern beans.  I didn't add salt because the ham is salty enough.  My husband and I loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Really great!  I listened to previous reviewers and added a can of diced tomatoes and an extra cup of water.  I skipped the ham bone because I didn't have one.  Delicious served with honey cornbread and tossed salad.

I used nearly a 1-pound bag of 15-bean soup mix. Mine came with a packet of cajun seasoning so I added that. I soaked the beans overnight in a covered bowl on the counter. Used a whole container of chicken broth plus a few cups of water because I like a lot of broth. Added a 28-ounce can of diced, seasoned tomatoes with all the juice. I had a big 10-pound ham shank with the bone, so I carved most of the meat off of it and cooked the soup with the bone, which made it really greasy so next time I think I'll skip that part. I added two onions, 4 cloves of garlic, 3 large carrots, 6 stalks of celery, along with a thawed and drained bag of frozen mixed vegetables. I added 3 bay leaves, several dashes of hot sauce, and ground cayenne pepper. Omitted the salt and can of great northern beans. Towards what I thought was the end I removed the ham bone and added all of the ham I had chopped up, because there wasn't enough room for it with all the stuff I put in there. I tried the beans after cooking for 10 hours on low and they still weren't tender, so I turned the slow cooker to high and cooked for about another 4-5 hours. The soup turned out DELICIOUS with the modifications I made to suit our tastes. The whole family loved it! I was going to take a picture of how pretty it looked but it was gone before I had the chance! 

I plan on making this again but next time I'll skip cooking it with the ham bone, or maybe I'll just let it cool and skim the greese off the top, because the flavor

We really enjoyed this soup!  Only thing I added to it was some of the juice saved from the ham when it was baked and more water to thin out the soup.

As bean dishes go, it was good.  However, we followed the recipe as written, i.e., we soaked the beans about 12 hours but then did not cook them before putting them in the slow cooker.  Even after 9 hours in the cooker some of the beans were still a little too crunchy for our taste.  If I do this in the future I'll cook them on the stove before putting them in the crock.

I absolutely love it. I added jalapeño juice, bacon in addition to the ham and used less salt. It is so delicious! I had gastric sleeve surgery so I can't eat much at all, only a few bites fills me up and keeps me full for hours.

Outstanding!  I used a regular sized bag of 15-bean soup.  As suggested by others, I used 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth and 2 cups water.  I added a 14 oz can diced tomatoes during the last hour or so of cooking.  I used the leftover ham bone and ham from Easter.  I smooshed some of the beans on the side of the crock to make it a littler thicker.  The house has smelled so good all day.  Serving with some southern sweet cornbread.  Will make this year after year.  Thank you for sharing.

Super Yummy!  My Husband couldn't stop raving about it and he is picky.  I did follow another review and added a tbs of chili, 1 tbs of parsley, 1 tbs of Worcester sauce, 2 tbs Dijon Mustard and a can of diced tomatoes.  Also had some celery in the fridge I threw in.  Will make this again for sure!

I usually cook a version very similar to this.  I normally use more of the 15 bean than this recipe called for.  I prefer using the northern beans.  Great soup and very very tasty.

This is the best Ham and Bean soup recipe I've found to date. I followed the recipe exactly with a little added chicken and beef bullion, and it turned out delicious, hearty, and full of good-for-you fiber. Even my 3-year-old liked it. A great use for that leftover Easter ham and bone on a cold rainy spring day.

Great way to use up leftover ham, especially if it happens to be cold! I hadn't saved the ham bone so skipped that and I didn't add the can of Northern beans - there were plenty of beans without it. Also I just simmered on the stovetop for an hour instead of using the slow cooker. Next time I will cut the amount of pepper in half. But overall this is a great soup! update 4/24: made it again with a can of tomatoes (left out 1 cup of water), sweet potato instead of carrots, and half the pepper. Delicious!

Big hit in my house. Made a couple of changes. Used 3 cups of unsalted chicken broth instead of 2 cups. Only added 1 cup of water. Because of the lack of sodium in the broth, I increase the salt to a full teaspoon. I also changed the diced ham to chopped, cooked bacon. The sodium content on ham is a dietary concern in our house. I use un-cured bacon that is very low in sodium and sugar. Serve this soup with some cornbread and you have a wonderful addition to the "need something for a cold winter's night" cookbook.

I thought the flavor was ok but I changed it to add more depth -- added a small can of tomato sauce, more minced garlic, cumin, and juice of 3/4 lemon.

I have made this recipe  exactly and it turned out delicious!! The family loved it - even my toddler. I've also made it with variations, like omitting the Northern beans, but adding smoked sausage, tomatoes and corn. I always serve with corn bread. One of our favorite ways to use our Christmas ham bone.

This is a really good Ham and bean soup.  Although, like a few others here I do like my version to have a bit more spice to it.   I added chili powder, can of chopped stewed tomatoes, worcestershire sauce, parsley, chopped celery, and bay leaves.    It's a New Year's day tradition in our house!

One of the best bean soup recipe I have made!  I think the trick is also in the ham.  I have used a local grocer's special prepared ham hock.  Fabulous! And simple to put together.

I've not really been a fan of bean soup, but I made this for my husband, and it was great!  I added a can of tomatoes as had been suggested by others, and left out the hot sauce as I'm not a fan.  He adds to his bean soup anyways :)

So glad I found this recipe!
I used a 20oz. bag of bean mix instead of adding the northern bean. I added a little extra stock and water. cooked overnight on low in crockpot. Everyone loved it!

This was a delicious and easy soup! Lick the bowl clean good! I changed it a bit per the other reviews. I did 3 cups water and 3 cups broth. I added the can of of diced tomatoes too. I used an entire bag of soup beans with the seasoning and didn't add the great northern beans. This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

We made it with leftover ham from Christmas.  Had all the ingredients in the frig/pantry...even the Northern Beans.  Addedmore ham, garlic, water and broth than called for in the recipe.  A teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning and Cavendars topped it off.  Served  with fresh baked bread from Teeters.  Great for a cold winter's day.  Made it first thing in the AM...didn't have to worry about dinner the rest of the day!

I didn't have 15 bean package so I used navy beans, pinto beans, and split peas. I also added extra carrots, a can of diced tomatoes, and herb de Provence. It was very good. I usually make split peas soup with leftover ham so this was a nice change. I will definitely make this again. I'll definitely try it with a package of 15 beans.

I made this recipe and made a few changes based upon all of the review feedback I saw when doing my quick research to make this taste as good as possible:  I did not use the Ham Seasoning packet that came with the beans, I added 4 stalks of celery cut up, 1 tablespoon of dried parsley, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tablespoon of worsh. and 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard.  I thought it was really good!  Thanks for the recipe.

Used ham bone from Christmas dinner and it turned out great. Easy to follow. Even better leftovers!

We made it for supper. It was super easy. The slow cooker is our friend. We did reduce the garlic a bit to better match our seasoning preferences.

Love this recipe, just a bit of tweaks like an extra carrot, onions and some celery. Made it twice and loved it.

Only made one minor change and used leftover holiday ham instead of the ham bone. Was so good on a cold October night!

Great recipe for using leftover ham from Easter (or Christmas)! I made it with some of the changes that included more liquid and can of tomatoes which the recipe does need because it comes out very thick.  My twist that made it more tasty to me was to remove the chunks of ham and then put the soup in a food processor.  I liked that texture better and then just added the ham.  Like split pea soup but with a different flavor...loved it!!!!

I usually send the ham bone home with my dad after a family meal. After making this I will be keeping the ham bone From now on. Sorry Dad!  SO good!! I used 4 cups stock and 2 cups water.

Delicious soup!  My family loved it.  As per other suggestions, I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes and doubled the chicken broth plus more water.  Still very thick.  My crock pot isn't big enough so I simmered slowly on the stove for 5 hours.  Yum!

I loved the soup! I did add a couple of extra things; I added tomatoes, cilantro, thyme and if you want to bit of a kick, a hot pepper. I actually only put it on the slow cooker for about five hours because I did the beans using the quick method instead of leaving them to soak overnight. It was very tasty and will definitely make it again!

This recipe had a very rich ham flavor. I had a large ham bone left over from Easter so I tried this recipe. But I did not notice that my bag of 15 bean soup mix was 20 oz. not the 8 oz. called for.  Thankfully I caught my mistake before adding the can of great northern beans. Still turned out as a very good full flavored ham and bean soup. This recipe tastes even better as a leftover. The beans absorbed even more of the ham flavor and became more tender. Just about the best tasting beans I have ever eaten.

This is a really good recipe and similar to one I have made for years.  My recipe adds one can of diced tomatoes and one of diced chilies for a little zip.  Definitely use the ham bone as this recipe calls for.  I did and it was the best batch of this soup I ever made!

I read your recipe, looked to see what I already had and went to the store to get the items I did not have before I started. I did not have the Bone but did get some quality ham to dice up and got a large smoked Ham Hock, had the butcher cut into five pieces for me and cooked it in the place of the Ham Bone. The only thing I added to the recipe was a half teaspoon of Red Pepper Flakes. This adds a little bit of bite but not enough to turn off the kids. It was really good and I was able to save a couple of individual servings which I froze in plastic containers with lids for a future lunch. I read where others added Diced tomatoes to the soup and it sounds like a good idea. I would also like to add a can of whole kernel corn and try that. I'm gonna make some corn tortilla croutons by slicing them a quarter inch wide and two inches long, frying them in veg oil and draining and lightly salting them for next time also. I like them in all kinds of soups and chilli.

I made this following the instructions exactly plus 2 additions:  I added leftover roasted cabbage and a can of seasoned diced tomatoes. It turned out fantastic!  I will definitely make this again!!
