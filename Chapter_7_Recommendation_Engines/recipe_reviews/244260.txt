My family loves these bars! I made a double batch to fit in a 9x13 pan. The only substitution that I made was that I used one white cake mix and one yellow cake mix because that is what I had on hand. These bars look so festive with the sprinkles. It would be fun to use red, white and blue sprinkles for a summer barbecue, red and green for Christmas, etc... I will warn you that it is hard to stop eating these!

I just used a box of funfetti cake mix instead and it worked perfectly. delicious and addicting as everyone else had stated. they are quite how and crumbly so not a great bar for holding without a plate.

Delicious. My only problem is the batter is so dry.  The top part ended up crumbly.  We still loved it but I am going to have to read the reviews and see if someone else has an answer for me.

So tasty! I loved how buttery and rich they were. I overcooked mine very slightly, but it still got rave reviews!

Simple to make and just on the borderline of being too sweet.  Very good, though, and these barely made it to the second day before being eaten.

I used black and orange sprinkles for Fall time. These bars r gooey and sweet. Very good. I think I will try with different cake mixes. I donâ€™t know that the sprinkles r even necessary really?
The second time I just put some sprinkles in the middle gooey part.   They taste the best right from the oven, when still warm and gooey!

I used funfetti cake mix instead of yellow, and then dispensed with adding actually confetti candies. Tasted like a birthday party!

These were tasty... took them to a church potluck. Everyone seemed to like them.  They are a bit too sweet for me, so when I make them again.. I might try a lower sugar chip in this..and a cake mix with less sugar.
