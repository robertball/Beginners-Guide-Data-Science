I have made this twice in the last two weeks for different events.  Every one loved it!  It is a very unusual combination, and it presents beautifully! I just microwaved the Jerk sauce and I coated both shrimp and  the pineapple with the sauce.  I also used shredded pepper jack chees as a reviewer below suggested.  My father in law said it was the best appetizer he has ever had, and he has dined in some of the top restaurants in the country!

The many reviews that added black beans sounded pretty good and I wanted it to be filling, because it was our dinner. Since my shrimp was raw and large, I cut it in more bite sized pieces, put the pineapple pieces in the cooking sauce first until they were tender, mixed in the drained black beans and then added in my shrimp until it was just starting to turn pink. I then drained the liquid off very well in a strainer, and spread that over the veggie mixture. A trick I've learned to keep your nachos from being soggy is to put most the shredded cheese on top of the chips, then top with the veggies since they need the heat to cook, and putting a thick layer of cheese on top of all your veggies traps the moisture and chips soak it up. Throw more cheese on the top the last minute or so of cooking until it all melts. Your chips stay crunchy. My son said this was the best nachos he's ever had, and he is 25 and eats out a lot with friends. Both my husband and I thought is was a fun summer meal, and it was very filling. All this covered a 15X10 pan, and half of a second pan...so it makes a lot.

Fantastic nachos.  Made as directed even though I was apprehensive of all the bell peppers and onions.  Perfect amount of ingredients and wonderful blend of flavors!  Thanks for sharing.  I served it with Planter's Punch...equal amounts of Myers rum, oj and pineapple juice and splash of grenadine.  YUM!

These were the most amazing food ever!  We regularly eat nachos as a dinner meal and are going to add this recipe to our regularly made dishes.

Since there are just two of us...this recipe was too much.  So, we will cut the recipe in half next time.

We cook the peppers, onion, pineapple and shrimp all together in the jerk sauce.  This really improves the flavor.

In the midst of watching the Pats game and eating these nachos.  Everyone loves them, a great twist on a game-time favorite.  Used the smallest shrimp I could find (salad shrimp) and they are just the right size.  Don't know if we'll have room for the half-time pizza!

Wonderful recipe.  I used jerk chicken instead of shrimp.  It was a success and even the kids loved it!

"Filling" SUPER tasty but think it would be soooo much better in taco shells, maybe even a quesadilla-  the tortilla chips just didn't do it justice!

I've made this twice, the first time with Lawrey's brand Caribbean Jerk marinade and the shrimp as called for.  We weren't thrilled with the result, so recently I tried it with shredded rotisserie chicken (about 2 cups),  drenching it in K.C. Masterpiece's Caribbean Jerk Marinade, and we loved it!   Family members were all trying to secure the leftovers the next day.  Can't wait to make it again!

WOW, these are beyond delicious! I also added black beans, as some other reviewers suggested and cut the shrimp into pieces for more even distribution and easier eating. Hubby said he could picture us on a beach sippin' on margaritas and eating these nachos, lol. I did serve these w/ 'Beer Margaritas' from this site. A HUGE hit and a definite repeat~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are wonderful! I wouldn't make it with avacodo because they get old quick and it doesn't make for good leftovers.

I think it was pretty good, but I love salsa with my nachos. Think next time I'm going to add a twist and try it with mango salsa! A must try recipe overall!

Today was my first time cooking this and my family absolutely loved it... I didn't use shrimp because not everyone in my family like shrimp so I used chicken. But the blends of the different flavors are great!

instead of Prawns, some smoked salmon or hotsmoked salmon - not a bacon lover, choose a veggie substitute - lovely!

These are not your average nachos but they tasted fantastic.  I omitted the peppers but otherwise followed the recipe.  All the different flavors in this dish blended together well to make this a delicious dish.

My step-son picked this recipe and I am so glad he did. It was FANTASTIC. I admit, I was afraid of all the different flavors but, everything blended so well. I was the last one left eating! The only change I made was pepper jack cheese instead of Monterey jack.

I made changes, so don’t read if you’re narrow minded. I used cheddar cheese, a jerk rub, chicken instead of shrimp, and canned pineapple. It was so good!!! My 8 year old didn’t like it but she doesn’t normally like nachos either.

My 13 year old daughter and I made this recipe for dinner tonight and our family loved it. The flavors combined beautifully and it was such a refreshing change from the traditional nachos we eat here. We added black beans and we sautéed the vegetables and pineapple slightly before layering over the tortilla chips. We also used Pepper Jack cheese as well as a Mexican blend I had on hand. Rave reviews from husband and kids! We'll definitely be making this again.

I was not a real fan of this recipe, but I think it was the Caribbean jerk marinade on the shrimp that I didn't like.  I picked the shrimp out and liked the rest of it a little better.  The rest of the family said it was delicious, shrimp and all.

I've made this several times now.  I made my own Caribbean "rub", added some olive oil, and used that for the shrimp.  Now it's delicious and I shall raise my star rating.

Everyone I have made this for has LOVED it! The only modification I make is adding black beans (and slightly increasing the quantity of the other toppings), then serving w/Tabasco and sour cream. Thank you, Smarz325, for this wonderful recipe!

Tried these nachos tonight and we really liked them. As another reviewer suggested, I added black beans and used leftover bbq jerk chicken breast.  It was yummy! Would be great for a party or BBQ!  We had margaritas with them and really enjoyed the combination of flavors!
