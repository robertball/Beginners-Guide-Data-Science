The creamy layer on top is great. My favorite flavor to use is strawberry. I bought a 6 ounce box instead of buying two 3 ounce boxes because it's cheaper, and the 6 ounce box has essentially the same recipe on the side, just different measurements. The box's recipe calls for 6 ounces of jello, like this recipe, but for 3 cups of water. I decided to use this recipe's measurements of jello and water, but used an 8 ounce tub of cool whip since that's all I had. It still turned out great. It really doesn't matter how much cool whip you put in, it all depends on how big of a top mousse layer you want. More cool whip means a thicker mousse layer and less of a jello layer. It tastes great all the same.

YUMMMMMMM! This recipe is amazing, I used blueberry jello, and it tastes like a piece of heaven! The cool whip goes really good with the jello. That's why I added 3/4 cup more of cool whip. Thanks.

Love 'em! I am not a big fan of Jell-o but my grandma asked me to bring a Jell-o side dish for a family get together and I thought of these. They worked out great. I used lime and everyone loved them and they were so easy. I tried orange after that and those were yummy too.

My daughter and I made the bites last night and we used strawberry kiwi. WOW They are amazing! I remember having them as a kid but they taste even better now! I would recommend using a bit more cool whip if you want more mousse and thats the best part!

Grandma made this dessert when I was growing up, only she made it in parfait glasses. My favorites are either strawberry or orange. Grandma sometimes would make it with fruit juice or 7-UP and add chopped fruit. This is extremely comforting for most anyone, especially when you've got a flu/cold/sore throat.

This was really fun to make with the kids -pretty & quick with little effort.  They loved how the layers magically appeared when they peaked in the fridge!  That being said, I don't think we'll make it again.  We love jello & cool whip together and I guess that's what I was expecting the mousse layer to taste like.  I kind of felt like I wasted a tub of CW.  Don't get me wrong, we won't have any problem polishing this one off but I prefer the flavor of jello with a dollop of whipped cream instead.

Very easy and these turn out nice.  Bf LOVED them--he ate 1/4 of the pan before we even got dinner ready--and dinner took 5 minutes!  I guess that means these are a success.  I used peach jello bc I didn't have two packages of strawberry.  This would obviously work with any type of jello flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!
