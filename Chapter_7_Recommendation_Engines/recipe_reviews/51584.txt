This is a great recipe; it is fast and tastes wonderful. Everyone who tries it wants the recipe. The last time I made it I added artichoke hearts.

Delicious! I used one fresh tomatoe instead of the sun-dried and three-cheese tortellini. Served as the main and only dish and it made a perfect light supper!

I'm sorry, but I just didn't care for this recipe.  I admit, I screwed up a little in adding 9 oz of pasta instead of a pound, and that may have had a lot to do with it.  But it was dry, slightly grainy, and while the flavor was good, it looked very unappealing.

Quick to prepare. My husband liked this better than I did. I think it would help to added sliced black olives and toasted pine nuts. I will make this again but try it with those additions and serve it cold. I served it warm with garlic toast.

I loved this recipe. It's extremely quick to prepare, and tastes great. I'd recommend substituting a few diced plum tomatoes for the sun-dried tomatoes.

I absolutely love this recipe! I often cook for a large number of people and this is a great easy dish that can be served hot or cold and travels well for picnics. I usually add spicey italian sausage, mushrooms and olives and some fresh pine nuts for added flavor.

This is a great quick and easy make ahead dish.  Recipe is easily doubled to feed a large party.  I omit the fresh basil and double the sun dried tomatoes.  A keeper in my house and usually one of the first dishes to go at a potluck!
