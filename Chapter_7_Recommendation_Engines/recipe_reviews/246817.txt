By far the best pumpkin loaf recipe I've made on the site so far. Not overly sweet, moist and just the right density for a perfect loaf. Rather than use the individual spices (I was missing a few), I used 4+ teaspoons of Pumpkin Spice and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon because my husband is a cinnamon fiend. Will definitely be adding this one to my regular rotation.

I have to confess, I've never had Starbucks® Pumpkin Bread, but this one is very good. Similar to the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread recipe on this site, but a LOT less sugar. I did make two adjustments to this recipe. I cut the cloves down to 1/2 tsp, as I thought 1 tsp would have been too much, as cloves can be pretty powerful. I also needed to add a bit more flour, as the batter was way too loose. I made two loaves (7" x 3" pans) and baked for exactly 47 minutes. A nice, moist, and flavorful pumpkin bread. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this bread but I did make 2 modifications.  I increased pumpkin to 1 cup and decreased oil to 1/2 cup.  It came out much less greasy and more pumpkin-ey.  I also added a pecan/Brown sugar/ oat /butter streusal on the top to add crunch. Yummy!

With the exception of adding roasted pumpkin seeds on top, I made this exactly as written. 
Good: moist, rises well, tender crumb
Not so great: too much clove. 
If I made this again, I'd adjust the spices to 1 tsp nutmeg, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, .5 tsp clove

Really good and tastes a lot like the Sbx Pumpkin Loaf. I made a few modifications. Put in cocnut oil instead of vegetable oil only put in half the brown sugar and white sugar. It was fantastic.

I thougt this was good.  I used pumpkin spice and the only addition I made was to sprinkle 1/2 cup of toasted pumpkin seeds over the top.

I tried two other pumpkin bread recipes and they just didn't do it for me. Yet, apparently, third time IS the charm because this one's IT! I wouldn't say it's exactly SB flavored, but it's definitely extremely close. Im only removing one star because I would do slightly less sugar (I have the opposite of a sweet tooth) and maybe throw in some pumpkin spice to make it even more flavorful. Either way, it's an EXCELLENT recipe.

This came out delicious and was surprisingly simple to make! I, however, added crushed walnuts on top, before cooking, for a delightful crunch.

My dairy free son is obsessed with Starbucks Pumpkin Loaf. When I can't get him to eat anything it's our go to treat. I made this for him today and he has already eaten 2 slices.

I made this today.  Perfect for a rainy day dessert.  I should have checked it at 1 hour because it got slightly dark and a tad dry.  I will make it again because it was delicious otherwise.

This was delicious!  Prior to baking, I topped mine with pepitas to make a crunchy top.  Came together quick, made house smell great while baked, and taste great.  Make it!

I am allergic to eggs so 
I used Egg Replacers. It probably didn't bake up quite as high and light as it would have with eggs but it tasted delicious and as I am also allergic to milk products this recipe works for me.

This is delicious and very moist. My kids love it and yes, it tastes like the bread at Starbucks. I prefer less of the clove taste though and will reduce it to about 1/2 in the future.

I’ve been using this recipe for a couple of years now. Excellent density, moistness and not too sweet. Great topped with whipped cream cheese, or not.

This is GREAT bread! I used 1 cup fresh pumpkin puree and 1/2 cup oil. I had pumpkin puree to use up and it's liquidity so that's all I changed. I found the clove to be just right. I changed nothing else. I was worried at how runny the batter was, but it came out perfect at 60 minutes.

This is the best recipe on this site.So good and so true to Starbucks version. I used 1tbsp pumpkin pie spice. I also used brown sugar instead of White. I think it’s better with the brown sugar. Fabulously moist and tender. Will definitely be making again.

I used sweet potato instead of pumpkin.  The bread came out perfect.  It was definitely a hit at my family brunch.  I was a bit worried about the spices since I was using sweet potatoes but it worked.  Excellent!

Followed recipe as it appears.  I did use a baking spice from Savory Spice, which has a pungent collection of spices.  The pumpkin bread was great.  My husband is not a great fan of pumpkin, but loved this bread.  Will make it often.

This was just like the Starbucks pumpkin bread!  Very easy to make and delicious!  I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar (same amount) and cut ground cloves amount in half, increased cinnamon to heaping tsp.  REALLY REALLY AMAZING!

This was a good recipe.  I like that it's low sugar and I liked the swirl of cinnamon on top.  I added nuts to the top too.  My kids would prefer more sugar of course.  My husband wanted more spices.  But it's a good compromise.  I made it with GF flours, brown rice, chickpea, almond meal, and some Bob's.  Will make it again. I would like it to be a little more dense next time.  I agree with those that thought it needed more pumpkin, maybe some oil or butter?

I used allspice instead of cloves because there was none near me but it came out very moist and tasty. Definitely will make again but with nuts on top for an added texture.

Delicious and addictive!  I substituted 3 1/2 t. pumpkin spice plus an extra 1/2 t. cinnamon because I'm not crazy about a strong clove flavor.  I also used 3/4 C white sugar and 1/4 C brown sugar to cut down on the sugar.  You won't miss the extra sugar a bit especially if you make the basic cream cheese frosting on the all-recipes website.   Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe !  Moist and about as perfect a pumpkin bread as you can find.  It does taste similar to Everything Bunt  Cakes pumpkin cake if you've tasted that.

I loved this.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 C applesauce in place of half of the oil, and 1 C of wheat flour.  I also added pecans.
Really delicious and the smell!!!!  So good.

I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 veg. oil instead of all veg. oil.  I also cut the cloves to 1/2 tsp and upped the cinnamon to 1-1/2 tsp.  Cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1/4 cup coconut sugar instead of brown sugar.  Threw a few walnuts on top.  Very good!  Will make again.

I make this frequently for my grandchildren. Today, I substituted whole wheat pastry flour, cut the white sugar by a third, and added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of smooth almond butter, just to give it a nutritional boost. I also doubled the amounts for the spices. The results are very good.

This was really good pumpkin bread. Amazing, not really, but will be my go to recipe until I either find a better one or tweak this one. I only made one substitution: coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I felt like the cloves overpowered a bit and not enough pumpkin flavor came out. Very moist and perfectly sweetened though!

This was really good.  I used fresh (cooked and pureed) pumpkin, and I probably added a little extra, which wasn't a problem.  I doubled the recipe and made three smaller loaves (still not very small), so I cut a few minutes from the baking time.   My husband, kids, mom, brother, sister, etc., all loved it.  Thanks!

Well even though it was good bread it tastes nothing like Starbucks pumpkin bread. Also wish it would've tasted more pumpkin. But came out very moist.

Made this today hoping to have some for tomorrow morning. I didn't even get to take a picture before everyone wanted a slice 
!  I didn't pit any icing on it and it didn't need it.  It was still warm enough that all it neede was a little butter.  I'll be making this again while people are home off work.  Hope I get more than one slice!

I followed the recipe as it was given.  Turned out great.  Very flavourful.  I served it with whipped cream cheese on top.  Gots lots of compliments.
