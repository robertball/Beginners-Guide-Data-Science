Gonna be generous and go with 5 stars. Ok, here we go: first of all, the taste is great. I have some comments, why does the recipe state to divide the onions and garlic? I can't see what you do with them later that would require dividing them. Also, I like to have diced tomatoes in my sauce (personal preference) so I wish that this was different. I think that a large onion should be specified. I think the red pepper flakes were maybe a bit much for this sauce. Overall though, great recipe and yes, very versatile! Easily customizable to suit the individual; spices can be tweaked. This recipe has been out there since 2002 and only 2 reviews..... why??? Great recipe that needs to get more exposure.

I have used this a number of times over the years.  Depending upon what I use it for, I tweak it.  For spaghetti, I add 1/2 lb of Italian sausage and 1 cup red wine, nixing the red pepper flakes.  For sloppy joes, I make it a bit soupier, not cooking it down so much.  For chili, I add back in the pepper flakes and add toasted chilis and chili powder.  It uses are as limitless as your imagination.

I cut the recipe in half and add less red pepper flakes and it makes the BEST spaghetti sauce I've ever had. Plus I still have enough to freeze for another meal. Yummy!

Love this sauce it is so easy!  I used it for spaghetti, but I cut down on the tomato sauce to 1  29 oz. can.  I like my sauces more thick.  The amount was perfect for one pound of pasta.  I did use 1 tablespoon of crused red pepper flakes and will cut that amount back to 1 tsp next time.

Very good. Loved this sauce. I added a pinch of sugar to combat the acid and used ground sweet Italian sausage but other then that I changed nothing. Yummy good.

Great as written and the perfect base to add favorite ingredients.  I was pleased with the flavor also with red wine, one small celery rib , and sweet italian sausage.  I did divide the onion and garlic. Used half while browning the meat and half
added to simmering sauce.

Love this recipe.  I also eliminate or reduce the red pepper flakes, as it is hot if you make it the way the recipe is written.  Also, I find that after cooking for an hour or two, if you remove the lid and let the sauce simmer uncovered, that it greatly reduces the wateriness of the sauce and makes it even better.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is incredible!  I used all the ingredients as written.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I am throwing out my favorite recipe that I have used for 30 years and replacing it with this one.  You can't get any better than this!

Oh, I did put it in a crockpot on low for 8 hours instead of on the stove.
