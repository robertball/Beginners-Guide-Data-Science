I love recipes like this because, as long as you make a trip to the store for the loaf of bread, literally any combination of savories from the 'fridge can go inside at a moment's notice. 

My few tips are: to address the bottom getting too crispy, a quick brush with milk before wrapping and baking solves that. 

And in general, when I do stuffed breads using a pre-baked bread "shell", there's a lot of magic to be found in the presentation and surprise of cutting into it to reveal its hidden treasures. So Instead of slicing off the top, turn the loaf over and cut out the BOTTOM, a half inch or so in from the edge, the same way you'd cut the stem-top off a jack-o-lantern. Bake inverted, and then serve right side up. The form of the original loaf will remain intact, and its secret entry will be hidden beneath.

Delicious.  I used a sourdough loaf and added some chopped green onions.  Made this night before and baked in the morning at 350 deg for 45 minutes.

Great idea and fantastic taste! I brought this for a breakfast potluck at work and got multiple requests for the recipe. I put a few together the night before and put them in the oven for 45-60 min this morning and worked great. For two I used 18 eggs, added some bacon and used Salsa instead of just tomatoes. Next time I think it would be great to mix some mushrooms and spinach with the eggs. Endless ideas!!

The first time I made this as written. The next time I made it, I used refrigerated pizza dough, making a breakfast stromboli which we prefer to the French bread loaf.

I made 2 of these for my husbands breakfast day at work, and everyone raved.  They were both completely gone - and there were only 10 people.  I used the italian round loaves for beautification and made one vegetarian.  Made them the night before, wrapped in foil, and then just heated at 375 for 45 minutes the morning of.  Voila - easy to transport.  Thanks for the great recipe, Amy.

I always take a treat to my dog's groomers when he goes.  This was what I took last week.  They loved it!!  My changes:  added cheese inbetween most layers...including starting on bottom (so that  the bread would be cheesey too) and on top (for the same reason).  I  brushed the bread cavity & top (before filling) and outside part of bread with olive oil then put garlic powder/salt on them for more tasty bread.  Eliminated the red pepper and layered with roasted hatch chilies cut in half lengthwise and seeded (for a mild spicey bite).   As others suggested, I put it together the night before, wrapped in alum. foil, took out of the refrig. about an hour before I put in oven so it would not overcook and make bread hard.  They really liked this a lot!  Unfortunately I didn't taste it so will have make one for us next time.

Absolutely simple and delicious. I made the breakfast loaf the night before, wrapped it in foil and put it in the fridge. The next morning I took the breakfast loaf out of the fridge and placed it on the counter for about 20 minutes, then baked according to recipe directions. I brought it to work with me and my co-workers loved it. Thanks for submitting this recipe, I will definitely be making it often.

This was such a wonderful breakfast!  I used a sourdough bread round which perfectly complimented the cheese and ham.  Instead of using the tomatoes and peppers in the loaf, I served the loaf alongside sliced tomatoes.  I also added some chives to the scrambled eggs.  Delicious and easy!

This is a great recipe if you're tired of making casseroles!  I tried this with a group of women in my Bible study this morning.  I wish I would've brought the recipe with me.  I was asked for it several times.  Because this is so versatile, you could fill it with any ingredients you have on hand or like.  I made the recipe as written, using sourdough.  I loved crunchiness of the bread, the flavor of the red peppers and the sharpness from the cheddar and mont. jack cheeses.  I will definitely be making this again over the holidays.

5 teenagers really enjoyed it. Used salsa instead of tomatoes because that's what I had. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and cut the bottom, not the top, and brushed it with milk b4 baking 2 keep bread from getting hard; it worked! And nothing leaked out during baking. Allow 45-60 minutes to allow cheese to melt; 30 minutes is not enough. Prepared the night b4 and just threw it in the ovenn in the morning.

Made this today for brunch.  Only had a tiny bit of ham, so subbed in crispy bacon.  Didn't have peppers or tomatoes, so threw in some salsa.

Very, very good!  I'd take previous reviewers suggestion of brushing some milk on the loaf before wrapping it, and it came out very nicely.  Just a touch of crispyness.  Only issue was the aluminum foil stuck to the bread a bit because of the milk.  It came off with a bit of coaxing, but next time I'll lightly spray the foil with non-stick spray.

I rate it 5 stars, but always put what my husband rates it whig was 4 stars. I made this for breakfast for another couple and us and wetting LOVED it, I will definitely make it again. I had a really hard time finding a large enough loaf, I literally searched 5 grocery stores and bakeries in Seattle before finding one that had one that was .8 lbs loaf so I just made a slightly smaller one and used sourdough instead since that is all they had. I topped the tomatoes with a thin layer of hot salsa and it was Devine. Great recipe!

I made this tonight as a sort of breakfast for dinner meal. I added sauteed mushrooms and scallions to the eggs and also a layer of fresh spinach. I brushed the crust with milk and turned the whole thing upside down for the last 15 minutes of baking to avoid overbaking the bottom crust. I still found it difficult to eat. You can't pick a slice up like a sandwich and using a knife and fork doesn't work so well as the crust is tough for cutting. I wish I could figure out how to make the crust tender. I will be very happy if someone can come up with a tender crust version because it is so pretty and good tasting. I would love to serve it to guests.

So easy to make and so delicious. The fact that you can make it the night before is a huge plus. The possibilites are endless when it comes to stuffing the bread. I made on exactly as printed and the other one I made was a vegetarian version with layers of eggs, tomatos, peppers, cheese and spinach....amazing. My guests raved!!

Easy and Delicious!  You can't go wrong with this - makes a great breakfast/brunch item and if you leave out the scrambled eggs, you can dress it up to be a yummy lunch or dinner - just add what you like.  I added salsa instead of tomatoes and the ladies loved it!  Also used sourdough bread with is my favorite.  The only thing I would caution is to not let it overcook, otherwise the bottom will get too hard to cut easily.  You have to try this one!

5 stars for the idea and filling. I read reviews and did a few alterations but kept the basic recipe. I used a round loaf of peasant bread from price chopper (too hard-wont use again) I mixed olive oil and garlic powder and brushed the inside bowl and the outer surface with it before filling and wrapping in foil. I used a jar of marinated roasted red peppers in place of regular red peppers for taste and softness. The result was delicious had it not been for the toughness of the bread. I need a much softer bread for the next time. Co workers loved the flavor. I did as one reviewer said after making the night before and leaving in fridge I took out and let sit at room temp for 30 min. then baked in foil for 30 min. It was still only slightly warm-not hot enough for my taste-this could have been because of the tough shell of the bread I used. All in all a great idea and very tasty.

This was delicious but messy. When I tried to cut it all the layers started falling out. One problem might have been that the bread got so hard and the force required to cut it caused the issues. I will definitely make this again and try brushing it with milk as a few reviews suggested. Also I will try to spread aroung the cheese to act like a binder.

This was really excellent. Made it without the veggies for my suspicious family, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Added more cheese and made more layers, and it was so tasty we finished the left overs for lunch.

I took another raters suggestion and took refrigerated pizza dough and made a stromboli out of it.  I put sauteed red and green peppers, bacon, ham, american and gruyere cheeses, and egg whites on the pizza dough, rolled it like a jelly roll, then baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  Came out AMAZING!

LOVED! I was a little sad when first preparing this only because of all the bread going to waste when hollowing out my loaf (didn't know what to do with it). But it was worth it! I followed the recipe exactly and it was beautiful to look at as well as delicious. I would make this for company but make two because my husband and I ate this whole thing in one sitting!! I put garlic spread at the bottom of the loaf before adding everything else. I ate mine with salsa and he ate his with hot sauce (we like our food with some kick).

I made this for the first time for my 2 sons & 3 grandkids & they LOVED it!  I didn't have any tomatoes, so I didn't use them but it was still fantastic!  I was worried it might be somewhat dry but far from it.  The only thing I would change is the serving size; it should serve only 4 instead of 6!!!  LOL

Very fun!  The red bell pepper was surprisingly good in this recipe.  I ended up only needing about 4 eggs for my size loaf.

This recipe was great! I made it for a New's Day Brunch and everyone loved it. Only changes I made were instead of fresh red pepper, I used roasted and sour dough bread instead of french.

This was fun and a hit at weekly family breakfast.  Easy to adapt to own tastes.  Added onions, garlic, and spinach to eggs and with the sweet peppers and tomatoes, felt almost healthy.  Cooked it in a pumpernickel loaf.  Yummy!

This is a wonderful idea. I just sent it with my boyfriend to work and his co-workers said it was "bomb." Which I'm assuming means good because they all said they wouldn't mind eating it every morning for the rest of their lives! I left out the bell pepper and tomato because of personal preference, used sourdough and added chives to the eggs as Sheila T. suggested, and threw in some mushrooms. I then topped it with olives. This was wonderful. Thank you so much, Amy McCuan for a creative recipe :)

Loved this concept!  Everyone enjoyed it but the bottom of the bread was hard as a rock once it came out of the oven.  Perhpas it was over cooked when I purchased it.

After reading the recipe, I was extremely excited.  After tasting the food, I was disappointed.  The concept is great and we may try a variation later, but won't be making this again.

Delicious and easy!  All I could find was brioche which got a little too hard when baked.  But, my husband and I still loved it.

Easy, taste great and looks pretty.  I had to use precooked ham that I cubed and it was great.  I did add chives to the eggs and mushrooms, and a little red onion to the third layer.  Gave the dish more flavors.  Next time I will buy the smaller bread loafs and divide the layers for single serving breakfast loafs.

I was looking for something quick and satisfying for lunch, since my hubby was working hard on the yard. It was perfect- he loved it! This is a great idea, I'd probably add some onions next time, but it was so tasty as is- thanks for the recipe!

This was nice. The sour dough breads I got were a little on the small side so I made several different types to suit the tastes of my family. We had a ham/turkey, chicken/pesto, salsa/chorizo. Everybody loved it! The bread gets very crunchy on the outside.

This was ok- maybe I did something wrong. I used a french bread loaf and it was way too 'bready' for us. Not enough egg/ham/cheese taste.  And the bread was too hard and crunchy.  My family didn't really enjoy it. If I try again, I would probably use bread dough with ingredients rolled up inside, then bake that way.

This recipe gets 10 stars from me!  Followed it with one change, used roasted red pepper instead of sliced red bell pepper, patted them with paper towels to diminish the moisture....Everybody loved it and I have sent this recipe to London, Texas and anywhere else I could!!  Thank you for such a great recipe....you make me look good!

Winner! 2,361 people were right to save this. Easy, looks great (just like in the pic) and tastes great. I used salsa as some suggested which was great, although I guess just tomatoes would be as good (just giving a fresher cleaner flavor early in the morning).   The family wanted to sleep in, so I only cooked 20 mins, then warmed it for 10 mins still in the foil an hour later when they were ready.  Warm crusty bread with a great warm filling. Super!  ps I only used cheddar but it appears Red Leicester would I think be a suitable substitute for the Montrery Jack which we do not get here in Australia (having the same colour-adding effect).

I absolutely LOVED this but my husband felt like the bread was just a little too much.  I am going to try wrapping it in refridgerated dough of some variety next time because the flavor was fantastic, and I am not ready to give up on making the hubby love it yet.  I added chives to the eggs and used a little more cheddar than jack for extra flavor.

This is the exact recipe from a vegetarian cookbook that I use. The only exception is that in the cookbook, the recipe includes the sauteed mushrooms & olives. That is how I have always made it, excluding the red peppers & only using jack cheese if I have it on hand, because the recipe is very good just using the cheddar. I use only half the round of sourdough since it is only my husband and myself.

My boyfriend liked this recipe more than I did. I didn't use the veggies because he doesn't like tomatoes or peppers. I did add layers of bacon and sausage in their place. I used to ten inch long french bread los instead of the one indicated in the recipe. I did this mainly beacuse I couldn't find one in the store and I also wanted it to be more sandwich like. It was more effort than I would have liked to put in for the result I got...but my honey liked it and thats what was important.
