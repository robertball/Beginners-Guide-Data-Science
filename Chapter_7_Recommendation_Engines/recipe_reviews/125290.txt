I thought this sounded great but somehow it just did not turn out. The custard went very curdly and still would not set up, it was watery. The flavor wasn't bad but the texture was awful. I followed the recipe exactly, but maybe somehow I did something wrong?? Maybe I will see if I can find another custard recipe and layer it with cream and blueberries.

My custard currdled with whole eggs even on a very low temp. I tried this twice . maybe if just egg yolks were used it would work
