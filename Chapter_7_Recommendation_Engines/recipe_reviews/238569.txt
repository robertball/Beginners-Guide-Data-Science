Delicious! Next time I will plan better. I made the mistake of walking away from the stove to get some parsley (an okay cilantro substitution in my book) from the garden; when I returned the soup had gone from taste-tested perfection to a curdled well non-soup. Rats what a fool! Rather than waste this batch I stirred in some couscous and enjoyed it as more of a casserole. Looking forward to tasting the real thing again next time. It was simple quick and scrumptious enough to deserve a 5-star rating on the basis of one bite!
