We just finished eating this recipe!  It turned out very well here.  We did make a few substitutions simply due to a lack of the exact ingredigents.  We used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Plus, at the last minute, we noticed that we were out of onions!  So, we just nixed that ingredient.  Everything turned out great nevertheless.  We did spice things up with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I can see how this might be a bit bland otherwise.  But, overall, a nice piece of comfort food perfect for a chilly autumn night!

This was ok.  The potatoes never did reaily get fully cooked. The taste was kinda bland.  I had to add more seasoning.  My husband and 16 month old daughter liked it.  Next time "IF" I make it I will cook the potatoes before adding them.

I made this recipe last night but I tweaked it a little bit. Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey and put garlic powder, chili powder, kosher salt to season it. I didn't put onion in it either. This was AMAZING! My husband had 4 bowls of it! Thank you for sharing this recipe, it was easy to make and I have leftovers to feed an army. LOL

It was pretty good.  I did add salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little celery salt.  I also added beef broth, because I thought it needed some moisture.  I think it took a long time to prepare.  It made way too much for my family of 5.  It made a lot of dirty dishes too!

Very bland... I originally thought "potatoes and noodles?" and I was right ... way too heavy/starchy.  Had to keep adding water too.  Has potential, but needs some major adjustments.

This recipe is easy and a great way to use up leftovers. (I had half a can of tomato paste, some plain cooked pasta, and three potatoes in my fridge I wanted to use up.) You can adjust it however you want and it still turns out pretty good. I agree with the other reviewers that it needs some additional flavor. I suggest adding fresh ground pepper, garlic salt and just a bit of chili powder.

First of all, I read the other reviews and thought it best to adjust the recipe.  I did not add the potatoes or onion, and instead of the tomato sauce, I used Ragu.  I thought this recipe tasted especially cheesy.  I even used a whole 26oz. jar of Ragu and it still tasted really cheesy.  I do not think I will be using this recipe again without changing it.  It needs a little something, although, I can't exactly put my finger on what that would be.

The recipe as it is will come out very bland.  I fixed this for my family and we all were dissapointed with how bland the whole creation turned out to be. We ended up doctoring it up by first adding more tomato sauce.  We then added tobasco sauce and some tomatoes.  This helped it out a lot, but to reitterate the point of the low rating.  For me this recipe as is created a very bland dish and from reading other reviews this seems to be the general consensus.

If I were to make this again, I would nix the potatoes. They took too long to cook. I doubled the amount of sauce (I used jar pasta sauce), and I also put a bit of soy sauce in with the ground beef for a little more zip.

This is very similar to my recipe but I thought I would try something a bit different. I use Ragu (onion and garlic flavored) spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste and add green and/or red peppers for crunch factor. I also do not put potatoes in mine. My husband and I add tobasco sauce to most everything on our plates without adding that I could see how this would be pretty bland. My kids didn't say anything about it but I had lots of leftovers which is rare. I think I will have to stick with my recipe.

Woah!  What a combination of ingredients.  Sounded good, but turned out to be a big glob.  Don't think I'll add this one to the rotation.

Much better than I anticipated. I used frozen hash brown potato cubes and they were done in no time. I think next time I will add more liquid it was a little thick for me. DH and daughter liked it and want it in the rotation.

It needed some more zip and next time I think I'll leave out the potatoes. It just didn't seem to fit. I used store brand processed cheese and that may have been the fatal mistake, I'll try the real stuff next time.
