This was excellent. Sinfully simple and easy. It reminds me of a hot(even though it wasn't) mexican hot chocolate that had cinnamon in it, that I had at a friends house years ago. I actually loved the cinnamon in this. Very delish!!

I liked this recipe.  It's a good chocolate fix.  The cinnamon tastes great. Thanks for the twist on pudding.
