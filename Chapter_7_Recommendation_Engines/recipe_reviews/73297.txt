This is the best marinade I've found for roasted or grilled veggies. The suggested veggies can easily be substituted with your own favorites. We tried it with zucchini, yellow squash, bell pepper, crimini mushrooms and tomato. Yum!

What a terrific and versatile recipe!  I've  been making an effort to eat better, so I searched for a new way to make veggies.  They were awesome!  I used eggplant, zucchini, green bell pepper, vidalia onion and sliced roma tomatoes.  I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used one tsp. each of dried oregano, basil and parsley.  I only had two small cloves of garlic, so I used them with some garlic powder.  I also added a little white sugar.  I used a grill basket and it worked out perfectly. I served the veggies with marinated grilled salmon and they complemented eachother perfectly! The only problem was that the eggplant looked very unappetizing...it turned a brown-black color, but it tasted fine.  It must be something I did.  I will definately make this again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe name should be changed to "Veggie Mixed Grill" - it's a great marinade for any vegetables that you can grill.  I used summer squash, zucchini, sweet onion, broccoli and red pepper and everyone loved it!

It was a huge hit for the 4th bbq.  Next time I will add more eggplants since they soak up the marinade so well and are absolutely delicious!!!!!!

I tried this recipe "as is" and it was wonderful!  I was a little worried that there wouldn't be enough oil and vinegar, but by the time it had all marinated for two hours it was perfect. The fresh herbs were great, a wonderful way to cook fresh veggies in the summer! Definitely need a grill basket!

My husband made this dish with grilled tuna fillets and tiger prawn shrimp.  He made asparagus, red & yellow bell peppers, baby portabella mushrooms, red onions, and eggplant.  Instead of grilling, he sauted them in a huge wok....you'll need a really big pan if you use the original portion scale.  Anyway we both loved how it turned out.  Like one of the other reviewers, the eggplant did turn black while cooking.  It wasn't very appealing to look at but it was probably the most flavorful eggplant i've ever had.  We'll definitely use this one again.

I had no eggplant, but did have the rest of the veggies called for.  Also, had no fresh herbs and no time to get some, so used dried.  This is an EXCELLENT marinade.  Everybody loved the veggies - even the veggie haters!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Had some eggplant I needed to use so thought I would try this! Glad I did...had a girlfriend for dinner who loved it/she is a veggie lover... and gave her a copy of the recipe...next time I plan to make it with the suggested veggies minus mushrooms! Thanks for a terrific recipe...I will surely make this dish often!

Loved this - I grilled in a grill pan on medium-high heat.  Used eggplant, squash, zucchini, peppers (chopped) and mushrooms. Salted the eggplant after slicing and before marinating.  Marinated the squash, zucchini and peppers for 16 hours and then the eggplant and mushrooms for just 2. Good side for steak.

This is very versatile in that you can use other veggies along with the eggplant........whatever you have in the crisper!!  I'm always on the lookout for good vegetable combos and this is an excellent one. Eggplant is one of those kind of neutral tasting items that absorbs the flavors of a marinade quite well.

I really liked this marinade. I just used eggplant and yellow squash. I was also out of fresh oregano so I used 1 tablespoon of dried. I let the veggies marinate in a ziplock baggie for about 2.5 hours. The squash really absorbs the juices and flavors well. The eggplant was also good but not as flavorful.

Recipe overall was pretty good - nice flavor but it seemed like it was ALOT of food!  I have a family of 4 and we used the recipe that serves 6 and there was ALOT left over.  I would recommend cutting this recipe in half.  Overall pretty good recipe, although next time I will leave out the eggplant (wasn't a big fan of it) and cook the asparagus a couple minutes longer.

This was delicious.  Doubled the marinade.  You could really use whatever veggies you have on hand.  I'm not sure I like eggplant, but the yellow squash stole the show.

it wasn't that great for me. the eggplant came out looking pretty unapetizing, all though it was the yummiest since it absorved the liquid. still, didn't wow me. personally i'd preffer it simple w/ plain salt and pepper.

This is a simple and effective way to grill veggies. I altered the spices a little because I had to use dried herbs, but it was still very tasty. I also added some extra white vinegar for extra tang. Next time I will probably allow the veggies to sit for longer than 2 hours so that they really absorb all the flavor. I cooked everything on a grill pan and it turned out better than expected.

More like a 3.5... i used eggplant, zucchini, and yellow bell peppers as well as a sweet onion and white button mushrooms. Really good. Took at least 20 minutes to cook, if not longer.

Very good combination of flavors.  I quadrupled the marinade because I had a ton of veggies to marinade.  I used asparagus, eggplant, red onion, red bell pepper and portobello mushrooms (sliced).  The only thing I omitted was the fresh basil. Not because I didn't have any but because I was too lazy to walk out to the garden to pick it. LOL ! Absolutely delicious.  I marinated my veggies for over 24 hours because I was trying to do as much prep work for Father's Day without having to spend the entire day cooking.   The veggies held up really well and the eggplant really absorbed a nice flavor from marinating for so long. Thanks for sharing.

I have never been much of a veggie cooker but had a huge event to go to yesterday where there were vegetarians and vegans. Not only did they absolutely love this recipe, even meat-eaters were grabbing a bunch of it! I followed the serving size measurements for the marinade but did not follow for the veggies. It's better to make more marinade than less for this as, especially the eggplant (and if you use zuccini like I did), soaks up a lot of it.

Had to use mostly dried herbs as I didn't haven enough fresh ones, and added some fennel seed (wouldn't do that next time). If you choose to use dry as opposed to fresh, make sure to finely grind the herbs to avoid pieces which make it less enjoyable. Overall quite good. Served this as side to "Italian Rib Eye" from AR.

i grilled only peppers and eggplant, used less balsamic vinegar and more olive oil and two garlic cloves instead of six. i have used whole eggplants (peeled of course), cut into plates. i did not freeze it. ate this with baked potatoes... did not try the original version so i do not know if this is better or worse :D

Wow. Flavor to the max. This was so delicious. My husband devoured every bite. This was my first time to ever fix eggplant and I will definitely fix it again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I served this as a meatless meal over spaghetti with feta cheese-- added tomatoes to the mix as well-- very nice seasoning with the herbs- also added a little more balsamic and olive when cooked- great!

first thing that came out of my mouth was "holy sh**!"  bf thought the food was still super hot and i had burnt myself.. i said no it's just that good!  so he tried a piece and said "holy sh**!" was an appropriate response.. needless to say we thoroughly enjoyed this.. used 10 oz of broccoli and cauliflower, added 1 tsp of liquid smoke and 2 T of water.. ty so much for the recipe

Didn't have the same vegetables, didn't even have the fresh herbs so used dried.  They were still a hit with everyone.  Can hardly wait to use fresh herbs.

The flavor of this marinade was great, my husband and I really enjoyed it!!  I'm not sure if my veggies were larger than normal...but I doubled the recipe for the marinade and it still wasn't 'juicy' in the bag.  Either way it turned out excellent...I served it with quinoa

the spice marinade was quickly absorbed by the veggies but everything got coated still and was very tasty on the grill.  Will make this again.

This marinade is BY FAR the best vegetable marinade I have tried, and will be the only marinade I use to grill vegetables from here on out.  It really wouldn't matter what veggies you used, the marinade marries the flavors excellently.  Follow the marinade directions exactly, and you can't go wrong!

I had to use some dried herbs (1 TBSP each) for the marinade and increased the quantity of eggplant in place of the other vegetables.  The marinade was so dry that I had to rub it on the slices instead of just letting it sit.  After about an hour and a half I cooked a small batch.  The smell was wonderful!  But the taste was very, very bland and the eggplant was dry.  I let it sit for a full day before cooking the rest and it became succulent and flavorful.  But it still didn't quite live up to that incredible smell....

Very good grilled vegetables.  You could use any veggie really.. the secret is in the oil, vinegar, and herbs because that's what makes these grilled vegetables taste so great.  I've made this several times now with lots of different veggies and the family loves it.

Grilled veggies are always wonderful-such better flavor than steamed or sauteed. One easy time saving suggestion would be to use a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing (Paul Newmans is great) instead of making the marinade from scratch.

I have a bummper crop of eggplant and yellow peppers.  This marinade is excellent and the only thing I did differently was sprinkle the grilled veggies with a bit of freshly grated parmesan.  Loved it!

I didn't have time to marinate - just brushed it on while they cooked. I made kabobs except for the eggplant. Wonderful.

I had to use the dried spices that I had on hand.    It would be much better with fresh, I'm sure.   It was still really good.   Even my picky daughter ate a good portion without complaint.  :)

This was a nice mix.  Be sure to go easy on the garlic and allow the full time to cook the veggies.  Eggplant is not tasty unless its fully cooked.  :)  our mistake... :)

Holy  this marinade is FANTASTIC. As soon as I put it on my grill, my landlord in the next building came out onto his porch and commented on how good it smelled.  Everything tasted fantastic, too. Also, I think I had enough vegetables for like 10 people. Awesome awesome awesome awesome. I'm actually headed off to the grocery store to pick up the veggies again =) Thank you!  edit: depending how you slice/chop the veggies, you may need to lay down heavy-duty foil on the grill and use some no-stick spray. OR you can do what I did - buy a special stir-fry skillet for the grill! It has small holes all over, and you just use it right on the grill.

I made the veggies and soaked them overnight (no eggplant though).  I made chicken and steak kabobs the next day - only salt and peppered the meat.  As I created the kabobs the marinade soaked into the meat and flavored them.  My whole family really enjoyed that meal!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was good. I ended up having to chop things up and turn all the veggies into kabobs...but I really liked the flavor from both the balsamic and the grill itself.

This was wonderful!  I doubled the amount of oil and vinegar.  We don't care much for eggplant, but I tried this with broccoli and believe it or not - it was awesome!

Good, but it is missing something.  Not sure what.

This is a wonderful recipe! It was easy and flavorful! I grilled the veggies in a grilling pan, it made it much easier for me. Also, if you follow the recipe exactly, you are making a very large portion of veggies. I served 12 people, and still had leftovers.

As everyone said.  This is simple but amazing. I doubled the oil and vinegar.  I baked mine in the oven at 400 for the same amount of time on the grill.   I added sweet potatoes (had to cook 15 minutes ahead to finish all veggies at the same time. Also will replace cauliflower for the asparagus next time.   Based upon my experience, I would only use the yellow papers.   Putting the mushrooms on at the same time made them get a great deep coating.  This was so good that the two people I made it for at the entire recipe.

I love roasted vegetables so I knew I would like this. I only had eggplants and zucchinis, so that is what I used. Depending on how thick you slice the veggies they can take from 3 to 6 minutes per side over medium heat.

An instant favorite!  I used eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, onions and asparagus.  So easy to make.

This was really good. The method works very well. Marinating the veggies beforehand is excellent. Thank you for the recipe.

Have made this multiple times over the years with various combinations of vegetables.  It is now the only marinade I use when grilling vegetables.  The combination of herbs pairs well with a wide variety of veggies, including zucchini.

I used too much oil, but also didn't follow the recipe totally. Dilute with some water.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I cut the vegetables and sauted them in my electric frying pan.  These were a big hit with my guests.

This was delicious, this is the perfect way to get your grilled veggies. The only thing is that I doubled all the marinade ingredients  for the amount of veggies the recipe calls for as I was afraid they would lack taste. It turned out very good.
 Also, I didn't use a plastic bag, I just tossed everything in a bowl and covered it while I left it in the fridge for two hours. Save the planet, don't use plastic bags!

This really is good, and equally good cold the next day.  Use smaller, skinny eggplants instead of big round ones - for ease in marinating, cooking, etc.  Double the oil and vinegar.  I baked in oven at 325 for 15 minutes and then finished them under the broiler for 6 minutes - but watch closely.

Wow. Very good. Added a bit more oil and vinegar due to volume of vegetables. Delicious.

Ummm!!! So good but I thought there could have been a bit more sauce. Maybe all the eggplant soaked it up??  I will def. make this again.
