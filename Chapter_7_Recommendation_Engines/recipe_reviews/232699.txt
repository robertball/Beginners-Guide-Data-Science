Tried it tonight and it was great! I added two cloves of garlic (minced) with the zucchini and onions, and skipped heating the marinara sauce separately (seemed like overkill). Will definitely make again!

This recipe has a lot of potential. It is a simple and filling vegetarian dish. I only used half an onion and added mushrooms and a couple cloves of fresh, minced garlic while tossing the vegetables with olive oil and it came out pretty good. I used the parmesan cheese, but think I will try mozzarella next time.

I made a couple of changes, instead of pasta I use spaghetti squash, I also added green peppers mushrooms and garlic. I layered it with the spaghetti squash first then I put the marinara sauce then I put Parmesan cheese and then I put the vegetable mixture on top and on top of that I put mozzarella cheese. I also added a touch of lemon pepper, cayenne and celery salt. It was a Maysey

This was pretty good except I overcooked my pasta.  Otherwise I liked it.  It was a good way to use some of the bountiful zucchini from the garden! I did add a little mozzarella to the layers just because I love cheese!

This dish was amazing.  I mixed the marinara sauce with the noodles, and added green peppers and bacon to the top layer.  I fried the bacon, then the vegetables until a bit soft on top of the stove, then layered them onto the noodles, and topped it with some cheddar cheese.  We had Parmesan as an option. Delicious!

Nothing too creative.  
Tomato basil sauce for flavor. 
Zucchini , squash, and onion. 
Use refrigerated tortellinis. 
Top off with a bunch 1+ cup of parmesan cheese. 
Awesome conclusion.

Others said this was too dry; before placing the penne pasta in a casserole/baking dish spray with non-stick spray.  Place a little bit of a good marinara sauce (Bertolli brand with burgandy wine flavor) in the bottom of the dish, add the penne pasta & marinara sauce, toss lightly to coat the penne.  Then top the coated pasta with any remaining marinara sauce. -- Meanwhile, roast the zucchini & onion slices (one onion). -- Top pasta with zucchini & onion mixture, then a good parmesan cheese. --- I lastly sliced lengthwise 3-4 roma tomatoes to place on top, salt & pepper and/or Mrs. Dash garlic seasoning.  Cover with plastic wrap; set in refrigerator overnight.  Before baking bring casserole to room temperature, bake.   Serves 8+ with a good Italian salad.

Really easy to make and since I always have so much zucchini I’m always trying to find ways to use it. Flavors are great - After reading the reviews I did add minced garlic to the onions. I also roasted the onions alone for the 1st 15 minutes then added the zucchini so it didn’t get overdone. I didn’t have pasta but really want to make this so I substituted quinoa which worked fantastic. I’ll make it again with pasta next time as I think that would be great too. A

3 zuchinnis of what size? Since the size of zucchini’s varies considerably, a weight would be a better measurement for the  ingredient list. I also found the amount of pasta to be excessive  for the 28oz of sauce making the dish somewhat blah. Though I will use the recipe again cutting the pasta in half, using more zucchini and Parmesan cheese.

The roasted onion/zucchini added such a nice flavor. Hubby who doesn't like veggies gobbled it all up and wanted more!
I used 5 baby  zucchini and approx. 1 1/2 large white onion.   I didn't use all the pasta and sauce so I would cut that in about half next time .  Also would start baking the onion ahead of baby zucchini if using those to avoid them getting overcooked like mine did a bit.  This will become a regular! Great recipe!

Since it's just my husband and I, I decreased all measurements. However, I did use about 3/4 jar of marinara sauce. I added mushrooms and garlic to the veggies, as well as some Mozzarella to the Parmesan. I did not heat the marinara and baked it only 15-20 minutes. We enjoyed it, and I will make it again!

Made my own sauce, included 2 slices of finely chopped onion, skipped the roasted onion; used sheet pan for roasting the zucchini; 8oz gluten free penne pasta; 8oz whole mushrooms as middle layer, 2T parmesan; yes, I will make it again regularly.

I was very excited to try this recipe but it was not good, not even a little good.  I was trying to think of advice to make this more palatable - maybe try grilling the vegetables, or broil the vegetables at the end of the roast, maybe try smoked mozzarella cheese, maybe try white sauce instead of red sauce. My ultimate recommendation is to go straight to a different recipe.

I added fresh minced garlic and fresh mushrooms to my roasted veggies. For the pasta I used lumaconi noodles. Sprinkled Parmesan on the top before putting mozerella on top. Delicious

We enjoyed this but I likely won't make it again. It was a tad dry but we did enjoy it for dinner. The leftovers were tossed out since no one was interested in seconds. Besides being a little on the dry side - you need to be prepared to add some additional seasoning to taste.
