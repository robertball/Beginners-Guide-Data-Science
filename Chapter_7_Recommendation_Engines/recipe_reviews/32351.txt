I was able to make this at home in a few easy steps and only about 5 minutes. I had all the ingredients already and it was great, my mom loved it as well as my best friend. I am also only 14.

I have become a big fan of the orange/vanilla smoothies. All orange smoothies on this site are essentially the same. The options and variations are many, but mostly I just reduce the sugar and increase the vanilla for personal taste. This recipe, too, is wonderful. Thanks Kristine.

It was good, and my husband and I drank a big glass each for breakfast one morning.  It was really sweet, so next time I'm going to cut back on the sugar (maybe the brand of OJ I used was too sweet), perhaps cut it out all together.  But other than that it was good, and I will make it again!

This slush was actually not a slush at all, but a smoothie. It was 'liquidy', not icy. But it was delicious. If you don't like very sweet beverages, however, I wouldn't recommend this drink. But if you've got a sweet-tooth, go for it! It's very yummy.

I only made one change to this recipe--I cut the sugar in half. They all loved it, my husband thought this tasted like an Orange Julius, only a little milkier. Next time, I'd use equal amounts milk and orange juice. NOTE: This was enough for the three of them, in healthy serving sizes.

This is delicious and it's lowfat!  It's a much healthier alternative to ice cream to shut that sweet tooth up!  I like to throw in some frozen strawberries for something a little different.

I have absolutely no idea what I did wrong with this recipe.  I doubled the recipe because I only had a 12 oz can of frozen OJ.  The result was so bitter and weirdly grainy that I dumped the whole blender down the drain.  To be fair, maybe the OJ was exceedingly bitter.  In any case, I wouldn't try this recipe again.  Sorry!

1/2 Cup sugar is way to much for me, I cut it back to 1/3 and next time I might cut it back to 1/4.  Other than its great!  My 3 year old loves them :)

My son and I made these at the spur of the moment.  They were good but not great.  Maybe it just was not what we were lokoing for.  We enjoyed them, but would make changes if we make them again.

This is delicious!  It tastes just like an orange creamsicle.  I used skim milk and used Splenda instead of sugar (half the amount called for).  YUM!

This recipe tasted awesome! I only made 1 change. Rather than adding 1 can of frozen orange juice concentrate, I peeled 3 medium sized oranges. Also, instead of 10 cubes of ice, I added 2 Cups of crushed ice.

It came out heavenly and my 2 teenage cousins and parents LOVED it! Thanks alot.

My kids said this had a funny after-taste, but I thought it was pretty good.  I'm sure the brand of Joyce you use makes a difference.
