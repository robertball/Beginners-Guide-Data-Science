I really enjoyed this! Only a few modifications...sauteed the garlic with the onion in olive oil, added some crushed red chilies and diced celery with leaves. Recipe doesn't specify, but it is very important (in my opinion anyway) to use product of Spain or Italy tomatoes for the best flavor. I served topped with freshly grated parm cheese and crusty bread. So simple and delicious! Thanks

I enjoyed this soup however I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth.  It's  good with or without the garlic as I have tried it both ways.

This soup was so good.   The only thing I did differently was to use a 48 oz can of chicken broth instead of using the bouillon.  I also followed the other suggestion of adding in celery (two ribs) and red pepper flakes.  My husband definitely said this was a keeper.

I put everything in my crockpot!  I used a carton of vegetable broth and added 2 cups of water.  I used three different types of canned beans and added a tabelspoon of dried dill to make it interesting. I did have to add a good amount of salt - since everything I used was no salt added! The only part I cooked on the stove - was I sauteed 2 red onions and 2 medium hot peppers in grapeseed oil, butter, salt, and 2 tablespoons of sugar to almost caramelize them - then added them to the crockpot.  Cooked on low for 5 hours - WONDERFUL - the slight warmth from the peppers was perfect for this 23 degree night we are supposed to have!  Thanks!  Will use again and again - the crockpot - made this soooo easy!!!!!

i am glad i found this recipe; while i used what i had on hand, this recipe was a saving grace for me.
i had just made a small amount of chicken stock, added a small bunch of escarole, and after seeing this recipe, added some bruchetta that i made the other day.  i left out the beans, and boy is this good!!!  thanks so much for the post islandgirl17!

Great recipe everyone loved it! Only changes I made was I reduced the amount of garlic by half and saut√©ed it in olive oil before adding also I couldn't find the cannelloni beans so I substituted with with kidney beans. I reduced the cook time from 30 mins to 20mins as well.

I recently made this soup and it was delicious!!! This is my first time eating or making escarole/bean soup. I don't know how to make a recipe without "doctoring" it up, so I made a few changes because I can't help myself. I only added maybe 3/4 cup of fresh diced tomatoes because I had them on hand from making pizza. I used organic "Better than Boullion" instead of cubes because it has a deeper flavor than cubes. While sauteeing the onions and garlic, I also cubed and added a small smoked ham steak (figured it would be a good additive). It gave the soup a richer flavor - I am glad I did that. With some fresh garlic toast, it was definitely a hit in my house. I will definitely make it again - if I don't, my family may hurt me.

I'm from Rhode Island.  Italian food is our specialty.  Add a can of blended cannellini beans at the end to thicken it.  Also, we use a little pancetta with the olive oil and garlic to start.  It's a different, thicker soup but sure you'll love it.

Excellent as written, I've made it many times.  =) 
I've also tried some variations as suggested by others.  Delicious as well.
My favorite variation is to add cooked sausage (last 30 mins with escarole) and red pepper flake (when sauteing the onion) to give it some heat.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Love this and mainly because of the additions of the tomatoes.  Who would have thought?  I do play around with it a bit here and there.  That's just what I do!  Something slightly different each time, but have made it exactly as it says and still was great.  Def need the parm for it!!

Super, super yummy! Will definitely be making again! Very easy. I followed the recipe as written, though I did throw in some cooked crumbled Italian sausage and a handfull of elbow macaroni for the Hubs.

Delicious! I understand now why there's only 5 star reviews of this so far. Also added red pepper flakes and used chicken stock instead. Didn't have garlic cloves, so used garlic powder instead. Definitely a new favorite.

Yum! I added two cans of tuna for some protein boost and 1/2 cup of red quinoa for texture. Delicious!

I have made this twice.  I do I vegan variation with veggie broth but it needs a bit more salt and seasonings like Spike.  Fast and filling.

Love this recipe.  The only things I do differently are ..I use fire roasted tomatoes, canned chicken broth, and occasionally I add some fresh basil and thyme from my garden when able.  I also put a little parmesan in the soup while cooking. Have made this really often, always great!
