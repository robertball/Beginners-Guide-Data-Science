My mom used to slave over our traditional cinnamon rolls every Christmas eve so they would be ready to pop in the oven on Christmas morning... it probably took her an hour.  Last year I made these instead and not only did the family rave about them (they taste the same as my mom's old recipe) it only took me 5 mins to make!  They're incredibly easy to make and they're delicious!  My variation: butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla, no raisins, and I first sprinkle the pudding over the rolls and then mix the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter together to pour on top.

I've made these for years.  It's a Christmas tradition at my house.  Beware though, they're so good that you can't stop eating them!  I also made half the pan with raisins and half with nuts.  This way, everyone is happy!  These are the best.

This was a great recipe, my family loved it! The only problem i ran into was choosing the wrong rolls. Make sure that your frozen dinner rolls are still doughy and will form together. I accidentally got the kind that I believe are partially cooked and they did not combine, but still tasted great. I added a little hot water and some extra butter over the rolls to moisten the sugar mix into a sauce. I topped them with a cream cheese icing, delicious!

Awesome!  I was skeptical about letting them in room temp all night, afraid I would wake up to rolls overflowing.  BUT they were perfect!  I did not add the raisins, nor did I add any icing on top.  These cinnamon rolls were perfect and will be made many more times here at my house!  Thanks for the recipe!--Okay, I made these again, but didn't have the pudding.  Boy did they turn out fantastic!  I like them better without the pudding mix added (and raisins or icing).  They are more like a sticky bun, all ooey, and gooey!

We have a weekend house in Galveston, Tx, and  I am always looking for great recipes that are easy.  This recipe is a staple for us.  Everyone loves them, and they are soooooo easy to make.  The only change I made was to use chopped pecans instead of rasins.  Also, we like the way they bake in cake pan instead of the Bundt pan.  Thanks for the submission!

I've made these several times and they just didn't turn out how I wanted so I made a few changes. The brown sugar mixture was always too dry and grainy.  I didn't want monkey bread like the photo, so I made 1/2 the recipe in a square 8x8 cake pan.  I left out the rasins and used  1/4 cup butter with 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also cooked the brown sugar and butter till it came to a boil.  Remove from heat. I then added the cinnamon and pudding mix.  I also added 1/2 - 1 Tbsp. of cream. I poured this into the bottom of  my pan and placed the rolls on top. Baked at 350 the next morning for about 15-20 minutes. This worked for me and they turned out great.  The brown sugar mixture is about the consistency of pudding and the rolls are soft and gooey.

I have tried it 3 times now, each time thinking it was me, but each time I take them out of the oven, it is the same result.  The sugar, pudding, cinnamon mix is crystalized and not melted.  No one else seems to have this problem, but I can't imagine that it's me??  I've used a stone bundt pan (Pampered Chef)--could that be the problem

These were delicious!  I made them for a brunch and they turned out so great that I made them again for an extended family Christmas.  A few variations...as suggested by another reviewer, I used butterscotch instant pudding mix instead of vanilla.  I also used chopped pecans instead of raisins.  This turned out great!  Tasted much better than pecan rolls at the local and chain bakeries!  Finally, my cooking time was shorter.  Although the recipe calls for 25 minutes, mine only took 20 minutes to be done.

These turned out delicious and are very easy to make.  I didn't use a whole cup of sugar, I think the sugar could possibly be cut in half. I drizzled the tops with a frosting made of powdered sugar and milk after they came out of the oven. Also, I bought frozen dinner rolls which were already in an aluminum pan so I just baked them after putting the topping on.

Very simple and yummy.  Very sweet, but I wouldn't expect anything else!!  I made a frosting to go on top, which added to the sweetness.  Not really like cinnamon rolls to me, but they were still tasty!

Oh. My. Lawd. This is fantastic! Really does taste like homemade bread. I made it exactly as written but only used 10 rolls because there are only two of us. It was just one layer around the bottom of my bundt pan, but by morning they had risen and filled the whole pan and looked great! I made a cream cheese glaze. Im expecting a baby, but  I know this will be our new Christmas morning tradition! What kid wouldn't want this?!

I have been making these for many years, but use 1/2 pkg cook & serve butterscotch pudding, 1/4 C brown sugar and 3 tablespoons of butter cut into small pieces, and use pecans instead of raisins.  No need for all that sugar.  We don't save these for special occasions, but have sent to neighbors houses when you want to share something special.  Always get great comments.

This recipe was so easy! Honestly, I was skeptical, but the outcome was wonderful yumminess. As other reviewers suggested, I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the dry mixture. I didn't frost with a frosting, because we don't prefer the over-sweet Cinnabon style of cinnamon rolls. The crisp sweet glaze was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Quick note, if you can not find frozen buns in the store just buy the standard frozen bread and cut into small chunks while still partialy frozen, this way you always have some emergency loafs of fresh bread in the freezer in case of bad weather like today...let is snow!!!

These were absolutely wonderful.  Loved that all I had to do was bake them in the morning.  I did the recipe as is and wouldnt change a thing.  I did make a cream cheese icing for them though.  I will definately be making these again and again.

the topping on these tasted like the cinnamon crunch bagel topping at St Louis Bread Co/Panera - yum! Used vanilla pudding, only used raisins on half of it.  Turned out okay, was a little disappointed, definitely easy though. Made in 9x13 pan. Did not need icing on top, sweet enough without it.

Great recipe!  It couldn't have been easier, and a great way to have hot cinnamon rolls in the morning without all the fuss.  I used butterscotch pudding mix instead of vanilla - and I used the whole box.  It was the regular cook kind, not instant.  I also doubled the cinnamon and the melted butter, and added chopped pecans along with the raisins.  I increased the cook time by 10 minutes, and tented aluminum foil over the cinnamon rolls for that time so they wouldn't overbrown.  Even with the extra bake time, they were a little too soft.  Twenty frozen dinner rolls expands in a bundt cake pan to nearly overflowing!  My husband loved this recipe.  These rolls are really good warmed up in the microwave and with melted butter slathered over them.  YUM!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made the butterscotch variety for years, so this was a nice twist.  My butterscotch recipe directed that one melt the butter with the brown sugar and bring that mixture to a boil, so I did the same with this version.  I also substituted Craisins for the raisins as I prefer those.  I think that icing would be good, but for this first attempt I thought that it was very good even without it.

I have made this recipe only using butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla pudding.  Makes it more like sticky buns.  Also added cream cheese frosting adding a little milk to make it more pourable over the top.  Very Good!!

I liked the idea of doing this the night before and leaving at room temp.  But I for sure prefer regular monkey bread or regular cinnamon rolls taste-wise.

I baked these in a 8x8 casserole dish.  The rolls rose just fine and baked evenly, also.  I added a little less than half a cup of butter and used a small pack of pecan pieces.  My husband loved them.  They fell into themselves when cut or picked up but my family likes that texture.  They have been requested for a repeat in the near future.

We make half and it makes breakfast for two mornings for two of us.  We use the same amount of butter as full recipe and also use butterscotch pudding.    When I make this for Company, it is always a big hit.

I use butterscotch pudding, & not the instant kind.  Let mine sit n oven overnight to rise.  This is for the reviewer that didn't like the idea of it sitting out overnight.  Also, its great to cover with foil to have on

Added some pecans with the raisins and did top it with a powdered sugar/milk glaze.  Don't think it was quite as done as it could have been, but it was still a really big hit at a church brunch.

Very disappointed.  A congealed mess that even my kid who eats anything would not touch.  I followed the directions exactly.  If it only works with certain frozen dinner rolls...then that should be shared.  This is the first recipe that I have been extremely disappointed by.  The brown sugar just burned to the muffin in a congealed mess.

Very good. Made with and without glaze, and let sit out overnight and also tried just baking it soon as it was made. Preferred the glaze and letting the butter and other ingredients sink in overnight. Also substituted pecans for raisins.

Super easy and super yummy.  I was a little skeptical that the pudding mix and melted butter would spread over all the rolls, but it turned out fabulous.  Very sweet, I think icing would be over the top for my tastes.  All 4 kids asked for seconds, only thing they agreed on all day.

I have made these twice.First time they were AMAZING, slightly moist top...second time, as several other reviewers had happen, the topping crystalized!!! Ugh...not sure what I did differently...will try one more time...had something to do with the butter not mixing down to the Cinn/sugar mix the same way..not getting thru the rolls..might try one hint to use more butter or maybe make a sauce of the butter/part of cinn/sugar mix, then put in the bottom of the bundt pan.

I have made these for years, except I alwasy use 1/2 cup of margarine/butter melted instead of 1/4 cup. I have made all the variations I can think of' nuts, no nuts, butterscotch pudding or vanilla pudding; raisins, craisins, chocolate chips... you name it, and it always turns out great. It gets 5 stars for being tasty and easy!

We had these for Christmas Morning and they are a new tradition. Delicious. I made them in a bundt pan and next time will use a 9 X 13 - I will also cut the sugar a bit as they were just a bit too sweet for our taste.  I addded pecans and really liked that.  I used the cinnabon clone icing from thise site to frost and will use about 1/2 next time as it made way too much.  Really a great reciepe and couldn't be any easier!!

Made these for Christmas morning. They are SO easy and very good.  I was nervous about letting them sit out over night so I left them in the fridge instead.  Then let them sit at room temp for about 2 hours before baking them this morning.  They were perfect and delicious!  Oh yeah...I didn't add raisins.  Chopped pecans instead. Yum!

This is good, easy, and appeals because it is prepared  the night before. Next time I will cut rolls in forths or at least in half, however. I frosted mine with peanut butter icing because that's a family tradition.

Great recipe..I make real from scratch cin rolls every year.  This year I'm working and this was so much easier!  I used butterscotch pudding as suggested and pecans instead of raisins.  I used the bundt pan and the middle was too dough so I'll increase the time a little.  I just drizzled some icing. Very good and easy recipe!

i always have cinnamon rolls on christmas morning, but oh the work even with other overnight ones. this is my recipe now. i don't like cooked raisins so i substituted pecans. excellent. i halved the recipe since their is only two of us and put them in a loaf pan. the rolls are pretty big, but that just calls for more topping! next time i think i'll use less sugar, and more butter, the topping was a bit thick. but, otherwise just what the season orders. thanks for posting.

These were really easy to make.  I don't really remember if I counted the rolls - meaning I added more than 20 - or used too small a pan, but mine overflowed by the next morning.  It wasn't a problem, I just punched them down a little and no one knew the difference.  They tasted great!

Excellent recipe! Everytime I make these rolls, someone always asks for the recipe. The only thing I changed was the amount of butter (I added more) and I eliminated the raisins. Very good, Thanks!

I tried this recipe and was disappointed.  I think I will stick to the "monkey bread" version with refrigerated biscuits.  The rolls seemed just too big.

With 4 kids to feed every morning,  I found this one to be a crowd pleaser and welcome change of pace.  I add powdered sugar icing to it because we have a sweet tooth and it is SO yummy.
