These are so good! And I love that it makes a small batch. I recently bought coconut flour and was looking for  a way to use it. I followed the recipe exactly...except for a minor change. I didn't have coconut milk, but I did have almond/coconut blend. I wasn't sure what to expect because the mixture seemed very thin at first. I whisked it for a couple minutes til fully blended and it did thicken up. Coconut flour does absorb liquids quite well. The muffins are smallish (hmmm, maybe that's why I ended up eating 4 the day I made them! Oops!) but a nice size for a quick snack. These actually taste more like cupcakes to me. They have a slight eggy texture, but nothing that's unpleasant. The honey and vanilla flavors really come through. Next time I might even use slightly less honey - not because of the flavor, but just to lower the sweetness a bit.  The only thing I might suggest is to maybe use less butter because the bottoms were greasy. I might even try this with coconut oil! Thanks Chris for sharing your recipe!

These were delicious and moist. I used honey as per the recipe, but opted for coconut oil instead of butter/ghee. I also dribbled shredded coconut and slivered almonds on top of the batter before baking - really yummy! Finally, in order to avoid the small muffins, I TRIPLED the recipe and I got 12  full muffins, as you can see from the picture where they are still in my ceramic muffin baker. That means I had to use nine eggs for twelve muffins, so I am telling myself that they are pretty abundant in protein too - breakfast?!?!?   ;-D

I make these almost every morning for my little boys. I use ghee or coconut oil instead of butter, and leave out the milk too. I've started adding an organic squash and they love them that way too.

These are by far the best Paleo muffins I've had. I substituted agave nectar for the honey and coconut oil for the butter. I also doubled the recipe. Yum.

(BTW my first recipe review)

I followed this recipe pretty closely, but I did make some very slight changes; so for that I gave it 4 stars. I really enjoyed the muffins; they had a less eggy taste and consistency than other coconut flour muffins that I have I made. 

I used these minor adjustments or adaptations: Instead of coconut milk, I used the same amount of unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  Also in addition to vanilla extract, I added the same amount of coconut and almond extract.  Although the butter seemed melted enough after a few seconds in the microwave, it still got chunky when I added it to the liquids bowl, so it seemed that I had to blend the liquid and dry ingredients more than indicated in the recipe. Finally I topped with sliced almonds and coconut before I baked them for about 20 minutes at 400 as indicated.  I used lightly greased silicone muffin cups, and when they were cool, they popped right out and into my mouth.

I've made a lot of paleo muffins and I like these a lot! They are pretty easy to make and they taste good!
I only had one egg so I had to make 2 flax eggs. 1 TBSP ground flax and 3 TBSP water is one flax egg.
They still turned out well, just of course not as fluffy as using regular eggs.

I absolutely love these! Great for anyone on a low-carb diet when they need a "bread fix". This does the trick. Super moist and they freeze well. You can also have fun with the recipe and add spices/fruits but it's perfect as it is!

Made this twice so far. Absolutely love it! Tried it with butter the first time then gave coconut oil a go in replacement. Both times sprinkled flaked almonds on top ????I think the coconut oil ones tasted the best. All in all a great and easy recipe that you can easily change for something different. I'm going to add banana next.

Really really good. They were very light muffins. My only gripe was the bottoms burned and I had them in the oven for about 15-17 minutes. Oh and instead of butter, I used coconut oil (on the paleo diet and wasn't too sure about using butter). It definitely satisfied that sweet craving since my clean eating lifestyle lol.

Really great!! I replaced honey with coconut sugar (about 1/4 cup) and I added a small, ripe banana to replace an egg and a few teaspoons of flax. I also added some cinnamon and fresh blueberries. Such a great base recipe! Definitely will make again!

These were so fluffy, light and tasty! I struggle with coconut flour, so I was happy to find a recipe where it worked out so well. The only variation I made was adding coconut flakes to the top. I am a big fan of these!

I am always on the hunt for healthful breakfast entrees.  With muffins,  I look for ones that have eliminated empty carbs (wheat, rice and potato flours) . . .  and still taste great.  Not just ok-but-healthful (ugh!); I want flat-out delicious muffins!  And these muffins are that: delicious!
My husband is a longtime family practice physician and so we try to eat very healthfully.  Because of that, I did change just a few things.  We drink almond milk, so I used that instead of coconut milk.  I also used Smart Balance instead of real butter.  I doubled the recipe to give me larger muffins.  I also poked in 4 large fresh blueberries once the batter was in the cups.  I topped each muffin with a bit of shredded coconut mixed with finely chopped (but not powdered)  walnuts. Oh, and I used my new silicone muffin cups, instead of paper muffin cup liners.  What a difference those made!  These muffins, turned out wonderfully!  They came out of the silicone cups easily and in one piece.  They were perfectly cooked, moist but not falling apart moist, and so delicious! I will definitely be making them again and again. In fact, I'm making another batch this afternoon, as my husband and I love them!

These are amazing.  They're fast and easy and if you get bored of them you can add all sorts of other things to change up the flavor.  My son calls them cupcakes they're so good

I really liked these. They were super easy to make. I used cow's milk instead of coconut milk and coconut oil instead of butter, because that's what I already had. They turned out really good, and I'll definitely make them again.

Good starter recipe! First I doubled it to make 12, then I changed the recipe to make them a little more hearty for breakfast. I added 1/2 cup more of coconut flour, 1/4 cup of granola, and a little bit more milk. I used my Kitchenaid to mix these, and it turned out very dense, but that's what I wanted :) I because of the granola and flour, it was a lumpy and the 400 degree left with some burnt tips, but nothing that would change my mind on this recipe. They did stick to the paper, but that's how coconut products are, so not the fault of the author.

Very good!   This works better than almond flour and teff flour recipes I've tried.  There is quite a bit of sugar in the honey, so next time I'll reduce that.  I sprinkled a little unsweetened coconut on the tops.  Definitely use muffin papers.

Delicious!  They had a light, almost custardy texture and a wonderful flavor.  Like some suggested, I added some orange peel to give more flavor.  I used hazelnut liquor in place of vanilla - it's cheaper and more flavorful!  Next time, I will use less honey.  After a month of Whole30, these taste VERY sweet!

I love that this recipe makes a small batch.  I just made some more tonight, so I tripled the recipe and added 1 and 3/4 cup of craisins and the rind of one navel orange.  Turned out awesome.  If I have enough honey I am making more tomorrow and adding blueberries.

These are great! Added almond extract, for extra flavor. Did not taste eggy at all, they were absolutely delicious.

Probably would of given it more star if I hadn't slightly messed up the recipe by adding too much coconut flour and compensating with more coconut milk to get batter less thick. I also used coconut oil rather than butter and I added a little almond extract as well as sprinkled coconut shavings on top. Was pleasantly surprised of how yummy these were. And easy!!! Like others, have been experimenting with coconut and almond flour recipes to be more health conscious for me and my boyfriend. After finding the only cookies he likes are the coconut lime cookies (which don't work so well with coconut flour-too flaky and fall apart), I thought I would try these. Will absolutely do again. Love they aren't too sweet and can use all natural ingredients! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

Came out great I used a vegan butter in place of butter and almond milk instead.

I love these. I made these and could not believe how great they taste. I used coconut oil instead of butter and water instead of milk. I was a little skeptical. But one bite and I could not believe it. Its like cheating without the consequences. Will defiantly make these again.

I doubled the recipe and ended up with 9 muffins. After reading some reviews, I topped the muffins with shredded coconut & sliced almonds before baking. Perfect addition and adds a great crunch. This recipe is so delicious. Best Paleo muffin yet as far as taste and consistency. YUMMY ??

I'm trying to change my diet to the Paleo plan and I was having an urge for something sweet.  I did change a few things with this recipe.  I doubled the recipe because I knew six little muffins wouldn't be enough.  I used  coconut oil instead of butter, and to the batter I added a quarter cup of chopped sliced almonds and a half cup of thickly shredded coconut. This added a nice texture.  I also reduced the honey by one tablespoon.  Before baking the batch I put a few sliced almonds and shredded coconut on top of the muffin batter  before baking.  These turned out so well that my husband even ate one!  I will be saving this recipe and making it again for sure!

I made changes only because it's the day before I get the weekly groceries. 
I used cashew milk, coconut oil, and a flax egg.
I sprinkled coconut on top before baking.
I think they are heavenly!!

These are excellent! When you just need a 'bread' fix, they are wonderful. Dense but light - if that makes any sense. They have a great consistency, and can be made somewhat sweet (the recommended amount of honey), or less sweet (I reduced the honey to 2 tbls and they are great!). Perfect to accompany Terrific Turkey Chili (a great replacement for cornbread).

This recipe is really awesome.  When I  was preparing  I thought  that  "Well this is not going to work" but when I  added  the coconut flour, it absorbed well all liquids ingredients. The muffins was really fluffy. The good thing is that you can make a small batch with this recipe with just 2 net cabs  for recipe.(just counting the flour)

These muffins are very good.  Only thing is the recipe only makes 4 regular size muffins.  (see my photo).  Followed recipe, and put flaked coconut on top pre-baking.  I can see that this is a good base batter for either sweet or savory alternatives.  Thanks for posting.

I made this recipe but changed a few things which made it turns out more cup cake like. Instead of honey I used sugar and I didn't put any vanilla since I didn't have any. I also added cinnamon which made it taste extra good. It turned out much more appealing than the picture showed and also tasted really good!

Yummy little muffin, nice and moist too!  A nice basic recipe that you could easily add in different flavors, strawberries would be great!
