This was nice for a quick lunch as my husband was working from home today.  I made the egg salad and added a little sliced green onion along with a bit of salt and pepper.  I toasted the English muffins then added the Canadian bacon.  I wasn't sure about the warm egg salad part so I just added the egg salad and topped with the shredded cheese.  I didn't bother baking it.

Oh, yum this was delicious egg salad! A few weeks ago I had an egg salad that was similar at a restaurant and I was looking on AR to see if I could find anything similar. I was in luck with this one! I love the addition of the bacon and cheese, something that my husband was not too sure about, however he ended up eating two sandwiches. So I think it went over all right. I did not have English muffins and our tiny store here does not carry them (strange, I know) so I just made them on regular sandwich bread and they turned out wonderful. Also added just a little more mustard, but they would have been perfectly fine without adding more also, just a personal preference. I can't wait to make these again sometime soon! Thanks, Deborah!

THANK YOU, DEBORAH! I have been searching for an egg salad recipe that didn't have relish or onions in it & thanks to you , I have found the most wonderful of them all, to me! :) It was great the way you made it because I tasted it then, but added a bit of black pepper & garlic to mine. So glad that I doubled the recipe because I ate half of the salad before it even made it to the English Muffins! :) Again, thank you for giving me the egg salad I have been in quest of for a while! :)

I made this today for a quick lunch and it was fantastic!. I made some adjustments based on what I had in my kitchen. Instead of Canadian bacon, I used threw some bacon bits into the mix, but I'm sure Canadian bacon would be great. I also used two mini whole wheat bagels instead of English muffins.

 I used dijon mustard instead of regular prepared mustard. This definitely gave it a different taste. I'd recommend using regular prepared or ground mustard.

I made this for breakfast, just because I came across a good sale on english muffins and I needed to use them quick. I also had three hard boiled eggs that I needed to use asap. This egg mixture was enough to feed my two boys and I for breakfast. I didn't have any Canadian bacon, so I omitted it. I didn't add a whole lot of mayo because the kids don't care for it, and I stirred some shredded cheese in the egg mixture as well as on top. I sprinkled Frank's on top of mine, as I like my food spicy. It went over okay. I think it would be better with diced bacon. If I make this again, I'll try it that way.

Quick and easy open-faced sandwich.  I made this for dinner and have also made for breakfast.  I did not have Canadian bacon on hand but used ham.  Also used pepper jack for the cheese.  Very good recipe - thanks for sharing Deborah.

Deborah, I can't tell you how much I loved this sandwich! I upped the mustard and added onion and garlic powders and black pepper. I used taylor ham a/k/a pork roll with this that I browned in a skillet first. Delicious and thank you!!

This egg salad was BLAND.  It wasn't bad, just had no flavor whatsoever.  I'll try it again with more mustard and maybe some crushed red pepper for some kick.

I used bacon crumbles instead of Canadian bacon, added some green onion, and put a slice of tomato on the muffin before adding the egg salad and cheddar. A tasty, quick hot lunch!

I meant to follow the recipe exactly, but I committed the cardinal sin of reading the recipe too quickly and getting distracted.  And so, I accidentally added the shredded cheddar to the egg salad mixture.  Duh.  Not a problem, as it turned out.  I did want to have some melted cheddar on the top, so I just sprinkled on a bit more before the muffins went into the oven.  In our family, there can never be too much cheese.

Everyone loved these and really wants to have them again.  Thank you, Deborah!

P.S.  Hub added Tabasco sauce to his serving, but that's just him.

Very tasty! I made with deli ham and cheese and I didn't have any English Muffins, but they turned out wonderful with toast! I will definitely make these again. My Husband loved them too!

A very creative idea for our summertime meal. I doubled the recipe for the 3 of us, added a little more mustard, and used part FF mayo. I didn't have Canadian bacon, so I used regular bacon with good results. I think Canadian bacon would add the crowning touch! My husband rated it 5 but wished for some hollandaise. Served it on English Muffins with Chunky Applesauce, both recipes from this site. Neat idea, Deborah!

Giving it 5 stars because this tasted really good considering the prep time. I modified the recipe a bit: toasted the english muffin with a little cheddar cheese on top, then added the mixture of hard boiled egg, mustard & mayo (which i just eyeballed). I've never had an egg salad sandwich on an english muffin with cheese- definitely added some flavor!

We love egg salad, but never thought of heating it up and serving like this, glad I came across this recipe. The only thing I did differently, was to add a small amount of grated onion, and some black pepper. Other than that did exactly as recipe called for. We thought was quite easy to make and very tasty!

This was excellent. It can also be spread on bread (I used a heavier Spelt bread). I love easy breakfast foods and this one fit the bill. It is good for an item on a brunch buffet too.

I love egg salad. I have never had it warm with cheese before. This was a nice change.
