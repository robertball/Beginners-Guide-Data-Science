DELCIOUS! This was so simple to throw together, but the flavors make it seem like it took a lot of work. LOVE the combo of flavors...the sweet/salty/smoky/crunchiness of the whole thing works incredibly well. This is a new favorite and a  definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! I also added some celery for additional crunch. It sweetened up after sitting overnight.

Wow!  Just awesome!  Only change I made was I used 1/2 c chopped bacon, 1/4 c mayo, omitted the pecans but used 1/4 c chopped celery.  We now a new favorite chicken salad in my house.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!
