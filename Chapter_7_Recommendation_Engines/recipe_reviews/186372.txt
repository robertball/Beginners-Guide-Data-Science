I thought this recipe was ok. I used Amber Bock, and the flavor just didn't go well with the cheese. I added a little worchestershire sauce after I tasted it, and it made it a little better. Maybe this recipe would've been better if I chose I better beer.

The first time I made it, as you both said, it was ok, but could not salvage, so I decided to experiment.  I added an 8oz package of cream cheese and used 1/2-3/4 of a can of beer.  It came out much better, the consistency was perfect.  I also added a pinch of pepper and onion powder.
