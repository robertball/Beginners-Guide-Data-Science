My husband enjoyed this one.  I didn't have coconut, and he doesn't like pineapple, so we toasted the almonds with some sugar and used mandarin oranges instead.  It turned out great!

this is a great idea and the crust is fantastic. I want to try this again and make a sauce out of pineapple to drizzle over the fish, or to dip in. and then I think it will be a hit!

This was okay, it was rather soggy tasting and I wasn't super crazy about it. I think it could be greatly enhanced by using some panko bread crumbs, removing the eggs all together, and using a drizzle of butter and then adding the topping mixture, minus the nutmeg.

Maybe this would be a better recipe with a different fish.  Didn't care for the nutmeg, brown sugar, coconut and flour-especially with the pineapple=too sweet. Kind of like a thin cake batter coating despite making as light a coating as possible. Suggest trying with shrimp instead. and deep-frying.

I just made this for tonight's dinner and it is wonderful. Since I had no tilapia, I used pollack fillets and the coating kept the fish moist. 
I did not make the sauce since we are counting our carbs but next time, I will. I think it would be entirely appropriate for this tasty dish.

This was a good meal, but I'd probably cut back on the coconut if we made again and three eggs was more than enough; two would be fine.

I enjoyed this recipe, a nice new take on Tilapia. Perhaps adding ginger next time or some olive oil and sea salt to really bring out the crispy exterior.
