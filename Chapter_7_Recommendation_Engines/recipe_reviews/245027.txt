Very satisfying dish. For personal preferences, omitted the onions and Italian seasoning, and just seasoned how my husband and I like. Also subbed cooked butternut squash for the pumpkin, and sour cream (with a little pasta water) for the cream. Proportions and timing kept the same, but halved the recipe for just the two of us. I'll make this again.

Very good casserole! I made it as the recipe was written, except I used tricolor rotini (very pretty for fall!), and used half and half instead of cream. The consistency was fine, and we loved the flavor!  I'm passing it on to friends!

This was awesome! I doubled the bacon and put a layer of provolone under the Parmesan.

Made this with left over pumpkin from our jack-o'-lanterns ! You'd never guess there is pumpkin in it.  There red pepper flakes give it just the right hint of spice,  Even my  6 and 12 year old kids gave it a thumbs up!  Delicous!

I also did not think this would be good but I had to try it. we loved it. The only thing I didn't have was red pepper flakes so not sure if it made a difference. Also makes a lot def sharing my leftovers  with the rest of the family.

I will admit, I did not have high hopes for this recipe at all! I almost wondered if it would even be edible... But I decided to make it since I had all the ingredients and I was trying to "cook out of my pantry" WOW!!! It's actually amazing and tastes delicious!!! No changes, it may not be a recipe I will repeat every month but I definitely will repeat it!

Wow! This is incredible! I wanted to make it because of the unusual combination of ingredients and it will be a dish I make again. I wouldn’t change a thing. Using tri-colored rotini is a great way to make it look appealing.

Delicious. I used half n half. Only change would be to reduce the red pepper a tad for company. My family Ioves spicy, but grandma couldn’ t take the heat.

Delicious and easy. I generally followed the recipe but used a bit more bacon, onion and Parmesan than it called for. I also had sausage links rather than ground sausage so cut it into rounds. The red pepper flakes add just the right amount of heat. I do think that you can detect just a bit of pumpkin in the dish... it’s not overpowering, but it’s there!

This was delicious.  We are moving towards more pumpkin based pasta dishes and away from tomato.  I did put my own spin on this recipe.  First,  we make our own chicken stock.  Also, I added 2 tbsp organic raw unbleached cane sugar crystals.  1 tbsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp fennel (from our garden), thinly sliced zucchini, diced yellow squash, mushroom pieces.  The sausage got changed to 1/2 lb sweet Italian and a 1/2 lb mild.  It's what we had in the freezer.  This dish is simply delicious.

We did like this recipe but in an effort to lighten it up made some changes.  I substituted milk for the heavy cream and omitted the bacon.  Since I used hot Italian turkey sausage, I left out the red pepper flakes.  I added 3 cups of butternut squash chopped into 1/2" cubes and sauteed with the onion and garlic.  I also halved the salt and it was still plenty salty due to the sausage, cheese and chicken broth.  Also, I used sage and pumpkin pie seasoning in place of the Italian seasoning.  The sauce thickened beautifully.  I will make this again.

Delicious! Creamy with just a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes (the cream really tones that down). Only variation we made was using gluten-free pasta. We will definitely be making this again.

I wasn’t expecting much from this recipe but it really surprised me. The pumpkin flavour is very subtle. I did add a bit of extra bacon, which I really enjoyed and a bit of cheddar cheese to make it a bit more Mac-and-cheese-esque. It was REALLY good! Can’t wait to eat the leftovers!

It was very good.  Used chicken italian sausage.  Used thyme, basil and oregano in place of italian seasoning.  Used ff 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Didn't take the time to cook it in pan long enough t hicken it, but it thickened nicely in the oven.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious! My husband loved it & he is not a big pumpkin fan.  Don't taste the pumpkin, it just makes it creamy.
