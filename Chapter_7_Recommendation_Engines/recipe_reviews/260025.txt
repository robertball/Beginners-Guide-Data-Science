First time I made cold brew coffee. Taste smoother than regular brewing with hot water but use much more coffee. I don't add vanilla or cinnamon.

I've never tried cold brewing before, and I thought this turned out fine. The only thing is the ground cinnamon was a bit difficult to filter through, but it had a nice flavor.
