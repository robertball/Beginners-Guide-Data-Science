SOOOO GOOOD!  I added  more garlic to spice it up but it was awesome!  I've already made it like 5 times for company.  I got a huge jar of artichoke hearts at costco.  LOVE IT!

I added about a half a head of minced roasted garlic. Next time I make this, I'll find some way to spice it up a bit more, even if it is with just a little extra garlic or garlic powder.

Just made this last night and it turned out very tasty.  Really nice appetizer.  Only problem I had was making the braid.  I couldn't seem to follow the directions...so mine was an artichoke log.
