I fixed this for dinner last night. I took the advice of other viewer and added a pinch of basil oregano and garlic. I also used rotel instead of tomatoes.Lots of flavor. My extremely picky 10 yr old son loved it! Thank you for the recipe will make again and again.

I followed another's idea of oregano and basil, drained the juice from the tomatoes down the drain and added 1 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce and approx. 1/4 tsp. mustard powder. One of the best soups I have ever had. My 4 year old son asked me to make it again.

I thought this recipe was really good. I will definately be using it again. i had never had a stew with regular hamburger meat i had always had it with stew meat cooked in a slow cooker. i used the french grean beans and spicy tomatoes just because i like them better. and broth instead of the cubes and water because i didnt have cubes... i used onion salt instead of onions because if my friend sees an onion she wont eat it but i wish i would have... and i thought about adding corn and i think next time i will

Very nice. This is very easy and a relatively quick meal. I did add some spices: garlic rosemary thyme and basil. I ended up letting it simmer for a while which made it thicken from the potatoes breaking down but it was still pretty good. Not bad at all from something that uses two cans and a few other ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great quick weeknight meal. I used 3 cans of beef broth instead of bouillon and substituted leftover sauteed cabbage and frozen mixed veggies for the green beans. Great way to clear out some of the leftover veggies in the fridge! The stew is a great base that can be varied depending on what is available in your pantry!

This was very good! I followed the advice of others' and added a pinch of garlic basil and oregano to the meat and onions while browning. I also used ground turkey because it was all I had and it is a bit healthier. I didn't think it was too salty at all. I also drained the tomatoes before adding them because I thought it had enough juice and didn't want to make it too soupy. Will make again.

We liked this. I used 2 fresh tomatoes chopped instead of canned and some frozen corn. I didn't have beef bouillon so just didn't add it- just seasoned it a bit more. Also tasty with some cilantro or parsley added at the end and topped with cheese or sour cream. Still it's a keeper for us

This rates a 5 given the fact it's easy it's low calorie (relatively) it's fast & most important - it's quite tasty. Minor changes based on others' input; added basil oregano garlic powder to the ground beef. Used lean ground. Used 1 can beef boullion instead of cubes. 2nd time - 1 can green beans 1 can sliced carrots 1 can sliced mushrooms 1 can mixed veggies - a little bit of thickener to thicken up the stew. VERY GOOD!

This was yummy! I gave it five stars because both my kids ate it. I omitted the onion though. We served it in bowls and sprinkled parmesan cheese on it. One other thing--I used French-style green beans because they just seemed less chunky.

Perfect for a winter meal. Although I recommend using fresh green beans I could taste that they were canned but if that doesn't bug you the canned worked fine. We also added some canned green chile (which is added to pretty much everything around here) and it came out great!

I loved this recipe and it's a good basic recipe. I used onion powder (because my husband likes the taste of the onion just not the texture) and added a pinch of garlic powder some fresh sweet basil and parsley. I also added more water and boullion cubes to make it more like soup. We sprinkled shredded cheddar on top served it with crusty rolls and it was a winner. Definitely one of my favorite comfort meals! Great for chilly weather too.

A very nice and simple recipe. The bullion isn't really necessary but it took a bit longer than I expected to soften the potatoes. I also added generous amounts of garlic powder pepper and salt.

A very easy but yummy and hearty weeknight dinner recipe! I always add extra spices I like garlic and red pepper flakes mixed in while simmering.

Very yummy. I did season the meat with Mrs. Dash while it was browning and I added 1 clove of fresh minced garlic. I also used 1 cup of a frozen veggie blend instead of the can of green beans. Next time I'll add a little more water or maybe just use 2 cups of beef bouillon. If using the canned green beans I'd add the liquid instead of draining it. But I liked the extra veggies so I'll make it this way again with a little more water.

Really great base, easy to make and nice to use stuff out of my pantry and food storage. It does need a little extra spices in there, but overall a really simple and delicious recipe! My husband craves it when the weather starts to turn colder.

5 Stars is for the basic recipe sorry didn't make as written went by other reviews and added garlic and I used lipton beefy onion soup mix instead of beef bouillon and used about a tbs of seasoning salt (tastefully simple brand) for my spices really really easy to make. Husband loved it.

I love this recipe and my family loved it too. Since one of my sons is very fond of corn I added a can of sweet corn. My husband added some hot peppers to spice it up. A great family recipe!
