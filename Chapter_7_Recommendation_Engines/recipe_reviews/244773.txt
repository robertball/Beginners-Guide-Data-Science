It is great. I changed a few things though. I didn't have oat flour so I just ground up some oats in food processor. And I used all whole wheat flour instead of using bread flour. I also used 1 3/4 tsp yeast, to prevent it from being too dense. I used 6 heaping tablespoons of honey, which probably came out to be closer to 7 tbsp.

I set machine to whole wheat setting, light crust and 2 lb loaf. I also sub coconut oil instead of vegetable.  This bread is a hit every time. Delicious!

This makes a very tasty toast for my morning coffee!  I wish I had a bread machine, but by hand this was pretty easy.  I proofed my yeast with the water and some of the required honey.  While I was waiting for that to get bubbly, I mixed all the dry ingredients.  I mixed in my Kitchen Aid the yeast mixture, all the wet ingredients, and half of the dry ingredients until they were well mixed.  Then I added the rest of the dry ingredients and used the dough beater.  I did finish the kneading by hand.  I let it rise the first time for about an hour and a half in my oven with only the light on before rolling it into thirds, folding it, putting it into a 9x5 pan for the second rise for another hour or so.  I baked it for about 35-40 minutes at 350.  It could maybe have used a few minutes longer.  My granddaughters liked this bread, too!  Thanks, WillowTree!

Didn't have any oat flour so I replaced that with a mix of spelt flour, flax seed flour and quinoa flour

Good bread! I was looking for a recipe to replace the store bought white bread my husband prefers. This just might be it!! I used the 1 1/2 lb setting, so it's a little heavy. We did however, eat a third of it as soon as it cooled enough!
Thank you for posting Willow Tree

I made this the other day for the first time and it was excellent.  Will make it regularly from now on.  I have made many different breads in my bread maker and this was one of the best.

I made this as is.  The oat flour gives it a sweetness.  We all loved it.  It's almost gone. :)

Delicious, moist bread.  My husband loved sandwich made with this.  I will make again.  Used the recipe just as is.  I did have to make my own oat flour.  Loved this bread.

My first experience with my brand new breadmaker, this bread is very delicious maybe not quite salty enough but has a very good flavor. It is a little heavy and dense but still moist and my kids loved it

Was quite disappointed with the final result.  The flavor was overwhelmingly heavy wheat with both a dry and gummy texture.  Couldn't taste the oat or the honey.

Very moist and sweet! I used white whole wheat flour instead of oats and pulled the dough out before the machine baked it. It was very sticky and I put it in a loaf pan and baked it about a half hour at 375.
