This popcorn is a very very delicious, savory snack. For those of you who are not familiar with nutritional yeast, it tastes similar to parmesan cheese and it is very healthy, low-fat, and it has lots of amino acids. It can be found in natural food stores or health stores. I used air-popped popcorn, cut the amount of margarine in half, and it still tasted fabulous! So quick and easy to make. I will be making this often!

This is a great twist on the way I have seasoned popcorn for years. I picked up a great trick years ago that makes it even better. Heat the oil and popcorn together until the first kernel pops. Take the pan off the heat and stir in 2-4 Tbsp. of dairy-free margarine. As soon as the margarine melts put the lid on and put the pan back on the heat. Shake frequently. The buttery flavor will be evenly spread over the popcorn, and the popcorn will pop up large with fewer "old maids".

Pretty darn good.  I did not opt for butter, thinking that the oil alone would hold the seasonings to the popcorn - much of the toppings did end up at the bottom of the kettle, but were again on top when I poured the popcorn into a bowl.  Next time, I will spray some Bragg's on before adding the seasonings and then exclude the salt.  I'm surprised that my 3 year old liked this popcorn, it wasn't too spicy for her.  This popcorn is so rich in flavor that you may find that you don't need to eat a lot of it to feel satisfied. Update: I now make this with air popped popcorn - use Bragg's Liquid Aminos to stick the dry ingredients to the popcorn, leave out the salt and *presto* a dieter's delight!

This was off the charts yummy. I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil only because that was what I had and I did not use the butter only because I'm watching my calorie intake. I also added onion/garlic powder. Even my microwave popcorn loving kids flipped for this. This was just SO good. YUM.

I make this all the time! This is the best popcorn ever! I don't use the butter, and the spices stick just fine from the oil it was popped in. This is such a better alternative to microwave popcorn! Sometimes I add tumeric as well, and today I just added some chipotle powder for a little kick, but the cumin and nutritional yeast (so creamy) are what make it the greatest for me!

I don't think I've ever had popcorn that's tasted better; drizzled with olive oil, then added topping. Mix well!

Quite good. I was a little skeptical at first - Mexican popcorn? - but it doesn't really taste the way I expected. I guess that's the nutritional yeast working its magic. I used air-popped popcorn and half the butter, and it turned out fine. Next time I think I'll add some cayenne for a little heat.

Really enjoyed this popcorn.  Popped up just a half a cup in my air popper and used parmesan cheese in place of the yeast.  Next time I may mix some hot sauce in with the butter for some heat.  Good stuff.  Will make this one again.

Delicious! We were snacking on this all day yesterday.  It wasn't that spicy, even with the chili powder- my kids enjoyed it, too.  I did use the butter- yum!!

Great flavors but I made it exactly as listed and the spices were too much for me (yeast in the bottom of the bowl).  I cut the butter to 3T and spices to 1/2t each and nutritional yeast to 1T.  My kids and I thought it was perfect this time.

I never thought healthy popcorn could taste so good.  It's almost like eating barbeque chips without the guilt. Brewer's yeast is always a great add-on.  This is the only way, besides tomato-based soups, that we have found brewer's yeast to even be mildly palatable.

Originally I was just looking for a popcorn recipe that utilized nutritional yeast, and I found this one.  It is so much more than I expected.  It is now the only way my family wants their popcorn.  Thanks for sharing it!

I had to make this twice. Both times I ended up with brown bits (burnt butter I assume) on my popcorn. The second batch was better b/c I left out the salt. I added powdered cheese and garlic powder. Very tasty even with the brown bits.

This recipe is good without the nutritional yeast.  Most people want some butter/marg on popcorn - it's a taste that is hard to replicate.  Nothing tastes like fat but fat.

This was delicious!  I made it for hockey night mainly for myself because I didn't think my parents or brother would want any, but I ended up having to make a second batch because they liked it so much.  I used an air popper in the microwave, and I just drizzled the popcorn with some olive oil afterwards for some flavor to make the spices stick better.  I used the spices in the recipes and some other random ones I had on hand, like paprika, smokey salt, and Italian herbs.  Thanks a lot!

I made air popped popcorn that I drizzled lightly with light-taste olive oil. I didn't use the chili powder or cumin because I wasn't in the mood for those flavors. Instead, hit the popcorn with a small dash of table salt, then a bunch of freshly cracked pepper and the nutritional yeast.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this - it actually reminds me of mac & cheese!

This was good, but what we especially liked was the nutritional yeast--we now always put this on our popcorn in addition to butter and salt.

This is the BEST popcorn ever, especially if you like a savoury flavour. It reminds a bit of barbecue potato chips. Delicious! I've started mixing up larger batches of the nutritional yeast & spices to keep in my pantry. I also leave out the butter and drizzle a little extra oil so that the spices will stick.

Ok - I was raised on popcorn as an every night treat.  I love the stuff.  This recipe adds flavors I'd never considered with popcorn.  I was already using nutritional yeast and substituting coconut oil for the butter while cooking the popcorn (delicious!!) but the additional savory-ness of the cumin and chili powder?  Yum, Yum, Yum!  I mixed the yeast/spices/salt in a separate container and sprinkled on as much as I wanted.  Still have some left for the next batch.  If you're hesitating...just try it.

This is always good. Changed it up a bit and added onion and garlic powder and salt (after reading reviews). Also used a combo of coconut oil, butter and veg oil. I did drizzle the melted butter. The nutritional yeast really makes it delicious (and healthy too!). Then you can add your seasoning preferences. Great recipe! UPDATE 4/26/15: Sprinkled popcorn with salt and ground pepper (as a reviewer stated) as well as the nutritional yeast. Still cooked in coconut oil and drizzled with butter. Sometimes you just don't want the cumin/chili flavors. This was excellent this way!

well I'm surprised to say I actually really enjoyed that!  Certainly different and not something I would make all the time, but it was nice for a change.  I made it in an air popper and then added the butter at the end (no oil).  Thanks!

The taste was okay, though it didn't do too much for me.  The other problem is that all that yeast, chili powder and cumin ended up on my fingers.  Argh.

This has become a favorite.  I haven't tried the yeast yet.  It is fine with the parm.   Will get some yeast soon. I use my micro popper and a buttry spray for the butter flavor.

OMG!! - cheesy flavor without the cheese are you kidding me!..where has this recipe been all my life.  Next time I will make this with coconut oil as a replacement for the butter.  Anyone who has cooked with coconut oil before knows it has a very similar flavor profile as butter.  The coconut oil as a replacement will make this completely vegan too and I think will be enjoyed by all...these types of recipes are nice to have when you have a mixed crowd of people coming over (ie. meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans).  By the way, I had this for dinner because I had no time to cook.  I quartered the recipe and just seasoned it by taste, no measuring was involved.  Oh and I used onion powder and cayenne pepper instead of chili powder, because there is no Chili powder where I live in Costa Rica.

I was suspicious at first but since I had the ingredients I thought why not. And oh my goodness, it’s delicious! Thank you!

I don't know why everyone thought this was so good. It just tasted "okay." Not nearly as exciting as the ingredients sound.
