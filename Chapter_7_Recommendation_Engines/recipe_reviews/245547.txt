Hi, Allan in Australia.
Time saver version.
I made a flat omelet swiped it with tomato paste, stir-fried ingredients then placed them on the thick omelet, cheese on top and under the griller to brown slightly. My magic Sunday breakfast from now on.

Itâ€™s wonderful!  To make it even better and simpler, I used a bottle of medium chunky salsa in place of making pizza sauce.  Salsa goes much better with eggs.  I also added mini pepperoni pieces for an extra kick and everyone loved it.

When I try a new recipe I always make it the first time the way it is written. This recipe is excellent as is, even my carb loving grandkids loved it. Also anything you can put on a pizza you could adapt to this breakfast pie. I have been looking for new items for low carb breakfasts and this really hit the spot.

This was great! Pretty simple to make, and very nice result. I think the leftovers will heat up nicely for the rest of the week.The only changes I made to the original recipe where that I used a pre-cooked bacon and sausage so it was a little less twerk and I use Jarred marinara sauce instead of going with just pureed tomatoes and spices, simply for convenience.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it as the recipe directed and it turned out really well. The base  was a good texture and not too eggy. It was satisfying enough to substitute for pizza night!
