Very good meatballs! The air fryer is a great way to have the fat drip off the meat.

Delicious! Cooks up exactly as written and are really good. They don't dry out nor fall apart. Any meat works. We've used organic beef, chicken, turkey, and mixes of veal/pork/beef and each cook up soft, tender, and juicy.
