..For being light and easy this had lots of flavor.  I used two skinless, boneless chicken breasts, fresh veggies and jasmine rice. The chicken was really good the next day too..thanks Morton!

My husband requested that I make stir-fry one night. I found this recipe and decided to try it. This meal was wonderful and the flavor is great! The chicken was tender and juicy. We couldn't have had a better meal. My husband loved this dish, and we'll be sure to make it again! It was very easy to prepare too. The hardest part was just cutting the chicken! 5 stars!
