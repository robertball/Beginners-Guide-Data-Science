Very nice recipe! I made a few additions for flavour and heat.  I added 1/4 cup rep pepper and 2 diced jalapeno's, then 1/2 cup hot salsa for that tomato flavour.  I used chicken breasts and baked for 45min taking the cover off for the last 15 mins.  It came out perfect.  The rice was golden and spicy, chicken moist and flavourful.

My girlfriend made this for me and it came out great!  She used pounded boneless breasts and omitted the pimentos.  This is a dish that really tastes like homestyle Spanish cooking.  Thanks!

What a wonderful recipe.  The rice was to die for.  I made this ahead of time then placed it in the oven when my husband came home.  Needs to be cooked longer if you do this.

VERY yummy. I added some more spices for an extra powww. but for the most part my family loved this. I added black beans to the rice and cheddar cheese on top of the chicken and it was veryy veryy good.

Followed it precisely and turned out absolutely wonderful. My wife raved about it and our 2 year old snapped up a lot of the chicken.

This was pretty darned good... I added some cayenne and garlic to the chicken coating, and the rice was to die for! Would definitely make it again. Thanks for the post!

I added some flavours to this as I was in a mood for messing, nothing major just some Cayenne pepper Tobasco and corriander and parsley. This was lovely easy and quick took less than 30 min to put together and I just left it in the oven for 45 min and it was perfect. Just what you want when you get in late from work. Thank you for the great quick recipe. XX

Just made it tonight! yummy!!! I reduced the amount of salt, cut out the peppers, pimento, chili seasoning, black pepper, and halfed the onions for my heartburn sensitive hubby and it still came out delish! :) took a lot longer than stated though. make sure to cook onions till tender b/f adding rice. don't be alarmed by the small amount of rice it'll fluff up to a bigger quantity in the oven. :)

Really great.  Had immense flavor.  I found it a bit salty so I am going to reduce the salt next time.  Family loved it.  Also didn't use the pimentos and green peppers as this is a personal choice.

We LOVE the rice in this recipe, although the chicken was pretty bland. I used about 1 lb. of boneless chicken cutlets, and added 1/2 tsp chili powder to the chicken coating mixture (although it didn't do much good.) Instead of pimientos, I used 1 chopped up jalapeno. When I was adding in the broth, I also added in 1/4 c. of hot salsa. I did leave the dish fully covered. The rice was delicious, but very spicy. I made the rice again a few days later, since it was so good!

This is one of me favorite dishes since I discovered this recipe.  I am a starch lover so I double the recipe for more rice and use a 6-pack of boneless chicken thighs and it is delicious over and over again.

Tasty!  Made essentially according to the recipe, converting to five servings.  No surprises, no complaints.  I don't use a lot of turmeric in my cooking, but had an "old" jar in my spice cabinet.  Upped the turmeric called for, to compensate for my probably stale supply.  Wonder how this would be if I used saffron instead of turmeric (and wonder how much to use....).  Thanks for a great recipe that's easy enough for a week-night supper, but "fancy" enough for guests.

Um, awesome. I made this with chicken thighs, bone in. Subbed cayenne for chilli powder. Also used this crazy 9-grain rice i had, which added about a half hour to the cook time due to the intensity of the grain. Thanks and Yum!

Not what I was expecting from a Spanish Rice. I think the tumeric throws me off a bit.

Yummy winter day comfort food. I doubled the recipe and used BLSL chicken breasts instead as I didn't have any bone-in chicken breast. I also used rice flour instead of all-purpose flour - only because I needed to use up some of the rice flour.  Also, I used boullion instead of chicken broth (didn't have any) and left out the remaining salt. Thank you for this yummy recipe!

Such a simple dish, yet incredibly moist and delicious! This is easy and will be a staple in my recipe rotation.  I had to make due with what I had on hand: dry mustard for the turmeric, and omitted the pimentos.

Great flavor and very easy to fix.  The tumeric adds uniqueness. I increased the serving size to 8 for a family dinner and it was a big hit.

Very good, I substituted curry powder for the turmeric, and used red onions. I will use this again, but will probably season the flour mixture more.

This was delicious! I used boneless/skinless chicken breast and it was so moist it practically fell apart when I cut it. Even my husband devoured it and he won't eat anything with peppers or onions. I will definitely be making this again but next time I will double the recipe!

This recipe make it bland so make it a little more flavorful.  For 3 large chicken breasts (skinless), delete the pimentos and add one can diced tomatoes.  Delete the green pepper (overwhelms the flavor) and add one small red pepper and one small orange pepper.  Gives it great taste and color.  Increase the amount of chili powder and pepper (add after you put it in the skillet) to match the tumeric (3/4 tsp) and use 2-3 cloves of garlic.  I promise it will be the perfect amount of spice.  Finally, use olive oil to give the that extra something.

This is always really good. The taste isn't affected terribly if you use other ingredients (ex. I never use pimientos, but sometimes I'll add canned mushrooms for a twist). This recipe also works well with plain spaghetti, if you don't have any rice. Just cook it separately and use some of the chicken sauce to flavor the spaghetti. :)

I have made this twice. The cook time is extremely off. Took over twice as long. I also upped the temperature and uncovered the dish. THe chicken is flavorless as written.

Delicious and easy! I added carrots and corn to add a little crunch and sneak in some vegetables. I also used a Goya spice packet, a little cayenne pepper, and chopped tomato with green chiles (canned) to jazz up the flavor and add color.

I will make this again with some tweaks. I would recommend using a long grain rice rather than the medium grain rice I used.  I also would recommend using twice the amount of rice and its associated ingredients.  Spices need to be increased especially the chili powder 1/8 tsp isn't enough to give it much flavor.  I agree with prior reviews which said it needed cayenne.  I will skip adding flour/salt/pepper in the beginning and just add salt/pepper.  Breading only made a mushy slime on the outside of the chicken for me.  Excellent concept, will attempt again. Thanks.

Very good. I double everything except for the chicken part and cook it on the stove. I also prefer red bell pepper and use boneless, skinless chicken breast cut in to chunks.

chicken lacked flavor even though I seasoned it and marinaded it. Rice was fantastic though!

I loved the recipe. Had wonderful flavor and texture. I did not have pimentos so I added a little salsa in place of the pimentos. Family did not like it; therefore, I won't be making it very often. I do rate it a five star recipe though.

Made this recipe as is the first time and it was awesome! My adaptation to make it easier is to use bagged frozen bell peppers and a corn-carrot-green bean medley, instead of the separate pimentos. This also works well with bagged frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs poached first. Yummy!

I have made this recipe about three times.  I follow it close to the letter -- using boneless breasts instead of bone-in; using three or four breasts; sometimes adding black beans into the rice mixture -- but, the flavors, the spices, and the method I do not mess with.  The coating and browning on the chicken makes it so tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious -- oh my!  And my husband just raves about the rice.  A new family favorite in our house -- Thanks for sharing, Mrs. Nelms!

I loved this dish! It was very flavorful.  However, when I doubled all the ingredients to feed a family of five, which included doubling the salt, it was way too salty.  I also didn't have turmeric so I used Spanish saffron which worked just as well.  I will definitely make this dish over and over again except I will add less salt.

Awesome recipe! I always make extra servings of rice to munch on between classes. The chicken needs a little more help as it's kind of bland. I will keep making this though and do a little experimenting.

I doubled this recipe tonight for dinner, and it was terrific.  I made it pretty much as written, just switched fresh red bell pepper for pimentos, added a little ground red pepper for some heat, and threw in a handful of sliced black olives.  It was sooo good.  We were full with half of it, and now we have our dinner for tomorrow all made.  We really enjoyed it!!

Very enjoyable!  This was a great stove-top to oven dish.  I decided to add some spices to the flour mixture to give the chicken some flavour as it sounded quite plain.  A very simple dish to prepare, the rice was very tasty - I used chipotle chili powder for my rice and used orange pepper as I was out of green.  A great dish, just that much better with some spices mixed in with the flour to season your chicken!  Definitely worth the try, we really enjoyed!

I love it when a recipe that I don't expect too much from blows me away.  This is so good!  The rice alone is worthy of 5 stars.  I added a little seasoning salt and red pepper to the flour mixture, as some reviews called it bland.  This will become a staple at our house.

This was absolutely delicious! I'm a poor college student, so I used only 1 (boneless) chicken breast, and cut it in half for one serving. I kept the same amount of rice and spices, and it seemed to be the right proportions. I also omitted the pimentos, and didn't feel like I was missing anything. When using only one chicken breast make sure to reduce the cook time to about 30 minutes, otherwise it gets a little dry. Will definitely be making this again!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! The chicken was a little bland by itself but when taken with mouthfuls of the rice, it was perfect! The rice is something I would prepare even if I didn't make the chicken! I loved the ease of the preparation and enjoyed every bite. I cannot wait for leftovers tomorrow!

This is really good! I made this as directed in the beginning and it is delightful. This has become one of my husband's favorite. I don't transfer to a baking dish, just put the chicken back on the rice, cover and simmer 30-40 minutes. I add a cup of frozen peas about 15 minutes before serving. My husband is a very picky eater and it is nice to fix him something I love as well. Thank you!

Excellent - easy and full of flavor!  I made a couple of small changes: basmati rice, because that's what I had on hand, and a sprinkle of paprika on top of the chicken for color. I also needed to add a bit more liquid at around 30 mins in the oven, and then covered to finish cooking.

Rice was excellent! I cooked the rice with the broth and spices then mixed in soft onions and peppers as raw rice in a casserole NEVER cooks for me. Chicken was chicken. I season with heavier S&P then called for.

This was yummy if you made the tweaks suggested.  I used boneless skinless breasts and just browned them with salt & pepper without the flour.  I also added a splash of cider vinegar to the chicken broth for a kick.  I didn't have pimentos so I used bottled roasted red peppers and also substituted dry mustard for the tumeric.  When I put the chicken breasts on the rice before baking I seasoned with more salt, pepper and some hot paprika.  For the baking I put the oven at 400 degrees covered for 40 minutes then 15 uncovered and it was perfect.  My husband and I loved it - it's a keeper.

Just made this tonight, and it was delish. My husband requested to put this in the "regular" meals file. I always try to make the recipe "as stated" first, before I change things, because to me that is not a fair opinion if you change everything in it. But in this case I had to a little (only cuz I didn't have it).  I had to omit the Tumeric (didn't have any), and had to use dried green pepper (again didn't have fresh), but it's so liquid when you put it in the baking dish, you couldn't tell the difference when it was done. The chicken was so tender it fell apart. Next time I might add a little cayenne for a bit of heat. This was so easy and satisfying. I served it along with sweet corn cakes on the side, which really complimented it (in my opinion).

I am pretty sure I did something wrong with this recipe because based on many of the other reviews this dish should have been MUCH better than what came out of my oven tonight.  I did omit the pimentos and am thinking that was a mistake.  There seems to be a level of flavor missing.  My rice was soupy and not cooked all the way through even though I cooked it for the required 45minutes.  One thing I can say is that the chicken turned out super tender.  I will try this recipe again because I can taste the potential.  Next time I won't make such a large portion of it (made it for 6 so I am not sure if that affected the dish)

This was a good recipe.  Fairly easy to make, nothing out of the ordinary. My little one didn't care for the pepper (I used yellow and red instead of green because that is what we had on hand.)

I doubled the recipe, but pretty much made as written and it was delicious.  The chicken was so moist and tender. I like a little zip, so just added some salsa to the rice mixture at the table. It's pretty easy, but does take a bit of time to brown the chicken (I used 10 drumsticks) so wondering if I could skip this step..Still, I know I will make this one again!

Great dish! My husband and his friend loved it and made steak the following night with the leftover rice.

Yummy!  Followed the recipes except no pimentos (didn't have).  Family loved it!  Thanks Mary! Just a note...I live in Perth, Western Australia but was born and raised in Jacksvonille, Florida...small world!

Great Taste!  To simplify the recipe just a bit further I got a tasty store bought whole rotisserie chicken and sliced it up then I combined all of the ingredients into my rice maker and cooked it for the usual amount of time but just used the broth instead of the usual water.  I must say it worked like a charm.  Both the rice and chicken had great flavor.  It was just delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

My wife and I make this a couple times a month. We usually substitute a Spanish rice mix for the spices and use boneless chicken. We double it and have plenty for lunch the next day.

My rice didn't cook properly (mushed on the outside but hard inside) but this was such a tasty dish. The chicken needs more flavor, but it's sooo filling and delicious. The flavor in the rice is so so good.

This was SO yummy!  My 5 year old, who's very picky and only eats about 10 things, loved it!  I  added a little mild salsa and served it with warm tortillas.  I can't wait to make this again!

This is an easy, delicious way to prepare chicken.  The rice was very flavorful and the chicken was tender and moist!   I used the same pot on the stovetop for the browning and sauteeing and then put it right in the oven, which saved a dish.  I also added cumin and chili powder to the flour mixture and did not use any additional salt; the broth is plenty salty.  I think next time I will use a little more rice, as the rice seemed just a little overcooked to me, and I would have liked a bit more rice anyway.  (There was plenty for 2 people, but I like extra.)

I made this last night and it was delicious. I used red peppers instead of pimentos (couldn't find any in the stores here, for some reason). I would add more salt. The dish was tasty but was missing something. It needed a little more flavor. Maybe tomatoes or a little heat. Otherwise, very good dish. I would make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written except I ended up used Cajun seasoning instead of chili powder because I didn't realize I was out til it was too late. I'm nervous about making new recipes because my bf is very picky and chances are he won't like it but he actually said this was very good. I agree but I will add some extra spices to the flour mixture for the chicken next time. Rice was good as is.

Not bad.  I did make some changes because I was worried about it being bland.  Pretty much followed the concept to a T.  Despite adding spices to the chicken it still came out a little bland.  The rice however, was fabulous and I added a can of Rotel (tomatoes with diced green chilies.  Omitted the pimento and used an Anaheim pepper instead of a regular green pepper.  I will make this again, but I am going to play around with the chicken a bit.  Maybe I will try cooking then shredding the chicken first then season and add to the rice next time?  :)  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this with chicken legs and it still came out great.  I can't figure out how they would have browned this in butter so I used olive oil.  The rice was wonderful! Will make again.

This is delicious.  My husband requested that I make this one over again, most times he puts up with me cooking random never tasted meals.  I too put the chicken back in the pot with the rice as it finished steaming, not bothering too bake it in the oven.  Less dishes is always a goal, and this worked wonderful for me.  The seasonings are unique but tasted like a great home cooked meal, but turned up a notch.

Followed the original recipe. Turned out very tasty, just the rice was a bit mushy for my liking. Next time I will use a little less water.

Fantastic! Just made the rice portion-- so flavorful! I believe it's imperative to use a home made chicken broth--it makes the recipe! I used the broth from my Guatamalen chicken tamale mix.

Cooked this last night but was a bit wary of how it would turn out. I shouldn't have worried as it was superb. I'm now eating the leftovers for lunch! I added 1/2 teaspoon of Paprika and the same of Oregano. Also I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast as it tends to have more flavour. Will definitely be cooking this again. Thanks!

This recipe was delicious. I cooked for the very first time ever, and this is what I chose to make. I made it for my girlfriend and she loved it!!! I used all the ingredients and did everything the way the recipe did. I didn't add turmeric because i couldn't find it when it was time to cook. This is perfect. It wasn't difficult at all, but the taste was great. I will definitely make this again

The flavors in this dish are very nice.  I browned the chicken in a Dutch oven, then mixed everything else into the same pot and stuck the whole thing in my coventional oven to cook.  This method worked quite well for a tasty "one-pot" meal.

This was excellent.  I used skinless chicken thighs and "sofrito" which is just a mixture of garlic, onion, tomatoes, red peppers etc. You can find a good sofrito recipe on Daisy Cooks website.  I sauteed the sofrito and added a little tomato sauce and goya sazon instead of the tumeric.  I also added alcappardo, which is just olives, capers and pimentos.

This was a very good base recipe to start with. I found it to be very bland, but there is a lot to work with as the basic flavors are very nice. Next time I will add some herbs and perhaps some cayenne for a little kick. I'll definitely this make again.

Excellent, excellent recipe.  I didn't change a thing (except but in fewer green peppers because my kids turn their noses up at them.)  The flavor is wonderful, and all 5 kids and husband LOVED it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good - and easy to make...I didn't have green peppers on hand, so I used one roasted pepper and threw in some celery.  It came out great - also, instead of seasoning the chicken with salt, I used poultry seasoning.

I enjoyed this dish.  During preparation - there was not a lot to cook the onion, pepper, and garlic in (maybe I used very low fat chicken which leaves almost no drippings?).  So, I added some of the chicken broth early, and it seemed to work ok.

Yummy!!!!! I made this dish tonight and it was great. I used red peppers instead of the green and left out the pimentos. It was just as good as from the restaurant.

I tried this dish tonight and it was a big hit.  I used a chicken breast that was quatered and added a diced up red pepper plus a diced up chile pepper.  When it came out of the oven with the various colors and golden chicken breast it looked great.  The blend of flavors made for a great meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
