This has always been one of our favorites, especially when the corn is fresh.  I use red pepper instead of green and add alittle garlic to the saute.  Yummy!

I like this better with red pepper. I use a whole large red pepper. Really good. Even my kids like it. Could be because it has bacon........;)

This recipe was easy to make although a bit too greasy. It was very tastey although next time I will remove the bacon grease from the pan before finishing the recipe.

My husband has been making this for years.  He uses red onion, a chopped jalapeno, and a dash of a secret ingredient (famous in Lincoln, NE) Yummy!

I doubled the recipe to use as a side dish for 9 people - definitely enough!

I found the end result to be a bit greasy, next time I'll dump 1/2 the bacon grease and leave just enough to coat the pan.

I would also like to add more flavor to this dish.  Some of the versions I read called for Seasoning Salt.  I added Lawry's Seasoned Salt in addition to salt and pepper, but next time I'll go a little heavier. 

Overall - not my all time favorite, but a good dish to accompany corned beef and cabbage (see slow cooker recipe for an easy meal!)

The flavor was wonderful.  I felt the bacon took away nutritional value, but it as really very tastey.

Tastes great, it's healthy and simple to prepare.  My kind of side dish.  I did use more onion and bell pepper though, maybe a half cup of each.

I liked this fine although my husband did not care for this dish much. He did eat all of his though. I used bacon bits instead of raw bacon and added some butter for the grease the bacon would have added. This was okay but it seemed to need something else like cayenne or some kick to it.

I made a version of this when I was younger. Substituted butter for bacon grease and added grated cheddar cheese and canned chopped tomatoes. My grandmother won a blue ribbon for this recipe at the senior cook off.

I used chorizo instead of bacon. Added a touch of spiciness. Also added shredded carrots. Used only the salt for seasoning. Needed additional spices/herbs to bring out the total flavor.

Very, very good, but I substituted green beans and carrots sticks for the green pepper and pimento. Delicious.
