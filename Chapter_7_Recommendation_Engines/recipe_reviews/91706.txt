OMG!  These are sooo good!  I have a real fondness for most magic cookie bars, because I love the combo of the graham crackers, butter, coconut and sweetened condensed milk, and these bars are no exception!  The only change I made was to pour on the SC milk AFTER layering all of the other ingredients, rather than before.  The milk acts as a binder, so when you cut the bars, they hold together well.  Delicious recipe!!!

These were delicous and so easy to make.  My kids could not get enough.  My only change would be to chop the cherries a little bigger the next time I make them.  Thanks

I made these twice and both times they tasted wonderful but I did have trouble with the bars falling apart the first time.  I used a generic sweetened condenced milk the first time.  Using Eagle brand did make a difference and I let them cook an extra minute.  I think next time I will make them more in advance and chill them so they cut cleaner.

These are fantastic - a new Christmas favorite for us!  
I used about 1/2 of the sweetened condensed milk on the crust and reserved the rest to pour over the other toppings to help them stick together better - I hate cookies and bars that crumble all over.

Oh. My. Goodness. Gracious. One of the best seasonal cookies I've ever had. I swear to you. I used extra dark chocolate chips and cinnamon grahams. In. Sane. This is going to be dangerous. NOTE: I did take a couple of the other reviewers advice and increased the graham crackers to 3 cups and I poured the condensed milk at the last, over the whole pan. I think that really made the most of this recipe. I think had I not done that, they would not have been as good. As a seasoned "magic cookie bar" maker, I do not recommend using an off-brand of sweetened condensed milk. I think this would be good with chocolate grahams, too.

Pretty good. I made twice. The second the time  I used chopped dried cherries instead of the maraschino cherries, they added a nice balance of real cherry flavor and a hint of tartness to the rich sweetness. I also found pouring the sweetened condensed milk over the whole thing, and they held  together better. Also found using an 8x8 pan delivers a thicker more substantial cookie.

Yum.  These will really look festive during the holidays with red and green cherries.  To the others who have reviewed this recipe, thanks for the helpful suggestions.

Anything you drwon in sweeten milk will taste good. But the cookies fall apart and are hard to eat. The gram craker crust need to be thicker. Probably double what it calls for. And it's missing texture. Prob chopped pistachios would help to finish up this recipe.

This was very very good. I don't think they'll store for as long as the original Magic Bars as they are a little more moist but I haven't been able to test out this theory as they are gone within hours!

Whats not to like? Cherries, chocolate, coconut, grahams...all the food groups!!! Seriously, I've been making the standard magic bars for years (narry a complaint) and these are just a natural modification. The only changes I made are: 2 cups of grahams (I like a slightly thicker crust), half of the can of sc milk is reserved for the final topping, and I use approx. 14 oz of cherries...I have never had them last more than 48 hrs, as nobody can seem to eat just one!!!

this may have turned out badly for me because i inadvertently skipped over the step of patting the cherries dry with a towel. but, i ended up with a very soggy, goopy mess that would not stay in bar form. (this was after taking everyone's advice to pour the milk over the entire dish, not just the crust.) i also found this to be much too sweet. however, that also could be partially my fault because i substituted white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet. overall though, i wouldn't make this again.

I love these so much that now when I make magic cookie bars, I do half the pan with cherry and half regular! Nice change since there is just two of us in the house.

These tasted good, but they were oh so messy. It was very difficult to cut them and it ended up looking awful. But we still enjoyed the flavors- definitely very sweet. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe...I checked out some of the other reviews and took their advise.  I used 3 cups of graham crumbs,  put half of the condensed milk on it, added the other ingredients and then poured the remainder of the milk over top of everything.  I chilled it before cutting and it was perfect.

We love magic cookie bars and the addition of Cherries made it even better. My husband doesn't like cherries so I left half without cherries but i thought it made the bars better.

I just thought these were OK. They were too thin and didn't hold their own weight very well. We had to eat them from a bowl with a spoon. Not sure if I will try these again or not.

I made this for a cookie exchange and was pleased how easily they went together.  Unfortunatly they never cooked properly and ended up as mush after baking an extra 15 minutes.

Tasted ok but way to messy to eat would not make this again.
