I've made this dish for years -- a favorite with family and guests.  But I use a good flavored Jarlsburg cheese, a pinch of tarragon, and 1/2 c. or more of white wine.  I also keep it covered with foil for the first 30 mins. so the bread doesn't dry out.

I forgot to rate this and have made it 3 -4 times now.  I added an additional can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream in the soup mixture, 1/2 tsp of mild curry, 4 green onions, 1 tsp of garlic.  I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss...and steamed broccoli slightly cooked before adding the soup mixture.  This is a great casserole even though I changed some things.  I covered for the 1st 30 mins...then took the foil off for the last 30mins. Thanks for posting such a great recipe!!

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I would use cream of chicken next time, the cream of mushroom overpowered I think.  I also covered the pan with foil for first 30 minutes.  I will defenitely make again.

This was good and simple to make.  I addded about a tablespoon of sour cream to the soup and used a box of Stove Top stuffing (savory herb flavor.)  I recommend covering it for the first 20-30 minutes of baking, and it did not take an entire hour to bake, more like 40 minutes.

This is so good.  Wonderful flavors and the house smelled great.  I would cut back on the stuffing mix though.  Thought there was too much of it.  But I'm not a stuffing kinda girl.

I've made several chicken n stuffing recipes lately & this was definitely the least interesting.  Not bad, but not as good as some others.  I thought it was WAY too much stuffing, which overpowered the whole thing, and I couldn't taste the soup or cheese either one.  All I really tasted was plain chicken w/plain stuffing.  It might be better with cream of chicken since that has a stronger flavor.

The taste was great. I will make it again, HOWEVER, I will add an extra can of soup and maybe some more stuffing to make it a little more "stick to your ribs" type meal. We served it with corn on the cob and it was peeeeeerfect!

I am not the cook of the family, my mom is. So when she came to live with me I was hoping this recipe would impress her. She really liked it, everyone did! It was a hit and will be made in my house again!

DELICIOUS! I only gave it 4 stars because I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom (no one in my family likes mushrooms) I mixed a little sour cream with the cream of chicken, baked covered for 30 minutes, uncovered for 30 minutes. SO good!

I didn't use cheese, because I didn't have any Swiss on hand.  It's quick and super easy to throw together.

Not bad.  I added two cans of soup, 1/3 cup of sour cream, and broccoli.  Next time I would just use one of the cans of soup but all the other additions. Family liked it.

Can't be beat! My family really enjoyed this dish. As others have said I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and used cornbread stuffing, covered for all but the last 15 minutes allowing the stuffing to brown. I also added extra cheese which we thought made it creamier. It was so good we will definitely be making this a keeper at our house.

This was great!  I made it on a Monday though so I hope that's okay.  Lol I did substitute the cream of mushroom for cream of celery to kind of go with the celery in the stuffing.  I also did add the white wine as another reviewer suggested and it gave it a great taste.  This was definitely a winner, winner chicken dinner!!

Very tasty but made some changes.  After reading the reviews that it was to much stuffing I only used half and it was NOT enough so don't change that. I made the stuffing with onion, celery and parsley. I also used breast meat but also some leg meat and it complemented each other. Very good, will make again.

While this recipe may be just "ok," you can add a little cooking sherry to the cream of mushroom, and fresh cremini mushrooms under the stuffing to give this dish a very rich, gourmet taste. With these added ingredients, this is one of my FAVORITE meals!

I have been trying different stuffing and chicken recipes lately, and I did this one last night. I used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, and I found that one can wasn't enough sauce, so I used 2. I also added a layer of green beans between the cheese and the soup sauce (one can of the French-cut, drained). If I had rated this last night, I would have given it only 3 stars, but as leftovers, it was really terrific. Maybe sitting overnight helped the flavours meld...?

We made this on a Sunday :) we used the mushroom soup and it wasn't overpowering at all, in fact I threw in a few mushrooms.  I didn't have swiss so I used gouda and prevelone.  Really you can use whatever cheese you like and it will come out fantastic!

Great tasting. Easy to make. I cut the chicken into 1" cubes. Definitely need to cover for first 30 minutes. Then I bake uncovered for another 20 minutes.

My family loved it!  I did cut the stuffing mix down a little, so it baked into the chicken and gravy more and followed the others suggestions with the foil over the top.  I will make again.

This recipe was GREAT!!! My whole family of 5 loved this.  I did use the cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom soup, like someone suggested.With the chicken cut up into bite size pieces, I only cooked it 40 minutes and it was fine. I did cover the pan with foil for the first 30 minutes like numerous people suggested.  We will definitely make this again. Thanks Amy.

Easy, good and followed the tip of covering for the first 30 mins. I'm a new fan :)

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD. I USED FROZEN CHICKEN BREASTS SO THE BAKING TIME WAS A BIT LONGER. I DIDNT HAVE SWISS CHEESE SO I USED CHEDDAR. THE STUFFING GOT A BIT CRUNCHY BUT ONCE YOU MIXED IT WITH THE SOUP IT WAS FINE.
