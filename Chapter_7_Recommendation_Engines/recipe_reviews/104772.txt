I made this and it was FABULOUS.    I am considering making this with other mixes such as Lemon Supreme.  I understand the confusion with the 'glaze', they called it something it is NOT.  This technique is used to make dessert cakes that are soaked with some kind of liquor/spirit. By all means adjust the rum if you want (it's your cake) but try to pour all of the 'soak' over the cake(remember, it is NOT a glaze). It is supposed to be a 'wet/moist' cake.   Also, using a Bundt style pan doesn't help because the liquid just runs over the sides instead of going into the cake, even if you make the holes.  These things will help: 1) Using one of the traditional pans where the bottom is flat (the top when you invert it) so that the liquid goes through better. Another thing that works also, no matter which mold you use: 'unmold' the cake, wait until the pan and the cake cool enough, line the pan with plastic Wrap and return the cake to it. Then pour the liquid over the cake bottom (having made holes in it). Once the liquid is all absorbed, wait about 10 min and unmold.  2) Making this the day before so that all the flavors and textures blend nicely.  3) Not cooking the liquid just until the sugars are dissolved, but simmer it a little bit longer. 1 minute more in med heat is fine. This eliminates some of the 'bite' of the rum because the alcohol evaporates. But don't overcook the liquid because you could end up with burnt sugar :-).

I used yellow cake mix,added about a cup of pineapple tidbits and added about a half cup of rum to the cake mix. It was wonderful!

The cake part of this came out fine.  An interesting way to treat a cake mix.  But I fear there is something wrong with the recipe for the glaze.  Is it really "1 cup of rum"?  I prepared it as written and ended up with a very rummy liquid, not a glaze at all.  Did the author perhaps mean 1/4 cup?

The only thing I would stress is to make multiple holes with a wooden skewer so that the rum is evenly distributed.  The more rum taste in every bite the better.

I made this for a fourth of july party, and it tasted okay. Everyone who had it felt there wasnt enough rum taste inside the cake, and too much in the bottom. If I make it again, I might make it two round pans instead of a bunt pan. I'll also put less sugar in the rum mixture, because it was too sweet.

One reviewer said this is not (technically) a pound cake, well maybe that's true. But it looks, feels, tastes, smells and goes down like pound cake! No it doesn't have a glaze either--it's a soaking syrup, but it's a wonderful soaking syrup so who cares what it's called? To get the moisture where it should be in the cake, after you remove the cake from the oven let it cool in pan about 20 minutes. Gently remove the cake and set aside. Pour the sugar/rum/butter syrup into the bottom of the Bundt pan and then place the cake back into the pan. Let it sit 20-30 minutes, and then turn the Bundt pan, cake still in it, upside down onto a plate to unmold. BTW, I skipped the coconut and instead added a 20-oz can of crushed, DRAINED pineapple to my syrup so that the cake turned out like pineapple upside down cake. It was a huge hit--moist, poundcake-like, and not too sweet or rummy (I used 1/2 c rum). I will use this basic recipe (without syrup) from now on for a quick and easy, start-from-a-box, tastes-like-homemade pound cake.

Wonderful cake, I let the glaze cook a little longer and it turned out real glazy, I don't like wet cake.  I also used white cake mix instead of yellow. But over all this a very good cake.

Excellent! I skipped the rum glaze on this one and just made a standard powdered sugar glaze that I thought my 9 yr. old would like better. Make sure to beat this well before stirring in your sour cream, batter should be light and fluffy & double in bulk, if not you may have problems with this one falling. I had more than enough batter for a standard size bundt pan and made a nice size loaf cake with left over batter. Moist, rich, & delicious, we really loved this one! Thanks!

I can understand the confusion about the glaze. But, it is intended to be a wet cake. I made this with bourbon and had rave reviews. I used bourbon according the recipe because that was on hand. The only person who did not like the cake was a non drinker.

We all loved this cake!  I only had 2/3 cup of rum so I used Pina Colada Mix for the rest of the rum.  The glaze was very runny and I have decided next time to use only what I can pour on the cake and save the rest to pour on individual pieces after they have been cut.  I also put in pineapple tidbits in the glaze.

Couldn't  believe the excess amount of rum in this cake. Thank goodness I didn't pour all of it on (really hated to waste that good rum though) Really made a rich cake, otherwise.

Made this for this years Christmas party and got rave reviews for it.I personally felt it was too much rum.Would use less the next time.I also garnished it by putting a can of drained pineapple cubes around the bottom and in the center of the cake.Looked very pretty.

This is a delicious cake, however, instead of removing the cake from the pan prior to using the glaze, pour the glaze  over the cake while it is in the pan & let it soak into the cake for a while & then remove the cake onto your cake plate.  Gently loosen the cake around the edges of the pan as  you pour it on.

You can't call a cake a pound cake just because you bake it in a bundt pan. This was a very delicious cake, but it lacked the density of a pound cake.

Great recipe. Made this for one of manager's birthday. everyone in the office loved it and it was so easy to make. I did not change any of the directions. However I did have to keep it in the oven for longer then the time given.

Apology...did not use the glaze so this review is on the cake.  Very nice bundt cake.  The crown after baking is amazing therefore, next time I make this it will be in a tube pan.  I will also use 1/2 cup of additional butter instead of 1/2 cup of oil.  Cake was kind of fluffy, not dense like a pound cake.  Nice flavor!  Thanks.

What a great receipe.  Even though it was a lot of rich ingredients it tastes very light.  You can use absolutely any flavor cake mix and it will turn out great.  Next time instead of the Rum-Glaze (a little strong) I will serve with whipping cream, ice cream or my own glaze.

served to a family gathering 12/2006, it was enjoyed by all, men & women. The glaze was a little runny, did not use all, but it did not affect the texture or taste.  Delicious and I'm making 2 more this weekend for other parties.

This was great. I allowed it to cool in the pan, then I removed it but put it back into the pan. Made my holes and poured the glaze. I then let it sit for 1 1/2 hours. The cake soaked up the entire glaze

The cake itself was great but I found the rum glaze was a little too overbearing. Only poured half of the rum mixture over the cake and it was fine.

I've used this several times and gotten raves from everyone who ate it. It's my go to recipe for pound cakes in general. I have used brownie mix and added chocolate chips in place of the pineapple cake mix, to make a mean chocolate brownie pound cake. Als when using the brownie mix I add a teensy bit of baking soda and baking powder. Also have a version of a carmel pond cake I made using this recipe as a basic

SUPER HIT!
I made it without the coconut... Also my bundt pan was smaller so I just didn't fill it and then cooked it for less time but still followed the rule of bounce back with your thumb...I poked holes with a knife all over the top and bottom and poured the rum mixture very slowly.. It was a major hit.   All the boys loved it lol.  When I make it again next time, the only thing different I will do is make even more of the rum mix and figure out how to get it on the sides.    I'm thinking, if you let it congeal you could spread it on the side... just a thought.  this will be one of my party go-to crowd pleasers from now on... and... soooo easy

Great recipe. I didn't want a 'soak cake' I wanted a glaze, so I altered the topping - instead of rum, I used a 6 oz can of pineapple juice and approximately  1/4 cup of confectioner sugar. I let the mixture boil until it thickened. I also added about 1/2 cup of frozen pineapple (thawed and mashed).  ironically,my co-workers thought the topping tasted like rum. .

Easy, delicious. I made two loaves, rather than one large cake. I made half of the glaze recipe and only topped one. Both were great.

This cake came out great, though I did not use the rum glaze. I made a basic powdered sugar glaze with almond extract. Everyone loved it. And I will make it again using different flavored cake mixes.
