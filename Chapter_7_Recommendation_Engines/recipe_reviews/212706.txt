This was the very first 2-crust (covered) pie I ever made (please don't laugh!), and so I forgot to vent the top...  Naturally, it blew-up while baking and looked like it was mailed from Beirut when it came out of the oven!  Even with my mid-oven pyrotechnics, it was absolutely delicious!  I'll try again in a few weeks with my new-found respect for venting and see what happens!  The flavor was just awesome, and it wasn't difficult to make the caramel portion at all.  Thanks for a fab recipe!

OMG!  The title of this pie was intriguing.  The taste... sublime!  My DH says he's never had better.  The instructions were very clear and easy to follow.

WOW! I really enjoyed this pie. I have made at least 10 apple pie recipes from this site and my husband said it's the best pie I ever made. I skipped the lemon juice soak and just added my bare sliced apples. I also added pecans. Great! Thanks a lot!

Absolutely outstanding!  I discovered I was out of dried cranberries, so used 1-1/4 c. chopped frozen cranberries.  I increased the brown sugar by an extra 2 tablespoons to compensate for the extra tartness.  Other than that, no changes.  This recipe is a real keeper!

I made this pie for dessert tonight, with a couple of changes.  I decreased the amount of butter to 6 tablespoons and used 1 1/2 cups of fresh cranberries.  Because I did not use dried cranberries, I did not introduce additional source of sugar to the filling, and the sweetness turned out to be just right for my taste and for my husband's.  My husband and I found the pie to be excellent and it will definitely be a staple in our holiday table!

My family adored this pie -I made it with a crust from this site as well; pie crust IV, with half whole wheat flour.  I tripled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 pan, turned out wonderful!  Sweet caramel with tart apples and buttery crust, throw in the cranberries for extra flavor.  Excellent!

I baked this pie last night as our "test" pie to bring to Thanksgiving dinner next week and OMG it's SOOO GOOD!  In reading other reviews I prepped myself to be prepared for it to be a little overly sweet but it wasn't.  Perfect to my sweetness liking! I used Craisins and Granny Smith and stuck to the recipe and the hub and I loved it!

Okay so I didn't use this recipe but threw one together myself when I ended up with leftover apple pie and cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving.  The result was delicious and I recommend this recipe as had I had this to follow I am for sure it would have been an even bigger hit.  Great way to "recycle" holiday left overs.

crazy great pie! wife and i made this for bird day. i wanted something different from a plain apple pie. yep, this was the choice. caramel, granny smith apples, and cranberries. can you go wrong? NO. try it, seriously great stuff. serve left-overs (if any) with whipped cream or vanilla ice-cream. don't overlook this one.

wonderful pie recipe  i made for thanksgiving dinner.  I had looked at so many pie recipes that i got my ingrediant list confused, one recipe had called for brandy and i thought why not since i had bought it anyway, so i added to the cooking sugar mixture (i dont measure usually so not sure how much i put in).  It tasted great.  Brandy may turn out to be my "secret" ingrediant.  I may have a pie that can stand up to my husbands grandma's apple pie.

What a Beautiful pie emerged from the oven! I only needed about 1/2 of the topping to achieve a nice result. We were snowed in, so I could not get out for the Granny Smith's... Using Gala apples probably gave the pie a slightly sweeter taste. As we love cranberries, I used a 50/50 combo of dried & whole fresh berries. This recipe was a refreshing change and has definitely earned a spot in the regular rotation.

LOVE this apple pie, best one I've ever made, and I've made a lot!  I added 2 extra apples, but otherwise the recipe is good as is. I imagine if you have the time, homemade crust would really put this over the edge.

I've made this pie 4 times now. It's superb.  I make it exactly as the recipe says and it turns out perfect. I set the pie pan on a preheated pizza stone in the oven to bake and that sets the filling.  I receive the best compliments on this pie.

Wow!  This pie filling is amazing!  I didn't have vanilla so I substituted caramel extract, otherwise wouldn't have modified.  Definitely going to be my go to for apple pie.

I made the apple pie for the first time in my life, and it turned out to be so delicious!  I would love to make it again with less cranberries.  I had one problem, which the pie baked too much though I set the time less for the first and second temparature.  My oven is quite strong, so I reduce some minutes when I bake anything.  I would appreciate if anybody could give the advice for this.

Delicious!! I did use fresh cranberries rather than dried. I would use fresh again because I don't really see how the pie could have been any better!.  They were on sale for Thanksgiving and I figured "why not?". 
My family was very disappointed when it was all gone and refills for Christmas have already been requested.

Made this pie for Thanksgiving.  It was super yummy and was a hit!!! I didn't make any major changes except to add a little ground cloves and to do an egg wash over the crust.  Great recipe!!

Delicious recipe. I made 5 pies (2 pumpkin, 1 Apple, 1 mixed berry, and this one) for Thanksgiving and this was the first to go! Everybody grabbed a slice of this for their first slice, I was wishing I would have made 2. I followed the recipe as is, only difference is I didn't have lemon juice somehow, so I just put the sliced apples in ice water and that worked fine. 
Highly recommended, will make this recipe again for Christmas!

Everyone absolutely loves this pie! I tripled the recipe (going to a family reunion). I used red delicious because I needed to use them up before going bad. It was great, I'm sure to try with the granny smith.

I made this the other day as written and it was very good, all the proportions are right on.  The dried cranberries plump up during baking and add a really nice touch to the pie.

TOTALLY Awesome - could have been the stick of butter in the filling (I'm thinking of cutting that back next time over the protests of my husband, but if it sacrifices taste, then I won't - I'll just serve smaller portions) and the secret ingredient has to be the vanilla in the filling.  My 22 yr old son even noticed that.  This is a keeper!

The pie was good, no not just good, very good, but had a few too many cranberries for my taste(and I do like dried cranberries). If I add them next time I will cut the quantity to 1/2 cup. Great w/ice cream as my husband will attest. He ate almost the whole pie.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving.  I omit the cranberries since not everyone likes them but other than that I follow the recipe with no changes.  The caramel sauce really is a nice touch and makes it better than an ordinary apple pie.

Wonderful pie. I made it for a pie contest at my college group's harvest party and won second place (one of the judges didn't like cranberry) but everyone else loved it. I think it's a little on the sweet side for my liking so I might cut back on the sugar since I used crasins for the dried cranberries.

Found a new favourite apple pie! Did it a little differently -- left out the cranberries and used six smaller Granny Smith apples instead. It was awesome! Don't forget to use the sugar and cinnamon on the crust as it truly finishes it off beautifully!

I won a bake-off at the office with this pie!  Only change was leaving out the cranberries (didn't have them).

I make a lot of different kinds of pies and especially apple, and this has to be one of the best.  Since thanksgiving is approaching, I wanted to try something new and so I made a test pie last night.  Needless to say, this will be at the top of my dessert list.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T, except instead of putting cinnamon on TOP of the crust I just brushed on some softened butter and did the sugar. I read another comment saying the cinnamon on top made the pie look dirty and I wanted to avoid that. The crust was AMAZING, the whole pie was just perfect, it looked great and tasted great, I LOVE the apple and cranberry combination. This was the biggest hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I think it was a a lot better the next day. Easy to make. I did all the prep the night before and then popped it in the oven that morning. Will make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit with my family! I will definitely make this again. (I used store bought pie crust and it was still delicious.) I had to add about 1/2 cup of water to the sauce because it was just too thick, but was still fantastic and was not runny at all. Caution, it ran over in my oven, so place a cookie sheet under the pie plate.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was a HUGE hit.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out great.  I did do the lattice top so that venting would not be an issue.  My only suggestion is to have the ingredients pre-measured and ready to add while at the stove.  It comes together fast.

It made the house smell so good while it was baking and tasted even better. It is a sweet pie so you can cut back on the sugar a bit if you like. I think I will add two more Apple's next time I make it.  I did add two tablespoons of spiced rum when I removed the Apple mixture from the heat.

Made this for our church Thanksgiving pie social. It was not a hit. Even though it was labeled Caramel Cranberry Apple Pie, the cranberries looked like raisins, which does not look appetizing in an apple pie. (All the pies were cut up and served on plates). Also, because I sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on the top crust as the directions say, the cinnamon made the pie look burnt or dirty. I think overall the flavor of the pie was fine, it was more aesthetic problems, and I made a pretty pie. I didn't make the lattice top, instead I cut out about 30-40 small maple leafs out of the dough and laid them on top in a pattern, leaving room for the filling to bubble up. I got lots of compliments on that. So, if you are going to make this pie, my biggest recommendation would be to add the extra cinnamon to the apples, not to the top crust. I would still sprinkle the sugar on the top, which is what I do to all of my covered fruit pies. I think the cinnamon on the top was the biggest issue, with the cranberries looking like raisins being the 2nd.. I personally think a regular apple pie is still better than a caramel cranberry apple ; I will be sticking to my go-to apple pie recipe from "The Joy Of Cooking."

This is a fantastic pie and the results are professional quality.  We often buy the frozen pies that are sold as fundraisers and this pie is just as good as any of those.  WOW!

2nd time used deep dish crust and pie was flat on top.

I made it exactly as directed and it was wonderful.  The apples were tender but not mushy, and the flavor was the nicest combination of sweet and tart. I was curious to see whether it might be a bit sweet for my taste but it wasn’t. I will definitely make again and I may decrease the vanilla slightly (by a quarter or half teaspoon) as there was a high note of vanilla in the flavor. And though I love vanilla, I’m wondering whether the apples will sing a bit louder without so much. All in all, this is one of the best recipes I’ve found on the internet.

This was a great recipe the only change I made was I used fresh cranberries instead of dry I added about a cup and I mixed a few tablespoons of sugar with the cranberries first and then added them to the apple mixture and the end result was delicious! The sourness from the cranberries and apples with the sweetness from the caramel sauce was just right! Will def make again in the future

Only 4 stars to start ‘cause it’s till in the oven, so more comments after we taste it. Thusfar, the apple mixture tastes wonderful. I was surprised that there was no salt, but followed without it and didn’t think it needed it when I sampled. Prepared the apples as per King Arthur recipe, i.e., soaked sliced apples in hot (160 F) cider (rather than adding lemon)for ten minutes. Also used fresh cranberries (1cup) rather than dried. Note to self: remember not to use the crust shield until the pie has set up; it flattens out the crimped edge while the dough is warming initially ??.s

Awesome!! This deserves a VERY HIGH FIVE! The consistency and color was beautiful. Flavor was incredible. My only substitutions: I used Gala apples, they were on special at the grocery. And 1 and1/2 Cups of frozen whole cranberries. Whirl berries in food processor with the 2Tbsp. sugar called for; not all the berries have to be chopped. Add this to the caramel mix with the apples. I love this pie.

Best pie at Thanksgiving and Cranberries add a tang.  Used honey crisp apples and next time may try to cut sugar with some Stevia

Great recipe. The brandy made a big difference. I also added chopped walnuts.

I'm a big fan of apples and have made dozens of apple desserts over the years - but this recipe is one of the best ever. The combination of apples, cranberries, and caramel is incredible! I'd cut the sugar just a bit next time, and maybe add another apple to ramp up the fruit factor.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I liked the variation of adding dried cranberries. They plumped up nicely in the pie and gave it a little tartness.  I may add one more apple the next time and try fresh cranberries and pecans.  Would love to see what a little Capt. Morgan's would do to this baby as one reviewer suggested. :-)

I know that the intention is to have caramel but I feel as though the recipe would have been better with less butter and sugar because it made it really sweet. Other than that I loved the pie and the idea to put in cranberries was wonderful!

The author said, "She was thinking about entering it in a contest"...Defiantly she should.  The filling of the pie is the best apple pie I've ever had.  A must make again!

This was very easy and tasted so good!  I added an extra apple.  The dried cranberries plump up nicely and reminded me of cherries.  Great recipe even for a novice pie maker like myself.

Tasted very good. My apples were very large so I reserved some and served it with ice cream while waiting on the pie to cook. Yum!

A huge hit!  I will definitely be making this again, just the right mix of tart and sweetness.  I made it exactly as written, and it turned out wonderfully.

My fiance made this pie and I helped but he did most of the work. We added caramel squares in the filling just before baking and used fresh frozen cranberries instead of dried cranberries which gave it a nice tart flavor mixed into the sweet apple filling. The filling was too runny before baking the pie as well as after it was baked. It needed more cornstarch than 2 tbsp,  alot of pie filling recipes call for 1/4 cup of cornstarch, so we will add more cornstarch next time .... even with the runny filling, this pie was extremely delicious. Fantastic job to my fiance!!

Loved this pie, so did hubs. I had Honeycrisps on hand, so I used them (5) rather than the granny smiths. I used 1 cup of fresh cranberries, rather than the craisins. Everything else, I followed exactly. What a delicious recipe. 

I was surprised the directions did not mention to Vent the Crust  -- some novice pie makers might not know how to do this.

Loved the smell it gave to the house.  This was a good pie, but next time we'll use a deep dish because we had a mess from spill over. We also took others suggestion & used fresh cranberries which we will continue to do.   I was thinking the "carmel" was an actual carmel type taste, but it is from the brown sugar & liquid together.  A little disappointed about that, but now that I know it is no big deal.  This pie is sweet but with the right amount of tartness to it. Will make again for sure.

Thank you for such a delicious (and simple) recipe! Apple pie is one of my favorite things about this time of year, and this was a welcome variation. If you're looking for something new for Thanksgiving or just to celebrate fall flavors, give this pie a try. I made it for our small group Bible study tonight and it was a hit. I followed the recipe as written except peeling  and slicing more apples until my empty pie plate was heaping before I started. They fit back in the pie shell nicely after simmering with the caramel, and after baking I still had a level flat pie. The extra apples kept this from being too sweet for our tastes, but it did of course then take longer to bake than the recipe calls for. I would suggest having everything ready and pre-measured before starting the caramel as it all comes together quickly, and I rolled out my pie crusts and prepped  them while the filling cooled down enough. I will certainly make this again.

Been making almost this exact recipe for decades. I use orange zest and replace the sugar with red hots.
