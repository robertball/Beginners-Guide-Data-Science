This hit the spot!! I decided to double the recipe (all expcept the plantains) so I can use all the ground beef. It didn't seem like it was enough beef but then the title did say "Platano". Next time I use more plantains. I can see why the previous poster added bell peppers and cumin. I think I will try that next time. Don't skimp on the cilantro in fact add a little more. Cilantro really brings out the flavors in this dish. I will certainly try this again maybe serve it with white rice.

We only had 2 plantains and I used 1 lb. of ground beef. It was very tasty. I'd make it again.

The first plantain recipe I've found that my wife will eat. I didn't have any cilantro on hand sadly but I added some cumin and ginger to make up for it.

I brought my Tex-Mex flair in to brighten this dish up a bit. Sub jalape√±os for hot sauce put in extra veggies and herbs and only used a quarter of the indicated amount of plantain. I used slightly more beef and added fresh cilantro to sit on top after cooking. This will be perfect for soft tacos!

This was great! I used yellow with a lot of black on them plantains and fried them in a cast iron skillet with some oil instead of cooking them in water. I did everything else as is. Yum!

I can say the recipe is great just a suggestion changing the Worcestershire sauce for Salsa Lizano and the picadillo will be Pura Vida. Eat it as a gallito over a corn tortilla. Delicioso!!!

This was alright. The plantains give kind of an overpowering sweet taste....so I would reduce the amount of plantains and add more ground beef.

Very good combination of meat fruit and vegetables. This is a recipe that I will 'tweak' in the future possibly using garlic on the meat in place of the sauces previously mentioned. The plantains were very good after being boiled in water. I will probably try separating the ingredients once it cooked on everyone's plate. Possibly putting honey and coconut on the plantains.-----Joe Wheels

Followed the recipe Guidelines exactly the first time I made this, but this time I changed it up a bit..... I substituted russet potatoes vs plantains (because I had these), added a can of Tomato paste, cumin, and 3 Serrano peppers. Delicious with any variation !
