Flavorless.  Needs more vinegar.  Suggest red wine vinegar double recipe quantity and subtract the wine from the recipe.  Forget the pickling spice, it matters not.  Don't chop onion either: slice it for better looks.  Havn't tried my own suggestions, but it has got to be better.

Probably just me but it just wasn't the taste I was going for.  Just didn't seem to be very "pickled".

I substituted red wine vinegar for red wine & white vinegar.  Gives it a more "pickled flavour".

Great recipe for eggs!  The pickling spices add a complexity of flavors and the wine adds a beautiful deep color.  The only thing I would do different is cut back on the water, increase the wine and vinegar, and up the spices to a tablespoon.
