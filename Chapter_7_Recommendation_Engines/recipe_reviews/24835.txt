This was better the next day, however, I still had to add a few things to give it more flavor. Here are my changes: add 1/4 sour cream, 1/8 tsp dill, 1/2 tsp basil and 1/8 cup parm cheese. Those additions really make the dressing.

This dressing is restaurant quality.  With homemade dressings of this quality, there's absolutely no reason to buy it at the store.  The flavor of this recipe reminds me of one of the house dressings at a steakhouse in Iowa called "The Pink Poodle."  It may not be as good, but it's pretty darn close.  Honestly, I wouldn't change a thing--unless you just "have" to--so you can put your own stamp on it.  I am not a big Italian dressing fan, but CREAMY Italian, with a recipe like this, is well worth having.

Really zesty and flavorful. I added a little extra garlic. This one is a keeper!

This recipie is a real winner.  I add more garlic than suggested.  I also add parm and romano cheeses.  I have been looking for years for a creamy Italian dressing like this one.  It is just like the dressing they serve in a little Italian place in The Bronx, N.Y.  Thanks so much Christine for sharing this recipie.  It is a definite keeper!

I replaced the mayo with miracle whip, left out the water and the sugar. Used white wine vinegar to make a great dressing for lobster salad. I guess I still don't understand the fascination with adding sugar to everything.

I'm not a huge fan of creamy italian, but my husband asked for it with dinner so I gave this a try.  It was pretty good.  I used Hellman's lite mayo, olive oil vs. veg., added a little dried basil and some parmesan cheese.  I also let it set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors come together.

Excellent recipe!  I added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, used 1-1/2 cloves of garlic instead of just one, and some freshly ground pepper.  I will make this often.

This is the first dressing I've ever made, so I'm really not able to compare it to any others... But I found it very simple to make, and very tasty. Much more unique and tangy then a store-bought dressing. It was a little thick though at first so I put in extra water, and would recommend only 1/2c. of mayonnaise. Also, adding ground pepper was great b/c it added a little spice.

Hmmmm, I hate to be a wet blanket here, but this recipe didn't thrill me. The mayo taste was too strong and the herbs didn't have much impact. It did taste better after being refrigerated a day or two, but it still isn't something I will repeat.

Great dressing! I love it, it's not overly tangy, but has just the right amount of flavor. Thanks, I will make it again and again.

Hubs liked this, I was kind of indifferent, although in all fairness I must confess my bias toward just a basic, simple olive oil and vinegar dressing. I generally don't like fussy dressings, particularly if they're thick and gloppy.  As I looked over the recipe I was tempted to make so many changes that I realized I wouldn't be making the same recipe anymore. So in the end I prepared this just as written except for cutting the mayonnaise back by a third. Even still it was thick, and I found I had to add a fair amount of half and half to thin it out.  I've never had Creamy Italian Dressing before and found this thick and tangy which I don't particularly care for. Since Hubs liked it, however,  I guess it tasted the way it's supposed to!

Isn't it great when you find recipes that are both easy AND delicious?!? Personally, I think everyone would enjoy salads a lot more if they used homemade dressings. And when they are this easy, there's no excuse not to!

This was very good.  I added a bunch of fresh herbs from my garden.  Also, I had a little accident as I was making it.  I mistakenly thought that the worcestershire sauce had a little shaker top on it but it didn't, so I ended up dumping about 1/4 cup into it.  Actually, it still tasated very good -- just a little more 'caesar-like'.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this dressing with a simple salad of iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers, cucumbers, and homemade croutons.  I did use balsamic vinegar, as I wanted to use what I had in my cupboard, and I added a bit more water so that the dressing coated evenly.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe, and definitely a keeper!!  I prefer salad dressing a little thinner than this, so next time I will only use 1/2 cup of mayonnaise.  Thanks Christine!

I used best foods mayo, and it was still too "eggy" tasting, so I addes about 1 tsp more vinegar, a few more dashes of worcestershire, and some Italian seasoning.  The flavor was much better, and I could taste the spices more.

I thought this dressing was great, but I did modify it some. I'm not a mayo person so I used sour cream. Instead of sugar I used a little of my raw honey because I keep bees and it is so good! I thought 1 clove of garlic (pressed) was perfect. I was out of oregano so I used a rounded tsp of Italian Seasoning Blend and I highly recommend it. In addition, I added a little Celtic sea salt and ground pepper. Can't wait to have a salad with dinner tonight!

Wonderfull salad dressing.  I got many compliments on this one served with Fetucine and spinach chicken.  Creates a nice balance of creamy and tangy.

I'm pretty sure I could just eat this dressing with a spoon.  I usually just stir a little of it right up in the salad bowl I'm using, although it is really good if you let it sit for a day or two.  I also add dried basil and thyme, and substitute onion powder and garlic powder for the chopped garlic (I'm making my own dressing from scratch, that's hard core enough for me).  If you make it with Miracle Whip instead of mayo, you may not even need to add sugar, which gets around the problem of the sugar not dissolving when you want to use it right away.

I increased the mayo by half and doubled all the remaining ingredients (to get it to a nice "tossable" consistency).  Definitely make this at LEAST 1 day ahead to let the flavors blend.  I made it 2 days ahead the the taste was so much better!

This recipe was good, except that it had an odd type of tanginess due to the lemon juice. I've never tasted that in an Italian dressing before, and I didn't care much for it, so I made a 2nd batch.  I left out the lemon juice, and added 2T romano cheese, 1/2t dried Italian seasoning blend in place of the 1/4t of plain oregano, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (now that's Italian!)  and it tasted a lot better.  The added water, in my opinion, should be adjusted (I left it out) depending on how thick you like your dressing, so you may want to add that last.  
This is a decent 'base' dressing that allows for some creativity, but didn't hold up too well on its own as is.

Perfect!  I don't need to buy creamy dressings anymore.  Followed some of the earlier suggestions and reduced the mayo (used miracle whip), added 1/4 c. sour cream, used 2T. lemon juice and left out the vinegar, and used 1 tsp. Frontier Italian Seasoning blend in place of the oregano and basil, then added a bit of dill.  Super yummy!

Just made this today and it was phenomenal, can't wait to taste it after it's had awhile longer to blend... this recipe very closely matches my fave salad dressing which my Gramma used to make when I was a kid! Only thing I would do different is to use a tad less oregano but it's still a fantastic recipe!

Needed some dressing in a pinch and this fit the bill perfectly. I used a bit more of everything: red wine vinegar, garlic, oregano. Also used olive oil and lime juice (out of necessity). This work out spectacularly. Definitely a keeper.

Outstanding!  We absolutely adore the flavor - who would've thought to add Worcestershire sauce?  Seriously good - mine's a tad bit thick - haven't quite figured out best way to thin it, but aside from that, just great.  Thanks you so much for recipe.

This recipe was a hit with my husband, his parents, me and even my 2 year old son.  It's SUCH a simple recipe but it's OH SO GOOD.  I made a second batch of it tonight and it only had about 20 minutes to refrigerate before dinner and it was still great.  The best thing about it is that it's made using pantry staples and nothing extraordinary.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I followed the directions exactly and was so happy with the result!  Just plain DELICIOUS.  Served it at a dinner party where everyone kept asking me what brand of dressing it was, and then just stared at me when I said I made it.  Seems people don't make salad dressing anymore, ha-ha!

This dressing wasn't bad, but it didn't taste remotely like creamy Italian dressing.  My boyfriend liked it, but I was disappointed in the flavor.

Since I've made version I & II of this dressing in the same week, I figured it would be a good comparison of two!  This was good.  The lemon juice and worcestershire sauce really stand out in this dressing.  I had to add a pinch more sugar and additionally 1/4 cup mayo because of the tartness.  Our family preference will be version I.

I was amazed how good this was! I was out of salad dressing so I looked some recipes up and I had all of the ingredients for this on hand.  I used Miracle Whip and skipped on the sugar.  Nice and tangy, will try next on a pasta salad or experiment with a crab salad. Thanks for the recipe,will use again.

I enjoyed this dressing.  I did add about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning in addition to the oregano, because without it I felt like the mayonaise taste overpowered this dressing and I like a zesty Italian.  Nice consistency and taste though once I made this change.

Love it!!  I used 2 cloves because we love garlic. Otherwise perfect the way it is. Light mayonaise or using yougurt will change the taste and consistancy and how the other indredients interact with each other.   Cooking is like science.  If you don't follow the directions, its not going to work.

This was an amazing dressing! I will definitely be using this again. We got tired of just balsamic and oil and basic things like that. This dressing tastes like mixes of caesar, ranch and italian. Sounds like an odd combo but make it and you'll see what I mean. The only thing I changed was I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because that's what I had on hand. I also chopped the garlic then put a pinch of salt on the pile and then used the side of the knife to make a paste. Gave more garlic flavor that way. Thank you for the great recipe!

Christy - GREAT recipe!  I love the fresh clean flavors of the ingredients . . . I dare say that I'm reluctant to buy my dressings ever again!  I used fresh oregano from the garden and a bit of black pepper.  It was a fun recipe to play with!

Oh my gosh - so good! My husband does not like creamy dressing (or mayo or sour cream) but he loved this. (I kinda enjoy feeding him "banned" ingredients and seeing how much he loves them - works every time!) The flavors were good right after mixing but even better the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great dressing.  I did add a little milk to thin it out a bit and lite mayo made with olive oil, other than that I made as posted.  I really like the lemon juice.  My kids both cleaned their salad plates with this dressing and like to snack on veggies dipped in this.

I don't usually make home made salad dressings, but guess what...This was so good I don't think I could ever use store bought again. If you like garlic, this is the salad dressing you've been looking for.

Good, but I agree it needed more flavor.  I think next time I make it I'll add some Parmesan cheese.  I did add a little extra Italian seasoning, and a touch of salt and pepper.  UPDATE:  I actually make this dressing a lot, now, and always add my own twist to it.  I prefer homemade dressings to bottled, and love knowing exactly what I'm eating, and limiting the salt and sugar.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

OMG!  This was so good!  I changed the white wine vinegar to red just because that's what I had.  And I always change the sugar/corn syrup that a recipe calls for, with honey.

I made this with the ingredients and proportions stated, using canola oil mayonnaise and extra virgin olive for the vegetable oil. After chilling about twenty minutes it tasted good, and the flavors were pretty well balanced. I gave it four stars because it's a good base recipe and I wouldn't have any problems with serving it to guests as is. I didn't give it the 5th star because it's on the mild side and think it could be better with extra Italian herbs or seasonings. I will definitely make again and try some of the other reviewers' suggestions. If the sugar didn't dissolve, I didn't notice it, but it might solve the problem for others to change the directions and dissolve it in the water/vinegar/lemon juice first before whisking with the oily ingredients.

made this for my book club tonite & it was a real hit.  used it on the simple italian salad with artichokes, pimentos, red onions, & black olives with parm & asiago cheeses, & it was delish!!!!  i actually made it up last night & i think it really helped to have that time to meld the flavors.  excellent & so easy!

A good basic recipe to use. I did add a little black pepper and some crushed red pepper to jazz it up a bit though! To the reviewer who used Miracle Whip..Miracle Whip already has a high sugar content (compared to real mayo) that is why you didn't need to add the sugar to the recipe.  I actually used Smart Balance light mayo, which I did not like on it's own, but tasted fine once mixed with the other ingredients.  I will use again, great on pasta salad. Thank you.

This is gorgeous! Have made it to dress an asparagus appetizer, found it too creamy when i first tasted it then realised i'd missed the lemon juice so added that and it was perfect!

Great Creamy Italian Dressing.  I loved that I didn't have to drag out my blender to make it.  Tossed this with romaine, sliced roma tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, kalamata olives, peperoncini, croutons, and shredded parmesan

Needs some thinning, but I think much easier to use  store-bought Italian dressing in mayo instead with a touch of Worcestershire.

I thought this was okay, but it seemed like something was missing? I used lite mayonnaise, but at first it seemed both heavy and slightly tart. However, the next day it was much better. I put it in a one cup container with a twist top lid and it stayed good quite some time. For some reason it tasted good as a subtitute for mayonnaise on a sandwich to.

This dressing is so good!!  Had to bring a salad to my in laws for a home made pasta dinner. Everyone kept saying how good the salad was! I made as directed and I liked it but decided I wanted to plc it up a notch so I added fresh ground black pepper and some grated parmesan romano cheese. Fantastic results!!!!! I immediately made a second batch!!! Also made sure it was a good size garlic clove and I minced it well instead of chopping it. So yummy I could eat it with a spoon!!! I won't buy bottled again! Thanks so much for posting!

I used equal parts light mayonnaise, fat free plain yogurt and fat free sour cream. After making it this morning and letting it sit until dinner, I thought it was okay, but it needed more spices. I added more basil, as well as onion powder, basil, thyme, parsley and fresh ground pepper. After I added the extra spices, it tasted more like what you would expect for italian dressing. Maybe this is just a simpler version. This definitely tastes better the longer it sits. It is a little thicker than regular dressing so you might have to thin it down a bit. We used it for a dip so it worked for us.

Yummy!  I added more garlic, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp dill, 1/8 cup parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also let it sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

I prepared this dressing as written and it turned out quite well. As with most salad dressings made at home, it is far better than what you can buy in a store. Take the plunge and try it. You won't be disapointed.

I really loved this dressing!.. The garlic was kind of suttle but I love garlic so maybe I'll add more next time... So refreshing I ate two servings of salad instead of my main course!...

Great dressing base!  I used red and white wine vinegars and no citrus, added olive oil instead of veggie oil, added a pinch of salt, and used fresh basil and oregano from the herb garden instead of dried herbs.  Eyeballed everything, turned out very tasty!  I look forward to trying it with parmesan like others have suggested; the suggestion of tomato paste is also intriguing.

Quick & easy dressing to pull together.  I used Italian seasoning instead of the oregano & I used lite mayo.  I would have liked to see what it tasted like after sitting but there was not any left...which means someone had more than their share of salad that night!

I made this recipe exactly but I used up the rest of some generic Mayo because I was unsure of this recipe. The first day it was very tangy but after sitting two days it was totally awesome.  I am going to try it again using the good mayo I have and maybe adding paprika, more garlic, and black pepper.  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't what these bad reviews are about because I thought this dressing tasted delicious!  I just kept tasting and adding ingredients until I thought it was flavorful enough.  I use it on cobb salads and as a vegetable dip.

Great simple recipe. I did not have red wine vinegar, so I used regular white. And, sorry, not sorry, I use EVOO for everything! other than those slight alterations, still turned out better than anything I've bought.

For a homemade creamy salad dressing this is very good. After making it I wish there was more seasoning or flavors (such as garlic or Parmigiana) but definitely a 4.5 as is! Quick easy delicious thank you for the recipe!

I agree with others,  it is restaurant quality. I subbed balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. It was creamy and oh so tasty. Not too much vinegar or mayonnaise. I served it with a Waldorf salad and it was exceptional.

I like this recipe because I always have the ingredients, it's easy, and taste good. I use it anytime I need ranch dressing for a particular recipe. I always make it according to the recipe here I never alter it and I've made it now at least 6+ times. It is a keeper.

Yum that is some really good dressing. I think it needs a little more garlic though.

After following the recipe, it just tasted like mayonnaise. Literally, just mayonnaise in a bowl. Gross as heck.

This was very easy and very good.  I didn't change a thing, other than using garlic power, instead of a clove of garlic.  I am going to try it on a pasta salad next.

First few times made this exactly as the recipe said and it's great! Exactly what I was hoping it would be.  Will never buy store bought again.  Now I add a little bit of pepper but that's just personal preference

Is it possible to put too much garlic in something...I didn't think so.  I'm a garlic fan Fan FAN but I think I did.  I'm going to make this again and I will re-rate if that is what I didn't care for about it.  I did reduce the mayo to 2/3 of a cup and the lemon juice to 1/2 a tablespoon and added some parmesan cheese.  It has a great consistency and a great flavor I just taste too much garlic (weird!).

If you also add some dried basil, thyme and parsley the flavor will be more complex.

This is the best dressing I have ever tasted! My husband & I luv it! I just add a little red onion chopped very fine but it doesn't need it, just my preference. I have made it for our neighbors and they are ready to drink it and put it on everything. Good job Christy!

Delicious! The only salad dressing my daughter has ever eaten for the first time and loved. She actually didn't eat my chili supper and asked for salad seconds! My 7 yr old even remarked, "You never hear that!" So thanks for posting. (PS I ran out of mayo so filled it out a bit with some half and half cream - worked well). I used my Magic Bullet to mix it. It kind of emulsified beautifully giving it a  bit of "grab" on the salad.

I'm giving this 5 stars after using it for several years as an excellent base for other creamy dressings.  As written, it is a mild tasting creamy garlic dressing or dip.  You really must let it sit for at least four hours for the flavors to develop fully!  To make a creamy Italian as the original poster intended, I like to add more vinegar and an Italian blend for the herbs.  However, you can add other ingredients as well, to taste.  Parmesan cheese; a little tomato paste or ketchup; fresh ground peppercorns; different vinegars (try tarragon infused white wine vinegar and change the herbs to tarragon); buttermilk; use your imagination!

Fantastic flavor!  I love having a homemade salad dressing, and not glop from the supermarket.  Per my own taste, I added extra garlic and a bit of parm cheese.  Delish.  Thank you!

We thought it was very zesty and wonderful on baby spinach.  I needed to make a dressing very quickly, since dinner was already sitting on the table, so we had to use the dressing immediately...  It was better after it chilled overnight!

This is a great salad dressing.  I'm tired of paying $4-5+ for a bottle of junk that doesn't even taste good.  I'll keep this on hand from now on.  I did add a little more red wine vinegar.

Used fresh-squeezed lemon juice and extra garlic; yummy and easy. Made a few hours beforehand and refrigerated. Many compliments from teenagers.

This was a great recipe. Very simple, and I had all the ingredients in the pantry (big plus!). My boyfriend and I gobbled it up after I let it sit in the fridge for a little bit (per reviews). There's still a bit left over for tonight, so I'm looking forward to trying it after its sat a bit as people suggested!

This was easy, and delicious.  The only thing I added was a few shakes of black pepper.  Great in a cold pasta salad!

This was a good recipe, though the vinegar flavor was a bit strong for my taste.  I also think it could use a little less oregano - it makes it a bit bitter.

Made this to use on some veggies from our garden. It was pretty good - I did add some parmesean as well.

My husband and I did not like this dressing.  I think the Worchestershire sauce was was ruined it.  It had an odd taste that we did not like.  I will try to fix it up as others suggested, but as written, it was a failure.  Thanks anyway.

I just made this for a broiled chicken and greens salad.  I used a pretty good size (huge) garlic clove, don't measure spices, but probably added more red wine vinegar than recipe called for and only a very small pinch of sugar. I think a little crushed red pepper might be good too, but didn't try it.  Before I put it on the salad I dipped a broccoli floret in it, and thought what a great dip for veggies, using sour cream to thin it down some.  I'll make this again I'm sure.  Very tangy though.
