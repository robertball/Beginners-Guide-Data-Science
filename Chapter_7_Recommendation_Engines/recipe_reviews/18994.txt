Just a comment for the person who says the raw egg is a health hazard: chocolate mousse, among other desserts, has been made with raw eggs for a long time. And by the way, a raw egg that is cooked is no longer a raw egg.

Its true! This is a rich very decadent dessert! I love it. My family loves it. And its definitely fine restaurant quality mousse. For extra richness, you could even replace the milk with heavy cream. Don't worry about the raw eggs, they cook in the milk since its heated to 165 degrees! If its too sweet, simply cut the extra sugar and just go with the sugar in the choc chips!

Although, I haven't tried this particular recipe I am familiar with a similar one.  The one I use is 1 bag of chocolate, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1 cup boiling hot milk.  EXCELLENT!  By the way, the addition of hot milk to the egg, cooks it, thus making it safe.

I'm used to mousse being a little lighter than this, so I think I'll do what another reviewer said and whip the egg whites separately.  I also halved the recipe and didn't have any semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand, so I subbed 1 c. cocoa mixed w/5 T. melted shortening.  I also used Mexican vanilla in place of the brandy, and the taste was phenomenal.  I can't wait to make this again!

After reading the reviews, I cut back on the sugar, it was still waaaay to sweet. Plus, it didn't even have the consistency of mousse, it was watery. A waist of ingredients. How can someone publish such a rotton recipe??

So here is the deal with this specific recipe of mousse, you NEED to use heavy whipping cream in place of the milk for the mousse to set.  I have not heard of using milk in a mousse recipe and so I did not even attempt to try.  I also use a food processor instead of the blender because I found that you get that creamy texture quicker and easier.  Instead of rum I have used Bailey's or Kahlua, so good!  I mix the mousse pour it into martini glasses and place in the fridge.  It is ready in about 4 hours.  For those who have said this is too rich of a dessert and didn't like it, THAT is what chocolate mousse is!  A very rich and decadent dessert.  This particular one is not as light and fluffy as I like, therefore the 4 stars.  However, it is really yummy and so easy.  I have made it for 2 dinner party's and it was enjoyed by all!  Hopefully this will help!

This is the easiest mousse I've ever made and it tastes just like the restaurants, not some pudding knock off. I use amaretto instead of brandy for personal preference and it's always a huge hit. I love to serve with rasberries.

I made this again (after my first disaster with it - very gritty) and this time I literally brought the milk to a boil ...it worked much better and the chocolte melted as it was supposed to.  It was a pretty good mousse.

Phenomenal recipe - do not trust the bad reviews, a real chef would know how to put together such a wonderful recipe. GREAT consistency. My exact steps, dump whole bag of chocolate chips (semi sweet) in blender, add just under a half cup of sugar, crack one egg in and blend on high speed for 30 seconds. in the mean time, i replaced milk with 35% whipping cream and heated on the stove in a pot (medium eat) constantly stirring till a boil. crack second egg and repeat 30 second blending process, and third egg, after all eggs are blended in - pour in the (now rising/boiling whipping cream) and blend one more time for another 30-45 seconds. pour in to your little serving cups and there you have it, let cool in fridge for ATLEAST 2 hours before serving, although i let it cool for 16-20 hours (becomes much nicer and settled by this time)

Having read the reviews I decided to heat the milk first, add the chocolate and blend. After tasting, this was already sweet enough so I omitted the sugar all together. Then added 4 eggs, not 3 and Amaretto (as someone suggested). Turned out well for a quick mousse and set within 2 hours. If I make this again, I will try adding half milk/half cream.

Very disappointing.  This was not light and fluffy at all.  In fact, it was more like a runny pudding.

I was worried because of some reviews, but I wanted to try this mousse anyway. I skipped on the brandy and I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream, but still, it didn't stiffen up. I put it in the fridge and forgot about it. After 24 hours, my daughter got them out of the fridge and guess what: it looked and tasted delicious!!! This is going to be one of my favorites! I even sold it in my shop! Thanks for sharing this recipe

Read the reviews and see the inconsistent results people get with it setting up. I used 2T rum extract for the alcohol, and after several hours had to move it to the freezer. Good, rich taste, but babysitting in the freezer to get it to set is why I give it 1 star. Too many people are having the same problem with it being runny.

I used Bailey's instead of brandy.   It's not as fluffy as a mousse but it's delicious and a small amount is plenty!  I served it in American Girl flower pots with a silk daisy stuck in each pot.  I served a piece of scotch shortbread on the side.  My guests loved it!

it was way too sweet, not enough for the flavor to be recognized. the mixture went gooey and chilling it or refrigerating it wasnt enough. i had to put it in the freezer for it to stay firm. but, it was way better with whipped cream! promise!

I substituted Hazelnut-flavored liqueur for the brandy and the mousse was absolutely delicious! It is a bit rich and sweet but I expect that in a dessert.  It was easy to make in the blender and after it set for an hour, I used it as a filling between cooled dark chocolate cake layers.  I will definitely save this recipe for future use! I'd love to try different liqueur flavors.

First time I've made chocolate mousse. I followed the recipe exactly except what booze was used. The dessert was wonderful! If you do EXACTLY what is written it WILL turn out right. That said, I will cut back on the sugar to about 1/4c or even try it once with out sugar at all, as it is VERY sweet. It would be interesting to try it with some dark chocolate morsels too! Oh, and the booze... I used 3T of Kahlua and 1T of Triple Sec. I couldn't taste the flavor of the booze at all. Maybe just my taste buds, they ARE as old as I am!! lol! For a parting thought. I think the biggest reason some have problems with it not setting up is they may not be getting the milk hot enough. Did mine in a 1100w microwave for 2 minutes and the milk was 187* and the mousse set up within 3 hours. Four stars only because it was WAY TOO sweet. But there are so many things you can do with this recipe! Have fun with it!!

For how simple this recipe is, the taste, texture and presentation are exquisite.  I used roughly 3/4 c semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/4 c white chocolate chips, 3 candy canes, 3 eggs, and 1 c milk.  Followed the directions as written, when I checked the mousse about 3 hours later it was perfectly set.  I might try beating the egg whites separately for a fluffier texture, but I thought that it was fine as prepared also.  It was quite thick, might even be a suitable filling for a cake (one that could withstand considerable pressure when frosting).  Kind of reminded me of truffle filling too...

I followed the exact recipe except no brandy. I think this is too rich for my taste. A little goes a long way. The mousse set up firmly after an hour in the fridge. Next time I will whip the egg whites separately for a lighter texture. Otherwise it is a good recipe.

I could never get it to set. After 24 hours in the fridge, we wound up just freezing it into popsicles. Tasted good, reminiscent of pudding pops (remember those?) but definitely wasn't chocolate mouse.

Easy to make - if milk is scalding hot, it will set. Often described as a pot de creme due to its denseness. I never add sugar - plenty sweet as it is! My favorite version uses Cointreau (or another orange liqueur). This time I'm using Kahlua and pouring it into an Oreo crumb pie crust, and will top with toasted sweetened coconut.

I scaled this down for two and followed the recipe as closely as I could.  The flavor was pretty good, but it just didn't set very well.  It was still liquidy even after 2 hours in the fridge.  Did I miss something?

It is a very easy and tasty dessert however you must use milk with fat in it for it to set...also you can't 'bump up' the brandy because the extra alcohol won't allow it to set either.  Learned both of these the hard way and wound up chocolate syrup.

This recipe was good -- but I would say it is more like halfway between mousse and pudding. I used vanilla extract instead of brandy and half nonfat milk and half 'half and half.' I also cut the sugar in half. It wasnt grainy at all, but I did boil the milk after reading the reviews. Some little pieces of the chocolate didnt melt, but that was really yummy. I may make again!

Mousse came out much too sweet and grainy.  Very disappointing and a waste of good chocolate.

This recipe does not utilize proper food safety techniques. Raw egg should not be eaten unless it is cooked. Maybe an egg substitute would be acceptable such as egg beaters.

I made it for Valentines Day, some grittiness, but more disappointing was that it didn't gel, it is soupy. My first recipe that disappointed me from this site after years of using it. Wondering if I can re work it.

I've made this about 10 different times.  I found that by subbing some whipping cream for the milk the results are much heavier.  I recently used 2% milk, double the brandy and let the mixer blend on high for about 3 minutes.  It was much lighter and more like mousse than previous versions.  I get raves everywhere I take this.  Topped with real whipped cream, fresh rasberries and a sprig of mint turns this into a sensational desert fit for the pickiest guest!

my mom found this recipe in the local paper back in the '70's and has been making it for decades. i'm very, very bad in the kitchen but have made this mousse quite successfully dozens of times. i came to this site trying to find the recipe since it was not in my collection and was thrilled to find it. just a note to those on milk-restricted diets: i make this with soy milk and egg starts to cut out dairy and cholesterol and it still rocks!! it's very easy and if you can boil milk in the microwave, you can make this mousse. i add fresh berries to a martini glass then pour a one person serving in, let it chill, add more berries on top and serve! it's great for dinner parties or even for large parties (i'll use wine glasses to chill it in). this is a great and super easy recipe that can be the jumping off point for really tasty and creative desserts. enjoy!

I followed this recipe exactly, and after 5 hours in the fridge I had chocolate soup. So I decided to use a mixer and add some whipping cream, it stiffened a little. But I wouldn't call it mousse. Sorry, but I won't attempt this one again.

This is so easy to make, but super rich and "chocolicious". I omitted the brandy and added a tablespoon of Kahlua instead. The whipped cream garnish is a must-I had none and it was just too much-almost like eating fudge.

this was delicious and really easy! I found the longer it stayed in the fridge the better it was!! i left in in the fridge for four hours and it was perfectly thick!! i topped it with strawberrys blueberrys and blackberrys and icing sugar!!  make sure you let it chill in the cups you will be serving it in it will be less messy and more presentable!! i also didnt add any brandy and it was still flavoufull enough!! enjoy its awsome!!

I made it, and we didn't have a whole cup of milk, so I used half (vitamin D) milk and half whipping cream, and it came out fantastic, very thick and rich!  Next time I'll use less of the sugar.  Oh, and the brandy isn't necessary.

made it both with the brandy and without for the kids.  Both were good but.....milk needed to be almost burning hot to get the chocolate to melt correctly.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written but used heavy cream rather than milk & Bailey’s Irish Cream instead of brandy. Added eggs one at a time, blending for 30 seconds each time per previous reviewer’s suggestion. The results were smooth & creamy. The chocolate over powered the Bailey’s, so not sure that was needed. Completely set in 4 hours with no problem. I agree with the reviewer who noted these are more pot de creme than mousse due the density. Simple, decadent dessert. Will make again & add vanilla next time.

Should have read the reviews before I made the recipe. It tasted bland and nobody wanted to eat more or finish their bowl.  THEN I read the reviews an how to fix it. Wrong time to read reviews... lesson learned!

It was pretty good. I think it was light. I mixed the eggs separately to make it more fluffy. I didn’t use brandy because I don’t drink.

Substituted 1 cup evaporated milk for 1 cup whole milk, using a thermometer to make sure the temperature reached 160,  and it set up perfectly in 1 hour! Also added 1 Tbsp vanilla to replace the brandy.  To cut down on the sweetness, replaced the 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 cup Splenda, no grittiness issues.  Separated eggs, adding just yolks to blender, then whipped whites till stiff and folded them into mousse right before pouring into cups to give it a lighter texture. Added a swirl of whipped topping to compliment.  A dessert fit for royalty!!!

This was super yummy and Yes! Super easy! I would definitely use less sugar, and increase chill time to 2 hours because it was NOT set at only 1 hour. I didn't have brandy & it wasn't missed.

I didn´t have a blender handy, so I mixed the eggs with the sugar really well, then gently warmed up the milk and added to it the chocolate to melt. No brandy either, but I added some orange zest for added flavour. Then I added the chocolate milk to the egg mixture. It tastes great, but didn´t set. I´ll add some corn starch to it tomorrow and heat it again - it should set then. Other than not setting, I like it - it´s an easy recipe. 
Update: I mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch with a bit of milk and added it to the simmering chocolate mixture. It thickened nicely and still tastes great. But next time, I'll find a better recipe that doesn't need doctoring.

I read all the reviews before making this and all I can say is it turned out to be a sweet disaster. First of all I used half semi sweet and half white chips, because that is what I had on hand. I decided to add a little cocoa powder to make up for the added sweetness of the white chips and also used no sugar. I used half a cup of half/half and half a cup of heavy whipping cream and I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract instead of the brandy. I made sure that my milk mixture was boiling before I poured it into the blender and I blended it very well. Unfortunately 24 hours later the texture is like a thin pudding or a thick ice cream topping that is overly sweet. If you melted fudge and let it cool for about 10 minutes... it would probably be about the same texture and flavor. I was hoping for something like pots de creme if not mousse but this is neither. I suppose I will have to go back to making both the traditional way. I think it may be salvagable if I whipped cream until it was fairly stiff (unsweetened) and then I folded this mixture into the cream. I think that wouldnt be too terrible. I may just try that later tonight.

i was a little leary (sp?) about the whole blender mousse thing, from a quality point of view, but i've gotta say, this was was absolutely off the charts tasty.  I added rum instead of brandy, as it's what i had on hand,  i usually can "smell" the egg in other blender mousses i have made, this was perfect....and egg was undetected - thanks for the recipe. definitely a keeper.

Though this mousse tasted great as is, I altered it so I could use it as a filling for a mint-mocha layer cake.  These are the measurements I used: 4 oz. mint chocolate chips, 2 Tbsp. sugar, 1 egg, and 2 tsp. instant coffee dissolved in 3 Tbsp. hot milk.  It thickened up perfectly and tasted great!  
For those of you who are new to the recipe, try reducing the sugar - the chocolate chips provide enough sweetness on their own.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

I've been craving chocolate mousse....this one looked easy...and I had the ingredients....so gave it a try.  WOW!  EASY and YUMMY!  I used half-and-half, since my other choice was skim, added two capfuls of RUM instead of the brandy....and this is FABULOUS!  We ate one already, and will eat the rest after dinner, with a big dollop of whipped cream.  My 11 y/o is looking forward to making this all by herself...and soon!

This turned out very well, everyone loved the intense chocolate experience.  However, it was more like a pot au creme than like a mousse.  I gradually added the hot milk as I blended the rest of the ingredients and it came out very well

Very easy to prepare.    Mousse was VERY sweet so topping it with unsweetend heavy whipped cream helped temper this.

I made this for a very special dinner party and it could not have been more of a hit.  Rich and creamy, perfect with some sliced strawberries and whipped cream on top!

I skipped the brandy on this one and let my 9-year-old daughter make the recipe.  She loved doing it, and clean-up was so simple.  My husband, a confirmed choc-a-holic, ate half the bowl in one sitting.  Oh, and I should point out that because this is so thick and rich, a little goes a long, long way.

Turned out way too sweet and really grainy - a total disaster!
