If you like prunes you will love this. Bakes up soft on the bottom. Do not overbake or it will be hard. I make it the day before serving and the flavors blend well.I also put a layer of vanilla pudding on top and then top with whipped cream.

I chose this recipe to use up egg whites I had from ice cream making. The dessert is tasty but I didn't understand how to serve it. It is very difficult to put it from the baking dish without breaking. Difficult to cut it. We ate it from the baking dish. The recipe says to bake the dessert until nicely browned. Mine at this point wasn't set yet. We like it but I don't know if I make this again.
