I thought this was delicious. Great cranberry and orange flavors. The crust was not so "doughy" and fell to the bottom when I cooked it. This made it very thick. When I cooked it with the curd, it boiled over then cooled uneven, but it was great to eat! I did not strain it for lack of time and unless you mind a little cranberry seed or orange piece it is fine. I used a vitamix to blend so it was very smooth. I will make again!
