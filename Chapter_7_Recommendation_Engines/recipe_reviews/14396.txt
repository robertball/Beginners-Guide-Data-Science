This was a good fruit salad, Very sweet.  It did not keep well though.  The afternoon after I had made it, it looked awful.  I think this was due to the marshmallow cream, which was a little over the top in my opinion.  This recipe was good, but I believe it could use a little tweaking.

I think this dish was delicious.  The apples and bananas remained fresh for days.  I will definitely make it again.

I loved this fruit salad and so did my Easter guests.  My recommendation would be to make sure you drain all the canned fruit really well, as it does have a tendency to get a little watery after it sits. I had to drain the excess liquid a couple of times after the salad was made.  Leftovers the next day were still very good, and the walnuts and apples were still crunchy.  I did not bother to halve the cherries.  Thanks for the easy, tasty recipe, Espinoza!
