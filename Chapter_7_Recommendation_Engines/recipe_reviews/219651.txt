This has been my go-to fudge sauce for years. Never fails to turn out the creamiest sauce EVER. If you follow the instructions, you can't fail. NOTE: If you want flavored chocolate, other extracts can be added in place of the vanilla. Peppermint extract is a nice addition.

Great recipe!  This is what I did different: Used only 2 1/2 cups sugar, and only about 3/4 the can of evap. milk. Also I alternated adding the sugar and milk into the pan, it kept the thickness more even.  Thanks for the recipe!

I saw this on the new recipes page, and I decided to try it. I thought this tasted good, especially for using fairly common cubard staples. I used the calculate button and made 2 servings, which ended up being easily like 4-5 servings. I only had semi-sweet 1 oz squares and just used that and regular milk. The key to these type of fudge sauces is to make sure to never cook them above low, as suggested, the entire time. On my stove that is button 3 typically. Temperatures above that will turn the sugar/sauce gritty. Tastes good with just a little on some vanilla ice cream. On the ice cream it also thickens up, and strangely tastes a little less overly sweet.

Great hot fudge sauce.  It took mine longer than 7 minutes to thicken enough though.

Good flavor but a bit on the gritty side. Maybe try powdered sugar next time.

I made this recipe for a group of ladies and I was totally pleased with the results.  It was a very creamy, smooth chocolate chocolate sauce. It headed up very well and was wonderful over ice cream.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for.

Perfection! I was on a quest to find the perfect hot fudge sauce to make for prize gifts for my daughter-in-law-to-be's bridal shower. My search is over. I followed this recipe to a T and it was exactly what I was looking for. Other recipes I came across just didn't have the deep fudge flavor this one has. I think using the unsweetened chocolate is the ticket. I always use Domino sugar in my baking and cooking. I think it seems to dissolve more smoothly. Absolutely scrumptious and will be my go-to recipe for fudge sauce!

This recipe has everything you could want.  It is made with ingredients readily available in your pantry, it has a wonderful chocolate flavor, and has a beautifully smooth and glossy finish.

This was good, however next time I'm going to use the suggestions of what lovetocook said they did. Reduce the sugar and the evaporated milk. It was tasty and delicious, in fact, I eat it now currently straight from the jar. :) But, it was a tad too sweet for me.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years. It is so good you will never be satisfied with store bought ice cream topping again.  Easy and fool proof.
