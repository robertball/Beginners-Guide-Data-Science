I'm not an avid baker but 2 Tablespoons of baking powder is a bit much I think. I made these and was very disappointed with the results, they came out with flat tops and were all crumbly.  They tasted okay but I don't even want to waste the ingredients to make frosting.   I'll be looking for a recipe with better ingredient ratios.

I made this with 1 cup of honey instead of all the sugar, spelt flour instead of regular flour, 1 whole shredded zucchini and 2 whole shredded carrots, and I absolutely loved the results! It tastes amazing with a little honey butter and is very moist!

This recipe was "o.k."   Made it as written except subbed coconut sugar for the white as I don't eat white sugar.  I was sceptical about the amount of baking powder to, but gave it a try.  The muffins didn't rise very much and I am wondering if maybe they rose and fell while baking due to the amount of baking powder.  Would be interesting to try with 2 teaspoons instead. Flavour was a bit below par as well.
