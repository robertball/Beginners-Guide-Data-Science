I followed the directions, but the crumb mixture was so moist, it was more like a biscuit. I didn't want to add more flour to produce a thick, heavy blob. Whatever, I kept going. I simmered the apples for longer and added more cinnamon, cloves and butter along with water for a juicer mix. I spread the gooey crust stuff on the bottom of a buttered 9x9 ( I hate spring forms)  followed with the apples then dolloped the rest of the mix on top. It baked nicely and tasted really good....just nothing crumb about it. I served it warm with a bit of ice cream.  I will do this again but use cold butter and cut it into the flour mix for a crumbly outcome. Thank you for sharing!

very simple recipe, I made it just as directed.  The dough did seem a little too sticky, when I make it again I will probably add a little more flour .   Everyone loved it.

I mixed Granny Smith and honey crisp apples did add add a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to apples while cooking but it turned out great and tasted wonderful. Made a unique presentation very pretty not a crumb was left. Iâ€™m actually helping my 2 teenage grandsons at 11pm make another  they really liked it
