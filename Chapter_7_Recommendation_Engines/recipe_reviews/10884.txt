Great recipe.  Especially easy.  Sure, they don't look pretty, but just by simply melting chocolate chips & spreading them on top, and then sprinkle finely chopped peanuts, they took on an entirely different look!!  When I make these again, I will use milk chocolate chips, and/or increase the peanuts to one cup and leave out chips inside of it, and spread the melted chips on top.  Just my preference. One can easily adjust this recipe.  Worth a try to make.

These taste great, yet they are unattractive.  I brought them to a bake sale and nobody was buying them, yet when a man tried one he said "Wow, these are great!" and he bought the whole plate.  The next time I made them I frosted them and put sprinkles and a cherry on them, and they sold right away.  These are fabulous, and I'd recommend them to everyone.

Every one loved it. I think those who had problems with it didn't cook the peanut butter mixture long enough. I used the last cup of chocolate chips in the bag as a frosting on top. As easy as making rice crispy treats! Thank you

I've never tried the bar, but these are definitely YUMMY!... heavy, too!  They go rock-hard pretty quickly, so cut them into squares BEFORE they're cooled.  Also, to make them edible after 2-3 days of storage (if they last that long!), nuke them in the microwave until barely warm - the peanut butter mixture will soften again, and they will be as chewy and wonderful as when you first made them!

These are great! I have found that the kind of peanut butter and corn flakes does make a difference, though. I tried it once with natural peanut butter and "healthy" corn flakes and it was a disaster ... they were so hard I broke a knife point trying to cut them after they cooled. But with really creamy peanut butter (I used Peter Pan) and commercial cornflakes (Kellogg's) the result was crunchy, light, and delicious. I was even able to cut back a little on the corn syrup and substitute 2 T. of water, and they still came out perfect. I also like to sprinkle a few extra chocolate chips on the top, since the chocolate has a tendency to melt when the mixture is still warm.

I had this recipe in a beloved cookbook . . . I have not made them in years - but am over-joyed to find this here! I had a horrible time cutting them - my ex had to do it for me wearing heavy-duty gloves to protect his hands. What I ended up doing was making "balls" of the dough and dipping them into melted chocolate . . . ***edit*** I make these for my chocolate-hating, Baby Ruth-loving manchild. I roll them into logs and don't dip them in chocolate - for naked Baby Ruth Bars for the chocolate hater. He loves them!

I have been making these for years and am just now rating them...they are great!! Quick, easy and always a hit... not sure that they taste like a babe ruth bar, but who cares, they taste great. Only tips I have: I mix the corn flakes PB and choc chips in a large bowl then am able to dump them in the melted mixture and get a better blend of ingredients. I also line a 13x9 pan with aluminum foil and then press the bars into it. Once in fridge for  little while, you can pull them out of the pan by the foil and then use a pizza cutter to cut them into squares of any size. Be careful you don't fridgerat them too long though--they become a real booger to cut.

These were great. The kids love them. I followed the advice of the previous reviewer and lined my 13 x 9 pan with foil, sprayed a bit with some PAM and then put in the fridge to set them up a bit. Once you cut them up you should keep them in a tupperware container to keep them nice and fresh and out of the fridge since they have a better texture at room temp.

I have been making these for years.  My Mom used to make these to put in our lunch boxes, and I did the dame for my kids.  They are also great for showers and holiday cookie exchanges, with a little bit of fancying up!  I eliminate the white sugar, and use 1 cup brown sugar. The white sugar may be part of the reason people have trouble cutting the bars.  Also, since I have always used chunky peanut butter, I don't use extra peanuts.  Often, I just leave out the chocolate chips, or I use them spread on top as a sort of icing.  You can change up this recipe so many ways, and it is always great if you can get past its homely appearance!

I needed a quick recipe.  I found this one and it was so quick and easy.  The dessert did so well someone actually wanted to pay for the recipe.
I have made it many times.  I added white chocolate chips seperate from the chocolate and it tastes great too.
Thanks.

These were awesome! Read all the reviews and took some advice from some of the others and decided to make the first time with the Honey Graham cereal instead of the corn flakes. I just figured it would give it more flavor and I was right. I also, before they cooled, melted a bag of peanut butter chips in the microwave, adding a tsp or two of shortening, and spread that on top, along with extra peanuts and the baking mini M&Ms. That made for a nicer presentation. Found it easier to cut AFTER they were cool, versus before, though. Brought half the pan to work and they were gone right away and left the other half at home for all the teenagers in the neighborhood......they also disapeared right away! This is one I will definitly add to my Christmas baking list!

Granted these gems are delicious, at least what I scraped out of the pan, the remainder are cooling before they are cut.
I agree, they are more like Watchmacallits than Baby Ruth's.

I must admit, I felt like Lucy minus Ethyl at the Candy Factory while preparing this recipe!
I needed another set of hands, as the concoction sets up VERY QUICKLY when the cereal is added.
Not thinking when the spatula was not working to mix everything I "dove in" with my hands. 
Can you say HOT LAVA?????

Even though I had a bit of trouble making these, they still get 5 stars.
BTW, burn ointment works as good as buttered hands when pressing into the pan to cool.

It was okay but not great.  I had a hard time cutting them I ended up rolling them into balls and I put them in little candy cups.  Don't think I'd make them again,

Really easy to make and good.  I put wax paper on the bottom of the dish, coated it with non-stick spray, then I pushed the bars into the dish.  To get them out I just flipped the dish upside down and gave a tug on the wax paper.  I added a full cup of peanuts, and would only add 5 cups of corn flakes if I make this again.  Would like to try making them with Golden Grahams, instead of corn flakes.

I'm not sure these taste like the candy bar, but they are certainly tasty. I gave these away to friends on pretty little Christmas plates. I do agree with another reviewer that I was disappointed in the appearance, but mine weren't crumbly. In an attempt to make my second batch look more appetizing, I made according to the recipe, but after they had cooled, I cut them into 1/2 inch squares, and rolled them in a melted combined mixture of 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/4 cup peanut butter chips and 1 teaspoon shortening. It was sure messy, but they came out looking good and tasted even more chocolatey. So far four people have asked me for the recipe! Thanks Suzanne!

These were AWESOME!  I used Honey Corn Flakes and low fat Jiff creamy pb, and instead of 1/2 cup white sugar I used about 1/3 cup Splenda/Sugar blend.  I also only mixed in about 4 cups of corn flakes but used maybe 1/2 cup more as a topping along with some extra chocolate chips.  I think it would be nice to try milk chocolate chips next.  But these were great and easy!!!

Haven't eaten any yet, but based on all the reviews it should be great!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I wasn't sure how long to cook the mixture.  It seems my mixture was smooth when I put it in the pot, so how long was I supposed to cook it?  2 min - 15 min??  Any help is appreciated, I cooked mine until it started to get a bit dark brown, so probably too long, we'll see.

These were good.  A true fan of Babe Ruth bars said they tasted just like the real thing.  I made a mistake by adding the chocolate chips to the PB mixture before adding the corn flakes.  It might have changed the texture but the taste was great.

I took these as a quick treat for my co-workers, the cut up bars disappeared in no time, I used frosted flakes as they are a bit thicker and hold up better in recipes. This recipe was delicious and so simple. clean up was easy too.

my nine year old son and I made these in less than 15 minutes!  We also added the extra pnut butter to help it stick together.  The idea for the extra chips melted on top really helps this recipe stay together after it cools! Delicious!

These bars were super easy to put together and really quite tasty. Unfortunately my chocolate chips melted when everything was stirred together so it looked more like a chocolate bar. My only real issue was the chewiness of the bar. I realize that's because of the corn flakes, but it may still prevent me from making them again.

Simple recipe, really addictive bar "candy". I made the bars without 
the chips inside, and instead melted
the chips in a makeshift double boiler
with a little milk and about a 1/2 c.
of creamy peanut butter. Adding the
milk made the chips more creamy and easily spreadable. The whole family liked these and they could be
easily made with ingredients that most
people have on hand. I will make these
again, but I will try butterscotch chips
mixed in with the cereal mixture.

Edited 06/09/08: If I make these again,
I will skip the melted chips on top.
It's too much. I'll just keep the
recipe as is.

YUM!

Made this today, really good. Used the amounts listed, wouldn't change a thing. Soft and chewy. Melted the chocolate and drizzled it on top instead of mixing it in. The best part was how fast and easy this is to make. Thanks:)

These were delicious!!  I used about 4c. of corn flakes and honey roasted peanuts.  Everyone was quite fond of them.  I put them into a greased 9x13 baking dish, but I foiled it first, and greased the foil.  Made clean up a cinch!

I made these bars for a bake sale at my husband's work.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and lowered the cornflakes to 4 cups (crushed), melted more chocolate chips on top for "icing" and sprinkled chopped peanuts on top.  They looked really nice and tasted wonderful!

I have made these bars before (very tasty made per the recipe!), but I was looking for a foundation for making something similar to the Nature Valley protein bars.  I had to go with what I had in the pantry, so I used brown rice instead of corn syrup, brown rice puffed cereal instead of corn flakes, and an unprocessed cane sugar instead of white sugar (and used dark brown sugar--again just what I had on hand).  I also added 2 cups peanuts (roasted at home and very lightly salted)and the whole bag of chocolate chips (bittersweet chips is what I had on hand), and I added a splash of vanilla and a scoop of protein powder to the peanut butter mixture before I added the dry ingredients.  My end result was almost spot on for what I was going for, and it actually tastes even better than the store-bought bars.  I cooked my mixture in the microwave for about 2 1/2 minutes.  It turned out perfectly!

After reading some reviews and noticing most users said the bars didn’t look pretty I decided to sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the mixture after putting it into the baking dish. They looked pretty but these bars are way too sweet for my taste. I wouldn’t change anything on the recipe; the bars are good but for people with a sweet tooth.

My bars were nice and chewy. Over cooking the sugar mixture would be what makes them hard. One daughter thought it needed more peanut butter, the other more chocolate. I will make them again, but maybe try and cut back on the sugar to help with the sweetness and see how they turn out.

These are delicious and so easy.  I whipped them up in under 10 minutes.  I made a couple of changes based on the ingredients in my house.  I did not have any white sugar (ahhh!!!).  I substituted it for another 1/4 of cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of condensed milk.  This seemed to work out just fine.  Also, my cornflakes were fairly stale, but that did not make any difference.  I will be keeping this recipe on hand for a quick and delicious dessert!

I can't say that these taste much like the candy bar but they sure are good!  Some reviewers said these ended up hard.  I cooked my mixture pretty much just to the point of boiling and boy are they chewy!  YUM!  I made a sling of sorts out of waxed paper for my pan so I was able to easily remove and cut the bars.

Considering the changes I made, these were mighty tasty cookie bars.  I substituted Special K cereal for the corn flakes, but then after starting, realized I didn't have enough Special K, so then I added in some Rice Krispies.  Even with the mix of strange cereals, it's hard to go wrong with this recipe, regardless of the cereal choice.  As others suggested, I did not add in the chocolate chips, but  melted them in the microwave and spread on top.  These were really good cookie bars and super easy to make (provided you don't let your 6 and 3 year old shell the peanuts and have to clean up the mess.  Just buy a can, lol.)

I agree that these do not taste like Baby Ruths, but like Watchamacallits - not a bad thing to me, since I love those.  I left out the peanuts.  This is a good recipe when you want to use up odds and ends of cereal in your cupboard, too.

I have to agree with whomever said they taste like the old Whatchamacallit bar, and not Baby Ruths.  They're very sweet - got mixed reviews in my household, but they were still gone in less than 2 days!

DELICIOUS! Brought these to work and they were gone in a matter of minutes. I don't think they taste like a Baby Ruth, however. They taste like that candy bar called "Whatchamacalit". I don't if anybody remembers those candy bars - they were one of my faves!

I cut back on the cornflakes per other reviewers to 5 cups.  It did not taste like a Babe Ruth bar at all.  It was just okay, but I will not make again.  FYI...if you cut back on the cornflakes, it would be good to cut back on the corn syrup as well.  I didn't do that and I think it would have been much better if I had.

These were good, but they did turn out kinda soggy. Not quite what I was looking for.  If I try these again, I will probably cook the mixture longer and add more cereal.  It was very easy to make, though.

These were very quick, easy and tasty. My only suggestion would be perhaps to sprinkle some chopped peanuts over the top before they set to make for a prettier looking bar. I would recommend these and will make them again.

Fast, easy and delicious.  I use milk chocolate chips.  I also substitute Corn Chex for the flakes to make them gluten free.  This probably gives them better texture too.

Well, they don't taste anything like Baby Ruth bars, but they're pretty good.  Next time I'm going to add a little extra peanut butter.  Also, some other reviews commented that these are very messy, something I didn’t find to be true.  If you follow the recipe as instructed and be sure to press the mass firmly down into the dish and allow it to fully cool, they cut very easily and hold their form well.

Great no bake dessert bar! Making it reminded me of rice krispies treats, but w/ chocolate n pb.  I made them for my fiance as baby ruth is his favorite candy bar.  He enjoyed them.   I took the advice of others and cute while warm.  Next time I will also decorate them as the kids didn't think they looked good.  Thanks for the recipe.  IL2C

Just not good!  Even used other suggestion of melting chocolate and topping with peanuts.   Never again. Tasted nothing like a candy bar.

These were really good.  I didn't have semi sweet chips so used milk. Also didn't have peanuts so used roasted unsalted almonds.  Because of the milk chocolate these needed melted chocolate on top to have a stronger chocolate presence. Also I imagine that peanuts would be even better than the almonds in this recipe.  I will try again sometime following the recipe as stated.  Very yummy.

What fun this recipe is. This is an awesome recipe.  Not too sweet if you don't mix the chips in the batter.  Just a thin layer of chocolate on top is all you need.

These are awesome. I dont put chocolate on them tho.. Way too sweet! Instead of 
pressing into a pan I form them into balls. So much easier than tryin to get them out of a pan that doesnt need to get dirty! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was even better than expected, given some of the reviews... I melted chocolate chips and spread them over the top (though 1 cup doesn't quite spread over the entire surface), and they turned out delicious and didn't look too bad either. I actually thought they DID come close to the taste of a Baby Ruth, but maybe it's been too long since I've had one. Anyway, a good recipe, not so super sweet as you might fear.

This recipe is really good!  My co-workers went crazy over it.  I did make one little change.  I didn't have any peanuts the first time I made it so I just used super chunk pb instead.  Turns out I acually like it better than addint the peanuts!I also spread chocolate over the top instead of mixing it in...it does look much nicer.

Very good!  And super easy!  Didn't have corn flakes so used Cheerios instead.  It worked fine.  As suggested by others I put the choc chips on top and melted them.  Husband loved them!!

My family loved these treats, though we didn't think they tasted like baby ruth candy bars, but were still delicious. We are our second batch this week. I took other viewers advice and put chocolate on top, and added M&M's to mixture. I would like to try Reese's pieces in them also. I had no problems getting mixture set up correctly and I added 6 cups corn flakes.

I didnt think these tasted much like the candy bar. That being said, they were very good, and everyone that tried it liked it, even those that dont care for peanut butter. I followed the recipe exactly, and had no problem with the bars getting hard. They were a tad bit crumbly but no big deal. I do agree with others though; these are tasty but not attactive.I probably wouldnt serve them to guest.

I made a few modifications to this recipe including: decreased the corn syrup to 1 cup; decreased the Corn Flakes to 5 cups; oil sprayed the 13X9X2 pan; cut into squares while they were warm but kept them in the pan to finish cooling then placed on wax paper to set.  I agree with a previous post that these taste more like Peanut Butter Rice Krispie Bars than a Baby Ruth bar.  They were not bad tasting though.  Recommend drizzling melted chocolate chips over the top vs adding them to to pot.  When  I added in the chips to the mixture they all melted.  I also 'over crushed' my Corn Flakes a bit so the bars looked a bit mushy.

Like most others, my bars crumbled a bit... but oh, were the crumbly bits delicious!  My husband loved these and has repeatedly asked for round two.  I might try adding more corn syrup for a greater gluey effect:-)

I didn't think they really tasted like Baby Ruth Bars, in fact, I thought they tasted very similar to peanut butter rice crispie treats. It was still very good, hence the rating. Mine did not turn out like the picture, when I added the chocolate in, it melted.

I thought these were fantastic!! I took the advice of some people here and reduced the cornflakes to 5 cups. They were SO good! I brought them to a cookie exchange and people just raved about them. They were so easy, too. 

I lined the pan with waxed paper and sprayed it with cooking spray before I spread it out.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

First bite and these def tasted like Baby Ruth bars.
I added 5 cups cornflakes and planned on adding 1 cup honey roasted peanuts-but I fell short in my supplies.  They were great anyway.  If you are looking to make something diff from your average cookie or are in a rush to make something quick and easy- these are def worth making with a great taste.

I made 2 batches for church coffee-hour last Sunday, and they were GONE in about 10 minutes!  Lots of raves from adults and kids alike.

Next time'll crush the corn flakes just a little, just to smooth out the texture a bit.

Fast, easy, delicious -- love it!

These are excellent and very easy to make!  I did use crunchy PB and saved the peanuts to sprinkle on top (be sure to press in while warm) for a nicer presentation.

Very good! Taste similar to the actual candy bar, but it has its own unique (and good!) taste. I would definitely make this recipe again!

Very easy to make.  Sweet and gooey.  Next time, I'm going to try making them with Rice Krispies instead of Corn Flakes.  The Corn Flakes seemed soggy or stale to me.

These bars taste great.  I don't think they taste like the candy bar at all though. I have to agree with several other reviewers about the appearance of these bars.  They're not very appealing, but I think I can improve on that.  They were very easy to make.  I will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't care much for these, I think because they were limp and didn't hold together well.  Seems like they need more cornflakes or something.  The taste was okay but just not my favorite.

Don't waste your time! This was very disappointing, the cornflakes turn out to be too soggy. It might be better with oatmeal or graham crackers? I took them to work and they didn't get any good reviews everyone likes the baseball bars better

This is a good chewy bar!  I made the bar with milk chocolate chips for a less intense chocolate taste, and then after I put it in the pan I covered the top with semi sweet chips and quickly heated the whole thing to soften the chips so they were spreadable and then let cool to make a hard chocolate topping.  The bars taste better with a good chocolate coating on the top (and it makes them much prettier)!

I'm sorry to say these didn't taste like the candy bar at all to me.  As a matter of fact, they tasted more like peanut butter bars than anything else.  However, they are VERY easy to make and I'm sure they'd be a real kid-pleaser.

I was in the mood for something sweet & peanut buttery, and these hit the spot.   They're quick, easy, delicious, and perhaps the best part, I don't even need to fire up the oven!  I left out the 1/2 cup of white sugar, and they were sweet enough and turned out perfect.

I made it without the peanuts (personal preference) and it was delicious! I left out the chocolate chips initially, then sprinkled chocolate chips on top after spreading in the pan. I put in the oven at 250 degrees for about 15 minutes, then spread the chocolate on top afterwards for a very good looking and delicious treat!

Really good, great for sweet craving. Ate some, froze some for  a later craving.  Could eat it all if  we didn't.

These are awesome.  So easy to make.  They are very rich so I cut them into pretty small pieces!  I have made these a lot - they do taste just like the candy bar.

This recipe yielded rock hard, impossible to cut (or bite!) bars that in my opinion tasted nothing like a Baby Ruth and were a bit grainy in texture from all the sugar. I added extra peanuts to the top after melting the chocolate and "frosting" the bars because that's what makes the candy bar so good.  I'll skip these and continue making Scotcheroos instead.  I've never left a bad review but this recipe just wasn't good to me.

To avoid rock-hard cookies like some reviewers have mentioned...
Mix the corn syrup and sugars.  Bring to a boil and boil for one minute.  Remove from the heat and stir in peanut butter until smooth.  Pour over other ingredients and press into the pan with a spoon or spatula.
...soft ooey-gooey goodness!

Great recipe.  I tweaked it a bit per other reviewers advice.  I only added 5 c. of cornflakes and used brown sugar for all of the sugar.  I cooked the sugar, syrup and peanut butter mixture until it was all thoroughly combined.  Mixed in the cornflakes and spread it into a pan that was lined with lightly grease aluminum foil.  Once they were almost cooled, I cut them into squares.  When they were cooled I dipped them into chocolate.  Very yummy!

These taste very similar to a scotcheroo. I took the advice of others and did not add the chocolate chips to the mixture but spread an entire 2 cups of melted chips on top (and I used milk chocolate chips instead). I thought it could've used a few more peanuts (I used dry roasted) and maybe the addition of some mini marshmallows would be nice.

I put this Babe Ruth Bar in my recipe folder in December when I joined allrecipes and I have been looking forward to making these. Just got around to the task this evening and glad I did. I whipped these together in about 12 minutes and ya gotta love those quickies... They were good but not great and they are Sweeeet though so one bar is plenty... Because they are a little messy probably best to enjoy these at home. I know some reviewers didn't care for the appearance and it's true they don't hold together 100% but they looked fine cut into the bars. Oh, I did use Milk Chocolate Chips which I almost always prefer over Dark Chocolate! My teenage son and his friend just devoured a few... and did request I make them again. I'll save my calories for something else however!

These were pretty unappealing to us, in all ways. They didn't hold together very well and just didn't look or taste great. I can appreciate the idea behind them, it just didn't work out for us.

Sold out first at bake sale! I needed to make something for a charity bake sale during a summer heat wave.  Clearly baking something in the oven was out of the question.  This no-bake recipe worked out great and was easy to make.  I formed these into individual size bars (about the size of a miniature candy bar) and placed them on wax paper on a cookie sheet and stuck them in the fridge to set.  Then I drizzled white icing over the tops to make them a little more appealing to the eye.  ;)  I wrapped them individually in saran wrap.  They were the first item to sell out at the bake sale!

Yay!  this is the first no bake bar cookie with cereal in it that I've made that didn't fall apart the moment I cut into it.  Now, granted, it did crumble a bit but that's okay.  Last time I made a bar cookie like this it fell completely apart and I was left with flakes.  Anyway, very sweet cookies and I was afraid the choc chips would melt--well, they did.  I'm not so sure about that bc I was envisioning chips throughout, but oh well.  Perhaps that's why it actually stayed together for me? At any rate, it worked.  I don't like the sweetness so much but I  bf liked them, so he can eat the rest.  He even complained they were a little sweet though. Thanks for the recipe!

Not as sweet as I thought they would be which turned out to be pretty nice. I sent these off in a care package to my sister in Iraq, it seems like these will travel well even if they really don't taste much like a Baby Ruth.

Did not have peanuts and did not miss them. These were inexpensive, quick, easy, and good.  To maximize the number of pieces I rolled them in bite size balls.

These were pretty good. A bit crumbly, so maybe I didn't let it cook long enough before mixing together - or maybe I should have covered them with wax paper in the dish and pressed them together tighter. Anyway, good chocolate and peanut butter flavor!

these were pretty good we used rice crispies instead cuz i didn't have corn flakes.  i also dropped them into cookie shapes instead of a bar to help if they got to hard.  they tasted good if not a bit chocolety.  the choco-chips melted for quite a while. but the kidos loved them

Wow!  I used up two 'healthy' cereals that my family wouldn't touch with a 10' pole and they gobbled up the cookies.  I used some high fiber O's type cereal and some high protein granola.  Very tasty - not low cal at all, but for my long hikes and bike rides, they're great.

Very easy, quick snack to make.  I used 5c. corn flakes and a 1/4 cup less white sugar.  I did not mix the choc. chips in because Babe Ruth bars only have choc. on outside.  So, I melted choc. chips and poured on top of mixture.  Then topped with some chopped butterscotch chips and chopped peanuts.  Yummy, but doesn't taste like Babe Ruth bar.

These are great for satisfying a huge sweets craving - just look at the ingredients! I haven't had a Babe Ruth bar, but these were very good. I used plain Cheerios instead of Corn Flakes, and I had no problem with the cereal getting soggy. The presentation wasn't too bad either! I didn't need to butter my baking dish and the bars were only slightly difficult to cut. I will make these again, but next time I'll probably cut down on the sugar (if not eliminate it completely). I'd also like to experiment with other add-ins: walnuts, grated coconut, oats...

These taste nothing like the bar from what I remember. They are so crumbly - I would definitely NOT recommend cutting them before they cool unless you plan to have a big messy pile on your serving plate. Not good tasting for the mess they made, though they are extremely easy to make. I used chunky peanut butter, 1/2 cup corn syrup and 4 cups cornflakes (which got all squishy and weird) for this, as recommended by various people.

If you generally like the Peanut Butter, chocolate, peanut combo, you will love these. As previously suggested, I used a little less corn syrup and milk chocolate chips (we prefer) and they are not hard as rock and really yummy!

Very good. I used four cups of crushed cornflakes, it gave the bars a smoother texture. These are very sweet - you may want to reduce the corn syrup a bit.

I have to agree with another reviewer.  I wasn't very impressed, but the young children loved them (hence the 4 stars).  But every adult agreed that they were way too sugary and sweet.  And it was difficult to mix, and I even slightly crushed the corn flakes like another reviewer.  Probably will not make again.

These don't taste like no Baby Ruth.  I have a peanut butter bar that has basically the same ingredients & easier.  My husband does want me to make one of the recipes again with the peanuts because I took suggestion & just used chunky peanut butter. He likes these, but it didn't do a thing for me.

I thought this recipe definitely tasted good.  I found it very difficult to mix as well as cut when mixtured had cooled in pan.  If I were to make again I would probably cut while it was still warm.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and used chunky peanut butter. I also replaced the 6 cups of cornflakes and white sugar with 4.5 cups of cinnamon toast crunch. It came out great. This is an excellent recipe for making something with kids and experimenting.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic.  I took the advice of other reviewers and also added 1 1/2 cups of peanuts.  I cooked the peanut butter/corn syrup mixture until it began to bubble, then removed it from the heat and mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  A definite keeper.  Brought them to work and everyone wanted the recipe.

I thought this was very good and easy.  My coworkers liked it a lot.  I am giving it 4 stars though, because I think it needs more peanuts, I would use at least a cup next time.  And the recipe didn't say it, but I would definitely crunch up the corn flakes next time, at least slightly.  I didn't crunch them and it kind of looks like chocolate covered corn flakes.  Taste is good though!

Made these with youth group kids who were pretty wound up and not too dilligent about measuring.  We tripled it to make a whole bunch.  They are so yummy!  We all made ourselves a little sick eating the "defective" squares : )  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!

Very simple and easy to make. You can definitely get the kids involved in this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly the first time, but will be "adventurous" next time and use a different cereal. I love how there isn't a lot of ingredients.

I don't think these bars taste like the candy bar; however, they taste great and are very easy and fast to prepare. I think I might increase peanuts to 1 to 1 1/2 cups. And what about omitting chocolate?

These don't seem to good (because I've never used corn flakes in a square)  but wow, they really flew when I brought them to work.  No one believed that there was corn flakes in them.  They were really easy to make and have a great flavor.

There is only one problem with these bars.I just cannot stop eating them! As an english young woman i have never had the opportunity to try a 'Babe Ruth' bar. Its no help for sticking to my weightwatcher diet thats for sure! Great recipe.

This recipe was good, but it wasn't the best thing I've eaten for dessert. I do like how it mimics the actual candy bar and how it's fast and no-bake. Great to make if you don't have a lot of time.

These cookies (actually more like candy) are great!  I made them for a meeting, and they were a big hit.  I didn't have enough corn syrup, so I used part honey, and that was very tasty.  I will definitely make them again.

Very easy to make.  My guests loved them.  I cut them up in small squares so people didn't think they were overindulging in sweets...people grabbed 3-4 each.  Good thing I doubled the recipe.

Okay this recipe was very easy, no cooking involved. but very sweet. I bring desserts into work and this one took a while to get eaten all up. I judge how good a recipe is by how fast it gets eaten.

This was a very easy recipe.  It turned out excellent. I LOVE chocolate and peanut butter and these satisfied my craving.  They are very rich so I only have to eat one at a time instead of the whole pan!

These were good, but not as good as I was expecting them to be.  I would have to agree with the other reviewers that their appearance isn't that appealing.  The crowd at the super bowl party wern't too into these.

What a great recipe!  Only problem ... I cannot stop eating it and when it's gone, I make some more (sooo fast to make).  I left out the peanuts and replaced them with mini marshmallows so that my 2 year old can eat them too.

Great - I've made these twice in the last four days! The second batch I varied and added almonds instead of peanuts. Very good, although a bit sticky.

I'm probably the only idiot who ended up with the following results but if there are more folks out there like me, here goes:  I had a lot of stray cereal and what not that the heated ooze never covered.  It didn't change the flavor any - YUMMY - but they weren't pretty with so much shrapnel left in the pan. I wouldn't serve them to guests.

This recipe was fabulous.  It was so easy to make.  I live in Canada and we don't get Babe Ruth bars here, but these bars were sooo good!  My husband and daughter loved them.  My in-laws were also over when I made them and they also loved them.  My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe.  Thank you Suzanne for a great recipe.

If you don't want to receive endless compliments, don't make this recipe.  This was an absolute hit with my in-laws (brownie points for me!) and my husband just loved them.  Even my picky 9-year old daughter ate more than 3 at one sitting!  These are extremely easy to make and use ingredients you may have on hand.  These are terrific cold!  You have to try them!
