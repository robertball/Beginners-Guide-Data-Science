I don't know if I will make it again.  It tasted good. But not so amazing that it would be on my rotating dish list. My Masala  spice was very past it's  use by date so I think it's flavor was much lighter then it would have been if I had used fresh Masala.  I used a splash of olive oil and instead of seasoning salt I used a 1/4 teaspoon of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and sea salt.  I baked them at 425 for  30 minutes.

I wanted to give these a 5 star rating, I followed the recipe exactly and they smelled delicious, but I didn't get the follow through on the taste...which was surprising because they were fragrant! My garam masala is approximately 2 months old, so I'm not sure why I didn't get the taste.

I sprinkled this spice mix all over some potatoe rounds and wow! I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love Masala and I love potatoes, so this was a match made for my tummy.

This is my first time trying anything with garam masala seasoning. It gave these potatoes just a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg taste. Definitely unique for white potatoes for me but good. In my neck of the woods hash browns are made with shredded potatoes. I chose not to shred because the recipe did not call for that but I did chop my potatoes into 1" pieces instead of 2". I substituted equal amounts of ghee, grape seed oil and olive oil for the canola. I never buy canola oil. They turned out great and the cooking time was spot on for the size I cut the potatoes. I am tempted to try these with a sweet potato - I think it would be delicious!

The flavor of the Masala is wonderful and even though it is spicy its not overwhelming. My family really enjoyed these potatoes. I give it 4 stars because for me it was a little confusing the width of the potatoes and the timing. I sliced the potatoes really slime because if they had been 2 inches thick they wouldn't have cooked enough with the timing suggested by the recipe. Next time I think I'll cube the potatoes. I'm making this again because the flavor is really good.
