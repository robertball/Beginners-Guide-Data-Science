This was tasty. I usually make Italian meatloaf so this was a nice change. I didn't have a gravy packet so I made a quick brown gravy. Also I found out that I was out of bread crumbs so just made my own and seasoned with garlic, onion, cayenne and salt.

Thank you for this delicious recipe.  the way I made meatloaf with tomato sauce had started to give me heartburn so I stopped making it.  Now we can have it regularly again.  this was quite tasty and I didn't change anything.

Allergic to tomatoes, so this recipe was very helpful, thank you! The meatloaf was tasty and moist, but the gravy packet sprinkled on top did not work out for me. My meatloaf came out of the oven with a powder coating still sitting on the top. Very unappealing. Would it work to prepare the gravy and pour on top? Or maybe I will just add the dry packet into the meat mixture instead.
Otherwise, very good - thanks!

I prepared the brown gravy mix and poured on top before baking instead of sprinkling mix on top and subbed onion powder for onions. Delicious recipe. My whole family loved it.

Made some moderations (onion powder instead of diced onion, omitted bell peppers & hot sauce). Let folks add their own hot sauce to their taste.

Left out the green peppers and hot sauce! Put in some meatloaf seasoning as well! Added some BBQ on top :) Wonderful! I will be making this again!

Made this last night and my boyfriend loved it. This was my first time making meatloaf. I also add a meatloaf season pack.

This is how I've always made meatloaf minus the gravy packet and hot sauce which I'm going to try next time.

Great meatloaf! I used a tomato and Vidalia onion dressing in place of the hot pepper sauce.  I also used 1 pound ground pork and 1 pound ground beef  and a pork gravy mix instead of the brown.  My picky father loved it!

A great meatloaf, especially for people who can't stand ketchup! The hotsauce gives it just enough zing to really make it.
