Excellent and a refreshing change from the usual cheese stuffing. I dropped a star because the manicotti should be cooked until just barely limp to help prevent splitting as they are stuffed. They will finish cooking in the oven.

Excellent! I made some minor changes.  I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic and used a jar of Spaghetti sause in place of the tomato sauce.

This recipe was really easy and had a good flavor. I gave it four stars because I made some changes.
The recipe called for 14 manicotti shells, but you really only need 6-7. As suggested by other reviewers, I cooked the shells until they were almost done to prevent splitting and I added 2 tsp. of minced garlic. This provided enough for three servings (2 manicotti each). I will definately make this one again.

Try this with 1 pound of ground beef, no green pepper and use a 28 oz jar of marinara or your favorite spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I have not tried it with the thyme but I am going to. Whatever you do, don't leave out the oregano. It is wonderful.

This was delicious!    Used a jar sauce(garden blend) and the other ingredients in recipe.  Husband loved it said I could make this every day of week.

Very good, but next time I will use jarred spaghetti sauce.  I found the tomato sauce a bit bitter, my 5-year old ate some after I scraped off the sauce.  I also added ricotta cheese to the filling.

Great recipe. I did add spinach to mine for a little more color, flavor and health factor!
