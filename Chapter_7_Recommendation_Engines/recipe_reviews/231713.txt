Excellent! Very creamy and the rice was cooked to perfection .  Followed the recipe very closely, just adding slightly more onion, used organic chicken broth , added NO  additional salt and everyone thought it perfect.  As a minimal salt user, I still find broth is salty, and this worked out just right.  Thanks Chef John, a hit as usual.!

Simple and absolutely delicious! I used my dutch oven instead of a skillet and I did not add any salt because I used salted butter and with the large amount of broth it just was not necessary. Perfect flavor and texture.  Thanks for another winner chef john!

This was delicious. I've never made risotto before and it came out great.  I substituted Arborio rice and it worked perfectly.  I don't think it needs as much salt though. Next time I'll just lightly salt the mushrooms and not add anymore after that.  I used low-sodium chicken broth as well.

Outta the park - what a wonderful dish! The simplicity and ease makes this a treat to be repeated. We had arborio in the pantry, but will invest in carnaroli soon. We had a lot of shallots on hand, so used them - and we had baby bellas, but next time will use whites for a "brighter" dish. Sweet Italian sausage and salad on the side, and a Crane Lake petite sirah....   Chef John, what an inspiration you are. Your blog site and videos give me great joy.

Made this last night and it was fantastic. I love risotto and make it often, but did not have time to be held hostage at my stove stirring and ladling last night.  I've used Ina's baked risotto in the past but came across Chef John's yesterday and decided to give it a try.  I made a few modifications based on what I had in the house...broccoli instead of mushrooms and added a bit of chopped garlic and white wine.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely perfect.  Loved being able to stick in the oven for 15 minutes and walk away.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks Chef John!

First time I've made risotto and this was it! I'd never even cooked with Arborio rice before. Despite my mistake with adding the heavy cream before putting it into the oven (oops!), it was the bomb! I have to say that because we are such a garlic-loving family, I had to add 3 or 4 minced garlic cloves with the onion. Lovely outcome! Just wonderful! This will be on the table at least 3 times a month! Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

I've made this twice now and we really enjoy it. My daughter loves risotto, particularly my own recipe, but this recipe is easier than mine and has turned out perfectly both times. This last time I taught her how to make it so now she can make it on her own. We added chicken, more garlic and peas to ours and there are never any leftovers in our family. Thanks for a great, fool-proof recipe.

Works quite well on the stove top, and with regular long grain rice.   We've had it twice, excellent both times.

Once again Chef John you have created a masterpiece! This risotto is as good as it gets.  I put this on our menu to go with our fresh fish and even our beef filets and it was BEYOND the rave.  All the diners LOVED the risotto.  Way to go!  Haven't tried it?  You should.

I have tried a number of Chef John's recipes and have found them to be dependable.  This one merits a review.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and the outcome was amazing.  The carnaroli rice is expensive, but worth every penny, considering this risotto is superior to that served in many restaurants.  Make this for company and enjoy the accolades.

Made as written,  with the addition of chopped garlic with the onion and used arborio rice.   This turned out creamy and delicious and saved a lot of the  constant stirring necessary with most rissoto recipes.   Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

I made this with what was around the house and it still came out great. Used jasmine rice, baby Bellas, green onion instead of chives and half and half instead of cream. It was still amazingly tasty.

Absolutely fabulous!   This recipe was so much easier than the standard method of making risotto.  Cooking it in the oven for part of time freed me up for doing other things to finish preparing my meal.  The rice was perfectly tender and creamy and had great flavor.   I used arborio rice instead because it is what I had in my pantry.   I also used my dutch oven because I didn't have an pan that was oven proof to 400 degrees. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Amazing recipe! I followed it exactly except I used Arborio rice because that's all we had.  It was perfect! My wife said it was better than hers! And she's a great cook! It's in our rotation and only I can make it now.

Just wonderful...absolutely loved it! Didn't deviate too much from the recipe; substituted light cream for the whipping cream and used arborio rice.  Cooked in a cast iron frying pan. It didn't need the 2 tbsps. of cream at the end and I didn't have chives. Turned out better than any risotto I have ever made before and so much easier. I will be making again and sharing the recipe with others.  Thanks so much Chef John!

WOOHOO!!
For being so inexperienced and never making anything like this before, it turned out awesome!
I watched the video over and over while making it, thank you Chef John for making it look so easy! I also learned a great tip, you can put tin foil over plastic handles on your skillet and it will protect them in the oven! Next time I will add a little more garlic, but overall, YUMM!!!!!

My first review ever and I had to because this is that good!  Made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly.  I’m a big meat eater but trying to eat at least one no meat dinner a week. My wife and I had this last night with a side of asparagus and I told her this could be in my top 10 dishes of all time.  Me, the carnivore!  At any rate, my saved recipes is crammed with Chef John ones because his are the best!!

We love this recipe! We make it at least once a month. I am unable to eat cheese or cream, so I just use more chicken broth or white wine, and my family adds cheese to their own servings. It is delicious even without the cheese and cream. Easy to make. Love it! Thank you, Chef John!!

This risotto was so wonderful.  It was my first time making a risotto and this was easy to follow and due and come out wonderfully.  Although that is usually true of all Chef John's recipes.  I did omit the cayane and I couldn't find the rice he mentions but used the standard standby risotto rice and it worked out great.  The mushroom flavor is superb!  We served it with steak and artichokes and made for a wonderful meal.

WOW! Nervous first time risotto maker but I am 100% a believer! This recipe was amazing and a lot easier than I expected. I followed exactly as is and made in my dutch oven which made it really easy and never stuck.  Had the leftovers in a bacon and egg scramble! Delicious!!

I tweaked a bit to what I had, but the concepts and oven tip I used, turned out perfect all family loved even my little 1 and half year baby too she loved even every tiny rice fighting over and she is very fussy eater but that's a fav :):), I didn't have stock at time but the chicken stock powder seasoning did just as well with water to substitute , with the black pepper etc as recipie, I found it didn't need the extra time after the oven or the Parmesan and extra cream it was sooo perfect and tasty as it came out and texture perfect and saucy,, just a note I added diced chicken to the sautéed onions then the white mushroom in this order in the begging and they came out perfect texture too :) thanks for this recipe Because I can be flexible with and think outside the box when need be :) Also u should eat right away for the sauce otherwise would dry out and not as cool,, enjoy right away :)

Excellent, as always from Chef John.  I omitted the cream and simply used more broth, as I did not have cream and was trying to use up some broth and use some of my plentiful chives.  It turned out very tasty.  I had no salt in my broth, so I used a cube of chicken bullion as the added salt.  I doubt I will make risotto using any other method moving forward.

Was trying to decide what to make as a side for my vegetarian daughter and voila! Chef John to the rescue again. She loved it! I added a little white wine and used half and half instead of cream as that is what I had and I used Arborio rice as I could not find carnaroli rice. I used home made vegetable stock. It was fabulous. Thanks Chef John. I will never slave over a pan of risotto again.

The only thing different I did was to change the chicken broth to organic vegetable broth. This is an excellent recipe and was a big hit for Sunday dinner along with Chef John's recipe for short ribs. Will make both again.

I have been a member of this site since it started, MacBook died and with it went all my passwords. Can't even remember the email I used back 10 years ago lol, anyways! Chef John, you are the only reason I stick around! Been making your recipes for years and have to say you are the best. Risotto and lasagna are staples in our house. Don't change a thing:) except cayan (hint, you only know it's Chef John if it contains cayan pepper.) Make this people! Then visit chefs page and make Greek lemon chicken. Go together wonderfully!

Used white button mushrooms instead of Crimini's! Shallots instead of yellow onion, used a bit more chicken stock than recipe calls for! Overall I would make it again, again and again!!

Introduced this to my light-eater boyfriend and laughed when he ate the rest of it in one night. I followed the recipe closely, using baby bellas, excellent parmigiano-reggiano cheese and I substituted fresh thyme.

Wonderful recipie and super simple, typically I avoid risotto due to the time required.  The only change was adding a bit of dry white wine with the broth.

This was excellent.  We didn't have any chives so used fresh green onions instead- this gave a bright, fresh, flavor to the dish. I sid end up adding an extra half cup of water at the end.  Simply delicious!!!!

Chef John's recipes just never disappoint. It takes several steps, none of them difficult, but the rich flavors of this dish are worth it! My grocery didn't have the carnaroli rice so I used arborio; mine took a little more time & liquid but it came out perfect. I served it with roasted chicken breasts, sautéed green beans & garlic roasted cauliflower (from this site). Will definitely make this again as side, main dish, and for guests. (FYI, the recipe doesn't provide for the sliced browned mushrooms you see in the main photo; if you want those you'll have to plan for them separately.)

Love, Love, Love this recipe.   I use Baby Bella's and tonight I even added cooked shrimp to the last step, making it a complete meal.  My daughter got a little crazy and added bacon also.  What an amazing dish this is.  I will share with others.

Delicious, but beware of using salt. Between the broth and the butter (if salted) and the mention of salt THREE times in this recipe , this wonderful risotto can become way too salty.  Maybe use just a pinch if necessary, but that is all.

Came out beautifully! I did substitute a quarter of a cup of broth [I had home-made lamb broth] with a quarter of a cup of cooking white wine.

The rice came out at just the right consistency!

This is the BOMB.  So, so good.  Have made it several times, once exactly as written.  I prefer to sub in a cup of mushroom stock and half a cup of white wine....risotto cakes fried up in butter with the leftovers makes the dish well worth the effort.

Recipe was terrific and the first one I've made from allrecipes.   Swore I'd never make risotto again because of all the tedious stirring, but  this is  recipe offers the perfect solution by placing the risotto in the over for 15 minutes.  Simple ingredients and directions made this dish one I definitely look forward to making again.

I loved this recipe. I like cooking but I've never made risotto. This risotto was so easy and it was ready to eat pretty quickly too. I used arborio rice because I couldn't find carnaroli rice anywhere. I used low-sodium vegetable broth because I'm a vegetarian. I forgot to add the Parmesan (and 2 TBSP of cream) at the end, so I just sprinkle the cheese on top each time before I reheat it. This keeps well in the fridge and actually tastes better the next day. This will definitely be on my regular menu, thanks!

This was delicious! I was just to the point of adding rice when I realized my jar of Arborio rice was empty. I had to make this with Jasmine Rice and it was still amazing. The mushrooms added the perfect flavor.

Another winner, Chef John! I made this the old school way on the stove top since I don't have an oven safe skillet and it turned out perfectly! I only made a couple of minor changes: 1) I used an entire onion as I never manage to use the last half of a used onion, 2) used Baby Bella mushrooms, 3) for the final liquid addition I used 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk, 1/4 heavy cream, and 1/4 cup stock, 4) used perhaps 1/4 to 1/3 cup of Parmesan, and 5) 1/2 to 1 Tbsp cream to finish. It tastes wonderful! Creamy and delicious and just perfect.

This is my second time making this and it was wonderful each time. My husband objects to the texture of mushrooms but loves the flavor. This time I omitted all of the mushrooms in favor of Classic Mushroom Stock made by More than Gourmet. I added this I diluted (it is a thick gel) right after coating the rice with butter. From there I followed the recipe exactly. It did not suffer in the least. It had great mushroom flavor without the mushroom bits that hubby dislikes. I love not having to devote the better part of an hour to stir the risotto. I will never go back to the old way again!

Yummy!  Lots of flavour and easy to make.  I followed this recipe exactly and I was very happy with the results.  It makes too much for 2 people, exactly enough for 3 people but wouldn't be enough for 4 people.  Next time I will make double the batch.  Really, really good.  I will make this again and again.

Thanks chef John for this fantastic risotto. I followed the directions exactly and my very first risotto turned out like a pro. The cool thing is that the 15 minutes in the over freed me up to finish the rest of my meal.

I was looking for a good risotto recipe that was yummy and easy to make and having tried some of chef John’s recipes in the past I figured that I was going to give it a try, so one of the only things that I have changed was the salt amount that was added and used Himalayan sea salt in stead of the white table salt. And I would have used a little more chicken stock, I used chicken stock in stead of broth because it ha?s a much richer flavor. And I added shallots instead of yellow onions gave it a different flavor, and I used shredded Parmesan cheese. I’m going to say that I’m very happy with how the risotto turned out minus the little under cooked rice but was really good in the end.

Made as directed except for subbing Arborio rice because that's what I had. Delicious. Even my husband, who's not a fan, finished a bowl. Company worthy.

Took to a Christmas Party, the main course of Roast Beef. It was a huge hit... I was actually quite proud of myself, thank you Chef John! 

I did not change anything other that the serving amount and adjusted as needed.  It was very easy and quicker  to make than I thought it would be. Absolutely delicious and I will make this more often.

There are more steps and babysitting than one might care for on a busy weeknight, but it was worth the work. Chef John might hate me, but this was even more delicious the next day, slowly warmed in the microwave with many pauses for stirring.

So very easy, so very delicious!  Can always count on Chef John.  Made exactly as written, but did have tosub Risoto for the Carnaroli rice (our small city groceries don't seem to carry the carnaroli).  Can't imagine the flavor was diminished by the  substitution.  Will definitely make it again!

This was delicious even though I made quite a few changes, I subbed the butter for oil, used leftover jasmine rice,  subbed chives for green onions, reduced the liquids, added flour to the cream and left out the parmesan. This still turned out great and I'd gladly make it again!

Wow! I'm almost speechless. Chef John is brilliant time and time again. Made this with regular white rice and it turned out wonderful.  The video was a perfect vehicle to show the consistencies of the sauce at all stages.  I just followed the vid until my pan looked like his.  Could not have been easier.  Thanks again, Chef John!

We had just ended a cleanse and wanted something vegetarian,  I was skeptical about making Risotto as a number of Top Chef contestants bombed this one. Chef John's recipe was straight forward, simple and tasty. So far I have made in twice and nailed it both times.

I added thinly shaved garlic - about 5 cloves (love it). I added it with the rice, at the same time and stirred it all in very well.

Another great recipe from Chef John! This was delicious. Packed with flavor! I did add/make minor changes. I used white wine in place of chicken broth on 2nd round of adding liquids. I added fresh parsley and some basil. I added some minced garlic while cooking mushrooms and onions. I added shrimp (i cooked the shrimp in some chicken broth before i started risotto and then set it aside). Lastly...i added a little Asiago cheese at the end with the parm cheese. It was so incredibly yummy! You can really do so much with this recipe!! I watched Chef John's cooking video a couple times before starting. I think that helped me. This was my first time cooking Risotto. I was terrified...but it turned out perfect. Just follow his instructions and you'll be alright!

I actually prefer to make risotto the old fashioned way, and this recipe worked like a charm on the stovetop.  The proportions of the ingredients are on point.  Great and versatile recipe!

I have never made risotto before.  Followed instructions and the rice was cooked to perfection.  Very flavourful.  Used salted butter and chicken stock so did not need as much salt to flavour.  Excellent!

This was great! I’ve never made risotto before but this was so easy. I think what helped is I had everything cut and measured before I started cooking. Will definitely make again.

Delicious!!!! I didn’t change a thing. I used salted butter and 1/8 teaspoon of salt for the whole recipe. I thought it came out perfect. Can’t wait to make this for my boyfriend tomorrow.

Love this!  One of our favorites!  Used arborio rice because it's what I could find and a mixture of mushrooms.  Will definitely make again and again!

Made as instructed with the exception of adding white wine. I added half of a cup in step 3. Worked well, but might wait until step 6 next time for a little more wine flavor.  Family raved about this dish! May try and add in some asparagus and shrimp next time as a main dish.

Awesome but I make it with orzo. So creamy and really delicious. Use organic chicken broth, half the butter and no additional salt. Love it!

First attempt and it was perfect! That's what I love!! 
Added  a  couple of dashes of garlic powder at the onion step and skipped the heavy cream at the end.  Thanks again for making me look good.

Gotta say, great risotto still requires love and patience!  I'm afraid my vacuum-sealed unopened package of arborio rice was probably quite far along  on the 'dry rice" spectrum, as it stood on my shelf a short age before employing. Thus, even following directions, it required about 4 cups of broth to reach al dente and even though I browned the mushrooms amply, by the time all that stirring and waiting was done, their crispy edges were pretty much disguised by the prolonged contact with liquids, so not as stand-out in looks as the photo!  Even so, the rich flavor was there. I don't care what method is used, risotto takes a chance one's ability to coax the admixture judiciously  through the whole process.

I was impressed with the outcome. I made just a few changes:  Added a small clove of GARLIC finely chopped, 1/2 cup WHITE WINE, and extra shakes of Cayenne Pepper.    I added about 1/4 tsp salt because I used unsalted butter and unsalted stock.   
At the end, the rice on the stove top was not quite cooked, so I put a cover on the pan, turned off the heat, and left it for 15-20 minutes before adding the parmesan and chives.  I would make this again.

This first-time risotto maker was pleased with the outcome ... used Arborio rice, added a 1/4 cup white wine to the mushroom cooking and forgot to add the Parmesan at the end - still tasted great.

So good. Made this dish a couple of times now. Never disappointed. Such rich flavors. It's supposed to be 4 servings but to be honest I could never eat just 1/4th of this dish. It's a bit sad that you cannot really scale up this recipe to serve a larger number of guests.

Made as written except subbed 1/2 c white  for chicken stock and added 2 minced garlic cloves. A great way to cook risotto when short on time.

I have made this recipe about fifty times because my husband can't get enough. It is a VERY good recipe. I use arborio rice instead, however.

I love ordering Risotto when I go out to dinner.  I now can make the same delicious risotto at home and everyone loves it!  It is fairly simple to make and it goes with steak or chicken.  A delicious dish all around

I have made this exactly like Chef John in the video twice now. My husband and I love it. It will become a weekly meal.
