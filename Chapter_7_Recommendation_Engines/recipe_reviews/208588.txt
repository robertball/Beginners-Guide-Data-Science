Great recipe!  Very easy, and can look really impressive.  I used 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, warmed in a sealed sandwich bag.  I heated it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, snipped of the corner, and drizzled.  It was much easier to control than using a spoon.  Also, I halved mini peanut butter cups and fanned them out along the edge.  So awesome!  Next time I might add a few chopped pb cups into the creamy filling, but it's super-delicious this way as well.

Personally, I did not like it - but the rest of my family really did.  My only recommendation is to use more peanut butter than the recipe calls for.... The pie looked really great & was super easy to make.... I guess it's just not my taste.

Sooo good!  I only had a shortbread pie crust, so I used it, and it still tasted great, but Oreo probably fits the recipe better.  I added chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cups to the mix, and sprinkled more on top of the pie.  Instead of doing the chocolate topping as in the recipe, I just drizzled chocolate ice cream magic shell and melted peanut butter in a criss-cross pattern.  Looked great, and my girlfriends polished it off in one sitting :)

I made this for my Mom's birthday and it was a big hit with everyone that tried it. I was asked for repeatedly for the recipe. It was so easy to make, I'd make it again just for dessert. For the peanut butter drizzle, I would encourage people NOT to microwave the peanut butter in a plastic bag as recommended by another post (microwaving anything plastic is bad) but microwave the peanut butter in a glass and transfer it into the plastic bag  afterwards, if you want the control of an icing bag.

This was pretty good, however it was way to sweet for my family which is why I rated it 3 stars.  If I were to make this again in the future I'd leave off the chocolate topping as I feel this is what put this over the top on sweetness.

Yummy!!! If you want the chocolate shell on top of the pie like in the picture, don't melt the chocolate with whipped cream. Just pour melted chocolate over the top : )

My family and I liked this pie, but I would have preferred it w/out the chocolate coating.  The peanut butter pie itself was fabulous.  I just thought it was too rich w/ the topping.  I did make it w/ a graham cracker crust, but think it would've been good w/ the Oreo chocolate crust.

Excellent! My family loved it! I might just try to add a bit more cream cheese next time to have more of a cheesecake taste! But it is great just the way it is too!

I thought this recipe was really good. Like many others, I added more peanut butter than it called for and I used almond bark for the topping and didnt mix it with the whip cream. I will definitely make this again.

very tasty, easy to make... and was was able to make as a last minute Easter dessert from what I already had in the house.  Went over well with all who tried it.

If you don't enjoy a Reeses peanut butter cup, you won;t like this pie. As for me, Reeses is my favorite, and this pe is just like one big Reeses peanut butter cup! :) It is Soooo good! I substituted the milk for whipping cream. It made it so much more creamier, and it also set up very nice in the fridge.
