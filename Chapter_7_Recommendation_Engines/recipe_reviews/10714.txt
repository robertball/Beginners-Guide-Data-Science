Ok - Main reason why I used this recipe is because I needed a cookie, but I had no chocolate or butter and wanted to use what I had on hand instead of running to the store.
So....I used unsweetened cocoa with oil instead.
(3 Tbsp Cocoa + 1 Tbsp oil or butter = 1 oz Unsweetened Chocolate)
I didn't have egg substitute so I used 2 eggs instead.(I only made 1/2 a batch) 
I placed batter in freezer for about 45 minutes and rolled the cookies good in the powdered sugar, and baked- they are great!

This are really pretty simple and a great chocolaty flavor without seeming really rich and fatty. Will definitely make these again when I have unsweetened chocolate to use. Don't overbake...they harden up as they cool
