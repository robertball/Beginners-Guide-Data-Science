I made these for my family and they gobbled them up!  I cooked them on cookie sheets with cookie spray and allowed them to cool on the pan for 3-4 minutes.  They are chewy, so taking them off with a metal spatula is highly recommended so they don’t break.  Delish!  Will definitely make again!

These cookies will spread. However, they are delicious! Here’s what I did to minimize spread. Chilled the dough overnight, rotated the pan halfway through baking, and I let them rest on the pan for 3-4 minutes before removing them with a metal spatula.

The flavor is 5 star, but for the cost of all the ingredients the fact that they spread all together is very disappointing.  None of the other reviewer mentioned this.  I used parchment on my favorite cookie sheets with a 1 T cookie scoop.  I was so sad to check on them after just 8 min to see that I no longer had 20 cookies.  The next sheet I put them farther apart and the same thing happened.  On the last sheet I had dough for 7 cookies and the same thing happened.  IF I try these again, I might just a few in the oven and if they spread like they did today I'll put the rest in a 9X13" pan to make a bar cookie, then I'll throw away the recipe.

Made per recipe.  Absolutely the BEST cookie I've ever had! However,  next time will add pecans--a southern thing. LOVE 'em!!!.
