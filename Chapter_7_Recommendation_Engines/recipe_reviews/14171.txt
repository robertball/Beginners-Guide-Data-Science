Thank you so much. At the last minute I was searching for a fruit salad or something to for a cookout on the 4th and this was it. Easy inexpensive and great! EVERYONE loved it. I mean it. And I am not a cook/chef/baker/ or a salad maker. And it went over very well. I made a batch for 20 servings which made a ton and i didn't bring too much home.:) Thank you Stephanie. I will definitely make this again and again.

When I make this I add 1 cup of mini marshmallows and use Snickers instead of Baby Ruth's. The kids love it.

We had this recipe at a campout. They didn't have baby ruth and used reeses peanut butter cups instead. It was very delicious and the kids asked me to make it again...even 6 months later!

I made this quick healthy dessert for my in-laws and they loved it. Next time I will try adding seedless grapes to the mix.

I used snickers and added vanilla pudding to the whip cream. I also sometimes add bananas and mandarin oranges. Very Tasty!

This is a good salad but we felt it lacked the wow factor. Thought it needed something else added to it - just not sure what.

Everyone loved it at our last family get together. The only complaint was that I didn't make enough(we ran out quickly). Definately a new family favorite! Thanks.

I made this for my family reunion and my family just loved it! My 3 year old loves to help me make this and eat it. Very kid friendly.
