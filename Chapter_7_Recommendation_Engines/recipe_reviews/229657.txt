Absolutely delicious. I couldn't get a half turkey breast so I used two large chicken breasts. That was so good I may forget the turkey. :)

Absolutely delicious.  My whole family loved it.  I used a 6+ lb turkey breast and doubled the ingredients.  The only thing I would do differently is use low-salt soy sauce because it was a little saltly.  I am absolutely going to make this again.

Words cannot describe the tenderness of this turkey. Better than any Thanksgiving turkey I have had. Pair it with mashed potatoes for a quick yummy meal. Dont forget to save some of the gravy for those potatoes!

My turkey breast was about 5.75 pounds so I doubled the spice mixture and put it on high in my crockpot for about 4 hours.  It made tons of very flavorful juice.  I used my quick read thermometer and it read 165.  It was done PERFECTLY and so moist even my picky non-turkey eating hubs loved it!   I turned the crockpot off and left it in there until the rest of the meal was done.  I strained the juices into a pot and mixed in the packet of gravy that came with my turkey breast from Target.  It made the most wonderful gravy and the flavor was outstanding.

i was apprehensive of this recipe. i managed to buy the last philly cream cheese with garden veggies at publix, (seriously.) i cooked an hour on high then @ 7 hours on low. i used the whole container of cream cheese and doubled all other ingredients for my 6+ lb. turkey breast. it's still moist 3 days later.

We went to friends’ for Thanksgiving this year so we had no leftover turkey for sandwiches, which Hubs and I both love.  So I decided to give this a try.  My turkey breast half weighed just under 2 1/2 lbs, but I made the entire amount of butter/cream cheese mixture.  I put it liberally on both sides of the turkey breast and cooked it on high for 2 hrs. and 45 minutes, which in my crock pot was just a bit too long.  Next time I will start checking it at 2 1/2 hours, if not sooner.  This was good, but I’m not sure I liked the cream cheese in this.  I like making a turkey breast in a crock pot, but next time I think I will just season it with Sarah’s Dry Rubbed Chicken seasoning, also on this site.

I tweaked just a little bit - I threw some slabs of butter under the skin - they didn't have whipped veggie cr chs, so used whipped chive instead - dbl'd all other seasonings - used a 6lb turkey breast....put the spread on the bird the night before and threw it in the crock pot it a small amt of low sodium chicken broth in the bottom - threw it in the next morning and cooked on high for close to 6 hrs but didn't need that long - trying to get the darn bird out of the crock pot, it basically imploded it was so tender - FELL APART - no carving necessary!  extremely tender and juicy even after it cooled and reheated next day - this will be our standard Thxgiving recipe from now on.  holy yum

Ok this is my third time making, 2nd review.  Today is an 8.5lb bone in breast.  Thus, I 4x everything in the recipe except Parsley & Thyme because I ran out of both so subbed the difference with Herbs de Provence and only 3 TBS of Soy because I try and watch the sodium.  I again mixed all with a mixer to 'whip' as I don't believe Philly makes whipped garden veg cheese (at least in my area, we only can find regular garden veg).  4x may have been extreme as this breast was loaded up with the heavenly cheese/butter mixture to the point I felt a bit guilty.  I'd say I'm discarding about 1/4 cup.  I'm also using a Slow Cooker Liner this time and going for 2 hours on high, then 6 on low and then I'll warm it till dinner time as I got this going at 9am.  I also have another tub of the cream cheese which I will add to the mash potatoes as that worked quite well last time.

A hit with my son, 19! I had to use bone-in chicken breasts which were a little over 4 lbs. So, I adjusted seasonings. My grocery store also didn't have whipped garden veg. cream cheese, so I bought the regular and then whipped it with a little water to get the same texture first. I served with jasmine rice and broccoli for a hearty and very easy meal. I couldn't follow the recipe exactly, but you can tell when you are starting with a 5-star recipe!

That was wonderful! Will definitely make this again. I didn't have any cream cheese so I just used cottage cheese. It worked well in a pinch. Otherwise I made it just as written.

Loved this! My husband is a restaurant manager and when I made this for Thanksgiving dinner he told me that this is better then the turkey the restaurant served (and he raves about that turkey). Yum!

I was pretty skeptical about using cream cheese on a turkey breast but since I was having a very small Thanksgiving gathering and there was going to be tons of food, I decided to give it a try just for fun.  I made the turkey exactly as the recipe stated--just doubled everything for a six pound whole turkey breast--and it turned out great.  I have to say that when it is in the crockpot, it does not look very appetizing, but the end product is super.  It is juicy, flavorful and very easy.  I will be making this for supper again soon!

All I can say is fantastic! Followed the recipe but didn't have cream cheese, so just used butter. Still to die for. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Excellent! It was so easy! Tripled for a 8+ lb turkey and was definitely the most moist flavorful turkey I have ever had! Everybody had the same consensus... I also made Easy Turkey Gravy recipe with the drippings which was excellent too. You actually don't need need the gravy for the turkey it ended up on the potatoes...

I've made this 3 times so far & it's a hit every time! I bought an herb soaked turkey breast so needed only regular cream cheese. I use low sodium soy sauce & dried parsley if I don't have fresh. We love it so much we are thinking of making two for Thanksgiving this year instead of the Spanish recipe we've used for years. Be sure to use a crockpot liner too. Makes cleanup a snap.

Slow cooked a 7.25lb for 9 hours and then put the whole pot in the oven on broil for 4 minutes to brown the skin. So good!!

Absolutely delicious and tender!!!  I had 4 turkey cutlets to use up, so I used those instead of a breast and had wonderful results.  I set the crock pot to low and let it go for about 2 hours, and that was plenty of time - an hour and a half might have been sufficient, actually (since the cutlets were only about an inch thick).  I had plain whipped cream cheese on hand, so I used that along with the suggested herbs.  I feel it was maybe a bit too "herby" for me, so I may cut back a bit next time, note that I was using all dry herbs instead of fresh, so that could be why.  The meat was extremely tender, and I almost always overcook my meat and make it tough - so I was elated!  I sauteed some onion, celery and mushrooms in a small pan with butter and oil, added a TBS of flour, and then the leftover drippings from the crock pot along with some chicken broth to make a great gravy.  I'm excited to try this recipe again with an actual turkey breast and the vegetable cream cheese, I think it would be even more spectacular.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good for a crock pot meal. Super easy to make. Usually we smoke our turkey, and while that can't be beat it is a ton of work. This was easy and healthy. I usually don't like chicken in the crockpot so I was surprised at how well this turned out. Thanks for sharing. Used a 6.5 pound breast. Regular cream cheese and some other spices. Took @4 hours on high for meat probe to register 180. Then it stayed on warm 2.5 hours.

I made this for pot luck at work today (yes, we work on Thanksgiving).  Everyone really liked it. I added just a pinch more of the seasonings to help with the flavor. I did use a 6.5 pound turkey breast and it was done in 6 hours (on high). It was a bit dry but now I know to cook it a little less and maybe, invert the breast so the breast meat is in the juices as it cooks...Very good

Good flavor (although mild) but dry.  I did 8 hours on low. I think next time I will try 7 hours and perhaps some broth in the bottom and/or double the cream cheese mixture.  I did spread it both under and over the skin but there wasn't enough to cover the bottom.

Ok this was soooooo easy and soooooo good!  I made it for a friend with a lame arm so she wouldn't have to cook. Whipped it together, through it in the crock pot and left the house. I got a text later that day that her husband who never touches stuff like that are two huge helpings!  Put it over rice and it was the best turkey he had had. I made it for my family the following week and yeah, it was amazing. Will absolutely make again. I subbed a large boneless turkey breast as I could find a bone-in half breast. Yummmmmmmm!

I tried this recipe today and it was a total hit. My kids devoured it. I did make a couple of changes due to lack of ingreadients. I used crumbled goat cheese instead of cream cheese and I used chicken bouillon instead of soy sauce. I also poured chicken broth in the bottom of the crockpot for some added liquid. Cooked as directed and used the broth on the bottom as gravy (just thickened a bit with flour). Super easy and delicious and healthy!!

This recipe is a keeper.  I followed the recipe except I added a cup of chicken broth because I like a lot of gravy.  The turkey was moist and delicious.  Excellent for sandwiches for a few days.

I didn't change a thing!  I am a dark meat lover because the white meat dries out so quickly.  NOT with this recipe!!!  Super tender white meat!  I cooked it on slow for 9 hours.

Delicious!! I would definitely double the sauce and cook on the low setting for as long as you can. Adding more sauce helps with basting during cooking! I will never cook a whole turkey again!

I've made this before and it was so good I'm making it again. I'm using a 7.82lb turkey breast and cooking it 8-10 hrs on low, just like last time. The mixture was so yummy tasting, I can't wait to eat it again tonight! My husband & kids raved last time so I followed the recipe to a tee, except I add about a tsp of chopped rosemary. It's so easy to prepare, u have to try it! Very moist!

Great recipe, although the conflicting reviews on cooking time was not helpful, so I will add my two cents. I cooked a fully-thawed 3 lb Butterball boneless turkey breast in the crock pot on high....4 hours is the best approximate time. Don't raise the lid before 3.5 hours to check the temp, it will only extend the cook time. If you get caught and everything else you're cooking is about ready, xfer the turkey to a dish and put in the oven to finish off, until you get a 165 temp reading. Excellent recipe, except for the confusing cook times per pound. And, if the turkey reaches temp before your other dishes are done, I think if would be fine in the crockpot on Warm for 60 min or so. Good luck!!!

The ingredients sounded a little weird to me so I was slightly hesitant, but I like trying different combos & boy was this a hit! My boyfriend even liked it better than his mother's! It was moist & full of flavor. This will be my Thanksgiving turkey recipe from now on!

This turkey is moist and juicy. I used an almost 5 lb. turkey breast so I doubled ingredients for the rub using low sodium soy sauce. It was done in a little less than 5 hours on low. I removed the excess herb mixture and rubbed the breast with browning liquid....it was perfect!

I used this recipe on turkey chops and the flavor was amazing. I did coat the turkey with the herb mix and allowed it to marinade. My picky 8yr old even loved it.

Used a 5 1/2 pound turkey breast for Thanksgiving and followed the directions exactly.  It was wonderfully moist, had great flavor and everyone loved it!  Not many leftovers--just enough for a couple of sandwiches today!

this works well, and turns out quite moist meat, but not terribly flavorful, as the name implies. Seems that all the spices fall off the turkey and into the bottom of the crock pot with the juices. I think the spices need to be placed more inside the turkey carcass.

I was not actually home, when this was done, I had a meeting, but everyone LOVED IT!!  There were claims on the small turkey dinner, etc.  If my fam loves it, it was a great recipe!!  I LOVED how easy it was to assemble, and can't wait to enjoy it myself, everyone wants it in the rotation!!

Delicious - moist and flavorful turkey breast for small family meal. My finicky son had several helpings! Sides of mashed potatoes, peas, stuffing, sweet potato, gravy completed meal. After dinner, put all leftovers together in slow cooker for 'seconds' later. I had an empty cooker pot to wash later!

I rarely review anything. I’ve made this several times and it always turns out great. I double the sauce for mashed potatoes. I’ve used chicken breasts (bone-in with skin) when I can’t find turkey breast.

I left out the Soy sauce and Cream cheese spread.  Added I large Granny Smith Apple, fresh parsley and two cut up celery stalks and stuffed in the Turkey cavity.  Added baby carrots, sliced onion and cut up celery in the bottom.

This was the most tender I have had for turkey!  We weren't able to do a full Thanksgiving, so I tried this as a back up later in the month.  I prepared the turkey breast by the recipe and cooked on high for 2 hours; I drained the juices and set aside for gravy.  Next I put stuffing around the edges of the turkey in the slow cooker and cooked on low for 3 more hours.  Perfect amount left over form sandwiches the next day!

Made it as written and cooked on low for 8 hours. There was plenty of sauce to use as gravy for the meat and the mashed potatoes I served alongside. Quick and tasty!

This was delicious! Definitely going in to my favorites folder.
I did not have the cream cheese so I used ranch, and I add 1/4 cup of parm. cheese. I also poured 1/2 cup of white cooking wine in the bottom of the crock pot, and sliced (long ways) two leeks and placed them on top of the turkey... YUM!

Delis! It turns out so soft! If I can, I use fresh ingredients and smashed fresh garlic. I use plain cream cheese because that's all I have where I live, and still is delicious. I make this every time I have a special occasion. Thanks for this recipe!

The ONLY way I'll cook turkey from now on!!!  I used turkey breasts with this recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  Of course, the cooking time was reduced, but because of some scheduling issues with the other dishes (my kids helped), I had to keep the crockpot on the Warm setting for a couple more hours--This turkey was STILL moist, tender & delicious!  I hate turkey, but loved this!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe =)

I made this for Thanksgiving, I used a 7.8 lb bone in turkey breast, just doubled the ingredients and let me tell you it was delicious!!! So moist and juicy and the aroma in the house while it was cooking was heavenly, this was the first turkey I ever made and for it to be on Thanksgiving I was extremely nervous, but not anymore, I would highly recommend this recipe!!!

I used wild turkey. I used the recipe in the instant pot. 45 minute cook time.

After reading the reviews, I wanted to live this turkey. Unfortunately, it was just ok. I did not find the meat to be especially moist. But, my husband thought it was very good. Won't make again.

I couldn't find cream cheese with vegetables mixed in, so I used regular cream cheese and chopped up a carrot and celery stalk.  This is a nice uncomplicated recipe that is well-utilized when turkey breast is on sale, but wasn't the most exciting thing I've ever made.

The turkey was very dry and the skin was gross and soggy.

I followed the recipe exactly as they are written and it did not turn out like the picture at all. Maybe I misunderstood something in the recipe. The picture shows the turkey in foil? Anyway, not sure why but this recipe did not work for me.

Not sure why I didn't get the results everybody else got.  I followed the recipe, even doubled the seasonings and the turkey was still sort of bland.  It was also dry.  Didn't fall apart like others described.

Delicious and flavorful!  I used a boneless turkey breast, so it wasn't as moist, but still very good.

I LOVE this DISH!!!! I cooked it in the oven under 425F for 2 hours, because it was a last minute dinner plan and it was great! A little dry because I rushed it be the flavor was still fabulous! Will be making again!

Everyone loved it!  Will definitely be making it again.  The gravy this turkey makes is especially yummy!

This was a hit with the whole family.  Only gave 4 stars due to dryness...was expecting deliciously moist turkey based on the other comments here, but was not.  Will try again though.  Added a bit of chicken broth to the bottom, other than that followed the recipe.

Excellent.   I doubled the herbs but everything else I measured as recipe stated.
