I was reading some of the reviews, and I notice some were expecting a fluffy Mexican rice. Well coming from a Mexican I cook rice about twice a week. So what u want to do is, rince your rice under water till water goes clear, then you want to saut√© the RICE first!  Juat make sure u don't let it get brown. Remember this is white rice... Before it beggings to turn light golden brown you can add your vegt. And everything else. and yes milk will make it sticky.

This is very good rice, I was a little unsure about the milk.  However it made the rice very creamy and delicious!  Nice change for us.  Thanks for sharing!

Standard operating procedure when cooking white rice is 2 cups liquid for every cup of rice. I think 1 cup of water was left out by mistake in the recipe. The rice came out a little creamier than what my family likes but the flavor was spot-on and I appreciated all the veggies in it. Next time I will eliminate the milk and use 2 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of Adobo Seasoning Salt.

This is not bad, but I must say - Mexicans do NOT cook like this, so really it's not fair to call this "Mexican rice."  What you want to do is rinse the rice, then sautee it in some vegetable or olive oil until it starts to become brown. Add the vegetables (Try before the rice gets too brown, so it doesn't burn), and you can use water and chicken stock / broth, one or the other or both, if you wish. Milk is not used to make savory rices, it makes it sticky. Save the milk for when you make arroz con leche. ;-)

Loved this! Creamy, colorful and tasty, this was a welcome alternative to the traditional tomato-based Mexican rice.  Hubs and I are not big fans of cooked carrots, but because I wanted the color it lends, I substituted orange bell pepper instead. It, along with the poblano peppers, peas and corn, made this "confetti" rice very visually appealing. I also gave the rice a pinch of saffron for added color and flavor, tho' it wasn't necessary and certainly no criticism of the recipe.  A great accompaniment to our Grilled Tequila-Lime Shrimp and Easy Grilled Zucchini, both recipes also from this site. I would make this again in a heart beat.  My only criticism is that it needs salt and pepper, big time!

I thought the flavor was very nice. I also liked all the veggies the recipe calls for. HOWEVER my only complaint is that it wasn't fluffy like i would imagine Mexican rice should be. I think maybe substituting more water for the milk may do the trick. If it came out fluffy and not so 'wet' this would be amazing. I will definitely be making this again though, just eliminate the milk and see if that helps. Thanx for the recipe :)

Used frozen peas and carrots and a jalapeno pepper in place of the poblano. Turned out nicely, although I didn't use the milk.

This recipe was extremely simple, and I will definitely use it again.  Sauted all of my vegetables first, then added the rice to toast before adding liquids.  Opted to add in some additional spices (paprika, chipotle, garlic, mexican oregano, ancho chilis) to give it a kick, and it really balanced well with the sweetness of the carrots, peas, and corn.  I'm not exactly sure if the addition of milk added something extra or not...I honestly did not notice a taste, texture, or consistency difference from when I only use chicken broth.

Very good.  I was short on liquid - rice adhered to side of pan; next time I'll add a little more.

I followed the recipe and found my rice to be on the creamy side. If I make this again, I will season it with salt and pepper and skip the milk.

KitchenDiva- There is plenty of liquid for the recipe. 1 cup water and 1 cup milk, which follows general procedures. This rice turned out well for me.

This rice is really good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I fried the rinsed rice in a tablespoon of oil for several minutes as another reviewer suggested, then added the carrots and cooked a few more minutes and then added all the other ingredients.  It was very tasty.  I will definitely be making this again.  And it will go into my printed recipe book of our favorite recipes.  It's a keeper.  Had poached salmon with it last night and tonight will have leftovers with chicken and gravy.  This rice goes with so many different kinds of foods. My family really liked it.  Thanks for posting it Tequila.

This was very good. I didn't have the poblano pepper so I subbed with a little crushed red pepper. Served with ground beef enchiladas II. I would make this again but with the poblano pepper. The milk Wss a nice touch.

This is great rice!  I did make some changes which might be kind of cheating but I used Minute Rice (sorry!), diced habanero and two diced poblano peppers.  I followed the liquid exactly and used two cups of the rice.  I added the veggies as listed and a little seasoning salt at the end.  This was super tasty and a great side dish.  Maybe add a little protein and make it a main dish.  The rice was tender, only slightly creamy and a little spicy.  Definitely a keeper!

Turned out pretty well.  Didn't have a problem with it sticking or being "creamy".  Lacked a little in flavor though, so may add more spices next time.  :)

Made this as side dish with Enchiladas.  Perfect with lots of compliments.  Only used corn and peas.  Didn't miss the carrots but would have been good.  Added a little garlic powder.

I made this tonight and paired it with a shrimp recipe from another site, and as suggested, this recipe goes decently with fish or shellfish.

Also goes well as a side with fajitas!

I really, REALLY, enjoyed this rice dish.  I make a similar rice dish, but this is way better.  It had a subtle sweetness that I suppose came from the milk or perhaps the sweet onion that I used.  It was the perfect side for some beer-batter fish.  I used frozen mixed vegetables that I wanted to use up, and didn't rinse the rice--just lazy.  I did add a tsp. of white vinegar because that's something I add to every pot of rice I make.  It adds a little brightness without adding any specific flavor.  Since I used frozen vegetables, cut back on the water a tad because frozen veggies are full of water.  Except for the frozen veggies and vinegar, followed recipe exactly.  Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes prior to fluffing and serving; and topped with some freshly ground black pepper.  Some chopped green onions on top would have been good, too.  Recommend using frozen peas, as canned are too mushy.  This will be my new  Mexican white rice recipe from now on. Easy and Yum!

This rice came out so delicious and it was so simple to make. Believe me, I'm a major newbie. My mom doesn't make white rice at home so I searched for a recipe here because I wanted to make a rice that would go with "albondigas," a Mexican meatball dish, this was the perfect rice for it. I added chile poblano to it instead of carrots and peas but the rice itself came out moist and delicious. Try it!

This is the second time I've made this rice and it really is very good! I made exactly the original recipe the first time, second time I added Sazon seasoning and liked it even more.  There was a bigger flavor to the rice which even my husband likes!

I loved this!  I changed it a little based on the ingredients I had available.  I skipped the onion and the milk, used 2 cups of water and added one bay leaf and some parsley.  It came out great!

My only complaint on this was it made a mess of my pot. I cooked it on low, because that's what work for rice on my range. I only had skim milk so used it for the whole milk and water. I didn't find it creamy like others, so I don't think you'll get that if you fat free milk like I did. I also used frozen peas and corn and added them after sauteing the other veggies. That was simply for preference, we like the texture better that way. There isn't really any seasoning in this but it would be easy to add any number of herbs/spices to fit it to your meal.

Really few Mexican groups make the rice so, it's nice it find a legitimate recipe for it on this site.

We loved it!  So delicious.  I used frozen 'roasted' corn from Trader Joes that enriched the flavor even more.
