This cake is very yummy and very sweet.  I gave it 4 stars because it does not cook fully if you follow the recipe.  I left it in the oven and told my husband to take it out when the timer beeped... not knowing how to cook, he didn't realize the whole middle was still raw.  The edges taste fantastic though... I will definitely make this again but up the temp to 350!  Thanks!

I first tried this recipe when my coworker brought it in for work. It was delicious, so I made it for my dad's bday. However, before attempting to make it, I noticed that all the cakes looked ugly...like an earthquake had hit it, and the cake my coworker made had the cheesecake filling in the middle (like the picture posted by allrecipes). Therefore, when I poured the cake batter in the pan, I reserved 1/2 of it. Add the cheesecake filling by spoonfuls, cafefully spreading it to make a nice layer, and finishing it off with the leftover cake batter. It cooked longer than stated, but turned out delish while looking beautiful.

My first attempt was a disaster. I pulled this beautiful cake out of the oven, tripped over the dog, and it landed upside down on my kitchen floor! So, a couple of days later, when I was through being mad, I tried it again. This is a wonderful recipe! The only thing I am going to change is to up the cooking temp to 350 and lower the time to about 35-40 minutes. Otherwise, this is good stuff.

this was absolutely wonderful.  I am not a chocolate fan and was a bit confused about adding the frosting to the cake before cooking (i had to read the recipe 3 times before I did it).  It was a huge success.  My neighbor (who loves everything I cook, but isnt a huge chocolate fan either LOVED it).  I have made it 3 times since then.  I think I will try it next with a banana cake.  Great recipe even though it isnt the most attractive cake.  Will definitely make many more times!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture (like a cheese danish filling), and it came out well, almost "three tiered", and wasn't ugly at all!  It was easy to slice and almost looked like "brownies with cream cheese." I made it with the German Chocolate cake mix, and would recommend trying that first.  This was an easy and great cake.

This cake was an instant hit.  The first time I made it, it looked like it scored a 10 on the Rickter scale with taste to match!  Note--I used 1/4 cup of butter.

I made this tonight because I had a cake mix, a bar of cream cheese and some coconut.  It went together easily and I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, the recipe directions were inadequate and I acted impulsively, not taking the time to read all of the reviews.  Judging from the recipe photo, I assumed one would need to turn this cake out of the pan.  Well, the cake bears no resemblance to the photo.  The directions do not specify how long to cool the cake, if/when to de-pan it, etc.  I made an educated guess (I've been baking for 30+ years) and it was a mistake.   I now have a pile of rubble and a mess on my counter.  I did taste it and it's rich and delicious but I'm so relieved that I didn't make this for anything important.  I'm sure it would be great if we just had explicit instructions.   I'll give it another shot if the recipe is amended.

I made this cake for someone's birthday at work, and it was hit.  The cake was gone by lunch time.  I did find that it was not completely baking at 325 degrees.  I baked it at 325 degrees for 45 mins and 20 mins at 350 degrees and it baked well.

I no longer work outside my home, so I've had time to try all types of new recipes on my husband of 31 years. Out of all the things I've tried, there are only a handful that he's asked me to repeat. This is one of them. I whipped this recipe up very quickly! It's very easy, my children loved it; it was an instant hit. I don't see how anyone could rate this less than a FIVE!

I loved this cake.  I don't use cake mixes so I followed the recipe for devil's food cake I from this site.  It was a lot of work and a lot of dishes, but the end result was worth it.    I did layer the cream cheese mixture with the cake as other reviewers suggested, but my filling seemed to fall to the bottom of the cake.  Maybe because I did not use a box cake mix.  Next time I think I will reserve one cup of the cake mix, spoon over  the cream cheese mixture and spoon over the reserved cake mix ontop of it.    The only changes I made to this recipe was to decrease butter qty by about half and decrease the confectioners sugar to 1 1/2 cps.  I can't wait to make this cake again.  Next time I will try it with my brownie recipe or crazy cake recie from this site.  Tastes great warm, even better when cooled, and even better chilled in the refrigerator.

This cake is simply awesome! I've been asked to make this several times. I have to mention that it is super sweet! You could probably add a little less sugar and still be fine.  I tried making it with a brownie mix and it was great. I followed some of the other reviews- poured some of the cake mix in the pan after reserving 1/2 a cup- then spread the cream cheese in a layer and then spread the rest of the cake mix.  It looked perfect!

Adding my own little touch; I put 1/2 of coconut in the cake mix as well. Cake is incredibly good, very very rich.

I also put 1/2 of the cake down, then the cream cheese and then cake on top and baked at 350. It turned out perfectly!

I made the cake as instructed except I used the suggestion to layer the chocolate and cream cheese.  The cake turned out very moist and delicious.  It reminded me of a german chocolate cake with the coconut and pecans.  Next time I would cut back the amout of pecans, since I am not too big of a fan of nuts in desserts.

This recipe is exactly like I have made it in the past with the exception of one thing......  The density of the cream cheese mixture must be less that that of the prepared cake mix.... you may want to add a tablespoon or more of milk to the cream cheese mixture.  And yes... the lava flows from the cake as you bake... beware!  You must put a cookie sheet underneath this catastrophe.  It's called "earthquake cake" for a reason.  I happen to adore the very brown edges where everything caramelizes... and so do all of my guests.  Not a pretty cake.... but a delicious cake!  Make it and make it often.  (Needs absolutely NO additional toppings.... just a big cup of coffee)

Diffently a five star rating. This cake was so simple. I did make the Devil food cake from scratch thou. Which still did not take take much time. I used the recipe from here "Devils Food Cake 1". My daughters had a friend over and between the 4 kids and my husband this cake is almost gone. Very moist and YUMMY!

I agree with the person who said get rid of the picture associated with the recipe--it looks NOTHING like it.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was pretty odd as I was assembling it (maybe the coconut and pecans float to the top?) but it literally looked like an earthquake hit it when it came out.  It ran over the sides of the pan and the cream cheese/sugar mixture was very soft while the cake was fully cooked.  I felt like I had to cook it longer because of this weird disparity.  It tastes okay (my boyfriend loves it for some reason) but the coconut and pecans on the bottom and too brown and I feel like it's too sweet overall.  Seriously, that picture isn't even close to the real thing.

This was very good. My mom in my opinion is the best cook and she loved this. I only made a small change I reserved some of the cake batter and poured over the top of the cream cheese mixture. You also can't go by the time, you have to check the cake you just know when it's done. Great recipe. Thanks

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT I am not a big sweet eater but this is divine! Its always a hit I used 2 cups of confectioner sugar plus 1 heaping cup of conf sugar and it was perfect I did cook at 350 for at least an hour though. I just got a new oven and baked it on convection and the timing is correct IF you have a convection oven only!

This was very easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I used a fudge cake mix cause that's what I had on hand.  I ended up having to cook this about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated; might try raising the temperature to 350 next time.

Great cake - but please change the picture.  It does NOT look like that if you follow the recipe.  With the cream cheese on top, as called for, it really does look like an earthquake, and is a bit difficult to cut and serve, but quite yummy.

cake was easy to make, everything went fine, but it boiled over in the oven while baking making a huge mess, it filled my apartment with smoke and the fire detector went off, I've never had such a disasterous result while baking.  The cake isn't worth eating because it wasn't allowed to become fully cooked in my smoke filled oven!

This was awesome in my opinion.  My husband didn't care for it at all but with him if it is not German Choc. Cake he don't want it.

I placed the cream cheese filling in between two layers of the chocolate cake and still experienced spillage while baking so I suggest placing a large baking sheet underneath of your cake pan.

With all of my box cake mixes I only add one can of diet caffeine free soda and this worked well with this recipe.

I also forgot to add the vanilla to the cream cheese and used less sugar but it still was delicious.

Wow! This was so good! It was very sweet, so I will reduce the powdered sugar to 2 cups next time I make it. I took it to a potluck it was gone in minutes.

Cake in oven now. Cream cheese mixture is going all over the oven and almost looks like it is burning. Reviews say it is delicious, hope it will live up to the reviews, taking to my sister-in-laws in a few hrs. Any suggestions why this happened? Used a 13x9x2 pan. Update-delicious,will make again but will put cream cheese mixture in the middle. 10-17-10 This time I put 1/2 the cake mixture in the pan, topped with cream cheese mixture gently spreading over cake mixture and topped with the rest of the cake mixture, spreading evenly over cream cheese. Used a 13x9 pan, I left it in the pan and frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting but only made 1/2 a recipe which still made more than enough for the cake. Served it at a birthday party and was enjoyed by all.

This is another great recipe to take to work. I've never made it with devil's food, I've only made it with german chocolate cake mix.  I'll have to try it with the devil's food though.  It's a great recipe that will get rave reviews, even though it's voted the ugliest cake...that's what makes it great!

Definitely add some coconut extract to the filling!! Also I used 3 cups sugar - next time 2 1/2. I used my conf. oven at 325 and thought 40 mins. would be way long enough...not - BUT the goopier center was still yummy.  Also I saved back 1/3 of the cake mix to cover the top - made it very nice looking - therefore the name is no longer fitting ;) I'm sure I will make again!! Thanks!

My son wanted a 'chocolate swamp cake' for his birthday, and this fit the bill. I made chocolate cream cheese filling, by using 2 c. powdered sugar and 1/4 c. cocoa powder. I also kept the filling between two layers of cake, and it didn't spill at all. I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes, but I think it got overcooked. Next time I'll try the temp in the recipe.

YUM! Important note: I only used 1 1/2 cups of conf. sugar because that is all I had on hand.  There is absolutely no reason to use more than that. It was plenty sweet enough.  I also cut the butter back to 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) since I was using less sugar.  I saved approx 1 cup of cake batter to pour over the cream cheese mix to make is look more appealing and to stop the spillage others referred to. If served warm this recipe would be great with hot fudge and/or carmel poured over it.  However, the next day the cream cheese mixture really tastes much better when chilled.

I will probably try this recipe again reserving some chocolate cake mix to layer on top of the cream cheese mixture.  I did not care for the browned texture and taste of the cream cheese topping on top of the cake, but the rest of the cake was moist and delicious.

I have made this cake several times and it turns out fantastic each time. It will appear uncooked after the baking time because of the cream chees mixture. It's suppossed to be that way. Take it out and cool completely. It's flavor is best when served the following day. I refrigerate the cake overnight.

It took about 20 minutes longer for the cake to cook than the recipe says, but just like everyone says, the people at my party raved about this cake.  I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan, but I did cut it up in squares first.  Very good cake.  I added coconut to the batter.

Everyone loved this cake.  I used dark chocolate mix instead, and walnuts. It was for a birthday and I wanted to write on it so I let the cake cool overnight and frosted it with fudge frosting the next morning even though frosting was not called for or even needed. It made it a real chocolate lovers cake! Will make again for sure!

I first found this recipe in a book I have called “100 Cake Recipes from a Cake Mix.”  I made it for a friend’s b’day & it honestly looked like I had somehow made a BIG MISTAKE!   It had overflowed the 9x13” pan & looked very messed up.  However, after the chuckles & comments of...”What happened, did u use too much baking powder/soda?” ...I told them...”No, it was actually made from a cake MIX!”  While everyone was eating it tho...amongst the “Mmms” &”ahhhs” & “this is delicious!”

I made this cake for a Superbowl party and it was a huge hit!
I used coconut oil and butter in a dark chocolate cake mix (instead of vegetable oil) . I also used a cup of chocolate chips over the cream cheese mixture (next time I'll use 2 cups of powdered sugar rather than 4)  I baked it 10 minutes longer than called for.  It was the best cake I've ever made and it disappeared very quickly.  Can't wait to make it again but I'll have to work out for a couple of weeks to burn off the calories from the first one !!!

Be aware, this can spill over the sides of the cake pan and make a smokey mess of the oven.  But it is a delicious sweet cake.

This cake was awesome, so moist, rich and ooey gooey good, but I only used HALF of the cream cheese mixture. I cut the cream cheese block in half, stick of butter in half and half lb of powdered sugar. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. I'll be making this for a long time. Thank you!

to make. I use to take it to potluck luncheons when i worked and I saw people
seven in a line to get a piece of this
cake. it is crazy, but I love it.

I made this for my fiancee, since I am not that big on chocolate, but I couldn't stop eating it!! It looks really cool when it's done, not "ugly," as others have said, and I can't even say enough about how good it tastes. I will make this over and over. . .

This is an "ugly" cake but the taste more than makes up for its looks. I usually make mine with scratch chocolate cake but it is wonderful with the box mix too. Great recipe!

I gave my mother a piece of this cake, and the next day she made one for herself.  Everyone who tasted it loved it.
