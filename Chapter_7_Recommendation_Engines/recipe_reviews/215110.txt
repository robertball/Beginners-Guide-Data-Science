These are really yummy and cute.  I made them for Halloween and colored the rice krispie portion orange by dying the marshmallow mixture before adding the cereal, so I had orange and brownish black layers - very cute.  I have lots of big plans to make layered rice krispie treats for all sorts of holidays  - xmas, fourth of july, etc.

I used a cup less of the regular rice krispies. I like having more of the marshmallow! I also didn't layer like the recipe, I just did chocolate on one layer and then the regular on the other layer.

Such a creative way to spruce up the ordinary rice krispies treats!! Tastes delicious just like the regular treats but a much more fun and creative way to make them
