At first i was never a member to this website because i would just print off the recipe and make it. When trying to leave a rating i realized i had to become a member so i did just to leave a rating to give Tom the credit that he well deserves for this recipe. I have always been a sweet pimento cheese lover. Its hard to find a good one on the internet. I dont understand why more people have not left ratings for this award winning cheese. Out of five stars i would rate this at least a 10+. Yes its that good. Thanks again Tom !!!!!!!

This is a wonderful filling for sandwiches, as a cracker spread, or to stuff into celery stalks. It's a staple at our house that we serve as sandwiches with soups and stews. Our kids love taking it to school in their lunches. It's also a great snack at night.

WOW! I am a pimento cheese convert.  Never have been much of a fan, and when no choice but to eat it I've always leaned toward my mom's melted-Velveeta-and-mayo version more than the chunky style that everyone else makes.  This version is ridiculously good; fluffy, a little bit sweet, and great addition of pickle and garlic.  I agree with Dustin, surpised on the lack of ratings.  Thanks Tom!

I love pimento cheese.  Glad I found a recipe to make my own.   It is great as a sandwich.  I also just tried it with Frito scoops and it is awesome.

Gotta give props to Tom for the pickle relish idea, even though I didn't really follow the recipe. In fact, the cream cheese is the only thing I didn't change! I used shredded Moz (only cheese I had except velveeta), real mayo, homemade sweet/dill relish (dill pickles in the food processor with sweet pickle juice), jarred roasted red peppers (chopped to pimiento size), and left out the sugar. Oh, and I only made about half the recipe (didn't have much of the Moz...) and "eyeballed" all measurements. Wish I had some celery to try it on...

Best I have ever made, I made pimento cheese for 40 years but this is the first time I've used cream cheese.  This is a wonderful recipe, I'll make it again.  
Thanks to Tom!!

This recipe had too much pickle relish for me but the rest of my family really liked it.  I think I will half the amount of pickle relish and omit the pickle juice next time.

This was amazing. Our friends and family agreed. I didn't change the ingredients, however i did put the cheese and pimentos in my food processor. Texture was perfect. Can't wait to make again.

4/7/19:  Update:   I ended up going back to this recipe, bc I felt like I did something wrong.   I really liked the sweet relish the dish asked for,  I use sweet salad cube bc they are bigger.  I still did not add the sugar, relish is sweet enough.  only 1/2 jar of pimentos,  used garlic powder as well.    Today I am making it for the 4th time.  I also use extra sharp cheddar cheese and a good mayo.

I made this with my own little added flare and it is by far better than any store or deli bought style.
