In order to get that beautiful, creamy consistency a good risotto is so noted for, I found 15-20 minutes of cooking time was not nearly long enough.  The simmering broth must be added little by little, cooked and stirred till it's absorbed, then repeating this step, ladle by ladle of broth, until the risotto is tender but not mushy, the broth is absorbed, and the starches break down resulting in creamy risotto - however long that takes. In my case, it probably took twice as long as the recipe directed, but then I cooked this at moderate heat in order to release the starches slowly.  The end result was a creamy risotto with great flavor, the perfect complement to the pork piccata I served it with.

Please do cut the mushrooms in half, I think it was a typo when it was first entered, but you can use any amount of mushroom you desire! Feel free to also adjust the wine to your preference. You can also try different variations to make this a main dish, peas & prociutto, shrimp and asparagus, chicken and mushroom, saffron & seafood... whatever you desire for the last mix in (cooked meat of course)! Optionally, you can add some tarragon to this and add more broth if you like it "soupy". It's fantastic!

Those saying that it takes longer than 20 minutes to cook, that is because your cooking heat is too low and/or your broth is not hot enough (should not be boiling, but should be hot and kept over low-medium heat). When you add the broth, it should be boiling when it hits the risotto. It should take about 2 minutes for your broth to be fully absorbed after constant stirring.  Hope this helps!

The best mushroom risotto I've ever eaten was in Valetta, Malta (so good you'd give somebody's left arm for it)and I've been hunting for a good recipe ever since.  This recipe is a close second!  I've made it twice now, and I've found that I prefer to use about twice as much wine as called for (and of course then cut back on the chicken stock), as well as add a clove of garlic with the shallots (but I love garlic, so this may not be for all).  Overall a very good basic recipe with lots of room for customisation.

Great! With the leftovers I made Risotto al Salto. I shaped about half cup of the cold risotto and pan fry it with olive oil until it is golden brown. About 2-3 minutes per side. Then I sprinkle it with Parmesean cheese, it's delicious!

Served with sides of roasted tomatoes and fresh green beans, this risotto made a gratifying dinner indeed!  I will have to remember this recipe when I am entertaining vegetarian guests, although I cannot wait to make it again and top it with seared and caramelized diver scallops.  I added a clove of garlic, doubled the amount of wine, and used chicken stock rather than broth. I added only two Tablespoons of butter but did add some extra Parmesan Reggiano.  I did not need as much liquid as the recipe noted.   If you are new to risotto making be aware that the amount of liquid needed can change each time you make it, so always check your rice as you go along, don’t just blindly follow a recipe or use the amount you used when you made the dish previously.  As for being too much work…how much work is stirring really?  It only takes one hand and you’ve opened a nice bottle of wine for the risotto so you have one hand free to enjoy a glass as you stir.  What could be better than that?

This recipe was fabulous ... well worth the effort of standing and stirring! You can never have too many mushrooms in my book. That "typo" only made it better! ;) I only made one change to the recipe -- because there's an alcoholic in the house, I substituted the wine for white grape juice and it was really good! I found that the risotto was actually even better the next day for lunch, too. It reheats really well in the microwave with a dampish paper towel over the top.

This was a fantastic recipe for my first attempt at making risotto.  I did cut back on the amount of mushrooms.  I used 8 oz sliced white and 8 oz. sliced baby bellas.  We don't drink wine and I didn't want to buy a bottle and just use 1/2 cup, so I omitted the wine and used chicken broth in its place.  Do be prepared to literally stand at the stove and stir for 20 minutes, though.  I wasn't able to get away from it for more than a few seconds at a time or it would start to stick.  This made an elegant dinner paired with Sensational Sirloin Kabobs from this site.

Soooo good!  Will make again and again!  Find the perfect balance for heat - not hot enough and you'll be standing at the stove for ages getting the thing to cook, too hot and it will stick to the bottom of the pan.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it for a group of friends, abd they could barely talk they were so busy shoving it in.  A few changes.  I agree about adding garlic, at least as personal preference goes.  In addition, I used an extra 1/8 cup of cheese, went with a 1/2 cup  less muchrooms, and right before serving, threw in about two tsp of freshly chopped chives.  It livened up the heaviness of the dish just enough to diminsh my guilt!  I served it with a chicken roll up and the crowd was delighted.

This was an excellent recipe, paired with cedar-planked grilled yukon river salmon and grilled asparagus.  It did take a lot of stirring so make sure you don's have anything else to attend to or an extra pair of hands to help.

This was my first time making Risotto, so I was a bit nervous about the whole thing, as Risotto has kind of this air of "mystique" around it (I blame Gordon Ramsay and Hell's Kitchen for all of my fears. "YOU CAN'T EVEN COOK A #$(&*ING RISOTTO!!!").   The recipe was spot on, and turned out fantastic! When I taste tested it after putting it all together, I was just shocked at how good it was (and really how easy it was to put together).   i'm not sure how much mushroom I put in there. I figured the 2lbs of mushrrom were a bit overkill, so I just used by my definition "a lot". and it turned out really well.   This recipe can be customized a ton. I'm really excited to try making different variations of it now :).  Will definently start adding a bit of garic to the shallots when starting off the risotto.   As stated, and as those of you who are going to try it already understand: You need to be focused on the risotto. Not the book you're reading, or the news report that's on...stay focused on the dish. Having another set of hands around will help.

First time making risotto. Great results, but a lot of work. May opt for a baked pilaf instead; similar flavor, less work. Also, save money on the portabellas and just use white mushrooms.

My girlfriend and I were initially concerned about making this because risotto has a reputation for being hard to make and this was our first attempt. But this was really simple and tasted great. Our only substitution was onions for shallots and the combination of sauteed mushrooms and onions was wonderful. The second time, we found real shallots and they were even better! We will be making this again very soon.

I LOVED this!!!!!  The only thing I can say is that it was salty so next time (which will be tomorrow) I will make it using low sodium chicken broth.  Also, when the risotto was 3/4's cooked and the broth was absorbed, I took it off the burner.  A couple hours later and when I was almost ready to serve my dinner, I heated up some more broth, added it to the risotto and finished off the recipe.  It really was amazing and really is a great "make ahead" dish - believe it or not!

Sooooo good!! I've been nervous about making risotto for many years. Back in the day all you ever heard was how time-consuming it is standing there for hours stirring the rice and adding the broth. I didn't have arborio, but being half-Japanese we always have the Japanese short-grain rice around. Usually we rinse our rice before cooking it, but I didn't want to lose the starch so I skipped the rinsing. It worked perfectly AND it's much less expensive. Will definitely make this again!

Very good basic recipe. I bought mushrooms before reading reviews, so I had LOTS of fresh mushrooms, mostly oyster and porcini.  I used over a pound because we love mushrooms.  It took the twenty minutes described to add the broth and yes, lots and lots of stirring.  Very nice texture and flavour.  It will become a regualar as long as there's time.

Awesome! My sister and I made this recipe on Christmas day and every single person asked for more, even our mushroom-hating little nephew liked it. We doubled the recipe and had lots of leftovers for the following day and it tasted even  better. Mom said: "We have to make this more often!"

We made a slight variation of this though:
1) Used more wine and parmesan cheese than called for by the recipe (doubled parmesan).
2) Added 2 tbsp. finely chopped fresh cilantro (you'll see!).
3) Used half of chicken broth and substituted the other half with a mixture of water and a chicken bullion (2 cups for 1 bullion). If you love mushroom, use a whole lot (both crimini and portobello) and defenitely save the juice from sauteed mushrooms and add them to the rice. YUM!

This was a fantastic recipe and a huge hit at my dinner party. The only change I made was to remove the wine as my 3 yr old daughter loves risotto so I substituted the wine with an additional 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I will definitely be making this dish again and again...even try adding a protein to make as a main dish.

I  also used half of the mushrooms the recipe called for.  I followed one users advice and prepared myself to stand stirirng for about 40 minutes.  I also found that I needed more broth than the recipe called for, but I did add slightly more rice than it called for.  We added asparagus and pees.  Loved it but thinkit still could have cooked a litlte longer, so as not el dente, but totally creamy, bc that's how I think risotto should be.

Never fails to be an amazing dish, this recipe is so good it tends to be the focal point of the meal when served.  Aside from cutting down on the mushrooms by almost half I do not deviate from this recipe at all. As the contributor said, "cooked the slow, painful way, but it's oh so worth it".

Awesome recipe. Just did some tweaking:

Added leftover grilled chicken breasts; chopped them up and stirred them into the risotto at the end with the mushrooms. 

Cut down on mushrooms, used only 1/2 pound. Came out perfect; not too many, not too little.

Added a minced clove of garlic in the beginning, sauteeing it before the rice.

Didn't use shallots or greeen onions because I didn't have any.

Used freshly grated asiago cheese instead of the parmesan.

Great recipe! I did add a little more white wine and Parmesan cheese and it was perfect for our taste. I used 2 cups of Baby Bella mushrooms and that worked just fine. For those who think the wine is going to affect an "alcoholic or 3 yr old" It WILL not! Alcohol burns off with the heat, so do not feel that you're giving alcohol to someone if you cook with 4 oz of wine and 32 oz of chicken broth!!! Basically you're cooking with 36 oz of LIQUID...I found this article - maybe this will help explain:
"Alcohol itself doesn't add flavor to dishes so much as it helps release flavor molecules in foods and assists in dissolving fats, allowing ingredients to reveal their own unique flavors in ways that other liquids (like water or broth) or fats (like butter and olive oil) cannot. 
When adding wine to a sauce, make sure you allow most of the alcohol to cook off" Allow the sauce to reduce by half in an open pan to let the alcohol cook off. Now you know you know how to cook with wine :)

We are Risotto lovers and I'm making a mushroom risotto at least once a month. The secret of a good risotto is stirring, stirring, stirring. And yes, you have to stay at the stover. But it's worth the efforts. I often make it with dried mushrooms because my favourite is only available dried.

WOW this was the star of my dinner party!  I love when a side dish does that lol.  It took me just over 40 minutes but definitely worth it!!  Other than the cooking time I followed the recipe verbatim.  Thank you! :)

I made this for a sit down dinner party and cooked it the day before because I had so much to do the day of the party to prepare for the dinner. The risotto was amazing--creamy and great flavor. I used a chardonnay for the wine. The hint to keep the chicken stock at just below boiling as I cooked the rice was very helpful. As soon as I could feel the least bit of sticking to the bottom of the pan, I quickly added the next batch of stock. I used half the amount of mushrooms as suggested by Myleen and others said in their comments. The only other change I made to the recipe was to reduce the butter to 2 1/2 half tablespoons. Between the olive oil and the butter, I thought it was too much fat. To reheat I put it in the microwave on full power for three minutes 30 seconds and then stirred and put it in for three minutes more and stirred again, then let it sit for a minute. Perfect!

My first attempt at risotto and it came out wonderfully!! I made this as part of my Christmas dinner and it got rave reviews. There weren’t any  leftovers. I followed the recipe to a T, except for the wine because I didn’t have any. I just substituted it with with ½ cup of chicken broth. Also I added only 2 tbsp. of butter instead of 4  BUT the dish still tasted amazing and oh so creamy! I do have one suggestion. Portobello mushrooms are so huge that you only need to use 1 for the amount of rice in this dish. Overall yummy! yummy! yummy!

I love this recipe! It was my first attempt at risotto and was a success.  I've made a few modifications and it still comes out fantastic! I seemed to not have a lot of the ingredients called for, so I made a lot of adjustments. In place of a shallot, I used a small yellow onion.  I also added a clove of garlic when cooking the onion.  After the onion and garlic were lightly browned, I added panchetta (Italian cured bacon), but 2 slices of chopped bacon would work as well. I didn't have chicken broth, but I had chicken boullions and made chicken broth by adding one to hot water.  I also did not have chives on hand, but I had fresh basil, so I chopped up a few leaves after adding the last cup of chicken broth (dried basil will also do).  Even with all of these substitutions, the risotto was still so delicious.  Don't let a lack of ingredients stop you from making a great dish!  This recipe can be modified to your liking.  Enjoy!

Very, very good, served it with veal  & prosciutto kebabs and it was much enjoyed by all. Followed recipe exactly apart from a couple of small changes - upped the quantity of cheese by 50% for extra creamy consistency and substituted chopped tarragon for chives (tarragon goes beautifully with mushrooms). Many thanks for the recipe, will definitely be a regular fixture!

This was my first attempt at risotto ever. I thought it turned out really well. I ended up needing a little extra chicken broth before the rice was completely cooked (about a cup). I also had to use a little garlic and onion because my grocery store was out of shallots. This makes a ton! With the strong mushroom flavor, a little goes a long way. We will probably be trying this again, and making different variations of it. Thanks!

This was my first time making Rosotti and after watching all the Food shows about how hard it was, I approached it with trepidation.  However, it wasn't difficult and it was quite good.  I can see infinite variations and see no reason to be afraid.  Clearly the time is dependent on keeping your chicken broth at the correct temperature. I made as directed and will do so again and again. Thanks for this recipe.

Definitely 5 star! Creamy and full of flavor ...even though I had to substitute quite a bit for what I had on hand.  I 'subbed' (1)white onion & 2 cloves minced fresh garlic, for the shallots.  (2) That (often criticized green container stuff)grated Parmesan for the fresh. (3) Jasmine rice for the Arborio. (4)thick sliced mini-bellas only, instead of 2 types thinly sliced. So, don't hesitate to try this fantastic dish because you don't have exact ingredients. And,it did take 25 minutes adding 2/3 cup of broth each time. . I plan on making often, as time will allow. Thank you SO MUCH, Myleen, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I halved the recipe for 2 very large servings.

I reconstituted a packet of dried mushrooms in my veggie broth for some banging super flavorful broth!  Highly recommend that little change.

Any time I make risotto I add my first ladle of broth then set the timer for 18 minutes.  It keeps me on track and leads to perfectly cooked rice.

Absolutely delicious! This is the first time I ever made risotto so I followed the directions closely. Whichever reviewer said you can't have too many mushrooms, was right! I found it very easy to make and am going to try risotto al salto tomorrow with the leftovers.

My adjustments: I added two cloves of garlic with the mushrooms, left out the butter and only used 5 cups of water and increased the amount of wine to 1.5 cups.

Nothing special at all... And, way too many mushrooms. This is coming from a mushroom-lover. It just seemed like something was missing. Also, it took a lot longer to cook than the recipe stated.

i was hesitant to make this because of the reviews. I am giving it two stars only because I just did not care for this dish. I've never had risotto before so I wanted to try it. I would like to say that I had no problems with this cooking process. I used half the amount of mushrooms and kept the heat on medium-high and it cooked in exactly 20 minutes. I just did not care for the taste/consistency.

I make this on a regular basis. Sometimes I use less mushrooms, just depends on what I have. I've also found that I don't always need 6 cups of chicken broth. The chives (or green onions) are crucial. This recipe makes quite a bit, so we usually do Arancini the nexrt night with the leftovers! :)

Tasted great.  Lots of prep and stirring.  I halfed the recipe.  Per others suggestions, I used half the mushrooms.  We all liked it, but the time to make it is much longer than the 20 mintues.  You don't have to continuously stir, but you are back and forth for 45 minutes, continuley adding broth.  The only thing I will do different is to skip the salt...it was on the salty side, and I may have added too much.  Thanks!

Very good, will be comfortable making variations on this recipe in the future.  Took me a while to get the arborio rice al dente, but was my mistake as I was not cooking on a high enough temperature.

Just finished my "dry run" for Xmas dinner to see how I like the recipe and if (probably not) it can be made a bit ahead.  Very good favor.  I will decrease the total about of liquid by about 1/4-1/2 cup b.c it was a bit mushy.  A tad salty eventhough I didn't add any salt and used reduced sodium broth.  Will increase the wine to broth ratio for Xmas to decrease the sodium and who doesn't like a bit more wine?

This is absolutely fabulous.  The first risotto I ever attempted,and I was silly enough to try it for a progressive-ish dinner party.  We were invited to one house for a "gansta" dinner party, but were each asked to bring a course.  I prepared it about 3/4 of the way at home, and then put it in a casserole dish to keep it warm.  Brought the remaing broth with (and prepared mushrooms) to the party to finish off.  I was so pleased with how it turned out, and so was everyone else.  I did use only about 1 lb of everyday mushrooms, and added a little more parmesan than called for.  Way easier than I thought.  I was worried that it would take forever, but each 1/2 c. broth only took about 5 minutes to reduce.  SO happy with the results I was so intimidated to do this before, but not anymore.   I would suggest cleaning dishes right away as it gets pretty darn sticky!

Cut out the white mushrooms and used only baby portabellas.  There were still plenty of mushrooms.  Used fresh grated parmesan cheese and served with rotisserie-style roast chicken and carmelized onions.  Very delicious!  Best served immediately because the risotto will soak up too liquid and will have the wrong consistency if you let it sit too long.

Love this recipe.  I've tweaked it a bit for my tastes.  I use different mushrooms and eliminate the salt.  I also add some extra herbs... whatever happens to strike my fancy.  Tonight I think rosemary and garlic from the garden. This is my go to recipe.

Fabulous...  amazing.  I was SO proud to serve this.  Followed the recipe to a tee...  100%.
TO MAKE THIS DISH AHEAD I did some searching online and it was perfect!  I cooked all of the liquid except the last 2c. just before my guests arrived.  As our steaks were nearly done I finished the cooking quickly.  Was perfect.  I would imagine you could put it in the fridge and add the last 2c (may need a little extra liquid this way.)  I can't wait to make this again!

I made mine in the pressure cooker. I used 3 1/2 cups of broth and 1/2 cup wine. The consistency was perfect. The taste was good, but nothing special. It really could have used an onion sauteed with the mushrooms.

This is so delicious!! I feel like a chef after making this dish! I substituted the mushrooms for shrimp and asparagus and it was awesome! Everyone should give this recipe a try :-)  It took longer than the 20 minutes specified on the recipe but it was so worth it!

I thought I made this just like the recipe said to make it but I just realized I forgot the Parmesan cheese.  Oops.  Having said that, I would forget again again on purpose next time as we are not Parmesan cheese fans at all.  This recipe is SO flavourful and delicious, I would make it again in a heartbeat.  6 stars!

THE MOST amazing Risotto I've EVER had. It is everything it claims to be and more. I followed the recipe to the 'T' (maybe added a few shreds more of Parmesan). Oh, and I stirred my risotto on med-high for more like 35 minutes!!! Oy vey! But, really, SO worth it. Mmmmm....I will be serving it with steak.

Wow!  This was great!  Followed the recipe to (almost) a T - including the 2# of shrooms.  I used 2 tbsp of butter (instead of 4), and next time I'll add more shallots.  When I hit the 20-minute mark of adding the broth I stopped... probably used only about 5 1/2 cups.  So good.  Thanks for sharing.

yummy!  I used a combination of this recipe and another one from an italian cookbook.  I used vegetable stock instead of chicken , threw in some frozen peas prior to adding the veg. stock and added a roasted bell pepper at the end with the mushrooms.

This was an excellent risotto dish made in the authentic way. You cannot make risotto in a rice cooker as another rater suggest, and I certainly would not use red wine. Having been to Italy before and tasting risotto this recipe is very good.

I skipped the wine because I don't like it but other than that I have to say that I used this recipe to cook my first risotto and it is delicious! The key I think is patience and having a good eye, I had to add maybe an extra 1/2 cup of broth because the rice was still a liiiite hard on the inside when I thought I was done.

I followed this exactly.  I added a 1/2 cup of broth at a time as the directions stated.  I don't know what I did wrong but it came out very mushy.  I cant complaint about the taste, it was awesome.  I will make again and try to figure out how to make it less of a mushy mess.

You can never have to many mushrooms. Great recipe. I found that shallots and onions are the same thing. I added more EVOO as needed. Also added more parmesan cheese as needed. Not blain at all if you add additional ingredients to your taste such as salt. It was definitely a base start for my risotto and modified it just a little but over all an excellent recipe.

My first attempt at making risotto turned out great! Such a foolproof recipe, and I liked how it's a one dish meal. I reduced the amount of chicken broth to about 3 to 4, or alternatively, I would have diluted the broth with a little water. I also drizzled some truffle oil for that extra oomph at the end! 

Definitely bookmarking this recipe!

I made it with barley and I liked it better.Do not cook to the end if you will warm it up. Pour some chicken broth to warm it!!!I used more onion and red pepper, it gets more interesting!!!  I also pour some fresh mango which gave it a good taste!!!!

This was the best risotto I have ever had!  I did however use this as a main entree, so I added asparagus and prosciutto and reduced the amount of mushrooms.  I cooked the asparagus w/the mushrooms and added the prosciutto to the rice when I added my last 1/2 cup of broth.   No salt necessary.

This is very good risotto. Nice and creamy. I added more white wine and cut back on the chicken stock a bit. I don't really drink, but there is no substitute for cooking with wine, and the alcohol is definitely cooked out during this long process-so I really suggest using this ingredient even if you don't drink. We loved the mushroom flavor, using a variety, including shitake- and chopping them. We did not find it to be too many mushrooms, but we are mushroom lovers. I added garlic and more parmesan. My boyfriend suggested adding another herb if I make it again, because, even with the extra flavor, we found it a little bland for our taste. We served it with lamb braised in red wine and it was a great combination-high end restaurant quality.

I was nervous about trying to cook this but it turned out great! Kept the recipe the same, except I only needed 4 cups of chicken broth for mine. I also read the author's updates and made sure my risotto pot and the broth pot were at an appropriately high setting. I'm going to experiment next time with different ingredients and spices, but this is an awesome base!!

I did a little experiment. I made two batches of this, following the ingredient list almost to the letter (the single exception was that my grocery store was out of chives so I had to substitute green onions). I made one batch the traditional way per the recipe, and the other batch in a rice cooker. Without telling them the difference, I asked my guests to try both and tell me which they liked better; most said they tasted the same, and those who I managed to squeeze a further opinion out of said that they preferred the rice cooker version. So much for tradition! That said, I will be making this recipe again, just with the simplified instructions.

Instead of cooking the mushrooms first, I did it towards the end in the butter you're supposed to just stir in.  That way it all blended together into warm, buttery and mushroomy goodness.
I also added fresh rosemary to bring out the earthy mushroom taste.  
All my guests loved it and one husband requested I teach his wife how to make it.

So rich and creamy!  I added in garlic, and used onion in place of shallots.  This may take time to cook, but it is not difficult, and is worth it!

I made this tonight and the whole family loved it, even my two year old.  The only changes I made were to add garlic when I sautéed the onions (I add garlic to everything...even eggs.  Try it!). It's well worth the effort of stirring for 20 mins.  Already added to my recipe box ready for next time.

This is easy and great!!  When I make any kind of risotto I never use Arborio rice.  I always use my jasmen long grain white rice.  I don't' rinse the rice and add it to a large soup pot to keep as much of it on the bottom and not on top of itself.  Then I add 2-2 1/2 C. of the the broth (homemade).  Cooked til tender then started to sauté the mushrooms (I used 8oz port bella and 8 oz. white and that was the perfect amount). Then I sauté the green onions  instead of the shallots. As the moisture cooks out of the rice I slowly add more 1/2-1C at a time.  Once the onions are done and the skillet is still hot I added the wine, stirred and added to the rice followed by the mushrooms & butter.  Once the butter was melted I add the parmesan cheese and melt well before serving.  It was so good I could eat the whole thing myself, couldn't keep from tasting it.  My kids loved it too.  Oh and I'd say it made more like 8-10 serving since my family of 6, all had large scoops of it on our plates next to pan grilled steaks.  I could SO make this when the kids are in school and it's only me to cook lunch for, but I'm going to  have to work on making it into small portion sizes.  Oh and when I reheat it I add a splash more wine and sauté, in the microwave is  not as good. Thanks for sharing as I couldn't get a mushroom risotto to work our before!  BTW I didn't notice the video til after I made this recipe and and was typing my review.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!!!

Fabulous! Made as directed but didn't have chives. Took longer than 20 minutes for me and I thought I had the broth hot enough. Who cares!? It was delicious. Next time I'm going to experiment with a variety of wild mushrooms. Great recipe Myleen:)

My father's eyes lit up and he said, "This is the BEST risotto I have ever had."  Everyone wanted the recipe.  
I put less butter and more cheese.  It was even delicious leftover.

I don't think I'm ever going to cook rice the "normal" way again. This wasn't that hard and sooo much more delicious than boiling rice in a pot of water.

Very thick.  Very, very mushroomy.  Highly time-consuming.  It's good, but it might not work for those that are not super mushroom lovers.  Can't taste the shallots, and I held back on the directions to add all the mushroom juice at the end.

This was amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 1 lb total of mushrooms and I added extra parm.  This was amazing...IDK what else to say lol.  My first time making risotto and I'm not scared of it anymore!

Fabulous! This is now on our standby list for any slightly fancy occasion. Usually do the recipe as is, but with a little less mushrooms (I love them, but this recipe calls for too much!). Remember to take your time adding the liquid a little at a time and letting it absorb. Found out the hard way that trying to rush it leads to hard rice. Worth the extra time and love though!

First, let me start out by saying that this is the first RECIPE dish I have EVER COOKED. I live with my cousin who is a gourmet cook so I have never had the need/desire to cook. I was craving risotto last night and started looking on allrecipes for ideas and found this. 

I followed the directions exactly except I used 1/3 of the recommended amount of mushrooms and added fresh asparagus. I cut the amount of butter in 1/2 as well. I also ended up stirring the risotto for about 50 minutes straight on a very low heat. I was told slow was better so I figured if I had the time I should give it my all. 

My arm is exhausted but my mouth is happy! I wasn't sure if my family was just telling me they loved it until later that evening my mom's best friend came over, who is an amazing cook, and had some and ended up stealing the recipe before she left!

Overall I am really happy with the dish and can't wait to continue cooking!

This is my family's 'go to' recipe. We have made it dozens of times and it never fails to please. It is perfect just the way it is. We have altered it to use with asparagus and even squash instead of mushrooms. Its always  a hit.

This makes the best risotto I have ever eaten outside of a classy restaurant. I used chopped portabello  and sliced white mushrooms.  Do not be stingy with the mushrooms.  I absolutely love this recipe and make it at least once a week.

This was so tasty! This is a time consuming meal but worth it, it does take longer than 15-20 min when adding half a cup of broth a time at medium heat. I also used about 2 cups of portabello mushrooms leaving the white out. I chose to use regular white onion rather than shallots and it worked well.

I gave it 4 stars because I felt the olive oil used to help cook the mushrooms and onions was a bit over powering. Next time I will use a vegetable oil or one that is less distinctive in taste. 

All in all it was very creamy and perfectly cooked. The parmesan cheese was a wonderful addition. I recommend forgetting the extra salt as the broth and cheese has enough already.

My neighbor requested Risotto for our last Tuesday night dinner and this is the recipe that I used. It was a blast to make and I made enough to serve 80 of my neighbors. Each time I looked up from dishing someones plate, I would see another guests eyes roll back and imagine their toes were curling as well. Thank you for gifting this to me.

I used all portobello mushrooms in this and basmati rice. Otherwise followed it exactly. It was very good but flavors weren't that complex I don't think. Maybe more wine? Not sure...

Excellent recipe! I didn't have any chives on hand but it was still a great dish. Definitely a recipe to make again and again.

I put too much salt in my stock so the result was a bit too salty, I fixed it with a few splashes of cream in the end, it was great. I was always hesitant to make risotto but it turns out it is super easy, just make it ahead because it take a significant amount of time and effort.

Really good, however more mushroom then risotto. Next time I will halve the mushrooms. Took much longer than expected, but was worth it.

Outstanding.  I didn't have time to go get fresh mushrooms so I used end pieces out of the can.  Fresh would be better but they'll do in a pinch.  Everyone loved it.

Pretty good. Kind of salty, kind of just a little weird texturally. I might make again but in a much smaller batch. There's no way this is the right amount for 6 people. More like 10.

Excellent!  I did use parsley instead of chives and threw in some smoked guda cheese that needed to be used up.  It's amazing how rich and creamy it tastes without having to use any heavy cream or milk.  Yum!

This is in the top 5 things I've ever eaten, let alone made!  Made one tiny tweak: every time the recipe calls for oil or butter, sub some of it with truffle oil.  Makes all the difference in the world!
I had no problems with the absorption rate.  The rice was the tiniest bit al dente, so I'll probably add a little more liquid next time.

This was my first attempt at risotto and I'll definitely make it again!  I used vegetable stock, which I think didn't add to the flavor as much as I had hoped.  The key next time will be to find a super-flavorful veg stock.  I didn't use oil to saute mushrooms (unnecessary extra calories) and used light butter at the end.  I used slightly less than a pound of button/crimini mushroom mix and it was exactly the right amount.  No fresh chives at the end so I threw in some dried from the spice rack and it was fine.  SO good!!!

Wonderful flavor, but Arborio rice is extremely expensive, and I've found that sushi rice (Asian sticky rice) works equally as well and costs a lot less.

This was my first attempt at making risotto and I think it was a success!  I made half the recipe using green onions rather than shallots, because that’s what I had on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The only change I’d make next time would be to increase the white wine, as we really like that flavor.  This was pretty labor intensive, as I knew it would be, but if you have the time, give this a try!

I mainly followed the recipe as written, but I did increase the amount of rice & stock so that I could use an entire box of rice with no leftovers.  I used low-fat/low-sodium chicken broth, mediterranean olive oil sread instead of butter, a mix of oyster, shitake, portabella and baby-bella mushrooms, and replaced the shallots with a bit of sweet onion (which I caramelized and set aside to add with the mushrooms).  

This recipe is excellent as-written and it's also incredibly easy to improvise with whatever you have on hand: fresh basil, garlic, asiago cheese, fresh pesto, etc.  Lovely!

This is a very good risotto however in my opinion I would not us portobello mushrooms as all they are is brown color whites. I would also use one large onion and no shallots add some garlic. And use the parm as a maybe as it is so good the parm does take away from it.

I use this recipe for every time at I make risotto. It's perfect every time. Make sure you don't overcook it. I decrease the amount of mushrooms in the recipe only because I don't like too many of them. But I think the amount of mushrooms it's called for would be good for mushroom lovers.

Sooo...delicious. I also made it using a wild mushroom broth in place of the chicken broth. It gave it  a nice rich earthy taste. Both ways were equally wonderful!

Excellent! It did take about 20 minutes total, but I didn't have to stir constantly, just frequently.  Added garlic toward the beginning, subbed onion slices for shallots (which I fished out at the end) some extra wine (maybe 1/3 c more) toward the end b/c it needed a tad more liquid and cook time to become al dente.  Added an extra handful of parmesan because we love it.  So flavorful and delicious!

My first risotto Ever and it came out Amazing!! Very easy to make other than my arm cramping up from the constant stirring : ) But it was definetly worth it.  I found that it took about 25min to get to that done perfect risotto creaminess. I served with a side salad and ricotta and spinach stuffed chicken and the boyfriend said he felt like he was at a gourmet restaurant. Will make again and again!

Great recipe. I didn't have any dry white wine so substituted it with white grape juice like a few suggested but the grape juice flavor is way too powerful to use 1/2c.
I also cut back on the mushrooms, definitely don't need THAT much but I totally eyeballed it. Also omitted the butter and salt. Didn't find it necessary to use salt with fresh Parmesan.
Will definitely make this again...just really hard on the forearm with all the stirring.

Nice recipe.  I upped the mushrooms and white wine and it came out great.  It did take longer than the directed 20 minutes but not much.

1st time making risotto and it came out perfect and yummy! The key to cooking it is having the broth WARM as you add to the pan, so it doesn't lower the temp of the rice each time and waiting until the liquid is fully absorbed before adding more. Fantastic and totally worth the stirring time.

Although I find risotto to be a very time-intensive process, this dish is well worth the effort.  

I followed the recipe exactly, up until the point where I added 4 sliced and pan-fried chicken apple sausages to the mix.  With the added protein, the risotto becomes a one-dish meal.  Delicious!

This was amazing.  I used shitake and baby portabellas for the mushrooms.  Everyone loved it, not a grain left.  Thank you for a new family favorite!

I make this on a regular basis. Sometimes I use less mushrooms, just depends on what I have. I've also found that I don't always need 6 cups of chicken broth. The chives (or green onions) are crucial. This recipe makes quite a bit, so we usually do Arancini the next night with the leftovers! :)

So so.  Didn't like that much.  I felt that the mushrooms were too soggy in the risotto.  Maybe if you just layed them on top it would be better.  Also, the risotto was quite sticky and starchy--if that is what people mean by creamy, i did not like it...maybe next time i would add a cup less water and put in a little cream.

Have never had risotto, much less made it.  I maybe left it a little too al dente.  Hubby said it tasted like chalk.  So that was my mistake.  If it's completely soft, we'd like it better.  However, the flavor was absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!!

My first time making risotto. It took about 22 minutes to fully get the chicken broth cooked into the rice. I subbed broth for the wine. Used one pound of sliced white mushrooms, any more and it would have been too much. Only used about 2 tbsp. of butter at the end. My rice wasn't fully cooked, not sure why...it still tasted fabulous, served with a side of steamed asparagus.

This recipe is amazing.  I used one pound of mushrooms and thought it was enough.  I also used onions instead of shallots and used 4 cups of broth with 2 cups of water to reduce the salt content a bit.

This was my first risotto ever attempted. I fell for the popular belief that it was a dificult dish to make, but this recipe has been excellent in helping me create an excellent risotto.  I cooked the recipe to its demands, with the mushroom portion halved (as it is supposed to be). I have never even tried risotto before, although I have tried almost everything else. This was delicious, and has inspired me to cook more risotto dishes in the future.  Excellent recipe! I highly recommend it.

Love this recipe!  Only one change - I use 3/4 lb crimini mushrooms and about 1/2 lb shitake - the variation adds more flavor and texture.

I halved the recipe (there are only 2 of us) and used different mushrooms. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was excellent. I actually wish I'd made the full recipe so we'd have left overs for the next day. I'll definitely make this again. Also I did heat my broth and had it simmering on low while cooking the other ingrediants and the cooking times did work as per the recipe. Thank you for submitting this!

I ended up using 7 cups of broth instead of 6 and omitted the chives at the end, it was amazing. Tasted just like something you'd order in a restaurant in Italy!!! I didn't need to add any salt or pepper either. Only used 1 tbsp of butter instead of 4.

Best risotto I've ever had.  Few changes that I make.  I eliminate the white mushrooms and instead use 5 large portabello mushroom caps.  I sautee the mushrooms a little longer than suggested.  Also use real chicken stock.  Amazing dish.

Excellent! I followed the recipe except I reduced qty of mushrooms to 1.5 lbs total and used mix of portobello, crimini, chanterelle and dried porcini. Also I used the broth from reconstituting the porcini plus Pacific brand Mushroom Broth rather than chicken. Like others, I added some garlic with the shallots.  I doubled the recipe for party of 12 -- everyone loved it!

At first I thought this was great but tasted like it was missing something...and then I realized I only used chives...I completely forgot the shallots! I used vegetable broth and shaved parmesan cheese. This was worth the arm workout and I'll definitely make it again!

Pretty good risotto... and it better be for all that work!!  I followed the recipe to a T... but, it did take a bit longer then 15-20 mins, it was more like 30.  Thank God the bf was willing to take turns stirring, because my arm was about to fall off!  This also make a LOT... I would say 8 servings or so.  I am going to try to make risotto cakes with the leftovers!  Thanks, Myleen

My Mom just made this risotto to use up some chanterelle mushrooms we had and it was amazing! As good or even better then what you would get at a nice Italian resturaunt. We used vegetable broth instead, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG!  The VERY best thing I have ever eaten!!! I cook ALOT and my husband will eat anything, but I have never seen him love something as much as this!  I've made it 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  I halved the mushrooms, and instead of olive oil I used white truffle oil. The trick is to add a half cup of broth (boiling) at a time.  Also, it need a full hour of stirring and adding broth to get to the right consistency.  Otherwise, it is too al dente and chewy.  It also may help to cover the rice with the broth occasionally and let sit for 5 min under low heat.  AMAZING recipe!  Thanks so much!  Now I'm off to share it with my vegetarian friend in Tennessee today!

This takes an hour minimum for prep and cooking, but it is totally worth the effort.  I made it as written and would maybe try subbing some more wine for broth next time.  I wasn't sure how much I was making, so I would also use two large shallots.  This is absolutely worth the time and effort, especially since you could make it ahead to serve to guests.  Yum!

It did take way longer for the rice to absorb all that chicken broth but this was worth it.  My husband loved it and was the one who picked this recipe for me to try.  WOnderful.

Delicious! First time making risotto, not difficult at all. I made a few changes..used less mushrooms, used garlic and red onion instead of shallots because that was what I had on hand.

I halved the amount of mushrooms used, but otherwise I followed the directions and this turned out great on my first try.  This is going to become a regular in our household.  Great recipe.

This is fantastic!!  My first attempt at making risotto, and it turned out great.  It is very creamy and full of flavor.  I don't usually like mushrooms, but they were so good in this recipe that I didn't even pick them out.  The only thing that was difficult was finding a store that sold Arborio rice!  Everyone loved it & I've made it 3 times in the last month.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

I doubled this recipe to feed more people and made a few alterations: I halved the amount of mushrooms based on other reviews and even still, I ended up only using half of that, putting the rest to the side if anyone wanted to add more. It just seemed like too many mushrooms! I didn't want them to over power the other flavors. I used a little over twice the amount of wine and omitted the parmesan. It definitely looked and tasted gourmet, it made the whole meal feel extra special, I loved the creamy texture of the arborio!

My wife loves risotto and mushrooms, so I thought this would be a nice dish to cook for her as a birthday dinner.  I detest mushrooms, so I figured I'd be eating something else.

To my surprise, the flavors in this dish were FANTASTIC!  That includes the mushrooms!  I loved this dish, and the only thing I changed was slightly less mushrooms because I bought them prepackaged, so about 1.5 lbs instead of 2 total.

Delicious, and even though it was 98 degrees outside while I was slaving over the stove, this dish was well worth the work, and the smile on my wife's face.

What a fantastic recipe!  I like risotto and have only been able to have it at restaurants.  I saw this recipe and the great reviews so I tried it.  Oh my goodness!!!!!!  It is so good.  It looked great, smelled fantastic, and tasted like what I have gotten at restaurants.  It was pretty easy - just time consuming.  As others said - well worth it!  My husband loved it as well.  I did not add salt.  I used romano cheese.  Came out fine.  I think if I added salt, it would have been too salty.  I will definitely make this again.. and again... and again.  Seriously consider making this.  It's delish.

This recipe is awesome. The best risotto I have ever had and it was a big hit with my family. There were a lot of mushrooms but we love them so I would definitely use the same amount. I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is the first risotto I have ever made, and it is fantastic!  I made a couple minor changes - couldn't get portobellos so just used buttons; freeze dried chives; no butter.  I don't add salt as parmesan is very salty, this way everyone can season it to their own taste. (FYI-it can be made without the wine, just use extra stock.) This recipe also halves well.  Delicious!!

Good recipe, turned out very well. You could really go with half pound to maybe 3/4 pound each on the mushrooms. I also preffer to use chicken stock instead of broth. I also used more parmesan cheese for the risotto itself and thinly shaved slices for on top. Goes great with cornish hens though.

Good stuff but very rich.  We have made it twice, the second time we cut the recipe ingredients in half and it still turned out great.  I'd recommend it.

As others have said, this is absolutely delicious.  This was my first attempt at making risotto, and I was a little nervous, but there is no way you can mess this up.  I did find it took a little longer than written, I think I stirred for about 30 minutes.  The only change I made was to add the green onions in with the shallots instead of at the end.  Definately a keeper, thank you Myleen!

This is fantastic!  I followed the recipe with no changes and it turned out excellent.  I too would add garlic with the shallots next time and increase the white wine a bit.  The constant stirring is a bit labor intensive when you have a 1 yr old, but worth the effort.  Easy recipe, hard to mess up.  My husband loved it and had leftovers for luch.  Thanks!

This was a nice risotto, and was really mushroomy.  I guess I'm not as much of a mushroom lover as I thought, this was nice but too much mushrooms for me.  Though, my partner really loved this.  I used vege stock instead of chicken to make this vegeterian, added a little more wine, and served with a salad.  He loved it.

This was fantastic! I didn't change a thing. It was my first time making risotto and I thought it turned out pretty great. It did take me a little longer than 20 minutes, but I had my burner on medium and not medium high.

Great recipe. Perfect! I'm gonna have to make this again.

I ended up cooking with 1 cup of aroborio rice. Here are my notes for those who wanted less. This turned out great in a 12-inch skillet.

12-inch Stainless skillet would fit 1 cup of Arborio rice
4 cups of chicken broth
1 lb of mushrooms 
4 Tablespoons of butter

Random note: I should have spent more time to get more mushroom flavor in the beginning of the cooking process. I had a nice cream chicken broth, butter flavor and wine notes, but I should have cooked the mushrooms longer and added a pinch of salt.

It tastes amazing, but it actually takes twice as long! At first the risotto was so undercooked, i had to add another 20 mins. Tip: don't try this if its your first time making risotto.

I've never left a review before, but this recipe was so incredible, I felt it deserved due diligence! I have always been intimidated by risotto, but this recipe was relatively easy (if you don't mind standing over it and stirring for 20 min!), and super yummy! I don't eat chicken broth, so I substituted it with mushroom broth, and added a little bit more parmesan cheese. So, so good!

I am a risotto novice and followed the recipe as stated except I used mixed sliced mushrooms. Turned out brilliantly, even picky husband who lived in the Italian part of Switzerland said it was just right. As I am diabetic I did measure myself out a half cup of risotto (28 g carbs according to nutrition info below) and half a pack of "miracle noodles" (the no carb stuff) dry roasted. I followed the nutritional info on the website and I actually went low 2 hours after, so I think it may be less carb-y than indicated, I am very sure my insulin pump settings are correct. I am quite happy about that actually, just be careful if you are insulin dependent. This could be a great recipe, just don't inject as much as they say….

My best risotto yet. I used bacon and ham pieces sautéed in a little butter then added at the end with the other ingredients.  Magnifico!

I followed the recipie almost exactly (with the exception of maybe a little more wine) and everyone in my house loved it!  100% worth the effort and will make again!

I made it with a breaded fish, and my dad commented that I could have served the risotto on top of the fish, in the place of the breading.

This recipe was worth all the trouble. It did take longer than mentioned because the liquid has to be absorbed after each 1/2 cup of stock so that did take longer than 15-20 minutes. I have served this to guests and was told it was the best risotto they have ever tasted! It was smashing with salmon!

Delicious!!!!! I did try it also with putting a sprig of rosemary in the pot and taking it out in the end. Gave it a kiss of aroma.

I'm sure it isn't the recipe, I'm sure I did t cook it correctly, but no matter how long I cooked and stirred the risotto never softened, then it went from hard, to lumpy mess... Tasted great but looked horrible. It was a dry lump of rice so I added some heavy cream I had from a recipe of fettuccine that I found on allrecipes (which was great) this added a bit of a creamier texture... Won't try again

I've made this risotto a couple of times and it's sensational.  A different variation I tried last time was soaking some porchini mushrooms and then using them and the juice which made a richer stock with heaps more flavor.  If it could be possible it made this dish even better!  Wonderful recipe thank you.

This was my very first attempt at making risotto and it was a smashing success.  I didn't even watch the video so I can say the instructions are very well written.  I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand...fresh flat-leaf parsley instead of chives and only Portobello mushrooms.   Very, very delicious with steak.

I like this recipe overall. My Chinese-side of the family likes a bit more rice in the risotto so I add an extra cup, but also add 1.5 cups extra chicken broth which adds a few more minutes to the overall cooking time. I also add about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of warm milk to the risotto to bring out a creaminess.

I like boiling down my own chicken to get the full flavor for the risotto. In a tall soup pot I fill it with water, garlic, shallots, salt, pepper and a whole chicken. After boiling for 30 minutes debone the chicken and cut for use in the risotto. Use the broth now to boil up the rice after its been quick fried in the butter/fat. This really adds the chicken flavor to the rice.

This was excellent!  My husband and both kids loved it!  I did use a full 2 lbs of baby portabello mushrooms (the large container from Costco) and it was a perfect amount of mushrooms.  I also increased the white wine to 1 cup and used 5 1/2 cups of chicken stock.  Other changes I made:  substituted green onions for the chives which is what I had on hand, added 3 cloves of garlic which I sautéed with the shallots, eliminated the butter (didn't miss it at all) and used freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.  It took about 20 minutes of cooking time.  The results were fabulous!   I will definitely be making this again!

Wow! Restaurant quality. Beautiful presentation in a large flat bowl with asparagus on the side of the bowl.
I would sauté the mushrooms in butter or maybe truffle oil the next time. I didn't add the cheese or butter at the end. It was so rich, already, it didn't need the additional calories.
I finished it off with truffle salt. Fabulous.

Yes, I do think the amount of mushrooms is way to big. I used less, about 3/4 pound of each type of mushroom. Also, since I am a vegetarian I switched the chicken broth with a vegetarian one. Turned out great! The recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS!! I really love it and most importantly my husband does too. :)

This recipe is my favorite! I am very adventurous when it comes to trying new things and although I have never been a big rice fan, I had to find out what the big attraction was.  After making this recipe, I understood why people order risotto!  I gave samples to everyone in my building and people were seriously impressed.  Thank you very much Myleen!

Wonderful recipe!  I love risotto and always order it when I am out to dinner.  I always thought that making risotto was above my cooking ability.  Well tonight was my night!  Your recipe was so easy to follow.  This recipe tastes just like the risotto I eat in my favorite Italian restaurant.  Okay maybe even better!! It will definitely go in the book with my favorite recipes.  Thanks for posting!

Such a forgiving recipe. Any mushrooms will do - I used a mix of button, swiss brown and shiitake. Only used about 4 and bit cups of chicken stock cos I wanted the risotto to be a bit drier. Thank you for the recipe - brilliant.

Made almost exactly according to original directions, but made a couple of adjustments - Didn't have shallots, used red onion, added spices to mushrooms as they cooked down (Bouquet Garni and Fines Herbs from Penzey's) - added a bit more cheese and topped with fresh chopped parsley - delicious!

It was so good! It was creamy and absolutely delicious. I cut the mushrooms to about 300g and added 1 1/2 cups water and took out the white wine. I added leek and some chicken for protein. Ooooooh I'll be making this for a loooong time!

I increased the servings to 8 so this took only about 5 extra minutes for the increase of ingredients. Yes, you HAVE to heat up the broth if you want it to take the time indicated. I heated mine to almost boiling and then kept it nice an hot scooping out the 1/2 cup as needed. We had this as the main dish and the only change I made was substituting flat leaf parsley for the chives because that's what I had. AND I did a dry sauté of the mushrooms which is super fast, healthier and easy. Thanks Myleen. This was delicious and I will be making it again with pictures and featuring on my blog soon. It was that good!

I was a bit intimidated about making risotto, thinking it would be time consuming and high maintenance.. but this recipe was easy!  I prepared the mushrooms ahead of time just to avoid prep work at dinner, and when it was time to make this dish it was no problem.  The only change I made was I added some chopped asparagus to the mushrooms.  This is delicious and will impress your dinner guests!

Fantastic! The cheese added a fantastic zing and creaminess, but since I had dairy-free folks over I used a little fine okara to make it creamy. Thanks for the update and suggestions from comments! I did cut the mushrooms (24 oz instead of 32) and added backfin crab meat at the end. This was my first time making risotto and my dinner guests were as pleased as I was! I would likely increase wine next time.

Followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious.  This was my first time making risotto and it wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought. Will definitely make again but if fixing for my husband, will serve as a side with some meat.  I thought it was great and needed nothing to complete it.

Excellent. Very tough critics said it was better than their favorite restaurant's! Used vermouth instead of white wine and cut the mushrooms very thin.

Fantastic! I have never made risotto before and it was incredibly easy (just get ready to stand and stir for 15-20 solid minutes). Be sure to have the risotto cooking on medium high heat and have the chicken broth almost boiling. This really speeds the absorption. Otherwise you will be stirring for 40 minutes.

It is terrific!

My father-in-law had just tried this for the first time at a local Italian Bistro and he said mine tasted even better than that!!!  My mom thought it was a bit too "Mushroomy".  I am not a fan of Mushrooms but I love Risotto, I loved it but when I re-heated it the next day I thought it didn't taste as good and was "Mushroomy"  I weighed my mushrooms on a scale and followed the recipe but the packaging on the mushrooms said it was a pound but looked more than a pound (and it was), so next time I make it I will cut it back to maybe a pound and a quarter of Mushrooms.  But if you are a mushroom lover please by all means follow the recipe!  I'd also like to add that I used Barefoot Pinot Grigio for my wine.  Be sure to have your heat at a Med-High setting to keep everything simmering as you add the broth or else it will take you forever to make this dish.  If your new to cooking or bad at multi tasking in the kitchen just warning you that you will need to devote your un-divided attention for the entire process of making this dish so don't be trying to make other things at the same time.  You need to focus on the RISOTTO!!!!  Enjoy!

I used about a half a cup of finely diced onion instead of shallots...I let the onions carmalize for about 10 minutes in the oil/butter before adding the rice. I had a 10oz. package of portobello that I sauteed and that seemed the right amount, I added them with the last ladle of cooking liquid to let the flavors meld a little (I did also use beef stock instead of chicken). I didn't have any chives and thought it was fine without it. This was the first time I have made risotto, loved how it turned out and will be having fun trying different variations.

This was very, very good. I put more cheese in, but that's kinda what I always do :) This was really hearty, well-balanced, rich, mushroomy and went beautifully with steak tips. My favorite mushroom risotto has some porcini in it as well, and I think that would be a nice touch here, sauteed with the shallots.

I had always been intimidated by Risotto (Hell's Kitchen, anyone?! lol) but this recipe was very easy to follow and surprisingly easy to make! Just get ready to stand and stir, stir, stir your life away and the result will be sooooo worth it!!!  I followed the recipe exactly (which I never do) and it was delicious! Can't wait to make it again!!

This Risotto is AMAZING!  I know it seems like a lot of mushrooms, but for me it was the perfect amount.  Recipe turned out thick and creamy and delicious.  Definitely making again.

This was my first try at risotto. I used portabellos and shitakes. Pure heaven! I could eat this every night. All it takes is a little patience. Oh - and make sure your flame is turned up medium-high with a good non-stick skillet and you'll cook this in 20 minutes. So good!!

One of our standby recipes for when I feel in the mood for a good risotto!  We're not big mushroom fans, so we use much less of that.  However, I have found that the Oscar Meyer Carving Board Rotisserie Chicken goes quite well in this dish!  Delish and thanks for sharing! :-)

Excellent. Used 8oz and 6oz of button and portobello mushrooms, one half a sweet onion instead of shallot and some extra wine. Creamy, earthy taste. Will be on my keeper list.

Amazing! split chicken broth between low sodium and reg. Added a pinch of salt and pepper while stirring the rice midway through, as well as a pinch of tarragon. Served with marinated grilled chicken breast and broccoli. Totally worth the effort!!!!

This was excellent, and very easy to make (by risotto standards.)  I made it vegan by substituting vegetable broth and serving the cheese on the side for the non-vegans.  I also added reconstituted porcini mushrooms.  One person in our group could not have wine, so I substituted the mushroom liquor from reconstituting the porcinis.  It was delicious!

I followed the recipe, but added more wine than called for (evening out the stock to still equal 6-1/2 cups of liquid). This was superb. Even leftover the flavors were wonderful!!

My first time trying risotto and I was a bit nervous about the result.  It gave it my full attention, checked the recipe 50 times and it turned out as good as any I've had at a fine restaurant.  I changed nothing!

I have been looking for a good risotto recipe for some time and this was simply excellent.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  I made it as stated in the recipe and both my husband and I love it.  The trick is to make sure the heat is not too high.  That way, the liquid can be absorbed instead of boiling away to quickly.  Will definitely make again and will be trying some of the variations suggested by the author.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!!

Way yummy flavor.  I did not use the wine, but added chicken broth in its place.  Also, no portabello mushrooms on hand.  Kids didn't eat it, but my honey and I loved it.

Recipe was very good and extremely easy to follow!  I cut the mushrooms in half as they were pretty large. Also required a little extra cooking time.

Friends, this recipe was great.  I didn't find it unusually difficult or arduous.  The rice virtually "tells" you when to add more broth and you can get the texture exactly the way you want it.  I too cut the mushroom ingredient amounts in half (8 oz. for each, instead of 16 oz/1 lb each).  The resulting risotto will serve four people easily.

Prep and cook time took me 40 minutes.  The resulting risotto is delicious.

Followed this exactly as written. Next time I'll cut down on the mushrooms though, probably'd use only one pound.  Delicious and Risotto came out perfect.

This was my first attempt at mushroom risotto and I could not have been more pleased with the outcome of this recipe! I used baby portabello mushrooms and white mushrooms.  And I added some grated romano cheese to the parmesan.  Yum!

A reliable, easy, delicious favorite!  I make this for any dinner party with roasted chicken or meat.  The amount of mushrooms is perfect for those who love mushrooms-- but some don't.  We normally "take a poll" of dinner guests and then at the last minute, before adding the mushrooms, scoop a few servings into another pot so everyone is happy.

This recipe is delicious... and addicting! Although I generally use low sodium chicken broth, I got better results with the regular stuff. I also substitute crimini mushrooms, just because of preference of flavor and texture. Lastly, a few dashes of truffle oil, prior to serving really send this dish over the edge.

Another risotto newbie made his very first.
And if you follow this recipe and Myleen's additional comments you can't go wrong.
Loved it,so velvety smooth.
This recipe has a lot of potential for variation, so I'll be making it more often from now on.
Fun to cook as well... ''Where does ALL that broth and wine GO??''  :D

Tried this over the weekend and glad I did. It took much longer than 20 min (more like 40) to cook but maybe I didnt have the pan hot enough. At any rate like true risotto it takes a lot of stirring to get a great end product. Used just the baby portabella, used beef broth (was what i had on hand) and forgot the shallots so used regular onion and 2 cloves chopped garlic. Left out the chives (just my own taste). I basically screwed this up every way i could, added the wine before toasting the rice, etc and yet it still came out fantastic! Served with a small steak and hubby and I ate until we couldnt move. This makes a lot so we had some for leftovers that tasted just as good microwaved the next day. Definately a keeper!!!

Perfect!  Used just 8 oz. of baby bella mushrooms...everything else per the recipe. Could not be happier with the result.  Reluctant to try the excellent variations others have recommended because this is so very good as is.

Seems silly and time consuming to cook the mushrooms first and put to the side.  I start the rice first and cook the mushrooms to add near the end.

My wife wanted to try a mushroom risotto so we picked this one.  I'm not a huge mushroom fan but I thought it was good!  The recipe as-is made ALOT - way too much for two adults and a kid.  It lost a star because it was a bit too salty for our taste.

A great recipe! I used one package of portobello mushrooms and yellow onion instead of shallots.  I only used about 5 cups of broth.  I will make this again for sure.

I've made this at least 7 or 8 times over the last year and it is a fantastic recipe. Tonight will only the 2nd time I'll be using my own home made chicken stock so wish me luck, as that's the secret to this recipe.

I give this 3 because the taste just wasn't there for all the effort I put into it. It took me about 35 minutes to get to al dente consistency and when all was said and done it tasted like a really good white rice. NOT like a rich risotto I have eaten in many different fine dining restaurants. I will try adding more wine, and maybe a different brand of arborio rice just in case but as is, this did not result in a 5 star side dish despite following directions (including the follow up comment of halfing the mushrooms).

This is the first time I've written a review but I just had to do it.  This recipe is amazing, simple, and delicious.  It is simple to make but it is time consuming.  However, it's all worth it in the end.  I had to cut back on the mushrooms (husband dislikes mushroom) and used beef broth instead.  The result?  Creamy goodness.  I paired this dish with shucked oysters and a great bottle of Pinot Grigio - husband and I loved every bite, slurp and sip of it!  We will definitely be having this in the near future.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Holy cow! I had tried to make risotto before and it was like cement. This was creamy and delicious. As other reviewers have noted the key is hot broth and keeping the rice at a solid simmer. All of my broth had absorbed in 30 minutes and the rice was a perfect al dente.

The only changes I made were to use mushroom broth (vegetarian) and a local SC rice which is good for risotto. Boy, was it! I can't wait to try other variations on this theme.

Thanks for a great recipe and decoding the risotto mystery!

This was REALLY good EXCEPT for (BIG EXCEPTION) no warning on how salty it is! I did not add ANY salt but I used Campbell's chicken broth and the dish was almost inedible because it was so salty. And I put salt on everything! I will make it again with LOW SODIUM CHICKEN BROTH!!

I enjoyed this recipe!! very easy to make, no problems. I used short grain white rice in place of Arborio and the texture of course was different but still tasteful. I also added Spinach and Cilantro to give it color and extra flavor. No Parm cheese so instead I substituted with Sargento Snack cheese! creative but yet still classy, will make again.

Delicious!  And easier than I thought, I was a first-time risotto maker and it worked fine, took about 30 mins for it to cook up, not crunchy but just perfect!  Almost tripled the recipe so I could freeze leftovers (am having a baby anyday now!) and it was still so easy to make, would recommend making it for a large crowd.  I used only white mushrooms, used onions instead of shallots/chives, and also added cooked asparagus and chicken at the end w/ the mushrooms.  Thanks for a fab recipe!

This was absolutely top-notch.  I followed exactly except I used unsweetened apple juice as I had no wine, and added a clove of garlic.  I also halved the amount of mushrooms and used almost all portobello with just a couple of white.  Also the store had no arborio so I used medium grain white rice.  It worked great.

An amazing risotto that my friends and myself have enjoyed time and time again. Though knowing me I can never let a recipe be so I tend to use a variety of mushrooms, more Parmesan cheese, and about 1/4-1/3C lemon juice.

I made this dish last night for dinner. I hate to say it but it was just okay. I followed the directions exactly (reducing mushroom amount to half on recommendation of recipe author) with the exception of adding a clove of minced garlic in with the shallots. Although this dish was okay I wouldn't make it again. It's missing something. My husband liked it but he also poured a lot of extra cheese on it to give it more flavor. Exactly how I made it is on my blog at foodiebecomesher dot com. Maybe you can learn from my mistakes and have yours turn out differently. :)

Absolutely amazing. I used green onions instead of chives, and exchanged half of the olive oil for truffle oil (divine). I was short on chicken stock so substituted some beef stock. Also threw in some oyster mushrooms. Some of the best risotto I've ever had.

I first made this last year after trying mushroom risotto for the first time at a 5 star place on valentines day, and i have to say the one I made turned out even better. I only had portobello so i doubled them up. It was a lot of work but worth it in the end.

I have used the same mushroom risotto recipe for many years and often made it for special occasions with many compliments. This recipe has kicked that one to the curb.  The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. Wonderful dish!!

I have made this twice and its very good.  I didn't want to use portobellos, so doubled the white mushrooms once and used reconstituted dried morrells the second time.  First time I also added asparagus in 1" pieces about 1/2 way through cooking and the second time I used green beans in 1" pieces.

This is the best mushroom risotto i've ever had - and i don't even like mushrooms! well written recipe. I have used some of the same measurements in my recipes to create a custom risotto - Pumpkin, bacon, and pine nuts. First time reviewing for allrecipes... so far, so good :)

For our anniversary my hubbie and I paid $35 for a mushroom risotto...we were craving it again and this recipe was VERY comparable to the high priced one!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic.  I may have used more than 6 cups of broth b/c I lost count of how many 1/2 cups I added through the cooking process.  I made it with steak for my in-laws and thy loved it!

This recipe is delicious and everyone that I have served it to has raved about it....even my husband's 89 year old Italian aunt, who is the best cook that I know.  She even had 3 servings, so what does that tell you?
I highly recommend this recipe and found it very easy to follow.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I cooked it slowly over 30-35 min and it was nice and creamy. I used only the portabella mushrooms (yum!), all other ingredients, and added chopped sage at the end.  I served it with lemon herb chicken and it was divine. A bite of chicken, a bite of risotto, wine sauce, and lemon and I was in heaven.  My husband loved it too.  I will definitely be making risotto more often.

This was tasty, but it was a lot like chicken and rice casserole. It just was too much work for that. However, I think it could be a good base recipe for risotto with other flavors. Finally, I did add the butter, but it was pretty heavy. It would still be good without it.

This is a lot of work for what I consider a side dish, and I had a hard time finding the Arborio rice.  But it is worth the effort for a special occasion!  My family and guests liked it a lot and I personally thought it was delicious.

This recipe is SO good! I've made it numerous times, and it always turns out fantastic. I'm almost afraid to try any other risotto recipes for fear of them not being as good as this one! I definitely use this risotto to impress friends and family, and I've never had anyone say it was anything less than amazing. Oh, I also add a clove or two of garlic with the shallots, because I love, love, love garlic. It adds a nice touch, if you're a fan.

This recipe does not even take close to 15 - 20 minutes to cook.  It took about 40 minutes to make this and I didn't even use some of the chicken broth.  Plus, it's way too salty because of the broth.  It is definitely not worth the time it took to make it.

Great recipe....it's all about the slow stirring and cooking in the flavors.  I took some of the recommendations that people added as well.  I used more parmesan than the recipe called for.

This is a Very tasty recipe.  This was my first time making risotto, and it came out great.  Creamy, perfectly seasoned, and perfect texturally.  If you follow the recipe exactly, there is no reason why the product should be anything other than delicious.  I didn't even need to season the risotto with additional salt.   As the chicken broth reduced and soaked into the rice, the saltiness was concentrated.  The addition of the parm also assisted in seasoning the risotto.  The mushrooms brought a welcome meatiness to the product. I paired this dish with a beautiful marinated tilapia, however, the risotto is perfectly acceptable on it's own.  My husband and young daughter came back for seconds!  I enjoyed this with a nice Sauvignon Blanc.

This was amazing!  I, too, cut the mushroom amounts in half.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt & 1/4 tsp. pepper to mine.  I left off the chives (just a personal preference).  I think chopped fresh parsley would have been better.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

One of the best risotto recipes I have ever made.  Used a variety of fresh mushrooms from the Farmers Market and it was excellent.  Enjoy!

First, the amount of mushrooms is a typo, use only 8 oz of each. I added one clove of garlic, finely minced, but made no other changes.  My hubbie says this recipe is better than restaurant quality!!!  The whole family LOVES it!!!  Thank you!

Definitely cut the mushrooms in half and double the time you will actually spend stirring.  But otherwise really good!

I dont see what all the fuss is about. i think it was ok, but for the price it costs to make this, i wouldnt make it again. Its just not worth it. Just saute some mushrooms and roll with it.

This is a great dish. I made this last night to accompany a rotisserie chicken.  Next time, I'll just stick with the risotto.  I added extra cheese since I shredded too much [almost one cup].  To finish the dish and a bit of a high note, I added some fresh lime juice at the end [1/2 of a lime will be sufficient!] 

Superb recipe!

Wonderful and easy.  Make sure you actually stir it for the full time -- I got lazy once and only stirred it the last 10 minutes or so and it was no where near as good - not even close.  So stir stir stir, or get your hubby to stir for you.  Also, one time I didn't have any mushrooms on hand and  made it without mushrooms.  You really do need them - they add a tremendous amount of flavor!

I loved this recipe. I followed it exactly. It is time consuming, but so worth it. I chose this one because it didn't require any white wine. Thanks for sharing. This tasted almost exact to some risotto I had at a Napa restaurant

I had written a review for this recipe a long time ago, but I find that allrecipes always seem to modify or omit some of my comments. This site has some of the best recipes that I have tried but it is nerve wrecking when they try to micromanage everything. Oh well. That's just my opinion. This mushroom risotto is one of the best risottos that I have ever made! It reminds me so much of my nonna's recipe. I don't always use the same mushrooms - usually whatever I have on hand. I don't recommend using frozen mushrooms with this dish. Fresh is always best. And when I make it for my kids, I finely chop the mushrooms so they don't notice that they're eating them. Thanks, Myleen for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was very good!  I have a suggestion based on my experience as a first-timer...when I found this recipe I had also just received a food magazine that had a risotto article in it and that base recipe indicated the use of a large skillet...I decided to use my largest (12") heavy anolon non-stick and although I did stir pretty much constantly, when I had to pause to quickly check the chicken I had in the oven I had no issues, even though it was bubbling away.  Just thought that might help someone out there!

I have made tons of recipes on this site and this is right up there at the top.  I have never attempted risotto before and it was a snap.  The time, effort, and forearm workout were well worth it.  I didn't have shallots on hand, so I threw some garlic in and just went with what I had.  I used a pound of crimini mushrooms and 8 oz of white mushrooms.  I only used half the butter, and it honestly didn't need any more.  It was SO rich and delicious.  This one is a keeper for sure.

This was a workout! A bit challenging to do with two toddlers running around, but I was dying to try it! I followed others advice and used half as many mushrooms. I'm glad I did - even half was more than enough. That's the only reason I gave this 4 starts and not 5. I can't give a recipe 5 stars if I altered it. Other than that - it was good!

Excellent recipe! I decreased the mushrooms, added oregano and some Italian seasoning mix, used veggie broth and no wine (I didn't gave any), and added black beans to make it a main dish. It was soo good! It was my first time making risotto and my husbands first time eating it and we both loved it!

This recipe was amazing!! I did saute up a couple cloves of garlic with the shallot. Also I only used 6 oz of Porcini and 6 oz of white mushrooms...we thought any more mushrooms than that would have been too much.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again soon.

I would have given this 5 stars except the flavor seemed to be missing something, and there were too many mushrooms.  I only used a pound and a half and it was too much.  I think this recipe needed some garlic, but all in all it did have restaurant quality texture.

This is the second time I've made this in as many weeks. I really love it. I had never eaten or made risotto before. Now, I'm hooked. I used a couple tablespoons of finely diced sweet onion and a pound of white mushrooms as that was what I had on hand. Thankfully, I have some fresh chives in the garden (in February, I know!) lol. I chose this dish as my birthday dish which my mom made from this recipe. Yum. Thanks Myleen!

Delicious!  My first time cooking risotto.  Unfortunatley, I used orzo instead of rice!!  However, it still turned out fantastic and did pretty much what the author said would happen!  Yummy!  Will try it again, next time, with the correct ingredients.

Absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers, I agree on the amount of mushrooms. I used half a pound of each type of mushroom and it was more than enough. Next time, I'm going to only use portobello mushrooms. This recipe is one I'll make again and again.

Absolutely Amazing!!  This will be my go-to risotto recipe from now on. I made the whole recipe for 3 people, ancticipating left overs (to make arancini as one reviewer suggested), but it was so good the 3 of us ate it all!

Great risotto and one of the easier recipes I have made. However- I would leave out the butter altogether. It is creamy without it and cuts down on the fat. Also- I forgot to pick up the white wine and chives, so I just used all veggie broth and it was great. Add a little italian seasoning and ground black pepper with the cheese for extra flavor.

This was amazing! Better than our favorite that we get at our favorite restaurant! I also used half the mushrooms called for, and it was perfect!!  It was worth the effort, and if you enjoy cooking, it's a lot of fun as well.  Thank you!!!

I tried this last night and the risotto came out perfectly!  I used half the amount of mushrooms and substituted zucchini and artichoke heart.  I steamed the artichoke on the side, let it cool, sliced it, and added it at the end, with the mushrooms and zucchini.

It was my first time making risotto and it came out amazing! I added garlic to mine. I didn't add chives because I sent my boyfriend to the store and he didn't know what chives were. So you can definitely cut the chives if you want. I brought it to a pot luck but after tasting it we didn't want to share! It was too delicious! But we brought it to the potluck where it was well received, and I'll be making another one just for us later this week... Great recipe. Worth the time over the stove. It really wasn't that long, especially since I find there is not much to cut/chop. Its a 30 minute meal. I'd love to serve it with chicken or salmon for guests one day.

Delicious! Like others have said, halve the mushrooms to 8oz each, and be ready for it to take longer than 15-20 minutes to combine the broth and rice.  It took me about 30-40. Also, I read somewhere that the wine should be warm.  I microwaved it for 30 sec before adding it to the rice.  This was my first time making risotto and I can't believe how delicious it turned out!

Wow i just love this recipe! Having never made a risotto before (but have eaten plenty) , Im very happy with the end results. I didn't use shallots or chives. And the only rice i had in the cupboard was italian par boiled rice. Next time i'll use arborio. I had the broth on medium and was adding one ladle spoon at a time. Once there was no more broth left the rice was done. It wasnt creamy at all so i added 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and it turned into the perfect consistancy for me. :) Although the recipe didnt say what temp to have the skillet when cooking the rice, i just guessed and kept it around 5-6.  I also love parmesan cheese on everything so i added 1 cup.  Myleen's comment in March 2010 was also very helpful. :)  As the toughest critic of my cooking is myself and my hubby, it was very satisfying watching him enjoy every bite!

This was the first time that I've made risotto and it was excellent.  I didn't have quite enough mushrooms, but it was plenty.  I wasn't sure what dry white wine would be good since I have never cooked with wine, so I looked on the internet.  I ended up using Sauvignon Blanc.  Dancing Bull was the brand...I don't know if all brands are about the same or not.  This recipe was easy and is definitely a keeper.

This is easily one of my favorite dishes, I do have to agree with other reviewers in that the amount of mushrooms is a bit much. I went with a little over a pound total and it was excellent. Also, I used vegetable and mushroom stock. Both were great to make the recipe vegetarian. I also preferred a bit more wine, less broth. Overall, really amazing dish... worth the effort.

I made this on the weekend and it was brilliant.  Being from Italian heritage, I subsitituted the olive oil for butter.  Growing up we always sauteed the 'base' with butter.  It gives a nice rich flavour.  After cooking the mushrooms, I then cooked up some garlic before putting the rice in.  My partner and I like a bit of bite to our food so we overdosed on pepper and also added some mixed herbs as the rice was cooking.  I also used a few different mushroom varieties such as oyster, shitake, button and enoki which added to the taste.

We love this risotto recipe. It has been the best one we have tried, we tried a few with okay to good results. We found this recipe and haven't tried any others since, this one is uncomplicated as risotto goes, and dependable - so far it has been perfect every time. Sometimes we make it as is with mushrooms, but we have made shrimp and asparagus risotto; and mushroom, prosciutto or ham and english pea risotto. The basic recipe is solid and the things you can add are up to your tastes and imagination. Truly excellent.

I had spinach & mushroom risotto at Ocean Zen & it was fabulous. I wanted to duplicate it and I tried this recipe. I think it's even better.  I did make 3 changes: 1)I cut up 12 oz of baby spinach leaves and sauteed them in olive oil and added to complete dish.  2)I put fresh minced garlic in with the mushrooms 3)I replaced the wine (didn't want to buy the wine for this one recipe) with more chicken broth This is absolutely delicious. I think it's even better warmed up. I put in microwave with a bit of chicken broth as otherwise it's a bit dry, cover with a paper towel and voila - fine dining.  I can't thank Myleen enough. This recipe is magnificent.

Very easy and with some changes even lower in fat. I omitted the butter entirely, using only olive oil. Omitted the parmesan cheese - no one missed it! Definitely use the combination of baby bella and white mushrooms and I also added some minced garlic. Omitted the wine and just used chicken broth for the whole thing. Absolutely delicious - tastes creamy and decadent without all the calories from the butter and cheese. Thanks for this recipe.

This was amazing; the husband who just thinks mushrooms are okay ate this with gusto. I did however make a few minor adjustments but I don't think they made or broke the recipe: I'm a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth and I added a 1/2 cup more rice.

I just tried risotto for the first time three days ago, it was boxed risotto, but good i guess.  I made this one about an hour ago and its really good.  I used Pearl Rice instead of the Arborio due to budget constraints, (Arborio = $7 a bag and Pearl = $3) also used vegetable broth (vegetarian) instead of chicken broth. Still very good. I'll be making this again with about 3/4 the amount of mushrooms.

It did take awhile (almost 45 mins!) but it was AWESOME!!!! Well worth it.  I also added a clove of garlic in with the shallots, but aside from that, made it exactly as written.  Fantastic for my first attempt at making Risotto.  Thank you for making my first experience being a good one!!

I think I screwed this up a bit, but the actual recipe was outstanding, PLUS even scaling it down to 4 servings we got 2 dinners out of it, so I liked it.  I think I know what I (and others who say it takes longer) did wrong- I had it on medium heat b/c my stove tends to run hot, and because of that it took nearly a half hour on the stove and the rice was overdone for risotto, not inedible, just didn't have that 'bite' anymore.  Gonna try upping the heat to med-hi as written and I think that will make it better becuase it will cook faster and hopefully not have time to get overdone.  AWESOME mushroom flavor, although I sauteed them longer than 3 mins cause I like them completely cooked.  THANK YOU!!! ans I can't wait to mess around with this, I was always afraid of Risotto, but now I'm excited to try it again and get it right!  BF said 'It tastes just like it smells... GOOD!'  UPDATE:  I've messed with this several times now and the MEDIUM-HIGH heat is the KEY!!!  For those who said it took longer to cook- you don't have the heat high enough.  My stove runs hot so I was apprehensive to go that high of a heat the first time around, but EXACTLY following the instructions produces a PERFECT risotto that is not over- or under-cooked in the amount of time listed.  I added some lobster tail meat once for a main-dish meal and was surprised that it wasn't as good as I though it'd be... I'll stick with it as written or just add other veg from here on out.

I was a little skeptical about the amount of mushrooms called for in this recipe.  I made the recipe as is and was glad I did!  I found it made more than 6 servings.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is in my top 5 best ever recipes.  It is so rich, creamy and delicious I couldn't believe it came out of my kitchen instead of a restaurants.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  I served it with roasted chicken and it was fantastic.  I didn't put chives or white wine in - I forgot to pick up chives at the store and the wine that I had on hand was way too sweet for cooking.  Even without those things it was outstanding, I'm sure if I had added them it would be even better.  Absolutely delicious recipe.

I loved this recipe so much I was moved to write my first-ever review on allrecipes.com. It is fantastic! First of all, my sister and I are vegetarians, so I substituted the chicken stock for vegetable stock. For anyone who may be skeptical, it was still incredibly flavorful. I think the freshly grated Parmesan cheese makes a big difference in terms flavor and texture, too-- if it's not freshly grated, it gets stringy as it melts. Didn't even add any salt to this recipe as it tasted just perfect when it was finished! This was my first attempt at risotto and for anyone who's intimidated: don't be! It really wasn't a difficult recipe at all. Thanks so much for sharing :)

I didn't use quite as many mushrooms, and chopped them (not sliced) - one carton of white mushrooms and 12 oz of portobella-smashing success. This is a MUST try, and I'd NEVER made risotto before.....would give 10 stars if I could!

Wonderful. I can't imagine making risotto any OTHER way than the "slow painstaking way":) I use green onions instead of chives because I never have chives in the house and the green onions are beautiful in it as well. Also, half the amount of mushrooms works best for me. And lastly, since I don't make my own chicken stock, I just use the store-bought OXO type. Don't use Knorr! The OXO 25% less salt Chicken is the only way to go. The Knorr chicken bouillion powder is way too salty and overwhelming. This is my signature dish, so thanks for the help!

OMG!!!!! I have made risotto before and this is the best recipe I have found, you have to try this! I only changed a couple things, I had read other reviews before making this so I knew to cut the amount of mushrooms in half.  The other change I had to make was adding a little more olive oil to prevent burning, maybe 2 tablespoons more in addition to what the recipe calls for, I just poured the oil in without measuring, so I am guessing about one tablespoon more in the first step cooking the mushrooms, and one tablespoon more on the second step cooking the shallots/coating the rice. I used my Le Creuset 5 qt Dutch oven (Birthday gift from my husband), I'm sure that my everyday cookware would have worked fine as well, and I know that these pans are expensive, but if you love to cook you should get one...I think that was part of my success with this dish. It held the heat well and cooked evenly. I paired this dish with Roasted Lemon Herb Chicken (recipe I also got on this site) and it was a perfect Sunday Dinner along with steamed green beans. This was so easy, do not be intimidated...I don't care what others say, stirring for 30 minutes is worth it. Thank you so mush for this amazing recipe!

Awesome recipe and very easy. You actually don't have to stir constantly, just at least once a minute or so. And I added more than the usual 1/2 cup of liquid per time. Also added asparagus cut into 1cm slices and proscuitto and some garlic with the mushrooms. Added extra wine too.  Will definitely make again.

Testament to the versatility of this recipe - it still tasted HEAVENLY despite poor-man substitutions/eliminations. Replaced shallots, Arborio rice, wine, chives, and butter with items on hand--an onion, regular white Jasmine rice, dry vermouth, freeze-dried chives, and margarine. Eliminated mushrooms and sea salt. Minimized fats (for health reasons). Otherwise followed directions faithfully. Even with these blasphemous changes, the recipe still succeeded. That speaks volumes about this recipe. **NOTE: I have also tasted this recipe exactly as it was written--it deserves 6 stars.

Ok, so I NEVER comment on recipes - largely b/c I never follow recipes exactly - either because I rarely measure out things or because I think a recipe needs/doesn't need something that's listed. I wanted to make something special for my BF's birthday, and I followed this recipe almost exactly. I'm pretty sure it was the best thing I've ever made from this site. I didn't have any chives, so that's the only thing I did differently. But other than - it was amazing. I actually forgot to put salt or pepper in it - and it was still wonderful. Savory, creamy, and exactly what I wanted. If it wasn't so labor intensive, I would definitely make it more often!

Very good recipe. I used all Baby Bella mushrooms because they are often on sale in our area and they were what I had on hand.  You do have to "babysit" this dish with the stirring, but it is not such a bad chore if the chef gets to sip the other half cup of white wine while stirring! The leftovers were fantastic just taken to work in a container and heated in the office microwave, I will have to try the Risotto al Salto (pan frying the leftover Risotto in patties) sometime, that sounds great.

I used BROWN rice instead of arborio and excluded the butter to make it more healthy.  I kept the same proportions for everything else (including chicken stock) and it came out just as good! Keep in mind that if you decide to go with brown rice, it will be a bit chewy, as that is the texture of the rice. Thanks for the recipe...so delicious!

This was a terrific recipe.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I did cut back the mushrooms a bit too.

I halved the mushrooms, doubled the wine (and reduced the broth accordingly), halved the butter and used 1/2 cup parm.  I also used veg broth instead of chicken.  It was SO delicious.  I will definitely make again.  The leftovers were just as good.  I served this with the Butternut Squash Bisque from this site and it was excellent.  Be warned, you will be over the stove for the entire time the rice is in the pot, so have everything prepped before you start cooking.

This was my first attempt at risotto and I thought it turned out amazing!  I cut the amount of mushrooms in half, for preference reasons, but there were still plenty of mushrooms in the dish.  Once I started cooking the rice, I realized that I did not have white wine or enough chicken stock in the pantry, so I improvised with water.  The risotto still have plenty of flavor and then I didn't have to worry about it being to salty.  I cooked it a little longer than the 15-20 minutes, added just a touch more water than the 6 cups and added about a 1/2 cup of cheese total.  Delicious!

Stunning .. add a litle crushed garlic and as long as you like mushrooms half the white but keep plenty of the portabello. Re heats pretty well so could be made ahead and warmed through.

First time making risotto- this was really great.  I had to make some changes.  I didn't have chives or shallots, so I did one small yellow onion and 2 large cloves of garlic.  Also, I only used 4.5 cups of broth before it was cooked.  Very good- I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe. This was my first time making risotto and it was much easier than I anticipated. I ate two servings yesterday and this morning I brought some to work and I am eating it already (its only 10 am!!) – this is how good it is. My husband loved it too. I made my own chicken broth with fresh vegetables and chicken. I used 1 full cup of wine, baby Bella and white mushrooms and it wasn’t too much. At the end I also added cut-up chicken from the broth and some green peas, which was very tasty. And of course I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Making my own broth allowed me to control the salt and the end result was scrumptious!! Will definitely make it again – maybe with some tomatoes or garlic and shrimp next time.

OMG, made this for a dinner party tonight and was very, very well recieved. I was with an italian guy for 3 years and this was above standard to many or his own risotto recipes! I think the ammount for 6 mentioned is really, honestly enough for 4 ppl. I lowered it to 5 and it only just fed us 4. I lessened the mushrooms by 100 grams as I also added chicken, but without the chicken I think the ammount of mushrooms stated is fine, and not over powering at all. Upon frying the mushrooms,  also added 4 cloves of garlic. I messed up too and added the wine to the stock instead of straight into the rice, but it tasted fine nonetheless. The parmesan wasn't over powering at all, and the chives added a lovely change to the colour which would have otherwise been bland. All in all, we say 10 out of ten for the basic recipe, perfect without any changes!

Very creamy and flavorful. I used many more mushrooms, including dried porcini mushrooms (about 1/2 cup) that I soaked in warm water for about an hour. Threw those in, along with its brown liquid, with the rest of the mushrooms. The secret to a smooth and creamy texture is stirring constantly, and adding a little bit of the broth at a time. I suggest adding the chives to the portion that is being immediately served, instead of to the whole pot. That way the chives always look bright green. Overall, very good recipe, and you can't miss with fresh ingredients and patience to stir frequently.

I tried this recipe several months ago, and there are WAY too many mushrooms called for! It was so strong, even my husband couldn't eat it, and he loves the 'shrooms. I could definitely see the potential, though, and am going to try this recipe again on Valentine's day with about 1/2-1 lb of portobellos. I'm looking forward to trying it again!
**Update - tried this again with about 6oz portobellos and hubby and I absolutely LOVE it! It's one of our faves and even the leftovers are great. Highly recommend it!

I combined this recipe with another one I found.  I added some bacon and minced garlic and cut down on the mushrooms.  The only one who didn't like it was my 7 year old.  Next time I'll leave out the parmasan as it overpowered the taste of the mushrooms and the bacon.  It sure was tasty though!

Now I see why this recipe is so highly rated. It's
kind of labor intensive, but so worth it. I scaled it
back to 4 servings, used 8 ounces of mushrooms,
substituted veggie stock for the chicken, 1/2 cup
chopped white onion for the shallots, added one
tablespoon of minced garlic, then left the rest as
the recipe is written. This risotto was far better
than I've had in any restaurant. Thanks Myleen
for a 5 star recipe that is highly recommended!

What a great recipe!  I only included the white mushrooms rather than including also the portobello mushrooms.  The parmesan cheese, which softens the taste of the risotto, acts as a gelatine so to speak by keeping the risotto firm on the plate.  I combined this tasty dish with the cheesy chicken and chive sauce!  What a combination since both dishes have parmesan cheese and chives as ingredients.  My girlfriend told me it was the best supper I've ever prepared for her thanks mostly to this great risotto dish.

This is a great recipe!  I read the reviews and saw the author's comments  concerning cutting the amount of mushrooms in half.  My only other change was to add some minced garlic with the shallots.  The result was great!  Creamy, rich risotto.  This would be a great starting point for a main course if you added additional ingredients or it's great as written as a side dish.  Thanks Myleen.

This is a staple recipe for us - very easy, if you have the time to stir. We use veggie broth instead of chicken, and not nearly as many mushrooms as called for, but it always turns out marvelously. I've also used this base recipe for asparagus risotto, delicious.

The rating is for the version I made, not what's in the recipe.  I'm convinced the mushroom amounts given are typos; I used a 10-ounce package of baby bellas, and it was plenty mushroom-y enough for me.  Granted, I'm not a huge fungus person, but still.

I also added more shallots, but next time I think I'll step up the aromatics even further with some garlic.  Still, a good recipe.  Will become my "base" risotto, I think.  I'm already planning an artichoke heart version...

This was my first time ever making risotto because I usually don't have the time, but I am so glad I had the time today!  This is an awesome recipe!!  I would definitely cut the mushrooms in half next time though.  There was a ton of mushrooms.

Very good.  I was not expecting anything special and was pleasantly surprised.  I appreciate the simplicity of the recipe - it's something I could easily teach to friends who "don't know how to cook" that would give them some confidence.  Thank you for posting this.

Consensus has it that this rice dish is absolutely fabulous. I side with this majority. I like my rice slightly past al dente so I added another cup of wine and another cup of broth, as others did. Remember this recipe if you ever find yourself on "Hell's Kitchen".

Great basic recipe. You need to adjust cooking time and fluids according to type of rice used and how much liquid is released from the mushrooms after cooking them. I enjoyed this very much but my kids didn't care for it; not sure if it's the mushroom flavor or the color it gave to the rice. Check out the photo of my first attempt.

I've made this a couple of times and its fantastic. Being vegetarian I always use a vegetable stock and haven't had any complaints yet!
My fussy teenage son loves it without the mushrooms and with extra onions and leeks.
Brilliant!!

Very mushroom-y! Would be nice paired with steak. This took longer to cook than the recipe indicated, but was otherwise good. I used twice the wine and cheese. One tip - use quality ingredients. I tried dried mushrooms and butter substitute the first time and it was not good.

UNbelievable!  i used only a half pound of portabellos to save $$ and a full pound of white mushrooms, and i think it was definitely fine without the extra half-pound.  took me longer than anticipated (maybe 45 minutes for all the broth to be absorbed), but ENTIRELY worth it.  highly recommended.

This was my first time making Risotto.  This is a time consuming, but well worth the results.  I didn't use Arborio rice, but substituted a short grain rice and you could not have tasted nor seen the difference.  I used less mushroom than was called for. I accidently left out the chives, though it was still great.  I will definately make this again.

This was great, even with the changes I made because I didn't have all the ingredients.  First, as per other reviewers, I only used about half of the mushrooms call for.  Then, because I didn't have any shallots, I used half a white onion.  I didn't have the Arborio rice, either, so I used just regular white rice.  I skipped the  white wine because I didn't have any.  I added 1 Tablespoon of Sesame Seed Oil for flavor to the onion and rice mixture.  I had leftover salmon from the night before that I heated up with a little butter and lemon juice that I then added.  I completely forgot the Parmesan but I'm sure that would have made it even better!!  It was fabulous.  My kids even wanted seconds!!

First time I have ever made risotto. Turned out perfectly. I did not use all of the chicken broth. I used all but one cup. This will be a new go to side dish for my wife and myself. I served it with grilled chicken breast, butterflied.

It was super good, but instead of chicken broth I used vegetable broth. Its a little salty but that can easily be fixed by not adding so much salt. The more mushrooms the merrier but I  used about a cup of each. Also took wayyyy longer than 20 minutes and like 9 cups of water.

This could not have been more delicious and quite easy. Directions extremely easy to follow. I am a vegan; therefore, I used a box of vegetable broth that I had in the cabinet, which was all I had on hand at the time. In doubling my recipe, I needed 12 cups of liquid total. My broth equaled four cups, and I simply added 8 cups of water to the broth. I did not have shallots in the house, so I used the green tops of scallions. I also used half the amount of mushrooms the recipe originally called for. All in all, it came amazingly delicious; and in adding some additional salt and some extra pepper, I found as much flavor as one could want. The wine really gives it the old-world flavor of this beautiful dish.

My daughter, 20 years old, was hellbent on making this for us for dinner!  She has very little cooking skills but is always up for a challenge.  This was by far, the BEST risotto I have ever had!  SO GOOD!!  It was actually quite easy.... just time consuming.  She was very proud as were we!  Quick note.... we opted for the unsalted chicken stock and it was perfect!

My boyfriend found this recipe and I am very grateful. All I can say is  wow ! A beautiful, delicate, and absolutely delicious mushroom risotto! We followed the directions and found that a 30 was the complete cook time and well worth the wait. This recipe is perfect for mushroom lovers. My boyfriend and I will be making this again :) I would give 10 stars if I could! Thank you for sharing Myleen :)

This turned out delicious.  Best of all, my company all commented on it as well.  However, I had to stir the broth for over 30 minutes to get the consistency required.  I also made this ahead of time, since I did not want to stir while the company was present.  It turned out fine.  I heated the risotto and added the cheese and served.

The recipe is perfect the way it is! Remember that this is SIX servings and made to be a MAIN DISH. Use ALL the mushrooms. Don't skimp on the wine; white cooking wine at the grocery is good. Take the FULL 20 minutes to stir in the broth in the risotto. Slowly adding the broth and having the broth sizzling is key. It's beautiful the way it's written. Also, use the freshest ingredients. This is risotto -- there is no easy or quick way to make it edible. Get a block of parmesan and grate it. Get fresh chives. Get the correct mushrooms. It's really delicious. Also, be sure to stir in the parmesan cheese a little at a time and OFF THE HEAT. Seriously, when it says to take it off the heat, take it completely off. Don't leave it on a burner that's turned off.

Very good risotto. I have made at least dozen times so far, with couple of changes. I omit the whine for religious diet restriction and always use just 1 pound of mushrooms, any kind I have on hand and there is, still plenty of mushrooms and mushroom flavor in the risotto. Also, if no shallots in the house, I use half small onion chopped.

This was my first time making risotto and it turned out great. I read through the comments and cut the amount of mushrooms  in half...but I might add a half pound more because I really love mushrooms. I also used a mix of shiitake, oyster, crimini mushrooms which added great flavor and texture.

Basic recipe is good however, I have been making risotto for over forty years and I would like to add these suggestions.  Chicken broth should be home made.  Set a cup of broth aside with a healthy pinch of saffron to open the taste of the Risotto.  Add the broth the same way as this recipe.  I use half the amount of the mushrooms stated but I use Porcini  and Portobello cooked the same way but for about five minutes on medium to high heat and added the same way.  Add the freshly grated Parmesan, I use half of cup and when serving, I sprinkle more on top of each serving.   I do cook it for almost forty minutes to get the risotto nice and creamy.  I promise you this is delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written and it was the most amazing risotto we've ever had. We served it with salmon and it was, by far, one of the best meals we've  ever eaten! Thank you for sharing--I'll be making this again and again.

Awesome recipe! I love risotto and this really satisfied my craving for it. I only used button mushrooms to save a few bucks but I really want to try it again with both types. Man I love mushrooms...

This recipe was excellent, my wife was begging for more and has been craving it for a week since. I was a little liberal with the wine, and probably didn't end up using a cup or two (at least) of broth.

One of my all-time favorite recipes. I tweaked it alittle by adding cleaned and pre-boiled shrimp (500g) and doubled the parmesan. It takes me longer to cook than the recipe states, but this extra effort is truly worth it. Bravo!

Oh my freaking god this was amazing. Maybe the best thing I've ever cooked. We cut the mushrooms in half cause it looked like a lot, but I think more would have been okay too.

It takes time and energy to make risotto, but it is a great meal. I cut my mushrooms thick to add additional texture and bold flavor. Some seared scallops or grilled lobster on top will add additional protein and variety.

This is a little labor intensive but oh so good!!  I have made this several times exactly according to recipe and it is amazing.  I do have one piece of advice though, use good chicken stock.  One time I made the stock with bouillon and it wasn't nearly as rich and creamy.

This is the first recipe I've ever made for risotto, with some tweaks of my own:

I add in a couple of diced and pan-cooked chicken thighs, substitute garlic for the shallots, and add in some parsley and more parmesan cheese than I probably have a right to put in risotto (what? I like cheese!). I also kind of fudged on the mushroom amounts, based on the comments and just on eyeing the amount.

Let's just say that my friends LOVED it, and my boyfriend, who works in a fancy Italian restaurant (aka, I can't afford it without his discount!) said it tastes just the like the one Chef makes at his work.

This is the first time that I've made risotto.  I'm glad that I read the comments before starting otherwise I would have never kept the chicken stock hot. I would have tried adding it cold and it would have taken much longer to cook.  My family absolutely loved it and I'm excited to make variations  and experiment.  Thanks!

Yummy risotto.....  I made this last night for dinner, and I'm eating leftovers for lunch today.  It was delicious with dinner, but it is even more awesome reheated the next day!

When I made it, I doubled the wine, added 3 cloves garlic to the shallots, used 1 lb mushrooms, and doubled the parm cheese.  All of the flavors are enhanced when eating it the next day...  the mushrooms, garlic, wine, and chives have come alive.

Also -- I served this with grilled chicken breasts marinated in Italian dressing.  I took the leftover chicken, cut it into chunks, and mixed it in with the leftover risotto.  Great addition!

Wow! So good. I made it exactly as written. No changes at all. However, I did cook it for closer to 45 minutes, constantly stirring and adding the broth. Really worth the effort.

Love it! I like to add a clove or two of garlic with the shallots, and sometimes I substitute the last cup of chicken stock with heavy cream or half and half, when I have it on hand. It makes it even richer and creamier.

I live in Germany and since it's an Asparagus season, I cooked this with white asparagus instead of mushrooms. I also cooked it with 1 cup of Prosecco instead of 1/2 normal dry white wine and cut off half the butter....and it turned out to be wonderful!!! I will definitely make this again, next time with mushrooms.

Easiest and most delicious recipe I've ever made. I used half the mushrooms called for. The recipe scales down well, for those looking for less than 6 servings. I served it with a reverse seared steak and grilled asparagus, best side ever. Going to make it right now because I've been craving it!!

This is the best risotto recipe I've ever found. It works with veggie broth or water in place of chicken broth for a vegetarian version, too. You can also sub different cheeses and replace the white wine with another alcohol or water. Cognac and gruyere made a nice combination.

It seemed to lack flavor despite adding more salt, parmesan cheese, and even some truffle oil.

Husband and I loved this!  I've always wanted to try my hand at creating a risotto, and this combination was better than our favorite Italian restaurant's!  It's a lot of work, but it was worth it!

Just prepared it yesterday and it is awesome.  I used onions and garlic as a substitute for shallots.  For an "earthier" taste, I replaced the portobellos and white mushrooms with fresh shiitake and buna-shimeji mushrooms.

This was great, I changed it up a bit, switched the wine for white grape juice and I used basmati rice but it still turned out great. Big Hit!

I've only made risotto a few times, but this one is by far one of the best I've made.  This will be my go-to risotto recipe from this point on; which is saying a lot because I don't really like to stand over a stove stirring.  I will probably make this once or twice a month from now on.  Very tasty...

This recipe is amazing!  I made it twice, the first I used chicken stock as directed, which seemed overpowering to me.  The 2nd time I used vegetable stock which was so much better.

This was absolutely amazing!  I pretty much followed the directions as is - although I didn't measure the wine and probably had a heavy hand.  The only downside is the stirring.  It takes a while.  Luckily I had a 9 year old to stand over the stove and stir.  Will make again!

This was my first time making risotto and it came out fantastic. I followed another reviewer's recommendation to add the broth one ladleful at a time, and it took FOREVER. I think it would have been just fine had I done it the way the recipe suggests, 1/2 cup at a time. Also, the recipe doesn't specify what heat to cook it over while you're adding the broth. I found that low was insufficient and contributed to it taking forever. Medium-low to medium is better. Great recipe!

I had Mushroom Risotto at a seminar and loved it. I used the recipe here last night and thought it was even better than the one at the seminar. The prep and cooking took longer than the 50 minutes advertised but it is well worth it. Tonight I find out if, like lasagna, it's even better the second day.

Agree with many others, 
I used small amount of dried porcini mushrooms, a bit more wine, and cooked this more slowly constantly adding liquid.
Nevertheless the proportions of rice and liquid and ingredients made for a delicious risotto!

My family loved this risotto. I didn't have any white wine so I used water. I nixed the shallots, sautéed onions in the butter then added the rice. Instead of Parmesan cheese I used pepper jack. Followed the rest of the recipe as stated. End result was delicious.

This was great in a pinch.  Anything I didn't have on hand, I just substituted with what I did have. I only had half the amount of portabellas and used onions instead of shallots. I also used fontinella cheese instead of parm. It was delicious and I think would be a great base for any other flavors you may want to add in.

Do not need to add extra chicken stock flavouring and more Parmesan cheese than the recipe calls for. Perfect as is. If anything, may need a little more chicken broth to cook rice to perfect tenderness (so have extra broth on hand if needed). Used half the amount of white mushrooms as the recipe called for and it was perfect, and still had perhaps a little too many mushrooms. Couldn't imagine anymore mushrooms!

Made this tonight to accompany a roasted garlic stuffed colossal shrimp wrapped in pancetta... I used the revised/recommended amount of making the mushrooms only 1 pound instead of 2 and was just right. I did 1/2 lb crimini sliced, 1/4 lb oyster split but caps intact, and 1/4 lb shiitake sliced. 

I made changes like adding in fresh thyme and chives, about a tablespoon or so each, when I sauteed the mushrooms.  I used stock instead of broth. I also salt and peppered the mushrooms when I sauteed them to have the water drawn from the mushrooms when I sauteed.  I added the rest of the thyme and chives (again, about a tablespoon each) right after I added the mushrooms and cheese. I had some Grana Padano cheese and low on my block of Parmesan, that I did a half and half mix, freshly and finely grated. Do not use "green tube" fauxnparmesan for this recipe. 

My SO (boyfriend) and I did not find this bland by any means. If anything we were quite pleased with the fact that there was so much mushroom punch in flavor but not overpowering and the texture so creamy.

I read the recipe and not the comments before I went shopping that I do have another LB of mushrooms to use, and when shopping seemed excessive. I'm actually fighting making another batch of  risotto where I originally was thinking stroganoff!

For those that found bland, split herbs in half and use when sauteeting the shrooms w/ s&p.  Only used 36 oz of stock to reach al dente which is subjective to rice and taste.

Just cooked this yesterday for my family they all loved it ! My family don't like aldente, so I lowered the heat and constantly mixed the rice adding even smaller amounts broth. I was told it was even better than what one person ate at a gourmet restaurant couple days ago ! My second time cooking risotto ! So it's easier to do a good job with this !

This may be closer to 3.5 stars.  I wanted to follow it as closely as written in order to give it a fair rating and I never imagined I'd utter these words, but "there were way too many mushrooms."  A couple of things to note:  I bought pre-sliced mushrooms and they probably weren't as thinly sliced as the recipe intended, so I actually had to cook them in step 2 for about 10 minutes, instead of 3 minutes, and they probably could've cooked a little longer.  Next time, I'll start with the baby bellas for about 2 minutes and then add the whites.  I added just a little yellow onion in with the shallots because I had it and needed to use it.  It took a little longer than 2 minutes to get the rice to a pale, golden color.  Finally, I used parsley instead of chives at the end of the recipe and only used about 3 T. of  butter.  This had good flavor, but again, just too many mushrooms.  Oddly enough, the package of baby bellas that I used had a recipe on the carton for mushroom risotto that I may try next time.  The ratio for mushrooms to rice in that recipe is 1 lb mushrooms to 1 c. rice.  Also, the broth in that recipe is a combination of vegetable broth and water (2:1), so it would be a little cheaper to make, although it may not be as flavorful.

Oh my good golly gosh! this was probably one of the best side dishes i have ever had! I have been afraid of Risotto for years...people telling me how bad you have to slave over it...don't over cook...well it's worth every moment at the stove! Taste often as it cooks though....i made it exact-i will say that making a meat and veg were challenging...someone told me to make a meat in the oven and that helped if you have no one to tend to your grill-fantastic.....

I really liked this recipe and it turned out pretty good considering it was my first attempt.  It should be noted, however that the cook time was WAY over 15 or 20 mins. I plan my dinners so they are ready about 20 minutes before my boyfriend leaves for work,  and I just happened to start this super early (almost one hour) and I still had to rush. Overall, we were pleased with the outcome.

LOVED this risotto!  Added a couple little touches.  Does take longer than stated time for the perfect texture.  Took about 40 minutes.  I added 1 TBSP of butter and a large dollop of marscapone at the end for a delicious creamy texture.  Also added 3/4 c of frozen peas.  Will definitely make it again!  Dianne

At first I thought there would be too many mushrooms, but it worked out nicely in the end. Minimal prep and cooking time. A very fun dish for having a few friends over for dinner.  Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

I liked this (but I LOVE mushrooms) and the rest of the family just thought it was OK.  I don't think I cooked the rice enough as it wasn't too creamy.  It was tender but not creamy (like I have tasted risotto to be).  I think it's my fault, though, as I had never tried risotto before this and I know that there are tricks and tips to making good risotto.  My husband said the leftovers got really mushy and he doesn't mind having this again, just not as a leftover.

My first attempt at making risotto for my very Italian husband, and we both LOVED it! Wouldn't change a thing, however the second time I made it I added chopped artichoke hearts which added a little more zing to it

Addictive and satisfying!! Thanks to many an aspiring chef on Hell's Kitchen I always thought risotto was impossible to make. Not so! You just have to nurse things for awhile and it seemingly does the rest. Thanks for this easy, amazing recipe!!

This recipe is amazing.  This was my first time making it, and it was soooo good.  I, too, cut out a lot of mushrooms.  I used an 8oz package of baby bellas and chopped them.  Instead of parm, I added a small handful of crumbled goat cheese at the end and only 2 tblsps of butter (too fatty with the cheese).  I was inspired by this amazing risotto I had at an Italian restaurant which was made with goat cheese, honey and rosemary.  Next time I am trying that without the mushrooms.  This is so versatile...you could add seafood, asparagus, whatever.  Such a great basic risotto start.  Liquid amount was perfect, stirring is the key.  It took me more like 30 minutes of stirring.  Goat cheese is KEY!

Thanks, Myleen for posting this recipe back in 2005.  It may be an oldie, but it is a Goldie.  This was so absolutely cool!  My first risotto.  I feel like I'm turning a corner in my pursuit of learning to cook quality food and learning cooking techniques.  It came out perfecto!  I caramelized two small white onions and re-hydrated 1.76 oz of Shiitake mushrooms while my chicken broth was heating up.  While at the same time in a separate small pan, I sauteed some pancetta.  You might say, I had a lot going on at once. :)  Next, I melted 2 tbsp of butter, the real kind, Baby (the old Paula Dean, rocks!), added the Arborio rice, a 1/2 cup of Biltmore's Sauvignon Blanc wine, reduced, then started adding my broth in increments of 1/2 cup until the rice was al dente.  At this stage of the game, I added 2 tbsp of butter, the mushrooms, a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, the pancetta, fresh chopped chives, salt, and pepper to taste.  And to top it off, a squeeze of fresh lemon over the dish to add a little zing.  Woooooo, Buddy!  Me likey risotto.  Me likey!  Me likey!  Me likey! And, Mi Gato Loco presented me with another of those prized and golden Stamp of Approval (SOA).

This is some amazing stuff!!  I've made this several times and have found you can use whatever kind of mushrooms you want.  I used dried chives instead of fresh.  I've also found I like it best when I put some chopped garlic in it too.  This always takes me longer to make than the time stated - the stirring takes a long time, but it is oh so worth it!

Only good in small amounts.  Gets too cheesy and gooey.  Will stick to regular sticky rice and put a slice of cheese on top with mushrooms on the side.

I am a risotto fan and I was very pleased with this dish.  I agree with some other reviewers that the quantity of mushrooms required by the recipe was too much, I roughly halved that amount and it was fine. I also added the juice of about 1/2 a lemon or more to add some zing and it was wonderful.  We served it at Christmas with Cornish Hen stuffed with lemon and rosemary.

I made this for company & even my friend said this was way too much liquid for the amount of rice. It took 40 min to cook & while the flavour was excellent, it was mushy. I will make it again but reduce the liquid to about 4 cups.

Well, I just finished making this recipe and it's excellent! things I changed not for any specific reason were: 2 cups rice, 1 cup of wine and 1 tablespoon of garlic pepper, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese,unsalted butter , Nature's Promise low sodium broth. I will add in an onion next time maybe even some craisins:) after it's done. This recipe is smooth in flavor and far from bland. Serving it with Boneless chicken breasts sliced in half cooked stove top with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic pepper until browned and a salad. Love to try new Risotto recipes and this one is a keeper. 
 Thank you

First crack at making risotto and it worked out beautifully!  I followed the advice on the other reviews and cut the amount of mushrooms in half which I think was wise as it had just the perfect amount of mushroom flavor.  I found I needed more olive oil than 2 Tbsp to cook the mushrooms and to coat the rice.  I used exactly 6 cups of stock with the wine and the rice was perfectly cooked.  It did take about 30 minutes to cook from when I first added the rice.  Wonderful, creamy & flavorfull dish!  Will be making this again!!

This was my first attempt to eat/make Risotto.  After seeing that guy on TV yell at everyone about Risotto I wanted to know what it was all about.  Every Friday after work I make a point to stop at Caputo's (you Chicagoland folks will know what I'm talking about) to attempt to make some Italian dish.  This one doesn't disappoint.  I always read the reviews before I make something on this site and I must say that after slicing the mushrooms I was apprehensive about the volume but they cook down nicely.  I would still say that if you don't love mushrooms, rather like them, you could cut them down.  Otherwise, I was stunned and absolutely loved it the way it was.  I also used a Pinot and thought it tasted quite nice.

I found this recipe turned out with the perfect consistency. I replaced half the butter at the end of the recipe with 2 tbsp of truffle oil to add flavor, and probably did use fewer mushrooms as well.

I already made this twice in one week after everyone tried it! FYI if you use chicken stock instead of broth, you dont need to add any extra salt!

Delicious! Even my Italian hubby thought it was the bomb!  We did need to adjust the cooking time though, and I didn't really measure the broth . . . just made sure that I had a nice big pan of hot broth available to keep adding from.  I used to ask my MIL "how much" of something in a recipe . . . and she say "as much as it takes" . . . which is the case in this recipe with the broth.  You have to keep adding slowly, cooking & stirring until the rice is done.  Mine cooked for probably 45 - 50 minutes before the rice was done.  You have to taste and see . . . don't just go by the time in the recipe.   If you follow this advise, you will end up with five star restaurant quality risotto!  Buon Appetito!

I have never had/made risotto before, but I always wanted to, so I made this. It was awesome! My neighbor came over while I was cooking it and would not leave until she got to try it. She loved it as well. Well worth the time, will make it again and again.

Wow wow wow. This recipe is fantastic!!  Since this was my first time ever making risotto, I followed the instructions exactly and it came out amazing. To everyone who says it takes much longer, you must not have your stock or your skillet hot enough, because the time was perfect for me. Thanks for a recipe that everyone loved and made me so proud of my first risotto!

Excellent.  I followed the recipe as is, slightly cutting back on the mushrooms as the texture isn't a favorite of mine.  That said, this dish is superb.  Only make enough for the meal you'll be serving as I don't think risotto quite lends itself to leftovers.

This is awesome!  It does take longer than the recipe calls for, don't do this if you are distracted by another dish...it does take time, but it is wonderful!  And I didn't use wine because I usually don't like the taste of it in dishes. Also I used Romano cheese.  I just loved this dish!

This is great - my first time ever making risotto.  Served with a fish dish.  I used fat-free, reduced sodium broth (I had beef and chicken to use up) and 8 oz of cremini and 4 oz of white baby mushrooms.   Used 2/3 cup of diced sweet onion instead of shallots (didn't have any), and omitted 2 tbsp of oil, using a non-stick cooking spray to do the mushrooms and then the onion.  I added one tbsp to the translucent onion mixture when I was ready to add the rice.  Only used 2 tsp of butter - but didn't feel we really even needed it--could easily be omitted.  This was a really dish.  Thank you Myleen!  BTW - a serving is a little more than 3/4 of a cup.

After seeing many shows where chefs made risotto I decided to give it a go. The first time i made it it came out perfectly. Second time I made 2 batches in separate pans and stopped cooking early and threw it in a warmed up crock pot and went to and event. It was hit. Thanks, the direction and ingredients were perfect.

Amazing!  We added a splash of truffle oil at the end as well, because I am obsessed with truffle oil.  Recommend it if you have it on hand.  Either way, great recipe!

This was delicious and not hard to make. I used fewer mushrooms than the recipe called for since I only had white mushrooms on hand. I also added some pre-cooked chopped bacon. This is a great base recipe and you can add whatever additional ingredients to your own taste. It was the first time that I made risotto and this recipe is a keeper!

FIVE STARS! WONDERFUL! THIS RECIPE HAS BECOME MY FALL-BACK BASIC. I CHANGE IT AROUND, ADD A MEAT/SEAFOOD. ALWAYS ADD AT LEAST 3 CLOVES MINCED GARLIC AND HAVE SUBSTUIUTED DIFFERENT ONIONS (WHATEVER I HAVE HANDY) INSTEAD OF THE SHALLOTS. NOT FOR DIET CONSCIOUS, BUT ALWAYS DO THE BUTTER AND CHEESE. THEY MAKE IT CREAMIER AND FLAVOR.

This was quite good, but here were my differences: I didn't have arborio rice, so I used long grain. First mistake: if you're using long grain rice, don't add 1/2 C at a time. Put in the white wine, let the rice absorb it, and then pour in all the broth and let the rice cook to package directions. After 30 minutes of adding 1/2 C broth at a time, the long grain rice was still undercooked. Also, I didn't thinly slice the mushrooms. I just chopped them up into small pieces and threw them in the skillet to get sauteed. Worked beautifully. Parmesan cheese? I didn't taste it at all, so why add the calories? Next time, no Parmesan. Really liked the taste and texture of this recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

Holy yumminess!!  I have tried numerous recipies from this web site and always read plenty of reviews to get a good grasp on the outcome.  This recipe was hands down in the top three for me as far as taste.  It really wasn't difficult to make at all, maybe a little time consuming for some people. I made it exactly as the recipe suggests and it was super deilicious!! Making it again tonight and had to leave my review.

VERY GOOD!  Forgiving too!  I sautéed the mushrooms in the butter, and did not add more in the end.  I adjusted for the mushroom butter sauce that sweated off in the bowl when they were resting.  I added just a touch of lemon pepper in the last few minutes.  It was DIVINE!  Fun and flexible recipe!

OUTSTANDING. I love this recipe. I would say it's the best risotto I've ever made except it's the first and only recipe I've tried because I just can't see any reason to look for another. I've made it countless times and it's so delicious. I never have portabellos on hand, but it's wonderful with any type or probably none at all. I will say I agree with the other reviewers that it takes more than 15-20 minutes. More like 45 for me but that could also be because I live at 4200 ft elevation. I would make it if it took an hour. It's worth every minute. Plus, tonight we fed 7 people and I still have leftovers. Thank you!!

Fantastic!  Here's what I changed based on the reviews I read before making.  No matter what a risotto recipe calls for in terms of time, I figure 40 t0 45 minutes, and that was true for this recipe.  So much depends on your pans, your stove, etc...  I have killer pans but cook in a Wilma Flintstone kitchen.  Slow is best for me when making risotto.  I think 4 to 5 cups of chicken broth would be more the norm for this recipe.  I cut the mushrooms and butter in half and used a lot of shallots because so many reviewers wanted more flavor.  I decided to toss in 1/4 tsp. of freshly grated nutmeg, and I used 1/4 C. wine and 1/4 cup dry sherry because I love the taste of sherry in risotto.  It was to die for.  Maybe thyme would be a good addition instead of chives if you like the flavor.  Thanks for this recipe.  It is so delicious.

I used long grain brown rice in this recipe, so I obviosly had to cook and stir much longer (about 45 minutes) and it tasted great. 6 cups broth is too much though and I had a cup leftover.

I made this risotto a while ago. This time, I added in some leftover butternut squash and broccoli stems. It turned out surprisingly beautiful and tasty!

I Did not have white wine so used ccider and rice wine vinegar, I also substituted red onion for shallots as they were what I had. So I cannot atest to the full recipe. However I was pleased with the results. I had bought Arboro rice and mushroom to make rice risotto and went looking for a recipe and found this. Keeping the broth warm sure worked better than my previous rissottos where I added cold liqiud and it took so much longer.

Great recipe.

Meh, nothing special.  The ratio of rice to liquid was perfect and the recipe did make a creamy, lovely textured risotto.  However, it lacked flavor.  I tried adding extra cheese, a little more salt, some garlic and then even some caramelized onion by the end it was better but still bland.  I would love to say I would know what to add to make it better but I am at a loss.   Thank you for submitting and I will use this as a basis again but next time I will experiment more with additional ingredients to spice it up.

This recipe was a bit difficult to follow; however having watch risotto be made a thousand times, I did just fine.  It was amazing!!  I thought for sure there were too much mushrooms or it was going to be bland and it was simply amazing!!!  I used Savignon Blanc for my white wine.  Great recipe thanks for sharing.

Made this last night for Valentine's Day and it was absolutly AMAZINGGGG!!!! I am not a cook and thought I was going to have a hard time with this since risotto is supposibly not an easy dish, I was wrong. Didn't use any pepper and a pinch of salt. I can't wait to make it again. I put this on a side with steak and asparagus with pine nuts & cranberries ( another recipe I found on the side which is also delicious). I am looking forward to cooking my next meal now :)

To those who want to avoid the wine in this recipe because of the alcohol: no need to, because all of the alcohol will be evaporated by the time the risotto is done. So even your 3 year old daughter can eat this.

Best risotto I've ever had!  I was always intimidated by risotto that I never thought I could make it myself, but it really was very easy.  The only downfall was having to add only 1/2 cup of broth at a time and stir constantly for ~20 minutes.  However, it was SO worth it!  The only changes I made were to cut the amount of mushrooms in half (as specified in other reviews), cut the butter in half, and add some leftover rotisserie chicken breast.  It was very yummy and will definitely be a staple in our home!

Wonderful recipe! I found it took twice as long to absorb all the broth - but well worth the wait! I found amount of mushrooms was fine. I didn't adjust as some of the other reviewers suggested. The only thing I'd change was - I used bouillon cubes to make broth - I'd use less cubes next time as it was a little salty.  Otherwise, absolutely perfect!

This was just ok for me.  Easy to make but took some attention & time.  It wasn't bad but I didn't like it enough to make it again.

This was wonderful, I did use less liquid approx 5cups and shiitake mushrooms instead of portobello.  I will make this again.

Having never made risotto in my life (and I love to try cooking everything....) I was a little intimidated. But this was PERFECT. I couldn't find all the right mushrooms, so I used baby bellas and portobella, and crimini as the mushrooms. I didn't use all of the chicken broth, but because the recipe had me adding it in slowly, it helped to let me add how much I felt was appropriate. It came out absolutely PERFECT.

This tastes amazing! I loved it and so did my husband. 
I added a sprinkling of lemon juice and a few leaves of fresh thyme to add dimension, but it really doesn't need it. Next time I'll add some garlic too, just because I love the flavour garlic gives to a recipe.
This is definitely worth a try!

Used all portabellos.  No shallots, but onion juice and some roasted garlic powder when cooking the mushrooms.  Added sliced up leftover grilled chicken breast to the finished product.  I took my time with this recipe, so it was actually closer to two hours from start to finish.  But it turned out AMAZING!

Incredible! I used this as the side dish to a mushroom themed meal [this, a recipe that was for mushroom pork chops where I subbed chicken instead, and roasted asparagus with balsamic reduction- my own recipe I made up on the spot], but even so, it was really the star of the plate. I used a handful of dried mushrooms and soaked them in the warm chicken broth for a half hour. I wound up throwing them out mostly, realizing that the texture of reconstituted mushrooms wasn't at all appropriate to the dish, but I had plenty of fresh to finish it off with, and the soak gave the chicken broth an extra kick. Recommended if you can afford to waste a bit of money on it, or you can try to find some kind of similar product.

The fresh mushrooms were reduced by half a pound in my case, and turned out to be plenty as it was. It did turn out to be the most labor intensive thing I made that day, but worth every second. Will make it again when I feel like being fancy~!

I was very happy with this recipe! I put about 18 ounces of mushrooms which I think may equivalent to a little less than 2 lbs. I had Moscato in my fridge and it worked out fine. I didn't use all 6 cups of the chicken broth as the risotto cooked before then but I would still set aside 6 cups just in case. Didn't need much salt afterwards. So delicious! Will be making it again :)

I've never left a review and I've made several recipes from this site.  This risotto was to die for!  It was the first risotto I had ever made so I was a bit nervous it wasn't going to come out the right way.  I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced the shallots with 2 tbs of white onion and used only 2 tbs of butter.  My fiance and I litterally argued over who got to eat the leftovers.  SO GOOD! You must make this!

Having never had risotto, I liked the recipe.  It's possible that Hell's Kitchen raised my expectations or my execution was off.  This was good, but not great.

I made this for dinner last night with steak, salad and asparagus.  This was by far the star of the show, everyone loved it!!! Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I made it exactly as the recipe calls with the addition of 2 cloves of garlic (I add garlic to everything!).

This was my first time ever making risotto and this recipe turned out PERFECT!  The only thing that I added was 1 oz of dried porcini mushrooms (reconstructed in 1 cup chicken broth), and a TSP of thyme.  My husband loved this dish!  Thanks Myleen.

A lovely recipe.  This was my first time making risotto, and it was a huge success.  I did make a couple changes.  I used beef broth rather than chicken, simply because I find it goes so well with the meaty taste of portabellos.  I didn't have quite enough mushrooms, so I dug some dried shitakes out of the cupboard and added them in.  I only used 5 cups of broth, and used 1 cup of half & half to add creaminess.  I added thyme in with the shallots, because I love them paired with mushrooms.  Finally, I forgot to pick up chives, so they were omitted.

this was really good, even though the next time I make it, I'll put less/no butter, because in the end the taste was too buttery (only for me though) - great recipe! totally beat my boyfriend's sun dried tomato risotto :) thank you very much!

Excellent.  Used 1/2 mushrooms and white because we paired with braised short ribs.  Perfect addition. Agree with others re: salt.  Recommend low sodium or cut it with water.  Nice dinner paired with Petit Syrah or red that is big up front, but with a smooth finish to not overpower the meaty flavors. Thanks!!

One of the more delicious risottos that I've found; cut back on the mushrooms, and use a variety...haven't found one that didn't taste good in this recipe.

Great recipe. I used fresh organic Shiitake mushrooms instead of what was listed. You also don't need as much broth (I used chicken stock), but keep it by just in case. I also added asparagus, which gave it an excellent flavor. Shred some fresh Parmesan at the end, and it's a great meal all on it's own!

reduced the mushrooms.  Also, my skillet with the rice was med-hot and even though the broth was just warm, once you add it to the rice it boils immediately (temperature was left out of step 3 and this worked for me and was what I saw elsewhere to ensure the cook time was met)

Labor of Love..I reconstituted dried porcini mushrooms in half hot H20 and milk for 24hrs. Added white mushroom slices for another 24hrs. Drained and saved liquid to add during the last cooking stage of rice. Meridian Pinot Grigio was perfect in the rice and served with dinner. What a delicious dish!

This was fantastic! I have been using recipes off of this site for several years now and this is the first time I just had to rate one. It did take a little longer than what was said, but that was because this was my first time making risotto and I really didnt know exactly how dry to let it get before adding the next half cup. I actually added about a pound and a half because  2lbs seemed like too many mushrooms. Even the pound and a half was too many, but that didnt take away from the dish any. Thank you so much for sharing!

Great Risotto !!! I made it exactly as the recipe except I dissolved a chicken bouillon cube in boiled water instead of the broth because I didn't have any. Thanks for the recipe Myleen

This may take awhile to cook, but it is well worth it.  I couldn't find portobellos at a reasonable price, so I just used two pounds of white mushrooms, and it seemed to turn out just fine.

Very flavorful! Would be interested to see if you could do without the Portobellos and keep the flavor....they colored the dish a not-so-pleasing color and made it mostly mushroom.

This was amazing!  I halved the recipe and it was perfect for two.  I also added some Mrs. Dash chicken seasoning to the mushroom mixture - which is good on everything - and added garlic powder to the onions while cooking.  SOOOOO good.  Empty pan = happy tummy.

My first rating after several tried all recipes ...this is aweseome! Cooking time is about right at med/high and I did add a little extra wine as  some reviewers mentioned...why not:) I think adding a cup of broth at a time instead of a half would cut down the intensity of non stop cooking/stirring and still work. I did only use 1 pound of mushrooms...thanks for the recipe my husband loved it...5 star restaurant quality.

This is my first review of a recipe and I must say,   it's good. I typically don't follow the instructions for recipes. The kitchen is my creative outlet. But this time I did take my time and slowly pour in warm broth into the rice and it worked. The risotto was perfect. Of course, I made several changes. First, I doubled the amount of rice but didn't double the liquids. Second, I used garlic, celery, onion in the mushroom mix. I use garlic on almost everything so I can't resist. I didn't have shallots, so I put a mix of yellow onion and scallions in with the rice. It definitely takes longer than 30 minutes to cook. It's a great recipe. I have a full pot of risotta and I look forward to making it again for my family.

Excellent and actually easy despite the time consumed by stirring.  I followed the recipe relatively closely and the result was great.  Definitely see how versatile it could be as well.  Impressive, high-end flavor - give this one a try!

After I made this dish, I put a spoonful to my mouth and did a happy dance! It was so delicious and I was worried how the flavor would be. And it seemed like a lot of mushrooms. It was incredible and didn't need salt and pepper to taste because of how fabulous it was! I did take my time in letting all the broth absorb as someone recommended and the texture was perfect. I would give it ten stars if I could!

The recipe was phenomonal. My husband says it's the best thing I've ever made. I've never made risotto before, but after hearing risotto mentioned on Hell's Kitchen a hundred times I felt like I needed to make it.

Fantastic Risotto, I follow it other than cutting the mushrooms to 1lb.  I have made it about 6 times now, and am never disappointed. Thanks Myleen :)

This was outstanding!  The only thing I would do differently next time I make it is I would removed the fins from the underside of the portobellas.  They gave the dish a funky brown/grey colour.

A very delicious mushroom risotto with some easy ingredients.  I used 8 oz white and 8 oz mini bellas and my best bottle of EVOO.  Next time I am going it try it without the butter or maybe cut it in half.

This exchange happened between my boyfriend and I yesterday.  Me: I'm going to make risotto for dinner tonight!!  Bf: I don't like risotto.  A few hours later...  Bf: This is the best risotto I've ever had.  Me: I rule.     Thank you for a great recipe :) The only changes I made were cutting the amount of mushrooms in half as advised here and also I diced green onions instead of chives as I didn't have any on hand. I still prefer to use chives but it all worked out well anyway!

I made this for my fiance's bday.  It was absolutely amazing.  It is truly work - quite painful but absolutely worth it!!  I didn't use as many mushrooms and I did half portobello and half shitake instead.   I also cut the mushrooms up more - sliced was just too big for us.

made this pretty easily - didn't take as long as 50 minutes from beginning to end. took a short cut and put 1 cup of broth in each time, and then put a lid on it so it absorbed better (and i didn't have to stir). then only ended up using 4 cups of stock. also added onions in the beginning for extra texture and flavor! took 30 minutes from beginning to end!

Delish!  I used 1 lb of mushrooms, as the author corrected in a comment, and it was the perfect amount.  As a vegetarian, I substituted veggie broth for the chicken, and my husband didn't miss a thing.  I didn't have shallots on hand, so I used onion/garlic, but I think I will keep some around for the future.  Both my husband and I settled on the words woodsy and earthy to describe this hearty dish.  The flavors are complex, and the wine shines through.  Bravo, I'll definitely make this one again.

Excellent recipe and very similar to the way I make mine.  I cook some shitake and cremini mushrooms in the pot with a bit of EVOO, add some salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried parsley.  I then add the risotto and start cooking it.  Also, in addition to the freshly grated parmasan cheese, I also add some freshly grated romono cheese.

Outstanding dish.  You must drizzle a little top quality Truffle Oil on after you plate the dish.  Simply an amazing way to finish an already top notch recipe.  Works well with a nice Cabernet Sauvignon or Red Zinfandel.

Though I used this recipe as a launching pad, and my risotto turned out to my own liking, I cannot imagine this recipe would have tasted great had I followed it to a T.    First, 2lbs of mushrooms is more than excessive. I used less than 1lb and found it to be more than plenty.     Also, I added thyme--- this recipe was a little boring.     Lastly, I think the parmesean does nothing more for the recipe than to add calories, as the wine already gives the risotto a similar taste.     I also added a spoon full of mascarpone to the top of mine, delicious-- unlike the green onions, which I tried- but were a very strange topping to me.     Hope this is helpful to whoever tries this recipe out.

Very nice - it worked for me. Just keep stirring and have good quality stock. One tip - have more stock than you think you'll need. I have an electric stove, so it took longer for me and I had to keep spooning in the broth to make it work.

This was absolutely fabulous! I'm not a huge fan of large pieces of mushroom, so I only used 1/2 lb of portabello mushrooms, which I diced up fine before sauteeing, but it turned out creamy and delicious!  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

Oh, how I wish I could give this more stars! There is a reason this recipe still has a 5-star average after so many reviews. This is my first attempt at risotto, and it has met with my every expectation. My entire family loved it!  I found the 15-20 minutes cooking time to be spot on. I set the temp on my electric stove to about 5 1/2 (out of 10). The excess broth would almost boil, but not quite before being absorbed by the rice. I didn't use quite all of the broth (maybe 1/4 c. leftover?) because the risotto seemed to be fairly saturated and perfectly al dente at that point.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!

Good Risotto.  I didn't quite have enough mushrooms so I added some red pepper in place of some of the missing mushrooms.  Even still, there was an overwhelming mushroom taste.  And the overall result needed more zing/flavor.  I added lemon juice and chili.  (I have to say that I didn't add chives or parm cheese because of taste preferences).  Even still I think it needed more flavor, and the amount of broth, at least for me, was way too much.

I made this exactly according to recipe. Off the hook. Really, REALLY good. I made no changes and followed the recipe exact. Even my kids who are rice purists loved this. Because I'm doing a lower carb lifestyle, I only had a bite or two but you can trust me that it was pure heaven. NOTE: I want to say that if you are worried that this is expensive to make, it really wasn't. I bought most of the ingredients at Grocery Outlet, including a good, local wine and the portobello mushrooms. I also bought the arborio rice in bulk at WinCo. I did use organic chicken broth as well.

This is my hubby's favourite food ever!! We had a risotto phase where we ate it like 3 times a week at least, and we have since calmed down but hubby still loves it to death. I don't use any wine because we're both university students and any wine we have tends to disappear pretty quick. It's still yummy but I am curious about how it would taste with wine. I also tend to add some more parmesan than is called for and i omit black pepper since i really don't like black pepper. I also add in some spinach and cooked chicken at the end! And then we have a salad and some garlic bread, and it's so yummy!! I really appreciate the person who wrote this recipe, you're amazing!!

Good but slightly plain. I added a couple cloves of garlic, extra chives and about an extra half poubd of mushrooms! Also, I think more parmesan is always a good thing!

Very good! I used one 8 ounce box of portabellas, which I seasoned with basil and oregano. I only added 2 tablespoons of butter at the end.

I generally tweak recipes here and there, but I decided to follow this one precisely as directed. I was rewarded with an excellent dish that everyone raved about. Sure, it's plenty of work, but the end result is spectacular and worth the effort. Also, I believe the creator has since noted that the mushroom amount was a typo and should be cut in half, but I didn't cut it and had no problem with the rice-to-mushroom ratio.

After spending a year in Italy, I was a little hesitant to try this -- surely nothing could be as good as homemade risotto, courtesy of la nonna! Definitely a great, simple recipe for beginners and those more advanced. I used reduced sodium chicken stock to make sure the chicken flavor didn't overwhelm the mushroom (it didn't), as well as for health reasons.  Buonissimo!!

This came out fantastic.  However, it needs much longer than 30 minutes to cook in order for it to come out like risotto instead of paella. I cooked the rice for over an hour, adding very small amounts of liquid at a time.

This was excellent .I have tried my hand at Risotto once before and it did not turn out but this one was very very good. I did add two gloves of garlic to the mushrooms and I will leave out the chives next time. Will make again.

Yum! the only alterations I made were the following, I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, I used marsala wine, 2 cups of mushrooms, I omitted the chives, and added a dash of nutmeg. It turned out very good

So this is a great recipe for all the big mushroom fans out there, and if you dont consider yourself one of them... STAY AWAY... oh, and i used about a 1/3 of the mushrooms and had too many, be careful, b/c even the poster said she put way to many mushrooms when she wrote this. I would say about 2 portabellos and 8oz of white buttons. OH! and this takes much longer than list in regards to stirring, at least, if you want to do it right

Yummy!  The only changes I made were no shallots (or onions) because I didn't have any on hand and only 8 oz. of baby bellas and 8 oz. of button mushrooms.  I used a little extra Parmigiano because I love the flavor it adds.  This is only my second attempt at risotto and and it turned out wonderful and I would definitely make again.

Fabulous and so delicious!  We omitted shallots, chives, and the salt(since the chicken broth was pretty salty), and reduced the butter to one tablespoon.  Thanks for a great recipe that we'll definitely be making again!

Very meaty (despite the meatlessness) and aromatic risotto.  Used half the amount of mushrooms suggested and could have used less chicken broth.  Since risotto is usually soggy by the next day, we made risotto cakes by combining the leftovers with eggs, breading, and searing both sides - they were SO good!!!

Wow, this was fabulous!!!  I did it once following the recipe exactly, and I just did it again with some variations.  I only used about 1/4 of the mushrooms, because I had half of a huge zucchini I had to use up.  I cooked the mushrooms for a minute, then added the zucchini, and followed the rest of the recipe almost exactly, I just added a bit more cheese.  Since parm. cheese is salty, you really don't need to add extra salt.

I was looking for a recipe to have with scallops and selected this since I need a vegetable and also something that would add some bulk.  I followed the recipe exactly and this was delicious.  I used only white mushrooms; any kind in any proportion would be wonderful.  Yes, a little garlic might have enhanced this but that didn't deter my husband and me from eating every morsel!

This dish is Fantastic!  I love the flavor but hate the texture of mushrooms so I diced them up pretty small so they wouldn't bother me.  Everyone in my family loves this dish!  This is definitely going to be a "potluck" dish, something to bring that everyone will love! I was wondering how a dish like mushroom risotto had 545 people rate it with 5 stars!  Now I know!

Wow!  This was awesome and well worth the time an effort.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a pound of mushrooms.  As far as cooking time, I just kept cooking until the liquid was gone.  Hard to put a time on it, but I'm it was over 20 minutes.

Excellent rich mushroom flavor. I also took the advice of a few earlier reviews and added garlic which was excellent. I also used a blend of baby portabella mushrooms and a few oyster mushrooms. Make sure you use a medium heat and really stir and add the broth as directed. You will have perfect risotto if you follow the instructions.

Very good!  I used regular rice and halved the amount of butter and mushrooms, and it came out great!  Using the stated amount of mushrooms would've been a little much, so I'm glad I went with 8 oz. each.

Man, this was DELICIOUS!  I cut back by half the mushrooms, as advised.  The only other change I made was cutting the butter in half and adding 2 tablespoons of truffle oil.  It was perfect!

Perfect, perfect!  careful for adding too much salt.  Parmesean cheese has salt so go lightly on additional salt.

This was yummy. I was out of a lot of thing so I improvised. I had no wine or mushroom. So I made a cheese risotto. I added  fresh garlic to replace the flavor of the wine and lots of parm. cheese. It was yummy. I can't wait to try the recipe as written. I also what to try it with spinach puree.

Great recipe! I adapted the proportions to make just two (for a new year's eve dinner).   I didn't have a lot of olive oil on hand, so I sauteed finely chopped mushrooms in a little bit of butter, then instead of switching to a new pan, I used the same pan to sautee onions/garlic, in butter (in place of shallots), and then added the rice to coat. The flavor of the mushroom was infused with the onions/garlic and the arborio rice. Yumm!   One last modification was that I used vegetable stock (I'm vegetarian), but I kept the stock at a boil, which helped to cook the rice quickly.   Lastly, I reincorporated the mushrooms and also added some peas for texture/sweetness as well as salt/pepper to taste.   I didn't need to add additional butter, because I had sauteed with it.   The end product was creamy and extremely flavorful, I'll be making this again!

Taste was pretty good, but I could not get the texture right. It came out more gloppy (a la congealing oatmeal) than creamy :-( This despite following the instructions carefully. No way was this done at the 20 minute mark... rice was still crunchy.

This is delicious.  Just finished eating some of my leftovers for lunch (which come right back to life with a little water and heat).  I used a mix of oyster mushrooms from my co-op and some portabellos, which turned out to be less than the recipe calls for - I would definitely add more in the future.  This was my first attempt at risotto, so I need to work on finding the right balance of heat - my rice wasn't quite done when I ran out of broth to stir in.  I also wasn't crazy about amount of butter, I could taste it too much - I would probably add half in the future.  But, those are fairly easy and personal tweaks - flexible recipes are the best in my book.  I definitely needed a second pair of hands to keep the rest of the meal cooking along, so if you're the lone cook, you're better off cooking this as the entree vs a side.

"The greatest thing ever...can I eat this tomorrow for breakfast?!"---my fiance.  This is AMAZING.  We increased the wine to 1 1/2 cups, omitted the chives, and added one small package each of white and portobello mushrooms.

Followed the recipe to a 'T' with the exception of using less Portobello mushroom, (about 1/4 less). A little labor-intensive with the adding of the broth (in 1/4 C. increments) to the rice but in the end well worth it. It was absolutely fabulous - thick and tasty!.

wow is this good!!  It tastes just how a risotto should.  For me, I can never have too many mushrooms, so I also like to add dried shiitakes into the risotto.  Save the water used to reconstitute them and add it with the chicken broth for an extra hearty mushroom flavor!  Perfect in winter!

I agee that 2lb of mushrooms is too much.  I use 1 1/2 lb and its still extra mushroomy.  For a real treat, add a tablespoon of white truffle infused olive oil before serving.  TO DIE FOR!!

Served to company with rave reviews.  I made it partly ahead so I wasn't in the kitchen the whole time by preparing risotto according to this recipe, but used only 3 1/2 cups liquid (reserved the remaining 2 cups for finishing the risotto), and cooked on medium-low heat for 16 minutes.  After 16 minutes, I removed the rice from the heat. Because I was going to use it within the hour, I just slid it to the back of the stove, no heat, and let it sit.  When I was ready to finish, I sauteed the mushrooms, then added the partly-cooked rice and remaining broth, then finished with parmesan and seasoned to taste.  Perfect!

This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it twice now. It does take some time and patience, but the end result is well worth the wait. I left out the portobello mushrooms and cut down a little bit on the white mushrooms. I used onion instead of shallots. I used about 3 and 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and 3 cups of white wine because I love using wine for cooking. I will make this again and again.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!  This is the second time I've made it, the first using wild mushrooms(1lb in total) and the second time, I added a few mushrooms and green beans!   Definitely will be making this lots more.

This was my first time making risotto too. The only thing I did different was to add an extra clove of garlic and I used a lot more wine, decreasing the amt of chicken broth. I used dried reconstituted mixed gourmet mushrooms, which really gave it an amazing taste. Next time I might even try using the mushroom soaking liquid as part of the stock. Very yummy.

This was my first time making risotto and it turned out fabulous.  The only alteration I made was to use a little less than half the mushrooms the recipe calls for.  It's very easy, albeit time consuming but the result is worth every minute of stirring.

I made this again last night- it's unbelievably good, and it's the perfect side for a dinner party. I use about 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms, which i think is the perfect amount. It goes really well with grilled meat.

I would only be careful with the salt, sometimes the chicken stalk and the butter can be too salty.  I used wild rice because I am in a high fiber diet, and tasted very good. Only had to add more liquid so it riched al dente quality.

I decided upon this recipe for a lobster feed at a friends house. The 21 live lobsters he had shipped from Maine to California were great, but it was this risotto that every guest raved about.   I used my Calphalon everyday pan to make a large enough batch for 10 people and spooned in the stock one laddle at a time. As per Julia Child, I timed the risotto to 18-22 minutes.   I kept the mushrooms to an even lb each and used baby bellas instead of white and used slightly more than the recommended amount of chives. This dish was so flavorful there was no need for either the salt or pepper and my boyfriend beemed with pride as the compliments came all night long.   The key is to stir constantly once the rice hits the oil, so patience it essential and having the last items prepped in advance helps for a quick finish.  Absolute culinary perfection. Will definately make again, once my shoulder isnt sore anymore... :) Enjoy!

This was my first attempt at cooking risotto and I have to say I think it turned out great! Even though your local grocer might not carry shallots it will be worth the effort to track them down. They add a nice firm texture with a mild sweet, yet pungent flavor to the dish that compliments the mushrooms nicely. This dish is worth the effort.

I made this exactly to the recipe but my parmesian wasn't fresh, I used the Kraft grated parm, and it was excellent.  This was my first time making any kind of risotto and I couldn't ask for a better out come.  I will be making this often.  Thank you so much!!

Holy SMOKES this is AWESOME! I love risotto at restaurants, but have always been a little too intimidated to make it myself...until this delicious recipe came along! Sooooo good. Only changes I made were to use 8oz sliced button and 8oz. sliced baby bellas. Fantastic

Delicious!!! Used pinot grigio, 1 package of portabello mushrooms (about 6 medium ones) and 1 package of white mushrooms (about 8 oz). My legs hurt from standing there stirring half a cup of broth until it all disolved, but my guests liked it.

I've never had risotto before and decided to make this for supper with grilled pork chops and green beans. It was pretty good although I must admit I didn't bite into it and think it was fabulous but my husband and I liked it as it was something different to eat. Also, if you're eating it as a side dish I think there's more like 12 servings rather than 6. I agree with some of the other reviews that 2 lbs of mushrooms are way too much. I used 1.5 lbs and it was the perfect amount.

Fabulous and very easy to make!  I love mushrooms so I kept tyhe amount suggested.  I usually toss in some garlic and spinach as well.

Wow!  I almost never make recipes without some kind of an adjustment, but given that this was my first try at any risotta, I did it exactly as scripted (exception:  I couldn't find the shallots in my recently redesigned grocery store, so I used an onion instead).  I don't think there will be any need to search for other recipes - this was DELICIOUS!  However, it took me wayyyyyyyyyy longer than 15-20 minutes for the rice to absorb all of the chicken broth.  More like 30-40.  Definitely, definitely worth it.

This was my first attempt at 'real' risotto.  I've tried the quickie versions from food network and the rice never cooked through. This was excellent!  It was well worth the time of making it.  I omitted the white wine but that was the only change.  I could have easily cut back on mushrooms but I like them and thought the proportions were good.  Will definitely make again..in cooler weather though!

Woah...definitely worth the effort. To make it a little more affordable I made a few minor adjustments: 1. used 1/3 of an onion instead of shallots 2. cut mushrooms in half and just used white ones 3. used regular long grain instead of arborio- couldn't tell the difference, in my opinion. 4. made chicken broth with chicken boullion- 1 cube per 1 cup water. My dad loved this, and he is the biggest food critic in our family. He even said I should make this for company- now THAT is a compliment!

I love risotto and this is one of my favorite risotto recipes.  All risotto is time comsuming but well worth the effort.  You could easily cut back on the mushrooms because the recipe calls for a lot. I have done it both ways with the full amount and half the amount when I didn't have quite enough and both ways were delicious.  Try it...you'll like it. :-)

I loved it, the kids loved it, my husband loved it and all my guests raved about it. Including, my husband's grandmother (who used to be an awesome cook) who stated, "I think this is the best rice dish I have ever tasted!" I cooked it just as recipe stated.

A great staple in my recipe box. It always takes about 2 more cups of broth to get it cooked through. Also added a few handfuls of chopped spinach with the mushrooms at the end so it wilts slightly. Enough for a meal on it's own!

Wow, delicious! I followed the top review and doubled the wine, and added 1 tsp minced garlic. I then used regular mushrooms (had plenty on hand) and added finely chopped spinach at the end. I can't wait to make this again. Next time I may leave out the parmesan and butter because the chicken broth added so much flavor on it's own. Bravo Myleen. This is a wonderful recipe. **Just an update - check your wine before you pour it in. I had a bottle of wine in the fridge that looked like the kind I used. It wasn't - it was a sweet wine. I didn't check until I was pretty much done cooking and decided to taste the rice. Lesson learned, sweet wine doesn't work, and watch for random wine your friends leave behind.

Delicious!  Yes, it required paying attention to it, but it was totally worth it.  I added only a little bit of vegetable broth at a time and added asparagus in addition to the mushrooms and shallots.  Finished it off with Earth Balance spread (non-dairy), scallions instead of chives as that is what I had on hand, a little salt and pepper, and no parmesan cheese for a surprisingly awesome vegan dish.  Yes, vegan!  I always thought risotto had tons of cream or cheese to account for the creaminess, but none to be found and it was so good!

This was a restaurant quality mushroom risotto!  I loved the mushroom flavor throughout the dish and the texture was very creamy.  TIP: Dish did not need added salt because of the parmesan cheese and chicken broth.

I used half brown crimini (baby portabella) mushrooms, and half asparagus, and it was fabulous. Also subbed 2 cloves of garlic and 1/3 cup of chopped onion for the shallot, and green onions for the chives because I already had them on hand. One thing, though: the recipe quantities are for 6 SIDE DISH servings, so if you're cooking this for a main dish plan on doubling the amounts.

Very good, but the first time I made this, i didn't know that the white wine had to be room temperature first...we had hard rice! I think next time I might add a little Italian Sausage and make it a meal that way.

That is the great thing about risotto, you can throw in just about anything to suit your taste. I agree on the mushrooms, I cut back to 1 cup sliced on each, more than enough. Adding garlic and chives is a good idea too! Great recipe. (Treat yourself and do get the Portobellas, they are worth it!)

This is good stuff. My first time making risotto and i was always intimidated that it would take so long and not be worth the effort but it was not as tough as I was led to believe. Fantastic basic risotto recipe. I was very comfortable adding peas, asparagus or other vegetable. It could easily be made vegetarian by using vegetable broth. I think this could be pretty impressive for guests.

This is comfort food at it's finest.I used this recipe for my first go at making risotto.I kept the broth on the burner so it was warm for each addition.You really must get everything ready before starting as you will not be able to leave the pot once the stirring begins.I used a heavy enamel dutch oven so that helped with the sticking issue.Will make this a part of our regular menu.

I used crimini, baby bella, and plain old mushrooms, and it was still the best risotto dish I've ever had!  Next time I'll use a little less butter, but I will definitely make this a permanent fixture in my recipe vault!  Thanks!

So very good.  I have never made Risotto before and this recipe was very easy to follow.  The only thing I found was that it calls for Shallots, which are very expensive.  I found that they were a lot like red onions.  Next time I will substitute red for the shallots.

This recipe is perfect as is. I used the origional amount of mushrooms and added some sun-dried tomatoes at the end, only because I had them on hand and wanted to use them up.

This was incredibly easy to make! I had to adjust for what I had on hand (3/4 of a package of white button mushrooms, yellow onion instead of shallots, and no chives). Granted, I've never even had risotto before- but I loved it. This went very well with the rack of lamb we had for dinner.

Amazing recipe. I've made it about 10 times and it always turns out great. I add more wine and less broth because I like a nice wine flavor. I also add some dried mushrooms if I have them on hand. I am vegan, so I substitute the butter for margarine and offer Parmesan separately to guests who want it. I've made other risotto recipes and been disappointed so I won't bother anymore - I'm sticking with this staple. Thank you!

Fantastic.  I subbed small onion for a shallot, left out the chives(out) and used only portobellos and double the parmasean, and it was awesome.  Very easy recipe, and it was fantastic!

My first time making risotto turned out so great, thanks to this recipe!  I do recommend using more wine and upping the risotto to 2 cups if you want al dente...

This turned out pretty good, I followed exactly,except I forgot to add butter at end,but it tasted great, I also used no fat chicken broth,and I pan fried asperagus with mushrooms, which I reduced the amount of, I used button and portobella. I will make this again, alot of work but worth it.

I LOVE this recipe. I make this dish almost every week because it is SO good. I usually use more white wine than the recipe calls for and use less of the chicken broth. I forgot the cheese one time and found that I like it just as much without it!

DELICIOUS! My husband raved about this risotto, and he doesn't even like mushrooms! I chopped the mushrooms fairly small and added a nice serving of Parmesan. This recipe was simple to make and complemented the roast chicken I made perfectly. Risotto can be made ahead of time so I am going to give this a try next week when I have company for dinner.

enjoyed this risotto, but I think next time will try with just button mushrooms. Think the portobellos where just a bit too much. Think would also be good with white chedder vs the parma.

Super friggin' delicious. My wife and I love, yes love, mushrooms. So, if you're not scared, no need to cut back like some suggest; however, I wouldn't add any more either. It's perfect as-is.

This was good, not quite as good as some others on this site, but I enjoyed. One alteration that I would make is to cut the amount of mushrooms used in half and include some garlic.

Very good risotto!  First time trying it and it was pretty straight forward-just a lot of stirring :-)  If you like mushrooms and rice you have to try this recipe.

This was a great recipe. One tip is to make sure you really do constantly stir the rice when adding in the broth. Otherwise, it easily sticks to the bottom of the pan and you end up with crunchy risotto instead of completely creamy risotto!!

I have made this twice now.  We Love it!!

I didn't have wine or chives the second time so I substituted green onions for the chives and left out the wine.  It was still good.

Thanks for the recipe.

So tasty! Thanks for the great recipe! I had never made risotto before and it was perfect! I added some basil and tarragon while it was cooking, and at the end added some boneless, skinless chicken thighs that I had cut up and browned with some onion and garlic. Yum!

I consider myself a so-so cook but making this made me feel like a gourmet chef!! I found this recipe after having mushroom risotto at a local restaurant. I was surprised at how easy (although time consuming but worth it) it was so make. All of my family (including my 3 year old picky son) loved it! Will make it again!

You wouldn't think it takes that much broth but keep going. It really seems like there should be a cup of cream in there, the flavor is so rich. I used a white burgundy. Yum!

I adjusted this recipe to make enough for three people.  I used chicken broth, and used at least 1/2 cup more than was called for in the recipe.  The texture was great, but the risotto turned out a little salty (I did not add any additional salt).  I will make this again but will use a combination of chicken broth and water.

Very, very good!  I was worried there was too much liquid but once it sat at the end it soaked everything up and was wonderfully creamy.  I used mushroom broth instead of chicken stock because for the vegetarians.

This recipe was good, but I never realized how long you had to cook the risotto and have to watch it the entire time so it does not burn or get dry. I had to add more water eventually than the recipe called for. I used portabella mushrooms instead that I put on the gril. The end result was well wort the wait!

Fantastic!!!! No other way to describe.  My daughter became a great fan of Mushroom Risotta after having for her birthday at a fine local restaurant.  We wouldn't doubt if the restaurant borrowed this restaurant.  Tasted identical.

I think I might have a new favorite – worth every bit of work involved. Followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfectly. It had a very good mushroom flavor to it, to me it was just right. I will be making it again, soon – without any changes.

This was pretty good. The only change I made was that I added some garlic. For some reason mine turned out pretty salty and I didnt add any salt, so I dont know. I still might make this again, though.

This recipe is amazing!!!!  I didn't have any wine so I used all chicken broth.  I used green onion instead of scallions.  I also used light butter at the end and it was simply superb!!  I wish I knew risotto was this easy!  I can't wait to make it for my hubby!  It was SOOOO creamy!

This is a good recipe. I really like mushrooms, but I think there were too many in this risotto. I will definitely make this again, but maybe cut back on the mushrooms a little.

A wonderful risotto!  I followed the recipe pretty much although only used 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms and that was plenty.  Only added 2 T of butter and probably 2/3 c. of parmesan cheese.  Everyone raved about this.   It takes much longer than 15-20 minutes to stir and absorb all the liquid in - it was more like 45 minutes.

I found this recipe the first time I tried to make risotto. I made it as written and it turned out delicious. I have made it several times since using various substitutions (asparagus, peas, even frozen mixed veggies) and it never disappoints!

Quite nice; will probably make this again.  I didn't use wine as neither my husband or I drink and he doesn't generally like the taste of wine in cooking; so used all chicken broth.  We both like mushrooms alot; but it still was quite alot of mushrooms; would use a bit less next time.  I did end up sauteing some chicken to put in; as well; really enhanced the flavour of the chicken broth.  Was quite nice; just a bit time consuming; but then; most good food is...

My family loved, loved , loved this recipe. I used 1/2 the amount of button mushrooms because I was short on them and didn't want to make a run to the store. I don't think the recipe suffered because of it. It was delicious.

OMG, this was orgasmic! Didn't change a thing-except for using half the 'shrooms it called for, as per the other review. It was my first time ever making it, so I wasn't exactly sure how it was supposed to be as a finished dish, but it was really, REALLY good! My husband ate half the pan himself! I'd been curious about it after being a fan of Hell's Kitchen and seeing them make it alot, so I hunted up a recipe and settled on this one. So glad I did. I will definitely keep it and make it again.

Wonderful dish!  I have always wanted to make Risotto at home and was not disappointed with this recipe.  Basic ingredients were used.  It was a bit time consuming (as risotto should be), but  I just hovered in the kitchen preparing the rest of the meal, drinking my glass of wine and stirring the dish.  One note - not very good as a left over the next day, so just eat it all!

This recipe while time consuming was not too difficult but it came out delicious. I only ended up using about 4 1/2 cups of the broth and I didn't heat it up even though it was already at room temperature.  Also only used about 12 ounces of mushrooms and that seemed like just the right amount. Overall the best Risotto recipe I have come across anywhere as of now.

This is rich and creamy! I never wanted the taste to end! I diced up the mushroom because I don't like mushrooms that much. I used 4 cups vegetable broth for the veggie in the house and 2 cups milk. This was the first time I have made risotto and I will definately make again!

Time consuming, but so easy and so worth it!  I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when I tried the finished product.  Nevermind my boyfriend, I impressed MYSELF!  

I'm an avid lover of mushrooms, but I halved the amount indicated and found it to be perfect.  I also added peas for more nutritional value.  I doubled the wine for more kick.  Just be sure to not rinse the rice before cooking, the extra starch on the outside help the risotto get creamy and thick.

Wonderful!!  This was so yummy, even with my substitutions.  I didn't have wine, so I used all chicken stock.  I added squash and zucchini instead of mushrooms.  Next time I'll try the wine as I am sure it adds something.  I am so glad to know I can make risotto at home.

This recipe is awesome! I love risotto, but was intimidated to try to make it until I read all the reviews saying how easy it was to make. I love this recipe. I did make some modifications.

I used about half of the recommended amount of mushrooms. Instead of shallots I used a regular white onion. My box of chicken broth only had 5 cups in it, so that's what I used. I used a Sauvignon Blanc from California as the dry wine. I also did some liberal sprinkling of garlic powder throughout the stirring.

My BF liked this dish a lot, and he doesn't even like risotto! Paired this with a rotisserie chicken.

Nixed the portabello and used 2 lb crimini mushrooms instead.  Used vegetable stock--didn't have chix stock on hand.  Turned out wonderful.  Rave reviews all around from this house.  :)

This was my first attempt at a risotto and wow!  So good and easy!  Granted, I did stand at the stove for a good 25 min. but it was worth it.  I expected it to taste bland but it was full of flavor and texture.  

I did 1/2 the recipe and it was a great portion for 3 adults.  I added 2 cloves of garlic with the shallots.  And I also added about 2x the amount of cheese, because well, we like cheese!  Oh and I only used 1 8oz. package of baby bella mushrooms and it was plenty.  

This is a great recipe I will go to again and again!  Made Easter dinner special!

Mmmmm.... Delicious!  We don't like Parmesan so I used 1/4 cup fat free half and half at the end.  Also, I used 1.5 cups of wine for 2 cups of rice.  So good!

What a wonderful treat!  Served garlic & chive shrimp over the risotto and the dish was a hit.  Substituted 1 cup of broth for 3/4 cup heavy cream for an added touch.

Holy hell, this was good!

I used less broth and more wine (1 1/4 cup wine - 2 cups broth for a 3 person serving) and it came out perfect. I might use a tad less butter than called for next time, but only because I really don't like anything creamy. My wife loved it just as it was. This is my first time making risotto and it was a huge hit, thanks!

This recipe is great.  First time making risotto and this one sounded tasty.  Props to the one who discovered this.  I make for all my family/friends and the guys at the firehouse love it as well.  This is one recipe I'll keep making for a long time.

A good base risotto recipe.  My husband is not a big fan of risotto since he finds it very rich and starchy so he found this only OK.  I on the other hand, like it a lot and this is on par with other good risotto recipes I've made.  It is time consuming but well worth the elbow grease needed to make a good creamy risotto.

it was just ok.  i would be willing to give it another try though, since i was trying to make 3 brand new recipes all at the same time, so it got a bit hairy.  and risotto is really a fussy thing i guess, so i don't know if i wasn't able to pay enough attention to it the entire time.  i thought the rice was a bit too chewy, but overall i liked the flavor & i liked using the different mushrooms(button & portabellas) to give it some meatiness.

Yum!  This was so good!  I omitted the chives, personal preference, and we didn't end up using all of the broth b/c the consistency was right.  Otherwise, it was made as written.  Excellent flavor - everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy to make and very tasty!  I used regular sliced button mushrooms, it turned out great.   The key is to use a nice freshly grated cheese.

This was my first attempt at "real" risotto and was it really fabulous!  I used only 8 oz. of button mushrooms and it was fine.  I also used diced Vidalia onion instead of shallots and dried chives because I had those on hand.  I served the risotto with chicken marsala and my husband raved how good the meal was!  I had to admit - it was!  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe.

i forgot to rate this recipe a ways back when i made it and went to go get it again to make again when i realized my mistake!  this is to die for risotto and taste every bit as gourmet as the name says.  I even have my husband liking this now!  i bought a huge container of aborrio rice to make this often.  I really want to entertain with this as it will impress anyone!

This recipe was excellent!! There were no leftovers.  TIP: You can even buy a packaged risotto mix if you want to add a little extra flavor.  I used a pre-packed risotto with parmesan mix.  So where the recipe calls for the arborio rice, just add the entire contents of the package.  *Do not follow the package instructions.  Using this packaged risotto mix was fantastic.

This is a great recipe.  I double the amount of white wine and add a little sherry.  The sherry really adds an extra layer of flavor that's great.  This tastes better the second day!!

Absolutely delicious!  Although, I only got 5 of the 6 cups of broth absorbed.  I was afraid that the rice wouldn't have been al dente if I kept cooking it.

We make risotto often at home and this is our new favorite recipe!  As others suggested, use only 1/2 of the mushrooms called for in the recipe, that's perfect.  One other suggestion, we pass around a bowl of freshly grated parmesean cheese to top-off the risotto on our plates.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Yum!  This was quite delicious.  I didn't use quite as many mushrooms, but they cook down a lot so don't worry too much about the large amounts.  It does take awhile, but it was worth it to have my husband tell me that it was better than he's ever tried in a restaurant.  We will be making this again!

This was a BIG hit with our family. Clean plates- always nice to see. And wasn't too terribly time intensive. I did use faux butter instead of real butter, but otherwise I followed it precisely. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Used this recipe for dinner last night and it was smash! I used vegetable broth (to appease my vegetarian son) and also added asparagus and sun drid tomatoes to make it more of a main dish. It was wonderful, and for my first risotto ever, went off without a hitch! I'm so relieved...will definitely make it again, and again, and again.

Amazing!  I didn't use all of the broth that the recipe called for.  I would suggest tasting the risotto periodically to see how it is coming along.  It would have been overcooked if I had kept adding all of the broth that was called for.

I lived in Italy for 3 years and I have to say that this recipe was delicious. I would definitely make it again and would not be hesitant to prepare it for my Italian friends.

Excellent!  This was my first attempt at risotto, and it was a total success!  I halved the recipe, which was more than enough for me and my husband.  I left out the chives since I didn't have any in the house.  Also, I used a third of a pound each of white, shitake and portabella mushrooms.  Finally, I grilled shrimp seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika to make it a main course.  Great recipe.

Great recipe! I have made this several times, switching up the type of mushrooms or adding asparagus.  Also made it once with vegetable broth so it was vegan (I never use any butter in it) and it still tasted great.

You can't go wrong with this risotto.  I usally use portobellos and leave out the whites.  I don't use as many as the recipe calls for because of their robust flavor.  My kids who don't "like" mushrooms can't resist this, it's so good!!!!  Hint: for an even creamer texture add alittle cream at the end with the cheese.

Delicious! I didn't think it was that hard to make. Only used button mushrooms (already sliced as a timesaver). Left out the chives and added some Italian parsley at the end. Terrific side dish to go along with the Chicken in Red Wine Sauce from this site.

This is a wonderful recipe..totally worth the extra effort! I have used gourmet mushroom soup (not canned cream of mushroom-but a dark, creamy broth) to sub for some of the chicken broth and it came out great!

I didn't think this was that hard to make at all!  I had a big container of mushrooms, so I cut those up and that was it.  It definitely wasn't as much as the recipe called for, but I thought it was just enough.  This was very creamy, and my husband loved it.  My only complaint is that I thought there was too much butter.   At times all I could taste was the butter,especially the next day when I heated some of it up.  I will definitely make again, but maybe add another vegetable and reduce the butter.

This was really good. It does take a long time to make, but it's worth it. I sauteed chicken in olive oil, garlic, chives, and oregano and added that cut up with the mushrooms. I also added sun-dried tomatoes and shredded mozzarella cheese with the parmesan...very tasty.

I am giving five stars even though I made some alterations, as I'm sure the result would have been just as spectacular the original way.
I used 1 full cup of sherry and 5 cups of beef broth in leiu of the white wine and chick. broth.  I substituted scallions for the shallots and added 3 cloves sliced garlic.  My entire family loved it including my 9 and 4 year old!  Thanks!!

I think this risotto recipe is a great one to use as a jumping off point.  It is very easy to make and from it you can incorporate all the ingreds that you have or like.  Next time I make it I will leave out the mushrooms and add other veggies.  Thanks I loved it!!

This is my go to risotto recipe because its so easy to modify. Since the mushrooms are effectively their own unit you can modify or replace them with anything. My normal version of this is just to fry up some bacon and cook the mushrooms in the bacon grease and combine it all together at the end. Delightful recipe, thank you so much.

This is second time I’ve used this recipe.  The first time I used chicken broth and the recommended white mushrooms and portobello mushrooms  This time I was out of chicken broth and used turkey broth instead. Also used all portobello mushrooms and doubled the amount and doubled the amount of suggested Parmesan.  Much better the second time. This was the side to a fried porterhouse pork chop and side of steamed green beans.  The slow cook process definitely enhances the flavor and should always used.   Also add some garlic and onion powder while cooking the rice that enhanced the flavor.

OMG This was absolutely delicious! I thought 2 pounds of mushroom would be too much (had to cook them in two batches because my pan was not big enough!) but it wasn’t. It was perfect.

2nd time making it, came out just as wonderful as the first. The cooking time is roughly around 35-45 minutes. I made double the portion second time around and the timing was just the same as the first. I modified it a little, using Gorgonzola cheese in addition to the Parmesan and it added the perfect cherry on top. I made double the portion for 6 guests and there were no leftovers!!

Absolutely DEVINE. Love this recipe, it has become a staple in our house. I do half the mushrooms so that I can add chopped zucchini and yellow squash as well. And I sub scallions for diced onions. SO good!!

I tried looking for this again at whole foods because I tried it from their meal kits they had at whole foods and it was delicious but they never brought this particular one back for me to buy again and then I found this recipe on allrecipes and this recipe taste so good even better than the meal kit and my husband loved it . Thank you for sharing this recipe!

First try at risotto and it turned out great! No wine, all stock and scallions at the end instead of chives.

This is a new go to for me. Last minute I added more white wine - because why not - and also a heaping cup of frozen peas. The added crunch of the peas was delish!

This was outstanding!  Only thing I added was peas, based on other reviewers.  Next time, though, I’ll try adding 1-2 small cloves garlic, chopped.  But even without that, I loved it!!

This is an excellent risotto recipe!  Of course, like any cook we tweet it to our own taste. I only use 1 pound of mushrooms, but use cremini mushrooms because I think they have a richer flavor. I use 2/3 cup of fresh Parmigiano Regganio cheese and 2/3 cup of white wine. Make sure to heat the broth in a pot (I use the burner in back of where I’m cooking) Take the advise of not trying to rush the cooking process. It’s well worth the wait!   Be creative and add chopped asparagus or other vegetables of your choice.

I loved making this recipe - the risotto is totally delicious - add some cashew nuts browned in a little olive oil for a bit of crunch and extra texture!

This versatile recipe can be used with lots of entrees. Sometime I leave out the mushrooms altogether and add sun-dried tomatoes or roasted garlic.  YUM!

My favorite variation: add 1 clove chopped garlic, a squirt of soy sauce to the mushrooms (I know, not authentic, but give it a try) and a fistful of pine nuts (the texture is amazing).

I LOVE this recipe! But it is a labor of love with adding the chicken broth, totally worth it! 

This is my 3rd time making it, and I previously didn't give it enough time to soak up the broth and got impatient. Poor decisions were made because the rice was a little firm on the inside. Definitely recommend taking the time to stir and allow time to soak up the broth!

Fantastic recipe.  I am a novice cook and have never made risotto before but was able to make this without much trouble.  My husband and I agreed it was great.  I didn't have wine, Parmesan or chives and only had one type of mushroom but it was still delicious.  Absolutely would recommend this recipe!

Great recipe. Made it for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews. Easy to follow directions, used less broth than called for (before hitting al dente) and everyone loved it.

I made this without the wine and chives (I just didn't have them on hand). I also only had one type of mushroom. My family still raved about it. I cannot even imagine how much better it would have been with all of the other ingredients. Thanks for the recipe Myleen.

easy to make and easy to adjust the size. I only had 3 cups of broth and with a little sloppy math I made a smaller batch.  My family and friends think I'm a master chef....LOL... fooled them all with this easy recipe.

Giving 4 stars bc I made alterations based on what I had here. I finely chopped 1 lb portobello so my picky eaters would give this a chance. And finely chopped 1/2 white onion. I used white rice and cooked it in vegetable broth in a pot versus slowly pouring into a skillet. Used 1/2 cup Pinot noir into the pot of rice. When it was cooked and broth absorbed I added the butter, parm cheese, and mushroom/onions to it. I only sautéed the mushrooms and left onion raw. those are the only differences I made and man it was absolutely delicious!!! Kid approved!

I have made this twice. The first time I used quinoa instead of rice and it was very good. The second time, I made it with farro instead of rice, extra broth instead of wine, and bacon grease instead of olive oil. It was incredible.  I used less mushrooms (only one 8 oz package) both times, and used onions instead of shallots. I served with roasted asparagus and sauteed shrimp. My husband said it was quite possibly the best meal he had ever tasted. I did feel that it takes longer than noted to stir in the broth, if you take your time and stir to absorb properly. But that could have been because of the grains I subbed for rice. It's worth every minute.

I have made this risotto and it is wonderful. My only twist on it is I added a few drops of truffle oil to give it a marvelous mushroom aroma.

Made this with ingredients called for with the exception of white onion instead of shallot and I added a little garlic powder. I also left out the butter at the end and really glad I did. It just the right richness without and less calories, so thats always a plus! I changed the servings to 4 so it reduced the amounts a little. The only prep I changed was that to save time and pans, I sautéed the onions first then added the rice and then added the mushrooms in that order. The total time for all of those to sauté was about 10-12 min. To this I added the wine (I used some left over sauvignon blanc) and after it had absorbed started with the chicken broth (which I just used straight out of the carton- didn't heat first). Total time to absorb all liquid (while fairly constantly stirring) was about 45 minutes. Not that big of a deal because I simultaneously was making chicken in a pan and some steamed broccoli to go with it. At the end I spread the risotto out in the sauté pan and sprinkled with about 1-2 tablespoons grated parmesan. Results were oh so very good. I will definitely be putting this on my fall and winter rotation!! Yum:)

So, so, so many mushrooms...
I love good risotto and this was not it.  So many great reviews, but I found this to be a brown, flavorless mess and I am not sure what could be done to save it.

Fantastic recipe!  For 2 cups of risotto, I doubled the garlic, used a full bottle of pinot grigio, and used 2 cups of freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Magnifico!!

I added some asparagus tips and sliced mild Italian sausage. I also felt two cloves of garlic got closer to the flavor I wanted. Served it as a stand-alone entree.
Delicious.

I made a couple small changes such as using 8 ounces white button mushrooms,  8oz cremini mushrooms. I didn't have shallots so I substituted one small vidalia onion, and I didn't have chives, so I omitted them. That being said, this recipe turned out amazing. It was restaurant quality risotto. Took a good long while, but totally worth it!

This recipe came out great! Plan on more than 50 minutes total time, though. (It seems like it took me that long just to prep all the ingredients!) Also, the video is very helpful so watch that before you begin. The only change I made was to use one pound (not two) of a mix of various mushrooms.

Fair, a lot of work, too many mushrooms & they should be diced.i didn’t see the servings so made waaay too much for 2; guess we’ll be having sides for awhile. Doesn’t say you can freeze?

My wife and I made this dish which was unbelievably great.  Preparation was more difficult than we had planned but as long as you do the proper mise en place you should be fine.  Well worth the extra effort and our entire family loved it.  Now we know how to cook risotto.

Thank you!

Very good original recipe (and rated as such).  Later I substituted a roasted garlic stock base, used some rehydrated morels I had, adding the strained mushroom liquid with the garlic stock, doubled the cheese.

We didn't add as much mushrooms as recipe called for.  I felt the Risotto was ok but not 5 stars worthy.  After we made it we added more cheese and some garlic.  That helped. I will add some different cheese and more seasoning next time to turn it up to a 5 star.

Used 1 8oz pack of baby Bella and 1 8oz pack of white mushrooms. Cut out the white wine completely.  Recommend cooking longer for sure. I hit about 25 min before I started to have that creamy and soft risotto consistency. Added butter to mushrooms when sautéing and 2 cloves garlic. Delicious flavor! Great base recipe.

First time in my life making risotto, great recipe absolutely would make it again. The only thing i did different was leave out the white mushroom's  because i thought it would be to many mushrooms. I only used the portabello mushrooms, and shrimp, which gave it plenty of flavor. On the make again list.

First time making risotto and it was absolutely delicious. I didn’t deviate from the ingredients nor the instructions (1/2 cup is actually one ladle so it worked out well). The cooking time is longer than 20 minutes but is very well worth it in the end.

Half the mushrooms (shiitake and white button), half the butter, one leek in place of one shallot, added one clove of garlic, didn't have white wine so I subbed half sherry wine and apple cider vinegar and used fake chicken broth (not chick'n). I know it's a lot of changes but I just used what I had on hand. Still turned out amazing!

Delicious recipe.   I used regular mushrooms instead of portobellos and everyone loved this recipe.   Use fresh parmesan if you can.  Well worth the little bit of time it takes to make.  Put on the music and have a glass of wine while you cook.

I used the portobellos and a mix of a bunch of other kinds of mushrooms instead of just button mushrooms.  Also added some frozen peas at the end and actually omitted the butter because it was so creamy already!  Yum!!

I've made this a number of times and it's always a favorite. Occasionally I will add chicken and make a chicken and mushroom risotto. Both make an exceptional meal.

I looked at other people’s reviews before I made this so I decided to add a caramelized white onion to this. I cooked it with the mushrooms in butter. I did that and I also substituted the shallots and chives with green onions. I did not use the wine either, just more chicken broth. I halved the mushrooms as well. Since I cooked the onion and mushrooms in butter, I did not add the butter the recipe calls for and I also did not add salt. You don’t really need it because of the broth. It came out soooooo good. Will make again!

Really good!  I left out the chives and substituted grape juice for the wine. It probably would have gotten 5 stars if I had used wine but I was cooking for someone who can’t have wine. I also added sautéed chicken and asparagus when I served it

I found the directions a bit incomplete; however, I made it. I just had to adjust a few of the times to fit my stove. The rissoto turned out very creamy and delicious. I might add a little more wine next time. This dish would make a lovely side for entertaining.

This is the best risotto recipe ever! I have made it several times. I was even able to make it catering style for a gathering at our house buy cooking batches down to the last cup of broth, storing them in the fridge, then when one batch is out grab another, stir in the last cup of broth then add the mushrooms, butter, chives and parmesan. It also tastes just as good vegetarian with veggie broth. Forever a favorite in our household!

I made this as per the recipe without any tweaks in ingredients. I used a ladle to add broth and it took 45-50 mins for the rice to cook. End result was absolutely worth the effort. My husband loved it and so I did I. I served it with modified (quick) version of chicken piccata and the meal was fulfilling.

Absolutely delicious and a huge hit. Only changes I made was added garlic and used a cup of wine, and used half of the mushrooms quantity (1 pound). Agree with everyone that you should take your time with adding the broth to get the correct consistency. Served with salad and garlic bread. Definitely will make it again.

Way too many mushrooms that absolutely do not fit in my large saucepan before cooking. Cooking time is very misleading -- it took me at least 20 minute longer. I strictly followed the steps and hardly wasted any time in between.

Loved it!  Our first risotto and it was awesome.  Did not change a thing other than freeze dried chives instead of fresh.  We did cut the recipe in half.  We will definitely make this again.

This is phenomenal! I didn’t have shallots, so I used a bit of red onion, but only a little so as to not overwhelm the flavor.

Made the mistake of making a double batch in the hopes of taking it back to school for dinners for the week. Don't do that. Took several hours including prep and cooking.
Subbed goat cheese and added sugar snap peas, though, very tasty.

Added pancetta and took out the butter to finish. I think overall the risotto itself was really good. But the mushrooms, the amount of which is borderline too many, are super flavorless. Wonder if maybe you can add the raw mushrooms towards the end of cooking so they absorb the chicken stock rather than just be cooked with a little oil. Would mean you didn’t have to use oil, either. Anyone have thoughts?

I've now made this twice. First, both times took MUCH longer than advertised. You will not be done stirring in 15 minutes. It'll take 45. Also, cooking the mushrooms takes like 10 minutes, not 3.

My first attempt was by the book, and tasted like chicken soup. My second attempt involved : half the mushrooms, twice the wine, and 3.5 cups chicken broth plus 2 cups water. I added 3-5 cloves of garlic to the shallots. Used a full cup of Parmesan. It is. SO. much. better. Chicken soup is fine, but try this if you want great risotto!

 5 star rating reflects second attempt. First attempt was a three.

Rich and delicious. Made it with homemade veggie broth instead of chicken and added some peas at the end. I don’t know why I let all those cooking competition shows scare me away from making my own risotto for so long!

Wonderful risotto. I will make this again and took into account other suggestions. I cut mushrooms in half and added garlic when wine was added. The only change I would make is to decrease or measure out shallots and put only 1/3 cup in the recipe. I will also pair it with some baked moist chicken and a nice vegetable like asparagus. Yummy!

Delicious. As suggested, put in fewer mushrooms (I put in more than half... maybe 70%), added a garlic clove, and a little extra parm. Added more cook time (additional 10-15min). So wonderful. A keeper.

I used half a white onion finely chopped (what I had), no chives, regular chicken broth and we added the cheese on top. Oh! I used smart balance (milk allergy in the family).

Delicious!  Well worth the time and effort.  I followed the directions. I didn’t have shallots readily available so I used a purple onion and a couple of pinch’s of garlic. I couldn’t find fresh chives in my store either  so I used freeze-dried. I thought It turned out perfectly!  I can’t imagine how it could have been better!  I’ll be making it again.

No chives, but the shallots added a wonderful sweetness.  I've usually used onions and garlic with the rice.

Definitely a labor of love. Takes a lot longer than 15-20 mins to absorb and simmer until the rice is soft. Factor in about 20 or so EXTRA minutes. But the end product is tasty and flavorful. Lots of salt and pepper

This was the first time I attempted risotto. Glad I skipped my arm workout today because this requires constant stirring to release the starches and create that creamy luciousness. My risotto cooked in the 20 minutes as suggested in the recipe. I think this was because I cooked it on medium high and had my stock just below a simmer. I added some frozen peas and parsley at the end too. I think I may cut back on the amount of mushrooms next time. All in all, this is a pretty good recipe

I love this recipes. I like to use oyster and portabella mushrooms for a richer flavour. And I use lots of garlic, truffle oil and more wine than suggested. And if you make it with homemade bone broth, an even more rich flavour develops. Soooo tasty!

Great basic recipe! To live in the flavour profile, I had a dried parsley and Bayleaf while the risotto was cooking. When adding the butter, I added the zest of one lemon, fresh cracked pepper, and basil ribbons. On its own, this recipe is great! With all these additions, my husband ate three bowls!

I followed a few suggestions and this came out amazing!!!!!
I used 5 1/2 cups broth, and 1 full cup dry white whine.
I added 1 small clove of garlic to the shallots.
delicious. tender. and savory. I paired this with pork chops stuffed with smoked gouda and bacon- my husband has not stopped eating and loves it.

This was amazing, creamy and delicious. Cook the mushrooms til theiy’re done not the 2 min it says. I didn’t use wine. Other than that followed recipe exactly and it was the most delicious risotto I’ve ever had even from restaurants. This one’s a keeper

This was my first risotto. Followed your recipe. Cooked the mushrooms in butter so didn't add butter in the end. Had left over asaparagus that I tossed in with the mushrooms. Delicious! Leftovers taste even better. I will be making this again  and plan to try shrimp risotto.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have as many mushrooms as the recipe called for...but I thought the ratio was fine with the 10 oz pack of baby bellas.  Hubby is a meat and potatoes guy...but he enjoyed the rice.

Doubled the shallots, used 1/2 white wine vinegar substitution, only 4 cups of broth and didn't stir. Not as creamy as other times, but still good!

Simple ingredients, deliciously brought together. Favorite go-to dish for Sunday, makes a couple lunches and a dinner for two. Keep the stock warm  and keep stirring!

We truly loved it! In the past, I have often made gorgonzola risotto which is delicious but since my son loves mushrooms I decided to give it a try. I didn't make any changes and doubt that I will the next time I prepare this dish - it is perfect just the way it is!

Delicious! The stirring and absorption of the liquid took much longer than 20 minutes, however. No matter, it turned out wonderfully creamy and tasted great. I added some fried shrimps and asparagus and it seemed to go well.

This recipe was great!  I used about 1/2 the mushrooms but if I had used all the recipe called for, it still would have been great.  I know mushrooms breakdown but wasn’t sure how much so went light for the first time. If you are just making this as a meal I would use the full amount. If you are serving this with a protein the 1/2 is perfection.

I am an Italian on a diet so this may seem invasive to some. I made some minor changes which also cut down on cooking time, calories and broth! Instead of Risotto I used brown rice. I know, I know but calorie counting is a thing now. I cooked 1 cup of rice just like the instructions said for risotto. Instead of pouring the broth into the wine cooked rice I instead had already started to boil 2 cups of broth and poured it in there. It took a while longer to cook but it was worth the weight. I also only needed 1 table spoon of butter and less parmesan although you can never have too much cheese. It has great consistency and at the same time filling. The entire family loved it! I will be making it again.

I modified it for my vegan niece and used vegan butter; vegetarian chicken better than bouillon; and vegan parm. It was great and very filling for her.

Yes, it’s time consuming and yes, you do need to keep stirring. However it’s a great dish and pairs well with pork-chops. I’ve made it several times, sometimes I forget I the wine and it still comes out great.

DELICIOUS
Very rich taste but I'm not sure whether that has to do with the fact that I used a chicken STOCK and not broth. Definitely serve with something of a more mild flavor to balance the rich taste of this risotto! 
Definitely use half the mushrooms.

I don't keep wine on hand, so substituted 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of water to keep the same volume of liquid and add some acidity to the dish.  Worked well.  I made it with 1/2 a pound of portabello mushrooms since that was all I had on hand.  Quite good, would be even better with more mushrooms (an in the original recipe).  I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious and very mushroomy. If you like it a little more cheesy, put in 3/4 cup parmesan instead, but I thought it was delightful as is. Don't stop stirring the rice after you add broth in consecutive 1/2 cup batches...stirring is what gives it the creamy texture. Even better the next day!

Followed the directions and came out fantastic.  this is the 1st time I ever made a risotto and will make it again sometime.  I did use my home made chicken stock. I think that added a little extra flavor.   Wouldn't change anything.

I have never attempted risotto before  but found this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  It was time consuming but turned out really great!  The broth portion took longer than stated so I was concerned I had done it wrong but the end result was great.  I may try some of the variations noted by other reviewers next time.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made the recipe with sautéed chanterelles and it was delicious, but did not need as much broth as the recipe called for.  I garnished with chopped fresh parsley.  I  also added additional Parmesan.

I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of butter. And Romano not Parmesan. It’s what I had on hand. 
I made an arugula salad also. It was delicious!
It’s real comfort food.

I’ll definitely make it again , I didn’t use any butter in mine I think the olive oil was enough. And reduced amount of mushrooms I used just 500 gram of brown and white button mushrooms.
It was creamy and delihs !my boys and husband loved the risotto and I will probably make it every other week .

Perfect! I followed this recipe exactly - except I did not add the chives only because I don't care for them - and it is DELICIOUS. And apart from the attentiveness required to constantly add broth and stir, it's really a very simple thing to make. I can't wait to make it again and wow whoever I'm making it for. By the way, you can also add whatever you like...doesn't have to be mushrooms...although the mushrooms were really pretty perfect. Thanks for this perfect risotto recipe!!

Made this for my birthday dinner, as risotto is my absolute favorite! Unfortunately, I left out the mushrooms, because my kids don’t like them. They ate it up (7 & 10.) Made recipe as is and it was delicious!

Followed the recipe directions and used what I had in the pantry.  Subbed 1/3 white onion for shallots and only used 1 lb of cremini mushrooms, which was probably the right amount.  I added 1 large clove garlic and doubled the fresh parmesan to meet family preferences .  Kept the bullion almost simmering and the rice temp at high medium and the liquids absorbed perfectly. This was not difficult and the whole process took about 35 minutes with prep. Actual cooking time was just about 20 minutes. 
The taste and texture were fabulous!!  I have always avoided making risotto because it just seemed like it would be easy to mess up, but it just takes patience.  I will be doing this again soon.  This recipe gets printed and filed under family favorites in the big binder on the shelf.

I first tried mushroom risotto at a local fine restaurant and I never thought I could make something nearly as delicious but this recipe is  honestly just as good!
This was my first crack at risotto and I think it's amazing and fairly easy to make. Make sure you have enough time on your hands. Thinly slicing 1 lb. of mushrooms takes a while. Plus, adding the chicken broth (I used half broth half stock bc that's what I had available.) took more than twice the 20 minutes it said in the recipe. I cooked on a med/low heat but the extra time yielded a creamier result. Worth every minute! And I think the 1lb. of mushrooms was just fine for us. However, I cooked them down longer than the 3 min. That helped shrink the portion down to a tolerable size. I've made this recipe twice now and I'm making it one of my "specialties."

This was my first time making risotto and it turned out perfect! I followed the recipe except used all portobellos instead of mixing with white mushrooms. Served with sautéed shrimp and asparagus.

So worth the effort! This recipe is very forgiving, so do not be intimidated! I found that sautéing the mushrooms longer brought out the flavor. I used homemade chicken broth that was Super-concentrated, so am sure that made it even better. It was Amazing! My mushroom-hating niece is on her third helping!

AMAZING....made it exactly as written.  Used woodbridge chardonnay for the wine, a good quality OO, and "babysat" it the entire time, slow cooking for the creamy texture and consistency.  My husband was blown away and requested I make it again in the near future!

It's a great recipe. It's pretty easy other than the prep that needs to be done and the constant stirring for 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, the rice was perfectly al dente. So stick to the 20 minutes, not 15 -- at least that has been my experience.

Enjoy!

This has such AMAZING mushroom flavor!  At first I thought it seemed like a TON of mushrooms but it wasn’t.  I ended up using about 1 1/2-2 cups LESS of the stock, but I think it must vary. I tasted my rice and it was perfectly al dente so I stopped adding to avoid mushiness.  I added about 1 cup of Parmesan rather than 1/3.....we love the flavor in our house!  Also, it took a lot more than 15-20 mins at med-high heat to finish but 100% worth it. Delicious! Will absolutely make this again ??

thought this was great. I used only portobello mushrooms since I don't really like white button mushrooms. I added 1T worcestershire and 1/2 T soy sauce when cooking the mushrooms to enhance the earthiness. low and slow cook with frequent stirring definitely too longer than listed but I was prepared based on other reviews

This turned out great -- my son is super picky (has a great palate) and asked me to make it again.  That is the highest compliment.  I'll also add that the directions are super clear and even though it wore my arm out, it was completely worth it.  I did use about 2/3 the amount of mushrooms.

I REALLY don’t understand all of the 5 star reviews for this garbage.  Bland and the proportions were all off, as other reviewers have commented. Edible, but not enjoyable.

I added some dried wild mushrooms and topped it off with Frank's red hot. Delicious and straightforward - once the recipe is in the adding wine phase, you can take it easy, putting a half cup of white wine into the risotto and into you. Overall tasty and makes you feel like you've made something that takes more effort :)

I have made this recipe several times. It is worth the time risotto requires. It is great the first day...even better the second day. I serve it as a main dish the first day, and if there is any left I use it as a side dish. Adding fresh chopped Italian parsley brightens the flavor. It is easy to double the recipe.

I made it according to the recipe. It was wonderful! The one thing I would change to the original recipe is cutting the amount of mushrooms in half. I sauteed the mushrooms for over 40 minutes to bring their volume down, and still it was too much! Also, to add a beautiful, bright flavour to cut through the richness, add some chopped parsely and a few splashes of lemon juice! Sounds weird, but try it. Seriously. It brought it from a "wow... very good." to "omg. This is so good!". Again, cut amount of mushrooms in half. Oh, and use shiitake.

My friend made a batch this weekend and I'm still thinking about it.  We used a mix of baby bellas and shiitake mushrooms and balsamic vinegar parmesan (find it in the fancy cheese section in a wedge - don't use the shredded bagged stuff! You won't be sorry!).

First time making Risotto.  Recipe was excellent.  Based on taste during the process, I added fresh Garlic to the mushrooms and about .5 tsp of salt to capture the mushroom taste.  Finished product was exceptional.

Next try on this recipe, I will try to bring out the mushroom flavor a bit more by adding some shiitake mushrooms.

I usually don’t take the time to write a review but I had to make an exception for this delicious recipe! I used 1 pound of baby Bella mushrooms which I chopped very finely. Otherwise I followed the recipe and although it did take significantly longer than 20 minutes it was so worth it.

I followed the recipe, except I shredded the mushrooms very fine as I can't handle the texture of mushrooms and cut the amount a bit. I skipped the salt and pepper just because I forgot about it, but it turned out absolutely delicious...definitely worth the trouble of making.

First timer, but turned out very great tasting. After reading notes, I only added pepper and cayenne (no salt). Baked some pork chops to go with, but lots of choices would be good. Also used fresh mushroom medley from farmers market.

This is easy and delicious!  The only change I made to the recipe was I used beef stock because I didn't have enough chicken on hand. For those of you that think the recipe is a bit bland, try the beef stock, it is stronger in flavor.

Yum!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I didn't use as many mushrooms as the recipe specified, but I would have enjoyed more.  I just didn't have that many on hand.  I also used a vegetarian no-chicken broth instead of chicken broth, just to make it vegetarian friendly.  

It was so good!  It's a bit of work to make.  Probably took me an hour or so.  Next time I find myself with a little time, I'll definitely come back to this.

Without salt and pepper, mine turned out pretty bland tasting.  I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms.  But after salt and pepper treatment it somehow came alive with flavor.  Amazing how that works.  I also tried pan frying patties of the stuff with leftovers (as someone suggested) and that crispness added an extra texture that made it even better than day one.

This has become a fam favorite but only for special events.  It is delicious and rich but time consuming.  I have only used portabella mushrooms but may try oyster mushrooms next time.. and a little extra butter too.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it.

Made half the recipe and used Parmigiano Reggiano. I feel the only way to make this dish bland is to rush it. It is better to take your time and not pay too much attention to the 15-20 marker. That is only there to give you an idea. Didn’t even need salt or pepper.

My husband has visited Italy numerous times and says this rates right up there!  I add chopped, roasted chicken breast and fresh spinach.

Took much longer to make than the recipe. Perhaps 45 minutes+ of cooking time. The key is to stir it constantly, and add only 1/2 cup of liquid at a time. Turned out wonderfully!  I left out the chives b cause I didn’t have them, left out the butter because it was already rich, and added the cheese in the table. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

I followed the recipe. Used about 2 cups of homemade chicken broth and the rest low sodium broth.  It was worth every minute it took to make this.  Delicious!!!

I made some adaptions to this after making it a few times.
1. Instead of chicken broth I do 1x4c box of Pacific brand Mushroom broth. We usually make this with a beef dish so the other 2 cups comes from beef broth or if we do chicken we'd use chicken broth (homemade bone broth = even better!). These broths do make the risotto more tan colored but the flavor is really lovely.
2. There are WAY too many mushrooms. I end up using just over a half pound total. We like baby bellas in it.
3. We don't like to use anything with alcohol in recipes. I know this makes it not very Italian but we don't like using it. If others are like us in that, our best combo we found was to do 1/4 c white wine vinegar and 1/4 c white grape juice. This helps with the acidity as well as gives just a little bit of sweetness without it being too much.
4. We're big cheese fans. 1/3 c is not enough :). We usually add a bit over 1/2 c but I don't really measure to know for sure. We grate up a whole wedge of parmesan and I add in enough that it looks right (but not so much it's a stretchy mess).
With these changes, we now LOVE this recipe. Some may really enjoy it as is. I love mushrooms but this was way too many for me even.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed. It’s important to keep the broth very warm in a pot beside you. I found the timing was exactly as the recipe indicates if you FOLLOW the recipe. It was delicious and my very picky husband loved it. Will make again for sure

I didn't have white wine on hand so I substituted a splash of balsamic vinegar and fresh lemon juice. Wow! Tasted fresh and light and delicious. I've made it 3 different times now and am adding new vegetables every time (asparagus, zucchini, green beans). Always good.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I didn't have any wine, shallots or chives on hand, but it still turned out spectacular. Totally worth all the stirring! This will be a regular in my household.

First time I’ve ever made risotto.  I followed this recipe as described. I did heat the broth on medium and left it on medium while I was making the risotto. I added broth as described. It took me around 30 minutes.   This dish turned out so creamy. I love mushrooms and felt thee amount in this dish was perfect.

I have made this exactly like the recipe says and it is wonderful. My daughter isn't a big fan of mushrooms so today I made it with half of the mushrooms and 1.25 lbs of medium sized shrimp. It is delicious both ways.

I added shitake mushrooms because I didn't have any other besides cremini. Also, I didn't have any white wine, but it was still delicious, creamy elegant and earthy. I love risotto because they're so easy to make. I have also added asparagus to this base and also a bit of shredded roast chicken. Delicious all the way around.

Also very happy there's no cream involved, just a little butter and cheese. We "halved" the recipe ingredients  which was perfect for 2.

Great recipe!  Used this recipe the first time I ever tried making risotto. It came out great!!! I’ve made it many more times since & enjoy the routine, attention & final result every time. Plus, I get to sip on white wine while creating this dish!  Can be a relaxing, enjoyable experience if you accept it takes time. I always use more wine; approx 2+ cups for a good solid base flavor. I have learned to make sure to keep stock ivery hot, a low boil before ladling into rice.  Plus, I add more stock as needed, depending on texture & thickness I want. Also, I use a mix of gourmet, baby portobello & regular mushrooms. Thank you for the recipe!!!!

This was delicious! This was also my first time making risotto. I substituted 2/3 chicken stock and 1/3 water for the vegetable/chicken broth. Used 1/2 lb white mushrooms. Didn't have any shallots; I added in 1T of some maple bacon onion jam I had on hand. Will definitely make again!!

So. Good!!! I used a mixture of olive oil and butter for cooking both mushrooms and onions. (I substituted 1/2 c chopped onions plus 1 clove garlic for the shallots.) I never thought making risotto would ever be worth the time it takes. This recipe proved me wrong!!!

This a truly wonderful recipe.  Comes out perfect.  I used my induction burner for even heat across the entire skillet.  Do not rush the cooking time on the rice.  Slowly add the broth to ensure a nice creamy risotto with perfect texture of the rice.  I cut the mushrooms down to 2/3 of a pound of each type.  I also cooked the rice on medium heat (275 degrees). Rice cooking time was about 25 minutes.

First Time I made risotto using this type of recipe. Very satisfied with it, easy, even if it was a little time-consuming but well worth it. Hubby loves it!! I added some chanterelle fond I got in Europe to the broth and it added a nice umami richness to the risotto. Can’t wait to try this with different mushrooms.

It does take the time, but it's well worth it!  Best I've ever had!  Also, I didn't have quite the amount of mushrooms called for in the recipe, but it turned out just fine anyway.

It was very good! However i ended up only using a half pound portobello and 1/2 pound white mushrooms. Also just as a note this recipe will easily serve 4 people as a dinner alone which is how we ate it.

I made it exactly as written except that I increased the cooking time to 25 minutes and I only had a dry red wine on hand. This is a dish of delish!! I think I will add fresh peas and asparagus next time. Yum! Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is an excellent risotto recipe. I made it last night for dinner to complement my baked chicken. The family absolutely loved it. I did however, make some minor modifications to the recipe. I think that 2 cups of mushrooms is far too much and will essentially overwhelm the dish. I cut the mushrooms back to a single cup. I sauté the mushrooms for about 7 to 8 minutes. I didn’t have any shallots on hand so I substituted a regular yellow onion which worked wonderfully. Also, the ratio of arborio rice to stock is too high. The preferred ratio is approximately 3 to 1. That being 3 cups of stock to each cup of arborio rice.. I would highly recommend making this resort a recipe to anyone who enjoys a good risotto...the flavor is absolutely amazing, thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Started from scratch at 730pm and finished at  930pm , 30 more minutes would have made it perfect :) No way is the time 53 minutes. Using the recipe was awesome, but I used my head and stirring religiously every 4 minutes. Added fresh grated garlic. Next  time I will stir in a can of mushroom soup  to make it absolutely EPIC !!  BTW..6 cups of broth is WAY TOO MUCH..I might of used 3 cups..Great recipe regardless :)

oh my goodness. First time ever making risotto, and this recipe was amazing! watching the video for technique, and getting ingredients and amounts from the recipe really gave me a great model to cook from... wish I had taken a picture. 
I used 3 different types of mushrooms; White, Portabello, Dried Shitake,  the freshly grated parmesan, shallots, chives, wine, chicken broth etc... it was so hearty and creamy but took much longer to cook than was noted in recipe!
 I never measure anything, but i measured the rice, and all of the liquids; 48oz of chicken broth and the wine, everything else I eyeballed... cooking time is definitely longer... but thats the only 'negative' thing I have to say about this!! so hearty as a main dish, throw a nice toss salad on the side and you have a complete meal!!

Followed the recipe with these changes: halved the mushrooms, did not have a shallot so I used a small onion and added a clove of garlic. It turned out perfect!  I was very nervous because this was my first time making risotto but really easy if you have all your ingredients prepared and measured before you start cooking.  Will definitely have to make again soon

This recipe is wonderful. I added sweet sausage and a tad more stock to balance that off. Reason for this being, that’s how my grandmother made it and this brought back so many memories. THANK YOU!

Five stars no doubt, I doubled the wine and added garlic otherwise followed the recipe, the only thing I would add is to be very careful adding salt, I added a little before I tasted it and it turned out a little to salty, I think with the broth and cheese it has enough salt

I would have used baby portobello's rather than regular. I also would have cut mushrooms smaller. I love mushrooms but I would also use less next time. The flavor was fantastic.

First time making risotto, this process was very simple. My two suggestions are to cut WAY down on the amount of mushrooms (I have a ton of leftover cooked mushrooms) and to not get bogged down by the suggested amount of time it should take to add your chicken stock. It took me quite a bit longer on my tiny gas stove, but patience won out! Paired with some lovely garlic steamed clams.

Perfect comfort food! 
I made it for a little dinner party I had and everyone LOVED it. I added shredded chicken (thinly sliced, salt and peppered, then cooked through using olive oil) in my cast iron pot. It is definitely a keeper.

Truly worth the wait (and focus). It's not hard at all, it just requires mindfulness which is it's own reward. I didn't have Arborio rice (nor could I find it in stores) so I used Thai jasmine rice as it was suggested as a suitable substitute, otherwise I followed the recipe. I had a fantastic mineral broth to start with (chicken bones, veggies, greens, herbs) and very fresh mushrooms as I'm very close to Kennett Square, PA so your mileage may vary but this might be the best thing I have ever cooked. It's also a great vegetarian dish to have in the repertoire. Yum.

Excellent authentic dish.  I only added regular mushrooms and that was plenty.  It does take time but it is worth it.  I like it as a simple dinner entre.

Not as hard as it seems.  I use a container of white mushrooms and a container of baby bella mushrooms.   Fresh grated parmesean makes a big difference.

I had NEVER made Risotto- ever. My boyfriend is French and has ate some of the best around the world. I followed the recipe exactly as written and used a well seasoned cast iron deep skillet. According to my guy it was perfect and he doesn't compliment unless he means it.  He now calls me the Risotto Queen. Thank you for such a foolproof and fantastic recipe. I will never try any other meth

Turned out great!  Doubled the recipe for a potluck and cooked in a Dutch oven.   Ended up only adding half of mushrooms  and was happy with proportion.  Took 25-30 minutes to reach al dente.  Also used slightly less than all of the broth and just stopped adding liquid when I got to al dente.  Would definitely make again.

My first time making risotto and it was so good! Made minimal changes based on what I had: used only 1 lb mushrooms, yellow onion rather than shallots, and omitted the chives. It was so creamy, filling, and delicious! I may add the other pound of mushrooms and serve it as a vegetarian main dish. Thanks for a great recipe!

This has turned out amazingly each time I made it. Tonight I deviated from the recipe and used no sodium chicken broth. I didn't add any salt to correct for this. Don't do that. I've used low sodium in the past, with excellent results. I did add a few cloves of garlic to the shallots, I am pleased with how that turned out.

Great recipe! Some changes: I used 24oz of crimini. Low sodium chicken broth. Red wine instead of white because that's what we had open. Added garlic and rosemary.

I've made this recipe many times and really like it but I needed more flavor.  I added garlic, a little chopped fresh rosemary and fresh thyme and it came out much better

FanFREAKINGtastic. I served mine as a meatless main dish instead of a side, and we both inhaled it. This is the best risotto recipe I've ever made.

Our family loves this recipe! I used mushroom broth instead of chicken broth and reduced the mushrooms to 1.5 lbs. I agree with another reviewer that it takes much longer to get an awesome risotto. It takes me almost two hours to make this dish.

Keep the broth simmering and you can cook this in 20 min.  You will need to babysit this and cook at medium for 20 or check every 4 min and cook on lowest setting   Walk away and it's burnt

Loved, loved it.  First time I ever had mushroom risotto was on a riverboat cruise and really liked it so was thrilled to find this recipe.  
I made it last night for company and was a little nervous that it would turn out well.  I made it exactly as per recipe but only had 1/2 lb of the portobello mushrooms but I think along with the 1 lb of white ones it was enough.  Next time I won't use shallots but a small red onion as really that's all a shallot is I think.
Everyone loved the dish though I think it was meant for a main dish not a side dish as I have lots leftover but that's good news as we'll have  it tonight again.  
Will definitely make again.

This recipe is outstanding.  Risotto is not hard to make, just a little time consuming, but the rewards are worth the effort.  Make sure your broth is very hot or you wont get the results your looking for.  Ladle the broth in one ladle at a time till its absorbed and repeat until risotto is tender.  Cant miss!!

I use locally grown rice here in Uruguay ( Don Ruggero Carnaroli - it states ideal risotto on the label) and find it needs about a cup less of stock. Other than that, I love it.

Delicious! I (and the grocery store) didn't have shallots, so added a bit of Vidalia onion and a couple cloves of garlic, but I add garlic to everything but ice cream. I only used 1 1/2 lbs of mushrooms and will most likely use just one next time. It was wonderful and I will make it every time my picky son who hates mushrooms is out of town.

I made this in my Instant Pot. It turns-out just as creamy and delicious as the stovetop method and you simply turn it on and do whatever else you do in your spare time.
Use the sauté button first, sauté vegetables as directed. Add the rice and wine, allow to evaporate. Add everything else and place the IP lid. Turn-off sauté and push the manual button and set time for six minutes on high pressure.
Make sure the pressure valve is set to sealed position. Allow a ten minute natural release then open the pressure valve.
I'm not a spokesperson for the Instant Pot, it has simply changed the way I cook, for the most part. It's the most used gadget in my kitchen, and I have a lot of gadgets! For those who don't know, this is one pot that is a countertop pressure cooker, rice maker, sauté pan, slow cooker and, I have used it many times to deep fry.

Very yummy.  I made this for a co-worker who was recuperating after surgery and couldn't eat chewy food and she loved it, then I made it for my husband and myself and wow -- GREAT mushroom risotto.  Not too hard, just have to pay attention.

Accidentally added 1/3 c of wine during each broth addition the first time I made this recipe, and it was still amazing!! Making this again tonight with my brilliant mistake. Changed it to 4 servings and had risotto for days. So good!

Great flavor. This was my first attempt at risotto. I thought it came out slightly mushy. The recipe wasn't clear on how high the heat was to be. Perhaps I had it too low. Otherwise great dish. I'll try it again

Have made this recipe a few times now & love it every time.  I follow it as it is written and love the leftovers.  I sometimes have used shredded parmesan instead of grated and like it either way.  My family's favorite side dish!

This was very good! I used onions bc I didn't have any shallots on hand. Also I didn't use any wine; I don't like the flavor of alcohol. Next time I will use low sodium broth because it was a little too salty. Oh, and I forgot to add the butter but it was still nice and creamy!

The only change I made was to omit the cheese.  It came out very creamy and rich.  I'll stick with this recipe!

So good! And I didn't even have white wine on hand. I think it would have been 6 stars if I had added the white wine.

Wow, this was good! And such an easy recipe. I'd never made risotto before because I thought it would be too difficult, but it's really not. I used parsley instead of chives and that worked really well.

Wonderful recipe. Does take a bit longer to add the liquid slowly. I find it the perfect base recipe for my truffle risotto. I use truffle oil, instead of regular olive oil and truffle salt for seasoning and finishing. When in season, I add black truffles to the top.  Oh, I only use baby bellas too.

Made for mother's day. Excellent dish, will definitely make it again. It turned out much saltier than expected due to the broth so you might want to start out with a low sodium broth or, if you're using powder/cubes, change the broth to water ratio. We ended up adding 2/3 cup water to extend the cooking time. We also used less mushrooms, about 125g portobello mushrooms and 250g white mushrooms, and it came out quite nicely. The white wine was substituted with some white grape juice and we ended up using dried chives for convenience.

I followed the directions exactly and had pretty good luck. The finished product was creamy and delicious, with just the right amount of 'crunch' still left in the rice. 
The only thing I changed was to add a bit more broth and wine, since at first I had the heat too high and it was evaporating too quickly. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to add the liquid a VERY small amount (about an 1/8 cup) at a time, stirring constantly. I think PATIENCE is the key ingredient in this recipe!!!  ;-)

I made this as is except I turned over the stirring to someone else. In that trade off we forgot to add salt and pepper. It was still creamy and delicious, just a bit bland. I'll try again with S&P. It's very guilt free because there's no cream.

Extremely successful, tasty and easy to make (only labor intensive). I tried it once with butter and cheese and once with olive oil and no cheese (vegan version),  they taste equally fantastic.  I agreed with the comment saying half the mushroom portion.  Love how this easy recipe make every guest satisfied and happy!

Awesome. The only addition I made was to add a large minced clove of garlic after the shallots were almost done. I also made sure that my broth was super hot before adding. It did take longer than written to achieve the proper consistency.

My first attempt at risotto and it was a success!  Used about 20 ounces of mushrooms (white and baby bella) with 1.5 cups of rice and used onion in place of shallots .... followed recipe.  Very easy to make, even if it is a little time consuming.  Probably cooked up in 20-25 minutes with constant stirring.  Delicious and am excited to try other risotto recipes, now that I've made this one!

made to recipe;  was really good. remember this is just like pasta, you have to pull it it just a little underdone to account for plating and serving (mushy pasta or risotto is not good eats). very good and satisfying as a main course (had three non-veges for dinner and although they scraped every piece of rice from the pan, they were happy).  2 pounds mushrooms took about 20 minutes to sauté, 3 minutes (recipe time) is insane unless you have a pan that will fit 2lbs of mushrooms an a single layer (46" maybe). 2 lbs of mushrooms is the right amount for a
 entree. 
seasoning was on. FUTURE: will use 2 cups of rice next time for 4 adults as entree.  will roast mushrooms next time instead of braising/sautéing.

If you know risotto technique, the recipe is good. Take your time with broth addition - risotto takes a long time and a lot of attention.  Results would suffer if only 15-20 mins of broth absorption time were allowed. Too many mushrooms for most people. I used a combo of shittake, portabello and crimini.

I liked this recipe and made it because I am hooked on a similar dish at a local Italian restaurant. I found black truffle oil at my local Home Goods store, so I added 2 tablespoons. I did not have white wine nor did I use the scallions. This dish is best eaten when originally hot so that it is still nice and creamy smooth. It is a lot of stirring and breath holding as you try to get the risotto al dente without it being crunchy or burning it. The flavor is great and the addition of the truffle oil gave it an even earthier flavor. I am a mushroom lover, but I only had a 6 0z of mushrooms and that was plenty. I used a mixture of 3-4 different fresh mushrooms that were packaged together. And yes, as mentioned in another review, it took longer than 20 minutes, I would say double that time. I added the liquid, cooked it down as directed, and then tasted to check doneness.

The first time I've ever made risotto--and it was absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing, other than I didn't have chicken broth, so I made some with chicken bouillon instead. This is such a great, and easy, recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Wish I had read other reviews prior to making since I cooked just about 2 lbs of mushrooms but did not add them all even though I absolutely love mushrooms. Definitely would have been overkill. Nor did I add all of the mushroom juices, I added a little at a time until I was happy with the taste.   I also did not add chives since I did not have any.  Will absolutely make again!

OMG! This recipe is amazing! I never knew making risotto was so easy. Totally recommend it. I followed the recipe step by step but decided not to add the butter or chives at the end. Instead I just added a bit of salt to taste.

The risotto turned out delicious. I actually used Basmanti rice since I didn't have the other but I used about two extra cups of broth. I added corn along with the mushroomsame for extra texture. I was hard work but we'll worth the time.

Delish! I know there are people who don't like it when we post things we might have done a bit differently than what's in a recipe but people who cook a lot understand it. I'm not a big salt person so next time I make this  I'll skip the salt. Let them season to taste when it's on your plate. I used 1 cup of cooking wine and took a cup of broth off as I did add a half cup heavy cream at the end with the grated cheese. Used Arborio rice and portabellas sliced and 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion. I might add garlic next time since I love it so much. All in all great recipe!

Wow! If I owned a restaurant this would be worth some $$$ it's soooo good. Takes some patience, but worth every minute. It's just as good without portobello's if you don't have them on hand. Thank you for this recipe! My family loves it. Even the picky ones

Found this to be a great and easy recipe.  To get the rice al dente I only use between 4 to 5 cups of broth at low high heat.  If i keep going the rice starts to get a little soft so I constantly taste test but other than that its a great recipe.  Also if you dont want tons of mushrooms us 8 oz of each.  My wife wanted more so I use 1 and a half total pounds instead of the 2 .

Delicious!    We followed the recipe as written and it was perfect.   It did take closer to 30 minutes to add the broth on a low heat, but the texture of the rice was creamy and flavorful.   It makes quite a bit.   We will make half the recipe if it's just the two of us next time.

This risotto is amazing.  I make it for my family 2 or 3 times a month with grilled chicken or shrimp.  I sometimes saute green beans or asparagus and add that.  It's my daughters favorite meal!

I've made this many times with 250 g closed cap mushroom and 250 g chestnut mushrooms as well as with only 250 g mushrooms. I didn't add any cheese or butter to make it vegan. I lowered the amount of oil to one teaspoon and cut out the salt as the veggie stock was enough. I used 4 oxo stock cubes with 1 litre of boiled water. My husband, daughter, and I loved this.  It was really tasty. To me, it didn't need any cheese. Though if I make this for guest, I may offer some Gary (vegan cheese) to grate on it.

We didn't add chives as we are not a fan. It was srtill amazing!

This is a great base recipe! I tripled the recipe for Christmas dinner. I also added a few things. I started with sautéing leeks in butter then added pancetta. After the leeks were soft I added the mushrooms and sautéed until just soft. I finished the risotto by adding fresh spinach. This was a huge hit for Christmas and was a great side to the rib roast. Will definitely make again.

! This was my first time cooking risotto. The combination of flavors from the shallots, white wine, chicken stock, mushrooms and parmesan made for an excellent dish.

Couldn't believe  how good it was.  I added peas to mine. Definitely put in the oven.  On the stove it was a little watery.  After oven it was perfect!  My husband finished the whole thing  that night!!

Ah man! I'm bummed about this one. I liked the flavor but the whole time I was making it, I kept looking at the recipe thinking, "seriously? That's a ton of mushrooms". I even questioned whether I truly knew how many ounces there were in a pound. Based on the photos, I'm not losing my mind. It truly called for that many! Also, it took WAY longer than 20 minutes. Probably closer to 45. I'm annoyed that I spent so much money on ingredients and no one liked it except me (kind of).

I made this for lunch.  I substituted wine for cooking sake and chicken stock for Imagine vegan no chicken stock in photo.  So yummy, four approvals and second helping.  the nochicken stock was 4 cups so I added 2 cups of water to stock.

This recipe is excellent but I found that the cooking time was a bit off because I had to cook the rice for an additional 20 more minutes to get it to a nice, creamy texture.  I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed the recipe to a tee but the second time I added about 50% more wine and two extra tablespoons of butter.  The additional wine and butter did enhance the flavor so I will definitely keep these changes the next time I make this yummy dish!

I've followed this recipe step by step a million times. It's perfect every single time. Great thing is that you can substitute the mushrooms for whatever you think you (or your guest/s) will prefer. This is one of my favorite things to make. SO EASY

I made this for the first time last night. I didn't have any portobello or white mushrooms on hand, but had a container of crimini mushrooms, so used those instead. They had a great meaty flavour. I used a red onion instead of shallots and green onions instead of chives. I used better than bouillon chicken broth. The substitutions didn't appear to affect the final outcome.  The risotto came out nice and creamy and really flavourable. Everyone, including my 7-year old daughter, loved it.

Just like a previous reviewer... In order to get that beautiful, creamy consistency a good risotto is so noted for... 15-20 minutes of cooking time was not nearly long enough! The simmering broth MUST be added little by little, cooked & stirred till it's absorbed, then repeating this step, ladle by ladle of broth, until the risotto is tender but not mushy, the broth is absorbed, and the starches break down resulting in creamy risotto - however long that takes. In my case, it probably took twice as long as the recipe directed, around 40 minutes, but  I cooked this at MEDIUM heat in order to release the starches slowly. The end result was a creamy risotto with great flavor! Note from the author of recipe: Add in;s at the last 5 minutes i.e. chicken & mushroom, saffron & seafood... whatever you desire for the last mix in (cooked meat of course)!  Those saying that it takes longer than 20 minutes to cook, that is because your cooking heat is too low and/or your broth is not hot enough (should not be boiling, but should be hot & kept over low-medium heat). When you add the broth, it should be boiling when it hits the risotto. It should take about 2 minutes for your broth to be fully absorbed after constant stirring.

I'm a serious carb lover, so I've always loved risotto. I've never tried making it myself, but when I found this recipe, I decided to try it. I followed the recipe with only a few minor changes. I used portobello and Cremini mushrooms because they're my favourite varieties. I probably used around 2/3 of a lb of each. I didn't have any wine, so I used white grape juice. I skipped the shallots, and I added some extra Parmesan cheese, because you can never have too much cheese. It took exactly 20 minutes of constant stirring to cook. I think the secret there is to have the broth already hot as you slowly add it to the rice. Oh.my.god. Unbelievably delicious. Probably my favourite thing I've ever made in my life. I will be making this a lot.

This is exactly as my mom makes her mushroom risotto and it's THE BEST. The only tip I have for future cooks is that (for me at least) it always takes much longer than 15-20 minutes to cook the rice. It's usually more like 30-40 for me. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I just taste it as I go until the rice tender. But honestly, best recipe for risotto out there.

I Caramelized onions with the mushrooms, and added garlic before the rice, as others have suggested but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! It was my first time making risotto and was really nervous but after trying this recipe I will absolutely make it again!

Oh, yes, five stars indeed.  The only substitution was using brown rice and I must admit,  the flavors are incredible.  The lovely aroma lingered in the house for hours.  A fantastic  recipe for company as well.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  I didnt have the chives so i used green onion tops.  Great left over.  Thr recipe makes alot for two.  Consider cutting in half unless you want it for left overs for a few days.  Very yummy

This was delish! Only thing I'd do differently next time is make sure I give the rice a little longer in just the oil so it goes a little more golden before I start adding the chicken broth. And keep the heat high enough so the moisture gets absorbed in the rice quicker as it took longer than 20 minutes with heat closer to medium. Will definitely make many more times. Family loved it!

This is my go-to recipe for risotto. Quite popular with the family! I use about half of the mushrooms (1 lb. total) & it turns out perfect.

This was very good, very creamy.  I didn't have any chives on hand so I used dried parsley which I soaked a bit in the mushrooms as they were cooking.    Also I used all portabella mushrooms as I had 2 packages of that which I bought by mistake.

Luscious! Lot of stirring, though. I made good use of my kitchen stool. I wish I had stirred a tad longer than the 17 minutes I did. It is just a bit more al denote than I prefer. But flavorful and creamy. Mmmmm!

This was the first time I have ever made risotto and it was fantastic. I could have eaten the WHOLE pot myself. I followed the recipe exactly, except for chives (forgot them at the store.) It also took longer to cook then stated in the recipe. Maybe an hour or so, but we'll worth it.

This was very good...however I did make a couple of changes.  First off, it took me way longer to get the rice soft enough to eat.  So I ended up adding an extra half cup of broth and covering it for about 5 minutes.  This way the rice actually finished cooking through and lost that "bite".  I also added a teaspoon of mushroom powder to pump up the mushroom flavor.

I made this recipe and added a few extras to the recipe...  Alone it's Great but add more stuff and it's Amazing.  I added garlic to the shallots;  and in the mushroom sauté stage I had added pre fried bacon bits drained and home made; zucchini; carrots; broccoli and Italian parsley!  After ore chopping all of the veggies I started to laugh because I did not know how I was going to fit all of the mix into my pan; so I took half of the raw veggies out and put it in a gallon zip(1/2 a ziplock full) Let me say that you should have at least half gallon of whatever you are going to add in...  I chose to shred Costco rotisserie chicken to have as a side option!  All in all I had a lot of food and thank God I made it because as I was finishing all my cooking I got invited to the neighbors house for pot luck!  Perfect Dish they could not believe that it was my first time making risotto.  Just make sure you have time because from beginning to end it took me an 1 1/2 to prepare and cook. (TIP: Don't Leave The Stove!!!!!!)

I made a half recipe of this and it was the perfect side dish for four people. Even my mushroom hating daughter had to admit it was fantastic. Definitely one of the best risottos I have ever made.

The recipe was good, I love mushrooms so i didn't complain about the copious amount that went into it. I did cook the rice for a bit longer and added the stock bit by bit, I don't think it is possible to cook it properly in 20 minutes. Instead of shallots I used onions which I saute'd a bit. At the end, to add a bit more flavor I just sprinkled some lime juice over the dish.

This was the first time I made risotto and boy let me tell you I loved it!!!!!! The recipe was easy to follow and the only thing I changed was I only added half of the mushrooms. I used one package of fresh white mushrooms and one package of baby Bella's!!!! So much flavor!!! It makes a ton of risotto you will have plenty of leftovers. I froze mine and used them several weeks later and it still tasted perfect

This really does come out perfect every time.  I do have to confess, I always skip the portobellos and just whites.  I'm sure the portobellos add another complexity and I will try someday, but just using the whites it still comes out fantastic every time.  Yum! Making it again tonight.

I was so amazed at how delicious it was. I felt like I was dining in an Italian restaurant, but better! I didn't expect it to turn out as well as it did, and I love mushrooms. I tried adding onion but preferred it without. I added more mushrooms and a little more wine, but sticking to the recipe as it is won't do you wrong. Delicious! Directions were easy for a first time risotto and beginner such as myself.

This was my first tie making risotto and I really liked this dish.  I spent an hour just prepping all the ingredients - wiping two pounds of mushrooms & thin slicing them and the scallions, plus grating the Parmesan.  I snipped fresh chives from my garden.  The total project was 2 1/2 hours and worth it.

The only change I made was  to add an extra third of the ingredients as the package of Arborio rice I bought measured 2 cups.  Everyone at the table commented on how good this was and had an extra helping.  I used Chardonnay wine and had a glass along with the process .  I do plan to make this again.  I may add extra Parmesan next time since that flavor was  extremely pleasing.

This recipe is great! I did have to simmer for roughly 30 minutes, but it was worth it to get the perfect consistency.  Even with multiple substitutions made, it turned out delicious. For anyone wondering, onions work just as well as shallots in this recipe. Also since I didn't have white wine, I  used some white wine vinegar mixed with a little chicken broth and it made the risotto slightly more tangy but amazing!  It's a must try recipe for sure!

It is a beautiful risotto recipe. I am not a big fan of portebella mushroom so I used white mushrooms and crimini for the recipe and it turned out delicious. I used vegetarian broth as I am a vegetarian. Like one of the reviewers' said, I added couple cloves of garlic and it was perfect. I could give 100 stars to this recipe. My husband loved it! Thanks for this recipe!!!

This was fantastic and well worth the effort! I used one onion instead of the shallots and the tops of green onions instead of chives. I served this with Chef John's Braised Short Ribs with Mushroom and Tomato and it was a complete hit! I will be making both dishes again! Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Makes a lot,   I half the recipe and get 4 large servings.  Very good though.  It does take a long time.   You really need to add the liquid slowly and stir nearly the entire time.   I'd bank about 35-45 minutes as opposed to that 15-20 suggested.   I think its a great recipe though.  Made it many times and follow it exactly.

FANTASTIC! Never made risotto before and admittedly it is a high maintenance dish. But as everyone has mentioned the results can be well worth the effort. My wife and I took turns stirring while noshing on some bread and having wine to pass the time. We did add shitake mushrooms as well as those mentioned but kept the total to 2 lbs as recipe says. Surprisingly creamy and hearty and it was our main dish! If you have the time and patience, this dish is hard to beat. I can see other possibilities in lieu of mushrooms or with, like asparagus or scallops. Definitely restaurant results if not better. Great recipe!

Bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, but found the result bland.  Salt will help, but perhaps garlic, too, and some herbs.

This risotto is the real deal. I love it. Add garlic if you love garlic, and experiment with different kinds of mushrooms: cremini adds some depth to the mushroom flavours. 

Hot tip, though: put on shoes before you make this, or your feet will be killing you by the end!

All in all, this was a pretty good recipe. I didn't read the reviews before making because I prefer to try the original dish before adjusting. So, that being said, way too much mushroom. I would do half of the amount that was called for.

This recipe is quite basic, needs more stock and mushrooms. It took longer for the risotto rice to soften (twice as long in face). Over it was okay, I made my own alternations to the risotto.

I avoided the butter. For me, it is already rich enough. I liked the amount of mushrooms, so you really get the flavor with each bite, but it tasted a bit one-note.

The only thing I did differently was to use dried porcini mushrooms which I strained and poured 2 cups of boiling water over, then chopped after reconstituted and then added them near the end. It was delicious and I would make it again. It turned out like the risotto we had in Lucca last year. Great recipe.

This was beyond delicious! Me and my BF are picky about what we call delicious... but this most def was. It was restaurant quality. The only thing I really changed was I used about 1/2 the amount of mushrooms and I diced them small. Make sure to turn the heat up higher to bring to a boil... I made this meal several times now. Once with chicken cutlets another time with lobster tails.

This recipe is MAGICAL! I had a dinner guests who is vegan, so I was able to substitute a few ingredients in this recipe to make it vegan-friendly. I had to cook the risotto a little longer than 20 minutes. But if you've made risotto before, you know it requires some commitment. I highly recommend this dish if you're hosting guests. It's quite impressive and very delicious.

This recipe really is fantastic. It was creamy and flavorful. I would have to say that reviewers complaining about blandness may simply be under seasoning. We enjoyed this dish so so much, and we will certainly be cooking it again. 
We did make a few changes, but nothing major. Just differences in cooking styles. Anyhow, we cooked 1.5 pounds of mushrooms and sauteed them in butter (as we normally cook them), and lightly salted them. We also used green onion instead of chives, and vegetable broth rather than chicken.  Also, the bag of rice we used was two cups, so we used it all.

Yum. My first time making risotto and I loved it. Now I am not afraid and there are so many optional additions. I loved it as the recipe was and will love it many more times with whatever changes I decide to make. Thanks!!

DEFINITELY make sure you have the broth hot enough that when you add it to the rice it starts to simmer immediately, that's VERY important or it will take you a LONG time to get to that lovely creamy texture.

Very good.  I ladled the broth in a ladled at a time and just took my time to make it creamy.  I also used asparagus instead of the second pound of mushrooms.

I made this today - I would definitely echo the comments of previous reviewers that 2 lbs of mushrooms would be too much, cut it in half (this change is what made me decide to make the review 4 stars instead of 5).  I also added some garlic at the beginning and some chopped olives at the end because that sounded good.  What came out was exactly what I think of when I say risotto.  It was relatively easy to make (as long as you don't mind a half hour or so of stirring), and quite tasty!  This will almost certainly become my foundational risotto recipe for future attempts.

Though I've never before made risotto from scratch, I found this recipe easy to follow. The dish came out perfectly, rivaling the quality I've enjoyed at restaurants in Little Italy! I'll definitely make this again and suspect it'll be my new go-to for dinner parties. Thank you!

I have made this several times.  It comes out wonderful every time.  Very hearty, you could almost consider it a meal.  It does take longer to absorb the broth than mentioned.  I would recommend a pinch of saffron to enhance the flavour and add a bit of a yellowish colour.  Also,  shaved parmesan cheese makes it a perfect and with great consistency.

I too think that this method is worth the time.  It is also easy to adjust if you prefer a little less mushrooms or if you want it thicker or thinner.

first time making risotto. I chose it because i am on a low cholesterol diet, and this recipe does not use cream. I did keep the butter, and sprinkled a whisper of cheese on top(gotta live a little). I stirred for half an hour, and it came out delicious.

Keep the heat on the same temperature setting it asks for when you're browning the mushrooms and it'll come out just fine. Btw I didn't use 2 lbs worth of mushrooms maybe 1lb, half white half baby Bella. I put extra parm cheese (cause there's nothing wrong with extra cheese) and stayed over the stove stirring the mixture with the broth. It's a lot of work but I think it's worth it.

Directions say to divide the broth in half and warm one half in a sauce pan.  Then tells you to add the broth one 1/2 cup at a time until absorbed but doesn't tell you from which half of the broth to use.  Also, never tells you what to do with the second half of broth.  I ended up making this by adding all the broth 1/2 cup at a time and it turned out perfect.  Give yourself plenty of time to make this.  I also diced the mushrooms into chunks instead of slices and loved.  Would make it this way again.

I'd make it again for sure. Keep in mind that it is labor intensive to add 1/2c liquid at a time, but totally worth it to get the right texture. Used it as a template for my risotto, thus the 4*. I needed wayyyy less liquid to get the rice (arborio) al dente, browned the rice/onions before adding any liquid. Used 200g white button mushrooms, bit of truffle oil and had a nice mild flavor.  The brand of rice didn't get as creamy as I liked, so I added a bit of heavy cream. Wild garlic was in season, so I added (alot) at the end just to wilt. Awesome flavor, great texture. Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the mushrooms as most said.   Didn't have shallots, used one small onion. Not a fan of chives, so left them off.  It DID take longer to cook that stated, but it was SOOOO GOOD!!!

Made last night. Added just 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic to shallots and only had 1 lb. of baby bells. It was the most incredible risotto I have ever tasted!!!!!!
It's what I love to order at restaurants but mostly disappointed when I'm served. First time I've attempted to make it myself-thank goodness for your incredible recipe!  Totally worth it! As one reviewer suggested, poured myself a glass of wine, and sipped while I had to stand and stir. Took about 25 mins.-but went by in no time! :) Dinner included roast cornish game hens, parmesan coated baked asparagus along with sourdough garlic bread. My husband is truly one of  the pickiest eaters in the universe and he said it surpassed anything he's had in a five start restaurant. 25 years of marriage, thousands of gourmet meals, and this is the best compliment ever received. We've traveled extensively and are definitely "foodies".  BEST RISOTTO RECIPE EVER!!!!!  Deserves far more than 5 stars!

I've always been scared to make Risotto due to all of the cooking shows I watch and how many times I hear how difficult it is to make it creamy and delicious. I'm not mad at myself for thinking hat and not making it sooner ! Sure I had to stir for a good 25 mins or so but it was soooo worth it . I added fresh parsley since I was out of chives it's heavenly! Thank u for the recipe

So. Good. My fiancé went from never trying risotto before to declaring it was his favorite dish. I am a vegitarian, so I made it with vegetable broth. I used the full 2 pounds of mushrooms, half the butter, and added some green onions and garlic. It was sheer perfection. I agree that it takes longer to cook than specified. Try it with a red blend wine- it makes it taste like pure butter!!!!

I scaled it down to 4 portions and used 1# portobello and 1/2# white mushrooms with everything else done according to the scaling.  My wife and I enjoyed it a lot.  We ate it with some grilled chicken and asparagus.

We had this as a side dish and there was probably enough for 3 people as a side dish.  If you are eating this as a main entree, the original recipe for 6 servings will probably feed 3.

Really good recipe and easy to make (except for the constant stirring). I only had portobellos and sushi rice but the result was still like good risotto that I've had in restaurants. Hubby loved it.

Really yummy - here's what I changed... (1) Made if for my kids and they claim they don't like mushrooms, so I chopped the mushrooms very small.  Also used slightly less than what the recipe calls for - but not that much less.  (2) Used a lot more onions (about 7 small onions total) and garlic (about 7 cloves) than what the recipe calls for - caramelised those first for both the mushrooms and the rice.  (3) Used some truffle oil.  (4) Eliminated the parmesan cheese altogether - though this would make it really yummy.  Reason why I eliminated the cheese is to make it vegan.  (5) Didn't use the parsley though I think that would have been yummy, too.  (6) Doubled the recipe - feeding a family of 7!  (7) Used 2/3 chicken broth and 1/3 water - or else it may get too salty.  (8) Used less liquid than the recipe calls for - mine started to get a little too mushy for my taste.  Watch out once the pieces of rice have all stopped having the white/paste colour.  Overall - delicious!

I sauté  for almost 30 minutes, then added havarti with dill cheese, since I didn't have Parmesan. I used a full pound of mushrooms with sweet onion instead of shallots and it was perfect. Definitely keeper and perfect for company!

I followed this recipe exactly, with one exception- I used 1 lb. of baby Bella mushrooms, because I thought 2 lbs. of mushrooms that the recipe called for seemed like an error. The dish came out absolutely perfect. Worth every minute of constant stirring! Enjoy!

I love this recipe and so does the family. I also add asparagus and red onion as well before cooking the mushrooms and then they all get blended together. Makes is more interesting and more flavor. This is my wife's favorite risotto. Definitely a do over!!

Excellent recipe. Used rich homemade stock and added a carmelized onion. Do not rush the absorption of the liquid as others recommended.  Cooking time was 50 minutes, but well worth the time for such a creamy, delicious risotto.  Use best-quality ingredients.

I changed the quantity of risotto ( only 1 cup ) and the chicken stock 4 cups ( instead of 6) . Mushrooms l used 16 oz ( I think half of the quality specified here ). I used  arborio rice imported from Italy and on the package it said cooking time 18 minutes . So I cooked the rice adding chicken stock for 15 minutes then without taking the Rice of the stove I added the mushrooms, butter and parsley. Really nice , moist and tasty . Enough mushrooms

Great recipe!  I've made it twice now.  Make sure your broth is hot and resist the temptation to reduce heat.  I do use less mushrooms - one package baby portobellos.  Otherwise I make as directed and it turns out perfect.

This was a more complicated recipe but tasted excellent and I will definitely make it again. I used the green ends of spring onions instead of chives. I found that it didn't really need the butter or any additional salt as the chicken broth, wine and veggies gave it a lot of powerful flavors. In future I may leave out the parmesan and butter as I think it made it quite rich.

Never even knew mushrooms secreted so many juices! Absolutely delish! Everything turned out perfectly. Definitely make sure the chicken broth is boiling by the time you start introducing it to the rice and it will keep the process within the 20 minute time frame so long as the rice is on med-high heat. I did cut the amount of mushrooms in half. Also only used 2 tablespoons of chives instead of 3. Turned this into an amazing dinner by adding chicken to the mix. My husband and I loved this and will be making it again, thank you for sharing!

Substituted green onion tops for the chives and yellow onions for the shallots. Used skitakes and crimini mushrooms. Was outstanding.

This was amazing! Will make it again and again! I did add a little extra cheese. I used 1/2 cup instead of 1/3 of a cup. I only used 1lb of mushrooms and felt like this was MORE than plenty. I think that it may be a typo in this original recipe. I love mushrooms too. 
It is time consuming and next time I will cook the rice a bit longer before adding the ingredients. The flavor profile was awesome! If you are wanting to impress some guests or your family, this is the recipe for you!

First time making Risotto and it was really easy and the taste was spot on! I skipped the cheese, used Vegetable broth and added a touch more butter and the consistency was perfect. Barely required any additional salt, just pepper to taste. Thanks!

Takes a LOT of time to cook - I think I was stirring for closer to 45 minutes switching between medium-high and high heat. Also, cooking the mushrooms works a lot better in a large skillet - the large sauce pan I initially used lead to a lot of problems with stirring and heat transfer.

Few tips: Using a measuring cup as a ladle for the chicken broth helps a lot with the mess (I originally just eyeballed and tipped the pan over, turned out fine but the chicken broth got everywhere). Also, start off with the largest pot possible for the rice, it takes up a LOT of space after you add everything together.

Also, while the initial volume of mushrooms is a bit overwhelming, it does cook down a bit, and comes out to a reasonable distribution when all's said and done.

Delicious!  I just added 1 pound of baby bella mushrooms, then some frozen peas (a great addition), and a cut up rotisseri chicken from Wallmart since my boyfriend needs meat for it to be a meal.  So good!  Would definitely make this again, other than those additions I followed the recipe to a T.

Added cooked zucchini, bell pepper, corn, cherry tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, and garlic to the original mushrooms but cut the mushrooms by 2/3. So awesome! Omitted the butter as there was enough salt with the broth.

This was delish! I ended up adding some butter to sauté the vegetables. I cooked the mushrooms as directed and just before they were done, threw in half of a sliced red pepper (I still wanted the pepper to have a little crunch to it). Instead of shallots, I used a white onion because I had it on hand. After the onions had cooked down a little, I added a few small cloves of garlic, pressed. I added a little cayenne pepper to give it some spice. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. This was great as a side dish but I can also see it being a whole meal. Next time I think I'll cook and drain ground spicy italian sausage and add it to the risotto at the end. Enjoy!

Fantastic, absolutely delicious.  Easy - well except for the constant stirring.   I followed the recipe to the letter except that I used half the mushrooms (I omitted the white mushrooms) and I cooked it for about 30 minutes.

Great recipe!!  My boyfriend doesn't eat many vegetables so I didn't use mushrooms and added peas- one of 2 veggies he will eat- and it was amazing! 
Thanks for the tip of adding broth slowly- as this was the first time I made risotto, I would have probably added too much too fast!

I didn't use shallot nor chive, nor portebello mushrooms, simply because I had none on hand. I have made this many times, without the shallots/chives/portebello mushrooms, and I always get rave reviews. Excellent comfort food- sooooo yummy! I don't need to eat anything else, but you can definitely serve it as a side dish should you wish to do so.

Very, very good! Have to agree with another Reviewer that there were actually TOO MANY Mushrooms. But it made Our Daughter blissfully happy :) Might use a few less Mushrooms next time and make about half the quantity. But Our Daughter took half of it over to her Mother-In-Law's and made them Happy too!!

I made this as a side dish to go with prime rib.  Everyone loved it.  The result was a very hearty, creamy dish.  I would certainly make this again.   I used 1/2 the amount of mushrooms called for in the recipe, and it was plenty.  I would add more cheese next time.  Overall it was delish.

We added 5 cloves of garlic minced and sautéed with the onions.  We used low sodium beef broth instead of chicken broth. We used a barley textured pasta to complement the salt encrusted prime rib roast.  Yumm!

I Have made this recipe several times, I do take a bit longer to add the broth and I will throw in Asiago cheese or any other cheese I have left over.  It always comes out creamy and tasty.

So yummy.  I ended up cooking longer than the recipe stated on medium-high heat... about 30 - 35 minutes.   I served it with seared scallops and jumbo shrimp.

This is the only risotto I have ever made. I don't use the whole amount of mushrooms, 2 lbs??? Crazy! I used this recipe for my final in culinary school and totally rocked it. Chef said it was definitely the best in the class. I am going to make up a big batch and try to freeze it and use my foodsaver. For Christmas I am making a weeks worth of homemade, Gluten-free meals and shipping them to my family. I hope this freezes well...

Since losing my previous risotto recipe I gave this one a try. I did make a few changes. I added chicken when I was cooking the mushrooms. Instead of butter I did heavy cream and oh my gosh it turned out so good! Not healthy at all but a great treat. Will be making this again. (:

Take your time, enjoy the process, and receive a great reward for your patience. This recipe is divine.

One note: Put the sliced mushrooms into the hot pan dry – no oil. Just keep stirring them as they squeak and a couple minutes later they'll release all their own juices. Let them simmer in that until they've absorbed it all back up. There's no need for oil.

A great recipe to showcase delicious chanterelle mushrooms (I sub those for portobellos and white mushrooms) with some modifications: I sautée torn pieces of chanterelles in small batches in a bit of olive oil first and set them aside on a paper towel. I substitute 2 cloves of diced garlic for the shallots and omit the wine if I don’t have any on hand (it is better with it though.) To keep this dairy-free, I use 2-3 oz. goat cheese instead of parmesan and omit the butter.

Wonderful risotto.  Followed the directions except I took the advice of other reviewers and used fewer mushrooms.  In the end I used 12 ounces of sliced Portobello mushrooms which I coarsely chopped. Also expect to spend closer to 25 minutes when using the broth for cooking.  This could vary depending on the heat being applied to the skillet.  I used a low-medium heat as I find it results in a more tender Risotto.

I made half a batch for two of us, but instead of three cups of chicken broth, I used four.  I also used three tablespoons of  butter instead of two.  The cooking process took me closer to 30 minutes, but that could've been my fault for not having the pan at a hotter temperature.  My boyfriend loves mushrooms, so this was a hit.  For my main and veggie, I grilled a large salmon fillet with some salt and pepper and grilled asparagus with some Fiesta brand Uncle Chris' Steak Seasoning.  Very filling and satisfying.

One of my family's favorite dishes I make! I frequently add 1 cup frozen peas to this dish only five or so minutes before serving, which provides a nice pop of color and some more veggies to this dish. Love this risotto!!!

I used about 1/2 of the mushrooms ( the other I sauteed in butter, garlic, pepper, and worchesterchire sauce lol ) 

For the people who stated it was bland, it really wasn't.  I did add a little more fresh parm cheese.  It had a very heavy mushroom flavor. Not a super fan of mushrooms, so I'm not sure if I'll make it again for just me.

It was a very good risotto! I used lemon juice as a substitute for the wine, I already halved it so that it wouldn't be too strong. Sadly it was still too strong, though I'm sure the risotto would be perfect if I hadn't halved it but added 1/3 or 1/4.

I followed it almost exactly (no bella mushrooms, chopped onions and a dash of garlic salt instead of chives and shallots, which I didn't have on hand). Was very decadent: creamy. Smelled better than it tasted...a no go with the kids.

I find that it's not quite flavourful enough, next time I'd add more shallot, some garlic, sautee the mushrooms in butter rather than olive oil and season with lots of salt+pepper.  I used low sodium broth so after adding in the mushrooms it can really take a lot of seasoning.  I found the cooking times noted were pretty spot on, so all in all a pretty easy recipe to follow, but needs some creative flavouring.

I toasted the rice before adding the Chardonnay, and I doubled the chives, cheese, and butter. I also put about 3/4 of a cup of the cooked down mushrooms in with the broth to allow the mushroom flavor to absorb into the rice as the rice was cooking so that the mushrooms were more than just an adder to the rice.

It turned out wonderfully. This was the best risotto I've done yet. Next time it'll be an asparagus or butternut squash risotto.

The risotto from this recipe turned out delicious. As others have recommended, I turned down the heat a little and cooked the rice longer. I ended up with extra broth but that wasn't an issue. The recipe recommends 2 lbs of mushrooms for 6 servings and that I think is way to much. I am a mushroom lover, but with 2 lbs of mushrooms and just 1 & 1/3 cup rice, you end up getting about the same volume of mushroom as you do rice. I would highly recommend using only 1/2 lb white & 1/2 lb portabella mushrooms instead of the 2 lbs recommended.

I made this for my family at an italian themed Thanksgiving last year, and we all went crazy for it.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe (except cooking the rice a tad bit longer) and am about to make this again.  Fantastic recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Was a great recipe. Loved it.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and some fresh thyme from my garden. I also took a sprig of rosemary and simmered it in the broth. Thanks for the great recipe. .

Wonderful! Rich, yet satisfying. I didn't have enough mush so amount was cut in half. Still delicious! Stirred in spoonfuls of broth, took me approx. 30 min. a constant stir. My 4 yr old loved it, two your old not so much.

This recipe is incredible. My boyfriend loved it and actually didn't believe I hadn't made it before. I didn't alter the recipe at all and it turned out perfect. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again. Thank you!

This is a very tasty side dish!  The only changes that I made was to add a large clove of garlic while sauteing the onion (I didn't have any shallots) and then added a mixture of herbs at the end when stirring in the reserved mushrooms and juices.  I served this along side a rustic herb rotisserie chicken and some fresh green beans.  Am looking forward to adding some of the rotisserie chicken to the left over risotto!

I paired this recipe with a filet mignon and it was fabulous. I added extra Parmesan and for next time I would add additional shallots, the texture and consistency was perfect.

Not that this recipe needs any more accolades, but I made it this afternoon and it is so worth the effort. It took me 20 mins to get the rice al dente which really isn't too much to ask for this final result. I did cut down butter to 2 tbsp but otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. Thank you for posting this!

I made it the first time as written and it was wonderful (though with only 8 oz of mushrooms), I've made it several times since with chicken and/or asparagus to make it a meal.  Everyone in the family loves it!

My fiancé loves risotto and mushrooms so this was perfect! I made this in a pressure cooker and cooked the mushrooms separately and added them at the end. Turned out great!

For those of you who felt the 20 min. is not long enough, I suggest you 1) use a high-straight-sided frying pan to make your risotto. 2) Make sure your broth is warm enough, it should not 'sizzle' when you add it. It should be pretty much the same temperature. 3)Turn the heat up just a wee tad and I don't think you will be disappointed.   I geared this down for serving 2 with enough left over to try the Risotto al Salto today. (Still used a frying pan)  Was short on mushrooms but was just as tasty.  I heat my chicken broth in a glass measuring cup in the micro, specifically so I can give it a quick zap when I feel it is cooling. This leaves my other burners free but still gives me the important heated liquid to add.

This was delish just as written and for my first try at risotto, it was easy! 

 I do see where you CAN cut the mushrooms in half if you don't want it super mushroomy. We have decided that if we are going to use this as a main dish we will leave it with a pound each but as a side, maybe cut it to half. I took the advise to have the broth on low and the risotto pan hot enough that when the new broth was added it boiled immediately. I would say probably 30 minutes total,.

We will most definitely be having this again!

I had a not so great experience the first time I tried to make risotto (using the package recipe) and vowed to try it again. Boy oh boy do I wish I would have found this recipe the first time! It was delicious, and people had seconds and thirds.  I am no longer afraid of risotto thanks to this recipe! I did use the full 2lbs of mushrooms, but did need to cook down longer than the 2 minutes noted, and yes it's a lot of mushrooms, but I think that's sort of the point :) I did end up with a lot of liquid from the mushrooms and was worried it would make the risotto soupy once added, but it soaked right into the rice and really infused the extra mushroom flavor.  Another tip is to make sure the heat is such that the broth essentially insta-boils when it hits the pan but not so hot that you are in danger of burning the rice.

This is my all-time favorite risotto recipe.  I follow it exactly.  I would only say that the key, for me, is don't be afraid of high enough heat.  Not high, but not too low either.  It shouldn't take too long for the ladle of broth to absorb into the rice each time.  That's why the 15-20 minute cook time in that section is accurate.

A very good recipe that allowed for personal variations to be made! 

I halved the mushrooms (as suggested), used mushroom stock instead of chicken, and replaced the white wine with stock (because there was a vegetarian and Muslim eating this).

I'd never made or eaten risotto before in my life, and had the impression that it was immensely difficult and troublesome to cook. What a surprise! It was very simple and there were no rough patches in the process AT ALL! My rice absorbed the stock very quickly (as mentioned, keep the stock simmering). Excluding prep time, it took about half an hour. 

Will make again!

Absolutely amazing recipe! The only ingredients you need to make the perfect risotto. I agree with the time needing to be about double, but I'm also cooking on electric, which I hate, so it's a bit harder to get the temp right without getting to hot. It's a must to bring the broth to a  simmer before adding, do not pull out of the fridge and add cold or at room temp! This is a family favorite, thanks for sharing this.

I added asparagus to the rice and broth about half way through based upon how it was made at a local restaurant. It had been a several years since I ate it there. It was better than I anticipated and even better than I remembered from the restaurant. It was an awesome recipe. Thank you, Myleen.

I have made this recipe several times, even with all of the mushrooms requested. It is always a hit and pairs perfectly with grilled salmon. I will say it turns out differently every time I make it. But there are two key elements in my opinion: 1. The wine is essential to creating the flavor of this dish; don't leave it out or substitute! 2. Cook it low and slow, adding a ladle of broth at a time...this takes a very long time, longer than the recipe says...but soooo worth it. Just keep that bottle of wine next to you while cooking and you'll be just fine ;)

This did take a little time to prepare but it was worth it. I did not add the cheese because of allergies. But I will definitely make this again. It was so good.

Follow this receipe and you'll make the greatest risotto ever!   My wife doesn't ike mushrooms so I've experimented with other veggies or just exclude veggies altogether.  Starting with the Shallot though, is a must!

Made this for hubby and I, 21 weeks pregnant and wanted to cook with some wine. Making this was pretty time consuming, and my hand started to tire with all the stirring. However, the effort was so worth the outcome. Yum! Strong mushroom flavor, which is perfect since I wasn't looking for a cheesy flavor. I didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese, so used shake style. I think fresh would be even better. The hubby raved and ate 4 helpings, and asked that it get put in the recipe box for future recreations.

Wow...amazing! ! Made a few changes only because of personal taste. I only used about half the amount of mushroom (kids) I love mushrooms! Used garlic in place of shallots. We don't drink so no wine in our home just used an extra 1/2 cup broth. This took more like 35 min...but so worth it. Actually pretty easy to make. I almost forgot I did use about 1 tablespoon less olive oil and 2 tablespoons less butter.

Delicious and easy!!! i took some of the recommendations and added caramelized onions, a little more wine, and served alongside chicken & brocoli for one of the most delicious sides i have ever made! next time i may try adding a pinch of fresh chopped rosemary, as i feel the flavours would be very complimentary!

This was the best mushroom risotto I ever made. Adhering to the previous commentds, I used 8 oz. cremini with 1 cup white wine to start. Then followed the above recipe. Mmm-mmm-mm-mm-mm! I had some in Florence, Italy about 10 years ago...patting my self on the back!

Dinner last night....yummy!  am vegetarian so served a salad before hand of steamed mini zucchini's and shallots, palm hearts,cucumber and lettuce.  WOW! this is time consuming, but well worth the effort!  used tips from many reviews, added a clove of local garlic (never use Chinese anymore) upped wine to one cup so broth went down to 5-1/2 cups...used organic chicken broth (not a die hard vegetarian, just don't eat meats) used 1/2 pkg of Costco mini bella sliced 'shrooms along with two kinds of pleurottes 'shrooms....fresh parm and garden chives!  wow was this good, but very filling! going to try pacegirls recipe for leftovers Risotto al Salto....sounds to good to be true!  tres Italiano!  thanks for sharing!

Want to make it vegan? Make sure to find a vegan sauvignon blanc as it seems most aren't. I used Kendall Jackson which is vegan. Substitute 1/3 cup nutritional yeast instead of parmesan, and earth balance buttery sticks for the butter.. I love garlic so added 4 cloves with the shallots. MMMM.. delicious! I bet non-vegans wouldn't even know!

This is my go to recipe for risotto - although I have added other things at time depending on what is in my fridge.  Much of the time I use a beef broth or demi glace instead of the chicken broth and sometimes add red wine instead of white (this discolors it a bit - but not as much as one would expect) simply because I love the warm flavor of the red. Sliced roasted red peppers are nice too. Be careful that you take the time involved, it is so worth it!

This was my first try at risotto, and I will be making again!  I added some dry powdered porcini mushroom as well right before the mushrooms were done cooking.  Not really needed, but I love porcini flavor :-).  Yes, it was 25 minutes standing over the stove, but the results are worth taking the time.

Really loved it, but I think mine was not as moist as it should have been. Maybe I kept it on the heat too long after the last of the liquid went in.  I put about 1 lb total of mushrooms, and I didn't have shallots, so I used a couple tablespoons of red onion and a couple cloves of garlic as a replacement. The flavor was great, I just don't know if I made it too sticky.  This was my first try at risotto, and now I want to try other risotto recipes!

I love the recipe but it come out a little too thick.  I have made risotto before but it was still really good.  I just added some more chicken broth and it came out perfect!!!!!

Great recipe!  I halved the recipe since there are just two of us. Only used 8oz mushrooms. Added garlic  along with onions..(had no shallots)and a little tarragon as someone suggested. It was wonderful!

Yummmmmm. And easy! I had that crappy 5-minute rice on hand so I used less broth, because it took much less time for the rice to get al dente. I added about a cup at a time instead of a 1/2 cup, probably totaling 3 cups. This would have been better with pretty much ANY grain, no doubt, but it was great even with the stuff I used. I will be making this again and again and again!

Dangerously delicious. I made a few minor changes to the recipe, though. I used 3 and 3/4 cups of stock, yellow onions instead of shallots, and half as much mushroom. I also added rosemary, green onions and parsley. Absolutely wonderful, best risotto I've ever eaten.

Yes, but I added chicken which I cooked separately, (in a lot of butter and herbes de provence), pancetta and peas because when I think of risotto, I can't think of it without peas. I think the mushroom amount is just right.

I made this last night and Hubby & I really liked it.  I made it as written (which I always do the first time).  I used about a lb. of mushrooms - white button & baby bellas.  I had all the ingredients ready before I started cooking (mise en place as Anne Burrell says), which really de-stresses the cooking process for me.  It took time, but the result WAS well worth it.  Next time, I'll sauté the mushrooms in some of the butter with a little garlic.  this went great with grilled tenderloins and my Dad's garlic & wine bread.

This is my first time writing a review.  Although it took patience to stand by and stir the rice - it was absolutely worth it!  I made the recipe exactly as noted and it turned out perfect.  They are correct when they say the key is to add the broth in stages.  This turned out absolutely gourmet.  This will impress anyone who comes to dinner.  Thanks very much for the great recipe!

Made this today and it was very tasty.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I ended up adding more rice, broth, and wine, and the only cheese I had was aged cheddar) but it didn't matter.  Very good!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the T and loved it.  It is very rich, thanks to all the mushrooms.  Makes a lovely side, and is totally becoming a regular around here.

This risotto is amazing with steak or chicken.  I used different mushrooms such as button and baby pearl and still had great results and flavors.

I really liked it. I'm not a huge fan of rice dishes, and this was my first attempt at making risotto, so I wasn't expecting perfection, but it was quite good. I used all baby bella mushrooms, and sauteed them with butter and wine instead of olive oil, so I went lighter on the butter and wine in the rice. I also didn't have the chives to add at the end, and didn't miss them. My fiance really liked it, so I will likely make it again to go along with one of his meat dishes.

The basics of this risotto was deeeeeeeelicious!
I don't like mushrooms (yes it is true), so I took a handful and chopped them into small pieces before I sauteed them. I didn't have chives. 
And it took over an hour to cook.
In the end it was amazing!

Bland as is. Added a little creole (of course), smoked paprika & 4-5 asparagus spears (fresh and sautéed with the mushrooms). 5 stars with additions!

I have never made risotto from scratch before! My husband and I had roasted lamb and thought this recipe would accompany it well. It's true, you have to keep stirring, but I didn't mind while my husband and I enjoyed wine. I did add 1/4 cup more wine and omitted 1/4 of stock in place. We added more cheese for our own taste buds! The risotto came out creamy and delicious! It was great left over too. This is a keeper!

I used the ingredients as listed except I omitted the salt/pepper and used only half the butter.  It turned out wonderful. I'm not sure how this could be considered bland. I also used the amount of mushrooms as listed and was not disappointed. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was really yummy. This was my first time making risotto and it turned out great. My bf enjoyed it as well. I just wish there was a burst of flavor to it, it was missing that.

Made it for the first time, came out delicious, I did use a little more wine, than the broth.  Next time I will use trufle oil just to see the difference. Please note it does take more than 20 minutes for the rice to be al dente.

I added 4 cloves of garlic and sautéed with the shallots. I also used 1 cup of white cooking wine & one container of chicken broth. It is time consuming & takes at least 30 -45 minutes. I didn't pay attention but it was definitely longer than 20 minutes. 
It was delicious!  If you want to impress someone....make this recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It's very flavorful and easy to make.  I am vegan so I made a few substitutions: instead of chicken broth I used vegetable broth, instead of olive oil I used coconut oil and instead of butter I used vegan butter. I also omitted the cheese. It tastes great! Thanks so much for posting!

Loved it. I used just a third of mushrooms recommended, fried the shallots with two cloves of sliced garlic, and added one tsp of fennel seeds and two celery stems into the rice before adding the broth. Best risotto I've ever made.

This recipe was amazing! I added a little more cheese and also did the garlic as some were suggesting. Ive never made risitto before and it came out prefect! I didnt need to use all of the broth though. Thanks for the recipe!

Was a 5 start after I added some things- sautéed a small onion and some garlic before adding the rice to toast it. Finished with some black truffle oil. Stellar!

Followed this recipe and it turned out great! I left out the chives because I didn't want it too oniony.  Will use this recipe again as a base for other additions.

I made this with better-than-bullion veggie stock, which was great and definitely not bland.  Tripling the recipe took the cook time to about 45 minutes.

MY FIRST TRY AT MAKING RISOTTO AND IT WAS VERY GOOD.  I DID NOT USE THE QUANTITY OF MUSHROOMS IN THE RECIPE.  I DON'T LIKE MUSHROOMS THAT MUCH.  ONE POUND, OR LESS, WAS PLENTY.

Last night was the first time in 2013 that I actually cooked a meal & I picked this recipe. It was simple to follow and it turned out fabulously yummy! I'm quite picky about risotto and this dish is close to the top risottos I've had in Italy. Well worth the effort of stirring! My family came back for seconds. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I'm tempted to give this 4 stars because of the effort involved in making it- but it was really delicious when *finally* done.  I found all the cooking times to be way understated... 1) it takes more like 15 mins to get mushrooms soft/cooked, not 3.  2) It took more like 40 mins of constant stirring to get all the liquid absorbed into the risotto, not 15-20.  That's where the hard work comes in...I finally had to get my husband to relieve my tired arm at the stove :-)  
I used almost the full amount of mushrooms, since we like them and it wasn't too many, just a lot :-).
I subbed in a bit more wine and cut back on the broth a bit.
Still, I found the final dish to be lacking something, so I added more parm cheese (roughly doubling it) and that definitely helped.  Instead of regular salt, I used a provence herbal seasoning salt, and that really helped add flavor too.  I would highly recommend doubling this recipe, as I did, since the same amount of labor will yield you a lot of leftovers and they freeze well.  I'm going to put this one in my "make for very special occasions, and make a day ahead so that the amount of labor is long forgotten and I'm not sweaty when guests arrive" file.  Or I'll just order it in restaurants! Very yummy.

I increased the wine three fold by first reducing the wine to the recipe's recommended amount. I also increased the (sodium free) chicken broth by one half. I cut the butter and oil in half and this made for a leaner, tastier version as both my husband and I are very health/weight conscious. I had to use white onion, so I added a touch of garlic as shallots have a naturally light garlicky taste. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe.  Didn't have arborio rice so I substituted basmati and it was delicious anyway.  Also used veggie stock instead of chicken stock.

This was surely worth the slow cooking.  Awesome and I didn't have the wine so I just replaced it with 1/2 cup of broth.  Very rich and tasty.  I would be proud to serve this when I have company.  Thank you Myleen.

I made this a few weeks ago, I changed it up by using a variety of mushrooms (probably more then called for) and it was a hit! I am making it again tonight and will be adding some shredded chicken in as well.  The key to this dish being a success is making sure your stock is near by not quite boiling so that you don't reduce the temperature of the pan.  I also used home made from scratch stock so it has a bit more flavour then store bought.  Definitly a winner and would recommed this recipe to anyone who had avoided making risotto as they felt it was too difficult.

I misplaced my normal rissotto recipe and this was the first basic one I found to get the broth/rice ratio close.  I have a vegetarian daughter so I used a combo of veggie and mushroom stock from our freezer.  I also had planned on a larger variety of mushrooms so I used the oyster and shitakes that I had but someone had used the brown buttons (aka crimini or baby bellas).  I also rehydrated some dried mushrooms from a local asian store, using the liquid as part of the stock.  Also, my son had used the last of the sherry on a chicken so I subbed in white grape juice with a splash of white wine vinegar.  My family has a love of garlic, rosemary, thyme and marjorum with mushrooms so I added about a tsp of each.  This is a great basic recipe with a lot of room to customize it to individual taste.

Risotto is my vegetarian daughters favorite food. I made this for her and it was perfect. I did halve the mushrooms and used mushroom broth. It was just amazing!

I've made this 5 times now and everyone that has tried it loved it.  I cut down on the mushrooms and I use more portobello than white (if any).  Also, it may be my boullion but i had to cut the stock down to 1/3 to 1/4 of the quanity recommended in this recipe.  I kept the same amount of liquid, just less boullion.  It was way too salty when i made it with the full amount.  And I greatly prefer a good amount of finely sliced green onions instead of the chives, it's cheaper, and really adds to the complexity of the dish.  I stir in some green onions at the end (should be a tiny bit of green in every bite) then also sprinkle on top for presentation.

This was really good! I did cut back quite a bit on the mushrooms; I probably used less than half. My boyfriend still thought there were too many but I thought it was about right. I took the advice of one reviewer and added a clove of garlic in with the shallots. The only complaint I had about it was that it was a tad salty - I think it was probably because of the chicken broth I used. It did take quite a bit longer to make than the recipe said. But all in all, I was really happy with this for my first try at risotto.

This was one of the best things I have ever made (even when, after all my effort expended that is required to make a good risotto, my husband said, "This is great! It tastes just like Cream of Mushroom!") I made this as a vegetarian entree (a little over 1.5 cups of arborio rice made enough to feed my family of two adults and two small children). I forgot to buy chives so I didn't use those, but otherwise the only change I made was to replace 2 cups of broth with water. I also paid attention to the debate over the actual amount of mushrooms that was intended to go in the recipe, and used a total of just over one pound, which was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

I have made this several times.  This is the best mushroom risotto by  far.  Much easier than other recipes I have seen.  Yes, it takes time, but it is well wrorth the effort.  I used regular onion and shitake mushrooms along with the portabella this time because that is all I had on hand. Still turned out great!  My husband gives this 5 stars as well.  Love it and will keep making it.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It's a bit time consuming, but easy and definitely worth it.  I am going to experiment with less butter next time around.  It was incredible as-is, but too rich to enjoy very much at once.  Just personal preference.

Outstanding! My first time making risotto & it lived up to the excellent reviews. I followed the recipe as is.  It's not complicated, but it is labor intensive.  It took longer than 20 min for all the stock to absorb. I doubled the recipe, so I'm not sure if that contributed to the longer time. It definitely helps to have everything ready before you start because you're pretty much tied to the pot once you start adding the stock.  I'll  definitely make again. Everyone loved it.

I'd always been scared of making risotto, but this recipe was idiot-proof!  I cut the amount of mushrooms in half as others have mentioned, and it was perfect.  I didn't need quite the whole amount of broth - so make sure you are checking the rice as you get towards the end of the cook time, don't want to oversaturate it.

I cooked this a bit too low (the recipe seemed too high at first) and so the rice broke down a bit too much, but the flavours were awesome - mushroomy and cheesy. I will try again as written, although I wouldn't be afraid to try all different mushroom combos,

Make sure broth is hot before adding to the rice.  It speeds up cooking time.

Step5:  Top with grated parm and chives.

Made this for the first time tonight and served it with grilled steak.  Risotto was fantastic, but maybe just a few too many mushrooms for my taste.  I left out the butter completely by accident and it was still so good I may leave out the butter on purpose next time!  Excellent recipe that, like every recipe, needs just a few minor adjustments for individual taste.  Thank you for posting it!

So, let's just start off with the fact that when I have an idea to cook something..it looks more like a cartoon with a light bulb idea go off, followed by the tazmanian devil spinning by. Anyways-I've never made risotto (or rice or that fact). I actually had no idea that you need  a certain type of rice. Anyways-in about an hour, I had "perfection on a plate". In the process, I almost set my kitchen on fire (twice) (keep pan on low when adding broth..). but I have faith in each and every one of you that you will also get perfection. I used thin sliced portobello mushrooms (and sliced them again), and used fresh parmesan rather than the powdered . I also forgot to use chives and had no wine, but they were not missed.  Definitely making this a staple.

This was a great dish and I am not even a big cooked mushroom fan!!  Everyone loved it.  I did cut the amount of mushrooms in half and everyone said it was excellent.  Even my teenage son who can be a bit picky loved it.

I have made this risotto twice now and it is amazing.  A lot of stirring and it does take time, but it is so worth it.  Leftovers, if there are any, heat up really well.  This is a recipe I will make quite often.

This was very good.  This was mine and my husbands first time eating risotto, and we loved it! Followed the directions except for using a half of onion rather than shallots.  BUT I must agree with the others, the butter (or at least the whole portion) is not really needed.  Oh, and I used the whole 2 lbs of mushrooms and although there were a ton of them... we didn't mind.  If you are not a big mushroom person, you may want to only use half.

This recipe is amazing. It's very easy to make this recipe dairy-free as well. I substituted Smart Balance for butter and omitted the parmesan cheese.  Even with these substitutions, the risotto turned out very creamy and flavorful. I agree with other postings, I did not use the full amount of mushrooms. But I did use more portobello mushrooms than white because I like the flavor of the portobello. This recipe is definitely worth a try.

I've made this twice now.  It's incredibly good.  However I'm trying to achieve softer rice.  I'm hoping someone can give me a tip for some part of this tutorial to achieve softer rice.  I already turned up the heat on the broth a bit and it helped slightly.  I'm thinking I should let the rice sit in the boiling broth without stirring so it cooks more thoroughly?

Great starter recipe -- modified by adding an additional 3/4 cup sauvignon blanc in place of the last round of chicken stock. Much more aromatic and more pronounced flavors. Also, to get the right consistency (creamy), I took more like an hour to infuse stock/wine. Thanks for the recipe!

I took this into work for a carry-in, and it was a big hit. Be careful doubling this recipe, though. I didn't think it sounded like a lot, so I doubled it, and I ended up with a ton of food. I'll be eating this all weekend, though that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Outstanding recipe. Based on other reviews, we used half the mushrooms. We kept everything else at the same quantity, though I probably added a little extra parmesan to the top before serving. I know we'll make this again and again!

The best dish ever! I used half of an onion instead of shallot... I also cut the mushrooms in half. I used fresh oyster,shitake, and baby portobellas. OMG... The best thing I have ever made hands down... the only down side is it doesn't taste half as good leftover. You HAVE to eat it fresh.

I admit I was always a little intimidated about making risotto. The thought of half cooked soggy rice wasn't exactly mouth watering to me. I grew up thinking that you never ever uncover the rice while it's cooking or else it wont turn out right. So I said well how hard is it really? I mean if it dosn't turn out then oh well! The curiosity got the better of me yesterday afternoon. What the heck I'll try it. I am super glad I did AND it turned out great! Not at all difficult,(or half cooked and soggy)but wonderful! Creamy and delish! The only thing that I did change was the wine. I had none so I substituted it with Saranac blueberry blonde ale beer. It gave it a slighty fruity hint of flavor that we loved! Thanks for sharing!

I've never made risotto,I've always thought it was too much hard work, but this is THE best risotto I have ever had, and well worth the effort, I replaced the chives with oregano, and shallots for onion, I am addicted, it took about 25 mins to cook, I will make this all the time, Myleen you have changed my life, thankyou,I will tell everyone about your risotto.

Amazing!!!!! We followed the recipe almost exactly, but i did eye most of the measurements. The times were a BIT off for me. The cooking the mushroom down and slowly adding the broth ("should take 20 min") took a lot longer. You just have to keep tasting the rice as you cook it after 15 min and the mushrooms are a no-brainer, but i like to taste them anyway. We used Sauvignon Blanc and Romano instead of parmesan. YUM!  the salt and pepper are as to taste, so i added a bit of salt because im an addict, but in allhonesty it didnt need TOO much. Great recipe. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!

This was phenomenal!. First time ever making and eating Risotto and I must say that it is now one of my favorite dishes. At first I thought there was going to be way too many mushrooms,but the amount was perfect and the flavours blended so nicely together. My grocery store did not have shallots or chives at the time, so I had to leave those out, but I'm sure that it would add nicely to this dish. THank you for sharing! Will make again!!

YUM, never evah made risotto before. YUM. We made it with mushrooms/parm/butter then served seared asparagus on the side with (raw) baby spinach. YUM. The risotto was Wegman's brand and so rich and yummy! I would recommend using a little more wine but I followed the directions exactly because I never made it before. We all agreed that with chicken we may not have enjoyed it as well (this from a real meat-eatin family). YUM, keeper. Best recipe I think I ever pulled off and really-have never made it before!!!!

I have made this recipe twice. Once as the recipe is stated and the second time with onions, butternut squash, and chicken and apple sausage. Although it takes what seems like forever this recipe is solid. Ive never made true risotto before this but both times it turned out wonderful. Thank you Myleen for making me feel like I am a real cook :)

Husband and kids thought this was great. My first husband was European Italian and owns a four star authentic Italian restaurant so our kids are spoiled when it comes to real risotto but they thought this was really good. Used a lot of the reviews to help me do my best on this risotto. Only 2nd time at trying to make risotto from scratch and all the reviews really helped me. Took about 60 minutes from start to finish cooking time. Kept chicken broth hot on stovetop. Also added 1/8 cup white wine when cooking mushrooms to avoid sticking to the pan. Sorry for such a long review. All in all, I will make this again when I am full of energy but it does require a lot of babysitting.

I ended up using a big red onion because that was all I had, and wild mushrooms instead but in roughly the same quantity. Loved it!! I don´t know why people say there was too much mushrooms, my husband and I loved it like that. Would definitely make it again.

The rice is cooked perfectly if you follow the instructions. 
My only regret is that I didn't read all the reviews before cooking.  The ONLY thing I would change is to use half the amount of mushrooms.
Delicious!

Easy recipe to follow. This was my first time making risotto.  I had fun with the recipe and just put the amount of mushrooms I liked and added zucchini (asparagus also a good add). I did not have shallots, but an onion is an onion, so I put in some scallions instead.

Although I thought the amount of mushrooms was going to be too many it didn't seem all that bad in the end.  I did find that the cook times were correct when I cooked the rice on high heat.  Super delicious!

Very, very good. Worth the work. I think some reviewers were right on the use less mushroom thing-next time I make it I will probably cut the amount in half. It does take longer than 15-20 minutes to cook it correctly. Will make again, maybe with something other than mushrooms.

For all the time it takes to prepare this dish, it should have five star flavor, but I didn't think it did. It was tasty but not worth all the work.

OMG!!!! This was my first attempt at making Risotto and it was absolutely fabulous.  I did make some changes though.  I added boneless chicken thighs (seasoned only with salt & black pepper).  I also added a combination seasoning when cooking the challots (1 tbsp ea of paprika; cumin; and chef jhon's all purpose seasoning; 1 bay leaf).  The addition of these spices really created a bold flavor but did not take away from the taste of the mushrooms.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing

This risoto is sooo good. My acid test for a dish is, "Would I order this in a restaurant?"  The answer is definitely "yes," and my guests agreed (after having seconds). At first it looked like too many mushrooms, but by the time the dish was finished, it was just right:  a mushroom or two in every bite.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I'd never made risotto before but came out perfectly. I didn't have white wine, so just skipped that bit and used chicken stock, although I will try with wine next time. Served with grilled chicken and homemade tomato and basil bread...yum!

Nice recipe..my first time making risotto. The stirring is painful but worth it in the end. I did end up adding 3 cloves of garlic and some chopped onion into the mushrooms. And ended up using about 5 out of the six cups of stock. the rice was cooked and creamy plus I was tired of stirring. Not sure I'll be rushing to make this again only because of the amount of attention it requires but this will be my go to recipe when I do.

Awesome risotto!  Used one portobello and a handful of white mushrooms and it was perfect!  Didn't need all the broth.  It did take longer to finish than twenty minutes.  Next time I'll try a larger pan.  I'm sure this will speed up the absorption.  But wow, ths is yummy and my family raved about it.  Also a nice lunch leftover.  It's really worth the work, give it a try!

My risotto turned out AMAZING. I hadnt altered anything, did it just the way you said! Maybe it took a little more time (about 30mins), but i think it depends on the type of rice used... I used regular white, if used integral, could have taked longer to soften :) Oh, yes, I used 5 cups of broth, but I dont think it matters that much (i just didnt make more)... From now on this is my most favorite recipe :)

Very nice recipe.  I agree with Naples, the secret to a great risotto is time.  I took about double the time to absorb all of the liquid.  Also, if you like a "meatier" risotto (like I do) discard the stems and thick slice the portobello mushrooms.  A tablespoon of pure Canadian maple syrop when cooking the mushrooms also adds a bit more flavour.

This dish is super!  I substituted mushroom broth for chicken to make it vegetarian, and I used one lb of mushrooms instead of two. I also used brown rice, because that's what I had. I had trouble getting the rice to absorb all the liquid, so I covered the pan and cooked it that way and it came out great! The butter, and cheese, and salt and pepper really give it a kick at the end! Thanks for the recipe!

I tried the original dish and thought it was rather salty so I just happened to do a chicken dish a week later and used fresh bouillon instead of the powdered chicken bouillion...it was fabulous...i also added shitake mushrooms on top of the portobello and button mushrooms...also i used asiago and parmesan cheese which intensify the taste...it was fabulous

Absolutely delicious although it took me around 37 mins to cook it to the creamy/aldente stage. I added chicken that I sauteed at the end as well and divided into 8 servings since I am on WW and did not have enough points to eat more (although I could have easily eaten two servings as it as that good!) Thanks for a good basick recipe.

Delicious. I made a couple substitutions for items I didn't have in my pantry: vermouth for wine and parsley for chives. This was so good and the recipe was easy. Will definitely make again and again.

This was my first time making risotto. My son Christopher helped me, and it was so fantastic!! My husband had a HUGE second helping, and my youngest son who doesn't even like mushrooms loved it! Thanks for the recipe! Will try adding roast vegetables as well next time!

This was great, I added zucchini and chicken.  The only change i would make is to add seasoning to the mushrooms and any other additions (in my case zucchini and chicken).  I only added a little salt, thinking that the veggies would absorb some of the flavor from the risotto.  That was not the case...

Loved this dish!  Never cooked risotto before and was very impressed. I added chicken to it (and a little more wine than suggested, in place of some stock)..  it was really fast to cook too! will make again.

This is my go to risotto recipe. It is absolutely amazing. Sometimes if I don't have wine, I use some beer or add some extra lemon juice.   I don't use shallots, I use regular onions.

This is the first Risotto I have ever made, it tastes amazing. Next time I think I will add a little sour cream to make it a little richer other than that it is too good to mess around with.  ...So good.

This dish was super easy to make and deliciously flavorful! I made this as our main dish along with homemade garlic bread and it was a huge hit! I used all fresh ingredients and organic vegetable stock. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted just like the risotto I had while I was in France. I would highly recommend it!

This is such a hearty risotto! I never realized a vegetarian rice meal could be so satisfying. I use cremini, white and portobello mushrooms when making this, but follow the rest of the directions exactly, minus the chives for which I substitute thinly sliced green onion tops. It has never turned out mushy, never soggy... perfect every single time. It has become a meal I entertain with and receive rave reviews each time it comes to the table. My favorite is to top this with shaved parm, rather than grated. I love finding those bigger pieces of cheese buried in warm, comforting rice. Trust me, this one is worth the time involved!

My boyfriend and I ADORE this recipe. He asks for it constantly and now I am making a triple batch for his work picnic. It is wonderful. I do add more cheese to it but that is just a personal preference. It is wonderful as is.

Awesome recipe!  I made this for my anniversary dinner...it was my first time making a risotto and it turned out wonderful!  You really have to keep mixing it as it cooks, it's time consuming but very much worth it!  I used 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth because I'm vegetarian.  Also chopped up only 1 big portobello mushroom.  I used a great tip from a colleague...I bought a packet of dried porcini mushrooms, reconstituted them in hot water and then added the water to my vegetable broth.  Gave my risotto a wonderful rich mushroom flavor!  I'll definitely be making this again!  :)  Thanks for the recipe

I use a little less butter and less cheese at the end--it's not as rich (a good thing) and has less fat.

This was one of the best things I have ever eaten! I couldn`t believe I cooked something so good. The only thing I did differently was add more vegetables (spinach, zucchini, onion) and garlic and cut down on the mushrooms and it turned out to be more of my taste. This recipe was perfect just the way it is though if you`re a mushroom lover. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!!!

Best risotto I've ever made, and by far the easiest I've ever made.  I served it to friends and they said it was better than any restaurant they'd had risotto at.  I also had some shitake mushrooms on hand and put those in and they were great in it.

this was excellent!  I added a garlic clove to the shallots.  I tasted it midway through adding the broth and it was very salty, so I substituted 2 cups hot water for the last two cups of broth.  I think next time I will just use low sodium broth. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!!  Although I use 5 cups broth and 1ish cups wine.  And you don't have to stir CONSTANTLY.  Put in a bit a of broth, wash the lettuce for your salad, then stir.  Turn your meat, then stir again, etc.

Great Risotto.  This is one of richer versions of a risotto but we love that.  Also, try adding asparagus or your other favourite veggie.  It is great!

I am not a big risotto fan but this was very tasty. I did not have any dry white wine so used vodka and it still came out great.  It did take me longer than 20 minutes to get all 6 cups of broth incorporated.

great recipe. i'm a complete novice in the kitchen and actually began cooking the rice before beginning the recipe, which was all wrong. after starting again, and with a little help from my boyfriend, it turned out so great. definitely doing this again.

This was incredible, and I've never made risotto before.  RAVE reviews from some serious foodies.  Followed the recipe exactly, except for more bellas than white mushrooms.

Time consuming, but worth it.  I break this recipe out for special occasions.  My husband and I both love this.  Make sure you use top notch ingredients for this one; a good EVOO, a good wine and a great Parmigiano-Reggiano.

YUMMY!!! This was my first time making risotto and it came out very good! The thing that I did was add garlic, and instead of chives I used parsley. I didn't add the cheese, and didn't use the butter. Other than that it came out fabulous!!!

Recipe was fantastic, but reduced the amount of mushrooms and substituted more chicken broth to saute the mushrooms in instead of the olive oil to reduce the fat.  Fantastic!

This was the first time I have ever made Risotto.  It was amazing!  I used the full amount of mushrooms and everything went within the time it was supposed to.  Soooooo good!  We paired it with Parmesan crusted chicken and fresh green beans and had one amazing dinner.  If you take the time and give it a shot you will have one amazing dish!

This is almost excellent.  I'd use either less chicken broth, or at least a low-sodium broth and control the seasoning with table salt or more cheese.  I just used about 1.5 large portobello mushroom caps and about 6 button mushrooms, and that seemed to be enough.  Otherwise an excellent recipe.  Was getting really tired of the boxed risotto!

I made this the other night and it was absolutely amazing!  It was also my first attempt at making risotto, and it won't be the last.  If you're a mushroom fan, try it.  It is great for dinner on its own, or you can grill some chicken to put on top for a heartier meal.

Delicious! Was my first time making risotto and it came out perfectly. I also substituted chicken broth for the white wine. I prefer orzo instead of arborio rice so I used that as well. Amazing recipe and one that I will make over and over again.

Classiest thing I have ever made.  Came out great.  I only used chicken broth, no wine and my shallots were a quarter of an onion I had.  Still wonderful though.

Really easy to follow recipe.  I used low sodium chicken broth and the only salt I added was some kosher salt tossed over the mushrooms when I cooked them.  It still tasted great and I would be wary about using full sodium broth.  The only other thing I did differently was add 2 minced garlic gloves in with the shallots and some chopped basil along with the chives.  My wife and I both loved it and will certainly make it again.

This risotto is amazing.  I needed only 5 cups of broth & accidentally used 10 ounces of white mushrooms & 2 portobello caps weighing 6 ounces.  Glad I did not use the 1 pound of each as suggested, as both my husband & I agreed that the risotto would have been overwhelmed.  This recipe is a keeper & a dinner party addition.

This recipe is awesome!  It sounds time-consuming, and it's definitely an investment of your time, but it's not too bad and it's completely worth it.  Warming the broth is *key* to getting it to absorb correctly, and I don't think I use a pound of mushrooms each - sometimes I substitute Crimini for Portobello.  Also, I like to add fresh spinach at the very end of the recipe when adding mushrooms back in - adds color and little extra flavor.  All together a great recipe!

Amazing, simply amazing.  I made it with white mushrooms and shitake musrooms.  I also doubled the wine and cut back on the broth.  I have never ever made from scratch risotto....what a lot of time wasted.  This was perfect with grilled flatiron steaks and asparagus.

This was pretty good. I think that the 4 tablespoons of butter is overkill. It made my dish taste really greasy to me, so next time I would use only two. Thanks for the recipe

oh wow.  I made this tonight for my husband and I.  Had to use a small can of 'shrooms b/c I didn't have fresh on hand.  I sauteed chicken breast with a little lemon juice and rosemary, and sliced it and fanned it across the risotto, and served with roasted rosemary root vegetables.  Looked quite fancy!  Thanks for the delish recipe!

This came out wonderfully creamy, I used fewer mushrooms and cooked for much longer adding about half a cup of liquid at a time as another viewer suggested.  Wow this turned out so good. It was my first time making a risotto but won't be my last, thanks for sharing.

Love it! Pretty easy to make, just takes time. Avoid making it on a hot summer night without AC!

I love authentic recipes, Myleen your insight into checking the rice helped make this the perfect dish, my first time at risotto, I've heard how hard it is to make correctly, but this rivaled any great restaurant I've had risotto.  Love it love it love it.

I made this recipe just to see what Gordon Ramsay complains about every week in Hell's Kitchen.  Considering I'd never made risotto before, this is a fantastic recipe, and evidently fool-proof.

This was one of the best mushroom risottos I ever tasted. I used white and baby bellas. I did decrease the mushrooms as many recommended and it was still a lot. I made this in huge quantity (quadrupled the recipe) for a large event and everyone raved about it! Definately worth the effort.

Brilliant risotto, loved it. The only variations i made to this recipe was the addition of truffle oil drizzled on plate before plating risotto and a little extra parmesan and wine for more flavour.   Cooked it for my wife with homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu II atop and a nice Chardonnay  Thank you for the recipe!

This was the perfect Mother's Day dish for my Mom who loves Risotto!  I used 1/2 the amount of chicken broth and substituted with white wine.  I also continued to add more white wine as we were waiting for the meat on the BBQ to finish cooking. I used chopped red onion instead of shallots.  Once the rice was completed, I folded in the freshly grated Pecorino and Romano cheese.  The chives were added before serving (as opposed to cooking in butter).  I think next time the portobello mushrooms will cook on their own and I'll add them in after the rice is cooked and this will save on using extra cooking dishes (less cleaning to do).  Great dish - it was a hit - Thanks!

This is hands-down the best thing I've ever eaten.  Make certain that you stir it nonstop; leaving it for a few minutes while you do something else can leave you with a scorched mess on the bottom of your pan.  I believe in trying every recipe exactly as is the first time, and I was worried about seasoning it only at the end--but I'm so glad that I held off until the end.  I used French sea salt for its subtle flavor, and I highly recommend it for this dish.  I will make no changes to this recipe--it is perfect as is.

It was the highest rated recipe so I decided to try it. The risotto turned out excellent. If you use chicken stock that is already salted you definitely will not need to add more as it calls for. The parmesan at the end adds much flavor too. Easy and quite enjoyable. Will definitely keep this one.

Wonderful Risotto.  I added 2 cloves garlic with the shallots and left out the butter.  Cook time was closer to 40 min and worth every second.

Very delicious! I highly recommend using low sodium broth. Otherwise it is too salty. Also, double the wine. I've made this twice, once with shrimp mixed in, and once with chicken. I used white mushrooms only. I mixed butter into my husband's portion but not mine and it was still very good. I highly recommend this recipe as relatively easy, inexpensive gourmet eat-in meal.

My first time making risotto so I was thankful to have an easy-to-follow simple recipe.  Good flavor.  I loved the rice just the way it was before adding the mushrooms, cheese, butter, and scallions so I will make again using other ingredients too, perhaps different veggies.

Very tasty! I made stuffed bell peppers with this risotto: I cut the peppers in half, drizzled with olive oil, garlic salt and a dash of red pepper flakes and cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes, then took them out and added the finished risotto, sprinkled with some Parmesan and baked for another 10 minutes. Delicious!  My only complaints: It took me at least 30 minutes at the stove, and I made what was claimed to be six servings to feed four people, and we probably only ate a third of it. But I'm ok with yummy leftovers!

The best recipe I have prepared from this site to date. You may want to mix low sodium chix broth in to reduce the salt, or use it in place of the regular broth altogether. This recipe allows for much experimentation without compromising the base level of awesomeness achieved. Yeah, i said awesomeness...

YUM!!!  I made this last night as we had some mushrooms to use up (only had button mushies) and it was fantastic!  I thought at the time that it seemed like a huge amount of mushroom but have since seen the recipe owners post!! (not sure I'd halve the amount - it was great!)  It also worked fine with medium grain rice.  Definitely worth a go and will become a good staple!  I plan on using the leftovers as another review said - breaded into patties.  YUM - thanks so much!

Made this the other night and loved it.  The only thing I changed was using vegetable stock instead of chicken because I am a vegetarian.  Absolutely delicious!

This mushroom risotto is well worth the time that you need to prepare. So...creamy. I used baby portabella instead. You can make it the main dish it's that good. This one is a keeper.

Fantastic recipe! As others noted, it does take much longer than the prescribed 15-20 minutes to get the risotto to the nice creamy consistency required, but once it's there it's totally on point.   I cooked up some turkey Italian sausage and added it at the end for a complete meal, and everything came out fantastic. 5 stars are not enough.

excellent recipe, my boyfriend always asks for this as a side dish.  i have made with and without the mushrooms, its good both ways.  I have also made with just regular white mushrooms, no need to buy the fancy ones you cant taste the difference.  i use about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of white wine to really get the taste in there, then just cut the amount of chicken stock.

A definite 5 star recipe! This was exceptional.  Everyone who had it couldn't believe how phenomenal it tasted.  This was a restaurant quality dish.  I however did NOT use Arborio.  I used medium grain white rice and it was still fantastic.  Although, it DID take about 30 minutes to cook. I prior to this did not eat mushrooms, but this I enjoyed.  I will keep this recipe and make this again and again.

I used this recipe on my first attempt at risotto.  It turned out AMAZING.  I used only white mushrooms as I had no portobello on hand, and I skipped the chives.  I only used 1 shallot and added 1 clove of garlic.  This was so incredibly tasty and easy to make - it's definately added to our family cookbook!

Never made risotto in my life and this was amazing!  I was drooling as I cooked it.  It definitely took twice as long as the recipe says in order to get the proper consistency, but it was so perfect in the end, I barely had to use any butter. I did almost double the white wine and it really was just delicious!  Seems asparagus is the go to veggie pairing for this.  I did it too before reading these reviews and it worked well.

This was FABULOUS!  I made this following the recipe exactly.  The only thing I added was about a tbls truffle oil. It did take about twice as long to make, but was well worth it! It was a perfect Valentines dinner! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful, my husband loved it too and he's not a fan of risotto. only had 4.5 cups of broth - and it was fine, make sure the broth is warm as you add it to prevent rice from getting mushy. restaurant quality !

Came out great!  I'm not a huge mushroom fan, so I just omitted those.  I followed the rest of the recipe closely!  I used a special garlic/parmesan cheese finishing butter that went really well with the risotto.  My wife said this was the best risotto I've made, so I that must be worth something!

This was delicious! I didn't use the 2 tbs butter, after tasting it I didn't feel like it was needed.  I liked the mushroom to rice ratio. It looks like a lot cut up but they do shrink when cooked, and they add a lot of flavor to the grain.  I would probably also use low sodium broth next time, esp if you add the parmesan.

Delicious! I modified this a bit because I didn't have all of the ingredients available. I used only baby portobellos, I had no white wine (used extra broth instead), and no chives. I added a little garlic and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Very yummy!

I doubled the wine, did not have shallots so used garlic with the mushrooms and the cooking time was definitely doubled.  After I added the mushrooms and butter, I did not add the cheese as it was delicious and so rich, I could not even imagine more...maybe next time!

This recipe is delicious!  I pretty much followed this recipe as is except cut down on the mushrooms.  I did 1/2 pound of each and it was more than enough.  And I'm one that loves mushrooms but 2 pounds of mushrooms would have have been waaay too much.  Paired this with pork tenderloin. FANTASTIC!

Tasted wonderful, although even after following the instructions very carefully I found that the texture was more mushy than al dente.  Definitely time consuming, not a fast fix side dish for a busy family.  I will probably try making this again and play with the amount of liquid to see if I can get the texture down right.

Really?! 2 pounds of mushrooms? seemed like kind of a lot to me. Maybe because i don't love mushrooms? Only used half a pound of white mushrooms and half a pound of baby portabellas (all I could find). I sliced half of that and chopped the rest so there wouldn't be so many big chunks of mushrooms. (blegh) Other then that i followed the recipe exactly. YUUMMMMMMMMM!!! I used to be intimidated by risotto. Maybe because they sell fancy risotto pans and risotto spoons? I always figured anything needing special equipment would be too much work. Not at all! Basically, pour and stir, pour and stir. Voila, a pot of deliciousness! Don't be intimidated! Also, it seems kind of bland at first. Once you add in the butter, parmesan, etc it's excellent.

My first risotto!  Loved this.  I think I cooked it on too high of a heat because the liquid kept boiling off.  Used 10 cups of broth before it was finished.  Anyway, the end result was amazing.  Will make again and often!

Absolutely wonderful. Didn't use as much chicken stock as recipe called for and it took a lot longer to add the stock...more like 45mins, not 15-20 that the recipe states

Positively amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted so good. Sadly, my husband didn't like it much - found the texture to be too sticky and weird, but the good news is that I ended up with enough for dinner for the next two days. :)

This risotto is great with some changes! The first time I made it according to the recipe, and it was too salty. The second time I made a half recipe, and used 2/3 the amount broth and made up the rest with water. I added two leeks instead of shallots and used white grape juice since there was no cooking wine at Target... but it turned out amazing!

Exceptional, tasty dish! I don't think I've ever made regular rice so this was a long shot for me. But the recipe is so easy it's nearly fail proof. I've read some reviews saying it's a lot of work, I think saying "it's a lot of time" would be more accurate. I was stirring for more like 30 minutes and I only used 8oz of each mushroom as opposed to 1lb each. I made in a large non-stick skillet instead of sauce pan but it still came out fine. Will make again and again!

This is my favorite side dish, as well as my families and neighbors!  It does take some time and attention but it is easy to make.  It took some convincing to get my mushroom-hating husband to try it, and now he actually admits that mushrooms are not too bad.  My two and 4 year old even love this dish!

Absolutely delicious!  The only risotto that I have ever had is the kind that comes from a box, and this was so much better.  It was very creamy and had tons of flavor, but nothing was over powering, it was all very well balanced!  Definitely worth the extra work.  Will be making again!

The best mushroom risotto I've had... outside of Italy.  Not too hard to make, just time consuming, but for a lot of recipes you're standing at the stove anyways.  Made this with Skillet Lamb Chops for the perfect Mediterranean meal.

This was the second time I have made this risotto recipe.  It was a huge hit both times! Like some other reviews have said, it is time consuming to make, but I feel it is worth it in the end.  All of the stirring aside, a very easy and wonderful recipe!

SO AMAZINGLY GOOD and simple. I didn't have a lot of chicken broth. 3.5 cups, and rest water with salt. I didn't have dry white wine, but put chinese cooking rice wine. Before I even put anything in it, it was amazingly tasty. put half amt of butter it said. Added parsely, basil flakes.

This is the only recipe I have used on this site so far that I followed the recipe to a T and it was PERFECT.  My mom hates risotto and she loves this.  I studied abroad in Italy and refused to try any risotto here but then i gave into this recipe and it definetly was up to par with what i ate in italy.  Since this is very filling, I usually serve it with something light like Giada's Chicken Florentina in a light red sauce.  Amazing!

This turned out great! I added chopped, steamed asparagus at the end for some extra color and crunch. Definitely use the low sodium broth, I found it plenty salty so I think full sodium broth would ruin it.

I loved this! My husband made it for me and it is wonderful still - three days later. We used two full pounds of mushrooms which I think makes it awesome. We did use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock - I'm vegan - and left out the Parmesan. It was still excellent. I plan for it to be my main course for Thanksgiving. Thanks!

This recipe is just lovely as is.  I always worried about "building a risotto," but this was a wonderful surprise.  When I cooked the mushrooms, I added a tablspn of prepared minced garlic and a nice splash of dry white wine.  And I also did half butter and half olive oil to cook the rice.  We had it as a side to corn-fed roast chicken and braised peas.  PERFECT!!  THANK YOU MYLEEN!

First off, cut the amount of mushrooms the recipe calls for in half! I used 3/4 the amount and it was too much for my taste (although my husband was in heaven).   This was my first time making risotto and I've gotta say I'll def make it again.  I didn't know rice could taste this good!

Very yummy creamy texture. Went well with chicken. The only hint:  be sure to use low sodium broth otherwise it can be a little bit too salty. I cannot wait to try it with other meats.  Thank you Myleen.

By far the best risotto I have EVER had. I am asked to make this weekly and there are never leftovers. I've made with regular onions since I did not have shallots and it was just as delicious. I also tend to leave the wine out as my family does not like it.  Excellent, I will pass this one on for sure.

I made this almost as the recipes calls, but used a sauteed sweet onion instead of shallot, and omitted the chives, as I don't like them. It was awesome! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time making risotto. It was time consuming but worth it! You really have to watch it the whole time it is cooking. You can't just throw this dish on the stove and walk away.  I have added this to my favorites and will definately be making this dish again in the very near future!

This was my first attempt at making Risotto and it went very well.  I didn't have any shallots, so I just used a quarter of a purple onion and some garlic.  I also just used dry parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

I love risotto, and this was one of my best attempts at recreating a risotto I had in Los Angeles on my first really nice date (hahaha).  I had to cook mine for much longer, as the broth wouldn't soak up and the rice was still a bit hard.  It also took me about 30 minutes just to cut all those mushrooms (I cut mine into smaller pieces and started with whole ones, not pre-sliced).  I plan on making this again fairly soon (this time with pre-sliced 'shrooms, though)!

WOW! I used wild mushrooms. I do not like mushrooms so I sent some aside without and I should have set more aside. My kids and husband loved it with the mushrooms.

This was really yummy!  It takes a while to make, but sooo worth it! I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and a bit more mushrooms (I really like mushrooms). I also used 3 or 4 different kinds of mushrooms, depending on what's available, which made it even more yummy! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did tweak it abit to our tastes.  I warmed the wine first and put some fresh basil in and squeezed some fresh lime in as well.  Then after that was warmed I added it to the rice.  After it was all done I added about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream and did added have of the butter that was called for.  This recipe gave me a great start!

I used organic mushrooms and used truffle oil instead of olive oil when sauteeing the shallots. Also took about 7 cups instead of 6 to reach the consistency that I wanted. It was heavenly! Had a rich and creamy taste without any cream!  No more craving restaurant mushroom risotto when I can make it at home! =)

Although I followed the instructions to a tee (especially adding the both and wine v-e-r-y slowly, the dish came out much too gummy. If I ever make it again, I'll cut the liquid back by a cup or two. It also needs needs a bit more olive oil for cooking all those mushrooms.

Excellent!! If you follow the recipe and keep adding the warm broth in 1/2 cup increments and stirring, you won't need butter.  I halved the mushrooms per correction by recipe author.

Have you ever been to a restaurant and had the risotto, and while you are eating it you said to yourself "I wish I could make this."?  Well, you can.  Just follow this recipe.  It was amazing, very easy and delici-oso!!  As for the amount of broth I used, I didn't really measure, I just got two quarts, heated them both through and added it until it was done to my liking.  Amazing recipe, thank you MYLEEN.  I will never have plain old rice ever again!

This is restaurant quality risotto! I made one this recipe and stuffed mild banana peppers with it before I added the mushrooms. I added the mushrooms to the remaining risotto. I put the peppers on the grill...the risotto was perfect! thanks.

Yummy!  I just used regular white (long grain) rice, and it was still good.  I will try it with Arborio next time, but wanted to say that if you didn't realize there was a difference and you are about to make this with regular white rice, go ahead!  I don't think you will be disappointed.

It's a keeper! I used only 1 pound of cremini mushrooms but sliced them VERY thin with my Japanese slicer. The mushrooms blended throughly with the Arborio rice. I used vegetarian broth and onion (forgot to buy shallots). I'm not an expert on risotto but this was delicious.

I cut back the mushrooms, as others suggested, and still found it to be satisfactorily mushroom-y and flavorful.  Yummy!

I skipped the mushrooms and added a roasted chicken breast instead.  I doubled the amount of wine and added a chopped garlic clove.  Overall, a fantastic recipe with room for expansion.

Excellent!  I've never had authentic risotto, so I didn't know how chewy the rice was supposed to be.  I might cook it 20 minutes next time, instead of just 15.

So delicious!!!  I used any kind of mushroom I could find at the grocery store and forgot to add the butter...didn't miss it at all, so I would definately omit it next time.

My first time making risotto was a success! Husband loved it! I would only put 2 tbsp buttter in. I would also add mushrooms and final ingredients before taking rice off burner to heat through.

I did this pretty much as written except that I cut the mushrms in half and used dry sherry instead of white wine.  Sherry goes so well with mushrooms.

First time I ever made risotto and it turned out beautifully.  I cooked the mushrooms a bit longer but used the full two pounds and loved it.  I will definitely make this again and hopefully serve it with scallops next time.

Great recipe.  I made it almost exactly as is.  I didn't have shallots, so I minced about 1/4 cup of onions and 2 smallish garlic cloves instead.  Everyone loved this!

OMG!  I can't get enough!!!!!  There are a few things I do different.  Garlic......I can't live without it.  So, I put some in.  I also reduce the amount of mushrooms.  I think there are too many.  I cut them in half.  Then I doubled of wine and cut down on the water.  These changes were just curbed to my palate.  Very solid dish!

This was delicious.  I did make a couple of small changes based on personal preference.  My boyfriend and I do not like onions, so I eliminated the shallots and the chives.  I used 1/2 clove of garlic instead (I cut the recipe in half because it was just for 2 of us, so you may want to use a whole clove if you make the original amount of servings).  I put it in the pan with the risotto when it was browning.  It did not make the risotto garlicky at all, it just added a little something.  I am sure that if you like onion, this recipe is perfect the way it is!  We loved it and I will definitely make it again.

Excellent rendition of a classic Italian dish. The mushroom amount may seem like a lot, but trust me, you'll be glad you put that many in. Tasty!  The only thing missing are the truffles. ;)

I made this dish twice. The first time I used white grape juice and garlic. The second time I used white wine and doubled the recipe because my husband loved the first one! Both wonderful. Will keep this in my recipe book. Thanks!

This was freakin' amazing!!! Best thing I've ever cooked.  I increased the wine by 1/2 cup and decreased the broth by the same since I love that flavor.  The parmesan just pulled all the flavors together.   I substituted garlic for shallots, and jasmine rice for arborio since that's what I had and that worked great.  I have to wonder though, if you can cook rice by adding all the liquid in at the same time, why not add half of the broth until absorbed as if cooking a regular pot of rice, and then work on slowly adding the rest?  Just a thought.

Very good, although I made my own adjustments, and didn't use butter or cheese, as to make it vegan.  Used no chicken "chicken" broth, and the wine.  Turned out great, I use the basic recipe for risotto's of all kinds, including a pear risotto I decided to try.  This is my go-to recipe for when I have company coming over, worth the prep and cook time for sure. Its a main course all to itself! Delizioso!

This recipe was amazing...I changed it up a bit. I added four cloves of garlic and 2 Red Peppers and just cut  down on some of the mushrooms. I also did not use the wine and used 1/2 cup more of the broth...everyone loved it..

It was just o.k.  It tasted mostly like rice in creamy chicken stock to me.  I did halve the mushrooms as other reviewers suggested.  I couldn't taste the parmesan in there at all.  It also took more like 2 1/2 hours-3 hours to incorporate all the liquid into the rice.  I did use brown rice instead of Arborio since I am on a diet that restricts white grains.  That could account for the time difference.  The consistency was just right for brown rice when it was done with the creaminess of a risotto.  So, consistency-wise it turned out perfectly.  I just found the flavor not that interesting.

This was really tasty and hearty enough to be a main course! I had never had risotto but saw it served on Hells Kitchen and decided to try it out.... It does take a lot of stiring, but is really good and I think I might experience with other add ins next time!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was fantastic! I used 8oz each baby bellas and white button mushrooms. I also substituted red onion for the shallots. I didn't need to add any salt, just some fresh ground pepper. I will definitely make this again. Great recipe!

I've made this a couple of times and we love it!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of onions for shallots.  The kids didn't like the parmesan cheese so the next time I made it without.  I will be using the recipe again.

Very good and easy risotto recipe, the best I have tried thus far. I left out the wine (do not drink it) and used regular salt, not sea salt... and it was still wonderful!

Worth the work.  Fantastic.  I actually used Vermouth instead of plain white wine since I didn't want to crack open a half bottle.  I was a little nervous about it but it turned out great.

Mmmmmmm, comfort food.  I made this as a side dish for our Valentines Day dinner, and we both loved it.  I may have overcooked the rice just a little (it was more mushy than "al dente").  But it still tasted delicious.  I did double the wine and reduced the broth to give the dish more of the wine's tartness.  I would definitely recommend doing that.  I also cut back on the amount of mushrooms called for, and I used all baby bellas (no white mushrooms).  Fabulous!  :-)

Add 1 tsp of ground turmeric seasoning to give this tasty dish an appetizing golden color without altering the flavor.  I've also added fresh lump crab meat, shrimp and a variety of my favorite mushrooms...delicious!!!

The only bad part was all the stirring, but the recipe was very easy.  I made it about 45 minutes ahead of time and put it in the warming drawer and it held great. I did cut back on the mushrooms because it did seem like alot, however I would  have liked a few more.  Very Tasty.

This was really good, not amazing.  But it was my first time having risotto.  I think it needed more wine or lemon.  I will make it again.

This was okay, and my first attempt at risotto. My husband really didn't care for it and I guess I prefer the cheese risotto I have had in restaurants. Maybe the mushroom flavor was a little too strong, even though I love mushrooms. I might try it again with some other flavors

Really tasty risotto - fairly easy to make although it did take awhile at the stove!!  Too many mushrooms though - I cut them in half and still had way too many for our tastes.

EASILY the best dish I've made from this website thus far! Restaurant quality.My husband isn't easily excited and I believe his words were "wow." Takes a little time and love... but SO worth it. I added extra parm cheese (never can have too much cheese) and I also used baby bella and shitake mushrooms instead of the mushrooms listed. Used garlic infused olive oil and fresh garlic (in addition to the shallots) per the other garlic lovers recommendation. :) SCRUMPTIOUS!

I've never made risotto before. I went cheap on the ingredients, and used only white mushrooms and kraft parmesan, but the next time, I plan on following the recipe exactly.  It was fantastic.  I tasted the risotto towards the end, and thought this was going to be a disaster, but once everything was mixed together, the flavors come out.  Great recipe! **Update**  Made this again last might with freshly grated parmesan.  I added shitake and portebello mushrooms, and tasted incredible!!

Oh my gosh, this dish was amazing! It was exactly what I was craving!  There are a lot of mushrooms in it, so if you're not a huge mushroom fan, I would cut the amount down a little.  I made enough for leftovers for the next few days! yummy!!!

I loved the overall texture but didn't love the intense mushroom flavor. I even decreased the amount by half! Next time will use just white mushrooms.

Soooo Gooood! I love mushrooms and couldn't wait to try this recipe. It's very creamy and has a delightful mushroom flavor. Followed the recipe to the "T". Can't wait to serve it to friends with my favorite marinated flank steak the next time, I'm sure it will be a hit.

I've fixed this recipe several times now and my hubby and I just love it! We were invited on a fancy Star Ship Dinner Cruise last week and he actually ordered an entree' mainly because it was served with risotto. He looked at me after he took a bite and said that I had him spoiled. That my risotto recipe was so much better than what he was served. Of course I've got this website and all the contributor's to thank!

this recipe was sooooo good!  only reason for the 4 stars is that it takes a really really long time to cook, but it's definitely worth it!  i used less mushrooms also b/c it called for a lot of mushrooms.  looks like mush the next day but still tastes really good.

I wasn't happy with the consistency. It ended up a little too thin. I remember seeing risotto made on The Food Network and the chef heated the chicken broth. Maybe that would have helped the consistency. Too, I wasn't super careful about adding 1/2 cup of broth at a time. I'm just trying to think about where I may have messed up. The flavor was darn good, despite being slightly thin. My wife didn't think it was especially good, but she is a somewhat picky eater. This risotto isn't as good as other risotto recipes I've had, but it's still very good.

Oh yummy.  I hate mushrooms, so left them out, but made the recipe as is afterwards.  Soooo good.  I did half it and it only took about 20 mins total, which was fine b/c I was cooking other things at the same time.  I put a "chicken breast w/ balsamic vinegar and garlic" (from this site) over the risotto, spooned the sauce over both, and made some "baked asparagus wih balsamic butter sauce"...  YUMMY!!!!

I may have done something wrong, but I had to cook this FAR longer than the recipe calls for. The end product was okay, but the rest of my meal was cold because I didn't allot for the extra time.

Oh. My. Goodness. Gracious. Me.  This is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth.  I could eat a plateful of this for dinner.  I would stir even longer to have a taste of this delicious dish.  Thank you Myleen. :)  I left out the parm, it was still WOW.

Fantastic!  I recently made this for a dinner party and it stole the show.  I backed off a little on the while mushrooms, but I think they could have all been used in the end.

This recipe never ceases to please. The proportions are just right and the taste is amazing. The first for me was a bit too thick so the second time I didn't add as much parm cheese or butter. It may have also been my timing leaving it on the burner for too long. Either way, it's still the one I turn to for a good mushroom risotto.

MUY BIEN! it took a long time to make (that is longer than im used to) We had it along side baked chicken and while the chicken was in the oven i was working on the rice, they were done at the same time. We all enjoyed it so much even after we were full each of us said we wished we had room for more!

Excellent! I have never eaten or prepared risotto but was super curious to try it. I am hooked for sure now. The creamy texture and rich earthy taste of the mushrooms was heaven. Great recipe.

I've found that this recipe can even be made ahead of time and the flavor is more intense if refrigerated overnight and then warmed in an oven.

As vegetarians, we substituted vegetable or mushroom broth and only used one type of mushroom. Nonetheless, this is easily one of the best risottos we've tasted. It's also quick and easy to make. At least four friends have taken this recipe home the same night they tasted it. 

Kudos!

My first attempt at risotto and, as far as I know, turned out fantastic. My boyfriend really enjoyed it and is waiting for me to make it again. I used all kinds of fancy mushrooms, but I am sure it would have been satisfying with just regular white mushrooms. Gotta pay attention to what your doing, stirring constantly and you can't go wrong. Nice recipe, thanks!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I could not get enough, and even got raves from my 5 year old.  This was my first time making risotto and was surprised to have made a restaurant quality dish.  Followed recipe exactly except substituted one small minced onion for the shallot, fresh parsley for the chives, and added 2 cloves garlic.  I used shitakes and portobellos, total of 1lb.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.  My favorite from this site so far!

I have made this recipe twice now and it always gets finished. I agree that the amount of mushrooms in the original recipe does seem like a bit much... I get away with one container of white mushrooms and 3 medium sized portabellos. I like a little extra chives and a little less shallot as well. But, overall, mmmmmmmmmmm!!! So good!

What an amazing recipe for risotto!  I was reluctant at first as I heard making a risotto dish was very time consuming.  However, once I got going, it wasn't as bad although my wrists were a little sore afterward.  Like a few other reviewers, I doubled the wine and it came out fantastic!  I also added some cut asparagus which is always a treat!

I tried cooking the Mushroom Risotto last night for my partner. I have cooked mushroom rissoto before but this was the first time with this recipe. 

Usually I add the mushroom in with the rice to make them "soggy" and to add the colour and flavour from the mushrooms through the whole risotto but as this recipe called for them to be added at the end this is what I did. I ommited the shallots and chives as I really don't like the texture of these foods in risotto I prefer everything to be soft.

I found that the mushrooms were overpowering in this recipe. I love mushrooms but I thought that there were either to many or that maybe there needed to be a stronger chicken flavour in there.

Pretty dissapointing result considering all of the 5 star reviews. I think I will go back to my old risotto recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong.  The people I served it for loved it, but I couldn't taste the wine...and I doubled the amount used.  I think I will try to make it one more time. Hopefully my review changes.  Sorry.

I didn't have shallots so I added a good amount of onion powder... results still came out as good as it would in a restaurant! Much easier to make than I imagined... and as easy as buying the boxed stuff, but you get to take all the credit! And you know what you're putting in it...

Sooo good.  It may be tedious, but it's most certainly worth it.  Next time I think I'll substitute plain white button mushrooms for the portabellas.  Portabella mushrooms were too expensive.  Not worth it, in my opinion.  Excellent!  Served four people with generous servings and seconds.

This was my first try with risotto, and it turned out great!!  Even with the involved preparation (contant stirring) it was definately worth it!!  Some changes that I made were:  used only button mushrooms, used onions, added a little extra wine and then added frozen peas at the end of cooking.  everyone raved with the exception of the kids (picked out all of the mushrooms).

This was delicious!  I'm currently dieting, but I made it for my husband (so i could sneak a few bites as well!)  About 15 minutes into stirring, I was wondering if it would be worth the hassle... but the creaminess, mushroomieness goodness of it was so worth it!!! thanks for a great recipe.
P.S. Hubby enjoyed it as well, although I don't think he was as carb-starved as I was!

I thought this was ok, this was the first time I've ever had or made risotto, so I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe.  I would not make this again.

Didn't have any chives, so we added dried thyme when we sauteed the mushrooms. It turned out great!

Beautiful Risotto for mushroom lovers!  I didn't have the Arborio rice on hand the first time that I made this so had to use long grain.  It turned out great with both kinds of rice!

Love it! I didn't have white wine so just used a bit extra broth. I also added a touch of heavy cream to give it a good creamy mushroom taste. I served this with the Sweet Mustard Chicken Bake from this site.

We used a little onion instead of shallots, still fine. The mushrooms seemed like a lot at first, but the proportion ended up tasting great!

I did have trouble making the timing work with the other things I was cooking, so I'm definitely going to plan it all thru next time I make this.

I doubled this recipe and followed instructions to a "T". It turned out perfect and my sicillian father in law said it was the best mushroom risotto he's ever tasted. Awesome!!! I've been a huge fan of risotto forever and this one beats any resteraunt recipe.

Excellent risotto! I made it and served it as a main dish. Used portabella mushrooms (about half a pound) and substituted ricotta salata for the butter at the end. Used homemade chicken broth as a base. Will definitely make this again. It was easy!

I have been wanting to try risotto for awhile now. I chose this because i love mushrooms. It was really good. After reading reviews i did use less mush. but only slightly. Being vegetarian i used veg. broth and i did use garlic with the shallots. I like garlic in almost every thing but my cereal. When i was done cooking this i went upstairs for about 20 mins. when i came back down my house smelled wonderfull. Forget about choc. chip cookie smell when trying to sell a house i'll use this Thank you

I will definitely make this again!  Made a few changes (1) used crimini and white mushrooms (2) used Carnaroli rice, (3)omitted the butter at the end (4) used ~40% more broth then called for (5) used less Parmesan cheese.  I'd double the wine if my kids weren't eating also.  I made it for 4 (and that turned out to be a lot of food) in the hope to have lunch leftover, but my 6 year old ate more then 1/3 !!! and so there's nothing left.

Great recipe!  It takes only 20 minutes and the end result was delicious, creamy risotto. For cheese lovers: replace 4 tablespoons of butter with 1/2 cup of shredded asagio cheese.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I changed the recipe.  I only use 3 cups chicken broth, omit the wine, and use a little less than one pound of button mushrooms.  We love this risotto and have made it several times already.

This recipe is a winner.  It makes enough for a fair bit more modest servings than listed, which is fine.  It reheats very well as leftovers.  I mixed in some chopped chicken and sent it with my husband for lunch at work.  He was a very happy guy!  We originally had it as the main side dish with our prime rib for Christmas dinner.  Great choice!  This one is a keeper.

This receipe makes an amazing risotto. SOOOO creamy and rich. When 2 different markets were BOTH out of portobellos!, I decided to substitute 1/2 lb bay scallops and 1/2 lb med. shrimp. I sauteed them in 2 T olive oil and set aside as called for with the mushrooms. The only other tweaking was to use 2 T of butter instead of the 4 and it was still extremely rich. Certainly a keeper and thanks for submitting the recipe!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! It has a lovely, rich flavor to it, and the wine is just enough to really bring out the mushroom flavor. I used diced Portabellos for this and they worked just fine. It may take a little longer than the recipe indicates to add the broth and cream the rice, but it's well worth it. VERY good!

I've never had risotto before, so there's nothing to compare this to, but we just didn't like it. It had a gluey texture, and the mushrooms made it taste dirty. And this is coming from a couple of mushroom freaks!  I wouldn't make this again.

This risotto was the best!! I made it for a big party and it was gone before people could have seconds!! I don't cook often but this was so easy to make (well except the contant stirring) and well worth it. I didn't use all the mushroom it called for either, I just eyed balled it and put in what I thought was good. It was PERFECTO!!!!

This recipe was very good. My family loves risotto and this one is tops. You can also use red wine it gives the rice a purple color. Will make this often.

I agree with previous reviewers that half the mushrooms called for is plenty.  I used 8 oz. white mushrooms and 8 oz. Baby Bella.  This dish was wonderful and really seemed good enough to be served in a restaurant.

I used shitake and enoki mushrooms and Japanese rice, and added 1/2 an onion with the shallots, and added 200g diced shrimp.
It was wonderful.  I'll be getting some tonight, so thanks!

The flavor was very good, but even with the mushrooms cut in half there were waaay too many.  I would use maybe one packet of mushrooms.  I also added chicken which was good.  Will make again with adjustments.

I had Mushroom Risotto at a local restaurant last weekend.  This recipe was even better than that.  I used parsley flakes instead of chives only because I found myself at the end of the recipe and suddenly without chives.  Great recipe.  Will make again and again.

This was great.  I used shiitake mushrooms, and added about 1 1/2 c. shredded imitaition crab.  I love cheese, so we got an extra dose of parmesean added in as well.  Turned this from a side to a main course that resulted in no leftovers with hardly any effort at all.

Made this dish last night and it was pretty easy and very delicious. I used an onion chopper from Bed&Bath to dice the mushrooms and shallots and got nice uniform bits that mixed will with the rice. Also added in a few more spoonfuls of romano cheese at the end for extra cheesiness! This gets high marks for it's taste and texture- my husband hasn't stopped talking about how great dinner was last night!

this risotto is delicious!  i was a bit afraid at first to use 2lb of mushrooms but it turned out to be the perfect balance of rice and mushrooms.  even my bf who is a huge meat eater loved all the mushrooms.  i followed a reviewer's suggestions to use 1cup of white wine and cut down by 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  another suggestion:  use organic chicken stock instead of the cheap kind.  it makes a big difference in taste and better for health (i.e. no MSG)

It was absolutely delicious. I only put the portobello mushrooms in, as I didn't have the other kind on hand, but I think that's as much mushrooms as I would prefer because I am not a big fan of them.

Really fantastic - truly gourmet! I added twice the amount of wine and equivalently less broth, as suggested, very good idea. I also added broccoli about halfway through the broth-pouring, which worked well. Also added 2 cloves of chopped garlic after the first broth-pour. It took me a good deal longer than 20 minutes - maybe 35? So be prepared. I cooked chicken breasts on the side and served on top. Very nice!

With these ingredients whats not to like. If only it wasn't so much work. My guests liked it alot but i thought it came out a bit mushy. Had great flavor though I did add more romano cheese. I thought it neede a bit more flavor. I will try it again to perfect.

I made this for my husband with steak one night, and it was so good!  It's really not too hard to make.  The portabello mushrooms give it such a gourmet appeal.  We saved the leftovers and it was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

This is so delicious.  This took 2 extra cups of broth and about 30 minutes to cook to the consistency I like.  I substituted white onion for the shallots and didn't have any chives.

So, so good.  Everyone loved this.  Changes I made to suit our tastes: made 1-1/2 times the recipe with no problems, used about 10 oz portobello mushrooms, roughly chopped TOTAL.  No additional mushrooms were added and we thought it was plenty.  I added less shallot (my husband doesn't love it) and skipped the chives.  I also added freshly grated parmesan (about a cup)and think it made all the difference in the world. I also used Kithen Basics Chicken Stock (sold in a yellow box in the soup aisle) because I think it's the best available.  Took A LOT of time - especially because I increased the recipe (probably 35 minutes of contstant attention), but I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

This turned out amazing!  I used a touch more wine than called for, and a bit less chicken broth.  I was skeptical about putting all of the mushroom liquid in, but it worked out great!  The only other change made was to use 1/3 c. Locatelli grated Pecorino Romano instead of parmesean.  It tasted wonderful and everyone was asking for more!
