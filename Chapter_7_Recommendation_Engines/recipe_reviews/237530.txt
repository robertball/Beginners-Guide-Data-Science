this recipe was quick and easy and a great blend of flavors. I didn't have chicken broth in the house so I used vegetable broth and it was great. Otherwise I made it as suggested but toasted the almonds before adding them. It was a hit with my husband so I plan to make it again.

This recipe was a real hit at my barbecue. It's a healthy side dish devoid of mayo that can be easily made vegan. The savory mix of sweet and sour and the addition of nuts and seeds as protein make this a keeper.

This recipe is SO delish and simple!  It's my new go-to  recipe for  couscous.  I'm returning back to an office job, after working from home for 9 years and need easy/healthy/quick/tasty meals.  This hits the mark on all points.  Thank you to whoever shared this recipe!

Thought the flavors were be weird for the sauce but they actually weren't bad.  I added walnuts, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds (that I just happened to have on hand).  Cut the couscous down to serving for 2 on back of the box and eyeballed the added ingredients.  Made the correct amt. of sauce that recipe called for, but didn't use all of it.

Too sweet for my palate. The vinaigrette had a nice balance that was lost in the overpowering cranberries.\

My local grocery store deli sells this, and I thought I'd give it a try.  I simplified it some by omitting the broth, nuts, vinegar, and salt the second time around, and it tasted just as good.  I like it enough that I'm making it a third time for a family get-together very soon.
