This is a really great recipe, as a base. I did add a thinly sliced onion and a couple of cloves of minced garlic. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Enjoyed these very much, even though I made without sausage for a side dish with pork. I did need to cook longer than the approx. 10 min. (20 min). Like witchywoman's review, I added garlic. I can't wait to try with the sausage next time!

AKA "Farmer Joe's Dinner" We agreed, this looks like farm food (in all the best ways) It was delicious! I did add about 6 cloves of garlic (I kid you not) and served it over cornmeal mush. We also had red pepper flakes at the table for anyone who wanted them.

I tasted the hot, bitter mustard greens raw and I was doubtful that they would be any better cooked, but the reviews were so positive I gave it a try. I'm glad I did! I had 2 helpings and looking forward to leftovers for lunch. I made it as written, but the can of tomatoes I had were Italian-seasoned. I'll definitely make it again.

This was my first time eating or cooking turnip greens. I listened to other users, and decided to sauté onions and garlic to add to the recipe. I sautéed them on the side in some margarine, along with the stems from the greens. I did not want to throw those away, but know from cooking kale, that the stems take more cooking time. I did not use oil to brown my sausage, as sausage has plenty of fat already in it. When it came time to add the tomatoes and other ingredients, I added my sautéed onion mixture. I also simmered this dish for 30 minutes total, stirring occasionally. It was delicious!

I was searching for a good-sounding and simple recipe to cook some mustard greens from a CSA I joined.  This sounded simple and good, and it was.  Yum!  I used italian turkey sausage & canned diced fire roasted tomatoes with garlic.  Great flavor, and so healthy and delicious!  Will make again, probably many times.

This is fabulous.  I didn't use any oil as the sausage I used had enough fat. I also needed to add some collard greens because I didn't have enough mustard greens.  This is definitely a recipe I will make often.  Thanks.

Fantastic! I used what I had on hand, six spicy pork meatballs instead of sausage cooked in a skillet with 2 tablespoons of evoo. I dumped them into four cups of boiling chicken broth, I also used both black pepper and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. My only other substitution was roasted diced tomatoes. I never cooked with mustard greens before and this soup was really good, I'll feel comfortable cooking with them again. Cool something new! Thank you for this healthy recipe.

This recipe was tasty and enjoyable, and deserves credit just for being a complete meal within itself! I did add about 1/2 cup onions and a pod of garlic to the pork while browning, and a tbs. apple cider vinegar to cut the greens' bitterness.  I will likely make again with some additional amendments to liven it up a bit more :)

This really is awesome!  Had a bunch of greens, and looked at the recipe for ideas of how to prepare them, where even my picky husband would eat them.  He loved it!

Awesome is right! I sautéed chopped onion and fresh, minced garlic before adding the sausage because that's what Southerners do, and I used medium-hot sausage. Everything else was by the book. It had the perfect amount of spice that kept us coming back for more. The wife took the scant leftovers to work for lunch and everyone in her office begged her for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I did 3 cups beef broth and used ground beef instead plus added onions. My family loved it!

Unfortunately I didn't have exactly everything on hand, so I made due with ground turkey and a can of white beans.  I really liked it.  Thanks for the inspiration!  I'm confident that the original recipe would be fantastic too!

delicious...I added a bag of shredded carrots for more veggies in the sautéing portion of the recipe, doubled everything except the greens (did not have a second bag, but had to feed 8 people) and added the onions and garlic like others suggested,  Allowed to simmer in my crockpot for 3 hours on high and served with grandmothers buttermilk cornbread---everyone ate it and most everyone took seconds---delicious

This was an amazingly easy and delicious way to use my abundant mustard greens!! I followed suggestions from others to add garlic and onions, and simmered them with the sausage. I also used fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic, and added Tony Chachere’s creole seasoning instead of plain salt. Because my boyfriend likes a little heat, I also added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes. We both loved it! It’s great with some crusty garlic bread!
