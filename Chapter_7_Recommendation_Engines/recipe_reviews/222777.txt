These were amazing leftover! Normally I don't like burgers leftover- they dry out and lose their flavor. But these kept their mositure and the flavor was great when I reheated one 2 days after I had initially made them. I made these small and served them on sweet Hawaiian rolls and topped them with cheese, tomato, and additional onion (since I love onion).

I made these with lean 85/15ground beef and red onion. The flavor from the onion and green pepper was wonderful. The bread seems to help keep the burgers moist, and it's not too much bread, even when putting the burgers on buns. I had leftovers and when I reheated a for lunch, it was  still very moist and the flavor was even better the next day.

These were really yummy! A really nice variance on the typical burger. I used red onion and the flavor was fantastic. I made these burgers on the grill and topped them with white American cheese. The bread in these burgers helps to keep the moisture in the meat. I'm saving this recipe and will be making them again very soon.

It sounds like the person who gave this recipe one star didn’t even make it—how unfair--nor did he read the description correctly.  The ‘traditional’ to which the contributor is referring, is that they served it with cheese, ketchup and on a bun—like a ‘traditional’ hamburger.  Re Klupskies not being a word (really???), this is what this family called them—much like a nickname—does that mean it can’t be a good recipe? Plus, there are many family variations to most ‘traditional’ recipes –including Kotlety Mielone. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but maybe it will help, so I’m giving 5 stars without making it to help offset a very unfair and pompous review.

My Gramma made these my whole life, but with a few differences.  She used only finely ground pork butts (shoulder) with all the fat trimmed. She grated an onion into the meat, used 4 pieces of dried bread, also grated, added parsley and salt & pepper. She lightly fried them until they browned some, but weren't hard. Then she baked them for about a half hour at 350.  Have made these for all my friends over the years and they've always been a BIG hit.

These burgers were very moist and juicy and the flavor from the green pepper and the onion was fantastic. I grilled these and they turned out perfect- the green peppers and onion cooked perfectly in the meat and gave it a great flavor. I might have to make these instead of regular burgers from now on.

After making thesw twice, they have become the new favorite for my family. The flavor is awesome and they are SO good leftover. I do not like leftover hamburgers, but these keep the flavor and the moisture and I have no problem eating them days later. On a side note, I like these on a potato bun with white american cheese and topped with additional grilled onion.

I couldn't make the all polish version of this so I made a Polish/Mexican version instead. I am on a limited budget and did not have any green pepper, but had all the other ingredients, so I used some jalapenos in an escabeche mixture instead. So I ciselered the jalapeno mixture and WOW, these were AWESOME.

Delicious! I made them on the grill along with skewers of grilled veggies (the onions and bell peppers in the burgers went great with additional grilled vegetables.) I actually think I now prefer them to regular burgers. This recipe is a winner!

Very good! I made them as written, with mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy and my boyfriend and I both loved them!
