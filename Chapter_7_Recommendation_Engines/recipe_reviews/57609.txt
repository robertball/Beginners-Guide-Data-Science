This was awesome!!!  No dry chicken if you add some liquid, my changes:

crush the rosemary; 1 lb sausage, browned; 4 pcs chicken; white wine instead of vermouth; add 1 cup marinara sauce; add 1 (14 oz) can of chicken broth.  I had to double the cornstarch mixture because of the increased liquid.

It was really great, a definate keeper!

I think with some modifications this could be a tasty meal.  It smelled wonderful in the beginning.  I cut the chicken into large chunks and that could be why it cooked in 3-4 hours. The chicken and the ground pork were very dry.  Also the sauce was very bitter with only the vermouth.  I had to add quite a bit of salt and a few big scoops of sugar to lessen the bitterness.  I cook by recipes mostly and am not that great at modifying a base with vermouth only. So, others may know just what this recipe needs.  Linguine was a good pasta for this.

Great comfort food for a cold winter night!!  I used white cooking wine and added a can of Italian style diced tomatoes, which provided more liquid.

My husband and I both thought this was excellent and VERY flavorful.  It does need salt added to the crock pot ingredients before cooking for 5-7 hours.  Also, I used chicken broth instead of the vermouth in the main recipe.  You can make a lot more sauce than the recipe calls for and I think that it really adds to the dish.  I used about 1/4 cup of bisquick (instead of cornstarch) and more chicken broth (instead of water) to make the sauce and it was delicious over the chicken and thin spaghetti I served it with.  You can not go wrong with a low fat/low calorie/low carb meal that tastes this good!

Quite enjoyable: Chicken was a bit dry, but sauce was very tasty.  Carmelized onions & peppers before adding to crock pot.  Also cut breasts in half and  browned chicken and sausage (removed casing) before adding to pot.   Added 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 cup chicken stock, sliced mushrooms to crock pot.  Doubled spices and cornstarch.  Served over tortiglioni with a Pinot Grigio.

I needed a recipe to feed a group of people that I had invited over from church and I needed something easy because I work two jobs.  This crockpot recipe looked ideal.  I did all the work the night before and then just put the crockpot on in the morning.  I served this with Italian Green beans, corn pudding, a mandarin orange spinach salad and a fruit truffle.  There wasn't one piece of food left and several asked for the recipe.  It was WONDERFUL

This was a great recipe!  We had an Italian themed night and I really wanted to stay away from serving pasta.  Everyone at the table liked it, especially the suace.  Keep in mind when you remove the chicken, prior to making the sauce, that the vegetables, sausage, and chicken will have "bonded" together.  I didn't quite get that from the recipe and the first piece I took out was a little messy.  Think of it as stuffed chicken breasts with the stuffing on the outside!

I made this for today's Sunday dinner as a last minute decision.  It was a great decision!  Last night plans were made for my daughter and parents to come over for dinner today.  So, this morning as the pineapple upside down cake was in the oven I had to figure out what I could make.  I did add a can of diced, Italian style tomatoes as others suggested, as well as fresh sliced mushrooms.  I also did not have Italian sausage, but used Chorizo sausage instead.  We used rotini pasta as that is all I had.  This was very good.  I did cook mine on high for 5 hours and my chicken was not dry at all.  I will be making this again!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  A combination of two of my favorite meats, lots of flavor and punch.  A new favorite.  I would not change a thing in this!  My husband (who is not crazy for chicken) went wild when he tasted it, he loves this recipe too!

This was great. I served it to company and they could not say enough about how much they liked it. I used white wine and a can of diced tomatoes as other suggested. I also cut up the chicken into bite size peices. Served over pasta.

My whole family loved this meal, and we have two very picky eaters.  Because when I went to the liquor store I couldn't remember if I needed dry vermouth or sweet vermouth, I ended up buying sweet vermouth on the clerk's recommendation. He said dry vermouth will dry out a recipe, but sweet vermouth will make it moist. It certainly worked! Awesome meal.

Yummy and easy!  I added sauteed fresh mushrooms before thickening the sauce.  I also added a half can of chicken broth when cooking to make sure chicken and sausage were not dry.

This was a good recipe - my family enjoyed it, but it probably won't make it into the weekly rotation.  Between the chicken and sausage, it was a TON of food for 2 adults/3 children, even though I halved the recipe.  But I'll probably put it on my list of things to make every couple months since it was easy enough and a new way to make chicken (and get some good red peppers into everyone's tummy!)

I sustituted dry white wine for the vermouth, and I doubled the amount to half a cup.  My family likes alot of seasoning, so I also used twice as much rosemary and oregano.  I served over whole wheat pasta with some romano cheese on top.  It was excellent. The chicken was moist, the sausage added alot of flavor, and the left overs were even better.

This is really excellent. Chicken normally tastes very bland from the crock pot, but this is very tasty. I served this with penne pasta. I cooked an entire box of pasta, drained, then added 3 TBS olive oil, 1 C parmesan cheese, rosemary & oregano, and just a touch of garlic salt. The pasta complimented the chicken dish perfectly. Even my 1 year old gobbled up this dish. Give it a try!

This recipe was awesome!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I had to double the amount of all the spices.  I'm from the south and have learned if you want your food to have flavor, when you follow a recipe you HAVE to increase the amount of spices called for.  Other than that it was delicious.  I saw some people served it with pasta.  I served it with rice which seemed to soak the sauce up better than pasta would have.

I always make the recipe as written to start.  With that said I found this a little lacking so I tweaked it a little.  Used bone-in chicken the browned it and the sausage first (sun dried-chicken sausage).  Carmelized the onions and peppers and then placed in cooker with one small can diced tomatoes with oregano and rosemary. Substituted one can of chicken stock for the vermouth and added small button mushrooms for the last two hours.  Only took 5 hours on low to be fall off the bone delicious.

Not bad, but not so good either. It lacked flavor and the chicken was a little dry (and we'd used thighs). Next time I'd add a can of diced tomato (as I now see others suggested) and use chicken broth instead of vermouth. I'd add more veggies, too - more pepper, maybe some banana peppers, and probably some mushrooms.  I would double the oregano, add more rosemary, and put the salt in earlier in the process.

This was outstanding!
I did make a few changes to use what I had on hand. I used Chirizo Sausage instead of Turkey and browned it before adding it to the slow cooker. I used Red Wine instead of Vermouth, fresh Rosemary instead of dried, only one clove of garlic and added 2 tablespoons of Tomato Paste. I cut the chicken up into chunky pieces so it only took about 5 hours to cook on Low. Very yummy!!!

Pretty good.  I added a lot more liquid using chicken broth instead of vermouth and it kept the chicken moist.  As a result, though I didn't really get a gravy, so I served over rice.  It was still pretty good.  Very easy, too; I loved that I could put it in the slow cooker in the morning and have a good meal at dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful after a day outside in the cold...the layers I used were onions on the bottem, then broccoli and mushrooms...used the recommendations of 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup chicken stock...spiced it up...and put frozen chicken thighs on top...cooked 5 hours on high...browned the chicken while making the sauce.  Served it all on Rotini...wonderful.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe as it was way too easy.  My husband absolutely loved this, but he did add some jarred mushrooms to his serving. I thought it was pretty tasty, especially given the effort and that this recipe did not include a can of cream soup or a pkg of dried onion soup. I would probably add additional veggies, maybe potatoes, so as not to require preparing additional side dishes.

This is good, but with modifications. After reading other reviews I added more liquid, specifically: 1/2 cup of white wine, 1/2 cup pasta sauce, 1/2 chicken broth. I think the flavor of the sauce was really good with all the herbs. But I cooked the chicken for only 3 hours on low and it was dry! Bottom line, it's a decent recipe and we'll eat the leftovers, but it's not going to be put in my regular recipe rotation.

This dish has a great overall flavor.  However, the suce didn't thicken up as I would have liked and the sausage proved problematic as it cooked into a solid mass.

Flavor of the sauce is very good, however I agree the chicken seems too dry and not enough sauce, in future I will double sauce and use bone-in chicken ---just remove skin

Delicious!!! Works great for busy weeknights if you put it on early a.m. or the night before..mine took about an hour longer to cook, but the chicken was so tender it fell apart-no knife needed at all. We have a new family favorite! Thanks!

Excellent! Used suggestions to add 1/2 c sauce and 1/2 c red wine and also removed sausage from casing and pan cooked before adding to slow cooker. I used a whole chicken vs. breasts which made the sauce a little thin so I added more cornstarch. The chicken came out sooo good.  Served with angel hair pasta and good crusty bread. Everyone loved it and I have been asked for the recipe several times.  Has become a staple meal on my menu list.

My husband loved this dish.  I also liked it though I'm not as much of a meat eater.  I smelled wonderful as it was cooking and made a lovely dinner.  I had no problems with dryness.

This was flavorful and easy to toss in the crockpot. I used sweet  
Italian turkey sausage, white wine and added chopped tomatoes. I served it over linguine and my finicky sausage hater even admitted it was better than she expected. I combined the leftover pasta and 
chicken and stored in the fridge for a day and it was even better. Thanks, I will make this again.

My whole family loved this recipe. The only change that I made was to use white wine instead of the vermouth - which is a bit strong. Doubling this recipe would be a plus for the future - more leftovers!

My whole family liked this recipe.  The kids didn't care for the whole pieces of rosemary, so next time I will crush it with a mortar and pestle.   I changed it a little.  I added a can of artichoke hearts with vegetables, and poured a can of chicken broth ove the chicken.  I also added salt as someone else suggested.  It was good served over pasta, I think it would be good over rice too.

This was very tasty, but the chicken was dry after 5 1/2 hours.  I shredded it as someone had suggested, and returned it to the sauce.  Made it much better.  I did add the 1/2 cup marinara sauce and some wine.  I browned the sausage first - I think that makes it taste better.  I deglazed the pan with the wine and added it to the pot.  I will make this again with less chicken and less time.

Followed other suggestions and added 1/4 tsp salt and a small jar of tomato sauce.  I also browned the sausage and chicken before adding to the crockpot.  We really enjoyed this served over linguine.  My husband thought it might be even better with hot italian sausage (I used sweet) but the kids and I loved it as it was.  Definitely will make this again!

Yum!  I was a little apprehensive at first, but I followed some of the other suggestions (I used red wine instead of dry vermouth and I added a little tomato sauce) and it turned out wonderfully.  I did have to add a little more corn starch to thicken the sauce up.  Overall, it was very good.  My friends gave it rave reviews and some said they were even going to start checking out this website!

This is an excellent dish.  We followed the recipe, but also took others' advice by adding 1/4 teaspoon salt and a small can of tomato sauce.  We didn't use red wine or vermouth at all; instead we used apple juice.  We did cut up the chicken right away, and we think this helped it cook more evenly and retain the juices.  We LOVED it!

I read some of the other reviews and added about a cup of white wine and a can of chopped tomatoes.  I was short on time so I cooked it on high for 3 hours. Came out fine. Had fresh rosemary so I used two teaspoons of that.  It could have used one more.  Also increased the garlic, as you can never have too much garlic.  I would make it again.

I added a cup of chicken broth and I substituted the vermouth for white wine. The extra liquid made my chicken extremely juicy and tender. I did have to add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce after. In the end this dish was delicious, though in need of some more creative seasoning. You’ll have to play around with those to suit your own taste.

This was great. Used boneless thighs instead of breasts. Will definitely make it again.

Delicious!  I followed a suggestion from a previous review, and spread a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes on top of the chicken.  Didn't have vermouth on hand - so used white wine.  Using a stove-top to oven dish with a lid, I first browned the sausage and set it aside.  Then I sautéed the veggies for 8 -10 minutes.  I spread the browned sausage over the veggies; put 4 large, boneless/skinless chicken breast halves on top, and added the tomatoes.   And instead of using the crock pot, I simply baked, covered, for one hour in a 350 degree oven.

I did change some, had to get the peppers out, used diced canned tomatoes and will make again. While there was 20 minutes left I added cooked pasta and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Delicious

We fixed it as recipe directed except we used fresh rosemary out of garden. This is an extremely tasty and nutritious dish. Good blend of protein, fat and carbs. We served over brown jasmine rice. We figured 1/8th serving is about a cup of finished dish. We let it cook till we could easily shred the chicken with a fork while still in the slow cooker. The corn starch thickener was just the right amount.

I think this recipe is a little bland.  I used white wine instead of vermouth and I added a can of stewed tomatoes.  I think it needed chicken stock or broth, some crushed red pepper and more garlic as well as salt.

I followed the recipe, chicken wasn't too dry, dry enough though but it was the gravy that spoiled the looks of the dish, uncongealed comes to mind, and something just missing to make this recipe stand out.

Very good, added tomato paste and made the sauce with bisquick and chicken broth (per other reviews).  Will make more sauce next time to cover all the noodles.  I liked very much, husband and son aren't big chicken fans but they ate it, so I guess that means it was really good.

EXCELLENT! Used what I had on hand..changed to red wine instead of vermouth and used regular Italian sausage instead of turkey sausage.  A definite winner and I'll be serving it to company real soon.  Thx.
