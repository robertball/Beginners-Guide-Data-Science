This sounded so weird I had to try it.  But I did not care for it at all - sorry!  Some odd combinations just plain don't work.

Other than adding sugar products, there was nothing else to make this a great baked bean dish.  I made recipe as written and followed the directions.  The marshmallows probably should have been added at the end and broiled for a bit.  As written, they completely melted into a puddle on top of the beans.

I wouldn't say it was awful but it wasn't wonderful either. I enjoy trying new things & that was why I tried this. I followed the recipe as is & it was ok. I'd make it again for a larger crowd just to get more opinions.
