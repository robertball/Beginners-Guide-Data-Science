Super delicious, and super interesting to make. I loved warming  and reducing the milk on the stove. I also used La Lechera brand condensed milk since I had that on hand. Since it's super sweet, I reduced the sugar by half. (Final product was still super sweet.) It was very cook using the immersion blender to mix the soak and sopped bread in the milk. I did not deep fry the bread slices in oil, more like toasted them on a stovetop grill with the tiniest bit of oil. This baked well, and all of the liquid was absorbed into the bread. We enjoyed this very much. I probably won't make it again because it's extremely sweet, but it definitely deserves 5 stars. If you're not familiar w/ Indian bread pudding, take a look at photos online because it will be hard to imagine how it's supposed to look and be dished up. Thanks for the recipe!
