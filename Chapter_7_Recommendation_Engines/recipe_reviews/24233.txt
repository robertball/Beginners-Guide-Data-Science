This was a really great dip!  I did change it a little...  I added the shrimp first, and then used the beater.  I didn't like the idea of having whole shrimp in the dip.  It turned out well.

I didn't check my lemon juice first.  It was VERY strong and made this dip a little too tangy. I suggest using less lemon juice and taste it first,you can always add more if necessary. Other wise it is very good.

Can also substitute canned crab meat for the shrimp which makes it yummy too.
My suggestion, to make it a touch less messy, is I spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of a decorative pan and then put the cocktail sauce on top. It makes it easier for guests to spread and doesnt ruin your "Creation" like when you put it in the ball form.
Wonderful recipe, good one to share.

I have a difficult time following a recipe, I always have to alter it in some way or another. It's the day before Thanksgiving, and I'm making all those last minute things. One thing that has always been on our table every Thanksgiving has been celery stuffed with cream cheese. Now that "I've" been the one cooking the holiday dinners the past few years, I'm final able to spice things up a bit, hahaha. I substituted a 6oz can of fancy lump crabmeat for the shrimp, added 2 TBSP of fresh chopped parsley, and added a tsp of Emeril Lagasse's essence spice (you don't have to buy it, I got the recipe last year when I made his cranberry glazed Turkey breast). I used all the other ingredients such as the lemon juice and hot sauce. I think it tastes fantastic. Not sure if anyone else will like it tomorrow or not, but I do, haha. It has a slight 'kick' to it, not overwhelming at all.

I too spread this in a flat dish. After I add the cocktail sauce, I top it with grated havarti cheese (or monterey jack/parmeasan/mozza). Sometimes I sprinkle it with some finely chopped fresh dill. Everyone LOVES it!

very simple, very tasty, very affordable.  I use only one 8 oz package of cream cheese to one 4 oz can of tiny shrimp.  Mush together with a fork and squirt in the lemon juice.  I didn't do the hot sauce (kids party) or green onion (didn't have it).

Reminds me of an easy appetizer I made for college boyfriend.  Spread the cream cheese mixture on serving dish, cover with cocktail sauce then sprinkling drained crab meat over top. Easy and delicious with Triscuits.

This was just ok.  I probably won't make again.  It did taste better the second day.

I have used this basic recipe for years but I change the way I serve it, I soften the cream cheese and spread it out on a pretty plate, then chill it for a while, after it has firmed up I spread the cocktail sauce over the top and sprinkle on plenty of shrimp,, serve with club crackers, everyone loves it this way, no having to plow through a big ball or block of cream cheese

This is similar to a recipe a chef I worked with compiled by adding cocktail sauce to cream cheese, whipping it and piping it and then nestling whole shrimp into it.  He called it Shrimp St. Joseph (using his middle name)  and people who ordered it thought is was some fabulous French recipe, but that is really all it was.

This turned out very well for me. I added finely chopped celery and used chive instead of green onions, but it is delicious served with tortilla chips and crackers.

I've been making this for years, using shrimp or crabmeat.  If I use shrimp, I put it in the food processor with the creamed cheese.

I had to use what I had on hand and it turned out wonderful! Substituted lime juice for the lemon, Yakiniku sauce for the hot sauce, and frozen shrimp (chopped) for the canned. I added Old Bay and Morton Nature's Season to taste. I halved mini sweet peppers and spread the mixture onto the peppers. A great appetizer for any occasion.

Very tasty, but could have used a bit more heat and acid. Not much to change. #MyAllrecipes #AllrecipesAllstars #AllrecipesFaceless

I give it about 2 stars.  Thought it tasted awful.  Followed recipe exactly.  Ugh!
