This was good even with frozen berries.  Some reviewers found the filling too runny so I thawed and drained the berries first, and also added 2 T of cornstarch to the sugar/flour mix (and increased the sugar to 1 cup per other reviewers).  The pie was not runny at all.  After it cooled, I could slice it into neat wedges without the filling spilling out the edges.  The pie was a little on the skimpy side--I'd use more berries than the recipe calls for if using frozen berries.  Also, don't be afraid to adjust the ratio of the two berries; I used equal parts of both berries and it wasn't too tart.  The crust wasn't bad but it wasn't terrific.  If you already have a good crust recipe, I'd stick with it.

this was so simple i couldn't believe it- it took all of 10 minutes to make- (mind you i used a ready made crust)- however, i followed the suggestions and used 1 cup of sugar and 1 tbsp of cornstarch- the cornstarch was a great idea but the extra sugar?-uhuh it was far too sweet- next time i will stick with the original recipe- but remember cooks: i think it depends A LOT upon the very fruit YOU are using- taste your blackberries - if they are really sour, then for sure use 1 cup of sugar- if they are not so sour and your blueberries are very sweet (like in my case), only use 3/4 cup of sugar- that's my suggestion!

I made four of these pies to take to the cottage recently, and they were simply amazing.  Our guests couldn't get enough!  We served each slice warmed with a big scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream.  This was just a sensational dessert.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It will be made often.  (I used both frozen blackberries and blueberries as fresh were not available at the time.)  They were perfect!

I modified, too, by adding 1/3 cup white sugar, a pinch of salt and 1 TBS cornstarch and omitting the butter patting (it only adds fat).  I used straight from the freezer frozen marion blackberries (16+oz) and wild maine bluberries (12oz).  I also used a frozen Marie Callender's double-crust.  It turned into the most delectable deep-dish B&B Berry Pie ever!

This recipe is amazing! I agree in adding cornstarch. I have a variation of this recipe.  When cutting slits in the top, make an X and peel back the middle. When the pie is right out of the oven, pour a little heavy cream into the middle. YUM!!

This was an excellent pie.  The filling was a little thick for my tastes, so next I would use less flour in the filling.  To add a bit more flavor I would also add more lemon juice.  But definitely an easy to make pie.

Made this pie today and it was excellent. Only change I made was that I substituted Splenda for the white sugar, and it came out perfectly. My husband has had two pieces already!

I was a little nervous because I had to use frozen blueberries, but even so this was wonderful.  I did add two Tablespoons of cornstarch after reading other reviews but other than that I didn't change a thing.  Excellent!

My, oh my, I do love pie, and I especially enjoyed this one!  I used 2 pkgs of frozen mixed berries, swapped out an equal amount of cornstarch for the flour as cornstarch has more thickening power, added a couple of grates of nutmeg across my nutmeg grater. Used an eggwash on the crush sprinkled with sugar.   This is now one of my signature summer pies.

I used 6 cups of Blueberries (couldn't find Blackberries at the time), and I had a nice filled pie.  I did use 1T of Cornstarch, but will add extra flour next time because the pie was runny.  Also, next time I will cut down on the Lemon Juice (it took away from the sweetness of the berries).  But for a 1st time fruit pie baker - I was very please with this recipe. The pie and crust got great reviews !!!!

This was very good.  I had to use raspberries instead of black berries and it turned out to be a wonderful choice.  Will definately do again.

I live in the Northwest where large wild blackberries are everywhere.  I switched the blackberry amount with the blueberry amount to make it mostly blackberries.  The touch of cinnamon was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed this pie.

The flavor in this pie was great.  The only problem was with the blackberries; thye have tiny little, irritating seeds.  Overall, though, it was quite good.

This was fantastic.  The tartness of the blackberries give this pie an exceptionally delicious flavor.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and about  1 tsp. of cornstarch to the berry mixture, per the recommendations of past reviewers.

First pie that I ever made by myself.  I took a short cut and used the pre made pie shell crusts from Pillsbury.  I just rolled them out a littlle thinner thanm they come.  The berries were expensive this time of year, but what a pie.  Served hot with a scoop of Ben and Jerry's Vanilla.

Yummy.

This was the first time I have ever made a pie with a fruit filling.  I also used my own crust recipe. It came out AWSOME and was very very easy!  I forgot to add the lemon juice and the butter, but everyone loved it!  The pie lasted all of a half an hour in the house!  I highly recommend this recipe!

I have been making this pie for 6 years.  Can't beleive I haven't written a review before now!  I am a lazy cook and use refrigerated pie crusts.  If I use fresh berries I follow the recipe as stated, but if I use  a combination of fresh and frozen berries I increase the flour to 1/2 cup. If I use all frozen berries I use 1/2 cup plus and extra tablespoon. Everone loves this pie!!

Absolutely awesome!!!  This is the best pie I have ever made.  I did modify - used Pillsbury premade pie crust and used 2 1/4 c blueberries and 2 1/4 c blackberries and 1 cup of sugar.  It was just perfect with just the right amount of sweetness.  The next day, I didn't have any pie crusts so I made the filling in a casserole, baked for 30 minutes and then served over ice cream.  HEAVEN!!!

I made this pie as directed but cheated and used Betty Crocker pie crust mix.I used all fresh frozen fruit from last summer.My blueberries were sweet and the biggest berries I ever seen (like small grapes!) My blackberries were a bit tart. It made for a good combination. I might add a bit more sugar next time. I always sprinkle sugar and cinnamon mixed together on top of all my fruit pies.Yum! Thanks Debbie foe sharing!

Really good!!  I took previous reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 cup sugar and 1 Tbsp. cornstarch.  The cornstarch helped with the runniness.  The pie was almost too sweet, but perhaps that was because the fruit was so ripe, not sour at all.  I also added only 1 Tbsp. of butter instead of two.  I used Pillsbury ready-made crusts - they taste nearly like home-made and save a lot of time.  I also used the  Cool Whip and it finished the pie off perfectly.  I think next time I will increase the blackberries and decrease the blueberries - the blackberries were not very noticeable.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good--I've made other blue-black pies that weren't as good but I did add 1 full cup of sugar.  I also made this with frozen berries but it was still very good.

I'm giving this three stars because of the amount of juice from the berries.  I am not sure how to reduce this as I used frozen berries, thawed them and drained them before I put them in the pie.  My crusts didn't even stay together long enough to put it in the oven.  The juice took over and separated them before I could finish my decorative crust.

NOTE!  I also added 3 TBS of corn starch.  I've never had to use a turkey baster to reduce the amount of juice in a pie - this was a first for that!  

I'm thinking that the frozen berries were at fault here.  Had I used fresh, this may not have happened.

This pie turned out perfectly!!!  This was my first attempt at a fruit pie and even my mother (who is the family expert on them) was impressed.  I used the Pillsbury refrigerated crust and made the lattice top - tasty, pretty and easy!

Excellent and very easy.  I used frozen berries, slightly drained.  I also added the 2T cornstarch per other recommendations.  The pie was slightly runny when it came out of the oven but it firmed up once completely cooled - I think I will wait to slice it next time until it is cooled.  I cheated and used the Pillsbury refrigerated crusts and covered the edges with foil after the first 20 minutes of cooking.
2nd time around:  Filling still came out great - a litle runny, but I did not drain or defrost the frozen berries, although I did add 3T cornstarch.  The crust came out terrible - much too soggy - I cheated and used the prepared pillsbury crusts.  May attempt from scratch next time.

One of the best pies I've ever tasted.  And I took the easy way out.  I used refrigerated pie dough, a bag of frozen blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.  And I topped it with a simple, butter, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon crumble.  Served it with vanilla flavored whipped cream.  It really tasted unbelievable.  Had to cook it a little longer due to the frozen berries, but with your nice trick with the foil on the edges it was no problem.  I'll make this over and over again.  Can't wait to try it with fresh ingredients!

I substitued the blueberries for Huckleberries and, when you are from the Northwest, it is the best of both worlds at the end of the summer. It turned out delicious. I added 1/4 cup tapioca (as I do to all my berry pies) and it was thick and juicy.

I used only blueberries, and it turned out great! Its amazing how easy it is, yet so yummy! It almost makes me feel guilty when everyone rants and raves about it, cuz I barely did anything! By the way, I use pillsbury dough pie crust, its really good.

So easy and so good.  I use frozen blackberries,rasberries and blueberries and a frozen crust.  Only thing I change is I add 1tsp of cornstarch to thicken. Wonderful!!

WOW!  I made three pies for Christmas dinner. This was by far the favorite.  I used the "pie crust" by Brenda that I found on this site and sprinkled a little white sugar and cinnamon on the top...It was wonderful!!! Many raves. I used the 2 tbs of cornstarch that was recommended by other reviewers. Other than the cornstarch I would not change a thing ! I think this will be a new tradition ;) Thank you Debbie

Great pie!  I used refrigerated pie crusts for simplicity.  I used fresh blueberries (2 pints) and frozen blackberries, increased sugar to one cup, and added 1 tsp. cornstarch.  It was runny, so next time I'll increase cornstarch to 1 tablespoon.

This pie is very good the only suggestion I would make is to add some tapioca to give it some thickness.  I don't mind some juice but I think this had a bit to much.

I tried this recipe using my own pie crust recipe. I used 3 1/2 c. blackberries and 2 c. blueberries and added about 1 1/4 c. sugar, as the blackberries needed more than the blueberries do. I also added about 1 tbsp. of quick cooking tapioca. The filling was not too runny or too thick; just about right. Instead of baking it for the entire time in the oven, I baked it at about 80% power in the microwave for 10 min. first, while the oven was heating, then finished it for 10-12 min. at 425 degrees in the oven. This prevents the crust from browning too much. The microwave baking time equals about the same as 30 min. in the oven for 10 min. in the microwave. I've done this with other fruit pies in the past, and it saves heating up the kitchen too much also.

The flavor was good, the crust was good, the only thing I should have done was thaw out the frozen berries before using them--it turned out too runny even adding a TBS. of cornstarch in addition to the flour.  But, that was my fault, otherwise, excellent!

I've been making this pie for several years now and have always enjoyed it.  We will use fresh berries and adjust the ratio depending on what's available.  Use Arrowroot and the pie will not be runny, it is an acid stabile starch.  These pies also freeze well, we will make 6 or so every summer and store in the deep freezer.

Thank you for this great recipe! I just baked this pie today. I used a store bought crust, omitted the butter and added 1 Tbsp. corn startch as recommended by other reviewers. I made an egg wash of: egg white, a small amount of yolk and a small amount of cold water - beat it until slightly frothy then brush on top of the pie. I also sprinkled some sugar over top of the wash. When the pie was in 20 minutes, the edges were already golden brown so I covered them with foil. There was some filling seepage but the pie was still so pretty that I had to take a picture and upload. 
I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Absolutely fabulous pie! I have never made pie crust from scratch. It was challenging, but fun! I had some tears in the top crust where the juice seeped through, and because of this my pie was pretty ugly (see pic). But regardless of looks, it was really good. My boyfriends mom couldn't stop raving.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a WINNER! My husband has a new favorite now, and my neighbors actually didn't believe that I made it myself!

I added a bit of nutmeg, left out the butter, and totally forgot the lemon juice (oops), and it was 
STILL a major hit. Can't wait to do it right next time!
Thanks!

The only reason I think that there has not been any ratings before me...is people
just aren't lucky enough to have both fresh blueberries and blackberries....
I made this pie and home vanilla ice cream for Father's Day...and my Dad and family
are still talking about it...and My husband is not a very berry guy!!!

Thanks So Much For Sharing the Recipe...
A For Sure Keeper!  Julie

I followed the recipe, but also took note of some other reviews, adding 2 tbsp. corn starch, increasing sugar to 1 C, increasing the number of berries (4 C fresh black, 2 1/2 C thawed blue), and adding lemon zest and juice.  I also took out the butter and brushed the top with beaten egg (instead of milk) and sprinkled with sugar.

This turned out perfect with a couple of alterations. I have made many berry pies now and found that all turn out a little runny unless I cook down the berries whether fresh or frozen. Here's how I did this recipe: Added berries to pan on medium heat with sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom (depth of flavor) and added 2 tsp. water to 2 tsp. cornstarch or flour. This step thickens the berries and prevents too much juice. I waited for the berry mix to cool then and added it to the pie crust to bake. It made the perfect pie! Will make again.

I liked the base of this pie but I decided to make it more of a mixed berry pie and used blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries. I stuck with my usual crust recipe (per other reviews) and used cookie cutters to make a decorative crust (this one, for Christmas)

Very good, can use some improvement with the crust and filling. Might want to consider a dash more cinnamon and cardomom in the filling.

This recipe is great-- the pie is not too sweet, and a nice combination of flavors with the berries.  I used my mother-in-law's easy pie crust recipe and with this filling, it turned out just great.  Thanks for this one.

I used a pre-made pie crust, didn't have enough blueberries so supplemented with blackberries and added about a tablespoon of cornstarch.  The pie was good though I'll probably try a different berry pie recipe next time.

This recipe is so good that it actually inspired me to become a member so that I could review it!  I used a cheater crust, so I can't review that, but the filling was phenominal.  I did add the cornstarch (3 TBS) so the filling wouldn't be too runny, but other than that didn't change a thing!  We had six people over for lunch and ended with one tiny sliver of pie left.  Two people actually went back for seconds!  Thanks for sharing!

this was good, but if you are looking to please a blueberry pie lover don't make this pie.  My b/f wanted a blueberry pie and I thought I would spice it up with this recipe.  He was disappointed - I think mainly because of the seeds in the blackberries.  Or maybe just because it didnt taste like blueberry pie.

Delicious! 
This was my first attempt at making a pie crust from scratch, and I had a heck of a time keeping the crust in one piece, but appearances aside, this was a wonderful pie. 
As I have access to both blueberry and blackberry bushes via boyfriend, I'll surely be making this one again!

This was perfect!! I switched the amount of blueberries with blackberries and vice versa and added 1/4c more sugar as the wild blackberries I had were a little tart.  This was my first berry pie I made from scratch and it came out absolutely wonderful.  Thank you!

This pie was a wonderful use for the last of the blueberries and blackberries I picked this summer.  I didn't change a thing except I used a Pillsbury pie crust.  Excellent! I can't wait to use fresh berries this summer.

I used this filling recipe with a pre-made crust because I was in a hurry and I used 2 full cups of blackberries to make a fuller pie.  It was wonderful! I read the reviews first and I used a full cup of sugar and added 1 Tbs. of Corn Starch.  I wish I would have added 2 Tbs. of Starch because it was still a little more juicy than I would have liked. My husband told me not to mess it up and change it too much because it tasted fantastic.  Hope this helps someone else. :)

Delicious - the blueberries and blackberries together is different and flavorful.  I used a pre-made pie crust and made a simple crumb topping instead of topping with more pie crust.  Also I used frozen blueberries and blackberries since they weren't in season.  It turned out great.

I increased the proportion of blackberries and also added some raspberries, just because of personal preference.  Totally forgot the cornstarch.  When first cut, it was runny--but it set up nicely overnight.  Fruit desserts aren't ordinarily my children's first choice, but they all said this one was "awesome!"

Delicious recipe that everyone in my family loved. I did not end up using the crust part of this recipe, however, the filling was fabulous. I used frozen berries that we had previously frozen. Thawing them under warm water, I dried them with a towel before putting them in with the rest of the filling. Excellent flavor. I think I would use a little less sugar next time just to match my tastes. I also think we would use just blueberries and maybe try other types of berries too.

Absolutely the yummiest! Used already prepared pie crust (Pillsbury) (because no matter how hard I try to make my own crust, it just turns out awful!). Anyway, I used about a 1/4 cup flour, and instead of cornstarch that I saw a lot of cooks used to firm it up, I used tapioca: 1/4 cup as recommended on the box back for a plain blueberry pie, & it wasnt' runny at all. And I used the full 1 cup sugar--the blueberries around here are kind of sour this year.

This pie is scrumptious! The combo of berries is so good! I am a I am not such a great baker, but this recipe was easy enough that it came out great! I took others advice and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I will make this over and over!

This pie was just okay.  It had nice flavor, but the crust could have been flakier and, as another reviewer mentioned, it became a bit mushy - did not hold up well for left overs.

Didn't care for it at all. I ended up adding an extra 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and it didn't do anything but leave a powdery taste on the blueberries. Not to mention after 45 minutes of baking the crust came out slightly uncooked and the blackberries had liquified. My first slice was a few hours after it had cooked and it still tasted good (Would've actually rated this a 3 had I not been too lazy to post here until morning ) even though it was really runny but after letting it sit overnight the bottom crust became unbelievably mushy and I started to taste the cornstarch.

I wish I could give it 3.5 but it's not an option. I used a different crust recipe so I can't judge that, but as for the filling, it was much to runny! I brought this too a bbq and some said it tasted like the cinnamon overpowered the fruit.

delicious! Made my subsitutions.  I used a frozen blueberry, blackberry, raspberry mix, and then added some fresh strawberries.  I used splenda and also added some cornstarch via other users.  Also added some extra cinnamon because I love it.  I also used the French Pastry pie crust recipe on this site, which was wonderful.  very flaky and suited the pie.  will definitely make this pie again!

Absolutely wonderful! Everyone who has tried this loves it! I did make a few modifications:
- I used two packages of frozen berries (one three berry and one raspberry)
- I used a different crust recipe
- I added 3T of cornstarch and a bit more sugar to the filling.

This pie was very good. I must say, I did have to leave out the butter because I was making it for a vegan family, and I used a frozen mix of blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. Next time I will use Martha Stewarts pastry recipe, I do not like to use shortening due to the hydrogenated oil. If I need to use frozen berries I will either thaw them first and pour off some of the juice or use 3T of cornstarch, like others suggested.

Wonderful pie!!!  My husband can't stop eating it. :)
I used 2C blue, 2C black, and 2C rasberries.  I also added 2T cornstarch since the blackberries and rasberries were frozen.  The pie was still just a little bit runny, so i might use another tablespoon of cornstarch next time.  And i guarantee, there will be many next times!  Yummy!!!!

Delicious, and makes a beautiful presentation. I used fresh berries and it came out wonderfully. This was the first time I tried a lattice pie crust as well, which was also surprisingly easy and helped make this pie look professional! It was a big hit, I would recommend it for any summer get together.

This was good.  I used fresh berries- about 2 1/4 cups blackberries and 3 cups blueberries.  I also added nutmeg and just used the pre-made Pillsbury crust, which saved a ton of time.  A good summertime dessert!

It is an excellent recipe, together with butter flaky crust recipe it makes a delicious pie.  My husband does not get tired of it and would eat it as fast as I could make it.

Made 2 of these last night. I used a package pie dough mix. I added more blackberries than blueberries(frozen). I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg. I added a 1/4 cup more of sugar because  thought the blackberries would be tart. But it turned out to sweet. Next time will go with original recipe. Great pie.

I read all of the rave reviews for this pie, and had to try it myself! I subsituted frozen readimade whole wheat piecrusts from the healthfood store, used raw sugar(added an extra 1/3 cup), halved the butter pats, used 3 1/2 cups blackberries, and 2 cups blueberries...WOW what a wonderful pie! my husband liked it better than the desserts from the local french pastry chef.

I tweaked this a little just because I had canned filling on hand, and it was still very good. I forgot to add the lemon juice, and next time i'll add it for sure to give the filling a little kick, since my canned stuff was a little sweet.

I made this pie as well as the "Pilgrim Pumpkin Pie" from this website for Turkey Day. It was a delicious pie.  All of the guests at dinner raved about how good it was.  A few guests mentioned I could even sell my pies! I used my own crust recipe and latticed the top for presentation. I added 3 cups blueberries and 2.5 cups blackberries.  I also added an extra Tbsp of sugar and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  YUM!!  Thank you.

This recipe was great!  I added a cup of raspberries and won a local pie contest!  It's not the sweetest, so adding more sugar could be good, if you like a sweet pie.  It was a big hit...The dish was practically licked clean!

This was ok, quite sour.  Only reviewing the filling - made my usual crust.  Perhaps the tartness was because I used more blackberries and less blueberries (probably 2.5 cups black and 2 cups blue), I guess I should have inreased the sugar.  The filling set up fine once cooled - very liquidy right after baking, but that's pretty normal.  Made filling as per recipe except for berry amounts.  Overall I was disappointed....didn't bring out the flavour of the berries.  Maybe some nutmeg or forget the lemon juice?

I've made this pie twice, and it's always gone in less than two days.  I use Splenda for Baking for instead of just pure white sugar, and I use my own pie crust recipe.  I also followed the recommendations and added some cornstarch.  It's still a little goey, but just right.  Perfect combination of sweet and tart.  Excellent with a lattice pie top or some ice cream on the side.

This is a great recipe! I took the easy way out and used a refrigerated pie crust and 2 16 oz. bags of frozen fruit. I also added 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch to the dry mix. Delicious! Both fruits complement each other so well, and the result was very impressive!

I made this pie over the winter with frozen blueberries and raspberries, and again with fresh, using a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. Either way, it's a fresh-tasting, old-fashioned pie that everyone loved. I might have piled on more berries than the recipe specifies and had no trouble with it being runny. I love the combination of these two fruits together.

Doesn't get much easier than this, when you use a pre-made pie crust (I used Pillsbury).  I brought this pie to a dinner party last night and everyone went nuts over it!  One of the guests even skipped dinner, waiting in anticipation for the pie.  Everyone remarked that the sweetness of it was just perfect!  I would recommend adding cornstarch, however.  Without it the juices run all over the place.  But it still tastes great!

This is so-o-o good. I made it last summer as my contribution to an alfresco dinner at the bayside home of some friends.  My hosts and the guests could not stop saying how delicious it was; they devoured it. I baked it in a ready-made frozen crust, so it was also easy to do. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Great pie filling recipe!  I used a different crust (French pastery pie crust on this website) but the filling is perfect. I also switched the boysenberries and blueberries so the pie was  4 cups of boysenberries instead.  Came out great! I did use frozen berries and had to drain the liquid out some when the pie was done but it was no big deal.

Absolutely delicious  ( I did make my own pie crust recipe though ). I have never had a blueberry and blackberry pie and I don't think I will ever just have blueberry again. So rich,  thick and lots of deep flavour. Instead of cooking the fruit in the pie and worrying about it being to thin, I thaw the berries in a sauce pan, add the sugar, salt, cinnamon, lemon juice and butter. Then when it gets hot I add the flour and cornstarch and mix until it is thick. Then I add it to the uncooked pie shell and put the uncooked pastry on  top on and bake till browned.

I loved the berry combination in this pie but found it was way too juicy. My berries were more sour after baking in this pie than they were originally. I baked it for several hours to try to thicken it then resorted to spreading flour on top and baking some more. The result was a chore to eat it did thicken. I will always add cornstarch as other reviewers mentioned to any pie I make again but I will not be getting any requests and will not be making this one.

This was a really good tasting pie that I served to guests -- and got rave reviews. I cheated and used Pillsbury pie crusts -- they worked well with this recipe. I used 2 cups blueberries, 1 cup Red raspberries & 1 Cup Black raspberries. I omitted the lemon juice. I folded in 1/4 C. of flour to mixture and let it sit 15 minutes prior to filling the pie shell. No runniness! As others have done, I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar. I even added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla -- makes the flavors pop. I served with both real whipped cream & good quality vanilla ice cream. I'll make again!

Made this tonight.  I had frozen blackberries from this summers foraging, and frozen blueberries from costco.  The only difference is  I probably used equal amounts of blue and black berries   and somehow misread and only added 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  Still just fine.  Thawed and drained my berries.... Pie set up beautifully.  :D  THANKS!

I had a hard time making it but turned ok. I think i put too much water since i put 9 tablespoons of water instead of 5. So it turned out hard. I shouldv'e put more butter.  Also a potato masher would be great for this recipe instead of a pastry cutter. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have made this several times and love it!  A favorite dessert during the berry season.  I have used both fresh and frozen berries.  If you are nervous about a lattice top crust, it's find with a normal rolled out top crust.

This recipe doesn't make enough pie crust. I will either use my own crust recipe next time or increase this recipe. I prefer blackberries to blueberries because they're more flavorful, so I made my pie with equal berry proportions and received many compliments on the taste. I added 1 t. cornstarch as other reviewers suggested and was pleased with the resulting filling consistency.

SO GOOD! The filling comes out great, but it could use a little less flour. It was a tad dry, but I used fresh blackberries that I picked off the brier patch. I also drained them it might not be so dry if I hadn't have drained them. Even though it was dry it was delicious warm and with some ice cream.

The pie crust was difficult to make, and I made this pie twice already.  I figured, since it was my first time making crust ...it would be difficult, but it was just as hard the second time around.  It was a good filling, but did not use all the sugar needed.

I didn't change a thing, the crust was flaky and the filling perfect. I used some Blackberrys from moms ranch and some blueberries from the oregon coast. I did lightly brush on melted butter and a light sprinkle of sugar to finish it off .

This being summer I used fresh fruit.  Blueberries, blackberries and sliced strawberries made for a delicious pie! I put an extra cookie sheet on the bottom rack underneath the rack that had the pie (on another cookie sheet) on it. Glad I did because it bubbled quite a bit as it baked.

My family loved the flavor of these two berries mixed together. While I picked fresh blackberries and blueberries this summer, I froze them to use as needed. They worked fabulously in this pie. I also used the corn starch another reviewer suggested to ensure the filling thickened properly. I've made several of these pies this fall, and my family is asking for this one for Thanksgiving dessert, too.

We used the Crisco crust recipe, which is almost identical to this one. I used fresh berries, and followed the recipe almost exactly. We wanted raspberries in our pie, so I did 3/4 cup blackberries, 3/4 cup raspberries (with the listed amount of blueberries). I also added a little more sugar and skipped the lemon. We also sprinkled some maple sugar I happened to have on hand on top of the crust after we pulled it out of the oven which really added a lot to the final product. Okay, so maybe we didn't follow the recipe all that exactly. :-) But I didn't see the recommendation to add cornstarch until afterward, and I'm actually kind of glad I didn't. We served it still warm, but it had jelled nicely and tasted absolutely delicious. It was a little gooey but I thought the texture of the filling was perfect. I wouldn't have wanted it more firm. The whole family (except the one member who doesn't like berry pie) gobbled it up.

This rating is for the filling only!  Very good and gooey, not too sweet. May add more blackberries next time to balance the berry flavor more. We used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe on this site for the crust.

I like this a lot, as did my family.  Our only modification was that we used our favorite pie crust as opposed to the one suggested (just what we always do because we have the best crust recipe ever!)  As far as runny pies go, I saw on another recipe that you should turn the oven off when the pie is cooked, crack the door and let it sit for an hour to aid with thickening.  Worked like a charm.  Great recipe!

Got rave reviews when I made for a work-related bbq party! Despite having to substitute a few ingredients (not enough time to go to the grocery store) it tasted really good.  Besides substituting strawberries for the blackberries, and butter for the shortening, I added a tablespoon of corn starch based on other reviewers. I can't wait to make this again!

I did not use the crust recipe so I cannot comment on it. To sum up the discussion on using frozen berries: If you are using frozen berries, either don't drain so much juice and add the flour or cornstarch, or drain ALL the juice and DON'T add the flour or cornstarch. I drained all the juice and added the thickeners and it was way too thick. However, the sweet/ tart flavors of this pie was just right and adding the ground cinnamon as well as nutmeg wouldn't hurt (I used a combination of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon, leftover from making carrot cake) and it turned out alright :)

I used a storebought crust and made a streusel topping for mine, so my rating is for the filling only, which was quite good. It didn't really set up thick enough for me, and I followed the recipe as stated for the filling. This isn't a problem except it makes it not plate well, so I'm glad I gave this a test run. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit for dinner christmas eve! The only downfall was the crust, it didn't seem like enough and ended up making the top look sloppy. I would use your own recipe and keep everything else the same. Top with Cool Whip or vanilla ice cream.

This was a delightful recipe.  My family had just been blackberry picking and I was tired of making the same types of things over and over.  I opted not to make the crust for the pie and instead used a frozen roll-out pie crust.  Because I only had one, I found the Crumb Topping for Pies recipe by Jakesdelights and added that to the top.  I cooked for 35 minutes and the topping got a little too dark.  Next time, I'll probably check it after 30 minutes.  Because the crumb topping has brown sugar in it, I might also reduce the amount of sugar in the filling as it was very sweet.

I followed the recipe as is.  The recipe for the crust was half the amount that I needed; it was only enough for the bottom crust.  I gave this 4 stars because my boyfriend thought that there was too much cinnamon and not enough tartness.  Overall though a good pie!  Next time I would just use half the amount of cinnamon called for.

I was lucky enough to find fresh berries on  sale in January, so I made this pie for my fiance for his birthday instead of cake. I used Pillsbury crusts from the refrigerator case, but otherwise made the recipe as written. Very very tasty! The amount of filling was just right and we didn't notice that it was runny. I've been able to cut slice after slice and the berries/filling stay in place. A+!

This was a pretty good pie but found that I actually needing more dough to make the crust. I think next time I will use 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of shortening. I would rather have to much then not enough. As far as taste though it was really good.

My Daughter used this recipe for her 4-H project.  She received a Blue Ribbon and made the Honor Group.  We really enjoyed eating her practice pies.  She didn't change anything except she used a full top crust instead a lattice top like the picture.

this turned out a bit runny but it was a hit at the pie auction. Great flavor and the addition of cinnamon was fabulous! Thanks

I made this pie with fresh blackberries and frozen blueberries. I have never liked blueberry pie, I always thought it was too sweet. When I made this pie I thought about cutting back the sugar. However, I completely forgot the sugar when I was making it and it was the best blueberry pie i have ever eaten. It wasn't runny at all once it cooled off and you could really taste the fruit.

This was fabulous. I didn't have enough blackberries so I added some raspberries. I did use frozen berries so I took the advice of previous reviewers and added corn starch. I added 2Tbs but next time I will add a third.
Very very good!

I chose this recipe for my very first pie I've ever made.  I was nervous about making a pie but this one turned out great!  I couldn't believe how good it was!  The blueberry blackberry combination was excellent!

the bake time was a bit more for an electric oven (55-60 for a golden crust)and it needed a touch more (1 tbl spoon more) shortening and sugar (which I would the next time I make it--1.5 tsp) but the pie itself is a terrific recipe.

I made 3 pies. The first two turned out a bit wet, the one I made the next day (drained more liquid from the berries ad added raspberries) turned out perfect! Everyone loved it and I will be making this again!

My father-in-laws new favorite pie.  I also just made the filling with gluten-free flower and it turned out perfect - we poured it hot over vanilla ice cream, mmmmmmm!

I made this for my husband, who had never had anything with blackberries in it. It was a hit, so I made two more for our family reunion. Again it was a hit. I did not change a thing about the filling and it was perfect!! I did add a couple of tablespoons of cinnamon and sugar to the pie crust the second time to add a zing to the crust.

Followed a lot of the recommendations for this recipe..i.e.--went with the premade crust, drained the frozen berries and went two tablespoons of corn starch.  It was o.k. but not something I would bake again.

This pie tasted great but made way too much juice.  I used frozen berries which was most likely the problem.  But every slice was gone, people loved it!

This pie was amazing! This was actually my first time ever making a fruit pie before and I was surprised on how well it turned out. My family loved it. The pie was runny though, and I wish I would have followed other's advice on adding cornstarch. Also, I forgot to add the lemon juice and butter but no one could tell I had left anything out! I can't wait to make this pie again and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a delicious dessert!

I made this with frozen blueberries and rasberries.  After reading reviews, I added some corn starch to thicken the filling and it was a great hit with the hubby and parents.

Sooooo super yummy! I used 1 T of corn starch, but it was still a little too juicy. But this is a great recipe! Everyone loved it. The pie crust is very simple to make and SO good.

I have made this pie for three different occasions and have gotten great reviews every time. Sometimes I add a little more flour to thicken it up depending on how juicy the berries are. I also like to put it all in a bowl overnight and let the flavors blend and then just pour it in a pie shell and bake the next day. Thanks for the wonderful recipe it's a keeper for sure.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because my preference is a sweeter pie.  I used 1 cup of sugar and it was still tart.  I would probably add another 3/4c -1c if I tried this again.  I also added tapioca to help with the extra juice.
