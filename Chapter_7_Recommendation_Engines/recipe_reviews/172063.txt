I didn't have sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt, didn't have grapes so I used kiwi, didn't have celery so I used 1/4 t celery seed, didn't have lemon so I used lemon juice. I cooked some breaded chicken tenders I had in the freezer and cut them up for "chicken". I wanted to make sure my family ate the cantaloupe and didn't just eat out of it, so I cut the cantaloupe in chunks and mixed with dressing mixture .Served it on a bed of fresh spinach along side French bread and with soup.

Made this for a summer lunch...delicious!  I used canned chicken and would also like to try canned tuna.  I substituted chopped smoked almonds for regular almonds.

I used honey instead, but otherwise tried to duplicate other main ingredients. Love the flavor of the dressing, full of summer notes!

I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, canned chicken, and omitted almonds because it wasn't going to be served right away and I knew the almonds would have gotten soggy. Tasty and refreshing.
