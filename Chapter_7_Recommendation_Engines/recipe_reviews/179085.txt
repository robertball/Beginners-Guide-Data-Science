I made this last evening for dinner.  The only suggestion I would make is to add another can of soup and milk.  It seemed a little bit dry to us.  Overall the taste was good and the ease of preparation was great (I used leftover cubed chicken instead of canned).  Will make this again I'm sure.

I only used one can of soup and milk and less than half the noodles. I also added about a cup and a half of grated cheddar, absolutley delicious!

Tasted more like tuna noodle casserole than chicken. My kids wouldn't touch any part except the broccoli - go figure! I agree with another poster that this needs a little more liquid -- it left alot of pasta crunchy because it wasn't covered in liquid. I even added a little shredded cheddar cheese to the top to make it more appealing, but it was still a no go. I did add some salt and pepper to it when I mixed the dish, since I was using the Healthy Selection soup. Still didn't help much. I will stick to using my canned chicken in Bisquick recipes instead.

Wonderful! I did add a little spice, salt, pepper and onion powder. Went fast at my house. Will be one to do again and again.
