My Grandmother used to make a lucious Ricotta Pie every Easter.  Unfortunatley, never had anything written down, as the recipe was in her head. This recipe is very, very close to what she made.  She never put the chocolate in her pie, but a lot of the other Italian ladies did.  We just omit the chocolate, and it's just like Grandma used to make!
Thank you so much for this recipe!!!
One beloved tradtion will continue through many more generations.

This recipe keeps old world traditions alive. I have been making ricotta pie since I was A kid, with my Mom. This is a very similar recipe. My Mom used to put lemon and orange rind grated in batter. Also some of the juice from the citrus fruit. I have been a chef for many years and was very impressed, great job. Happy holidays.

made this as a dessert to take to an Italian dinner party and was a great success. The recipe is great.  I have made this several times and to make a little change, I used half milk chocolate and half white chocolate which i think made it creamier, I also added 1/3 cup of ground hazel nuts.

Wow, seeing this recipe and reading the reviews brought tears to my eyes. My mother and aunts all made this Easter tradition. My aunt Teresa(Tia Tresia) made this and put prisuto in it, an old Abbruzzi recipe called Chatoon, Madonna wasa disa guud. My mother used white raisens and chocolate chips. Any way you make it its like heaven which I am sure is where all these great gals are. God Bless them all. Food is love.

I scaled back this recipe and made this pie for my parents on Thanksgiving Day.  They said the taste was good, but I over-cooked it.  Because the pie seemed loose, I left it in the oven too long.

I now realize that when the knife is clean and it's still loose, take the pie out of the oven and let it sit.  

I will make this again on Christmas morning.  Thank you.

I think it's ok.  Why so many eggs?  It shouldn't have an eggy taste like another reviewer said. My mothers' recipe was almost exactly like Chef Giovanni's mothers. Maybe four eggs at the most.  Deliciouso!

This recipe was very good, but not what I expected. It tasted like a sweet quiche. It was a different consistency as I expected as well. A little too eggy for a Ricotta pie but overall a great recipe and very easy to make!! Thanks!

The pie was beautiful, but the consistency a bit odd for those of us not used to this kind of pie.  I was expecting it to be more like a custard pie, but consistency wise it was like a crumbly quiche.  I cooked it only 80 minutes and added 1 t salt to pastry dough and 4 t vanilla to filling.  Taste was good.

Wow.  My family loved this pie.  I made a few small changes.  I par baked a store bought crust, added the zest of one lemon to the ricotta mixture, and made a ganache with the chocolate which I spread over the bottom of the pie crust before adding the ricotta custard.  If you do this, make sure to add the ricotta slowly to avoid messing the ganache layer.  I baked in a water bath.  After baking I allowed it to cool completely and then refrigerated.  A lemony glazed layer formed on the top, the fantastic custard in the center and the bottom layer of ganache on a buttery crust danced in the mouth.  It was so much lighter than a run of the mill cheesecake.  I will definitely make this pie again exactly the way I made it.
