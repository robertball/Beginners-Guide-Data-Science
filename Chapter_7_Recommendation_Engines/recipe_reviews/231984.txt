Make sure to cut back on the oil, I just used a couple of tablespoons at the most. This was a great combination and I look forward to making this again.

Hi Everyone- I am the author of this recipe. I wanted to edit the oil on the ingredients list due to the reviews but it wouldn't let me without paying a membership fee. So I wanted to clarify, I agree that 1/4 cup oil can be to much oil...I was guesstimating but also, I cook by taste. When I do this recipe I use a large pan and a lot of asparagus and because I want the breadcrumbs and cheese to stick, I cook on a low heat for a long time- 20 minutes-ish so I don't add the oil all at once but throughout the process of cooking.

Delicious!  My only suggestions are cut the oil back.  I actually drained some in order to get the crumbs and cheese to brown without getting soggy and start with half the amount of garlic.  I added both my grated cheese and the garlic powder to the bread crumbs and mixed it all together before add it all to the pan.  Thanks, this is a great way to cook asparagus!

This stuff was horrible. It was a soggy, gloppy mess. I followed the directions exactly, and when it turned out so gross, I went back and reread the recipe to make sure I hadn't missed something, but no, I had done exactly what it said.

I followed the recipe as precisely as I could.  How much is a "bunch" of asparagus?  I used exactly one pound.  The oil saturated it.  The garlic powder was totally overwhelming.

Really good, used less oil, didn't have the bread crumbs, just used parmesan and garlic powder and salt...  very easy and very tasty - kind of came out like it was grilled.  I only had a small bunch of asparagus so used only 1 T. of garlic powder and 2 T. of parmesan.

If you dial back the oil slightly it comes out great.  I've found that if you go heavy on the other seasonings the excess once you pull out the asparagus tastes excellent stirred into some white rice. Makes for a crunchy style white rice that's an excellent side dish.

This was a really tasty way to have asparagus and I liked it a lot.  I should have used my biggest pan though, I had some trouble turning the asparagus in my second-to-biggest one.   I reduced the olive oil to only a couple tablespoons based on other reviews I read, but I think I should have left it as it was because I had some difficulty getting the breadcrumbs to stick.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! My husband will no longer complain when I serve asparagus. I think the bread crumbs made my pee smell funny though.

I drizzled the oil and skipped the breadcrumbs on account of keeping it light.  You have to gauge the time with how large your asparagus is.  Don't walk away from the pan so as to keep this recipe simple and delicious!

LOVE IT!  We use Coconut oil or Grapeseed oil instead of olive oil, have never had a problem with too much.  This is by far our favorite way to prepare asparagus, second is to grill it!
