Even with all those wonderful ingredients, something was still missing---and it wasn't just that I went a little short on the sambal oelek.  It needed salt and pepper, which I would add to the meat just before cooking it.  I also recommend cutting the meat from a semi-frozen state because mine was fresh, and it was almost impossible to cut thinly.  The other thing I missed was a little something on the buns when broiling them---a slick of butter or mayo for a little flavor/moisture.  My carrots weren't exactly the right kind to slice thinly---I needed some bigger and maybe needed to use a mandolin to slice them.  Don't read this review and think you shouldn't make this sandwich!  Just a couple of changes (in my mind anyway) would make this a spectacular sandwich!  Seriously the ingredients are all wonderful!  I appreciate having the chance to make this one for our dinner tonight!  Thank you, Cooking44!
