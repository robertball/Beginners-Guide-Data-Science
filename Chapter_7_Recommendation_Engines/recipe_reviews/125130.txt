This cake is great!  And I must say, the frosting makes it.  Don't skip it, people.  ;)  For the reviewer who had dry frosting, you might have boiled it too long.  It's supposed to come just to a boil, and then remove it from the heat and quickly stir in everything else.  I had my powdered sugar ready to go.  It does set up very quickly once you put it on the cake.  It set up almost too fast for me, but I might have let my cake cool too much.  I LOVE the almond flavor and I absolutely LOVE the frosting.  It reminds me of the frosting on some petit-fours I got in Germany.  My mom makes this recipe all the time and today was my first time making it.  Super easy and fast, and very satisfying.  Everyone loved it.  I will make it again!

I used this to make a layer cake using round cake pans and it worked perfectly.  I subbed vanilla for the almond extract in both the cake and frosting and used Lemon Curd (from this site) between the layers.  I halved the frosting recipe so that I would have just enough to spread on the top of the cake and then sprinkled with slivered almonds (instead of walnuts).  It was beautiful, dense, moist, and delicious!  I will definitely use this as a standard white cake recipe in the future.  Thanks!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I subbed vanilla for the almond extract, and frosted the cake with chocolate butter cream (white cake with chocolate frosting is his favorite). It was so delicious and so easy to make! Everyone loved it!

This cake is awesome! Tastes like wedding cake, super moist with that lovely almond flavoring. Halving the recipe makes 12 cupcakes. They bake up nicely at 375 for 12-14 minutes. The paper liners come off beautifully. This cake magically becomes  even better the next day! I go back to this recipe time and time again. Five Stars!

This is my daughter's favorite cake.  I have to say, that if it wasn't so high in fat and calories, we would have this more often.  I love the almond flavor.  The fact that this cake bakes so quickly and the frosting is added while the cake is warm makes this cake even more appealing.  And it does seem to get better if made ahead of time.  This cake is wonderful for a potluck, which is what I made mine for.  It was incredibly popular with kids and adults.  I cut mine into individual servings and topped each with 1/2 of a cherry.  I sprinkled this cake with almonds instead of walnuts, because of the almond flavoring.

I just made this recipe for a friend.  Her sister had made it years ago and we couldn't stop sneaking little slices the whole day we visited.  Now I have a copy...hooray!  Making it brought back the memory and it was even better this time around.  YUM!  I only changed a couple of things.  I have a darker pan (Wilton) so I decreased the temp by 25 degrees and it baked in 18min.  I also made the frosting while the cake was baking and put it on immediately out of the oven.  My mom has made the chocolate version for years and that's how it's made.  So good!  BE WARNED... this is NOT a traditional sheet cake.

If you need a last-minute cake for a bake sale, party, potluck, etc... this is *the* cake.  Yeah, the frosting is really, REALLY sweet, but that just ensures small pieces :).  Oh, a discovery since I've made this recipe a few times:  the butter in the cake batter can be successfully reduced by a 1/4 cup without compromising the integrity of the cake ... hey, every little bit helps!

I needed something to make into a flag cake, and also something that didn't list boxed cake mix as an ingredient! I had to sub vanilla yogurt for sour cream. This is a very tasty cake.

Quick and easy. I liked that it could all be made in 1 pan. I enjoyed the almond taste, but I think I'd put less frosting on next time.

I am really surprised at all the high ratings, which is why I made this cake, plus white cake is my favorite. First,this cake is way too sweet; I mean sickening sweet. Also, way too much almond extract (almond flavor). I may have liked vanilla extract better. Third, the amount of powered sugar (4.5 cups) is way off...you'll need either more butter/milk or less powered sugar. As is, I had to add more milk.butter to the frosting and found I had way too much frosting. For others, cut back on the powdered sugar (3.5 should be plenty). It's the frosting that makes this way too sweet.

I thought the frosting was way too sweet.  Also I cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan and I think it didn't cook long enough because the cake was really really dense and SUPER sweet.  My husband loved it, but it was too sweet for my taste.

Decadent. I made these into cake pops with my new cake pop pans, and used the frosting for dipping. Added sprinkles while it was warm, and they look and taste great. If anyone else tries it, fyi, bake it for 15 min. I also altered recipe by halfing almond extract and adding vanilla for other half of tsp. Smells like sugar cookies in here. I look forward to making this recipe as a sheet cake, too. Very good recipe.

Definitely easy to make.  Taste is very good, and it is better the longer it sits.  I did not make the frosting.

Not as great as some reviewers stated.  A bit heavy and didn't have great flavour.  I won't make this again. The best cake on this site is the Kentucky Butter Cake.

Made exactly as stated but my cakes were so flat and dense. I assume its because I over mixed it, but whatever.

I have made this cake for years and everyone loves it. You really do need to let it sit for a day or it just won't be as good. Great for potlucks.

Whenever we have a potluck, this is the cake that I have everyone ask for. I make it as written, but I make it a 1 1/2 recipe, and I toast sliced almonds to put in the icing. Every single person that tries this, raves about it. Thanks for a most excellent recipe!!

This is the most crumbly cake I've ever had to work with. When I lifted it out of the pan after it had cooled, it broke into dozens of pieces.
Taste is good but there are more solid cake recipes out there.

This was incredible.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only differences were that I added 1 tsp of almond extract to the frosting, and also mixed in toasted almonds and coconut rather than pecans.  This is such a wonderful, moist cake--incredible.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Kids loved it too!

Well, it sure was the easiest and fastest cake I've ever put together from start to finish.  It took only 35 minutes, total, to have a completely baked and frosted cake.  If that weren't enough, I did the whole thing in one sauce pan and only dirtied a whisk, a rubber spatula and a couple of measuring cups and spoons; a dish-aphobe's dream!   The cake was excellent, nice and finely textured and fluffy.  I might cut back on the sugar next time.  The frosting was way over the top sweet, but very tasty.  I did add salt to the frosting to try to tame the sweetness, but it didn't do enough.  I will make the cake again.  I might be tempted to use the frosting on cinnamon rolls.

While super easy to make, it ended up being very dense and not at all a white cake. Even though I used only 3 cups of powdered sugar, the frosting was still too sweet. And it didn't get better the next day; on the contrary, it was best the first day. Would keep in my recipe box only for the simplicity, but needs major tweaking!

My daughter thought the icing was too sweet, and gave it a 3.5. Hubby gave it a 4.5 for being slightly too sweet, but still very good, and more or less like a yellow version of the original Texas Sheet Cake. I liked it, though I will cut the sugar on the icing in the future. I wish I had found this sooner, so overall, we give it a 4.

Everyone who tried these and the cake I made too said they loved this. The almond extract kept bringing people back for seconds. Moist cake. I double the recipe to make a quarter sheet pan and there were no problems.

Wow, what a great and super-simple cake!  I couldn't even wait for it to cool to eat it and it's very light and fluffy and moist and just mmmmmm.  I realized I was out of almond extract when I was halfway through mixing everything so I ended up using a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of amaretto in the batter, then just vanilla in the frosting.  Only used 3 cups of powdered sugar in the icing and that is plenty.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  Edit:  Just made it a second time and had pure almond extract this time.  Awesome!  Not sure which I like better -- with vanilla or almond -- but they are both fantastic.

This is an awesome recipe, I made it for a party at work and everyone loved it. I have made it a couple of times and I have found that it needs to bake for about 30 - 32 min. Thanks so much for sharing this recipes :) It is the bomb!

I have been making this cake for years. My kids always want this for their birthday cake made with vanilla extract and chocolate butter cream frosting. Absolutely the easiest cake to make. Absolutely the yummiest too! Thanks for sharing Joanie.

I had buttermilk in the fridge and used it in the frosting instead of just plain milk and I think it provided a more homemade flavor.  I also always double the frosting.  If you're gonna be bad, be really bad!  Also, why not top it with toasted slivered almonds to go with the almond extract in the cake and frosting?  The walnuts seemed a little out of place and the almonds fit right in.

Very Good, this is a nice change from white/chocolate cake and a good variation of the chocolate sheet cake. The frosting will become to dry with 4 1/2 cups of sugar you need to reduce the sugar to 3 1/4 cups or add more milk to have a creamy consitancy. Thanks for sharing.

This cake is absolutely delicious and very versatile. I can only really rate the cake, as I did not choose to make the frosting, but the cake - oh, the CAKE! Such great texture and amazing flavor. It's incredible what a tsp of almond extract can do for a cake. I've made it twice now - once as a sheet cake with chocolate frosting and once I poured it in two round cake pans and made a layer cake (and had it with vanilla frosting from a can, whipped with a tsp of almond extract to complement the cake flavor). Both times were spectacular and I will make this cake again and again and again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious.  I did find the frosting to be a little too sweet though.  I also cooked this in a 9x13 because that is all I had so it made the cake a little fatter than I would have liked and I had to greatly increase the cooking time.

I flour the bottom of the greased pan.  Do not let it cool 20 minutes or the frosting will get hard.  I do not stir in the walnuts in the frosting because it looks prettier just to sprinkle them on top of the frosting.  For a variation, I added frozen huckleberries after I have poured the mixture in the baking pan.  Everyone keeps coming back for seconds and thirds!!!

My kids loved it. My daughter hates cake and this is the ONLY cake she LOVES so far.  We made it for a birthday party, along with a chocolate texas sheet cake.  The white cake was gobbled up much faster than the chocolate!  It was the best cake ever.

The frosting was sickeningly sweet... the cake itself was pretty good though, so i turned it to a muffin instead and added a cup of almonds. You can check my blog for some tips on the procedure. http://hazedandbaked.blogspot.com/2012/07/how-to-make-almond-muffins.html

Made this recipe this weekend at my in-laws.  It was awesome!!!  Very moist - but as some others have noted - VERY sweet!  I have a horrible sweet tooth so for me to say that - if you're not into sweet, you might want to tone down the powdered sugar in the icing.  I did have to substitute soured milk for the sour cream as I didn't have any sour cream and didn't want to have to go to the store.  I'll have to try the original but this one was so moist and delicious, it's going to be hard to top it!  Thanks for the new recipe.

was awesome!! Love it. I started to make it and suddenly realized I did not have the sour cream I thought I had. So I used heavy whip cream and added another egg and more flour. Even w/ these substitution and additions it was fantastic!

This cake is ahhh-mazing! Just took it out of the oven and could barely wait for it to cool before sampling! I made it exactly as written, but did not need quite as much confectioner's sugar as the recipe called for.

I have made this fabulous cake many times.  After the first time I made it, I tweaked the almond extract just a bit and added vanilla extract.  The cake is to die for--I rate it an 11 on a scale of 10!  I've posted it on my recipe blog Fran's Faves, and it is one of the most popular recipes on there.

This was a last minute emergency birthday cake.  The part that caught my eye was that you basically dump everything in a bowl and  20 minutes later you have a cake.  

Honestly this was one of the best cakes that I have made from scratch.  I did not do the icing.  I ran out of time for it to cool.  The cake was so good that the icing was not quite necessary anyways.  We just put the ice cream on top of the still warm cake as it was served.  The cake was amazing without it.  

My 1 year old daughter wouldn't even eat her store bought birthday cake.  She liked this better.

This will definitely become one of my go to recipes.

*  My changes.  I was out of almond extract so I used vanilla but eh.  No a big change.  I do agree with the previous poster that you could cut back on some of the sugar if that is an issue.

My friend loved it so much she said 
"this cake is worth getting fat over." 

Delicious, rich, moist & decadent... it was a treat. 
{I used chopped pecans for the frosting instead of walnuts... it was wonderful!!}

This was pretty yummy.  I substituted vanilla for the almond.  Also, 4.5 cups of confectioners' sugar seemed like way too much, so I used about 2 cups and went heavy on the walnuts.  The cake could use a little something, so next time I think I'll add a little cinnamon and go from there.

I give this recipe 5 stars. I used it to make a peach upside cake and it was very good. I only used 1 cup of sugar as 2 cups were too much for us. I still give it 5 stars for ease and simplicity. It was actually just as easy as a cake mix. It was nice that I keep all of the ingredients on hand.

Tastes all right and was very easy to make but I did not care for the texture.  My mom loved it.

This recipe is so easy, so good, and so moist!  Even better the next day.  I usually skip the icing because we love it without and it's a little too sweet for us with the icing. If you can cut the sweetness a tad the icing is great too.

I thought this was pretty good.  We made it two days before we wanted to eat it and it was still moist and very delicious.  I used my own frosting on it, so I can't rate that.  But the cake was very nice.

This cake was very sweet and it did taste better the older it was - it got more moist.  The frosting was very dry, not sure if i did something wrong.  It tasted ok but it looked strange.  good cake but I would use a different frosting.

9 4 15 ...http://allrecipes.com/recipe/125130/white-texas-sheet-cake/ ...  Very good,   I reduced butter by 2T in the cake.  'Could've gone lower as suggested by a reviewer - reducing by 1/4c.  I decreased the sugar to 1 3/4c.  Really like the idea of pouroverwhilewarm frosting.  Very fast & easy to make so a great choice for in-a-pinch.  'On the plainlooking side though so nuts or something else would help that.  Tastewise, I don't think it needs anything.  It's a large, but thin cake; lasted a while now.  'Still as good as day one.  :)  I figured out what it reminds me of: Sour Cream Donuts! ... 7 2016 I really like this cake.  Those sensitive to almond extract will think it's too much, not me.  For those,I tried half vanilla, half almond in both the cake & icing.  While still good, I''m going to stick with the only almond in the cake, 1t;  1/4t each vanilla & almond in icing.  Using 3 1/2c confec leaves a soft, but firm, smooth glaze.  It is a bit "see-through" though.  (Who cares?!?)  With 4 1/2c, it's good, but nearly too much with the cake being so thin.  It's more of a frosting, spreadable, then.  Note4Me:  pour frosting over warm cake

MarieC loves this one ... https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/white-texas-sheet-cake/ ... Not with that cake, but this is her favorite frosting, said to add milk to flour not the other way around ... https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016330-ermine-icing ... Think it's basically a boiled milk icing.

So yummy!  I have to make sure only to make this when I'm baking for a crowd, otherwise I eat too much.  I used coconut oil and margarine instead of the butter and slivered almonds for the waluts.  Easy to make dairy-free.

Made this Saturday for a Sunday cook out.  Did cut back to 3 cups of confectioners sugar and added toasted almonds in with the icing.   Absolutely delicious and loved by all.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and family love,love,love this recipe!!! I had no almond extract, so I used vanilla extract and it was such a hit! Even our extended family  requests it at family functions! Thank you!
