Very tasty pockets!  I ended up with more filling than crescents, so perhaps load with a bit more than 1/3 cup.

Amazing! I used my own crumbled bacon and yellow onion instead of green onion

My family enjoyed these. They were easy to make.  I did leave out the ham as a personal preference.  I also used leftover mashed potatoes, because that's what I had on hand.  They would make a good appetizer for the holidays.  I will definitely be making these again in the future.

Good receipe, I added some peas and used precooked bacon...next time I will crisp the bacon some before adding it. I also had to cook the pockets a lot longer.

Easy and tasty, (left out ham) going to try variations on these pockets.  Chicken, yellow onions, carrots, peas and gravy perhaps. OMG pot pockets!

11 year old made these while mom was finishing other work.  She said they are super easy to make.  The taste was very yummy.  What a great way to use up some leftover holiday ham.  Will definitely make this one again, but will add a little pepper to the potatoes.  We did omit the red pepper sauce though, as that just isn't a favorite here.

This was a great and easy recipe that the whole family loved! Next time I'm going to try and add chicken and broccoli instead.

Made these with leftover mashed potatoes and honeybaked ham from Thanksgiving.  Quick, easy and delicious.  Can't wait to do it again next year.

Over all very good. But I thought they were a little bland. Husband and kid loved them.

These were good, but not good enough to make all the ingredients worth it.
