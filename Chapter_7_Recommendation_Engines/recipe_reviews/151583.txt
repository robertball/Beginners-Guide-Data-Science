This recipe was AWESOME. It was so good that my husband went back to the leftovers just 1.5 hours after dinner! I did make some minor changes based on what I had in the house (parm instead of romano like the other reviewers), but the big change I made was to use kale instead of spinach. I would definitely recommend the kale -- its not as wilty as spinach, holds up better in leftovers, and adds a nice different bit of texture to the dish. Also, I did keep the amount of meat recommended in the recipe, and would definitely do both the sausage and ground beef. It's meaty, but oh so good (and I'm not a huge meat person)!

delicious! so flavorful & hearty.  I omitted the ground beef-it would have been too much meat, and probably would have changed the flavor - believe me, it doesnt need it. Also substituted light red kidney beans and parmesean cheese. It's a favorite of ours now.

This turned out really well, even with my "healthier" adjustments. I'm quite surprized.  I used one pound ground turkey instead of ground beef and I used all organic chicken broth. I did not have white kidney beans but I did have organic chickpeas, which I used in their place. I did not have fresh basil so I used a good measure of dried basil. Because I'm watching my carbs, I used about a cup or so of cauliflower instead of pasta that I cooked in the same organic chicken broth that I used in the soup. After tasting it, I added about a teaspoon or so of crushed red pepper flake. Really surprizingly good and really great using pantry items I already had on hand. NOTE: I did use almost all organic ingredients where I could.

Very yummy! Liked it better without the ground beef; used Parmesan cheese I had on hand. Note: Do NOT use more than 1/2 pasta.

My Mom gave me this recipe last year, she get it in an email from Cambell's Kitchen and it is my favorite soup in the world.  Since the first time I made it, my roommates refer to is simply as 'the soup'.  The only change I make is that I use dried basil instead of fresh, simply because its easier.  This is a wonderful winter soup that is delicious and easy to make!

Fabulous.  I doubled the sausage and omitted the beef.  Used one 28 oz. can of plum tomatoes that I had immulsified with a hand blender and added fresh thyme, parsley, basil and dry oregano.  Simmered until thickened and then added the pasta.  Couldn't stop eating it and kids/hubby also gave it two thumbs up.  Made it a second time w/ half italian sausage and half ground turkey.  Great too!!

Like another reviewer, I read a story in Real Simple magazine and this dish sounded so good that I came online to find a recipe. I'm so glad that I found this one! The only changes that I made were to use pinto beans instead of white kidney, dry basil instead of fresh, and a good parmesan instead of the Romano. I thought it would be too much meat, but it's definitely not! My husband and my dad loved it as well. So flavorful and delicious! Give it a try; you won't be disappointed!

The textures and flavors of the ingredients blend well to make this a tasty dish.  I too omitted the ground beef as others had - the sausage was plenty of meat.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and parm cheese instead of romano simply because that's what I had on hand.  This recipe will be going into my "family favorites" folder to be used again on another cold winter night.

I've had some soup recipes that I've made over and over again on this site. This recipe is a TRUE WINNER.  So much flavor, love the hardiness... perfect on a cold evening. I used mild and hot sausage, and a half pound of GB. Next time, I will leave it out. I didn't have flavored tomatoes, just used plain diced ones. Still came out GREAT! I will be making this a lot more in the future. So HAPPY I found this recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used one pkg. of lean turkey sausages (mild Italian flavor, about 5), and ommitted the beef.  I used sodium reduced broth and sodium free tomatoes. I put the fresh spinach in the bowl, then poured the hot soup over the spinach, as some people don't like spinach in their soup. I was tempted to add some bell peppers, but it tasted perfect as is...will definetly make again.  I served it with naan bread for dipping. Yummy!

This is delicious.  Sneak in extra spinach earlier on...it will disintegrate, not changing the flavor, but upping the amount of spinach you get into your family.  Then add the rest later.

This soup is very good. My family and I like it better with just one pound of Italian sausage and no ground beef.

I made this one day when I was sick, and it was so easy.  I did not use hamburger, and there was more than enough sausage.  I used Jimmy Dean Regular sausage.  I did add celery and carrots.  Used pesto instead of the basil.  Cooked it about a half hour.  Very easy and tasty.

I added more beans to the I used one can of kidney beans and one can of butter beans. I also only used one type of meat. I used Italian turkey sausage and it was plenty of meat. I think next time I will cut the meat in half. It gave plenty of meat. I also seasoned it with lemon pepper, accent, italian season and basil. It could use a little more liquid so I will tweek that a little next time, but a great recipe none the less.

This was so so good. Used 1 pound of Italian sausage and half pound ground turkey. Next time though I will only use half pound of sausage and half ground turkey and will try a pesto feta spinach chicken sausage they have at my local food market.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for some ground beef and this was perfect and fairly healthy too!  I didn't have any sausage so that was omitted and I substituted pinto beans for cannelloni beans as again, I didn't have them.  Very yummy and I will definitely make again.  I also added a little more pasta than what was outlined in the recipe.

AMAZING!!!! This was a wonderful dish - even better the next day. Since I have little guys I made it with Mild Italian sausage and I used a mixture of ground pork and ground round (1/2 pd each) - Can't wait to try it again with Hot Italian sausage.

Very good.  Made exactly, but only used a half of the italian sausage it called for and used basil seasoning versus using fresh basil because I didn't have any on hand.

Last month's Real Simple magazine had an article where the author talked about making a sausage and bean ragout, but there was no recipe.  Allrecipes to the rescue!  We couldn't get cannellini beans at our grocery, so we used great northerns, but that was the only substitution we made.  Fabulous!  We both loved it.  I passed the recipe along to a daughter who made it and loved it, as well as to my mother, who couldn't say enough good things about it.  I'm not fond of soup, so I was happy that it wasn't very liquidy.  And we had thought initially that 1/2 cup of elbow pasta wouldn't be enough, but it turned out to be perfect.  We will be making this one again and again.  Thanks!

Tasty comfort food-type soup for a chilly night - great with a chunk of crusty bread.  I used all sausage (because I was looking for a recipe to use up a large amount) and didn't miss the beef. It was also quick and easy to get on the table at the end of a long day, which is always a winner at our house.

My family loved this!!! My mom had lapband about 3 weeks ago, which is why I decided to make it.  It was hearty enough for us, yet soupy enough for my mom to blend it so it didn't get stuck in there.  I only changed 2 things....an entire 4 cup container of chicken broth, and about 2 cups of noddles for my kids.  I'll be making this again!

I omitted the beef (I only had sausage on hand) and thought it was PLENTY of meat. Didn't have spinch so I used some celery & zucchini. Decent recipe for a cold night, I added some S&P and red pepper flakes to add a little more flavor. Super easy to make and definately hearty

An excellent cheap and easy winter meal. I used what I had on hand; used instant bouillon instead of stock, dried basil, marjoram, pasta sauce in place of tomatoes, red kidney beans, and frozen whole leaf spinach.  Only one pot to wash after dinner... It will make great leftovers, too!

YUM! I was looking for something different to do with hot sausage when I stumbled upon this recipe. WOW ! I loved it. I too left out the ground beef as I felt there would be too much meat. I will be making this one often come winter!! Thanks for this one!

I'm always skeptical of "label" recipes but this one is very good.  I added much more basil than called for, and used Pecorino Romano for extra zing.  I served it with a green salad, some crusty garlic bread, and a tasty Australian shiraz.  My wife and guests all loved it.

This soup was delicious! I made it without the fresh basil and garlic only because I didn't have it. Assumed I had it - wrong! I added some italian seasoning to compensate. I can't wait to make this next time with the garlic and basil; I'm sure it will be even better. I used parmesan instead of romano and ditalini instead of elbows because that's what I had. Also, I think next time I will just use sausage, I think the ground beef was too much and didn't add much flavor to the dish. Excellent!

Excellent!  I made this for my wife with only 1 small change.  I used 1/2 pound of Hot Italian Sausage so that it wouldn't be too spicy.  She loved it.  It had great flavor and was very hearty.  The best thing about it is that it is reasonably low in fat and calories.  This is certainly an easy recipe to make and one that I will certainly make in deer camp this year.

Added a bit of carrots and few tablespoons of pureed tomatoes. It adds up more color and tastes good too.
Didn't have canned tomatoes but chopped up 1 fresh tomato and no cheese either.It's quite rich without the cheese.
Turned out nice.

This recipe was way too salty.  My mistake was using two pounds of sausage rather than one pound of sausage and one pound of hamburger like the recipe called for.  But it was so salty I would think even just using the one pound of sausage would be too much.  Perhaps using unsalted tomato sauce and unsalted beans would help?  Otherwise the flavor was very nice.

Absolutely wonderful!!! Will make this again and again.  Like many other reviewers, I only used sausage, my budget can only afford one kind of meat and it wasn't missed so that is how it will be made from now on.  I also added a few fresh tomatoes (they were getting a bit soft) along with the canned, just about doubled the spinach (we love spinach in my house) and used Parm instead of Romano because that is what we had! Great recipe!

This was really good.  I did not use the hamburger, just sausage, but a little over a pound of it.  Also, used dried basil as others did.  It made a lot of soup, but sure was yummy and great on a rainy day in the Northwest!

I followed the recipe, used both the ground beef and sausage, and I didn't think it was too much meat. It is a great stew, and I am sure it will be welcome in the winter. It's supposed to be 99 here today so this not really the season for hot soup, but it was great anyway. (I made it for tonight's dinner but "tested" a bowl for my lunch.)

Used one pound turkey sausage and omitted the ground beef to save money and calories.  Did not miss the extra meat, still very hearty and tasty!  Also used kale instead of spinach because as another person wrote, it holds up better in soups and stews.  This is a great easy meal!

This is the first soup I've ever made- it was so easy and tastes delicious!I left out the ground beef because I wanted a more brothy soup and didn't want to end up with 12 cups (although I'd probably eat that much of it). Forget chicken soup for colds- even with a stuffy nose, I can tell this is the best soup ever, and the spicyness is allowing me to breathe again!

I made this recipe twice just to be sure, but it was just ok.  Not bad or great just ok.  I am always looking for good soup recipes but will not be making this one again.  Most reviews thought it was great so just had to give me opinion that I did not think so.

This recipe is great. I love the fresh taste and that it's hearty without being too heavy. In order for the pasta to cook thoroughly, I turned up the heat after adding it to the recipe. I added some wine for good measure.

FANTASTIC!!!!!  This is the best soup recipe I have ever tried.  I too left out the hamburger, and thought it was just perfect, and couldn't believe how easy it was to make.  Tastes like it comes from the Olive Garden ... will make again for sure!

This was an excellent and filling soup! I didn't have any fresh basil, so I subbed some dried, and I used ditalini pasta in place of the elbows, but those were my only changes. I will definately be making this soup again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

What a wonderful soup!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I thought it might be too much meat--and indeed, it is a meaty soup--but I loved that.  It was so hearty and filling, and the spinach gives it a gorgeous splash of color.  Delightful!

This soup-stew was just awesome. It made a ton (for two people, enough for four meals!) I cut the meat in half though, and used "hot" italian sausage from the market. So 1/2 lb of beef, 1/2 lb of sausage. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used about 1 tsp of dried. I used red kidney beans. For spinach I chopped up 1/2 bunch of fresh baby spinach leaves. I forgot the cheese :( For leftovers we just added more chicken broth to make it soupy again. Delicious!!

A hearty and flavorful soup. Tweaked the recipe a bit by adding two thinly sliced fresh jalapenos in step 2. We used a 10 oz. tub of fresh spinach instead of 6 oz, 1 cup pasta instead of 1/2 cup, and subbed Parmesan cheese for Romano. If making again, we would leave out the ground beef as others suggested or sub small chunks of beef or chicken instead.

pretty good. I used half the tomato and it was still too much- next time I might use a small can of sauce or crushed (and I do love tomatoes) other than that I would reccomend giving it a try if you want something quick and simple!

Excellent; I had to make only a couple minor adjustments. First, I needed to use mild sausage, as I'm the only one in my house who likes "hot" (though I suspect, when mixed with the hamburger, it may contribute more flavor and not be too much for the heat-adverse). Second, I only had one can of the diced tomatoes as described, so for my second can, I used stewed tomatoes with the same spices (and cut the pieces up smaller). OH MY GOSH, as I'm typing this and reviewing the ingredients, I realized I forgot the spinach. Argh! Okay, well, it's great without it. (Update: SO I snuck in kale instead of spinach, as one reviewer suggested. It was exceptional.)

Great tasting super easy recipe.  Most items can be subbed with something else (thankfully).  Couldn't stop eating it.

No beef, double sausage.  White chili beans because didn't have kidney beans.  2 cups of pasta (rotini) since a half cup totally disappeared.  Parm instead of Romano.  Sea salt to your taste, and didn't have spinach so omitted.  Can't wait to get the right beans and cheese just to try it again.

This was fabulous and easy. Only change I made was mild Italian sausage as we don't handle hot anymore. Didn't have fresh basil so added italian seasoning.  Quick, easy and filling! Froze the leftovers for another night.

This was very good and very easy!  I omitted the sausage, as our family is cutting down on our meat consumption.  I really don't think it needs two lbs. of meat.  I might use 1/2 lb of each next time.  I did not have enough fresh basil, so I used 2 T dried.  I only had one can of seasoned tomatoes, so I used 6 oz. of fresh diced tomatoes and 4 T tomato paste.  I did not have romano cheese, I used parmesan.  This is a keeper, even with my substitutions.  I can't wait to try it again when I do have all the correct ingredients!

Very, very tasty!!  Unfortunately I forgot to add the pasta due to one to many glasses of wine.  We loved it and thought the pasta would have been great in it.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe! I followed others' suggestion of leaving out the ground beef.  I'm glad I did, otherwise it would have been too meaty.  Great for a cold evening. Try to use the cannellini beans-made the dish very colorful and pretty. Serve with crusty warm bread and a hearty red wine. Yum.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I said, "do you like it?"  He said, "no, I LOVE IT!"  The only thing he requested was to add more pasta next time.  We had it again for dinner tonight...and I think it might even be better today.  Thank you for posting the recipe!  5 stars, perfecto!

I really liked this. I didn't use any ground beef and used one pound sweet Italian sausage cause I'm whimpy about spiciness. Super easy to make. I only had access to a large can of crushed tomatoes with basil so I used those instead of the diced. Added some Italian spices since I didn't use the tomatoes with the basil, garlic and oregano. The fresh basil really adds nice flavor so if possible don't omit. Preboiled my pasta so it didnt soak up my lovely soup. After cooked and drained, added it to the soup. This recipe is great but is also a good starting point to add other veggies and/or different beans. Update- even better second and third days. Had for lunches and enjoyed every drop!

This was absotootly delish!  I was worried my husband wouldn't like it but he went back for seconds and took leftovers to work the next day!  I did leave out the ground beef (too much meatiness for the wife), used frozen chopped spinach and added about 2 cups of pasta to recipe (vs. a half cup).

This is one of our favorite quick dinners.  I have never tried it with the ground beef & sausage though, sounds too heavy.  I use one package of the Open Nature brand Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausage.  I cut the sausage in half length wise and then slice into slices.  I also use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of two 14.5 oz cans....much easier.  Have added chicken also a few times along with the sausage & it is wonderful either way.  I also use either wide egg noodles or mini farfalle.

Easy to make and very tasty. What I did differently was I cooked the pasta separately and added it later.

I've made this a couple of times and it's still great! The family always goes back for seconds and then there is still enough for left overs. It's just as good the next day!

I used MOST of this recipe, based on what I had on hand. It was great! I only had about 1/4 pound of Italian sausage, no fresh basil (dried), no fresh spinach (frozen), and Parmesan versus Romano. I added a dash of crushed red pepper flakes, some kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. Still, it was great with substitutions. I think this is a very forgiving recipe for adjustments!

This was fantastic! So tasty and satisfying. You don't need oil at the beginning-the meats will have enough (even lean ground beef). I used dried basil and 2/3 cup dried white navy beans (2 cups after I cooked them). I omitted the pasta and cheese (not in the diet). I also confused my grocery list and ended up with 1 plain can of diced tomatoes, so I used one seasoned and one plain and just sprinkled in some extra oregano (didn't think it needed more basil or garlic :P). This had so much flavor and tasted great days later and even after being frozen and defrosted.

Hearty! To make it healthier, use Turkey Keilbasa, omit ground beef. Used regular kidney beans, different pasta, and Parm cheese and it turned out great.

This certainly was the prettiest soup I have ever made!  Based on the reviews of my mother, husband and son I have given this 5 stars.  Way easy to make, and they all raved over it.  I did not have any sausage, just used the ground beef.  I was unsure about it since just about every other recipe on this site that I have tried with rave reviews really is not good to me.  Was very pleased that this one was not like those. 
Not sure if it makes a difference in taste at all but when I originally read it I thought the beans were the great northern ones so i used those.
Will definitely make again...correction, my husband said I MUST make this again!

Great recipe.  Added some carrots and threw it in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours to let the flavors meld together.  I also used tortellini for the pasta and it came out great!

Phenom!  I was actually moved by this meal!  Cheesy I know! I am so happy I tried this, especially with the small number of reviews.  I did as others suggested and left out the ground beef and used only 1lb. ground salsiccia, added extra basil and oregano, used 1 1/2 cup pasta, a whole bag of pearl onions (whole) and the fancy swanson chicken stock.  Don't be leery, this is great!

Delicious!  I was skeptical of a soup having any flavor   after cooking for only 30 minutes, but the juice from the sausage was the magic trick!  This is definitely a keeper.

I thought the flavor of this dish was quite good, regardless of being worried about the lack of spices initially! Changes that I made was omitting fresh basil because I didn't have any though that would have been delicious; and I used Great Northerns instead of Cannellini's.   In the future, I will add an additional can of beans. They were definetely lost in all the meat of this stew.

This was easy and delicious.  I used ~1.25 pounds of both sausage and beef.  I used two cans of navy beans instead of kidney beans.  I used about 6 cloves of garlic. I used two bay leaves. I used a 28oz. can of mild Rotel instead of diced tomatoes. I added an extra 1/4 cup of broth. I used ~2 cups of cooked spiral pasta-cooked it separate and slightly underdone.  Was taking to a potluck, so I brought all ingredients to a boil as directed and then dumped into a crock-pot overnight for ~6-7 hours on low.  I then added ~7oz. of slightly chopped "young" spinach, slightly underdone pasta and ~1/2 cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. I transported to my venue and plugged in on warm for another 2 hours. Served with more Romano. There was plenty of flavor/kick, the beans weren't too mushy, and the pasta was just right.  The best part is that everyone loved it and went back for more (including me!)-no leftovers.  The key on the pasta is cooking it separate and adding it a little before serving.  If you had no flavor, I suggest buying a better quality hot sausage and maybe a different kind of diced tomatoes.  If you have a food processor, keeping fresh grated Romano/Parmesan is easy - grate an entire block and freeze - it can be used on most anything directly out of the freezer.

Awesome recipe, I will definitely be making this again soon! It was so quick and easy, and the flavors are wonderful. I used Italian chicken sausage and instead of spinach alone I used "power greens" which is a mixture of spinach, kale, and chard and it was great. We just put it in our bowls at the table and found ourselves adding more and more - yum! I love a soup that helps us eat more green leafy vegetables - that's rare!

Replaced the olive oil and basil with about 3T pesto because I didn't have fresh basil on hand, and used just Italian sausage for meat, otherwise prepared as written.  My husband went back for thirds, so I would say it was a success!

This is great! I added only a half pound of ground beef and a pound of italian sausage. I also added more broth about 5 cups because I added more noodles 1 1/2 cups. So I needed more broth for all those noodles. It was perfect! I also added a bit of heavy cream at the end and that really made it that much extra special.

Great soup! My husband does not like tomatoes, so I put in a yellow zuchinni in instead. It was marvelous, and it does look like too much meat initially, but it ends up being just right. I will be adding this one to the recipe book.

This is a staple in my house and all 3 of my kids eat it.  We usually serve it with a crusty bread.  I also leave out the cheese due to an allergy in the family, but it still tastes amazing!

I've made this a few times for my family and everyone seems to like really  it.  If you don't have chicken broth, beef or vegetable broth work just as well.  I didn't notice a difference.   I also added a lot of torn up kale..  mmmm very hearty and flavorful meal!

I made this and did make some changes according to what I had on hand as I was trying to clean out my freezer, but the recipe was a great base!  I reduced the recipe to 3 servings.  We eat meatless for the most part, so I only used about 1/4 lb mild breakfast sausage no ground beef, 1 small onion, 2-3 cups cooked pinto beans, 1 cup carrots, 2 cups spinach leaves.  I also used plain tomatoes and seasoned with 1 tsp each - garlic powder, dried oregano, & dried basil.  I added about 1/2 cup tomato sauce that needed to be used up too.   I forgot to add the pasta and cheese, but didn't miss either.  I would use this recipe again!

Love this soup recipe! I have made it several times - as is and with changes depending on what I had on hand. It's a very versatile recipe. I suggest making it as written the first time. When I made it I said "I can't believe I made this!" I have made it with different meats, different veggies, depending on my pantry and fridge. It was great every time. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious, love this recipe the way it is. If you don't want to use pasta, try serving over rice. Also, it works great as a crockpot recipe too, just cook up the meat combine it all in the crockpot then at the end cook and add noodles or serve over rice like I stated before.

I just made my first batch of this and I'm impressed! It takes like something that took much longer than the prep and cook time suggests! The hot sausage (I was lucky to find 1lb of just the meat, so didn't even have to deal with getting it out of the casing!) provides a nice bit of heat, this would be perfect for a winter meal. 

I swapped a few things: white beans for a six bean mix I usually have in the house, elbows for penne rigate, and spinach for kale. As some others have noted, kale holds up a lot better in soups than spinach. I also threw in a cup of diced celery to give it some more crunch, and cooked the pasta separately until halfway done before adding it to the pot. 

I can tell this will be a go-to recipe for cold weather and a must for freezer portions later.

Very good soup!!! The flavors (thanks to the fresh basil) were wonderful and I will definitely make it again. I substituted a couple things (doubled sausage amount and dropped the ground beef, 2 cans of beans versus beans plus pasta, baby kale for spinach). I think this is versatile enough for a lot of variations. Enjoy!!

I burned my tongue trying to taste it too soon as it smelled so good!  I like it a lot - scaled down from the amounts of meat called for because I was using fewer servings.  I read reviews and the only difference was I used kale instead of spinach.  Wahooo!  My first time using kale.

This is a great recipe.  I followed the recipe as written substituting homemade silvia beans (using the black bean recipe submitted by Ives on the all recipes website)for the can of cannellini beans.  Both recipes were delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Fabius flavor.  I only had sausage defrosted but that was enough to give it a great kick.  I used penne pasta and cooked extra separately because a half cup just didn't seem to be enough.  Kids and hubby devoured it, and there were plenty of leftovers.

It was good.  A bit salty but that could be remedied by the canned products you choose to use.  It is a quick, simple meal to put together after a long day of work.  thank you for the recipe.

GREAT!  I used 1 pnd sausage and no ground beef.  That was enough meat.  I don't think it needs the cheese and I will probably use chicken sausage next time.

A good, hearty soup. This recipe makes quite a bit, and the pasta and beans in the soup, once frozen, get pretty mushy when reheated. Still a regular on our menu though!

This is the ABSOLUTE BEST soup ever.  It is easy to make as well. I only had northern beans, dried, that I'd presoaked.  So, I was in a rush the night I made it.  I sauteed the meat & onion, then the garlic, brought the base to a boil, threw in a 350 degree oven and left the house for alittle over an hour.  When I returned, I tossed the noodles in, grated the cheese and then stirred in the spinach at the end.  This meal was a huge hit.  My husband says, "Its the best soup EVER."  Thanks, allrecipes.  You win again.  :)

I've made this twice.  I really can't say why it is rated less than 5 stars!  Follow the directions and don't complain about a recipe, if you've changed it.  The hot Italian sausage is a must!   The spinach gives it a peppery flavor - yum!

EXCELLENT soup. I made it pretty much to recipe and it's delicious!! Used a combo of baby spinach and kale because that's all the local mega Mart had. Was a great addition of flavor and color. Can't wait to make this again on some cold winter night!

This recipe is delicious!  Pretty easy and not too time consuming.  I always use sweet turkey sausage in it to keep the fat and calories down, but pork sausage really gives an extra boost of flavor.  This one is a keeper!

I did not use the ground beef as the sausage was plenty. Needed salt but otherwise was beautiful and delish.

Use 3/4 less cumin and stewed tomatoes as directed and not pureed tomatoes. Also recommend using red kidney beans and 1/4 cup extra on noodles

Totally flavorless until I added A LOT more seasoning. Followed the recipe exactly and found it to be very bland. Had to doctor it up with lots more dried basil and added dried oregano, bay leaf and garlic powder, as well as black pepper. Probably will not make again. Kids wouldn't touch it. Also looks unappealing.

This is amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using mild Italian sausage instead of hot because my husband doesn't like spicy.  It has wonderful flavor!  It does thicken up quite a bit after being refrigerated overnight, so I think I will add more broth next time.  Delicious!

I thought this was really good and even my 9 year old loved it. I used ground pork and added Italian seasonings and some chili powder. Also used Parmesan instead of Romano cheese.  I will make this again soon!

I think the ratio of meat, beans, pasta and spinach is simply perfect. Love the taste and ease of making this dish.

This soup is great! I don't think there is too much meat at all.  I don't like really spicy so I only added 1/2 lb of hot sausage and replaced the other half with more ground meat. I also used dried basil and italian seasoning.  Excellent! will be making this again and again.

I have never reviewed anything on this site.... Use it at least 1x a week for meal ideas........ This one was AMAZING! So simple and easy yet packed with flavor and filling for my husband who always says soup leaves him feeling unsatisfied even if he loves it! No ground beef for me and doubled the Chik broth added red kidney beans and some crusty toasted bread it was heaven thanks for a recipe I finally HAD to review!

LOVED this!  Hearty and makes the house smell great.  I halved the recipe and used a little extra stock to make it more soupy (just a personal preference).  The spinach in it is fabulous, but I would imagine if you don't have any it would still be fantastic without.  I was not sure about "cooking the pasta until done" with the heat set on low, so I boiled my pasta separately and added right before the spinach. Oh, and I only had bowties on hand.  A little red pepper flakes for my taste was great, too!  YUM!

My family absolutely loved this!  I made very little changes to make it more Weight Watcher friendly.  I used 93% lean ground beef and sweet italian turkey sausage that I removed from the casing.  I made garlic croutons to serve along side of this for everyone else.  So easy, filing and delicious!

I love this recipe!! I've made it several times now and will be making it again, and again. The only change I've made is to use ground pork sausage (like Jimmie Dean's) instead of the cased, link sausage. It's a terrific recipe!! Just be sure to have lots of fresh crackers on hand!

Love, love, love this dish! Used beef broth instead of the chicken, also didn't have hot sausage so used mild with red pepper flakes, used the ground beef as well as sausage and kale in place of spinach. Previous reviewer was spot on, the kale stands up well, makes you feel like you're chewing on something substantial. This is going into my "keeper" file!

I've made this twice and it's been a hit both times. I make it without the ground beef and it's still a hearty, filling soup. Very flavorful.

This is a great recipe. It is very hearty.  I did not change anything within the recipe and it was perfect. Instead of Romano cheese, I served it with Parmigano-Reggiano Parmesan Chesse and it was delicious. You must try this recipe.
