I had to make a couple of changes, and I'm glad I did, or this dish would be very bland.  First, I boiled the chicken for about 15 minutes, the cut it into huge chunks and threw it into a hand blender.  It made it into small shreds, but a nice uniform size, and took a lot less time than hand shredding the chicken - I'm not a fan of chunks.  At the same time I put basmati rice into a rice cooker so both the chicken and rice were done at the same time.  Then I used half a can of cream of chicken and half a can of cream of mushrooms, added a cup of mushrooms and a cup of chopped celery (which i sauteed while the rice and chicken were cooking) an extra 2 tablespoons of dill (I love the stuff) and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic.  Also, this recipe needs about 1/2 cup of milk and some major salt and peppering.  This recipe is really growing on me.  The more I eat it the more I really like it.  Even though the Ritz crackers heat up mushy in the microwave, it adds so much flavor I'm contemplating adding more.  Plus I ate this at my desk today, and someone followed me back to my desk, by the SMELL!!!!  Good stuff, thanks.  Great make ahead and freeze or save for the rest of the week-type meal.

This was really really good. I've never cooked with poppy seeds and only ever used dill of dip -- thanks for opening my eyes!!! I did use 1 soup can full of milk on the suggestion of other's reviews as well as about 1/2c chopped onion. Oh! and the topping I used garlic butter flavored Ritz crackers and my hubby who IS NOT a casserole type of guy loved it and actually ASKED for the leftovers the next day. This reheated wonderfully!!! Thanks so much so sharing!!!

We just had this recipe last night, we loved it! It was great comfort food. I did add 1/2 cup milk like some of the other reviewers did, and more dill. But I added a tbs of lemon juice to bring out the flavor more. It was a hit!

a wonderful generic chicken casserole dish, this can be played with so many ways. For example, add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and both sour cream and cream cheese.  I also have added sautee'd peppers and onion with garlic.  Peas are a nice addition to the rice, or once set up and ready for the oven, I lay out broccolli spears and whole skinned tomatos to give it a color contrast.  I use this as one of my buffett dishes.  BTW, use the water you boiled the chicken in for your rice.

This was one of the best casserole recipes I've ever made! I made this for my Bunco group and I'm always trying to find something different that will appeal to twelve different ladies. I did add one soup can of milk, some extra dill, and some chopped onion and celery and sliced mushrooms and a little garlic. I also made this up the night before, and refrigerated, then put on toppings and popped it in the oven (I needed one hour at 350 but also made a larger recipe). The flavor of the poppyseed, dill and the topping was so unique and delicious. This one goes in my permanent recipe collection.

Here's what I did different
I sauted 4 small zucchini, 1/2 lb. Crimini mushrooms, 1/2 med yellow onion in butter with garlic powder and salt to taste. Substituted cream of mushroom soup then mixed everything together. My family loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for a new way to inflict leftover turkey on my family when I found this one...it was very nice.    I added some extra dill, but that was the only change I made.  We all enjoyed this dish.

Adding the dill works wonders (it's left out in other recipes).  I make it a little healthier by using fat free sour cream, 98% fat free crm chicken, reduced-fat Ritz, and 1/4c light butter.  Tastes almost as good as the real deal :)

I can't say enough good things about this dish--we LOVE it!!!

Definitely add some milk (I added 3/4 of a soup can). 

I boiled 1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts in a 3 qt pot of water with 3 chicken bouillon cubes, some garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and seasoning salt until tender for about 1 hour (bring to boil and reduce heat to med-high). When chicken was done, I drained broth and shredded using two forks---it's so tender this way!!!!

Used basmati rice and cooked while chicken was cooking. 

Added extra dill, and seasoned with seasoning salt and pepper to suit our tastes. 

Used extra Ritz on top--they're so yummy!

Also, sauteed some celery and onion in olive oil and added to the mixture. 

PERFECT!!!!

Very good. A bit on the dry side though, and I even added a little milk. Next time, I'll add a little more. 
Definitely will make again!

I make a recipe similar to this.  Instead of regular rice I use Rice a Roni (Fried Rice Flavor).  You prepare the Rice a Roni like it says on the box.  I do not add dill.  I always get rave reviews.

VERY tasty but I found it a bit dry - next time I make it I will add some milk.  In addition, I chopped a small onion and one clove garlic, sauteed, and addded to the mix.  We really enjoyed this dish and will make it again.

We really liked it, except for the top.  It tasted burnt after baking.  The dill weed added a wonderful flavor.

I was tempted to use regular bread crumbs, but the smashed Ritz crackers are worth the extra few minutes.  I used one sleeve of crackers which was probably less than the recipe called for, but enough for my taste.

My husband cringed when I first said that we were having a turkey casserole for dinner; but after taking the first bite, he ended up eating 2 platefuls of it!  We just love this, and it's so easy to make!!  I also added 2 cans of mixed vegetables (drained) to the mixture, which proved to be a great addition to this recipe.  Will definitely make this again in the future if we have turkey leftovers.

This recipe smelled excellent but lacked appeal! I think it would be great if you added broccoli or some type of vegetable as everything was just white! The Ritz topping was very good.

Fantastic! Here's how I cooked the chicken...rinse, pat dry, seasoned with Trader Joes 21 seasoning salute. Then, in my dutch oven, I lightly browned on each side and added some chicken broth, brought to boil, then simmered for about 45 min. Cooled and cubed. I also cooked the rice in the same broth. Delish. I used only half the dill because hubs and I are not huge fans. I also added a tsp of crushed garlic and 2 tsp of lemon juice. This was a big hit and definetly something I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I can't believe this has so much flavor - and I didn't have poppy seeds.  Like other reviewers suggested, I added 3/4 cup of milk, it's easier for my kids to eat.

Great way to use up leftovers. I omitted the soup (can't do soybean) and added one very hastily chopped chicken boullion cube. Used a can of chicken that has been sitting on the shelf. Didn't have butter crackers, so I sauteed the stale Saltines some tiny child twirling through the house had left behind. My husband, who hates everything, declared that he liked it. Except the dill.

But I liked the dill. Good show.

I love poppy seed chicken, and this recipe is a good one. I think I may add some veggies into the casserole next time, to make it more of an all-in-one meal. Other than that, no changes necessary!

Very good stuff. It was such a nice change. I loved the dill. Next time I will try fresh dill. My kids did not care for it, but I will make it many more times. Loved it!

Didn't go over well in my house.  It might be good with crab meat instead of turkey but the combination didn't work for us.

Quite nice. I added lots of mushrooms, corn, red pepper and red onion.  Also, I added garlic and extra dill to give it more flavour.  I also used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken with some extra milk. We use brown rice as thats all we eat. Turned out great.  I will make again maybe next time with even more veggies! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very very good! I added onion and garlic to it and used homeade buttery croutons on top.

My husband loved it and that makes it another winner!  Will probably add a bit more dill next time. Also, I cut the recipe to serve 4 (since there are only two of us) and it worked out great!

Whenever I go to Honeybaker's restaurant I order the poppyseed chicken casserole. It is wonderful. I'm glad to report that this recipe is even better. It was very easy to make and I loved the crunchy topping. I think it would be good with mushrooms and will try it next time.

This is pure comfort food.  I understand why some people may consider it bland, but this was exactly what my husband was craving one night and it hit the spot--again, it's just good comfort food.  Not gourmet.   I threw several boneless skinless chicken thighs in a crockpot with chopped up celery and carrots and cooked on low for 5-6 hours, then shredded the chicken.  I used reduced fat condensed soup and sour cream, and upped both the poppy seed and the dill measurements.  I also used the juice from one lemon.   I did not add any milk, and did not think it was dry, but that could be because I used thighs instead of breasts.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I've had regular poppy seed chicken casserole before and I have to say, I like it a bit better than this recipe. The thing that got me was the dill weed smell. I've made monkey bread for the dill weed before and it made me think I was eating that instead. But other than that, it was good.

I've had your recipe since 2001.  It tasted very bland then. But with the high scores you've gotten, it looks like I'd better try it again (maybe I've made some mistakes).  If it tastes better, I will gladly grade your recipe again.  Thanks for taking the time to put it here and share it with so many people.

This recipe is GREAT!  My husband is VERY picky and he LOVES this one!  His family has a version using cream of mushroom, and he has always hated the mushroom part, so using the cream of chicken in this one is PERFECT!!

This dish was excellent.  My 8 year old daughter who tends to be picky, said it was great.  I added sauteed mushrooms, celery and onion.  I used cream of mushroom soup and used Basmati rice.  It's an easy recipe to modify with what you have in your house.  I did add the extra milk.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes. I always boil two bone-in chicken breasts in salted water, then use the broth to cook the rice. I do add 1.5 cups of milk, one tablespoon of lemon juice, one tablespoon of garlic paste, 2 teaspoons of onion powder and some salt and pepper. I also use the cream of chicken soup with herbs in it to add a little more flavor. My husband is underfoot from the time the chicken comes out of the pot until the casserole comes out of the oven, sneaking little bites every time I turn around! Oh...I often double the Ritz cracker topping per his request.

Bland ... added freshly ground pepper, a pinch of ceyenne pepper, some onlion, celery, peas, cut up carrots, mushrooms and garlic which seemed to give it a bit more flavor, and it was much better.  Did not like the topping, so just used bread crumbs mixed with more pepper

I will admit I did not eat this after baking it, but I was making freezeable meals for a friend who had a death in the family & who has 2 small children- I normally make a version of this using wild rice, cream of mushroom & curry powder but thought that kids might not be too into that, so I tried this one. Made accdg to recipe and it was definitely bland (at least prior to baking), so I doctored it up a little w/ salt & pepper, some white wine (which I used in the other recipe), more dill & a little lemon juice. It definitely had more flavor then , but I guess I'll have to wait & see if they eat it or toss it!

This was not my favorite it was a great comfort food but it was a bit dry i added a can on milk like other reviews suggested but it still seemed a bit dry. I've never cooked with dill before but i did enjoy it i did add extra dill. I think that next time i cook this i will try adding shredded chesse to the top of it and probably more milk.

It was edible. Not much flavor at all, I added pepper, broccoli, garlic and parmesan shredded cheese. I will not make this again unless altering it completely therefore it would not be the same recipe.

Great casserole, THANKS!!!  I do like to spice things up, so I added some red pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and cut back on the dill.  I used low fat sour cream and cream of chicken soup.  Next time, I'll add a half a can more of the soup instead of the extra milk for more flavour.  Thanks again!

This was not popular even with onion and extra seasoning.   My husband said he really didn't care for it, and he graciously praises almost every meal I cook.   My teenage son ate it without complaint.  My teenage daughter complained (not unusual).  My 5 year old who is a good eater didn't care for it.   I ate it, but I didn't want anything to do with the leftovers nor did anyone else.

I made this for the second time last night and I have to say that both my husband and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  I used reduced-fat sour cream, 1/3 cup of butter, low-sodium reduced-fat cream of chicken, 2/3 cup milk, and a little garlic powder.  I think that I will use a little more garlic and dill next time because it is still a touch bland to me.  I ate the leftovers for lunch today, and they were just as good, if not better, than the casserole was last night.

This recipe is wonderful. Very easy. Instead of using chunky chicken I shredded mine and added one bag of chopped frozen spinach to it and my family loved it. This was the second time I tried this recipe and it's great either adding more ingredients to it or just following the recipe. Your family and friends will love it. A +++.

This has become one of my go to recipes when invite friends over for dinner.  my guest always like it and dont hesitate on getting seconds.  delicious!  I usually double the recipe but half the chicken to make it cheaper.  I also add 1/2 cup milk.

We really enjoyed this. Did add half a cup of milk. Next time I think I would try some sauteed celery and onion. I would possibly double the rice/soup mixture as well. Thanks for a great recipe

This was delicious! I prepared as directed, except I cooked the rice in the microwave, and I stirred 2 cups frozen broccoli into the casserole. We ate this back to back for dinner and lunch the next day -- it was that yummy! Update: The second time I made this, I didn't have leftover chicken, so I just quickly poached the chicken breast in water. My husband noticed the difference! To avoid the blandness the third time, I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with a little garlic salt. Again, none of this is necessary with leftover chicken that already has some seasoning.

This recipe was delicious! I made some changes like some of the other reviewers suggested...I added milk, more dill, and a bit of lemon juice. My family loved it!

This recipe was just ok- it's just a bit bland for my taste.  I added 1/2 cup milk as suggested by others and used much less chicken, and brown rice instead of white.  It wasn't dry like some people reported, probably because I used chicken thighs which are a bit greasier than chicken breast. Adding garlic powder and more crushed crackers seemed to help- I used vegetable-flavored water crackers which were pretty flavorful.

My grandson is FUSSY, and he just told me this is the best thing he has ever eaten!  I did find it necessary to add 1 soup can of milk, and I had more than 8 oz. of sour cream left so I added maybe 10 ounces instead.    Everything else I did exactly as the recipe said.  WONDERFUL!!

This was the first recipe I made off of allrecipes.com, and it was great!  I made it for a house warming party for my parents to prove that I could cook, and they bought it! ;o)  Delicious!

My family and I found this to be very bland.  I couldn't get any of my three kids to continue eating it!
