The absolute star of the show in terms of tonight's dinner.  As this recipe's first reviewer I say wow, these are some great potatoes!  (Me thinks it just might have a little something to do with the cheese and especially the bacon)  I confess I did not make a point to shop for and find the "Dietz & Watson Roasted Garlic Cheddar Cheese," choosing instead to use an awesome Gruyere.  I made a small amount of this recipe, using the buttery tasting Yukon Golds, and baked it in a small, oval ramekin.

I had this recipe in my shopping list for some time, but could not locate the specialty cheese.  This is what I did because I was determined to make this, and try to be fair in my rating.  I used golden potatoes because they are my husband's favorite.  Skipped bacon because I can't have it, but I am sure it would take it over the top.  I did everything else the same except I used a quality plane flavored sharp cheddar cheese and for the salt I used garlic salt.  I hate the mess of making mash potatoes, but it is so rewarding in the end.  I am freezing half of the uncooked potatoes in small containers for several meals as it is just my husband and I.  Enjoy!

Very delicious, I used Boars Head Roasted Garlic Cheddar from the deli counter and had them cut me a block of it. I didn’t use chives but followed the recipe for everything else.

Oooohhh my gosh these potatoes are DELICIOUS!!!! I didn't shop brands but bought quality ingredients.  Since the recipe called for Garlic Cheddar Cheese,....I used sharp cheddar cheese and roasted a bulb of garlic in the oven while I prepared the bacon.  This is comfort food at it's finest!!!! Health freaks beware!!!!!  This is a fabulous fat infused potato casserole at it's finest!!!!

The family loved these mashed potatoes. The only change I made...sorry... I couldn’t find the garlic cheddar so I roasted 2 heads of garlic and used a good sharp cheddar but followed the directions for everything else. Definitely a keeper. Thank you!

Husband not a big fan of scalloped potatoes but he loves it done this way. I didn't use bacon subbed in sauteed ham and onion with lots of butter. Used less sour cream and cream cheese, lots of shredded cheese on top. Boiled potatoes with garlic powder for that taste.  Will make again. Yum Yum.

This was a hit with everyone but my 2 youngest who decided they didn't like...bacon  (I'm beginning to question their parentage.)  I had to substitute plain cheddar and some garlic powder as I  couldn't find the garlic cheese.   I also used a little more bacon, less cream cheese and more sour cream than called for.

Made it exactly according to the recipe.  Next time I'll use less cream cheese and likely cut the recipe in half.
