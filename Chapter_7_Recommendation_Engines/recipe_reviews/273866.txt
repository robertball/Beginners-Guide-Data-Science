Double the vinegar and you have a 5 star recipe all the way. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of beets and didn't expect to love this but  this recipe was excellent! Each vegetable absorbed the vinegar in their own way. I threw in a handful of mushrooms that needed used and they worked well in this too.
