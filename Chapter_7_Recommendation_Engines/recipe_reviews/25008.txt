So good I could eat this with a spoon! Since the frosting doesn't call for butter, and I did want a white frosting, I used Hi-Ratio shortening, clear vanilla and some butter flavoring. I made 1-1/2 times the recipe (for Mini Oreo Surprise Cupcakes) and used an egg white for part of the water called for, then just added water without measuring exactly until I had the consistency I wanted for piping. This was creamy, fluffy, and pleasantly sweet and flavorful, with no greasy mouth feel. (I highly recommend Hi-Ratio Shortening for frostings like this) I've made some fine white or buttercream frostings from this site and this one truly stands out as one of the best. I ended up with some frosting leftover, but believe me it will NOT go to waste!

This frosting is exactly what it says...."white decorator frosting". It is very sweet, not much flavor (but that's how white decorator frostings are), and it's a good consistancy. I used milk instead of water and added a little more than 4 TBS until I got the consistancy I wanted. I chose this because I was out of butter and needed a recipe that didn't call for it.

This is the best frosting ever!!!! Here in The Netherlands, whe don`t know a lot about frostings and icing and so whe don`t have a lot of things that you can buy in the US or UK but for all the people in Holland there`s a tip: Shortening can be replaced by creamy butter or as whe call it "roomboter".
Thanx for this great recipe.

Mediocre.  Its a little grainy and doesnt taske sweet. I would use 1/2 butter/margarine and 1/2 shortening also add more vanilla extract lots lots more.  that improves the taste.  looks nice on cakes though

One word---FABULOUS!!  I made this frosting for a group, and everyone raved about it!!  It tastes just like the frosting you get on store-bought cakes.  I also made a chocolate version--used milk instead of water, and added about 1/4 cup cocoa, and the results were equally as wonderful!

Easy and quick recipe (my favorite kind!) and tasted great too.  Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 Smart Balance veg shortening.  Also subbed 1/2 of the water for heavy cream.  Needed a few extra drops for the right consistency.  Frosting is pretty, spreads well and looks great with decorations.

FABULOUS!! I made two white 8" round cakes and topped one with this delicious frosting and angel flake coconut.  It looked so beautiful!  On the other one, I used a little red food coloring to make a strawberry cake with pink frosting.  I decorated it with fresh strawberries. This frosting is so versatile; goes on smoothly and is so fluffy! My husband and grandkids loved their cakes!  Will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this based on the rave review by naples and because i needed a white white frosting (my go to is Butter Cream II from here and it uses butter so it's not white white).  My grocery store doesn't carry the Hi-Ratio shortening, so I was stuck using Crisco.  This is ok, but def has the greasy telltale shortening consistency.  I may use again when I need white white, but will stick w/Butter Cream II as my go to frosting.  EDIT:  I've since amended my rating to 5 stars....the difference?  Hi ratio shortening!  It makes all the difference in the world.  I also now add a dash or two of butter flavored extract to this frosting, as well.

I'd actually like to give this only 4 stars because it does NOT frost a 2 layer cake. After I frosted the bottom layer I had to make an additional bowl of frosting. However, this is very easy to make and is very airy and light. It frosts really nicely. Just be sure to double the recipe if you're wanting to frost a whole cake.

Great frosting!  I had a big bag of confectioners' sugar and thought 16 oz. meant 2 cups!  Don't make this mistake.  16 oz. is actually about 4 cups!  Still delicious though once I added the right amount!  I think I'd prefer with butter instead of shortening but soooo good!

Excellent! Perfect white frosting in under 5 minutes. I needed a pure white frosting and did not have clear vanilla so I went with Almond Extract and it worked out great. I was very generous with the frosting on the cupcakes I used this on and received many favorable comments about it not being overly sweet and having great flavor and texture. This one will definately be used again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Made this to put on 24 Rainbow Cupcakes and had plenty left over.  I used clear vanilla and butter flavored shortening.  The icing came out off-white, so if you want pure white icing, use white shortening. 

The flavor was really good and the butter flavor was a welcome addition.  I didn't think it was too sweet - granted each person will have a different perspective on what constitutes "too sweet".  If it helps, I'm more of a carb-addict than a sugar-addict, so I would say my taste buds are more sugar sensitive than those of you who crave sweets.  

I needed to add more water because it was just too difficult to ice the cupcakes w/o destroying them with just the 4 T of water as the recipe called for.  Easy enough though.

All in all, I'd definitely use this again.

I tried this recipe and it was ok. I even found an amazing, delicious way to make it better. 1st of all I know it doesn't sound like it would taste good, but I used this recipe plus I added sour cream and almond milk! It was soooooooooooooooo tasty!

worked great! I made it exactly as stated. I think that next time I will add a little more flavoring. I can still taste the shortening (I used the butter flavored shortening). Butter frosting is still the best but this is a great quickie!!

I'm a big fan of butter (you can tell by my backside) but was out and needed to frost 60 cupcakes ASAP. Made this and it's great! I mixed it up in my Kitchen Aid and once it was combined, I swapped the beater for the whip and WHIPPED IT REAL GOOD (sorry) and it's super light and fluffy! I added the vanilla called for and then just a skoonch of Almond extract to hide the Crisco flavor and give it that "what IS that??" thing. This is for 6 year olds so all they care about its sugar and food coloring. However, I really dug the taste, too. 4 stars because, to be fair, it would be better with butter, but still dang good.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for, it is so delicious, I did not have butter on hand and most white frosting's I found called for that. I did have butter flavored shortening and regular vanilla extract other's called for clear vanilla extract, I did not have that. I made only slight adjustments, I only needed enough for the inside of a chocolate cake, so I halved the recipe, also I used cold milk instead of warm water and I scraped 1 Madagascar vanilla bean for an extra punch of vanilla flavor, I found myself licking everything I could it was so good! Recipe was also so quik and easy. This recipe is a keeper, I can't wait to try it with other recipes. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Laura B. :)

this frosting is very very tasty, but i think maybe i beat it too long or not long enough, becasue when i stopped beating it, it looked like it was seperating and looked very grainy, BUT..... tasted smooth and was oooh so good, does anyone know what i did wrong?  did i stop beating too early or not beat too long??

AWSOM for decorating and the taste is really good, too. Gave one less star because it dries up really quick once it's on the cake.  It's a keeper for me but some may not like the drying effect. Not sure what to do about that.

Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! It was so easy and fast to make, did not take more then 5 minutes. Like someone else says I added a little more then 4 TABLESPOONS of water until I got the consistency I wanted. The only other thing I noticed was the amount of frosting I ended up with. For me it was plenty enough to do cupcakes but not quite enough to do a whole cake, I would increasing the servings to 18!

By far the best recipe for icing I have ever found!  Since I usually double it, I use half butter and half shortening, and a little more water to make it the consistency I like, but other than that I would not change a single thing about this recipe!

I used this icing for some Halloween cupcakes I made, so I colored them orange. I used twice as much milk as it called for, and it was still a little bit too thick. It was very filling even though I only put a little on top. That's the only thing I'd change though.

Yummy and fluffy.  I beat it extra long to make it light and fluffy.  I wasn't sure how much 16 oz of confectioners sugar would be in cups.  I stopped at just under three cups and it was great!

This was very creamy and nice tasting.  I added a tad more sugar.  For me, the shortening gave it a bit too much of a greasy after feel in the mouth.  Next time I will try it with butter.  My guests loved it though!

Wow that was easy! I had bought a store bought container but it wasn't enough for a double layer cake. I used margarine instead of shortening, it was so easy and tastes so good I wish I hadn't bought the first canister.

Yum! and easy. I didn't have a problem with the amount of powdered sugar. I thought the consistancy came out just fine, unlike a few other reviewers. However, I used real butter and milk instead of water and shortening.

This frosting was YUMMY! and the perfect consistency - fluffy! I substituted milk for the warm water and I used 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Delicious! All the mom's at my 4 year old's B-day party had 2 pieces! Used it with whipped cream cake from this site -- my new favorite recipes for cake and frosting! Three people asked for the recipe. :)

I used this frosting for my son's 1st birthday cake. It was very easy to prepare and use. It's great to use for something kids will eat because it doesn't require egg whites. The taste got rave reviews from family and friends as well.

Used 3:1 shortening/butter (3 tbsp. shortening, 1 tbsp. butter). Used milk instead of water. Mixed shortening with butter first, then gradually added sugar and milk. Perfection! Delicious and piped easily! I think if you were spreading it, you would need more liquid, but for piping it was perfect!! (Probably added more vanilla... more like 2 tsps!!)

Wonderful!  I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of water to make it a little easier to spread, but of all the frosting recipes I've tried, this is by far the best!  My husband, who is (insanely) not a frosting guy even liked it. :)

I've made this recipe before and really like it.  I don't usually make just white frosting, so I made the following adjustments to the recipe:
-substituted butter for shortening.
-added 1 TBSP of food coloring for 1 of the 4 tablespoons of water.
The frosting tastes great.  You can also refrigerate it to use later.

I made SEVEN batches of this today for my daughter's 2nd birthday 1/2 sheet cake, and a dozen cupcakes (nut-free decorations).  Quick to prepare, great taste, and took color like a charm! I think this frosting might actually keep me away from pre-colored icing tubes from now on!

This is the best recipe I have found.  My son has tons of food allergies - so happy we found a frosting he can eat.  He is 6 and today was the first time he has had frosting.  Followed the recipe exactly.

As Manon stated: People from Belgium or Holland can use cream butter (roomboter a.k.a. melkboter a.k.a. ongezoute boter ...) OF Ik heb ergens gelezen dat iemand de welbegeerde 'shortening' in de makro heeft gevonden ^^

Whenever the kids do something great at school, we celebrate by decorating cupcakes together, usually I am not as adventurous to make my own frosting other than for sugar cookies, but i was out and this recipe was a great quick fix! The only thing I changed was for flavoring. Because it is a rather bland frosting, i mixed in a box of cherry jello and it turned out AMAZING on our chocolate cupcakes! The kids called them Cherry covered choclates! Big big hit with the kids! Thank you!

A very good basic frosting recipe.  I doubled this recipe for a 2 layer cake. I used half butter flavored shortening and half regular and it was still white, despite the yellow coloring of the butter flavored shortening.  I colored some with food dye for decorating the cake.  Since I'm not a cake decorator, I just did the basic piping and wording.  I had plenty of frosting left over.  To me, this tastes just like the frosting you would get in a grocery store bakery cake.  Very good for my purposes.  Can't wait to try to make chocolate frosting and more from this recipe.  I don't think I'm ever going to buy canned frosting again!

This worked out great - easy and perfect for decorating.  No problems making it, followed the recipe exactly.  Does taste a lot like the icing on the store bought cakes though.

Followed the instructions exactly and this came out both watery and grainy. By the time I'd beaten it and gotten it into the piping bag, the ingredients had separated. Had to scrape off my cupcakes and use another recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I followed it exactly and it came out delicious.  It's sweet like bakery frosting but I think it tastes better.  I will definitely be using it again!

Very Tasteless.  After reading other reviews, I can't say that I expected anything more though.  I was in a hurry and this was one of the few recipes that called for ingredients I had on hand.  Consistency was good, and it set up nicely.  Just wish it had more flavor.

I like it, but if u used it like that it has a shortening flavor so i add a little bit of butter like 1/4 cup and some whipped cream like 1/3 and a little bit more powder sugar, and like 1 teaspone of vanilla, it will make it more creamy and better taste like a vanilla frosting   hpe this is better....

Terry Its maybe because your water may have been to warm or that you used warm watter and it may have caused it to melt down the sugar a little.

Great recipe for a general glaze or icing but not really a firm frosting to decorate or frost a cake with. I used it for my moms mothers day cake and it was great since she doesnt like a thick frosting.

I followed the recipe exactly. It went on well and looked beautiful, but it tasted exactly like what it was... sugar flavored shortening. Not so appetizing. I will try it with butter next time- that sounds much better.

Taste was good but I didn't like the consistency very much - too wet, not very buttery. It dried okay, but more like a glaze than a frosting.

Absolutely perfect. I've always made a similar recipe (just tossed margarine, icing sugar, vanilla, and milk in a bowl), but it's nice to have an idea of measurements! And it didn't turn out quite as sickly-sweet as I'm used to. I used margarine instead of shortening, more like 1 teaspoon of vanilla, milk in place of the water, and I didn't measure the icing sugar. I just poured some in, beat it, poured more, beat more, etc, until I got the consistency I wanted. If it gets too thick, just add a little more milk. I used a stand mixer and beat it on medium for about five or six minutes, then added some blue and green food coloring. It came out awesome and iced the 23 cupcakes I made. Thanks, Laura. :)

I read the other reviews and was worried about using so much shortening in the frosting so I substituted 1/4 c. butter for part of the shortening.  I could definitely taste the shortening in this frosting and I wouldn't make it again this way.  In my opinion, it would be much better if you substituted butter for the shortening.

My family found this to be delicious cake frosting.  My husband actually complimented it...which means that it was really good!  

I like this recipe because it is not too sugary.  I could actually eat the frosting from the bowl and enjoyed it!

Used butter instead of shortening, whipping cream instead of water and added unsweetened cocoa powder  for the chocolate and red food coloring for the pink - brilliant and yes, a little grainy however I feel that it was partly the texture that made it oh so good. I used this frosting to top brownies cupcakes and vanilla cupcakes

I made this recipe with a friend to ice a cake with, but we had to put in like 1 bag of sugar in, and it tasted sickeningly sweet. This recipe is good as a glaze or icing, but it is much to thin to ever be called cake frosting.

I only used half the liquid that it called for and it was perfect.  It's actually sitting on the cake and not sliding off like a lot of my frostings do.  Love it.

This is Very close to Wiltons 'secret' frosting, but they add meringue powder. You Must start this frosting off by whipping the shortening, water, flavoring/coloring till it has the consistency of lotion, THEN add the sugar. If you don't NEEDED white frosting, you could use butter. Almond flavoring is a nice change as well.I love this frosting!

Really good frosting.  The good thing about it is that I was able to thin it with water to what I needed.  Some places I needed a thinner frosting than others.

I was looking for a vegan frosting recipe that didn't use margarine, as I had none on hand. This recipe is OK. I first made it exactly as the recipe called except I halved it and used Soy Milk instead of water. Like this, without any alterations, it tasted exactly like the shortening and had a very thick consistency. I added a lot more vanilla and a bit more soy milk. In the end it was an ok recipe that tasted pretty good with the vegan cupcakes. With my alterations, it would have recieved 4 stars. Without them, barely 2. Thanks for the recipe! xx

Great frosting!  I wanted a bit of butter flavor, so I used about 3 Tbls. of butter, and the rest shortening.  I added about 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring as well.  This was a perfect amount of frosting to frost a dozen of cupcakes, with about 1 cup left over (which I plan to use when I make my Valentine's cookies in a few days).  I will use this one again, that's for sure!

This is the first time I made frosting successfully.  It came out wonderful but I did not have any shortening so I used lard and butter.  Also we liked the thick consistency so we did not add all the water.  My husband said it tasted too much like sugar (which I liked) so he threw in some lemon juice and lemon extract.  No matter what it still tasted and looked fabulous.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

This frosting is verry yummy! I made it with butter instead of shortning and it give it a more buttery taste.... The only problem I had was that it was too liqudy and not thick... but I just put it in the freezer for 30 min to an hour and it comes out just fine!

This frosting was a huge hit! My mom told me that I could make my sister's graduation cake and I wanted it to look really nice. I bought piping tools, stuff to decorate the cake with, and a big cupcake pan. I never made frosting before and I was really excited to try it out. When we took the cake out and displayed it for everyone to see, people thought it was done by a professional! I was very glad to see not only did it turn out more than I would have thought but they enjoyed it as well! GREAT RECIPE!

My husband loves this frosting, it reminds him of the kind his mom makes.  It is super delicious.  I had problems with it being a bit runny, but my frosting skills are lacking, so most likely my fault & not the recipe - I had to frost the cupcakes and then put them in the freezer to keep the frosting from falling off (that was the 1st batch.. the 2nd was better, probably my water was too warm).  I used Earth Balance margarine, left out the salt and used regular vanilla - my frosting was a little more "earthy" colored, but absolutely delicious.

Very sweet but VERY good. I had to add a little milk to the final product because it was a bit grainy but I'm under the impression that I had more than a pound of sugar. Regardless, it was amazing and this is from now on my go to icing recipe.

Good flavor and easy to work with. It was nice and fluffy, which is just what I needed. I didn't have time to find Hi-Ratio shortening (whatever that is), so I used regular. It was a little greasy, but not greasy enough to kill the frosting for me. Thanks! :)

This turned out well for my purposes, although it was a bit too sticky for the light cake I had cooked, so I wound up tearing the cake in a few places. Next time I'll know to add some more water if this happens. However, the frosting also tasted a little salty.. I may have heaped a bit too much salt on the measuring spoon, but not enough to make much of a difference. I'd cut out a little salt next time.

Needed to make a quick frosting because the container in my pantry which I'd thought was unopened had been opened and halfway used and never refrigerated.  Not wanting to poison my guests, I had to find a recipe for white frosting for the star cupcakes I was making for our 4th of July party.  This fit the bill!  It was quick, easy and had a minimal number of ingredients.  It tasted like decorator cake frosting and the little kids certainly ate it all up!

I followed it except for I didn't know if I had a full pound of sugar or not.  I just kept adding some sugar and a little water at a time until I had used all of my sugar and the frosting was the right consistency.  Perfect and delicious!  There was enough frosting to cover a lamb cake (for Easter) in swirls.

Tastes great.  I Had to use alot more sugar though.  Without the extra sugar, it was runny and didn't even make enough to frost a whole cake.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla.

While the outcome of this icing was very good, I had to add an entire extra box of confectioner's sugar to the ingredients to get the icing to the correct consistency!  I followed the advice of another reviewer, and used milk instead of water, but I'm wondering if the problem didn't lie in the fact I didn't use shortening or real butter-- all I had was Country Crock, and so I used that.  After adding the extra sugar, the icing was very fluffy and tasted great on a chocolate cake, so all's well that ends well!
