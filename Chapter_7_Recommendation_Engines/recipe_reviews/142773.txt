I took SweetJam's suggestion and doubled the butter. I also added in more minced garlic. My family really liked this--NO leftovers. The sauce for this was incredible. Not something for every day but every once and a while, it's nice to indulge.

This was sooo yummy!  I used 1/4 c chicken broth instead of wine because I didn't have any wine.

Really liked this one.  I found that I needed to double the butter for a beautiful sauce.  Thanks for sharing this was really good.

So very good, and so simple to prepare.  I have NEVER liked tortellini in any dish until this.  I use 1 lb sliced baby bellas and 8 oz sliced button mushrooms, or whatever I find, but we love the mushrooms so I always add an extra 8 oz and double the sauce.   I use fresh basil ribbons when I have it on hand, but the dried is delicious, too.  My family loves this and I have made it several times now.

This was so easy and delicious. Didn't have button mushrooms or white wine, so I substituted two more portobellos and vegetable broth. It was still excellent. I will be making this again and again.

OMG this was quick and GOOD!  I used more garlic and butter, fresh basil instead of dried, and I used 4 portobellos and no button mushrooms.  Also, I added about a half cup of RF sour cream to the sauce at the end.  This was delicious and there were no leftovers!

Will definitely make this again! My mushroom-loving husband especially enjoyed this recipe!  I did make a couple changes, however (as seen in the picture I'll be posting). I got mini ravioli, because I found some for a good deal. Also, instead of using 1/2 lb  button mushrooms, I used a mix of white and crimini mushrooms. And, since I don't have wine, I used chicken broth instead.

I used chicken tortellini. This was good but a little on the dry side. I will double the wine if I make again. Thanks for posting.

The flavor is great, however, if you use the portions above, it's very dry. I doubled the wine, butter and garlic, and then added about a 1/2 tbsp of flour to thicken the sauce.

As another reviewer said that they used chicken bouillon because they did not have the white wine, so did I.  It was very good on the cheese tortellini.

This was really good but I made a few adjustments. I wanted a creamier sauce so I added cream of mushroom soup. Also used 3/4 cup of wine and also used more garlic. I didn't bother with the white button mushrooms either. Made it for my mom's birthday and she loved it!

I added 3 cloves of garlic  and one medium onion but it still was on the bland side. Could use some more seasoning of some kind.

I thought this was good, but it didnt have a whole lot of flavor. It seemed to be missing something. I think it needs more seasonings or something. You really have to like mushrooms for this one. The leftovers went to waste.

I would agree with another reviewer who said the recipe was easy but boring.  While not a bad recipe -- it's perfectly fine -- there's not really a lot to recommend it, and I won't be likely to try it again.  Besides not being too long on flavor, it came out a little dry when I tried it.  The leftovers were better when sprinkled liberally with balsamic vinegar.

Excellent! I used frozen tortellini with no problems and only 2 Tbsp butter.  The results were fantastic. Even my one-year-old loved it!

This was a huge hit with my family.  I couldn't find any button mushrooms in any of our neighborhood grocery store but used Ground Turkey & left over baked chicken (chopped it up), as a substitute and it was fantastic.  Everyone had seconds and my husband wanted to take some to work for lunch & he never does that.  This is a great recipe!  :-)

I used a mix of spinach and wheat cheese tortellini. I also doubled the garlic and used chicken broth instead of white wine and used half baby bellas and half button. Yummy! Will make again and again! Definitely a recipe you can play around with and use different tortellini for a variety. Will use wine next time next time for a extra flavor. Didn't this time because didn't have an open bottle and didn't want to open one for 1/4 cup. Thanks for the great recipe!

We really enjoyed these!  I doubled butter, basil, liquid (used chicken brother rather than wine) , and probably quadrupled the garlic.  I'm glad I did everything but the butter, it made the dish a little greasier than it needed to be but still pretty darn good!

Pretty good.  I doubled the sauce ingredients because of other reviews.  Used frozen tortellini and they were very good.  I also added a bit of italian seasoning and a bit more basil.  You have to like  mushrooms to enjoy this one (which we do).

I really loved this dish. I put my own little signature on it. I added shallots and only used portobello since I did not have button mushrooms.  I also used the mixted pasta(spinach;regular and tomatoe flavor).
I made this for 2 serving, however next time I am going to downsize this to 1 serving since I ate the whole thing.

I used two cloves of garlic, a generous dash of white pepper, and fresh basil.  Easy to make, but even with the additions, it probably isn't something I will make on a regular basis.

I modified this recipe quite a bit.  Used egg noodles instead of Tortellini, added milk with the wine and basil, and then added a tablespoon of cornstarch by mixing it with some of the sauce and then pouring it into the mixture.  Tossed in the cheese and then poured it over the noodles and tossed it all together.  Topped it with a little more cheese.  Delish.

Good side dish!  We used portabella tortaleni(sorry, can't spell) which went well with the baby bella mushrooms we used.  didn't use regular mushrooms cause baby bellas were all we had.  Kindda bland, but overall good.

This was a great easy meal.  I fixed portobello sandwiches earlier this week and needed to find some way to use up the leftovers.  I halved the amount of button mushrooms and added about a cup of steamed asparagus to the dish.  It was delicious.  We'll definitely make this again soon!

This is a really good recipe that I would definitely make again!  I didn't have any Green Onions in the house  when I made it.  I would make sure to add them next time as it tasted a little bland and I think the onions would perk it up a bit...but, it is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

I admit, I altered this a little too. After reading about doubling the sauce ingredients, I did the same but also changed the cooking order as well. I sautéed the mushrooms first in a butter/olive oil mix until tender then added a chicken broth - white wine hybrid to it. I didn't want burned garlic flavor, so that went in next with the basil. I then added  1/3 cup of half & half to thicken it up a little, let it simmer, and then added the parmesan cheese. Not too many changes. The end result was FANTASTIC! Cannot wait to make this again! Cheers

We had to double the butter to get more sauce.  We also used about 5 cloves of garlic.  It was kind of one-dimensional but very simple and quick.

This would have been better with more garlic and less basil.

Added in some orange pepper for color, and used broth instead of wine (all I had). Great start (although my husband's comment was still a bit bland...)

Great recipe! I only used 9 oz of cheese tortellini and it was the perfect amount for the sauce. I didn't have any white wine, so I used chicken broth instead and used all baby bella mushrooms. Instead of dried basil, I used fresh. Overall, delicious recipe, but warning you will get full super quickly off of just a little amount! I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good, I followed the recipe except substituting chicken stock for the white wine, which I didn't have.  My family enjoyed it and the left overs were very good - I even fed a hungry coworker who thought I was Martha Stewart!  : )  I recommend this one!  : )

It sounded really good but it was pretty bland.
