This was pretty good. I wanted to use up my ramen noodles I have in my food storage. Although, it wasnt until I got halfway through the recipe that I noticed it did not call for Ramen noodles.  Just the ramen seasoning.  So I just had to make changes.  I crushed up ramen noodles in its packaging, placed them on a baking sheet, and toasted them until they were golden brown.  I also had left over oven roasted brined turkey that I substituted for the chicken.  When making the dressing, I only used about 1/2 cup olive oil( eye balled it).  It might be ok with with the 1 cup, but I dont like to used a lot of oil on dressings.  I tasted the dressing and it was good but not great, so I added about 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil.  The baslamic vinegar gives this classic salad a nice change.  Thanks for the post.

Also I add the ramen noodles (crushed), 2 TBLS sesame oil, 1/2 c  sunflower seeds, and Splenda instead of sugar.  YUM have been eatting this for years. My original recipe came from  a dear friend in Seattle. Around 1993 or so.

I made this kind of quickly and forgot the ramen noodles, but added toasted almond slivers....liked those better! I felt it needed more taste, but didn't take the time to figure that out. Could be my taste buds, but over all I would definitely make it again as you can have anything with this slaw. It is also light and I could see myself keeping it in my fridge to munch on here and there. Yummy healthy stuff!

This is my favorite ramen cabbage salad because you use balsamic instead of vinegar or cider vinegar. The balsamic adds another depth to the  flavor.

I love these kinds of cabbage slaw dishes.  My husband was not so crazy about it.  You will have to try it and see.

Much to oily as written.  My children seem to enjoy it, so I may play with it, but I strongly disliked the oily coating in every bite.
