I decided to try this recipe after seeing lamb breast/ribs at Walmart (of all places!). It was $4 and some change for 2 rib slabs in one package.  I bought 2 packages (4 ribs total) and used the measurements in this recipe.  The lamb had really good flavors.  Only little change I made was to cut back on the cinnamon to 1/4-1/2tsp -would have been overpowering, in my opinion, if there was more than that.  I also added extra honey in the sauce and instead of broiling it in the oven, I finished it over a grill for some nice char.  This cut of meat is very fatty, but delicious nonetheless.

Awesome recipe all the spices were perfectly married together. My husband loved this and he's a very picky eater. I will make this again.

I found the directions a bit disorganized:  I skipped step 2 and went back to it after step 9.  I used small bowls for steps 2 and 3, and I rubbed the olive oil into the meat, then rubbed in the rest of the step-3 spices, rather then mixing the spices with the oil before rubbing them in. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The inside meat was extremely tender and delicious, and the spices were perfect.  Unfortunately, the "crispy" edge meat was dried-out and hard because it was over-done.  Next time I will reduce the temperature from 450 to 425 for the 20 minute 2nd roasting, and if it still looks too well done on the outside, I will omit the final 4 minutes under the broiler.  My side dishes were green beans and fennel, and oven-roasted red-skinned potato wedges.  I drizzled the parsley and vinegar sauce over the veges and potatoes as well as the lamb.  Delicious!

AMAZING!!! By far the best lamb I've had! The rub left us speechless and the sauce was ice on the cake for us. I was afraid I wouldn't like since I don't like many things with vinegar and I almost skipped it. I'm so glad I didn't!

This was a very good recipe. I've never tried lamb before and this was how I made it. Totally worth the time it took to make. Very tender in the middle and almost steak like on the outside but with a whole other taste. The best part of eating this was the different rich flavors from the seasonings that we added. This is a will make again recipe.

Made this tonight and dad came for dinner.  I'd never cooked or eaten lamb before so this was a first for me.  Finished it on the grill.  Wasn't bad, a little fatty for my tastes but the flavor was good.  Will have to try it with chops.

Great recipe. Thank you! Minus the fat and bones from one slab, it works out to be about the size of a deck of cards. Best tasting deck of cards I've ever had.

This recipe is really good, with some slight difference I made. While the cut of the lamb wasn't our favorite, the sauce that this made was good and will try this again with a less fatty cut of meat. I have a habit of not measuring my ingredients, rather eye-balling things instead and deciding what amounts of each ingredient I prefer. I didn't have any coriander on hand, and I also added some chopped mint. In a food processor I blended all of the ingredients together to create a sauce which I added a few minutes before taking it off of the grill. Very flavorful, aside from the greasy-ness of the fat.

Great recipe, but I did reduce the cinnamon to ¾ tsp as i dont love cinnamon, glad I did as the result was perfect. I would suggest watching it under broiler as 3-4 minutes was way too long for me, 1 minute was good otherwise it would have been burnt!

Ya'll, I would usually submit a picture of the dish along with my review, but to be completely honest with you, it didn't last very long on my plate!  Before I knew it, I had eaten it all!.   For those of you who have not yet tried this dish, YOU MUST!  I almost spent $20 on a piece of lamb yesterday until I came across this cut of lamb I had never tried before.  For $5 I thought I'd take the chance and try it out.  WOW!  Chef John really knows his stuff!  This is an amazing, moist,and rich dish.  Thanks Chef!!!!

I personally haven't ever cared for the gamey taste of lamb.  But the love of my life requested lamb yesterday, although I've never prepared or cooked lamb myself.  This was the recipe that he asked me to use and I followed it to a T. --- This is the best lamb I've ever tasted and the men in my family loved it!  This may just end up as a Holiday Dish for my family! Yum!

Very good recipe.  Def a keeper. Going to try with lamb chops, leg of lamb chops roasted in oven would be a good choice.

Insanely delicious! My husband loved how crispy the top got while the meat was super tender inside and raved about the parsley sauce. I would trim a bit more fat off next time though as it was pretty fatty or choose a more meatier piece from the store. It was very rich and seemingly indulgent for two otherwise healthy eaters. We'll save a decadent dish like this for about once a month so our cholesterol doesnt sky rocket!

This was a fabulous recipe!  Previously, we just grilled a lamb breast w/olive oil, salt and pepper. Disappointing.  So, for round two we came to Chef John.  Like always, he did NOT disappoint!  Yay!  We loved it.  Slow cooking with the rub was definitely the winning method.  Like another reviewer--we drizzled the sauce on our roasted red potatoes. It was even delish on the green beans with smoked pork jowl. Bonus: A wonderful use for the grass-fed lamb right from our own farm!! So, keep the lamb recipes coming Chef John! :-)

This recipe is incredible. I made only one alteration to add white wine in place of white wine vinegar. For a side dish, seared asparagus and carrots in olive oil and rogan josh seasoning. A $16 dish for two with leftovers to spare, I wouldn't escape a restaurant without paying $60-$100 for something this lavish. Thank you chef John!

Recipe is very tasty and easy to follow.  Our cut of lamb was about a third smaller but we used the same amount of rub and it turned out great.  The vinegar sauce really added a fabulous flavor to compliment the meat.  Open a nice bottle of hearty wine and enjoy!!!

I made this tonight and just got done eating it.  I cooked it exactly as instructed, making no modifications.  It turned out to be alright, but it was missing something.  I think it could be a bit more sweet to balance the flavors better.  I will try a different recipe next time, but may come back to this if I can't find something better.  I'm thinking of using my pork belly recipe that consists of a fennel honey.

This is amazing!  I marinated the lamb overnight. It  turned out perfectly. I roasted the potatoes and vegetables as side dish.  My 13 yrs son loved it and ate one slab!

I prepped the lamb, season it, in the morning as I had a busy day and just wanted to be able to past by, between jobs, in the afternoon and pop it in the oven so it would be ready when we got home that evening. I also put in 1/2c water and potato’s, onions and carrots around the lamb. It was delicious, the flavour that the veggies took on was really yummy. Sadly I was so busy I forgot to do the sauce but it didn’t matter every one loved it. Mr8 thought the potato was ‘the bomb’, then again he and Miss5 love lamb :))

Like a lot of others, I found the cut at Walmart, never heard of it before, Googled and found this recipe for Christmas dinner.  It was great.  Def making it again, I didn't have corriander and use apple cider vinegar since I didn't have white wine vinegar. But was delicious all the same.

Very good.  As others mentioned. Step 2 can be done much later and I would rub the meat in the olive oil and apply the spices as a rib.  When mixed with the oil it was a bit hard to apply

I love lamb, and like others reviewing this recipe, I ran across lamb breast at wal-mart and was intrigued.  Mostly by how affordable it was.  Looked up this recipe in the store, and decided to go for it.  I prepped the meat as directed, but decided to slow smoke the breasts, like one would smoke ribs.  Left it in the smoker for 3+ hours, then wrapped in foil for a couple more hours.  The result was alot like pork belly.  When all the fat was scraped away, I was left with delicious, tender, brisket textured lamb.  It tasted delicious and the sauce was an excellent, bright compliment to the meat.  Note that this is very fatty.  5 lbs of lamb breast yielded about 11 oz of lean meat.  So I made a lamb stock for stew with all the leftover parts.  I would do it again, but I will be better prepared to deal with all the rendered fat.

I almost never rate or review recipes, but I had to for this recipe. It is literally SO GOOD. Neither I nor my husband had ever eaten lamb before outside of gyros. I saw  breast of lamb on sale last week and decided to pick it up and figure out a way to cook it later.  I happened upon chef John’s recipe and followed it to a T. My husband is an extremely picky eater and is a very cautious about trying new things. I had to sell him on this dish – but once he took a bite he was in heaven. He literally told me this was the best meal I have ever made for him in almost 4 years. There were no leftovers. We are having it again tomorrow night. Seriously I cannot recommend this recIpe enough.

this is a good recipe for lamb. the flavors are on point. I omitted the coriander because u didn't have any and I grilled mine instead of roasting. I followed recipe but place lamb on grill and grilled fat side down a hour and half before flipping and grilling another hour more or less. my lamb was more fatty than I would have like but the flavor was good.

I really enjoyed this recipe. This was me and my husbands first time having lamb (as far as we remember). The only thing I did different was use balsamic vinegar instead of white and it gave it a not too deep sweetness. So good!

This is the Perfect recipe for Lamb Breast.  Fixed 2 last night (total wt about 7 lbs,  from a 4 H lamb, for 4  people)- Very fatty!  Was apprehensive about the sauce, but it was absolutely perfect with this fatty, rich meat.  If I would fix lamb breast again (unlikely) I would do it this way.  Didn't change a thing.  I cooked the breasts earlier in the day, let it rest covered for about 1 1/2 hr then finished it.  About 1/4 left over.  Lots of waste - bone and fat.

This was my first try with lamb breast and it was AMAZING! I will definitely be repeating this recipe. I have found other cuts of lamb to be too oily in taste, but this was perfect!

The fat on this cut of lamb is horrendous and it kills any hope of potential flavor the lamb is capable of. It looked good when I finished making it, but it just tasted terrible.

Our first try and think it needs a careful eye on timing - a little overdone, but worth revisiting.  Our fault really!!
