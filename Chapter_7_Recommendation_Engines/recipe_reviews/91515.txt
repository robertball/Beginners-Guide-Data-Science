My family LOVED this recipe! I made it with sour cream and without rinsing the sauerkraut (as suggested by other reviewers), and it was delicious! Such a simple, tasty and satisfying casserole. Thanks so much for posting it! I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing!  Perfect comfort food!!  I took someone's suggestion and used sour cream, although I'm sure it'd be just as great with regular cream.  I'm about to go for my third helping--I just wanted to get this review in ASAP because I'm so excited about it!

The first words out of my boyfriend after he tried this were "This is AWESOME!"  He's the pickiest person EVER and my jaw dropped by his reaction over this.
I used red-skinned potatoes..don't know if that made a difference.  And I didn't rinse the sauerkraut.  There was a nice juice on the bottom of the pan from it after it cooked.  I used a bit more butter and some garlic powder also.  Delicious.  And very easy!

I used russet potatoes, omitted the butter, and used bulk turkey sausage. I'm so used to cooking with onions, that I added a chopped one to the meat as I cooked it! This is a great new Shepard's Pie for me!  The nutmeg is a great seasoning for this dish!

We loved this.  I used sour cream instead of cream and it gave this even more flavor.   Next time, I'll probably add more potato too.

This is pretty good and very easy to make (except for the potatoes part).  I used a 9x13 casserole dish and that seemed to be perfect.  The sauerkraut kind of got lost in the taste and consistency of the potatoes, so next time I think I will only drain it and not rinse it and may add a little more kraut.

I'm totally changing my review! I made this without draining the sauerkraut and with draining/rinsing the sauerkraut and I liked it the best without draining! At first I thought the opposite because it was a little tangyier than I would prefer it, but, if you drain and rinse the sauerkraut, it misses alot of flavor. So, I'm giving this 4 stars ... Still liked it alot though!

This has officially become one of my all-time favorite recipes! This is some of the best comfort food EVER! I didn't follow the portion of the recipe regarding the potatoes because I make mashed potatoes the way my mom makes them (no recipe, just wing it until it tastes the way you want). I also added a can of cream of mushroom/celery soup on top of the kielbasa. And I agree, the kraut gets lost so I also doubled the kraut. LOVE IT!!! Thank you so much for sharing!

So all I did was cut up and cook the kielbasa with the sour kraut and some noodles then added sour cream and milk and cayenne pepper and it was really really good! I dunno if this qualifies as the same recipe even, but that's all I had to work with. My hubby really liked it...

I made this for New Years Day. I am not a fan of sauerkraut or kielbasa but my husband always wants those for New Years. I actually enjoyed this. Will definitely make again.

Good taste, but definitely recommend using a slow cooker (crock pot) rather than an oven.

This was fantastic!  I used sweet and sour red cabbage instead of regular sour kraut.  I was in a hurry and did not have time to make homemade mashed potatotes so I used betty crocker instant.  VERY GOOD!

I was looking for a different recipe to use my leftover turkey meat with & I found it! I used homemade sauerkraut, diced, cooked turkey instead of the kielbasa, & lots of mashed potatoes. It tasted great! The family ate helping after helping, if that says anything!

Easy and tasty. I sautéed the kielbasa first with sliced onions until browned. I also didn't rinse the sauerkraut. It all fits nicely in a 9x13 dish.

I used barvarian sauerkraut from a jar (nice mild flavor kraut with caraway seeds) and fresh kielbasa sausage from Whole Foods that I sliced and sautéed with fresh garlic and shallots before adding atop sauerkraut. Other than that I followed it exactly. Really delicious.

So easy, so good!  Used homemade sauerkraut, rinsed well as recipe directed.  I was skeptical about the nutmeg in the mashed potatoes, but it didn't overpower the dish and blended nicely with other flavors--not discernable with the overall flavor combination.  Took to a potluck and it was well received--creamy, salty, tangy goodness!
