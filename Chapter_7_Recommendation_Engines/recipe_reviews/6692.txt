I've made this bread twice now by hand rather than in the bread machine and it turned out fabulous.  I find most home-made breads to be very "floury" tasting but this one was moist, flavorful and a big hit with my dinner guests.

One word of caution:  Partially cook the bread BEFORE topping with the mozzarella.  The bread did not rise where the cheese was.  It looked great, smelled wonderful, was even tasty, but.... was undercooked and did not rise with the cheese.  Since the combination of flavors is a definite winner, I will try this recipe again with modifications.

I made this both the traditional way (at my in-laws who don't have a bread machine) and at home in my machine. Either way, it was delicious! I skipped the garlic and didn't miss it a bit.

This bread with a bowl of soup or salad is a meal in itself.  Next time I might cut down on the garlic salt abit or use fresh minced garlic.

This was even better than I thought it would be!  If sun-dried tomatoes weren't so dang expensive, I'd make it all the time.  :)

This has a strong sun-dried tomato flavor and was very good.  I accidently added the oil into the bread machine and it didn't make a difference.  It was a little lighter than the last time I made a focaccia (perhaps it was the oil).  I also used fresh rosemary (2 Tablespoons) and cut the mozzarella to 1/2 cup.  Very Good!

This is well worth the time it takes
(approx. 3 hr including bread machine
time). My 17 year old daughter would
eat it all if she knew she didn't have 
to share. I make a special batch without 
the sun dried tomatoes so my 14 year old 
son will eat it (he's a fussy eater, but 
loves the bread if there is no sun dried 
tomatoes)

Okay - this is probably the best bread I have made ever!  I read the reviews and did make a few changes, per some of the suggestions.  I decreased the sugar a bit (by 1/2 tablespoon), I decreased the salt to 3/4 of a teaspoon.  I proof my yeast before hand, as I see some others do.  I added a little bit more sun dried tomatoes and waited to add them until the the "mix in" beep on my breadmaker.  This way, I still had small pieces of sun dried tomato in the finished bread.  And I added 1 teaspoon garlic powder to the dough (I LOVE garlic).  Instead of the garlic salt at the end, I added a few tablespoons of fresh garlic and like others have said, I waited to add the mozzarella until it was half baked.  But it turned out SOOO good!!!!  It was a lot of work, but I will definately make it again!  Thank you for the recipe and the feedback from those who have tried it!!

I tried the focaccia for the first time .. It turned out great. This is a keeper... I did add some sliced pitted black olives . Wonderful. My daughter could not keep her hands off the bread. Will try making it with part whole wheat flour.. I did keep it for a 2 hours for it to raise the first time and again an hour + since I had to go out.

Overall this was just an okay bread, but nothing like the focaccias I've purchased at bakeries. Compared to those this was very dry on the inside. Three cups of flour is probably to blame, since the rosemary and tomatoes did not fully drown out the floury taste. I've since tried another recipe that used two cups of flour which worked much better. For what it's worth, I do not have a bread machine so I mixed this by hand and cooked it on a pizza stone. Still, I doubt that would affect the dryness.

I don't think the chunks of sun-dried tomatoes incorporated well into the bread.  We had to pick them out.  There's other focaccia recipes on this site that are much better- sorry.

My hubby lived in Italy for a few years so we are constantly looking for authentic tasting recipes. This is SO good. I use my KitchenAid rather than a bread maker and we eat it far more often then I'm sure we should!

This was very very good. I'd almost like to use it as a pizza crust, just spread it out thinner. The only thing I didn't care for this was the amount of dried tomatoes. The entire jar didn't even make the called for amount and it was still too much for everyone that tried it.   For the topping part I increased the amount of parmesan cheese, using the shreds and not the powder type. I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and fresh rosemary instead of dried. It makes a very beautiful looking piece of bread after its baked.  I still give it 5 stars because the amount of dried tomatoes is probably just a taste preference and not a recipe flaw. For those first making it, you may want to try less to start with. My jar didn't come to half cup, but I would decrease it to 1/4 cup next time.  Oh almost forgot. For the olive oil, I used the olive oil that the tomatoes came packed in. I even reserved the rest of the oil to make an infused oil. I added regular olive oil to what was left to fill it up, added fresh minced garlic and fresh rosemary to use up the left overs. Was great drizzled over the finished product.

ive made foccacia loads of times...a good technique I use is not putting any veggies or cheeses in the dough... I take about 1 cup of italian dressing and put onions, peppers, and tomatoes..I let it bake about 1/2 way and top it with parmesan cheese and the veggies. I make sandwiches with a simple rosemary foccacia...YUMMM

This dough was very sticky, but it lead to a delicious loaf of focaccia. I used fresh rosemary and incorporated it into the dough instead of sprinkling it on top. Then I used fresh garlic and a couple of pinches of salt instead of the garlic salt. 1 cup of mozerella seemet like a lot, so I decreased it to 1/4 to 1/3 cup, and grated fresh parmesan cheese over the top. When I first tasted this bread I thought it was too sweet; after a few bites I was hooked. I can't leave it alone!

This was an excellent recipe.  I thought the rosemary was a little overpowering though.  I'll just not put as much next time. My little sister said it was "off the chain," so I guess that's good.  :)

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I used canned sun dried tomatoes and they turned the bread a beautiful color in the bread machine. I make bread all the time, but this very well may be the tastiest bread I've even eaten in my life. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This very good. I cut down on the rosemary though and substitute basil. I have a member of the family that is not a huge fan of rosemary. Of course you don't need a bread machine!  Thank goodness I dried all my leftover tomatoes from the garden.  Very easy to make your own sun-dried and a great deal cheaper.

I made this with my Kitchenaid by proofing the yeast, adding the wet ingredients, then the dry and mixing it with the dough hook for a few minutes.  It came out just fine!  This recipe is amazing.  Will definitely be making it again! :)

Yummy....I did some changes though....I added half the salt as it already has lots of salty ingredientes, used olive oil instead of butter in the dough and natural garlic. Really soft, chewy and easy to make...

***1/2  This was good, and I will make it again, but with a few changes (I made it exactly as per the recipe). We found it to be really sweet; next time I'll cut down on the sugar & maybe try 1/3 cup of tomatoes, as well as adding in some pepper. Also, I'll add the tomatoes in the last 5 minutes of kneading (in the machine): my bread was bright orange and only a few bits of tomato survived intact. I'll also try chilling the dough overnight, in hopes of a chewier texture.

it's okay nice texture and don't need long time proofing. but i think there's something lacking and need a bit more tweaking like. more sundried tomato on to add more flavour and more Parmesan cheese and fresh garlic with a bit coarse salt on top.

Delicious! A little one the light and fluffy side, but the flavor was awesome!

this is fabulous.  I agree with the other review that the mozzarella should be added after it bakes for 5 or 6 minutes.  I used homemade dried tomatoes in olive oil so it had a little oil in the bread and a little on the top.  Don't change a thing.

Delicious! Took about 3 hours from start to finish (dough cycle on my machine takes 1 1/2 hours). I used less than a whole small (7 oz) jar of Safeway Select julienne cut sun dried tomatoes with Italian herbs in oil, chopped them up a bit more but this wasn't necessary, the kneading of the bread machine pulverized them so only teeny bits were visible in the finished bread. Next time I'll try 1/4 cup at the beginning, they added a wonderful flavor & color to the dough, & add the other 1/4 cup chopped a bit when it beeps to add fruit/nuts. Drained tomatoes a bit but didn't rinse, so due to the extra oil left on the tomatoes I cut the butter (instead of margarine) down to about 2 3/4 Tbsp. Used "Better for Bread" flour & bread machine yeast, made a big oval on a 10x15 cookie sheet, it rose beautifully when baked, taste & texture were perfect! Instead of olive oil used oil from the tomatoes, about 1 Tbsp was enough for the knead step & brushing on top, used the other Tbsp for dipping....yum! I cut the garlic salt in half but it was still a bit too salty on top so next time I'll use garlic powder, the cheese has enough salt for the top. I try to rate recipes considering the actual recipe without any modifications, & had I used the full amount of garlic salt it would have been terrible, so I took 1 star off for that. Some reviewers said the dough was too floury or too sweet, but I thought the dough was awesome & look forward to making this again with other cheeses & toppings.

This is delicious bread with great color from the sun-dried tomatoes.  I thought it was a little too sweet and I've never seen a bread recipe call for so much sugar in it.  Next time I will reduce the sugar for my tastes.

I used this recipe to create a basic focaccia dough which I then topped with sugar to create focaccia dolce. Simply fantastic - super easy to make! THANKS!!!

I made this recipe as listed.  But the Garlic Salt was way too much; and i'm a salt lover!!  It did have good texture and was moist and not dry, but can't put my finger on what else i didn't like.  Just not for me I guess.

I love this bread!  I included the cheeses in the batter and used sun dried tomato salsa and then added cheese to the top of the bread.  It's very moist and delicous.

This recipe was delicious - the bread was the hit of the dinner party.  I took other people's advice and added the cheese after cooking the bread for about 8 minutes.  And I didn't have dry milk powder so I just used regular milk.  I coarsely chopped the sun-dried tomatoes so there were still chunks of them in the bread even after the bread machine made the dough.  Fantastic!

I wouldn't call it traditional focaccia. But it is utterly delicious, flavorful bread that everyone I have served it to LOVES. Do not bake on a pizza stone..... it is tender and moist and delicious in the casserole dish. 
You MUST measure your flour properly.... use two scoops.... one to scoop and dust over your actual measurement cup, then gently scrape the top with the flat back of a butter knife..... do not tap or pack your flour, do not scoop directly from the bag into the measure. If you're confused by my words please just Google how to properly measure flour for baking. Every single baking recipe ever should include how to measure flour because everyone does it differently. 
I use my Kitchenaid stand mixer.
I put warm water, sugar, salt, powdered milk and yeast in the bowl. Let it sit for a few minutes. Add butter and start the mixer on a lowish setting. Start adding flour while it's mixing. Add chopped tomatoes. Switch to dough hook, mix on speed 2 for a while (between 5 and 7 minutes). This is when I measure and crush my rosemary, which I go ahead and then combine with 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp salt since I don't keep garlic salt on hand. I then add the parmesan to the spices and give it a nice toss with a fork then set aside and work on the dough. Just knead it a little and form it into a ball, follow along with recipe.

This is beyond 5 stars because:
Everyone I've ever met loves homemade bread. This makes plenty to serve a family meal and give half away to

This is made of win. 
I made it tonight as the recipe states and then drizzling with chilli oil to finish. Have previously made it as a sandwich loaf, totally in the bread machine, set for a basic loaf of 700g and putting all ingredients except mozarella in from the start. Then, finish it by sprinkling the mozarella on top and grilling to melt it. 
Makes a spectacularly good chicken/rocket/mayo sandwich.

Delicious and easy !! Served with dinner last night and my family (even my picky husband) raved.  Bread comes out a nice reddish color.  I agree with earlier post - I added the mozzarella about 1/2 thru cooking. I may sub pesto for tomatoes next time.

The focaccia turned out a little dry (even after using the sun dried tomatoe soak olive oil).
