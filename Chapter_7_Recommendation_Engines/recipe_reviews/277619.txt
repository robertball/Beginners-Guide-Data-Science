12.23.19  The mashed ripe banana brings good moisture and tenderness to the pancakes, and the flavor is split fairly evenly between the pumpkin and banana.  After youâ€™ve made pancakes for quite a while, you just know when the batter consistency is spot on, and that was the case with this recipe.  Nice pancakes, thanks for sharing.
