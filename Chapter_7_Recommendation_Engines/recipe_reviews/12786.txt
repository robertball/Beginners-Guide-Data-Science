WOW.  I can't beleive how simple and tasty this is!!  The only change I made was I pre-cooked the chopped potatoes in the microwave for 8 minutes-then tossed in 2tb oil and 1tsp minced garlic...I only added about 3tb water to the veggies when I added them...and I sprinkled Mrs. Dash over the fish.  YUMMY!  We will make this again and again!

I used haddock and seasoned it with a little old bay seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  We were pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  This is a meal I'll make often.

Next time I would cook the potatoes a little longer and add the zuchini a little later. You can also get by with much less oil.

This dish was so easy to make.  I love dinners that are cooked all in one dish, it makes clean up a breeze.  The recipe was good, however based on prior reviews I added some Italian seasoning and used only 3tbsp oil total.  I also added some fresh lemon juice to the fish before cooking it.  This made the recipe a lot less bland than it would have been.  The meal was nice and light too but still left you satisfied.  I will be making this again in the future!

Very easy and delicious.  You can easily substitue other veggies except for bell peppers.  Bell peppers are the key in this recipe.

I too found this to be bland. The potatos weren't fully cooked and the zucchini was mushy. Neither my wife or I cared for this meal.

In addition, while the recipe is titled "Baked Fish Dinner For Two" I point out that the yield is four servings.

The fish needed to be blackened or some type of flavor added to it.  The same with the vegetables. This was easy to make, but very bland tasting, not much flavor.

I tried this with my family. After reading other reviews I seasoned the veggies and seafood with Tony's to spice it up. I used Fresh caught shark, and also waited longer to ad zuccini.
We loved it. I will make it again without a doubt

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I took the advice of some of the others and seasoned with Old Bay and extra garlic.  I also added my own touches by placing slices of tomato sprinkled with basil on top of the fish.  Then I placed slices of provolone cheese on the tomato and added one more topping of tomatoes. Even with the cheese, this is a healthy recipe.  My husband loved the meal. The flavor (while not strong) was great.  You could taste the veggies (especially the red peppers) and the fish.

I used the microwave instead of the oven and it turned out very good. I microwaved each step 5-7 min.

DH and I agreed on giving this a 4 star because it's so good for you.  But, overall the recipe lacked 'rock my socks' value.  We're very spicy people and even though we gave this recipe a good dose of Old Bay seasoning and lots of lemon- it was still a little too bland for us.  BUT, it was good for something so healthy.  Thanks for the recipe and helping our hearts to stay happily pumping along!

I thought this was very good.  I used tilapia.  I did take the sugguestions of other reviewers and cook the potatoes longer in the oven -30 minutes, to make sure they were soft and used one full red pepper but felt it did not need the extra 15 min to cook the pepper as it got mushy.  I seasoned the fish with lemon, Mrs Dash (non salt) and lightly coated with Italian bread crumbs.  Going to try putting in less olive oil next time as it is healthy but in a smaller quanity would bring the fat level way down

It was a hit in my family. Had to leave out the bell pepper and substituted mild onion for the leeks because I didn't have any on hand. I did season the fish with homemade seasoned salt and toss it in a bit of olive oil because I was concerned plain fish would be too mild. Used cod, which has a nice firm texture so that it would balance the potatoes.

If you have ever been in the Northern States and had a fish boil, you will appreciate this dish. Also the taste some describe as bland actually lets you taste the fish and veggies. We all liked it, but I let the kids pick out the zucchini. I was lacking the celery, leek, and red bell. I used onion and green bell and sprinkled some dried parsley on it. Great!!

Very tasty way to prepare cod!  My husband and I will be having it again. I followed the recipe exactly, with the one exception of cooking it for 13 minutes after the fish is added.   I think this simple dish would probably be a welcomed favorite at potlucks.

We actually found this recipe to be a little bland.  I used fresh cilantro with the tomatoes to garnish and that added a nice flavor.  I'll add cilantro every time.

Wonderful and easy.  My husband is not much of a fisher eater but loves this recipe and requests it often.  I occassional substitute sweet peppers, regular onion and eggplant. Easy to substitute!! A keeper.

I think it needs more than 1lb fish for four servings. 2 or 1 and 1/2 would be better.

This is a great steamed fish recipe however The reviews help and there are some things id do differently next time.  I didnt nuke the potatoes just put them in the pan. I switched out zucchini for carrots.  the celery couldve gone in w the potatoes to cook more.  The fish was cooked perfectly at 10 min.  I used less oil an water as well.  The main thing this dish needs, for me, next time is flavor add some serious spice to the fish to add a bold flavor an itll rock.

This was very good.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion to start the potatoes in the microwave, but otherwise followed Steve's recipe.  The celery, leek, garlic, and bell pepper gave this receipe plenty of flavor.  The prep can be done while the previous step is cooking, so this dish can be on the table in 40 minutes. - Thanks!

I was so looking forward to this meal, but it just didn't deliver. normally I don't season my food much, especially vegetables. I like to enjoy the "natural goodness" of them. but this might've gone a little too far. with the only seasoning being a little salt and pepper on the potatoes, and some garlic... It just really lacked umph.  The vegetables all turned out well. After reading other reviews, I cooked the potatoes alone a little longer, and cut the zucchini a little thick and put it in a few minutes after all the other veggies. This seemed to work. Next time, if there is one, I will season the fish first, as it did not take on any flavor.

It was okay...Would not necessarily make it again. But how can it be "Baked Fish Dinner For Two" when it makes 4 servings? That was ridiculous!

I have used this recipe more than any other on the site, it has a perfect combination of veggies and fish, we eat this year round! I often substitute sweet potatoes and add an island spice to the fish, typically use mahi-mahi . Great recipe!

Great dish.  I added carrots (x2), 1/3 of a large sweet onion, red and green pepper &  6 cloves of garlic and used striped bass.  Garnished with tomato & parsley.  Came out great.

Unbelievably bland recipe! Based on other reviews I marinated the fish with lemon and dijon and seasoned it and the vegetables very well and added basil and rosemary but it was still such a dull dish. Husband said it was good but I doubt I'd ever make it again

This recipe is awesome - everything was cooked perfectly and I followed the cooking directions exactly. MUST ADD MORE SEASONING - I added a splash of lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, and oregano as well as adding 1/4 chopped onion to the vegetables. The broth was so flavourable - if you blended the entire thing once cooked it would make a mean soup.

Added more fish so it had to cook longer and that make the potatoes perfect and we seasoned fish with lemon pepper before cooking. It was a little bland. Added some rice and old bay seasoning after cooking. Most of the family liked it. Add more potatoes and veggies and fish for larger family.

Very simple.  Very good.  I used one baking potato and one sweetpotato.  The sweet potato did add a bit of flavor.

I tried it but I cut down on the oil to 2 tbl. I baked the potatoes to 20 min first and I added Italian seasoning to the veggies and put lemon pepper in the fish . My wife doesn't like fish at all but she had 2 very good helpings. This dish is a keeper

In addition to using the salt & pepper we also used some dried oregano. My husband even like this and gave it a thumbs up!
