Cooked it on top of stove because I was pressed for time.  It was delicious!  Served over rice.  Yum!

This recipe was okay. It would probably better not in a slow cooker. If I try this again I will make it I  a pan. The crockpot made it easy, but it was overly greasy and didn't hold the flavor of the pineapple well.

I'm not real big on sweeten foods, but this was good.

4.24.19  Today I was trying to get ready for vacation, so it definitely was a slow cooker kind of day.  I always use Hillshire Farms® Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (healthier), which is already cooked, in place of kielbasa, so I knew this wouldn’t take 3-4 hours to cook.  I used my slow cook feature on my Instant Pot® with the normal setting, checked at 1 hour, and it was good-to-go, really just needed to heat up.  Bell pepper slices seemed like a natural with this recipe, so I did add some, and it just made more sense to me to use pineapple chunks rather than the rings.  The sauce did thin out, so I used the saute feature on the pot and added another cornstarch slurry to reach the consistency I was looking for.  Little on the sweet side for us (could just be personal taste), so I’ll cut back the amount of brown sugar next time.  Nothing fancy here, we’d call it comfort food in this house, and we enjoyed it.  Served with rice and a garnish of chopped cilantro for a pop of color.
