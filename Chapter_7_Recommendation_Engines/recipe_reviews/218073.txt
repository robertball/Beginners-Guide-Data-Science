Mouth-watering, juicy pork tender loin. I made this for myself and the kids and was sad I didn't have another adult there to enjoy this fabulous meal. This is the type of recipe you do to impress the in-laws. Will surely make this again!

This recipe was extraordinary! Definitely a keeper! It's a bit too cold to grill now, but we pan-fried and they were delicious!

My picky eater just loved the pork chop.  She can't wait to eat them again.  We lightened it up with smart balanace and less sugar though!  Great food

Our fave porkchop recipe- the family loves it!  We halved the amount of marinade as it's too much sugar for us. Great with a salad and rice.

This was great and easy to make, too.  We had it with festival squash and green beans, then had Danny's Warm and Fuzzy Apple Cider afterwards!

A delicious taste. The spicy ingredients blend beautifully with the sweet fruit. I cooked half on a grill and baked the other half.

My husband and I both loved this.  Hubby isn't into cumin, so I used probably less than a teaspoon in the marinade.  We broiled the pork in the oven, but didn't squeeze the lime over it - though I'm sure that would have been good.  Also, we didn't use pears for the topping, plus just softened the apples on the stove and called it done.  Delicious.

These were a hit in my house. Love the marinade and the chops were beautiful after grilling. I did feel that the apple/pear mixture could have used some additional spice to kick up the flavor a little. Maybe a little crushed red pepper or a touch of chili powder? I skipped grilling the fruit cause I thought it would be a mess and instead transferred the grilled chops to the pan with the fruit, mixed it altogether and served.

Absolutely delicious!  I subbed in agave nectar for the honey and it worked well.  Not too sweet, but good.

I loved this recipe. I did substitute lemon juice for the lime juice and apple cider for the o.j. because I didn't have either of those. They were still delicious. I also pan fried them instead of using a grill, and served them with glazed carrots.

I read this and thought, what a waste to throw away all that rich marinade.. so instead, I toss the fruit and chops in a 2 qt. baking dish and bake it.. then I use the marinade over rice with the dish! You can eliminate the extra brown sugar and butter for the fruit which also saves a few calories. Its delicious this way!

Yummy! Used pork sirloin roast because its what I had. Made 1/2 recipe marinade and still had leftover sauce. I thought it was a little sweet so I would use a little less brown sugar next time. With my roast size I needed only 1 large apple and 2 smaller pears pealed and sliced. Roast was placed in 9x9 pan with fruit arranged around it & topped with enough marinade to almost cover fruit. Let sit 45 minutes. Cooked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then lowered temp to 350 and cooked until pork reached 145 degrees with meat thermometer -about 20 min or more depending on roast size.

Apples are in season and I LOVE pork with apples so I thought this recipe would be great to try!  The flavor of the marinade was really good and I liked the hint of lime.  I forgot to buy pears so we only used apples for the topping and we didn't grill them at the end.  It still turned out just fine.  Great fall recipe when its still nice enough out to BBQ!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Dianne!

Good + recipe.  Made as written, except for 2 people, so cut the ingredients appropriately.  Also cut back just a pinch on the sugar (probably 3 1/2 T), and honey (half of what 1/4 of the recipe called for).  With those changes, we thought it was great.  (Although I marinated it for about 5 hours in the 'frig, just because that worked for our activities that day.). With these changes, we didn't think anything was too sweet.  Served with coriander roasted carrots and arugula, kale and pear salad - very nice Sunday dinner.  (Although I would tweek the dressing for the salad, but that is not reflected in my rating.). I would suggest you try this!

GREAT!  The fruit was as good as the meat.  Didn't have OJ, so used lemon juice.  Didn't have limes, so just left that off.   Next time will try it exactly & boil the marinade down to pour over the chops, like someone else suggested.  A 'different' pork chop recipe.

Amazing, amazing! Family loved it and it wasn't very hard!  I almost followed directions to a 'T' and took the extra pork chops and froze them for next week! I lightened the cumin and added a tad more Worcestershire sauce ...great flavor.  Also good to use on flank steak...but marinate overnight!

Quite good, but wayyyy too much marinade.  Even half the quantities would be plenty enough.  Will probably make it again.

Really delicious. I used a pork tenderloin. Not sure about grilling the fruit or drizzling the lime juice. I did and I’m not sure that added anything. Fruit was good right out of the sauté pan. Everyone came back for seconds and extra topping.

This is outstanding.  I should point out that this recipe scales up or down very easily.  I made it for two, instead of eight.  And, although this was intended for an outdoor grill, you could use a George Foreman or OptiGrill, which is what I did.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The marinade adds a lot to the pork chops, and the apple-pear topping (which I made in a skillet) is an added bonus.

I followed the recipe exactly and no one was particularly excited. They said the chops were boring and bland. I boiled the marinade and made a sauce that improved it, but not much. Interestingly, the best part of the meal was a roasted sweet potato with the sauce and apple/pear mixture on top. I would not make it again.

Made it for dinner last night, my boyfriend said this was the second best dinner I've made (second to filet mignon I purchased at a butcher and cooked in butter). Next time I will cut marinade in half as it was too much. Very tasty and amazing flavor profile!

Really tasty.
I've been using the marinade as a base for a lot of pork dishes. Works especially well for stir fry.

Followed the recipe exactly and loved the flavor!  I did set some of the marinade to the side to reduce down for a dipping sauce.  It was good just a little on the salty side.  I will make sure to use low sodium soy sauce next time. Served it with steamed broccoli and baked potatoes.

I love this.  I am not a very good cook, but this made me look more like one.  This was not had to fix and with one or two errors my husband and I turned out a very fine dinner.  Thanks for the receipe.

Fantastic!  Wasn't sure what kind of spicy brown mustard so bought Royally Hot English Mustard. My normally fussy15 year old son inhaled it, fruit and all. Served it with white rice and peas (with lemon zest, fresh dill,  beaten egg yoke and cream). Only slight variation was I couldn't bear to see the marinade wasted, so I poured some of it in the pan as I cooked the fruit, and when I removed the fruit to put on the bbq, I then boiled down the sauce to thicken it and poured it over the chops on the plate. Fantastic!!!!
