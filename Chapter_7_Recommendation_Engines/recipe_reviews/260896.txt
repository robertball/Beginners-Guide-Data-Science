I was born and raised in Guadalajara, México. We never bought any caramel, my grandfather made it all the time, used La Lechera brand. He made it on stove top, I still make it till this day, now my teenagers and adult daughter are making it; and use it on toast, pancakes, top ice cream with it. It’s the best and only caramel!

I normally make my own caramel with sugar, butter, and cream, but this is certainly a nice and easy shortcut. I didn't add anything at to the first can, but the second has just come out of the slow cooker, and I'll try adding some sea salt and vanilla to it. I'm using it in coffee, and I find it blends more easily if I heat the caramel in the microwave first. It's quite thick, and I'm thinking it will work splendidly on top of a cheesecake.

Edit: The first can I cooked according to this recipe, while for the second I tried 8 hours on low. I don't care for the flavor of that one at all, leaves a funny aftertaste. I'll stick to the faster cooking on high in the future. Also, I swirled some into my cheesecake batter before baking, and it produced a very tasty cheesecake.

This worked perfectly. I worried the whole time as to whether or not it was working. When I opened the can I prepared myself for it to not be done or to be overcooked. But it was perfect. My slow cooker is 5 quarts, so I upped the time to 4 1/2 hours since I had more water to heat up. I tried it first without the vanilla and then decided to add it. You do have to stir it all together in a separate bowl quite a bit becuase the consistency is jelly like on top and thicker at the bottom of the can. Keep stirring until it is nice and smooth. YUM!

I too have done this for years, but on the stovetop and without the vanilla.  I don’t however, use it as caramel. I’ve always used it as a caramel flavored frosting for cakes. Either way, it’s very simple and tasty.

The first 2 times I made this exactly as the recipe said. The caramel was so delicious it was hard not to eat it with a spoon! However, even after removing the label that picking the glue off the can, it left a sticky ring in my pot. Now I make dulce de leche in the instant pot. I put the sweetened condensed milk in a small mason type jar and seal it up. No mess!

Very nice caramel and very easy... although next time, I'll try to remember to wash as much of the label glue from the can as I'm able, because it got all over the can and stuck to the crock pot where the water level was. Not a big deal to clean up, but I figure it would be a little easier to do it before hand. I don't know if it was just my crock pot or maybe I had too much water, but it didn't even start simmering until the last hour, and came out a little light and thin for what I wanted, so I think I'll try a little longer than 4 1/2 hours next time.

In West Tennessee, we made this in the late '40s in a sauce pan of boiling water.  For safety we punched several holes in the top with an ice pick.

I made it tonight!  I am using the preset 4 hours on high setting on the crock pot.  Thinking of a Samoa cookie flavored  trifle!  Note - take it out of the can before it solidifies!!!  I didn't and then my electric can opener went on strike, leaving me with a solid mass and a church key.  Not fun.  But delicious!

I used to make this 30+ years ago.  Of course then I boiled it in a pan on the cooktop.  Delicious.  We like it best with  a good quality vanilla bean ice cream and devil's food cake.

This was really easy and delicious, but it took a little longer than the recipe stated, at least for my slow cooker and starting with water that was not pre-heated. At 4 hours, the dulce de leche was more of a sauce and light brown.. 4.5 hours was better, and it probably could've even gone to 5 hours to have more of a spread-like consistency.
