I had been seeing lots of recipes for farro, but had not found any until this last trip to the grocery store.  We really liked this - did not have walnuts, but will make sure I have some on hand next time, as I am sure they will add a nice texture addition.  I used feta instead of ricotta salata, as I was unable to find the ricotta at the store (and we are feta lovers anyway).  I used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site, which worked very nicely.  My only negative was my fault - the sundried tomatoes I used were packed with herbs, and their flavor was almost overwhelming.  Next time I will use tomatoes packed without the herbs. Thanks!

I made this salad last weekend for a family gathering.  It tasted wonderful.  My grocery store didn't have ricotta salata cheese so I substituted goat cheese and stirred it in towards the end.  It was light, healthy, and very flavorful.  Even my husband loved it.  We'll definitely make it again.  It was a nice change from a pasta or couscous salad.

Prepared recipe as written with exception of using oil packed sun dried tomatoes.  This salad was delicious.  The ricotta salata is a good option for those who do not like feta, however, being a feta lover, the next time I make this I will use feta.  I would love to see more recipes for farro as it is my all time favorite grain.

Used brown rice instead of farro because I couldn't find farro, worked great.  Used feta in place of the ricotta.  I thought this was very good but my family didn't like it at all.

The salad was too spicy because of the raw garlic clove. Next time I make it, I will definitely leave the garlic out or roast it before adding to the salad. Other than that, the salad was pretty good.
