Lesson: Do NOT used undercooked rice. Oops! It absorbed all the moisture from the meat so the meatballs were D.R.Y. and coulda used a lil salt. The sauce was amazing though..I reduced it to make it thicker and the ginger and nutmeg MAKE it!

We loved this recipe!  YUMMY!  I used ground chicken and made a couple changes.  I did not use the marmalade in the sauce (we like our sauce a little more spicy than sweet).  Instead, I put in two Tbsp. spicy barbecue sauce and I also added some fresh garlic into the sauce.  It turned out great.  I didn't have minute rice, so I just cooked some regular brown rice and used 2 cups of cooked rice.  That's probably less than 2 cups of uncooked minute rice, but the meatballs turned out moist and firm--not crumbly at all!

We made these for a football game and love them.  The flavors mend well together and we plan to have them again.  Followed the recipe as stated.  Great, great recipe! Five stars!

I really liked this recipe. My family did too, even though my mom did not eat the meatballs because she does not like sweet meatballs she thought the rice with the sauce was great along with the pinapple pieces. I also omitted onions, simply because we did not have any.

It's good (really good) but hard to get into the right shape since it is a bit loose. I would recommend blending the rice a bit before mixing then refrigerating the solid meatball mixture to make it easier to handle and form into balls. Also needs 1 more egg as prepared since it doesn't have anything to bind (1 extra egg white would be sufficient).

This recipe had good flavor but I thought there was too much rice.  I am looking forward to trying this again but reducing the amount of rice added to the meatballs.

I made this with ground turkey, and I added some garlic, onion powder,  fresh cracked black pepper ,and some cayenne red pepper.  I added the cayenne red pepper because I was thinking (after reading the ingredients), that it didn't seem to have any spiciness to it.  I don't like food really hot/ spicy but just  a "smidge" is good. I also omitted the rice IN the meatballs, and made them w/ plain bread crumbs.  Just easier on me that way. Anyways, what I didn't like about it is the orange; it was just WAY overpowering.  There wasn't a balance at all.  (I also didn't like the bits of orange peel in the jelly, and that's not the recipe posters fault) .  I think this is a good base recipe for tweaking.  What I'm thinking of doing is this next time... using apricot preserves (with NO chunks), and using the pineapple juice (with NO tidbits) along w/ the teriyaki.  I don't really care for chunky/ textured sauce.  I do think this recipe is workable though

This turned out great! I added a little bit of cholula to the sauce and the meatball mixture for a touch of spice and it is one of my new favorites

It was a nice change from my normal fixxings, but I always find poultry meatballs to be a little mushy. I liked the sauce, I didn't have any orange marmalade so I just squeezed in some fresh lemon juice. That brightened the sauce right up.

These were excellent - bursting with flavor, and fairly easy to make too. I didn't have minute rice, so I used 2 cups of cooked brown rice. I also subbed apricot jelly for the marmalade. The littler kids weren't so excited about it, but all those with more sophisticated palates really enjoyed it.

It was actually pretty disgusting. I don't know what I did wrong The mixture would not form into balls, so I made mini meatloafs, and they weren't good.
