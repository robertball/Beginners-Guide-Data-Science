Used it as a sauce over broccoli - I've never had such rave reviews and so much broccoli eaten!

Very good, like I remember my parents making when I was a kid.  I made it in my fondue pot.  Served it with toast, bacon and some sliced tomatoes.

Midnight snack worthy!  I made it last night and I scaled it down to 1 serving and even cracked an egg and used only 1/4 of it and I was patient and it thicknened beautifully and it tasted like dorritos nachos with some corn chips.  I'm going to use it as a nacho cheese spread for a party next.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as a fondue (added a little more cheese and some flour to thicken it) and had English muffin pieces as dippers.  It's a keeper!

Very good! My mom used to make this, without the beer, when I was young. Instead of the mustard (didnt have any) I used a tablespoon of prepared horseradish and it was really tasty!

My suggestion would be, instead of beer, I used a ginger ale, no egg or dry mustard. I toasted some bread and put the hot cream sauce on each slice and I topped each slice with a sliced fresh TOMATOE...salting and peppering each TOMATOE (optional)...otherwise this was good

Used it as the sauce for a Kentucky Hot Brown.  It was very good.

I introduced my husband to Welsh Rabbit with this recipe. It’s a new favorite dish for him. I toasted Sara Lee Artisan bread (it’s amazingly soft and flavorful), topped it with a 1/4” thick slice of tomato and 1 1/2 slices of crisp bacon, and the cheese sauce. Om nom nom! The recipe made enough sauce to top 8 slices of bread, and by the time I had the plates ready to serve, the cheese was thick enough to pick up the toast to eat from my hand without sauce dripping. Great for munching during movie night!

The cheese sauce was too thin and all I could taste was the beer.

I followed this recipe exactly except for I used medium cheddar (what I had), and it still came out great! My husband and I were very surprised at how good it was because we've only had the tomato soup type and weren't too crazy about that version. This, however, is almost like a fondue. Sooooo rich! This recipe will fit nicely into our Sunday breakfast rotation!

Very tasty and easy, my husband and 11 year old loved it. I made this recipe exactly as written and spooned it over toasted sourdough bread slices, then put them under the broiler for about 3 minutes until it was hot and bubbly. I sprinkled chopped dill pickles over each piece and it was a big hit. I will definitely make this again.

This made a delicious cheese sauce that I served  over grilled Tuscan bread topped with cooked chopped tomatoes.  Simple and filling, and makes a satisfying lunch.
