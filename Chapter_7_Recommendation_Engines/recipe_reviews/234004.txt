I was able to make 3 dozen cake balls as opposed to the stated 2 dozen yield. It's not listed, but I dipped my cake balls into melted white chocolate, and then into sifted cocoa powder mixed w/ a little bit of powdered sugar. They were amazing!!!!

I tried this recipe when my cousin's wife made it. I loved it. Very moist. My husband suggested I tried it with brownie mix.  So when I made it, I substituted the cake mix for a box of brownie mix and prepared the brownies according to the package directions for "cake-like" brownies. I also didn't have espresso so I just put already ground coffee into a grinder and processed it on the fine setting. It worked very well. I followed the rest of the recipe and dipped them in dark chocolate. Very yummy!! It yielded 24 servings.
