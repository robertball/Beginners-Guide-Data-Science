I made this for hubs and he loved it. His drink of choice is Captain Morgan and he said this reminded him of that. He did end up adding more bourbon but he likes his drinks strong. I think this would be perfect as written for most everyone. The best part is that it is so easy you can whip it up any time of the year. Thanks for sharing!
