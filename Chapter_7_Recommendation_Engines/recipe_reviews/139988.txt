I left out the cocoa powder and the part about the boiling water.  The biscuit pudding turned out just like my mother use to cook it.  Very, very good!

Excellent biscuit pudding recipe. I have made it with the chocolate and without. We like this pudding better without the chocolate.  When we have leftover biscuits my husband asks me to make this recipe.

Simple chocolate sauce that separates into pretty layers.  I used stale brownies instead of biscuits.  Rich doesn't cover it!

The picture that is posted was taken by me.  We enjoyed the pudding.  I had about 12 left over grand biscuits and decided to use the recipe and then half again.  Worked out well.  Mixed liquid ingredients then added dry.  I then poured the torn up biscuits into the mixture.  Let it sit about five minutes and then poured all into the dish and baked in hot water bath for one hour...
