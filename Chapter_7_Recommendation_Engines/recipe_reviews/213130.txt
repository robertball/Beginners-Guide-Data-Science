Great recipe I turned ours into a pasta instead of a ravioli- but delicious. I put hot peppers in as the eggplact cooked to add some spice and I changed the parmisiano to Pecorino and then baked it all together AMAZING!

I thought the filling could have a little something added to make it richer, but I really enjoyed the entire meal. I made everything per the recipe except I made my own homemade spinach garlic pasta. Unfortunately, my kiddos and husband didn't enjoy this meal, so I gave some to my coworkers who thought it was great. I can't win! For the amount of effort, I won't be making this again, but definitely worth trying once.

Loved the idea, liked the dish.  'Glad I tried, but no repeats.
