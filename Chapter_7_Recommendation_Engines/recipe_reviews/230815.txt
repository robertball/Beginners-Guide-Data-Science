Used my own biscuit recipe, but the sausage and gravy were outstanding!  Our son told me prior to breakfast that he wasn't that wild about sausage/gravy, but he went back for seconds on this!

Excellent... I was put off because several folks said they made the gravy, not the biscuits. They really missed out!! I hate rolling biscuits so I added about 1/8c or less milk then spoon-dropped the biscuits onto the prepared cookie sheet. I used wet hands to smooth them a bit then brushed with butter. OMG.

I am not a big fan of canned milk... do not like the "processed" taste of it.

I would use heavy cream, or "Half & Half", or milk.

As i do not like the clean-up, i use store-bought, refrigerated large  biscuits, like the brand name "Grands" (& it is a lot faster &  store-bought, refrigerated  biscuits taste just as good as homemade, & usually more flakey )

i will cut the biscuits in 1/2 , butter, & place a poached egg on each half on my biscuits & pour gravy over

Cooking time  will determine the thickness of the gravy... if you like thin, simmer less time... if you like thick, simmer more... I like a thick that will warm my belly & stick to my ribs for several hours..

I used store bought southern biscuits,  but I made this gravy per the recipe. It was absolutely delicious.  My husband often questions my ability to make a good gravy, but he loved this. I will be making this again and will keep the recipe in my recipe box.

This recipe was  excellent for both the sausage gravy and the biscuits. In the past I have made drop biscuits, but decided to use this recipe this time. For me this recipe made 7  4-5 inch biscuits plus one mini biscuit made with the leftover dough. I may have brushed them with a little too much butter, but it took about 20 minutes in the oven before they started to brown. Even so, the toothpick test showed they were done. The sausage gravy was easy and fantastic. The only change I made was to use milk instead of water as other reviews suggested. I ran out of whole milk, so about 1/2 of the water amount was almond milk and the rest was whole milk. I served this with eggs and a side of hash browns.  While I made the eggs and hash browns, the gravy had to sit a bit in the pan, and then I rewarmed it when everything else was done. The gravy turned out wonderfully thick, and the biscuits held up much better than the drop biscuits I have made in the past. I had leftovers of both and froze them for a future meal. We all loved this recipe, and I will definitely be making it again.

THE SAUSAGE GRAVY IS DELICIOUS.MY HUSBAND SAYS IT'S A KEEPER. I MADE THE BISCUITS THIS TIME BUT I WILL NOT MAKE THEM AGAIN. I WILL BUY REFRIGERATOR BISCUITS NEXT TIME.
THE SAUSAGE GRAVY IS A FIVE STAR BUT THE BISCUITS BROUGHT IT DOWN TO A FOUR STAR...SORRY.

I do not like biscuits and gravy.  My husband loves biscuits and gravy and was delighted with this recipe.  I ate the biscuits and they were wonderful.  Hubby wants me to save it so he could eat it in the morning and keep the recipe to make gravy.  GOOD Job

These biscuits were delicious and the gravy was very good. I didn't have evaporated milk so I just used 3 cups of whole milk. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I used canned  biscuits because I didn't want the mess or hassle with "rolling my own dough" lol
 The gravy was perfect! I've been looking to have some good ole fashion biscuits and gravy - and I found the place.. right here!!

There are two reasons I'm only giving this recipe a 4 instead of 5.  First, I didn't make the biscuits, I used canned, so I don't know how that part of the recipe is.  Second, just as my gravy was starting to thicken, I got an important phone call and wasn't able to give it the attention it deserved.  I turned off the burner and the gravy cooled some before I could back to it and I didn't feel like messing with it any more.  I just dished some out and reheated it in the microwave.  It probably could have used a little more milk because it was just a slight bit floury tasting, but it was still very good.  I'll try it again, but may use heavy cream or milk instead of canned milk.

I only made the gravy (used canned biscuit dough). It took longer to thicken, but no huge deal. It needed a little more flavor, so I'd try white pepper next time, I think.

Good recipe!  Buy frozen biscuits...taste like homemade!  Two tips that get me lots of compliments on my gravy:  Cook for a LONG time after adding the flour until it is a golden brown, toasty color.  Adds so much flavor...much like making a roux in Cajun cooking.  Also, add a half teaspoon of paprika to your gravy after adding the milk...no need to use canned milk. I also don't drain the grease or add butter.  I use Jimmy Dean Lean sausage to reduce the fat.  The milk adds all the moisture you need.

Easy to make and tasted great.  I did not have canned milk so I used mike. The biscuit recipe  turned out perfect, not like the last one I tried.

My family and I really enjoyed this . I didn't have regular milk so I used almond milk mixed with evaporated milk. It still turned out good. I'll make this again using regular milk and see what difference makes

Disappointed - I followed the gravy recipe exactly, used my own biscuit recipe.  The gravy was OK but not even close to gravy made with whole milk.  May be slight less fatty. But hey, they are Biscuit and Gravy not tofu and broccoli.

I know the homemade biscuits are better but I have used the refrigerated store bought biscuits at times. Usually because friends are visiting and time doesn't allow. The pork gravy is terrific even to a southern friend we had visiting. A very easy recipe even for beginners. Also this recipe keeps well if prepared ahead.

I make a very similar gravy.  I add minced onions, poultry seasoning and a pinch of Cayenne.  Agree with the others, use all milk in lieu of water.

This is the second time I made this. I forgot I needed evaporated milk and used skim milk instead. It still turned out great.
