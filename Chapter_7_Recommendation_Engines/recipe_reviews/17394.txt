Ummmm...let me say that I LOVE amaretto and semi-sweet chocolate, and THIS is terrible.  So bitter and so strong that I think it must be missing an ingredient - such as SUGAR.  I added about 1 cup of powdered sugar mixed with a little water and then added that to the chocolate/amaretto paste - helped quite a bit.  Result was a very dark, nearly bittersweet, shiny, chocolate glaze.

Can't IMAGINE using the recipe as written - it has to have some type of sweetening to be palatable.

This frosting is absolutely AMAZING! I don't think I could come up with a single bad thing to say about it if I tried!

Very, very rich chocolate frosting.  We liked it, but when used on a chocolate cake you really need a dish of vanilla ice cream or a cold glass of milk to help off-set the richness of all the chocolate.

I thought that this icing was a little bit liquidey (mind you, I do prefer a thicker consistency) so I added another stick (1/2 c) of butter. It was a great texture after that. Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Very good but I don't think I'd use it for cake again. Would be delicious over coffee ice cream or as a dip.
