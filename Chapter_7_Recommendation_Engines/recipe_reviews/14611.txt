This was one of the best things I have ever made.  My husband kept commenting on how good it was through the whole meal.  I read all the reviews and made some changes:  I omitted the orange peel, substituted 2 tsp of sesame oil for the 2 tbl vegetable oil, used 3 cloves of garlic, substituted 1 tsp candied ginger (minced) for the 1/2 tsp of powdered ginger, I used orange juice in place of the sherry, used "sweet orange marmalade," and added 2 tsp brown sugar to the sauce.  I marinated the beef in 1 cup of orange juice for several hours (this helped tenderize it).  I drained the beef and then stir fried it in 1 tsp sesame oil.  I removed the beef, drained out the juices, added another tsp of sesame oil to the pan and then stir fried red bell pepper (cut in strips), broccoli, and carrots (cut in strips) until just tender, then I added the garlic and ginger, stirred, then added the beef back to the pan.  I immediately poured in the sauce.  Just before removing from the heat, I added snow pea pods and green onions.  I served it over brown rice.  This was an awesome one dish meal.  I used about 9 ounces of meat, so my version served two large portions.

I'm so glad I read the other reviews, because with a couple slight changes, this is an awesome dish!!  I left out the orange zest, used stated amount of marmalade.  I upped the garlic slightly and doubled the amount of red pepper because we like very spicy food.  And I added fresh mushrooms and carrots after the meat was done cooking.  The orange flavor is subtle, and the sauce is thick, sticky, and delicious over rice.  I would like to know if there's a reason you're supposed to cook the beef in batches?  I cooked it all at once, then drained the liquid from the wok, then returned the beef and veggies to the wok and finished cooking, and it was fine.  BTW, this would be even better with chicken.  I think another reviewer said this was like eating at a good Asian restaurant -- I got that same impression!  You have to try this recipe!

A really great recipe, though I did make a few modifications. Firstly, the 1/4 cup of orange peel seemed a bit scary so I took a prior reviewer's advice and made very wide strips of peel so their flavor came through but you didn't get mouthfuls of peel in every bite. I used fresh ginger instead of ground. After browning the beef and before adding in the peel, garlic and ginger, I added 1/2 cup of sliced onion and cooked a few minutes before continuing with the rest of the recipe. And, finally, I threw some snow pea pods in at the end to add some color.

I read the previous reviews and sort of incorporated all types of things.  I used round steak and I cut it into thin strips, marinated it in soy sauce, garlic, red pepper flakes and the juice of one orange.  I then stir fried it adding in the ginger and 4 big chunks of orange peel.  Then I added the broth, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, cornstarch and orange marmalade mixture.  This was OUTSTANDING !!!!!!  Next time I think I will use a different cut of meat, but other than that...oh and I also added shredded carrots and water chestnuts...very VERY good.  I will also add broccoli next time as that would just make it over the top wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe and the suggestions by those who came before me !

If I make this again, I'll skip the orange zest-it made the orange flavor very overpowering.

I have to go with the majority on this recipe, I thought it was just wonderful. I, too, did not put in the orange zest as suggested by many of the other reviewers, and I think the orange taste was strong enough. I fried the beef in a little sesame oil, and added in some thai chili paste (hot, hot, hot! I add this to almost every meat I stir fry), and only added scallions for vegetables. I doubled the amount of sauce, next time I will probably just do 1 1/2 times the sauce unless I add more vegetables. The sauce thickened up immediately after putting it in the hot pan, definitely do not walk away from it.

This recipie was great. I followed the advice of others and just used large chunks of orange peel. I stir fryed the orange peel with fresh grated ginger, garlic, onions, and carrots. Then I pulled out the orange peel and added the remaining ingredients. I also didn't have any cornstarch and just used a couple of spoons of flour to thicken it up. Will definately make again!

We all really loved this recipe. I left out the zest and doubled the marmalade. I also added green onions and sugar snap peas and served it over white rice...it was delicious! I also printed out the recipe and gave it to my grandmother (she's an awesome cook) and her whole household loved it as well. Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious!!! I also left out the orange zest (because I didn't have any) and I added broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts. I put it over white rice and it tasted like I was eating food from a restaurant.

EXCELLENT! Substituted the Sherry with Orange juice and also marinated it in OJ. I also did not add the orange peel (as I didn't have any!). It was very full of orange flavor, but just the way I like it! Thanks for an awesome recipe! I actually made my first *SUCCESSFUL* Chinese dish..

I'm sorry, but I just did not care for this recipe as it is written. It is very quick to make, but following the recipe, there was hardly any orange taste. I left out the red pepper flakes because my family doesn't care for anything too spicy, but I added everything else exactly as written. I had to add almost 3/4-1 cup of orange juice to the beef/sauce mixture to taste any orange flavoring. Definitely not what were are used to having at the local Chinese restaurants. We paired this recipe with one of the authetic egg roll recipes on this site in order to get our veggies in because there are none in this recipe. Some broccoli on the side would have been good with it. Unfortunately, we were so unimpressed that we won't be making it again to see.

Not very sweet, not too spicy, has a weird "twang" to it (as husband stated.) It's O.K. I'd have to probably cut down the soy a bit and maybe add a little sugar and orange or lemon juice as well.

Family really liked this. I followed the directions for ingredients. I did stir-fry the beef in the morning and then added that to everything else except the cornstarch. That night I added the cornstarch and quickly heated it up and served it over rice I had also made earlier. Was ready to eat in under five minutes! Faster than driving for take-out!
Served with Broccoli and French bread.

My family loves this recipe. I did make the following changes:  I used much less orange peel, doubled everything else, and left out the peas and marmalade - if you do use the marmalade it will be way too "orangey" flavored. We've made it twice and loved it both times. It cooks quickly and is very spicy doubled.

I used 1 1/2 lbs of meat and therefore, took the sauce recipe by 1 1/2 (all except the red pepper, which I reduced to 1/4 tsp despite the increase in other ingrediants).  I also omitted the orange zest and added 1 1/2 bags of frozen stir fry veggies the last few minutes of cooking.  We all liked the flavor but everyone except myself thought this was too spicy(to my surprise...since I reduced the pepper amt). I will make this again but reduce the red pepper even further to 1/8 tsp for my family's sake.

We don't cook red meat very often and decided to give this recipe a try to expand our meat horizons - We thought this was delicious!  I followed some of the other reviews used orange juice instead of sherry and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and 86-ed the orange peel.  After cooking the beef I sauteed onions, carrots and mushrooms, then added the garlic, ginger and beef back in.  I highly recommend adding the extra veggies and next time I will try the snow peas or broccoli as some other folks recommended.  I added a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes and it was plenty spicy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm new to cooking and decided to give this a try, since it's pretty simple. This is a delicious recipe. I omitted the garlic (I'm allergic) and it was still soooo tasty! It's rare to find a recipe for Asian-style food that still has a lot of flavor without the garlic. The first time I made it I didn't have cornstarch and tried using flour instead. That didn't work...I invested in some corn starch and it made the sauce thick and perfect! This also tastes great with chicken.

This is pretty good. I did a few things differently. First, I made the whole thing in the crockpot. Second, I used sirloin since we don't like round steak. I first seasoned and seared the sirloin like you would a pot roast. Then I slow cooked it whole for a few hours before taking it out and thinly slicing it. Put the slices back and let it continue for a few more hours. Like others, I didn't have sherry so I used OJ. Didn't bother with orange peel, either. I did use substantially more crushed red along with some cayenne because we are spice freaks. I also used more orange marmalade since I didn't think the orange flavor was quite strong enough (IMO, soy sauce tends to overpower a lot of other flavors). Finally, I added mushrooms to give it more body. Served it over jasmine rice and it was a pretty big hit!

Incredibly aromatic and wonderfully balanced flavor. After browning the beef I added sliced onions and peppers to saute a few minutes. Then added back the beef and followed the recipe as specified. Paired w/ Fried Rice - excellent!

This recipe has way too much orange peel.  I recommend taking it out completely.  If not, at least cut it by half.  I also added extra garlic and used fresh ginger rather than ground ginger.  The sauce flavor is really good, but the orange peel makes it bad.

My family loved this recipe. I also subsituted OJ for the brandy. One change was that I assembled all ingredients into a mixing cup and after browning the meat and adding in a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables I poured sauce over the top and let it reduce down. Very quick and very easy. The most time consuming aspect was grating the orange peel but now I'll take the advice posted her and only quarter the peel to remove later.

I marinated the meat in some soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger paste, minced garlic and 3/4 cup orange juice for 30 minutes.  

While the meat was marinating - I grated one large carrot and sliced one large red pepper.  I cut one orange in quarters (removed the fruit for my daughter to enjoy) then cut two of the quarters in thick long strips.  

I prepped the remaining ingredients so they would be ready to go (garlic, ginger paste **do not use ground ginger if you can avoid it** and the orange peel slices in one small bowl...  the broth, soy sauce, crushed red pepper, etc... in another bowl) 

After cooking the meat, I set it aside and drained most of the remaining liquid from the pan - reserving just enough to cook the veggies for a few minutes to get them tender.  Then I followed the remainder of the recipe.  

***Please note my following changes/omissions***  

I do not use alcohol in any of my cooking, but I am aware of the substitutes - so instead of sherry I used 1/3 cup of orange juice with one teaspoon of alcohol free vanilla extract.  I didn't have any beef broth so I used a large chicken buillion cube instead (you can also try a vegetable buillion cube too, this has worked well for me in the past).  I also used 1/2 tablespoon of crushed red pepper for a more spicier flavor.

While this was an easy version of Orange Beef, it wasn't quite as tasty as I thought it would be.  It does make a lot of sauce and holds up well to adding vegetables to it.  (I had some leftover so the next night I added some pea pods.  Looked nice and tasted better.)

Cooked it and it was pretty good. I followed the recipe but the sauce came out pretty thick. I think I need to you use less corn starch next time. Otherwise, great meal and not hard to make. If you have orange marmalade with some orange peels in them, then I think you can knix the orange peels for zest. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit in my house!  I skipped the orange peel as suggested by other reviews and rather than sautee the garlic and ginger, i just mixed them into the sauce mix and poured it all in at the same time.   I made 1.5x the sauce beacause I had about 1.5 lbs of round steak but I don't think I really needed to, it was plenty of sauce.  Could have been a bit thicker for presentation sake, but I will definitely be making it again!

This had some of the right flavors and textures but it wasn't that orange-y. I might try mixing this recipe with another and add orange concentrate and marinate the meat first.

Excellent! :)

This recipe was OK, but it was no where near as good as P.F.Changs.  The soy sauce needs to be reduced a lot b/c the original recipe was too salty and the red pepper flakes could be doubled.

I took suggestions from others and marinated the beef in soy sauce, garlic, orange juice and red pepper.  I then sauteed it with the large chunks of orange peel and the orange marmalade mixture.  It was very good - especially the sauce.  I might try a different kind of beef next time.  Overall very good.

I thought this was one of the best stir fry recipes I've tried.  I added a little more orange marmalade than it called for and it was awesome.  I'll probably make this at least once a month.

I took the advice of the others who tried this before to put chunks of orange peel in the stir fry to "infuse" the essence because I thought that the 1/4 cup orange peel wouldn't go over well with my family.  I also added stir fry vegetables and water chestnuts.  It was excellent!  Easy and great for something different.  Thank you!

I drastically cut the orange zest to just a tablespoon that I used for garnish right before serving.  I added 1 cup sliced mushrooms, 1 cup snow pea pods and sliced red pepper.  When I make this next time, I will play around with different vegetable combos because I really think it needs the veggies.

This is fabulous. I served it over "Asian Coconut Rice" (recipe on this site also) and they are great together. I added some veggies and upped the heat with some white pepper and extra red pepper. Also, I was feeling a little lazy so I skipped the orange zest and added more marmalade which worked just fine. Still a nice orange flavor, but not too much.

This was fabulous. It was super easy and quick, which is perfect for a working mom like myself. The sause thickens up nicely and has a tasty, rich flavor. I highly reccomend adding the cornstarch to the bowl first then slowly mixing the broth in while stirring, this makes the corn starch dissolve properly. I really liked it with the orange peal. It has a subtle flavor, not too strong.

Based on earlier reviews, I left out the peel but otherwise prepared as directed.  This was a quick, delicious dish that I will make again.  There was just enough orange for my taste.  Next time, I'm considering marinating the meat prior to cooking as other reviews have suggested and may increase the spiciness factor a touch to suit my own tastes (I like things really spicy!)  Thank you Christine!!

I loved this dish! After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to alter it just a little bit. I used top sirloin steak and marinated it in a little soy sauce and beef broth and brown sugar. I dried the beef off before putting into the skillet and then took it out and there was a fair amount of liquid in the pan from the marinade, so I used only about 1 tsp. of the orange zest and stirfried that with the garlic and ginger and added about 1/2 cup of shredded carrots...cooked till they were tender and added back the beef and then the sauce. It was delicious and I agree with the others who said it was on par with restaurant fare. I do think tho, that using the entire amount of the orange peel might make it too bitter or give it a funny flavor...I used the entire amount of the marmalade and I'm glad that I did! Excellent recipe!

I must admit, it was pretty good.  I included all of the ingredients except orange zest.  I decided to put in 1/2 instead of 1/4 cup of orange marmalade because it didn't look enough.  It was, indeed, very orangey but I loved it.  I would make this dish again and it's an excellent recipe for people who don't want to spend much time in the kitchen.

This was amazing! I made this last night and my husband, son and I loved it! Alot of the reviews had said to lessen the amount of marmalade but I didn't. I actually added a little more and I also added about two tablespoons of brown sugar and it was perfect! I will definitely be making this one again soon. Thank for another great recipe.

This dinner was quick and easy...and very ummy.  The only thing I would change is the amount of orange peel and to use fresh ginger instead of the powdered.

This recipe is a good starting point.  Many previous reviewers said that the orange zest lended too much orange flavor.  I omitted the orange zest, but I didn't think there was enough orange flavor.  Next time I'm going to omit the orange zest, but replace the sherry with orange juice.  I think that will give it the perfect balnce w/o having the orange flavor be too overpowering.

It was a nice change of pace, but I thought the orange zest was not good at all.

this would have been WAY to spicy for me if I had used all of the red pepper, as it is I used half, and it had quite a kick. I also added some chopped broccoli, and sliced green peppers, at the stir-fry stage. All in all this is a great recpipe. Better than what you might get a most chinese food places.

Really yummy!  I used a little less orange zest and added some veggies.  I have also made it with chicken and that is good too!

My husband and I really liked it.  The orange zest was not favoured by the kids.  I used top sirloin steak and I could of had hotter chili peppers. I also added some chopped green onions. It has a very nice sauce to put over rice.

This recipe took me quite awhile to prepare due to the need for orange zest.  Not only that, but the flavor was not what I am used to when getting spicy orange beef from a good oriental restaurant.

I left out the sherry and substituted water. Also did not have enought orange marmalade, so substituted apricot jam. Everyone loved it and it was quick and easy. Grating the orange zest was the longest part of the recipe. Will definitely make this again!

My husband, 19-year old son, and I thought this was delicious.   Yes, it was very easy/fast to make for our rush hour dinner, while the brown rice was cooking.  The only substitutes:  I used sesame oil instead of the vegetable oil, and I had on hand some homemade ginger marmalade.  Very flavourful, and we loved the orange and ginger accents.  Definitely will make again.

I suspect the real problem with this is the "1/4 cup orange peel, cut into slivers".

A dozen  people will produce a dozen different amounts, some far too much and some far too little.

Things that are compressible or fluffy shouldn't be measured by volume.
"1 cup of spinach" could be 2 or 3 leaves, or several dozen.
It all depends upon whether you pack it in, and how tightly.

This was DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper recipe for me. I added about 6 cups of stir-fried vegetables and there was still plenty of sauce/glaze for them. I do prefer my sauces thicker, so I will add extra cornstarch in the future.

Excellent recipe! I 1/2 the recipe but am sorry I did. I loved the result and wish I had more leftovers. 

The only varations I did was to use Apricot Jelly instead of the Marmalade since that was the closest thing I had in the house. When I finished with the orange peel it seemed like so much so I only ended up using half of what the recipe called for. Oh, and I didn't have Sherry so replaced it with juice from the orange. 

Of note, when I initally ate it I didn't notice much heat from the red pepper flakes and was thinking I should have added more... BUT... the heat was more prominent with the leftovers. I actually preferred it reheated. 

I definately want to try this with chicken and think it would be equally as great on meatballs.

Excellent flavors! I followed the recipe exactly. A little too much sauce for our family. But, I had some leftover grilled steak that I sliced, and then tossed with the leftover sauce. It was really good! Next time I will grill the steak, slice it, then finish in a very small amount of oil and then add in the sauce.  This will cut down on the fat.  I also will cut the broth and cornstarch in half.  I'm going to try it with chicken too!

After reading reviews, I chose not to use orange peel, but did use orange zest in it's place.  I also did not have orange marmalade and used fresh orange juice in it's place.  I doubled the sauce and added broccoli to the mix.

This was SOOOO good! I substituted flour since I didn't have any cornstarch, omitted the sherry and used Sesame Oil instead of vegetable oil, but other than that, I followed the recipe and it was DELICIOUS!!! Also added carrots and asparagus to the cooked meat and let it simmer until tender.

This was great! I somewhat kept true to the recipe, instead of slivers, I used a vegetable peeler and got large chunks of orange peel so my daughter wouldn't spend all evening picking out little bits of peel. Other then that, I marinated the steak in soy sauce, orange juice, orange marmalade, and olive oil for a few hours. I'm not a big fan of round steak, as it always seems to over cook for me. Most of my strips ended up being cooked medium or so, but I think my problem was not cutting them thin enough. Either way, that would be my fault. My sauce didn't thicken as quickly, so I whisked some additional soy sauce and corn starch together and got it thick before anything had a chance to cool down. Great dinner, everyone cleaned their plates and I snuck back out for seconds.

Passed the 'make again' test hands down!
My family loved it.Didn't vary much from the original - used 1/2 an orange & cut the peel very very thin (whats orange beef with out the orange?) added about 2 heaping Tsp of the marmalade 'cause I didn't feel like using a measuring cup
Also used a sesame and canola oil mix
Picked up a large white rice to go from a local Chinese take out & made some stir fry broccoli in hoisin sauce on the side. My kids thought everything came from the restaurant. Next time I'll try it with the real little peppers found in the Asian market just to kick it up a notch.

Everyone in my family LOVED this dish.  Even my 3 year old son ate it all without a fuss!  We will definatly make this one again. I did marinate the meat overnight in the soy sauce/orange marmalade mixture and I also stir-fried red onions and carrots with the meat. Oh, and I left the orange peel in big peices and fished them out.  It was amazing!! Thanks for the recipe and the reviews!

Excellent!  The only change I made to the recipe was to use thinly sliced Delmonico steak & onions (which I marinated in juice from the zested orange).  Served over brown rice and added in a bag of steamed broccoil, cauliflower, & carrots.  We were out of fresh veggies and these worked just fine.  Perfect meal served with a piece of Texas toast.  Great orange taste with added zest from the pepper flakes.

Hubby said that the orange was way too strong and it made the entire dish bitter.  Won't be making this again.   :-(

I really wanted to like this dish but it was just ok I used seville orange marmalade (was on sale) which might have affected the taste.

We thought this was pretty good.
I also added more pepper flakes because we like spicy and 1/2 the amount of orange zest, which I thought was perfect. I was out of sherry, so just used 1/4 cup of white wine.  And I added extra garlic just because I like it.

Not spicy at all, but still good. Left out the orange zest/peel and didn't miss it (I don't like that chewy texture in my orange beef).

I found this recipe a few years ago. I made it one time and lost the recipe in moving and could not remember where I got it from.
My children still complain that I haven't made it again.

Neither my wife nor I cared for this.  I believe I followed the recipe correctly but this did not taste like orange beef we have had before.  Trying to put it into words, I believe it was just too strong.  Maybe too much sherry.  We both love spicy foods and this really could have used more spice, but that wasn't the problem.

This was a nice addition to a chinese birthday buffet for my sister.  I marinated filet in low-sodium soy, garlic, ginger and OJ for several hours, and added red and green peppers and onion to the stir fry.  I used the zest of one orange (about two tablespoons) to finish.  Nice, mellow orange flavor, definitely not overpowering.  My only change would be to decrease the amount of sauce, just a bit too soupy (probably because of the additional liquid in the marinade), by using less beef broth.  Thanks for sharing!

After reading the reviews, I left out the orange peel completely.  I (4*) liked this more than my husband (2*).  Added steamed broccoli to the sauce then served with take-out fried rice.

4 stars just because it's a little boring with just meat.  Yes, it's good over rice, but it needs a veggie or two.  I used pork instead of steak, it was very tasty, I will try steak next time and I will try adding green/rec peppers and maybe onions or carrots next time.

This was ok.  I guess the orange and the beef combination was just too strange for my boys.  But I too felt as though it was lacking something... maybe spice or sweet.  Not really sure.  I followed recipe exactly and it was certainly easy.  It just didn't appeal to our taste buds. Sorry.

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  Instead of omitting the orange peel, just cut two 1/2 inch slices the length of the orange, you will be able to remove them later - I think they are necessary to get the full flavor of the orange, the marmalade isn't enough.

After reading all the mixed reviews, I didn't know if I should even try this dish, but I'm glad I did. It turned out really good. The little bit of red pepper did not make it too spicy and the orange marmalade lent a subtle orange flavor. I added green pepper for some color.

This was very good. I used the orange zest (more than called for) but I may cut back on it just a little. I thought the orange flavor was a little bit too much. I didn't have any sherry so I used rice wine instead. I think I might also lessen the amount of soy sauce - it was a little strong. I added broccoli and water chestnuts and it turned out great.

This was really good. I made this for Christmas Day dinner. I made the following alterations: Used 1/2 T oil instead of 2, marinated the beef in the juice from one orange, zested one orange, three cloves of garlic, white wine instead of sherry and more red pepper. I also added sliced carrots, chinese pea pods and water chestnuts. I also added some dried orange zest to the sauce mix because I like orange! Next time, the only change I am going to make is add a bit of brown sugar to the sauce to make it a bit sweeter and maybe some more zest.

This was fantastic! My husband said it was in the top five of my everyday dinners. I did alter a little as I always do, no sherry so I used juice squeezed from one orange, I zested the orange instead of cutting into strips. I only used 1/4 tsp. of pepper flakes, it was almost too hot, so be careful. I ended up using a 14 oz. can of beef broth & 1/2 cup marmalade so I would have more sauce & added a few teaspoons of rice wine vinegar. I will be making this one again & again.

This was very good! I didnt use the orange zest b/c the orange marm. I bought already had zest in it. I also used orange juice instead of sherry as another review suggested, and doubled the amount of red pepper and marmalade. It was good, but I didnt think it was too orangy. I might just stick to ordering out :)

Fairly easy to make but it lacked depth. It gave the essence of orange and heat but it didn't stay on the palate. Too heavy on the soy I think. Not sure what else to add but I won't make this again. That being said, my husband like it!

This recipe has lots of potential.  I wish I had read the previous reviews before adding all that zest. I haved the zest because I had a feeling it was too much and it was still a little too much, although the rice that I had with it mellowed it out a bit.  Next time I will only use a tablespoon.  I felt that the amount of marmalade was fine.  
I would recommend using flour instead of cornstarch if you don't have any because I did it and it turned out thick enough for me.
For those who like spicy chinese food, I would at least double the amount of redpepper flakes.  I will probably make this again with the above changes.  Thanks for the recipe

The marmalade ended up adding way too much orange flavor.  I'm also not sure if I let it sit long enough, the beef was a little bland on the inside.

good chinese recipe. I omited the orange zest as others suggested and the orange taste was perfect - not too overpowering

Followed previous suggestions and scaled WAY back on orange - didn't add the zest and it was still enough.  My 14-yr-old daughter didn't care for it.  I thought it was OK.  Probably won't make it again.

FABULOUS! This is probably the best recipe that I have tried on this internet site.  It is just as good as any meat stir fry dish you'd order at an oriental restaurant. You must try this.  I took the reviewers suggestions and left out the orange zest and it was "perfect".  Just enought sweet, just enough spice - A Must For Everyone To Try.

WOW! REALLY orangey. Next time I would use only 1/4 C. zest and 1/4 C. marmalade. Otherwise very tasty and easy to make! A little too spicy and strong flavored for the kiddos. :)

My husband and I both liked this recipe fairly well. I think I will make the dish again, however I will cut back a little on the orange marmalade and pepper.  The amount of pepper they suggest made it a little too spicy for my tastes.

We tried it with the stir-fry beef from the grocery and it was very tough (suprise!). The kids found the sauce too spicy also. Next time we'll use a better cut of beef and less orange zest.

Pretty good but just a bit sweet for us. I will scale back on the marmalade. This is basically what I was looking for was the sauce.

I also did not use zest but added two clementines segmented. Also no sherry so I added additional broth. And lots of veggies: broccoli, snow peas, red onion and orange peppers. YUM!

The sauce in this recipe is delicious!  I intended to make this with beef, as the recipe calls for, but then realized I didn't have beef in the freezer.  Other reviewers had commented that this works well with chicken, so I made it that way.  I did follow one other reviewers suggestion, using sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, orange juice instead of sherry, increasing the garlic, and sauteing onions, red pepper, mushrooms, and shredded carrots, then adding that to the chicken before adding the sauce.  We served this over brown rice.  We will be making this again, and I don't know of anything I would change.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Tasty. I made it similar to the recipe that Michelle Miller Motley described. I marinaded the beef in orange juice. I used more garlic than called for, and I used grated fresh ginger. I cut the amount of orange peel in half, and used small Chinese oranges.  For the sauce, I used dry white wine instead of sherry and added a bit of brown sugar. I added various veggies to the sauce when cooking, including celery, yellow pepper, carrots, broccoli, and also the small Chinese orange. It was good and  I will make it again.

Orange Beef is our fav dish from the local Chinese food place we like. Been looking for something to get close to how they make it and this is decent. Orange peel is NOT needed they will over power the dish! Marinate your beef strips in orange juice for about an hour it will help keep them tender. I went about 1.5 times the orange marmalade then tossed in some green onion right at the end for color. Sauteed red peppers and slivered carrots can help complete the dish but I served mine over fried brown rice with stir fry veggies from Trader Joe's.

Very tasty. I made three minor changes
1. Instead of the sliced orange peel, I only zested about a tablespoon in when I added the liquid.
2. I used 1.5 pounds of meat
3. I sliced a couple of green onions in at the end

This will be added to the dinner rotation

Very tasty, will make again.  Followed recipe completely, slicing orange peel very thinly (without pith) and beef dish had a wonderful orangey, and mildly spicy flavor.  My husband really liked it, and asked that I make it again sometime.

Oh, my goodness! This was so good. I served it on brown rice and used sesame  seed oil instead of vegetable oil. Threw in some broccoli florets, carrot, spirilized summer squash and some leftover leeks that I had chopped up. The basics were there but i needed a good stir fry to feed my hunger. .Thanks for a great recipe.

This dish has some good flavors, but as is typical for our family, we actually found it needed MORE flavor, not less. Keep in mind that we live in a very diverse town and frequently eat Indian, Brazilian, and Thai cuisine (as well as visiting our local Chinatown)  so our tastebuds are quite high-maintenance :) If this describes your palate too, read on.

 I used 1/3 cup of diced orange peel, added a full teaspoon of crushed red pepper, and bumped up the tang factor with a splash of rice vinegar into the finished sauce at the end. I'm not sure why so many people recommend leaving out the orange peel-- that's what orange beef is all about, and leaving it out just gives the dish a bland teriyaki-like flavor. In addition, DO NOT use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I did this and ended up with a gloopy "sauce" that congealed  as it cooled  and had a starchy aftertaste. Two teaspoons would suffice to gently thicken the sauce.

This recipe makes a LOT of sauce for the amount of beef; the beef strips are swimming in it! Next time I'll steam some broccoli and sugar snaps to throw in there and bulk up the dish. With my modifications, this is really yummy!

Very good. I served it with fried rice. I think next time i'll zest the orange peel instead.

Thanks for posting this quick, easy, and flexible recipe! No leftovers. I made it with chicken thigh meat and replaced the beef broth with 3/4 c. chicken broth and 1/4 c. orange juice, because I didn't have an orange (or beef). Scooped out the liquid from the skillet a few times instead of cooking in batches and draining on towels, because I am lazy. Still came out awesome!

This  was good...however the next time I make it I'm pretty sure it will be significantly better.   I made a few substitutions because I didn't have what the recipe called for.  I won't make that mistake again.  I think the most valuable feedback that others wrote and I ignored was how overpowering the orange peel is.  I will omit it next time.   I'd like to have the meat have a little crunch to it so will dredge it through some flour.   I'll let ya'll know w it turns out.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was delicious. Very kid-friendly. We didn't think the orange peel was too much at all, as others have commented.

This  recipe can be made great but is not so good as it is, thus 2 stars.
It needs much more seasoning so I added a lot more garlic and ginger as well as sesame oil and spicy chipotles in adobo sauce.
For starters,  I would never use round steak since it is a tough cut of meat.  I used flank steak, sliced thinly across the grain.
The reason to cook the meat in small batches is so that it sautees and doesn't boil in its own juices.
The orange marmalade was too sweet for my taste.  I used orange rind and orange juice.  Wonderful flavor.  About a tsp of brown sugar.  
I stir fried broccoli and added it at the end.  Next time would use snow peas.  Topped the dish off with toasted sesame seeds and carrot slivers for color.  That was excellent but fairly different than the original.

We loved it! We also love citrus and ginger. I used the orange peal - we didn't find the flavor too strong. It was great. I used more ginger - a couple of teaspoons. It was nice to have two kinds of heat - the chili paste and the ginger.  I was concerned about the meat having flavor because it isn't marinated but the sauce was fabulous. We will definitely make this again and share it!

When I saw the name of the recipe I immediately wanted to try it but the ingredients did sort of scare me a little.  After reading the reviews I had no idea which way to go to make it.
I went with marinating the meat  in orange juice, browning in a mix of vegetable and sesame oil.  I added broccoli, carrots, peppers and onions. Sauce of marmalade and soy sauce with a dash of sirracha. Served with wild rice mixture.
Was very good!

This was very yummy! Like many others, I left out the orange rind. At the very end, I tossed steamed veggies in with the beef and sauce. I added sliced colorful peppers, some red onion, snow peas, sliced zucchini. I would have added sliced carrots, but I didn't have any on hand.

My family loved this dish! They all went back for seconds. Good thing I had doubled it. I used sirloin just because I'm not a fan of chewy meat. I didn't have sherry so I used red wine vinegar. I also used fresh ginger. I think it made the whole dish POP! Added steamed bagged broccoli too. Wonderful, quick dinner!

No need for the orange peel.  The orange marmalade gave it a strong orange flavor, I'm afraid the orange peel might over do it.  The recipe was really easy to make and tasted very good served over rice.  I cut up green, yellow, and red bell pepper to go with the meal.

This was incredible. Even my 2 year old ate it, and he normally won't eat protein. I substituted orange juice for the sherry, and left out the orange peel completely. I also added a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies when the meat was almost done. We will have this frequently.

This recipe was awesome.  We all loved it.  The only thing I chaged was I omitted the orange peel and added 1/2 cup marmalade.  Only because I didn't have the peel.  It was so easy to prepare.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

I made the recipe today, and althought it was quick and easy -- I made sure to read the reviews for any extra tips. For all the reviews that say dip your beef in corn starch before frying -- don't do it. I made this mistake and when I went to add the ingredients for the sauce, it thickened wayyy to much and the cooked corn strach made the sauce lumpy. My other recommendation is to add orange juice to the recipe. It really helps to add favour to the dish. I would all recommend adding some veggies like peppers, onions and green beans to jazz up the dish a bit.     Other then that it tasted pretty good.

My husband and I love this recipe. I added steamed broccoli and sauted onion to complete the meal. As many people recommended , I omitted orange zest, but would add it the next time. Marmalade was not enough for a strong orange flavour.

This is a great recipe. The only modifications I made were that I used sirloin steak instead of round steak (which I like better in a stir fry) and instead of the sherry ( I didn't have any) I used a 1/4 cup of orange juice. The next time I make this I'll add some vegetables, like peapods or broccoli, but just the meat and sauce by itself is really good. You would think with the orange zest, marmalade and orange juice I added, the citrus flavor might be too strong, but it was just right! My son raved about it! This is a keeper.

The recipe had way too much zest in it.  My husband kept saying, "all I taste is orange".  I will definitely make it again tho' as I think with the omission of the zest or a very reduced amount, we will really like it.  Like other reviews I saw, I might use flank steak instead of round also.  Made and served with the rice in the picture, it was a quick meal.

This is a good recipe. Omit the orange peel as marmalade has orange peel in it. I made it with the orange peel and it was loaded with bitter orange taste which took away from the dish. Make with broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts. Very good...just enough red pepper to give it a slight kick. I am going to try the orange juice trick next time.

This was too sweet and sticky and didn't have enough orange flavor.

This was very tasty. I also omitted the orange peel; the marmalade on it's own was very orangey and had zest in it. I do wish however that I could find an orange beef recipe closer to the PF Chang's/Pei Wei version. Also, I decided to skimp on the red pepper because my hubby can't handle spice, but we both wish I would have used the amount called for, as it was not spicy at all.

This was a delicious meal! I didn't think it was too spicy but I really like spicy food so others may have found it spicy. I took the tip to marinate it with the juice from 1 orange and some soy sauce before cooking. I also did not include the orange peels, but i did put in about a tablespoon of orange zest to the sauce. It was excellent, i plan on making it again!

Quick to prepare - I used leftover steak and only prepared the sauce. It was a little too spicy for me; however, my husband liked it. I also liked the fact I could prepare it from my pantry items without making any special purchases. Oh - and I added half a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables - then served over rice.

Pretty good stuff.  I sliced and marinated the beef in soy sauce overnight.  If you do that you definitely don't need to add more soy sauce to the recipe.  I'd say this took me longer than 15 minutes to cook, especially since I was cooking up a little more beef than the recipe called for, and turned out to be about a half hour to make, not counting measuring out ingredients and other prep work.
Tasty, if not quick.  I'll make this again!

Great flavors of spice and orange, and if you do all chopping and measuring ahead, it takes just minutes to get this on the table. Make the rice ahead of time and keep it warm.

This is a fantastic and very easy dish!  After reading the reviews on here, I omitted the orange zest, and it was perfect.  I had the entire dinner ready in less than 10 minutes.  Next time I will add a bit more of the red pepper flakes as we like ours a bit more spicy.  Highly recommend!

This dish has potential, and while my husband might have given it four stars, I am a little less generous.  To me, it was somewhat bitter, but that is probably because I am not too keen on orange marmalade or orange peel.  So, if you are not a fan of fruitcake, you might not care as much for this recipe.  However, I do not think that I am finished experimenting with this one.  I intend to read the reviews and figure out a way to add sweetness to the overall flavor.

This is a good recipe. My date did complain that it was a little spicy. I followed the other reviewer and marinated the beef in orange juice, soy sauce, olive oil, and 2 packets of sugar for 1 hr. Meat was very flavorful. I only used 1 tablespoon of orange zest which was more than enough.

I will definately make again.

Ironically - my husband said it needed more orage - very different from other reviews.  We did use about 2-3 tsp of fresh minced ginger instead of the dried ground.  Regardless, it was good and we will make again.  Thaks for sharing!

I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Way too much orange, the meat was tough and the sauce was too thick.  I would try making it again for myself with some changes but my family was totally turned off.

This dish had good flavor, but the beef was tough.  I used flank steak instead of round steak so that might have been my fault.  I think next time I will boil the beef first and cut down on the cornstarch as I thought the sauce was a bit thick.  I also doubled the red pepper and still couldn't taste the spiciness.

This was pretty tasty. I subbed a smaller amount of red wine vinegar for the sherry, so it ended up being a little tarter than I would have liked. I also followed reviewers recommendations and marinated the steak first in soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and a little lemon juice and vinegar. I added stirfried onion, bell pepper, and water chestnuts to the sauce as well. as well. Good base recipe.

Great dish!  I didn't use the orange strips at all and I marinated the beef in the soy, garlic, 1 T. orange juice, and pepper flakes for 1/2 hour.  My husband and kids loved it, so we have a keeper!

This recipes was good however, I thought the overall flavor was quite strong (not spicy). The hubby liked it, but he likes things with very strong spices and flavors. I left out the orange peel and made 1-1/2 times the sauce.  I would not recommend making extra sauce since you don't need much sauce to get the effect.  When I went to save the leftovers, I threw out the excess sauce.

I made this today. My 9 year old didn't like it and he is a meat eater. Overall it was good but nothing I would rush to make again. It bordered on the almost too- sweet side.  The cut of meat that I used was also rather tough.....thin sliced top round steak.

I wish I could give this a higher star value, but it just wasn't a big hit...good recipe, and I do give it 5 stars for ease of preperation, but my husband actually asked me not to make it again (I forgot he doesn't like citrus flavored recipes though).  The recipe is easy, and I followed it exactly, but unfortunatly not a "wow" recipe.  Sorry.

"Spicy" in the title is a little misleading.  There was no heat to this.  Next time I'll add some type of hot sauce and some vegetables.  The beef turned out great and the sauce had a good consistency, but there was so much sauce and not much to the dish.  Good base to add on to next time.

Great flavor! Love to add oriental veggies at the end and let simmer for a few minutes. Didn't like the orange peel so omitted but still perfect.

My hubby and I loved the sauce!  No leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I incorporated the suggestions of the other reviewers and omitted the zest and added broccoli and red pepper.  Had no sherry at hand but still tasted great.  Cook times in the recipe are spot-on.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definitely cook this again, maybe next time with chicken. =)

A nice change of pace from traditional chinese flavor. The orange added just enough to add to the meat without overpowering it.

This recipie is very tasty and easy to make.  It's the perfect meal to serve when you're short on time.  I used a tangerine peel instead of an orange peel and it worked just as well.

Made this one the other night.  Not too bad although I took the advice of one other "reviewer" and marinated the beef in orange juice for about an hour prior.  I think this made gave the beef too much of an orange flavour - I will make this one again but I won't marinate the beef again - probably better to just stick to the recipe as is.

This was a very quick and easy dish to make.  I did leave out the orange zest and red pepper flakes because I knew we would not like those.  I added snow peas along with the ginger and garlic.  We really enjoyed the taste.  I will make this recipe again and also think it would be good with chicken in place of the steak.

This is an interesting dish, it was too orangy for my taste.  Surprizingly the small amount of red pepper flakes really added a LOT of spice.
