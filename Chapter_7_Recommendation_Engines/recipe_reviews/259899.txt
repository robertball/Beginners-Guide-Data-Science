This turned out excellent! I did not make this sauce but made a similar one from this site. These were so good and they held up well the next day for leftovers too. Definitely give this one a try!

Well worth the prep time. Made exactly per recipe instructions. Marinated about 7 hours. Tastes divine! Leftovers were just as tasty.

We added some cinnamon to it and it turned out Fantastic!!!  True restaurant quality and HIGHLY recommended!  A bit labor intensive, but Well Worth the outcome!  Make Sure you use/dip the chick/veggies in the sauce as well- Amazing depth of flavors!!!

Just okay. The mint made it taste odd; otherwise it was edible but not something I would make again.

Amazing flavors!  It's hard to believe this is a healthy dish since it tastes so good.  My husband who is usually a bit non-committal about some of my experimental recipes said this one should definitely be kept in the rotation.  I made it exactly with the exception of marinading overnight because the timing didn't work as well to just do five hours.  It wasn't overpowering at all.  Fabulous with a simple side dish of Moroccan spiced carrots.

Made as it is written and it was delicious!!  We have smaller appetites and this recipe would feed four very hungry folk or six plus regular people.  Chicken was full of flavour.  We served the skewers with brown rice and a romain/strawberry salad.  Yummy!

It was great.  But it took longer to cook on the grill than the recipe recommended.  I will give it more time to cook next time.

Excellent exactly as written.  We had leftovers for breakfast,  the flavors intensified overnight and it was even better!  Made the yogurt sauce, but preferred the chicken without.   Inspiring me enough to write my first review!   Thank you for sharing, and an easy recipe to follow for those of us that are nervous to venture with seasonings beyond garlic & onion.

Simplified it, 1 h of marinating, skip coriander, cumin. Replace peppers and onions with eggplant and mushrooms.
