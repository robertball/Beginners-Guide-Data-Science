This was extremely good! I used an English cucumber. I didn't have grapes, so I used cranraisins. Instead of a tart apple I used a Macintosh. This was a very fresh and tasty salad. I loved the contrast of the tart sour cream and sweetness of the cranraisins and apples. I also loved the freshness of the cucumbers and the parsley. All these different flavors just dance on your tongue! This is a very impressive salad!

This is a lot like a Waldorf and a way to use up cucumbers.  Note: I used lowfat sour cream. I don't recommend that. This recipe needs the flavor of the real stuff. I added lemon juice to liven it up. Good stuff.

Very light and tasty! The recipe called for mixing the sour cream mixture into the salad but the picture had a dollop on top so we did that instead. It made a better presentation. I would make a little more "dressing" next time but still this was super good! I tried it again and added cubed teriaki marinated chicken for a great lunch salad. Super good!

Nice combination of flavors.  I used pecans instead of walnuts b/c that is what I had.  Needed to add some salt to really make it pop.

For three servings, I used 1/4 cup each of raisins and sultanas, 1/2 cup halved green grapes, walnuts to taste, and 4 tbsp sour cream with dried parsley to taste and 1 tsp brown sugar. I tossed the salad with lemon juice and refrigerated it in an airtight container, and tossed it with dressing just before serving.

I took a chance on this salad when I was looking for something different to serve for a women's gathering, preferably using a cucumber that was languishing in the fridge.  I loved it!  Admittedly, I made some changes, because when I opened my sour cream carton, I discovered I only had 1/4 cup left.  So ... I rounded it out with 1/4 cup fat free salad dressing and threw in 2 tablespoons of lemon yogurt just for the fun of it. I also used 3 Braeburn apples to 1 cucumber and had to substitute a generous handful of dried cranberries for the red grapes because the latter were so crazy expensive that week.  I did mix in the dressing as instructed, but unlike another reviewer who needed more, I felt that half of the recipe was plenty to give a nice-but-not-overpowering flavor.  Can't wait to try adding some chicken for an entree salad.

This is a very refreshing salad, and exactly what I had in mind, so this was the perfect recipe.  I did sub the sour cream for 0% greek yogurt, and I really doubt it lost and taste points with the sub.  Also added 2 tbsp lemon juice to give it a kick and to keep the apples from browning.  Really good!

Super!!  This is so refreshing & simple.  I didn't use green grapes-only red, & used honeycrisp apple.  This was even good on a cold November night in Nebraska :)  It's a keeper.  The hubby agrees.

This really was a great way to use up a cucumber and some grapes that no one seemed to be eating.  Also, I'd have to admit that had I not tried cucumber with watermelon & feta this past summer, I might not have tried this recipe.  I do agree with the previous reviewer, though, that a little bit of salt helped the flavor some... I thought about feta with it, which might work with chives, too, maybe; but finally decided to go with cinnamon (like previous reviewer) and raisins (like photo #2).  Seemed like something was still missing, but rated this a 4 because it can work the way it is - but also can be adapted to taste.

I used pecans instead of walnuts.  This was very good and extremely popular with my preschooler.  Went well with BBQ sausages.

I fought my usual instincts to "doctor up" the dressing and I'm so glad I didn't change a thing.  The dressing is simple, allowing the fruit flavors to shine through.  This was a big hit at the potluck, made exactly to  the recipe.  It will be my seasonal "go to" recipe.

Dish was a success at a recent luncheon.  Made with pecans and ganished with sharp cheddar shreds.  Salting to taste was important to accent the flavors.  Will be serving again.  Thanks

This is a very good salad. I did find that I had to add salt (to taste) to the dressing, as just sweet & sour are not enough flavor definitions for our tastebuds. I kind of hated the walnuts in this and would not do those again. I like walnuts, so I'm not sure what the issue is, maybe a texture thing. Thank you for sharing, and I'm sure I'll make this again. (I used Daisy Light sour cream with no ill effects in this recipe.)

Yum, I altered this a little and wow, tastes so good.  Good way to get a little bit of veggies in too.  I used plain low fat yogurt instead of sour cream, added a couple tsp of brown sugar, a little spenda, cinnamon and also a tiny bit of grape nuts cereal to add some more crunch.  Also I suggest peealing the cucumber to take away the vegetable taste.  MMmmm love it.  I will definetly make it again.

Loved this! I added raisins and some cut up dried figs which made it more sweet so I didn't need to add the sugar. I also added some vanilla almond milk along with the sour cream to give it a little more flavor and sweetness as well. Was wonderful!

One of the most refreshing salads ever.  It says 6 servings but my husband and I devoured it all.  I substituted pecans for walnuts, just a personal preference and it tasted wonderful.  Awesome recipe that is sure to be a staple with our family.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so fast and easy - although I hate halving grapes. My kids don't like many vegetables, so hiding a cucumber in this was pretty ingenious. They are eating it now, and have no idea there's a vegetable in it! I used almonds instead of walnuts, and had to leave out the parsley, I forgot it when I went to the store. But the "dressing" is just great!

This was a very nice salad and I received many compliments when I served it at a forth of July party at my house. Although it was food, I didn't get that wow factor, this was just a nice, mellow salad. It holds up well as leftovers and the parsley flavor is more prevalent the next day, which I liked.  I used Greek yogurt which I added a very small amount of Stevia. I put lime juice over the apples before encorporating into sauce. I will most likely make this salad again.
