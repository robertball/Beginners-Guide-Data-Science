This was okay, but not that great.  Not sure if I would use recipe again without some changes.

Almost perfect. I added half tsp each of lemon juice and white wine vinegar; just my taste

Loved this recipe! I used chopped green onions instead of red onion. Tastes great served on sliced cucumbers or alone.

We loved this.  I am a classic tomato-garlic-basil bruschetta girl, but this was a wonderful switch up to the usual.  Everyone loved it!
