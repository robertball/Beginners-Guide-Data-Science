Recipe was easy and they turned out great and tasty even though I had to skip the chicken bouillon, rosemary and thyme basically because I´m a vegetarian so the buillon was out of the question and the other two I didn´t had at the time in my pantry. 
TIME SAVER TIP: if you don't have time to wait for the potatoes to be ready in the oven, you can cheat by pre cooking the potato wedges for about 10 min on high in the microwave on a refractaric pan covered with plastic wrap donpt forget to make holes to let the steam out(cooking time to soften varies on every microwave so play by ear do not let them get too soft) then toss them 20-30 min in the oven for that firm outside oven cooked effect. They came out awesome and was just 35ish min total cook time ;)

I liked the flavor of these, but I only made 2 servings to use 2 large russet potatoes up. I used low sodium veg broth paste and accidentally forgot the dill. I had to bake them at 400, baking something else at that temp. They sort of fell apart when done, going from undone to over done. As I liked the flavor I may try them with the dill I forgot and the proper temp.

I must admit, I was skeptical at many points when making these potatoes.  However, they were excellent!  I was most wary of all of the water and really wanted to eliminate the water for more of a roasted effect, but I followed the recipe (other than 1/2ing it).  I used dried til (2 tsp), slightly less thyme and rosemary (just not a huge fan), and about 1/2 tsp of white pepper and 1 tsp of salt.  Great flavor and great texture.  They took about an hour, though I did cut into about 1/2" wedges.  THANKS for the recipe!

Used chicken broth instead of water+bouillon, no rosemary/thyme; good though the lemon was a bit surprising for my taste. I think I'll cut way down on the lemon next time-- this seems a great way to do potatoes in the oven.

These potatoes were pretty good.  They took about 1 hour to bake.  I think they turned out a little mushy.  If I make them again I would take the foil off to let them brown a little bit.

These potatoes taste exactly like the ones at the authentic Greek restaurant we love. My only suggestion is if you want that lemony flavor to come thru, marinate the wedges a few hours before you bake them. It's worth it in the end. Use foil to seal in steam so they don't burn. Excellent side dish for a Greek meal!!

They were good a bit too lemony for me. Next time I make this I will at least cut the lemon juice in half and a little less water.

These were good but there was still a lot of liquid left so the potatoes were wet. Will use half the amount of water next time.  I substituted dried dill for fresh. I added zest of a lemon to try to get a more lemon flavour.

Love it!  Easy to prep.  It takes a while to cook, but is totally worth it.  I've made this recipe at least six times now, and it's a household favorite.  I wish I knew what the red sauce in the picture was though, it looks yummy.

Very homy comforting taste with ample flavour.  I only baked for about 45 min and they were a bit mushy but everyone enjoyed them still. There was very little liquid left at this point but I liked the potato mush coating each wedge.

These were a big hit.  I didn't have any rosemary, so I left it out.

Oh god, so good! I left out the thyme and rosemary (I don't use thyme and I hate rosemary) but added a little smoked paprika and lots of fresh minced garlic. I will definitely make these potatoes again!

love this recipe but I cooked it at 400 and it probably took 2 to 2.5 hrs to get crisp.  I used chicken stock rather than water.

I made these the other night and it will be a keeper. The only thing  I added was some crumbled Goat cheese on top  while roasting. So easy   and so very yummy!

Not a big fan of dill, so I used 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley.
Baked for 90 minutes, then I transfered to a frying pan to sauté them.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!  Very tasty and moist and not at all soggy (as I feared it might be ). The family loved it. I think that if you were to throw in some chicken with the potatoes, you'd have end up with some pretty amazing Chicken Vesuvio. I haven't tried that, but definitely will in the near future.
