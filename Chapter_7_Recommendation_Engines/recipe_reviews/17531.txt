My family doesn't eat fish that often and I was looking for a fast and easy grilling recipe. After reading reviews of not having much flavor I tweaked it to my families taste and we all enjoyed it even the kids. What I did add was lemon pepper and 3 cloves of garlic and 2 lemons.
Would make this again and experiment more with it.

Loved it.  I used this recipe on tilapia fillets and served it to my in-laws and they couldn't get enough.  Thanks Morgan ( I am making it again tonight)

I made this last nighit and it was great!   I used salmon steaks with  fresh thyme and parsley from our garden and served it with brown rice and asparagus spears.  Desertquilter had a nice idea about adding capers - I'll try that next time.  This would be an elegant and easy meal for company!  Thanks Morgan!

We thought this was just OK.  I will use as a base and add soy sauce, brandy, and brown sugar.

Easy to make, with a great flavor! I used it on perch (didn't have salmon)filets and thought it turned out just fine.

This was terrific!  I would highly recommend marinating for at least an hour -- more is even better.  In addition, thyme is a very strong spice, so I reduced it by about half.  Instead of grilling, I baked my fish at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  Be sure and sprinkle with salt and pepper after grilling/baking.  This was wonderful served with a rice pilaf and vegetable.  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't like this at all.  The spices didn't seem to meld with the fish.  My husband loved it if that's any consolation....but then again....I could burn food and he would say he liked it.
I won't make this one again, sorry.

I ended up omitting the olive oil and just creating a quick marinade of about 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1tbsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, a touch of black pepper, 1tsp dried parsley and dipped the fish in this - then arranged in a baking dish coated with cooking spray and sprinkled a little dried dill on top. Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Thanks for the base recipe!

Made this with tilapia, YUM!
Even my pickiest child liked this and didn't feel the need to scrape off the herbs.  Everyone had seconds(good thing I doubled the recipe).

This is very good.  We used it on some pompano my neighbor caught, and we really liked it.  I think it could use a little more flavor, though, so next time we'll add salt and the grilled onions suggested.

Wonderful, easy, delightful -- I slightly altered it only because I had barely one tablespoon of thyme left, but my family loved it.  Three of us had it on salmon -- and the fourth on haddock (marinated in a separate dish).  It made enough to coat two pounds of fish.  My daughter wanted to go out and buy more salmon while it was still on sale so we could make it again -- like tomorrow isn't soon enough.

This was voted as a "keeper" by my family who loves fish.  Even I liked it, and I am, quite literally, unable to eat anything that tastes remotely fishy.  This recipe provides great flavour with no apparent fishy aftertaste.

One of the best salmon recipes I have made yet!  Still tasted like something was missing, but I dont think that was the recipe.  I will keep trying, eventually I will figure out how to cook fish!

What this does to fish is amazing!  I used haddock instead of salmon and it was delicious!  The only think I would tweak is the amount of spices.  It was a touch to thick on the fish for me but not my husband.  He loved it as is!

I didn't love this. I felt the herbs were overpowering for salmon. I measured and used the amount called for in the recipe but it was just too much. I will not make this again.

This gave my fish the best taste since I started using my grill. It also gave my meats a good taste=:)

The best part about this recipe is that my kids couldn't get enough of it!  They absolutely devoured the salmon and they are both picky eaters.
