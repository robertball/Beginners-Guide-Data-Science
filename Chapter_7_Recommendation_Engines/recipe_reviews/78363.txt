I loved this recipe.  It is so simple to make.  The only modifications I made were to blanch the broccoli first for the beautiful green color that it brings out, and I also used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine.  It gave it a slightly sweeter taste and very mild acidity.

I LOVED this recipe -- even better than chocolate cake, and I love chocolate cake!
I put all the ingredients, sans the broccoli in a food processor until it was like a vinaigrette. 

Like other reviewers, I used Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine (since it has a bit of sweetness), and I also added 1 tsp. of Honey since I like things sweet. I increased the garlic by 2 cloves. Then, as per other readers, I lightly steamed the broccoli -- for 4 minutes -- and poured the mixture over the broccoli. I added some cubed, (boiled) tofu and put that in the fridge to marinate for 3 hours. I served it over brown rice. This dish is fan-freakin-tastic!

I loved this recipe.  I was looking for new recipes with fresh broccoli and this is one I will definitely make again.  Easy to prepare and excellent flavor.  Just make sure you like food with a strong garlic flavor. I forgot to put on the parmesan chhese and still thought it was great! My kids thought the flavor was too strong.  Thanks!!

I made this recipe using half the garlic.  I thought it was really good.  My husband, who is a picky eater, like it too.

I was looking for a healthy salad that I could make ahead for a party I am giving.  I made this with balsamic vinegar and blanched broccoli. I snuck a taste after three hours, and liked it.  Once I added the cheese to my testing portion, I was not impressed.  The next day when I re-tasted, the broccoli was a very strange color and I did not like the salad at all.  Adding the cheese just made matters worse.  I would only make this again if I was going to eat it within a few hours.

I'm not a huge fan of raw broccoli so I used steamed and cut the amount of oil in half.  I think just about any vinegar will do here but I stuck to the recipe.  It was a nice change of pace with or without the parmesan cheese.

Yum, this was great. I would definitely make again.I used my broccoli raw as stated. I did reduce the salt to just under 1tsp. I also used 1 huge clove of garlic(prob. equal to 3cloves) used cider vinegar because thats what I had. I didnt do the paste thing with the garlic I just put all marinade ingreds in the blender until smooth, then poured over the broc in a ziploc bag. Turned bag every so often. Topped with fresh grated parm. I used grey poupon mustard.

I am usually pretty generous when it comes to rating recipes, but I'm not sure why everyone liked this so much.  I love broccoli, and the combination of the vinegar, salt and so much raw garlic is extremely salty and not good.  I won't be making a recipe like this again.

We've been trying to get more raw broccoli in our diet and this recipe has done it for us!  FABULOUS, especially if you are a garlic lover.  We switched the oil and vinegar amounts (1/4 cup oil, 1/3 cup vinegar) and forgot to add the parmesan at the end, but we are going to have this side on a regular basis.  So healthy.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

I blanched the broccoli to bring out the bright green color and then shocked it in an ice bath. I really thought this was going to be a delicious side dish but it turned out to be quite underwhelming. So sorry....

OMG this was so good. I have made this 3xs this month.  I quickly steam the broccoli and then run it under cold water.  My husband hates veggies, but he eats this!  I dont use cheese and only use a a tiny bit of oil to save on calories and it is still awesome. Thanks!

This was delicious!  I changed a couple of things but I am sure it would be great as is.  I added double garlic because I'm sick and wanted the extra medicinal properties.  I also added some pasta and diced sun-dried tomatoes just because.  Very potent but super yummy!

i just made this about an hour ago and omg, it is fantastic.  i tasted it as soon as i made it, again just now and can't even imagine how good it will be while watching the academy awards tonight.  i actually used the 1 1/2 t. of salt and wished i had read the reviews first, i usually do and i thought the amount was excessive.  i used four huge garlic cloves and an amount of broccoli close to two heads.  next time i will reduce the salt, and i will add more red wine vinegar.  i think this is a great way to use up broccoli and make a healthy simple snack.  thanks for the recipe.

My husband nor I could even eat this....I followed recipe exactly. Too much vinegar. I used fresh grated parmesan cheese and a good red wine vinegar. Very disappointed wasted good broccoli. Unlike the other reviews too much salt and or garlic was not the problem but nevertheless no a keeper for me

This is a 5 star if you like garlic.  I also blanched mine for color in the microwave for 2 min. with a little water.

This was such a hit with my family. I didn't have red wine vinegar or three hours (the family was hungry). So I substituted white balsamic vinegar for the red wine; steamed the broccoli and garnished with chopped green onion. The warmth of the broccoli helped the dressing marinate quickly. I was able to serve it in 30 min.

Easy recipe and very tasty. I used balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar and, while yummy, turned the broccoli dark brown. Still good to eat but an unappetizing color. Just a heads up if you substitute.

Very tasty, everyone in the family liked it. I used less salt too, more like a big pinch. I also omitted the parmesan. Thanks for the healthy recipe!

Holy moly was this fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and boy was it delicious!  I made this as a side for a birthday dinner and it was wiped clean!  I will probably use a little less salt next time, but I did triple the recipe so I ended up using a lot of salt.  Don't be afraid of the garlic.  My friend said it was like crack.  It was intense but she couldn't stop eating it.  It didn't have time to marinade for the full 3 hours, but that was half because I was short on time and half because I couldn't get people to stop eating it out of the fridge.  Delicious!

We had this last night and everyone just raved about it.  I did steam the broccoli first.  As suggested, I used 1/2 t. salt and 1/4 c. of oil (canola, our preference, but will try olive next time).  Was pressed for time so used 1 T. garlic powder.  WOW, was this ever good!  Husband, daughter, son-in-law and I ate only that until it was gone!  I didn't even have Parmesan so I can only imagine how fantastic next time with it.

Made as written and loved the flavor! Definitely cut back on the salt to 1 teaspoon, it was way too salty for me and I love salt! Great recipe otherwise. Thank you for the recipe!

Thus was very, very garlicky, and vinegary. I don't have a problem with strong flavors and I could handle it, but it's really way too much garlic for one head of broccoli. I feel like I wasted some garlic. Also, even though I normally like these types of flavors I felt like something was missing. I did completely forget the Parmesan cheese, but I don't think that was it. It felt like all I could taste was garlic, and there weren't enough flavors playing around for me. However, this might be good if added to another dish....

Too strong of a vinegar taste and very one dimensional.  I might keep playing with it because I like the idea.  It needs more variety and balance,perhaps less garlic, some sugar and another vegetable. I can see some seeds or nuts for texture as well.

Two stars because I could at least power through my serving. I wasn't impressed at all. Everything was overpowered by the taste of vinegar, even after I added extra-everything-else... I feel like I just wasted good broccoli. Interesting concept, but I won't be making it again.

This is okay, but I thought the vinegar taste was overpowering. I tried it with the vinegar indicated in the recipe and with other kinds as suggested by reviewers. I also tried cutting the amount of vinegar way down. However, I only really like this recipe if I omit the vinegar altogether.

I made this a while back and forgot to review it.  I wanted to put in my two cents since many people gave it less than stellar reviews.  This was awesome and I am making it again today.  I used the mortar and pestle and I think that will make a big difference because it really crushes all that flavor out of the garlic.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe instructed.  I really love strong flavors so if you do not then beware - if you do however, I recommend this.  This is a wonderful, easy way to get your greens and I just love that it is served raw because that is more nutritious.  I did not cook it beforehand like some others did.  I think it cooks a little in the marinade but one of it's most appealing characteristics is it's crunch.  It lends a nice balancing texture to any meals where a soft texture may be more dominant.

Sounds very basic, but wow - really great way to get your greens! I blanched the broccoli according to the reviews, as well as swapped the red wine vinegar with balsamic. Didn't have Dijon so I used honey mustard. Two bunches of broccoli. Created the garlic into a paste by pressing and then smashing with the back of a spoon. Reheated leftovers and while they were good, the flavor was best after a few hours of marinating; overnight doesn't do the dish any favors. Definite repeat!

This side dish was my contribution to a Father's Day lunch.  It was a huge hit. I did do a little tweaking though. I'm not a big fan of raw broccoli, so I steamed the florets from 1 1/2 bunches of broccoli for 3-4 minutes, then drained and rinsed them well with cold water.  For the dressing: I blended 2 rounded tsps of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 2 Tbsps Dijon nustard, and 2 tsps honey (helps cut the tartness a bit).  I poured this over the cooled broccoli and chilled for about 3 hours. I'm not a fan of Parmesan cheese, so I left it out. Next time, I'll try adding a few thinly sliced green onions to the broccoli before adding the dressing.  This is a great recipe that I will definitely make again!

We love this recipe.  To spice it up, we use Colman's mustard.  And for variety we've added blanched asparagus but we've never blanched the broccoli.

i really enjoyed this.. i used 7 oz broccoli florets and scaled it down to 2 servings.. i subbed white wine vinegar for the red and doubled the amount.. used 1 tsp of stone ground mustard and left out the cheese.. it sat in the fridge for about 9 hours.. there's the other serving left over since bf didn't feel like having any so i'm taking that with me for lunch today.. i'll chime in if it's "even better the next day".. ty for the recipe.. UPDATE: this actually WAS better the next day!  it gave the broccoli time to soak in more of the flavors and liquid, allowing it to be more tender.. 5* recipe if left to marinate a full 24 hours

Very good. others have blanched the broccoli and I thought about doing that, but didn't cause I didn't have much time and didn't want the extra work. if u cut your broccoli small and let it marinade for an hour or two branching is unecessary cause the vinegar soften and sort of "cooks" it. later I tried blanched and didn't think it was as good texture wise. I look forward to trying different vinegars and adding some sweetness for variations on this recipe.

Yes!  Finally a great way to serve broccoli!  I always steam the broccoli until just tender before placing it in the marinade.  This keeps the broccoli crisp but soft enough to eat without working real hard at it.

My husband said this is his new favourite way to eat broccoli... and that is saying a lot!!! I used 2 cloves of garlic and kept everything else the same. We wanted to eat this right away.. so i mixed it up.. microwaved for 1 1/2 minutes and then put in the fridge.. it was much faster than blanching, and the flavours were wonderful.. done everything in 30 mins.

I followed this recipe almost exactly! I did blanch the broccoli before hand. I kept the red wine vinegar because I wanted a salty side for a sweet ham we were eating. It slightly over powered the rest of the ingredients. I think I might just use 1/8 cup red wine vinegar next time, but i will make it again!

The amount of salt called for in this recipe made it waaaaaay too salty--almost inedible. I would recommend only putting in half a teaspoon of salt.

as stated, the recipes ratio of dressing to broccoli is way off.  The dressing/marinade tastes good, but need to be mixed with a lot more broccoli than 1 bunch.

This is such a great recipe! I had read that some people found it too garlicky. So I used 4 cloves, but I used 4 small cloves (next time I won't be afraid of the garlic, it was not overpowering at all). I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon. I also used a mixture of balsamic and red wine vinegar. Also added a few shakes dried taragon leaves. I only had a small head of broccoli so I also used fresh green beans and grape tomatoes. I steamed the broccoli and green beans, then ran them under cold water. Tossed them with some grape tomatoes and the dressing, and marinated for 3 hours, turning every half hour. Didn't use the grated Parm. The leftovers were even better the next day. So healthy and SO, so good. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

REALLY yummy! I did change this up a bit since I'm not a fan of crunchy broccoli. I substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar, and blended all the marinade ingredients up in a blender. Then I poured this over the brocolli in a pan and let it steam all together. The end result was a tangy and flavorful broccoli side dish instead of a "salad". This seemed to allow the flavors to meld together better, and tone down the overpowering garlic and vinegar. Sprinkle with parmesan at the end and enjoy!

I used quite a bit of garlic, more than called for and I didn't think it was too overpowering.  This was OK for me. After a couple bites, I just didn't want anymore.  In my opinion, might be something I would make & toss in a salad... but eaten on it's own was not a real treat for me.

DELICIOUS! Had to use balsamic vinegar because thats all I had, but it came out so yummy! The garlic flavor was pretty strong, but i love garlic so i didn't mind so much. If you're not a garlic lover, I'd reduce the amount of garlic to your taste. Next time, I would cut back on the olive oil to 1/4 cup, after letting it sit in the fridge for a couple hours, the oil congealed a little and left a funny texture.

This was really good.......but I steamed the broccoli just because I didn't think my teenage boys would it it raw!
I added the garlic and salt to pot & then mixed up the oil, vinegar and mustard. Next time a little less vinegar for us.

This is FABULOUS! I used less salt and balsamic instead of red wine vinegar.  
I didn't find the garlic flavor too strong, but I love garlicy stuff. I think I'll be keeping this in my fridge all the time as a healthy snack.

We love garlic, but there's no way I was going to use 4 cloves with one head of broccoli. The amount of salt stated is also completely excessive. This was ok but not great. Thanks anywy.

Delicious twenty-times over! It is easy to make, and tastes better the longer you marinate. This dish has become a staple in my fridge (I have some marinating right now)... Mmmm!

Yeeoow - we are garlic lovers but the garlic took the front seat on this recipe and overpowered the dish.  I reduced salt as another reviewer suggested but was still too salty for our taste.  If I were to make this again, I would seriously reduce measurements on salt and garlic.  Don't have to worry about vampire attacks with this recipe!

The Garlic Broccoli was extremely tasty.  I was amazed how the few simple ingredients completely transformed the dish.  However, there was way too much salt for my taste.  I would reduce it to about a 1/2 teaspoon instead.  Overall, a great take on simple vegetable.

This was good, but pretty intense.  4 cloves fresh garlic + 1 head raw broccoli = breath that can peel wallpaper.  Hubby is still making jokes.  The Parmesan adds a great touch.

We love this recipe. I make it at least once a week, because it's my husband's favorite side dish. 

I do the measurements on olive oil and vinegar backwards. 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup vinegar. The other way was a little too oily. I also add pine nuts (before or after chilling), and my husband gets cranky if I forget the pine nuts. For the Dijon mustard, I use stone-ground mustard. And I almost always an entire pod of garlic. We're of the opinion that you can never have too much garlic, especially if you both have it.  I salt everything to taste, so I'm sure I use more like 1/2 tsp. like other commenters mentioned. But I don't even measure salt, I just salt to taste. 

Oh, also I usually forget to make this ahead of time and end up only marinating it for 1 hour, which is probably why I can get away with using extra vinegar. It doesn't have to marinate for 3 hours. It's fantastic anyway.

Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

We LOVED this recipe! My hubby usually complains at the sight of raw broccoli and he devoured this and said I should make MORE next time! I followed the recipe almost exactly..only substituting parmiggiano reggiano for the regular parmesan cheese. YUM!

Excellent way to enjoy fresh vegetables.  I cut down on the salt and it was fantastic.  Will try it using twice as much broccoli and see how that turns out . . . .

My new favorite way to eat broccoli!  This was amazing!  I did mine without Parmesan just because I forgot about it, but still very good!  Definitely worth trying- make a big batch to be able to snack on the next day.

This was a great recipe. I think it was a bit salty for my taste though. I also blanched the broccoli which makes it soak up the dressing better. I will definitely make this dish often and experiment with different vinegars.

This recipe definitely had zing to it. Next time I might try cutting back to 4 small cloves of garlic. I used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon mustard which might of given it an extra kick. Next time I will also add more broccoli since the broccoli in it wasn't dry and bland at all. 3 out of 4 people in my family liked it. I also didn't add Parmesan cheese or marinate it for 3 hours. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Holy Garlic, Batman!  This should be called Super Garlic-y Broccoli.  I love garlic, one of my fave restaurants is The Stinking Rose, but this is almost too much for me.  My bf could barely eat the few pieces I gave him.  I'll probably try again, but cut the dressing in half.

This was exceptional!  I served this for Christmas eve dinner and everyone loved it.  Instead of raw broccoli, I cooked it in butter and kosher salt until tender and then stirred in the sauce.  The cheese melted and it was creamy.

I cut this in half and took CookinBug's  suggestions and served it pretty much right after tossing with the dressing. I loved it, my family did not. I'll make this again but only for myself or someone who will appreciate it. NOTE: I used fresh grated parmesan cheese. Don't use the canned variety. Trust me.

This is pretty good... if you don't let it sit for more than an hour or so. After a couple of hours in the fridge, the flavor is a little overwhelming. I'd make this again, but would prepare shortly before serving. Thanks :)

This was good, and I truly wanted to eat it, but the garlic was just too strong for me.  I was actually nervous because of the smell, but the flavor of the vinegar, garlic, and dijon is actually pretty tasty.  I plan on making it again, but with much less garlic.

Very tangy marinade, a good balance to the broccoli. I used regular yellow mustard instead of dijon, and only marinated 1 1/2 hours. Very flavorful and tangy. I would make again, probably adding some other vegetables to the mix (cucumbers, peppers, or peas would be nice).

I loved this recipe. I did steam my broccoli slightly and only used 1 tblspn of evoo instead of 1/3c. I left out the salt and put my garlic through a garlic press instead of making the paste. I loved the dijon mustard taste. Great way to eat broccoli. Will make again! Served with Italian Sausage Peppers and Onions from this site.

Changed the recipe a little: blanched the broccoli, and added some home grown baby arugula (rocket) leaves to make a pesto type dressing.  subbed apple cider vinegar, and 86ed the cheese.  If I were to use cheese, it would be a Parm or Romano, but I was trying to keep this lighter.  Made dried bread croutons to toss with, and had to hide the dressing from myself so I would quit dipping them and eating them.  Spicy and garlicky this way; not for the faint of heart (but oh so delicious!)

I rated this 5 stars even though I made a small adjustment but, that was only because I do not like dijon mustard. I substituted creole mustard and it was fantastic. Whole family says this is a keeper. Will definitely be making this again for a barbeque side dish this summer and whenever I need to have a salad for a potluck.

I am VERY impressed by this recipe. I used a blend of Parmesian and Ramano cheese for the topping, but with or without the cheese, it is still great. Like another reviewer said, this would be great just to keep in the fridge for munchies. The next time I make this (which may be tomorrow!), I am going to cut back just a wee bit on the red wine vinegar as for my personal taste. Thank you for this easy dish!

Fantastic recipe!!  I did what others recommended and steamed the broccoli, didn't all as much salt but also added some balsamic vinegar.  Please note that you don't need to add anywhere near the amount of oil and vinegar as suggested, it ends up an oily mess.  I used a few tablespoons of each for 2 heads of broccoli and it was more than enough.

Rather than use a mortar and pestal, I blended all the ingredients in a mini food processor. It was very easy. I did not have any dijon mustard, so I used red pepper flakes for the kick. I too slightly steamed the broccoli. It was really great, and something I will make again.

I made this for a bbq this weekend and I must say, it was excellent!  I took suggestions from other reviewers and slightly steamed the broccoli first. Made it the morning of and let it marinate all day.  There was only a tiny, tiny bit left over, however, it did not taste as good the second day.

You need to be a garlic lover to enjoy this recipe. I liked being able to use fresh broccoli, but next time I will cut back on the amount of salt and the amount of garlic.

Awesome recipe. I absolutely hate broccoli, but I couldn't stop eating these ones. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because it's a bit too tangy. You get used to it after a while though.

Healthy,unique,and easy. Thank you for such a smart idea.  Mashing the garlic was a great idea, and will use it for dressings in the future. This would be great for cookouts because of the no mayo and is super good for you too! Thanks!

Used balsamic vinegar as with most ppl. I blanched first and it ended up kinda soggy. I did heat up with my meal the next day and that was very good. Either warm or cold it’s good.

This wasn't bad - it came out too vinegar-y for our tastes.

I'd cut the red wine vinegar in half.  I'd also blanch the broccoli by soaking in boiled water for a minute.  Then add everything and let set for a while in the fridge.

I'm also noticing that quite a few folks used balsamic vinegar.  Will try that next time

I liked this very much I stuck to the original recipe.  Only I added a teaspoon of lemon juice a half teaspoon sugar and some crushed red pepper... Along with balsamic others suggested! I love it. :) I usually roast my veggies but wanted a change.

Awesome recipe.  I did blanche my broccoli and use balsamic vinegar like a few folks suggested.  Also, I added an additional clove of garlic and simply finely diced the garlic rather than making a paste.  This worked just fine.  Warning- No one will want to kiss you after eating this LOL.

OMG, I could eat this every day but I absolutely love raw garlic and vinegar dressings.   I made 1 1/2 times the amount of dressing with 4 cloves of garlic.  I also used flaked sea salt rather than granular so I think that may have cut down on the saltiness that some people experienced.   Now I just need to get my husband to eat some when he gets home so he won't notice how much I smell like garlic.  Yum!

P.S. I don't usually add the Parmesan cheese.  I don't think it really needs it.

Whatever you do...don't add this much salt!  I'm a salt lover and even I reduced it to 1 tsp, and it was so salty that I was embarrassed to serve it!  I still gave it 5 stars because the flavour otherwise was delicious! Reminiscent of Caesar dressing. I also blanched the broccoli as suggested by other users. I then heated it up in the microwave to serve as a hot dish and it was fab! Btw: I also blanched some chopped green kale to get even more vitamins.

Personally, I'd cut the vinegar in half and substitute chicken or vegetable broth.

I steamed my broccoli.  The recipe is missing the method on how to cook the broccoli for the best result.  I may try this again without the vinegar.

Dressing a little tangy, but still worth a try for cold broccoli salad sometime. Added shredded carrots.  I blanched the broccoli first, so the color turned to a sickly green while in the fridge.  To keep the color, probably keep fresh and raw.

This turned out way better than I thought! Definitely more than the sum of it's parts.   I used apple vinegar since I had it with no problem.

Great idea for broccoli!  I've only made this once; next time I may blanch the broccoli. My changes: 1) I didn't use  salt or make a garlic paste because I wanted to try my new garlic grater from the Delray Beach FL Garlic Festival. (Works fine! :-)  2) I only had whole-grain dijon, so that's what I used, 3) I cut down on the oil a bit thanks to other reviewers, and 4) just before serving I tossed in some grape tomatoes.   5) I put the cheese on the table as a choice.   I'll definitely make again, and will enjoy tweaking the recipe.

I decided to make a summer meal in December because of the unseasonable warm temperatures. This sounded really good, and I just couldn't wait to try it. 

I just made this about 15 minutes ago and couldn't wait to taste it, so I gave it a little sample. It was delicious. I can't wait to have more and to make it again. They only thing is that I think the head of broccoli that I got from my local grocery was a little small for the amount of marinade, so next time I will double the broccoli or halve the marinade. I also blanched the broccoli to make it a little more tender. 

Definitely a keeper for me.

I was a little wary about this recipe however it turned out great.  I steamed the broccoli and then shocked it in ice water to bring out the pretty green color.  

I also used honey dijon mustard, and it gave the broccoli a nice sweet hint.

It really was fabulous and so easy.  I will definately use it again.

I love garlic, but one bite was all I could handle of this recipe.  Way too much garlic.  I don't even know of any suggestions that would help this recipe.  I am planning on making a pasta with the leftover broccoli, hoping that some of the garlic fury may be tamed.

Very good if you like salty and tart.  I will reduce the salt next time as it was too salty for my taste. I also blended the dressing in a blender and it was quick and easy. Prepared mid-morning and served for dinner. I am in the process of collecting different side dishes as I'm tired of the same stand-bys. This will go into my "keeper" file.

WAY, WAY too much salt...be careful!  And I usually love garlic, but, thought it had too much garlic too. However, super easy & still liked the oil base (instead of mayo). Will make again, but, with less salt and garlic.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. I used balsamic vinagrette, and swaped the vinegar and oil measurments -- I just didn't like the taste. I think there was just TOO MUCH sauce. I like the taste of broccoli and when I used the sauce I couldn't taste anything but balsamic garlic onion. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll cut all the amounts in half.

Easy recipe.  I blanched the broccoli to bring out the green color and used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have the red wine vinegar on hand.  It was good but not something that I would make often.

I thought the garlic was somewhat over powering.  I will cut the garlic used down until I find the amount I like.  Overall its easy to make and different from the usual salad.

A little salty but with lots of garlic  - I love it!  I used both balsamic and red wine vinegars and regular mustard (too bad I didn't have any dijon) I also lightly steamed the broccoli as suggested by other reviewers.  I added more broccoli half way through as I could tell this was going to be yummy after I tasted the marinade! My whole family loved this!

This was good but not memorable.  Like others, I steamed the broccoli and reduced the amount of olive oil to 1/4 cup.  It still tasted too much like olive oil.

You really need to like brocolli raw to like this recipe.  I give it a 3 star as I'm really not a fan on broccoli yet did like the garlic taste.
