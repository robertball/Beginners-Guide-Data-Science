The marinade is delicious, but stew beef needs long slow cooking to make it tender. I used a thick ribeye steak, which I cut into 1 1/2" cubes at home before marinating.

I use a product that I get in a local grocery store called "Cavender's Greek Seasoning."  Reading the label, it contains salt, pepper, corn starch, garlic, oregano, onion, parsley, and "other spices".  It kind of tastes like Mrs Dash, but with a little more pepper.  You could probably use that if you want.

This looks yummy and we definitely want to try it out.  Wondering though, what comprises "Greek Spice" ...   We're going for a 4-star rating just on spec.

Everyone loved this recipe (4 year old too).  Sweet, tangy and smoky.  I only marinated it for 3 hours and everyone raved. So you don't even need to marinate over night.  Easy to make.  I used Chuck Shoulder which is not the best cut of meat and it was gobbled.

We were a bit disappointed with this. It was fine, but it didn't have much flavor and we didn't think the sweetness came through. Used petite tender chuck steaks instead of stew meat. It was fun to give it a try. Thanks for sharing!

This was a good recipe as is. I felt it was better with a couple of changes. 1) It is tough, and either needs a more tender cut of meat, or a few hours in the slow cooker. 2) I wanted to accentuate the sweetness a little, so instead of dark corn syrup I used half light corn syrup and half molasses. It was just right for my family.

Very lovely.  Easy and delicious!  We cooked on the grill with indirect heat with great results.  A winner!

This recipe is so freaking awesome! Simple and great tasting.  I might even try this with chicken sometime.
