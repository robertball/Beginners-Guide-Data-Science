Wonderful!  Possibly the best banana bread I've ever had.  Like others, I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract, split the sugar in to 1/2 c. of white and brown sugar, and I used 1 c. of all purpose flour with 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  I also cut the butter in half and substituted with applesauce.  Sometimes making these healthier cuts into your baking also means you have to cut out on the taste, but this proportion worked perfectly!  A little bit healthier and it was gone before it was finished cooling on the cooling rack!  I guess I better make some more...

I made this bread today, for the second time. Because I love anything banana flavored, I decided to put in 5 mashed bananas this time and added 1t vanilla, and 1t cinnamon.Because of the dry to wet ratio I added another 1/2c flour and 1t baking powder. A flavorful, moist banana bread was the result! With my modifications, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks, Nikki! :) By the way, for two 7X3 loaves, it took only 45 minutes in my oven. I believe 1 hour would dry the bread out.

This banana bread is so good! The edges are crispy and the inside is nice and moist. I covered it with foil halfway through because it was getting pretty brown and added 1/2 tsp baking powder, vanilla and cinnamon. Definitely my new banana bread recipe!

I made this recipe, but added a little cinnamon and a dash of vanilla. Put them in vegetable sprayed muffin pans and they took half the time. This recipe is so quick and easy! I double the recipe to make 24 muffins. A definite family favorite! Thank you Nikki! :o)

Excellent recipe! Everyone commented on how moist it was. After my brother in law said "its soo moist" he turned to his wife and said "this is how banana bread is supposed to be". Also, my 10 year nephew wants me to make him his OWN banana bread.   Like a lot of people, I also added an extra banana (total of 4), 1/2 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1 t. vanilla. I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes in a 9x5 loaf pan (I didn't have the size suggested in the recipe). After 40 mins,  I placed a foil tent over the pan and lowered the heat to 250 degrees for approximately 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper!

Good recipe!  The first time I made it I thought it could use more bananas although the bananas I got from the grocery store were rather small, therefore, the second time I made it I used four bananas instead of three.  The first time I made this recipe it was good but the second time it was great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Here is a simple recipe that tastes great. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, used margarine instead of butter and made half a dozen muffins and one small round cake pan instead of the two loaves. Thanks for the recipe :-)

Made these tonight, I love banana bread and thought this one was wonderful. I took the hints and added vanilla and cinnamon and also added chocolate chips.  I made muffins out of the batter.  It was so simple.  Even my husband loved them.  I did not think he even liked bananas.

This had a very strong taste to it and had a chewy crust.  It was too heavy and not what I was looking for.  I prefer a lighter, more cake-like texture.

Great base recipe because the proportions are perfectly balanced. You can go wild from there (substitute splenda for half of the sugar, add raisins, nuts or chocolate chips) and the bread won't go wrong. Like someone else mentioned, it turns out out extra moist if you let the batter sit before baking it. We liked it better than the famous "banana banana bread"!

This is a great banana bread recipe but it can be made healthier.  I used all whole wheat flour, added some ground flax seed, 3/4 cup of turbinado sugar instead of white, reduced the butter to 3 T and added applesauce.  Cooking time should be reduced to 1/2 hour.  1 hour is way too long.

Amazing recipe!  Followed recipe exactly except added chopped pecans and used 1 regular size bread pan.  Cooked at 325 for 50 minutes and toothpick came out clean.  This was super moist and amazing.  Will definitely be making this again!

My first attempt at Banana Bread and it was excellent!  I added some things based on other reviews.  Sprinkle of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, and 4 bananas and made in one pan (350 for 45 min.  Very yummy, my whole family loved it.

I tried this recipe twice.  The first attempt I used the exact recipe. It was too "dry" and dense for our liking, so I changed it just a little bit.  Instead of three eggs I used only 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla for a little flavor boost.  The second batch came out with more flavor and SUPER moist.  I should mention I cooked these as muffins and not loafs!  So yummy!!!!!

Mmmmm...so good! As others suggested, I added an extra banana (mostly because I had four overripe bananas on hand), 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Cooked 30 min at 350, then 25 min at 325. Made a gorgeous loaf, and it was so moist and banana-y. My husband loved it! Best banana bread I've ever had.

Excellent! I had never made a banana bread before, and I chose this one because there were few ingredients, and I already all of them. I made it in one regular-size loaf pan. I baked it for just under an hour, long enough for a dark brown crust to form, but not long enough for it to get crunchy, which I don't like. It's so moist! Fantastic and very addictive. I love it slathered with butter-- I can never eat just one slice! I will be buying more bananas to let them become overripe so I can make this again!

I had 3 very ripe bananas on my counter and no heavy cream.  I was looking for a simple recipe for banana bread or muffins that I could make using only ingredients I had on hand.  This recipe did not dissapoint.  Very tasty and very easy.  I made over sized muffins and baked them for 27 minutes.  Delicious!

Very, very good!  I folded in blueberries which were an excellent addition.  I think this recipe would stand up well to the substitutions that others have suggested to make it even healthier...such as substituting part of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and using applesauce in place of half of the butter.

Best recipe for Banana Bread. I add chocolate chips, but that's personal preference....everything else I leave as directed. I am asked all the time for my 'secret' recipe. Thanks for posting this great recipe!!

Used 3 bananas.  Added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking power, 1/2 t. vanilla.  Used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Baked in a 9X5 pan for 45 minutes.  Very good!  Was a hit for a party that I took it to…will definitely make it again!

This is the best banana bread I've ever made. I added a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon... oh, yum.

It's easy, it's quick and it's moist, but most of all it's really good.  I used 3 of 5-1/2 x 1-3/4 loaf pan.  Reduced baking time to 35-40 minutes.  My 4 year old nephew ate 1/2 loaf for afternoon snack.

This was the recipe I was looking for!  It was simple and just like me mom used to make!  I used a stone that had 4 small loaves in it instead of a large loaf.  It turned out perfect!  The bread was moist and flavorful.  My bananas weren't as ripe as they should have been so I bruised them up by mashing them extra and the bread was perfect!  Thanks for a great simple recipe!

I added an extra banana and only baked for about 40 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe and the rest was the first and best homemade, moist and yummy banana bread I have ever had. Thanks Nikki!

If you only have a microwaveable bowl, 1c measuring cup, and a 1 teaspoon measuring spoon, you can make this--just fill 1/2 way for the smaller measurements needed. My teen son made this, cleaned up afterwards and we loved the bread! BOTTOM LINE: Fast, easy, tastes great, and does not take a lot of equipment.

This was okay. I cut the sugar by half because my bananas were really ripe. I ended up adding one more mashed banana and a quarter cup of buttermilk because the dough was just too dry. It came out well though tough because I ovemixed because of the lack of extra wet ingredients.

Delicous and moist.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it is a delicous bread.  Adding cinnamon and vanilla would bump up this recipe to a 5-star recipe.  It's still good without the additions. I removed the bread after 52 min because the top was getting pretty brown and the toothpick was coming out clean already.

I used 5 bananas instead of 3. Used 1/2 cup all purpose flour. 1/2 - whole wheat, 1/2 bread flour, and 1/2 a cup of flaxseed meal. Added pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. DELICIOUS!!!!

This is one of the best loaf recipes I have ever made!  I've made it twice ( doubled the recipe the second time) and it turned out perfect both times.  I did as others suggested, splitting the sugar into white and brown, and the other suggestions about baking powder and cinnamon, and we absolutely love it!

It was a snowy day and I was in the mood to bake.  I love Allrecipes.com.  I always keep ripe bananas in the freezer so I decided to search for a new Banana Bread recipe.  This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I baked one loaf in a full size loaf pan.  This is a keeper.

This was a quick and easy recipe that was pretty tasty, but lacking something.  I'm going to try my second batch and add some vanilla... I'll write back afterwards to let you know if this is the "missing" ingredient.  Thanks for the yummy and easy bread!

Haven't had banana bread in years, and this was as good as I remembered. I substituted half the white sugar with brown, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.. I think if I use this recipe again, I will include an extra banana for more flavor.

Very good.  I used 4 bananas, 2/3 c of walnuts and mine cooked in 45 mins.  I like that it makes small loaves and has only 1/8c of butter in each loaf.

I added 1tsp of Cinnamon, 1/4 cup of veg. oil, 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 tsp. baking powder and did not add salt because baking soda was salty enough.  It made 15 muffins, baked at 375 for 12-14 minutes.  I also added crunch topping ...1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon mixed into small pieces like oatmeal and sprinkled over the filled muffin tins.

GREAT bread, and sooo simple! I never have "on hand" what a recipe calls for- but I did this time! I was short one banana, so I used 3 eggs, 2 bananas, and a little more cinnamon- came out PERFECT.

Normally, I make my Grandma's banana bread but we really like this one. We've had it fresh out of the oven, cold, toasted, and tomorrow I'm going to see how it comes out as french toast. It slices well and has a good banana flavor. Great recipe!

Like others I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract, split the sugar into 1/2 c. of white and 1/2c. of brown. I also added 4 bananas instead of 3 to give it more of a banana taste! It was incredibly moist!!! The entire pan was gone in less than an hour...definitely will be keeping this recipe!

Quite possibly the best banana bread I've ever had. My girlfriend agreed (she says it was better than her mother's (and she NEVER says that)). It was the first time I ever attempted to make Banana Bread and it came out so well. Quick and easy.

This banana bread was the best. My daughter's birthday was Christmas Eve and we had a party for her and we gave out this banana as a thank you for coming and everyone told me that they loved the banana bread. We are making more today. It also freezes prefect. Thank you Nicki!!!

Absolutely fantastic!!! Although I did just pour all the batter into a larger loaf pan, the oven temperature and baking time still remained the same. The bread was incredibly moist both times I made it with a very delicious golden crust on the outside. Everyone who has it loves it, especially my 3 year old son. Would recommend highly to anyone who needs a banana bread recipe!

Loved this recipe.  Would've been a 5 if it rose a bit more!  This recipe made exactly 16 muffins when cooked for 22 minutes at 350*.  Really enjoyed the taste!!

I made this recipe on Mother's day. I added cinnamon too like some others.I also added chocolate chips to half of them and that was oh so good too! My family loved them. I made it in muffin pans instead of loaves and the gobbled them up! I am making more right now because they keep asking me to make more.I DID HOWEVER LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR TO 3/4 C.  So we'll see how it goes over this time. thanks for the recipe!

I made this to make banana bread french toast with, but we tried a piece before making it into french toast.  So good - moist, full of banana flavor, and lower in fat than most banana breads.  I did make it in 1 large loaf pan since I was using it for french toast.

This banana bread recipe was okay, not the best I have had.  It was not as moist as I would like and not as banana-y as I expected.  I added the 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp cinammon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract that other users recommended.  I definitely think it could have done without the baking powder (probably what made it too fluffy), and I would use a full tsp of cinammon and vanilla to  boost the flavor next time.  Might throw in some chocolate chips to make it as a dessert!

Added the extra 1/2 tsp baking soda as suggested.  I was going to add a 4th banana as well, but the bananas I had were good size and three looked like plenty.  Baked in a cast iron skillet for about 45 minutes at 350.  Turned out perfect!  Edges were crispy, center was moist but not gooey or falling apart.  Quick and easy to make!  :)

very delicious and simple recipe i did however make them into muffins instead of bread though and no baking soda so the substitute in case anyone needs to know for future reference is for every one teaspoon of baking soda equals 2 teaspoons of baking powder thanks for the recipe my kids love banana bread and this one was simple

I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and used 4 bananas, otherwise it would get 5 stars!  Makes a nice, large single loaf - 2 would be too shallow.

I used this recipe because I had exactly 3 overripe bananas crying out to be made into bread and it was fantastic! I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla to the mix. I found that by cooking the loaves for 45 minutes (covering them after 30 minutes) worked wonderfully in my oven - slighty crispy on the outside and oh-so-moist on the inside! This is my new banana bread recipe - loved by all!

I loved this recipe!  I used 4 bananas, whole wheat pastry flour, ground raw sugar, and I added chocolate chips.  Because this bread is so moist, no one detected the wheat flour.  It was fantastic right out of the oven.  I bought extra bananas so I could make it again.  I hope I can wait until they're brown!

stuck w/ the recipe but added 1tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the mashed bananas mixture (one more banana didn't hurt).. used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar .. put 1/2 tsp. baking powder and a dash of salt to the flour mixture .. all thanks to other reviews!!! Great basic recipe in which you can be creative. Good way of using brown bananas instead of throwing them in the trash.

I love this banana bread.  It is real easy and it only takes minutes to prepare. I did change some things. I added a 1/4 c. of brown sugar to the recipe and I only had a 9x5 loaf pan.  It took and hour to bake.

Excellent recipe and so easy, I always have the ingredients!  I didn't have enough butter so added what I had plus some strawberry applesauce.  It gave the bread a hint of strawberry and stayed moist. Also, only cook for 45 minutes!

I am a cook..I made this one night just for the kitchen staff..Wow,they went nuts over this bread..I have to say it is the moistest banana bread I have ever made.Its so funny..My co workers actually hide bananas so they can become over ripe just so I can make them bread :)

This recipe is super easy to make.  It was a little sweet though.  I used really ripe bananas and used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup.  If you don't have butter, margarine and shortening works well too.

Nice easy recipe.  A bit on the sweet side, but very tasty.  I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg for flavour.

I fixed this recipe for company, it was great! I added a little more bananas than called for just to use up what I had on hand and I also baked it in one larger loaf pan rather than the two smaller ones since it was for company. Next time I will follow directions for the two smaller pans. I recommend this recipe for everyone.

A deliciously moist, rich, and thick load, especially with the addition of chocolate chips. I sneak slices whenever possible!

I replaced the butter with oil and added 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. vanilla. I also used half brown sugar and half white, and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and the rest all-purpose. I baked it in a 9x5 pan for about 55 minutes and it came out perfect!

JUST what I was looking for!  Super simple, all ingredients on hand, and with the moist and dense texture I was looking for.  I made a few changes - added 1/2t baking soda, 1t vanilla, and an extra banana (since mine were on the small side).  Since I didn't have small loaf pans, I made mine into muffins instead (yield 16 large muffins), and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of each before putting them into the oven.  Baked at 350 degrees for 18 minutes, and they came out perfectly!  Definitely a keeper... my house smells heavenly.  ;)

Great recipe!!  I do like to add in a little vanilla, plus I use vegetable or canola oil instead of butter, because it's just easier.  Sometimes I like to double the recipe and substitute 1 1/2 cups of mashed ripe strawberries and make strawberry banana bread which was fabulous!!

I had never made Banana Bread before and was a bit hesitant as I searched for what I thought would be the better tasting one.  However, I chose this recipe and it turned out scrumptious tasting.  The only thing I added was 1 tsp. vanilla & 1 tsp. cinnamon and that was personal choice, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

Heavenly!  Made a few changes:  1/3 c applesauce instead of butter, added 1/2 c bran and 2 tbs ground flaxseed, a tbs cinnamon, 1/2 c sugar instead of 1 c, 1/5 c honey, an extra banana, an extra tsp of baking soda, and a c of chopped walnuts!  (also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose)  I baked for about 50 minutes in a 9x5 pan (Covered top with foil after 30 min).  Delicious! :D

Two thumbs way up from me.  I would definitely make this again.  I didn't have any eggs, so I substituted 2 tablespoons ground flax and 6 tablespoons water.  It turned out so tasty!

Perfect  banana bread. I made one loaf with half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour, and another loaf with chocolate chips. The chocolate chip load took about ten extra minutes to bake right through, and I followed the cooking time instructions exactly for the first loaf. This was so easy to make, with very impressive results. The loaf wasn't uncooked, too moist, crumbly, or dry. A+.

Quick and easy...this is my go-to banana bread recipe.  I usually use 4 bananas instead of 3, but otherwise I follow the directions to the letter.

This is a very tasty banana bread. Instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 1/2 cup of Splenda for Baking and that worked wonderfully. I also added a little vanilla and cinnamon like other reviewers. I made these in my mini bundt cake pan and got 8 mini bundt  cakes from this recipe. Can't wait to make again and experiment with different additions!

Super easy and delicious!  I have tried many banana bread recipes and none can compare to this recipe!  I usually double the recipe and freeze. The only thing I changed was to add nuts.  I like alot of nut so I usually add 2 1/2 to 3 cups cups of either pecans or walnut or mixed depending what I have on hand to a doubled recipe.

Deliciously moist, tasty and beautiful!  Must eat the Day After though - I think the flavors and the bread settle to perfection during this time. Thank you for the suggestions: 1/2 tspn of - cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda & 1 tsp vanilla. This one is a definitely keeper for the "family recipe box". Thanks again for sharing AllRecipes!

I've done this recipe many times and I think it's top notch-simple but good. 

It also works well with splenda (sometimes I add a little more than just a cup because I like it sweet).

I personally like to use a muffin tin (and lower the bake time accordingly).

Additionally, it tastes great if you (1) take an extra banana or two, cut it into thin slices, and, (2) after you  pour a little of the mixture into the dish or muffin tin, add a layer of banana slices (3) repeat step 2 until you run out of mixture and sliced banana

Very good.  Better the next day.  This will be my new banana bread recipe.  I followed the recipe but used a larger loaf pan (which made one batch).  I did the same time and temp as the recipe called for and it turned out great!

This bread was excellent!  I added 1 extra banana, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 2 tsp. milk and used one loaf pan instead of two (the next size up).  I wanted to add cinnamon but I ran out and didn't know it!  The bread still tasted delicious!  After 40 minutes I noticed the bread was browning too quickly while the top was not cooking at all.  I placed foil over the pan, turned the temperature down to 300 degrees and baked an additional 20-25 minutes.  It came out perfect for me.

Update:  I also made this recipe without any additions and it came out great as well!

This is a great recipe!  I've solved the pan size/baking time questions by baking it in a single bundt pan--no worries about underbaked center.  This bacic recipe is good as is, and works for endless variaitons.  The latest one I baked with 1/2 cup each of walnuts, raisins, and shredded coconut. YUM!

I decided to try a new banana bread recipe and am so happy that I chose this one.  It is delicious!!
Simple to make, very tasty, and very moist. Will not go back to my old recipe.  I did add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to this recipe.  I used 8 by 4 inch pans and baked the two loaves for 40 minutes. Thanks Nikki for a great recipe.

I loved this recipe.  My bread turned out so moist and with just a hint of Banana taste.  I added about a tbsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla for a different taste and I made it in a big loaf pan as I didn't have the mini loaf pan.  I can't stop eating it :)  I will make this again!

This is the best Banana Bread I have ever had.  I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon per other suggestions.  I didn't have loaf pans so I used an 8 x 11.5 pan & baked it for about 35 minutes. I will definitely be making this again.

The bread turned out great.  I made it and took it along with some other breads to a get-together and the banana bread went first.  I also added some vanilla and made it in one loaf pan.  I didn't know how it would turn out because the batter is pretty thick, but it was great.

This recipe is really good and really easy!  I followed the directions, but I did not use any salt, butter, nuts, and I used 4 bananas because that's what I had left.  I added a tablespoon of vanilla as recommended by others.  I also used apple sauce instead of butter.  I used the individual applesauce which is 1/3 cup.  Then just for fun, I added 1/6 cup of apple cider (it was half filled in my applesauce container).  It came out super good!  Just remember to check the loaf around 55 minutes, because it will be close at that point.  I will make again.  Thank you!

Made this for the first time using a 9x9 glass dish and only baked for 45 mins.  I used the suggestions to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla ext., 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  It came out very good but it isn't the best I've ever had.  I think next time I'll use bread flour and just use egg yolks.

These turned out PERFECT!!!! I added one tsp of pumpkin pie spice and one tsp of vanilla and instead of 1 cup of white sugar i did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. My batter made 12 muffins. These were by far THE best muffins ever!!!!

High altitude-I kept the ingredients and oven temp. the same; I just kept a close eye on it. It only took about forty five minutes to bake. Just the right amount of moisture and easy to make. Yum!

My hubby is diabetic, so I did a little playing around with the recipe.  I replaced the white sugar with 1/2 cup Splenda granular (NOT the one for baking) and 1/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar.  I also added one more banana since I had several that were getting too old to keep.  I also added 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract, as suggested by another reviewer.  I also took that reviewer's advice and replaced 1/2 cup of flour with whole wheat flour since I had some I needed to use.  Right before pouring the batter into the baking dishes, I mixed in 1 cup chopped pecans.  After splitting the batter into a bread dish and a cake dish, I baked them as per the instructions.  The only thing I will do differently next time is put the whole bowl of batter into one bread baking dish...the Splenda did not allow it to rise as much as it should have risen while in the oven so I cut it up into cake-like pieces when it was done.  Placed into just one dish would've made it "sandwich-slice worthy".

This is a great recipe.  I came across it almost 6 years ago on this website and have been making it ever since.   I use one 8X4 inch loaf pan and bake it for about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

This is my first time making banana bread and it turned out great!  I only had two large, ripe bananas, but the taste was great.  I would not have wanted it to be too bananaey.  I was a little worried because the crust was very brown, but I actually liked the taste of how brown the crust was.  I added to the recipe 1 tsp of vanilla and a heaping 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I look forward to trying it with 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar next time.  Overall, very easy and I will be making it again.

wow, i tried a lot of recipes for banana bread on here and this is the best. it only takes one bowl, simple to make and comes out perfect. i just did half brown sugar and half white, used oil in place of butter, made muffins. turned out great. i also set my oven to 325 but it could be that my oven heats really hot.

I would give this recipe 3 Stars as is. 5 + stars after I followed other user's suggestions and made the following changes: add 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp Vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and some chopped walnuts. I subsituted 1/2 the white sugar with brown sugar. I also added about 2 tbsp of canola oil to the recipe since I only had 2 bananas and was concerned about the bread not being most enough. I poured the batter into muffin pans (I used liners) and baked for 18 minutes. Perfect! By far the best banana muffins I've ever had!

This banana bread is absolutely delicious!  I made it for a friend's baby-shower on Saturday and was very pleased with the results.  My husband, who does not normally love banana bread, asked me to make it again today!

I've made a ton of different banana breads in my day and this one is at the top.  It comes together very, very easily and is moist and quite flavorful.  I think one of the best aspects of this recipe is that it does not call for any spices.  I've tried banana breads with cinnamon and nutmeg and I think these additions greatly detract from and over-power the flavor of the banana.  With this recipe, the banana is the main star. 

The only change I made to this recipe was to add semi-sweet chocolate chips...yummy!!  I also made this recipe into 3 mini loaf pans and it was perfect!

I added 1 tablespoon cinnamon, added an extra banana, and also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract-made them into muffins and cooked them for about 18 minutes-INCREDIBLE!  Everyone loved them-extremely moist!!!

This is wonderful.  Soft and full of flavor.

I did not have 2 7" bread pans so I used standard 8" and reduced my time to 45 minutes.  It was perfect.

Thanks Niki for posting this recipe!

I have been looking for an EASY yet delcious recipe for banana bread.....FOUND IT!!!  This recipe is awesome.....I did follow a few suggestions by adding vanilla and cinnamon.  I even added about 1C chocolate chips.  I cut the cooking time to about 45 minutes because I use a stoneware bunt pan and it cooks a little faster.  Overall.....A++++++++ recipe!

This was the first recipe in a long time that turned out perfectly.  Baked in a glass loaf pan and actually had to take it out after 40 minutes.  I made 1 large loaf instead of 2 smaller ones.  Thanks!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe on this site because it is so good, simple, and quick to put together. It doesn't call for a whole lot of ingredients or complicated process, but it sure makes a good old fashioned banana bread.  

I usually toss in raisins or chopped dates if I don't have walnuts/pecans.  Other things I have added with wonderful results are chopped maraschino cherries or shredded coconut. 

Although the bread bakes for one hour, it is always very moist.  House smells great during the last 15 minutes it bakes.  This banana breadhas become one of my husband's favorite treats.  

It's the only banana bread recipe I use now. Tasty!

I substituted the butter with 1 cup vanilla yogurt and added 1 cup chocolate chips.  Came out super moist and not too sweet.  Would use mini chocolate chips next time since they all sunk to the bottom of the bread.

I've tried so many banana bread recipes, but this one is the absolute BEST! I won't be trying any other from now on. 
I did change a few things though. I only had one pan (slighty bigger the the recipes uses) so I increased the baking time and made one larger loaf. I also only had two bananas so I added a tsp. of banana flavoring and a tsp. of vanilla. It was perfect! Thanks for a great "keeper" recipe.

I just made this and had a slice this is a keeper what I have been looking for. I did make some changes though. Added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla and used 1/2 cup splenda for baking and 1/2 cup of the splenda brown sugar. Used 4 bananas. Also by mistake becuase I did not read the ingredients correctly used half a cup of butter melted but then had another 1/4 cup of flour. Next time will add some cinnamon and nuts. This is a great recipe and it is a keeper.

This was soooo easy, moist, and tasty. I did use some of the suggestions from other cooks. I added 1/2 t of baking powder, 1/2 t of cinnamon and I used half white and half brown sugar. This made 3 mini loafs for me. I put choc. chips and pecans in one and it was yummy. Watch the time, though. I baked for 43 minutes, and it was probably done at 40 minutes. The hour that was called for would have really made mine dry.

A nice, easy banana bread recipe. I did follow the suggestions to add vanilla. I took it one step further the second time around and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Warm from the oven with butter, YUM!

This was my first time baking Banana Bread and it came out as I hoped!  I enjoyed how it came out - not too heavy, golden top, cake texture and nice and moist!  I read almost all the reviews and took the advice of using ½ Brown and ½ White sugars, and then adding 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon and an extra banana (I may try one additional banana on top of that next time).  I also wanted larger loafs so doubled the recipe and got two nice ones using a greased and floured 9x5 metal loaf pan (filling the pan with batter to the middle).  I have a gas stove, preheated approx. 10 minutes then baking one loaf at a time at 350 for just under 1 hour. Try lightly toasting and buttering for a breakfast treat - YUM!  Thank you Nikki for the recipe and other reviews for your tips, I will be making this again!

Maybe a little too good...I can't stop eating it!! I made a few changes to the recipe. 1) Used 1 cup white & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 2) Omitted 1/4 c. of sugar and used 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white, 3) added some cinnamon, 4) used 4 bananas, 5) added chocolate chips to one of the loaves. Both loaves were absolutely delicious (especially the one with the chocolate chips)! This is my new favourite banana bread recipe - delicious & very easy (I prefer this recipe over the Banana Banana Bread recipe from this site, although that recipe is good too).

Fantastic recipe!  I made some adjustments just like everyone else; half white and half dark brown sugar, and cinnamon.  I also threw some slivered almonds in and on top, and it was wonderful.  Thank you for this recipe!

Okay recipe. The consistency turns out nicely, but it's very bland. I added 2 T. vanilla, some cinnamon, and some nutmeg. I also replaced 1/4 c. of the sugar with dark brown sugar. In one loaf, I even added some chocolate chips. Wow!!

Finally!  I've been on a quest to find the perfect banana bread and this one is it.  I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, added some cinnamon and vanilla.  Perfect texture.  Thanks so much!

This recipe made the BEST banana bread I've ever made or eaten!!!  I doubled the recipe (due to tooooo many ripe bananas) and I ate 1/2 of the resulting bread within 24 hours.  My bf and son ate the other half just as quickly!  Definitely a keeper!

This turned out fantastic! I used three large bananas, and like many others, used half white and half brown sugar. I made it in a cake pan instead of a bread pan (couldn't find it), and it still turned out fabulous.

This is great bread. Really nice and moist, and very tasty. The only thing I would do differently is add more mashed banana. The taste is just a little too subtle. I made one plain loaf and 1 loaf with chocolate chips and crushed walnuts. Delicious!! The recipe really only makes one loaf. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tbsp vanilla and 1 tbsp milk. It definitely does not take an hour, although my oven cooks hot so it could in a normal oven. My bottoms always burn so I am baking this next time on a cookie sheet. Still very easy and very yummy. Will definitely make again. Thanks,
A.

This was so delicious! It was slightly crunchy and carmalized on the outside and really soft on the inside. I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg like others had suggested. I made two batches and it perfectly made 6 muffins and 1 large loaf of bread.

A simple great tasting loaf.  I added vanilla, pecans and cinnamon to mine for a little more flavour.

What a nice recipe. I have always made the WORST banana bread, but not any more. I tried this one and it's WONDERFUL. And so easy. I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and baked it for 50 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks so much.

This was my first banana bread and it turned out AWESOME. Even my mother was impressed.  :-)  Not an easy task. The kids loved it. I was able to prepare (seperatly) 2 loafs in less than 5 minutes, and the slow baking time allowed me plenty of time to clean my mess up.  ;-)

This is the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever found!!  I use it to make banana muffins too-- I just cut the cooking time in half and watch them to make sure they are cooked all the way through.  I have been using Nikki's recipe for the last 7 years (At least!!) and I would never switch to a different one.  :)

This recipe took only 10 minutes to mix up. I used egg whites instead of whole eggs to cut more fat, though it is already quite low. (¼ cup!) My family loves it. 
Note: I added 2 tbsp. milk for moistness and added another banana for flavor.

I really liked how mine came out. I cut this recipe by half the servings. Half filled my silicon 12 heart muffin tray pretty much perfectly. The only addition I made was a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla, which helped both taste and ease of mixing. I was able to bake them in 20 minutes at 350 too! Definitely plan to make them again when I have cravings for banana bread!

I use whole wheat flour and stevia instead of sugar. I also add in blue Barrie's and melt a few chocolate chips on top toward the end. It makes it a healthy desert even a teenager likes.

I picked this recipe because it had the least amount of sugar, my husband is border line diabetic so this is important to me. I do add vanilla and usually chocolate chips and walnuts or pecans those are the only changes I've made. It only makes one loaf for me, maybe my pan is bigger?  But still only takes about 45 minutes to bake. My family loves this recipe, a loaf said me times doesn't even last a day!

This is an excellent banana bread.  I made this for the 2nd time in 3 weeks.  I like that the ingredients are items that you already have in your pantry.  I did add about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and cut back on the sugar to just 3/4 cup.  I may cut back to 1/2 cup next time because the finished bread was plenty sweet.  I've also used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white and added 1/2 cup choc chips and 1/2 cup nuts.  Will definitely be using this recipe again and again.  Thank you!

Just awesome! I followed the recipe as is the firts time but after that I have been adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla they add a nice flavor, and I cut the sugar in 1/2 (that was too much sugar for me. I used mini loaf pans and baked for 35 mins. The key to getting moist loaf is to not over back it. 1hr is too long for this loaf.

love this it's so simple! I didn't have any bananas, so i used a longtime resident of my pantry...that old can of pumpkin puree! One cup of pumpkin equals 3 medium bananas; i also added a heaping tsp of pumpkin spice and 2 tsp of vanilla extract..best idea ever!!!

Very simple and yet VERY YUMMY!! I made it as is with a little cinnamon and vanilla extract. I think next time I will lessen the sugar because with the ripe bananas and a cup of sugar is a little much but the fact is IT WAS GOOD!! And silly me for saying ME in this. My 4 yr old is the one who made it really I just measured and she did everything else

What banana bread isn't good?  The only thing I would change about this one would be to put it in one pan.  Dividing it up makes the loaves too small.  
Thank you for the recipe!

Just made this recipe and it turned out Awesome! Daughter just got home from school and smelled the the muffins and couldn't wait for them to cool off. I made a few adjustments as well as the others: 1 1/2 c of smashed bananas, added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon & vanilla extract and of course choc. chips, then used 8 big muffin cups and put 4 ea.in round cake pans. It was just enough for all 8.  Baked them for them 1/2 hr depending on your oven.....This is definetly a keeper!!!

Great .. Light .. And fast! I made same changes that others recommended.I used unbleached flour 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and I  Added 1 tsp vanilla and cinnamon 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I also used 1/4 cup of canola oil instead of butter and I added wheat germ and flax seed to make it a little heAlthier. The time definitly needs to be cut down to about 40 minutes. Bread comes out very light not a strong taste. If your looking for a super banana bread taste this isn't for you. U should try extreme banana bread on this site it's great ...but since I need a healthier recipe this works great. Did I mention how fast this recipe is to make. I through all wet ingredients in my food processor and then mixed with dry. It came our great.... My 3 yes says she's going to eat it all!!

This is such an easy recipe!  We use gluten free flour and bake it in Pampered Chef mini loaf pan.  It comes out perfect every time, and you can never tell it isn't made with "regular" flour.

Excellent recipe. I didn't have walnuts, so I used almonds and it was super tasty.

This recipie was very scrumptios! My mom dad and myself loved it. I added cinnamon and vanilla and made it into muffins instead of bread and changed the cooking time to 30 minutes. I give it 5 stArs it's definitly something to try if you like bananas and bread.

Good and easy to make. But don't think I'm too much of a banana bread person. And the kids didn't really care for it either.

Made this yesterday, turned out good. Very moist. I did add some extra ingredients: cocoa powder, vanilla and an extra banana. And from a previous review i baked for about 45-50 mins. Only complaint is wasn't enough banana, even with 4.

I really liked this banana bread! My dad tasted it and I asked him if he liked this one better or the one that I made last week.  He said that he liked this one because it has more flavor and is pretty moist.  I added an extra banana because I wanted to finish all the bananas I had, so I used 4 bananas total.  Then I also added a little more flour, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  The result was very good.  It only took around 40 minutes to bake the one loaf and 20 minutes to bake the "cupcakes".  This is a great recipe.  Btw, I rated it a 4 because I used some other ingredients too.

I think the placement of the rack during backing is part of the key with making this a 5 star recipe. Mine was slightly less than halfway in the oven (lower as opposed to higher) and it took nearly 1 1/2 hours to bake. I didn't tinker much, just added 1/2tsp of Cinnamon but likely could have tossed in some nutmeg as well. The result was a heavy dense but tasty loaf. It's not a bad loaf for basics but I wasn't wowed.

This bread is the best!!  As suggested by other review, I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and exchanged 1/2 the sugar with brown sugar.  I also added chocolate chips.  The texture was great - soft inside and crusty on the outside.

This is a really great recipe. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon as well as 1 tsp vanilla, the zest of a lemon and about 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries. Instead of loaves I made a dozen muffins, I baked them for 12 minutes, rotated them and baked them for additional 12 minutes. Really great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is my go to recipe. I have tried other recipes and they always taste bland and don't turn out as well. I add 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the bread batter and before baking, I sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon on top. YUMMY! I have been told it's the best!

This was a very easy recipe, I did change it a little. I added 2 tbsp ground flaxseed & substituted 1/2 c wheat flour for 1/2 c of the white. I made one big loaf in a 9"x5" pan and cooked it for 55min. It was the best banana bread I've ever had!!!

Delicious!  I made 1 small loaf, and 12 muffins (I added 1/2 cup of small chocolate chips to the muffin portion).

Watch your time carefully.  Muffins were done in 20 minutes.  The Loaf in 30.

I gave this only 4 because the recipe wasn't perfect until it was tweaked.  After the adjustments though it definitely gets 5 stars!  I increased the bananas to 4 and mashed them coarsely so I would have chunks of banana in the bread, replaced all the white sugar with dark brown sugar, added cinnamon to taste and added 4 heaping tablespoons of chunky natural peanut butter and cooked in a mini loaf pan (I ended up with 8 mini loafs).  It was dense and moist with perfectly cracked and brown crust!  Fantastic right out of the oven with butter on top or the next day I popped it into the microwave to reheat.  YUM!!

We really enjoyed this banana bread.  I can't imagine how this amount of batter could have made two loaves.  I have a 9 inch loaf pan and it made a perfect sized loaf.  I liked the simplicity of the recipe, with no buttermilk or sour cream, which I usually don't have on hand. This was a great, comforting, old fashioned tasting version of banana bread.  I'll be making this again the next time I have bananas lying around!

This recipe was simply delicious. I found that the bread was extremely moist and the crust was crunchy without being too hard. The flavor was very good although I did make a couple of modifications. I added so vanilla extract and extra sugar along with extra butter and a banana. I must admit that i did not measure the extra ingrediants but go by my personal taste. Overall this was one of the best banana bread I have had in a long time.

This was my first time making banana bread and my husband and I thought this came out great!  I did half brown sugar and half white sugar, with cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla as others have suggested!  I only used three bananas, but I think next time I will use four if I have them on hand.  I only cooked the bread for about 40 minutes and it was browned and very moist on the inside.  Any longer of a cook time would have been too much in my oven.  I will be making this recipe again.

My husband just LOVED this recipe.  He said it is the best banana bread I have ever made.  I guess because I was always using the lower fat recipe, "Almost no fat banana bread", which was good but obviously this is sooo much better.  I guess we're switching.

This banana bread was the best. I've tried many recipes in the past and this one was by far the best and most moist!! I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 cup chocolate chips as well. I baked them in a cupcake pan and reduced the cooking time to 20 minutes. I think thats why they were so moist. Usually in a loaf pan the edges dry out before the inside is done. A definate keeper!!! Mmmmm!!

I think this banana bread would have turned out a bit plain if I hadn't done a few alterations - 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and I even added 1/2 cup chocolate chips! It was awesome!

I love this recipe...very tasty results!  I did the same changes that a lot of reviewers did: 4 bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, cinnamon to taste.  I also added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  Everyone has really enjoyed this bread.  The recipe is super easy, even for a beginning baker like myself.

The BEST banana bread I have ever made!  SOOO moist and delicious!  I onlly had 1 egg and used it and this recipe turned out fine with just the one.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla just because I like those tastes in my banana bread.  thank you so much for this great recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I have been baking for years and I have tried many banana bread recipes and this is by far the best I have EVER made!  I also added one extra banana, half b. sugar and the vanilla and baking soda (like others had suggested) in ONE pan for about 55 minutes.  SO good.  It was gone in half a day.  I'm going to make another one right now!

This is a great recipe as is, but am thinking of adding 1 tsp. cinnamon & vanilla to see if I can kick it up a notch. Otherwise a fabulous recipe worth trying and loving. My boyfriend and I loved it!!!

I used this recipe twice - both times i added the 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and adjusted the sugar to 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. The first time I added an extra banana but it came out too mushy. The second time I kept it at 3 bananas and it came out PERFECT. Im a college student and my roommates hovered around the oven while it baked and ate it up as soon as it came out! I also had the bigger loaf pan so I adjusted the temperature to 350 for 30 min and 300 for another 30 min. It still burned a little on a the edges so I may fiddle around with the time and temp a bit more. Overall, a perfect recipe!

I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp cinnamin and did not add any butter (to cut the fat), so instead I added 1 more banana.  I cooked it for 50 minutes and it came out absolutely perfect!!!

I was looking for a recipe that didn't have baking powder as I had run out and didn't feel like running to the store!So,  thought I would try this-- everyone loved it, even my picky son. I meant to add walnuts but forgot, it was still great. VERY MOIST! I baked in into one regular size loaf pan. Also I did a couple things differently- did the half white sugar half brown, for the 1 1/2 cups flour--the half cup I put in whole wheat flour the rest I did the white. I  try to sneak in healthy things when I can without my kids realizing it. I also added two TBS of milled flax seed, which I thought for sure one of the kids or my husband would comment on "it tastes weird" or something. NO one even noticed, so mums the word on that. Plus I added an extra banana, and I also did at a couple shakes of cinnamon and vanilla. Will make again. Thanks for the base!

I used this recipe to make 3 mini loaves, and they were done in 35 minutes. I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, and 3 and a half bananas. I made one loaf plain, one loaf w/ choc. chips, and one loaf w/ chopped pecans. I really liked the taste of all 3 but they didn't rise as much as I'd hoped, so I might add baking soda next time.

great recipe. i followed the directions, and added walnuts. i didn't pay much attention to the cooking time. at one point it looked like the ends were done, but the middle wasn't. i turned down the oven to 200 and left it in for about 20 minutes. i was afraid the ends would be dry or hard, and that it would be unevenly cooked, but it was perfect, even the ends. this is a really easy recipe!

I've tried so many different banana bread recipes over the years, and this is the best.  Will never make another!  The only thing I did differently was added a 4th banana and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and added walnuts.

Fool Proof!!! Took the others' advice and did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Otherwise followed the directions to the tee. Only took about 40 minutes to bake. Came out perfect, sweet, moist, and dense. PERFECT!!!!

This is a super basic banana bread recipe. I like that it uses items most people already have on hand.

I add 1/2 tsp vanilla to mine, and have made it with all white sugar, and half white and half brown sugar. Either way, I get perfect results!

Very good recipe.  I did make some changes due to the other reviews.   I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder since people said they didn't rise much.   Overall an excellent recipe that I will use again.  OH, I also made them into muffins instead of bread because I didn't have 2 small loaf pans.  I baked them at 375 for 18 minutes.

SO incredibly moist and full of flavor.  I did add 1 t of vanilla to the batter, though, plus 3/4 c chopped walnuts.  I also baked it in a bundt cake pan and the actual bake time was only 35 min.  Keep an eye on it while baking...it may not take an hour.  I'll definately make it again.

Very good moist bread! I was a little skeptical of there being no spices but it was perfect! I added the nuts and not being a "nut person", I do not think I would ever make this without the nuts! A perfect balance!

This was very easy and good. I was able to make it half asleep (to make it for my fiancee's b.fast) and it still turned out. It did not take as long as it said it would-- only about 25 minuets.

This is a very easy, tasty banana bread.  After reading other reviews, I decided to add some cinnamon, 1/2 cup of raisins, and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  Then I sprinkled the top with a cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  It came out perfect and tastes great!  I used 2 bread loaf pans, and these were too big, and the bread isn't very tall.  Next time I will use the mini loaf pans.  Definitely making this one again!

This was good, it had a nice banana flavour.  I used really ripe bananas.  I used Splenda in place of the white sugar, and I cut the margarine in half and added 1/2 a banana to replace the fat.

This was really good. I used a larger loaf pan so the cooking time was a lot longer. I'd been meaning to make banana bread for a while, I used bananas from the freezer. It turned out quite nice. I also used a dash of cinnamon too and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

Though this recipe seems closer to cake consistency than bread consistency, whatever label one puts on it, it's superb!  I doubled the recipe and had a little batter left after filling a large bread pan, so I made several muffins.  Obviously, the muffins were done quickly--after about 40 minutes, but the middle of the loaf took well over an hour.  The middle was stubborn and took forever to get done.  I finally had to cover the top with foil because it was golden brown, but the inside was still soggy.  FINALLY, it finished up.  The hassle was well worth it.  I suspect the smaller loaves were recommended for the very reason I had trouble--a large loaf is difficult to bake consistently all the way through.  I'll probably make smaller loaves next time.  I'm still a novice baker, so I learn something new with each project.

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I added one cup choc. chips and 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  Be careful with the cooking time... 40 minutes was PERFECT!!  It was gone the same day I made it.  I gave the recipe to my mom to make for company...everyone loved it!  I will definately make this again.

I added 1 tsp of vanilla, and I made 9 mini-loaves instead of 2 big ones.  This recipe is great because you can get rid of overripe bananas using ingredients that you probably already have on hand!  Thanks for the recipe!

This easy recipe is a great way for busy moms to use up those leftover bananas.  My kids like this one so much that we buy those cheap brown bananas at the store just to make this.  Great bread for a take along snack or a dessert for after lunch.  Nuts add a lot to this recipe.  Almost identicle to my grandmas banana bread reicpe.

This was pretty good, although we've had better.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla extract (no walnuts, since I was out) and I think it really enhanced the flavor. I think without those additions, this would just be your average bread.  Mine also browned a little too much on the sides (not sure if it was due to the pan I was using, which was glass), and I even lowered the temp to 325 too. Overall, a good recipe, but there are better banana bread recipes out there (just have to keep looking).

Yummy!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Also, only baked for 45 minutes at 350.  My children are chowing down and I'm not sure the loaf will make it until their father gets home.  Thanks a bunch!

We don't know Banana Bread in Holland!
I thought it would be like our Dutch "cake",(which is always a big disaster when I make it) but it really wasn't! I followed the given suggestions; I added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and 4 bananas. The top began to brown too much after 20 minutes, so I covered the bread with foil.
Wow!!! I can't describe the taste.
Now I'll have to buy a suitable loaf pan!!

This was the best banana bread I have ever had! The recipe was easy, and very quick. I used a square loaf pan, and cooked it for an extra 15 minutes. It came out great. Even my 4 year old liked it, and getting her to eat is like pulling teeth! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is a new banana bread recipe that I tried for a change and it is great.  Everyone I have made it for loves it.  I adjusted the recipe by adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 2 tablespoons of milk to the recipe.  It was the moistest banana bread I have ever tried.  Thanks for the recipe Nikki!

This was the first time I'd made banana bread and it all went the first night.  I took other peoples advice and added some vanilla and cinnamon.  My loaf pan was slightly bigger so I reduced the baking time to 40 mins which meant it was still moist!  Will definitely make again.

My daughter and I really enjoyed this banana bread, with the following adjustments: 3/4 c pecans, 2t vanilla, 2t cinnamon, and 1 1/2 t (roughly) grated orange peel.  The orange peel added a great taste to the bread.  Next time I'll add whole wheat flour like a previous reviewer recommended.  This was a nice, flavorful, dense bread; a little dry, probably because I overcooked it (oops).

i absolutely adored it! i made one for my in laws (which may i add are the pickiest eaters in this world) and they finished it in less than an hour. i also made some for my parents and they loved it also. now for any special occassion they ask me to bring some of that bread over. i found that it taste better when you use the bananas that have mostly brownish peel. you know when the banana is the most ripe?

I sold out of these quick at a college bake sale everyone loved them.
I also was able to make them in the dorm.  We have a community kitchen so I used it.  
It wasn't too diffcult.

Doubled and added extra 3/4 cup flour plus used brown and white sugar. Vanilla and chopped toasted nuts are good add-ins.  Ended up getting a pretty bunt pan size and loaf.  Will make this great recipe again. Thank you for sharing.
edit:  I found three more bananas so made another loaf. This time I added  1Tbs spiced rum instead of vanilla plus 3/4 cup flaked coconut, 3/4 cup dried cherries and 1/2 cup extra flour.

This made  a very good banana bread, the consistency was great, I didn't have to make any adjustments for high altitude. It rose nicely. I followed the recipe as written. Very good banana flavor. Next time I will with use unsalted butter or cut back on the salt just a little because it was just a tad salty. I made 5 mini loaves. Thank You for this recipe!

Super moist and Yummy! I added a extra banana. But other than that, no ingredients were altered. As far as baking time, I definitely cut the baking time down. One loaf only took a half hour.  The other a tad bit longer. I will most definitely make again! Thanks Nikki

I’m giving it 4 stars due to similar adaptations as everyone else. 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 c. brown AND white sugar, 1/2 tsp. baking powder. It provided more warmth in the taste that reminds me of Fall. This freezes beautifully with no change in taste.

I made this banana bread - following the recipe exactly - to use up some overripe bananas. I chose the recipe because it had excellent ratings and because I had all the ingredients on hand. What I didn't expect was for it to be such an exceptional recipe! It was a big hit at work, and two co-workers asked for the recipe. The second time I made it, I added some cinnamon and vanilla, but it's not really necessary. This is the perfect "basic" banana bread recipe. You can make it as written or doctor it up to suit your taste or the season. Highly recommend!

I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and replaced half the sugar with brown sugar, as suggested in other comments. I left it in the oven a little too long, but it still tastes great warmed up with some butter!

I found that there was too little liquid in this recipe and had to add 1/2 a cup of milk to liquidify it out for pouring and subsequent cooking.
However, as it was only made with 2 bananas it came out very banana-ry and nice.

Easy recipe to follow, results are tasty.  I like to add nuts, or choco chips, and vanilla to mine.  This time I topped it up with sweet coconut flakes on top of the bread before it went into the oven.  This is my go-to recipe always.  Easy to prepare in less then 15 minutes before it is ready for baking.

Added chocolate chips and baked in bread machine. I should have set it to light crust instead of dark, because I burned it. I cut crust off all sides and it was wonderful!

GREAT RECIPE!   My changes to the original recipe, were from other reviewers here, they included: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 powered sugar (I was out of granulated white sugar), 2 ounce package of chopped walnuts, a snack sized box of raisins, 4 ripe bananas, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon vanilla. The texture of this reminds me more of banana spice cake, it is very moist, and I recommend this recipe, highly.

Great recipe - took some other reviewers advice and added cinnamon and baking powder and vanilla (tsp of each).  Also used applesauce in place of the butter (one snack sized cup) and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white.  Baked for 55 minutes in 1 9 inch loaf pan.  Came out moist and delicious.

This Banana Bread is the best I have found. I have had to modify the time and used bread flour instead, but it still tastes delicious. Also we added some chocolate chips to one loaf, just to keep my son and husband happy!

Over the years I have baked banana bread occasionally for my family, and it never did turn out like I had wanted (too light, too doughy, etc).  After adding about a half a cup of applesauce (to make the bread extra moist), and a couple extra tablespoons of flour and sugar (to compensate for the applesauce) this bread turned out delish!  My mother would never give me her blue-ribbon winning banana bread recipe, and I swear this one tastes just like hers!  Thanks Nikki for sharing, now I can enjoy homemade banana bread again!

I really loved this recipe! I only wanted one loaf, so I halved the recipe. It turned out so delicious! The only small changes I made were to split the sugar into 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and I also added a little cinnamon. It turned out perfect and moist! It's not necessarily a heavy, thick banana bread, but this is exactly what I was looking for anyway. Yum!

This bread was surprisingly awesome.  The reason being is that it is so simple to make and has simple ingredients.  I did add/substitute a few things.  I firstly made only one loaf and cooked it at 325 for about an hour and ten minutes.  I used 4 medium sized bananas, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 c brown sugar-1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c of wheat flour and 1 c white, and I added some wheat germ.  It was delicious and more healthful than other banana recipes I've tried.  This will be my go-to healthy banana bread recipe.  Thanks.

I found this bread to be very dry and no flavor at all in spite of the bananas.  I also got only one loaf, not two.  I did not like this recipe and won't be making it again.

I followed the suggestion of another & used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, substituted apple sauce for the marjarine.  I didn't measure the bananas, I just mashed 3 over-ripe ones. To make a little more healthy, I added 2 tablespoons of fax seed.  DELISH!!  I will definately make this again and again and again........ Hubby loves it!  I might add crushed walnuts next time, but still wonderful without the nuts! Bu the flax still gave it a nutty flavor! Very moist!  Oh, I used a bundt cake pan as I couldn't find my bread pan.

This recipe was good and very easy. I will make it again. This time I followed the recipe exactly as written. I think next time I will add nuts or raisins for texture.

I love this banana bread and so does my family. I won't dare try another recipe, even if there is a better one out there. My family, especially me Father loves this bread and make it especially for him as often as possible. Sometimes I add walnuts and sometimes not, but either way, delicious!

This recipe is fine, but not quite good enough for 5 stars.  The recipe says to make 2 loaves, but I think (based on the pictures) most reviewers make 1.  I made the 2 as suggested and they cooked in 35 minutes-- actually they were a bit overcooked, probably could have taken them out in 30 minutes, but I was planning to leave them in the oven for an hour since that's what the recipe said to do.  The loaves came out about 1 inch high, so not an impressive-looking bread.  I'd suggest making only 1 loaf out of this recipe and putting it in for the entire hour.

This is such a simple recipe and always delicious. I substitute 50% of the white flour with wheat flour and always use at least one extra banana, as well as add some cinnamon. This recipe also makes excellent muffins; just be sure to reduce the cooking time.

Mmmm, so yummy. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla so it's kind of like a banana smoothie bread. I couldn't resist licking the bowl either because the batter was just SO good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made mini loafs and they turned out fantastic. I also added a little vanilla extract and cinnamon, but thats just how I like it. i also added thick cuts of banana on the top for more texture/flavor. Great recipe.

This is the first time I made banana bread, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I did what the top reviewer suggested, I added more banana, flour, vanilla, and baking soda, turned out yummy!  I used one standard loaf pan.  So easy!  Next time I will use only 1.5 tsp of baking soda instead of 2 tsp as suggested by the top review.

I made muffins out of this batter (used the whole recipe for 12 muffins), left the bananas in big chunks, put chunks of chocolate on top of the muffins, put it on the oven for 18 minutes like the other person did.... put some butter on top....

..

The best muffins ever!

I will certainly try making the banana bread when I visit my family for Christmas.

Thank you for the recipe, and have a great day!

I made several adjustments that were suggested above. I added peanut butter, cinnamon, vanilla and an extra banana. It came out a bit dry, but the flavor was very good. I don't know what I can do to correct the dryness of the bread because the flavor was great. Maybe extra butter. Any suggestions please let me know, but the chunky peanut butter was a great addition without being overwhelmed by nuts.

Great, simple recipe.  I prefer some more spice in my banana bread so I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I also did one batch with chocolate chips and one with nuts.  Both turned out delicious!

Thought I'd give this a fair shot and make as is (everyone else seemed to alter recipe)  Hindsight, I would follow what others had suggested!  Yes, the bread is very good but not anything mind blowing or unique.  The ingredients are almost the same as "Banana Muffins II", one of my favs but this recipe doesn't even compare in taste.  Next time I have ripe bananas I'll make the muffins instead :D

I found this recipe in a pinch. This is by far the best banana bread recipe I've ever used. I did use one extra banana because my family likes the flavour. I like how easy it is to prepare and the taste is the BIG pay off. Thanks, Wendy

This was EXCELLENT!  I did as others suggested and used 4 very ripe bananas.  2 of them I mashed pretty well the other 2 I left lumpy.  I added cinnamon and nuts.  YUMMY!

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I love to cook, but I am not a baker.  It was super-easy and tasted wonderful.  I also added the cinnamon, vanilla, and 1/2 c. of brown sugar.  I only baked it for 45 minutes and it was perfect.

I would give it a 5 for flavor and moistness!!  It was very good.  But, I didn't have the same size pans that she had. That is an awkward size.  So, I just put it in a 9x13 and only had to bake it for about 35 minutes.  I really had to be mindful of the bread so that it didn't burn.  Unfortunately, because I baked it in a 9x13, it didn't have the denseness that most banana breads have.  Having said all that, the flavor is incredible!!  I think the butter adds to a lot of moisture to it.  I'll try to find the size pan that she has.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe that I have used every two weeks since I found it three months ago!  I do add FOUR extra ripe mashed bananas, 1 tablespoon of sour cream, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  My loaves have always baked in 40 minutes (practically on the dot.)  I highly recommend it!

I took a chance and first time around tripled this recipe. I didn't alter the measurements at all, simply multiplied them by 3. Only modifications where I used half a brick of cream cheese along with the butter. I had a freezer full of ripe bananas so I had to try something, LOL. I used a total of 13 regular sized  over ripe bananas. I didn't include nuts. I made three large loafs which took about an extra 15 min or so to complete and let the loaves stand covered for about a half hour. They turned out fantastic! Very moist and delicious.

This was a great recipe!  I made it into muffins instead of loaves, and baked accordingly. I also added an extra  banana and some vanilla. They were very good! It was my first time making banana bread, so with what little knowledge I have I think they turned out great! LOL.. Apparently my husband liked them too, he ate 3 the night that I made them!

I followed everything to a T and it tasted funny.  It was edible but I could taste the baking soda!  I checked the spoon I used for it and it was a 1 tsp meauring spoon.  Very strange!  I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

Awesome and simple.  The banana's weren't mashed all the way because I don't have a masher and just used a spoon, but it came out nice and moist like my mother makes.  It was a very good treat.

My kids loved this bread,,,it was completely gone the next day. I wound up getting 4 mini loaves out of it, made 2 plain and made 2 with semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.  Really delicious! I did take the suggestions of adding the baking powder, 1/2 white and brown sugar and vanilla. Had no problems with the bread rising or anything,,,,I am a pretty experienced baker and this was so easy and the results were fantastic!  This will be my recipe from now on.  Thanks so much!

Easy prep and cook; I added vanilla, cinnamon, and a dash of ginger for flavor.  I didn't have mini loaf pans so I cooked the whole thing in a 9x5 loaf pan.  After 40 minutes the top was brown but the inside wasn't done, so I covered it with a foil tent and baked at 300F for another 20 minutes.  Turned out perfectly, with a lovely banana taste.

1st time and it turned out beautifully.  Subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1/4 c margarine, thinly sliced last banana instead of mashing, and added 1/2 cup choc chips.  The top browned too quickly so turned down the oven to 300F and put a tent of foil over.  Baked full hour and it came out perfectly moist.  Great recipe!

Excellent flavor! I added 1 tsp. vanilla (as suggested by other reviewers) to the banana mixture, and then after mixing, added in around 1/3 c. chopped walnuts.  I mashed 2 of the bananas until creamy, and left the 3rd more chunky-- which ended up in awesome banana-ribbons throughout the loaves. The only problem was that when I checked the loaves at 45 minutes they were a bit over-done, so next time I will take them out after 40 minutes. (One hour would have left me with burnt bricks.) Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe!

I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 cup walnuts and used a mixture of 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Baked the loaves for 40min.  YUMMY!!  Thanks so much for an easy basic and tasty recipe.

this was my first attempt at making banana bread...my aunt makes the best b-bread, so i was a bit intimidated. i followed the basic recipe, but i made the following changes: half white sugar and half demerra sugar (it gives the bread a really deep flavour) and added a tsp of vanilla extract. didnt really mash up the bananas, just mixed it right in for a chunkier texture. i also added .5 cup of walnuts and choc chips each, and topped the bread with a butter, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon crumble. baked it up i a 9x5 loaf pan for abt 40-45 mins, and it tastes like perfection. THISIS BANANAS!!!!!!!!!!!! :P

Excellent!  I did add the 1/2 teaspoon of powder as suggested in other reviews.  I made a double batch and after I poured into pans I added nuts to 1, dried blueberries to another, choc chips to the 3rd and made the 4th plain.  I freeze them whole, then when someone pops over I slice some from each (which is so easy when frozen).  It makes a pretty plate with all the different add ins and there is something for every taste!  They freeze beautifully!

This was good.  I made into muffins instead for easier serving for group of people.  Bake it for 18 mins.  Also added baking powder and vanilla extract based on some of the reviews.  Good muffins.  Thanks.

Nikki this was soooo good.  I quadrupled the recipe and added one extra banana. I made 2 dozen muffins and 2 loaves of bread.  I bought very ripe bananas to have banana bread and found yours here.  The whole family loves this bread.  Hubby likes the muffins best.  I filled the muffin cups 3/4 full and they made really good sized muffins.  I baked them at 425 for 15 to 20 minutes.  This recipe was easy to follow and very flavorful.  I have found the perfect recipe for our family.  Thanks.

This is a very moist recipe.  I added about 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter.  I did not have the 2 small loaf pans for this recipe, so I used the 9x5 pan I had on hand.  I decreased the cooking time to 45 minutes (still at 350).

Very basic, but good.  I added healthy dashes of allspice and cinnamon, and a teaspoon of vanilla,  which made all the difference.  I baked it as one 9x5 loaf as well.  An excellent banana bread.

Yummy banana bread!!!  I made this before breakfast and could have eaten the whole thing by myself!  Watch carefully- mine was done in about 40 minutes at 350.

WOW!! That is the nicest banana bread I have ever tasted! I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to it.

I also made some muffins with the mix that wouldn't fit into my tin. I added some chocolate to this and cooked it for only 20 minutes and they were perfect!! I strongly reccommend everyone try this

I hate banana bread (and all other banana-related things), so I'm basing my review on my husband's and sons' reactions.  They all loved it.  It was such an easy recipe, too; my three year old helped, and we had lots of fun.  My only major criticism would be the bake time: mine was done in just over thirty minutes, which is only half the time stated in the recipe.

This is a very simple recipe. Follow the steps exactly and you'll get a nice,good,moist banana cake. As for me, I added halves walnut in the cake,therefore the banana cake doesn't come out plain.Didn't even bake it for 1 hour.Took me only 1/2 an hour to get the inserted wooden toothpick comes out clean.Very fast indeed! :) Hope you like it too

Oh my this was sooooooo good! This recipe will replace the banana recipe I have been using for years. I did make some changes though. I added the cinnamon and vanilla as suggested by others, used half sugar and half Splenda, used Egg Starters in place of the eggs, and I did not have enough white flour so I used some wheat flour and it came out great. Thanks for a recipe that has a new home in my recipe box.

Excellent taste and so easy! My 14 year old son helped make this and it was a breeze! We doubled the recipe and made 2 good sized loaves. Added vanilla and cinnamon and used 7 bananas total. I had to add foil the last 15 minutes of cooking to prevent burning. Even with two loaves this only took 45 - 50 minutes in my oven. Thanks you for a simple and delicious post!

This is the first banana bread recipe that I have really liked!  I made just one large loaf instead of two smaller ones, and baked it for one hour.  It smelled great while baking, and it tasted great too. I did add about 1/4 cup chocolate chips since I love the flavor of chocolate with banana, and I added 1 tsp. vanilla.

I added a few things to the recipe and thought I would share.  I added one more banana, a tsp. or so of vanilla extract, nutmeg to taste and about a 1/4 cup of pulverized hazel nuts (I turn the nuts into virtual flour so the kids won't notice them and yet I get the nutty flavor...mom's have to be smart about it!)  This recipe says to bake for one hour, I set my timer for 50 minutes and was glad I did, it was done, although I only baked one loaf at a time.  The kids said this is the best ever and I agree.  Very good, dense and moist and you can't beat the smell throughout the house.  I don't think the second loaf will make it to the freezer.

I have a diabetic in the house, so I already knew I'd be substituting splenda for the sugar, but much to my surprise, I didnt have flour..so my next option was to use my Atkins Bake Mix (also used for the diabetic in my household).  I used the vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by others and it was absolutely fantastic...definitely worth 5 stars!!!

YUM. I made these as muffins instead of bread. I added 1 t. cinnamon, 2 T. ground flax seed, and one extra banana and it turned out great! Not too dense, but dense enough. I'll definitely make this one again.

Very easy to make and it came nice and moist. I added a little vanilla and used 1/2 cup each of brown and white sugar as some suggested. I baked it in an 8inch cake pan for 30 minutes since I couldn't find my loaf pan. This is a keeper!!!

I saw that I had a few bananas going mushy, popped on All Recipes, and found this recipe. Fifteen minutes, and all was in the oven and the kitchen was clean. Now, I'm eating the best banana bread that I swear I've ever had. I did use the vanilla, as suggested by others. This is an incredible recipe!

Very good.  Added 1/2 tsp of vanilla per suggestions (also pecans).  Moist and so easy to make.  Also, uses ingredients you already have in your home - no need to rush out and buy anything special.  I made one loaf only - I think I baked approx 1 hr and 10 mins...just keep checking it.

It was very good but I changed it a little based on other reviews: added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1/2 c. white sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. milk and walnuts.  It might be better with another banana but I only added the 3 that are called for.  I also didn't have any 7x3 pans so I used (3) 6x3 loaf pans.  Have to be careful cooking because it browns quickly on the outside but the inside was undercooked.

I'll probably make this again.  I only used one loaf pan (larger than recipe size)and it worked well.  Pretty good all around; the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because there was still some left... 5 stars in my house is when it's gone.

Great recipe! I followed other readers' suggestions and added 1/2 c. white sugar/ 1/2 c. brown sugar as well as 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 c. walnuts. Will add golden raisins next time. I was not a fan of banana bread before this recipe, but now I look forward to making my next loaf!:))

This recipe was by far the best banana bread recipe i've found yet.  i've been trying to make "good" banana bread for quite a while now and have finally done it!! i used 12 apple bananas, 2 tbsp.vanilla, baking soda instead of powder, lots of cinnamon and added walnuts and 1 more cup of sugar.  Awesome - moist and yummy.  thanks nikki

I'm trying this recipe for the first time and my coworkers are going to be the first guinea pigs but this recipe sounds YUMMY.  I haven't eaten a slice yet, it's still in the oven baking.

Like others I added a few of my favorite ingredients:  freshly ground nutmeg, almond extract and instant vanilla pudding mix...  My co-workers will LOVE this.

Great recipe! This is by far the best banana bread that I have ever made. Next time I will use 1 pan.

These were really yummy.  I used four large bananas instead of the three stated in the recipe.  The loaves turned out really moist and sweet, just the way I like them.  Everyone at work liked them too!

This was my first attempt at baking banana bread and i thought that it tasted amazing! i followed peoples suggestions however and did add a tablespoon of vanila, and topped one of the loaves with a cinammon/sugar mixture. I did find that the loaves were small, the next time i make it i'll put all the batter into one pan. Otherwise, and excellent recipie!

I used a large bread pan.  I put half the batter in the pan and added cocoa powder to the rest and swirled it in.  Delicious!

I made mini banana muffins with this recipe and they were delicious.  I used 5 bananas and added 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I only had to bake each batch for about 15 minutes.  Since I used dark coated pans, I decreased the oven temp to 325 degrees.  Easy..Easy..to make! This recipe is a keeper!!

Great basic recipe for banana bread. You will have a nice soft break with more of a cake consistency. Like the others who reviewed this bread I did add a few extra things for punch. Cinnamon, vanilla and baking powder. My secret ingredient to awesome banana bread is red hot candies! They bake soft and compliment the banana wonderfully! Just stir them into the batter before putting in the pan. I gave it 4 stars because it said it would make 2 loaves but they are pretty skinny- next time I will either double the recipe for 2 nice sized loaves or just put the batter all into one pan.

Based on the other suggestions, I used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and added a little vanilla and some chocolate chips.  I did NOT, however, put the mix in one loaf tin like some folks suggested and I wish I had.  Good, solid, simple recipe.  We enjoyed it even if the slices where very small.

I'm always on the lookout for a better recipe then I have already. I like this recipe, it was easy and tasty. I got one large loaf out of it because I wasn't sharing lol. I would say it was just a little bit dry. 
Definetly NOT heavy like the last loaf I tried! I didn't think the last loaf I made was heavy till I tried this one!
I added a touch of cinnamon and 2T vanilla. I also added a little oatmeal on top because I like the way it looks. A+

I made this for the first time about a week ago and it turned out great.  I was surprised by how easy it was to make too.  I added an extra banana or two just for added flavor and walnuts and it was perfect.  Will make again!

pretty good. i added 1/2 tsp. cinammon and vanilla with half cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar, and 4 bananas. also followed another reader by topping the bread with 2tbs melted butter, 2tbs brown sugar, dash of cinammon, and some pecans before baking. the bread was a little sweet for me but overall had good banana flavor and good texture.

Tis is a very versatile recipe. I only had 2 small bananas so i decided to add some chopped strawberries and chocolate chips to the recipe. I omitted one egg and added a single serving applesauce to the mix.  I made muffins instead of a loaf and they turned out delicious.  I will make these again for sure as it is a great way for my kids to get some extra fruit into thier diet.

This Recipe was pretty good, though I have had better. Instead of nuts I added Chocolate chips for a special extra. I also added a tad of brown sugar, it seemed to turn out good. Next time I make this Banana Bread I will use the nuts to see if it is any better. But all around, it was one of the better breads I have tried from this website!

This was the first time I had ever mad Banana bread and it was a hit!  Turned out Great!!  I did the exact recipe except I added butter on top of bread after it was done baking.  Also to keep it really moist I wrapped it in foil when it was still somewhat warm.  Strongly recommend recipe!  Great one for beginners!

This recipe is great! I made a few small changes...used 2/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar and also added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning for added flavor. I baked it in a heart shaped dish for Valentine's Day and it was baked through in less than 30 minutes. Instant gratification...absolutely perfect!

Pretty good. A little too sweet for my taste.  I'll cut back on the sugar or add more banana next time.  The bananas I had were pretty small, maybe that was the problem.

A simple and easy banana bread- I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  Very moist on the inside with a crunchy crust.  I cooked it as one loaf for 45min, an hour would have dried it out for sure.  A good basic recipe that lends itself to additions.

The bread seemed really sweet so next time I might half with brown sugar to tone down the sweetness. It came out semi tough for some reason...over all I did not prefer this recipe.

This recipe was easy, but very delicious.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and threw in 1/2 cup chocolate chips.   Wonderful!   I could have eaten the entire loaf myself.

This is by far the best banana bread I've ever made! I put 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar and some chopped walnuts and it's delicious. The only problem with this bread is that it's already gone and I just made it last night!

This Banana bread is perfect!! I don't like "airy" type banana bread, I like a good old fashion type that doesn't really rise, and this is it. Very moist and delicious!! Husband loves it! I took advice from other reviews and added cinnamon, also added walnuts and used 1/2 brown sure, 1/2 white.. it turned out great, thank you!!

A really easy and tasty recipe. Go for 4 bananas and 1 small pinch of cinnamon for bolder taste. I also cut the sugar in half since I don't like my bread too sweet.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious. I made it about a week ago.  I read through all the reviews and took everyones advice.  I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, walnuts, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, 2/3 cups of sugar and four bananas. It was sweet enough with just the 2/3 cups of sugar.  Plus I used the one 9 x 13 pan and baked it for 70 minutes.  Also I used Promise instead of full fat butter.

This recipe was given to my son as a math project outcome, and part of the project was to make it.  It was very delicious, but I did use 1/2 brown sugar for this, and it made it very rich!  You can also substitute baby food bananas for the mashed fresh banana.

Yummy! Except I substituted the flour with whole wheat, almond flour and coconut flour. It’s even better. I also added cacao powder along w some nuts.

I often used the other recipe with sour cream added (from Allrecipes) but honestly I cannot tell the difference. I used 1/2 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar, added 1 t vanilla and 1/2 C chopped walnuts. This is super easy recipe with simple pantry ingredients.

A little sweet for me, but otherwise will be making this again. I also sliced the bananas on the top as in the picture, but wish I didn't because they were a bit slimy after baking and just looked unappetizing. Thanks!

I used the recipe exactly as it reads and made mini loaf pans of bread. I did decide to add about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and it turned out amazing!!! My favorite part was taking half the batch of mini loads and dropping chopped caramel bits and that was just delicious and I had many compliments on both! Will keep using this recipe for sure!!

This recipe is a great way to use bananas and the hint about the bananas turning as brown as you can stand it was the best. Mine were brown in middle and it was some of th best banana bread  I've ever had.

Thank you for such a simple yet yummy recipe! Followed instructions but add a half cup walnuts, 1 tsp vanilla extract, a little cinnamon and nutmeg. I used a pan with 8 2”x4” indents, can only fill 7 of them, baked for 40min and all came out great!

I’ve been using this recipe for years, and it is the best!  Doubling the recipe gives you three nice, big loaves, or 4 smaller loaves.  Instead of flouring my pans though, I use either cinnamon and sugar or cardamom and sugar.  I also sprinkle some of this on the top of the batter before baking.  This gives the bread the most delicious sugary ‘crust’ on the outside and makes the bread stay SO MOIST - even after freezing!  Everyone I gift it to says it’s the best bread they’ve ever had.

Love this recipe.  I’ve used it over & over.  I follow everything exactly, with pecans.  Sometimes I add some pure maple syrup.  Either way, it’s delicious!

I will probably make it again but I do see why you need to use a bread pan. My banana bread didn’t turn out nearly as good as I would’ve hoped for.

Loved it! Added cinnamon and nutmeg to mine. Next time may cut out some of the sugar.

My whole family loves this banana bread. I’ve started making two just to make it last longer than a day. In addition to the recipe, the tips added in the comments are vital! Instead of cinnamon, I use cinnamon sugar. Just a teaspoon. Yummy!!!

Not bad at all but wow, the sugar in it. Next time I will cut it in half. It does need some tweaking to it so I didn't give it 5 stars. But it was moist and easy to make with basics in the house.

I started with the original recipe and tried one of the comments as well adding 2 bananas, 1t Cinnamon and 1t vanilla, extra 1/2 cup flour and 1t baking soda. Personally, I made one with no nuts and one with about a 1/2 cup walnuts; both YUM.

No changes.  I've made 4 batches in the last 2 days and there gotten into before I can even get a picture.  Personally I would prefer a stronger banana flavor.

I added a few semi sweet chocolate chips so that my kids will eat.  I added cinnamon & vanilla as others suggested. I baked mine in muffin tins for about 30 mins in my convection oven. They’re delicious!

This didn’t turn out well at all. The mix seemed overly dry after following the instructions so added a bit more butter. But it didn’t rise.

Easy to put together. Simple ingredients. I did add a dash of almond extract. BUT.....the bottom cooked way too much (the inside was still gooey) and it was slightly burned. My husband put a piece in his mouth and immediately spit it out cause it was burnt. The inside had a great flavor though !!!

Very reliable recipe for some good banana bread! like most, I modified it, adding 1tsp vanilla extract, 1tsp cinnamon, and 1/4c pecans. I'm planning on subbing some of the sugar for brown sugar next time also. Has anyone here had succes in adding some milk/cream? I want to soon, but I'm afraid of messing with the ratios too much. Thanks!

Great!

Cooking time of 1hr is perfect for a standard single bread pan.

Oil can be subbed for butter for lower fat content.

Light and airy.  The bannana flavor is subtle, maybe next time I'll add walnuts. Overall very nice loaf of bread.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe. Only four stars, because I believe it needs changes to make it flavorful enough. I add about a tsp. of cinnamon and a tsp. of vanilla extract like others have advised. I also add chocolate chips and make the batter into muffins, simply because that's how I prefer banana bread, but with the addition of cinnamon and vanilla extract it makes a very traditional and tasty banana bread.

This is some of  the best banana bread I've ever had. Like others, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I also added a fourth banana. Super yummy. Strong banana flavour and comes out moist, which I like. I’ve tried other recipes and they come out too dry. I came back to this recipe as I haven’t found one that beats it.

Added 1 tsp vanilla extract and about 1/2-1 tsp cinnamon. Also added an extra banana cause I had 4 extra ripe and didn’t want it to go to waste. The rest of the recipe was followed exactly. I did bake for 40 min then lowered to 250 and baked another 20 covered w foil per another reviewer. Perfect and my family loved it. They were literally stalking the oven!!!  Will make again.

Great recipe. I added nutmeg and vanilla as others suggested. I made one loaf and 12 large muffins from the batter. I used overripe bananas I had saved in the freezer. I will use this recipe again, no doubt!

I like a little more banana flavour so I used 5 bananas. To make up for the moisture, I used an extra 1/2 C of flour and a 1tsp of baking powder. I also added in 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of vanilla for flavour. Cooked to perfection in 45 minutes! Great recipe overall!

This recipe says it makes 2 loaf pans, didn't even make one. Easy recipe but you'll have to double and triple the recipe to make it worth the effort. The batter barely filled the bottom of the pans.

Very good!! I added walnuts, and only cooked for 45 min, any longer and I think it would have been ruined. Will make again! My family ate a whole loaf before they were even completely cooled!

Just made this recipe and followed to the T. Really yummy. Bread came out moist. Some MIGHT find it on the sweet side depending on how ripe your bananas are: you can decrease amount of sugar. Baked in a 4x8 at 350 for 34 min. Will definitely keep this as my go to when I’ve got bananas that are too far gone to eat but still yummy to bake.

This is the first Banana Bread I’ve made from scratch as I usually pick up the box mix generally located in the produce section next to the bananas. Needless to say, tonight I had the taste for Banana Bread with no mix on hand. So, I tried this recipe and like many of the comments, I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I’m giving this recipe a 5 star because that’s what I believe the basic recipe is. Altering the recipe to suit my tastebuds should not take away stars from the original recipe. Not only was this recipe easy to make, it also tastes (much) better than the box mix. Thanks for sharing.

I will make this recipe again. I mixed it for a long time and it turned out really moist. The changes I made were that I used 4 bananas instead of 3, and that I added about 3/4 of a cup of chocolate chips to the batter. Another really yummy addition is 3/4 of a cup of blueberries.

Great turnout. I did make the modifications as per other reviews which were adding baking powder, half brown sugar, and cinnamon. I also added chopped walnuts. 
Next time I'll cut down on the sugar some more.

I made this with a few alterations. I used 5 bananas and added 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg and 2 tsp ground cinnamon. I also poured 1/2 the batter in, put a layer of light brown sugar then poured the rest of the batter on top. It gives it just a hint of candied caramel flavor which compliments the banana flavor remarkably!!

Delicious! I put only 1/2 cup total of sugar, and half of that, I used brown sugar instead. Bread was moist and just sweet enough. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. Now I can’t wait for our bananas to turn brown!

I read the reviews on here and I added another banana and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Reduced the baking time to 45 minutes as well. My boyfriend who doesn’t like bananas just had two slices and loved it! Awesome recipe and easy to make too!

Excellent! I have had such trouble with banana bread, but this one worked well. I made this both with 4 bananas and with 3, and I prefer the three. I've also done the half white/half brown, but found I like using all cane sugar, but only 3/4 cup.  I only use one egg, and add 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla. I sometimes use melted coconut oil instead of butter to make it lactose-free. I also sometimes substitute 1/4 cup white whole wheat flour in the recipe for regular flour. I may try increasing the amount of white whole wheat. Right now, it's undetectable. Thank you!

Delightful!  Easy and fast.  I added additional spices as recommended in other reviews and baked them in mini muffin tins for my 3 yo toddler who is currently obsessed with “cake”.  She is delighted when I let her have cake for breakfast ; )

I made a few changes.  I only had 2 bananas so I halved the recipe.  I added 1/8 tsp of vanilla and 1/8 tsp of baking powder.  I also substituted 1/2 the sugar for brown.  Cooking time was about 35 to 40 minutes.  Delish!

I made 12 full muffins from this recipe. I also added 1/2 t baking powder, split the sugar into half brown and used canola oil in place of the butter. We don't care for nuts so I substitute chocolate chips, 1/2 cup. They turned out great!!

Excellent!  This is the best banana bread I’ve had. I only substituted half & half for the buttermilk because I didn’t have any.  I did take someone’s suggestion and used half white sugar and half light brown sugar. I also added a pinch of cinnamon. I don’t understand the person that said theirs didn’t rise and was dry. Mine rose perfectly and was the most moist banana bread I have ever made. I’m thinking they didn’t sift the dry ingredients like the recipe called for.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I followed everyone’s recommendations and added baking powder, cinnamon and vanilla extract. Accidentally used a bit of almond extract as well but it didn’t seem to affect the taste as much. As a note: If you use a 7x5 pan instead of a 7x3, then this recipe will only fill one pan.

Great recipe. I followed other reviews and substituted apple sauce for half of the butter and used five bananas along with half of the sugar. I baked a 9x5 loaf pan at 350 for 40 minutes then at 250 for 20 minutes with a foil tent. I also added chocolate chips. The end result is a perfectly moist and just sweet enough dessert or treat.

Very good once I listened to other reviews and added cinnamon and vanilla. I also did one cup wheat flour and 1/2 c white. Only added 3/4 c of sugar and did half brown half white. I subbed apple sauce for butter cuz I’m on a strict gallbladder diet. Only have a bigger bread pan (maybe 8x4?) so I just made one loaf and it was perfect at 48 minutes. I know I made a lot of changes but this is a great starter recipe!

Hello! I loved it. Similar to other users I added 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t baking powder, and 1 t  vanilla. I had never used cinnamon in banana bread before, and it added a very nice flavor. I also added an extra banana, and used a mini loaf tray, which created 8 loaves, and took only 30 minutes to bake

added cinnamon and split sugar between brown and white -- added walnuts and might add some dried cranberry or raisins next time.    Excellent while warm :-)

This was an okay recipe for banana bread. I was in such a rush to make it that I forgot to read the suggestions below (my fault). I will try again in the future with some of those suggestions--especially regarding cinnamon and vanilla extract. Overall, I thought it was a moist, dense cake.

Definitely the best banana bread I've ever made. The consistency was perfect (not too doughy and not overdone and dry), and the flavor is delicious! I added an extra banana and a tsp of vanilla. I will continue to make it again and again!

The first bread I made came out too thin so it was a little over cooked but still good. This time around I aded about a teaspoon or so of vanilla to help cut some of the banana flavor and I think it made it even better!

Followed recipe to the T...quite bland. Did not rise. May try again and try with some of the suggested changes and only use one pan. Also may use 3 large bananas, mine were more of a medium.

This is pretty bad.  Please find another recipe.   It simply does not taste like anything.  If you think this is good, you have never had a mom or grandma make the good banana bread for you.  Unfortunately, no one in my family who made the good stuff  wrote the recipe down.  This is disappointing and I will keep looking.

I did 4 bananas instead of 3. I did 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Added a splash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Also 1/2 tsp of baking powder too. Took 40 minutes to make 2 loaves. It is SO good! Best recipe hands down.

I used whole wheat flour and I think that’s why it turned out as dark as it did. We also added crushed almonds, pecans, and cashews. It was delicious!

I also made changes to the recipe by adding 1 tsp cinnamon, 1tsp vanilla extract, 1 cup walnuts, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp ground flax meal, even poppy seeds!

This is the type of foundation banana bread recipe that you can play with and add flavors you like to enhance and change it up a bit!

I did as Cole Webster recommended;  I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract. 

However, I used 1.5 c. of whole wheat flour and split the sugar in to 1/2 c. of stevia and brown sugar.

Instead of making banana bread I made muffins! This recipe made 12 muffins. Cook for 28 minutes at 350. The total time is 43 minutes. My name is Spencer and this grandma's account.  I am eleven and it was pretty easy to make C: . I really liked the recipe, and will make again! :D

Such an easy recipe and such a good outcome. I did not have an issue with the baking time, unlike the zucchini bread I made a couple weeks back that had to go back in the oven numerous times. Only complaint is that I was under the impression it made two loaves I only got one good size loaf. Does not take away from the rating though as I can change the amount for next time.

So good! And easy! I didn't have the loaf pans that the recipe used so I just used my mini loaf pan that makes 8 small loaves. Cooked at 350' for 25 minutes and they were perfect!

This is the second time I've made this and it's delicious as written. I did add 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, plus split the sugar between white sugar and brown sugar the second time I made it and it is a bit more flavorful that way. My only mistake the second time was I didn't mash the bananas well enough causing the bread to not hold together as well when I dumped it out of the pan.

I added a dash of vanilla which I think goes nicely. I greased the sides of the pan a bit too much, but otherwise, it turned out well! I will definitely be making this again!

I’m pretty sure I did something wrong. It was not fluffy at all, it was thick chewy in the middle. Maybe I’ll try less bananas next time.

First time ever making banana bread not from a box. I followed the comments and added the adjustments of more banana, cinnamon, flour and baking powder it came out delicious! I didn’t have any loaf pans so I used six mini spring form pans and it cooked in 45 minutes at 350.

I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, just to amp up the flavor a bit. Next time I definitely won't split the mix into two pans, because my loaves were super short. Everyone loved it anyway!

This is a great recipe, the only substitutions was using Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, whole wheat flour, brown sugar and slivered almonds because I didn't have walnuts. The whole family loves it!

This is a very quick, and easy recipe.  My only “complaint” is  the directions for 3 bananas.  I had two insanely large bananas and rolled the dice with them. It worked but ounces or cups would better for us chickens. It is so moist and delicious I won’t be afraid of banana bread again.  Thank you.

I used a brand new box of Baking Soda but this didn't rise much, I could have easily just used one loaf pan, it also seemed a bit over baked even even though I took it out at 40 min (at 350). I'll try a dig recipe next time. The only changes I did were to add 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t cinnamon, and an extra 1/2 t baking soda like other reviews said.

My whole family LOVED it. Super moist and delicious. I took some advice from other reviews and only cooked it for 45 minutes and it turned out perfect. It wasn’t gooey in the middle or anything, it was just soft and moist.

I make it as is and it’s perfection every time. When I’m gifting this bread I make a jar of cinnamon butter to make it a bit more special or desert like for snack w coffee or tea, but it perfect naked, or w butter, toasted for breakfast!

Delicious:  very moist, quick and easy.  I usually make a round or square "cake" with recipes like this one; did the 9" square pan this time.  I used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar.   Also threw in the last 1/3 cup of oatmeal left in the container.  After I took it out of the oven, I made a quick glaze with a last dab of maple syrup, some vanilla, and a spoonful of soft butter all mixed with 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  I'll surely make this again.

Unfortunately, I didn’t have sour cream in the fridge when I decided to make this. I replaced the sour cream with 1/2 cup of apple sauce (using the same amount of butter) and it was so moist and delicious inside and lightly crunchy on the outside. Perfection. I wanted to make it as close to the original recipe as possible, but next time I’ll try doing it Coles way with some cinnamon, which sounds amazing. Easy and delicious recipe!!

I made it the first time exactly as the recipe says and it was delicious. You can definitely add another banana for more banana flavor but it was great as is. The second time, I only added 1/2 cup of sugar and added 1/2 cup or crushed up freeze dried strawberries (cheap from Trader Joe’s). It’s not even that much less sweet but the strawberry banana comes through and is fantastic.

Well, all banana bread needs flavour from spices, so I added cinnamon and nutmeg.  But there just was not enough moisture in the recipes so I ended up adding milk to get a proper consistency.  After that, it worked and tasted great but the recipe as is does not work.

This is wonderful!! I followed a few of the other reviews and added the following...1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and and extra banana (total of 4). I only baked for about 40-45 minutes and it is done and super moist!! I will definitely be making this again and again!!

I have been baking banana bread since I first began to cook.  I only had basic ingredients on hand... Not even brown sugar or sour cream.  And while I didn't want to try a new recipe I did.  Hubby asked for blueberries in it so I added two handfuls. I had five totally shriveled bananas and used them all.  I also put some cinnamon sugar mixture on top right before baking.  I baked it in a round pan since I didn't even have a loaf pan!! Pathetic I know.  This recipie is a keeper.  Easiest and best banana bread recipe yet.

I love this recipe! I added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and some chopped walnuts.
I baked in a square pan instead of two seperate loaves. This will be my go to banana bread recipe for years to come!

This was perfect for what I needed.  I halved the recipe because we were only two and I had only one large banana.  I did add a dash of vanilla and cinnamon. Easy and very good!

I love this recipe! Simple ingredients that are always in the kitchen. So fast to mix up, throw it in the oven and BAM it’s done! Didn’t change the recipe in any way.

This banana bread is the best I've ever tasted! It's so soft and the color is beautiful. It cooked so evenly! I will definitely make this again. I followed the top review's advice and added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract, and I split the sugar into 1/2 c. of white and 1/2 c. of brown sugar. This banana bread isn't that sweet so next time I will add just a little bit more. All in all, this bread is the most fluffy and soft bread ever! For me, it cooked really evenly so I don't understand how some other reviews say that they needed to cover the bread with foil because the edges started burning. This bread comes out of the pan really easily after greasing.

Great, simple recipe! As recommended by a few reviewers, I subbed half of the sugar for brown sugar since I had it on hand.  Came out great and will use this recipe again when I have brown bananas.

Made a double batch for the second time today. Today I added vanilla while last time I added vanilla and cinnamon. They were both great. I do like to make them in muffin form because they make a better grab and go snack however loaf form is good too. I highly recommend this recipe. Enjoy!!

Tasty easy recipe. Take note that the directions call for you to use 2 SMALL loaf pans. I used 2 regular loaf pans and ended up with 2 shallow loaves that cooked quickly.

We did the recommended 3 bananas and turned out very flavorful and moist enough for us, not at all dry.  But like many others we added the 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Baking Powder, 1 tsp vanilla extract and did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  We also baked these in a muffin pan at the recipe recommended temperature but for only half the time.  Put in a toothpick to check done-ness.  My little boys ATE THEM UP, I enjoyed them as well.  I don't know much about baking and assumed the addition of baking powder was to counteract what some of the reviews mentioned on this recipe coming out too dense.

Like others suggested:

 I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract, split the sugar in to 1/2 c. of white and brown sugar, and I used 1 c. of all purpose flour with 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.

I also wanted this to be very "banana," so like other reviewers I used 5 medium-sized bananas and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp of baking powder.  The overall 2 cups of flour I split roughly 2/3 all-purpose flour and 1/3 whole wheat, and I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and instead added 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Overall, the loaves came out nicely moist and dense (not much rise to them) and I didn't mash the bananas too much, which resulted in nice small chunks of banana spread throughout.

So delicious!!  Per the suggestion of others, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also increased the number of bananas and added walnuts.  It is probably the prettiest banana bread I have ever made.

So good! I substituted the sugar with agave and the butter with coconut oil. Also used gluten free flour instead. Added vanilla extract, almond extract, walnuts, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. It turned out really moist and flavorful.

So, I FORGOT to add the butter (life gets busy) and it still turned out AMAZING!  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and some chocolate chips into the mix and my husband loved it.  I made it last night and when I got up this morning, only half the loaf remained.  I know there was more when I went to bed and I didn’t eat it. I will be using this recipe again, but I won’t forget the butter next time.

This is a great recipe for banana bread. Followed Cole's instructions that you may see on his/her review, since it is rated the most positive helpful take on this site. 

I've made this a total of 3 times. The first, I just followed the instructions along with Cole's suggestions. The second time, I added chocolate chips. The third time I added a 1/4 cup of unsweetened  cocoa powder, and ... now it's basically chocolate bread lol. You can't really taste the banana, which is slightly upsetting. 

Anyway, I'm going to keep trying variations of the recipe, but this is a winner. ALSO, you don't need to flower the pan if you have a no-stick pan. I grease the pan, but flowering it is unnecessary for me.

I love the simplicity of this recipe and it tastes amazing. Only thing is I didn’t have two loaf pans so I used a brownie pan (9x9 pan)

I've made a bunch of recipes from Allrecipes and have always loved anything rated with 4 stars or more; but this recipe is a disappointment. I made the recipe as stated and did not make any changes. However, the bread is so chewy and does not have a crunchy, thick crust you typically find with quick breads. I will not be making this recipe again. I'm not sure why it is rated so highly, maybe because many people gave it 5 stars with too many changes.

This recipe is easy and excellent! Used this as my base recipe. Just added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. baking powder and swirled a scoop of whipped cream cheese in between layers of the batter.

Turned out fantastic! I added 1 tsp Mexican Vanilla (if you don't cook with Mexican vanilla how do you even cook??) and a bit of cinnamon. I also always use very ripe bananas, borderline on throwing out kind of ripe. Make sure to mix really well, I use a kitchen aid hand mixer.

Gathering ingredients and noted no liquids, milk or water but the bread came out light and cake-like, not heavy at all. Added raisins, chocolate chips.  Will do again with pineapple, chocolate mint chips, peanut butter, apple slices. The recipe begs for all kinds of experimental additions.

Made it, LOOOOOOOOVE IT. I double the amount of butter with a teaspoon of vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon and handful of walnut. 
Love the shinning look, but this bread was delicious with few simple ingredients. 
I can way to have soft dark spot bananas in the house.

Great recipe! I added some cinnamon, and just about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips made this bread just to die for.  It only made one large loaf for me, but my pan may have been bigger. I will be making it again!

I wanted a basic recipe and found this one, it was wonderful!! I made a few changes, I used Earth Balance® instead of butter, totally forgot the second egg and I made one, not two, in a metal pan. I baked the loaf for exactly 55 minutes.  Since bananas vary in size my rule of thumb is 1 cup of bananas for 1 1/2 cups of flour. Oh, I also added a generous handful of milk chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing, I'll make this one again soon.

This is my go to recipe and I have made it numerous times. I always cut the sugar by at least half and raw sugar. I also use whole wheat flour for at least half the flour (if not all the flour), and I just bake it in one regular sized loaf pan instead of 2 mini loaves. Turns out fantastic every time.

The first time I made this I accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda - and I almost always make muffins instead of loaves. The baking powder made the muffins come out a little doughy and much denser - my boyfriend actually liked them better that way! The second time, I used baking soda and the muffins came out airy and more like banana bread :) I also added about half a teaspoon each time I made it - would highly recommend!

I made this recipe just as it was given with the exception that I added about 1 tsp of cinnamon and a hand full of chopped walnuts. Moist and delicious! It was easy and used only on hand ingredients. This will be my go to banana bread recipe going forward.

I've made this recipe three times in the past three weeks.  This is probably one of the best and easiest banana bread recipes around.  I've added chocolate chips, I've added 1 T vanilla...you can make this your own but it's wonderful just the way the recipe is written.  Don't wait!

Incorporated a lot of suggestions from other reviewers and added ground flax seed (about 1/4 cup). I also used two 5 1/2" x 9 1/2" bread pans which meant that I got half the height of normal banana bread and baked it at 350F for 30 min. with 10 min. left in the oven after it was turned off.  I think it's a good idea to do the half height approach as each piece is 1/2 the calories  :)  Regardless of the recipe, it's important to use overripe bananas so that you get that rich banana flavor.  My original recipe was from a Mrs. Campbell whose darling daughters I had the pleasure of babysitting back in the mid-1970s.  It's lost but I'm glad to have this substitute and thank you and other reviewers !

This is very easy to make. It tastes delicious. Will be making again. The only change I made is using Splenda instead of sugar.

Delicious! I used four bananas , used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 tsp of vanilla. Very moist and great crust to it. Also only used one loaf pan. Next time I'll reduce the butter and also try to cut back on the sugar!

I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1tsp of cinnamon.  I wish I added more cinnamon! Still Came out delicious. It did not take an hour in the oven.

I made this exactly as stated. I read the other reviews after making it and print it in the oven and thought, , vanilla and cinnamon would have been good in this but fear not, they're absolutely not necessary!!! this bread is SO yummy and the crust is perfection. Our cooking time was 55 minutes.

I absolutely loved this!  A few days ago our neighbor cut down his banana plant and gave us a huge bunch of bananas.  I've been looking for an easy recipe and this was it.  I did add some cinnamon and vanilla though and it came out great!  Will definitely make some again and give it to my neighbors to say thank you.

Was really good! Added mini chocolate chips (little less than 1/2 bag) for an extra yum factor. Also split into two pans that were wider  (like a 9X9 and maybe a 9X12 or so) and they baked in less than 30 minutes which was perfect to feed my "starving" roommates who were being tortured by the delicious smell!!! Yum yum!

I added some brown sugar and cinnamon to the batter, only made one loaf, got 4 large muffins from the rest of the batter. Then I made a glaze from melted butter, confectioners sugar and vanilla to top it off. Great recipe, super moist!

It turned out great; moist and easy to make.  This was my first time making banana bread, and one of the few things I have ever baked.  My only divergence from the original recipe was adding half of a teaspoon of vanilla, which was undetectable.

Quick, easy to make, and great flavor.

Delicious & moist - hubby gave 2 thumbs up!
DOUBLED THE BATCH WITH THE FOLLOWING ALTERATIONS: 
- Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar
- Added 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp baking powder, & 1 tsp vanilla extract per batch
- Added 1 cup walnut pieces to 2nd batch 
Filled two 8x4 disposable (foil) loaf pans half-way & got 2 generous-sized loaves per batch. Checked with toothpick after 30 minutes & wound-up baking another 10 min's (for a total of 40 min's - baking 2 loaves at a time) at 350 F...no adjustments made for our higher altitude (5100').

After reading reviews, I added 1/2tsp. of baking powder, 1tsp. of vanilla extract and substituted 1/2 cup of coconut sugar in place of 1/2 cup reg sugar. The bread texture was very tender and moist...great flavor too! My mixture filled one Pyrex glass loaf pan and not two as recipe stated.

Really good, and easy to make. I like to add a little coconut extract to mine, and have also tried almond extract. I've made it as both bread and muffins and it comes out amazing either way

Very easy to make and scrumptious! I didn't have a second loaf pan so I made muffins out of the other half, which baked in about 20 minutes. The loaf baked in about 30 minutes. They turned out perfectly moist.

This bread was delicious; very moist and just the right amount of sweetness!  I did follow several reviewers suggestions:  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar; I added 1 tsp of baking powder; 1/2 tsp cinnamon ( I would use more but my husband is not fond of cinnamon)); and 1/2 of a fresh vanilla bean. I poured it all into one 9x 5 loaf pan and baked for 40 minutes at  350 degrees. It competed with peach cobbler and apple crisps and was eagerly eaten up at a family dinner.

Not my favorite banana bread.  I followed the recommended change of 50% sugar/brown sugar since 1 cup of sugar for 2 small loaves is TOO MUCH for me, but the brown sugar left it tasting slightly bitter, and the dark color is unappealing to my fam.  Will look for a banana bread recipe that doesn't use quite so much sugar.

I made it just like the recipe said for the most part. I did add about 1 cup of chopped pecans (banana bread need nuts). I wish I would have read all of the comments before as the addition of vanilla and cinnamon sounds delightful. Now I just need some bananas to get overripe so I can try it again.

Wonderful recipe for basic banana bread. I had 2 overripe bananas that I wanted to use up, and this recipe was perfect. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. YUM.

Excellent!! I did add a few changes, I stirred in 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I also baked them in a muffin tin at 350 for 25 minutes. Turned out amazing. Thank you for this recipe!!

SO easy and so delicious. Rather than two small loaves I made one large-ish one. It was a little squishy in the middle still (probably should have baked it longer but I was extrapolating from another recipe, too) but absolutely DELICIOUS.

I made this for my dad yesterday and he LOVES it. Half of the loaf is already gone!! I had 5 bananas that needed to be used so I just threw them all in, doing so required about 8 extra minutes to cook through. I also added a cap of vanilla extract. Awesome recipe! Definitely a keeper!

The recipe was simple and easy enough to follow and make. Maybe a little less time in the oven, but use your criteria. Will definitely use this recipe from now on to make banana bread, I only got one loaf of bread with this recipe

I loved it, recipe went well, used Bisquick mix instead of flour and it was awesome. Baked very nicely, didn't over-rise. So filling I couldn't believe it. I love banana bread I don't know why I waited to make some myself. Nuts ruin the experience for me so it was nice to have nut free banana bread again. I'm not allergic to nuts I just dislike the texture. This recipe works!

Easy recipe! Since I don’t have two bread pans, I put most of the batter in muffin pans. Cook for about 20 mins only. The other change I made to the recipe was to add one tsp of cinnamon. Sooooo good. Wonderful banana flavor and the cinnamon adds just a jazz of fun.

This bread was so delicious. I also made a pan of muffins. I was skeptical about making it without milk or sourcream but did not need them at all. The only thing I did different was to add about 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp lemon juice. Definitely making this again.

Very yummy and the ingredients are things almost everyone would have on hand in the pantry. Love it!
I added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg as other reviewers had suggested and substituted unrefined cane sugar (because that's what we had available).
The recipe says to cook for an hour, but I'm glad I checked it at 40min. In my oven, it was done then.  Smells wonderful, tastes wonderful... definitely making again.

I think this banana bread was very fun and easy to make. I'm a mom and cooking it with my kids was very fun and very fast.

THis recipe is super simple to prep and tastes amazing! I don't even like most banana bread, but I like this one. I've never made any before today, and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this is.

I followed the recipe but did add a little cinnamon to add a kick to it. I will say that cooking it at 350 for an hour was way to much for my oven, I took it out after 35 minutes. Other than that very tasty.

I can't think of anything positive to add that hasn't already been said! Moist, perfectly sweet, and just enough banana flavor-not too much nor too little. This will be a repeat!

This recipe is great! This is the fourth time I've made it. This time around I couldn't find my baking soda so used 1 tsp baking powder instead. I also used 1 and a half tsp of ground cinnamon and made them into muffins. I then sprinkled brown sugar over the top before baking for 20 minutes. Turned out great if a little heavy/dense.

This is the most soft and fluffy banana bread we've made yet. I followed it exactly other than cutting the amount of sugar in half as I don't like things too sweet. I also added vanilla and cinnamon. delicious!

I've made this recipe several times now & my daughter asks for it any time we have bananas. It's quick & easy to put together & I love to smell it baking. Very moist & captures the taste of the banana more than other recipes I've tried. I have cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup per personal preference and the bread is done in about 45 minutes (probably my oven). Love love love

I love this recipe! I've made it several times now and it disappears fast. The only different thing I do is add 1 Tsp vanilla, and 1 Tsp cinnamon. I'd love to try this with different fruits like applesauce or something.

This is an easy, delicious recipe that doubles or even triples well. The only modification I made was to add a little vanilla. Since I was making these as gifts, I decided to frost them. I whipped a block of cream cheese, 3/4 c powdered sugar, 2 T milk, 1/2 t vanilla, and a half a banana. RAVE reviews!

I've been using this recipe for over 10 years!!! One of  the best! The melted butter is everything in this! If you want less sweet go down to 3/4 or 1/2 cup of sugar.

I made the recipe as stated.  It was so simple. Did not have small loaf pans so I baked it in a 9x5 glass dish for 50 minutes.  It turned out wonderful and it is now my go to banana bread recipe.  I might make peanut butter frosting for it next time.

I just made it, but I cut the sugar in half because I think that is too much sugar especially when you are already using overripe bananas. Overall this recipe is easy to make and it is very good. Halfway through baking I added crushed walnuts and my family loves it.

I made this bread without the butter. 
I also used a single 9" cake pan..
as others I added cinnamon 1/2 tsp i also substituted 1 1/2 tsp baking powder for the baking soda. no soda for me.

A couple days before I made the bread I took 2 pounds of fresh strawberries cleaned and cut in halves added 3/4 cup sugar to them in a bowl covered and cooled in fridge. stir the berries at least a few times.
this banana bread is so simple and is very good, maybe the best I've tasted .Add the strawberries and there juice over a piece of the bread and it is simply the best. to me and my family it's better than strawberries and short cake.
this will be my go to receipt!

This is an amazing, simple, and delicious recipe for banana bread! There is far too much sugar, so I halved it (using a white sugar brown sugar combo). I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. And another banana. You have to really mush those bananas.  It's a lot easier and sweeter with really old, bruised bananas, so try to let them sit before trying out this recipe. The cooking time is also horribly inaccurate. If u try to bake it for an hour, it will turn into a rock. It's a good thing I checked my bread constantly, or it would've burned. 40 minutes is a lot more accurate for those who would like edible bread. It is rather heavy for a banana bread though. I could only eat a slice of it before I was full. If u would like to make it lighter, add a tablespoon of milk and mix the batter an extra minute or two. But overall, a ???? recipe!

I only had 2 bananas, so I just halved the recipe and I only had a loaf pan and cooked it for 33 min.
OMG you should have smelled it when it was cooking. I followed the recipe (except halving) almost to a T. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the flour mixture and then when I added the wet ingredients I added 1 tsp of Vanilla to the mix.
I used PAM baking spray (it has flour in the spray) and cooked for 33 min.
I and hubby ate it warm and, sorry kids, nothing was left.
I was going to do what one commenter said and wrap it in Glad and the foil and put in fridge for to cool, never made it. It was soooo good, It didn`t make a big one, nothing like the picture (maybe because I used to big of a pan) but OMG it was so moist and good. It might be bread, but was better than cake, sweet and moist.
I am heading to the store later and grab a bunch of bananas and make some more, so the young ones can have some.
Sorry ,Betty, Kraft, Pillsbury, but this is the only bread I will make, ever.  
Thank you for this delicious recipe

Pretty good, I would suggest using one pan and one more banana probably. I only had one egg so I used 1/4 cup oil in addition to everyone's comments about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, bp, and vanilla. Overall not too bad!! Also my bread only stayed in for about 40 mins and it was cooked through! When it starts getting dark check it out

I changed it to 10 servings cause I only had 2 bananas and I thought it was a bit sweet. May have been because the bananas I had were very ripe. Overall very simple, easy to follow recipe. But I baked it for 45 minutes instead of an hour. Everyone liked it.

This turned out great, it was very easy! I did make the following adjustments per others reviews.

I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract, split the sugar in to 1/2 c. of white and brown sugar. I used 1/3 a cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of butter. My toddler gobbled it up!

Turned out great, I feel so behind the times. Was still using my mom's recipe. This time I said no way to shortening and hello to butter. Love it! Came out moist and beautiful. P. S. Immediately updated her recipe box.

This was a fantastically delicious and simple recipe. I'm typically not the biggest fan of baking - but this was super easy... and definitely a crowd-pleaser. 

I followed the recipe exactly, but added blueberries and chia seeds to one of the loaves... took it out of the oven after about 50 minutes. It turned out perfectly.

It was ok but a little bland.  The texture was good.  I wondered how it had so many rave reviews, but I now see that many people are altering the recipe and adding vanilla and cinnamon, which I'm sure would help, and I will definitely make some changes next time.  I made the recipe as it was written (and added walnuts to one loaf.)

I had all the ingredients except for baking soda so I substituted with two teaspoons of baking powder. I added chopped walnuts for some crunch. I decided to make muffins instead of a loaf and baked the muffins on 350 for 20-25 minutes. Husband loved it

I made this bread today and it's fantastic!! I did add 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of Vanilla extract, and orange zest...  I have a convection oven, and was ready in 35 minutes, whereas the last 5 minutes were at 300 F.  Very moist, not too sweet, just perfect

Loved this recipe. I made everything exactly as is called for but I did add brown sugar and cinnamon on top to give it an extra somethings and I'm glad I did. It was like a cinnamon crumble cake but you could still taste the banana which was amazing.  Definitely will be making this again.

I am not sure about the size of my glass pyrex, but is around 8x5. The first time I tried this recipe I baked it for 1hr and it came out a bit dry, the second time I checked it at 45 min and it was perfect. I added 1tsp of vanilla and 1tsp of cinammon and also did half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. I love it!

This recipe turned out so fluffy! I used two large ripe bananas, added cinnamon and maple AND vanilla extract. I used walnuts and made a dozen muffins instead of loaves. Same temp and pan prep bake 20-22 minutes

No need to change this recipe. I will add a cup of walnuts or other nuts such as pecans or a mix of pecans and walnuts occasionally . This is the go to banana bread recipe, because results are consistently excellent. I have baked this bread with this recipe approximately 75-100 times.

I tried three other popular recipes on this website and this one is the best! I used 4 medium bananas, a dash of cinnamon, and added 1/4 cup more of butter - awesome! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is definitely the best and easiest one I've used. I added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla paste.Baked mines for only 45 mins. Turned out great! The only issue I had was that it didn't rise as much as I would've wanted it to. But I think that might have been because my pans were a little larger than 7x3 so it was more spread out. Still tasted great though

I never realize how easy to make a really good banana bread and it tasted so good! I already made this twice. Like other reviewers said, I added vanilla extract, cinnamon powder, baking powder and did half and half for brown and white sugar. I also added chopped walnuts because I have them and like the crunch in this really soft bread. I will bake this over and over.

Great recipe. It's super easy! all I did was add a teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and an extra banana. My daughter loves bananas so much, so this is perfect. This will be my 6th time making it!

Absolutely love this recipe! The only thing I change is I sprinkle brown sugar on the top and add a splash of vanilla extract. For muffins I bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.

The best banana bread recipe! I only changed sugar to half brown and I added vanilla and cinnamon like others have said. However I also added almond extract, because I love the smell, and my kids and husband are obsessed with it! Also, I live at 5500 feet, and no change for altitude necessary!

I added 1tsp of vanilla, 1tsp of cinnamon, and used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. I made it in a single regular size loaf pan. It's delicious! Definitely a keeper.

I had to use this recipe because it was one of the only ones for which I had all of the ingredients, & I assumed it would be plain and boring.  It is SOOO GOOD!  Two of my kids and I demolished it--my husband and son are going to be disappointed when they get home, haha!  Delicious & easy & perfect.

Texture was good, flavor was ok.  Over all a good basic recipe for  a fast ban. bread. esp. with kids.  Not the moistest or most flavorful I have made.  I added 1tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  It cracked and collapsed in center while cooling...not sure why. Maybe my mixing method?  I bake a lot at home for my family.  Certainly better than any store made product that has strange or artificial ingredients. Will try to toast it and serve with a pat of butter for breakfast.  Good texture for firm even slices.

This has become my go to recipe for banana bread!  The only thing I've changed is using egg substitutes (flax seed/applesauce) when I've run out of eggs. It always comes out moist and delicious, definately a favorite!

Oh my gosh, I BLEW my boyfriend away with this recipe! He still doesn't believe me when I tell him that it was my first time making Banana Bread!

I added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also made it in a 9 x 5.

This bread is so moist and tasty. I had no trouble with over cooking ( I took it out 5 minutes early, my toothpick was clean!). 

I will be making more of this, so delicious!

Easy recipe with great results.  Took advice of others and added cinnamon and vanilla and used baking powder instead of baking soda.

I love how simple this recipe is!! Honestly, the hardest part about making it was smelling the deliciousness in the oven and having to wait for the baking to be completed. I added some cinnamon, vanilla extract (didn't measure just guessed) and chocolate chips. I don't own two loaf pans so, I used a bunt cake pan and poured all the batter into there. It was finished in around 40-45 min. I'm in love with the recipe and have made it twice in one week!

I happened to have four bananas that were about to turn, so I used all of them, and baked in 4x8 inch glass pans at 325 degrees. The loaves were moist and delicious.

my first time making banana bread, I made muffins ...wow it is way better than the local bakery bought bread I buy for almost $7 a loaf. like everyone else I also added 1 extra banana, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t baking powder, 1 t vanilla extract and split the sugar 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Can't wait for my children to get out of school so they can try them.

When I divided the batter in to the 2 pans as it says  I ended up with 2 loaves only about 2 inches high.  It baked up in about 40 minutes rather than the 50.  Then I made a second batch but instead I used left over squash and added Pumpkin Pie seasoning mix.  From that batch I got 1 loaf and 8 muffins.  All in  all it makes a great base for other quick breads and muffins.

simple and effective. I didn't have nuts (even though I wanted them) so I used toffee chips and chocolate chips as well.

I added 1/2 tsp of Ceylon cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract because other reviews advised it's a bit bland, but I would recommend adding a little less cinnamon, as that flavor somewhat overpowered the banana. And I think my mom's banana bread wasn't quite this sweet so I think next time I'll add a little less sugar. Otherwise, pretty tasty!

This is the easiest recipe I've found for making banana bread. The last time I decided to make both a loaf and muffins (muffins only needed to be in for about 20 minutes) and they turned out great. My 1 1/2 year old has been begging me daily to make more "nena bread" (it only lasts about a day at our house, two max).  I do sometimes add some cinnamon or other spices depending on my mood but they are not necessary.

This recipe used to be named Banana bread 1. I love this banana bread recipe with modifications suggested by other reviewers (add 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, sometimes 1 tsp cinnamon, delicious with chocolate chips added). I did not care for the addition of nutmeg that some reviewers suggested. 
I usually double the recipe and use 6 frozen ripe bananas, which makes 2 loaves.   I have made this bread many times, always turns out delicious.

I have used this recipe many times. My friends and family seem to like it better in the "doughnut" form. It is light and fluffy. Great with my morning coffee. And more than once I have used it as a "to go" breakfast option.

This is a tasty, easy banana bread! Very fast to prepare!

Due to the ingredients I had on hand, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c., replaced the egg with 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt, and the butter with 1/4 c. vegetable oil and 2 T. half-and-half. I also added in cinnamon, vanilla, and mini-chocolate chips. It turned out very well, but very sweet. The next time I make the recipe with chocolate chips I will probably only use only 1/2 c. sugar.

Excellent recipe!  Before making this recipe I read through several of the reviews and used some of the suggestions,  which included a teaspoon of cinnamon 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. To reduce calories I used  a half cup of sugar instead of a cup. I  used 5 bananas instead of 3 and 2 cups whole wheat white flour. For a butter substitute, I used earth bound buttery olive oil spread.  The banana bread turned out great and the entire family enjoyed it.

as far as flavor wise this recipe is amazing but as far as the texture, it wasn't good. it was cooked on the outside but still raw on the inside. I don't know if it was something about my oven or just the recipe. maybe I'll try it again but at a different temperature

made all of the changes (added vanilla, cinnamon, brown and white sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose) and tried 2 pans. The loaf pans I have are bigger so they were pretty flat. It is enough for 1 bigger loaf pan.

Texture and taste are great. I made two recipes the one I didn't add baking powder the other I did. Baking powder made it rise a lot better. I also added cinnamon.

This has easy to obtain and have on hand ingredients. I do double the bananas, mostly because I have too many bananas in my freezer, and I haven't baked it as long. Overall, though, it's been tasty, moist, and easy to make.

Moist and delish! If you're using very ripe bananas you can reduce the sugar quite a bit. Next time I have bananas that are going bad, I'll make this using half the sugar or less.

This was sooo good. I will make this again. Thanks to everyone's advice, I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, cinnamon and 1tsp of vanilla. I also made sure to put foil on half way through the baking time. The bread was so moist and good.

Added a handful of chopped walnuts and diced apple. Changed the sugar to brown and just 2 tbsp. Good simple recipe but not much depth. Will try again and incorporate yogurt or sour cream somehow.

This recipe is super simple which worked out really great! It made it flexible so I could add things to it as I wanted. I added Molasses and allspice as well as walnuts. I also made a batch sugarfree for my dad and I followed the recipe to the T for a friend who has a child with food allergies. Each time it turned out moist and flavorful.

Excellent. Simple recipe.I love recipes that don't have a whole bunch of ingredients. This was so fast and easy to make. I made it last night and added a handful of oats, some cinnamon and vanilla. Sometimes I replace some of the flour with whole wheat, add some dried cranberries.... and/or shredded coconut.... or replace the butter with coconut oil... this is a great basic recipe. It tastes yummy!

After several attempts and various banana bread recipes, this is my favorite recipe by far. My changes:  4 bananas instead of 3, vanilla, cinnamon, and chopped walnuts.  If you're like me and only have a large pan (meatloaf size around 4x9), I've found the following baking process to work well for evenly baked, moist, not-burned bread:  350 with the rack one step down from the middle for 50 min, move the rack to the middle & cover the bread with foil (I spray the foil with Pam to prevent possible sticking from the bread), and cook on the middle rack for an additional 35 minutes.  This took many loaves to come up with this perfect solution!

This was some great banana bread.  Very heavy, dense and moist, and I like it that way!  We had three bananas that were getting very black and really on their way out the door, as opposed to just yellow or spotted...and that helped contribute a lot of moisture and sweetness to the bread.  

What's also nice about this is that it doesn't make a huge quantity of bread, it was just enough for my mother and myself to eat over maybe two or three days.  The only things I did differently was butter up a ten inch cast iron skillet and put it in there, and used brown sugar instead of  white...it came out wonderfully!!!  Will keep this recipe handy.

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever used! I did add a teaspoon of baking powder, two teaspoons of cinnamon, and a teaspoon and a half of vanilla; Other than those ingredients, I followed the procedure set forth by the recipe. I also didn't have any bread pans available so I used muffin pans instead. I made 14 muffins and the bake time was cut down to 13 minutes.

I made this recipe last night and I did as many others and used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla, as well as 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I only had self-rising flour in the cupboard so I used it and nixed the baking soda and salt. I baked the mixture into 12 muffins at 350 for approximately 27 minutes. They turned out amazing!

I used some of the suggestions of others (adding baking powder, cinnamon, and half brown sugar/half white). Everyone loved it and is excited to eat it again on Christmas. The inside is slightly mushy but that's just how I like it.

SUPER easy, very moist & tasty!!! I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of ground cinnamon. However, mine didn't rise AT ALL - was maybe 1/2" thick??!!  Next time I will double this recipe for 2 OR use this recipe to make 1 loaf..........

3/6/2014:  Just made it again with the recipe as is making one loaf.  Still didn't rise a much so maybe adding more flour will help.  I have posted a picture of it this time.  :o]

Nice and simple, but needs a few things.  The batter is too thick.  Also, it only makes one loaf, not two.
Add at least one extra banana or use extremely large bananas.  To help make the batter a bit more moist, freeze the bananas first (in the peel) then slip them out of their peels just before they're fully thawed.  Let them sit covered in a bowl or tupperware in the fridge for a day - you'll get lots of liquid around the bananas that really moisten up the batter.  Also add a teaspoon of vanilla and an extra 2 teaspoons of melted better.

The recipe was great, but 1 hour is too long to leave it in the oven & like others suggested 1 tsp of baking powder would have been a great addition as it didn't seem to rise much.

Very tasty. Altough I didn't have the right size pan and over cook it a little. If I hadn't I would have given this a 5 star.

This banana bread is delicious! I highly recommend it. The only change I made was I substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar. I also used one large banana and two small and the consistency of the batter was perfect. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Great recipe!  SO quick & easy to make.  This will be a quick go to recipe for bananna bread!  As other suggested, I added some cinnamon & some vanilla extract and it came out wonderfully.  I baked 1 loaf for 1 hour in a metal pan and it was cooked perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper.

I had 2 very ripe leftover bananas, so I cut the original recipe in 1/2 with no other changes and it turned out so moist and delicious! I even baked it in my toaster oven so I wouldn't have to heat the whole kitchen this time of year...will definitely use this recipe all the time! Thanks!

Just made this last night along with a batch of the Banana crumb Muffins from this site, I had a lot of over ripe bananas that I did not want to through out. This is a great basic recipe, I did make some changes as suggested by other reviewers, I added 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp. Vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup of nuts and 1/3 cup of chocolate chips and lastly I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also sprinkled the top with more chopped nuts just before I put in the oven. The result a very beautiful moist banana bread with just the right hint of chocolate. Great with coffee this morning!!

This recipe is great. I used some of the suggestions and added 1/2c flour, 1 banana, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2c semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also used 1 tsp. baking soda and I tsp. baking powder and it rose perfectly! I made 20 muffins, cooking time was 25 minutes.  I will definitely use again.  Great banana taste.

Loved the recipe. I only used two bananas (because that's all that I had) and I threw in some brown sugar and some cinnamon. This resulted in only one loaf of banana bread.

Pretty good.....thick batter, wish it was a little more banana-y tasting... (I had only 3 over ripe ones on hand). Nice color and texture though after cooking. Thanks.

Made this today - first time making banana bread and it came out great. I used some tips from other reviewers (thanks!).  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, added about 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup of choclate chunks, and used 4 bananas.  Came out moist and on the dense side - very yummy!  thanks!!

the recipie is simple and easy to follow. i made this with my not-so-attentive boyfriend and it turned out great! we ate a whole loaf right out of the oven! i did cover the pans with tinfoil half way through the cooking time and i took them out 10minutes early. they would have burned otherwise. ive made bread in these pans once before and there was no way to get the bread out in tact and it was awful scrubbing the crust off the sides. this time i used "PAM with flour for baking" and there was the perfect degree of bread/pan seperation. the bread fell right out, no mess

I make a LOT of banana bread and I've tried lots of recipes - and this is the one that continually works and is the best.  However, I find that adding Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate chips makes it... better than semisweet or milk chocolate chips.

Good, but I substituted brown sugar because I like the flavor better.  I found that if I substituted all the white sugar for brown, the cooking time was less than if I substituted 1/3 of the sugar for brown.  A good solid recipe for banana bread.

I made this exactly as the recipes states with a couple exceptions...I used 4 bananas, cinnamon, vanilla, and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, just as others suggested. I made 2 loaves like the recipes states and they came out VERY thin! Not even 2 inches tall. The batter didn't even fill 1/4 of each loaf pan. The taste is ok, but I will not make again.

This is a great recipe! I halved it because I didn't have two pans and my oven is very small.  It seemed to take a lot less baking time than the recipe called for, too.  I added walnuts and it was absolutely great!  I can't wait to make it again.

My 5 year old daughter made this recipe for her grandmothers for Christmas.  Even she said "Wow!  This is simple."  It was delicious too.  I did increase the recipe to 4 bananas though.

This was a GREAT recipe! It turned out delicious and had wonderful banana flavour! I used baking powder instead of soda though. Overall, this recipe is fantastic! However, it turned more "cake" like than bread! But it tasted really good. Everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

Very boring, plain. The plus is that it was easy to make & didn't call for alot of ingredients. I would not make it again.

Easy to make and fast to bake!  Uses ingredients that you already have in the pantry, and you don't have to buy special for the recipe!  Mmmmmmmmm!

I just make mine in one larger bread pan.  Great banana bread!  Try adding walnuts or chocolate chips, you won't be disappointed.  It makes your house smell so good!

This recipe was very good and turned out great.  I substituted half Splenda, half sugar instead of 1 cup of sugar. It wasn't noticable. I also added a half cup of walnuts. Very good and simple recipe.

My first attempt at banana bread, and I'm imressed!  The recipe filled one 9x5 pan quite nicely.

I used half brown sugar as others did.  Next time I will try  substituting some applesauce in place of butter as others recomended to make it even healthier!

This was delicious! It was my very first banana bread and it was so fast & easy! With my oven it only had to be in there for 40 mins. I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, other than that i followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing Nikki!

My first attempt at banana bread was successful thanks to this basic recipe. I  followed it exactly and added nuts and a splash of vanilla. I used foil pans and it took about 50 minutes. Yummy!

Great tasting banana bread.  I didn't like that the bread didn't rise much, i think next time I will just make one large loaf.  I did have a few problems with the recipe. Because I cooked the two loaves seperately, the first was over cooked at the full hour.  I cooked the second one for 25 minutes and it turned out really nice.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg, it made it very tasty. =)

I really liked this I made this vegan by using Nucoa margerine and EnerG Egg replacer and no one even noticed. I left it on the stove to cool aand went to bed. By morning 3/4 of the bread was gone. Seems the whole house loves it.

This bread was wonderfully easy and yummiful. I used half brown half white sugar and added 1/2tsp baking powder. I used a 9X3 bread pan and found that that middle top portion of the bread just wouldn't quite bake all the way, but the rest was great. Next time will try baking at a slightly lower temp.

This was a great recipe. I followed advice from others and used the extra 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also added about 1/4 c applesause and beat the egg whites seperatly before adding them in for extra "fluff". I put it in one loaf pan and cooked just under 1 hour but the edges started to burn just a tad. But it tastes SO good. Thanks Nikki

this was very easy and the results were excellent. the only change i made was to add a 4th banana (because they were small).since i used tin foil loaf pans, i placed a cookie sheet underneath and covered the pans with aluminum foil after 30 minutes...it took about 50 minutes to bake. kudos nikki...

Excellent, delicious recipe.  Easy--my kids did most of the work.  Adding 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, 1 tsp. vanilla, and using half brown and half white sugar is a good idea.  I did muffins, and baked at 375 degrees for about 18 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.  I used some bakers joy on a non-stick muffin pan and they came right out when I flipped the pan over.

I just finished making this  bread and it is really good.  The best part about this recipe is that everything goes in one bowl and no mixer is required!!  The bread didn't rise very much and the batter all fit in one bread pan.  I added a few chocolate chips and used half brown and half white sugar, and I think some walnuts would taste really good too.  This bread is really moist, tasty, and really easy.

I replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar, added a tsp. of vanilla and some chopped walnuts, and baked the mixture in a muffin pan.  It yielded 15 moist, dense banana nut muffins.  My roommates ate nearly all of them within an hour of their emergence from the oven...

It tasted great!  It was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  Watch the timer though, mine was overdone in 50 minutes, but I never have used that over before.

This wasn't the best ever banana bread but it was definitly good!  I will definitly make it again due to the fact it was so easy and so fast to put together.  (No creaming of butter and sugar!!)  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I put it in a 9x5 loaf pan instead of 2 and baked it at 350 for 1 hour

Delicious bread.  Needed to bake a bit longer than stated, but still wonderful final results.  I added 1/4 C more sugar and chopped walnuts for some extra zip.

I tried this recipe because I had some overripe bananas on hand but just the "basics" for banana bread. Since this recipe didn't call for anything unusual, I thought I would give it a shot. I just finished baking, and I have the say that the flavor of this bread is very nice, and it was easy to bake. However, it didn't rise very much, so I have two flat loaves. Unless you like small slices, I would suggest making one loaf. I added some vanilla, next time I may try a bit of cinnamon as well.

I've never had trouble with recipes, I can usually change it up and it still comes out fine.  This one, though, I followed exactly and I ended up with a mess.  It never even got into the oven.  Before the banana-adding stage, the DOUGH (not batter) was like sugar cookie dough, and not anything like a bread batter, or dough.  I decided not to waste the banana's on it and tossed it all out.  Waste of ingredients, but there's not way it would've come out as bread... it was the exact consistency and taste of sugar cookie dough.  I won't try this one again.

I did not use nuts ( not a family favorite)instead added chocolate chunks. I used the suggestion of 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It came out great! Nice and moist.

Delicious!  I changed the recipe just a bit by adding an extra banana, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla.  I divided the batter and put walnuts in one half & chocolate chips in the other.  I used a 9x5 loaf pan filling each side with each half of the batter.  Cooked for about 55 minutes.  Would probably be a little better if I used 2 smaller pans.  The bread was starting to brown a bit too much trying to get the center to cook all the way but it was still really good.

I used 1 cup white flour, ½ cup w.w.flour, 4 bananas, some cinnamon, vanilla, walnuts on one half and chocolate on the other half. Baked it all in one loaf pan for 1 hour 20 mins. Awesome but next time I will use more cinnamon. Nice and moist and tasty. Maybe another banana next time too!

mmmm..... This banana bread was so good! I don't really like a strong banana taste, so 3 bananas workes for me. If you nedd a stronger flavor, add a banana. I put chocolate chips in half the batter and that tased even better! I suggest you use chocolate chips. Enjoy!

I love Banana Bread, and in my recent move, I've still not unpacked my box of recipes, so I came here to find a good recipe for Banana Bread.  This bread was very easy to make, and came out tasting great and moist.  The reason for a 4 star rating, VS 5 star, is because without a few of the variations I made, it would have been somewhat lacking in taste.  I doubled this recipe, and added an extra banana for more flavor (7 total), and I also added 2TSP of cinnamon, 1 TSP of allspice, 2 TSP vanilla extract and then finely chopped walnuts.  Banana bread just isn't all that without walnuts, to me. I have a recipe given to me by a friend a few years back, and I still have yet to find any recipe that tops it in taste.  Now I just need to find it.  I might make this one again, unless I find my recipe first.  All in all though, this is a great tasting recipe with a few variations, and anyone should be pleased with the outcome.

This is the first time I have ever baked anything. The Bread is EXCELLENT. I used Splenda instead of the sugar and I added the chocolate and peanut butter chips. Everybody LOVES it. I have made it 8 times now. Thank you so much

This bread is great. I have already ate half of one loaf myself. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg along with about 1/4 cup sour cream. It is a little on the crumbly side but that does not take away from the flavor.

My first banana bread, and it turned out great. A tip: let the batter sit for a bit before you cook it.  I made one loaf right away and the other the next day -- the second one was much moister.

Like my bf said, I've made better banana bread.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used extra banana, and there was way too much banana then.  It seemed undercooked and dough-y because of it.  But, even excusing that, it just did not have good flavor.  It was much too sweet.  I will stick with the "Banana Banana Bread" recipe on this site instead.

This bread is great! I never made banana bread before. I added one extra banana along with one tbsp. of vanilla extract. I cooked all of it in one pan (9x6"). The loaf was the perfect size and it cooked in exactly one hour, like the recipes says.

I just recently got married, and decided to make my husband his favorite bread.  I have never baked before, and this recipe was so simple!  I can't believe how amazing it turned out.  I have almost ate one of the loaves all to myself!  I took other's advice and added cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate chips and an extra bananna.  It is soooo good.  I just can't wait until my husband gets home.

This is my first time making banana bread and this was very easy. Like other users, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra banana to bring out the taste.  Everyone loved it and is asking me for the recipe.

there are a million banana bread recipes out there, I only gave this a 4 because  I wanted to use ground flax seeds in place of nuts, so I also added an extra Tblsp butter, then added vanilla extract and a dash of nutmeg.  i made muffins and the consistency was perfect!

The recipe is great, i added 1/2cup of brown sugar, 1/2tsp cinnamon and 1tsp vanilla, the taste is great just bit too sweet for us. If you avoid sweet and calorie, just follow original recipes and add vanilla, cinammon..

Absolutely delicious and couldn't be simpler. I made it as is. The only thing that stumps is why you make 2 loaves. I'm guessing it might not rise otherwise? Each loaf was between 2 nd 2 1/4 in. high. I like mine to be a bit higher so next time I'll see if it works making one with the entire recipe.

I used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Also, added 1/2 t. vanilla for flavor and an extra banana.  Both loaves took 35 minutes to bake.  Good texture, good flavor, good color!  A++++++++++++

Very easy to make. I doubled the recipe(lots of old bananas!)and snuck in a cup of whole wheat flour instead of white. No one noticed, and every piece was wolfed down.

made this twice so far.  first time i used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar.  i added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of walnuts.  i only had 3X5 loaf pans so i filled two of them.  they almost overflowed when baking but luckily stayed in the pan.  had to bake it for about 1 hour and 15 min. because the top wouldn't cook.  everyone really enjoyed it but i thought it came out a bit dry. 

the second time i added an extra banana, 1/2c white and 1/2c brown sugar, 2 tsp milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2c walnuts and baked in 3 3X5 mini loaf pans for 45 minutes.  it was more moist this time, although the loafs were on the small side.  

great recipe but i feel like there might be something out there that's better.  will use this recipe for the time being.

This recipe is great!  It was my first time baking banana bread.  My fiance, my two year old son, and I ate a whole loat in less then 30 minutes!  The first time I tried this recipe I added one extra banana.  The second time I made it I also added one teaspoon cinnamon.  It turned out great!

i was delighted by the deep brown color & wonderful flavor of this bread. whole wheat flour worked well with this recipe & added to the texture. being a nut lover i had to add a cup of chopped pecans. one more note: looking at the amount of batter i knew it would yield a nice 4 x 9" loaf. this worked out very well with the baking time coming in at just over one hour. thanks nikki!

I think we've found the perfect banana bread recipe!  Most are too smushy and if they avoid that they end up being crumbly.  This is perfect.  Every time I've made it new eaters comment on how outstanding it is.  My husband and I like it with walnuts.

I followed this recipe as originally posted, but because I had 7 very ripe bananas (3 cups mashed) I doubled it.  I also added 2 cups of chopped walnuts.  It made 8 cups of batter, which I divided among three 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pans and baked for 1 hour.  They turned out beautifully and smelled heavenly as they baked.  The taste was great soon after baking (still warm, because I couldn't wait), but even better the next morning with my coffee (I kept them in the refrigerator because I like cold banana bread).  Marvelous recipe, Nikki, thanks!

Good recipe, very good. I only had 2 bananas so I added about a 1/4 c. sour cream. I also brushed the top with melted butter as soon as it came out of the oven and let it cool wrapped in plastic wrap. It turned out beautifully. Very moist and chewy. Next time I'll add chocolate chips.

A very easy and simple recipe. I added 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips to mine and ate it straight out of the oven with butter spread. Absolutely delicious!

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand (along with some VERY ripe bananas!).  I made only a few alterations.  I added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I substituted applesauce for the butter and egg beaters for the eggs.  The recipe made 12 muffins (I used muffin liners sprayed with baking spray).  I baked for 25 minutes, although I think 20 minutes would be ample.  Then, I poked 6 holes in each muffin with a toothpick and iced each with confectioner's glaze.  The holes allowed some of the glaze to seep into the muffins.  Absolutely delicious, moist and virtually no fat!  My 4 year old loved them and begged for more.  They did turn out a little more dense than other banana breads that I have tried, but making them with applesauce and egg beaters might have been the reason.  Thanks Nikki!  These are great!

This was really good! I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and vanilla to give it a little more flavor but it was overall very moist and yummy. Unfortunately the very center of mine wasnt cooked so I could only eat the outter parts. Not the recipes fault though, I live in Germany and the ovens are a bit different. Im going to make this again for sure and tweak it till I get it right in this darn oven! I also added cinnamin sugar mix the last 20 minutes of cooking.

Wow!  This banana bread is really good.  This replaces my old banana bread recipe.  The only thing I did different to my bread is I added 1/2 cup each of frozen raspberries and cried cranberries.  I came out with four mini loaves.

Perfect!  I only had two bananas, so used the feature to scale it down to 11 servings.  Used only 1 egg and a tablespoon of sour cream to make up for the liquid difference.  This made 4 mini loaves which were baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  This is the new banana bread recipe in our house.

No spices?  No problem!  I thought for sure this would be bland without spices...I was wrong!  I  used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and 5 smallish, still-yellow bananas which gave it flavor and moisture.

I did split the batch and make half with cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg...tasted great as well.  Great recipe!

i loved this banana bread!  I used only one loaf pan so it took a little bit longer to bake. I also added milk chocolate chips for a nice change.

This was really great.  I loved the density, texture, and color of this bread.  I made it with 3 very ripe bananas, nuts, chocolate chips, and coconut.  My family was not too crazy about the chocolate chips or the coconut.  Next time I'll try just adding nuts and baking raisins.  We also serve it by spreading cream cheese on a slice.  Delicious!

Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I like this one more than the alternative of using yeast for banana bread...which takes way too long. It also smells soooo good while it's baking. I will make this over and over.  Thanks again!

This Banana Bread is fabulous!  I have made it twice.  The firt time I made it exactly as the recipe although I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. The second time I substituted 1cup of the flour with 5/6 cup whole wheat flour and 1/6 cup of ground flax seed.  I also used 4 bananas.  This batched turned out amazing!  The flax seed adds a nutty flavour and tons of nutrients.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We make this whenever we have bananas getting soft.  We use 5 bananas instead of 3, making it more moist and bringing out the banana flavor.  Terrific and very easy.

This is a quick and easy bread! I did what some of the other reviewers suggested and added vanilla, baking powder and chocolate chips.  I will only make one loaf next time as they were very small...also, they were ready in way under an hour - could be my hot oven, but just a note to next bakers!

This recipe turned out very very good!  I scaled it up, to make 4 loaves.  The scaled recipe called for 4 1/4 eggs, so I opted to add 5 eggs, and 7 banana's instead of the 6 1/2 it called for. I ran out of regular flour so about 1/4 of the flour was whole wheat. I added walnuts also.  It is just divine, super moist and very very flavorful.

This was a great banana bread! Very moist. I don't have a bread pan anymore, so I used my cake pan. I added 1\2 cup walnut chips, 1\2 teaspoon cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg to the batter. Delicious... grandma said so!!

The end product was very good.  I was a little nervous at how dry the batter looked, having never made banana bread before.  I thought the batter should be a bit looser.  I also would have liked the the bread to rise a little more.  I think next time I'll put the batter into 1 pan instead of 2.  Also, I only had to cook the cakes for 45 minutes.

Very tasty and rich without the nuts--a little darker than I normally care for but still good.

This recipe is perfect! Tastes great and doesn't leave you with that moist sticky stuff on top like most banana breads. Tastes AWESOME with a handful of chocolate chips thrown in.

This recipe is probably yummy as is, but I needed it to be fat free... so I substituted 3 egg whites for the 2 eggs and used 2 T Sunsweet Lighter Bake in lieu of the 1/4 C butter (can be found in the baking isle of most grocery stores).  I also added 1/2t baking powder and 1t of vanilla and 1/2t butter flavoring.  They were GREAT and I couldn't even tell that they were fat free!  Thanks so much Nikki for a recipe that fits my diet!

I've made this a few times now and really like it for the mini-muffin pans.  It makes a ton and is perfect for the baby!  I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and added the milk.

Terrific recipe!  I did add 2 Tbsp. milk and vanilla, and a sprinkle of cinnamon, though.  Like others suggested, I used half brown and half white sugar, too.  I doubled this and made 2 9x5 pans (baked at 300 for 80 min.).  I have gotten rave reviews at work for this!  Also added chocolate chips to one of the loaves, which the kids loved.  Simply delicious!

I've been looking for a moist, dense, flavorful banana bread for years...and this is it!  I used 1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, added ginger and nutmeg as recommended, and liked the additions.  I also used banana baby food (100% pure banana!) as I didn't have any ripe bananas, and it was GREAT!  Not inexpensive, but worth it for the flavor and the moistness!!

What an excellent banana bread!  It was so very easy to make and quick.  I don't have any kids, but I do have a husband and he absolutely loved it!  I used a bigger bread pan, so it produced one loaf, but there are only two slices left!!  (I made it last night!!!!)

I may have done something wrong because it tasted just like any other banana bread that I have had.  And that was with using 5 bananas.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, it just tasted like all the others I've had.  I found nothing special about it.  Sorry, Nikki.

Dee-lish!! I used a 9x5 loaf pan and baked for 70 mins. Also cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was still sweet. Very easy to make.

This recipe gets a Blue Ribbon from my family.  Everyone who ate some of it thought it was the best banana bread they had ever tasted.  This is the only banana bread recipe I will ever use to make my banana bread from now on.

The moistness and texture were superb, and it was very quick and easy to make...the only thing I would (and did!) change was to add 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp each ginger and nutmeg...gave it a wonderful taste! I also made 1/2 cup of the flour whole wheat and I feel it added to and enhanced the texture.

Good Basic Banana bread, Great way to use over ripe bananas. I made muffins out of the batter, only took 30 minutes to bake them

A quick, easy recipe that turned out great!  I substituted raisins for the nuts, but I will have to try chocolate chips.
