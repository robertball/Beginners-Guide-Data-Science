This is really good! I was surprised at how good it was, to be honest, and was a little nervous about it since there were no other reviews yet, but the beef broth, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce work some magic in the crock pot. I actually ran out of Worcestershire sauce so when I went to make the barbecue sauce I substituted soy sauce -- it still turned out very well. I did use a few tablespoons more ketchup than they called for because I didn't think it looked right. I served it on potato rolls with cole slaw and sweet potato fries on the side.

I was a little nervous about how spicy this was going to be, but this was absolutely the best BBQ pork that I have eaten. I cooked five pounds of pork loin and then spent about 45 minutes pulling the pork usung two forks. I doubled the sauce and mixed it into the pulled pork. It was a little dry yet, so I added some store bought BBQ sauce. Everyone loved it and many have asked for the recipe. They can't wait for me to make it again!

This is one of my go-to recipes.  The only tweak is that I add a tablespoon or two of liquid smoke.  
Especially good for days that I don't want to mess around with meals.  I've made it for potlucks and for a couple moving day parties.  I don't make the barbecue sauce since I have a brand that I like really well.  I only add a little sauce to the end product and let everyone else put on more if they want.

So incredibly good! After cooking, I found I wanted a bit more sauce, so added some Sweet Baby Ray's sauce to moisten it up a bit more. I served it with Buttermilk Coleslaw from this site. Incredible!!!

This was a great recipe.  I was looking for something non-vinegar based to try.  I use pork tenderloins from Costco whenever I do shredded pork recipes.  You just have to take two forks and lightly "shred" the meat with them!  I doubled the sauce recipe when I made this.  I like lots of sauce.  Froze half the meat and we had for dinner last night.  Made another double batch of the sauce to use with the frozen meat and it was perfect.

I'm only giving this two stars because I think I messed up.  First I used 3 lbs of pork roast so there was way too much sauce.  Second, I may have added too much Worcestershire to the sauce because it was overwhelming and also overly sweet from the molasses.  With that said I still wouldn’t try this again…it wasn’t the orange-colored pulled pork I’m used to at fairs (it was dark brown) and tasted nothing like that either.  Actually the sauce literally burned my mouth – not because it was too spicy, but there was just way too many flavors going on – two days later and my mouth still hurts!

It was really good but a little too sweet for my taste, maybe less molasses next time.

Very good and super easy. Since I was feeding little kids, I omitted the hot sauce and added V-8 juice instead (more veggies, more favor).
