this is a great recipe--as long as you change it up somewhat. first off, there's no need for the soy sauce or salt. and as others have said, the teriyaki can be cut to about 3/4 to 1 cup. i also used two large bell peppers and medium-to-large sized squash & zucchini. i think the recommended amount of veggies is not enough.
overall, a fairly quick, good & filling meal. it's even good without the tortillas. i'll probably make this again.

What a waste of our vegetables!  This recipe was so salty we couldn't even eat it.  Adding soy sauce and salt on top of teriyaki sauce is a heart attack waiting to happen.  We would never recommend this to anyone!

Excellent! I would have liked more veggies in it, though. There was soooo much rice it drowned out the veggies. Next time I may dbl. up the veggies or buy large squash instead of small, etc. I also left out the salt (plenty salty!) & added some shredded cheddar cheese on top.

My only reccomendation for this recipe is do not add the salt.  There is enough in the teriyaki and soy sauces.
For those who want to watch their sodium buy low sodium versions of these sauces.

Loved this recipe with some changes! Left out salt and used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Added scallions (per another review), freshly chopped garlic (per another review), and chopped fresh mushrooms (my own taste). Used only 1/2c light Teriyaki sauce and 1tbsp light soy sauce, but I also only used about 1c cooked jasmine rice. Used more pepper and added just a smidgen of crushed red pepper for added spice. I wrapped the mixture up in lettuce leaves for a completely cholesterol-free meal. Very tasty!

Sorry, my family and I just didn't care for this recipe.  I took previous reviewers' recommendations and cut back the rice by about half.  It still seemed like too much rice.  I added black beans and cut the teriyaki sauce back to about 2/3 cup and the soy sauce (I used low salt) back to 2 Tbsp.  I cut out the salt altogether and it was still a bit on the salty side.  It just didn't seem to work well with the flat bread either.  Tortilla wraps probably would have been better.  I doubt I will make this again.  This recipe feeds closer to 8 people.

Made this recipe tonight and it was Great!  Hubby even liked it (which is amazing for how many veggies it had).  I did not use as much Teriyaki sauce as was called for simple because I did not have that much.  I used 1/2 cup of Teriyaki Sauce and this seemed plenty.  I did not use as much salt due to how much is normally in Teriyaki and Soy Sauce.  I used 2 fresh cloves of garlic instead of the garlic seasoning.  I did add three chicken breasts, which I first cut into strips then browned in the pan prior to cooking veggies.  I took the chicken out of the pan while the veggies did their thing and added the chicken back in at the same time I added the rice.  I think had a used as much Teriyaki Sauce as was called for, the end result would have been fairly soupy.  The only way to have avoided that would have been to reduce the sauce by boiling or reduce the amount of Teriyaki put in from the beginning.  Great recipe definately going to be done again at our home.  Thanks for the Recipe!

One of the first things I noticed was, way too much pepper. My mouth was on fire. Next time I will cut it down to 1/4 t. pepper. I ommitted the soy sauce & salt as others have suggested & cut the teriyaki sauce down to 3/4 C. I couldn't imagine how it would     be with 1 1/4 C. Probaly really soupy. I used Jasmine rice instead of standard white rice. I also added 1/2 lb sirloin steak. Overall this was a decen t recipe. It was very filling. I had 2 tortillas & my husband had 3. We still have a ton of leftover mixture. Edit: This was not good for leftovers. The rice became crystalized by the sauce. Eat this the same day. I don't know if it was something I did or what, but I won't be making these again.

way, WAYYYYYYYYY too salty! No one could eat this made the way this recipe is written with that much teriyaki sauce! However, I did try this again using 1/2 to 3/4 cup, which made it a little better.

This was a very good idea for a recipe. I found the suggestions helpful.I used lots of the veggies and brown rice and only used enough teriyaki sauce (my favorite is all natural Maggie Gin's) to flavor and moisten the rice and veggies. I added veggie chicken strips and used whole wheat wraps. My husband and kids asked for seconds.

I used brown rice instead of white rice and it turned out really well.  I didn't add the extra salt due to other people's suggestions.  It was plenty salty with the soy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  Also, butternut squash makes a decent substitute for yellow squash.  Black beans are a good addition as well.

This was pretty good. I didnt add the soy sauce and only added 3/4 cup of teriyaki as others suggested. I thought it turned out good. Not my favorite recipe in the world, but the leftovers will be eaten!

Way too much salt.  I should have taken everyone's advice and eliminated some of it.  It also needs more veggies.  If I make this again I will certainly cut the salt out.

Delicious!  I reduced the amount of teriyaki sauce to 1/2 a cup and that was perfect.  This was so filling and so good, that we didn't even miss the meat!!  Will be making this often!

These are great! I threw all the veggies in my food processor and chopped them, it made it SO easy. I did add the can of black beans like another review suggested. I used low sodium soy and lite teriyaki while omitting the extra salt. I also threw in two crushed garlic cloves to simmer with the veggies (instead of garlic powder). My husband is a big meat eater, he loved it! We have PLENTY of leftovers for lunches. Thank you!

i loved this recipe!  it made a ton, and the leftovers are great cold the next day.  I made a few modifications to the recipe (didn't add the extra salt, one cup of teriyaki instead of one and a half, fresh minced garlic instead of powder).  Oh, and try adding chopped scallions into the wraps.. mmm :)

Recipe way too salty and I didn't even put in the salt. I'm going to try it again, though, without the soy sauce. General taste was good, just needs less salt.

As written, I wouldn't make again. But it was very good with teriyaki only, (I just added enough to coat veggies) less rice or more veggies, a little pineapple, and a little Sriracha for spice. The pineapple in particular was a great suggestion by another reviewer. I could not imagine adding soy sauce and then a half teaspoon of straight salt. Wow that would be salty, and I'm a person who loves salt more than is good for me.

It was very salty, even with low sodium soy sauce. If I make this again, I will leave out the soy and salt, and I think it would benefit from an addition of pineapple. Add a little sweet to balance the salty.

Fiance & I thought it was great!  I didn't include the zucchini or squash but added sauteed mushrooms instead.  It was great and I reheated it as leftovers and it was still great!  Will definitely make again!!

This was very good.  I added more veggies to it just because of what I've read on other posts.  I made instant rice instead, and added the teriyaki to the veggie mixture.  It turn out great.

My wife made this recipe and even though she left out the soy sauce and salt, it was waaaay too salty!  I think maybe the recipe is supposed to call for teriyaki glaze and NOT sauce.  I bet it would be pretty good with the glaze, given the sweeter, less salty, and thicker texture and flavor.

I took the advice of others and used 3/4 teriyaki sauce and then did not add soy sauce or salt.  I think  next time, I will add some more vegetables (perhaps a stir fry mix).

Definetly cut back on the salt.  Low sodium versions of soy and teriyaki sauce should be sufficent.

This recipe was pretty good.  My only complaint was how salty it was!!  My husband who salts everything was commenting on how salty it was.  I did not add the extra salt and next time I make this dish I will not add any soy sauce either.

This recipe was way too salty, even though I used reduced sodium soy and teriyaki sauce.  I think there was too much teriyaki sauce as well.  I had to add an additional cup and a half of rice and it was still too watery.

Good weeknight diner. I added black beans as suggested by others (half a can was enough). Definitely use low-sodium soy sauce and omit extra salt.

Well, I should have read the reviews before I made this.  Yes, it was too salty and too much teriyaki sauce for  the rice to absorb making it runny. On the whole a good recipe idea that would give vegetables a nice flavor with some changes. One I will probably try again with much less teriyaki and soy, no salt and regular rice verses the converted rice (Uncle Ben's) I used.

The next time I make this I will make some changes: 1.5 cups uncooked rice, 1 cup teryaki sauce, no soy sauce or salt, and add broccoli.  With these changes, I think the recipe will definitely be 5 stars!

i followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and only used 1 cup of teriyaki, and halved the soy sauce.  this still made a TON of stirfry!  i'd say this recipe, as is, makes at least 8 servings.  next time i will use considerably less rice.  it also felt like it was missing some sort of spicey something which i still haven't figured out.

i also used 3 frozen (pre-cooked)teriyaki chicken breasts which i threw into my wok with the veggies.  we also used quesidilla shells for the roll ups.

all-in-all a good recipe that i will most likely make again.

This is a GREAT recipe!  Healthy and very easy to make. We use brown rice with it, as it disguises the taste of it pretty well.  We also chop everything up pretty small.

I added teriyaki chicken to the recipe and my family loved it!  I had to scale it down for two and it was perfect.  I'm still learning and I couldn't ask for a better recipe.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe for my potluck at work because it makes so much!  I followed others' recommendations and deleted the salt as well as used the low sodium versions of the sauces.  I also substituted eggplant for the squash and added chicken and cheddar cheese for some of the wraps.  Both the chicken and veggie versions were big hits!

very tasty...hot or cold. Also very good served with the Asian Coleslaw..use the extra peanut sause from the slaw for dippin' the wraps if you like. I used whole grain rice, and replaced the yellow squash with mushrooms.

Way too much Teriyaki sauce.  I saved the left overs and will add just as much rice as the original recipe to it to make it edible.  I do like the flavors, but agree with others that the soy & salt are not necessary.  May try this again with modifications.

Wasn't impressed with this - way too much soy sauce for our taste and nothing spectacular about the meal as a whole.  I'll find better uses for my zucchini.

This recipe definitely has potential, but as it reads, it gets 2 stars.  It was extremely salty and I didn't even add in the salt or all of the soy sauce.  We did not care fo this. I will make it again, but I will only use 1/4 cup of teriyaki and go from there.

My fiance and I recently became vegetarians and  so we have been trying to find good recipes to make.  We both thought this was excellent.  We left the salt out and added a little bit less soy sauce.  Also, we don't like peppers, so I sliced up carrots instead, and I put some meatless chicken in too.  It ended up being delicious!!  Next time we might add some extra veggies and maybe some more seasoning (like cayenne pepper or something).

We really liked this one, but we agreed with the other reviews on the salt factor. It is a pretty salty dish. But we cut the teryaki sauce down to 3/4 cup. Everything was swimming in the sauces so we cut it down. but over all it was pretty taisty.

The original recipe is way too salty, so I made some adjustments. I used a little less than 1/2 a cup of teriyaki sauce and didn't add any salt or soy sauce. Definately you won't need extra salt. I added chicken to this and put cheese in the wrap. Tasted great!

This was good and pretty easy to make.  Next time I will use my food processor like someone else suggested to cut down on chopping time.  I added broccoli and some stir-fry beef.  I only used 1/2 cup teriyaki because I ran out and omitted the salt and it was still flavorful enough.  I have made similar recipes, but this was tasty and I will make it or something similar again.

This was great!!! I thought the rice proportion was perfect. I didn't think it was too salty at all. Also, I used flour tortillas in place of the wheat tortillas. With the addition of the chicken, as suggested below, and the rice with vegetables, it ended up making 8 wraps instead of 4. Very filling too! Thanks for the great recipe!

Definitely too much salt. I added only about a cup of teriyaki and a tablespoon and a half of soy sauce (none if I didnt have any in the house). I also didn't use the flat bread or wraps, just left the rice separate and  put the veggies on top of the rice. Instead of using squash I add things like bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts. I try not to sautee/simmer the veggies so long because they become soggy, not al dente. Adding red pepper flakes gives it a nice kick. Overall a good recipe. I add chicken to it from time to time as well. Makes for excellent leftovers.

Nice simple dish.  I made it without rice and spread a thin layer of cream cheese on the tortillas before wrapping.

These were really good. It made more than enough. I didnt have any yellow squash but I did add a can of black beans when I added the rice just to warm them up. I also added some grilled chicken in to the tortilla and everyone just loved them.  I will definatly make these again. MMMMMMMM Good
