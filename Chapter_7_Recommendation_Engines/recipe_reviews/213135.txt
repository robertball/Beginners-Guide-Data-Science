Very good. It was spicy-er than I expected. . . but no complaints there. My family liked it. Very easy to make. It woke me up, that's for sure! I loved the taste of the spice and kind of sweet butter.

This isn't really a drink for everyday, but I think a big crockpot of it for a holiday party would be nice. It's different, but not so different that it's a turn-off for a gathering.   Next time I'll add a bit more butter to it though, play with the proportions of everything until I get it right for me.

Hmm. I had a hard time choosing the rating of this. I think it is pretty good, but it lacked something. I would reccomend this drink if you like butter.

Yummy treat on a snowy day instead of cocoa!  If you can get Vernor's ginger-ale, do it.  It makes a big difference.

For a house with 3 kids who all adore Harry Potter, this is a spectacular go-to recipe for a fun night in.  Perhaps the best part for our kids is the way the ginger ale foams up when adding the other ingredients.  (We've also made it in a crockpot, to be able to go back a couple of times through the night, and that has worked well for us.

Next time I make it, I will probably just add a pinch of cinnamon. I added 1/4 tsp, and it had cinnamon on the top. I had to use my spoon and pour the cinnamon part down the drain. But other than that, It was AMAZING! Thank you for putting this recipe up.

Very nice! We substituted Sodastream Cream Soda for the ginger ale and it came out great. The kids loved it.

This is a wonderful spiced drink! Just the thing to warm you up on cold mornings or rainy days. Mine took a little over 2 minutes in the microwave to get hot enough. I love all the cinnamon spice!

It was very tasty. I would use a little less cinnamon nest time. It was a little strong.
