Unbelievable – I forgot to add the garlic AND the onion (busy day today) and Hubs and I agreed it was still “D” good!   I’m sure this would have been even better with those additions but quite honestly, I don’t see how!  Other than using fresh herbs rather than dried (the fresh equivalent is 3:1 and I substituted oregano for the marjoram) and forgetting the onion and garlic I followed the recipe as written and it was simple perfection.  Rich, savory, flavorful, neither too thin nor too thick.  We cleaned up every bit of this and Hubs has requested a repeat soon.  The only thing I’ll do differently next time is to be sure to follow the recipe more closely and not forget the onion and the garlic.  I’m sure it will take this “A” recipe to “A+.”

I was a bit hesitant to try this because I don't like the taste of wines in stews...weird, I know-lol!  But I gave it a shot anyway, and I'm so glad I did.  It was pretty good the first day, it was even better the second day.  By the third day, it really was heavenly.  It didn't last 
longer than that, as we were each trying to get the last bowl without the other noticing.  I doubled the recipe, which is why it lasted so long.  I tried to follow the recipe as close as possible.  I couldn't find low sodium beef broth, so I used regular.  I also only used half the amount of mushrooms.  I cut the meat slightly smaller than is in most stews, to spread it out a bit more.  I can't say how well it freezes.  That was my intention when I doubled the recipe.  Unfortunately, it was just too good to stop eating.  I'll be making it again this afternoon.  Can't wait!  EDITED TO ADD...it took much longer than the suggested cooking time.  I added in the carrots after cooking the meat and broth for 30 minutes.  I added the remaining ingredients and spices after cooking for the suggested cooking time of 1hour.  Then cooked another 40 or so minutes.

Followed the recipe, with the exceptions of using merlot instead of burgundy and using fresh thyme instead of dried.  The meat needed about one and one-half hours to become tender though, so be sure to allow some extra time because of this.  This was a satisfying dinner on a very cold night.

This was delicious! I sautéed half the onion and two cloves of garlic with the meat. Then, added more garlic and the rest of the onion at the end like the recipe suggests. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. It was very simple and tasty. Even my finicky 13 year old ate it... and that's saying something! I didn't have any trouble with the thickness. I don't like watery stew, this was just thick enough, kind of the consistency of gravy. I will definitely make this again!

Followed this recipe exactly and it's delicious! I used cabernet and it was great! I also added the mushrooms with the meat (earlier than the rest of the veggies) so they could soak in the wine a bit longer. Definitely a keeper!!

Tried this today and it was delicious - even if I did have to substitute a Merlot for the Burgundy (only red wine I had on hand). The long simmer just helped the wine flavor make the gravy rich, without any alcohol taste left behind. Next time I might add a little less liquid, because I prefer a slightly thicker gravy, but that's the only change I'd make.

This was terrific! Such a classic comfort recipe. I let it simmer for quite a while to make sure the onion was soft and let the flavors sink into the mushrooms. The consistency was perfect, and the smell filled the whole house! I might add a bay leaf next time, but otherwise no changes. This is definitely going into the regular winter rotation.

Delicious!! I served it over egg noddles.
I don't usually like stews but this was amazing! My super picky husband even had 3 servings!
I need to add a little more of both liquids toward the end but I think that is because I added too many mushrooms and they absorbed a lot of liquid.
I will add more carrots next time too.

I was very anxious to try this recipe after reading the other reviews and loved the thought of a nice stew on this cool fall day.  Unfortunately, we felt this "stew" lacked flavor and thickness.  I added a bunch of salt and flour to get it.  I doubt I'll make it again.

Love this dish!! 

I didn't have access to a London-broil so I opted for a nice lean rump roast cut and diced in nice chunks.  I placed it in my crock pot instead of a dutch oven!  

It was a perfect meal, served with a salad and crunchy bread!

The flavor of this stew is fantastic! Made as is but after browning the meat, I threw everything else in and cooked in the oven at 300 in a cast iron dutch oven for about 2 hours or so. My house smelled so good while this was cooking. A definite repeat!

Wowzers this was good! Made this exactly as written, except I skipped the marjoram because I didn't have any. I added a little rosemary to make up for it. It thickened up perfectly, and was nice and flavorful!

Absolutely fantastic!  I used tri tip steak strips cut into small chunks and marinated the meat for a couple hours prior to cooking.  I also added 4 stalks of celery and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Best stew we have ever had!!!

Oh my goodness --- this is a wonderful dish!  My husband raved about the flavor and the tenderness of the beef.  I will cut back on the salt next time; there was just a bit too much, most likely enough from the beef stock.  This is a keeper!

Made it and it was very good! There wasn't quite as much broth as I would've preferred and I felt that it had a bit too much thyme, but it was definitely worth the time! I intend to make it again with a few adjustments.

I added a little more of the spices (because of a review that said it lacked flavor). I shouldn't have. The herbs overpowered (because I added more) the other flavors, but it was still delicious. I will definitely make it again (without the extra spices). It smells divine as it simmers, too, so you have the added benefit of your house smelling wonderful.

This was good all on its own ... but the second time I added some low-sodium beef gravy mix to help thicken it up and add a little more flavor. Also a couple ok maybe a few more splashes of wine.

I used 2 lbs stew meat, 6 oz delicious cabernet sauvignon and NO mushrooms (since  I didn't have them already)....my husband thanked me.  It  was amazingly delicious.  Easier than I thought.  The sauce was just right and the gold potatoes were perfectly tender.  Will make this again during our chilly fall and winter months.

This was delicious. But I did have to add 2 additional cups of broth. Next time I'll probably cover the beef while it simmers to retain liquid.

Really enjoyed this stew. I use a red blend wine because that's what I like to drink) and reg. stew meat. I also used  a little Trader Joe's  "21 salute" also.  I did add some winter squash from the garden. My husband thought it was great! I will be making this again soon. Thanks Jennifer.

I think I understand why people thought the recipe was a little bland. First, I never dredge meat in just flour - add a little salt, pepper, perhaps some granulated garlic or onion.  Also, after browning the meat,  instead of waiting I would throw everything into the pot at once so that all those flavors cook into the meat AND potatoes.

There are a lot of good ingredients in this stew - I think the timing of when to add could be adjusted. Then simmer for 1 - 1.5 hours.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed the advice of others and increased the cooking time a bit,  2 hrs before adding vegetables.  I doubled the recipe and used a 4 lb. chuck roast, these proportions worked well for me.  I also browned half of the onion , garlic and mushroom after browning the meat, and stewed these vegs and meat together.  Perhaps this gave the sauce a bit more body;  I understand why some would not like a thin stew broth like this recipe makes, it's a personal preference.  I like it, but next time I may try to thicken it at the end with some flour, just to see.  Overall, just an elegant, flavorful stew.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe precisely and the meal turned out perfectly.  Even fussy eaters in the family who were determined they didn't like stews admitted they loved it.

I added an onion soup packet to the flour in the ziploc baggie to season the meat a little more - -and it really added to the recipe!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe  - -oh, I also put about 2 tablespoons of 'Wonder' in about a 1/2 cup of half/half and stirred in the last 10 minutes of simmering!  It really made the broth a little creamier!  Enjoy!

Yummy. Don't like burgandy so I used white and red combo. I like the gravy a little thicker, so I doubled it. This is the best comfort food and it's just as good the second day.

Nice texture and I liked the addition of mushrooms with the Burgundy wine; however, the finished product was still rather bland. My kids liked it, but hubby thought it was only edible. The search for a good beef stew will continue for me (it is my Achilles heel)!

Good flavor. A thick stew that wasn't very attractive in colour the next day (grey), but still tasty!

Really good stew.  Next time I will add a couple of beef bouillon cubes to make the flavor richer.

I made this yesterday and had it for supper - it was good, but not great.  However, I had it for lunch today, and it is absolutely delicious.  No need to add cornstarch or flour to thicken it up - it does so after sitting a day.

We really enjoyed the flavors in this stew, but I think I will cut the thyme a little next time. The taste was far too prominent. The burgundy adds a great dimension, but like others, I like my gravy a little thicker, so followed the recommendation of another reviewer and mixed a little cornstarch with some half & half and got what I was going for. Excellent!

I used this as a base recipe for veg beef soup as it was very much more like soup than a stew and added plenty of spices (bay leaves, garlic, sage, thyme, etc) to up the flavor -- and added more beef stock, onions, green beans,  parsnips and celery.  It has become my fav beef veg soup recipe.

Hands down the BEST beef stew I’ve ever made. Had always been Leary of cooking with wine because I haven’t done it much but that must be what has been missing and the second day it was even better.  Didn’t think it could get any better!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Love how hearty this is. The only difference I made was adding a bit of cinnamon and clove and including 2 more cups of stock + cornstarch for thickening to stretch the stew out.

Delicious!  Recipe was very similar to another I've been making over the years, with the exception of the bacon.  Wow!   I used three strips of bacon, added two stalks of celery to the veg, and added 2 cups more of beef stock.  I did not use low sodium stock since the amount of spices in this recipe seemed unusually small compared to the rest of the ingredients.  I floured my stew meat but added a teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder.  I will definitely make this again!

I really loved this recipe.  For years I have just made stew in the crockpot, but didn’t like how mushy the vegetables would get. I loved the burgundy flavor, flavorful gravy and nicely cooked veggies!

The instructions are clear and understandable but the writer or uploaded needs to remake it again. I added whole garlic, sliced onions, while cooking the stew meat. I wasnt going to add them but the recipe made it become like glue with the flour and bacon oil. Having your meat taste like raw flour isn't enjoyable. 1 bacon piece just isn't enough. I love london broil roast but i would not add to a stew dish. I add 2 more cups of broth after dumping in beans and vegetables. I added whole vegetables instead of chopping them. It didn't make even to the top. I add only 3 cans of flavored garlic with olive oil dice tomatoes and 3 cans of water. I didn't have any bigger cans. Added more whole garlic, sliced onions lots more season after 30 minutes of cooking. I did reboiled the pot again since the vegetables I added with more greens veg like kale and let it wilt down. Reboiling help with the whole vegetables and making the liquid thicker. Used Cabernet  Sauvignon from Columbia Crest. Work really well on flavor.
