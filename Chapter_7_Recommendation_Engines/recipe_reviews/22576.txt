I'm giving this a 5 because this is a great template.  I guess I prefer Cuban or Mexican Picadillo.  I followed directions exactly only finding that the clove spice was very overpowering even though we like clove. I was able to correct that by adding some sugar and cumin.  You can subsitute the cinnamon and clove with coriander and cumin.  Cubans also add raisins - which does add to the flavor! This dish is sometimes used as a filling for tacos and empanadas - it is a very flexible dish.  You can make it into a stew by adding corn, etc. We enjoy this dish as much as we enjoy good old American chili.  Tonite I served it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on the side.  Red wine or cold beer go great with it. Thanks submitter.

Very good!  I made this for my husband and he loved it.  To make it a little more Cuban style, I added diced potatoes and 6 chopped hard boiled eggs to it and seasoned it with a little beef bouillon and Adobo (spanish style season-all). Served with white rice.

This was really great.    Like others suggested, I used cumin and coriander and served it over white rice. My boyfriend already claimed the leftovers for his lunch tommorrow.

LOVED this one!  I scaled it back to serve 4. Also, I didn't use quite the amount of oil called for and there was no sacrifice of taste in doing so.  I served this over steamed rice and had a fruit (mostly melon) salad along side.  Wonderful!  Will make this one again.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS.....This is a nice variation to the typical Cuabn ingredients, the cinnamon and cloves gave it a nice touch though. I did add a very special ingredient which I believe made thsi dish even BETTER. I added 1/2 tbs of cumin (love cumin... gotta have cumin)

LOVED IT! I was so unsure what to expect with this and had never eaten anything remotely close before. I am a very picky eater and far from adventurous so for me to try this was a real stretch. I scaled this down to 2 servings and this turned out so wonderful. I loved every delicious bite! I did add some raisins in. I used white wine vinegar and canned diced tomatoes I had leftover in the fridge but in my haste I didn't read about adding them after the 10 min simmer, however it didn't seem to affect the end result. I served this with steamed basmati rice and it was so good, I even had seconds. The meat was tender and soft and this was so flavorful!!! Thanks JRICE, this is fabulous!

It was Great! I drained and added a 14oz can of large black olives that I spilt in half when mixed in for more texture. 7 cloves of garlic but not overwhelming, for us could have put in a little more. Served with rice and was a Great left over dish better the next day.

I did not care for this.  I made it to use as a filling for empanadas, and it was too sweet.  I used cumin and chili powder and only half the amount of cinnamon that was called for, but I had to add half a packet of taco seasoning to make it palatable.  I will most likely not make it again.

Believe it or not, I made this recipe using soy ground meat.  Since there is no need to cook it, I added it towards the end, just enough to heat it up. Also, many picadillo recipes call for raisins, which I added, about a quarter cup.  I can't wait to make it again!

I love picadillo because it is so versatile! This is a good picadillo, but I prefer Cuban style with golden raisins and no cinnamon. However, the cinnamon was a tasty variance. I serve picadillo many ways...over white rice, with potatoe (baked, hashed browns, roasted or mashed) and a dollop of sour cream or greek yogurt on side, sometimes with my eggs, sometimes i add black beans and make burritos or tacos with it, sometimes I use it as a filling for empanadas...my personal favorite but time consuming is to make rellanos de papas (fried potato balls) with it...yummmmm...i could go on and on with the different ways to use this stuff! I love it and it always is used up FAST by the family!

I loved this recipe (with modifications), although I was looking for a more traditional Cuban style picadillo. My mods: pearl onions sauteed and slighty mashed before adding yellow onions, garlic and peppers (adds a nice texture and color complement). The cinnamon was interesting, but I'd use less next time. Less clove, along with the addition of cumin and adobe seasoning gave it a more Cuban taste. I always liked the green olives when I ate picadillo in Miami, so I added half more than the recipe called for. Lastly, I used more hot (habanero) sauce than the posted recipe, and I also added red pepper flakes, and used apple cider vinegar. Next time, I think I'll add some coriander (like some others have suggested), and also use the traditional Cuban raisins, which I think will work well with the cinnamon and apple cider vinegar. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.

I thought this was a nice foundation to picadillo but made some minor adjustments. First off, I scaled it back to a serving of 4. Once I saw the new measurements, I scaled back the cinnamon and cloves to 1/8 of a tsp. instead of the 1/4 tsp it called for. I knew it would be too much due to their overwhelming flavor. I left out the olives and capers mainly because I didn't have any on hand. I added some pure annatto seed, ground, about 1/4 tsp, and 1/4 tsp of Mexican oregano, and cumin. I scaled back the tomato sauce to 1 1/2 cups and added a half cup of beer. Beer is very typical in chicken and yellow rice so why not in picadillo. I served it over white rice and thought it turned out pretty good.

This was fantastic.  I did omit the green peppers and served it over a package of yellow rice.  My husband asks for this all the time, and it makes great leftovers if you make a big pot.  It microwaves well if you want to take the leftovers to work for lunch.

I have made this recipe a lot and everyone loves it!  I use the cumin and coriander.  The capers seem to make it better and I also found cooking it for at least an hour is better.

And that rating is saying a lot!!!  My Mom was taught by my Grandma (a great Cuban cook!) how to make authentic Picadillo.  I did not have her recipe handy, so I used this one.  A bit much on the cloves, but not bad!  Now I just need to make the black beans and rice - and it tastes like home!  

I'll definitely keep this recipe and use again in case I cannot find my Mom's!!!
Thanks!!!

This has become a regular dish at our house. I put raisins and diced potatoes in mine and use cumin instead of the cinnamon and cloves. Also, I use a can of tomato paste and red wine for the sauce.

Easy to make. Turns out right every time. I simplify by cooking it all in one pot (not moving the ingredients in and out of the pan). I use only fresh ingredients (nothing canned).  I also add either sliced mushrooms or cubed mango (but not both). Great over rice, but also makes a nice chunky spaghetti sauce if you add a few more tomatoes. Keeps well - makes good leftovers.

My husband I loved this!  We like spicy, so we added one chopped jalapeno.  Also added about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Pretty delicious. I used orange peppers because that's what I had, and it still turned out well. Added nice colour too. My husband isn't a fan of olives and my son doesn't like capers much, but they both liked them in the dish.

Made this exactly as written, and served over brown rice.  My family loved it.  I was surprised that it didn't taste sour, or too cinnamony.  The flavor was wonderful.  I will make it again.

I have always done chili, and wanted a variation - i found that this is it.
i was worried about adding capers and vinagar- but was surprised how it complimented the dish. I also found that i enjoyed the cinnamon and the slight sweetness that the dish gave. Being on low carb the only thing i was careful about was the olives and the tomatoes. A very satisfying meal that you could whip up in a short amount of time.

Really inventive and easy picadillo recipe. Not the traditional Cuban version, but equally delicious, and I am Cuban. I made this with ground turkey instead of beef. I didn't have capers, so I decided to toss in some mild bottled pepperocini I had on hand instead. It was delicious and not too spicy. The aroma of this dish while cooking was so unique, my cat actually jumped on the counter to see what I was making, lol.

Excellent taste.  I didn't have olives or capers, so I omitted them and then I added the cumin and corriander (as recommnended by other reviews) and my whole family loved it, even my kids.

Pretty good. I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce and went a little too far with it, lol. I served it over potatoes. Would be better in an empanada. Also, adding raisins, really makes this dish!

This is a good recipe.  Consider subbing cumin & coriander for the cinnamon & clove.  While cooking, put a small skillet over medium heat with about 1/4 cup of oil.  Add a couple of tablespoons of clove, and let them fry and fry until they are so crisp they shatter.  Strew these over the top of each serving.  I was taught to serve this dish with diced well fried potatoes.  The raisins are a nice addition.

This stew was a HUGE hit with the people that I cooked for last night. The smell was intoxicating without the flavor being over powerful. I served it over rice and it was gone in 20 minutes! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipie that I will be sure to make again.

i wanted to make this for dinner one night and my mom immediately started thinking of different things she could make for herself to eat.  once i started making it, she was drawn in by the smell and gave it a try.  she actually went back for seconds and asked for the recipe to give her friends.  she also took the leftovers for lunch the next day!  my family LOVED it!

Flavor-wise this recipe is absolutely fantastic. Unusual but sweet and spicy balance. I made as-is but threw in a bit more heat with some red pepper. I served it over white rice and it was good...but I think it might be better utlized as a filling for a taco/enchilada/empanada

Great recipe. I added raisins, reduced the cinnamon and cloves to 1/2 tsp each and added 1 1/2 tsp cumin.  My 7 yr-old especially loved it.  Makes a lot and freezes well.

First time I've had Picodillo. I made it pretty much by the original recipe... though I don't know what a 1/4 teaspoon of hot sauce looks like. I didn't add enough to make it spicy. I avoided the recommendation to add cumin or colliander cause I wanted to see what the base Brazilian version was like. It was easy and yummy. One thing I was unsure about...  the whole tomatoes get piled into the mix? Whole? I cut them up in the pan. This wasn't an incredible meal, but it was good enough I'll try it again... maybe with a couple of the recommended additions.... Raisins, really?

This dish would be great without the cinnamon and cloves. I just made it following the recipe exactly and it tasted like a pumpkin pie was mixed in it-now I'm stuck with a horrible meal that the family has to eat.

Wow!  I love it!  I use whole cloves during the boil, then remove them.  I also add about 2 Tbsp. of Goya tomato sauce with onion and garlic and an additional 1/2 tsp. of cinammon.

This was really good. My husband literally licked his plate when I asked him if he liked it. I served it with mashed potatos. But I think it would be great if you used it as a filling for stuffed bell peppers.

This was diffrent and very good I was a little afraid to use to many cloves so I only used 1/2 tsp and I should have used a whole tsp. Next time I will use more capers and olives a really good dish that we will be making again.

A fun variation on chili! We served it over brown rice, but think we'd prefer white rice next time.  Definitely made the house smell good, and wasn't as spicy as we thought (which is a good thing for us. :)   )

I didn't like this dish either. I would like to blame the cinnamon & cloves, but it could also be that I prefer Mexican picadillo too. I served over rice, but my son took a couple of bites and said he couldn't eat it. We ended up throwing it out.

Next time, spices to taste. Not the recipe's fault, but the olives I bought had pits! What a downer. I ended up pulling them out of the finished dish-they had added plenty of flavor.

Neighborhood Cuban restaurant used to serve this at lunch times on weekends.  But alas, it has since closed.  Glad I can make this at home now.  Left overs make great filling for empanadas (use frozen empanada discs to save time)

Great recipe. I totally do my own thing in the kitchen but I followed it pretty closely MINUS THE OLIVES (and cloves) and it came out yummy. It's quite different. Kinda almost sweet but not overly so. Go easy on the cinnamon! I only put a sprinkle. I served it over buttered white rice and it was a great dinner. I could totally see using it inside empanadas or flautas. Enjoy!

The recipe as written is decent, but not as palatable as I would like for it to be. I added 1 tbs of cumin, doubled the salt, added maybe 1/2 tsp of adobo seasoning and threw in some corn. Decent quick meal, but not extraordinary.

This was pretty good. I didn't realize until I started cooking that I was out of onions, so I just added some onion powder and we don't like olives so I left those out and it turned out pretty good. It does not look appealing at all, but tastes pretty good.

I used coriander and cumin instead of cinnamon and cloves. This was ok. We tried to use it as taco meat but it just didn't go well with it. So we kind of stared at it for awhile and just decided to put it in a bowl with some cheese. I loved the olives in it!! But the texture of the capers kind of grossed me out a bit.

I served this over fried potatoes and a dollop of plain yogurt on top...my family gobbled it up.

Good recipe.

Yum! Interesting blend of flavors. Left out the capers and added some raisins.

My family hated this dish, the cinnamon was overpowering, and we couldn't eat it.

I really liked this dish when I have tried it at restaurants.  I think I will try the coriander and cumin or halve the cinnamon and cloves next time. It was a bit much on those.
