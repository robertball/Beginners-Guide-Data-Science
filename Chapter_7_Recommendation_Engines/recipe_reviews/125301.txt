A very good bread and easy to make. The only changes I made were to add cinnamon and to make my own apple sauce (we like it chunkier, gives more flavor). I also used 3 LARGE bread pans. The loaves were huge and looked beautiful! A big hit in my house.

We absolutely loved this bread - I used my own chunky homemade applesauce, and used  dried cranberries as well some raisins.  I made two of the loaves in the round pans as suggested in the recipe, and one in a loaf pan, and I prefer the ones made in the round pans.  I will make this again and again.

Wonderful!  I found that I had to use closer to 9 cups of flour to get the dough to the proper consistency.  Used a mix of dried cranberries & raisins. Used homemade applesauce.  Did 3 free-form rustic round loaves and baked them greased & cornmeal-dusted cookie sheets (no need for round cake pans or loaf pans - the rustic loaves came out great).  Love it!

This bread was very good.  I added a chunky applesauce and it was a very moist bread.  I would definitely make it again.

I have made this a number of times now and it is always great. My daughter in law loves it. I would note though that my Irish husband pronounced it the best Brack he had ever had. Apparently it is very similar to an Irish bready-cake sort of thing (not dissimilar to Pannetone) and the whole family loved it. By the way-I didn't change a thing!

Very good.  I halved the recipe and still got two medium sized loafs.  Followed the recipe to a T, an it was well received by my family.  Added more apples than called for and omitted the glaze.

Awesome bread. We followed the recipe as is except we used bread flour becuase we had it on hand. It's amazing how sweet the bread is without really any sugar!

Perfect addition to Easter supper.  It has a "Lenten" feel and look.   Note: I found this dough quite sticky and used more than 8 cups of flour when kneading.  Be sure to have plenty around in case you run into a similar problem.  Also, next time I'll add more raisins.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe just the way it is! It also works well with cranberries combined with the raisins.

My family can't get enough of the bread whenever I make it. 

It has become one of my favorite recipes!

I was looking for bread that would make an excellent breakfast toast.  This bread certainly fits the bill. The honey, raisins and apples give the bread a delicious natural sweetness.  Not only is it good for toasting, it is very good untoasted as well. It is just sweet enough and has perfect texture.

Not worth the work/endless rising. Was okay. Nothing overly special. Had a harder time 'kneading' the fruit into the bread than I anticipated. Even after adding cinnamon and extra raisins/apples...still bland. Would not make again, sorry.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! I made it twice in one day and gave it as gifts. My friends raved and raved about it, and my kids want me to make it again and again. The only change I made was to use dried cranberries instead of raisins.

This is such an excellent recipe. MY whole family loves it,  and because it makes 3 loaves,  I can share it with friends as well!  I love that this doesn't call for cinnamon or any of the traditional spices that we put with apples.  It gives this bread a fresh light flavor.

I cut this recipe in half, and it still made two very large free form loaves. I added about 3/4 cup of chopped dried apple, and still felt it could have used more raisins and apples. This makes excellent toast. Overall a good recipe, but I will play around with it some more, it still seems to be missing something.

I tried making this bread twice.  The first time, it came out so dry, we threw it away.  The second time, I added cinnamon and used a lot less flour than called for.  The bread still came out pretty dry.  The flavor was fine.  I don't know if it's the altitude (we live 5280 ft) or just that it needs more oil, but it's way, way too dry.

It needs to have to be layered with cinnamon, sugar and maybe nutmeg for a really awesome impact.

Very light and moist bread.  I used golden raisins and probably not enough apple.  I only had one small apple, though, so I had to content myself with that.  Made two nice big loaves.  I just shaped into round loaves and placed on a cookie sheet pan, then let rise.  Nice sweet bread.
