I've made this pie three times now, and it's always made a delicious pie.  However, I had an epiphany before making it this last time that greatly improved the result.  I've been adding a tbs of cinnamon as was recommended by other reviewers, but made the mistake of adding the cinnamon to the sauce.  The pie tasted fine, but the presentation didn't seem as impressive as people raved about.  It was dark brown and unappealing.  This last time, it occured to me that the cinnamon was making the pie turn dark, so instead of mixing the cinnamon into the sauce, I mixed it into the apples in a bowl before pouring the apples into the crust.  The sauce I prepared as stated in the recipe.  The resulting pie was picture perfect in its presentation, and cinnamon taste was just as good.  So remember, if you want to add cinnamon, add it to the apples, not the sauce.

OK, you've probably read many reviews as to  how delicious this pie is (and it really is!).  What you've also read is the submitter forgot to list the cinnamon in the recipe or how you should forgo the lattice crust and a few other suggestions.  

Let me strongly suggest that you try this recipe unaltered at least once.  The  point is that this is a small twist on traditional apple pie, so no cinnamon (or nutmeg or cloves or raisins etc.).  The lattice crust is essential because it lets you pour the caramel mixture over the top and it drains into the fresh apples underneath while leaving a thin coat on the lattice crust.  It really isn't hard to do...there's even a short video of a teenager making a lattice crust pie for a dinner in honor of his mom's visiting friend.  Check it out if you need some pointers.

I also saw comments suggesting to use 6 apples instead of 8.  Another suggestion I saw several times said to just put the pie in at 350 degrees for 1 hour and it's fine.  I would say if you are using an 8" pie dish, sure, reduce it down to 6 apples but for a 9" dish, 8 apples was just right (I could have probably squeezed in one more).  I would also strongly suggest following the baking instructions because the higher temperature helps set the bottom of the crust.  With fresh fruit pies, there  is a chance the crust will not fully bake in the center as the fruit releases liquid.  The high temperatures "temper" the crust during the first 15 minutes of baking.  

Finally,

There's no need to keep looking around for an apple pie recipe.  This one is delicious.  I modified it slightly based on other reviews. Use 6 apples (instead of 8) and you'll have plenty. Instead of pouring the sauce on top of the pie crust, I just mixed it in with the apples.  Additionally, I added
1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla to apples.  To make my life easier, I used the Pilsbury ready-made pie crust and I didn't do the lattice top.  Instead, I just made slits in the pie crust, brushed a thin coating of milk over the top and sprinkled with sugar.  Don't forget to put a cookie sheet under the pie dish when baking--it will overflow!  Lastly, I thought my apples turned out perfectly extending the cooking time at 350 to 50 minutes.  Please enjoy this recipe!!!

Few notes to those having performance problems with this pie: Use a variety of apples, Granny Smith plus one or two sweeter types of apples (McIntosh is good)if you're finding it to be too tart or too firm. Makes it less tart if that's a problem, plus some apples break down more than G. Smiths. So end product should be not too tart, not too firm, and not too mushy. If your crust is turning out mushy on the bottom, you probably know to brush it with milk or egg first to prevent liquid from seeping into the dough, but another help is to place the pie into a (cool) cast iron skillet before putting in the oven. Putting the pie on the bottom rack (or floor of the oven itself if you have a gas oven) also helps bake the bottom crust. If it's too runny for you, use flour, potato or corn starch, ClearJel or some other thickener. No shame- it's pretty standard apple pie baking procedure! There are too many positive reviews to reject this as a "bad recipe" before doing some troubleshooting!

absolutely divine!!!!  This is the recipe I will use from now on.  The only mods. I made were to add a tsp of vanilla to the heated mixture, used a variety of different semi-crisp and crisp apples tossed in a tbsp. of lemon juice, and of course, cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added 1/2 tsp salt to the butter, as I think that salt does tend to bring out a little flavor in the apple and I only had unsalted butter. I am not good at lattice tops so I followed the others that just added the mixture to their apples and placed in pan followed by the top crust.  Just superb!!!  thanks so much for this recipe.  It sure is a keeper with the addition of spices....can't have apple pie without the spice. **I am assuming this is a deep-dish pie?  I purchased 7 very large apples of different varieties instead of one bag that are usually small in size, and I had to put this in my deep dish pieplate and it was mounded nicely.  Keep in mind that apples do lose juice, therefore during baking there will be shrinking so always mound apples up nicely before putting on top crust.

My family hovers to see who can sit closest to this pie every Thanksgiving.  To make it easier on yourself, use 1 less apple, pour most of the sauce over the apples before putting on the crust, then drizzle remaining sauce over the lattice, then cover crust edge with foil until last 20 min (trust me on this one).  Cook on a cookie sheet as sauce will drip out!  I don't have lots of time, so I use the refridgerator crusts & with the addition of the sauce it comes out great!  For our tastes I add lots of cinnamon.

This was my first time to make any kind of pie and it turned out great.  I was so proud of it.  I made it for my fiancee's family and everyone loved it...there wasn't any left!  I did the lattice crust which was surprisingly really easy.  I also added the cinnamon vanilla and a touch of nutmeg as recommended.  I used 1 less apple than the recipe calls for..but probably could have fit it in if I really tried. I also brushed the bottom of the pie with egg whites before putting the apples in and cooked that for about 5 minutes so the bottom wouldn't get mushy.  I used a "crust saver" that I got at the store to keep the pie from over flowing and the crust from burning.  I also mixed the apples in the sauce and poured it all in together...then brushed the remaining 1/4th of the sauce on the top.
I can't wait to make it tonight for our thanksgiving party at work.

I am a retired professional chef and I have never had an apple pie like this apple pie! It is amazing! I like to toss the apples with cinnamon and instead of 1/4 cup of water alone, I use half bourbon and half water. Also...I suggest adding  1/4 teaspoon of salt. Many people don't realize that adding just a touch of salt to sweet dishes helps to bring out the flavor!  But no matter what alterations you do to this pie, the magic is in its preparation! Pouring the liquid over the latticework crust creates a crunchy topping while the liquid that bakes with the apples almost caramelizes. In fact, I almost wanted to call this "caramel apple pie".  What a great submission! By far and away this is THE best apple pie I have ever tasted!

I have never made an apple pie before and have to say this was delicious the best ever I did make a few changes i used apple juice instead of water, i added two 2 tsp of cinnamon to the apples prebaked the shell for 10 min after brushing with egg white and also added 1 tbl spoon of flour to the apples. i mixed the filling with the apples and then poured into the shell and baked for 1 hour. I don't even like apple pie but the entire house smelled wonderful and our guests loved it

This is my great grandmother's recipe and I am sure that she is watching over everyone who makes this, smiling. My Great Grandmother and her children (my Grandmother and Great Aunt) were the best cooks and they loved to fill your belly. I am proud to see all the rave reviews and hope that you will try this recipe and enjoy it as much as we did and do to this day. Also a note try it as is the first time it is perfect the way it is but if you feel that you still need to modify it or tweak it to your own. that's cool!  Thanks to all! and I love you, Great Grandma, Grandma, and Nanny.

I had never made an apple pie in my life, but using this recipe, I won my county's Ag Fair Apple Pie Contest!! I did use Red Delicious apples, as I am not too fond of Granny Smiths. Also, I made one batch of the sauce and mixed it in with apples before adding into bottom crust. Then, AFTER I did the lattice on top crust, I made ANOTHER batch of sauce and poured over top of pie, using as much as needed. I made this pie before the contest and took slices around to friends and family members and told them, "here, taste this and tell me what you think". Everybody raved and I was hoping they weren't just being nice. I made another pie the morning of the contest, figuring I had nothing to lose. I must say- I was really surprised when I was announced as the winner and now this will be the ONLY apple pie recipe I will ever use!

My husband and I always argue about whether or not a recipe should be tried for the first time as it is written.  I am the one who says, "Yes"!  After that, the cook is free to tweak it according to personal taste.  This pie got rave revues without cinnamon or other spices and without any other changes whatsoever.  Why trifle with perfection?  Anyway, those of you who are experiencing runniness, may be using "salted" butter instead of what the recipe suggests.  Osmosis may be contributing to extra juices being extruded from the apples.  I have never had a problem with this, and I attribute it to using unsalted butter.  As a diabetic, I have tried the recipe using the half Splenda/half white or brown sugar substitutions and find that no one seems to know the difference.  This pie is so fast and easy and delicious.  I have shared the recipe with many to date.

This is by far the best apple pie i've ever had. Just an afterthought, the finished product looks nothing like that picture submitted for this recipe. It has a delicious, golden brown lattice crust glistening with brown sugar and butter. Yum, it's so good! 

There is however, one HUGE problem with this recipe. The submitter forgot to add a very neccesary ingredient, cinnamon! I just add it to taste in a large bowl with the sliced, peeled apples and mix to incorporate before adding to the crust.

My family loved this recipe. I combined a family recipie for the apple filling with the rest of the recipe.  
 I have a few suggestions...
1.  I made the filling with 2 TBS cornstarch, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

2.  make sure your pie is ready with tha apples in it and the top crust on before you start with the sauce ontop.  I made this mistake and the sauce came out hard.
3.  The "looser" you pile your apples in the pie the more "room" you have for the sauce to sink in.
4.  Before pouring the sauce on, place a cooling rack over your sink so its suspended.  Then SLOWLY pour the sauce.  The slower you pour the more stuff with get inside the pie.
5.  Make sure to have a cookie sheet under the pie.  IT WILL DRIP.  I lined my cookie sheet with foil so I can change out the foil when it start to burn.
6.  I also used 1/4 cup apple cider instead of the 1/4 cup water

I followed the recipe as directed. And I also followed the suggestion of 1 reviewer: I added 1teaspoon of cinnamon to the apples after I was done slicing them, & I brushed egg white on the crusts. I didn't make my own crust. I bought 1 box of Betty Croker pie crust mix. And even though the pie was great, next time I'll buy 2 boxes of Betty Crocker b/c 1 box wasn't enough. The bottom crust was too thin, but the lattice top was fine. I poured the filling onto the apples & saved 1/4 of a cup of it to pour some over the top crust. Overall, the pie was delicious! This was my first time baking a pie & it was my practice pie b/c I'm making it for Thanksgiving this year.

I just love this pie, as do all of the people who gets a slice.  I use Pillsbury frozen pie crust (deep dish) for the bottom crust and Pillsbury refrigerated crust for the lattice top.  Like others, I substitute the water for brandy or cognac.  You may have to add a bit of extra liquid if you use liquor.  And also like others, I think it's much easier to mix the apples with the sauce before placing in the pie pan.  This truly is a fabulous apple pie.

Sorry, but I hated this.  The only substitution I made was Gala apples instead of Granny Smiths, because I think Grannies are too tart.  Anyway, the whole thing was repulsive.  I should have made a more traditional-style apple pie.

I was always intimidated by baking pies.  I decided to try this recipe and I'm glad I did.  I made this pie four times over the holidays last year and plan to make it again this year.  Unless you have small apples, 8 apples is way too many.  I found that 4 medium sized apples fills the crust adequately.  If you want an overstuffed pie, 6 medium sized apples should suffice.

Thank you Grandma Ople!  Her tradition carries on through each and every holiday.  We love this recipe, I do add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon - I mix it into the apples rather than the sauce.  I combine the apples with 1/2 the sauce then put it in the shell.  I top with lattice and pour and brush the remainder on.  I use the premade rolled out crusts when I'm pressed for time and I can't tell the difference between those and homemade - not like the frozen crusts that come in the pan.  Thank you for a new tradition!  Update - I won the first place in the pie competition at our County fair this year with this recipe - it's a winner!

This pie was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed.  As I was serving the dinner the pie was being devoured as I was placing the entree down and sides of the meal.  I did add cinnamin as that is a staple to me in pies and the aroma was to die for.  If you need to bring a pie for this Thanksgiving holiday this is definately the one 5 star to bring.  Thank you so much Grandma Ople.  This is a major keeper

I don't like pie and I loved this recipe! I made mine by using one of each different kind of apple I could find, fuji, granny smith and two other kinds I can't remember names. I put them in a bowl and sprinkled with 1tsp cinnimon and 1tsp nutmeg then tossed. Poured most of mixture in and tossed again then put in ready made crust. I drizzled the rest of the mixture (sugars) over the top of the crust and it baked beautifully! I did the 15 minutes at 425 then 30 at 350 then I turned the oven off and let it sit. So yummy!

Apple will never make it into my top ten favorite pies, however, I do make them for my family. I always taste what I make and I'm happy to say that grandma Ople certainly knows her way around a kitchen. This recipe is absolutely wonderful. Read many of the reviews and took others advice. I used a combo of various types of apples, apple juice in lieu of the water, added vanilla and apple pie spice to the mix, coated the apples with most of the sauce, did not lattice the top crust but brushed it with the remaining sauce. The glaze created a light and crispy top crust and a very flavorable pie. Thanks so much Rebecca!

look no further, this is THE BEST apple pie,  even better than my grandma's.  i added a bit of cinnamon, poured 3/4 of the sauce on prior to the top crust and saved 1/4 to pour on the crust.  i have made this pie both ways but, in my opinion, it's less messy with the sauce inside and the pie is much, much prettier when cooked.  very easy also!

I found this pie to be a bit runny, but the flavor was perfect. The second time I made it with a lattice crust and just poured the excess liquid out the top when it was done baking. Shameful, I know, but the pie recipe is a true winner!

I used this recipe for a pie contest at work and won!  I did modify it a little bit.  I add cinnamon and vanilla to the apples before adding them to the pan.  Once the apples are in the pan I take carmel ice cream topping and drizzle it on top of the apples.  I don't use a lattice crust; I use a full top crust and I add the sugar and butter mixture to the apples before putting the top crust on.  Once I have the top crust on, I brush it with an egg and sprinkle with sugar.  Yum Yum!

This recipe is absolutely perfect AS IS! I know people are recommending cinnamon, and yes, a traditional apple pie has cinnamon ... however, this is not your traditional apple pie. It's BETTER! I make the pies for every holiday gathering (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter) and apple is always a family favorite. I usually use a family recipe but this Thanksgiving tried this recipe for a new twist. The ENTIRE family said it was the best apple pie they had ever had. I had to agree. I know you're tempted to use less apples, add in some other ingredients, change the lattice work, etc, but I beg you not to! Try it out just as it is and you won't be disappointed. I promise!

This apple pie was as delicious as most of the reviewers have stated! Oh Wow!  I added spices as recommended by other reviewers. It baked continually on 350, I used a frozen crust. Totally a winner for the upcoming holidays!

This is probably the best apple pie recipe I have found.  It is just wonderful.
 The only thing I do that is a little different is add cinnamon to the apples because I love the smell and taste of the cinnamon.  This is a KEEPER!!

In conjunction with SDTERP, I totally agree with her review. You know there are just some things that should not be changed or made easier and this is one we should just leave alone.  Well done Grandma Ople!!!

This is my favorite apple pie recipe.  I add spices to the butter mixture like others do.  I also mix the apples with the butter before putting it in the pie shell.  Here's my trick to ensure I get the carmelizing on the crust.  All I do is reserve a little of the butter after mixing it with the apples.  Then I brush that over the top pie crust.  This way, I know the mixture has gotten all the way thru the filling, but also get the look I want on top.

What a wonderful apple pie recipe, I've made this about 4 times now and each time it's delicious and I get so many compliments! I make some minor changes though. I toss the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of cloves, and pour  the caramel sauce over the apples, instead of over a lattice crust, which I baste with egg yolk. I used the "French Pastry Pie Crust" from this Website which worked perfectly. A scrumptious apple pie, I was worried it was going to be a bit dry but it wasn't at all, the sauce made it really special and moist, but not too moist. The apples weren't soggy either, I use between 6 and 7 apples, which is plenty. My mother in law asked me to translate the recipe into German for her! I have also made this pie with rhubarb and apples, and strawberry-rhubarb. That worked very well too!

Great apple pie recipe. I mix in 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg into the apples along with some chopped pecans. Also a must is to serve warm with some real vanilla ice cream.

The foundation of the pie is very good.  I use my own basic pie crust recipe (doubled) with added cinnamon to it.  I reduced the water to 1/8th of a cup and also added cinnamon to the mixture.  Prior to adding the apples to the dough, I bake the bottom portion for 10 minutes so it would not become soggy.  If you use many apples as I do, place the pie on top of a cookie sheet to prevent the butter etc. from leaking out of the pie into your oven.

This was delicious.  I followed this almost exactly.  I like things sweeter, so I added some brown sugar to the top of the apples and sprinkled with more cinnamon and added a few pats of butter.  When pouring the mixture over the top you have to go VERY slowly.  The next time I make this pie I will toss the apples around in the mixture first and reserve some for the top.  Don't miss that step because it makes a fabulous carmel like glaze to the crust.  And don't forget a drip pan! Great recipe.

this was my first attempt at making apple pie. it turned out amazing. i made 2 of them. the first i followed the recipe but added half teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 teaspoon vanilla to apples. was amazing. the second i put the spices and the sauce with the apples saved a little and brushed on top of pie. either way is great. also to prevent soggy crust, i prebaked the bottom crust at 350 for about 5 minutes and it was not at all soggy. put strips of foil around edges of top crust to prevent burning. if i can make pie this good anyone can. thanks grandma ople

Absolutely the best apple pie!!! My late elderly neighbor, Hazel would be pleased with this one and she made THE BEST apple pie I'd ever eaten until this recipe! The only change I made was adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and brushing the bottom crust with beaten egg white to ensure it would stay flaky. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

FAB-U-LOUS! First time making apple pie and I look forward to baking it again. Of course I added cinnamon and vanilla (I refuse to bake without vanilla!). I also ran out of dough (like I said, first time!) so I made a crumb topping instead. Delicious!

Love, love, love this recipe. I have made it every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past 2 years and my family can't get enough. I brought it into a pot luck about a year ago and a co-worker paid me to make him one for his thanksgiving dinner.

Cindy of 11/9/09--This pie is not what I expected given all the stars. It's okay but not all that.  There are two recipes for this pie just so you know.  One tells how long to simmer syrup, one doesn't.  I used the one with the 2400 or more reviews.  It doesn't.  I thought both were identical so I just clicked on this one to rate.  Thank the Lord because I thought I was going crazy reading this one's direction.  Though the simmer issue is moot.  No need to get all worked up over a rating.  You are suggesting a person have to lie just because someone took time to post a recipe??  If I didn't like it...I didn't like it.  It wasn't runny, it held up...but the taste was just okay. I am a seasoned cook...not a chef...but a seasoned cook.  I followed THAT recipe from 'A' to 'Y' with 'Z' being the spice that I added.   If I had not added spice...this rating would have ben a 1 at best.  Since I DO know how to cook...nothing failed with pie. It's just ok!  When I see this many stars...I just expected a lot more.  You must be a relative but be advised to breath...it's not that serious. You responded to my previous comment/rating (this one replaced unfortunately) with wierd & hurt feelings over a recipe I have every right to rate. This apple pie is palatable at best for my taste so no-- it wasn't a disaster but it was just....oooookay. I still think the pie would fair better cooking the apples IN this syrup as well but again that's my opinion. And thank goodness for it!

Cindy of 11/9/09--This pie is not what I expected given all the stars. It's okay but not all that.  There are two recipes for this pie just so you know.  One tells how long to simmer syrup, one doesn't.  I used the one with the 2400 or more reviews.  It doesn't.  I thought both were identical so I just clicked on this one to rate.

I agree with Annie on 3/9/09 by saying make the ORIGINAL recipe first. Then you can make a comment and add or delete ingredients to the receipe. Give it a chance before you do your own thing. And another comment if I may...there are solid apple pies from the west, their are running apple pies from back east where you need a spoon to eat it. Different strokes for different folks. I am one who likes a somewhat solid pie with tart apples with a hint of cinnamon. Nothing sweet and I am from So. Calif.

My family is quite experienced with pie making (I've won blue a ribbon for my peach pie and my mother won a blue ribbon for her apple pie)and I think  this apple pie recipe (Grandma Ople's) is fabulous!  It's a little tricky to make because of the syrup, but very much worth the effort.  

I used a combination of Jonathan, MacIntosh, and Yellow Delicious apples and I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the syrup. Be sure to stir the syrup constantly (I burned the first batch and had to make a second batch).  Also, don't boil the syrup too hard for the entire five minutes because I think it makes the syrup way too stiff - - almost like hard-tack candy.  Instead, just simmer like the instructions say (while stirring the entire time).  I poured the syrup over the apples in a large bowl before putting them into the shell.  The syrup did "clump up" when it hit the cold apples, but I made sure the clumps of syrup were  evenly distributed in the pastry shell so that when the pie baked, the syrup would melt and distribute evenly (which it did).  Be sure to put a large piece of aluminum foil on the oven shelf under the pie, as it will most likely drip a lot.  I didn't pour the syrup over the lattice crust (again, the syrup was too thick).  Instead, I sprinkled large-grain white sugar on top of the lattice crust. 

The pie was beautiful and delicious.  Everyone loved it.  It would give my mom's blue-ribbon apple pie a run for the money!    

I just wish I would have measured how many

This pie is very hard to mess up... it reminds me of this amazing pie at a diner in northern michigan. My wife said it's the best pie she's ever had. 6 stars.

This was the first pie I'd ever made, and it came out a HUGE sucess!  I used store bought pie crust, coated it with a thin egg wash, then cooked it a few minutes to harden so it wouldn't get soggy from the topping.  Then, I followed the recipe, but added only half the caramel mixture to the apples.  I then took another softened store bought crust and cut it into strips, latticing atop the mound of apples.  I poured on the rest of the sweet sauce, before adding a finally sprinkling of white sugar to the top crust.  I cooked it about 35 minutes and then took it to my boyfriend's house (he's addicted to a. pie!), where we reheated it for a few minutes.  It cut easily and tasted DELICIOUS!  I don't even particularly care for any pies, but this is actually a new favorite food of mine!  I will make it many times again exactly as I stated before!

I made this pie and it was picture perfect.  I made a few suggested alterations to the recipe and it was the best apple pie ever.  Alterations, are as follows:Prebaked bottom crust for 10 minutes at 350 after brushing with egg whites. Mixed 2 teaspoons of  cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of flour to the cut apples. After piling the apples in the shell, poured the syrup over the apples and reserved a little for later. Then put a full crust on top, cut slits, and brushed he top with the remaining syrup.
While baking, I put a cookie sheet underneath for fall out. Cooked same as recipe covering edge with foil after first 15 min. When done, turned off oven and let set for 15 more min in warm oven before removing pie.

The pie turned out great. I made it twice in two weeks - once as written and once with a little apple pie spice sprinkled on the apples which I preferred. I had no problems with a runny pie. I believe this is because I used the granny smith apples as called for. Tart apples have more pectin to them which prevents a runny pie. The tartness of the apples blended beautifully with the sugar syrup. Using sweet apples would probably yield a too-sweet runny pie. Thanks for the recipe - my family loved it.

This was my second apple pie and after reading all the reviews, I had to try it.  I LOVE THIS PIE and have found my apple pie recipe!  It turned  out just as expected and was much better than my first one (which was a different recipe). I used three Macintosh, two Granny Smith and two Braeburns. I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon and also added a TBSP of cinnamon & Vanilla extract to the syrup mixture.  I too mixed the apples with the syrup, then added them to the pie crust.  I was very careful not to add a lot of extra syrup to the pie (I shook the apples of extra liquid). I cheated and used Pillsbury frozen pie crust, but everytime I use it, my friends ask me if it's homemade!  I did not use the lattice top.  The only problem I had was that once I added the flour to the butter, it came out lumpy. I added water to the flour first and got all the lumps out, then added it to the butter as one reviewer suggested, but still no luck. I think my butter was too hot. Any suggestions?  Either way, the lumps became slightly smaller and still turned out great after pouring on apples.  Also, I followed the Pillsbury tip and pre-heated my cookie sheet while I was busy making the pie. This may be why I was able to avoid the extra liquid and mushy bottom that occurred with my first pie.  I think my pie will be gone in one day!

I have made this pie 4 times since Thanksgiving and it has definitely been a hit. It is the first "fresh" apple pie I've ever made and each time it has come out looking like I've been making pies for years. Please go the "easy route" and buy Pillsbury "ready-made" crusts found in the "buscuit" section of the store--it comes with top and bottom crust and they work perfectly for this recipe.  I like to add 1 teaspoon cinnamon, but it is very good both ways.  Don't be afraid to pour the sugar paste on top of the lattice work crust.  It has come out perfect every time I've made it.  One thing I especially like about this pie is that the granny smith apples add the right amount of tartness to the sweetness of the sugar paste.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Fantastic pie!  Coworkers told me it was the best apple pie they've ever had!!  I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon, two shakes of nutmeg, and a 1/2 cup of walnut chips to the apples though.  I also recommend making the sauce AFTER everthing else is already ready, so you can just pour it on.  The first time I made it, I did the sauce first, and it cooled before I could pour it on, didn't make for such a great pie!  The second time I did it last, and it was FANTASTIC!

This is the most awesome recipe, baked just as written.  I have tried to mix the liquid with the apples before putting the lattice crust on as some reviewers have suggested and found it is only as good if you reserve some to brush over the lattice after applying it.  You have to pour it slowly if you don't do that, but it is much better with the liquid over the crust also.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

My little girl really wanted to make an apple pie with me this last Christmas, something we've NEVER done before. This recipe was super easy and so good! The two of us have definitely started a new family tradition. The only change I made was to sprinkle cinnamon over the apples before I laid on the crust. I do think I'll pour 3/4 of the caramel in before laying down the crust next time and then brush the rest of it over the crust because, after refrigerating, the crust did become a bit soggy.

Best pie ever! Making the lattice is worth it, turns out beautifully and the caramel doens't burn. I did add a bit of cinnamon, and maybe next time some vanilla.

I made this pie exactly as written, as I think it's only fair to do that first before making additions or substitutions. I thought it was just unusal enough to pique my interest! It was very, very good! I loved the brown sugar/butter topping over the top but I definitely think it could have used a hint of cinnamon. Maybe because that is what I'm used to in an apple pie. My husband and son LOVED it and want this to be the only apple pie I make. It was very easy to do and it comes out looking beautiful. I will make again with just a touch of cinnamon. Great pie!

I tried this recipe and it was a disaster. I added the flour to the butter and never got a paste. I added more flour and still never got a paste. I proceeded through the rest of the recipe and when I poured the sauce over the lattice it didn't go down it just piled up on top of the lattice and looked terrible. The dough that was on top of the pie, the aforementioned lattice, became slimy and weighed down. I had high hopes for my pie but alas poor results

I have made this delicious apple pie three times already and it is gone in minutes.  One was for a pot luck, one was for an after church meeting and of course the first one was for my family.  Went over great.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Mmmm.. This pie was so good my boyfriend almost ate the whole thing in one day! I did add 1/2 T of cinnamon to the apples and 1 t of vanilla to the liquid mix as suggested by others. Quick & easy apple pie. Thank you Grandma Ople!

It was really yummy!  I made it last Thanksgiving and will make it again this year.  Here are my modifications: a) double the liquid  b) I added some vanilla and cinnamon  c) I only used 6 apples, 3 granny smith and 3 others types mixed)  d) used apple juice instead of water  e) used splenda instead of sugar  f) brushed the pastry top with egg wash

I always use less apples, and my pie always sinks! Oh well, it still tastes great! More like a Caramel Apple Pie than traditional apple pie. Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg if you prefer that taste, however I like it just the way it is!

This recipe turned out PERFECTLY! I was worried, because I let the syrup sti and cool by accident, so it was almost too thick, but it still worked beautifully. I did take the other user's advice and add a bit of vanilla to the syrup and tossed the apples in cinnamon. The french pastry pie crust is the perfect compliment to this great recipe!

If my boyfriend's comments are any testament to how wonderful this is, you have to try this if you're still on the fence.  He literally raved for 2 days - on and on about how this was the BEST apple pie he's ever had.  The pie didn't even last a full 24 hours.  I was skeptical because it didn't call for cinnamon and next time, I just may add it, but it's still wonderful without it.  As another reviewer aptly described, it's got a golden buttery taste. I used what apples I had (Ida Red)and opted to pour the butter mixture over the apples before I put the top crust on; seemed easier and less messy that way.  I'll also bake at 350 for the entire time so as to avoid burning the crust.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This recipe is on this site twice; under its other name it is "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople", which I made over the weekend. It's fantastic. If you need to see more tips and reviews, you can go look at the other version of this recipe to see the "top reviews" there too -- the recipes themselves are identical, but you may find more specific tips for you listed on that one :) We found this to be delicious, but a tiny bit runny. It sets up better after being refrigerated, but microwaving the slices causes it to become runny again. Tastes great, but doesn't present well! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great apple pie recipe.  After making it as directed, I agree with other reviewers that the sauce should be poured over the apples and mixed together in a bowl first, before pouring into the pie crust.  Save a bit of the sauce to pour over the lattice that you make.  Truly scrumptious and best served warm with vanilla ice cream!

The best apple pie ever (and I have made and tried a lot of them!)  Awesome!  Only addition was adding cinnamon, a little flour and lemon juice to the apples.  Fantastic!

I had high hopes for this pie, but I am not a fan. :(  Too sweet, flavor is lacking, and the apples didn't get soft before the sugar mixture on top was starting to burn.

All I keep saying is OMG this is delicious. Everything about this pie is top notch. I absolutely loved it! I'm a caramel lover so this just hit that spot for me. I did add a Tbsp of cinnamon to the apples as others have said and I also did what the last person said and mixed the filling in the bowl with the apples...it coated them nicely. I also added a tsp of vanilla extract to the filling came out great. I highly reccommend this recipie.

I live in Ireland and people here do NOT like cinnamon so I needed a recipe for applie pie that didn't involve spice. This pie is a dream, easy to make, smells heavenly, and everyone I have ever made it for asks for the recipe. Don't change a thing, just enjoy the sweet simplicty of apples and pastry. Thanks Grandma Ople!

I have made this recipe so many times! It's amazing. Just one question for anyone out there: how do I avoid it being too watery? When I serve it, it always falls apart. It tastes great but the presentation is not good because of this. Any ideas would be wonderful!

This was a great pie...once I stuck to the origional recipe.  I made the mistake of putting in heavy cream for the water, which totally changed the taste of the pie. I made two pies; one w/ latice and one w/ a crumble topping.  The second time I made it, I did it exactly as directed w/ the exception of tossing the apples in cinnamon and 2 tsp vanilla.  A big diffrence in the pie is the apples: Granny Smith is too tart w/ no sweetness.  All the rest fall apart while baking and doesn't hold its sweetness.  The best apples to use are the Golden Delicious green apples; a little tartness w/ sweetness.  I also tossed in the sauce reserving a lttle for the topping.  I drizzled caramel across the top before placing the lattice.  Very good pie.  UPDATE:  To keep the pie from having juice all over the place, as well as a too juicy pie, add 2 tbsp of quick cooking tapioca to the apple mixture.  The pie will hold better.

This worked beautifully for me on the first try, using the tip from others to put most of the sauce on the apples, then brushing a bit over the lattice (since how much gets into the filling, runs off or sits on the top depends on how tightly you do your lattice - if I do a more open lattice next time, I'll just drizzle the sauce).  I sliced the Granny Smiths about 1/4 to 1/3-inch thick on average so they cooked through beautifully.  I had huge, local apples so I just filled the pie using what fit which was about 5 of these apples - I had to just see what fit in my particular pie plate so I did follow the directions - filled and mounded the apples slightly.  There are few recipes I feel like I'll stick with after the first try, but this is a definite!

How sweet it is!!!!  Today for the first time in my life, I had some hand picked apples from Ellijay Georgia.  So I began my search for a recipe, and stumbled upon this one. It was divine..mouth-watering and oh so sweet.  I did add cinnamon, and some nutmeg, but for the rest I stayed true to the recipe.  It came out purrrfect!  My crust was delicious, and the apples I used simply heavenly.  I will never use another recipe again.  This will always be on my table, and with each first bite, my appreciation goes out to Rebecca for sharing her Grandma Ople's apple pie recipe.

Very good, very easy to make, kids loved it. As others did, I mixed the apples with part of the sugar mixture and then poured the rest over the top. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice, which resolved the too-sweet issue and gave it a nice twist.

Excellent pie!  I added a bit of cinnamon to the mixture and stirred the apples in half of the sauce, then poured the rest over the crust.  It came out perfect.

This is the best apple pie i've ever eaten in my life! I did make some changes thou. I upped the sauce by half and used 1 more tbs of flour than the recipe called for, used 5 Granny Smiths sliced thickly so that it'll be chewier, and added 2 tbs cinammon to the apples. I placed a layer of apples on the crust then poured some of the sauce over it then another layer of apples and the sauce, finishing it by spreading the sauce on the lattice top. I've got no problem with the sauce overflowing, probably bcos i used a 10 inch pan. I left it to cool for a while and the sauce settled nicely and firmly without being too messy. It looks picture perfect and the top crust was to die for!

Made this tonight and it was awesome! Used a store-brand crust and it was still delish! Added cinnamon to sugar/butter mixture.

This was a hot for me!  I always laugh at people who alter recipes but I did the following: used pre-made crust, added some cinnamon to apples, no lattice top (just slits on regular pie top), added the syrup to apples before putting in pie shell and saved a bit to brush on top. I personally love the simplicity of the ingredients.  I had everything but a couple of apples and the crust!
A yummy treat for hubby and I.  Looking forward to leftovers and perhaps sharing with family for Thanksgiving!

I took SDTERP (May 2008) advice and made this pie per recipe...not modifications.  It was delicious!  It has a buttery caramel taste versus a spicey one.  Also, if you're like me and pie crusts have never been your strong suit, pouring the butter/sugar mixture over the lattice work top (Pillsbury ready made crust) makes the store bought crust taste SO good!

This is the best apple pie I've ever had! I made a few (reviewer recommended) changes: 1. Tossed the apples with cinnamon and lemon juice before putting them in the pie. 2. Pre-Baked the pie crust. 

Other than those, I followed the recipe exactly -- WOW. Just wow. No need for whipped cream or other toppings, even.

Have been using this recipe for about two years now! Every time it is such a treat! Last time, i also added a layer of cranberries to have a little bit of zest - in that case you will need to make a little bit more of caramel/sugar sauce.

Amazingly good! I had never seen an apple pie without cinnamon, but this one does't need it. I was searching for one without it due to allergies. I will be making this one! My search is over. Not too sweet & simple to do.  It got rave reviews from the family too!

This is my very first review on allrecipes, this pie was so good, that I had to add to the already stellar raves. 
I used 7 small/medium sized Granny Smith apples, added a 1tablespoon of vanilla to the mix (and omitted a tablespoon of water like the many suggestions) and it was ah-mazing! When making the caramel sauce I melted the butter first as per the directions and then added the flour one spoonful at time, stirring in between to really incorporate it- I didn't let it boil, but made sure that all the sugar was dissolved. I tossed the apple slices in lemon juice and then added a little more than half of the sauce to them and gave them a stir before pouring them into the pie crust. I brushed the remaining sauce over the lattice top- just so we didn't miss out on the crust everyone was mentioning.
This pie was fantastic! I was a little afraid that it was going to be too sweet, but Grandma Ople sure knew what she was doing! Perfection. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It will be gracing many tables in the future!

I made this and it was delicious...I have to make another one for today! My only problem was a technical one, I couldn't get the butter and flour mixture to form a paste. What was I doing wrong. I threw away my first attempt and did it again with less butter and more flour. Help! was my butter too hot? I used salted butter, what that the problem?

The flavor was fabulous, like eating a caramel apple - in pie.  The only negative was that the filling was pretty runny.  I think next time I'll try tossing the apples with some flour before putting them in the crust to thicken it up.

Super good! I don't have much to add to the rave reviews, but I did add cinnamon like many others did. I wasn't too sure about the "pour the syrup over the lattice crust" method, it seemed like more of it was sticking to the crust than going underneath, but the filling was definitely syrupy enough and the glazed crust was awesome! Will definitely make this one again the next time I need an apple pie!

This was delicious!  Made for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I added cinnamon to the apples because I like my cinnamon in an apple pie :-)  Otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  8 apples was the right amount for a 9 inch deep dish.  Next time, I will probably slice the apples a little thinner and use a mix of apples instead of all granny smith as they were just a little too tart and a little too firm.  I will also probably pour most of the sauce on the apples directly and then brush some on the lattice work after.  I think the lattice work really does visually make this pie - it is worth the extra effort and is really not that difficult - check out instructions on youtube if you've never done it before :-)

This was delicious!  Made for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I added cinnamon to the apples because I like my cinnamon in an apple pie :-)  Otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  8 apples was the right amount for a 9 inch deep dish.  Next time, I will probably slice the apples a little thinner and use a mix of apples instead of all granny smith as they were just a little too tart and a little too firm.

i know everyone keeps saying this pie is delish.... its because it is and i will say it too! only reason for 4 stars is because it really does need i little help.  After peeling and slicing my apples (i used 3 green and 2 regular red apples) I put them in a bowl with 1 tbs cinnamon and 1 tbs lemon juice and mixed them all together and let it sit while doing the rest.  For the sauced i did add 1 tbs cinnamon and 1 tbs vanilla (and took out 1 tbs of water) which i think did the trick for the runny sauce because it was perfect.  i tossed the sauce in the bowl of apples and mixed it in before I filled the pie. (egg wash really does help prevent soggy crust inside) and brushed excess sauce all over outer crust. baked the entire time at 350 for 55 min on the middle rack.   My husband isnt a pie fan but let me tell you, half the pie was gone in a matter of minutes!!

Not sure if I did something wrong, but we did not like this.  Followed recipe, but did follow suggestion and added cinnamon and vanilla which I think helped.  My children love apple pie, but did not like this one.

i read the reviews and even though it was a srtraight forward recipe i was curious to see how it differs  from the rest. I made it wsily within 30 minutes andmy aunt and mother loved it ( they are very harsh critics) so It was a hit. ps. I had a lot of the sugar substance left over so i did  not use it all( i was afriad it would be too sweet) but none the less it was gorgeous. thanks i will be keeping this recipe.

This was my first apple pie EVER.  My husband does not like apple pie but this one he cant get enough of!!  I followed everyone's advice and added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla but I added it to the sugar/butter mixture instead.  I simmered it for 5min as asked then turned off the heat, let it cool just a little and then added cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg.  I didnt make my own crust (in case my first attempt sucked) and bought those pie shells.  As I stared to lay out the apples along the bottom of the shell in an overlapping spiral, I would spoon the mixture over each layer.  8 apples turned out to be too much but I did get slightly larger than average apples so 6 did me nicely.  Poured the remainder of the sauce on top of the apples (I piled them slightly to make sure that the second pie shell can fit easily over it upside-down) and topped with the other pie shell (do not remove the tin cover from it until last 20min of baking to prevent over browning).  It actually took 50-55min for me not 35-45 but it may be different because I have a gas stove.  DEFINITELY put the whole thing on a cookie sheet as it WILL leak.  Set it out to cool and only once it cools, break the top pie shell into chunks with a fork.  Et Voila!  Bon Apetit!

I'm sure this tastes great as written, but I made just a few tweaks! First, I tossed 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg in with the chopped apples. I followed the recipe for the sugar/flour/butter mixture, using margarine as that was all I had on hand.  BUT, I poured this over the apples BEFORE I put the crust on. Then I gently glazed the remaining mixture on the crust (used French Pastry Pie Crust). Baked with the times suggested! TASTES AMAZING!!!!!!!

Best pie I've ever made!  Everyone who ate it enjoyed it a lot.  I used mixed apples from the orchard, but think Macintosh are the best.  I didn't use any granny smith apples any of the times I've made it.

This is a lovely recipe for what it is, but people must take into account that this is a traditional apple pie, hence the omission of cinnamon. I will rate it 5 stars for the traditional recipe that it is. That being said, I would add 3/4 to 1 tbsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples for my taste. Don't add it to the sugar/butter if you want a pie with a perfect non-muddy brown appearance. This turned out amazing and was a real crowd pleaser. If you are going to make homemade apple pie, don't scrimp on the crust. Go homemade! You can do it!!

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Very tasty, even from those who aren't apple pie lovers.  I made my first one with a lattice crust and it turned out not just delicious, but beautiful to look at as well.  I used half G. Smith, and half Golden delicious apples.  I also added cinnamon to the apples.  I am going to try this again with a streusel topping, serve warm with ice cream.  Yummy!

I made my first one with a lattice crust and it turned out not just delicious, but beautiful to look at as well.  I used half G. Smith, and half Golden delicious apples.  I also added cinnamon to the apples.  I am going to try this again with a streusel topping, serve warm with ice cream.  Yummy!

This apple pie was delicious and simple, and pouring the caramel over the lattice top crust made it absolutely gorgeous and golden. Everyone loved it!

This had to be the BEST smelling apple pie ever!  My family kept asking  "Mmmmm, what is THAT"?  Even my neighbor could smell it baking!  I used a variety of apples and topped it with the Fruit Pie Crumb Topping from this site.  The pie was not overly juicy where the juices run out once cut and they were well retained within the filling.  It sliced beautifully!  I don't like it when you mound the apples, top with the crust and once baked the crust stays high and mounded while the apples sink.  The Fruit Pie Crumb Topping worked out great!  I did not want it to over bake so I cooked my pie without any topping for 30 minutes.  I then pressed the apples down a bit and loaded up the crumb topping.  I finished the pie for the directed baking time and my crumb topping came out perfectly moist and not crunchy.  The pie sank like expected and the crumb topping stayed on top and didn't have that empty space between it and the apples.  The best recipe we have ever had for apple pie! Perfect, don't change a thing!!

I made this pie and all I have to say is that my Grandpa brought tears to my eyes when he told me it tasted just like they way my Grandma used to make them.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

WOW. It sounded like a strange method, but with so many reviews, I just had to try it. This recipe rocks. Hands down excellent. I tweaked it only to add cinnamon and vanilla to the apples before putting them in the crust. Other than that, its perfect!

Fantastic. My first pie/pastry/dessert (I'm a new cook). Splendid outcome.  As suggested by many, I added cinnamon (1/2 tsp), vanilla extract (1 tsp) & nutmeg (1/4 tsp) to the sauce. Put 3/4 of sauce on apples and 1/4 over lattice pastry (allrecipes' "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe - another 5-star classic).  Only thing I will do differently next time is MIX the sauce and the apples as suggested by others.  Couldn't wait 4-5 hours for it to cool ... my son & I waited 30 mins and then got stuck into a very juicy but fantastic pie.  Recipe deserves its accolades, thanks Moshasmama.

This pie is phenomenal.  I have made it twice, as written, and will add cinnamon to the apples next time.  Everyone goes on and on about how good it is, and it is so easy!

Delicious and easy! The hardest part about it was peeling the apples (I don't have a mechanism to do it). I like the apples to be soft and this is the first recipe that actually made them soft (I sliced the apples VERY thinly). If you still like them a little crisp, you can make the apple slices a little thicker. Betty Crocker has nothing on this recipe! I also added some cinnamon to the butter/sugar mixture and it was yummy. Rave reviews from my friends and family and while it's not like this recipe is drastically different from anything I've ever tried, it's still the BEST!

I am about to make this pie for the second time, and I can't wait! It was sooo good last time. I agree with the others about never needing 8 apples and adding cinnamon. I love the lattice crust and my husband is impressed by it!   One tip-- no need to prebake the crust, but definitely lightly sprinkle the inside of the bottom crust with plain old white sugar. It keeps it from getting soggy and even slightly caramelizes. Delicious!

Better than my mom's and I love how it looks with the lattice top. This is the only recipe I use for apple pie. I do add some cinnamon to the sauce before pouring over the pie.

I made this pie yesterday, and it is AMAZING!  I didn't do a lattice top because I stink at them, so I just placed a whole crust over the top and did some decorative cut-outs.  Since I did it that way, I went ahead and added all the sugar mixture to the filling, but then sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar over the top of the crust.  So yummy!

I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves to the apples before I put the lattice on. It gave it a nice spicy bite to the pie and it was wonderful and gooey! My husband is also very picky about his apple pie. He said "this is the best apple pie I have ever had!" I have to agree!!

Yum!  I made this pie last year and didn't like it.  Afraid I have been used to frozen Mrs. Smiths for so long.  Then I decided to make again, but saw from a review on another apple pie recipe that it is best to use a variety of different apples.  I used Macintosh, Jonathan & Cortland apples.  I added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla to the apples.  I poured most of mixture over apples and reserved about 1/4 c to put on top of crust (did not do lattice, but just cut slits into pie).  It was so good!  Thank you for the recipe and thanks to other reviewers for their helpful tips!  Cooked 15 min at 425 and then 35 at 350 and it was perfectly done!

Really good pie.  I do wish there were instructions on how long to cook the sugar mixture.  I think I cooked mine too long and then corrected it by adding a little water.  It still turned out really good.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples.  It's ok to mound the apples high.  They shrink down in the cooking process.  Use a foil lined baking sheet underneath your pie pan!

I did not like this at all. If you have never made a apple pie before you may be happy with this. But I had an awesome traditional apple pie recipe. I thought I would try this instead, just for something different. It turned out too sweet, more like Carmel apples. I also don't like the idea of the lattice top. It takes so much more time. Making apple pie from scratch ought to give you the right to just put a solid top on. Sorry this is just not my family's apple pie recipe. We like cinnamon to much.

This was delicious! I simmered the apples in the filling instead of pouring the filling over the top, and also added a teaspoon of vanilla. The best apple pie I've ever had!

This is my apple pie recipe from now on! It is sooooo delicious and it looked so gorgeous when it came out the oven I had to take a picture. I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I added was to mix 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg in with the apples and to brush milk on the top of the crust before pouring the sugar mixture on. Next time, I will also brush milk on the bottom of the crust as other reviewers have suggested, to keep it from becoming soggy. Definitely follow the recipe and pour the sugar mixture on top of the pie. It makes the crust come out all sweet and crunchy and makes for an excellent presentation- I think it even helps to hide any imperfections in your lattice crust! Another tip- place a cookie sheet under the pie while baking. This pie is very juicy and some of the juices spill while baking.

i've used this recipe 2 times already and it is sooo good!  everyone who has tried it raves about how much they like it.
i add the cinnamon to the apples; its a tasty touch.
just be careful when pouring the sauce on if doing lattace because the hot sauce can melt the dough and make a hot mess!!  i'm using this recipe for thanksgiving this year. i love it thanks!!

Fantastic!!!  I followed the tips of other reviewers re: tossing the cinnamon & vanilla into the peeled apples first, and also the tip about pouring most of the caramel sauce over the apples (after they're in the bottom crust), and then after placing the top crust on, brushing the remaining caramel sauce on top (instead of sprinkling with sugar). My family LOVED this pie!!!  And it was so beautiful!  Best pie I've ever made!

I went through a lot of trouble to find the perfect crust recipe. It is very tedious,but turns out a delicious buttery flaky crust. I needed a recipe for the pie filling and found this. I used it because of all the great reviews. First I found the fact that this recipe does not call for vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg odd, so I added it. Otherwise I followed the directions directly. I am an experienced baker.Even though the apples are not pre-cooked in this recipe, like called for in many others, they turn out mushy. It was like eating applesauce between ruined pie crust. The pie crust was ruined by the thick sugar sauce you pour over the lattice. Not only does the sauce make the top crust very hard, it lends little to no flavor to the pie and makes it look anything but appetizing. The pie looked burned when it was finished.I'm a big fan of Mrs. Smith's deep dish apple pie. It's becoming harder to find in supermarkets and I have a growing passion for baking. I'm used to a nice flaky crust with somewhat firm apples and a sweet cinnamon taste. This pie completely missed the mark. Attempt at your own risk.

Now, that was a pie.  So good, so good!  I followed the recipe to a "t" but sprinkled some cinnamon over the apples (i mean, hello).  I used a butter pie dough crust and didnt do a lace top (kinda new to this and could figure it out) but not fear, the compliments from my guests were enough to make me feel like I owe Grandma Ople a big hug.  To a great recipe (holding up coffee mug)....CHEERS!

WOW! So easy and really really good! My husband LOVES apple pie and said it was the best one ever! I did not latice the top, I just laid some vertical then some horizontal and it came out fine and I too mixed all ingredients together and saved a little sauce for the top! TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!! GREAT RECIPE!!

Made this pie tonight (trial-run for Thanksgiving) - it was great! I did add 3/4 t. cinnamon, however.  The lattice crust turned a beautiful color and tasted fantastic. Thanks!

I made this last year for my in-laws and they loved it. I made it twice, first following the directions to a T. The second time I used a frozen pie crust on the bottom and pie dough on top. I used a fork along the edges to keep it uniform. Both ways turned out great. Will be making again this Thanksgiving (special request).

Tastes just like my grandmothers used to, and I've been searching for that taste for 35 years. I used honeycrisp apples and they were perfect for this pie. Next time I will try LadyJayPee's method of additional low temp baking to get the apples more done; also I will mix all the flour/sugar mixture with the apples instead of reserving part for the top. I added vanilla & cinnamon to the liquid. Outstanding recipe!

I made two of these pies at once.  The first one I forgot to simmer the sugar mixture, AND forgot the water, but the pie still turned out delicous!!!  The second time I followed the recipe almost, just shook the apples in a bit of cinnamon and sugar (as previously suggested) and tossed them in the sugar mixture before baking and brushed the lattice top with the rest of the mixture.  It turned out ALMOST as good as the first, I found it just a bit too sweet with the extra sugar on the apples. 
You can't go wrong with this recipe, everyone who tried them loved them!

This is absolutely the best apple pie recipe I have ever made.  I don't have the patience for the lattice top, so I just pour the sauce over the apples before I put the top crust on.  Soooo gooood!!!!

I made this recipe several times and it comes out perfect each time.  I do a few different things, though.  My Granny Smith apples are sometimes very sour, so I add about 1/8 - 1/4 cup more white sugar to my recipe.  I also add about 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon as well, with a pinch of all spice.  I mix half of the sugar/butter mixture with the apples... then pour the other half over the lattice top to make it a bit easier.  Make sure to put a baking sheet under your pie as it bubbles over each time I make it.  This is an excellent recipe and have been requested to bring this pie for pot lucks.  Thanks for the recipe!!

So, so good.  This recipe cannot fail, and it's shockingly easy.  Used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe (it really is!) which is on this site.  Don't forget: the key to great apple pie is EXTREMELY thin apple slices.  This recipe almost makes me want to splurge on one of those old-fashioned apple peeler/corers so I can make it more often!

My recipe didn't turn out!  I think the only things I didn't do were I used salted butter instead of unsalted and then I didn't allow the sauce to sit on the stovetop and simmer...the sauce thickened up-the butter didn't blend well at all and now the whole pie is ruined.  Can someone help me??

If you'd like a picture worthy pie - try this recipe!  It's not only beautiful, it's delicious.  The only change i made was adding 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the apples and pouring HALF of the sauce inside the crust and the other half on the outside.  And as one reviewer advised, i used a pastry brush to cover the entire lattice crust.  this is what gives the pie that glossy, deep golden color so be sure not to skip this step.  i used a ready made crust in from the supermarket dairy case that has 2 in a box. you just unfold them and put them on your pie pan.  I also used a very nifty device that saves so much time when making a lattice style crust.  it's a pie crust sized cookie cutter with a checkerboard pattern on the inside.  u press down on your crust and poke out the little squares - whala! lattice like crust in seconds!  be sure to look for it at home stores if you like lattice crusts.  this tool is worth it's weight in gold - and so is this recipe!

There are enough fantastic reviews for this recipe.  I was sad to hear that Grandma Ople has been gone for a while but what a tribute to her that so many people have shared her technique.

Added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1tsp vanilla to the sauce as recommended by another reviewer.  Amazing!  I also used macintosh apples instead of Granny Smiths because I am not huge on sour desserts, but I think with the sweet carmely taste of the sauce it would be really good with Granny Smiths too, or maybe 1/2 and 1/2.

Always a winner this one. I have made it several times. I prefer not to use the lattice crust and just put a normal pie crust on top after pouring the mixture and I baste with milk and sprinkle some sugar. I also cook it on a lower temp as I find it overbrowns otherwise. Thans for sharing!

I am so proud that I made a successful apple pie using this recipe. This is my husband's favorite dessert, and I had all but given up after several tries over the years, I had decided I was not a pie maker.  However, I made this one; only change: apple juice in place of water, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a solid crust instead of lattice.  Voila! Perfect and delicious.  I enjoyed the entire experience, and hubby is still enjoying the pie.  Good thing we had French Vanilla ice cream in the freezer to top it off!  Thank you for posting this recipe. Next I will try my hand with a lattice crust.  Did Grandma Ople have a peach pie recipe, by any chance?  Because that is my favorite!

I have made this pie twice now, after the first was I was asked to make one for a co-workers birthday pie.  I took some others advice and added just a tsp of cinnamon to the apples in a bowl and stirred it around I also added just a sprinkle of allspice to the apples and stirred.  I took the advice and had the pie prepped though and ready before I started the sugar mixture on the stove.  That way once that was ready I could just pour over the pie and put in the over quickly, once that starts cooling down it will not pour easily and your will have a mess on your hands.  Get your apples peeled and cut and in the crust with the lattice top ready before you work the sugar mixture (best advice I read).  This turned out absolutely gorgeous and tasty.  I will be making this recipe for years to come.  THANKS for a great recipe....

Not usually a pie maker but my family loves them so I gave this one a shot and boy were we all very happy.  This apple pie is so easy to make and super delicious.  We loved the Carmel mixture you pour over the apples.  We used fresh picked apples from our recent apple picking trip and sprinkled cinnamon over them.  Used a store bought pie shell and we did not do lattice work as to make it easier and it still came awesome.  Thanks for this recipe grandma Ople, My family loved it!!!

Family pleaser! I've looked for years for a good apple pie recipe and this is it!  Only modified the recipe by stirring the apples with the sauce in a separate bowl before adding to the pie crust to evenly coat all the apples pieces.  Then placed apple mixture into the pie pan, used 1/4 stick of cold better and cut into small pieces and dropped onto apples and then sprinkled apples with cinnamon.  Instead of a top crust, cut pieces of dough and also dropped onto top of apple mixture.  More cobbler like, but can't say enough about how good it tasted!

This recipe is great!  I read someone else's review who said they were unhappy with the recipe.  However, they also mentioned that they mixed the sugar and butter mixture with the apples instead of pouring it on the crust as directed.  The crust gets so yummy with the mixture poured on top!

Best apple pie I've ever had. I add a cap (bottle cap) full of vanilla extract to the butter sauce.  I don't lattice the crust, I use a full crust but have saved back a little of the sauce and I paint the top of the crust with it for the last 20 minutes.

This is a favorite with my family and friends. What I do is, saute the apples in the sauce pan and cook them till they are soft before I fill the crust. Big hit in our home. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I am not really a fan of apple pie, but I made this (with no modifications except for using a mix of apples) for a 4th of July family cookout (what's more American than Apple Pie?) and it was really good! I used a deep dish frozen pie crust (brushed with milk as advised), and roll-up refrigerated crust for my lattice.     

Everyone loved it and it looked absolutely amazing... So amazing that I took pictures & sent them to my friends! Thanks Grandma Ople!

Make sure your apples are as crisp as possible.  If they are the least bit mushy, you will get a cobler rather than a pie (still tastes wonderful, but to runny to serve as a pie)

Used macintosh apples - this was awesome.  This will be my go-to recipe for apple pie.

Couldn't ask for a better apple pie. I used salted butter as well as added dashes of salt and cinnamon. I also added some blackberries. Only complaint is that the pie was runny. Maybe I could of cooked it longer or do less sauce? I mixed half of the sauce with the apples and drizzled the remaining sauce on top. I did a crumb topping so I did 1/2 cup of sugar inside and 1/2 cup for the crumb top (mixed with flour cinnamon and butter). Next time I made this recipe I am going to try to do 1/4 less sugar

I almost hesitate to rate this since it already has so many good ratings. However, as I'm getting ready to make another pie, I just had to share. 

This pie was Amazing!  The sauce that goes on the pie is like the best caramel-y sauce ever. I could literally eat it with a spoon by itself.

Everyone so far has enjoyed this pie. The *only* thing I changed in the recipe is that I split the apples between Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, just to reduce the tartness just a bit.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a huge hit at last nights' dinner party!! I used the slightly modified recipe with cornstarch and 2extra Tbs flour plus additional seasonings.  I've never made pie with some of the syrup on top of the lattice, but it turned out great!

This was the very first fruit pie I ever made!  I made a homemade crust for it and then followed the recipe exactly - except adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. 

My family LOVES it.  I mean, I got comments like 'best ever' from my dad and brother; 'restaurant quality' from my daughter. 

Great recipe! Super easy - just make sure you use a firm apple and you thicken up the caramel sauce well.

I made this for our Christmas dinner and followed the recipe exactly, and it was no doubt one of the best apple pies I have ever made.  It will definitely be in my holiday repertoire next year.  Really, try it.

Definitely the best apple pie! I also followed some of the advices here, such as adding cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the apples and some cloves. The main thing I would do differently is that I would not do the lattice; instead, would covered the apples with the entire top crust and I would add all the syrup to the apples.  I think the lattice gets too crunchy. I used 3 gala apples, 3 machintosh and 3 greanny.

Not much of a baker until 2 years ago and pies are a fav. I have made this as is 2x and also tweaked it a time or two. Best to me is a homemade butter double crust with Northern Spy or Jonagolds, 1 -2 Tbsp of lemon juice over apples makes a brighter flavor and 1 tsp of cinnamon. But you cannot go wrong if making it as is, it's that good!!! Thanx G'Ma Ople!

This is a very tastey apple pie! I used Gala & Honey Crisp apples, 4 & 4. And a 9 inch, deep dish pie pan. Pleanty of apples. The method is easy for those who have never made a pie like this before. And I baked mine the full 45 minutes. Also tossed mine with cinnamon as suggested. Will make again!

Im giving this 4 stars even though I havent tasted it yet.  It is currently baking.  Only 4 stars because it was difficult to pour the sauce over the lattice and 8 apples appear to be too many.  I should have read other posts that suggests mixing sauce with apples  I hope it tastes as good as others say

This recipe is amazing.  Every time I make it people freak out about how good it is.  I add in cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to the portion of the butter-flour-sugar mixture mixed in with the apples.  I think it's important to toss the apples with the mixture and not just pour on top.  Also, be very careful not to overheat the butter-sugar mixture and make sure you have everything completely ready to go - crust, apples - before you start the butter-flour-sugar mix, because the mixture will become caramelized and too tough to work with very quickly.

I don't usually do a lattice pie, but just a standard double crust with some leaf cutouts for decoration.

Make this pie, you'll never be sorry!

I have been looking for a good apple pie recipe for ages, and this one is perfect.  I braided the top loosely so that the sugar mix would drip into the pie.  Everyone loved this one, my mother-in-law even asked me for the recipe after trying it.  Make sure to use unsalted butter, and use apples that are a bit tart.. I used MacIntosh since they were in season.  I also learned that in order for it to cook properly, cook on the lowest rack in the oven.  Best recipe I've tried so far, and it's going into my recipe box!

Tasted fantastic!!! My only complaint is that this is watery.  Next time I will not add water because I feel that the apples naturally make enough juice!  But definetly a great recipe!!!

WOW!  I'm hooked. I was so excited to make this pie after reading tons of the reviews (ya, I got that kind a time) and I can say, my whole family was so pleased!  It was awesome!  I mixed half of the syrup with the apples and poured the rest over the lattice.  Next time, I'll follow the recipe and pour all the syrup over/thru the lattice, it's the best part of this pie!  Try it!!!!

I made this apple pie twice with granny smiths that I got from the same store. The apples were very mushy almost like apple sauce. Although it was delicious and the best tasting flavor. What am I doing wrong? Or, was something wrong with the apples

Good taste and everyone said they enjoyed it, but I personally didn't care for the crunchy topping on this pie.  I think if I made it again I would add the liquid and then top with the crust.  Other than that it was tasty and enjoyable.  Also, I think I'd cook just a little longer as the bottom crust ws a bit underdone.

Very easy to make.  It was my first try at a pie and it came out great!!  The natural flavor from the apples really comes out without the flavor of cinnamon and nutmeg overpowering it.  Great recipe!

I misread the directions when making this pie and poured the sauce over the apples then put my lattice crust into place. It turned out wonderful regardless and the crust recipe I got from this site made my pie flaky, crumbly and delicious!

This pie is delicious. It's always a hit when I bake it for parties and get-togethers. I do usually make a few modifications.  I sprinkled cinnamon and vanilla onto the apple slices after I spread them in the crust. I also don't use a lattice crust. I felt like the crust taste would overpower the taste of the apples. Lastly, 8 apples is too many. I use something like 5 or 6 large apples.

This pie is excellent! It is always a huge hit and turns out so well everytime! I pop the pie crust in the oven before I put the apples in to brown it a little. It gives the bottom a nice crunch!

I used ambrosia apples which tasted great; they are on the mild side. I did add 1 Tbl. of vanilla and 1tsp. of cinnamon.  The sauce and apples are mixed together. I use Pillsbury refrigeratored crusts. For the top layer I use a rolling pin to make the dough thinner and then I cut it into strips to make a lattice work.  The pie is worth the effort.

Delicious!  Cut your apples thick, because they thin out when they cook.  Also, when I poured the sauce over the pie, the crust started to melt.  I thought they pie was a failure, but stuck it in the over anyway.  The crust rose and ended up looking great!

This pie was excellent! I would decrease the sugar a tad bit and I added a teaspoon of Cinnamon, vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. It was delicious. I used the french country pie crust and was that ever good. This is a keeper!

I just made this pie at Thanksgiving and it is the talk of my foodie family.  So easy and so tasty.  I made a bunch as Christmas gifts this year and got rave reviews!    I used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honey crisp apples.  I tossed them with flour and cinnamon before putting them in the crust.  I didn't do the lattice top but poured the mixture over the apples and topped with another crust, as other reviewers have done.

WOW! Great pie! Loved the taste of it. I did add some cinnamon along with vanilla and it came out a little runny. But I think its because I did not take some of the water out. Will be making it again.

WOW! Great pie! Loved the taste of it. I did add some cinnamon along with vanilla and it came out a little runny. But I think its because I did not take some of the water out. Will be making it again.

I've made this pie numerous times so far, and have yet to change anything other than adding some cinnamon.  My family thinks that I'm a baking genius, and "forces" me to make this every holiday.  I "complain" and give in.  All the while smiling, and saying a big thank you for making me a HUGE hit.  This is literally the best pie I've ever had.

If you make one pie this Thanksgiving - make this one. I've made this pie about 5 times now and it is a really great pie. I also got lazy and put a crumb topping on it and that was delicious too. My brother-in-law claims to be the king of apple pies. Not anymore!

I've never made a pie before.  I'm the girl who's forgotten to add flour to cookies.  In this way, I am no baker (even less of a cook).  However, a friend gave us a box of 100 + apples (gravenstein apples, mostly) and I figured I was bored enough to give it a shot.  Needles to say, and to my great surprise, I ate most the pie myself...that night!  I've never had anything like this in my life, absolutley amazing.    Strangely, I hate pies as does my friend, and neither of us could put this down.  I'm a changed woman.  The only changes I made was using salted butter instead of unsalted, using sweeter apples, and then dusting the apples in a little white sugar and cinnamon.   Now I'm just sad that I finished the last slice :(

OK, This was the first pie I have ever made and I'm so happy that I picked out this recipe to go by.  This was fast and easy and super yummy. I did add a tab. spoon of cinnamon too the sugar to give it that true apple pie taste and I made my own crust. Everyone loved it... Thanks for the recipe.

I have been baking for 40+ years and have made countless apple pies.  This is an awesome recipe. Who knew what pouring that hot syrup over my chilled lattice crust would do. WOW!  So important the crust be lattice.  I made the pie dough, rolled out bottom crust , put in pie plate , cut the strips and placed on a platter on wax paper, put all in the refrigerator to keep  chilled . I sliced the apples , added little lemon juice, fresh nutmeg and cinnamon and set aside, THEN made the syrup, that way no mistakes in consistency. It should pour freely over the pie, pour slowly.  This is absolutely the best apple pie I have ever made, and will use the same technique with my pear pies.  Grandma Ople knew what she was doing!

Wow was this pie fantastic, simple and pure tasting, like fresh from the farm.  I am not even sure what type apples I used (LOL) as we picked them a few weeks ago and figured I'd better use them up since a few had started to "go".  I have NEVER made pie without cinnamon or allspice but this pie recipe I reluctantly followed, leaving spices out, and I'm glad I did.  This gem has such a golden buttery pure taste, it sure is a keeper!  Thanks so much for sharing a piece of your Grandma with us.  Very endearing to read about

Knock your socks off good. Or at least we thought so! I did add vanilla, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the apples. And only used 6 apples. Followed the rest to a T.  Make sure to put in a deep dish apple pie crust, otherwise it overflows. Absolutely sinful heated up with vanilla ice cream!

This pie is fantastic!  I do change it up a bit though.  I add my sliced apples to the sauce on the stove to get them nice and tender before putting them in the oven.  I can't stand apple pie that has crunchy apples in it.  Secondly I add about 2-3 teaspoons of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  After the pie is finished baking the sauce is so delicious...almost like a cinnamon caramel sauce.

I added vanilla and one tsp cinnamon as suggested in reviews, I still found this pie rather tasteless, perhaps more cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg would help.  I used Granny Smith apples.

Ok this is good. I made it the first time with canned apples (uuummm yuck not loving the canned apples) but the rest of the pie was incredibly good so i ditched the apples in the pie and ate the crust with the Grandma Ople's sauce mmmm yum- so the next time i used real apples and oh yes it was good i have even made a mock apple pie using this recipe by omitting the apples  all together and using ritz crackers as the filling and doubling Grandma O's (thats what we call her in my house now) sauce and it was amazing. this is an excellent apple pie recipe one of the best-just don't use canned apples.

This is, by far, the BEST apple pie recipe I have ever made. My husband loves it.  I have made some of the adjustments that others have suggested - adding 1 T vanilla(take 1T out of the water), 1/2 t nutmeg, 1 t cinnamon. I also mix the sauce into the apples and then pour into piecrust.  This is the only apple pie I will be making from now on!

Made this pie for Thanksgiving, it was my first time. Turned out perfect and delicious! I added cinnamon and I used the Pillsbury rolled crust that you find in the refridgerator section. I made the top a lattice top design and basted it with corn syrup and granulated sugar for a nice finish on the top. Great recipe!

My husband, not a fan of pumpkin pie, loves this pie -- and I have to say, it doesn't make me miss pumpkin.  You'll definitely want to invest in an apple peeler and corer (@ $16 at Amazon), but with that and a pre-made (frozen) pie crust, the prep was about 20 minutes for me.  I also don't do the lattice on top, I made a crumb topping (half cup each of flour & brown sugar, stirred together, then cut in 3T of unsalted butter).  The apples mound HUGE in the crust, so pouring the sauce requires a very slow approach, but everything should fit and not run over when done.  The cooked sauce gives it a sweet caramel-y flavor, and heating it up a day later and adding whipped cream is definitely the way to go.

BEST APPLE PIE EVER!!!  It was only because of personal preference that I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples before putting them in the crust.  I'll never go back to any other recipe!!

Made this pie tonight. Takes very little time to prep for it. I did add cinnamon simply because I LOVE cinnamon, but did not otherwise stray from the recipe.  Can you say PERFECT? It was awesome! My daughter ate it up like it was candy. I am going to make it again at Thanksgiving, but use just slightly less sugar (on a diet).  Wonderful recipe. Thank you so much for posting it. Sure to keep this as a favorite go-to apple pie recipe.

What a great Pie.   Very good.  I have read many of the reviews and some good tips.  Some saying leave as is others saying add your common pie spices.  I say make it how you like it.  I made it once with no extras and once with my normal apple pie spices (cinni, nutmeg, and a touch of allspice)  every time it came out great.  I would highly suggest always using a lattice top crust,  you dont have to, but if you don't you might at well add the sugar and butter to the apples and bake like a normal pie.  Also i would suggest trying other apples.  There are so may great varieties. Just make sure the are more on the tart side since you will need to off set the sugars.  I suggest honey crisp and braeburn two of my favorites.  Or like I like to do mix it up 8 apples try 2 of a few.  Just some thoughts.

I thought this pie was fine, not great.  I did add 1 tbsp pure vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg.  It is very syrupy and so although it tasted good & looked lovely, it was a little too wet for my taste.

It came out of the oven looking super yummy.  But then, when we started eating it, I realized the apple were still completely crunchy!  Everything tasted great, but ahhhhh...really embarrassed to have served it like that.  Granny Smith's sometimes are harder to soften.  I'm going to try this again because of all the great reviews, but next time I'll sautee the apples in butter before adding them to the pie.

Mmmmm this was a hit!  I tossed the apples with about a tsp of cinnamon and poured more than half of the caramel over the apples and the rest over the top crust.  I'll be using this again- thanks =)

This is SO a 5 star recipe.  I've never made an Apple Pie because no one in my family likes it but, when I saw the 5 star rating, I just had to try it!  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make it again!!! Thanks!

I don't usually eat apple pie but this one I love and so do my friends. The only thing I changed was I added a dash of nutmeg and a splash of vanilla extract.

This is such a great and versatile pie recipe.  We go apple picking every year and I make this pie.  I've altered it in all sorts of ways, and it is always good.  I've made it blackberry apple, raspberry apple, even blackberry peach.  I like to add cinnamon, nutmeg,and fresh grated ginger to it.

Hands down the best apple pie I've ever had!  Favorite with the family disappeared in minutes!  Have made it several times and it is always delicious.  However, make sure you cook the sauce long enough to make it carmelize on the top crust when it bakes, and always use fresh apples, frozen apples just don't taste the same.

I am so disappointed, because I expected so much from this pie.  I think the butter overwhelmed the flavor, and it was too rich.

This was a great apple pie and super easy to make. I just can't believe there is no cinnamon in this recipe. I made the recipe as is but will make sure to add cinnamon next time. It just gives it that extra flavor. Served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.

I wanted all of the juicy goodness to be inside the pie, so I stirred the sauce into the apples and then filled the pie shell and sealed with a traditional crust.  The pie still came out a bit dry.  It was a good pie, but not anything I would rave about.  Maybe my apples were larger.  It would be nice to use weights instead of amounts in this recipe since sizes of apples vary so much.  Next time, I'll try to increase the sauce by half and see if that works.  It also needs about 2 tsp cinnamon.

Easy pie to make.  Simple and delicious.  Use the ready made pie crust when you are short on time.  I added cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  I mixed the apples in the sauce before putting them in the pie shell.  Then I saved some of the sauce and spread it on the top of the crust before cooking.  My husband loved the crust that way.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  The pie was beautiful with the carmel topping browned on the crust.  I love cinnamon in my apple pies, so I added some of that.  If you do make this pie, I would recommend serving it warm.  I made it the night before and by the time we ate it the next evening, the butter/caramel sauce had hardened on top with liquid underneath. Everyone still loved it though.

After making this pie for several years, at the request of family for the holidays, this is the only recipe I will use.  My grandfather loves it!  There are a few changes I have made to make it even better.  First, add the 1 tsp of cinnamon or apple pie spice to the sauce and coat the apples with 3/4 of the sauce prior to turning into your pie dish.  Pour the remaining 1/4 over the lattice top.  If I have it on hand, I replace the water with apple cider, which gives the sauce a really nice flavor.  You can also convert this recipe to make apple dumplings baked in the sweet apple sauce too!

5 stars!  I was afraid that the pie would be too sweet but it was just right--I did use salted butter in place of unsalted.  I also used Stayman-Winesap apples from a recent apple-picking excursion instead of the Grannys.  I followed the recipe otherwise, no cinnamon, no nutmeg.  I poured half of the sauce over the apples and the rest over the latticework crust.  That was the best part!  The caramel sauce really makes a sweet-tasting, buttery, soft but slightly crunchy-on-top crust.  Make sure you put a cookie sheet underneath the pie as per other reviewers, there was a lot of overflow.

After serving this apple pie to friends and family for a year now and hearing that "it's the best apple pie ever," I decided to enter an apple pie contest with this recipe--modified a bit.  No surprise I won first place!  Thank you Grandma Ople for the best apple pie ever.

I was skeptical even after all the reviews that a pie with ZERO spices could be so good.  Using Jonamac apples I made it exactly as written and I am so glad I did.  Beautiful and delicious this is one of the easiest pie recipes I have tried.  Thank you so much!

Delicious apple pie recipe.
I only made a few modifications based off of other reviewers. First of all, I mixed the sugar/butter into the apples rather than pouring it on top. Then I used an egg white to brush the top of the pie to make it a nice golden brown. Also, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup of each white and brown rather than the 1/2 cup each. I used the pate brisee recipe from marthastewart.com and it turned out flaky, golden brown, and delicious. I would definitely recommend this recipe to make. I also added a bit of nutmeg, as well as some cinnamon to the apples.

Overall this recipe was very easy and I made it all by myself, even though I am only 14. I used apples from my friend's apple tree (anna apples) and left the skin on for color.

I used the pate brisee recipe from marthastewart.com and it turned out flaky, golden brown, and delicious. I would definitely recommend this recipe to make. I also added a bit of nutmeg, as well as some cinnamon to the apples.

Overall this recipe was very easy and I made it all by myself, even though I am only 14. I used apples from my friend's apple tree (anna apples) and left the skin on for color.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I made for Memorial day and the pan was empty in 30 minutes.  And I doubled the recipe and baked it in a large 10x14, deep casserole baking pan.  I recommend this recipe to any one that loves pies and cobblers.  It is good alone, but adding some vanilla ice cream makes this a ridiculusly good dessert.

Really good. I wasn't so crazy about the green apples though. So I made it again with red delicious apples and everyone agreed it was better.

Great recipe! Only things I did were add cinnamon to the apples (Rome instead of Granny Smith), cook the sauce in the microwave and poured most of it on the apples before adding the lattice crust.

Great recipe!!  I tweaked it, only because I'm adventurous.  I combined this recipe with another I found on the web for an apple/craisin/cherry/pecan/ bourbon pie.  I soaked dried raisins and cherries in a cup of bourbon overnight.  After toasting the pecans for about 10 minutes, I added them and the bourbon mix to the flour/sugar/butter/apple juice (substituted that for the water) mix along with some cinnamon and vanilla.  I also steamed the apples to soften just a little.  I mixed everything together and then added about 2 T of heavy cream to the mixture to smooth everything out.  I was told I should sell the pie, it was so good!  :)  This combination is what I'll be making from now on...  thanks to the original recipe by Grandma Ople.

This is so good, & the first apple pie i ever made. I had added the cinnamon & nutmeg but never thought about the vanilla! Will try it though. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because the sauce is to runny. I just have to find a way to get it thicker so it tastes better. Other then that very yum! Will continue to use this recipe for my family

This recipe is amazing! The first food that I ever made was apple pie with my grandma, and I have been searching for a similar recipe ever since then. I made two of these in the fall with orchard apples and froze them. If you set them on the counter for a few hours and then bake, they are delicious!

I have made this pie before and I always forget to rate it! I usually make an apple pie for New Year's (I don't know why, weird tradition I guess!)and have used this apple pie recipe for the last several years. I took a photo this time...used a Texas cookie cutter to make the vent in the top crust instead of doing the lattice. Also added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar. Happy 2008! (: (: (:

LOVE this pie!! I have made it quite a few times now, every time it comes out great. I do add a tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. You can also mix the sauce with the apples before putting them in the crust. I save some of the sauce to brush on the top pie crust. My friends and family love this pie as much as I do!

WAY too much butter.. the sauce was so rich it completely dominated the apples.  I'm more of naturalist or a purist or whatever you want to call it, so I believe the spices or sauce should just enhance/ compliment the flavor of the apples; they shouldn't completely take over like the did in this recipe.  Perhaps if the butter and amount of sauce were decreased.

Delicious! However, I rather pour in the butter.sugar mixture over the apples than over the lattice crust. I did add a pinch of allspice and about 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the butter/sugar mix. Excellent!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a "semi" hit. It was slightly runny as another person wrote in so I would definitely add maybe 1-2T flour to the apples. I also did pour 1/2 the sugar mixture into the apples and the rest over the top of the crust. It looked awesome coming out of the oven! Also, I would use Fuji apples instead of the Granny Smith . They seem to hold their shape good and not get smushy. Anyway, I certainly recommend the recipe and I will try again. Happy Thanksgiving!

This is the first pie i've ever baked. And, I ended up winning a apple pie bake off at my friends house with it! No alterations necessary. I used the basic flaky pie crust recipe with it.

Be careful not to simmer the sauce too long--my sauce became hard candy and did not flow down into the pie.

Very good as is. I agree with those who say to wait and try it before adding spices. The only thing I added was a sprinkle of coarse sanding sugar over the crust. The crust on the pie is delicious and beautiful! If your pie is turning out mushy and runny, it could be because of the apples you are using. Tarter apples hold up better in pies...a lot of apples will just turn to mush. So stick to Granny Smiths or other very tart apples.  I used Red Haralsons from the tree in my yard and they worked perfectly.

This is the best apple pie I have ever made! I love how the sauce makes the top crust so crunchy and sugary! I baked the pie for 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of 1 hour because I like the apples to be a little softer. I added some cinnamon to the apples just because I could not imagine an apple pie without cinnamon. This is definitely my new apple pie recipe! I'll never make the old kind again!

The kids were have a great time practicing their fire safety exercises "stop, drop, and roll" while I was making this pie after the kitchen filled with smoke from the caramel sauce that spilled over onto the bottom of the oven.  After the smoke detectors ceased their alarms and the pie cooled, we all enjoyed a most delicious apple heaven!  This is a truly wonderful pie!  Just don't forget to put something underneath to catch the overflowing sauce!

Easiest and greatest pie I've ever had!  Like others I sprinkled my apples with cinnamon put them in my crust and then poured the sugar mixture over my pie.  Also I've found that baking it for closer to 45 minutes (after baking it at 425 degrees for 15 min.) makes for the best pie.  When baking it for 35 my apples just weren't as tender as I would have liked them to be.  Overall a wonderful apple pie recipe!

I was so worried that my pie wasn't going to turn out well at all.  My crust before baked, was very tangy tasting as it called for vinegar, I used Bakers Secret Pie crust from this site.  I used the full 8 apples and used a deep dish pie plate which was piled high but thats good, it cooks down.  I mixed quite a bit of the mixture in with the apples as I didn't know about putting all on top of the crust especially since i didn't lattice it.  i did brush some on top and had made several slits on the top.  I was worried about that too as i thought it was going to be very "carmely" tasting.  Boy was I wrong, and happily so!!  This is by far the best pie I have ever made or eaten for that matter and my husbands Mom is a superb baker.  I could eat the crust and the filling alone they're both excellent.  The sauce is the yummiest on top of the crust, next time, more is going on top!  Mine took over an hour as it was very thick. It took my husband and I only 4 nights to finish it off! YUMMO!!

This pie is phenomenal as it is, but I made some adjustments. Instead of 1/2 cup of butter, I use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1 T butter for more apple flavor and nutrition. I followed another reviewer's advice and mix the apples with 1 T cinnamon, a sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg, 1 t vanilla extract, and the juice of half a lemon for a nice bite and to prevent browning. I also sprinkle a little sugar on the bottom of the crust for crisp before adding the apples and pour all of the sauce directly on the apples, not the crust. Then for the crust, which I don't take the time to do lattice-style, I make a few slits, brush with milk, and sprinkle with sugar. I then cover the edges of the crust with tin foil to prevent burning and place on a baking stone lined with foil (placed in the oven prior to baking to heat up and ensure oven temp) to help cook the bottom of the crust. After the 40 minutes at 350, I remove the tinfoil from the crust and keep the pie in the oven for 30 minutes at about 250 to help evaporate some of the excess liquid and finish cooking the edges of the crust. This is so delicious!

I've been making this pie for years now.  I've used every type of apple, and it always receives rave reviews.  I love the way it makes the house smell.  Like Cinnabon!  Now that I have the perfect filling recipe, I can only aspire to making the perfect crust.  Until then, it's store bought, and the latice top is always a hit.  Blue Ribbon perfection!  Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was to toss the sugar mixture with the apples and then fill the pie shell. The pie turned out very well; everyone liked it. I cut back  on the sugar too, and the flavour was still sweet enough.

This pie is amazing! I made it just like the recipe said and it turned out absolutely beautiful and delicious! I was a little worried about pouring the glaze over the top crust, but it made it shiney and georgeous. I will certainly be making this again! Thanks!

This was my first try at apple pie and it turned out great! After I read all the reviews I did had cinamin and nutmeg and a dash of vanilla. I also put in about a tbs. of flour. I poured the carmel mixture in with the apples and left a little bit to pour over the crust. I used ready made crust and brushed it with egg wash. I poured the rest of the carmel sauce over it and sprinkled just a little bit of sugar. You only need 6 apples at the most! I did half granny smith and half pink lady and cooked it for 50 minutes. My husband went nuts over it! Said it was the best apple pie he ever had! I was pleased as pie!!

I always make this pie for either Thanksgiving or Christmas and it's always such a hit. The sauce that is poured over takes on a caramel flavor after being baked and everyone fights for the slices that have more of this topping. Simple and delicious.

This was the first time I made/ate apple pie, and it was great! I'm not a huge apple pie fan, but my bf and his friends loved it.  It even looked good!  I couldn't fit 8 whole apples in, even though I tried to use up every available space with smaller chunks of apple.  And I had no problems with using Granny Smith; was definitely sweet enough!  Great recipe! :)

The pies turned out fine but the quantities in that recipe are wacky.  She must've been using the world's smallest Granny Smith Apples, because I bought 8, ended up using 6, and the 6 I used were enough to fill 2 deep dish pie crusts.  I also added cinnamon to the apples.  This was a much less dry apple pie than I'm used to; I usually don't like them because the crust is incredibly dry and powdery, but the liquid on top of this helped.  I like the gooeyness in the middle.  Served with ice cream.

This is the best apple pie I have ever had and ever made. Just a few key ingredients... simple and perfect. I used the pie shell mix from Betty Crocker I think, the one where you just add water and it turned out buttery and flakey. I used half Granny Smith and half Fuji. It made it Sweet and Sour! I listened to some of the reviewers and poured the mixture when it was half way stacked and then the rest on top. Left a little bit of the mixure to brush the top crust. I can't tell you enough about this recipe. I was soooo good. Add real whipping cream or vanilla ice cream and it makes it even better.

This is a perfectly nice apple pie that is very easy to make. I would probably have rated this pie more highly if I weren't expecting so much more.  The reviews I read here were, in my opinion, misleading.  This pie is perfectly good.  Everybody liked it, and I would probably make it again.  My only problem with the reviews that I read is that I was led to expect something AWESOME.  Anyway, if you want to make a perfectly good apple pie that is extremely easy, this is definitely the way to go.

This was delicious and easy - I loved the caramel type sauce. Mine was pretty runny, but it tasted so good we wanted to lick the plates clean!
*** I've made three of these pies now - with lattice and with a full crust. The lattice crust was much better! I was skeptical but it turned out great!

When I first made this pie, there was a disaster with the caramel sauce, but I made it again last week. The caramel sauce came out great this time! This is yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly, and was a bit disappointed with the outcome. I guess that I was expecting something that might taste like a caramel apple (based on other reviews), but to me it just tasted like a different version of apple pie. 
This pie did not last long at my dinner table.

I think we messed up on the sauce that you pour over top, but I won't let that affect my rating. Just to help someone, don't let the sauce cook for any longer than said, as it becomes so thick that after pouring on top and cooking it just hardens and is not easy to chew. Also, the apples seemed so mushy. I prefer a harder bite to the apples in pies... but the taste over all is worth of 4, and using a homemade pie crust is a must.

A five for:
-Taste
-Presentation
-Easiness/Not Complicated

The taste is wonderful--it has a carmel taste to it from the syrup.
The changes I made were as follows: I added a few shakes of cinnamon (my favorite spice =]) and a pinch of clove to the sauce due to some reviewer's suggestions. Also, I used 5 Granny Smiths and 3 Gala apples.

When I make this again, I will be sure not to use 8 apples because it was too much.

I am not an apple pie fan, but I am always looking for a better recipe for my boyfriend.  This pie looked and smelled heavenly as I was baking it.  I even took a pic of it fresh out of the oven because it looked just like a pie on TV!  The inside was tasty, the crust was outstanding, but it was a tad runny.  I think I needed to bake it the full 45 minutes (in addition to the 15 min. @ 425).  I did add apple pie spices and toss the apples in the caramel sauce before piling the apples in the crust.  Then I covered the apples with a second full crust and brushed a little of the caramel sauce on the crust.  The crust was outstanding!

I did a regular pie top instead of the lattice top.  I poured the syrup mixture over the apples directly.  Pie turned out great.  The whole family loved it.

This pie is delicious! I took a few liberties with the recipe. I used salted butter. Eight apples is too many, I used 6 Granny Smith apples and 5 would have worked fine. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the sauce. I used Pillsbury ready crusts and I didn't lattice the top, just poured the sauce over the apples and put on the top crust, then brushed the crust with milk so it would brown. Luckily I put a pan under this, it ran over and would have made a terrible mess otherwise. Baking time isn't quite long enough, I baked it 55 minutes during the 350º phase. This was great with ice cream, a different slant on apple pie because of the caramel taste. This recipe will never take the place of my traditional apple pie recipe, but it is very good and I will make it again.

Great pie! I have made this 3 times now. tried a few different things but what works best is sticking to the recipe just as it says but put some cinnamon on the apples before putting in pie.

Even my Grandmother liked this pie!!  It was a detour from the method I grew up with where you would mix all of the spices and suger with the apples before putting them into the crust, dab it with raw butter and put the crust on (sprinkling sugar on the crust) yet easy and delicious. 

I did not make a lattice top, but just poured most of the sauce into the pie, covered it with a regular crust and brushed the rest of the sauce on the top crust before putting it into the oven. 

The other thing I experienced is that while I baked mine for the maximum time listed on the recipe (and don't live at a high altitude), the apples weren't quite cooked enough for me so I would bake it longer.  

Otherwise, a great apple pie and I am an apple pie junkie. : )

I used a version of this apple pie recipe and won 2nd place at the San Diego Fair. My girlfriend doesn't like apple pie but she loves this recipe. I use a homemade shortbread crust and use an oatmeal steudel on the top. I have never had a problem with sogginess and I make sure to mix the apples with the caramel and then place them in the crust. Like other reviewers I use cinnamon and even sprinkle some in the bottom of the crust prior to baking. One judge at the fair said it was the best pie he ever tasted!

This pie was absolutely delicious, I've tried a lot of apple pie recipes and this was the best.  I only used about 3 Red Delicious and 3 McIntosh apples.  I also added some cinnamin and nutmeg to the sauce.  YUM!

This was my first-ever apple pie.  It was really easy (thanks to an apple peeler-corer-slicer), and pouring the sugar mixture over the top gave it a beautiful, sparkly brown lattice top. Yummy!

I poured most of the sauce over apples before I put lattice crust on pie, then poured the rest over top. Delicious

I've made this pie so many times I can't begin to count the times. I've made it every Thanksgiving for several years as well as many times during apple season. Since I found this recipe I don't even bother looking for another recipe. I even know this recipe by heart. This is THE best apple pie recipe hand down! Everybody LOVES this pie! I've shared the recipe many times. I've read several posts about forgoing the lattice top - that makes me sad because one of the great bonuses about this pie recipe is that it turns out so beautiful and everyone is soooo impressed when they see it. This pie is so quick and easy to make. The weaving is super easy but if you don't want to tackle it or don't have time, just lay all of the horizontal strips all at once then put all of the vertical strips on top without weaving them. Honestly it's not even that noticeable that it's not actually weaved when it comes out of the oven.  I like to use a variety of apples. That always turns out best. I have a pear tree, so sometimes I mix in pears or make a pear pie. I do add a little cinnamon (when I think about it). I decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup of each instead of 1/2 cup. I do this with every dessert recipe and nobody ever notices. I always wait about making the syrup so it doesn't thicken too much. It's ok to pour it over the apples before you put the top on but be sure to save some to brush on top. You can add a few drops of water if it's too thick to brush on. Don't skip it. It makes the crust ta

Turned put fabulous. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to my sugar mixture and also tossed the apples in some of the mixture before placing them in the pie?? helpful hint! Don't make your sugar sauce until you have the pie fully completed or it will harden up on you before you can pour it over...so make it last. Also unless you want a stove covered in apples and sugar place your pie on a cookie sheet with tin fold on it for easy clean up at the end.

I added some cinnamon and it was wonderful. I will definitely make this again, besides the apples it was super easy aswell. Just incase you are new to making pies like me, make sure to have your crust and lattice ready ahead of time; a little bit of a delay for me ??

I  am obsessed with this apple pie. I've made it with the lattice crust and the topping on the outside,  with the lattice crust and half of the topping on the inside and half on the outside, and I've made it with a solid top  with all the topping on the inside. Every single way I've made it, it's been divine. I do add some cinnamon to the topping, because I live cinnamon.  It's also very good without it. Today, I replaced the sugar with agave and used just 2 Tbs of water.  Also wonderful!

Okay...what everyone says is true.  This is over and above for an apple pie!  Adding the syrup after assembly is intriguing.  My nephews and grandson love my traditional apple pie, so I will not give up on it.  This one is a great addition to the collection.  I will continue to use mixed apples to get different flavors and textures.  Grandma knew what she was doing, though!

This is my apple pie go-to starter recipe. I do a couple things different is why I rated a 4. With my changes its a perfect 10. Always beautiful, taste is amazing and ALWAYS gets eaten first at the holidays. I put 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice in with the butter/sugar mixture. I have all my apples peeled, sliced and in a bowl. I then pour my butter/sugar mixture over the apples in the bowl, give it a good stir and let it sit while I put my crust in my pie dish. I DO NOT pour the mixture over the top crust. I use an egg white wash over the top and sprinkle sugar crystals over the top. Boom... Perfect pie, every time. :-)

I'm not a big fan of apple pie but my husband is.  So after 31 years of marriage I decided to make him one.  I'm not a pie baker - but this is EASY and The Best apple pie I've ever tasted.  I did add cinnamon and also sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar as my husband likes cinnamon in an apple pie.  If you read Opel's grand-daughter's story - I get the feeling that Opel might have added it too if she had had it on hand the day she created it.  for this first attempt I did not make the lattice top - but after watching the video of how to do that - I will do it next time I make it.  This time I just put a regular top crust on it - poking holes in the top to let out steam.  And because of this I had to mix the sugar and butter mixture into the apples before putting them into the pie.  I baked it exactly as Opel instructed (adding some tinfoil around the edges to keep them from getting too dark as mine seem to always do if I don't put the foil around the edges - I also tented it with foil the last 1/2 hour as my pies have always gotten dark crusts if I don't).  You can see that I have to put some safe-holds in place being an inexperience pie baker -but you probably won't have too if you bake pies regularly.  So, Dear Opel - I loved your pie and so did my husband.  I will make it again for sure! 
Patti

I baked it exactly as Opel instructed (adding some tinfoil around the edges to keep them from getting too dark as mine seem to always do if I don't put the foil around the edges - I also tented it with foil the last 1/2 hour as my pies have always gotten dark crusts if I don't).  You can see that I have to put some safe-holds in place being an inexperience pie baker -but you probably won't have too if you bake pies regularly.  So, Dear Opel - I loved your pie and so did my husband.  I will make it again for sure!

This recipe is delicious, it was my first apple pie and my new favorite. I made a few minor additions like cinnamon and nutmeg and a little vanilla, it was perfect! Thanks for posting this one, its going in my recipe box forever.

Best apple pie ever! Super easy to make. Peeling the apples can be a little time consuming though. I like to use the full amount of apples in the recipe. It may seem like a lot, but when you bake it and they all soften, it'll end up being the perfect amount. Like others, I like to add cinnamon to the recipe. I like to eat it hot and topped with vanilla ice cream! Yummmm

Just like the other reviewers suggested  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to it.  I also mixed part of the carmel sauce with the apples and then poured the rest over the top crust. The pie made my kitchen smell wonderful and brought back memories of a bakery in Stone Harbor, NJ. I had to make it in a bread pan instead of a pie tin  which allowed all the apples to fit.

Pie crust was the crispest/flakiest due to the dual temperature baking, and the caramel topping was amazing. The crust tasted buttery but that was because of the topping seeping down into all parts of the pie.  I still like our basic apple pie recipe, but  I used to go to the bakery for caramel apple pie- not anymore! Just what I was looking for- perfect!

First pie I ever baked and it was amazing! Perfect balance of flavors. I did layer cinnamon as some of the other posters suggested, which worked perfectly! Look no further, you've found the recipe to pass down to future generations.

Really struck gold with this recipe.....  Followed most the directions, but after reading some other reviews, generously sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on the apples before the hot liquid was added.  Also I have not done a lattice top yet, so I went the easy route with a standard double crust pie.  Oh Lord, this pie was delicious!  Made it last night, and we finished it this morning.(Giggling that we had pie for breakfast...)  Making two more this afternoon, one for my house and one for my parents (Dad).  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you for sharing this~

I used a 9.5 glass pie pan,  refrigerated pillsbury pie crust, with the apple corer that slices the apples i cut each slice in half so they were thinner 7 apples was perfect. I did sprinkle a little cinnamon on the apples but followed the recipe as is. When it came to baking I extended the higher temp to 20min then the lower temp for 40. It was perfect the best recipe I've found!

This was my first attempt at making an apple pie.  I made a flaky crust from scratch which was a little challenging.  I thought I messed up this pie but I was so wrong.  Even with my not-so-pretty crust, this pie was sooo delicious.  Two points with this recipe:  doing a lattice is a must as you pour the caramel sauce all over the assembled pie, and this will bubble over so be sure to have something underneath to catch the mess while it's baking.  Follow this recipe the first time as you would probably be pleasantly surprised it doesn't need cinnamon or any other spices.

I have made this pie several times over the last few years. I found it a bit tart the first time so I have since changed the apples since we don't like granny smith's all that much. I use 3 Braeburn and 3 Fuji and I do add cinnamon to the apple slices and toss it around a bit. I also don't always do the lattice crust. I sometimes make a hole in the center and some designs to get the sugar mixture to flow right in.  Once I used this recipe, and everyone loved it, I have never used another.

This is, by a landslide - the best apple pie around. I only make lattice crust tops for berry pies, so I covered this apple pie with a top crust with apple shaped cut-outs.  For this reason, I poured the sugar/butter mixture over the apples before placing the top crust on.  The apple filling will set once the pie cools.  It's divine.  Add some ice cream or homemade whipped cream and you've got yourself a blue ribbon pie!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. It was the best Apple pie I have ever made! I added traditional apple pie spices and cooked the apples in a pan ahead of time (just trying to save time as I was cooking 9 other things). I did a basket weave top using a crust recipe from this site as well. Everything was just perfect! My new forever apple pie recipe!

FIVE STARS! This pie tasted like my grandmothers and I was almost crying at the first bite! I made this pie for my first ever pie on Thanksgiving for my family in Spain and it was beautiful. I used Ruth's Grandma's pie crust and I was very pleased with the results. This pie was not difficult to make and my family ate it up. I was so happy to make a delish pie from scratch! But yes, be sure to have your pie prepped before pouring the sauce. I made mine with the classic crust on top and before placing it I added the sauce on top of my apples, added the top crust and sealed and then I brushed the top of my pie with an egg wash and then topped it with cinnamon and sugar, baked 45 min at 350 degrees, it was perfectly cooked. :D

This makes a really good pie! The only deviation from the recipe I made was to toss the apples in 1/2 tsp cinnamon before putting them in the pie pan. Delicious!

Hands down the best apple pie! I am not big into cooking or winging recipes. We went apple picking so I needed something to do with the apples. I have made 2 of these pies in one week. I followed the directions with the exception of brushing the bottom crust with an egg. I followed another reviewer by adding cinnamon but only 2 teaspoons. I added it to the apples rather than the mixture. The lattice crust makes for a great presentation! I poured most of the mixture over the apples, assembled the lattice pieces and poured the rest of the mixture over the top so it still was caramelized. I did have to put a pan under it to catch the drippings. I made my own pie crust from Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe and my family and friends go nuts over this! Thank you!!!

This pie recipe is a definite keeper! Just made this for the first time and it turned out beautiful and tastes even better.  I used Aurora Golden Gala apples instead of Granny Smith and used Krusteaz pie crust mix. The mix is a bit more work but has a wonderful flavor and texture.  I really can't image this recipe turning out anything but delicious!  Thanks for submitting:)

We have made 10 times, my kids love to help make it; to save time (it takes us 20 min. to get into the oven) we buy a pillsbury crust & just lay the lattice crust horizontally, then vertical. My 7 & 9 year olds do this part, instead of weaving the lattice. Buying a $25 apple peeler/corer/cutter on amazon has saved me 40 minutes of prepping the apples by hand, and my kids love to crank the machine. We also add cinnamon/vanilla. Thank you for this fabulous recipe, we LOVE the caramel sauce baked on top of the crust!

I have baked this recipe several times to rave reviews, but I did add Asian pears in addition to just apples. 
 Other than that I added ground nutmeg and thyme personal preference. 
Love recipe nonetheless.

This delicious apple pie absolutely must be tried at least once without changing a thing.  I know, I know, everyone *knows* that cinnamon is a must in apple pie.  It's not.  The butter based caramel sauce highlights the tartness of the apples perfectly and simply, without addition of other flavors or complications.  Pouring it over the already latticed-top gives a sweet coating to the crust that lends a crunchy contrast to the soft apple filling, as well as making it beautiful when it comes out of the oven.  If you use a deep dish pie plate, there is no bubbled over caramel and 8 apples fit exactly.  My husband, normally a cinnamon lover, loved the pie as it was, and commented that adding cinnamon would probably detract.  My only regret in making this pie is that I forgot to take a picture before serving it.

This delicious apple pie absolutely must be tried at least once without changing a thing.  I know, I know, everyone *knows* that cinnamon is a must in apple pie.  It's not.  The butter based caramel sauce highlights the tartness of the apples perfectly and simply, without addition of other flavors or complications.  Pouring it over the already latticed-top gives a sweet coating to the crust that lends a crunchy contrast to the soft apple filling, as well as making it beautiful when it comes out of the oven.  If you use a deep dish pie plate, there is no bubbled over caramel and 8 apples fit exactly.  My husband, normally a cinnamon lover, loved the pie as it was, and commented that adding cinnamon would probably detract.  My only regret in making this pie is that I forgot to take a picture before serving it.

This is the best apple pie ever! It really helped to watch the video on making the lattice pie crust. The third time I made with some chopped pecans and it was even better!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas this past year.  Everyone complimented me and loved the taste!  It was pretty easy to make and I happened to fool everyone with the professional look of the lattice and great taste! The only thing I changed was adding a bit more cinnamon and sugar on top of the apples.  It was a family favorite and I have a feeling I will be asked to make it next year! :)

Amazing! The texture and flavour of he filling is beyond compare. It reheats well, but is just as lovely cold & maybe even better the next day! If you can keep off it that long ;). Made with Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust fom this site that I had in the freezer. Perfect & easy!  I add spices for personal preference, but 'as is' is still fab! Posted a pick of the very last slice...

I'm not a big Apple Pie fan, but FOR SURE this is the best apple pie I've ever eaten. I've baked it 3 times now and have gotten rave reviews each time. Nothing like the smell of Apple Pie to fill the house. You must try this recipe! You won't regret it.

Amazing! This is my second time making this pie and it was even better this time! Last time the bottom crust was a bit undercooked and the glazed lattice got slightly burnt.  This time I did everything according to directions again, except placed the pie one rack lower in the oven. By using the rack one below the middle, the bottom crust was completely cooked and the top was nicely browned! Incredible tasting! A new family favorite!

With the suggestions from other bakers it made one incredible pie! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tbsp of vanilla (minus 1 tbsp of water) , substituted 1 tsbp of flour for cornstatch and 6 red delicious apples. Definitely cut the lattice ahead of time and chill in fridge or freezer while you make the rest. I also soaked all the apples in the mixture before pouring into the crust then made another 1/2 batch of the mixture for the topping. When the pie had 20 min left, I then poured it over the top for a nice Carmelized lattice. I cooked it for 50 min at 350. This pie was a huge hit!!!

This was the first pie I've ever made (I'm an experienced baker in other areas though) and it was delicious.  I cut back on the sugar since I didn't want it to be overwhelmingly sweet, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Ended up using 6 apples (3 Granny Smith, 3 Red Delicious) and a 9" glass pie dish.  I tossed the apples with all the caramel before putting them in the pie b/c I didn't do a lattice top (just brushed the top crust with heavy cream). I used Martha Stewart's Basic Pie Dough recipe for the crust.  Definitely put it on a cookie sheet in the oven b/c it WILL bubble over.  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving.  Will make it again next year!

I must say that after reading many reviews I was VERY tempted to alter this recipe.  But I do feel that a recipe should be tried AS IS at least the first time, then be open to tweek and modify as per your taste.  I was very pleased with this pie.  It was very tasty, but in my opinion tastes better hot/warm than cold/room temp.  Next time I'll crimp the edges after I pour the mix on top so it doesn't pool onto parts of the crust.  It makes for a more 'perfect' presentation.  Also, I don't feel the cinnamon or vanilla was missed.  After all that's what a Dutch Apple Pie is for.  Would have given it 5 stars but apple pie isn't really in my top 5 desserts.

I've never written about a recipe before---even if they were really good. BUT this is HANDS DOWN the best apple pie ever!!!!!! I usually read some reviews before making a recipe so I took the advice of another contributor to add cinnamon to the apples -- I also added fresh grated nutmeg to the apples as well. I used apple cider instead of water. I can't wait to make this pie for every occasion!
Next time I think I will pour the mixture over the apples before placing the top crust as someone else suggested and then basting the crust with some reserved mixture.
I can't say enough about this recipe. Thank you grandma Ople and thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used this recipe to make my first pie - it was gooood but I did make some alterations for my second pie.
The amount of sauce made using this recipe I found was way too much.  First pie was oozing sauce and I found it to be too much; for the second pie I halved the butter, white sugar, brown sugar and found this to be much more enjoyable as the apples still had texture and weren't drown in  sauce.

This recipe has made me a successful apple pie maker!  I love it and everyone else loves the pie.
I add 2 tsp of cinnamon, as we all love  cinnamon, but otherwise I make it exactly as the recipe is written.  
It deserves 10 stars.

A simple yet very rewarding/forfilling recipe. I added a few tea spoons of lime juice (personal preference) with a tiny bit of salt to keep apple from turnning yellow (I work slowly...) and turned out very well for us.  Brought it to work + EVERYBODY loved it!! Thanks!!

So easy, so few ingredients - WONDERFUL.  I have an apple tree in my backyard and never made an apple pie before.  This was EASY.  Love the few ingredients that I had in the pantry.  I've made this twice already - second pie I just put the entire top crust (skipped the lattice cutting).  Husband loved it, but he did request some cinnamon - easy accomodation for him.  Thanks for this simple recipe.

delicious!  I added 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and I also decreased the sugar by half. I didn't have any granny smith apples on hand but it turned out fine!

Really awesome apple pie! I love how the caramel sauce caramelizes into the apples and the crust. I will definitely make this again. The caramel sauce will bubble out over the pie when baking so I would suggest putting the pie on a baking sheet.

This is an OMG recipe for sure.  It was my first time baking an apple pie and I even did a faux lattice crust - Pillsbury roll out crust of course.  Zero leftovers of this dessert I made for Christmas.  All were impressed.  I did the modifications suggested by the top reviewer as well.  Very nice looking too!

meh this was alright seems like its missing some spices, very easy to make though I also used canned apples since that's all I had. Apple pie isn't really one of my all time favorite pies though and I can't even remember the last time I had one before trying this.

This was my very first pie and I was nervous about the turn out. Luckily, my husband LOVED it. He told me that it was the best apple pie that he'd ever had. I'm so glad that I went with this recipe.

This Pie is FABULOUS. I read some reviews that stated the submitter "forgot" cinnamon. However; there are those of us who just hate cinnamon and further my husband is from Ireland where they do not add cinnamon to pies...of any kind that I've seen and so this was the pie I've been waiting for!!  Thanks so much.

This is the most impressive looking apple pie and so easy too.  It tastes wonderful.  I followed the reciepe, but added some from other reviewers.  Cinnamon is a must along with vanilla.  Great pie.  You can't go wrong with Grandma Ople's reciepe.

This is the most impressive looking apple pie and so easy too.  It tastes wonderful.  I followed the reciepe, but added some from other reviewers.  Cinnamon is a must along with vanilla.  Great pie.  You can't go wrong with Grandma Ople's reciepe.

I made as directed (with the added cinnamon sprinkled on the apples before I added the molten goodness) and it was amazing.

I was looking for an apple pie to surprise my boyfriend with, and came across this one. Everybody was raving about it, so I wanted to see why. Well, that was the best apple pie I have ever tasted, and my boyfriend agreed! If I could give it MORE stars, I would!! Although there were only two of us, that delicious pie did not last 24 hours! I did add 1 tsp. cinnamon directly to the apples though, and to the filling, one tablespoon of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg, as has been suggested.

This pie is AMAZING. I get RAVE reviews each and every time I make it! Everyone I know loves it, and begs for it over and over! I add a little carmel to it (the kind they sell for dipping apples in) and it makes it that much better! I sent it to work with my husband one time and the one gentleman said "is your wife amish?" HA!

BEST PIE I'VE EVER HAD!   My boyfriend and I both love sweets and we used to go to a great bakery for apple pie with vanilla ice cream. I thought that pie was delicious... until i tried this recipe! I've made this twice and it's absolutely amazing. I don't bake it quite as long because I only used about 4 apples. Also, I like Gala apples more so I use them instead. Fantastic!

This recipe was easy to make. This was my first pie that i have ever cooked, and it turned out great. Easy to make, the cooking time was perfect, and the lattice crust was a great presentation. Can't wait to make this again for the holiday parties.

I made this using a mixture of Gala, Red Delicious and Granny Smith apples.  My boyfriend is a DIE HARD Mrs. Smiths apple pie fan (bless his heart, he just did not know any better) and this pie won hands down against Mrs. Smiths by all.

Easy, quick and delicious!!!  This is now the one and only apple pie recipe we will use!!  We did add vanilla to the sugar, flour and butter mix.  Also covered the apples in a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Those were the only modifications.  It came out beautiful and so so so yummy!!  What an absolutely perfect recipe!!! Thank you for sharing!

This is an awesome pie! I did what other suggested: brushed egg whites on the bottom crust, I only used 6 Granny Smith Apples (but could have gotten away with just 5 because my pie was super mounded!), added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the apples before pouring them into the bottom crust. The thing that took the longest was the lattice top, but it made the pie so yummy it's a total MUST.

BEST apple pie I have ever had, and it was my first time ever making one! I added cinnamon (eyeballed it), replaced 1T water with 1T vanilla extract, and used a full crust for the top (also coated the bottom crust in egg white as was suggested on here) instead of lattice. I then poured the last bit of caramely goodness I saved over the top crust. This pie was AMAZING. I used Glen Seedling apples and they were absolutely PERFECT.

I am not an apple pie fan at all but when my daughter and grandchildren thought it would be nice to pick grandma a bag of apples while at the u-pick, I had to hunt for something to use up those apples and quick.  I came across this recipe and it is sooo good that my 28 yr old daughter requested me to leave some sugar butter sauce in the pot for her scrape....she's pregnant.  The sauce is what makes this pie so delicious.  It is Awesome, 4 pies later.  Only changes I made, I found it easier to pour the sugar butter sauce before placing on the lattice and received the same results.  For even a more caramel flavor, I added 4 caramels to the sauce.  Also, the tips in the footnotes were great! Thank you so much for sharing.

This is the very first pie that I have ever made. I used already made crust (Pillsbury and it was delicious!).My parents seemed to like it more than I did, but that might have been because they didn't want to hurt my feelings. Overall it wasn't a hard recipe to follow but the filling tasted kind of off. I might try putting a few more ingredients to the apples before I make this recipe again (which I definitely will!).

This was excellent! I was hesitant to make it because I normally just toss apples in a dry mix and use butter pieces as my go to apple pie so pouring a liquid over my apples, made me a little nervous. But this was fabulous! My hubby enjoyed it and he is PICKY. I will make this over and over! Thank you so much for the recipe it was surprisingly wonderful.

This apple pie was the best I've ever tasted!  The only problem I had was the filling was a little runny.  I used Honeycrisp apples, which might have been the culprit.  Anyway, it was yummy!  I added 1 t.  of cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg to the apples.  I've never made a lattice work crust.  I was surprised how easy it was and how great it looked. I used the basic flaky crust on this website.  Enjoy!

This apple pie was the best I've ever tasted!  The only problem I had was the filling was a little runny.  I used Honeycrisp apples, which might have been the culprit.  Anyway, it was yummy!  I added 1 t.  of cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg to the apples.  I've never made a lattice work crust.  I was surprised how easy it was and how great it looked. I used the basic flaky crust on this website.  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe!  A very different technique then the way I usually make apple pie – so I was curious to try it.  After reading some of the reviews – I realized the recipe doesn’t call for cinnamon or nutmeg.  I personally like cinnamon and nutmeg in an apple pie so I did add some to the apples before putting them in the pie dish.  However, I have met people that don’t like cinnamon at all – so I think that is just personal preference.  Other then that – I made the recipe exactly….. and it turned out really great.

My favorite apple pie.   A yummy apple pie and genius to pour the filling over the lattice work to soak through to the bed of mounded apples.  Delicious and looks fabulous.  I substitute a couple of the grannies for a sweeter, firm apple.

I didn't care for it, but my husband says he enjoyed it - he could just be trying to be nice. Next time I'll try it with a sweeter apple, not Granny Smiths.

This is an excelent recipe!  If you have problems with the apples not getting cooked enough, then cook them with the filling ingredients in a large skillet stirring constantly for about 10 minutes before pouring them into the pie pan.

I love this pie!  I made it once before and forgot to save it to my recipe box- every pie made since did not measure up to this one. So happy to have found it again!! And, add cinnamon as the other reviewers suggest. Perfection!

Didn't care for this pie.  I don't know if it was because I used all Granny Smiths, or because of the "soggy" top crust.  Just didn't care for it.

PERFECT. Followed the recipe exactly and I made it with a store-bought crust and my own home-made crust and they were both fantastic.

Wonderful pie! I like apple pie but this was over the top with great and interesting flavors. You should try this recipe at least once as its written before you add anything "extras" to it. I didn't do the lattice top as I was using the "Never Fail Pie Crust II" from this site. It was too soft to try the pretty crust. I'll just have to learn to make a "real" pie crust! **UDATE** 11/8/11 Made this recipe again using the "Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust" recipe from this site. What a wonderful recipe to work with! Pairing these two recipes move this apple pie to more than 5 Star status for me. Made the pie taste better with a crust that was as good as or better than many bakeries!!

WOW!!   I used a combo of Granny Smiths and Pink Ladys and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and mixed the syrup with the apples.  I cheated on the crust (didn't lattice it) and used Pillsbury refrigerated crusts (heck, it's flaky, tasty and doesn't messy the kitchen).   I've been using my old recipe for decades.  I tried this recipe to find out what the fuss was about.  THIS is my new apple pie recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing it.  YUM YUM YUMMY!!

Wonderful!  Looking for a simple apple pie recipe to make for my brother-in-law who LOVES apple pie.  He just loved this pie.  He could not believe me and Matthew (9yrs old son) made it. Probably because I can not bake. I can cook, but I can not bake.  I think it as a lot to do with my old stove. Thank you again for the wonder recipe and another memory for me and Matthew

This pie was ABSOLUTELY delicious!! Next time I make it...probably this week I will probably take other reviewers advice and add some sweeter apples to the mix just so it's not sooo tart!  Otherwise though it was just absolutely AMAZING!!!

I first made this pie after boyfriend (now husband) found it and asked me to make it. Never having made a pie before in my life  I gave it a try. It turned out great. My husband says its the best pie ever. It's the only apple pie I will make. I thought it was super easy and needs no adjustments. I have added a little cinnamon before, but I prefer it as is.

Boy, has it been a long time since I have made a homemade apple pie! This recipe turned out wonderfully! I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe from this site. A couple of things to note: I do agree with the previous review that there was no "paste" consistency with the flour/butter mixture.  The syrup had a great caramel like flavor (which I poured on the pie before I put on the top crust- did not make lattice top.) I also agree that spices are needed but love the suggestion to coat the apples with the spice, not to mix it into the syrup. And finally, 8 granny smith apples will make for a *tart* pie which is great if that's what you want. I prefer sweeter pies so I used 2 granny smith, 2 gala and 2 golden delicious. Turned out to be a great combination although I still had apples left over, so next time I will cut back to 5 apples. I used a stone pie plate and it was beautifully cooked in about 40 minutes. I will make this one again!

This is absolutely the best recipie for Apple Pie!  I use a brush to lightly apply the mixture to the entire lattice crust.  I also sprinkle some cinnamon on the apples as an added touch!  Thanks Grandma Ople! I wish I knew you a long time ago!!

WOW. This pie is fantastic.  I read the reviews before I made it and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the apples. Honestly, it probably would have been perfect without the cinnamon. I also used a combination of granny smiths and galas (to cut some of the tartness).  I didn't do the lattice - instead, I put vent slits in the top pie crust and brushed on 2 tbs of the butter/sugar mixture that I had reserved.  Served it a-la-mode and it was a hit!

This is absolutely the best.  I used tart apples fresh from an apple tree instead of grannies & it was wonderful.  Got gobbled up in no time!

I thought this apple pie was very good although I did make some changes based on other reviews and the fact that my husband requested cinnamon in the pie.  I used Jonathon apples, salted butter, and added about 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla to the sauce however, after reading reviews I may add the cinnamon directly to the apples next time.  This is my first attempt at apple pie and was a success but, since I have no other apple pie recipes to compare it to I am temporarily giving it a 4* with the possibility of a future 5*.  I'm sure the pie is equally as good without the cinnamon and vanilla.  The reason I believe this is because I have made apple dumplings with no or little cinnamon and they are wonderful too.  I will be making this again.

The best, the best, the best apple pie ever. I have made many many apple pies in my 15 years in the restaurant but never one this good. I have made this pie with any kind of apple, we have 3 different trees in our yard and everyone was great. Hats off to moshasmama

Hold the sugar, way too sweet!   Followed the recipe to a T.  Will try again but I'll scale back the sugar.

Not like this recipe needs anymore reviews but I loved it so much I could not resist! I did what other reviewers suggested, added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract and mixed 1 Tbsp of cinnamon onto my apples then poured the caramel syrup over them before dumping into the pie plate. I baked it on the bottom shelf of my oven uncovered for the first 10 minutes and then covered the edges with aluminum foil.

This was an excellent pie.  The sugar to apples ratio is perfect.  Like other reviewers I added a tsp of cinnamon. I took this pie to a dinner party and it was a big hit. The other thing I changed is I add the syrup mixture to the apples instead of pouring it through the lattice mixture because I don't like the effect that has on the look of the pastry.

It was a very good pie. Although, the syrup didn't seem to change or add any thing to the top crust. Also, when I cut the pie it was very runny and had to be spooned out. I followed directions but must have done something a little wrong. My fam loved it anyway.

I made this pie for thanksgiving last year and am getting ready to make it again for my father-in-law for father's day!  I had so many compliments when I made it!  Be careful as to put a liner in the bottom of the oven for it may overflow.  I will probably not use as many apples this time.  Very good!!!

For you Southern California cooks out there, you can say that this pie is as good as - if not better than - any Julian apple pie out there! I did not change a thing in the recipe. I didn't have time to spend on the lattice, so I used a cookie cutter to make a heart in the center of the top crust instead and it still came out great.  I will be making this for years to come!

Delicious!  I always cut the sugar in half  in all of my recipes.  I did it with this one as well.  This filling with my great grandmother's crust had people begging for the recipe.  I can't part with my crust recipe yet.

If you are on the fence about trying this recipe, JUST DO IT! I know that very idea of making an apple pie without cinnamon, nutmeg or vanilla - UNIMAGINABLE - but, it is fabulous. Put in a new oven liner and don't expect to use it again cause this pie can drip a little since you are pouring the "caramel" on top. But, despite that one minor detail, everyone I have made this pie for loves it and loves me for making it - I have made this pie over forty times. Grandma Ople was nothing short of a cooking legacy I am certain :) Thanks for sharing her gift with me!

This is the only apple pie recipe I use any more. My husband, who hates apple pie, LOVES this pie. I sold one of these through my sister's gift boutique and the buyer ordered 15 more as groom's "cake" for her son's wedding! The only thing I do differently is that I toss the apples with a teaspoon of cinnamon before arranging them in the dish. But it tastes good without the cinnamon as well. You can't go wrong with this pie!

Amazing!  I worried that the bottom crust might be soggy because of the syrup but it was all wonderfully flaky (I like Alton Brown's crust recipe).  Absolutely the best apple pie that I have ever made.  Oh and I used cinnamon with the sugar syrup - a wonderful Vietnamese cinnamon.  Not a smidgeon left!

Guys, for your own sake, do NOT make this pie!  It is a recipe for disaster.  This recipe makes the best apple pie EVER! No kiddin. I've made apple pie's before but this one was a huge hit. Made it for Thanksgiving and now the entire family wants me to make it every week.  So, unless you want to spend more time in the kitchen than the garage, leave this one alone.  Thank you grandma Opal!!

I MUST tell you MY little secret that was "the frosting on the cake" for this pie:  I used 1/4 cup of CAPTAIN MORGAN'S SPICED RUM instead of the water (you can still use a little water [I didn't] but definitely use a full 1/4 cup of CM) ... it was DIVINE!!!  I tossed the apples in half of the mix and poured the rest through the lattice crust ... I made this for Thanksgiving and a few of us ate a piece while waiting for the turkey to be done (we couldn't wait)... I was asked to make it again for Christmas and was SO elated because I forgot to take some home with me on Thanksgiving ...

I am by no means an expert on cooking anything, but I made an attempt at this recipe and couldn't believe the result. This is one of the best apple pies I have ever had.

This is definitely a 5 star.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg. I also mixed my apples with the caramel sauce before putting into the shell.  It was delicious, but sweet to me, but I don't normally eat sugar.  Everyone else LOVED it.

This pie is absolutely fabulous!  I added a bit of cinnamon to the apples and to the caramel mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was concerned that the Granny Smith apples would be too tart, but they were perfect.  I used a refrigerated pie crust because I was short on time, but will definitely try with a home made crust next time.  This will be my only apple pie recipe from now on.  Thanks for the post!

This was absolutely delicious! I never was a fan of pies, or anything made with cornstarch, just never tasted as good as making an ol' fashioned roux to thicken. i followed the orgiginal recipe, except adding a little cinnamon to the apples, and it turned out great. I used Ruth's Grandma's pie crust (from allrecipes.com)- which was also amazing. I didnt measure the pie dish so i had leftover apples, (made mini apple turnovers with the left over dough- used the same recipe for the sauce)  I trust anything with "Grandma" in the title, they always have the best recipes! thanks!

Yummy :) Besides adding a Tbs. cinnamon to the apples, I followed this recipe exactly. I poured the yummy caramel sauce slowly over the pie using a small gravy ladle, carefully filling in the little holes between the lattice work and letting it dribble slowly onto the crust. I had to bake mine a bit longer than the recipe stated to get my apples more tender but I just covered the top with foil so the crust wouldn't burn. Thanks for posting, I'll make it again!

I was a little leery of making this recipe and not my usual one. But I am sure glad I did, it is so delicious, just like a caramel apple pie. I did use a bit more flour then stated and it worked just perfect! I poured all the caramel sauce over the apples in the pan then did my lattice crust and used a milk wash then sprinkled light sugar on top.

This is a great recipe! I made a pie for my boyfriend and I to try and he loved it so much I made another one for him to take home to his family that same day. I got rave reviews and everyone was asking me for the recipe. Before putting the sauce on, I mixed 1 teaspoon of cinnamon with the apples. I also mixed half of the sauce in with the apples and poured the other half over top, like it says to do in the recipe. This really is a fabulous apple pie!

Green or yellow apples are the best for the pie! Add carmel sauce slowly to add flavor. Serve with toffe ice cream or vanilla ice cream to it, if you want the pie sweet! (Serve after dinner time.) Yummy-o! :0)

This recipe is my go to pie in the fall.  Followed directions exactly except used apple pie spice.   No adjustments necessary!  Have never had one any better than this.

This recipe turned out a bit watery for me. While the taste was excellent, I would prefer a bit more "goo" in the pie. Next time, as following other reviewer's, I would add a tsp of cornstarch as a thickener. 
I prepared this using "French pastry pie crust," which made a perfect amount of crust and was extremely flaky and delicious.

Delicious!  Loved the caramel topping.  It was fun to try the lattice top too.  I could only fit 6 apples (4 granny smith, 1 spartan, 1 gala for variety).  I took other reviewers' advice and added 2 tsp cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg and cloves.  Yum!

Wow!  My mother never made apple pie like this, so it was a pretty revolutionary recipe to me.  I used the flaky crust recipe from allrecipes, and it was great.  With the actual apple pie recipe, I made a couple alterations.  I sugared the apples first so that they wouldn't fall after getting into the over (giving us a nice gap between filling and top crust).  Alton Brown trick.  We love Alton Brown.  Anyway, I then added that juice to the sauce, giving it a bit of apple flavor.  I also added a little of my mother's homemade apple butter, again to add a bit more flavor.  Finally, I realized partway through that I didn't have any brown sugar.  So instead, I used half white sugar and half honey.  This gave it a beautiful color and helped out the caramely texture.  The sauce alone was beautiful and tasty.  The pie is absolutely amazing!  Turned out very well for my first attempt at making an apple pie.

This recipe is simply wonderful and I found it very easy to make. I made my own pie crust and then followed the recipe exactly-- I didn't add or take away anything at all. It turned out amazingly. One guest said that my pie was the freshest tasting pie he ever had. I think this is because the sweetener is poured on top instead of as filling. The cooked apples were mildly sweetened by the sugars that melted in through the lattice top and they seemed to be bursting with fresh apple pie flavor. The sugar/butter mix on the lattice top caramelized in baking and was deliciously crispy with fresh crust, warm apples and cold, cold vanilla ice cream.

The pie was very good!  The only problem was the sauce was very thin and didn't thicken. I will make this again, but add 2 Tbs of quick cooking tapioca as suggested by someone the next time.

Oh my, this was delicious! A few changes I made... - Before I put the apples in the pie, I mixed them with cinnamon, a hint of nutmeg and a some vanilla extract
- I didn't do the cross-y sort've crust, so the syrup cooked on top to make a candy sort've top. It was very good!

Absolutely the best apple pie I have ever had. I did add the cinn. (and lots of it) to the apples before putting them in the crust. And Baked in a deeper dish so as not to lose the filling and it was excellent, had great reviews from everyone.

I guess I am one of the few people who did not like this recipe 100%.  I thought the Granny Smith apples were awful--way too tart!  Everything else came out beautifully--the crust, liquid mixture--but no one would eat the pie because the apples were way too tart.  I'd try this recipe again but use different apples.

This was my first homemade apple pie and it was "the best apple pie in the world" according to my fiance (who is the honest type.) It's a very simple recipe with simple ingredients and it was absolutely fantastic! The only alteration I made was to add a pinch of cinnamon to the sauce before pouring onto the apples.

Definitely recommended!!

Fantastic! Also, my first attempt at making an apple pie from scratch and it came out fabulously! I did tweak it by using half Granny Smith apples and half McIntosh apples. Also, I brushed the top with egg whites and sprinkled it with sugar. Oh...and I poured most of the syrup over the apples before putting on the lattice top. I poured the remainder after putting the top on. Yummy!

I used half Granny Smith and half Golden Delicious apples, added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp fresh grated nutmeg, poured it over the apples in the crust.  Applied the top crust, brushed it with cream and sprinkled with sugar.  Very good pie.  Apples were perfect, not too soggy, not undercooked. Excellent recipe.

I was a pie virgin and this great recipe was easy enough for me to be proud of my results. I did slightly edit the recipe (shaved off some butter, added some spices, used double the syrup, vanilla and Empire apples) and baked a little longer than 45min. As someone suggested I mixed the apples with  3/4 of the syrup mixture and then added it to the crust. I used the rest to glaze the top of the pie a few minutes before it was done. I made it on a whim one day for my family and everyone loved it. My sister actually refused to leave until I cut it. Thanks for sharing a little of Grandma Ople's legacy with us.

Wonderful!  I used 2 ready-made crusts (hard to make the lattice top, but worked well enough) 6 honey crisp apples and 6 Tablespoons of flour because my butter and 3 TBL of flour weren't making a sticky paste. This recipe made the most wonderful tasting crust and perfectly textured, non-runny apple pie. I'm not much of an apple pie fan but my boys wanted to make apple pie. Now I want to eat the whole pie up!! It's even better on day 2!

I LOVE this pie. I usually make this exactly as directed.  Pouring the yummy liquid on the top not only gives you a beautiful looking pie, but the crust tastes absolutely wonderful (coming from a person who typically will eat everything BUT the crust!). I actually prefer no cinnamon in this pie, but will oftentimes make my own cinnamon ice cream (recipe is on this site), and it goes perfectly together!  I will make this pie even when apples aren't in season - it's totally worth it. Thanks for sharing!

We loved the flavor and the crisp top crust, but it was VERY runny.  Even after being completely cooled, it was very runny.  I did add a little vanilla to the carmel and sprinkled the apples with cinnamon.

Very good. Just on the edge of too much sweetness, though. Next time I'll use a little less sugar. The top crust is awesome.

This didn't work right, the apples are not really soft, the sauce is very runny, I had to spoon it out of the pie plate.  The only thing good was the lattice crust with the sugary sauce.. made for a crispy goodie.  Will not be making again.  All the hard work of peeling and slicing the apples for something just not good.. sad.

This is such a great pie.  Be sure to use all of the apples though it may seem to be too much, they will cook down.  I had a fear of making the latice top crust but it was very easy and looks great.  My family was so impressed not only with the appearance but with the flavor.  (Looks like it was just picked up from the bakery but tastes better!!)

This is the best apple pie I've ever had in my entire LIFETIME! And this is NOT an exaggeration. I tried it on my selective and diabetic grandmother and she had to force herself to stop eating it! I tested it on 4 others as well, and all of their responses... Wow! Kristy? Did you make this?

My family used to live by Publix apple pie. This put it to SHAME! And it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo easy!!!! I can't describe how much I loved this, Rebecca.

Not sure what happened.  All other ratings are good, but this did not come out nicely at all :(

It did not have a great flavor, I think it may have been b/c I used a store bought crust...hmm.

Hmmm...not sure what the story is with this one. I am never disappointed with recipes rated highly by others but this one just didn't do it for me. The pie was not your typical apple pie with a yummy bubbly filling. Maybe I didn't bake it long enough but the filling was incredibly dry. The glaze poured over the top crust was, however, fantastic...my guests resorted to picking apart the top crust because that was really the only good quality unfortunately.

I must have done something wrong - I thought I followed this recipe exactly, but the inside of my pie was all liquid and the apples were not done.  A big disappointment!

Very interesting way to make it!  You basically cook the butter and sugars together to make almost a caramel.  I also added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg to the apples.  Very good!

this was good - i thought it would be a little more caramelly though. i added cinnamon and some corn starch to the apples - i added some vanilla to the sauce - my apples were so thick that the sauce didn't run all the way through so next time i would try to mix the sauce with the apples. i thought i had too many apples but they cooked down quite a bit. i baked the crust for 10 mins brushed with egg whites and it was perfect. i used a full crust on the top brushed with egg whites and sprinkled with sugar. it looked very pretty when done.

I've never made a better pie.  I made sure to read all the ratings first to get any tips and tricks.  I tossed my apples in cinnamon and brown sugar before I added them in the recipe.  I also made a creamy cream cheese glaze to spread on top when it was almost ready to serve and it made the presentation even more beautiful.  This Pie made me the Star of the potluck meal!

The first apple pie I have made and it turned out great!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added vanilla and cinnamon to the mixture.  I poured half of the sauce on top of the apples and the other half over the lattice crust.  Yum!

mmm tasty. I did however take the advice of others and make some changes. I only used 6 granny smith apples cut up in difference sizes. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon and fresh nutmeg. Also dusted the apples w/ some cornstarch and cinnamon. I made my own crust (which makes a huuuge difference!) and cut back on the sugar a bit. Also be very careful to not overcook the sauce/syrup mixture as I overcooked it the first time and the sugars separated from the butter so I had to throw it out and redo it!. The pie was great! thank you

This pie was absolutly great!!! This made my "hard to please" family begging for more!! But what made it great for me was I accidently left the butter on the stove till it got dark brown. Now it was a mistake but this made the sauce taste like caramel. To me it was a positive turn for me. Worth the try!!

What a nice way to make an apple pie! I also used apple juice instead of the water as many reviewers had suggested. I added some spices too (Apple Pie Spice). Turned out very tasty. Great flavour. :)

It turned out great & everyone loved it.  Tip: After peeling the apples, put them in cold water with a bit of lemon juice.   This will prevent the apples from turning brown

I did like this pie, I thought the taste was good.  I did make some changes.  I did add some cinnamon to it, also a little vanilla extract.  I followed the advice of others, instead of pouring all of the mixture on top of the pie, I did mix the apples in about half of the mix, then poured the rest over the top.  My pie did come out a little runny, although I did add some extra flour.  It tasted pretty good warm with some homemade vanilla ice cream!

I have been making the Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe from this site for years now - The only change I made to the recipe was I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon in the sauce. Last summer I won second place in the Basalt River Days Pie Contest. Beat out only by my mother who won the blue ribbon for her Peach pie.

This is a good, basic pie recipe. It didn't "wow" us, but it was well enjoyed! I will make it again, adding cinnamon & other pie spices. I didn't need 8 apples, either: 5 or 6 would have sufficed. I used Granny Smith apples, and the pie was just sweet enough.

I wish I could give this more stars!  What a wonderful recipe.  I love making apple pie but everytime I do it is a bit too runny no matter what modifications I make.  This one however sets like store bought but tastes like what my grandma used to make.  I also added 1 teas. each of cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples before putting the latice on top.  The presentation is perfect and the taste is even better. I will be making this plenty of times before Thanksgiving!  The best allrecipes dessert recipe by far!

This recipe was great..My family loved it....Thanks... I took the advice from 2 other reviews. I tossed the apples in cinnamon and sugar before puttting them in the crust. I also added 1 -2 tablespoons flour to thicken the sauce...

This is a wonderful apple pie.  My daughters and I have made it many times now and it is always wonderful and easy.  We use ready made pie crust and make a lattice crust on top.  We pour most of the syrup on before we put the crust on -- then put the crust on -- then pour a little of the syrup over the crust.  We made this all the time -- it is easy and always comes out perfect. It looks beautiful too!

I made this for my parents.  Before tasting it my mother said, "I'm sorry, but without cinammon, it is not going to be apple pie."  She soon found herself eating her words, as well as my pie.  My dad couldn't get enough.  I will still make your typical apple pie(occassionaly); however, I will definitely make this again and again, because it was so easy.  You can memorize this recipe; it is so simple.  With a ready made crust and the use of a apple/corer/slicer,  I can have this oven ready in ten minutes.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

This was a very good pie, easy to make, and very pretty.  I added spices as a personal preference, but I am sure it would be great as is.  We used a little bit of the left over syrup as a dip for apple slices.  Yum!

I've been using this recipe for years now, and I thought it was about time I posted a review.  This recipe is to die for!  I make it several times a year.  It's easy to double or triple the recipe and make a few at once, even!  Pouring the filling over the dough is the magic touch- makes the top crust a treat all its own!
Fantastic!!

Awesome! I sprinkled a little cinnamon and vanilla between the layers of apples because I love the flavor of both. This is a VERY good apple pie! 

Side note - do NOT overfill the dish with the butter/sugar mixture. If it drips onto the bottom of your oven - it WILL burn quickly.

If you look at the recipe as written, it is sweetened apples with thickener....absolutely no
spices,and *bland*.  If you have to add to the recipe to give it flavor, it's not a 5* recipe, it's a 4* that needs some help.  This one could
be improved with a little salt and a lot of cinnamon.  It is a beautiful presentation though.

This is the best apple pie I have ever made.  I do add some cinnamon to the mixture and pour mixture on top of apples (leaving just a little) then apply the latice top.  Then brush the remaining filling on the crust. This pie is awesome!!

Out of five pies at Thanksgiving, this one was the only one devoured.  It looked so beautiful and tasted even better!  I don't, however, recommend increasing the amount of sauce -- I doubled it and it ran all over the place!  Also, because other reviewers said they could only fit 5 apples in the pie, I only bought that many.  I could only fit 3 apples, though - and they weren't even large.

I have never particularly liked fruit pies, but I LOVE this. I have never made an apple pie before, and this turned out perfectly. I put the pie on a tray to stop the liquid from spilling over. I will definitely make this again! Thanks Rebecca

The pie looked absolutely gorgeous. Added some nutmeg and mixed half of the sauce into the apples before placing the apples into the crust. Didn't bother with the lattice work and just added some slits to the top crust. Gave it as a gift to a friend and they said it did not last long. A keeper!

I added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  The pie tasted delicious, but it's appearance wasn't what I expected.  The syrup didn't glaze the crust, it just sort of glopped over it.  I think perhaps that's my fault though, I let the syrup sit a little while before pouring it over the pie, maybe it thickened while standing.  Anyway, I'd still recommend this recipe on taste alone, and I'll definately try it again.

GREAT PIE!!  Second apple pie I have ever made.  Very tasty and looked dazzling.  My husband loved it.  I added cinnamon and used the cream cheese pie crust from the crust section. Very easy and well worth the peeling and coring.  Thanks for sharing such a great pie.

I’ve made this pie two times and it’s always delicious. Do not change the recipe. I only suggest adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon after putting the apples in the pan.

I ventured out and made my first scratch made apple pie last night (crust is store bought). Words can’t describe the deliciousness of this #applepie. It’s not a traditional apple pie because it doesn’t have cinnamon or any of those spices. It’s just good ‘ol granny smith apples, butter, flour, sugar, brown sugar and water. I almost altered the recipe, but I’m so glad I didn’t! I figured if Grandma Ople perfected then it who am I to alter?! You know what I love about this recipe? It’s all about the apples! By not having cinnamon or the other spices, you taste the tartness of the granny smith apples, but the sugar and brown sugar balance it so well that it’s that perfect balance of tart and sweet. The flaky crust gives it a bit of crunch. Then take it over the top with a scoop (or 2...) of Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream that slowly melts as it sits on a heap of freshly sliced, warm apple pie!!! My goodness, I woke up this morning thinking about this pie and how I can justify having a slice for breakfast! Do yourself a favor and make this recipe unaltered at least once to truly appreciate the amazingness if this recipe. I was a pinch away from adding just a bit of cinnamon, but I felt like I was disrespecting Grandma Ople by at least not trying it once unaltered! I’m SO GLAD I didn’t veer off Grandma Ople’s apple pie path! My husband and I were beyond shocked that I made something that looked and tasted like an award-winning pie! THANK YOU GRANDMA OPLE!!!

This was my first time making an apple pie and this recipe is great!  I did not make a lattice crust on top.  I bought a two pack pie crust, filled one pie crust with the filling and just put the other crust on top.  Wonderful! This is THE apple pie recipe.

Made it exactly as described (sprinkled some cinnamon on dry cut apples) placed dry apples in crust did lattice top and then made the sauce last- the entire time I was making sauce questioning everything about it as at first it was runny not paste but then I added water and somehow THE WATER made this work? But still the questions in my head were how this would work as sauce was thickish and appeared to stay on top of pie as I poured sloooowly aiming for holes in lattice to get down in to apples but truly .... I threw my faith into the recipe and gramma opal and just went for it thinking if I need to change it next time I will! Well no need to change it believe me the sauce mixes in with apples juice as it’s bubbling and cooking and honest to Pete it’s perfect ! Let it cool completely if you can wait that long :) top was crunchy and inside was Carmely lol I used salted butter because that’s what I had and it was amazing -

I followed the recipe but followed some others suggestions. I added 2 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tbsp of vanilla. I did not do the lattice on top. I just cut slits. Next time I will cut the apples into smaller slices because I used an apple slicer which made the apple cuts huge!! Also 8 apples is way too much. I used 6 at most but my apples were very large. I also put egg wash on the base and top. And then sprinkled sugar on top! This was a fantastic recipe and will use again!!!

Best apple pie ever! A little advice: prepare your pie first -  crust and apples and lattice the top. Then, prepare the filling and pour it over your latticed pie while super hot and still flowing easily. Every time I make this I get rave reviews!

I’ve made this about five times now and I’ll never get tired of having a fat slice with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. I adopted some suggestions made by other users: toss your sliced, peeled apples (I use 5-6 gala apples for a 9-inch pie) in 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla extract. Add the caramel sauce to the apples and mix to coat apples evenly before adding it to your pie crust (Pillsbury pre-made crust is pretty bomb and it saves so much time). Lattice the top crust to make it look legit and then bake at 350F, middle rack for 50 min. Be sure to use a baking sheet underneath to catch any overflow. Enjoy!

you want to talk about one tasty pie!  I added cinnamon to my apples and a little to the sauce because am a cinnamon fanatic, but other than that the recipe is totally on point.  Delicious!

I sprinkled cinnamon on the apples, added a tsp of vanilla extract to the sauce as well as a very tiny pinch of salt. I made the sauce and poured it over the lattice and cooked for the initial high temp bake and I got worried it wouldn't be enough to cover the apples so I made another batch of sauce scaled to 6tbsp butter and poured that over. My apples weren't as tender as I wanted when the time was up but the crust had good color so I turned the heat down to 300 and baked an extra 20 mins. Exquisite!

There is NO recipe like this one, the absolute BEST apple pie ever! Have made this several times and always get rave reviews. I add about a tbsp of cinnamon to my apples, toss to coat. I don't do the lattice top so I just pour the sauce directly over the apples and top with the crust. You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

Love making this and all my family and friends love eating it! If I’m in a pinch for time I use the Pillsbury premade pie crust and it is still delicious. I usually also add a bourbon caramel sauce for the adults.

I made this following the recipe exactly at the advice of another reviewer and it turned out perfect.  The only hiccup I had was that it spilled over in the baking process.  I have read some reviews that others used a deep dish 9 inch - so that might help.  My pie dish was standard.  It did not take anything away from the overall flavor, it was excellent!

I’ve made this pie twice in the last 2 weeks. My first attempt was good but I didn’t have enough apples. So I made it again today and not only did I double the apples, I put cinnamon in the recipe. This pie is definitely a keeper and will be my go to recipe when I want a fresh apple pie. If you aren’t a baker, you’ll seem like one with this!!

This is the best apple pie recipe. My family raved about it and asked that I make it again for Christmas! I used Chef John’s double crust recipe and added the liquid to the pie and apples before putting the top crust on. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the apples as others suggested.

First time ever making an apple pie, and it turned out amazing! I used the cinnamon and vanilla suggestion on the apples before putting them in the crust. My only change for next time is to get the lattice strips cut before I make the sauce.

Super easy to make. I read quite a few of the reviews and added some cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to the sauce. Definitely not necessary but I enjoy those flavors in my apple pie. I used Golden Delicious apples because they were available but I will try to find the Granny Smith’s next time. I think the sauce balances the tartness nicely. Great recipe and will now be my go-to recipe for apple pie.

I LOVE this recipe!! Pouring the filling over the top of the crust is genius!!!!! I followed a previous review & took their advice of seasoning my apples before I put them into my pie shells. I used pumpkin pie spice. They turned out amazing!! I will say, the only thing I will do differently next time, is brush that filling over every inch of my crust to give it an even golden crust.

Holy smokes, Grandma Ople knows her stuff. This pie is delicious!!!! I think this is the best apple pie I’ve ever had. I stuck pretty close to the recipe with the exception of adding some sauce to the apples before putting the lattice top on and adding the rest. I didn’t count apples, just added until the pie plate was heaping full - I used a bag of small/med green apples. No cinnamon or other spices were added and it’s absolutely perfect. Like others have said the sauce on top becomes kind of caramelized and it’s fantastic. I will recommend this to anyone and everyone. Make this pie! You will not regret it.

I tweaked the pie and it was delicious:
1. I tossed the apple slices in cinnamon
2. I mixed in fresh ground cloves
3. I would use 6-7 apples next time as I could barely criss cross the pastry over the top - even when I rolled it out to be quite thin.

Loved this recipe so much that I used the filling for tarts, strudels and pies.  I didn't stray too much from the original but added a touch of maple and a caramel drizzle on the strudel.  Will be my go to for anything apple!

This is the best apple pie I've ever made!  And maybe ever eaten!  Before I tried this recipe, the last few times I made apple pie, I have been super disappointed with those recipes to the point that I thought maybe I just didn't like apple pie anymore.  It seemed like the sugar didn't really melt and make that gooey decadent filling that I wanted.  So I got to wondering if it would work to melt the sugar into a sauce to pour on the apples.  I was so happy to find this recipe that did just that!!  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon because I like that flavor for apple pie as well as a pinch of salt.  Also, I just poured the syrup on the apples and then put the top crust on without doing the lattice work due to limited time.  It was definitely 5 star and it wasn't just a fluke.  I've made it twice now and it was fabulous both times.

The BEST apple pie! Delicious!!! Only suggestion is to toss the sliced apples with some sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract before putting them in the pie. Otherwise, perfect!

Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sauce which turned out fine. I highly recommend using The Pioneer Woman’s recipe for pie crust which results in an extra flaky crust.

I followed the recipe to the letter. The filling came out liquid runny and it was extremely sweet.  The taste was ok but just too sweet for my liking. I had never used brown sugar before for the filling and wanted to try it. I found it odd that there was no cinnamon and/or nutmeg in the recipe.  I cannot figure out why it was so runny.  The recipe didn't state how long to simmer the butter and sugar mixture so maybe that was why?  I'm going to go back to my previous recipe.

I have made this amazing apple pie so many times now I don't even need the recipe! Always gets the best compliments! My only alteration is adding cinnamon and nutmeg in with the apples.

It looked beautiful until we cut into it. The filling was like water. What did I do wrong with your recipe?

I followed the recipe accordingly, except for the lattice crust.  I used a full top crust, the pie turned out great.  Only thing I would do next time is to add some cinnamon to enhance the flavor.

I definitely added spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla), and poured it over the apples BEFORE putting the lattice over the top. I egg-washed the crust. Delish

Followed recipe and agree with those who suggested it not be altered. The apple flavor was delicious! I prepped the pie including the lattice before I made the sauce. Came out perfect; this will be my "go-to" apple pie recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing.

Hands down the best pie ever. My whole family loved it, my boyfriend said it saved Thanksgiving, and it was so much better than store bought. I made it pretty much exactly as the recipe called for, couldn't believe 8 apples could fit into one 9 inch pan.  The only difference I made was tossing the apples with a little bit of the caramel sauce before pouring them in, covering the pie with the lattice, and then pouring the rest of the sauce on top and basting it over the top crust. Protip, make the sauce after making the lattice so that you can pour it immediately into/onto the pie, it cools off and hardens quickly! 

We'll be eating it again for Christmas.

Made it, added the sugar mix to the apples. Peeling and cutting the apples took the longest. Looks good we’ll taste it tomorrow for Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgivings

I am 75 years old and have baked pies most of my life.  this is the apple pie recipe I use.  I've made it many times.  I pour the butter/sugar mixture over my apples before putting the top crust on, not because it's the best way to do it, only because it's easiest for me.  I'm always asked to bring this pie whenever we have family/friend get-togethers.  (I also add a tsp of cinnamon, just because we like it).  Thank you Grandma Ople.

I made this for the first time last year.  In first reviewing the recipe I thought it had way too much butter but, thinking of Julia Childs, I carried on and added every bit.  I did make a change adding a small percentage of Honey Crisp apples with the Granny Smith.  I thought it was delicious and was happy when my niece raved about it and my sister asked me to make it again this year.

All would have been fine if the bottom pie crust would have been baked before adding the filling.  I  baked it , its beautiful, filling is tasty BUT bottom crust is raw. Pre bake crust before adding filling and it will be perfect. (Did I miss that in the instructions?)

The pie looked remarkably good.  Compared to my usual apple pie recipe, which is a basic 2 crust pie with spices, I thought Grandma  O's pie was good, but didn't measure up to my standard.  The pie was very liquidy and although I cut the apple slices rather thin, it was not cooked through and the apples were still too firm after following the instructed length of baking time.    I'd like to try this pie again using less water to see if that changes anything.  Honestly, it's the first time I've ever added WATER to an apple pie.

Very good but instead of butter I would use coconut oil or Some other vegetable oil to get away from animal products since I don't believe in using or eating animal or dairy products. Otherwise it was extremely delicious. I used red delicious apples instead of Granny Smith. I found the Red Delicious apples laying in the road. These were not store bought so they had a VERY delicious flavor. I WOULD recommend using home grown apples instead of store bought because of course the flavor is a LOT better.

this recipe was very easy to follow and the final result was absolutely amazing. I followed the instructions given for the most part, with a few variations. the first time I made it, adding the sauce over the crust made it sag a little, so for the second pie I alternated between layers of apples and sauce and put the crust on top at the end. I also added a little nutmeg and cinnamon. 
and to the reviewer who complained about the sauce being ruined once it cooled, I found that all you had to do to return it to its liquid consistency was to add a little more water and let it simmer for a bit, stirring regularly.

This is a very delicious attractive looking pie.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  My family loved it!  I added 1 TBSP of cinnamon to the apples as suggested in previous reviews.  Will make again!

I have made this recipe for years now and now my daughters are using it. We sometimes add cinnamon or just change it a bit for a switch but it is the BEST Apple pie EVER! I have had to add more flour and one of my daughters adds more sugar depending on the type of apple she is using. You always have to take into account that the apples themselves have liquid so may need to adjust. I wouldn't bother trying any other apple pie recipe as this one is the favorite of all I have tried.

This was an amazingly delicious and easy to bake pie. It will become part of my repertoire, as my husband loves apple pie and this recipe is much better than the frozen Marie Callender pie he usually gets. I did make some changes, of course, after reading other reviews.  I added a tsp. of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. vanilla and two extra Tbsp. of flour.  I made sure to cook the flour long enough so it lost its taste when making the roux. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Oh! I only had Gala apples on hand, so that's what I used. I am sure it would have been quite tasty without the changes, but I never quite follow any recipe ;)

My family and I enjoyed this apple pie.  It was our first time making an apple pie.  It is so easy to prepare and it tastes exquisite.  I choose this one because my 8 years old son doesn't like cinnamon, so it was a hit to find this recipe and he was so happy as we were delighted.  Thank you for sharing Grandma Ople's secret.

Love this simple recipe. I did change the flour to 3 1/2 Tbs and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg. I was too lazy to make lattice crust.  So, before I top crusted the pie, I poured the sugar mixture over the apples, reserving a little. I put the top crust on and brushed the remaining mixture on top. Cut slits in it and popped it in the oven! It was amazing. I do recommend you use Granny Smith apples. I made it twice. First time I used Macouns. It came out delish but a bit mushy. Second time I used Granny Smith (Do NOT slice them too thin.)...PERFECTION!

The flavors of this pie were all there. I would definitely recommend mixing the syrup with the apples before placing in the pie. I also switched out a tablespoon of water for a tablespoon of vanilla extract for some extra flavor. Simple and delicious!

This was the best apple pie I've ever eaten!  I agree with the lady who said to have your pie ready to pour the butter mixture over it.  I almost let it sit too long trying to make my lattice look perfect.  Saved to favorites!!

Excellent apple pie recipe. I've used the same recipe for years but after making this one, I will be switching! Based on recommendations, I added a tsp. of cinnamon and vanilla to the sauce. It was perfect - just the right amount. I also mixed 2/3 of the sauce with the apples prior to putting them in the pie. Then I spread the rest of the glaze over the top crust. Absolutely delicious!

I made this yesterday after my kids had an apple picking field trip.  I have only made apple pie a few times and have never really been satisfied with the results, but this one was wonderful!  My husband took one bite and said it was the best apple pie I ever made.  I was a little skeptical about the sauce and pouring it over the lattice, but it gave the lattice an almost candy coated taste that was amazing. I was also worried about no cinnamon in the recipe, but the sauce was delicious with the brown sugar.  I will definitely make this one again!

I've been making this for years & love it.  Giving 4 stars because of a couple changes. Except I stir 2/3 of mixture into apples along with 1/2 TBSP cinnamon,  then put into bottom crust, top with whatever lattice type design you wish and then pour remainder over top.

LOVE your grandmother's pie recipe! This is the first time I've ever loved a recipe enough to review it. The only thing I add is a bit of cinnamon sprinkled over the apples before I put the lattice on. Followed your directions and this is about the 5th time I've made it, it's always beautiful and delicious! Thank you. PS I've baked a lot of apple pies in my life too!

This was my first attempt at making apple pie. In general I don't like apple pie. But I LOVED this pie! I did add cinnamon, because I love cinnamon. And I used a variety of apples not just Granny Smith. It came out perfect and got rave reviews! I've made it about 5 times  (at least) in the last year!

Really good!  I would use aluminum foil since my pie started to get pretty dark.  I need to say I used all macintosh apples vs granny smith. It did not come out mushy but it was too sweet. Cut back the sugar if not using tart apples!  Next time I'll use granny smith's.

Halved the recipe for a small pie with no top crust ( we are a small family of 4 ). Sprinkled cinnamon on the apples and then topped with the mixture to bake. Absolutely loved it!

This is the same recipe as the 'Apple Pie by Grandma Ople' on this site, so to repeat what I said in that review...this is delicious and beautiful! I added in about 1 teaspoon cinnamon and combined the sugar mixture with the apples instead of waiting to put it on top, which worked out nicely. I do think, at least in my oven, it needs to be cooked longer. I sliced my apples really thin and they still were a bit on the hard/chewy side, so make note of that. Other than that, this is a great pie recipe and one I will be using again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was a good pie, very filling (Get it?). However, the sheer amount of sugar in it makes it very intense, and anyone watching their blood sugar should be weary.

I have made a lot of pies over the years and this is by far the best apple pie you will ever eat. I was a little skeptical with pouring the hot sauce over the crust but believe me it was absolutely amazing.
This is for sure the only apple pie I will ever bake.

I cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup each. For us, it was perfect. This is a keeper!

What can I say that others haven't.  This is the best apple pie ever.  I've been making now for a few years and it is a family must for Thanksgiving at this point.  I do find it easier to mix in the caramel sauce with the apples first, as other reviewers have suggested.  It is truly delicious!

Today was the third time making this pie and there is nothing better.  I made a few minor additions you may want to try. I added about a tspn of cinnamon, half cup of walnuts, the zest from one lemon and the juice from half a lemon to the apple mixture.  Also used only brown sugar and pored the majority of the syrup mixture on the apples before adding the lattice strips.6 or 7 apples is enough.

I just used the basic recipe, no cinnamon or any fancy additives, my wife said it was the best Apple Pie that she has ever had. It is nice and quick and simple to make.

This apple pie is always a hit! I don't do the lattice top and instead just put the whole top on and put sliys to vent. I also end up adding more flour than the recipe calls for. I start with 3 tablespoons and then add a little at a time to get the paste like consistantsy called for.

This was so simple and awesome!  We used refrigerated pie crusts and honey crisp apples. We also sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking. Not a piece remained!  Little vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and you are all set!

This makes a great pie and it's easy to put together, BUT,  I made changes.  I added 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice to the cooked mixture before pouring on.  I had to cook it for 60 minutes at 350  degrees F to completely soften the Granny Smith apples.  I know my oven is accurate as i use an oven thermometer, so I personally think the heat should be increased to 400 degrees F to bake it in 45 minutes.  You will have to cover the pie edges with aluminum foil and tent the middle to prevent over-browning the top crust.  Good plan, horrible execution.

Fabulously amazing perfect apple pie.  I usually have trouble with apple pies being runny.  Not this one!  So delicious, made as written and five of us ate almost the whole pie at one sitting.  It's that good!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit with the entire family. Pouring the warm sauce over the lattice gives it a beautiful glazed finish. Top a slice off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for the perfect finishing touch.

The best recipe for apple pie on the planet!  Like others, I used only 7 apples (6 granny smith and 1 ambrosia) and added 2t. cinnamon.  It was the first dessert to vanish at a Christmas pot luck.

Amazing!! The only thing I added extra was 1tsp of Apple pie spice to the melted butter mixture and proceeded as directed. This is by far the best apple pie I have ever had. I only wish I made several more to give to my friends. It's pretty tiring coring the apples and peeling them but definitely worth the work!

I made this as it told me to and it came out perfect! I did use a variety of apples though - Granny Smith, Golden Delicious and Fuji.  The only minor addition was I tossed the apples with about a tablespoon of cinnamon beforehand.  It was absolutely delicious and will definitely be making again!

This is my go-to apple pie recipe! I add a little bit of cinnamon but other than that it's perfect! I make several of these pies each year, my family always requests it.  Awesome!

This is my go-to apple pie recipe! I add a little bit of cinnamon but other than that it's perfect! I make several of these pies each year, my family always requests it.  Awesome!

My changes, 2 tablespoons of flour, 1/3 cup of water, 3/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 white. I did it both ways pour over and mix apples in...mix apples in wins, remember to save enough back to brush on top crust.

I didn't put in as much sugar because I prefer a less sweet flavor.   Everyone loved it!

I made this just as written and it is absolutely amazing! My first time making a lattice crust which is really not all that hard and so worth it!

Good recipe. Did use a combination of apples like Jonagold, Granny Smith and honey crisp for a less tart pie.

I put nutmeg and cinnamon on the apples before I put them into the pie crust. Also, did not lattice. I punched Apple shapes into the top crust. I poured most of the sauce on the apples befor putting the top on. Used the rest of the sauce to paint the top of the crust. It was delicious!

Be sure that you don't let the liquid simmer for too long.  I did and it started to turn in to a carmel and it wouldn't seep in to the apples.  It just sat on the top.

I made it before and it is very good but it had no spices in it, which I really missed. I'm making it again for Thanksgiving but I'm adding cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of cloves to it. I also didn't care for the mess the sauce made when I poured it over the crust last time, so I'm putting the crust on after the sauce and I'll brush the crust with milk and sugar instead.

I have made this at least a dozen times.  I do add cinnamon to the apples.  My husband and I love this!  I have a question though.  Does anyone get this recipe to slice like a pie?  Mine always falls apart and must be scooped out.

I will never understand why people change the recipe or make a mistake in the process and then take it out on the review.  Really?  This is one great recipe and the only apple pie I make after finding the recipe 5 years ago.  I've been baking for over 40 years and this is GREAT.  Thank you for sharing it.

I've made this pie twice now and it tastes great. My number one piece of advice to avoid a disaster - as I had with my second attempt is to not overcook the sauce. On my first try, I made the lattice in advance and mixed the sauce with the apples, and saved some to pour over. The second time, I followed the recipe exactly. I would not recommend working on the lattice while the sauce simmers. It cannot simmer unattended and really only needs to just barely thicken. My was too thick and wouldn't penetrate the crust. I had to scrape it off (looked ugly and ruined my lattice). Then I made a new sauce, stirring constantly at a low flame for 5 minutes, and poured that into holes I made in the top. Good luck! It's definitely worth a try with some precautions.

I poured 1/2 the sauce directly on top of  the apples rather than try to drizzle through the holes.  The other half I poured on top but it slid off and burned onto the parchment paper line cookie sheet I placed the pie on in the oven.  The burning sugar  made the house smell bad.  Next time I'll try 3/4 in and only 1/4 on top.  At the point of turning the oven down, I removed the parchment and there were no more drips.  Tasted great.  My guests loved it

I've been making this Apple Pie for over 8 years. It's always turning out good. Granny Smith is not available where I'm living, and always use Fuji Apples. Fuji's texture is perfect and I also add 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1-2 TBS of Rum during making caramel. Rum makes the taste more gorgeous. To save time, I use "ready to bake"- frozen pie shell and sheets from the supermarket.

Perfect!  I mixed the apples with the sauce and didnt pour it on top.  Brushed the bottom crust with egg white for crusty bottom and brushed with whole egg wash on top crust with sugar crystals sprinkled.  Just add 1 tsp cinnamon, few sprinkles of nutmeg and sprinkles of ginger with the sauce. Cooked it for 1 hour at 350.

My family loved this pie. However i did add cinnamon and  nutmeg to the sauce, and about two tablespoons of lemon to the apples. I also mixed everything together before placing it into the pie pan.  I did not do the lattice on top just added my pie crust on top and made my slits. delicious and will be making another one again tonight.

I rated this only a 4 because it did not include any cinnamon which I did add to the apples before the sauce.  I made mini tarts 5" and 3" instead of a pie. 4 cups of chopped apples with this recipes sauce made a half dozen 5" plus a dozen 3" tarts.  Baked for 10 minutes at 425 and then 10 more at 375.  Wonderful little tea treats for my classmates.

I used cornstarch instead of flour.  1/2 tsp. for every cup of apples. I also used 1/4 c. of splenda and 1/4 c. of white sugar along with the 1/2c. brown sugar.  This made a great tasting pie.  I will make this again.

I've been making this pie recipe for three years running and everyone loves it my father is extremely picky with pie and can't get enough of this one. Apple pie is a fave of mine and I always tried to make it and it always seemed to taste off to me or had to many ingredients such as raisins or lemon zest this is a simple pie with a lot of flavor and I use it for every occasion.

I went through the recipe following the instructions, and went back to make sure I got everything.  WHERE IS THE CINNAMON AND NUTMEG? You can't make apple pie without cinnamon and nutmeg. Don't worry. I fixed it. 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves. I also brushed the top crust with egg wash and sprinkled it with cinnamon-sugar.  You can fix the recipe. You're welcome.

I just made this for a friend's dinner party and it was a success! Followed others' advice of tossing the apples with cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly (as in, I did a lattice crust and poured the filling OVER the top), and it came out great! Also, someone else said to put aluminum foil on until the last 20 minutes of the bake, and that worked well for me too, so thanks for all the suggestions everyone! :)

This has become my standard apple pie recipe, with a few changes.  I put the sliced apples in a bowl and toss with a little lemon juice, pour the sugar mixture in, mix and let it sit for a few minutes before pouring into the crust. I don't do the lattice top, just a regular one with slits cut in, brushed with an egg white and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar (like you'd use to make cinnamon toast). I always line a cookie sheet with foil and place the pie on that so it won't spill over into the oven (and the foil keeps it from burning onto the cookie sheet). When turning the heat down after the first 15 minutes, I put a pie shield around the edge of the crust to keep it from over-browning. This pie always gets rave reviews, no need to keep searching for another recipe. This one's a keeper.

I took this to our RV club outing and shared it with the members. Unanimously it was the best apple pie any of them ever had! Everyone asked for the recipe. It's my new Go-To apple pie now! I did add cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to my sauce.

I read thru many of the reviews and just decided to make a few tweeks for my preference. Used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. Cut the Granny Smith apples thin (1/8") and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 3 tabls of corn starch to the butter mixture. poured it all over the pie crust. Put foil over the  crust after the first 425/15 minutes. And cooked it the full 45 minutes on 350. Turned out great.  Set well.

Would not make any changes, I have made numerous times and it is a family favorite.  I make every Thanksgiving.  It turns out perfectly.  Using the sugar sauce over the crust makes it crunchy and so brown.  Amazing

I've made this on 3 occasions now and it is fool-proof and insanely good! I grew up in Nashville so this southern girl had to follow Chef Dare's review recommendation of tossing the apples with cinnamon and using BOURBON!!! for half of the water called for. I can't imagine doing apple pie any other way now. My other signature pie has bourbon in it as well. Just gives it that 'something extra'. Seriously, try it!

I did not change a thing and it was delicious.  I love Granny Smith apples and always used them in my pies.  I have made this more than once and will continue to use this recipe any time I want an apple pie.

Y-U-M!! This pie is outstanding. I used pillsbury pre made pie crust but will try with homemade crust next time! Tip- just make sure when you are making the sugar filling your butter isn't too hot when you add the flour! It's really important for the flour to incorporate with the butter for a smooth mixture before adding the water and sugars - otherwise you'll end up with an oily, granular mess! Will be making this pie again FOR SURE.

Wow! Best apple pie I've ever had.  Only change I made was adding 1 tsp cinnamon to sugar mix.  Delish!

With a five star rating from over 2K reviewers, this is the King, Queen and Ace of apple pies. The buttery caramel sauce is what makes this pie great. No disturbing tartness. No dry apples inside. Juicy, sweet and too good for just one serving. Pair it with a homemade butter crust and you've entered heaven. Try not to die, though. You'll want to make this again.

Made this twice now and it is seriously good!!!!   I added the cinnamon to the apples, and found it easier to pour the majority of the sauce on the pie with the top crust off.  We actually used cookie cutters and cut fun shapes out of the top crust, then it was easy to put it on and pour the remaining sauce on the top crust quickly before everything cooled.

Incredible pie. The best I've ever had. And so easy! I've made this pie 3 times. It's definitely easier to mix the apples with most of the caramel sauce before you put the apples in the pie.  I reserve a little sauce to pour over or brush on the top crust. Also I always add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the sauce. Ridiculously delicious.

Perfection!! Turned out absolutely perfect. I prepared the apple pie filling ahead of time by sautéing in a pan in the butter and until fork tender but still retaining shape. Then added sugar and spices (Cinnamon, dash of nutmeg and dash of cloves(, then took off the heat and added apple cider (instead of water since I had it) and lemon juice. I reserved some liquid to pour over the crust. I cooked it about 50 min until crust was finished. Lattice top crust is a must so filling is not too much liquid. It was the best apple pie I ever had! :-) UPDATE: 6 apples seems to work better than 8. There wasn't enough crust to apple ratio for my taste with 8 by a long shot. BOttom crust was not crispy enough...maybe prebake next time? It's been too soupy a few times so next time I will be sure to add more flour or use less liquid. Still delicious though.

This pie had my family begging for more. It was SO good and SO easy. I used only six apples and that was plenty. I also sautéd half of the apples before I put them in the pie. Also, as suggested in a different review, I tossed the apples in cinnamon before baking them. It was amazing! If you're looking for a good apple pie recipe this is it!

Absolutely delicious and perfect.  Love the carmelized goodness on the crust.  Great flavor.  Added a pinch of cinnamon.  This is my new go-to.

This was amazing.  Followed to the letter except I used a double crust vs the basket weave crust.  Great!

This was amazing.  Followed to the letter except I used a double crust vs the basket weave crust.  Great!

This is my favorite pie of all time.  The simplicity of the recipe allows the fresh taste of apples to shine through.  Made this recipe as written with no changes.
I usually make buttermilk pie for holidays because it is a family favorite;but after heavy holiday meals, the fresh fruit pie will be a nice treat.  Ice cream on the side will be available for those who want to embellish.  I will be eating mine as is, its perfect that way.

I am so glad I found this recipe on line!  What a perfect apple pie.  It was easy to prepare and when I tasted it, it was just like the pie my mom used to make; absolutely delicious!   Talk about going back in time.  Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe.  It was such a hit, and my family is showering my new baking talents with praise.  Wonderful!!!

I have used allrecipes for years and never left a review...however, this pie is review worthy! Everyone loved it. I used a butter pie crust and that was delicious too. The Granny Smith apples were the perfect choice, just the right apple taste. I sliced them thin. I used only a pinch of cinnamon otherwise stuck to the recipe. I will make this one again and again.

Excellent pie.   I've always thought that apple pies were all pretty much the same give or take a few minor differences.   However, this one is different...and delish.   One note, the recipe says to let the liquid simmer, but doesn't say for how long.   I let it simmer for about 8 or 9 minutes, just long enough for it to thicken up a bit.

I've made this pie many times and the only thing I do differently than the recipe is to add a tbs of cinnamon to the apples before putting them in the pie.  It gets ooohh and aahhhs every time I make it. Two thumbs up!

I liked this recipie very much. I've made it twice. Altered it just a bit the second time and loved it. Added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half of a teaspoon of nutmeg. Also took out a teaspoon of water and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Added a few heart cut-outs on top to pretty it up. Was tasty and cute. :)

Ive made this pie a dozen times now and everyone always raves on how good it is.I made a few tweaks however and now I think it is perfect! First I use about 7 large Macintosh apples I'm not a fan of the tart granny Smith's, I peel and cut them, add some lemon toss in cinnamon sugar. While cutting the apples I start the caramel sauce. Make sure to let your rue thicken before adding sugars and water and really let it simmer. If you don't the sauce will become separated. Once it's bubbling and almost coming up over the sides I turn off and let it thicken just a bit. I use betty Crocker pie crust. Place in pie tin, add some egg wash to it this will give you a crispier pie crust. I like to add some cinnamon sugar on it as well. Add apples and pour 3/4 mixture. Then cut top pie crust in strips, brush with egg wash. Lattice the top, add the rest of your sauce and sprinkle some cinnamon sugar. Place pie on baking sheet with some foil or it will overflow in your oven. Mmmh first pie where I actually like the crust. Don't taste the caramel sauce it will burn your tongue, you would think I would learn but I swear I've burnt it five times making this pie! Happy baking!!

Well, I wasn't aware that I was supposed to use light brown sugar so mine turned out a lot darker than what I'm familiar with.  The sauce was really thick and didn't go into the pie, it all stayed on top.

Last year for Thanksgiving we tried several apple pies. This was our favorite and it is a beautiful pie! We (mostly my 14 year-old son) have made it with and without spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc.) both are great, but I am a cinnamon addict so I usually add spices to the apples. 
Other than that the only other change would be my favorite pie crust, but this is an excellent pie! On Christmas Eve last year one guest was full and only wanted a sliver, it was so good he went back for a second larger helping and said "it is healthy, it is just apple salad" so in our house we just call it Apple Salad now and have a large "healthy" piece;)

This recipe was easy and amazing! I also added some cinnimon sugar to the apple and coated them evenly.  The recipe for the crust is an easy 3 ingredient crust I found on pintrest. Look for easy no fail pie crust.

My favorite apple pie ever! I made this recipe when I was in middle school with a little help from my dad for Thanksgiving and it was definitely one of the most memorable desserts I have ever made :)

Simple and delicious recipe.  I added some cinnamon and a crumble topping instead of a lattice because my family loves crumble, but the core of this pie is great.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is such a great recipe! I have made it multiple times and adding a teaspoon of cinnamon helps take it to the next level! I also tried it alamode. So delicious! I recommend this to everyone who reads this review. When I was making it the first time, I was worried that if I put ONLY G. Smiths in, it would be too tart. I stand corrected. Just the perfect amount of tart. I feel like the sugar kind of helps balance out the flavors pretty darn well. When I took the first bite, I couldn't stop eating it! I ate until I was physically and mentally sick of this apple pie, and yet, I make it again. :) To all of you who are worried that it is too tart, don't sweat it. Follow the recipe ;)

This was my first attempt ever at making a pie.  It turned out perfect.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the apples (per another reviewers recommendation).  I used 8 apples and could have added another one.  I did a homemade crust from a friend's recipe (shortening, flour, salt, ice water).   This pie recipe is solid.  Be sure to prep your apples and crust before making the butter/sugar/flour mixture.  Will definitely make again.

I followed tips on mixing the apples with half the caramel mix and then adding them to the pie plate. It definitely made it easier. I didn't lattice my crust, just sliced slits and poured mixture over the crust.  I prefer this pie without the addition of ANYTHING. It's incredible just the way it's directed.

I have made this recipe at least 20 timed bye far the best I have seen,  I tweaked a few things,  instead of using just granny smith apples, being in live in Ny, I mixed them with Empire apples and or Cortland to add significant flavor, after peeling the apples and slicing them I put the apples in water in a bowl  with  cinnamon to soak while I make the crust the apples hold their flavor better with the added cinnamon excellent, easy to make recipe

One of the best apple pies I have ever made.  I added some fresh cranberries in with the apples, poured the filling over the apples and then topped with a crumble topping rather than the lattice pastry.  Mmmmm.....

I have had many requests for this apple pie since the first time I baked it a few years ago. It is by far my favourite Apple pie! The only change I make is the apples. I use half honey crisp apples and half Macintosh.

Amazing!! I made this recipe exactly as listed and it was wonderful. I read the reviews after and realized what others had noticed... that the submitter (intentionally or not) omitted cinnamon. While I loved the pie, I will add cinnamon next time. Maybe a little vanilla extract as well.

Amazing!! I made this recipe exactly as listed and it was wonderful. I read the reviews after and realized what others had noticed... that the submitter (intentionally or not) omitted cinnamon. While I loved the pie, I will add cinnamon next time. Maybe a little vanilla extract as well.

This apple pie recipe is delicious! Everyone loved it! However, my only problem was the sauce was runny however it still tasted really good, slightly caramel. I am definitely going to be making this pie again! I only used 4 big bramley apples, which was plenty. I would 100% recommend this recipe!

I can personally attest to this recipe. I get lots of compliments for my baked goods so I know a thing or two but this is by far the BEST apple pie recipe hands down! I do add cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg for that traditional apple pie taste but making a sauce to pour over the apples and lattice is what does it! This is so fantastic. Try it. You won't go back to regular old apple pie every again! I would also like to add that I use my own crust recipe which is a pate brisee. Very simple ingredients and a super pie.

This may sound crazy but this pie recipe holds a special place in my heart. I decided to make apple pie from scratch for thanksgiving. I followed this recipe and it turned out amazing. My grandfather, who was a man of few words raved and raved about the pie and how amazed he was I made it (I always let my mom and grandma do the cooking!) He passed away a few months later and now every thanksgiving I remember that moment.

Made this yesterday and it's almost gone......and it's just the two of us!  Had to use my Mom's spices though, can't do a pie without her!  I did mix the apples like others had mentioned. It seems that Granny Smiths don't turn out well for me.  They are a 'hard' apple but always turn to applesauce in a pie. Guess they know this and are out to get me. (Yes, I interact with the fruit.??)  This is a keeper recipe. It will be going to pot luck get togethers. To all of the folks who this did not turn out for don't give up. Here in Florida the humidity is bad on cooking certain things. Make it at least another time. It's worth the effort.

This was just amazing as the reviews say it will be. I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the apples and think it's necessary. I also think doing the lattice crust is necessary because the crust then absorbs the sauce which is great. I had no issues with it bubbling over, but I did take a long time to pour the sauce in and let it sink into the apples. I also dusted the top of the freshly baked pie with cinnamon. Great!

Me, not a baker, had no problems. Easy. Had enough apples to make two pies. Used frozen pie crusts (thawed) for bottom and refrigerated pie crust for top lattice work.

Been using this for over three years now. My secret is using Trader Joe's pie crusts. They use butter and look/taste like home-made. 

Thank you so much for sharing your grandmother's recipe with the world :)

This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious every time, my go-to Apple pie recipes. The first time i made it I had a small bit of trouble with the lattice top crust(because I was using frozen pie crust)so I broke pieces off and placed them on top. The pie still looked amazing and tasted even better when done. This is always a party hit.

Please help!The pie tastes very good but somehow I can't get the melted butter to combine with the sugar. Hence my sugar mixtures are in lumps and the butter is liquid and separated. What am I doing wrong?

It was delicious ! I don't like apple pies but my husband wanted one... So I come upon this recipe. 
I only added a little bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the apples, and didn't add all of the white sugar it called for. 
As I read in a review before... The sauce might ooze out while its baking. So you might want to put it on top of a baking tray. 
It was soooo good ?? will do again... And again !

Love this recipe!  I know it is recommended to keep the recipe as is, but I love cinnamon so added that and some vanilla.  I reduced the water amount and added a bit more flour to the mixture.  Mixing with the apples and saving a little to pour on top works great.  Then I brushed egg whites on the crust edge and on the top and sprinkled with raw sugar.  Baked for an hour at 350 degrees.

I made this pie twice.  The first time, I attempted to make a paste from the flour and butter (as the directions state) before I added the sugars.  I got a crazy hard crust, but it tasted pretty good.  The second time, I ended up with like a caramel sauce, which is what I think I was supposed to get.  However, to get enough of it into the lattice, it spilled over onto the cooking sheet I was feeling pretty happy that I placed under the pie plate.  Enough got into the pie, to flavor it, though.  Finally, when I was ready to get my pie on, I cut into it and found a sloppy mess.  It tasted good, don't get me wrong - flavor was good and apples were tender.  But, I gave up trying to cut slices and just scooped it with a spoon.  I guess there are too many apple pie recipes out there that are not only delicious, but can also be pretty.  This isn't it.

Delicious!!! My kids said this was the best apple pie ever!! We used green tart apples from our apple tree, and added werthers chewy caramels to the pie before putting the apples in. It turned into a fun family project.  It's a pie to be proud of.

This was so delicious!!!!  I needed to make it low sugar so I used Truvia Blend and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend... I didn't have but half of the butter so I substituted the rest with coconut oil.  I also took others advice and sprinkled the apples with cinnamon.  I was doubtful before putting it in the oven but it turned out great!  My daughter doesn't like any sugar substitutes and she said it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Well, I must've done something wrong. I followed directions except added the teaspoon of cinnamon and poured 2/3 of the sauce over the apples and the rest on top. The taste was fantastic but not enough of the sauce came through the lattice work.  The top crust was too crispy.  It didn't look like the picture. Also, there was a lot of liquid in the pie, so maybe the water isn't necessary.  We ate it slightly warm, but it wouldn't think that it make it that runny. I did not get rave reviews from the family like I was expecting. I would like to make it again, but will put all sauce inside, and maybe omit the water.

The only thing I did different was to mix the cooked mixture with the apples before putting in pie pan, reserving a portion to dribble through the slits in a regular top crust. It worked great and my son-in-law said it was the BEST apple pie he had ever eaten. I, too, agree.

The last time I made an apple pie everything looked perfect, but it didn't taste good. Now I discovered after the first fifteen minutes at 425 my crust burned really badly. Maybe the recipe should also include a step that involves putting foil on the crust for a long time and then taking it off for browning purposes. On the other hand it tasted really good.

Best. Apple. Pie. EVER. Made the sauce as-written, but had to cut back on the amount of apples, as I apparently do not own a deep-dish pie plate. This will be remedied, because this pie deserves a deep dish! The sauce needed no tampering--no cinnamon or other spices necessary, really. The apples I used were Stayman Winesap, not G.S. but they are similar in that they are firm, somewhat tart apples that hold up nicely in a pie.

My picture is pre-filling. I made this pie for a work get together and my big boss came to me and said "that was the best tasting pie I have ever had in my entire life."
 I do, however-tweak it a just a little tiny bit. I use only 1/2 stick of butter and 2 table spoons of flour. I'm trying to go lighter on both still- but I'm still experimenting with the tweak-its so good-I do this because, TO ME, the whole stick of butter and all the flour makes it taste a tad heavy and a bit too much butter in the flavor-which kind of took from the desired fresh apple taste. Love this pie-Thanks Grandma Ople!

Printed out the recipe two days ago and see that it's been changed--yippee!  I was going to write that you should watch the video first because the recipe used to call for water before the sugars.  If you do that (which I did), you end up with glop.  Major glop.  Because everything else was prepared, I just went ahead and plopped the glop on top!  And trust me, it does look like a Dr. Seuss creation!  Can't wait to try it again.  PS I am so sick of sugar that I used the same butter, flour & water, but only 1/4 cup of each of the sugars.  Delish!

The Best apple pie recipe ever! The only thing I did was use apple cider instead of the water. I also added about a cup of chunky applesauce to my apples along with a tsp of cinnamon. The best!!

I skipped making my own crust and just bought 2 frozen pie crusts. The market didn't have deep dish so I had a huge excess of apples. I would only need about 4 instead of 8 next time. Or you could make 2 pies and double the filling part.  Also upon making, I'm not big on spending time with cutting lattice crust so that didn't work out. I just made a few triangle cuts in the top crust and poured the filling in the holes. It didn't look great but it tasted great. The filling was excellent.

I skipped making my own crust and just bought 2 frozen pie crusts. The market didn't have deep dish so I had a huge excess of apples. I would only need about 4 instead of 8 next time. Or you could make 2 pies and double the filling part.  Also upon making, I'm not big on spending time with cutting lattice crust so that didn't work out. I just made a few triangle cuts in the top crust and poured the filling in the holes. It didn't look great but it tasted great. The filling was excellent.

I decided to make this recipe today and it was wonderful. Are used Granny Smith and Gala apples. I added a little bit of vanilla- half a tablespoon and I brushed the top crust with whole milk before baking.

I made this pie for my son's birthday, and he said it was the best apple pie he has ever tasted.  This is a keeper!

I have made this pie a couple times as well. First, I stink at baking and making a crust look pretty. This pie was so easy and the best apple pie I have had in a long time. My Husband and teenage boys are a blueberry pie only kind of crowed. They LOVE this pie! Just make it!

I liked it, but it was too sweet for my taste. I might conceivably try it again, but with about three quarters the sugar.

This is hands down the best apple pie I've ever made and maybe ever eaten!  My hubby isn't a big apple pie eater and he LOVED this one!   I've used it for several years now, and it's the only apple pie recipe I use now.

I tried this pie for a family dinner and everyone liked it but I did not find it sweet enough.  It tasted kind of bland to me like I was missing something or maybe need to increase the brown sugar.  It was good though and would recommend it but needs adjustments according to your liking.

I've made this 6 times for picky crowds, and each time there were no leftovers. When making the filling, I followed other's recommendations and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and replaced 1 tsp water with 1 tsp vanilla which added more flavor. I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust (also found on allrecipes.com)and doubled it to make a bottom and top crust. 

I've found that mixing the filling with the apples before pouring into the pie crust was preferred over pouring it over the top crust (as instructed) because it gets distributed more evenly, especially if you cook the filling too long and the butter separates from the sugar. Otherwise, it will just clump on the top crust. 

Overall, THE best and only apple pie recipe you should use from the Internet.

I’ve made this several times over the years, and it remains my husband’s favorite pie (over store bought!).  It couldn’t be easier, especially with a store bought crust.  I sometimes use a food processor to slice the apples.  I used reviewer recommendations to save a little syrup to brush on the top crust, and to add vanilla extract to the apples.  You definitely need the foil on top.  Thanks Grandma O, this hasn’t failed me yet!

So I had a hard time determining how to rate this recipe bc it was delicious, however I had some issues with the construction. I attempted this recipe as written and although it was very tasty, when I make it again I will construct it differently.  After following the video instructions and making the filling first I ended up with solidified Carmel sauce that could not be poured into the lattice pie crust without clumping on the top of the pie and not seeping into the pie. To remedy this I made an additional batch of the filling and before it had the chance to simmer I poured it into the pie in almost liquid form. The result was delicious but not pretty presentation wise. The next time I make this I will pour the filling over top the apples before making the lattice top crust and then glaze the top part with extra mixture as other reviewers have suggested. All in all this recipe is delicious and I can't wait to perfect my own version in the future! Thanks!
Update: I made the pie again, doubled the filling, and put the filling over the apples and then did the lattice crust and it turned out beautifully. Both delicious and perfect presentation-wise!! Will make this again and again thanks!

Made two of these for Thanksgiving. Wonderful! I will never use another apple pie recipe again. I was a little worried when I made them because they were so runny. This is definitely a prepare the day ahead pie. Would add a bit of cinnamon next time but that's all. So good with the all butter crust recipe from this site.

This was amazing! But I was only able to put in about 5 medium apples and it was piled HIGH! Easy and amazing. Kids were in awe that it was so easy to make for Thanksgiving :)

This was the first time I was making apple pie ever.  This recipe is my first apple pie recipe ever, and this is my last recipe, ever.  There is no need to look for another apple pie recipe, I dont think there could be better out there.  This pie was better thank any bakery pie I ever had.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  It was an outstanding pie.  I used all granny smith apples, next time I will use a couple of sweeter apples as well, I used 6 nice sized apples instead of the 8.  I dint use any of the nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon and cloves that is suggested in its many great reviews, but I will next time just because it will be for Thanksgiving and the kids will appreciate a sweeter pie.  I liked the tartness of all granny smith apples, especially with a white wine.  I poured 3/4 of the liquid into the apples and stirred.  The other 1/4 I brushed the lattice top with a pastry brush. When I baked it,  I made sure my oven rack was at the lowest position so that the bottom crust would bake.  I baked it adhering to the recipe temp and time.  It was beautiful when it cam out of the oven.  I couldnt believe I made that pie.  The brushed liquid really made the pie look gorgeous.  I cant wait to make it for my family for thanksgiving.

It was okay. I love the smell of apple pies baking. It was too sweet for my taste. The vanilla ice cream cut the sweetness. :) My biggest problem was how runny it was. I wanted it to stick together better. I didn't do a lattice top. Maybe that was the problem.

Delicious! Everyone enjoyed it & it was pretty easy too. I baked it at 350 the entire time, and I added a bit of cinnamon & vanilla extract to the mixture. I will definitely be making this apple pie for the holidays!

This is my family's new favourite recipe for apple pie.  I can make NO other now !  lol  I reduce the caramel sauce by half and it is plenty sweet enough... I've also used different varieties of apples with great success.  My next attempt will be with Barlett pears :)  Thanks for sharing this recipe !!

Such a simple, yet great recipe. I've made this with Fuji apples and my mother's vinegar pie crust recipe several times. Throw some cranberries & shelled walnuts in for a crunchy Fall treat.

This has been my go to apple pie recipe for several years now.  I do add cinnamon to the sauce and some vanilla after the sauce has come off the heat.  I also usually make a two crust pie and pour all the sauce over the apples before I put on the top crust.

Made this for my husband for fathers day.  Delicious!  The only change I made is to add a little cinnamon to the mixture.  Remember to do the sugar mixture last so it is hot when you pour it over the crust.

Yet another 5 star review.  Added 1 t cinnamon & 2 t vanilla paste to the caramel.  I used the Cook's Illustrated foolproof pie crust recipe. Brushed the lattice crust with the caramel & that was fantastic - it hardened into a crisp toffee-like coating.  Next time - and there will be a next time - I think I will brush the inner crust w egg white & blind bake very briefly.  Additionally I don't know if my granny smith's where unusually large but there was no way I could have gotten 8 apples worth of slices into the pie pan.  I used 5 at the most and now I have a lot of leftover slices.  

Additional tweaks I think would be worth trying - stirring in some grated cheddar cheese to the apples, subbing some red wine or bourbon for the water in the caramel, adding some very finely chopped crystalized ginger to the caramel.  There's lots of add-in's that I think would work wonderfully with this pie but as a base to work from I don't think it could be beat.

Lattice crust seems like more work than it is worth but maybe a full top crust would keep in too much moisture.

Yet another 5 star review.  Added 1 t cinnamon & 2 t vanilla paste to the caramel.  I used the Cook's Illustrated foolproof pie crust recipe. Brushed the lattice crust with the caramel & that was fantastic - it hardened into a crisp toffee-like coating.  Next time - and there will be a next time - I think I will brush the inner crust w egg white & blind bake very briefly.  Additionally I don't know if my granny smith's where unusually large but there was no way I could have gotten 8 apples worth of slices into the pie pan.  I used 5 at the most and now I have a lot of leftover slices.  

Additional tweaks I think would be worth trying - stirring in some grated cheddar cheese to the apples, subbing some red wine or bourbon for the water in the caramel, adding some very finely chopped crystalized ginger to the caramel.  There's lots of add-in's that I think would work wonderfully with this pie but as a base to work from I don't think it could be beat.

Lattice crust seems like more work than it is worth but maybe a full top crust would keep in too much moisture.

i have made this multiple times just without the lattice crust, and it is beyond fabulous! i do think that the recipe calls for too tart of apples and too many. i usually only use 4 gala, but of course that is just my preference. i will never use any other recipe again!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was incredible -- by far the best apple pie I've had! This pie looks and tastes like it's difficult to make, but its not (I didn't share that with my family though!).. This is now my #1 go-to pie recipe. The only change I made was adding cinnamon to the apples, which I felt added needed flavor. I also made a pie crust with a bit of crunchy sugar in it, and rolled the dough out a bit thicker than normal.

Easy to follow. 
Tastes great. 
I am now comfortable with doing a lattice top. 
Love the idea of caramelizing the sugar first. 
And, lastly, people think I really can bake -- mission accomplished, I guess! :) 

I went ahead and added a little flour (couple table spoons) and cinnamon (teaspoon) to the apples (only 5 large granny smith apples). One of three times I also added some vanilla (don't remember how much, maybe 1/2 tsp) to the apple mixture... I don't even know if that's something anyone would do...! Oh, and I basted the bottom crust with egg. The only thing I'll say is the variations worked out great. But don't follow my adjustments before reading others', I am seriously amateur. Read other people's adjustments if you are looking for a variation to the recipe as-written.

O my this pie is AMAZING! I have never made a pie from scratch before and it turned out absolutely perfect! I did make a few changes along the way but nothing major. Still followed the recipe exactly. As I was making it and cutting up the apples i noticed at 4 apples it was almost overflowing so I stoppped there. (no biggie) then i love the criss cross top on a pie but I also LOVE a crumbled topping. So what I did after following this recipe exactly, was take 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of all-purpose flour, and 1/4 cup butter, diced very small and I put it in a bowl. I took my hand mixer and mixed it together. I then sprinkled this over the pie and just like that I went to heaven eating it after. It was so good and gone so fast, my fam asked me to make it again. THAT SAME WEEK! HIT!

I made this apple pie for Thanksgiving. It was a total hit.. My husband who doesn't like apple pie was amazed by this pie.( who requested me to make it again)  I followed the recipe as is adding nothing else. It has really great flavor and overall taste is just to die for.  I will now use this as my apple pie recipe from now on.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year because I have lots of boys who love apple pie, but I've always had trouble with the recipe I used in the past. I thought I would just try something different and see. Not only did it look beautiful, but they all loved it and some said it was the best apple pie they had ever had. I did have a little trouble with the crust being wet on the bottom, but I seem to always have that problem with fruit pies.

The syrup was super tasty but the crust on the bottom was uncooked when i served it.  Also the apples were very firm.   I like mine on the soft side.  Not sure what happened.  Will try again though.

This was the first pie I ever mad and it turned out pretty fantastic. I got rave reviews and it was a real treat to make. My only criticism is that it was very soupy and you almost needed a spoon to eat it. Maybe it was just my inexperience and maybe I did not need to put the entire sugar mixture into the pie. However there is always next time.

Is my sauce supposed to have the butter and sugar mixture kind of separated? Like oil and vinegar almost. I'm trying the recipe right now and i'm kind of unsure...

We LOVE this pie recipe!  Autumn is the season for harvesting Apple and Green Chilies, here in New Mexico so we adapted this pie to the season by sprinkling about 1/2 cup Freshly Grated cheddar cheese on top of the pie crust before adding the apples and we added a chopped green chili (mild to medium per your taste) to the apples before putting them in the the pie.  The result is a Wonderfully delicious apple pie with just a little heat.  This is a Southwestern Favorite!

Perfect!!! We followed the advice and put cinnamon and vanilla with the apples before putting them on the crust. It turned out perfect. Topped with our favorite vanilla ice cream, perfect dessert!

This apple pie recipe was great and everyone loved it. I made it for thanksgiving this year a day ahead and it still kept well until the next day. The crust I used was not as buttery and crumbly as I would have liked, but the pie and filling was great and tasted so fresh like homemade pie should! I think I used gala apples also instead of granny smith, but Im sure either would be good. I would definitely make this again but with a different crust. I also didn't do a lattice top, but poured the syrup mixture over the apples, topped it with crust (and leaf cutouts which were  a nice touch) then the rest of the sugar mix. very yummy!

I was in charge of making desert this year at my in-laws house for thanksgiving and this pie was a major hit!! Everyone loved it. I was a little nervous because i had never made apple pie this way. But it was perfect. The only thing I did different was I didn't want to make the lattice crust so I just poured the liquid in the apples and then saved a small amount to pour on top. Yummy!! Five stars!

Trust the cook times but add cinnamon, allspice or apple pie spice. Only need 7 extra large green apples but this pie was the rave of the party!

I followed this recipe exactly - except 6 apples were more than enough, but my apples got mushy. I wanted a little firmness. Did anyone else get this result? Please offer suggestions. I would like to try this again. It was delicious. Thanks.

OMGoodness but this was sinfully delicious! I pride myself in baking a truly outstanding pie, but let me tell you, this pie --- takes the award! And now my hubby asks for this all the time!! LOL The only exceptions I made were lightly sprinkling cinnamon on my apples then mixing the sauce in with the apples leaving just enough to drizzle over my lattice. I did cover the crust edge with foil until last 20 min. And I used Golden Delicious Apples, always my choice when it comes to pie baking! Try this, you won't regret it!

Seriously, the best apple pie EVER. In hindsight, I probably should've done a practice pie to make sure all came out okay before Turkey Day. However, I didn't (do I need to have a pie for myself?) and as it turns out, I didn't have to worry, because it came out amazing. I did add some cinnamon to the caramel-like mixture just to make it a bit more seasonal, but pouring it over the crust made the apples AND the crust taste so good. I will be using this recipe from now on!

This was ok. I followed exactly except for homemade crust. Too many apples which made pie heavy. Comments were that with so many apples "packed" in, you couldn't enjoy flavor...hmmm. Not sure if I'd use again.

If I could I would give this 10 stars. I am not a pie maker and this Thanksgiving I was a hit with this pie.  Even after being stuffed with turkey, people asked for seconds ay dessert time.   Instead of the lattice I used a crumb topping as that is a favorite with my family.  1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tbsp. butter mixed together to form the crumbs.  Yummy.......

Like others, I had never attempted to make an apple pie before this.  Now it will be my signature dessert!  The grannysmith apples (tossed with a pinch of cinnamon) were perfect- crisp and not too sweet. The best though, was the drizzled lattice crust!  Definitely use all eight apples, even though they look like they won't fit.  The pie does settle while cooking, and when it's done, it's just the right size and packed with apples, as it should be.

This was my first apple pie and I made it for Thanksgiving.  It was wonderful!!!  Everyone loved it. I used a crust recipe that I've used many times but the only changed I made to the recipe was to add 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the sugar sauce and I used Johna Gold apples instead of Granny Smith because I realllllllly don't like Granny Smith.  They are way too tart for me.  The  Johna Gold are slightly tart but also sweet and they worked well in the pie.  This is a keeper and one that will be requested many times I'm sure.  Thanks so much!!

This pie was very tasty and everyone liked it.  I stuck to the recipe as far as ingredients go.  One major thing that wasn't in the directions was to cover the pie with foil after the first 10-15 minutes.  The first one I baked was all burned on top.  I learned from that and the others came out beautifully.  Also, the ceramic pie plates that I used can't be above 375 degrees, so I baked mine at 350 the whole time- a bit more than an hour.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.  My one sister said she'd toss the apples with some cinnamon and sugar next time, but I liked the flavor just the way it is.

Made this today to fulfill a promise to my 8 y/o son.  Although I don't like apple pie too much, this pie is amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly except added pumpkin pie spice to the apples after slicing and used apple cider instead of water.  Also made my own crust and this pie is gourmet good.  Yummy!

I made this recipe using 1/2 granny smith and 1/2 golden delicious and maybe that's why it turned out so bland, even though I did add cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground clove.  Also I used puff pastry for the lattice top.  I was very disappointed with the flavor.  I'll try it a 2nd time with granny smith and a regular pie crust.  Hopefully that'll give it the familiar apple pie flavor I was looking for.  Can't possibly give it a bad rating since I doctored the recipe and probably screwed it up in the process : )

By far the best pie I have ever made.  To be frank I am not a pie maker and this one made me proud.  All who ate it thought it was great.  Pouring the liquid over the crust is what caught my eye and I just had to try it. Not to sweet just right.

This was fantastic. I make tons of pies, and wanted to try something different. I added some cinnamon directly to the apples before the lattice and it was great. Only problem was the mess in the oven...I will take the advice of others and pour slower next time! Thanks for sharing!

My husband loved this pie and even went as far as saying it was the best he ever ate!  I also made this recipe in 3, 6inch tart tins and gave them as gift for the first day of school for teachers and bus driver!  (see pictures)  Very easy to make and tastes super yummy!

This pie was so good! I have never baked a pie before and so far I have baked this one twice in a week! The first time Made it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out wonderfully, the second time I took kraft caramel squares and cut them into quarters and sprinkled them on top of the apples before I made the lattice on top and it was the most delicious apple pie I have ever tasted! Thanks so much for sharing!

I make this every holiday and it always turns out great! I use store bought crust and use a pizza cutter to make the lattice top. Smells SO good and the color is just beautiful. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I have never made a pie that wastn right out of the freezer section, this was my first try. I made it for a small dinner for the 4th and everyone really, really liked it. The only thing was the recipe didnt call for cinnamon, i added some, but apparently not enough because that was the first thing hubby noticed. Other than that, thank you for a great simple recipe!!

Used this recipe in my first attempt at an apple pie and brought it to Thanksgiving at my mother in-laws.  I must admit my mother in-law's pie is a little better, but this pie was good and I was pleased with it.

My new favorite pie! I did add a little cinnamon to the apples but it would be delicous without it. I will make this over and over again.

Rave reviews flowed at our annual Memorial Day picnic.  I use the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site, and that was perfect with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!!!  Everyone loved this...I had so many compliments....the only difference I made (due to lack of time to go to the store) was salted butter  and orchard apples (not sure what type...red/yellow)  turned out soooooooo good.  Will definitely make again.

I liked the pie but didn't think it was the best I could do. It's a little bland in my opinion.

I LOVE this recipe! I think its fun to make too! Even though 8 apples was A LOT of apple, I decided to make it a very mile-high type of pie, and I doubled the sauce recipe. I also, coated my apples in cinnamon, and used the french pastry pie crust for this recipe. Everyone loves it and asks for again around every holiday : )

FABULOUS!  Just the perfect mix of tart/sweet.  I took it to a dinner and the hostess said it was the best apple pie she had ever tasted.  And it was so easy to make!  Turned out looking beautiful, too.  I just used a boxed, rolled crust.  (I followed the directions completely.)

YUM! This was my first time making apple pie. I followed the recipe exactly, other than sprinkling the apples with cinnamon. I was really happy with how it turned out!

I'm very picky about my apple pie and this one was amazing. My boyfriend said it's by far the best he's ever tasted and he's a baked goods junkie. However, I did alter it just slightly. I mixed in with the apples about a 1/4 C. brown sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon and a tsp. nutmeg. To be honest, I was afraid of having the apples bare in  case the syrup didn't coat them enough. And to the syrup I added about 1 tsp vanilla just for some extra flavor. It was delicious.

This recipe is perfect.  Apple pie doesn't get any better.  Follow the recipe and don't change anything.  Why mess with perfection? The only alteration I would suggest is that you may not need 8 apples.

I made this for my family and passed the recipe along to a friend.  Both of us got rave reviews from our families.  The crust was a beautiful light brown and was so good.  I had never made an apple pie where you pour a sugar syrup over the top, so I was hopeful but not sure.  From now on, this is the apple pie that I will make for every day and for holidays. Thank you!

This is a 10+ star recipe, no doubt about it. I've made it probably 20 times and always get rave reviews. Numerous people have told me it's the best apple pie they've ever had. The only changes I make are to add a little cinnamon to the apples and I usually use 3-4 Granny Smiths, 2 Galas, and 1 Figi (depending on the size of the apples). Sometimes I throw a Pink Lady or something else in there too. Amazing, amazing. Thank you so much. :)

It was amazing! I used a mixture of different apples so I would have different textures in the pie. It very much reminded me of apple dumplings without all the trouble of trying to wrap apples. I took it to a Scout Roundtable meeting along with 3 other pies I made and it was a big hit.

I have made this pie several times already. I personally don't like any type of fruit pie but my family loves this. I made it one year for someones birthday and now I end up making several times a year for family. After reading reviews though I want to add something. MAKE IT AS IS! If you want to add cinnamon I suggest just a little mixed with the apples or sprinkled on top after you add the lattice crust and the sauce. Also the lattice crust is way easy to do. I just buy the pie crust you roll out and cut strips out of it with a pizza cutter. Sure it's the cheater way but it works just as good as anything else.

Made this along with my Mom's traditional Apple Pie recipe for Thanksgiving.  Well... it was a huge hit! There is nothing like your Mom's Apple Pie... but this was just as good (if not better) with just a slight twist on tradition.  If you are looking for a **** apple pie recipe, you have to try it.  It's no fail!  I did pour the liquid mixture on top of my apples and tossed in a bowl - then added them to the crust.  Slapped on the lattice top and used a pastry brush to coat the lattice... oh and I also sprinkle a bit of sugar on the top for that glistening effect.  Everyone really loved it!

It was my first time making apple pie and this pie turned out AMAZING!!! My recommendation is to pour the sauce to the apples instead of over the crust, which could make it soggy. Use the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" recipe!! I guarantee this won't last for long!

OK, I have made more apple pies than I can count in my life and I thought I had the ultimate recipe, but this one is better!   I did toss the apples with about 2TB flour mixed with about 2 tsp. cinnamon, then filled my pie pan and poured the sugar mixture over the apples before I put on the top crust.  That sugar mixture looked sort of like greasy pudding at that point and I was doubtful that this was going to work, but it all just blended beautifully with the apples during baking.  I doubled the recipe to make a 10 inch pie and really heaped it full.  I had maybe 1 cup of apples and a little sugar mix left over, but it made a very nice full, large pie.  This goes to the top of my list!

Excellent and the most "pretty" pie I've ever made.  To the 8 apples I added 1.5 tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.   Followed the rest of the directions exactly.   Great recipe; a definite keeper!

I consider myself an expert pie maker and this recipe is a KEEPER! The only thing I did differently was to pour the sauce over the apples and mix it up before putting into the crust. Then I put the top crust on and cut some slits in. I love my pie crust [made w/lard] and don't do lattice much so pouring over the crust would not have worked. Excellent flavor! Thank you Moshasmama! God Bless your granny!

I'm a beginner cook and have made this recipe 3 times now for different occasions and everyone LOVES this pie, young and old. I definitely added the tablespoon of vanilla, large pinch of nutmeg, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon for flavor. I would also recommend mixing the syrup with the apples instead of pouring it over the lattice top. Otherwise it's a fabulous recipe to make, even if you're 21 years old :)

right now its a 3...i am hoping it is going to taste good.  the ingredients are all yummy so my fingers are crossed.  however, i got such a gelotenous mess i redid the sauce and couldn't get it off the stove fast enough for it not to begin to gel just like the first try.  i thought, well, maybe its suppose to melt down in when it bakes.  it's still in the oven  and i don't think it's going to melt down in.  when i added the flour i didn't get a paste but i continued and as soon as it came to a boil...so, it should be interesting.  i'll let you know how it turns out.  The pictures look so lovely that i have hope my next attempt will turn out just like them.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! The only change I make, recommended by other reviewers, is adding a tbsp of cinnamon to the apples. Beautiful presentation and great taste every time!

This recipe was amazing!!!! I just made it today and served it still warm.  I cannot put into words how delicious this pie is!  I used crispin apple(we didn't have any granny smiths), added a tsp of cinnamon,  and dash of nutmeg to it but other then that I followed the recipe exactly.  The latice topping added a great look to the pie, I also made leaf cut outs and put them on top of the latice to give it some decoration, it looked great.  I will be putting this recipe on a card and adding it to my collection.  Plus it was a relatively simple recipe which made it even better.  I 100% satisfied with this recipe.

OHMYGOSH!  Just made this - chose to make it mostly according to directions as suggested below.  It is fantastic!!!!!  I did mix the cinnamon (and some pumpkin pie spice) in with the apples (that I sprinkled some lemon juice on to keep fresh looking).  Otherwise, followed the recipe and it's really, really good!!!

This is the most AMAZING pie! I made it for a fourth of July picnic and got rave reviews! Everyone told me I had to make this pie for every gathering. The only thing I had to do differently is I added cinnamon and I did double the sauce recipe to make it extra gooey. Delicious!!

Awesome recipe!!!  Doesn't get much better than this!  While I love the rich syrupy version created by Grandma Ople, I like my less sweet, less rich variation as well.  I fill a plastic bag with the sugars, flour and about 1 teaspoon cinnamon and the sliced apples and shake to mix well.  The sugared apples go into the crust and I evenly dot the mixture with about 1/4 c. butter, cut into pieces. I omit the water; the cooked apple juice creates a sauce of perfect amount and consistency.  I top this with a whole crust.  This apple pie is not as candy-like, but the flavor of the apples is really enhanced!

This pie is just okay, nothing special.  I've made lots of apple pies, and this one is pretty bland.  My daughter added pumpkin pie spice to hers after it came out of the oven, and hubby added cinnamon sugar.  In any case, thanks for sharing.  Glad others enjoyed it.

Ok, can I tell you I've never made an apple pie completely from scratch before?  I think the fact that my husband loves his Mom's apple pie has always deterred me.  However, he loooooved this and said it was even better than "Mom's".  I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site.  I used gala apples and added some cinnamon and apple pie spice which I just couldn't go without!  I also got ahead of myself and poured the topping on the apples before I put the top crust on.  Oops.  It was amazingly delicious though!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I will definitely have this as my standard apple pie recipe now!

I have to confess that I really didn't care for this recipe at all. I followed the recipe with the exception that I added cinnamon to the apples. After the hour of cooking time, the apples were still too firm but any further baking would have burned the crust. I didn't like the sugar syrup blend that you pour over the pie, it just detracted from the flavor of the apples, I definitely wouldn't make this again.

This recipe is fairly simple and comes out terrific every time. After going apple picking, I use a few different kinds of apples and it is a huge favorite.

Outstanding! I agreed with one reviewer and added cinnamon (and a touch of nutmeg) to the tossed apples. The best apple pie I've ever made.

Outstanding! I agreed with one reviewer and added cinnamon (and a touch of nutmeg) to the tossed apples. The best apple pie I've ever made.

Yummy! Added a bit of cinnamon to the syrup mixture. Will definitely make this again soon. Made the pie with or without cinnamon for about a 6 times now, and each and every time, people are amazed by it.

Even though this pie may be the best ever, I cut my hands working on the apples and it was difficult.  Next time I will try to only partially peel the apples and may try to use the Cuisinart to slice the apples, or at least ask my husband to do it -  it was much easier to ask my husband to make the All American Apple Pie, but this one tasted better.

Good but too much butter.  I made 2 of these pies for Easter and everything worked great, the pies looked beautiful and were tasty but the general concensus from the group was they had too much butter and were a little rich.  I would make this recipe again and only use half the amount of butter required.  I really think it would make it taste better plus cutting calories and fat means you get to have a 2nd piece. :^)

I've made this pie 5 times now, and am always so happy with it... My boyfriend is an apple pie lover, so I made this for him last year. We ended up eating the entire thing in one day. He still often raves about how I make the best apple pie ever. :) Thanks to Grandma Ople's recipe, it's true! It is THE best apple pie I've tried on allrecipes, by far. I always add a little cinnamon and vanilla to the apples before putting them in the crust. I also like to mix half the sugar mixture with the apples before putting them in the crust, then will pour the remaining sugar mixture over - I like to make sure everything is fully coated. I'm going to be using this recipe forever - thank you so much!

very easy to make. This was my first pie I ever made and I made two which everyone loved! Hint:Try and mix a sweeter apple with granny smith apples.  The granny smith create a very tangy sour taste so if you'd like a sweeter pie mix in a sweet apple like gala or mcintosh :) yummy yummy yummy thank you Grandma Ople! haha

Excellent recipe. The only change I made was to add 2 tsp cinnamon to the apples.   Will definitely make this one again. Very easy recipe. Had a lot of compliments and recipe requests.

I don't care for making pies in general and apple pie is my least favorite,but I felt obligated to make one for thanksgiving so I tried this recipe. This is the best apple pie I have made or tasted. I don't like to review recipes to which I have made major changes having said that the only thing I couldn't resist was tossing the apples with some cinnamon before placing in the crust. I also hate making pie crust and used pillsbury ready made. It not only tasted wonderful but looked beautiful, and got thumbs up from everyone. This is the only recipe I will use for apple pie from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe

I don't like to review recipes to which I have made major changes having said that the only thing I couldn't resist was tossing the apples with some cinnamon before placing in the crust. I also hate making pie crust and used pillsbury ready made. It not only tasted wonderful but looked beautiful, and got thumbs up from everyone. This is the only recipe I will use for apple pie from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe

I've made this recipe twice now and it turned out great both times. Like some other reviewers, I tossed the apples with some cinnamon for the extra flavor. This pie looks bakery-made and tastes fantastic.

I have made this probably 8 times. Excellent!!! Makes a beautiful pie that tastes amazing. I coated apples w/ about 3/4 of the syrup mixture and used the other 1/4 on the top. Need to put a cookie sheet under the pie plate b/c some of the sugary syrup does come out of the pie. Wonderful flavor and texture. Make sure to cook about 10 minutes longer or the apples may not be soft enough depending on your preference.

Made this pie twice, glad I did because in between making them I saw (on reviews) what was missing- cinnamon and vanilla. I added a teaspoon of each and it was much better!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added some extra spices. My family likes ginger, clove, nutmeg, and lots of cinnamon. This pie really tastes like grandmas!!! We love it thanks.

When made with home-grown apples, this pie is even better! But store-bought apples still keep this pie on top of all others. 
Also, I use the "best ever pie crust" recipie one this site. I like to weave strips of crust over the top of the pie to give it a more classical look.
Thank you, Grandma Ople! This will be a long-time favorite and passed down to my children...when I have them. =]

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone said they enjoyed it.  I added the cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to the apples and it turned out great.  It also looked really great with the lattice top.  I made it with the Pillsbury pie crust you buy at the store and they also worked great.  I will definitely make this again.

The best apple pie recipe here, hands down. The sweetness of the sugars and apples seep into the crust, which makes it awesome. I tossed the apples in half of the sugar-butter mixture and poured the rest over the top crust. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for more apple pie flavors. I recommend placing a pan under the pie just in case the filling overflows. Also, wrap the edges around the rim in foil, since the outer crust rim has tendency to overcook before the rest of pie is done. This apple pie is definitely worth the time and effort.

I made this pie just a few days ago for Thanksgiving. The flavor was wonderful but I did have a problem that I'm hoping I can get some input for.  When I made the syrup, it was really more of a paste.  I had to mix it with the apples, as there was no way it was pourable to go over the top of the lattice crust.  I checked and recheck the ingredient amounts and all was fine.  It became a paste almost immediately after adding the sugars. I simmered it for a while, hoping that the sugar would liquify and it would look more like a thick syrup but that did not happen.
I would love to make this again at Christmas but I might need a practic pie beforehand!  Anyone else have the syrup become a paste?

I would love to make this again at Christmas but I might need a practic pie beforehand!  Anyone else have the syrup become a paste?

Awesome! I didn't change a single thing about this recipe and everyone at Thanksgiving said it was delicious. I would definitely reccommend putting a cookie sheet under the pie to catch the oozing sauce or else you will have a messy oven. I was skeptical about putting the sauce on the top of the pie, but it soaked through the holes in the lattice crust, and made the top crust crunchy, perfectly browned and delicious. The lattice crust does take some time to perfect, however!

I used the french pastry pie recipe for this pie - I added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the sauce and had no problems with the color at all. The sauce, combined with the french pastry pie, is what makes this pie so good. Next time I make this, I will do what others did by combining half the sauce with the apples and pour the other half over the lattice top.

This was the fist apple pie I have ever made and it couldnt have been better! I did use a few recommendations from other reviewers... I mixed the apples with some of the brown sugar mixture and then put it in the pie crust, then I put the top crust on and brushed the rest of the brown sugar, It was fabulous!!!

The taste of this pie is delicious, however, the set up was a disaster!  The caramel sauce was everywhere!  And once in the oven and reheated, it travelled again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but my apples were still a little on the crisp side.  Don't get me wrong, I will try this again because the flavors are fantastic!  Next time, when I prepare the caramel, I will toss apples in the sauce and then mound in the pie shell.  Also, I need help on the lattice work, but that takes practice.  This was my first apple pie... Thank goodness we don't care about looks around here:)  It is still getting eaten!

I have only written a few reviews, but I make this so often and have recommended this recipe so many times, I felt obligated.  This is THE best apple pie you'll ever make.  It's so easy--I make it all the time in the fall, as I did just now :)  Thanks!

I made this pie with Northern Spy apples, my favorite for making desserts.  This was a very good pie.  It was very different putting the sauce over the crust, but it worked.

This was a good recipe, but not a great one.  The recipe I use from a Jewish cookbook was better.  This recipe needs seasoning to make it outstanding.  I suggest cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg.

This recipe is awesome! Oh My Gosh, I took the first bite and thought I was in heaven. I did add the nutmeg and a dash of cinnnamon as well. Just be careful how thin you cut the apples because they dissolved.

OH MY GOODNESS. This recipe is Wonderful. I may never use a different one again for a apple pie! I did follow the others suggestions and sprinkled cinnimon and nutmeg on the apples and put most of the sauce mixture in the pie and then glazed the top pie crust being that I did not use a lattice top. DELICIOUS!

Wonderful!!! My whole family loved this pie.  My mom reminded me daily to send her the recipe.  Quick tip...I don't pour the syrip over the top crust.  I poured it directly over the apples, then put the crust on, the basted the crust with melted butter.  Mmmmm, it was wonderful!

Wow!  This pie is great!  I've made many different recipes over the years and this one will replace all the others.  I added a little bit of cinnamon to the syrup because of personal preference, but besides that, left the recipe as-is.  I like the glaze that it put on the lattice top.  Served warm with a bit of home-made vanilla ice-cream on top....doesn't get any better than that!!!  Thanks for sharing this heirloom recipe.

I am completely inept when it comes to pie baking. I am the butt of family jokes. In the 14 years I've married, this pie was the very first pie I've made that has ever turned out! My husband even asked for seconds! I added 1 t of vanilla and 1/4 t of cinnamon to the syrup. I also used a crumb topping. I baked at the high temp for 10 minutes and the lower temp for 30. My apples were very tender. The apples were sliced using the pampered chef peeler/corer/slicer so they were thin and very uniform in size.

OMG this was amazing! I added a little cinamon to the apples. I would also cut the sugar in the sauce in half too. My family loved this pie! I would make it again! Thanks! ---UPDATE--- I made this pie again and with my changes, this pie gets 5 stars! amazing!

I have to give this recipe a 5 star although it was not one of my favorites but I don't care for cooked apples and have never been a fan of apple pie. I made this for my husband and he loved it! I only used 4 apples instead of 8 and two of them were golden delicious. I think next time I will try all red delicious because the Granny Smith apples were way too sour for this recipe (especially for me). But it had great flavor and held together really well!

Oh. My. God.  YUM.  
I made this a while ago, and it was SO good.  Apple pie is my favorite pie, and this is my favorite apple pie.  I am going to bring this to christmas at my parent's house - I will be the star of the party, I'm sure!

I can't say this was the best, because it was my first. Much better making my own than the store bought I must say. I didn't have any nutmeg so I substituted a pinch of ground cloves and a pinch of allspice. I added these spices to the apples along with the cinnamon like another reviewer stated. Served it with ice cream and had absolutely no complaints. Will be making for our Winter Lunceon. Thanks!

If you have not tried this pie, you should.  It is outstanding and not hard to make. My husband told me it is the best apple pie he has ever had.  My children request on their birthday instead of cake.  Thanks for making me look like a good cook, Gma Ople!

I have only made apple pie one other time and it was a disaster! This pie was absolutely wonderful, I received so many compliments (and who doesn't love that!?)  I also added the apples directly to the sauce as well as cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. A frozen pie crust was used for the top and bottom crust and it still looked beautiful! Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't like this pie. It is not as good as a basic apple pie. I would try a different recipe that uses cinnamon and sugar.

I think this pie was beautiful but a little bland for an apple pie and I added spices to what it said and still thought it was bland. I added cinnamon and nutmeg and all spice and I would add more next time with some dark corn syrup too. Really is a gorgeous pie though I took pictures because it is the prettiest dessert I had ever made!

First good pie I ever made (been on a quest to make a good pie for years, always elluded me). The only thing I would change is to add cinnamon and maybe some vanilla. Otherwise, it's perfect.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving 2007.I made my own crust and used the spices as mentioned in other reviews. I covered the top crust brushing  with beaten egg, and sprinked raw sugar on the top. This pie is as delicious as all the reviews state! Everyone loved it!

This apple pie recipe is GREAT! I followed some advice and cut back on the apples, but wished I hadn't- I could have used a few more. I mixed 3/4 of the sauce with the apples and 1 tsp of cinnamon then poured the rest over the lattice top. It looked great and tasted even better.

The flavor and texture were fantastic. I gave the recipe a 4 because it requires modification- I added cinnamon to the apples as other reviewers recommended. I should have also added some of the sauce to the apples and the rest to the top. The recipe as written doesn't work. That much sauce will not fit on top of the pie and is too viscous to enter the pie unless you have a very open lattice top. I didn't. It made a mess but was delicious.

This pie was okay, but nothing to write home about.  With all the 5-star reviews, I was expecting a really WOW pie.

I followed the recipe exactly - used my homemade pie crust and Granny Smith apples.  I poured the sugar syrup over the lattice as directed, but when baked, the top crust wasn't anything special.

It was fun to try something new, but next time I'll just use my standard apple pie recipe.

Awesome apple pie! I also added about 1-1/2 tsps cinnamon directly to the apples, along with about a tsp. of nutmeg. I added an additional two apples and stacked the pie high! The result was a perfect, level apple pie that had not sunken in.

This pie was really yummy!  I cut it while it was still hot, so maybe that is why it was really runny inside, and all the 'goo' slid out.  In any event, the taste was fantastic.  I did a regular crust on top, and just added the sugar/butter mix to the top of the apples before putting the top crust on.  I am going to try adding some cornstarch or somthing to try to thicken it up a little more for next time, but it could have just been the apples I used (organic red delicious).  This one is DEFINATELY a keeper, and everyone can make it perfectly with a little tweaking of their own.  Just try it.  You'll surprise yourself with how well you do.  Come on!

Nothing special - this was good but we prefer the old standard apple pie or a caramel apple pie.  I found the extra work was just not work it on this one. I have made a lot of apple pies over the years; it is my husband's favorite pie but none of us are crazy about this recipe.

Unique technique that tastes great!  I have also used the apples and carmel topping as a base for apple crisp.... delicious... even better than the pie version.

This was the most simple pie to make. I received so many compliments. This is the pie I will make every time. I did mix 3/4 of the liquid with the apples before adding to crust, then I put the top crust on and cut 1" slivers then slowly poured the remaining sauce on.  EXCELLENT!

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the results.  The sauce turned out extremely soupy, which I don't like.  The sauce, prior to baking, was excellent for dipping apple slices in though.  I will make this again as the flavor is great, but will add 3 more tablespoons of flour to the butter.

It was okay, the bottom was mushy even the next day. I liked the way the sauce tasted. If I do make it again, I will slice the apples thicker and make a better lattice crust. I guess my preference for the original apple pie will remain. Thanks for something a little different.

This is the best and easiest apple pie recipe!! I am always looking for apple pie recipes that does not have the sauce runny. I finally found it!! The only thing different is that I tossed the apples with apple pie spice in a bowl before I placed them in the pie crust. This is a definite keeper.

Best apple pie ever! Loved the taste! I bought the deep dish pie crust and used that, and I found out that I only needed 1/2 the amount of apples. This recipe is worth trying out!

First pie I have ever made. This recipe was very easy to follow. I poored the mixture over the apples before I put the top on. Also brushed the top with an egg water splash and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I've been using the same apple pie recipe for 20 years but decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did. I made 2 pies and gave one to my neighbor, who proclaimed this the best apple pie ever. I used deep dish pie plates so I had no problem with the pie spilling over in the oven, though I probably should have increased the amount of apples accordingly. Next time. I like the way the top crust gets a little crunchy. I mixed some lemon juice and cinnamon with the apples before putting them in the crust. Thanks for sharing Grandma's recipe.

I only gave this 3 stars because I have attempted to make this recipe 3 times and each time, the pie turned out runny.  I didn't cut the pie until the next day so it had plenty of time to cool.  Everyone still loved the flavor but jokingly called it apple soup.  It is definitely good over ice cream though.

Wow!  This recipe is AMAZING!  My husband considers himself an apple pie connoisseur and he says this is the best he's ever tasted.  I did add some cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger to the apples and added a Tbsp of vanilla (but subtracted 1 Tbsp of water.)  It looks beautiful and tastes even better.

Great recipe. Followed reviews by others and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to apples. Doubled the sauce, used about 90% of it (added 1 tsp. nutmeg and 2 tsp. vanilla to it). Smelled great, tasted great. Beautiful presentation!

This recipe was fantastic. I love the idea of pouring the syrup over the lattice crust- it gave the final product a wonderful, candied over top crust. Instead of doing the standard lattice top I took the time to have some fun with it. I used a maple leaf cookie cutter and covered my pie with with a little more flare. 
My boyfriend loves apple pie over any other dessert and gave this one rave reviews!

This recipe was fantastic. I love the idea of pouring the syrup over the lattice crust- it gave the final product a wonderful, candied over top crust. Instead of doing the standard lattice top I took the time to have some fun with it. I used a maple leaf cookie cutter and covered my pie with with a little more flare. 
My boyfriend loves apple pie over any other dessert and gave this one rave reviews!

The crust on this pie is out of this world...weaving the crust and pouring the sugar mixture over it makes this pie outstanding.  I made it with mixed berries and apples and it is amazing, I wouldn't change a thing.

What an awesome pie!  This was the very first recipe I tried from allrecipes.com and I became hooked on the site.  I had never made an apple pie from scratch before and chose this one for my debut at an apple pie baking contest that we had at work.  I actually won first place (an honorary memeber of the American Pie Council was the judge and I won a four day trip to a resort in Puerto Rico for two with airfare included!)  This recipe makes me proud to say that I am an award-winning apple pie baker :)

I was a bit puzzled about pouring the liquids over the pie, but did it anyway.  I loved this pie!!  I'm not usually the apple pie fan, but I was this time.  The syrupy stuff was great.  The only change that I MIGHT make would be to add nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. to the apples.  I did miss that part.  It was wonderful!

WOW. This is a great pie.  I mixed the cinnamon in with the apples as suggested, but otherwise followed the directions.  It came out great. I would give it 10 stars if I could.  My family thinks I'm a brilliant baker!

This made a wonderful pie.  My apple pies usually turn out too runny, but this was perfect (I added an extra tablespoon of flour to the filling as recommended by some reviewers).  I poured the sauce directly over the apples before putting on the top crust.

We LOVED this! Add a little vanilla to the syrup. We made it with the "Best Ever Pie Crust" - PERFECT comination - I've tried it with frozen crusts a couple of times, and making it with this crust makes a MUCH better pie! It's worth the work. I was told by an apple pie lover that this was the best one she ever had!

Easy to make-  This pie looks fantastic and tastes wonderful.  It is always a hit at get togethers.  I use Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts to save time.

This pie was defintely worth making and will most likely make again. The only thing I changed was that I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon. Also instead of using 8 Granny Smith apples, I used 5. Great recipe!

Beautiful and delicious.  I added a little cinnamon, and it was perfect.  The lattice crust is not hard and really makes it look great.  This is a keeper.

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  This is the first pie I have ever made and I was very suprised at how good it was.  The filling was thick and delicious and didn't run out of the pie like my mom's always did.  The only thing I changed is that I tossed the apples in the hot mixture and then poured into the crust rather than pouring the liquid over the top.  I am making this again very soon!

I am not a pie lover, but this pie was awesome!  Followed others suggestions about putting most of the sauce inside the pie before the crust...then just brushed the left over sauce on top of the lattice top.

My brother made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it tasted as good as our Grandmother's recipe!  The top crust was a little different but the filling, crust texture, flavor, everything was superb!  I could eat it cold or hot!!  This was our first Thanksgiving without our Grandma and this pie brought back a lot of good memories for my family!

Terrific!  My dad thought this was the best apple pie he had tasted in a very long time, which is saying alot if he gives a recipe a thumbs up!  Mine turned out a bit runny, but the apples this year are loaded with extra sugar from it being so dry here and I believe that's what contributed to the extra moisture, however everyone that had it said that's the best way, especially served warm with vanilla ice cream!

This pie was delicious and very easy to make. I cheated and used store bought pie crust, but it turned out perfectly. I also used granny smith, fiji, and macintosh apples...everyone loved it!

This recipe has so many good reviews it probably does not need another to sing it's praises. However, this pie was fantastic. I made it with baja apples. I sliced them individually and stirred in one lemon/water solution before adding to the crust. It was so yummy my boyfriend and I ate it with delight. This is in my favorites, I do not make much pie but this one will be made again!

This is a great recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it. I have made a lot of these pies. Super simple and yummy. I add a few diced up carmels in with the sliced apples sometimes just to do it a little different.

Wow! This was so easy.  I used little sour apples so I had to use about 15 of them but I made 3 pies 3 days ago and they are gone. My husband who doesn't care for fruit pies said it was the best he ever had and asked me to make it for the 4th of July party we are going to today.  I did exactly as it said as far as assembly, I added a little vanilla and apple pie spice to the syrup. Also pilsbury pie crusts really make this pie a snap!

Really good recipe. Tips:  I added 1/4 cup whiskey, 1/4 cup flour, 2 T sugar, and 1 T of apple pie spice and coated it onto the apples, and let it sit in my fridge for 10 mins.  After taking it out, I spooned out the apples into the crust with a slotted spoon so that some of the marinade didn't make the pie runny. Just follow the recipe after that. It turned out fantastic!

The best apple pie ever!  Reminds me of the caramel apples I used to eat as a child.  I like to mix the sugar and butter liquid in with the apples before placing them in the crust (leaves the top crust less sticky and burned after baking).

Excellent pie!!  After reading the reviews, I did add some cinnamon to the apples.  I also mixed the sauce in with the apples, then covered with a top crust.

This apple pie recipe is excellent!!!!! I am a begining baker (and a novice all-around cook for that matter) and I just wanted to make something easy. This recipe was a sinch. I used equal amounts of granny smith and gala apples, added some cinnamon and vanilla and a bit more flour than the recipe called for and it turned out perfect. Everyone raved about this pie. My boyfrined is not a pie eater and he almost ate the whole thing himself. Everyone is waiting for me to make it again. Thanks Rebecca!!!!

My family LOVES this pie! It is so easy and just wonderful. I did add a few things  I put allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg in the pie.  I also poured the sauce on top of the apples and the rest on top of the lattice.  It always turns out great!!

I have made this pie very many times and everytime I do it gets scarfed up! My father hates cinnamon and therefore had avoided apple pies. I made this for him and insisted he try, now he raves to everyone about how great my pies are! Thanks to the author of course! I also substituted the apples for fresh picked pears, and there results are fantastic! I even mixed apples and pears! I am not good at the lattice top crust so I just put a full crust on top after adding the sauce in then top the crust with a little bit more of the sauce half way through baking! Awsome pie!

I had never made an apple pie and after searching the site and reading the reviews I decided to try this one.  I am so glad that I did.  I made two of these for Easter dinner this year. It was delicious and so easy to make, everyone loved it.  My husband thought that it lacked cinnamon.  I thought so too at first but then decided it was great as it was.  It seemed even better the second day as the sauce seemed to set.  I was concerned that not all of the apples would be covered with the sauce but there was no need to worry.  We really enjoyed how the top crust was carmelized.  This is an excellent pie and I will make it many more times. Oh...I used cortland apples.  Thanks!

This recipe was a great success!First time making an apple pie, used Best Ever Pie Crust(with some variations of my own)and for the pie, added tsp of cinnamon and 10 caramels melted with butter/sugar mixture. My husband loved it so much that he had me make another whole pie just for him!

I've made this FABULOUS pie a few times now and always bring it to "that" party where I'm sure to get plenty of raves of delight and pats on the back for all my hard work. I DREAM of this pie late in the night- how can I ever thank you for giving me this recipe?

I have made this twice for Irish friends who detest cinnamon in their pie. It is super easy with my handy dandy apple gadget I got from a certain kitchen gadget party! It really is a great pie, I used ready made pie crust and another gadget, the crinkle cutter, to make the lattice. This pie is a snap to make, and I am finding out that I don't care too much for cinnamon and spice in my pie either. Just apples, crust and buttery caramel!!

Great recipe! I could not believe my first pie worked as well as it did. I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe from this site and mixed most of the sauce with the apples before applying the top crust, then brushed the left over sauce on top.

This was a delicious apple pie! Very easy, it was gone immediately! The lattice crust gets slightly crispy and crystalized- yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, and sliced my apples thinly, so they became soft. Will definitely make this again.

Made this for the second time and can't say enough about how wonderful it is.  I used a latice crust and mixed half of the sauce with the apples before placing into the crust and poured the remaining sauce over the top after I finished the top crust.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the sauce and sprinkled a bit on the top.  It turned out picture perfect and tasted fabulous! Thank you for sharing!

Turned out great. I don't know how anyone could mess this one up. It turned out picture perfect and tasted like heaven. Different from the traditional way of baking it.

This is the best apple pie recipe!!  Easy to make and everyone loves it.  You don't even need to add cinnamon.  I add half the syrup mixture to the apples then the other half on top of the latticed crust and that seeps in to the crust and bakes beautifully.

The glaze for the apples is the best !!  It is so thick and yummy!  It leaves a beautiful shine to pie when done!  You won't be disappointed.

Delicious pie. Thanks for the recipe.  The only thing I think I may change is the sugar, was on the border for me for being to sweet, same for everyone that tried it.  Mind you only took 1 day for it to disappear.  Will now be my permanent apple pie recipe.

Delicious pie. Thanks for the recipe.  The only thing I think I may change is the sugar, was on the border for me for being to sweet, same for everyone that tried it.  Mind you only took 1 day for it to disappear.  Will now be my permanent apple pie recipe.

This is a great recipe if you add cinnamon! My husband and sons all loved this one. Very quick and easy. I even forgot to simmer the sauce and it turned out great. I used pre-made pie shells and found I had to put them on a cookie sheet because they overflowed the pie. A larger pie shell may not have this trouble.
