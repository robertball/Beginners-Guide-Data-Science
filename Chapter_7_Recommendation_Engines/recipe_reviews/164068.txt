This recipe is really chewy and delicious...without the butterscotch...I think the butterscotch makes it tooo rich.  Some peeps may like it..I made it with the butterscotch and one batch without....the butterscotch does not melt very easy..and is not that easy to spread on top of the cornflake mixture..unless I did something wrong.  Good recipe when omitting butterscotch!

10.29.17  I liked the crunch of this cornflake candy, and the flavor that is the most prominent is the peanut butter (nothing wrong with that!!).  The butterscotch chips almost seized up on me in the microwave, so I stirred in a bit of cream to add some moisture, and it still did not spread very easily.  I’m not convinced the butterscotch chip topping was an asset to this candy and thought it took the sweetness level over the top,  But in all fairness to the recipe, I used honey nut corn flakes which on their own added some sweetness.  if I used it again, I’d go ahead and melt the chips in a double boiler.  Maybe just a drizzle of a small amount of melted chocolate or butterscotch chips  might work a little better??  This didn’t quite measure up to my expectations, but it still was OK

The way I make these they are gluten free. 
I use Organic, non-gmo Cornflakes, and instead of brown sugar I use organic coconut sugar, I just like that taste better. 
I use organic cane sugar and instead of corn syrup I use Organic, gluten free Brown Rice Syrup, which has a bit of a caramel flavor to it. I use organic peanut butter and dry roasted gluten free peanuts from Costco. I do add a few TBS of butter to the coating because I think it gives it a better texture. And I omit the butterscotch chips...it would be too sweet that way. This way it's a great combination of salty and sweet, crunchy and chewy. Using the organic/non gmo ingredients does make it pricer, but I just don't go for gmo.
I've made this a couple of times and it was a hit!

These turned out perfectly. I left out the dry roasted peanuts and butterscotch chips, because I wanted it to be like the cornflake candy we used to have in the lunchroom when I was a kid. Delicious and easy!

This recipe was oddly sticky and I think the butterscotch makes it taste stale.  The taste is okay, I guess, but kind of unpleasant overall.
