Fantastic!  We don't like coconut, so substituted 1/2 cup of quick rolled oats in the mixture instead of the coconut.  Fabulous flavour.

Delicious topping. Much better than store bought fudge topping as it gets very gummy when frozen. I went a step further. First I didn't have what I needed for base & I wanted to make a dessert & I wanted to try the cooked topping.  I broke up 8 oz. of Oreo cookies & placed in bottom because thats all I had. Walmart carries full 1/2 gal rectangles of ice cream & I sliced & layered over the cookies. To get it to stick to the cookies so it would cut nicely, I put a large piece of plastic wrap over the ice cream layer & pressed down firmly so the cookies were than stuck to the ice cream. I than froze it while making the sauce. Removed the wrap when sauce was cool, poured on the sauce & returned to the cake to freezer. I waited till that froze, than added a 8 oz. layer of whip topping & sprinkled with salted peanuts. It was so delicious. It was the cooked topping that made it so good. I'm giving it 4 stars only because it didn't have a topping. It looked a bit bare to me to serve. I will make it again & will try the original base. I think my preference will be the Oreos, as that is my favorite store bought cookie!
