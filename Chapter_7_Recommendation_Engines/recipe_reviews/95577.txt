I've never given a one star review before...but this one gets my first ever, with no hesitation! I liked the combination of apples and cranberry, but the "crisp" topping was dry and tasted exactly like cardboard. Gross. I threw out all the leftovers...and there were a lot! It was a VERY dissappointing finale to an otherwise spectacular Thanksgiving meal. I could see all my guests were being polite and choking it down. I finally mumbled something about the topping being dry and tasteless, and no-one said anything..they all just stared politely into their bowls. I'll go back to may old tried and true crisp topping recipe. To all of you who want to try this recipe - pick a crisp topping from another recipe on this site. The one on the Maple Apple Crisp (by Crystal) is VERY good!

This was delicious.  I used Cranberry Sauce I from this website.  I do recommend using Granny Smith apples, as the recipe calls for.  I tossed in a couple of "unknown" apple varieties, along with a Granny Smith, but missed the firmness and tanginess of the GS.  The topping was superb.  Be sure to use whole wheat PASTRY flour, and not just plain ww flour!  Thanks, Dishy!

I enjoyed this recipe but I pretty much like anything with cranberry sauce in it.  Although I can't resist commenting on some of the former reivews.  Doesn't it make sense to try out a recipe first before making it for holiday dinners, birthday parties, etc???  If you don't like a recipe fine, but don't make an untested recipe for a big dinner and then be embarrassed when no one, not even you, likes it.

This was really tasty!  I added 1/4 c. sugar to the apples and next time I would add a bit of flour to thicken the juices.  I just felt it needed a little extra sugar to please my sweet tooth.  I used 1 can of Ocean Spray whole berry cranberry sauce and it was just the right amount.  I didn't have whole wheat flour so substituted A.P. and the topping was delicious!  Thanks for a great, easy fall recipe!

The negative reviews almost scared me away from this healthy recipe, but thank goodness I didn't listen to the naysayers.  I've tried all of this cooks's other recipes, and they are fabulous, so of course i had to try it, and i am soooo happy i did.  It was delicious and the whole family ate it up.  I made it precisely according to directions and didn't change a thing...except for topping it with whipped cream, of course.  There is such a thing as TOO healthy, i believe.  Thanks, What a Dish!

This is a great way to use up left over cranberry. I like to mix the apples and cranberry together.

I used cherry pie filling instead of cranberries and regular all purpose flour. Turned out great. Thanks.

What a Dish! you are right on with this recipe.  I loved it and it is so flexible.  I found the topping to be fabulous (Evie read the ingredients ~ NOT whole wheat flour, whole wheat PASTRY flour ~ that could why yours was not good).  I used a big round stoneware dish which was a little bigger than an 8 or nine inch square baking dish because I had about 8 granny smith apples that I wanted to use up.  I had two different cranberry sauce leftovers ~ one sweet and one tart with some pineapple in it ~ threw both of them in there and stirred them with the apples ~ added about 1/4 extra cup of oatmeal into the topping mixture since my dish was bigger.  Cooked for 50 minutes.  Fantastic!!!  I would say that any negative reviews on this recipe would be the result of operator error ~ not the fault of the recipe ~ a great and flexible recipe ~ will be my go to recipe now for the topping on any kind of fruit crisp.

I made this recipe two weeks ago and it has one of the best crisps I've ever tasted. Usually I can't stand the brick hard crisps and this was no way near that. It was moist and very tastey. I'm going to make if for our friends for this t-day. Thank you so much for sharing.

Can I say YUM!!! I make my own cranberry sauce and this was the perfect way to use up the leftovers. Hubby and I ate it as Thanksgiving dessert and as breakfast the next morning (oops, all gone!). We both LOVED it and this will become our standard Thanksgiving dessert from now on.  Not only is it delicious, it's super easy! I used regular white flour for the topping. There are very few ingredients in this recipe, but don't let that fool you - it's packed full of flavor and even better topped with vanilla bean icecream!  I don't understand the reviewer who said her topping tasted like cardboard and nobody ate it. I don't know WHAT she put in it, but the topping is SO good!

Based on Evie's review, I used the Maple Apple Crisp topping (by Crystal) instead of the one in this recipe, and it was great.  I made this recipe as a way to use up a big container of leftover fresh cranberry relish I had made for Thanksgiving (pulsed cranberries, sugar, triple sec, and orange juice and zest).  It was great.  A very nice balance of zesty vs. sweet.  Careful not cutting the apples too thin-- mine ended up kind of like applesauce.  Still tasted good, but I would have liked a little more texture to them.

This is especially yummy if you take the refrigerator sugar cookie dough that comes in a roll and slice it like if you were making cookies but instead place over the apple/cranberry mixture.  I also add nuts to the apple mixture.  Easy and DELICIOUS!!!

I made this into 2 individual servings to use up some leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving.  This is my new favorite apple crisp recipe. I used Braeburn apples (because that is what I had to use up) and homemade cranberry sauce.  The combination of flavors with the buttery, crumbly topping was perfect. I polished off both of the ramekins in a weekend's time and enjoyed every bite!

We made this for company one night and liked it so much we made it again within the week! We found it was exceptionally good with homemade sauce and very thinly sliced apples.

I thought this recipe turned out quite tasty. I followed the user comment suggestions and used AP flour instead of the whole wheat pastry flour. Others had mentioned that this dish tended to get too juicy, so I tossed a little flour into the cranberry/apple mix. Overall, this was a simple dessert that was easy to make - Homey and tasty, but not going to "wow" anyone either.

I am not a huge fan of cranberries, I usually only have one bite of the sauce at thanksgiving, but this was excellent and extremely easy to make. I served it warm over vanilla ice cream and it was a hit!

This was EXCELLENT!
I didn't have any cranberry so I used Dole frozen mixed berries thawed. I only used half a cup of oats and added a half a cup of granola.

This was good. I used white all purpose flour and a little more brown sugar (1 cup of each, flour, oats, sugar) and one teaspoon cinnamon. Then added a pinch of salt (I checked out the recipe for Maple Apple Crisp by Crystal, and it was very, very similar). I could not get the cold butter to mix in and I was in a bit of a hurry so I put the toppings in the microwave for 30 seconds and then mixed them together. (the toppings were wet and crumbly). We ate it hot with vanilla ice cream. Great way to use up the left over cranberry sauce. My husband really like it too.

This was  yummy. A little sweet for the topping but still perfect for that sweet tooth.  The blend of the cranberries with the apples is deliciously sweet and tart, topping off with whipped cream. I liked this cold as well as warm. When it is cold it is firm and has a good flavor.This is yummy.

Great flavor!  Next time I'll follow the recipe and use Granny Smith apples - I think they produce less juice.  At any rate, I'll probably toss the apples in a little flour to thicken up any juice that's produced.

Wow! Enough to inspire me to cook more deserts! I used A.P. flour instead of what was suggested, and I also used the "Cranberry, apricot, raisins sauce" (also in allrecipes.com) for cranberry sauce. Really really good, tangy, and sweet. Good crust too. Had it with vanilly ice cream. Yum! Bf loved it.

I love this recipe! I like the tartness of the granny smith apples and I mix the apples and cranberry sauce together instead of one on top of the other. I use 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce for the crisp topping.

I thought this was going to be a great dish, however it was very soupy.  The idea was great as a new combination of fruits that I had not thought of, but I was disappointed with the end result.

Absolutely delish!  We *loved* the topping--it was crispy and crunchy, and the dish was just sweet enough ... we had it warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream ... oh, wow!

This was such an enjoyable dessert...thank you WhataDish! I did use homemade cranberry sauce (Pear Honey Cranberry Sauce from this site) & I only had 3 apples (two golden delicious & one gala) but I think that really was plenty. The crumb topping was soo good....but it was veen better w/ a scoop of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream. ;o) This recipe is a  keeper!

I made this for a neighbor, and then had to make another one for my family.  I was extremely pleased with the way it turned out.  I made is according to the recipe, except for the flour because I only had white flour on hand.  Very good - will definitely make it again, and it will probably be on the dessert table for the holidays!!

This turned out great - my family enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm wondering where in the recipe it indicates where to add the brown sugar? I added it to the crisp ingredients as it seemed the cranberry sauce would be sweet enough to flavor the apples. It turned out fine, but I'm wondering what others did with the brown sugar?

This was such a good idea! It doesn't take many ingredients and is so simple. The vanilla ice cream on top is a yummy must. I omitted the cinnamon, but only because I am allergic to it and it was still lovely and my husband was much impressed. (It's hard to get him to eat deserts that aren't chocolate or pudding) Will make again.. I did make one cgange.. I added some vanilla in with the apples, but I really love my vanilla.

This was a beautiful and delicious crip!  Served it for Thanksgiving dessert.  I loved the cranberry sauce mixed with the apples, but I did use 1 cup, instead of 1.5.  Used coconut whipped cream as topper.

This is delicious!  My GS apples were a bit too tart, so I sprinkled  sugar over them. Also used AP  flour as WW pastry flour isn't available in my area.  The only change I would make is to add a spoonful of flour to the apples as they were very watery.  This is definitely going into the dessert file.

Delish! I added 1/2 teaspoon salt to the topping and had a bit more leftover cranberry sauce. It worked. Loved the tart and sweet combo. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Yummy.

Perhaps the fault lay in not using Granny Smith apples but another variety instead. I was quite enthused given the ingredients and the majority of the reviews. It emerged from the oven looking and smelling delicious, but it simply did not taste good to me. I liked that it was a bit tart, but the flavors did not come together in an appetizing way.

I have made this couple times now.  I recommend using Granny Smith apples to balance out the sweetness.  I always double the cinnamon.  The topping was rather bland, but other than that I will try I again.

I have made this recipe several times. My family and I absolutely love it. I only use Granny Smith apples which is the perfect compliment to the cranberry sauce. I suggest serving it with ice cream~ DELISH!

I needed to use up some Fuji apples and leftover cranberry sauce, so decided to try this recipe even though I didn't have the right kind of apples. I Chopped  the apples into large chunks hoping it would not turn to applesauce. Lol It still turned out great and we ate the whole pan in 2 days!  If you still have leftover cranberry sauce, I also recommend the Cranberry Sauce Muffins! Those are great too!

Great recipe! I substituted pears because I hasd a bunch that needed to be used. I also threw in a couple of TBS pomegranate jelly to thicken the filling. The idea came to me and I went with it. Turned out great! This is a very versatile recipe that could handle a myriad of modifications. Berries? Peach? Nuts in topping? The possibilities are endless! So glad I found an awesome recipe to use up my leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving:-)

So Yummy! I had leftovers from Christmas, and my mother in law makes cranberry sauce from scratch that is to die for, so I didn't want it to go to waste when we had way more cranberry sauce leftover after the turkey was gone. I added a pinch of nutmeg,and I used all purpose flour, and I found the apples were a tad over cooked, so next time I would put it in there for only about 35 minutes.

This was very good and very easy.  I made half a recipe, used all purpose flour, and added a bit of rhubarb and some blueberries that I had in the freezer.  Also a little extra sugar for the rhubarb.  I served it with some Cool Whip.  A great way to use up leftover cranberry sauce.  This recipe is so good, I would even make it with fresh cranberry sauce.  Apples and cranberry -- a great flavor combo.
