Maybe my review is a poor representation of the recipe because I didn't follow the canning process.  I was looking to make a cooked spiced peach recipe for a topping to put on Greek yogurt, so I found this and worked with it.  I cooked the water, sugar and honey in a saucepan and added frozen peaches (found a bag on sale) and all the spices in ground form until heated through.  I let it all cool and spooned some over my yogurt and MMMMMMMM!  The combination was just what I was looking for.  I am thinking of venturing into the world of canning, and when I do, I will turn to this recipe!

I haven't gotten to try these yet, but so far it looks good. took a lot less than 8 pounds, but I'm using 6 pints instead of 3 quarts. Also used ground allspice, and ground cloves. just put a dash in each jar, and 1/2 a stick of cinnamon.

Going to try this but have a question. How does one treat the fruit to prevent browning?

To prevent browning of the peaches during the peeling process, keep peeled peaches in acidified water. Mix 1 teaspoon ascorbic acid crystals or finely crush six 500 mg Vitamin C tablets in one gallon of water. You can also use a commercial anti-darkening product by following the manufacturerâ€™s directions.

Peaches may be packed into the jars raw or hot. Raw packing is a safe method but generally results in a poorer product than hot packed peaches. Raw packed peaches float to the top of the jar, and the jars usually lose a lot of the juice (along with flavor) through siphoning. When siphoning occurs, tiny food fibers sometimes get lodged between the jar and the sealing compound of the lid causing sealing failure. Because air is driven out of the tissues of the raw peach when it is heated, hot packed peaches are less likely to float, more peaches fit into the jar, and the juice is less likely to boil out when jars are removed from the canner.

Used 10 lbs of peaches from our neighbor's tree. It made 8 pints, and still have enough liquid for another pint. They look gorgeous. One pint didn't seal so, I'm putting it in the fridge for a few days before tasting, as I want the flavors to run through. Too bad the spices weren't cooked in the liquid, as I love the smell of canning spices.  I am excited to taste these. However, I packed the peaches tightly and they are still floating in the jar. Curious.

Just made this recipe without variation. Used all the peaches but probably had enough syrup to make a second batch. Used very fresh,ripe local peaches so there was plenty of natural juice. Will probably save these for the winter holidays--the spices are a natural for that time of year. The left over syrup would make a nice hot spiced drink. . I'm sure these spiced peaches are going to be great tasting.

I had enough syrup leftover to fill double the quart jars with this recipe. I only had 6 lbs of smaller sizes peaches and they filled three jars exactly.  Next time I will adjust the pounds of peaches to make a full canner. The peaches didn't float in the jars near as badly as with raw packing, but it was a little more work. The cinnamon sticks and whole spices look rustic and I think these will make nice gifts.
