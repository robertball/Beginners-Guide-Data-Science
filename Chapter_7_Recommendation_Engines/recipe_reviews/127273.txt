This is also an old family tradition, we call it Jello cake. My personal favorite combo is lemon cake, lime jello, and some lemon pudding mixed in with the whipped cream to top it off. Yum yum, I make it all the time. It has a surprisingly refreshing taste.

My mom used to make this for us all the time. She wouldn't make a double layer though, just one layer in a 13 x 9 dish. Or she would make "Purple Poke Cake" with a blackberry jello, etc.  You can use almost any kind of jello with cool whip.  Very good stuff!

We used to have what we called "Jello Cake" at school. it was one of the only things the school made everyone liked! I ended up telling my mom about it and we made some at our house. Very delicious!

This is an old family favorite. We make this every holiday and just change up the colors. Cherry and Blue Raspberry with the whip topping makes a beautiful 4th of July cake, Orange and Lime for Halloween, Cherry and Lime for Christmas the possiblities are endless and YUMMY! Have fun.

My family has always enjoyed this cake as anytime - though we usually just keep both layers strawberry or cherry JELL-O. We've always called it Bleeding Cake. It was actually my wedding cake! It's delish!

This is a blast from my past...

My Mom used to make this Jello cake for each of us on our birthday.

My brother and I were just talking about this a couple of weeks ago. It was something we always looked forward to.

We always called this "Jello Cake."  And we used different colors for different holidays.  Fourth of July, we'd use red and blue jello, and then on top of the whip cream we'd put fresh cut strawberries.  I was a picky kid growing up, and this was the only cake that I liked!

My grandmother made this cake every year at Christmas time.  It was something I always looked forward to.  Seeing the recipe here brought back happy memories.  Now that she is gone, I think I'll make it for my own family and continue the tradition.  Everyone loves this moist, refreshing cake.

Tasty, easy, and pretty. Used lime and apricot gelatin and seven-minute frosting instead of whipped topping. (My frosting didn't end up fluffy but it tasted good).

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out well. It was pretty simple to do and something different. I will be making this again.

This cake was very yummy and easy to make. I made it about a week ago for a Christmas party to end the semester (I'm a college student) and my friends really liked it. The cakes were rich, but balanced perfectly with the light Cool Whip. Big success, and was easy to make in between exams.

Perfect holiday cake. If your thinking the Jello in it would make it taste odd then think again. You really can't make out any gelatin elasticity and the Jello works to add a fantastic burst of flavor to the cake. I chose to use a light white whipped frosting versus the Cool-Whip and it turned out great. I can imagine it would be great with the cool whip if you were doing a variation in the Summer, for the 4th of July for instance with red, white and blue. I would make this again no question. It's worth the extra stage of adding the Jello and chilling. More than one guest said they too had made a poke cake so it's not exactly the most original recipe. You just can't lose with this one though.

I have never made a poke cake before and I was not disappointed.  This went fast in our house.
