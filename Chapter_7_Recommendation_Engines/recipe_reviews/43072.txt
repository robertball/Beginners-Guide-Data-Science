I cut this recipe in half and sauteed some chopped onion in olive oil (no butter) along with 3 cloves of garlic.  I then added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole and then added 1 Tbsp. of dried basil, 1/4 tsp. of oregano, and 2 tsp. of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  I used half and half instead of cream and the sauce thickened up nicely.

Except for the butter, which I didn't use as I didn't feel it was necessary, this is a near classic version of the traditional Italian tomato sauce with vodka and cream. I omitted the red pepper flakes and used tomatoes I had put up from my garden. Simmered the tomatoes for several minutes until slightly reduced and thickened, added the vodka and simmered for another five minutes or so, then stirred in the cream and cooked just until heated through.  I served this over breaded veal and farfalle (bowtie) pasta.

i thought this recipe was excellent.  i added some garlic and onions the first time i made it, and now i'm going to add some mushrooms.  i didn't add as many red pepper flakes as the recipe called for, just sprinkled some in.  i couldn't believe how fast and easy this was to make.

This was absolutely wonderful! I used cream cheese in place of heavy cream & parmesan cheese. I also added garlic & topped off with parsley. I didn't have penne pasta, so used fettucini. Will definately make again!

I have had other vodka sauces that I liked better than this recipe.  I thought that there was too much vodka in it and it "burned" the sauce.

This was delicious. We used fat free half and half and it turned out great. I will be making this a lot in the future.

WAY TOO SPICY! Plus the sauce was a little too thin because of the amount of pasta. I'd definitely decrease the amount of red pepper flakes.

Not bad. My sauce was thin, but that's my own fault. I had to make my own cream, because I didn't have any. I used Cavatappi pasta and diced tomatoes, because I didn't have whole peeled ones. I will be making this again, but I'll make sure to have the cream on hand. Thanks for the recipe.

Just seemed there was a lot left out of this recipe and too much alcohol. Too boozy, so I cut that down,  Added fresh basil, a little oregano, fresh garlic, and olive oil instead of butter.  Be sure to use only fresh grated parmesan. Now you're talking!

Love this version of the recipe (Best on Allrecipes).  I also added 1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes to give a more intense tomato flavor.

I do a very similar version of this recipe.  All same ingredients, but varying amounts.  One difference is that I serve mine with fresh chives - heaven!

Absolutely amazing recipe. My boyfriend and I finished a whole pound of pasta together. He is picky with foods, but he LOVED this dish. 
Very easy as well.

This was delicious and very simple and quick to make which makes life so much easier after a long day at work.  I think next time I might had some chicken to the sauce to change it up a bit, but it's delicious as is.

As written, kind of blah and not worth the trouble. But it goes quickly to five stars if you . . . skip the butter all together. Instead, saute some onions and garlic in olive oil. Add the tomatoes, but don't drain them. That liquid will be great in your sauce! To thicken your sauce, skip the heavy cream and use 8 ounces of neufchatel cheese (which is just low fat cream cheese). Add basil and oregano to taste with a little fresh ground pepper. I cut back the vodka to 1 cup and it was plenty and I only used 1 teaspoon pepper flakes and it was plenty spicy for us. I know this is a huge change to the recipe, but I'm sorry to say it was just so bland as written. Oh, and I also often add some sauteed mushrooms to this sauce - super yummy!!! And I use bowtie pasta. It's just a fun way to serve pasta!
