This turned out pretty good and that is coming from someone who doesn't love eggplant. I left the skin on them out of personal preference and to make things simple, I just let the eggplant slices sit in the "marinade" for 30 minutes instead of coating each slice. Doing it this way really added flavor. They do flare up quite a bit so I recommend grilling them on upper rack of your grill. Overall good recipe and one of the better eggplant ones I have had.
