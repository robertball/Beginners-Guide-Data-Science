Made ground beef tacos yesterday for a Saturday lunch using this taco seasoning, and we really enjoyed them.  I didn't have "hot" smoked paprika on hand, so just used regular smoked paprika, and this seasoning had just the right of kick for us.

I made this as listed except for the chili powder. I only had dark chili powder so I used that. I suspect that the only difference there might have been color perhaps... The recipe was a hit at the house as all the leftover taco meat was gone by the next day!

I actually made this twice. The first time was ok, I found myself adding more garlic, onion powder, corn starch, and adding red pepper flakes.

The first time I tried out this recipe I knew I would be replacing the taco seasoning recipe I had been using for years.  The hot smoked paprika and coriander really make it stand out.  I also mixed up a large batch of this and used it as my holiday gift for my co-workers.

This seasoning was delicious.  Didn't have minced onions so I used onion powder.  I hate envelope Taco seasoning that have stuff in them you can't pronounce.  Family really enjoyed the flavor and made plenty for several Taco nights.  Thank you

I made this per the recipe but I don't stock 'hot smoked paprika'. 
I liked it but it didn't have the zing I wanted. The coriander was a nice addition.
