Excellent for Ideal Protein dieters and healthy for anyone and everyone.  Used it tonight on (pounded thin) chicken breasts.  Brushed 1/2 t. olive oil per side of each piece of meat, sprinkled seasoning mix on each side, baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, turning once midway.  Great flavor!  Followed recipe exactly and everyone liked it.

I didn't have mace, savory, or parsley on hand. But I made this with the remaining ingredients. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and upped the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. It turned out great. I'd like to try this again with the ingredients I missed the first go around.
