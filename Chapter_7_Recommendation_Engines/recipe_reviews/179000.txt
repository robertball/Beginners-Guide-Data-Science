This was very good.  I halved the recipe to cook 1# of boneless sirloin steaks for two of us, mainly because I like a lot of sauce!  I used chicken broth made from bouillon instead of canned beef broth, because that's what I had.   I used 2 whole cloves of garlic, instead of the 1 1/2 cloves that it says when you halve the recipe to 6 servings.

I let it marinade for about half an hour at room temperature, and pan-seared the steaks.  After I took the steaks out to rest, I deglazed the pan with the boiling marinade which helped to reduce it quickly to the consistency I was looking for (a thick sauce that is the consistency of honey).  I added in about 2 tbs of brown sugar because the acidity and salt levels seemed a bit too much for me when I tasted  the sauce.  This did the trick!  It was delicious, and DH and I were both licking the sauce from the plates!  This would be excellent on chicken and pork, as well.  It's going in our "family favorite" file!

I followed the recipe almost exactly and this came out fantastic.  I cooked over charcoal at medium heat... Make sure you don't overcook sirloin.  When serving, cut across the grain.  Also, I used two tablespoons of Grace brand jerk seasoning (the hot version) and one tablespoon of World Harbors brand jerk marinade in my mix.  It ended up with enough just enough heat for the fan of something different, but not obnoxiously hot.  I put mine on white rice with a side of black beans that were cooked with ham hocks.  Excellent dish!

Good flavor but could have used a little more heat.  I cut this in half because it made a lot of marinade. If I were to make this again, I would reduce the oil to 2 tablespoons.
