6.6.16  Noodle bowls are very trendy right now, and I decided  this would be lunch today.   This was surprisingly good and really is "superfast."  I did add some frozen peas and sliced red bell pepper for a little pop of color, and I think grated carrot might also add some eye appeal.  Next time, I’ll probably add another mushroom, but IMO nothing else needs to be changed in this simple recipe.  OK, admittedly, it is high in sodium and carbs, but hey folks, you’re using convenient and inexpensive ramen noodles!  Everything in moderation, right?  The fresh lime really brightens the flavor, and the garlic chile paste and sesame oil reinforces the Asian theme.  Thanks Kristin for a tasty new lunch treat.

Amazing! I added garlic and onion and sautéed them (plus the) jalapeños in sesame oil until aromatic. Then i added a teaspoon of soy sauce and a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar to the water. I try to make ramen all the time and rarely succeed. This one is amazing and i WILL be making it again!!

Wow!  Made this quick little dish for dinner and was greatly surprised.  Added just a hint of garlic and onion powder, along with the some finely chopped red peppers and loved it!   Quick, easy and oh so so good! Will be making it again. Thanks for sharing!
