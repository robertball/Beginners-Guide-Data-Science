I have made these cookies for years. My sister sent me a copy of the recipe off of the pudding box. I have used banana, lemon and coconut cream pudding depending on the flavor or date I am making them for. My children and my grandchildren love them. They freeze and ship overseas well. I have used them for bake sales and for dessert trees. I have always had good luck with making them and complements  where ever I took them. Just have fun making them and eating them.

GREAT cookie! I used all butter, instant CHEESECAKE pudding mix and extra-dark chocolate chips. What I liked most about this cookie dough was you didn't need to chill it. The instant pudding firmed up the dough enough so you could just mix it and just go. HUGELY popular with my husband. Absolutely yummy.

I added the zest of one orange to these and they really complemented the vanilla and chocolate flavours. You can taste the vanilla pudding on first bite. I searched chocolate chip cookies and displayed recipes by highest rating - only after did I realize these only had one persons' rating! Fortunately, they are terrific.

Making these cookies are almost like "cheating in the cookie olympics. They came out perfectly soft and held their shape very well when baking. I added a little cinnamon and some chopped, candied pecans as well. Definitely keeping this recipe on hand.

These are fabulous - soft, moist and so yummy.  I have several other chocolate chip cookie recipes; this is my hubby's favorite.  We can't keep our hands out of the cookie jar.

I was not a fan of these.  The texture was off somehow (probably the pudding) and it was chewier than normal.  Not gooey chewy (which I like) but just off somehow.  Also the flavors were a bit bland for me.

I used chocolate pudding & about 1/2 bag of choc. chips.  They turned out WONDERFUL!  I told my husband they should be called "PMS Cookies" - they were so full of chocolate....just what the doctor ordered! :)

Great recipe, I only had chocolate pudding in the house on my first try and they disappeared almost as quick as they cooled, a double chocolate whammy!

I have to rate this recipe as five star. I beat the magarine, butter, sugar and pudding mixture as if I am creaming for a cake until light and fluffy. Cookies stay soft even after they are cold. I like to use semi swet chips too. Cuts the sweetness and adds a more classy taste in my opinion.

Best cookie recipe ever.  I altered it a few times once with banana pudding and than with chocolate pudding. My favorite version I put a picture of up its with chocolate pudding and peanut butter chips delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.
