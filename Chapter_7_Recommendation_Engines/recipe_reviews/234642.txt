Very delicious. I cooked it in the wok instead of the oven, since mine is not working. It was fantastic. I would make it again.

Very delicious!  I didn't have corriander so I subbed cumin since it's the closest spice profile. I also added a 1/2 Tbsp of molasses because I only had light brown sugar.  The steak marinated for a few hours in a glass Pyrex  Then, we transfered it to a cookie sheet to get an even cook. Make sure the sheet has depth because the marinade gets absorbed into the steak and once cooked the juices come out. Add in your favorite veggies, steamed or stir fried, and serve over rice. 

Next time I will try this in the wok.  The marinade and juices released when the steak is cooked are so good that you end up spooning it on your veggies anyway.  we also added Sriracha for heat.  YUMMMMY!  Even my very fickle 2 year old loved it.

I didn't have Coriander Seeds so I used Ground Coriander. 
1t of Coriander Seeds = 1 1/4t ground coriander and 3t = 1T so I needed 7 1/2 t of ground Coriander....Holy cow. Also, Flank Steak was a whopping $8.99/LB. So, between the cost of the meat and the cost of the Coriander IT WASN'T WORTH IT!

My family loves this!  I did read the reviews and made a few changes. We don't like coriander so I used cumin, and I added 1 teaspoon of lime zest   I also used a small eye of round roast because I didn't have flank. I then poured the sauce over the roast and slow cooked it in the oven on 275 for about 3 hours, checking it every 30 minutes and basted the roast each time.  I saut√©ed peppers, onions, and mushrooms in butter, salt and pepper and served it over white rice!  If you like Chinese food,  YOU WILL LOVE THIS! It is so easy!  Next time I am  going to make it in my crockpot!

I made it in a wok and made it according to the recipe. The marinaide didn't drip off. I thought there was to much coriander. .   Otherwise it would probably be better either broiling it so the marinaide drips off or using half the corriander.

This was delicious! I subbed lemon juice for lime juice (because I didn't have any lime handy). I cooked left over london broil in the sauce on the stove top... and everyone loved it - including my 3 yr old and 6 yr old.

I always try to make these recipes as written. I loved this one and will make it again. It was an easy and very tasty marinade. My coriander seemed to have little flavor so I did add some cumin. It was old I think. 
Anyways it was delicious. I cooked it on the stove top in a very hot pan and tried not to over cook the meat.
Next time I may marinate the steak and grill it and then cut it into strips afterwards to leave it a bit rare. This was good with green beans but would also be good with snow peas and water chestnuts for some crunch.I also might try throwing in some garlic cloves next time. 
 I doubled the sauce so I'd have enough and their was plenty. I served it with white rice. It was delicious and fast!!

This is a favorite! It's so easy and quick but so delicious!!!! I had a hard time finding cracker coriander seeds, so I just put them on whole, it crack myself. I don't have a broiling pan but everything works fine on a reg pan in the broiler. I use sushi rice as a side since it sticks a lil better

Another super easy recipe that is out of this world.  I couldn't find flank steak anywhere and wasn't liking the alternatives. As London Broil was on sale, I opted for that. I followed all other directions to the letter, but used fresh ginger instead.I did have to pound the snot out of the steak, though,  so it would be tender enough to properly absorb the marinade, and marinated it for about 4 hours in lieu of the recommended hour.  Scrumptious!

This is amazing. No need to broil, you can cook in a skillet over the stove. Amazing. Delicious. Would give 10 stars if possible.

Wow, this was great. Poured all ingredients in a food processor. The only exceptions I made was I added 1/4 cup of olive oil. After mixing all the ingredients I kept the small amount on the side to put on the meat after cooking. I cooked 2 delicious flank steaks on the grill instead of in the broiler and basting a few times . I grilled 4 minutes a side at 500 for medium. 3 pounds of meat was gone in 20 minutes, awesome!

Super delicious. I used fresh ginger instead of powdered, and added two serrano peppers for heat. Also marinated for 48 hours. Marinade is very balanced. Highly recommend this particular dish, will make it again myself.

Loved this simple flavorful recipe.  Our grocer did not have flank steak so I got inside round marinating steak.  The flank would probably have been better, but this was good.  Other than reducing the recipe by half (for two people) and stir frying on high (in vegetable oil and a little sesame oil), I followed the recipe as written.  My husband and I both loved the flavor.  I marinated for a couple of hours, and served as shown in the photo...with fresh green beans and basmati rice.  We both would have it again.

This was absolutely incredible - no changes, except I ground fresh ingredients. Leftover hint- the next morning, I used half a spoonful of the marinade to cook the scrambled eggs in.  Then I made a gravy with the rest of it, adding an egg to it.  Used that gravy as far as I could stretch it.  Best gravy ever

This would have been great had I not read the other reviews about using cumin instead of coriander.  That ruined the dish it gave it a very strange flavor.  Next time I‚Äôm planning to make it as is.  I think with the coriander how it originally states it would have been a good dish.  I advise against using cumin on this for sure!

This was so yummy! I subbed ground coriander for the coriander seeds and lemon juice for the lime juice because that's what I had on hand. I served it with batsami rice and green beans. It was a huge hit!

As submitted a solid, easy, and tasty recipe. It excels in its versatility, which is why I gave it five stars. I've used pork, chicken and beans as the main protein, along with myriad vegetables. I modified the marinade recipe for my family's tastes: 1T each cumin and coriander seed, along with  a good squirt of siracha and dollop of  molasses. I make a quadruple batch, using half of it for the recipe and the remaining to store in the fridge for future stir-fry. I'm not sure how long this actually lasts in the fridge; we end up using it up within a week to ten days.  Family favorite. Thanks, BadLittleChef.

I wish I took a picture but it didn‚Äôt last that long. This was so delicious and kid approved. The coriander made the beef flavorful but not overpowering and it was so easy it came together in minutes. I‚Äôm staying away from starches so I didn‚Äôt serve it with rice, but I think it would do very well with a rice side. I served with string beans.  A must try!

For the receipt alone, it was okay to mean because it was too sweet. I love sweets and I love sweeten BBQ meat but this was not kind on my pallet. I would suggest less sugar and it be good to go. Or eat with kimchi and it be a perfect balance

This was quick and easy. And very tasty. Enjoyed slightly sweet flavor and wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.  Served it over rice and steamed green beans in wok with beef with lid on as it finished.

WOW - this was a huge hit! Everyone loved it! The only thing I did different was I cooked the beef in a wok instead of using a broiler. Will definitely make again.

Really great idea to cook steak under the broiler, it kept the pieces evenly medium rare!  Cooking in a wok makes juices steam the meat which tends to over cook  the meat and it's not as tender .  I dry toasted my coriander in a cast iron skillet for about 3 minutes on high, shaking constantly, then crushed them up.  This added a really nice flavor.  I really love the tasted of the seeds.  Next time I will however crush them in my grinder.

This marinade is easy and absolutely delicious. I reduced the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons instead of 1/2 cup because I don't like sweet food, and the extra sugar is unnecessary and adds empty calories.

I made this with a few changes and it was excellent, will definitely make it again. Here are my changes: I doubled this recipe b/c I had 3 lbs of meat so I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/4 cup molasses (next time I will use 1/2 cup) I added 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and I added 1/4 cup olive oil which I will omit next time as it wasn't necessary.  I did grind the coriander seeds in my coffee mill and it worked perfectly, and instead of doubling the seeds, I only used 3 TBS. We Loved it!

Very good.  I didn't think there was enough marinade at first, but it flavored the beef just right.  I also served this with rice and green beans.

I think it would be better with fish sauce instead of soy sauce; fresh ginger instead of powdered ginger; and put in one chopped Thai pepper.

I really liked it.  I revised a few things.  I used 2 tsp. of ground coriander, used a wok instead of the oven, and I had leftover roast that I sliced thin and used instead of the steak.  The picture showed green beans with it, so I had it with green beans.  It was very good!  I'll try it with steak the next time.

I found that the amount of coriander seed was overwhelming.  It was all I could taste. Perhaps with half or less coriander it would be better.

Loved it, was completely floored when I tasted it and loved it. Next time I will make it in the oven. I made it on a skillet and it got a bit dry on me. Extremely easy recipe to fallow, I used roundtop beef steak I had and it came out super tender.

Absolutely Delicious!!  I only had light brown sugar and lemon so I used those as substitutes and it tasted amazing!  I also cooked the steak in a wok and took it out after a few minutes. I then put in a variety of chopped vegetables and softened rice noodles into the wok with the remaining juices and a little soy sauce. Yum

I used brown rise, frozen green beans (I steamed the green beans) and poured some of the liquid that was left over on top after adding the beef.  I found the beef very tender juicy, and tasty.  The dish was delicious and I plan on sharing this dish with friends.
