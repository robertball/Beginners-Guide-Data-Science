Forget the yogurt. Just put the whole jar of marshmallow fluff and pkg of cream cheese with 1 tsp of vanila.

I am 9 years old and I think it is so good even with different types of yogurt. I have tried it with strawberry and tropical punch yogurt.

Whoa!! This was a hit!! Due to other members saying it was too runny, I lightened up on the yogurt a little but it was perfect!! My friends are super picky and I didn't think they would like it but it was gone in minutes!!

I will definetly make this again!!!

I used Strawberry cream cheese instead of plain. It gives it just a hint of strawberry and made the fruit taste stronger. Especially the strawberries.lol

I agree with the previous reviewer.  Forget the yogurt.  Use one pkg cream cheese, one container marshmello fluff and some vanilla extract.  Add a couple dashes of food coloring and you have an excellent fruit dip! :)

I noticed alot of people saying it was runny. I make this alot and I don't use the yogurt. Try making it with the CREAMY cream cheese instead, it helps with the texture!

My daughter and I enjoyed this fruit dip. I used Chobani Vanilla Greek yogurt and did not have any issues with having a runny dip. The recipe also worked perfectly with reduced fat cream cheese. I skipped the food coloring.

Great with the first strawberries of the season!  I didn't have vanilla so I used plain.  I found it a bit runny like some other reviewers did.  Added a little bit of instant vanilla pudding mix - problem solved!

This taste heavenly.  The only thing I left out was the food coloring.  Why would you want to add it anyway?  I wanted the consistency to be like Ruby Tuesday's on their cut up apples.  I didn't want it thick.  So I was happy with this.  Still might try a few other recipes for comparison.

the smell and texture of this dip were so unpleasant! Plus, the taste was nondescript.

Flavor was good but when I made it it turned out too runny to be a dip.

I don't know what I did wrong but this came out way too runny and was still clumpy.  My mother-in-law makes this minus the yogurt so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was very disappointed.  Next time I'll make it without the yogurt and see how it turns out.  Maybe I used too much yogurt (I didn't measure) and I also used Fat Free Cream Cheese.

This turned out soooo good. I made it for a work event, and everyone loved it . I saw that several people didn't like how thin it came out because of the yogurt. I used Greek-style yogurt, which is really thick. No problem with it being too runny.

Delicious! I like the little tart taste the yogurt gave it and how it thinned it out a bit. It wasn't too runny but if you like it thick then go light on the yogurt or don't use it at all. Either way it's  yummy!
