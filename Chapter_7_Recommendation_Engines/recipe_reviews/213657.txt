This recipe is so easy and good.  My family loves it. I also add cheese, diced onion and even have put a small piece of bacon on the top.   I also spray the foil with pam....

I have made this for years - on the grill!  It's such an easy way to make potatoes while the meat is grilling.  Add sliced onions!  Cook the packet until the potatoes are fork-tender, flipping them over once in awhile (if the foil packet is super-tight) to be sure they are getting evenly done.  I wouldn't use oregano, but only because I don't care for oregano.  Garlic/salt/pepper/butter is plenty.

Great recipe that's low in fat!  I did mine on the grill.  I sprayed the bottom of a foil packet with Pam to prevent the potatoes from sticking.  I left out the oregano (personal preference) and added some vidalia onion.  I used minced garlic vs. garlic powder.  There's nothing simpler and these go great with BBQ chicken.

A favorite in my family!  I do these a little different, I slice the potatoes into large slices, place a thin slice of onion in between each slice with a thin pat of butter, then I salt & pepper the entire thing.  Try a splash of Frank's Red Hot over the top - they're DELICIOUS!!  :)

we've been doing this on the grill for years--a couple of minutes in the microwave with the potatoes before you put them in the pouch saves a lot of time on the grill or in the oven.

I have been making these for years...good for camping too.  You can just throw them into the coals but dont forget to turn over.  Sometimes I add smoke sausage and onions to the mix.

I loved this recipe- got me a good start. Rather than the low fat version, I drizzled EVOO, and a couple tbsp of butter were thrown in the pack. I added fresh basil, oregano, and garlic as well.

Very simple; I do recommend one revierer's suggestion to microwave the potatoes for 3 minutes prior to grilling; this will allow them to be cooked in the time it takes to grill your chicken, or whatever meat of preference. I did not use any butter at all and didn't miss it. Just used the potatoes, some chopped red onion, bacon bits, kosher salt, pepper.

I have been making this for over 30 years, when camping, either on a grill or in the coals of an open fire. I add diced onion, cheese and often a egg, lightly stirred to each packet. My family love this quick easy recipe.
