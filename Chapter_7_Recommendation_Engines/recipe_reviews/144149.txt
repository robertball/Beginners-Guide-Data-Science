I have gotten so many raves about this salad...even from people who don't even like potato salad!   I found this amazing champagne vinegar at Trader Joes.  It's called Orange Muscat champagne vinegar and I think the citrus in it adds to the amazing blend of flavors.  I LOVED this recipe.  And it's really easy to make!   Thank you Christine!

This recipe is amazing... It's a light potato salad and the champagne vinegar with the gorgonzola and red onions are what really make this recipe wonderful!  I wouldn't change a thing!

Very tasty, but very vinegary.  Still, I love no-mayo potato salad.  I don't know where you can find "champagne vinegar" or even really what it is.  Just use less of a regular white wine vinegar.

I made this for a Fourth of July potluck and everyone loved it.  I did reduce the amount of onion- I feel like it would overpower the dish if you used the whole thing.  Be warned, though:  We didn't like the leftovers very well, so if you make it, eat it up that day!

Made this for our 4th of July picnic and everyone loved it! I got compliments all night! I made it with all the ingredients and didn't change anything. I made it the night before to let everything marinate in the dressing. It had a very refreshing flavor...a nice change from salads with mayo.

This potato salad was delicious! I couldn't find champagne vinegar so I used a german seasoned vinegar I had on hand. The flavor combination was terrific. Will likely be making this all summer. Thanks for a terrific recipe, Christine!

I thought this was delicious and got requests for the recipe.  I didn't buy the champagne vinegar because it was $12 a bottle at Safeway, so I used White wine vinegar instead.  I have to say, it tasted great!  I didn't think it was overpowering at all.  I had a little left over and it tasted even better the next day.  Would definitely make again and again....And now that I know I like, I'll probably invest in the champagne vinegar...

Only 3 stars from me.  We thought it was OK.  Better the second day.  We ate it, but won't make again.  The flavors just did not "marry" well for us.

Really really delicious.  I did leave out the apples - not a fan of fruit and food - but thought the flavor was yummy.  Did need more salt than I put on.  Next time I will salt the potatoes while they're still hot - I think that will help.  But, there will be a next time!!!!

I usually dislike potato salad, but this is delicious!  I use champagne vinagrette and it works well as the sauce.

I have never rated a recipe on this website . . . until now!  This is the BEST potato salad I have ever had.  Very different from your run of the mill mayo or mustard based recipes.  I used only half an onion since the onion flavor seems to get overpowering a day later and this made enough to enjoy leftovers tomorrow.  I also could not find champagne vinegar so I used white wine vinegar.  Can't wait to try it again with the champagne vinegar but it was top notch anyway!!!  Thanks, Christine!
