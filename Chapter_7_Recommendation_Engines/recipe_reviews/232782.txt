While I found #5 in the directions off putting (“Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters or spills with Chlorox Disinfecting Wipes), it wasn’t enough to dampen my enthusiasm for this recipe.  It is, of course, “only” a classic patty melt sandwich, but I was particularly intrigued by the steak sauce (I used A1) mixed into the meat.  It was just barely noticeable, and pleasantly so.  I could not bring myself to add the oregano.  The instruction to cook the onion over low heat for a good 20 minutes was important.  As the onions cooked down, caramelizing in their own sugars, they reduced into something smooth and richly flavored, a major contribution to the sandwich.  The step of melting the butter before spreading it on the bread wasn't necessary – softened butter works just fine!  Hubs likes neither rye bread nor Swiss cheese but agreed to tolerate this sandwich.  He “suffered” through it with some homemade Thousand Island dressing on the side – a nice complement I must say!  This sandwich, along with a bowl of “Winter Leek and Potato Soup,” also from this site, made for a delicious and satisfying meal.

Hardly have ever had patty melts before. Found it tasty and a refreshing change from a normal barbecued burger on a bun.  One thing I did change was using generic spray kitchen cleaner with bleach and wash rag to clean up instead of the clorox wipes ;)

Only 4 stars cuz of all my changes. Sorry, but this recipe deserves 10 stars!! These sammies were AWESOME!! First of all I used Johnsonville's Bratwurst & spicy Italian sausages in place of the hamburger. Excellent choice if I do say so myself:)If that's not proof enough, my 19 yo DS ate 2 of them!! I also used soy sauce in place of the steak sauce and left out the oregano cuz I had a blond moment and forgot. The cheese I used was habanero jack, full flavored w/o a lot of heat. Trust me, I am barely up to jalapeno status and this cheese is FAB! Rye bread along with pickles make this a Winner any night of the week!

The ground beef mixture made a good burger.  Pretty much just a standard patty melt, but we enjoyed it.

Good recipe, but i brown my bread slices on both sides of bread until lightly browned Then I add the cooked burger patty, cheese and onions and put back in pan to melt cheese and heat through.  I just like a crispier bread

I have been wanting to make this recipe for a while but I never had the pumpernickel or rye bread on hand. I finally decided to make my own bread using the perfect bread found on this site. (Caraway Rye bread by BramptonMommyof2). I was never a fan of steak sauce until I tried a store brand (Kroger's). It is a sweet and spicy type steak sauce which worked perfectly with this recipe. Using my thumb, I indented the center of each patty to help with even cooking and to keep its shape. The patties were wonderfully juicy and tasty. Putting it altogether with the spices, onions, Swiss cheese and freshly made rye bread was excellent. And I even had Clorox wipes on-hand to clean up my mess afterwards. Thanks Clorox, this is an outstanding sandwich!

What's better than a diner classic when the cold weather comes around? Made this classic sandwich using Johnsonville brand Sweet Italian Sausage. Substituted ketchup for the steak sauce and mayo on the bread for the butter. It was a crispy, crunchy, gooey, savory blend of goodness. Try this classic with sausage. It's a great update.

The sandwiches were good but a little dry,  maybe they needed the half TBL of steak sauce per burger, but I'm not fond of it. Never having made a patty melt before this is what I learned. The basic method of buttering your bread works just fine, no need to melt the butter first; use more onions than called for here; and make sure the cheese isn't thin sliced. I thought with the two slices it would be enough but it was barely noticeable. The onions were not enough moisture for me, I would use a sauce on the sandwich (not in the meat) next time. Maybe just some mustard, but something.
