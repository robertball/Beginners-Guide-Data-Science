A great recipe!  I used 35% cream because I needed to use it up, also added about 1/4 cup milk in addition to the milk called for.  I used half a cup shredded cheese & also subbed butter for the becel (ew margarine ick).  I also added salt. YUM!

This was OK; I liked the addition of the dijon but it just wasn't cheesy enough and needed salt.

I made this recipe last night to take with me to friends for dinner it was delicious. I used regular butter and whole milk and regular cheese. I was looking for a recipe like this where it didn't have  condensed soup for the sauce.  I also grounded salad Croutons instead of plain bread. Will def make this again.....maybe even try the lite version to cut back on fat.   I just want to mention that I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for 4 people.
