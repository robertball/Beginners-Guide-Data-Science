I was looking for a recipe to use the leftovers from the Original Chex Mix, and this fit the bill.  I used a 4-cup measure for the butter, brown sugar and corn syrup mixture and was glad I did, as the mixture rises while cooking.  This was cooked in an 1100-watt microwave for a total of five minutes, stopping once at 3 minutes to stir.  This was then poured over the Chex/pretzel/nut mixture and stirred to coat.  The mixture did not coat well.  If I make this again, I'll cook it for less time yet-possibly 4 or 4.5 minutes-to allow the mixtue to be thin enough to coat well.  I would also reduce the pretzels to one cup, as I felt the pretzel taste dominated the mixture.  This is a quick snack if you have the ingredients and need something fast.  It is a typical sweet/salty mixture, good but not great.

This was good, but I agree w/ Elle that the mixture is too thick/not enough to coat the cereal, pretzels and peanuts entirely. I used a combo of corn and rice Chex, as that is what I had on hand and mini pretzel twists that I broke up a bit. I halved the recipe just to try and it made a good amount. The kids are really enjoying it! I would make this again, but would maybe double the caramel mixture for a better coating. Thanks for sharing. :)

I doubled the sauce ingredients per previous reviews.  I also added 4 cups of Cgex cereal and 2 cups of a different for a variety.  I was out if nuts so I added in Peanut M&Ms. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Very addictive.

This is my new favorite Chex Mix! I doubled the wet ingredients and did 1.5 times the dry, and it was the perfect coating. I personally prefer using half wheat Chex and half rice or corn, as I think it gives some variety in the crunch factor. This will definitely be a staple in our house for parties and get-togethers.

i like it, i didn't make it more mixture at first, then put a little bit more corn syrup over the top with 1 min left in the final stage and added another minute then stirring while warm. used chex with granola. delicious, will make again and make more coating.
