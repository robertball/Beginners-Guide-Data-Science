Comfort food at it's best!  This dish is very hearty, easy to make, and keeps well in the fridge.  

I started with the refridgerated pie crusts, not the frozen, and cooked the bottom crust in my pie plate for about 10 minutes on 350 degrees.  This ensures no sog in the final product.  While this is baking I mixed all other ingredients together making the following substitutions:

(1) Use frozen mixed vegetables or peas/carrots mixture in lieu of the canned (fresher flavor).  Microwave them for half the time the instructions on the bag indicate to prepare them.

(2) Omit the milk and use 1 can of your favorite cream soup (I use chicken) and another can of the 98% fat free cream soup to cut calories (broccoli and mushroom work very well).

(3) Add additional spices to liven up the flavor: rosemary, poultry seasoning, salt & pepper, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  (The hot sauce will not overpower or overheat the dish!)

I followed the instructions on placing the top crust and baking as indicated in the original recipe and got an amazing result.  I've already made this twice and intend to keep making it for quick dinners and lunchtime on the go.

ENJOY!

I love this recipe!  I used a bag frozen mixed veggies instead of canned and added some Mrs. Dash Original Blend for seasoning.  It makes enough for two casseroles.  I usually cook the crust for awhile before adding the filling so the bottom doesn't get all gooey.  This is a great recipe to help you eat your veggies!

After reading reviews I revised the recipe a little and it turned out wonderful.  My family loved it and we will definately make it again.  Add frozen green beans, carrots, peas, diced new potatoes to the chicken.  Salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, and thyme to taste.  Add a small splash of tobasco (you can not taste the tobasco but it adds to the entire flavor).  Also use 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery in addition to the milk to make the mixture nice and creamy.  Bake for 1 hour to give the pie pastry a nice crispness.

This was one of the best chicken pot pies I've ever had!  As suggested by others, I: 1)used refrigerated pie crusts 2)cooked the bottom crust in pie plate for 10 mins at 350 degrees - *using a fork, poke several holes throughout so it doesn't puff up while baking  3)used frozen bag of mixed veggies - *I heated it up on the stove top before mixing it in with the other ingredients  4)used a can of cream of potato soup in place of the milk  5) brushed top crust with a beaten egg to give it a golden brown color  6)add'l seasonings added - garlic powder, salt and pepper  7)I used 2 chix breasts and poached it - cooked the chix in a pot of boiling chix broth for about 25 mins.  My family really enjoyed it, but the only thing we noticed was it was a bit on the dry side.  I think next time I'll also include the 1/2 cup of milk.  Good and easy recipe - thanks Tressie!!  I will sure make this again soon!

This is wonderful!I bought and used a whole cooked chicken for 2 pies, storebought deep dish pie crusts and  frozen peas and carrots which I cooked in the microwave. I took the advice of others and cooked the bottom shell for about 10-12 minutes @350 before filling. I used half the amount of milk recommended in the recipe, as I found without any it seemed dry. Also I added 1/2 teaspoon each of pepper, thyme and tarragon, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the entire mixture for the 2 pies. I brushed the top crusts with a beaten egg, poked holes in the tops then cooked them @400 for 30 minutes in pyrex pie plates I had lightly sprayed with oil. When they came out of the oven, they looked like they were from the pages of a magazine and my family just loved them. I will look no further for a pot pie recipe.

This recipe is a real winner! So easy to prepare. I also baked mine a little longer to get a nicely golden brown crust (about 15-20 minutes extra baking time). Next time I will try adding some potato to the filling. I was actually just making this for myself because my husband has always said that he doesn't like pot pie... he loved this one and had seconds. I'll remember this recipe for Thanksgiving Turkey leftovers too.

I gave it four stars instead of five because of the changes needed as suggested, but it is YUMMY!  I'm making this for Christmas dinner because it is so easy and can be made ahead.  I made the following changes as suggested by some:
1.  used refridgerated pie crust and baked bottom crust for 10 minutes, brushed with beaten egg
2. used one pound bag of frozen stew veggies that had potatoes and brocolli
3.  added 1 tsp. thyme, 1/2 tsp. tarragon, 1 tsp. pepper
Enjoy!

i made this for my family and friends and the friends are still begging for some more..I was impressed with how easy it was, I figured I'd mess something up somewhere, but it was perfect!
for the cream of chicken soup, I found some herbed cream of chicken and was kinda leary at first to try it, but went ahead and think that's what added the lil kick (and I used frozen veggies instead of canned...)

I thought this one was great.  I added some seasoned salt and pepper after reading some of the other reviews and baked the pie at 425 for 35 minutes.  I definitely will make it again. My husband whom has to have a big meal also enjoyed it, thought it was filling.

Delicious. I don't change a thing, other than the baking time because the crusts do not brown in 30 mins. Reviewers who are posting the details of all the changes, substitutions, and other things they added need to submit a new recipe because after all those changes they're no longer reviewing this recipe! Oh yea, I use the Campbell's Healthy Request cream of chicken, but do you really need to know that?

Awesome.  I love this pot pie, it's so quick so good, and so easy.  Gotta add some spices to it, though.  Then it's perfect.

This is a good recipe if you follow the suggestions here to add more spices and use frozen vegies... I also used Cream of Mushroom soup, added shake of basil, oregeno, thyme, and garlic salt.  It was very tasty, but not too stong. Lastly, good chicken pot pie is all about having great crust. I used the "French Pastry Pie Crust" recipe from this site cause it is the absolutely the best, very flakey. Worth the extra effort! Yum, i'm looking forward to making this again!  I posted a picture of the final product!

I use fresh veggies when I make this (steam them a little) and only one crust (inverted over the top) to make it a little healthier. I used up my leftover Sticky Rotisserie chicken tonight for a 2nd great dinner compliments of All Recipes!

5 stars because it is so easy and pretty tasty.  I used 2 chicken breasts, Campbell's cream of chicken soup with herbs, and needed to increase the cooking time by about 7 min.  In the future, I will probably be more selective about the veggies I put in it.  I grabbed  a can of store-brand mixed veggies, but they were too soft.  Perhaps next time I will do as other reviewers had and use frozen mixed veggies.  One reviewer said that this was enough for two pies, but I feel it was a perfect portion for one pie.  Will make again and again!

Added tarragon and garlic powder and used the refrigerated pie crusts and baked in a nine inch pan, not a pie plate.  It was very deep and crust was extra yummy!  I baked the bottom layer for ten minutes prior to filling.

I have made this recipe two times.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good.  The second time I used two cans of mixed veggies and 1 can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of potato.   Otherwise, I think, the pot pie has way too much chicken flavor. Delicious!

I found it needed a bit more zest, so toss in a few spices to suit your family.  I also opted another time to use instant(made)garlic mashed potatoes instead of a top crust, heaped on and sealing the juices, now I can ONLY cook it that way for my picky eaters who now beg for it!

I was surprised how tasty this dish is considering how few ingredients there are.  I used low fat cream of chicken and still thought it was great.  Talk about a perfect way to get rid of left over turkey too.

Very good, very simple to make!  However, please be sure to drain the can of vegetables.  It took almost twice as long to bake, also.

I went directly by the recipe except I added:

1/4 tsp dried sage
1/4 tsp dried marjoram
1/4 tsp dried coriander
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp fresh cracked black pepper
1/4 tsp salt

I had to bake mine a little longer to get the top to brown, but it turned out delicious!  I will make this again!

i give this 5 stars even with modifications/taking advice from others because it is so good, so easy and you can just customize how you want it. mixed together a can of cream of chix and a can of cream of potato along w/1/2 cup milk. then i used a small bag of italian frozen veggies and a small bag of frozen soup veggies because that one includes potato chunks. added seasoning salt, fresh ground pepper and a few shakes of tabasco. pre cooked crust and brushed it w/egg. made it once with canned chix out of pure laziness and time constraints, another two times with store-bought rotisserie chix cut up/shredded. either way, delicious. but it does take about 45 minutes to cook to a nice golden brown even after pre-cooking the bottom pie shell.

This recipe is super easy, I changed a few things based on reviews, here is what I did, and what I would do differently next time:   baked bottom crust (refrigerated pie crusts) 10 minutes at 350  1 can condensed cream of chicken soup 1 can condensed cream of celery soup 15+ ounces of mixed veggies (frozen) 2+ cups of chicken (pulled from rotisary chicken) 1/3 cup milk  1 teaspoon garlic powder salt & pepper to taste egg wash top crust  cook about 45 minutes at 350  Looked great - tasted a little dry like this - next time I will def do the full 1/2 cup of milk maybe even closer to a cup - I don't like my chicken pot pie soupey, but this was def too dry.    I will probably use canned veggies next time, probably bigger pieces of chicken too, but I think this is a great recipe for anyone trying to make their first chicken pot pie (this was mine and I think it was a success!!) Good luck!

My family loved this!  I added some chopped sauted onions and a shake or two of creole seasoning (we use Tony Chachere's on just about anything.)  Delicious and easy.

I made this recipe for a few of my friends and they all loved it.  It was very easy and quick to put together. I will make it over and over again.

Love how easy this is to make. I use cream of potato soup instead of chicken because I think the potato is more hearty. I also just get rotisserie chicken and use the leftovers for sandwiches. To cut back on fat, I only use a pie crust on top, but make sure to put a baking dish underneath to catch any "spillover"

for a quick and easy pot pie, this was good. I did bake the bottom crust for 10 minutes before adding everything to make sure it was crusty and added a few extra spices to jazz it up, but other than that, made as is. I typically prefer and more "homemade" pot pie with fresh veggies and a butter/flour roux, but on a busy evening when you need something quick and hearty, this was great!

I thought this was very good. I did cook the crust for 10 minutes to firm it up. I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat, gave an extra kick. I only give it 4 stars because when I asked my kids if they liked it, my youngest responded "I liked the chicken and the crust, but not everything else"  I still couldn't hide those veggies from them!!

So simple to make and quite delicious to eat.  I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts, a bag of frozen mixed veggies along with one box of frozen pearl onions in sauce, both thawed.  Two cans of cream of chicken soup added to the chicken and veggies made it quite creamy.  Who doesn't like pot pie?

Easy and delicious! My family finished this pot pie within minutes and then asked me if I could make it again the next night! The only difficulty I had was with the bake time; the crust was still soft and white after the suggested period, so I left it in the oven for approx. another 15-20 minues (maybe it's just my oven).

My husband ate 1/2 the pot pie himself!  I made it exactly according to original instructions except for adding a few spices to the filling (per contributor Jaden:  "Also I added 1/2 teaspoon each of pepper, thyme and tarragon, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the entire mixture."). These spices made it very savory and yummy.  I am fairly certain it would have been a bit bland without them.  I let the pot pie sit for about 5-10 minutes after removing from the oven and the filling was just right, not dry or runny.  An easy, tasty recipe I will certainly make again.

A nicely simple concept and easily altered to taste. I prefer less carrots and peas, so I put in frozen broccoli and cauliflower instead. Also I love Cream of Celery soup so I combined half a can of that with the Cream of Chicken soup. I mixed all that together in a bowl and added a healthy dose of black pepper. It's fabulous and easy to make. Also, I shred my chicken instead of dicing it. Makes it smoother to mix with the soup.

OMGoodness! this was the best tasting pot pie I have ever had. When I cooked my chicken, I seasoned it with celery salt and I used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. This was a quick and very easy recipe. I didn't need to change the recipe at all!! It was LOVED by all..even my 15 month old son!!

Delicious!  I like to add a can of cream of mushrooms soup and a can of mushrooms also. Then it yields 2 deep dish pies!  it was a hit  at my church potluck dinner!  I multiplied the recipe and easily fed 100 church members. Many of whom asked me for the recipe!  :)

GREAT!
I did make a few changes though, just to add more flavor... I took others advice and used another can of cream soup in place of the milk. I used one can of cream of chicken, and one can of cream of chicken with mushroom. I also seasoned the chicken with season salt, and pepper to add more flavor. Frozen veg instead of canned, and added more veg variety (potatoes, broccoli, carrots, peas, bell peppers).

My husband who doesn't like potpie said that this was a keeper!

The best pot pie ever! I cooked my chicken on the grill with onion salt, white pepper and garlic,precooked the bottom shell for 10 minutes and reduced the milk to half of what the recipe called for. A fantastic dinner a new family favorite, thank you for this recipe.

A super easy recipe and it's fantastic!  I just used what I had in my refrigerator.  I chopped up carrots, celery, fresh green beans and 1/2 an onion and cooked them until they were just starting to get soft in a sauce pan.  I added rosemary, garlic powder, thyme, salt and pepper and added the chicken which I seasoned with a chicken seasoning blend.  I then mixed it with 99% fat free cream of chicken soup and a 1/4 c of skim.  It turned out great.  I wouldn't change a thing next time.

This was a great chicken pie recipe, although I varied the ingredients also.  I used most of a 16-oz package of Knorr Rustic Vegetable & Potato soup (healthy and delicious!) and skipped the milk.  I also used about 2 cups of chopped broccoli florets (uncooked) instead of the canned veggies.  Added some cayenne and black pepper.  As others mentioned, I baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling.  I found the pie took 45 minutes, rather than 30.  The leftovers were great the next day - yum!  I'm thinking about making it again already!

I made this for the family that I cook for, and they all loved it! I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of potato soup. The steam-in-the-bag frozen vegetables make this even quicker to prepare. Just microwave them while you're prepping the rest, then stir them in. For seasoning, I used about a teaspoon of Montreal chicken seasoning, which adds just the right amount of flavor. Thanks for a keeper!

I love this dish! I use Marie Callender pie crusts and sub cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken. I also use canned peas and carrots instead of mixed veggies...it tastes better to me. Anyway, my son (3) talks about making chicken pot pie all the time! A favorite at my house.

This was absolutely WONDERFUL.  My family enjoyed it very much.  I read several reviews that stated that it was bland, so I added a salt-free herb mix seasoning.  This dish made for very good comfort food.  Thinking about maybe making some up and freezing (prior to cooking) for those last minute emergency meals. ;)

I have made a few changes to this basic recipe that may interest a few readers.  I parboiled some cut up baby carrots with one cut up small potato.  I wanted a recipe suitable for two people so I used two corning "grab handle" dishes.
I combined a small diced onion and a couple of sliced fresh mushrooms, sauteed in about a tablespoon of butter. I then combined all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl with the the left over chicken, the parboiled vegetables, sauteed onions and mushrooms, the soup and milk.  Added a couple of tablespoons of frozen peas and about a teaspon of dried mixed spices. Divided the mixture between the two dishes and covered each "grab handle" with some rolled out puff pastry from a box that I keep in my freezer.  Baked in the oven at 350 degrees for one half an hour, and, you will have a recipe to die for!  A little more work than using frozen vegetables but to my husband and I, well worth the effort!

This was so easy to make,if your short on time this is great! My family loves pot pies, so I decided to look one up & saw this one. Gave it a try & It was a hit! I have made it twice now. I have a family of 7 so I made 2 pies & had a little less then 1/2 of a pie left. I think this would be a great thing to freeze & when your really short on time pop it in the oven. This will be great for us during baseball season, Quick & Easy! Thanks Tressie ;o)

I did have to add some spice to mine. Once I tried salt, pepper, and garlic powder, but it's better with Tony's Creole Seasoning. If you use the Pillsbury crust that you roll out, cooking time takes about 20 minutes longer.

This was a great recipe!  It was very easy to make, and took very little time to prepare.  In addition to the canned mixed veggies, I added some cubed red potatoes which made the pie a bit more substantial.  The pot pies made with bisquick or jiffy baking mix are just as quick and easy to make, but I would choose this over over those recipes any day!  It's just so nice to have a pie with a nice flaky buttery crust.  :)

I have used this recipe many times and it is always a hit.  It's easy to make when you're in a rush and very tasty.  There are only two things I change.  First, I use frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned as I'm just not a big fan of canned veggies.  Second, I have found that adding a bit of chicken broth really makes it flavorful, plus most recipes I've tried tend to be a little dry.  For my personal taste, I add between 1/4 and 1/2 have cup of chicken broth while mixing the other ingredients

This recipe was easy and a favorite at our house. I used frozen veggies instead because I don't like canned veggies that much. I did have to cook it a lot longer than suggested so the top was flaky and brown. I will make this again!

Here's an interesting thing to do with the top crust.  Make the bottom of the recipe as directed, keeping the top crust frozen.  Pop it out of the pan it comes in, crumble it up quickly (not too fine), and mix with some shredded cheese.  Sprinkle the crust/cheese crumble on top and bake.
Its good, and really different.

I made this recipe after Thanksgiving 2012, using leftovr turkey. I used half a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great. I used refrigerated pie crust, two of them. I did not bake the bottom crust for 10 min. as some suggested, and next time, I will do this, to keep it from getting soggy. I brushed beaten egg over the top crust halfway thru baking, and boy did it look professional. This would also be a good way to use leftover cooked chicken from chicken soup. I use a small whole chicken for soup and always have too much meat left.

This is a good solid recipe that is forgiving of minor tweaks. These are the changes I made:
- prebaked the crust for about 10 minutes first to avoid sogginess
- used less chicken, about 1.5 cups instead (2 seemed like it was too much)
- added herbs to the soup-milk mixture
- used a combo of canned and frozen veggies
- didn't have a second pie crust, so used refrigerated biscuits instead.
I will say that I thought the 1/2 of milk would be too much, and make it too liquidy, but that was not the case - in my opinion, consistency was perfect.

As I sit here eating the leftovers for lunch I can honestly say that this recipe is absolutely AMAZING!...with a few things to make it my own.  My fiance loves this...and this is not the kind of thing he would normally eat.  I use 2 frozen pie crusts, 2.5 cups of frozen mixed vegetables (boiled 5 minutes), 5-6 small pieces of frozen boneless/skinless chicken (boiled), 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cream of cheese soup (fiance's request...which I was a little hesitant about...but was a great addition!), onion powder, garlic powder, 1/2 tsp thyme (can be overpowering if add more), poultry seasoning, splash of italian seasoning, and shredded cheese to sprinkle on top.  I use little heart shapped cookie cutters (corny but "cute" so my fiance says)to cut out in top shell and then place the cut outs slightly over their holes to allow for the steam to escape.  I brush egg on the bottom shell and the top shell to help brown and crisp, cover edges with foil for first 30 minutes of cooking at 400 degrees and remove foil to cook for another 30 minutes..and it's PERFECT!  Probably my favorite recipe on here so far!!

So awesome and so easy. Prefer this over the one we get at Bob Evans. I think it is great just the way it is. Made it the other night and everyone just had to have it last night. The only meat I had readily available was some shredded beef I had left over from making B-B-Q.  Threw it in in place of the chicken and turned out great. Either way, its a hit. Thanks for posting it.

This was a very simple and tasty recipe. It was a bit bland, but that could be fixed by adding some seasonings. I gave it 4 stars because of the ease of making it.

I made a few of the suggested changes, including used an herbed cream of chicken soup, a cream of potato soup, and the milk. I also had to substitute corn & diced potatoes for the more traditional pot pie fillings b/c of husband's taste preferences. This is fantastic...and so easy to make I'll make it again.

I had some left over chicken and always wanted to try a pot pie.  This one was great!  Simple and easy ingredients.  Fairly easy to prepare.  I used some of the other suggestions and was really happy with it.  Hubby AND picky 5 year old loved it and asked for more!  I scored on this one!  Thanks!

I made this using some of the suggestions by others and my family LOVED it!  They couldn't get enough.  I precooked the pie crust with an egg wash.  I added some sauteed onion, hot sauce, pepper, garlic powder, and made sure the chicken was well seasoned when I cooked it. I used instant herb potatoes for the top crust.  I cooked it approx. 45 mins to a perfect brown. If you are feeding more than 4 I suggest 2 pies.  Heck, 2 pies is a good idea no matter what. The leftovers were gone before I got home from work the next day.

This was a quick and easy meal! I pre-baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes before adding ingredients, and used a can of cream of potato soup instead of milk, and the consistency was perfect! Not too runny or soft. I did have to kick it up a notch, as there was not much flavor in the soups, so I added salt and pepper to taste. Yum!

This recipe is the BOMB!  Add two cans of the chunk chicken if using a deep dish pie pan!  We LOVE this EASY quick dinner!  Can also use canned beef stew for a Beef Pot Pie (I use TWO cans with my deep dish pie pan).  AWESOME!

My husband was not too sure if he'd like this cause the only pot pie he'd ever had was the frozen kind :P  I did tweak this a bit to kick up the flavor, and followed the suggestion to bake the bottom crust to reduce soggyness.  In all I added about 3 cloves finely minced garlic, 1/2 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp black pepper, and one onion cut up along with the canned veggies and chicken soup.  It took about 20 minutes longer than anticipated to bake, but the result was FANTASTIC! My husband absolutly loved it and I think next time I make it I'll at a little cheddar cheese in with the veggies and soup!

The only thing I did differently was to add potatoes. Also, I made one without any veggies for my husband. I served this to my family and luckily I made two because it was all gone. I will use this again.

EXCELLENT!  The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was seasoned the mix with salt and pepper, Season All, garlic salt, and onion powder.  DELICIOUS!

I made this for dinner and my husband had three helpings and cleaned his plate!  He was even oohing and ahhing!  Seriously.  Can you believe that? I really liked it too.  I used one of those long red packages of refrigerated Pillsbury double-crust pre-rolled pie crusts.  All I had to do was unroll them over my pie plate.  I didn't use milk because I was worried it would make it too liquidy, and I'm glad I didn't; it was a little too soupy but that's probably my fault because I cut & served it immediately whereas I should have let it stand to solidify 10 minutes or so.  I also added a few pinches of salt.  I cut pretty shapes out of the top for steam vents.  Next time I make it I will practice making the top crust more... uniform, as it was kind of lopsided (hey, what can I say, it was my first time).  So yeah, excellent recipe, basically fool-proof.  Delicious.  Thank you!

Very good. I made the following changes the second time: I used cream of potato soup instead, and skipped the milk, and added garlic and pepper. it made it nice and thick, the wedges stayed together nicely. Very easy recipe!

We give this recipe 10 stars ^_^

My husband and I just finished preparing this recipe and OMG this was the best pot pie we've tasted!! We used individual mini pie pans, refrigerated pie crust, special seasonings (thyme, garlic, salt, pepper, basil and parsley) baked potato, celery, peas, onion and cream of chicken with herb soup. We sautéed the chicken, vegetables and seasonings; pre-cooked the bottom crust for 10 minutes and also brushed the top crust with egg. Unbelievable meal; no more store brought pot-pies for us!!!

This is a great comfort meal recipe that my husband and I both enjoyed. The only change I made was to steam frozen seasoned mixed veggies rather than plain canned ones.

YUMMY! This was delicious and so easy. I used frozen mixed veggies. My husband said it was one of the best things he's ever eaten! I did bake the bottom crust for 10 min. @ 350 before adding the mix, and then I brushed egg on the top crust (read ideas in reviews). Did I say this was really yummy? My picky toddler liked it, too!!  Thank you!!

I used frozen vegetables, added a can of diced potatoes, some thyme & oregano, and substituted a can of cream of chicken instead of the milk. It was delicious. I've made it several times to rave reviews every time. This also freezes well.

I never would have thought to use cream of chicken soup.  I was going to make gravy out of stock.  Thank you for making this yummy pie so easy and delicious.  We loved it and I will make it again.

We thought this recipe was very good.  I added a can of cream of celery soup as well, and some leftover canned peas that I had.  It was very good.  Without the extra cream of celery soup, I think it may be a little dry.  (I baked mine for a little longer as well).  No leftovers.. the family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I pre-cooked the bottom crust for 5-10 minutes, used thawed frozen veggies plus cut up canned new potatoes.  Hearty & delicious- thanks!

Very good! This was the first time we've had a homemade pot pie. I love that it was so easy to make. I used a package of Perdue ShortCuts chicken breast, and added a little extra cream of chicken soup and milk cause I like the filling to be really creamy. Also added Mrs. Dash per the suggestion from a previous review. I had to cook 10 minutes more in my oven to get the top done and will probably cook the bottom pie crust a little bit by itself first next time, as someone else suggested, to make it crisper.

This turned out really well, a great way to use up leftovers.  I cut the recipe in half for two people, and it was the perfect amount.  I used leftover canned corn and peas, along with fresh shredded carrots, for the filling, which worked out well.  I like another reviewers idea of adding fresh mushrooms, and including some minced onion or black pepper would be a nice touch.  Great winter meal, and very easy to make.  And very attractive looking if you leave them in until the tops brown!

I love lots of meat so I use 2 chicken breasts rather then the 2 cups. I also use a 5.5 inch pie plate rather then the 9 inch. the 5.5 is better for a single serving .I rub some flour around the pie plate before putting in the pie crust. I cook  it for 60 min. then let stand for 5 min. before serving. it's like the store bought has a small circle of doughy crust in the middle. no bigger then a quarter.

I did change a bit. I slow roasted the chicken, seasoned with poultry seasoning and garlic powder, with white wine in bottom of baking dish and covered with foil. I roasted extra and froze a couple of cups of shredded chicken to make this a second time. I also used frozen veggies, thawed and drained. Finally, I baked the bottom shell for 10 minutes or so before filling, and baked the whole pie around 45 minutes. Very tasty, and satisfying with a salad on the side. My husband also loved the leftovers!

Made it with canned veggies and cream of chicken and milk. Made the pie crust myself with  (1 1/2 cup flour 2/3 cup of Crisco, 1 tsp salt and 4-5 tbsp cold ice water.... split dough in two parts (1 top 1 bottom) for 9 inch pie. I also added a little chicken in middle and chicken feet. The kids loved it! Will most likely put a few more spices in it next time and fresh vegetables as it was on the bland side. Overall it turned out I  very well!

Great recipe, for a much more savory flavor, use the Heinz chicken gravy in the jar instead of cream of chicken.

Love it!  I put the chicken and soup in the crock pot all day, with about an hour left I shred the chicken, then add the frozen veggies and milk.  Cooking the bottom crust at 350 for 10 minutes is a great idea, even if using thawed frozen crusts- a hit every time and gets everyone to eat vegetables!!

I made this for dinner tonight, I used pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts so I had to cook it a little longer and warmer. I also used a bag of frozen steam fresh mixed vegetables instead of a can so I steamed them in the microwave beforehand. It's turned out delicious! Super easy and yummy!

I made a deep fish pie - so added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and only 3/4 cup of milk. But found it to be too runny. Delicious but runny...maybe I should add 1/4 c of flour next time?

This is a great fast recipe.  Although I took the extra 10 minutes to chop and cook fresh veggies And sauté them.  I also added some thyme, fresh garlic and oregano to taste.   DELICIOUS!   Made it all and ready to serve in less than one hour!   And the last 30 minutes was just baking in the oven.  It's nice beaches enough could easily make two pies if you are having company and its plenty of food!    YUUUUM!

Very good flavor! My wife, who is very picky, liked it! Followed the tips and changed canned to bagged veggies, added diced whole potatoes, added some onion powder, garlic powder and Thyme, and a can of cream of celery. Then I mixed the veggies in frozen, not thawed, brushed the top with butter and cooked for 55 minutes at 350 degrees (just when it started bubbling on top). Top and bottom crusts cooked perfectly. Just a note; the added potatoes and canned soup make this one thick pie! Be prepared for leftovers!

Very simple to make.  I added a little garlic powder to the chicken and used rolled pie crusts rather than frozen.  So delicious!

Very good! I used two cans of cream of chicken soup one can had herbs in it, I added thyme and basil and only have a cup of milk. I baked the bottom crusted for ten minutes and brushed the top with an egg. Next time I will probably sautéed onion and garlic first then add to the mixture.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was really good. I did take the other reviewers advice and baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes prior to putting everything else in. My girls gave it a thumbs up, which is great considering how finicky my youngest is.

great! I've been making this on my own for a while now. The only things I really do differently is that I bread the chicken (just dipping in egg and either rolling in italian bread crumbs or bisquick) and lightly fry it in olive oil. It just makes the chicken so much tastier and enhances the whole pie with little effort. Also, use the healthy choice cream of chicken- it greatly reduces the unhealthy factor and I just hate how salty the regular is. Then I'll season (or not) to taste!

Very easy to make, made with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Added an extra can of cream of celery along with cream of chicken. Didn't change amount of milk (1/2 cup, added a dash of salt. Thawed top crust in fridge for about 30 min. (crust came right off, no hassel). Baked bottom crust for 10 min. before filling, like others suggested. Baked for 55 minutes. Thank you for recipe. :)

Mmmm...comfort food!  I use two cans of cream of potato soup, frozen veggies and use refrigerated pie crusts instead of frozen.  Add a little garlic powder, celery salt, chicken bullion and a dash of sriracha and Wha-La...the world's most perfectest chicken pot pie!

Not the Best I have ever had but certanly the EASIEST!! All in all it was quite good, did I mention EASY!?!?! WOW!! The only thing I did differently was poach the chicken beforehand in chicken stock, crushed red pepper flake, salt, pepper and garlic. It added to the all over flavor and kept the chicken juicy. Next time I think I will use dark meat for more flavor in the future. All in all GREAT QUICK little dinner served with salad. OH and to the past reviewers complaining that the botton crust didnt bake, heres a little trick for you. While the over is heating place a cookie sheet in the oven (the darker the better) this will not only catch any drippings from the pie but also help cook the bottom faster! Use this with ANY pie recipie!

This recipe is pretty fool-proof and it will taste like it was harder to make than it really was! I like to use cream of celery soup or just add some sauteed celery to mine.

I have never made a pot pie but i'm glad i did. My family is so very in love with this and it is easy. I did precook the bottom crust for 10 min. before adding the veggies. For veggies i added the following: potatoes carrots frozen peas sometimes mushrooms This recipe makes enough for two pies. These are the changes i made to recipe: egg wash over the top of crust onion and garlic powder also some pepper to the mixture Trust me, you'll love this recipe ;)

Loved this recipe!  Like others, I added a few spices like salt, pepper, tobasco sauce and garlic powder to liven up the taste.  Great base recipe, thanks Tressie.  You hit a home run here.

It's a great start for a tasty pot pie. As with any recipe I try, I had to make it my own with a few simple changes. I prefer to use the rolled refridgerated  pie crust for a better presentation. I also added a pinch of celery seed, salt, pepper, 2/3 cup shredded cheese, 1 cup cooked diced red potato, 1tbsp butter,(because in the "South", butter and salt make every thing taste better) and last of all substituted the canned mixed veggies for frozen. I will be making this again.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and so good. I boil chicken on the bone and shred that instead of using boneless chicken breast. I also used frozen veggies.  Next time I make it I will probably add some poultry seasoning as others suggested. Thanks for the recipe! I've passed this on to many others.

Delicious! I followed these suggestions: -bake bottom crust for 10 minutes to prevent sog -microwave veggies in bag for 1/2 the alloted time before mixing them in with other ingredients -instead of using a hot sauce (which I had none of) I used a lot of Mrs. Dash (probably 1.5 T.) then about 1 t. of Cayenne Pepper. It wasn't spicey, just perfectly flavored!!

I have to say this recipe WAS delicious.  When I took it out of the oven it wasn't as creamy as I had hoped, very soupy.  Next time I make it I might add a little less milk or another can of soup instead.  Everyone enjoyed it, even my picky husband so this dish will be made again.  It was very easy to!!

This was one of the EASIEST recipes I have made in quite some time. It is definitely a keeper. I read the reviews and made just slight modifications. I used frozen vegetables instead of canned. I also tend to cook chicken in batches and cube it, so I also used frozen diced chicken. I cut out the milk and used 2 cans of cream soup. 1 Cream of Chicken with Herbs, and 1 98% Fat Free Cream of Celery. I did use the frozen, deep dish pie crusts, thawed. I did not add any extra seasoning, though I probably will next time. This makes a LOT of filling. Next time, since I'm using frozen ingredients, I would probably nuke the filling in the microwave a little bit, since it took over an hour to cook. However it still came out wonderfully. I used frozen carrots, green beans and a sweet corn mixture. The sweet corn really added a nice flavor in and of itself. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I used refridgerated pie crusts, frozen veggies, and some pepper. Those are the only changes. It was soooo good. I may play with the seasonings next time, but great as is. I also baked it in a square stone. I think it's easier to serve that way. Also baked the bottom crust 10 min, then put it together and baked the whole thing 30 min and then put it under the broiler for 5 min or so to brown the top.

Great recipe and really easy to do.  I pre-cooked the bottom for 10 minutes as others had done.  Also, I added some poultry seasoning and some salt and pepper.  Mine was not brown enough on top, even after 40 minutes of cooking at 350 degrees, so I set the oven on broil to brown the top.  Make sure you stay by the oven if you do that because it browns very fast on broil.

This was great!  I did modify it slightly.  Instead of using a can of veggies, I used a 16 ounce bag of frozen veggies (peas, carrots, beans...).  I also used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup.  I used about 3/4 of a can.  I also added about 1/2 of a can cream of potato soup.  I used skim milk, not 2%.  I used 1.5 lbs. of chicken.  Everyone raved about the end product!

This is a base recipe. Another recipe should probably be posted with all the changes you have to make to it to make it 5 stars. At others suggestions, I made this with changes and it was delicious and now a favorite!
-Used refrigerated pie crust and baked bottom for 10 min pricking sides and bottom first.
-Used one can of cream of potato
-Used one can of cream of mushrm/chicken
-1/4 c milk
-Used frozed veggies-micro'd them for 1/2 suggested time before adding them to pie
-Added basil, oregano, thyme, garlic powder and onion salt

I baked it according to directions on recipe and it came out perfect! Oh...and filling was enough to make 2 of them.

This is an okay starter recipe. But, it needs some spices to make it shine. Sometimes I add tarragon, other times I add a garlic herb blend. At the very minimum this needs a good dusting of pepper to bring out the flavors.

My family loved this recipe. It's a great way to use left over rotisserie chicken, which often is thrown away after a while in my house.It's so easy that I've been making  2 or 3 at at time and freezing the extra pies for future quick dinners. We loved it!

This is FANTASTIC & SO easy! I took other's ideas by adding 1 can of cream of potato soup & canned veggies we like, plus omitted milk & added 1/2c. cheese. The only things I did differently were I used 1 can of cream of mushroom/chicken soup instead of plain, sprinkled in onion & garlic powder. After pouring filling into bottom crust, I dotted with butter & then covered w/top crust. I'm "domestically challenged" & thanks for allowing me to "feel like a cook"! :o)

This is a great way to get my family to eat their vegetables! My picky 3 year old finished a whole serving for once! I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and cooked exactly per directions, adding pepper, poultry seasoning and a bit of rosemary.

This is a great recipe! I made a couple changes though, which made it perfect. Instead of the canned veggies I used the frozen steam-in-the-bag variety and after reading everyones comments about the milk, tried using a can of cream of potato instead. The extra soup added some more creaminess without being watery and potatoes without having to cook them myself.

I used frozen veggies instead of canned and added 1/4 teaspoon of poultry seasoning to the soup.  If we're really in a hurry I use only a top crust and crank up the oven to 425 - done in less than 20 minutes!

This recipe is a good base recipe, that you can make your own changes to. I used frozen vegi's and cooked them a little on the stove. I seasoned them with onion powder, pepper, parsley, Adobo and a little butter. I also added diced new potatoes and used Oscar Meyer pre cooked diced chicken to save time. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and a little milk. And I did use frozen Marie Calenders crust. And baked it at 400 for 40 minutes. My family thought it was great and everyone ate it well.

About the same quality as frozen.  It IS easy, but it's not that great.  I'd give it a 2.5 if that were possible.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  It was very good and enjoyed by my kids as well.  I cubed and fried 2 chicken breasts in a little oil, using seasoning salt and pepper.  I didn't add an extra can of soup like the other reviewers did and I found it to be creamy enough.  I also used frozen veggies as our family does not care for the canned.  The cooking time was perfect.  Make sure to let the pie stand before cutting.  Thanks for the great recipe Tressie.

So flexible and easy!! I used my own homemade pie crusts, and thawed frozen veggies instead, and it was amazing!

This recipe is not only super easy but it's delicious!!!  A friend of mine who I passed it along to used to make all these ingredients by scratch and even she says it's better than that!!  Just be sure to bake it at 400 degrees otherwise, for me, the bottom of the crust was still very doughy.

Very good.  The 1/2 cup of milk this recipe calls for makes it creamier than other recipes.  I have two ladies at church who actually call me when they feel under the weather so I can bring this to them!

This recipe is bland, bland, bland and way too pre-packaged/processed for my taste. To anyone wanting to try this recipe I suggest adding some fresh or dried thyme and plenty of freshly ground black pepper to liven it up a bit.

This recipe was great! My husband really enjoyed it and so did I. Since some of the ratings said it was kindof bland, I added 1/4 tsp. pepper, thyme, and parsley, which I think gave it a lot of flavor. Also, instead of using frozen pie crust I made it from scratch, which wasn't too hard, but yummy! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This one always turns out great!  I like to use a peas and carrots blend in this, and often I will also put in canned potatoes to make this extra hearty! I also sometimes substitute condensed cheddar cheese soup if I'm in a "cheesy" mood.

My husband really enjoyed this pot pie. He was impressed with how much filling there was compared to the store bought frozen pot pies which are mostly made of just crust.  I did cook the bottom of the crust first and I used frozen vegetables instead of canned(I cooked the frozen vegetables for half their cooking time)  I did use too much milk and next time I think I am going to try 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of milk.  I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and garlic to add to the flavor.  Looking foward to making this easy but tasty pot pie again

This is a great basic recipe.  Very quick and easy.  I add about a tsp of garlic powder and a quarter tsp of marjoram for a little more flavor. I also add an extra can of veggies and use little more milk to compensate.

I made this for my boyfriend last night and you would have thought I fed him steak and lobster!  He absolutely loved it!(so did I) I followed the recipe for the most part--I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs, added a handful of shredded cheese, and cooked the chicken on the grill with some Adobo seasoning. When I was making the filling, I thought it was a little dry so I added 1/2 can of cream of celery soup (didn't have any more cream of chicken).  I did pre-bake the bottome crust like others suggested and I brushed the top crust with some egg to make it that golden color.  My boyfriend told me that I wasn't to change a single thing from what I did and he definitely wants it again!
Thanks Tressie for a great recipe!

This was a good recipe.  I added some extra seasoning, about a 1/2 c V8, and I just used canned biscuits on top instead of a pie shell.  I also used frozen veggies.

I liked this easy recipe especially for kids!  Instead of a pie shell I used puffed pasteries...the kids like to watch them rise while I heat the mixture on the stovetop.I used frozen peas, carrots, and corn. I then put a "suprise" the bottom of the pasteries, fill and put the top on...Plastic cows, babies, etc...careful with very young ones..but my kids love the hunt for the prize!

Well I cheated a little on this one.  Because I was making this for my homebound in-laws, I had to be very conscious of the salt content.  So, I used frozen veggies instead of canned, and the low-sodium version of the canned cream of chicken soup.  The result was still wonderful, and my in-laws thought I was a gourmet chef!  Thanks, Tressie!

Used this recipe for basics. Didn't want to use canned soup due to sodium. Used broth from bones from Costco rotisserie chicken. Not sure my sodium was less than 920. Thought gravy was too thin and added potatoe starch, then it got too gooey. Added liquid and it looked fine. Had way too much filling for standard pie crusts which were thawed. Ran to the store and bought deep dish crusts which were frozen. While the crusts were thawing, I noticed the filling looked rather thick. I thinned it out again and filled the pie crusts when I realized I forgot to preheat the oven. It was already close to 10 pm and the kids were hungry. I ordered pizza delivery. Kids were in bed and I thought about what went wrong. Then it came to me-- I didn't follow the recipe. Next time, I will.

It was a hit at my house! The recipe calls for a can of mixed veggies, so I diced half a can of potatoes and mixed with half a can of peas and carrots to make one can of veggies. It was delicious.

This was delish! We used frozen veggies instead of canned, which was nuked with a little bit of water for 3 minutes, then we mixed everything else in it. We shredded a pint of my home canned hot pack chicken and anyway...wow. Soo good!

This is my extract  recipe I use but I Sauté 1/4 cup onions And 1/4 cup butter before I add all the rest of the ingredients gives it more flavor I also boil my chicken breast  then shred it so it’s more moist and when I put pie crust on top before putting in oven I melt butter in a cup and brush the top of the pie crust before I put in oven so it’s flaky and crispy and buttery  when I take it out and not dry ??

I added some oregano, thyme parsley, salt & pepper. I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving dinner which helped as well. I will definitely make it again and tweak it some more!

It's DELICIOUS!!!.. but I will probably do as some other reviewers have.. and pte bake the pie shell...omit milk...My pie fell apart...once the pie cooled for awhile its was better but still I don't want to wait to eat dinner after I've just spent time making it!., Pie needs to be more solid for presentation and be ready to eat without becoming a mess.

The most important thing in using recipes is to read the reviews They are most helpful and can save a lot of time and money.   I used frozen veggies and deep dish pie crusts. Its important to saute onions and cook veggies and  chicken separate. One trick I have learned is to under cook the pies crust and cover the edges with aluminum foil. Remove during last five minutes. I also found using Alfredo sauce for base with sherry or wine to taste. This adds a great favor.

Excellent and easy,This is the second time I have made this, I changed a few things this time around, I used what I had available, and turned it into a pork pot pie, First I cleaned diced a small pork roast I had  in my freezer seasoned it with pepper and pink salt and cooked in a skilled until it was fully cooked, I removed it and drained the oil and put it in the veg mixture, in the same pan I saute'd half a diced yellow onion until soft and added it to the bowl of filling, then, instead of Condensed cream of chicken, I used condensed cream of mushroom and cream of celery, 
mixed well and poured it into the prepared pie shell and covered the top crust with an egg wash,  ( I love the way an egg wash makes the pot pie crust look.) 
Your recipe is turning out to be a great "base" to start from when making different varieties of Pot Pie. Thanks for it!!

So good and so easy! Slight modifications: bag of frozen veggies instead of canned. Added onions when I cooked the chicken as well as rosemary, thyme, and garlic powder. Used a can of cream of celery in place of milk. Threw in some hot sauce which added a nice flavor (no spice at all) I also highly recommend putting the bottom crust in the oven for about ten minutes before filling just so it doesn't get soft and soggy! (Poke some holes to keep it from bubbling up) We will definitely be making this again!

This is a great dish.  I did substitute some ingredients only because it was on hand.  I used 2 cans of cream of potato soup with the 1/2 cup milk.  I also added some hot sauce as others suggested.  It turned out great.  Will be using often as we love pot pies and this taste much better.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I had to modify this recipe.  I used 2 - 10 ounce cans of white chicken and 1 - 21 ounce can of Veg-all vegetables.  It was kind of  bland, but very filling.  I will make it again!

I used 2 cans of soup, skipped the milk and added 2 baked potatoes cubed. I also bake the bottom crust before filling as others have said. 
The great thing about this recipe is you can put in any seasonings you like - pepper, bell peppers, seasoned salt, garlic powder - and it comes out tasting the way you want.

So easy and good.  I used the low sodium soup but I like the taste of fresh celery, onion and carrot sauteed then added the frozen peas and corn to  the soup.  But Tressie needs a better photo. :)

just made this for super, with the creamy blueberry pie for desert, but we are so full we are saving it for tonight with TV.  But the chicken pot pie is awesome, I added tiny cubed potatoes, I browned them with the meat and onion.  Great  recipes, with left overs.

Very simple to make and to add your on flare. I added potatoes and a little cheese. I also used a hot and ready whole chicken from a local store. Made this dinner super quick. Will be making this again.

5 stars after changes....I don't really care for pot pie, but had seconds of this. I followed the suggestions of others..used refridgerated ready made crust, baked the bottom crust 10 minutes before filling. I used 1 can cream of potato, one can cream of chicken and the milk. I boiled 2 split chicken breasts the day before and shredded/cubed it into the mix. I added pepper, salt and a couple shakes of garlic salt. It took longer than 30 minutes for the crust to brown. If you don't heap the filling you can get 2 small pies from 1 batch so you have more crust per serving, my husband likes the vegetables, so best to just heap it all in.

Pretty freaking good! All I did was add more chicken and I put cheese inside and on top. I cooked the first pie crust for ten minutes as recommended and added the egg on the top crust. Other than that it was really tasty and I loved how easy it was! :)

Fresh vegetables and home made onion soup make this a winner.  As it is, it's not really even food.  You might as well buy a frozen pie and not bother having to clean the kitchen afterwards.

Used a bag of frozen vegetables instead.  Added a touch of Louisiana Hot Sauce to the mix as well.

Why would you rate a frozen/canned veggie, store bought crusts and canned soup recipe like you would rate a fresh, home made recipe?  Come on people...you searched it for the simplicity!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe that I will make time and time again when pressed for time!!!

Great recipe, super easy. I always use cream of potato soup & 2/3 cup of milk  and the taste & consistency is terrific. Not too gloppy, not too watery. I agree with other reviewers about adding spices. 5 stars!

This recipe is an awesome basic recipe you can tweak. Cheap and delicious. I used canned chicken- great way to get away from that "canned taste" and add moisture. I added 1/3 dried Parmesan and lots of black pepper for flavor. I also went without a top crust and covered the top with Swiss cheese instead and covered with foil. Baked for 30 at 350 then uncovered for an extra 10 minutes. Absolutely delicious and held up perfectly for left overs.

Me and my family love it.  I've made it many times now. Other than using canned chicken to save time,and seasoning to our personal tastes, everything else is exact. It's very easy to throw together after a long day at work.

It's easy and quick. The trick is to get the other pie crust on top without tearing. I trim off the edges and drop it onto a piece of wax paper. Then it is easier to get it on the pie neatly.

I too am giving this recipe four stars, but only because I changed it slightly. I use *two* cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken WITH HERBS soup. With that and some ground black pepper, I don't need to add any other spices. This  recipe is really delicious; a quick and easy comfort food that my hubby loves. I'm sure improvising with vegetables is fine as well.

This was wonderful, and I will make it many times again.  I followed the suggestions the reviewer CCOTINO wrote.  I also added a diced serrano pepper for added flavor.  I always use Pillsbury rolled pie crusts and roll the bottom crust a little thinner.  That way my pot pie is more filling and less crust.

A great recipe that is super easy. My wife raved about it and my girls kept asking if I made it. One even told me I had bought it already made. I used cream of celery and it turned out great.

What I ended up doing different was adding a twist into the recipe. Instead of mix vegetables, I used sliced stalk of celery, small bag of mini carrots. I didn't cut up carrots used them whole for flavor. I gave addition of sliced onion and chicken broth along with the milk combination thickened everything nicely. 

Everything was cooked together on stove top then placed into the two deep dish pies. I then made slits into top of each deep dish pies before placing into the oven; 350 for 30 minutes. Watch carefully since ingredients are cooked. Crust just needs to be golden brown then it is complete. Enjoy!

Let me start by saying, "I don't like Chicken Pot Pie".
However I cook for my family and they do, but as I have never made it they have been suffering the frozen store bought pie's for years. Well I bit the bullet and decided to give this recipe a shot, I had some leftover roast chicken from yesterdays dinner which was enough for 2 pies, so I doubled everything up, used frozen mixed veg, and herbed chicken soup, also did as others have "Blind Baked" the lower crust for 10 minutes. Outcome, well my family were over the moon with this, so it will be a keeper, my wife and mother in law both said it was the best they had ever eaten. Me, well I still don't like it, but I am gratefull for this easy recipe to feed my family and keep them happy.

I've made this twice and twice my family left absolutely no leftovers. I used the refridgerated ready to use dough for faster prep. I did use 2 cans of cream soup to make it creamier as well as chicken gravy in place of milk, either way works though. I tried the canned veggies and then tried fresh which i prefered more. I also chopped raw chicken, browned it lightly, then made the pie, letting the pie cook slower. This allowed the pie to brown nice and even and didn't overcook the chicken as I found precooked chicken became too dry when used in this receipe.Also added italian seasoning for a flavor boost. Will continue to make this on a regular basis. Easy and tastes wonerful! Easy to modify to fit your family's preferences which is a major bonus in my house!

I used the can veggies as the recipe called for and it turned out great.  The only problem with the first time I made it - it was a little bland.  The next time I made it - I added some Cayenne (red) pepper and some hot sauce to give it a little kick.  Just enough for flavor, not to singe the taste buds. :)

Yummy yummy! These were great for leftovers the next night when I didn't feel like cooking! I used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned and made little pot pies in small foil dishes. Looked just like the frozen bought ones from brand names.

We all loved this recipe.  I usually get fresh chicken because my parents raise there own, and broil the whole chicken, then I let it cool and shred the whole thing.  Usually I am making homeade chicken noodle soup and use some of it and then freeze the rest.  This is when i use more of it, in this recipe.  Works great.  While I am boiling it, I add seasoning so the chicken is already seasoned. All I have to do is defrost a bag and add it to the recipe.  Mom of four..always looking for shortcuts!

It was fabulous. Being a busy working woman, meals like this that are hearty and tasty yet economical and quick are my favorite. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning (a few dashes of each) and prebaked the crust 10 minutes as others suggested. I doubled the ingredients and used all canned precooked items (including canned chicken breast) and it was excellent. Getting the pre-baked shell out was not easy as others mentioned... next time will just use Jiffy pie crust mix and make a few crusts up that way. I added a jar of drained pearl onions and a can of drained peas in addition to the ingredients listed here and ommitted the milk. I think next time, I will add the milk back in but maybe just a splash. Mine wasn't runny at all, it was perfect, but I think a splash of milk might keep it just a little more moist without being soupy. This was excellent. I will definitely be making regularly on those late work nights. I only prepared one pie and reserved half my double batch of filling for another pie tomorrow.

My whole family loves this! I use 1 can of each of the following: Cream of chicken, cream of celery, corn, green beans, carrots and peas. I also add garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. It makes enough for 2 pies so I can freeze one for later. It's just as easy to make 2 at once. I have also used leftover turkey from thanksgiving and it was yummy!

I do it with Snow's Chicken, it puts together quicker especially if you get in late and still need to feed the family. What I also like is that you can add ingredients to compensate for extra bodies. Am going to bake the bottom crust a bit next time.

this was tasty, but it come out too thin, needed to be thicker. Also, had a VERY hard time getting the pie crust for the top to simply pop out! It ended up coming out in pieces....any tips/advice out there for these issues?

This recipe tasted wonderful, but using two frozen/thawed pie crusts just didn't work for me at all! The one I tried to put on top broke apart and woulndn't come out easily at all. I think this would have been a 5 star if I hadn't had all of that trouble! Maybe next time I'll use a rolled-out refrigerated crust to put on top. I did substitue frozen veggies and used cream of chicken and herb soup-Yum!

Very good. I added a little sour cream to the recipe for added flavor. Probably won't do that again as it made it a little too rich.

It was good. I took the advice of others and used frozen veggies. It was a little runny so next time I think I will add two cans of soup.

This was very good and quite easy to make.  I substituted refrigerated pie crusts for the frozen ones and baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling.  I also added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup in addition to the chicken soup.  It was very creamy and very filling.  I will definitely make this again.

I also used to slave over a home-made version, this is simple and tastes just as good.  I only used one store-bought crust to cut calories, and also 98% fat-free cream of chicken.  This is super fast if you have left over chicken.  Also used left over corn and potatos (cubed, not mashed), frozen peas, and carrots boiled for 2 minutes in the microwave.  It was so great there is none left for my lunch tomorrow!

I've slaved away making this from scratch before and my family preferred this hands down.I did these substitutions-omitted milk,used refrigerated pie crusts, added one can c of potato soup, used my own stewed chicken meat (both light and dark), added sauted onions, mushrooms, rosemary and thyme. Out of this world. Only complaint was a bit too salty for us which I think would be helped by using frozen vs canned veggies.

Great recipe!  I used refrigerated crusts which required me to bake it longer than specified (maybe 15-20 min. longer).  I also baked the bottom crust first for 10 min. as others suggested.  Also, I used one can cream of celery reduced fat soup instead of cream of chicken and I also added the suggested amount of fat free milk.  I used one box of frozen mixed veggies as well as a fresh chopped onion, garlic powder, dried thyme, basil, oregano, a touch of mrs. dash seasoning mix and a hint of cayenne pepper.  Lastly, instead of chicken, I used leftover turkey sitting in my freezer from Christmas.  Super easy and with the low fat soup and skim milk modifications it was on the healthier side.  The only change I would make is add a little salt since the soup was blander than the full fat variety.

This has become a favorite at our house.  We're pretty picky when it comes to veggies so I just use corn and add extra chicken.  It's AWESOME and so easy.

This was so simple to prepare. I increased the amount of chicken and shredded it instead of dicing. Added some additional seasonings to make it seem more homemade. Instead of milk, I added heavy cream. This was very enjoyable on a cold night and I will make again.

This was incredibly easy to do. I used leftover BBQ'd chicken breast and frozen mixed veggies (which I microwaved before adding to the pie mix) and it turned out delicious!

Yummy comfort food!  I gave four stars because I modified this a little bit... I used a refrigerated pie crust and leftovers from a rotisserie chicken, and a jar of chicken gravy with some added spices.  It was very, very good!!

This chicken pot pie was delicious!  I was worried it was too good to be true because the recipe is so simple.  My three daughters loved it and they usually don't like anything with veggies in it.

I made my own crust, cooked my own chicken breast strips and used frozen stew veggies.  Turned out really good.  It took longer to make this way but cost a lot less in the long run.

Just seeing canned veggies in the recipe was enough to turn my stomach, at least you could use frozen to cut down the prep time from using fresh.

REALLY GOOD! We tried it with just canned green beans and bacon bits (not artificial) instead of the mixed vegtables, and it was fantastic. A good solutions for kids.  The only change I would make is that I had to bake for 45 minutes.

WOW! This was delicious! I added some salt, pepper, & onion seasoning. I wasn't able to flip the 2nd pie crust on top perfectly but it was still edible! No left overs here! This is another recipe I'll have to double for my family! My grandpa said it was the best he'd ever had!

Easy, fast and delicious!  I substitued frozen vegetables (thawed and partially cooked) for canned and also added drained canned potatoes.  Also spiced it up with roasted garlic!

I made this for just two, so I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1/2 pound).  I also used frozen veggies instead of canned.  I think next time I will make my own pie crust instead of using a store bought one.

My family found this bland. My 3-year-old wouldn't go anywhere near this because it looked (and tasted) like flavorless slop with crust on top. I think I made a mistake in using fresh veggies, although I don't think I'll try it again using canned. The flavor just wasn't there and it just was a bit "too" chicken-y for me.

I used frozen vegetables and they were all still raw in the middle.  Next time I guess I should just use canned?  Or else cook em first.  Otherwise the boys loved it.

This was very good and easy to prepare. I did alter a bit, instead of cream of chicken soup, I used chicken gravy and used frozen mixed veggies and added some cooked diced potatoes and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, parsley flakes, and a dash of onion powder and then cooked it slightly before adding to gravy/veggie mix. Came out wonderful. Thanks for the idea you gave..will make again.

This is excellent, so good. Everytime I make it, no matter the crowd, it is ALWAYS a hit, and people ask for the recipe. I have interchanged the soup using cream of brocolli or creme of brocolli and cauliflower, and it tastes just as good. And instead of half a cup of milk, I add  shredded cheese.

As far as ease, this recipe was great.  But as far as taste, I felt that the recipe was missing something.  It was pretty good, but a little bland.  I think next time I will experiment using seasonings.

Very good and easy needs some extra seasoning we added pepper and garlic. The filling was a little runny so maybe next time we will put in a little less milk, just a little less.

Quick and Easy! I used canned chicken breast to speed the process.  My son devoured it and I even added extra veggies.
