On their own, one would be tempted to taste these and wonder how anyone could possible think these were any good.  They are a basic, plain shortbread type cookie with not a whole lot of flavor--until you get the lemon filling in them--and then every bite is a refreshing burst of fresh lemon complemented by the buttery shortbread. These are a more dainty cookie, which is sometimes a nice change from the heartier and sweeter chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies, or brownies. These are just a bite of lemony, buttery goodness and are so pretty! This is a classic recipe that I've been making for nearly 30 years and it has always proven reliable, easy and delicious. As the original recipe called for, I use 2-3 tsp. of lemon zest in the filling. With just four ingredients in the dough, I have it mixed up in the food processor in mere seconds.  To fill the cookies, I simply put the filling in a plastic sandwich bag, cut off a small corner, and pipe it into the indentations. They look especially pretty on a plate when half are given a light dusting of powdered sugar and the other half left plain.

These are wonderful cookies!  One suggestion:  Make the filling after you have already baked the cookies (not while they are baking).  The filling gets VERY sticky and gooey, and it is so much easier to put in the cookies when it is still hot.  I know that this is what the recipe says, but I tried to save time by making the filling while baking the cookies - my mistake!

Very good, so refreshing for summer!  I made a double batch for an activity I was attending.  For half of the cookies I used the lemon recipe exactly as listed.  For the other half I used lime juice, lime zest and a drop of green food coloring.  Everyone at the party loved them.  The cookies have a tendency to puff up and close out the hole that you poked into the dough, so right as they come out of the oven I pressed the indentation with a teaspoon so I can fit more filling inside of them after they cool.

The only thing I did different was make a different dough for the base of the cookie. I used the dough recipe from the Raspberry and Almond Shortbread Cookie from this website. The filling I made the exact same. I love lemons----the filling is perfect. Not tart at all--perfect! Next time I will probably double the filling recipe as the indentations I made were rather large because I wanted a lot of lemon filling on the top. I was short on filling for 4 cookies. I also followed another reviewers advice and I made the indentation before putting them in the oven--and also when I took them out of the oven. This recipe is so easy! Also, my shortbread cookies never became golden on the outside----but they were golden on the bottom of the cookie. If I let them cook any longer they would've burned---so watch the underside of the cookie---not the outside! Also the filling never actually dries up completely---just thought some of you may want to know if you need to transport these. They taste exactly like lemon bars to me---just in cookie form. So yummy!

Delicious.  For the cookie, I used 3/4 cup sugar, 2.5 cups flour, 1 cup butter, 1 egg, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  I strained the filling to make sure that it was smooth with no clumps.

Mmmm, loved eating them with my coffee!!!  I did add 2tsp of Lemon juice to the cookie part because both my husband and I like plenty of lemon flavor.  next time I will try to make the filling a little thicker so when i bite into it, it doesn't run.

great little cookies! Very light and crisp! I used the back of a teaspoon meauring spoon to make the indention and it worked like a charm! make sure you dip the teaspoon in flour before you press it into the cookie though, so it doesn't stick : ) tastes delightful and super easy to make!

Wonderful! These cookies are great, they are easy to make, and you use real lemon. I thought you might need to add food coloring to get that nice shade of yellow and you dont, i wouldn't change a thing except you might need to make 2 batches :) I have read other recipies, poeple say sauces are watery, you need to let it cook and thicken. Thank you for this recipie one of my new favorite!

My son loved them (has a sweet tooth) and my daughter spit them out.  They looked just like this photo too.  The upside-they were easy, the down, were not very good.  I would not make them again.  Too much of a flour flavor, not enough sweet.

The filling is delicious! It's the perfect combination of sweet/tart. I needed to add a bit more cornstarch to set up the filling more. I'm not a big fan of the shortbread crust, but that's just me. I'll change that next time, but the filling is SO GOOD that I'm giving it 5 stars anyway.

Oh yeah, the wooden spoon to make indentations pools all the filling in the center. Use your thumb, or the scoop of a rounded teaspoon or melon baller instead.

These were pretty good, but I thought that the lemon filling didn't stand up to the cookie very well. I was left desiring a little more lemon flavor.

The cookie itself is dry & tasteless. The lemon filling , to us, was a little too tart & very "in-your-face" lemony(since the cookie has no flavor to balance it out). Not the worst cookie I've ever had, but I definately won't make any part of this recipe again. Sorry:(

This is a yummy cookie! I used lemon extract instead of vanilla for the cookie. The indent does tent to puff out while they are cooking but not too bad. I also had trouble with the filling, the eggwhite clumped up on me the first try. The second try came out much better, but I know when making a lemon pie you just use egg yokes for the filling. I wonder if that would work better here. Great recipe!

Nobody mentioned what a pain in the neck it was to make the holes in the middle.....the dough crumbled or was sticky, depending on how chilled it was. 
Not sure if I'd go to the trouble again.

After reading the reviews and knowing that taste of home recipes are usually lacking, I feared the cookie itself would be plain I used my tried and true recipe  for Raspberry and Almond Shortbread Thumbprints off this site and made the filling to go with it. Outstanding results. The dough from the thumbprints is a little harder to work with but well worth the effort judging by the rave reviews from all of my children and my husband.

I am addicted to any lemon dessert and this one is definitely a keeper! The cookie was light and the filling had just the right amount of lemon tang to it!! The only problem I had was keeping the imprint in the dough while cooking. I made the hole before putting in the oven and pressed them again after taking them out. Overall, this cookie is a wonderful summer recipe!!

First, I think that the sweetness of this cookie is perfect because it's not sweet...  it's tangy.  The lemon filling is to die for!!  That part of this recipe is a keeper.  The actual cookie was terrible, and I'm not talking about taste.  I had the worst time with the dough.  They crumbled while shaping, and they cracked in the oven so my filling ran out.  I found the dough too buttery.  I think if you take the filling of this recipe, and use a different cookie base, you would have one GREAT recipe!

These are delicious.  The cookie tastes like a soft shortbread, and the little touch of lemon is great.  I would love to have one with a cup of tea!  I did have extra filling...the recipe made almost twice as much as needed.

I made these cookies for Christmas and received wonderful reviews!  I later made them again, but this time used the shortbread recipe from "Berry Shortbread Dreams" (but kept the yummy lemon filling)...even better!  The almond in that recipe mixed nicely with the lemon. I love how these cookies looked so pretty and deceivingly difficult - but they were so easy!

I added these absolutely "Dreamy" lemon cookies to my list of traditional Christmas treats, and these ended up being the BIGGEST HIT!!!  I ended up rolling the balls in my 3rd batch (yes, the first two were eaten up too quickly) very small, almost the size of a marble. This way you can eat 3 or 4 and not have the guilt.  Sooooo DELICIOUS, Thanks!!!!

This was a delicious cookie - it tasted like a miniature lemon merange pie.It melted in my mouth and was very flakey.The only problem I had was that the cookie spread after baking.It wasn't round like the picture.But I will definitely make them again.

Very good shortbread cookie and the lemon filling came out great! I had the same problem with the hole closing up some so my cookies didn't get as much filling as I'd like. I read a review since making though and will try the teaspoon indention as suggested when they come out of the oven.  Thanks for the yummy cookie!

These looked cute, but the cookie tasted chalky. Definately not worth the fat and calories of 2 sticks of butter!
