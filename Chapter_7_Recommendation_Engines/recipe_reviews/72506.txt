This was wonderfully delicious & simple! I didn't have a few ingredients so I made some substitutions. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable & I used angel hair pasta instea of penne. I also didn't have the parmesan, but it was delicious without it. I finished with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil & a pinch of garlic salt. It was great!

Tasty, but a little bland.  Might want to experiment with some of your favored spices to liven it up a bit.

If you don't have fresh veggies follow the recipe and add a package of frozen Italian mixed veggie to the recipe, but make sure you blanch them first or pop them in the oven and roast them for a little while.

This is a really great, simple, base recipe. I whipped this up for lunch today for me and my son (10 months), and it's especially nice to find something that we can both eat. I really like that everything is used (no water to dump out), and next time I think I might just mince the garlic and keep it in.

This was a fast and easy dish to make.  I added some spice, cauliflower and canned mushrooms.  Also put in some fresh baby leaf spinich right at the end.

This is fantastic! I have made this twice now and love how flavorful it is without having it coated in red sauce.  The parmesan puts this dish over the top.

I liked this recipe a lot because it was simple (with few ingredients) and relatively fast to prepare. I made it two days in a row, once with vegetable bouillon and another with organic vegetable broth. Both times I felt the sauce came out too salty, and it had kind of a weird aftertaste. Maybe it was from the broccoli? I also had to tweak the cooking times for the veggies a little bit so they didn't end up too mushy at the end. I would make this again with some variations, and would try adding different veggies and low sodium vegetable broth. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a yummy light dinner, if your in the mood for pasta but don't want a heavy cream sauce. I add a little more parmesan, and a few sprinkles of gorgonzola with ground pepper. Nice recipe!

I used fresh snow peas instead and red pepper.  Left the carrots out.  Delicious.  I'd make it again.

I make this recipe regularly, at least a few times a month.  It's so easy, flavorful, and it's a good way to get my toddler son to eat his vegetables (yes, even he likes this dish!).


I do a few changes.  First, I increase the garlic to about four cloves.  I mince the garlic and don't discard it.  We love garlic!  Second, I use at least three cups of vegetable broth.  When the dish is almost done, I remove the lid and let the broth reduce for a few minutes until it starts to thicken and is more sauce-like.  It adds creaminess and more flavor.  Finally, I double the cheese.  The cheese is the best part!

Note: Never ever half-cook pasta. Mine never cooked all the way through so if you are attempting this recipe, cook your pasta ALL the way through to you test and just toss it with the veggies. Add olive oil or cream so it's not so... ehem... dry. Good luck!

This is a great recipe.  It's simple and quite tasty. My husband absolutely loves it.  I'm not a big fan of vegetable broth so next time i'm going to try chicken instead.  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the garlic (kept it the whole time too) and doubled the veggie broth. My husband doesn't like carrots or peas so I added extra broccoli. This recipe is so delish, and easy to customize for your picky eaters. Will DEFINITELY make this again soon, he went up for seconds!

Only 4 stars since I made some changes due to personal preference. I omitted the peas and Parmesan cheese, added 1/2 cup chopped onion to the veggie/broth mix, and added 1 tsp crushed basil and some ground black pepper to the pasta. I also added ~1/4 cup alfredo sauce, just enough to make the pasta moist.

I was a little leary about only cooking the pasta for 5 minutes.  But that's what I did 5 minutes from the broth boiling (I used chicken broth) I then poured the whole thine it into my pan of broccoli and carrots, including my galic which I had minced.  After adding the peas I let that coof for 10 mins, added my parm cheese - and wow!  This was a hit with the whole family.  A new favorite!

I was afraid this was going to be bland, so I added some red pepper flakes and basil.  It was pretty good, and a good way to get a lot of vegetables into a dish. Make sure to use plenty of parmesan cheese.

It was a bit bland for me, but I used whole grain penne. It was still good though, I think I need to add a few spices next time.

This was good and very easy.  I didn't have peas or vegetable broth.  Sprinkled Garlic Powder in with the Chicken broth to boil penne.  Used only Broccoli as my kids would eat it this way.  Sprinkled shredded Italian cheese blend on top and added roasted red peppers to my dish.  Kids ate it up!  Will make again!

This was a good recipe. I'm only giving it 4 stars, because I had to do a fair bit of tweaking by taste to make it a tasty dish. A great base, but a little off. Good thing it is open for tweaking in any direction. I had to add 2x the vegetable broth, and simmered the complete dish for twice the amount of time at the end for the pasta to be edible. I used whole wheat penne, used TWO big garlic cloves, and left out the cheese, making it a delicious vegan dinner, with a bit of tweaking on the flavor.

I left out the peas in this recipe and will give 4 stars on account of my children liking this.  I found the original recipe bland and had to add something to give it flavor.  That something was more garlic.  I used a great homemade vegetable broth that was very flavorful, but it was soaked up by the pasta and was left bland.  A little tinkering and a lot of parmesean cheese would inch this up to a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for a good base.

Very good recipe, my wife and I really enjoyed it.  I generally followed the recipe, except that I also added 1/2 peel red pepper, 1/2 Japanese eggplant, and 1/2 small yellow squash for additional color/flavor, and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley for garnish.  I look forward to making (and eating) this recipe again.

What a totally excellent recipe!!! Absolutely delicious and really low-cal for a pasta recipe. A brilliant way of getting kids to eat their vegetables too.

I made the adaption of using about double the broccoli and carrots, and cooking the veggies for an extra 5 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this a few times now and it always turns out quite well. Its very simple and tastes delicious the next day. I add a little touch of olive oil and parm to moisten it up before reheating.

Great inspiration from this recipe. Had to alter it a bit b/c I don't usually cook with broth so I just used plain salted water to boil the penne and substituted the carrots with green and red peppers. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick! Although it's more expensive, I always use real Parmigiano-Reggiano (grated when I need it). I find it adds just the right amount of flavor to dishes without adding more salt b/c it's a salty,nutty cheese already.

My husband and kids loved this. I used 3 cloves of garlic after reading that you couldn't taste the garlic with just one. I still thought you could barely taste the garlic and will try a little garlic powder next time. This would also be good with chicken. Still thought it was a good recipe.

A very flavorful light dinner, perfect for summer.  I gave it 5 stars because it was quick, easy, few ingredients, and great leftovers.  My kids, marinara junkies, seemed to like it, but I could just as easily put their red sauce on top of it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was ok.  I followed the recipe to a "t" but felt it was lacking something because it tasted kind of blah.  I'll have to see if my husband can spice it up a bit, he's a wiz with sauces and spices.

My husband especially like this dish.  I added a bit of pesto sauce at the end because I had it on hand.  I also added red pepper flakes for some heat.  Overall, pretty tasty!

This is a very tasty dish with a few tweaks,  First, in response to a prior reviewer who said theirs had a weird after-taste, make sure you use low sodium organic vegetable broth...do NOT use he instant, those always taste metallic (and are way too high sodium!).  My veggies of choice were carrots, red pepper, mushrooms and broccolil.  I sauteed these (with about 4 garlic cloves) in olive oil while the pasta cooked in the broth.  I made sure the veggies still had some crispness, then added them to the pasta once it was done.  I cooked a minute or two longer, adding the frozen peas and cheese.  Cooking it this way left the veggies with still ome firmness.  I used all organic ingredients....yummy!

This was very yummy.  A very light meal.  I served it with salmon and it was delicious.  

The only change I did was used crushed garlic from a jar and just kept it in with the vegtables.  It came out beautifully and was a hit with the kids also. Will definately make again.

This was easy and I learned a great trick of cooking the pasta in veggie broth with the roasted garlic.  The pasta was flavorful and using at a the base with the veggies worked great.  I also used fresh tomatoes which I should have added at the end and not let them stew,  I think it was a little bland so next time will add some fresh basil or oregano too,  I used vegan Parmesan and it was great. Will definitely make it again.

I made this using fresh asparagus instead of broccoli (which my hb will not touch!).  We thought it was very good, but perhaps needs a bit more "punch".  Next time I may add some Italian herbs & maybe a pinch of red pepper flakes.  That said, we each devoured two helpings.  :)

I can't believe this worked. IT went against all of my instincts about cooking pasta... I usually boil in a huge pot with plenty of water so the pasta can move around. I did actually use a whole carton of chicken broth, not 2 cups. But everything did cook and come together without everything turning to mush! I used broccoli and red pepper as well as some onion, extra garlic and jarred artichoke. I added some shrimp when I combined the pasta with the veggies. I also added some lemon juice and lemon zest at the end... Tasty!

Really tasty! Added a bit of Alfredo sauce so the pasta wouldn't be too bland/ dry. Added mixed veggies at the end instead of frozen peas. Great idea. Followed the recipe otherwise, will making this again very soon!!

Turned out to be a nice summertime family supper.  I used extra garlic (2 cloves in the pasta, 3 in the veggies) and left it in the whole time.  I also added crumbled bacon and a splash of lemon juice.  And I needed to keep adding broth to keep the pasta from sticking and to keep everything cooking during the last 10 minutes (didn't measure, but probably came to about 3 cups instead of 2).  Thank you!

This pasta is delicious! I made it twice and made some changes. Cut up red bell pepper into little pieces instead of broccoli. Used 1 cup of frozen 'peas&carrots' that was in the freezer. **I had a half jar of Alfredo Sauce left in the fridge that made this wonderfully creamy!!!** The second time I made it I did half Alfredo, half Chicken broth. So awesome! Definately making this again!

I made this exact to the directions. I personally did not care for the noodles cook in the broth. And I never tasted the garlic. I don't care for peas or broccoli but the family does and they still wouldn't eat it.  Next time I'll add chicken, replace the peas and broccoli with snow peas and replace the veg broth with chicken broth or water, and add more garlic. Wow a whole new recipe.

Great base recipe, I added diced onion and snow peas, and omitted the frozen peas. This is one recipe I KNOW I will use again and again - and it will never have the same veggies in it. So very versatile !

Kids liked it and the bite I had was pretty good. Instead of a crushed garlic clove I added some garlic powder to the pasta water. I didn't use the veg. broth just water and added a small ladle of the water at the end.

This is a great recipe if you forgot to go grocery shopping before a holiday weekend, and all the stores are closed...*ahem* I didn't have any broccoli or parmesan cheese, so I had to do without. It tasted really good, and had nice, subtle flavor.

Boiling the pasta in the chicken broth really gave this a good flavor.  I used a bag of mixed frozen vegetables and it was still yummy.

Very light and healthy, yet filling and tasty, this will please your pickiest family members, except the fiercest meat eaters. It was very quick and easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.

I didn't think this was great.  It sounded very good, but it had little flavor.  My kids asked that this one be retired and not made again.

Great recipe for pasta w/o using a heavy sauce! I didn't have broccoli so used fresh asparagus instead-will certainly make this again!

This was just OK. It was a little dry. I probably won't make it again.

I made this last night and really liked it - I used one pound of ziti, so I increased the broth to 4 cups (or 2 cans).  I was a little nervous that it was too much pasta with not enough liquid, but it all worked out.  I used frozen broccoli that I cooked in the microwave while I sauteed the garlic and carrots.  I think next time to skip a step I might just cook it all in one pot - saute the garlic & carrots and then add the broth and bring to a boil.  Then add the pasta, peas and broccoli.  Just a thought - also, was a bit bland without the cheese, so you do not want to skimp on the parm!

Very good.  I think I used too much pasta, so I had to add a little more broth with the veggies, however only had chicken broth, but it worked.  I also added snap peas, zucchini and orange bell pepper.  It had much more flavor than I was expecting.

What a great recipe! Used this for my rehearsal dinner and they loved the taste. We just added zucchini for more veggies. A great success! thanks
