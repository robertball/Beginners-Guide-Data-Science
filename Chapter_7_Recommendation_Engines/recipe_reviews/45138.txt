I've made this recipe several times and people beg for the recipe.  I have little dishes filled with hot chile sauce, green onion, peanut sauce, or anything that I think might be good in the wrap.  I try to have butter lettuce or romaine to wrap the small pieces of beef in.  It's such a fun thing to do for a party.  People are amazed how good it is!  Thanks for putting this recipe in!

A Mother's Day success for all nineteen of us.  We rolled the thinly sliced lamb in tortillas along with chopped tomatoes, thinly sliced onions, and tzatziki sauce.  Not only did I get rave reviews (even from the grandchildren) but the smells coming from the barbecue tantalized the neighbors too.  Sure wish there were leftovers, but not a scrap was left.  And that's the best review of all!

THIS HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST MARINADES FOR BEEF OR LAMB THAT WE HAVE TASTED. YOU MUST MARINADE AT LEAST THE 8 HRS,BUT OVERNIGHT IS BEST.

I've already reviewed this before but have to again because I've now made this dish at least 50 times and it never fails to impress. No need to change a single thing but suggest always marinading in XL clip-lock plastic bags rather than a covered dish, giving the bag a squish to spread the marinade and turn every 6-8 hours , and always marinade it for 36 hours .. And to those who leave the bbq lid open, no need but you must always check and turn as a little bit of char is necessary to make this dish oh so special... ENJOY!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  The marinade was excellent and our four childeren loved it.  We will definately try it again!  Thanks for the suggestion about the flatbread and sauces.

We made this again the day after Thanksgiving 2008 and served buffet style with other left-overs.  We still had Turkey left but no Lamb!  Best Lamb recipe we have ever tasted!

Truly excellent!
Everyone at our bbq thought this was magnificent.
Will certainly be using this one again.
Also worked well with the venison steaks we had.
Thanks Cyndi, from Mike, Glasgow, Scotland.

This was a very good marinade.  A nice change from the way I usually make lamb.  I'm anxious to try on other cuts of meat. I'll make this again.

This is an outstanding recipe. The marinade is delicious. I marinated the lamb leg for 24 hours and cooked it on the grill. It was out of this world. I would make it again in a heartbeat!

I marinated for 24 hours. The only change was using regular soy sauce instead of mushroom soy sauce. I closed the lid on my grill and it charred like crazy! fortunately I caught it in time. I basted it repeatedly with the remaining marinade and it it wasn't too bad. the meat was cooked just right thanks to my meat thermometer. I think next time I will cook it on the rotisserie to avoid the charring. It'll probably take longer but it will be tender and juicy! Anyway, this recipe is really good, but be careful on the grill because all the sweet stuff in the marinade will definitely char. Also, I would marinate the lamb for more than 24 hours if possible. The longer the better.

If you love lamb you have to try this. Wow! We love lamb and this is one of the best legs we've ever had. Followed the recipe, no tweaking.  Marinated over night. Yum yum yum.

This was an amazing meal that awed my guests. I served with moo shu pancakes and Rosie's Bok Choy Salad (on AllRecipes). Definitely makes my short list for a memorable dinner party menu.

This was brilliant, totally recommend it. Everyone kept wanting more. I've only done it with lamb but intend to try it with beef as well.

Wow....what a great recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving and my guests were so impressed!!! Keeping the lid open on the grill worked really well.

Whatever you do, don't close the lid on your barbecue.  My husband did, and we had charred, blackened, crunchy, well-done leg of lamb---and we'd been marinating it almost 3 days!  What a bummer...

Delicious, but the real lamb flavor is lost in the sauce. It's very good, but it's a little overwhelming. If your goal is to disguise the lamb, this is perfect !

My family loved this, even the kids. They just didn't want to hear that it was lamb.

I tried this for Easter dinner based on the ingredients seeming appealing and the reviews. Since so many recommended marinating it for longer, I prepared it 48 hours in advance.  My family LOVES lamb and I have welcomed trying different recipes. I have to say this was okay but not outstanding.  If I were to do it again, I'd use beef instead. Also, once you have it on grill 10-15 minutes per side, do not be afraid to close grill lid. You will never get it cooked properly without closing the lid. We like lamb medium rare and with 5 pounds, we had this grilling for closer to 45 and the center was still rare.

One of the best recipes I have ever made. I marinate for 36 hours, watch the temperature of the meat while grilling and serve with tzakaki sauce, tomatoes, lettuce and pita bread.  There are never any leftovers.
