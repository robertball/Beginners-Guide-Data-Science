I really liked this recipe, but I did make a couple changes. There wasn't enough cinnamon for my taste, so I sprinkled each side of each breast with some cinnamon first. I then grilled the breasts on my George Foreman grill to get a nice sear on the outside to lock in all the natural juices in the meat. Then I put them in a covered casserole in the oven for 45 min instead of an hour. The grilling gave a rich brown caramelizing effect to the sauce as well. Very tasty. I added my picture to the recipe. I hope you enjoy my changes  :o)

I am making it now but I wanted to say this before I forget. It would be helpful for beginner cooks to know if they spices are suppose to totally blend into the mixture or not. There were still granulated bits on the bottom after I was done whisking and I didn't know if that was ok or if I needed to keep mixing
