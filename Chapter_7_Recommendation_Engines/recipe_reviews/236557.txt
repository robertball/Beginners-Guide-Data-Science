5 Stars for flavor but 1 Star for instructions / method.  My concern is step 5 -  "Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to remove potato slices from vinegar mixture and gently add to the hot oil."   WARNING! This is darned right dangerous! Putting wet anything into hot oil can cause FIRE and splatter burns.  Please, if you make this recipe, pat the potatoes dry or spin them in a salad spinner to dry them before adding to the hot oil.  This has you first soaking the potatoes in cold water to remove the starch, which is great and then patting them dry - I don't know why because you then place them in a vinegar / water bath to soak again. The recipe does not have you drying the potatoes before frying. All that said, these did have a good flavor - the thinner the potato slices the better the chips.  I used my food processor slicing attachment, if you don't put any pressure on the potato to force it down the slicing blade will cut paper thin potato slices in no time at all.

The vinegar taste was not there, they were either undercooked or burnt.
