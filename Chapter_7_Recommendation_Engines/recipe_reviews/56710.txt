Giving this 4 stars because I changed the recipe, following other reviewers' suggestions.  Cut the black pepper to 1 tsp, used olive oil & butter (around 2 Tbs. total), added garlic & mustard.  The mustard is a brilliant suggestion!  It really makes the dish.  I serve this with buttered egg noodles (actually, I used a "Smart" butter-like spread instead of real butter).  Add the buttered egg noodles to the cabbage & kielbasa mixture at the end and stir it all together.  You need a really BIG pot, as this makes a huge amount!  Tasty, easy recipe; I'll be making this quite often!

Quick, easy, and delicious! My girlfriend was skeptical because she is Polish and grew up eating delicious Kielbasa recipes. How can I compete with that? Well, we polished off the entire dish between us very easily. Don't worry about having too much cabage in the beginning. It cooks down a lot. Also, don't be discouraged if it doesn't taste great at first. Once it cooks for the entire 20 minutes, the juices from the Kielbasa and all the other flavors mix really well. I served it with instant brown rice and it was perfect. No way there's enough for 4, though. We're not big eaters and the two of us finished it with no problems.

Based on previous reviews, I added some chopped garlic to the onion saute, reduced the cajun spice and the black pepper to ONE teaspoon each, and added a generous squirt of brown mustard to the worcestershire before adding.  SENSATIONAL!  Very tasty and this recipe is a definite keeper.  Love it.

This is easy to make and you can adjust the seasoning depending on your mood.  I brown the kielbasa with the onion first, then add the cabbage since I like my meat browned and the cabbage with bite. Added garlic and made it a little more spicy by adding red pepper.  Yum.

Fantastic!  My husband and I loved this!  I did use real butter instead of the oil for more flavor, only about 1 TBSP.  I also used fresh chopped garlic and cooked it with my onion for a bit prior to adding the cabbage.  I think it gave the cabbage a bit more flavor.  I also only used a touch of cajun spice.
If you are a "hunky" like me, try serving it over potato and cheese pierogies!  This is a definate keeper!

Definitely let this cook for the full 20 minutes after adding the kielbasa and spices.  I was in a hurry to eat and the flavors didn't have much of a chance to blend.  It was definitely good, a little spicy.  It was awesome the next day after everything had a chance to sit and the flavors came together.  I had started this in a deep skillet, but found it hard to stir.  So, I transfered it to a dutch oven type pan, much easier to manage.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

what i liked most about this recipe was that it was quick and easy. all ingredience in recipe are things i usually have on hand. i only rated it 4 stars because i felt it lacked a little flavor. when i made a second time i added 2 cloves of minced garlic and sprinkled shredded monterey jack cheese over top and made a HUGE difference in the flavor. this is something i will prepare again.

I wanted to reduce the calories/fat in this recipe so I used Turkey Kielbasa instead of "real" Kielbasa.  I had to use a little more Olive Oil (1 to 1 1/2 Tablespoons) to compensate for the lack of oil generated by real Kielbasa but it tasted great!! I will definately make it again and probably increase the Worcestershire Sauce a little too.

Kielbasa & Cabbage II Haiku: "I've made this before. And we love it more and more. Couple things I add." I've made this as written and been happy w/ it, albeit a fairly bland-looking dish, so this go around, I included some red bell pepper (for color), fresh garlic (b/c I can't get enough of it), and a handful of chopped celery (b/c Cajun seasoning seems to call out for the veggie-trinity.) I do what another reviewer mentions and brown the sausage earlier on w/ the onion so it gets browner, and add the cabbage later so it retains some bite. I don't eat mine over rice or potatoes, b/c I think the cabbage is a nice stand-in for starch on its own. Really an amazingly-easy dish to prepare and so tasty.

I absolutely detest cabbage but hubby wanted me to cook some.  So, I found this recipe.  I'm now converted -- at least with this recipe...my only suggestions are to add minced garlic in the onion mixture and to also cook the kielbasa for a while first in a separate pan to reduce the amount of grease.  It was too greasy for me as written.

This recipe was a good base to start with. I did reduce the pepper by half and eliminated the salt (as more of a personal preference.)Plus, there was quite a bit of salt in the Cajun spice I used.
In order to stretch this out, I added potatoes, carrots and green peppers. It was very hearty and perfect for the sub zero Arctic tundra day we had today. What a great comfort food! I will make this recipe again and probably at least once more yet this winter. Fast, easy and delicious.

This was so good, I did not add quite as much pepper as the recipe called for, just a couple turns on the pepper grinder and I stirred in 1/2 tsp of brown mustard into the wocestershire sauce before adding it to the pan.  Wonderful flavor!  Will be making this often!

This was a bit different, and pretty easy to make, but in the end I'll have to settle for calling this just an okay recipe. I made it exactly as written, using Penzeys "Very Hot" Cajun seasoning. I ate it as is, without doing the suggested "serve over rice". It was fairly spicy, but not especially tasty otherwise. Just nothing special, in my opinion.

This was great.  I did cut down the cajun seasoning to 1 tsp and added about 1 tbsp of spicy brown mustard.  I served over egg noodles.  This was very easy to make and tasted great.  Save the leftovers because it is even better the next day.

I made the recipe as directed except reduced pepper to 1 tsp. Unfortunately this was way too spicy for me, definitely reduce the amount of Cajun seasoning. Also be sure to slice your onion rings thin so they soften easier. Served it with rolls for an quick & easy dinner.

This was fantastic!  Hubby loved it and said it was a keeper.  I also added 4 carrots cut in chunks.  I also threw in about 3 tbsp. butter and cooked it in a tall pan.  I usually cook cabbage in chicken broth but this produced plenty of moisture.  The only thing I would change is the amount of the cajun seasoning.  I can't use a lot so cut it to 1 tsp. but will cut it to 1/2 when i make it again.  Of course, this is just my preference.  This would be good served with cornbread.

Very good! I didn't have green cabbage so substituted with the bag of coleslaw I did have that needed to be cooked anyway. I didn't add the salt as I thought it  the worcestershire sauce would be enough. Added two teaspoons of spicy brown mustard and topped with shredded swiss cheese. I also used turkey kielbasa that I browned a little before cooking the onion and coleslaw. Would make again for a quick weeknight meal!

I was looking for something like a comfort food for the winter and couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.  After reading some of the other reviews, I improvised and put in a lot of additional stuff but the kitchen sink, including ground mustard, celery seed, caraway seeds, some cut up carrots, potatoes, apple cider vinegar & homemade raspberry vinegar.  Seasoned to taste with seasoned salt & pepper, and turned out to be what I wanted.

This was really 3 stars for us.  I didn't use any sausage though so I wanted to be fair.  I was looking for a diet friendly side to use my huge cabbage I got from the farmers market.  I halved the pepper as others suggested and I am so glad I did.  The full amount would have been too much.  This was easy but the flavor was just average.

This turned out great. I don't like soggy cabbage but this was soft but still crisp. I thought I'd use leftovers to make a soup but my family ate all of it, even the kids liked this!

This was so good and very budget friendly. I used turkey smoked sausage to lower the fat a bit, and because I didn't have any wostershire sauce, I added in a few teaspoons of cider vinegar. It was simple and yummy.

This recipe was incredible.  I really enjoyed it.  Since I'm single, I halved the recipe.  I used 2 tbsp butter instead of oil to saute the vegetables, really giving the dish a rich flavor, and added a tsp of mustard as another reviewer suggested.  I also added extra cajun seasoning.  The dish was spicy, but not overly so for my palate.  With all the cabbage and onion, it really filled up my 11 inch skillet, making it just a bit difficult to saute, but the cabbage reduces, so it was no problem.  A dutch oven might serve better.  So delicious I am looking forward to making it again.

I will make this again. Husband does not like anything hot or spicy and this did have some to it. No complaints from him. The only thing I changed was I only added 1 tsp each of pepper & Cajun seasoning thinking of my husband.

Loved this!  My husband really enjoyed this as well, and he doesn't even like cabbage.  I did cut down on the black pepper a bit by only adding 1.5 tsp.  We will definitely be making this again, and especially since we have grown beautiful cabbage this year in our garden.

Browned the kielbasa before adding the onion and cabbage. Added chopped garlic, squirt of spicy brown mustard, a pinch of cajun... and a thinly sliced cored apple. Reduced black pepper to 1 teaspoon, which was plenty. Wonderful over hot rice.

The cabbage cooked up great but the seasoning was way too strong.  Next time I want to make kielbasa and cabbage, I'll try a different recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I did a few things differently but it still turned out great.  I cut the sausage in half lengthwise and then into 1 inch chunks.  I browned these in a pan with a tablespoon of butter and some olive oil.  When they were browned I took them out and put in the onions and a minced clove of garlic, sauteed for a bit until the onions were getting soft.  I then added the cabbage, W. sauce, cajun seasoning, S&P, and a squirt of brown mustard.  I just eyeballed the seasonings and probably used less than called for.  Then I added the sausage chunks back in.  I served these over potato and onion pierogies. It was a very filling meal, good for a cold night and easy on the pocket book.

This is everything Cajun!  And, as if it wasn’t spicy enough on its own, I used andouille sausage.  This one is too much for me, but I make it every once in awhile for those who enjoy Cajun cuisine.

Love this inexpensive and quick dinner! I like to add some quartered potatoes or sometimes I just used the canned. I had more seasonings, sometimes throwing some red pepper flakes in. Its also great with hot sauce or steak sauce (my family loves to add sauce to everything).

This was a good recipe.  Surprisingly, my husband was ~not~ a huge fan of the addition of brown mustard. Next time I think we'll try the recipe in it's original form. Over all it was a good meal, served over egg noodles.

MMMM. So good. I used turkey kielbasa instead of regular because it is so much healthier for you. So good! I love cabbage and kielbasa! I served this over whole wheat egg noodles for a complete meal. Delicious!

Being a lover of Keilbasa and sauerkraut, I thought I'd like cabbage and Keilbasa. I was wrong. This dish looks really good and is easy to prepare but, even with my addition of crumbled bacon,we didn't like this so much. I might keep it and work with it though. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a real comfort food dish!!  The only thing we do different is to sautee the kielbasa with a tsp. of cajun seasoning first and then add it to the rest of the mixture.  We usually eat it by itself and it is a wonderful meal on a cool fall nite.

excellent!  I actually used 1tsp cayenne pepper instead of Cajun seasoning and it was a little on the spicy. We ate the whole thing anyway!! I'm craving it again just thinking about it!

I didn't serve over rice.  This came out a lot better than I had hoped.  I haven't given many 5 star reviews ... this one is 5!  You do need a huge frying pan to get everything in there and be able to stir it.  Super easy to make and I didn't make changes.  Although the garlic does sound like a good idea.

Use a very large skillet because the cabbage takes up a lot of room until it cooks down.  Flavor was good, I didn't have any creole seasoning, but I substituted with Cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, and garlic.  I will make this again.

This is a super recipe.  For the most part I followed it exactly with two exceptions.  First I used red cabbage and I added a can of small white beans.  I also pretty much doubled all of the spices.  Cabbage is somewhat sweet and I wanted to give it a little kick.  Very Good!!  Thanks!

7.19.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/56710/kielbasa-and-cabbage-ii/ ... 'Almost didn't rate this since I reallyyy stripped the ingredient list down, but I am since E, 22, had two servings & said it was good.  Yes, SAID it was "good"!   Wahw.   ;D   I used hot-dog style smokies; diagonally sliced & cooked till started to brown.  Added the 2t cajun seasoning & the onion.  When the onion was lightly golden, I added the cabbage.  'Cooked that till tender crisp & then covered, stirring occasionally, until it was right.  If you can get someone to eat sauteed onion, you can get them to eat the vegetable known as cabbage.  :o  I'll try adding the Worcestershire that I meant to, next time.  I used half cheap-o & half namebrand Cajun seasoning.  The cheap-o is mostly salt so no need to add salt.  I need to get a good homemade Cajun seasoning recipe.

I've made this twice. The first time as written.  And a definite 4 1/2 to 5 star recipe. Great comfort food.  

Now for the do as written and not as I did. The second time I made changes but only because I needed to use up what I already had. Namely Cajun andouille sausage and cabbage. I'd run out of Cajun seasoning so used Creole seasoning instead. Added mustard to the sauce this time. Not a big fan. Was just a tad too spicy for me. Not overly hot just the sauce was so strong as to over power all other flavors. I'll stick to the original recipe.

I chose this recipe for Kielbasa and cabbage because I think the list of ingredients fit the bill and did not list potatoes,since I eat low carb these days. I followed the directions to a 'T' with the exception of adding a 1 teaspoon of brown grainy mustard. I only had half of a kielbasa, so I added 2 uncured beef hotdogs,(chopped) to the mixture.  My cabbage hating husband has turned into a cabbage lover! Thanks for posting,we loved it on a chilly February evening!

I had no Cajun seasoning so I substituted Tajin, a common Mexican seasoning of dried chili's, dehydrated lime juice, and salt. I also added a touch of cider vinegar for a sauerkraut taste

I made this for an Octoberfest pot luck, and there was darn little left!  I didn't have Cajun seasoning in the house, so I made some from an AllRecipes recipe.  It was a bit too hot for me; another time I'd use less of that.  All in all, it was very tasty.  Yes, I will make it again.

Family and friends really enjoyed this along with mashed potatoes. Without potatoes it is carb free, make with mashed cauliflower and still great.

Wow! This was delicious. I used some of the tips mentioned in previous reviews: added mustard and reduced the pepper and Cajun seasoning by half. Next time I'll add more Cajun seasoning but I don't think it needs the full amount. My pot wasn't big enough and I made the mistake of trashing part of the cabbage. Be patient and let it reduce. You'll want all the full amount of cabbage

I've made this a few times now varying the spices. I didn't have premade Cajun spice so I used a recipe and it was too spicy for us so the next time, I went a third and it disappeared - even the leftovers

I cut back the Cajun, pepper, and Worcestershire to only 1 tsp. each and thought it was quite tasty, but I had it by itself not over the rice.  I also used a cabbage and carrots coleslaw mix.

This was great. I used 1 tsp of Cajun and pepper as meat was polish sausage with a bit of spice. Also added the large squirt of brown mustard. Then some garlic powder. Yum.

I didn't follow the directions all the way. I sauteed the onions with minced garlic first. I only use olive oil.  Didn't have keilbasa so i used smoked sausage.Added the rest of the seasonings to my liking. ..more Worcester shire sauce. Served this with pan fried red potatoes. ...very delicious!

I liked this and will probably make it again but I did saute the onion and the sausage together first and then added the cabbage.  I used a bag of coleslaw mix with carrots, (it was nice to have another color in the dish) and although I used the full amount of cajun seasoning, I skipped the black pepper completely.  I was afraid that would have been too spicy for my taste.

Good recipe!  I didn't change it at all - just changed the S&P amounts - but I usually "eyeball" these things - Take Note of your Cajun Seasoning (Slap Yo mama or Tony C's) if it already has salt in it - you don't need to add any add'l salt at all - You could add potatoes and or a small chopped sour apple - Thanks for sharing!

I like others found recipe good but to spicy....we served on rice but even that did not tone down the hotness. Kids could not eat. If you like the spice or heat on a cold day..it will for sure warm you up...spices definitely got to cut down otherwise good fast meal.

I will cut back on the Cajun seasoning next as this was a bit too spicy for my son, but it was a tasty meal and very inexpensive. We served with buttered egg noodles. Will make this again.

i made this yesterday and my husband loved it.  i used lite kielbasa and instead of the reg mustard i used brown horseradish mustard that's all i had on hand.  for us the cajun seasoning was the right amount.  i did cut the amount of pepper and i  added some garlic cloves to the oil before i pan fried the sausage and onion.

I think the black pepper overwhelmed the other flavors.  Next time I'll half the amount of pepper, and add a clove of garlic.

I love kielbasa and cabbage, each on it's own. I found the spices to overwhelm the taste of both the kielbasa and the cabbage. If I make it again I will use 1/2 as much seasoning.

I love the traditional cabbage and kielbasa recipe but it can be a little bland to my husband (who's half Thai and grew up eating really spicy food.) So this was a perfect compromise!  Cabbage and kielbasa with a kick!  The only change I made from the original recipe was that I used blackened seasoning instead of cajun seasoning and 1/2 tsp. of that was plenty spicy (maybe a little too spicy for my 4 yr old!)  Anyway, this was great! I will make it again!

I guess I must be a wimp!  I left out the extra salt and pepper and cut the Cajun seasoning to 1 teaspoon.  It was still hotter than I could enjoy.  And my poor husband?  I wont even mention it!

I happen to like cabbage and kielbasa, so I absolutely loved this dish!  I added extra cajun seasoning and hot sauce to this recipe.....so very good!  Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good.  It needs more spices though.  It was a little bland but a good base for your own creation.
