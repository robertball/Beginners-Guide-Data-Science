I made two batches of this recipe. One I made just as written and it was delicious! The second one I made exactly as written with one substitution: I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter. It too was absolutely delicious and the butter (and all those extra calories) was not missed one little bit. So I give this two thumbs up whichever way you choose to make it, but I will be making it with the apple sauce to keep it healthy and light but just as delicious!! If you want to take this recipe uptown just a bit, add some chopped walnuts - yum!!

I'm pleased to be the first to review this recipe, because it is a winner.  One chopped apple will reward you with a moist cake loaded with cinnamon, brown sugar and sweet apple flavors.  Next time, I will bake in an 8"x4" pan, as I would have liked a little taller slice, but that's purely aesthetics, nothing to do with taste.   Jinglebells, thanks for sharing your recipe.  This one's going into my Favorites folder.

Good, not great.  Not quite as moist as I expected, and both flavors of apple and cinnamon were very mild. Also, this definitely needed the 1/4 tsp. of salt I added that was glaringly absent in the ingredients list.  In addition, this needed closer to an hour to bake thoroughly, so I'd call the instruction to bake 30-40 minutes way off. I think this would benefit with the addition of one more apple and 2 T. of vegetable oil.

Wow. This is a winner! I made 2 and so glad I did. I'm taking one to a friend and keeping one for us :)! I used the pink lady apples and the cake is very apple-y and delicious! I added a full teaspoon salt to the batter which really helped to intensify the flavors, and it took 1 hour in my oven. For those who had problems with this, remember all ovens are different and cook times will vary. I recommend setting for 40 minutes and checking. If it is at all jiggly or squishy on top you want to keep baking. Add another 5 or 10 minutes and keep checking until top is firm-ish. For those who found it dry be sure you are measuring your flour properly. Spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. You might be packing it too much. This cake would be hard to dry out with all the delicious apple in it! Thanks for a great recipe Jinglebells! It's a keeper!

This was a very good cake!  Made it exactly as directed, only I used a smaller loaf pan.  The cake was very moist, and tastes even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night, exactly per the recipe. Read all the reviews and appreciated the hints.

It is very good. Nice texture,spongy consistency and good flavor. Since all my loaf recipes call for an hour of baking, mine was in the oven for an hour and came out exactly like the picture - it raised to the top of the pan and didn't deflate.  I chopped up the apples in my Pampered Chef chopper so my apple pieces were very small/tiny. I also folded the flour mixture into the creamed mixture with a spatula (not the electric mixture), added the milk as instructed and folded that in. As best as I can describe its doneness is when the cake part that seeps through the top is tan and has a dry look to it. 
 I also learned that I should have left a margin of cake batter between the brown sugar mix and the cake pan, otherwise, if the brown sugar seeps out on the sides, it turns very hard.  Love this recipe.

yummy cake! I reduced the brown sugar to 3 tbsps and the white sugar to 1/2 cup, the cake was sweet enough. Enjoyed by my sons and their friends as a snack. Mine took 45 minutes to bake. 
*Note to self, bake 5 minutes longer next time, gooey spot under the apples*

This is a wonderful recipe.  I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  It baked in 40 minutes. Hubby had 2 pieces while still warm.  Might add nuts next time ... and there WILL be a next time!

Absolutely delicious and takes virtually no time at all to put together - not to mention it's very pretty when it comes out of the oven. I did add two apples vs. one and opted for buttermilk vs. milk. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing...except maybe for the cooking time. There's no way this would bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes and be cooked all the way through. I baked mine for 50-55 minutes and it came out moist, nicely spiced and bursting with apples! This is a great base for add-in's such as raisins or walnuts but it's perfectly fine all by itself and goes great with a nice cup of tea! Thanks for a great recipe!

Took a little longer than it said but well worth the wait. Middle of August and so ready to bring in Fall. The perfect cake to do just that!

This cake was a success and I got a lot of compliments when I made it for company. The only reason for giving 4 stars and not five is that I made a few modifications after reading other reviews, which I believe improved the cake. To begin with I used 2 apples and I grated them instead of chopping them. I increased the cinamon to 2 tsps. and the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  I used a 9x5 inch loaf pan and layered like this  - spread half the batter then topped with half the brown sugar cinnamon mixture, swirled it into the batter and then added a layer of half the apples and repeated this.

I baked for a full 40 minutes, it looked great and my toothpick came out clean, but 10 minutes later, the cake deflated and it was completely raw inside!

I love this cake.  The first time I made it exactly as written.  It's a not-to-sweet, almost-pound-not-quite-coffee cake.  The apple makes an interesting addition.  My husband loved it, too.  

The second time, I made it with peaches (my personal favorite).  I used frozen peaches that had been mostly thawed but otherwise didn't change the brown sugar/cinnamon mix.  I've also made it with no fruit filling/topping so I could top it with fresh strawberries.  Every way I've made this cake, it has been a winner.

This is a great recipe.  I used buttermilk instead of milk for a richer flavor.  Also added some chopped walnuts according to taste.

Actually, my hubby made this cake, following the directions exactly. It was one of the most amazing cakes ever! Moist and very Cinnamon-y. Everyone raved about it. It's a keeper for sure! Lucky Me having someone to bake this cinnamon delight or me!

This recipe is great! BUT it does need a few modifications.. first of all white sugar can be cut by half, and it needs 2 apples instead of 1.. one apple just just isn't enough.. with two it's so moist! I also bake mine for about 50 minutes!

I have this apple cake in the oven right now! It is my third time making it and it was instant favorite from the first. I did not change a thing (and I often do, lol).
The only hint I have is.. when i ran a toothpick through to swirl the cinnamon/sugar the first time, it dragged the apple chunks around and some parts of the cake came out super moist (my husbands favorite part, not mine). So, I swirl the cin/sugar abd then add the apples abd pat down now.  This cake tastes petfect!

I made this exactly as directed and had to bake it for 47 minutes. I looked at it at 30 minutes and I did not even bother to test it. At 40 minutes a toothpick came out with batter on it. It was very easy to make but I only gave it four stars since I found it a little dry. That could be from 47 minutes in the oven or that fact that I used a metal pan instead of glass. I will make this again and might change up the recipe a little. It's a great base recipe because it is simple and quick. I can see adding walnuts, raisins, maybe some apple sauce in the middle with the apple chunks, etc. Overall it's a keeper!

I soaked the apples with the brown sugar and cinnamon for 15 mims before layering which made the apples taste more "cinnamony". Turned out yummy!

I love this recipe. I make cupcakes out of  them. I followed the steps but added more apples to each cupcake and a bite more brown sugar mixture. Came out awesome. I will be leaving a photo. :)

Amazing recipe!  The recipe is easy and fast to prepare.  I personally don't care for crispy apples in bread, so I sauteed the apples in a little butter, brown sugar and cinnamon for about 5 minutes beforehand.  I also added 1 t of cinnamon to the the flour mixture, as I really love cinnamon.   I had to bake it about 8 minutes longer than it stated. The apples tasted like yummy chunks of cinnamon applesauce.  This is perfect with coffee.  I loved it, my husband loved and my daughter loved it!  That was a unanimous vote of everyone in the house.  This is one that I will be making over and over again.  This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  Thanks Jingelbells!

I doubled the brown sugar mixture and used two apples so I would have plenty of topping and filling. Other than that, followed this recipe exactly. Deliciousness to say the least! Hello fall!

Just finished baking this cake a few hours ago. It exceeded my expectations. I made 2 5X3 loaves in metal non-stick pans. I did need to bake them 45 to 50 minutes.

Since, I am always looking for ways eat healthier and to cut calories (hopefully without sacrificing too much taste), I substituted some ingredients. I replaced: half the white sugar with granulated Splenda; one-third of the all-purpose flour with oat flour; half of the butter with light butter; the eggs with EggBeaters; and the whole milk with 1% milk. I also added in a couple of tablespoons of applesauce. The result was a savings of 52 calories per serving. The cake baked up nice and was delicious!

Thank you for sharing, Jinglebells! Also, thanks to those who reviewed the recipe. I will try some of your tweaks the next time around.

I loved this recipe, it is so good !  I added about 4 oz. of cream cheese to my recipe, simply because I had some that I needed to use up. I baked this at 325 degrees, it took nearly an hour and a half.  Everyone's oven is different, so keep an eye on the time and check it with a flat knife if you don't use toothpicks.  For those who want more sugar since this doesn't have alot of sugar in the loaf, I would recommend adding an icing or hard sauce to pour over it, or serve it with ice cream.  This recipe was so good, I made another one to give to a family member who is stopping by.  This recipe can also be found posted on Facebook by those who tried it and enjoyed it.  That is where I originally found this recipe.

I've made this twice now. Once as directed and once I added chopped walnuts. Both times it was absolutely delicious and moist. The only thing I would change is baking it for 40 to 45 minutes as it took that long both times I made this.

I followed the recipe exactly. I think the cake was good but I did find it wasn't as moist as I would have liked. I think next time I would add 4oz or sour cream or vegetable oil and see if that helps. It did take 47 minutes to bake at 350.

Super yummy. Took the advice of many others: add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt to dry ingredients, used two apples instead of 1, mixed cinnamon + brown sugar with apples before adding to cake, cooked 65min. Slightly crunchy outside when baking with nonstick pan, but that actually made it even better.

I made this loaf Gluten Free. I added chopped pecans sub the white sugar for coconut palm sugar and added more apples. (which I mixed together with the brown sugar and cinnamon)  This is the third time baking this loaf and it did take about 50-55 minutes to cook.

Delicious recipe! If it helps anyone, the doubled recipe fits nicely in a 12x17 sheet cake pan. I mixed the apples into the batter, spread in the 12x17 pan, sprinkled the brown sugar mixture on top, then swirled & baked for 25-30 minutes. I took it to church & brought home an empty pan. Will definitely be making this again.

I don't often write reviews but I was so humbled by this recipe just needed to add my voice to the choir.  I made this recipe just exactly according to the instructions except maybe I used a little more cinnamon than recommended.  I noticed there was no salt suggested so I didn't put any in and I certainly didn't notice the absence.  I think it took about 55 minutes to be done but, of course, every oven is different and you have to know how to tell if a cake is done. You can't go by the suggested amount of time like a robot.  I feel the top of the cake and if it's springy, it's done.  I use the toothpick test too but feeling it works for me.  Anyway, this was one of the most wonderful cakes I have ever baked and I bake several times a week.  LOVE it and will be making it regularly and giving away slices to lucky recipients.

I was out of milk so I substituted sour cream.  Otherwise I followed the instructions as written. I had to bake it for 55 minutes, I suppose because of the sour cream.  It turned out really good!  I will definitely make it again but next time I will add walnuts and maybe raisins because it could use just a little more flavor.  Thank you for sharing a good recipe.

Loved it!!!  Doubled the cinnamon and put two apples. I had to cook for a full hour if not a little more.

I made this yesterday and it turned out moist and delicious.  I used two apples instead of one, as shown in the video with this recipe. Also, I doubled the amount of cinnamon because I really like cinnamon and 1 teaspoon seemed a bit light.  And, as some others have noted, salt is conspicuously absent from the recipe so I added 1/4 teaspoon. Lastly, it did take an hour to cook. 40 minutes was not even close. I set the timer for 40 minutes and then checked it every 5 minutes afterwards just to be sure it didn't overcook. This is sure to become one of my favorite recipes.

I'll give this 4 stars.  The cake part tastes wonderful.  I made it just as is and believe it could be a 5-star recipe with more apple and cinnamon mixture in it.  I also believe next time I'll put some cinnamon in the batter and also add some fresh-ground nutmeg.  I don't think this will be sitting on my counter for long.

The lack of flavor is so disappointing. Plus, mine baked for 1 hr and 10 minutes (at 30 it was still jiggly).  Might be better suited to a 9x9 pan than a loaf pan.

Awesome!  Would not hesitate to try different fillings.  I found the "cake" part of this recipe absolutely, absurdly moist and delicious.  Like a lighter, fluffier coffee cake.  Thanks, this one is a true gem.

Absolutely delicious, but the 30-40 min bake time is WAY OFF.  After 40 mins, mine LOOKED good but a butter knife into the center came out with raw batter.  I have a brand new great oven, very clean, and my bread took about 70 mins to cook.

Great recipe for a quick sweet treat! I made this per the recipe, but did cut the amount of sugar, per another reviewer's comment (3 tbsps brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar), and it was perfectly sweet enough. I used 1.5 pink lady apples (the only kind of apple I'll eat), and it was nice and apple-y. I did need to bake it about 45 minutes, but it turned out delicious and moist. I had the first slice (for "quality assurance"), and when I served a slice to my boyfriend, I heard a very loud "Mmmmm!" from the living room. I will definitely make this again!

I made this cake yesterday. I added about half a teaspoon of salt, tripled the cinnamon (maybe quadrupled, I eyeballed it)., also about a quarter cup more brown sugar. I had to add about 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup as called for in this recipe. I only added apples( I used 2 large macintosh)in the middle of the cake ,along with the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. I added the remaining batter and topped with the rest of the brown sugar mixture and baked at 325 degrees for 38-40 min. It was delicious !! With those few minor changes I found this cake to be top notch!! My family loved it!! I ate the last piece this morning with my coffee and it was 5x better than yesterday!! What a rich and comforting, moist and scrumptious apple cake !! Definitely one of my faves and I'm thinking of making it again today! I will double the recipe next time and make 2 round cakes because I found it to be low in height and not enough to satisfy everyone's fancy! I may even layer them and add a glaze!!! Yum!!

Everyone loved this moist, delicious cake!  Made two simple changes:  mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon and apples together before adding to the cake and used three apples instead of just one.  Will be making this again.

I used coconut oil instead of butter.  I also added about 2/3's cup chopped walnuts and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp.  It took 15 minutes longer cooking time than the instructions stated (a total of 55 minutes). It came out really good  but needs salt.  Next time I will add a teaspoon of salt.

Excellent! Made it today and used unsalted butter and 2 apples. It actually had a similar taste to apfel kuchen. Mixed the apples with the brown sugar and cinnamon before putting them in the batter as shown in the video. I think it is very important to watch these videos because they show things that aren't specifically written in the recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe many times over.

It tastes great!  The oven temperature/time on the recipe is a little off though because I baked it the way it says, but when I took it out of the pan, the middle was quite raw even though the toothpick came out clean.  I put it in the oven for awhile longer, and now the middle is nearly fully cooked, but the edges and sides are crumbly and dry.  Next time I will have a cooler oven and cook it for much longer.  It will make a great breakfast tomorrow morning!

Really good! Since I was using a non-stick loaf pan, I reduced the oven temp to 325. The cake took about an hour to bake, but looks and tastes great!

Delicious loaf. My husband is gluten free so I used all purpose gluten free flower (XO Baking Co.) in place of the regular flower and it came out fantastic. Since a few people mentioned that the cake was dry, I added a couple of tablespoons of plain yogurt to the mix. I also mixed a teaspoon of cloves to the cinnamon mix and used three small apples instead of one. It came out moist with lots of flavor!! This recipe is a keeper, and my husband who is the pickiest eater loved it!

This bread is fabulous!  I followed the recipe, except the cooking time, and it was perfectly moist with delicious chunks of apples!  I ended up cooking it a full 20 minutes beyond the 40 recommended - I took it out at 30 and then again at 40, but it was still pretty mushy. Also, next time, after pouring in the first half of the batter, I'm going to put the cinnamon/sugar mix and swirl it, then add the apples, and do the same on the top layer. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I really liked it! So easy to make with ingredients on hand. It could use a little almond extract perhaps?  I am going to try that next time...

The timing of this recipe is way off. I baked this for 45 minutes. It looked done, but when it cooled it fell in the middle. I baked it for four minutes at 60 per cent in the microwave and it was no longer raw in the middle. The next one I make will be in the oven for an hour -- most of my other loaf cakes recommend an hour of baking. I have amended my notes to reflect the timing change. All in all, this is a family favourite, and a pretty nice showcase for one apple.

It was a really easy cake to make.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated but used 2 medium sized apples (1 1/4 cups) as i didn't know how big of a apple was originally used. Did have to bake it for an extra 15 min, but i have a smaller propane stove, it doesn't heat as high as a normal stove.  It is an excellent cake warm or cold.  I would definitely make it again.

I just made this recipe in cupcake size, and let me tell you, it was a total hit! After reading the reviews, the only modification I made was adding 1/4 tspn of salt, it really did the trick. Also topped it with a species cream cheese frosting, it was a great. I totally would make it again, highly recommend this recipe.

Loved this cake! I used 2 medium apples, the apple flavor came out more and it was perfect. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the batter.

I made (2) double recipes for a big crowd.  This recipe was easy to work with was very tender.  Cooking it in 2 larger pans slowed the baking a bit.  It was more like 45 minutes but this batter could handle it.  The only change I would make is to use a bit more of the filling for the top.  Adding toasted walnuts might be nice, but clearly not necessary.

This cake is delicious!  It's a great way to use those last few apples that just don't get eaten.  I add pecans and reduce the cinnamon.  Yum

It's delicious. I used less sugar-only 1/2 of a cup in a batter, and not white, but coconut sugar-it has the molasses taste. I also used 2 apples-"Lady Pink" variety. I baked it in slightly wider metal pan 9 by 7 inches for 40 min, and then covered it with a foil and left it in an oven for another 5 min. It came out well done, but moist. This cake is easy to prepair and tastes great!

I added some mashed apple to the batter and about 1 tsp of salt. I also used more than one apple to the sliced apple layers. I took about 1 hour to bake. I would give the recipe a 5 stars with my changes. My kids' friends asked for their very own personal loaf. Will definitely be making again.

This was good but I think a bit too sweet. If I make it again, I will add another apple and maybe nuts. I might even top it off with a cream cheese frosting.

This cake is really good.  I must say this recipe definitely needs more apple and apple flavor.. The next time I make this I will use two tart apples (McIntosh) and might even add a layer of cinnamon apple sauce.  If your cake is dry, try it again and make sure to use room temp butter, milk and eggs, don't  over mix you cake batter.... and make sure you use the exact amount of flour...  The cake was perfectly baked at 45 min.  Thank you for the recipe.

My daughter and I loved making this together! We both LOVED the taste too. I agree it needs almost an hour to bake. Also I added extra cinnamon...and sprinkled a bunch on top too. To make it "healthier" I used pure egg whites, more apple, less sugar, margarine (and not as much as listed) & 1% milk.

Very moist, wonderful flavor. Great texture. I added a handful of raisins only because my husband enjoys apples and raisins together.  It took a little longer than listed but that never bothers me because I know everyone's oven can be different and I usually check a recipe 5 minutes before what a recipe calls for too. I'd make this recipe again. Delish!

It was a snow day and I wanted to make a quick loaf bread but stumbled upon this recipe and decided to try it.  Long an behold this was a hit. My girls tried to eat the whole thing throughout the day, so did I. This was a nice, quick, and easy recipe. (used a grannysmith apple) I am going to make one for my girlfriend's birthday and give it to her as a gift since she loves my baking.

Did not have much time yesterday and wanted a quick and easy cake, so tried this out - it turned out lovely, and my guests enjoyed it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Will surely try this out again. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is worthy of selling in a pâtisserie for a premium price. The only change made was using apple sauce instead of butter..  Maybe using a large Bramley apple made a difference as well, but the cake bit around the apple layers came out rich and creamy instead of cake-like.  Baking time took closer to an hour than 30 minutes.  No matter what, it turned out perfectly for our tastes.

The recipe is delicious however... I followed all of the directions but the cake was not done in 30-40 minutes. It took 60 minutes for it to cook completely. I like it but next time I am definitely adding another apple and keeping the peel on. I am also going to mix half the brown sugar mix and 3/4 of the (2) apples with the cake batter and put the remainder of the brown sugar and apples on top.

We enjoy this recipe immensely!  I am not a big lover of cooked apple dishes, so when I first made this I decided it was more for my spouse than myself.  However, if you dice the apples fine enough, the apples seems to melt into the cake batter so you get a great apple flavor without having to bit into a piece of soggy apple.  I have made this recipe three times now in the past few months and I can tell that this will be a staple in our home.   Thank you for sharing!

I tried out the recipe and was overall pretty pleased. I made it a bundt instead if a loaf. I think doing so made it not as moist as it could have been. I will make this again, but I think I will increase the butter to an additional half stick and a pinch if salt. It's going fast!

Even though it came out looking like the photos I see here, and moist, it was very dense. I think maybe I over-mixed it, not too sure.  The flavour is nice, so finishing it wont be a problem, but will try to make it again at some point to give it a second chance.

Baked this as per recipe with the exception of a small amount of chopped walnuts. Two things; ovens vary so mine took about an hour not 30-40, second thing the cake is about 5 inches deep so testing with a toothpick is not going to work use a butter knife. My whole family enjoyed this!

Doubled the apples, added chopped pecans & a dash of canola oil to cinnamon/apple/sugar mixture. Also added salt to the batter per another reviewer's suggestion. Phenomenal, simple recipe to begin with and tweak to your own preferences. A huge hit with my company!

Took this cake/bread to a retreat over the weekend.  It got lots of kudos and requests for the recipe.  Very moist, tasty and not overly sweet. I did follow the video and used the suggested two apples rather than just one.  Thank you for posting!

I have this baking now, house smells great, followed the recipe almost, after reading all reviews I added two tablespoons oil and used two chopped apples that I let sit in cinnamon sugar mixture. We can hardly wait! I did sprinkle some raisins on top..set timer for forty five minutes! I made a drizzle and this cake is delish! Did bake for almost an hour. This cake is very moist and with the added Apple and cinnamon it is a keeper. Next time I will make it in nine inch round pan...I cannot imagine anyone not loving this cake! Great job jingle bells! Yummy with fresh brewed coffee!

This was good but a little bit dry for my taste. I like a moister cake. It was very easy to make but took a bit longer than the 30-40 minutes that the recipe called for. I had it almost an hour before my toothpick came out clean. I will make this again but I will try to add some shortening or oil to moisten it a bit more and I will add pecans to the top layer of apples. I drizzled a simple glaze on top to finish it off.

AWESOME! If you like coffee cake.. and you like apples.. this is the recipe for you. I doubled this recipe one for my house and one to bring to a fall bridal shower, er reading other reviews suggesting it didn't have much apple flavor so for the liquid ingredients I did half milk/half apple sauce. The flavor was to die for and the cake was incredibly moist, also probably because of the apple sauce. I also baked for 30 min, then checked with a toothpick, then did two more 10 minute intervals checking each time. It is melt in your mouth delish. The perfect fall recipe. I also used red delicious apples, and would suggest also adding one more apple if you enjoy the little juicy chunks of fruit. Thank you for this recipe!!!!! I will make this for thanksgiving!

This definitely took much longer than 40 minutes. I kept having to add five to 10 minutes to the timer, until it was closer to an hour than the 30 minute mark. I think needed salt. It would maybe help with a touch of something that was missing in the recipe.

I just made one last night. And i followed some tips from the reviewers. Yes i did the 2 pink apples, chopped, mixed to 3 tbsps brOwn sugar. Leave for 15 minutes.. while waiting mix 1/2 cup white sugar to softened butter.  And followed the rest of the ingredients. Finally!!! The perfect moist cake i am looking for. With my electric oven, i baked the batter for 40 minutes. The appearance looked like a marble cake. THANK YOU JINGLEBELLS and to all the reviewers who shared their expertise! Sept. 2, 2014.

I haven't tasted this yet but it sure smells delicious.  I'm a little worried about it coming out as the batter was extremely thick and there hardly was enough of it to cover two layers in a loaf pan.  Also, I might have left the apple pieces too large.  Will update later! Update: Cake was very moist and delicious.  Next time I'll make sure to cut the apple pieces smaller.

Doubled the batch but cut back just a smidge on the sugars. Baked in a 12" springform pan for 45 minutes. Super moist. Apples have just enough bite to them.

I just made this and it turned out pretty good. I used a huge apple, so it had an apple taste. I did use a dark pan so cooked at 325 instead of 350. It took 70 minutes to cook and the sides and bottom were a little brown, but it tasted good and was moist. Eat it warm with butter on it or ice cream.

I've been baking my way through different apple cakes trying to find a recipe worth keeping. Unfortunately this wasn't it.  The baking time was off, and once the cake was done it just wasn't all that good.  Not dry, so it wasn't overcooked, just a little...bland.  Nothing spectacular, I probably won't make again.

Excellent cake, moist and very easy to put together. I made it twice - once exactly as written and the second time I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13. Both times it took closer to an hour to bake but well worth the wait. Will be making it again. :)

This cake would have been great if it had only been done in the middle.  I baked it for the recommended 40 min. plus 5 more.  I couldn't bake it any longer or the outside and the ends and sides would have been hard as a rock.  The recipe doesn't specify type or size apple, fine or coarsely chopped.  I used a standard glass 9x5 loaf pan and my oven temperature was accurate.  I did add 1/2 C. chopped toasted walnuts to the original recipe. What a disappointment.

Delicious! I also substituted the butter with applesauce. I think I'll double the batch, and use 3 apples instead of two. The flavours also come out best the next day (like banana loaf!)

My husband and I loved the recipe. The only thing I changed was I increased the cinnamon to approx. l tbsp. We love cinnamon!!!! I was multi-tasking and forgot about the cake. About 45-50 minutes later I remembered the cake. I tasted great. I put the leftover cake in a plastic bag overnight and it was so moist and delicious. Forwarded the recipe to my girlfriend at once.

I admit, I don't have the greatest oven, so I started my timer at 47 minutes and had to go to 70 minutes before the toothpick came out clear.  Once done, it was moist and wonderfully sweet.  I also didn't have regular butter so I used unsalted butter and added a pinch of salt.  Very good cake.  Everyone loved it.

I followed directions and found that baking time had to be increased by almost 30 minutes. Cake was a bit dry but tasted alright. Someone suggested using applesauce instead of butter and reduce the white sugar.I will try that next time.

This is a very moist cake and I will make it often. Wish I saw this before the holidays because it would be a great gift. It took 40 minutes before it was cooked all the way for me as well. YUMMY!

Oh my goodness, this little loaf cake was so easy, and tastes so good! I prepared it just in time to entertain family, and I am glad that it worked out. I gave it 5-stars because it really is easy, and delicious. I made two loaves...the first by recipe, then the 2nd I added walnuts. Both loaves I baked for 40-44 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

Thank you so much for this recipe! This will be one of my favorite go-to recipe's for a quick but delicious treat as well as using it for when I want a pretty and amazing dessert! I did have to bake it a little longer than it said, but I realize that ovens can be a little different so I don't just assume that there is a problem with the recipe. I am anxious to try it sometime in muffin tins!! Thanks again, I know I will use this recipe often!!

This was not a successful recipe for me.  The cake did not hold together at all and stuck to the pan.  Disappointing.  The cake itself was pretty good but a bit bland.  I likely wont make this again.

I'm really happy about this recipe, it came out nice and moist, only thing I did add was a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the flour and baking powder. Only thing I will recommend is to add a 5 or 10 more minutes to the cooking time, depend on your oven, other than that is a delicious treat I will make it again and again. Thank you for sharing this recipe:)

Well the other reviews said this cake was dry, so I over compensated.  I subtracted some of the milk and added oil, I soured the milk as I didn't have any buttermilk on hand.  And I added a heaping tablespoon of sour cream...I was determined not to have a dry cake!  Mine had to also bake about 1 hour, but it was a bit too moist in the center.  I also added chopped walnuts, because the recipe seemed to lend it self well to accepting walnuts.  The taste was very good, but due to my extra additions, a bit too moist.  I think I probably should have baked it a few minutes more to eliminate this problem.  I realize I made many changes to the original recipe, but I doubt if I would have given a higher rating.  It seems you could also make muffins instead of cake with this recipe.

This is a wonderfully easy cake to make. After making this there is no longer any excuses to buy boxed cakes. The cake took a full 60 minutes to bake; checking it every 5 minutes after 40 for doneness. Next time I might double the apples, back off on the brown sugar just a tad and add walnuts. Nice fall themed cake! We'll do this one again. Taste: I really liked the texture and bite, preferring a bit of a heavier cake for this style. Excellent taste and went exceptionally well with a scoop of Blue Bell.

This cake/bread was very good. We did notice it was a little dry and crumbly, but the flavor was excellent.  This recipe is fairly easy as well.

I tried it and it did come out delicious. I'll agree it takes far more than 30 minutes to bake. After tasting it, it was well worth the almost hour it took to bake. I will be making it again and may try peaches instead of apples.

Made this cake this morning.  I wish it had had more apple flavor.  I used a granny smith apple today, but I will continue to experiment with other apple varieties.  The cake itself had a nice crumb/texture and a nice cinnamon flavor. Quick and easy to prepare.  It took 45 minutes in my convection oven at 350 (mine automatically resets to 325 on convection setting) to be done all the way through and the cake was still moist.  I would definitely recommend giving this recipe a try.

Looks like I'm the first one to give a negative review. Mine sank in the middle. It took a lot longer to cook. And it tasted like a store bought cake. 
The birds, however, are loving it. Even my husband told me to toss it. And he eats everything.
(the video shows 1/4 cup butter. recipe says 1/2. which is correct?)

Awesomely easy to make and awesomely good!  Made it as per recipe, just added some chopped pecans and a little bit of almond extract, because I love almond flavor!  I did have to bake it for almost 50 minutes for the pick to come out clean.  Yummy!!

I made it according to the recipe but sprinkled  slivered almonds in the middle and also on top.  The almonds added a nice touch.  Next time I may try adding walnut pieces as that would be good too.  Baked as stated (I have a convection oven) and the texture and taste were good except a little too sweet for me so next time I will only put 1/2 cup white sugar.

Perfect recipe. My kids loved it. I followed the recipe exactly . For the review which said it took 1 hr to bake I would say that varies from oven to oven, for me it took exactly 40 min. Thank you.

This was delicious! But I had to bake for much longer than I should have baked like for 20 extra minutes because it was raw

I made this because of the great reviews but it is a one and done recipe for me.  I didn't like it much and thought it tasted worse the second day.  It definitely needed a longer cooking time.

Awesome cake. Though I had to bake it for 65 mins. Probably coz my baking tray was 11×4. Excellent cake. Will make again.

I added more butter and powder sugar instead of sugar. I used salted butter. But if i use unsalted butter, I would definitely add a pinch of salt. I also added 2 tps vegetable oil and doubled the milk and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. Overall It came great! Everybody loved it.

Loved the cake.. I did add 2 apples.. but I also have made a mental note for next time .. to double the cinnamon sugar.. make swirls and evenly distribute the cake layer.. using a smaller tin is a great suggestion..this one is for keeps!

It was delicious, but I agree with the previous two reviews: 30 minutes to cook is definitely not enough (more like 50-60), and it needs salt. I also wished there was a hint more sweetness, so next time I’ll be adding an icing drizzle on the top to take it to the next level.

I made this for the first time.  Am eating a piece right now while rating the recipe.  It is delicious, easy to make and turned out just like the picture.  I did as others mentioned and added half a tsp. of salt.  Other than that, I followed recipe exactly.  Will be making this apple cake lots more this Fall.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

Good but not great.  I added 1 tsp of salt and some raisins in the middle apple layer.  I used a 4 x 8 stainless loaf pan.  Took 55 minutes to bake but came out fine.  Good basic recipe that can be modified any way you like.

It was very easy to make, and the flavor was good, but it seemed dry. I think it could have used twice as many apples and twice as much cinnamon.

This came out very moist for me. It took close to an hour for it to be baked through.  I added 1/4 tsp of kosher salt to the flour and baking powder. I didn't get too much of an apple flavor, I might have used the wrong type ( gala). Overall it was a nice cake and I'd make it again.

It took roughly 55 minutes to fully bake through, but was well worth it. Not too sweet, and makes for a good pairing with coffee. Big hit. Will definitely make again!

Very good apple cake. Not as sweet as some other recipes.  I prefer the German Apple Cake recipe made in a 13x9" Pyrex that is also on Allrecipes.com, but my guests, who prefer less sweet desserts, really liked this cake.  I just could not get as excited about it as other reviewers.

Reduced the brown sugar to 3 Tbs., white sugar to 1/4 c. plus 6 packets of Pure Via and substituted the butter with 1/2 c. pureed pear. Used soymilk instead of regular milk. Sometimes I add chopped nuts and 1/2 c. quick cooking oats. Have made it many times this way and it is always moist and delicious.

Flovour s wonderful. For me the baking time was off, I had to bake it 10 minutes longer. Next time I would put in 2/3's of the batter first instead of a half. My apples went to the bottom. Besides that it was wonderful!

THIS CAKE IS SO EASY AND SO TASTY!!!! I was really craving a cake and I had all the ingredients for this one. 

I didn't have the right sized pan, but used a 6.5 x 8.5 Pyrex and added 5 minutes add it didn't look done after 20 minutes. 

The cake came out super moist and delightful.  Not too sweet, not too much anything honestly.  I am definitely making this again. I can't before we how easy it was to prepare.  This will continue to be a go to for me.   Maybe ill try this with berries in the summer!

Super yummy!! I added an extra apple and 1/2 tbsp of salt - baked it for about an hour; turned the heat down to 330 for the last 15 minutes - big hit around my house!!

I made this loaf yesterday exactly to the recipe. Like others have said, it needed extra time to cook in my oven but that's no problem. It wasn't dry but I didn't find the flavour all that extra special. It was just okay. I doubt I'll ever bother making it again.

Simple ingredients and very easy to bake. Flavor is good too. But I have a question: why the middle area of my cake turn out runny (not gooey like an uncooked dough)? I have it baked for 35 mins.

This was a really good recipe!  I doubled the amount of cinnamon and used 2 apples cut into 1/2 inch chunks.  This loaf needs a minimum baking time of 50 minutes.  Mine took nearly an hour.  I'll definitely make it again!

This bread came out delicious! I made a few changes to mine. I added a punch of salt, 4 tablespoons of homemade applesauce, and pecans. I also baked it for 55 minutes and it came out perfect. Second time around I am going to double the cinnamon sugar.

I loved the basis, however made a few changes based on good feedback in the comments here and my own taste.

Changed:
I used two apples, used seeds of 1 vanilla bean instead of essence (and kept the remainders of the beans in the milk whilst that was warming to room temperature), separated the eggs and beat the whites adding them in at the last moment,  for brown sugar I used halve raw cane sugar to give a spicy flavor.  Doubled the cinnamon, increased the (salted) butter to about 175 grams (added about 50%) to be closer to the classic 4x4.
Added, zest of one lemon (this as I used sweet fiji apples that lack a little freshness/acidity), 1/4tsp salt

Definitely didn't make it healthier :) but this was  niceee

Amazing cake. I have made it seven, eight times and people just loved it. A twist that I used was to separate the egg whites, and then beat them till very fluffy and blend in after the flour  is mixed with the batter. It makes the cake deliciously soft. I also Garnish the top of the bake with little stars cut out of apple slices and it really looks nice. Great recipe, thanks

I made this today and it was delish!

I did make a couple of changes to the dish after looking at the other reviews and because I had extra apples that needed to be used up.

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.
I added 1 teaspoon of salt to the flour and baking powder mix. 
I used 3 apples diced small and I tossed them into the cinnamon sugar mixture to coat them all before layering them on the batter.

Very moist and delicious!

Sugar-free version
This is the only apple cake recipe you'll ever need! I make it once a week  for my diabetic husband. I use stevia as a substitute for the white sugar and a brow sugar substitute as well.
Adding nuts and raisins only makes it more awesome!

Great recipe!  When making it, I did substitute "1c + 2 Tbsp whole wheat flour" for the "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour" and used almond milk. Next time I am going to try doing more of a streusel-type topping.
And yes, it really does taste even better the next day!

Holy Mackerel! I took a bite of this and said wow! I changed it only by adding another apple and I made some icing that I drizzled on top. The cake was so moist!  I ended up baking it for almost an hour.  I will definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe is really moist and delicious...Very easy to make, but I sliced the apples instead of chopping for a finer texture. 

It keeps very well for a few days wrapped and in the fridge (if it doesn't get gobbled up right away )   so yummy :-)

I baked it the minimum amount of time (which is the normal for my oven). I baked it the remaining 10 minutes. It was burnt on the top, but done in the middle. I will try this recipe again with changed variables. It smells great so had it turned out I think the taste would have been good,

I doubled this recipe so I could bake it in a 9X13 pan.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding more diced apples.   My apples were small so instead of using 1 diced apple I used 3 diced gala apples.  While we both enjoyed this cake we thought it needed either more sugar in the recipe or a light glaze on it after it cools not to much, just a little bit sweeter.  I think next time I will toss my diced apples with a little bit of cinnamon and brown sugar before adding them to the batter.  I will also add some chopped pecans or walnuts to the cinnamon and apple layers and omit any glaze.  I baked my 9x13 inch cake for 53 minutes at the recommend oven temp in recipe.   This cake was nice and moist but if you find yours turns out a little to dry then just add about one quarter cup of canola oil to your finished batter and blend well.  With these minor changes it will be a 5 star recipe at least for our family.

It was good but not great.  I understand why others made massive changes to the recipe.  Not sweet enough more like a bread than a cake.  Very moist (I added an additional half apple).  The bake time for me was way off.  It took almost twice as much time to bake than the recipe called for.  Would only make again if I followed some  suggestions of the other reviewers.

Awesome recipe. Definitely a keeper. I did add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, which is not listed in the ingredients, but was needed to balance all of the flavor & sweetness. I used a golden delicious apple. The cake was extremely moist & the apple was not overpowering. Depending on the type of apple you use, as well as your oven, you may need to adjust the baking time. Mine took a good bit longer, so don't just go by the time in the recipe, be sure to check using a toothpick or cake tester. This cake reminded me of an apple cinnamon bundt cake my sister used to make. Yummy!

Excellent. Moist and so tasty, Brought to work ; was enjoyed by all. A fellow worker requested a copy of the recipe and I copied her one. Luckily, there was one small piece left my husband got. Making again soon.

The taste was beautiful but I found it too dense for a cake. I prefer a nice, fluffy cake. I will need to experiment with a different batter. Any suggestions?

I also hate it when cooks review before following the original directions.  That  being said, I made this cake following some directions from others who tested and reviewed.  Very easy to make, my husband and I really liked this recipe, and I am sure I will probably make it again sometime.

This was extremely easy to make and the only change I made was that I used 1/2 cup sour cream instead of milk.  I also made the cinnamon and brown sugar equivalent to 1 1/2 times what the amount was supposed to be.  Also, I had to bake it longer than what was recommended.  I did use a metal pan and baked it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, but then lowered the temperature to 325 and baked for another 15-20 minutes.  Came out so moist and delicious!!  My husband and friends who came over for brunch loved it.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Jinglebells for sharing.

I agree, Good, but not Great. Slightly bland taste & thought it could use a cream cheese layer to make it more moist.

I used two apples instead of one. The top half came out amazing but the bottom half was dry. I needed to pat the apples in further and swirl the cinnamon through the bottom layer too. I will make this again, and maybe add a pinch of nutmeg and/or cloves just to see if I can take it to the next level. This is delicious as is though. it was more moist the second day and I think the cinnamon flavor came through even more.

I will say that I did not find the cake to be buttery in the slightest, however.

It was perfect! The only problem was I made a HUGE baking mistake and didn't put in much sugar. I tried to give it some sweetness by drizzling caramel over it, but it still tasted salty. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS WELL!

So good, so easy and from scratch. This is lighter than a quick bread but heavier than a boxed white cake. It was only slightly sweet so if I were making this again, I might add a little more sugar. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing. My son and husband both really liked it as well. 5 stars - no question.

Great recipe.  Family loved it.  Made it several times and this last time I forgot to put the vanilla in the batter but it still turned out great.  Followed recipe with no changes and will definitely make again.

Very tasty, but very crumbly! I can't help but wonder if just folding the apples into the batter, and then just layering the cinnamon mixture and swirling it through might help the loaf stay together better. Will try that next time. It is delicious, but you need to eat it on a plate and with a fork!

I made this cake as written with the exception of using Downs cake flour instead of regular flour because i always use it.   this recipe was just okay. nothing too special about it.  It is a good starter cake recipe for someone that just started baking though!
Super easy.

I followed the recipe &  it came out perfect! Mine wasnt dry at all but I did use a large Empire apple which was crisp & juicy. Didnt notice salt missing & it definitely needed additional bake time. I dusted with powdered sugar. Yummy. Thinking of mixing sugar, cinnamon & apple first next time...

Made this cake and thought it  good and will bake again. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and had to bake if for one hour. The cake had a very good texture and was easy to make. Would make a nice welcome or get well gift.

I really like this recipe.  I use 3 apples - half in the center and half on top - that are coated in the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture because we are apple fanatics, so I have to cook it a bit longer,  but it is a GREAT recipe.  I made one for my mother -in-law with the sodium free baking powder and unsalted butter and it turned out to be only 35 mg of salt per serving and still tasted really good!  So 10 out of 10 and definitely a 5 star rating for me!!!!  I've made it 3 times in 4 weeks so far!

I'm sorry to say that I thought this cake was a bit dry and boring.  It took over an hour to bake thoroughly.  If I had to make it again I would add more vanilla and a caramel and/or cheesecake swirl and a crumble topping.

I made this as per the recipe substituting buttermilk for the milk and mixing the baking powder with the buttermilk rather than the flour before folding into the batter.  I also substituted Costa Rica brown sugar for the white granulated sugar and reduced the quantity to 1/2 cup.  The cake was outstanding.

I don't normally leave reviews but this is very good. The only changes I made were I used 2 apples - 1 for each layer and since I have a homemade cycle on my bread machine, I mixed it by hand and then baked it for an hour and 20 minutes  in the bread machine as I hate to heat up the kitchen for a small cake. It turned out perfect!

I made this twice.  The first time, I added blackberries because they were on sale at the supermarket and I had them in the fridge.  The second time, I did not have an apple, but I had a small bag of frozen blueberries.  I thawed and drained them. Also added chopped walnuts. Both times it took 60 minutes to bake at 10 min intervals.  I covered with foil after the first 40 minutes.  Both cakes were delicious. Will definitely make again!

I doubled the recipe and used applesauce for 1 part of the butter.  I doubled the recipe in order to bake it in a bundt pan and baked it for 55 minutes. I did add salt as recommended. I also glazed the finished cake.  It's looking good but haven't served it yet.  Will let you know how my guests enjoy it.

Wonderful recipe.  As some others have mentioned, it was pretty sweet so I reduced both the brown sugar and white sugar by half.  I also totally replaced the butter with apple sauce (and the muffins turned out perfect).  As well, rather than milk, I subbed in full fat Greet vanilla yogurt (another good reason to decrease the sugar).  I made  34 mini muffins and baked them for 12 minutes.  Rather than putting the apples in the middle, I just tossed them in to the whole mix.  I put some cinnamon, brown sugar and butter on top.

I topped the cake with the mixture of cinnamon & brown sugar and it turned out to be a nice crunchy cinnamon top!!

No idea where I've gone wrong (I followed the recipe to the letter!) but I  baked this for the recommended 30-40 min and it was still liquid in the centre! Have just put it back in the oven for the same amount of time again and hoping it comes out ok. The smell of it baking and the taste (from the skewer used to test it) are both amazing though! Really hoping it turns out with extra baking time. Maybe I just had a very juicy apple??

I made one batch as listed, and one as a gluten free version by substituting the AP flour for gluten free... Both versions baked up very nicely, but the bake time was almost an hour Instead of the 30-40 mins listed in the recipe.... The second time I made it, I followed the instructions on how to arrange the layers, but swirled the entire loaf pan together rather than layer by layer, and it turned out amazing!!!!!!

This was excellent!  I did reduce sugar by half and add a half cup of applesauce and used two Granny Smith apples.  It was super moist and not overly sweet. Made a delicious breakfast. I cooked mine 1 hour in a stoneware bread pan with the last 10 minutes covered with aluminum foil to keep it from being overdone on top.  I find that stoneware cooks more evenly.  It came out perfect.

This was amazing for how easy it was to make.  I used more brown sugar, apples and cinnamon though.  I also had some left over cream cheese icing from a different recipe, I used as a drizzle over top.  The inside was so moist  and outside was crispy and flavourful.  My husband looked like he was in heaven.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe on hand for future reference.

Absolutely brilliant. Accidentally measured 1 cup butter so I added an extra egg. Used a tat of salt, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 teaspoon almond extract. I used self raising flour and 3/4 baking powder instead. It came out so moist I could hardly believe. And it's sooooooo delicious when it's warm.

I loved how moist it was and truly is a delight to eat. I thought it might turn out to be heavy but it was soft and light. I made the following changes to the recipe: equal proportion of brown & white sugar, double the cinnamon quantity and 2 apples and a bit of salt (1/4 tsp). I also added a few thinly cut slices of apple on top of the cake for aesthetics. The cake took almost 70 minutes at 175C in electric oven. I suggest that one keeps checking the cake near the 55 minute mark as all ovens differ.

It was OK, I found it really plain and I don't eat anything with dairy so I substituted the butter with vegetable oil and the milk with apple juice. I also had two apples, one chopped and one sliced. And it was all to add more flavour. The chopped apples, I mixed together with brown sugar mix which I mixed with the batter because I found it not as sweet and plain without it. Then, when I poured half the batter in, I added half the sliced apples and sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and brown sugar. And when I pour the remaining batter, I added the remaining sliced apples and more brown sugar and cinnamon and I found that delicious!

Awesome recipe.  I added 2 apples and baked it for 55 minutes and it turned out beautifully.  Will be making again.

I loved the apples, but the cake really needed flavor.  It is better next day toasted.  Not really impressed

I made this cake and found it an easy recipe to follow. I will make it again; however, I will add more apple and spices.

Very easy to put together. Super moist. I used two different types of apples instead of one for more flavor!

Since this is the first time making this I stuck to the Original recipe. It's Yummy! However Next time I think I'll Use a bigger Apple & maybe swap apple sauce in place of the Butter.

I Loved this cake, its so moist, and not an overwhelming taste of cinnamon. However It took double the time to bake...70minutes. 8x3.5pan.  The time length suggested was  absolutely off.

Also works as gluten / milk free!
I made it for afternoon tea at work and it was a big hit amongst my colleagues! They knew before even tasting it that it was an apple and cinnamon cake, so the flavours were definitely not too mild as some of the other reviews suggested. People complained that I didn't make enough. And it was so easy to make! Mine took about 50 minutes in the oven. 
I generally followed the recipe except that the apples I used were quite small, so I used two. I also had to use glutenfree flour instead for the sake of several colleagues. That gives a slightly different consistency I think. I'll have to try this again with regular flour to compare. In any case, the cake was moist and light, and tasted great!
Also I ran out of milk so topped up with pressed apple juice which gave the whole cake a nice apple flavour. 
Definitely saving this recipe for future use! Thanks a bunch!
(I made it again since for someone allergic to milk protein, so substituted butter with coconut butter, and milk with pressed apple juice. Success, again!)

Used two apples instead of just one and added 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts to the brown sugar mixture.  Wound up baking for 60 minutes.
My kids loved it and I thought it was pretty good too.

Made exactly according to the recipe, it good, just not what I expected.  Next time I will use more apples, change to half milk, half veg oil and bake in a shallow baking pan then add a tasty glaze.

I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it and made it in 2 loaf pans. I brought one into work and one for home. IT WAS A HIT!!! I cooked them for about 40 mins and they came out sponge like which is how i like them. I might add more apple  and cinnamon next time (the more the better for me). WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!

Made recipe as described and turned out tasty. I need to distribute apples better next time. They were clumped more to center of cake which caused center to cook slower (45-48mins) thus leaving me with dried out ends and corners. This was definitely a novice baking error and I will definitely try again!

I needed to bake mine for 60 minutes though.

I've made 4 of these now and they all turned out fantastic. I've never been a baker because I thought it was too hard to bake from scratch, but after making these I've changed my mind. I am getting lots of requests to make this cake and received lots of compliments. I followed the recipe exactly with the first one, but with the other 3 I used 2 apples instead of 1 and it turned out a lot moister and tastier.

I made it the way some one suggested with apple sauce.  I also use egg beaters since my husband can't eat egg yolks.  For the changes I made it still turned out great.

I have made this a few times now. My husband really likes it. I use a little less sugar and only 3/4 stick of butter. I also use 2 apples and I mix them with the brown sugar & cinnamon before adding to cake batter. I have also had to bake a little longer, It is delicious!

It was okay; I could taste the baking powder.  Only change was that I used whole wheat flour.  It wasn't anywhere near done after 35 minutes.  Had to bake it 60 minutes.  Doubt I'll make it again.

This was the driest, impossible to even swallow cake I have ever made.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 0 because the taste of cinnamon and apple was good but the white cake itself...yuck.

We tried this, adding two apples (fairly tart ones) instead of one, and cut back on the white sugar by about 2T.  It was perfect!  Moist without being wet and nicely sweet.  We decided it'd be a great breakfast cake!  Next time we'll add a touch more cinnamon (not that it needs it ... we just like it a bunch!).

I can't recommend this highly enough. Perfect for that transition of late summer into early autumn. Wrap it up after it cools and stash it in the fridge - it just gets moister and more delish. I added about 1/2 cup toasted walnuts to the apple layers, but that's the only thing I did differently from the recipe. It's really so good.

Was the first real cake that I did, before I did just "box cake". And I loved it, and I will do again. Actually, I did 1 and 1/2 recipes.

I made this cake after receiving my current issue of allrecipes magazine (September/October 2015) This was a great find, as I had all the ingredients on hand. Toasted some chopped walnuts and added 1 teaspoon of salt. Excellent recipe! So easy and so good!!

I decided to make this after seeing it in the Allrecipes magazine. I did 3 tblsp of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of sugar. I used a fuji apple and added 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts to the brown sugar. It is really soft and probably would have been better baked in a small square pan, if even having to do 1 1/2 times the recipe. It is fine for a breakfast type cake, just a little too sweet for my personal taste even with reducing the sugar as suggested in reviews.

I made this recipe for the first time this morning.  It was amazing!  Loved it...and I'm pretty picky.  I used yellow delicious apples.  I did follow some of the other suggestions, and added 1 tsp of salt.  I also used 50% more of the cinnamon & brown sugar mixture.  I'm not sure this was necessary, but it sure tasted good.  When I make this in the future, I will also use a strip of parchment paper in the base with the ends of the paper hanging out the sides, to help in getting the loaf out, to cool on a rack.  You may also want to line the bottom of your oven with a little foil.  I had a couple spots bubble over.  It does rise significantly in the oven.  Mine needed 75 minutes to cook completely.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

My family loves this cake, but the recipe is not enough.  Rather than make two loaves, I decided to try something else.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt pan.  I had to increase the cooking time about 10 minutes.  It came out just as good and looked terrific!

I absolutely love this recipe. I do a lot of baking and this has become one of my families very favorite. I would only add one suggestion and that would be to double the recipe, because it will be gone in no time. :D

Well it could have used more apples and brown sugar cinnamon on the inside. It does taste good though. Next time I will put some apples in the batter too. And I used a white glass loaf pan which took a lot longer to cook.

Delicious recipe!  No apples on hand, so I used a can of apple pie filling and I added all spices included in the recipe.  Heated up caramel sauce and spooned over warmed up cake.  Husband really liked it.  Thank you Jinglebells for delicious recipe!  It's a keeper!

I had to cook this a lot longer than recommended and that could be one of the reasons it turned out so dry.  The toothpick, when inserted in the middle, would not come out clean. Others commented about it's dryness.  It also was not sweet enough for my taste.

Delicious! The cake is moist and bursting with cinnamon and apple flavor! Serve with vanilla ice cream for a heavenly treat. I would add 1 teaspoon of salt to really make the flavors pop and more apple because I love that apple in every bite taste. This cake is fantastic though! Thanks for the recipe!

This is good, but not 5 stars. I think I will keep on making different apple muffin/cake recipes during Apple season, Bake time was off a bit. It was hard to tell without actually touching the cake, I left it in 48 mins. No undercooked spots in the middle.Nothing stood out to me not the texture, nor the flavor.

Used less sugar as per another review (also used ALL brown sugar), and it came out perfect :) Wasn't sure which apples to use, so I picked up some Paula Reds and they were nice and sweet/tart, and they held up nicely in the oven. Next time, will try Honey Crisp apples. It took over an hour to fully bake. I also added some walnuts for texture and crunch. This is the perfect Fall dessert/snack that goes really well with coffee. Everyone loved it!

I made this as a mid-evening snack for my family following the recipe exactly. They absolutely loved it! It was so flavorful and moist! My 12 year old grandson liked it so much that he asked if I would make it for his birthday cake next year.

I added a little kosher salt to enhance the flavor and doubled the amount of apples, which added to the baking time.  It is fabulous!

My new go to dish! I used a Macintosh apple. Very moist and delicious tasting. I made this for a potluck for work. Will try applesauce as substitute next time. Thank you for healthy tip!

I made this for the first time last year...my bf is a type one diabetic so we try to make things as low sugar as possible... when I made this I used splenda instead of the white sugar we loved it... it's a keeper!! I make it all the time and it will be passed down to my children

I followed the recipe, did not make any changes.  My hubby loved it.  I thought it needed to be more sweet, perhaps more cinnamon.  I will make it again and tweek it to my preferences...perhaps a little more butter to make it more moist as well as more sugar and cinnamon.

YUM! I really loved this recipe! made a couple small changes - first off, I cooked it in a bundt cake pan and it worked out really well (it wasn't as "deep" as it probably is in the bread pan but it worked). I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the actual cake mixture, too, to give it a wee cinnamon boost, since I love cinnamon. I also added a teaspoon of Kosher Salt to bring out the flavors, and I used Soy Milk instead of regular milk (we just prefer it), and cooked it at 350 for about 45 minutes - everything else I did exactly as the recipe suggested and it turned out moist & DEEELICIOUS! my family could have mowed down the entire thing in one sitting - I'm saving this to my recipe box and will definitely make it again (might add a tiny bit more apple next time, too ;-)) - thanks for the great recipe, Jinglebells!

I rarely give a recipe 5 stars, but this one is absolutely delicious. Cooking time should be at least 45-50 minutes. Next time I will add an extra apple and cut out a little bit of the sugar.

Doubled recipe. Used half whole wheat flour half rolled oats. Added flax seed and used an extra apple plus coconut milk. It was superb. My hubby said I needed to open a bakery!

Very good! Moist & delicious. Took about 45-50 min to bake. We used 1/2c unsweetened applesauce to replace the butter. Will definitely hold on to this recipe!

This recipe was great!  I used parchment paper in the loaf pan and it did not stick.  We used apples from our tree!  I would definitely make it again.  I used a tiny bit less sugar and baked for 50 minutes in a glass loaf pan.

I made this recipe with the following changes: increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tablespoon, switched half the white sugar for brown, added another chopped apple (I used granny smith), and baked it for an hour. Even with those changes, this bread was still lacking. It wasn't dry, but the whole thing just tastes bland. There isn't enough sweetness in the batter to compliment the tartness of the GS apples. I couldn't taste the cinnamon or brown sugar in the middle ofthe bread either. Mine had a nice, moist texture, but that's really the only positive aspect about it. If I were to make it again, I would add salt and more sugar to the batter and increase the cinnamon, maybe mixing a tsp into the batter itself.

This was a nice coffee type cake. Could have been more moist, It was a little dry and crumbly. I have another apple cake recipe that calls for oil instead of butter and I may try that the next time. I topped with a buttermilk glaze after it came out of the oven and was still in the pan. In my opinion this made the cake. This cake was still raw in the center at 40 minutes, so per other reviews I baked for 60 minutes. Its a nice cake, not overly sweet.
I would like to tweak this recipe a little on the next attempt before I decide if it's a keeper.

The taste is great (if you're like me and don't like rich desserts). Took 50 minutes to bake though, and we had to put foil on the edges after 40 minutes to keep them from burning. The center just doesn't want to cook very well, and by the time it's cooked through, the outside is over done, so it crumbles apart if you don't take a slice out really really carefully. I would say it's good enough to try again, but it tastes too similar to a cinnamon bundt cake my family makes, so we might just make cake in the future instead.

It was okay and it had good flavor but it definitely needed more cooking time. I had to cover the top in foil as it was starting to burn while the inside was all batter. Flavor was good once finished cooking however it was very crumbly.

This is a great white cake recipe and I can see it being very versatile. I have however made it a handful of times and have always had to bake it closer to 60 minutes instead of the 40 mins the recipe states. At first I thought it was a fluke- but I've made this in 3 different ovens, two electric, one gas. I've also used an oven thermometer to check my temperature.  But other than that- it's a FABULOUS delicious recipe. It's great to use up that last sad looking apple in the crisper. lol

I've made this twice. First time I followed the recipe exactly but tonight I doubled the recipe to make a loaf pan & a 9” round cake pan. I substituted unsweetened natural applesauce for the butter. Very easy to make. Will definitely bookmark this recipe. Thanks for sharing, Jinglebells!

Loved this recipe!  It is not only delicious, but it is also very easy to make.  I did not change anything about the recipe, but like other reviews, I too had to cook it longer.  Actually, I cooked it for a full hour before it was completely done.

I made this today and did follow recipe exactly. I think next time though i will add more apple, one wasn't enough to me, but the cake still good. FYI, to anyone that lives in high altitudes: you need to bake at least 50-55 minutes.

It took quite a bit longer to bake to be done all the way through (added about 17 minutes), but this is a great recipe otherwise. The cake is flavorful and moist, and the apples are perfectly cooked and caramelized. Great with a cup of coffee!

I made two of these today, one in an aluminum pan, it was very tasty, the only thing that concerned me was how thick the batter was. It didn't matter the bread/cake was moist and airy. I haven't tried the second one, but it raised more, (baked in a glass pan) I believe it will just as good.

Amazing!!!  My family loves anything apple so after I read this recipe I knew I had to make it. I added an extra apple and a 1/2 cup toasted pecans. I baked it in an  8.5 x  8.5" pan for between 45-50 minutes. Everyone who had some loved it. It was moist and delicious! It will now be a regular at our house.

Yummy! My husband and son both heartily approved of this cake. I did replace some of the butter with applesauce and I threw in a few chopped blanched almonds. I used a 9 x 5 like the recipe says and it came out fine, nice and pleasantly rounded on top.  I did have to bake it slightly longer than the time indicated.

Very sweet..one question. It was a bit too dark when removed from oven. Took a bit longer to bake. Now, should or can I use a glass pan instead of metal?

This bread was very good although a little bit dry. Mine took a whopping 1 hour and 15 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean. After reading some of the reviews, I added walnuts per what others were saying. The apple, walnut, cinnamon sugar layers were to die for. I made this for my boss's birthday and since we work at a dairy, we topped it with vanilla soft serve ice cream. I didn't even notice the slight dryness when it was paired with the ice cream. This recipe is a keeper!

I, too, found that the timing was off by about 7 minutes.  The cake is perfect, otherwise.  It is easy to make and tastes delicious.  I will try using applesauce with my next venture. I also added some chopped pecans just to jazz it up a bit.  My husband really likes sweets, so this is right up his alley.  Thank you, Jinglebells .

Really good.  It did take much longer to bake than the recipe said.  Might be good with apple butter spread on the slices or maybe cream cheese.

Mad this exactly by the recipe. Came out good. Testing doneness is not easy with cooked apples and brown sugar and cinnamon all baking together.

I enjoyed this recipe but I fount that 1 apple did not give it the flavor I would have liked.  I'll be adding 2 chopped apples the next time.
