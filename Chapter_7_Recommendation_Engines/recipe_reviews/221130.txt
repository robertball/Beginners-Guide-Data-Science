Terrific! Made as written using Mazzetta Sweet Cherry Peppers. Could not find butter beans so I substituted with Cannellini. Also had about 6 large button mushrooms which I quartered and added with the artichoke. I would say that this had medium heat, which suits my wife and me just fine.  Will definitely make again.

This was fantastic!  In spite of what the chef says, Peppadew peppers are the real secret ingredient.  Don't be tempted to use cherry peppers, it will not be the same and not in a good way!

If you like hot spicy food this is a must! The only thing I did differently is cut the chicken off the bone and added it to the soup instead of pouring the soup over the chicken leg. I also used a little extra chicken broth to make it more like a soup. It was awesome would make it again!

Ok so this would have been 5 stars but had to knock a couple off for the following reasons. First of all when browning the chicken DO NOT cook on high unless you want your house to turn into a hot box with all the smoke. Instead cook on low for about 10 mins per side. I did as the chef instructed and it smoked like crazy. The other thing is this dish is way too spicy for me. The peppers ruin the dish.

This is a tasty recipe that's great to use up leftover rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli. I made broth from the bones and used all the leftover chicken for the dish. It's just my wife and I, so we had plenty of chicken left. We have Hungarian hot wax peppers growing in the garden so used those instead of cherry peppers. Other than that, followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out great! Definitely keeping this recipe.

Great recipe. I doubled the red pepper, that was a mistake. Looking forward to making this again. Next time I will be less generous with the broth, drain the artichoke mixture and just splash the chicken.

Made it exactly as written then served it in bowls over couscous so it ate as a kind of soup. Absolutely delicious. Even my picky children liked it! (They just didn't eat the peppers.) But the broth was so tasty!

Way to much lemon and I only used 1. Other than that this was a tasty different dish.

This is a great recipe. I made it with cherry peppers, minus the beans since I did not have any in the house, and it was absolutely delicious. I had enough for leftovers which I made over white rice. This was even better as the rice absorbed the delicious sauce. Going forward, I'll make it with white rice.

Go light on the red pepper flakes and add only half the broth for a hearty, but not too spicy dish.

This came out very pretty and tasted lovely. The only thing I did different was using a 12oz jar of red and yellow fire roasted peppers and a 12oz jar of roasted whole Piquillo peppers because I couldn't find cherry peppers. I quartered them to keep in proportion with the artichokes.  Cesar Salad with crispy bread and a glass of wine made for a pleasant evening! Thanks Chef! *you know it's good when the BF makes leftovers for his lunch ;)

Definitely cook the chicken low and slow instead.  Other than that a wonderful recipe.

I used canned artichoke hearts to save time. Otherwise followed as written. Family enjoyed including kiddos. Will definitely make this one again.

Cut back the red pepper to ¼ teaspoon, substituted peppadews for cherry peppers and added a sweet red pepper. Absolutely delicious!

Wow! Another great one for our family. It's definitely a more citrusy flavor with the lemon and artichokes, but the flavor in my opinion is killer! As you know, Chef John likes heat so take that into consideration when you chose your peppers and amount of pepper flakes. I've learned how to adjust his amount to my family.  But it you're looking for a light soup with some well flavored chicken, this is it!

Followed the recipe closely. The meat had great flavor! When I asked my two kids (19 and 15) if I should make it again, I didn't get much response either way. That's typical of them.  Next time I might serve it less like a soup, more like a meat with side of vegs.  Hmmm.... How can I re-use all the delicious broth/ sauce I have left over?! Marinate chicken breasts and then grill?

I made this recipe with yellow peppers (because that was what we had) and used chicken thighs, bone in.   Husband and I were over the moon!  The flavor was delicious, unusual and just the right amount of heat.  The depth of flavors was a surprise.  We will definitely make again!!  ...maybe tonight.

I have made this a few times, each time making minor changes. I recommmend you cut back to 1 tsp. black pepper and add more at the end if desired. I have made it with hot cherry peppers and peppadews but  my favorite pepper for this is Mezzetta Sweet Cherry Peppers (they are mildly hot so I double the amount called for). This recipe is awesome. We love spicy food so we always try Chef John's recipes. We are rarely disappointed. I'm fixing it again tonight adding small red potatoes.
