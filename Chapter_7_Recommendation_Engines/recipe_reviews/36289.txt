I was nervous after reading the reviews that it was going to be too spicy but it was definitely not!  Great flavor and not too much even though it seems like so much seasoning.  It was raining so we couldn't grill so instead of broiling we baked them in the oven on 350 degrees for an hour and 20 minutes.  Will definitely be making this again,

This is a wonderful recipe and even my daughter who hates "Little chickens" liked this one. I changed it a bit as I usually do with recipes and since it was raining and about 40 degrees, grilling was not an option. I mixed all everything together and made a glaze(I skipped the oil)I brushed all my game hens with the glaze and baked them.Wonderful!!

The flavor was fantastic, but oh my gosh, it was so fiery hot, I could hardly eat it. And this was after cutting both the red pepper and black pepper in half. My husband loved it. I will definitely make it again, but I will cut the pepper way, way down to accommodate my tender Minnesota mouth! Instad of grilling outside, I roasted these in the oven at 350 degrees for about 1 hour 15 minutes. A very easy and delicious way to make game hens.

This recipe was just wonderful!!!  We grilled them outside and my husband just couldn't stop raving about the flavor.  Definitely adjust the pepper to your taste; I cut the red pepper in half and they still had a kick.  One tip though, if you find that you've got them a little too spicy, heat up some more of the maple syrup and dip the chicken in it - it cuts the spice perfectly.  I also added onion powder and a little salt.  All in all, this was a great recipe that I'm definitely putting in my book!

Tried this recipe last night. Unbelievable! My father is the toughest food connoisseur I have ever known. To see him sit there and literally gulp down these hens was the best compliment I've gotten from him in years! So, I asked him, "Dad, on a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate this recipe?" and he answered, "A solid 4!"

Have made this several times. I have never just grilled this, I pop it in the oven on 350 for 
45-60 minutes, basting on and off and then finish it off on the grill, basting, for about 10 minutes per side so the syrup glazes. I'm always afraid it will be dry but this way is always tender and juicy. I'll have to be brave one time and just grill it. We like spicy, so it was not too spicy for us. One of my favorite BBQ recipes, YUMMM Thanks.

There seemed to be such a large amount of spice, but I followed the recipe, exactly, and LOVED it!  My husband did also. This will be our new guest special dish!!!

THis was the first time I used the broiler and I loved it.  However, the maple syrup only stays on the skin and doesn't get absorbed by the meat.  Maybe the syrup should stay on for a couple of hours before broiling.

good, not a wow though.  The spices are very good, but stay on the skin and not the meat.

This has got to be the most flavor bursting cornish hen recipe I've ever had. It had so much taste to it, and so many different flavors. My husband and I loved this. The syrup kind of glazes the whole hen. This was positively wonderful! I am constantly having to tell my husband to wait a while before we have it again, because he wants to make it every other day!

These were easy, affordable, and delicious!  I skipped the maple syrup altogether, and we were very pleased with the outcome.  We only ate one hen the first night, and I used the meat from the second hen for "the-spiciest-home-made-chicken-soup-ever" later that week!

My fiance and I absolutely hated this recipe.  I think that it definitely needs sweetness to counteract the spice, but maple syrup was NOT the way to go.  It just didn't taste right.  Maybe honey would work better.

This is one of my new favorite recipe's. We loved the combination of spices contrasted with the maple syrup. Beware of broiling times however, the recipe calls for 12-14 minutes in an oven on Broil and mine almost caught fire. I would follow the recipe and bake them at 350 or 375 degrees or grill them.

A very nice blend of spices- the maple syrup complements it perfectly. (I'm keeping a jar of the spice mix to try on other things as well!)

I was a little nervous about the spice mix and quantity that is rubbed on the hen, but it turned out great.  My husband made them on the grill and our guests were very pleased.

This recipe was really good.  As others have said, it is very hot.  My husband LOVED it.  We think it would be very good on wings or on regular chicken breasts.  I think I will try to make it milder in the future, just to have a different version.  Changes I made:  1. replaced the maple syrup with honey 2. baked uncovered at 350 degrees for 1 hour (added the honey in the last 15 min.)

Very good recipe.  I tried it on a full sized chicken rather than the cornish game hens, but used the same seasoning.  I would make it again, but perhaps with a little bit less cumin.  I felt the cumin overpowered some of the other seasonings.

WOW!!!! This recipe is awesome. Tested first on chicken wings. Loved the mixture of flavors and so very moist. This one is a definite keeper. Will try on Cornish Hens next. Followed recipe exactly.
