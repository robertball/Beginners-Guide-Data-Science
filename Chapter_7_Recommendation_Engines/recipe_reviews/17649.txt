I give the recipe itself 3 stars, but my version gets 5 stars. I increased the butter in the mix to 3 sticks instead of one.  I used butter flavored shortening. Along with the vanilla extract I put a tablespoon of pineapple extract. I increased the sugar to 3 cups instead of 1 1/2 and I used a cup of evarporated milk.

I'm sorry, but I thought this cake was rather dry. It also wasn't very sweet, nor could you taste the pineapple in it very much. The only pineapple you could taste was in the glaze that went on top. I will not make it again.

This is a wonderful pineapple pound cake!  I did not have any problems with it.  I did not have a tube pan, so I used more of a loaf pan.  It is similar to what a friend used to make for us.  I liked this version very much too.  We froze the second loaf for later.

This cake is easy to make and not just a plain pound cake.  The glaze is very tasty. Makes a large cake that goes a long ways.

Very good!  The cake part is not that sweet, the topping is extremely sugary and overall it balances out. But next time I will reduce the amount of sugar on the topping out of personal preference. Will definitely make again!

I found this recipe and I couldn't wait to try it...I finally baked this cake and I was not happy with the results.  I feel like I wasted 2 sticks of butter and 6 eggs!! I could not taste the  pineapple in the cake and I baked it for a little over an hour. I will not bake this cake again. It was dry and not very tasty. My apologies go out to the person who admitted this one.

This was not one of my favorite recipes.  You can't taste the pinapple in the cake, only in the glaze.  The prep. was no trouble and it came out perfectly in a bundt pan, but probably would just make a plain pound cake next time and serve with the glaze on the side.

Good recipe, heavy cake.  I baked it in an angel food pan, next time I will us the bundt pan.  I couldn't get the ring out of the middle.  I baked in convection, 300 for 1 hour 20 minutes.  Makes a lot of cake.  thanks

This cake is wonderful and I get rave reviews whenever I make it. The amount of sugar should be 2 3/4 cups. It's good with or without the glaze.

I prepared this cake according to the recipe and it did not come out too well.  It was not done after 90 minutes.  What I did taste of it was very bland.  If I try it again, I'll use pineapple flavoring and possibly more butter to give it a better taste.

I originally got this cake recipe from an airline cookbook that my mother brought home back in the 70's.  This recipe has always been a hit for me when I started making it in my teens and I still have photocopies of the original recipe to this day.  I absolutely love this recipe and always get glowing comments whenever I make it.  To be honest, when I saw it on Allrecipes I had a good chuckle with myself because people would always want the recipe and I tried to keep it as my well hidden secret.  Even though I know people always like to add their own love to it but actually the recipe is great as is.  Much love to this recipe.

Had pineapple chunks which I puréed. Not overly sweet but that's how I like it. My daughters made it while I was on standby. Cane sugar instead of white and butter flavor shortening. Will make again.

After reading a few reviews,  I decided to make my own recipe using more sugar, a teaspoon of lemon juice along with the vanilla extract. I omitted the baking powder (actually I forgot about it). Prepared the glaze as follows and it turned out amazing! So delicious!

I make this same pound cake, but my recipe calls for 2 3/4 cups white sugar. That may be the reason some of the reviewers have found it not sweet enough. Also, when you add the pineapple you just fold it in gently so you can see the little bits of pineapple in it when you serve it.

I have to agree with others...this cake is NOT sweet enough and a little on the dry side.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I won't use the recipe again.  Sorry!
