I got the link to this in my email today, and decided to try it for dinner tonight. I used Hormel Crumbled Bacon, since I keep that in the freezer, and just sautéed it up with the onion and butter. The recipe was easy and turned out great! I decided to add some cheese to it, as well as having it as a garnish, plus I added a little more salt. I mashed half of the potatoes, and that was perfect. My husband said the recipe was a keeper, and he’s a foodie, so that’s a big compliment! It’s definitely going in my recipe rotation. :)
