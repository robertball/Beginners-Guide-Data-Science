I usually don't try out recipes with no reviews, but this was the only gingersnap recipe here that had crystallized ginger.  I had fallen in love with Whole Foods gingersnaps, which were very spicy and had bits of crystallized ginger in them.  Unfortunately, they stopped making it so I had to try it out on my own.  These cookies weren't as spicy as what I wanted, but were still very yummy, and I love the added texture of the ginger.  I rolled some in sugar and some not, and I prefer the non-sugared cookies.  The ginger flavor came out better.  *Hint:  The only crystallized ginger in my grocery store was the McCormick's brand, which costs over $8 for a tiny jar, enough for 1 recipe.  I ended up getting some at an asian market, where a $1 package gave me enough ginger for at least 2, if not 3, batches.
