This recipe was absolutely *sinful* and I truly do not say that about many recipes, especially deserts because I'm more of a savory lover.

******This recipe requires REGULAR sized Marshmellows for anyone just as confused as I was******

I made a double batch to go along side a Thanksgiving feast.  If you were just making a desert for a normal dinner night, or to host a few friends over, then a single batch will do you just fine for about 6 people.  Remember though- this was sinfully good so you might want to do a double anyway for second helpings and take aways.

Tips:
~When combining marshmellows, pumpkin and milk in saucepan Stir Stir Stir.  Seriously- don't leave the stove, just stand there and stir on really low heat for 5-10 minutes.  It will stick, it will burn, it will lump if you don't.  
~Even when this mixture is cooling stop to stir it every minute or so to avoid the "pudding skin" effect which will lump up your mix.
~I used less than an 1/8 tsp of Clove, Nutmeg and Cinnamon for mixture for a double batch.
~This recipe is PLENTY sweet from the Marshmellows.  I did as recipe stated and used the Conf. sugar in my whipped cream and I have to say it simply wasn't necessary.  If anything it made the mouse just a touch too sweet so either put less of it or skip it all together.

This recipe was super easy to make, quick, cheap and decadent.  It's something I will make again and again in a pinch.  Very light and fluffy- tastes just like pumpkin pie.

I made this for a housewarming party the other night and it was a HUGE success. I've never made mousse with marshmallows before and I was a bit skeptical at first, but it was super easy to make and the texture was perfect.  I'm adding this to my Thanksgiving menu from now on.

I had exactly a half cup of pumpkin left over from making muffins this morning--this recipe was PERFECT. Because I do not keep heavy cream on hand, I did use cold evaporated milk instead. I made no other changes. I actually poured this into a homemade graham cracker crust and stuck it in the freezer for a frozen pie for after dinner. We did not eat the pie yet but we all fought over licking the spoon after I finished the mousse. SO. AMAZING.

I tried this dish out for a gathering of friends last year, and it was such a big hit that the director of the nonprofit we're all involved in asked me to bring it to the charity auction to sell! I made 30 cups, asking $1.00 each--we sold out in 15 minutes. I've made it for every special event since, including my son's fourth birthday party two months ago. You wouldn't think little boys would have a palate for mousse, especially pumpkin mousse, but they absolutely loved it.

This was great ~ like pumpkin pie whipped cream! For the milk I used 1/2 half n half and 1/2 skim because I did not have whole milk. To get the heavy cream to whip nicely I put the beaters and the cream in the freezer for about 10 minutes prior to beating, fastest whipped cream ever! Made ahead and served inside crepes topped with additional whipped cream the next day. The mousse was a delight on its own.

This isn't something I'd make often, but I did enjoy it and it was a change of pace.  I was whisking the pumpkin mixture every 5 min or so while it was cooling, but it did develop some small lumps that detracted from the overall texture of the finished dessert.

Like the great review by yubbers123, I used a SAUCEPAN (thank you, not a SKILLET like the recipe called for).  I stirred on low for 10 minutes then about every 5-10 min during cooling period. I DOUBLED the batch and served in 8-oz decorative glasses like the original recipe pic shows. I got ONLY EIGHT 3/4 cup servings (6oz). I served in decorative 8oz glasses on salad plates with pound cake (which myMother-in-law insisted on bringing) sliced in half topped with a small dollop of fresh whipped cream & sprinkled with Vietnamese cinnamon. Since I had the cake with whipped cream, I put only crushed ginger snaps on top of the mousse (thanks Dawn G).  Super easy, delicious dessert and looks nice too. With or without the pound cake, the 6 oz serving was MORE than enough since this is quite rich. Oh, put bowl & beaters in fridge with bag of ice in it to chill quickly, then use bowl for whipping the cream. Tried posting a pic but for some reason tells me it's too small (??!!)

Quick, Easy...and...I might add 'Delicious'.  Followed recipe except I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used TruWhip (an healthier alternative to Cool Whip).  I topped with a little cinnamon.  Next time I want to  put it into suggested chocolate shells and top it with little gingerbread men.  Thanks Kristin for a tasty, but easy recipe that can be thrown together quickly and still make a great impression on guests....and hubby!

Delish! I doubled the recipe and eliminated the conf sugar, and it was perfect! Enough for 12-16 people easy (if there is another pie available for variety)

My guests enjoyed this but I felt it was very sweet.  I also had the hardest time finding chocolate cups.  In the end I just used what I thought were the same glasses as shown in the picture.

I followed the recipe to the letter It states it serves 10 but what I got to serve was less than 1/2 cup for 4 servings, hardly making a dent in the glasses I purchased, which weren’t large..  Extra whip cream on top would have been nice to cut the sweetness as shown in the picture but not in the instructions.

Says it feeds 10.   

Sorry I won’t be making it again.

This was really easy and good. I love pumpkin anything but was sceptical about the marshmallows. They worked great and they didn’t take away from the taste of pumpkin. I filled some baked tart shells with the mousse and everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty easy to make. Tastes great, not too sweet but an awesome texture.  Would recommend making more as I don't know how this is considered 10 servings. Cheers!

I really loved the spices, and the texture was perfect, but it was way too sweet on its own (and I have a pretty serious sweet tooth, so that's saying a lot about how sweet it was). After tasting, I wanted to use it to frost cupcakes or cookies, something a little blander to temper the overpowering sweet and spice of the mousse. Next time I will try without the confectioner's sugar.

I didn't have any pumpkin spice, so I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Instead of regular milk I used almond milk.

I was going to make pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, but decided this would be more fun and different. I didn't have any pie spice, so I made my own and used some cloves, which tasted and smelled terrific. In the end, I was somewhat disappointed with the finished amount of mousse I wound up with, and in the future I'll double the recipe, but that is my only complaint. It was delicious, rich, and my kids absolutely loved it.

This tasted alright, but I'm not sure if I'd make it again, the reason being the marshmallows gave it a texture that I was not a fan of, and it seemed a bit heavier/dense than mousses I am used to (I am also not a fan of marshmallows in general, though, so perhaps this is why I didn't like that aspect of it). It  is quick and easy, though, which is a definite plus. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I just mixed some cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and a little nutmeg and ginger.

Flavor is great but only gave it 4 stars because serving size is off.  Made 1.5 times recipe but only got 7 servings.

Loved this recipe, and so did others !  Easy to make, and I put cranberries on top of extra whipped crème that it called for.  What a hit !

Used chocolate chips instead of the bowl.  Great!

So easy and delicious, a great substitute for pumpkin pie.
