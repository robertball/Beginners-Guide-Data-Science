This is my second attempt at brining. Once you get the hang of it(like most things) ....it's so simple! My daughter doesn't usually like turkey because it's usually dry. But after the first turkey .....she was like "MoM! You have to make it like this FOREVER" it was so good. Can't wait to see how this one comes out. Thanks for the garlic idea too!

THE BEST brine I've ever used. All of my guests said the turkey was the best one they'd ever had (8 guests)!!  After brining, I let the turkey sit for 2 hours put butter under the skin, olive oil all over the top with salt and pepper. Took an apple and put 1/2 in the neck cavity and half inside the bird along with 1/2 an onion, fresh sage, rosemary and thyme and baked a 20 pound turkey for 4 1/2 hours. The additional thing I do is take.all the giblets and the neck and put them In a small saucepan with salt and pepper and water. I use that to baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and continue to add water as I use it back to the cooking giblets and neck. 

This makes the best gravy juice as well.

Good stuff. We soaked our bird in this for about 24 hours.  I rubbed olive oil on the turkey and put black pepper on it before I indirect grilled it on my Weber kettle grill. Absolutely fantastic!

Everyone thought it was the best Turkey they had ever eaten.
I also smoked the turkey after a 10 hour brine.  Smoked at low heat  (160F for 3 hours) then raised temp to 300F unit thermometer read 170F.  Was perfect.

I had brined my turkey before but always bought the brine kit.  This Thanksgiving, I decided to make it at home.  I had all the ingredients at home already for this recipe.  I am so glad, well we were all so glad I made it.  I followed it to the T.  I added ice instead of cold water, placed it in a plastic bucket and left it outside - I live in NYC and it was a cold night.  It was a small turkey this year and I had less time to brine it, so I left it in for 12 hours.  So so juice and flavorful!!!

I followed it 100% as written, and it was very good. Will I make it again? Sure! I would add garlic next time, but thats a personal preference  for our family. 
It made the turkey just how I wanted it (tender, juicy etc). I have been nervous about brining (others in the family have done it with excellent results) and I was kinda nervous.  I was pleased with the experience and the family said it was really good. 
One of the best things about this? It wasn't a list of oddball ingredients that I would only use for this single recipe. Everything was on hand and it was easy peasy. 
Thanks for sharing!

We weren't  huge turkey fans.  Thanksgiving was enough. This brine made our turkey so spectacular that we're now turkey fans and will be making them often.

so I used this brine this year and it was PERFECT. I had a 23lb turkey and I needed to compensate for the size. the amount here I think is perfect for a smaller turkey but for a larger you need to double. that's what I did and I substituted the second gallon of water with apple juice and it was the best decision of my life!!!

Made this exactly as instructed, cooked previously frozen turkeys in an infrared turkey "fryer" (charbroil big easy) and they were delicious. So many people commented and asked for recipe.
