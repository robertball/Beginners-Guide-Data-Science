Here is my Momo tip of the day that got rave reviews from my guest. prepare as instructed but instead of steaming get a nice large non stick skillet on medium heat with a couple Tbls of light oil like EVOO. Place the dumplings in the hot skillet  large side down and cook without turning 5 minutes until brown. get a nice tight fitting lid then drizzle a couple of TBLS of water into skillet and slap the lid on let cook for another 5 min or so... Oh Man! Make a nice spicy-sweet dipping sauce and you are rockin! serve em hot! Good luck keeping up with the demand!

I originally reviewed this recipe and gave it lower rating, but I did some research.  I really like this recipe and I love the flavor, filling, etc., plus it's easy to make and calls for stuff you have around the house.  BUT - when you steam them, YUCK!  The wrappers look gross, and they stick together, rip apart, etc.  That was what made this UNuseful to me.  Maybe this little piece of information will help:  when you steam these, you either need to space them apart so they are not touching, OR you need to oil the wonton wrapper (or egg roll wrappers, if you use bigger ones, like I did) so they won't stick.  I am excited to try this again.

Momos are actually form Nepal. Instead of onions if you fry shallot till golden and mix it with the meat it'll taste better.  Plus there is a different dipping sauce for momos  fry some  cut tomatoes till the its kinda dry ( you might want to add some water in the pot to take the tomato stuck in the pot out )  and blend it with some fresh cilantro fried garlic chilies and salt to taste. Add some sesame seeds before blending to make the sauce a bit thick so that it sticks to the momos. If you go to some indian store you can buy some spices for momo to add flavor.

When steaming: I lived in China and when my friends steamed they used bamboo steamers and oiled the wood - I also observed some using oiled cheese cloth as a layer on the bottom of the steamers. Hope it helps.

Very tasty!  For the filling I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used 1T of dried cilantro instead.  Also for the dipping sauce I didn't have chile oil but did have hot chile paste so I used 2t vegetable oil and 1t chile paste.  

The only problem I had was steaming them.  I had a lot of them and used egg roll wrappers instead of wonton -- the wrappers were really thin and stuck fast to the metal of the steamer tray, and to each other.  So they tasted good but kind of fell apart when I tried to take them out.  I will experiment more with this (different folding method or cooking longer, or cooking uncovered instead of covered) because the recipe was good enough for me to want more!

Authentic momos would not be made with beef as many people from this area of the world are Hindus.  Try using ground chicken, goat or pork.  Cumin is also a necessity to differentiate it from goyza or Chinese dumplings.  Also, momo is made with round wraps and not the square won ton wraps called for in this recipe.

I tried a different approach.  I cooked the ingredients together first. I then spooned them into the round wrappers.  I baked them in the oven on a cookie sheet just until the edges were brown.  They were good but needed a sweet dipping sauce.

These came out really yummy!   Dumplings are one of those things that I just crave sometimes, and these were made with things that I normally have in the pantry anyway!  I steamed half like was suggested and then pan-fried half in about 3 Tbls. vegetable oil because I didn't want to wait another 30 mins.  Both were equally delicious.  The fried took about 7 minutes.  Thanks Lee!

Very good recipe and very easy to make.  Very close to what I was served at at tibetian tea.  I have also used dumpling wrappers from the local asian market.  If you take the momos out while they're hot you can give them a quick coat of oil to keep them from sticking.  Keep them spaced in the steamer to avoid any sticking.  We prefer using sweet Thai chili sauce for dipping.  All around a very good recipe.

I made this for my traditional New Years eve dinner as the appetizer. I used Hot Chili Sauce instead of Chili oil. Where I live you do a lot of substitutions.  Did'nt know how to make finalize the Won Tons so I made them into purses with the four corners coming together.  Also doubled the sauce recipe to give everyone plenty.  All loved them and asked for the recipe.

I followed the suggestion to fry and then steam and they turned out WONDERFUL! I also just steamed them and they were pretty good too. The baking method (which I also tried) didn't turn out all that well. Any way you do it though, they have great flavor. My question is: How did anybody get all that mix into 12 wrappers?!

I thought that the recipe was very good.  I had trouble with the wrappers because it they all stuck together.  The dipping sauce was a bit too spicy for my family, so for those who don't like things too spicy, I suggest using half the chili oil.

Store bought pot stickers can't even come close to the flavor of these. Whole house absolutely loved them. Only I used gyoza wrappers instead of wonton wrappers. I used a little extra ginger in the last few momo's and I quite liked it better, and I don't even like ginger! I would recommend using more ginger in the whole mix. Which I can't believe I'm typing. 4 stars!

Oh my mouth is on FIRE with the sauce, but the momos are a cool find! I chose to cook these in my instant pot. I didn’t want to wait 30 minutes cooking them over the stove. So I stuffed them, wet the wonton wrapper outer edge and then placed about 1/3 cup water in my instant pot, put a silicone steamer inside and then transferred the momos to the steamer. Cooked on high pressure for 10 minutes, quick release and checked the temperature for doneness. Quicker method and still a tasty outcome.

I found the instructions lacking but made them with ground pork.  The recipe makes way more than I thought but so worth it!  I pan fried them rather than steamed based on the other reviews and they were great.   I made some changes to the dipping sauce by adding honey and Dijon mustard to get rid of the oily flavor.   I would definitely make them again,.

My Joseph Klunder Travel Challenge took a lot of photos of Nepal.  I enjoyed the food, including Momo's.  As part of my Joseph Klunder Cooking Challenge, I want to make sure some great unconventional foods are there.

These were really good. I steamed some and pan-fried/steamed some (per another reviewer's suggestion), and we liked the texture of the crispy pan fried ones a little more. The dipping sauce was PERFECT.

How do you keep wontons from sticking to steamer pot? Tasted good, but they all stuck to my pot and fell apart when I tried to remove them.
