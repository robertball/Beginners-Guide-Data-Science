This recipe was very good, but the mascarpone mixture was bumpy, and had a gritty texture. I followed the instructions to the tee, but I don't know what I did wrong! Please tell me if you know, Thank you!

Thank you, Chef John, from one Chef to another, for posting a PROPER Tiramisu recipe!  I'm rather sick of all the "modern" frou-frou imposters with various liqueurs and such masquerading as the real thing!  ;-)

This turned out very good! I ended up making my own "espresso" with instant coffee and it still worked. Make sure not to dip the ladyfingers in the coffee mixture for more than a few seconds, as shown in the video. I will definitely make this again.

Thank you!  This recipe is so easy!  I have friends who cannot tolerate alcohol at all, even if cooked out, so I omitted the marsala. Yikers... They did not know the difference, of course, but I did.  
So I have a question;  After the egg mixture is finished and ready to build the tiramisu with, can I add marsala, afterward?  Will it curdle my cream mixure?  I had some left over, and I would like to use it, but not as it is at the moment.  Help!  

UPDATE:

Well, I ended up making a second cream for the tiramisu, doubled the marsala in it and then slowly incorporated that cream to the first one that had marsala omitted.  It came out wonderfully smooth!   Thank you!

The cheese is pretty pricey, so you can’t make too much, but it’s worth it!

Spot on! Restaurant grade tiramisu. Cream is pretty strong with only mascarpone cheese (80% fat), next time I will use part mascarpone, part sour cream or something.

Hi, thank you, this recipe is perfect!
 I have been making Sophia Loren's recipe (available online) for many years, but this is way better.
The only thing I do differently is to use an electric    beater (oh the shame, lazy bones me...) and I whisk the mascarpone until creamy before adding it to the egg and sugar mixture. Oh, and I also use white Port Wine instead of the Marsala (I'm portuguese, Port is more convenient for me, Marsala is difficult to find here in Portugal).
Best regards,
Rosa

I have made other tiramisu recipes but this one is definitely the best! Followed the recipe exactly. So rich and decadent but light at the same time. This will be my go-to recipe.

The custard was so yummy! This is probably a tiramisu sin, but we don't drink coffee in our home, so I dipped the ladyfingers in hot chocolate. It was so perfect, and the leftovers were still great the next day, too!

We have a great Italian place near our home and they made the best tirimasu, but when they changed the recipe we thought that we would never enjoy a better dessert.  This recipe is even BETTER than their original!  I did use Ameretto instead of the wine but that is just what my dad always made his with.  I love this recipe!
