These are an interesting take on waffles - think cornbread meets waffle. Made exactly as instructed w/ no substitutions. I see this as more of a savory waffle and think topping it w/ cheese, scrambled eggs and picante sauce would work for breakfast or chili would work for a lunch/dinner. Thanks for sharing

This is my recipe (so natch the 5 stars! :) .  I had meant to add that putting them in the toaster is a great to warm them up and can crisp them back up.  I am glad to see that these waffles have been enjoyed.  UPDATE:  I noticed  one reviewer said she might cut back on cornmeal, and I just want to suggest that it is a good idea. I played with the ratio of flour to cornmeal until I had what my husband liked - thus the name!  :)  I know everyone has different preferences.

My husband loves this recipe!  They reheat really well and are still delicious.  My father-in-law likes them with molasses.  Yum!  Thanks so much for posting it!

Made these today and for some reason I expected a firmer texture. They are gritty but they are very light and floppy. I was hoping for more body in the waffles, more like a Belgian style waffles with extra crunch. These are more like pancakes in texture.

Excellent. I don't get enough fibre so I decided to try these and I'm glad I did.  When I first looked at the recipe I was surprised that it was very much like my mom's pancake recipe which I make all the time.  The only difference is we use 1/2 cup cornmeal/ 1 1/2 cup flour, 3 tbsp oil and 3 tsp baking powder for the pancakes.  Everything else the same so this recipe could be used for both pancakes and waffles. I didn't realize that you could use so much cornmeal and still have great waffles/pancakes.  I will use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

I used melted coconut oil instead of butter, so I needed to warm up the milk and egg a bit before mixing  it in.   Served with a fresh blackberry/maple syrup  and they were delicious!

Great recipe! They're closer to corn bread than I expected, so I may reduce the amount of cornmeal to flour ratio next time. I added a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract for fun. I always add flaxseed to my waffles to make them healthier, so that may have thickened my batter a little bit, which was a perfect consistency.

I had no buttermilk, so I did the milk+vinegar substitution. This might be why I ended up with a very runny batter. I ended up adding a little more flour and cornmeal to thicken a bit, and it was still runnier than I am used to for waffles, but they came out great! My whole family ate them up. The texture is interesting, so if you are cooking for anyone who might be averse to the slight grittiness from the course ground cornmeal, then be aware. They aren't too crunchy, just gritty, as stated :) Thank you!

I made this today using 1/2 cup Jiffy Corn Muffin mix with 1 1/2 cup reg. flour.  Then because I did not have buttermilk I used 1 3/4 cups 1% milk.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  My 8 year old grandson and I loved them! A little more sustenance than a  regular waffle recipe!

This is a good recipe. Very easy to put together and very yummy to eat. We love the cornmeal crunch too. Adds a good texture to the waffles. I have been making double batches and cooking them in the waffle iron. Once cool I put in freezer bags and freeze. When someone in the family feels like a waffle, they are ready to just put into the toaster. These can go savory or sweet. Nice. We like them topped with homemade jam or if I want a savory batch I add canned corn to the mixture after draining. Then just eat topped with butter. Fantastic!

Kids gave it two thumbs up!  I used coconut oil as suggested by someone else, warmed the milk/egg mixture before whisking in the oil, and also cut the corn meal in half.  I also added a couple scoops of protein powder...yummy!

I like a tasty waffle, so I added 9 tbs of brown sugar, 2 tbs vanilla, 2 drops of almond extract, 1 tsp mixed spice and approximately 3 tbs coconut milk powder. I also reduced the corn meal (refined) to 3/4 cups.- Hubby; who isn't a fan of waffles/pancakes, said it tasted really good... I'll be making this again!

Delicious, light waffles.  I used a pretty fine cornmeal, so maybe not as gritty as described.  My one change is I added about 1.5 tablespoons of ground flax, just because I’m trying to add it to whatever I bake these days.
