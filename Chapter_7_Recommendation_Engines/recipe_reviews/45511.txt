Really delicious.  Made changes based on others suggestions.  I used fresh baby spinach that I sauted with a bit of onion and red pepper, doubled amount of goat cheese, added about 1/2C seasoned bread crumbs and one egg.  I didn't add salt or pepper.  The cheese is salty enough and I used 5 peppercorn goat cheese I bought at the Farmer's Market.  It wasn't super easy to form the patties, but I got the hang of it and was able to get 5.  Put them on a cookie sheet and into the fridge for a couple of hours.  Fantastic surprise of flavors.  Very, very good.  ***UPDATE-I have found that it is important not to over cook the burgers in order for them to stay moist.  I have also made them without an egg and I prefer the texture.

OMG! We do love these burgers!  Made first exactly as directed (ok, a little extra cheese:) topped with carmelized onions and a little mayo/dijon spread.
Then made again with feta & chopped black olives, thin sliced red onion to top and a homemade cucumber/yogurt sauce. We can't get enough of these! The most consistant response "this doesn't taste like turkey"!  Last night made with goat cheese and chopped sundried tomatoes (not the ones in oil), yum! I will never again attempt a to make a turkey burger taste like ground beef!  Great recipe, thanks!

These are really great turkey burgers! Very flavorful and moist. I doubled the recipe and used suggestions made by the other reviewers, such as using sauteed fresh spinach. For the 3 lbs. of turkey I used 1C. of breadcrumbs,  2 eggs, and about 3 ozs. of goat cheese. Half of the burgers went into the freezer for another meal and the others I broiled in the oven. My hubby and 2 teenage sons loved these so much that we had the ones from the freezer 2 nights later!

These were relly good for turkey burgers; not dry and good flavor. I changed them a little, taking advice from the others. I diced onion, and sauteed that with fresh spinach. to the turkey mixture I added just a tad of S & P, onion and garlic powders, and I doubled the goat cheese, then pan fried and topped with sauteed shrooms. Light mayo on a whole wheat bun, and they were done. My boyfriend scarfed down two!

I have made this recipe twice. Froze some and they were perfect. I did make some changes like some before me have.Cooked the spinach with 1 tb chopped onion and a pinch of garlic powder till dry. I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese. Added 1/3 cup of seasoned bread crumbs, 1 tb. parmasean cheese, dash of worcestershire and a pinch of Old Bay. I baked them for 10 min @450% then put them under the broiler to brown up. Great recipe!!

I made this exactly as directed, and although is was very good (and unique!), it lacked in a lot of flavor (compared to beef burgers).. as ground turkey seems to be notorious for.  Next time, I will definitely add some grated onions, cayenne pepper, salt, and maybe a splash of Worchestershire sauce.  I enjoyed the moist texture of these burgers!  I ate it without the bun, and mdae sweet potoato oven-baked fries to go along with it.  If I would have had time, I would've topped with grilled onions, no doubt.  I had no trouble forming these into nice, thick patties, and I placed on a lightly greased baking pan, lined with foil.  I put them in the oven, at 450 F for 10 minutes, and then "broiled", at 500 F.. and they were perfect.  Thank you for the recipe!

Listen, this recipe is AMAZING if you follow the advice of everyone else who has reviewed this.  Add one egg, more cheese, caramelized onions and garlic.  I also mistakenly bought ground chicken-- and that was amazing also.  I served it with yogurt and cucumbers as suggested!  Definitely try the recipes with the suggested additions.

I made these tonight, and my boyfriend said he never wants to eat beef burgers again.    I followed other recommendations and added a few things -- a splash of worchestire, an egg, 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs, and i also added some montreal steak seasoning. I served them with simple oven fries from this site -- it was a huge hit!

These were very tasty. I used feta cheese, however next time I think I will use chevre -- as it is a creamier, richer tasting cheese. This was a great recipe for my husband who is on a low carb diet.

Very yummy but I did a lot to the recipe to make it the way I envisioned it tasting best...and it worked out well!  99% Fat Free Turkey (1 lb) made 4 good sized burgers...I mixed 2 tablespoons of feta, garlic sauteed spinach (1/4 cup), 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 2 splashes of Worchester sauce, 1 egg, 1/2 tsp ground pepper, and 1/4 cup italian bread.  Served with tomato, bacon slices, bibb lettuce, whole grain mustard, pickles, and mayo.  My hubby has never had good turkey burgers before and really loved this.  Will definitely make again but I would imagine that without my additions, the recipe would have been pretty plain - thus my rating of the recipe.

Delicious!  My husband said, "Think how much we pay for fish (our staple diet most nights)!"  We made them with fresh spinach (and other dark greens), and a combination of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.  This will definitely be added to our weekly menu.

My Father and I both throughly enjoyed this recipe. As neither of us liked goat cheese, I substituted in Blue Cheese and double the amount and added Chili Powder.

Delicious!  Such a great idea!  Used a typical pkg of turkey (1.3 lbs), 10 oz frozen (thawed) spinach, goat cheese.  Also added (as others suggested) 1 egg, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, sauteed onion and garlic.  And ground pepper.  Mine MADE 6 BURGERS.  For cooking, I put on a cookie sheet and baked at 450 for about 5 min on each side.  Then transferred to broiler pan and broiled for 3 min each side.  REALLY GOOD!!!  And we have leftovers!

The flavor was just right for my family with two little ones. I didn't add the egg or the bread crumbs like previous reviewers. I used the ingredients mentioned and added a little bit of garlic salt on top of the burgers before cooking.

WOW!!!! What a great base recipe to get crazy with!  My family LOVED this-- yes even my picky 6 y/o and 8 y/o and meat-loving husband. 
I tweeked the recipe a little with fresh baby spinach sauted in EVOO, minced garlic, and sundried tomatoes[oile packed] and added seasonings such as garlic herb and lemon pepper.  Afterwards, I drained and cooled the spinach really well before combining it with the rest.  

I had plain goat cheese so I finely chopped and combined some fresh rosemary and parsely and let it sit in the fridge for a while.  

I added finely chopped red onions to the lean ground turkey[previously frozen] I added a few seasoned bread crumbs, a little hamburger seasoning mix, lots of garlic herb dressing, onion powder, s/p, and dried parsely, Worcestershire sauce.  Then I combined everything and made about 8 generous patties with only 1 pound of turkey and let them rest in the fridge for about 10min. 

I grilled it all on my stovetop grill and finished it under the boiler w/Swiss cheese.  I used Kaiser buns and no dressings because I didn't want anything to compete with the flavors of the patties.  

I paired this with homemade fries!! My family said this is definitely a REPEATER!  Thanks for the great base recipe!

Easy. Simple. Delicious! I used more goat cheese than the original recipe. I also add minced onions (basically because I was in a hurry), salt and seasoned pepper. I will definitely make again. YUM!

Great recipe! If you cook on the grill, something more needs to be added to bind it, we had a little trouble with it falling apart on the grill. We also added dried parsley, chopped garlic, salt and pepper and it turned out wonderful! Will definetly use again! Thanks

Ok, so, heres the story. I couldn't find goat cheese... anywhere. So I substituted blue cheese and it turned out delicious! I only made one patty so the measurements were probably a little off. I also made these changes: Like mentioned earlier, the blue cheese instead of goat cheese, a handful of fast cooking oats, and just a pinch of bread crumbs. Also, I cooked this on the stove with some olive oil on medium high heat. Served over nut bread toast with some ketchup, this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

I smeared both sides of buns with 2 cloves of roasted garlic.  Used more goat cheese in and more on the bun. Fresh spinach. Used grill pan.  Very good.

Absolutely phenomenal.  Regardless of whether or not I change the recipe a tad (with bread crumbs, other seasonings), it is still amazing.

I added feta and goat cheese and took the advice of all of the other users by adding other ingredients. These were really good. I also sauteed some onions and mushrooms and topped with swiss cheese. My bf loved them..

I made a few of the suggestions mentioned and this was fantastic. I added an egg, a few bread crumbs and herb goat cheese. It was the most flavorful turkey burger I have ever made.

Just didn't work for us.  Somehow, I don't expect the spinach taste in my burger.

Wow! I really loved these burgers. I followed the suggestions of others. I sauteed some spinach, onion and fresh garlic together. Then I mixed the meat, sauteed vegetables, some Worceshire sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, bread crumbs, 1 egg, and 3.5 oz of HERBED goat cheese.  Wow! These were so moist and delicious. Be careful not to overcook them, especially if you are using all white meat/extra lean turkey. I will definitely be making these again. Even my 1 yr old loved them!

My roommate and I just made this today, and it was amazing. We added a TON of garlic to it, and about double the amount of goat cheese. We also added an egg into the mixture to hold it together and keep it moist. We also made yogurt sauce to top it off, with just plain yogurt (strained), olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and salt and pepper.It was FANTASTIC on top of the turkey burgers, fresh out of the oven. We cooked it under the broiler, 8 minutes on each side, and it was perfection. NOTE: Don't use all the spinach that it calls for unless you really really like to taste the spinach. We used half the amount, and could definitely taste it. It was PLENTY. Enjoy!

A healthy alternative to beef, but goat cheese in a burger just doesn't taste right.  And I LOVE goat cheese, so I was disappointed.

These were excellent!  I made minor changes adding 2 1/2 tablespoons of seasoned bread crumbs, 1 egg and used fresh spinach that I wilted.  The goat cheese added a nice flavor to the turkey. I fixed these on our gas bbq grill using a grill plate.  We ate ours plain (no onions, condiments, etc).  I tried one with Dijon mustard and liked that also.  We will definitely fix these again.  (our side-dish was sweet potato fries.)

Allrecipes.com is my go-to recipe site because the reviews are where the value is. We also caramelized the onion, added a clove of pressed garlic for last 30 seconds, set these aromatics aside and used same pan to wilt some fresh spinach. Per Boonie12, we mixed these with the ground turkey plus doubled amount of goat cheese, 1/2c seasoned bread crumbs, one egg, and a Costco no-salt dried-herbs-and-seasonings blend we use on everything, working the meat as little as possible (to avoid toughening it up). 
Liked Boonie12's suggestion to put them on a cookie sheet and into the fridge for a couple of hours to firm up. Then we grilled them on our Foreman. Much more flavorful than trying to treat ground turkey as if were ground beef, and not as dry.
In future, we'll try the suggestions to use oats instead of breadcrumbs, probably sauteing with the spinach; saltier feta in place of the goat cheese; and doubling the recipe to freeze half of the uncooked burgers for another day.

Reviewers who sauteed the spinach first, I don't see any reason to do that....I used about half a bag of fresh chopped spinach and mixed it right in with the goat cheese and 1 lb of turkey meat. I did, however, add a few spices like onion powder, garlic powder and black pepper, and added an egg and a little bread crumbs. Broiled in the toaster oven for about 25 minutes, it made 4 patties. It was super delicious. Even my husband gobbled it down (although he did top his with a piece of bacon, hehe)

After reading several of the reviews, I caramelized the 1 medium sized red onion and then sauteed in about 2 cups of fresh baby spinach. I added in 4 cloves of garlic, 1 egg and oats. I doubled the amount of goat cheese. I also sprinkled in some seasoned salt, black pepper and paprika. I used equal parts breast and thigh and tossed in a bit of ground beef that had to be used.  I cooked them on the Foreman. While they were extremely moist and juicy, there wasn't much flavor. The kids said they were really good, but my husband and I agree that it was a good start, but needed a major flavor boost.

These are so good, I eat them as is:  no condiments or anything mucking them up.

I use 1 lb turkey instead of 1 1/2.  And I use cut leaf spinach rather than the chopped.

Amazing recipe! I took advice from other reviewers and used fresh baby spinach, sauteed with an onion and a few minced garlic cloves. I used 3oz goat cheese, 1/4 C plain breadcrumbs that I seasoned with oregano and basil. Broiled them in the oven like 5-7 minutes on each side and they were PERFECT!

These are so good. We loved them. The only thing we did different was we grilled them instead of broiled. I think the grilling added some extra smoke flavor that was greatt nice. We will definately make these again!

I'm relieved to finally try a turkey burger that doesn't gross everyone out.  You will not be amazed that it tastes so much like a hamburger, but you might be surprised that it tastes so good.  I did accidentally put in about twice as much spinach, and I used 4 oz of goat cheese.  I sauteed the spinach (10 oz frozen) with diced onions (1 cup) and minced garlic (2 cloves), but with all the spinach and the turkey I could hardly taste it.  I used one 1.2 lb pack of lean turkey, and with everything else it made 4 big patties.  I broiled it on a broiler pan near the top of the oven for 15 minutes, and they browned nicely on one side and were fully cooked inside.  Next time I will use more onion, possibly shredded, and more garlic, salt and pepper.  I actually don't think it was too much spinach (maybe it kept the patties moist??) if you don't mind it.  I will probably make 5 slightly smaller patties next time.  But I'll definitely make it again - the 3 year old ate it!

This one is a good base, but definitely needs some mods.   Where I live, ground turkey comes in 450g packages (i.e. a pound). As per the scaled recipe, a pound of turkey equals about three burgers.   As per other people's reviews, i sauteed red onion, garlic and fresh spinach. When that was all said and done, I think it worked out to be about a half cup of spinach mixture, maybe a little more. Could use more if you like spinach.   I used about 80-90g of goat cheese. This is about 3 oz. Probably should have used the whole package (4 oz) for three burgers.   Found the mixture to be wet, so I added ground flaxseed to dry it out in lieu of breadcrumbs. Worked nicely. Threw it on the Foreman grill for about 6 minutes. Topped with dijon as per another review, but would go nicely with a yogurt sauce or something of the sort.   I will definitely play around with this one in the future, as it resulted in a yummy turkey burger.   S.

Great Recipe! My kids even ate it. I tweaked it a little by adding a clove of crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, dried minced onion, and cooked them in the skillet instead of the broiler. Will make again!

This was delicious.  I ended up using oats instead of bread crumbs because I was out.  I also added shredded mushroom and onion.  I did add more goat cheese, but next time I think I'll up it.  And I definately plan to try it with feta.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

I made these last night and they were very good! MMM! I only gave it 4 stars because mine did not hold together and I even added an egg and a little bit of seasoned bread crumbs. Even so, they were fabulous. With one patty I attempted to barbecue, but it def. did not hold together to even flip.. so I pan fried the rest and they were great!! I will def. make again and probably add more goat cheese since it's sooo good!

I have a similar recipe but it also uses an egg
and 1/3 cup of high fat yogurt, this helps keep the
burgers together and keeps them from being dry.  I 
also freeze them before I cook them and then grill them
from frozen.  I also add basil and dried peppers.

Delish! I added onion, garlic and some seasonings to the spinach and cheese and coooked these on the stove top. I think 4 minutes each side. I made 5 burgers out of the 1.25 ound package of turkey breast. They were still very big burgers. I served these on a honey wheat bun with red pepper/eggplant spread, a bit of low fat mayo and some spicy arugula. next time, maybe a few sauted mushrooms will end up in there.

Good Idea! I cut down on the spinach so my burgers wouldn't crumble cause I wanted to cook them on the grill.  Added course salt and garlic powder. Had feta in fridge so that is what I used. Drizzled olive oil over it, makes them moist.
YUM!

These burgers are really moist and tasty. I couldn't get any ground turkey at the store, so I used ground chicken. I also had garlic & herb goat cheese on hand, so I threw that in. Dressed up with some mayo, mustard, lettuce, pickles, and red onion on a bun - made for a great dinner!

Once we got the cooking under control, they were delicious!  We tried to cook them on the grill, but they started to burn on the edges.  I think I made the patties too big - we took them off right away, brought them in and cooked them on the stove and they were great.  I used a garlic & spinach flavored goat cheese from a local goat dairy farm that really added a lot to the flavor.  Will definitely make again - thanks!!!

Very Good!  Be sure to season it with salt/pepper/garlic/onion powder (whatever you want).  I served mine bunless with tomatoes & dijon mustard.  Will make again and again and again.

This is a good recipe, but it needs some flavor. I added garlic and a touch or soy sauce.  My family loved it!  Great on Pita bread with a yogurt cucumber sauce.

This recipe was excellent and easy to make!  I used goat cheese (not feta) and fresh spinach that I had left over.  The burgers reminded me of something I'd find at my favorite local grill.  This is a definite keeper.

I always love making these. I add sauteed onions, a little salt and pepper, a tsp each of cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and a little liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce and maybe 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs. Used the griddler. SO GOOD!

Like the other reviewers suggested I added 1 egg, 3/4 cup fresh breadcrumbs, and Montreal Steak Seasoning. Didn't have any spinach so I omitted it. Cooked on stovetop on medium high for 12 minutes. Outstanding dinner.

I used herbed goat cheese and cooked them in a skillet rather than the broiler.  The flavor was awesome!  I served with additional goat cheese spread on the bun.  I love that these are so easy to make and have so much flavor for so few ingredients.

Cooked these a couple of times, and the second time used feta and added an egg...giving it 3-stars but with the changes, it is better and would rate it a 4. Will cook again as changed.

They were very quick to make and cook which was great but they weren't as flavorful as I expected them to be. I might try herb goat cheese next time to add some umf.

I followed some of the reviews suggestions and made some changes based on necessity.  The grocery store didn't have goat cheese so we ended up with tomato and basil feta.  I sauteed the spinach with some onion and garlic.  I added bread crumbs and an egg.  Instead of Worcestershire I added a little steak sauce.  They were very flavorful and held together well.  We ate them two days in a row, very good!

Very nice flavor, but a bit mild. While I did use feta cheese (goat was not available at the supermarket)- i will def double that amount next time. Very juicy and delicious regardless!

I followed directions and recipe with the only changes being: substitue frozen spinach for fresh and sauteeing it with onions and increasing the amount of cheese.  DELICIOUS!! The only additional suggestion I will take for next time is to turn the broiler on at the end for a few minutes to dry it up a bit and give it a crisp finish. What a wonderful burger!

This is SO easy and really, really delicious!.   The only change that I made to the recipe was that I used tomato basil flavored goats cheese, and I doubled the amount of cheese.  My young children even liked these!  I thought they were BY FAR the best turkey burgers I have ever eaten.  I will be making these burgers againa and again.

This has become a quick and easy go to recipe for me.  Took suggestions from other reviews and added double the goat cheese amount.  Also sauteed fresh spinach and red peppers to mix into the burger and served w/ dijon mustard.

Ok so this was a pretty good recipe but I made a few substitutions..instead of goat cheese I used gorgonzola cheese and fresh baby spinach..I had a problem with the patties staying intact but other than that it was great! I served it on top of pita bread instead of buns.

These are very good.  Bf doesn't like turkey burgers normally and he liked them.  I'm rating them at a 4 only because I added a few spices (onion & garlic powder and seasoned salt).  I also didn't use frozen spinach--don't like working with it and I prefer to use fresh.  Just chopped the fresh in my food processor and it was perfect.  These are very moist.  I also used feta instead of goat cheese (don't have any goat cheese on hand) and didn't measure it. I may have used a lot more than called for.  I'm told I make small burgers, but these made 8 for me, not 4.  And I had a tiny bit left over so I just made a meatball.

Wow, used lean ground turkey, but it was moist and rich. Added some sea salt and black pepper, sprinkled with onion powder, and it came out perfect. Served like a gourmet meatball on a lettuce wedge with a thin slice of ripe tomato, then topped with a dijon mustard, horseraddish, mayo blend. A little avacado and fresh ground pepper (or, even better, a dusting of cayenne) and it was gorgeous, elegant, and delicious. I'd post a picture, but my husband just finished the last one!
A note - I served with a low fat carmelized onion/goat cheese pasta and the meal was fantastique! (and guilt free!)

This was a great recipe for my dinner for one. I used a little less than a 1/4 lb. of turkey, more spinach and an extra 1/2 t. goat cheese.  I added black pepper and formed two small patties and then cooked them in a frying pan, rather than broiling.  They were crumbly, so grilling would be a disaster.  When they were done, I added sauted red onion and slices of roma tomato. Next time, I'll put them on a piece of crusty sourdough.

Not much flavor.  You really need to use feta to get some flavor and add some garlic and ... I don't know what else, but yuck.  Fell apart and blah. Better recipes on this site for turkey burgers.

These were awesome! As suggested, I used more goat cheese. They were very juicy and flavorful. I served them with mayo, tomatoes, and diced red onion in toasted pitas.

Very good burgers! I did make a few small changes. I added fresh minced garlic, bread crunmbs, a dash of basil, some montreal steak seasoning, and fresh pepper. I also used a lot more of the goat cheese than is called for as we love it. I have tried these on the grill and in the broiler and they were better in the broiler by far! Thanks for a tasty alternative to every day burgers! Delicious!

absolutely delicious.  added 1 egg, 1 tsp garlic powder, pepper, some fried onion, 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  The burgers were easy to form, and didn't crumble.  Served on a bun with tzatziki sauce.

Have wanted to try this one for a long time now. Excellent results. Used extra lean turkey and extra goat cheese. Chose a cheese flavored with thyme and red pepper (already crumbled). Added one egg and about 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of seasoned bread crumbs as per other reviews. Also added some dried basil and garlic powder. To half the mixture I added the spinach but the BF isn't a fan so I made his with a little chipotle tabasco sauce in the mix and sprinkled the outside with seasoning salt (which he loves). He ate his plain on a grilled kaiser roll and loved it. I ate mine with a little chipotle mayo (not necessary) and carmelized onions...no bun. I loved mine as well. The fat content in the meat was so low we didn't need to wash the fat tray from our George Forman (we don't have a grill). Outstanding!

Very very good burgers. Next time I will cut back on the spinach and add a tablespoon more goat cheese (I prefer cheese). The cheese is easier to crumble if it's been in the fridge for a while. Also, make sure the cheese is evenly distributed...they taste better that way.

I was pleasantly surprised by this simple yet tasty recipe.  I did not want a meatloaf burger and this combination of ingredients was hearty and flavorful without being too overwhelming to the meat--the burger flavor definitely came through.  I roughly doubled the amount of cheese and used an Israeli feta, which is creamier and a bit milder than traditional greek feta.  I added some carmelized red onions to the top and no other condiment was needed, although my husband requested sauteed mushrooms next time.  They stayed together well for broiling and the amount of time suggested was just right.

Great flavor combination.  I used  goat cheese crumbles and increased the amount.  I sauteed fresh spinach with chopped onion, minced garlic and pepper.  I made them on a foreman grill.  They would definitely not stay together for a grill or even a broiler pan - very fragile.  Using fresh, not previously frozen, ground turkey helps.  I didn't want to add egg since it's likely to taste like meatloaf.  Still very good flavor.  Worth trying.

For all the hype these have gotten I was really disappointed. My husband didn't think they were any better than the average turkey burger and actually commented on the fact that despite the fact that I added a whole package of goat cheese it didn't change the flavor that much. He would prefer to have the actually delicious turkey burgers also from this site.

i've never been a big fan of turkey burgers.  but i LOVE this recipe!  i used a whole package of herbed goat cheese, which adds such great flavor.  i agree with someone else's sentiment...go crazy with the goat cheese.  it's delicious!  i also added 1 egg, and salt, pepper, and garlic salt to season the meat.  thanks for a great recipe!

My only suggestion is:  Go Crazy with the Goat Cheese!!  These are fabulous and I have made them so many times I have lost count!  I make oven fries and a salad to go with...of yeah, I stopped using buns with these...simply don't need them.  Thanks for the recipe!

All in all, this recipe was pretty good.  I made a few tweaks.  In place of plain goat cheese I used an herbed goat cheese.  I also added some chopped carmelized onions to the mixture.  Once it was all combined it was hard for the patties to stay together so I slowly added panko breadcrumbs until the mixture had a more stable consistency.  The end result reminded me of a light meatloaf without the tomato sauce base.  The end result was pretty good.  However, I'm only giving it three stars because cheese as an ingredient is pretty fattening and the taste of cheese was not overly apparent in these burgers.  I am going to try making this in the future, but leaving the cheese in bigger chunks as I stir it in so the cheese flavor is highlighted more strongly.

Wonderful!  So so tasty!  Only changes I made were to add some garlic powder and onion powder.  Oh, and I used 6 tablespoons of cheese, because you can never have too much cheese.  My husband commented that these tasted like lamb burgers, and you know what?  They kind of do.  Like many others have noted, this made 5 burgers.  I topped these with sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Thanks for the great dinner!

Added some fresh minced garlic and some finely chopped green onions. Also added a couple of T. of plain bread crumbs to help bind it. Used the higher fat content ground turkey and made sure to spray the grill. Did not have any problems with these falling apart on the grill outside. Tasted fabulous... the entire family; 9 year old and both of my parents loved it. We are definitely keeping this one.

This is an excellent turkey burger recipe. One package (1.20 lbs) made 5 burgers for me. I added chopped onion, garlic, and seasoned with onion&garlic powder in addition to the chopped spinach and goat cheese. This is a great recipe to use as-is or experiment with! Will make again

Made a few minor changes, added tablespoon of olive oil for it to keep the burger format & sun dried tomatoes for extra flavor.  *Very easy & quick* to make and definitely flavorful and yummy.  Even better, my husband loved it! :)

Recipe was very simple and the cheese definitely helped the burgers be moist! I would add some more zip to them next time  - at least added seasoned salt - and perhaps 1-2 minced garlic cloves. Good variety for a low-fat alternative!

I used a tomato and basil flavored goat cheese, put in double the amount of cheese and grilled the burgers.  The patties were a bit sticky to work with, but made fabulously moist and tasty burgers.  I will certainly make them again.  This sounds like a strange recipe, but it really is good!

Love turkey burgers—it’s making them taste great that’s always the challenge. I use white meat ground turkey, which I believe is essential, then add fresh spinach and crumbled goat cheese along with some Greek seasonings. No need for bread crumbs or eggs as suggested by others—the patties formed easily. Great with a chopped salad.

Once again, a great basic recipe. I add Greek seasoning and lemon juice to enhance flavour.

Bland...BUT it has a lot of promise, very solid base for what could be amazing. I will be making it again and trying adding onion, peppers, garlic, different seasonings etc. until I find a bit more flavorful combo.

I followed the recipe as listed and they turned out sooo good! Topped with diced tomato and basil leaves. Very fresh tasting. Next time i make them I'll add some salt to bring out the flavor more, maybe add more goat cheese. I can't get enough of it!

Wonderful recipe. Juicy burgers and you can change the taste based on the type of cheese you buy. Better than regular burgers and much healthier.

I found this recipe too bland for my taste. A friend I served it to loved it. But I found it had little flavour. I will attempt this recipe again but with more goat cheese and maybe some more spices or additional ingredients.

Hmm. Well, not terrible, but not particularly flavorful. Looking at the changes others have made, I'd recommend the Spinach and Feta Turkey Burgers recipe from this site; incorporates many of those changes (addition of an egg, feta subbed for goat cheese) and isn't much more difficult. Although I will say that it doesn't get much easier than this recipe - three ingredients in a bowl! - we'll probably stick to that one. Thanks anyway!

i was looking for someone who had a good ratio for ground turkey, spinach, and some kind of cheese and ty.. bc yours helped me a lot.. i didnt have goat cheese but had this italian mix of asiago, romano, parm etc thing.. b/c of the saltiness i didnt need to add anything just like the original recipe.. when i run across the goat cheese in a specialty market i'll try your version.. im sure it's great

Delicious!! I took the advice of  other reviewers and used fresh spinach which I sauteed with red pepper and garlic. I also added an egg white and bread crumbs to the mixture to help it stick and threw them on the grill. Served with whole wheat hamburger buns, sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes, tzatziki and cucumber.

Yum! Lacking flavor, but easy and with some more spice could be 5 star.  Today, I used sauteed spinach and red onion instead of frozen. I combined all ingredients as directed. The burgers cooked up nicely. In the future, I would increase amount of goat cheese put into the burgers, as well as sprinkle some on top right before they come out of the oven. In addition, I would increase red onion used to enhance flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but not as good as I had hoped.  The turkey meat is kind of boring, so next time I make this, I am going to add some Worcestershire sauce, a drop of soy sauce, and a sprinkle of garlic and parsley. Also, as the burger cooks, the flavor of the goat cheese diminishes and it loses creaminess. So I would recommend putting a little in with the burger, but then topping it off with more goat cheese at the end. With some changes, suited to personal taste, I think this burger has a lot of potential!

I made the recipe as listed, only used feta cheese instead. It gets 4 stars for ease and convenience. It was lacking slightly in flavor - not sure what to do about this... Also, turkey is so much leaner, it really was much more dry than beef burgers. But if I would have cooked them any less, they wouldn't have been done all the way. Not sure if I will make it again, unless I happen to have all the ingredients on hand.

This was really good. I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese, however, I think it would be just as good.  Don't leave themin the broiler too long or it will dry those puppies out.

Wow!  I thought it would be the same old turkey burgers with a little cheese built in - was I ever wrong!  They were so flavorful, I was amazed at how much flavor and texture the goat cheese added.  What a great recipe (even the picky hubby loved them!)

Delicious!!! I sauteed fresh spinach and used peppered goat cheese. These were amazing. Even my boyfriend liked them and he is a beef kind of guy. I had been trying to make my turkey burgers the same way I make my beef burgers (egg, bread crumbs, onion, green pepper, spices) but the turkey burgers were not that great. Now I can make turkey burgers at home. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really delicious, but needed some improving as I found after reading other reviews.  I used 2 lbs of turkey, 10 oz box of spinach which I sauteed in garlic, onion and mushrooms (could have done without the mushrooms).  I also added some Mrs. Dash chicken seasoning.  These came out wonderful and yielded 10 large patties.  Don't add any salt, because the feta is salty enough.

Excellent! I used bleu cheese instead of the goat cheese...also as others suggested sauteed onions and spinach first, along w/ the garlic.  Broiled them the last 5 min and topped w/ mozzerella cheese.  Very good, even hubby said so!  Will be making these again!

Deeeelicious!  I took some other people's advice on here, sauteed baby spinach, mushrooms, onions and used feta instead of goat cheese.  It came out so moist and flavorful.  I froze half of my mix, but don't think it will stay in the freezer for long!

There's no mention of salt and pepper in the instructions, it needs seasoning, don't forget! I added roasted red peppers and some red chili flakes. Overall this recipe is a winner. And thanks to whoever posted the use of a muffin in, it kept the burgers nice and moist.

This recipe got an approval from my picky 6 year old son. The great thing was full of taste for a turkey burger and moist.  This will def. become a regular in my home! Only suggestion I have is to put onions and grated garlic when cooking the spinach for a little extra flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

GGRREEAATTT. I made these with alot more feta cheese instead of goat. I also took others suggestions and added garlic, a lil worcherstershire, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and then I marinated in the fridge for a couple days (just because I didn't have time to cook them). I ate these burgers everyday on a whole wheat bun and I am making them again the next week! First time eating them I served with pan fried potatoes. They were delish! I will def. be adding these to my regular rotation.

Good start to a juicy basic turkey burger.  Follow others advice and use fresh spinach, red onion and garlic sauteed together.  I also added garlic pepper to the mix.  I will be trying herb cheese, as well as sundried tomatoes next time.

This only deserves four stars b/c it's a good base recipe (the idea of combining core ingredients is good, but spices are lacking).  Definitely add salt and fresh ground pepper.  I also added worcestershire, 3 ounces total goat cheese, 2 T. chopped sun-dried tomatoes, 1/2 grated onion, 4 cloves grated garlic, 3/4 cup bread crumbs, dash cayenne, and dash Old Bay seasoning (I would have added an egg or 2 but did not have them on hands.  I pan-seared the burgers 4-5 min. on both sides in an ovenproof skillet, then put them into a pre-heated (400 degree) oven for 10-12 min.  They were moist and delicious.  Used mayo and Thai sweet chili sauce as condiments.  Yum!

This recipe absolutely needs some olive oil, or eggs, like the other suggestions, to give some moisture. I read one review that said do not overcook to not dry out, but I don't think I did overcook them. Maybe I did, but they looked just like the picture- little brown on top- looked delicious, but were SO incredibly dry. My husband did not eat his, which says a lot! I finished mine with some olive oil and my salad to get it down!
I thought for sure this recipe called for olive oil and I forgot...so, I will make again because I love goat cheese and I do like the broiler idea- very easy dish. 
So, my warning is to add something to juice it up!

Sorry...this just didn't do it for me.  My BF was okay with it, but I could tell that this didn't rock his world the way the rest of my cooking normally does.  No need for me to repeat this one.  Hope you have better luck.

This was a really good base recipe. I made meatballs out of this mix. I added one egg, 3 tbl grated onion, a couple sprigs of mint finely chopped, a couple tbls of lemon juice, goat cheese, spinach, salt and pepper, and a little bit of breadcrubms. I baked these and they came out delicious. I served with ww pasta with vegetables w/ garlic and olive oil. Next time I make them I will make some tzatsiki sauce to dip them in and maybe try it with feta cheese. 
Great to have on hand in the freezer for my husband to eat.

This was pretty good.  I used 1 roasted red pepper (not from a jar) and a package of crumbled plain goat cheese.  I also baked this in a silicone muffin tin.

Super easy and delicious! I made with feta because that's what we usually have on hand, and the creaminess from the cheese really makes these burgers! Thank you very much!

I'm really sorry to give this such a low score, but my husband and I couldn't even take more than a couple of bites. We made it exactly as the recipe said except we added a little bit more cheese and I made sure to dry the spinach a little, but it was just not good at all. It really would probably have been better with feta, but I won't be making anything remotely similiar any time soon.

Really very good.  The spinach didn't add much in the way of flavor but it did take away from the gray-ish look that a turkey burger has.  The goat cheese was just perfect.  Much better than I would have thought and now it will be so much easier to eat ground turkey. Thanks!

I added more cheese than what the recipe called for but they were not good.  I could not taste the cheese at all, although I could definitely taste the spinach.  Might try again but with blue cheese.

I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (steamed to evaporate water), sheeps milk cheese and once ready, sprinkled steak rub on top and put a little light mayo. Delicious! I was wondering why no salt was used in the recipe, but cheese makes these burgers salty enough (extra salt would be an overkill). Will definitely make again!

Was not impressed by this. For some reason I was expecting more. Needed more flavor or something. Oh well, overall was horrible just plain! A waste of goat cheese.

This recipe was great!  I made the burgers with basil and tomato feta cheese.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it in a pan w/a little olive oil, garlic, and onion chips before adding it to the turkey and feta mixture.  The family loved them!!  I'll make variations of this again, maybe meatballs next time.

Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty recipe.

We thought it was ok but not great - definitely needs some more flavor and while we did try to grill it was a bit of a disaster as they wouldn't stay together - ended up finishing them inthe broiler as we had a very hungry kid (and parents) who couldn't wait any more - maybe will try again

These were really yummy!  I used Chavrie with basil and garlic.  The amount of cheese called for in the recipe was just right - I tried it a second time with more and it was too strong.  These are great cooked on the grill.

followed as directed. My husband liked them (he took it off the bun and ate it by itself), I just thought it was good but not great... maybe add some seasonings to it.

I loved the bulky texture of the turkey burgers with additives.  I substitued the goat cheese for Feta which I had on hand which was excellent.  Remember to wring out the frozen spinach thoroughly!  They are fabulous and I make them all of the time now, instead of plain.

My husband is not fond of ground turkey or "fake beef" as he likes to call it.  He absolutely loved this burger and didn't even need to add any condiments.  I made it with a Mediterranean cheese blend (feta, provolone, parmasan)and served it on an onion bun.  It was very tastey!

These were very good - but I agree with some other reviewers that the recipe needs an egg and some breadcrumbs for the burgers to stick together.  I also doubled the goat cheese and used herbed goat cheese versus the plain kind.  I served the burgers with a nice greek salad and my guests were VERY impressed!  I'm also going to try this recipe using ground lamb meat.

I like my burgers to be burgers, not meatloaf on a bun. These were just perfect. I did add feta cheese along with the goat cheese and salt and fresh ground pepper. Used a Foreman type grill to cook. The kids and I just loved these. Next time I will try with a spicy dressing.

I used 1 lb turkey, sauteed spinach, bread crumbs, and egg and a package of goat cheese crumbles.  Then I grilled them on the George Foreman grill (which worked really well, I was afraid they would fall apart).  These were good, just not great.

Really good! I used gruyere cheese instead of goat because my family besides me doesn't like goat but it was still delicious. We had to add and egg to make it stick together to make patties. Next time i will make with goat cheese. cayenne pepper on top is really good too.

Quite tasty.  We did follow some of the recommendations and added one egg, some bread crumbs, extra cheese and lots of seasoning.  Then we topped them with caramelized onions and mushrooms.  Will make them again.

these came out pretty fantastic. i used ground chicken instead of turkey and added some of the suggestions from other reviewers - i added an egg, chopped carmalized onions, fresh garlic, and salt and pepper. I also added a tiny bit of seasoned bread crumbs to firm up the mix. overall - i thought these were some of the best turkey burgers! Thanka

I was shocked when my husband loved this. I used fresh ground turkey (not just breast) and it was very juicy and flavorful. Easy to make. Might make it with double the cheese next time or try feta.

These were really good!  I didn't have any spinach, so just added more goat cheese (can't go wrong with lots of cheese, can you?) and some quick cooking oats and an egg to hold it all together.  My husband raved about how good these were!  I liked them pretty well, too, and I'm not a fan of turkey!

I added some bread crumbs, used fresh baby spinach and pan fried it. I would've added an egg if I had one, but it didn't need it- it held together just fine. Delicious alternative to the usual turkey burger.

Very, very delicious burgers and so very easy.  I did use feta cheese as that is what I had and it was the one seasoned with basil and tomato.  Also added a little salt and pepper. They were a hit.  Will make again for sure.

Great recipe.  Although I added a few extra ingredents, I think the combo of spinach and goat cheese is brilliant.  I added an egg to firm it up, salt, and garlic and onion that i cooked to soften in a little oil.  I, like other reviewers, purchased garlic herb goat cheese.

GREAT FLAVOR. Needs a dash of salt. Having never tasted goat cheese I was afraid to use it, so used shredded pepperjack cheese. That was the only change I made.  After squeezing out as much of the water in the spinach as I  could, 1 10oz. box of frozen spinach measured out to 1 cup. These are really good, definatley a keeper! This would be good for someone who doesn't like turkey burgers. The spinach really disguises the flavor & texture of typical turkey burgers.

I used spicy chevre and added in some other seasonings like garlic powder and tabasco.  This recipe is designed for oven cooking, without a whole lot of bread crumbs it would be impossible to BBQ, and only marginally easier in a skillet.  I added an egg which seemed to help it hold together better.  When these come out of the oven all golden, I put a dollop of chevre on top and they taste divine.  I am on a diet, and this is one thing that fits the bill for high protein, low fat and carbs, and great taste.

These were very good--some of the better burgers I've made (and I'm not great with burgers).  Like a previous reviewer, I used Tomato and Basil Feta instead of goat cheese, which added a ton of flavor.  But I'm sure goat cheese would be marvelous, too.

Very tasty and a healthier alternative to regular burgers, although the kids weren't too crazy about them.  I didn't have any goat cheese so I used tomato and basil feta cheese.  It was delicious.  We topped them off with sliced tomatoes and ketchup or mayonnaise.  I was able to make 6 burgers from this recipe.

They were pretty good.  Not knock your socks off or anything, but good.  I added some garlic and grilled onions.  Next time I might make them on the grill instead of the broiler.

These were delicious -- my husband loved them.  I added scallions, garlic and Lawry salt and pepper to taste.  I also grilled them.  A great, healthy alternative to beef burgers.

This recipe is very easy and quick to make.  The goat cheese is a great idea and adds wonderful flavor to the turkey!
