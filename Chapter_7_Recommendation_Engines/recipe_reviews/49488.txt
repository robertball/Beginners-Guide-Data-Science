Excellent marinade. It was great on chicken. I only used a small amount of cilantro since it is not one of my favorites. This is a do again recipe.

My husband discovered this recipe and it turned out really great on boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I used white cooking wine so it was a bit salty and used 1 tablespoon dried cilantro. A keeper!

Used this marinade (minus the cilantro) on a pork loin roast which I then cooked on a BBQ rotisserie.  It was so tender you didn't need a knife!  A real keeper recipe.  Thanks Angelyn.

I don't know if I should even be rating this recipe given the amount that I altered the original recipe!  I used 2 cloves of garlic, then I added about 1/4 cup of honey and about the same amount of orange juice to sweeten it up.  We marinated turkey breast and bbq'd it....it was quite good with the additions.

This is a great marinade.  We used in on chicken breasts and next will try it on Flank steak.  I would not change a thing regarding the ingredients, it is perfect!

Such a wonderful marinade for the BBQ. I used it with boneless chicken and it turned out moist and flavourful.

The sesame oil was incredibly overpowering with this marinade. I tried it on pork sausages baked in the oven, but the kids didn't really like them. Too much of a smoky, sesame flavour. You could really taste the soy and it seems that it needed more balance, as in to add something sweet like a bit of honey or something. If I ever made this again I would add 1/4 the amount of sesame oil and equal quantities of soy/honey. Thankyou.

Our local supermarket sells fresh chicken tenders. I used these, and cooked on the grill.  They were very good.  I might suggest a one hour marinade time.

This was excellent! I forgot to pick up cilantro, so I used dried Basil instead. Turned out fantastic. Will try next time with dried cilantro. Just make sure to do your fresh to dried conversion (1/3 dried).

Since we love oriental flavors, I though I would give this a try.  I love garlic and ginger, but I found the marinade a touch bitter.  I added about a teaspoonful of sugar, and it was just right.  I will use this to top one of the ramen salads on the site.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as written, except I doubled the cilantro because we love the stuff. I marinated my boneless, skinless chicken breasts for over 24-hours (ended up going out to dinner instead), but I grilled them the next night. I thought they were a little bland so this recipe did not make it into my top 10/regular rotation.

It was good!  We used it on salmon, and the kids, hubs, and I all liked it.  It added flavor  to the salmon cakes I made w/ the leftovers for the next night's dinner.

I will make it again.  A great alternative to the sweet, soy, lemon, buttery marinades.  I used it on salmon mignon.

This is pretty good, although I wish it had a little sweetness.  I made it with boneless/skinless chicken breasts and they were very tender.  Only change:  I used 1/2T sesame oil and 1/2T canola oil, only because sesame oil can be overpowering.

A decent marinade even with less than an hour's marinade time.  I have all of the ingredients as staples except the cilantro, which was available from the corner store..

We absolutely love this marinade and no matter what other recipes we try we always come back to this recipe. We have shared it with friends and have never ever been disappointed with the way our chicken turned out.

We love cilantro and the  chicken stays so moist and tender using this marinade, it's a no brainer as what to do for dinner when chicken is the main course.  

We buy large thick chicken breasts and cut an opening before we marinade them so the inside of the chicken also gets marinaded.  Then we stuff them with roasted red peppers or mushrooms, depending on what we have on hand and hold them together with toothpicks before putting them on the grill. When they are done, we love to sprinkle the tops with blue cheese crumbles. delicious.

This is excellent. I used low sodium soy.  I suggest using more garlic and more fresh ginger.  I doubled the amount called for with fresh cod and the flavor was really good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing marinade!  I took the advice of adding 1/4 cup each of OJ and honey.  I also increased the white wine to 1 full cup and used a nice Chardonnay.  Finally, I used 4 large garlic cloves.  It worked very nicely on fish.

This is my new favorite marinade! YUM. We marinated salmon steaks for 30 minutes only which was perfect. I did not have ginger root or sesame oil on hand so I just used ground ginger and a touch of olive oil. DELICIOUS. This will be what we grill next time we have friends over.

This was great on boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used a 1/4 tsp of ground ginger and a tablespoon of dried cilantro, and let the meat marinate for 3 hours. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I marinaded salmon and shrimp with this for about a half-hour and then grilled on my electric grill. I kept with the recommendations here, adding probably double the cilantro.
It was delicious, although I would marinade longer next time.
