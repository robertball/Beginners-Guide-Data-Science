Wow...I am from Yakima too..living in Las Vegas! I knew that I had to try cooking something with this delectable concoction. My husband and I love curries of any kind so this was the next logical step. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I recently bought a coffee grinder at a yard sale for $2 and this will be it's maiden voyage. Thanks again Michelle...Happy Spices!

I love the fragrance of this mixture while you're grinding it. I don't prepare Indian dishes as often as I'd like, but having this blend ready will make it easier.

This is just right. I sift mine through a screen to get out some of the big stuff and the coriander seed husks.

This was a great blend for Garam Masala (warming spice).  I used it in an Indian Spice Rub and for making my Curry Powder blend.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

A good recipe, nice and flavourful, but needs some work. I think it was quite heavy on the coriander seed. It overpowered all other flavours in my final dish. The turmeric was a little heavy too. I'll redo this recipe with those two ingredients dialed back a bit. Thanks!

I make this same blend from a recipe I got from an Indian Cook Book around 20-25 years ago.  I always have these spices on hand and I'm sure I have saved quite a sum of money.  I do however keep my blend for up to 4 or 5 months depending on usage. I keep it in a airtight tin and it stays fresh till I have to make it again.

Garam Masala is one of those things where its much cheaper to buy it ready made and its pretty much perfect.  By the time you've stocked those other things which you wont be using for much else other than Garam Masala it would cost a lot more to make your own. I buy mine in a big bag - there's nothing to go wrong and they get their relative measurements down to a T.

Bought my spices in the bulk section of my local market, doubled the recipe.  Ended up with about 3/4 C by volume or 5 oz by weight for a cost of $15.25.   Not sure if this is a cost savings or not because I couldn't find prepackaged Garam Masala.  Love the complex toasty flavor!

This came out delicious.  I made it pan fried on pork chops- cast iron skillet.  As an intermediate chef, I could use better notation like capital T for tablespoon- I missed it when it turned to teaspoon.  I also think the powdered equivalent alongside the seed/pepper measure would be helpful.  I figured 2 chiles w/o seeds was a teaspoon and a half.

This was so much fun to make. And since I can make my own now I can cook as much Indian as I like!

This was my first time making this blend, and although I had all the spices to make it, I find having it pre-blended and ready to go is so much better than having to use all the spices in each recipe- as there are so many!  It turned out wonderful.  I followed the recipe as written and used it last night on steamed and then stir fried cauliflower with chicken sausage thrown in.  Delicious.  I'm looking forward to trying this spice blend on many dishes in the future!

I followed the directions except I used ground cardamom.  It was very easy & turned out good.  Glad to add this to my spices.

I cannot find garam masala in my area, but this mix seems all right. Not quite the right taste, maybe because there is no roasting or there is some other preparation trick I didn't know.

Loved this! I used ground cardamom (what I had on hand) & just added it with the turmeric. 
Thanks!

I ran out of turmeric and added a bit of “mild curry” that has turmeric. I hope to make it pure next time!
