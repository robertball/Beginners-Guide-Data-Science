This was a wonderful cabbage dish! I did not blanch the cabbage first; i simply added it to the skillet with the other vegetables and cooked it until it was wilted. i also omitted the tbsp of oil, as i thought the bacon grease was plenty.  I did not have white vinegar, so I used cider vinegar, and it worked out fine. Yum!

I made this for a homesick Czech friend, and he swears it tastes just like home.  However, I added extra celery (you want to use mature, flavorful outer celery stalks, not the soft inside ones), extra green pepper and extra onion.

I had to make this dish because my husband absolutely loves cabbage. He literally could not stop eating it! The only change I made was to add more vinegar to give it more of a tangy flavor.

We like cabbage in general, but this was especially delicious.  It is my favorite kind of cooking--simple, fast, with lots of flavor.  I subbed mushrooms for the celery, red pepper for the green pepper, cider vinegar for the white vinegar (those are what I had on hand and my general preferences anyway).  I took a bit of a short cut with the preparation and just threw all the veggies in the pan to saute together without cooking the cabbage first (okay, I'm lazy).  My husband and I practically licked the bowl clean.  Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe.

Didn't care for this at all.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I'm sure it was my fault.  I guess I really overcooked the cabbage because it was soft and didn't use real bacon.  I subbed turkey bacon cooked in the microwave.  Didn't have celery so had to leave that out and used cider vinegar instead.  I put a little sugar in it, but didn't help any.  I guess I can't complain because I didn't follow the recipe at all.  Oh well, guess I'd better learn a lesson from this one.  Thanks anyway.

I just loved it because it tasted like the inside of an egg roll, but without the greasy egg roll flavor.

Great.  Used all ingredients called for except for the oil - I poured off some of the bacon fat - left enough to use without adding oil - wanted bacon flavor.  I also just ended up cooking the cabbage with the veggies at the end.  I added the vinegar as soon as I put the veggies in the skillet to scrap up the bacon bits at the bottom of the skillet.  I also added a teaspoon of sugar.  It is wonderful the next day too.  Love it cold.  Thanks submitter.

Outstanding! Very fresh-tasting, and flavorful; we both loved it. Only thing I did differently was to skip step 1; mostly because I'm lazy. :) Still, all turned out well! Thanks for the keeper.

This tasted very authentically Czech, remniscent of the vegetable side dishes my husband and I were served in Prague. I made the recipe exactly as written (blanching the cabbage until it was tender but not completely limp) and it was perfect as is. We did add more salt at the table.

Used a little less than half a head, 2 slices of bacon, red onion, 3 small  stalks celery, 4 teaspoons vinegar, red pepper instead of green. Very tasty.

My mother and my MIL loved this, I thought it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about, and my husband said it was "good... for cabbage." The cabbage flavor is very strong. The vinegar and pepper temper that a bit, but its missing something.

My boyfriend and I really liked this dish!  To make it more of a main course we added a chicken breast and served it over noodles.  We browned the chicken before adding a 1/2 lb of bacon.  Later we cut the chicken up into small strips.  Just to season, not that it really needed it, we added hot sauce and a little paprika.  Like a lot of the other reviewers we did not blanche the cabbage before, just added all the veggies in at onces.  Delish!  I'll be making this one again!

I used a half pound of organic turkey bacon and probably a quarter cup vinegar.(I love it) I was lucky enough to get fresh cabbage out of a friend's garden.It's great the next day reheated in a pot,I added more vinegar also.Next time I would cook the cabbage a bit more though

Made this a couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize I was out of vinegar before I started.  So I substituted a sweet vinegar and olive oil dressing instead, and it was delicious!! Jason ate most of the pot full and declared it was "awesome".

Excellent - shredded approx 4 cups of green cabbage, 1/2 cup onion (shredded), cooked 5 slices or bacon, shredded 1 small red bell pepper (seeded and de-veined) and thinly sliced one stalk of celery.  Used 2 Tbls of bacon grease (no oil), 3 Tbls white vinegar, and otherwise followed the instructions, including blanching the cabbage.  Served with Czech Pork Roast, which was an unbelievable combination.

Admittedly, part of the reason I didn't enjoy this dish is that I expected something different.  I was expecting a nice savoury, oniony, bacony dish.  Maybe I did something wrong but mine just turned out like vinegary coleslaw with bacon in it, and WAY too much black pepper.  It was just OK - I ate some and put the rest in the fridge for later, but it would up getting thrown out as we couldn't be bothered to eat it.  I won't be making this again.

Cabbage, bacon, and vinegar?  I was skeptical at first but yum!  I didn't need any vegetable oil since I did not drain any bacon fat which probably made it even more tasty.  Definitely adding this one to my recipie collection!

Very Good!  I was trying to figure out how to use a head of cabbage I had in the refrigerator, and stumbled across this recipe.  The only change I made was using red pepper instead of green, which added a slight sweetness to it.  I also added garlic powder.  Might add cayenne pepper or flakes the next time around for extra zing.  Hubby loved it and took the leftovers to work the next day.

Tastes good and I would consider making again as a side (or a filling for egg rolls even!).  Definitely can vary it quite a bit with the amount of bacon, vinegar, etc for personal tastes.

I had some lightly steamed cabbage leftover from making cabbage rolls. I needed something to go with a meatloaf, so I did an ingredient search for cabbage and found this. This is a very easy side dish to make, and it was great. I will be making this again.

I followed this recipe very carefully and my hubby and I (both cabbage lovers) found this to be tasteless and boring.  I kept checking the recipe to see if I left something out, but I had not.  I know cabbage is a mild-flavored food, but this was very bland.  Sorry.... :o)

Hmmmm...As written, it was a bit too vinegary for my taste--but I added a bit more oil and a bit of sugar at the end to even out the taste.  I also cooked the cabbage with the vegetables and skipped the blanching step.  We enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe, although I would use it as a side dish to accompany a chicken dish such as chicken paprika or simply a roasted chicken. I did alter it a bit... I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, and I sauteed the cabbage with the rest of the veggies rather than blanching it. Instead of the white vinegar I opted for white WINE vinegar. I tasted it out of the pan and thought it to be a little bland, so I then added garlic powder and some paprika. I love the taste of cabbage and sour cream, so I served this in bowls with sour cream dots on the edges of the bowls. The end result was delicious! A great side dish.

I finally tried this as a guy who enjoys the cabbage.  My wife actually ate it and very much enjoyed it.  It is tough to please her food wise.  I'm rating this as a 5, simply as cabbage dishes go this is fantastic.

Made this and brought it into work. Everyone was hesitant to try it, but they all seemed to really like it. I think it's great. Thanks!

I make it also by putting everything in a skillet.First  half a slab of bacon cut into 1-inch squares cook until clear. then cut my head of cabbage in one inch squares, along with a cut up medium onion.  season with salt and pepper,cook until wilted. in a separate pot cook up some egg noodles until  soft. then mix the egg noodles with the wilted cabbage . I always added  a little bit of white vinegar in my bowl when eating it.

Do yourself a favour and make this dish. Like, right now. 
Because I'm dieting, I subbed in turkey bacon and used coconut oil instead of the bacon fat, but it's still amazing. @dlynn11, you mentioned your family made other versions - please post them if you know how to make them!

This is really good and filled with good stuff.  I doubled all the vegetables except for the cabbage.  Used half green and half red pepper and a little jalepeno pepper.  Bet it will be even better tomorrow.
Blanch the cabbage---don't fry it with the veggies.  Since cabbage is both thin and thick in the same head, you end up with some great crunchy pieces and a nice green color.

This cabbage dish was just delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the cabbage along with the vegetables.  Will be making this dish often.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe calls for regular pork bacon but we don't eat pork so I made this with turkey bacon. It still tasted pretty good but I think the fat and flavor from regular bacon would have mellowed the flavor of the cabbage and vinegar a little better and would have made for a better blend. I Added about 3 teaspoons of sugar to balance it out.  It is a very good recipe though next time I will add a little butter and more bacon and salt than this recipe calls for when using turkey bacon.

Delicious and so simple to make.  It's similar to Chinese moo shu, to the point that we put some of this in some moo shu wrappers I had in the freezer.  Also--I used turkey bacon instead of regular, to cut down the fat.

NOT very good. Unfortunately I made this when friends were coming for dinner and was so embarrassed at the way it came out, I offered to take them to grab some fast food elsewhere. Dang!

Good. I really thought the vinegar added a great touch. Could use a little more spices for my taste.

Excellent recipe.  My first attempt at "Capushka" and my whole family loved it.  However I made slight changes.  Changed 1/4 to 1/2 pound bacon, 2 celery stalks, yellow bell pepper, and added caraway seeds to the mix.  Also left about 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings with the one tablespoon of veg oil to saute the vegies.

I thought this was very good i think i added more vinegar to make it more flavorful, i also think that more bacon would have been really good. It was a bit greasy but that i my fault.

This was wonderful, a really delicious cabbage dish.  I used turkey bacon instead of pork and it was still really flavorful.  Just make sure to fry the bacon, not microwave (yuck!).  I did as other reviewers suggested and just threw the cabbage in with the veggies to cook and it turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely cook this again.
