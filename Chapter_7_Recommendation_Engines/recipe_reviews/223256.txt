Wow, never made this before but its my husband's favorite dessert so I thought I would give it a whirl...so easy and delicious, it was hard for us to stop eating.
Notes: I doubled the peaches (2 frozen bags), used 1/3 cup of white and 1/3 cup brown sugar, and I also put in a lil lemon juice in the saucepan while cooking the peaches. :)

I followed the recipe to a T and it was gummy.  Sorry, but way too sweet and the dough was just gummy.  Cool Whip at least made it palatable, somewhat, but one guest didn't eat any of it at all.  If I'd changed it in any way or not followed directions, I wouldn't review it as I think that's unfair, like saying I didn't really make this but it doesn't sound good.

First try at a cobbler and it was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will reduce the butter and add nutmeg. Great ideas!  Family loves it!!!

Too much butter and the dough was gummy and too sweet.  Not good at all. Had to throw it out.

I made this exactly like the recipe calls for, but next time I'm going to change a few things.  I am definitely going to cut the butter in half if not more.   This was way way to much butter.  Second I cut out some of the water that was in the peaches, about half.  Other than that it was pretty good.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  It was very sweet (I have an incredible sweet tooth and this was sweet even to me!) and, like one other reviewer mentioned, the batter turned out a little gummy.  I had friends who really liked it, but I prefer a more "biscuit" batter than what this recipe provided.

I like that the batter wasn’t so cakey as it is with some of the other peach cobbler recipes. However,  the butter on the bottom of the pan was too much. It congealed with the batter and made it a weird texture. The bottom and the edges were gummy-almost  like an aerated taffy. Just not good. Other than that, it had a good flavor  but I had to scrape out the good parts to serve it .  I’ll try it next time with much less butter on the bottom and put  tiny chunks of butter in the batter instead.

Way to sweet. Too much sugar. The peaches came out really nice but the batter is too sweet and buttery. Maybe cut back on sugar. I cute back to half the butter..maybe a couple of pats would be best

I whipped this up as my guests ate their dinner.  It was so easy and everyone loved it.  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and halved the butter.  Served it with vanilla ice cream.  Delish!

Used fresh peaches instead of canned. This was too sweet for our tastes. I will make it again but I will cut sugar and add a touch of cinnamon. An easy and tasty recipe.

Awesome recipe, I did decrease the butter in half and water as well. Used 1/ c brown sugar instead of white for the peaches and added cinnamon after reading reviews. Also let it bake about an extra 5 minutes. The desert was the best I have ever made. This ones a keeper!

My first time making this and I must say it was outstanding. I followed the recipe with the exceptions of adding 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon per some suggestions and used 2 bags of frozen (16 oz) peaches. I left the butter at 1 full stick and it was not to much at all. I used a 9x13 dish to cook it in, exactly 45 minutes and let cool for about 1 hour and added some ice cream to the plate. Will make again for sure and this was a big hit with my wife.

It was very good, but all the melted butter just sat on top and didn’t blend in at all. Next time I will cream the butter with the sugar. Also it needed about 10 min longer in the oven as some of the dough was still raw.

I added 2 eggs to the batter as other feedback was the batter tasted gummy.  Then there was not enough liquid to the dry good so I had to add peach juice to make it into a decent batter.  Then the batter baked up like an ugly brown pie.  I saved the effort by scooping out all of the "cobbler" and putting it into another pan.  I used frozen berries cooked with brown sugar and then topped the 'cobbler" with the berries.  Yikes!!!

This is the best cobbler recipe I've made.  I did make a few modifications.  I doubled the amount of fruit, and used half of the sugar called for (my frozen peaches were dusted with a tiny bit of sugar).  I thawed them and used the juice for the water in the recipe and added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  It came out just how we love it, a little bit tart and fruity.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy. This is my go-to peach cobbler recipe now when cooking for a crowd. It's quick to put together, and the call for frozen peaches means you can make it any time of year and don't have to slice them yourself! I reduce the sugar everywhere by 50% and find it's still sweet enough. I also sprinkle some cinnamon and nutmeg for extra spice. Thank you for sharing, Kelley!

It was great, everyone loved it, taste tests before we started eating had almost 25% of it eaten, turned out great, I did only use about half of the juice though because I do not like my peach cobbler runny, next Try I may add more peaches.  Got to add to the greatness, I was happy with how it turned out, family approved.

The fruit was delicious, but the cakes part was just a gooey, gummy mess. Thank goodness I sampled before using as dessert for guests. I ended up picking fruit off the top and serving over ice cream. The pictures look like most people put the fruit on the bottom instead of the top--maybe that is what I should have done.

This is an amazing and super easy recipe. I did make a few adjustments. You need 2/3 cup milk instead of a half cup for the dough batter. I also used an 8x8 pan and 2 15oz jars canned organic peaches (rinsed the syrup off of them) Frozen and thawed peaches seem a bit too mushy to use for this. Anyway, this was my first cobbler and it turned out exactly like i would have wanted from a restaurant! Try it!!!!

I used the suggestion to double the peaches and used two frozen bags.  I used brown sugar for 1/2 of sugar the recipe calls for.  I also added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and clove to the peaches.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream - delicious!

I had the middle of the night dessert munchies and decided to make this work what I had in the pantry.

I used a 16 oz can of canned peaches (did not drain the juice) and also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg while the peaches were warming. 

I was actually out of butter, so I substituted Country Crock instead.

I was worried the liquid would be too much so I poured all but about 1/4 cup on top of the peaches and batter.

This turned out so yummy and hit the spot! Perfect with cool whip or vanilla ice cream.

Delicious! Will make again but I will double it because my family will devour it.

Thanks for sharing!

Husband thought he would like frozen peaches with his breakfast cereals.  He didn't.  So had to find a recipe to use them up.  Tried this and it turned up so good we now buy frozen peaches on purpose.  Highly recommend eating it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yum!

I did not care for this recipe. Figured out later that cooking the peaches on the stove in water and sugar step should be skipped completely. Do not add water or cook on stove. Cobbler turns out perfect without this step. Probably should have cooked bread separately and added to fresh peach and sugar after carmalizing it with a torch.

First time I think I ever made a cobbler. I was very happy.

Warm & Super-Yum! Probably will be good cold, too.

 I used 1 bag of frozen peaches, one fresh peach, blueberries & strawberries ('cause I had to use them up) + ground cardamom.

Thank you for such a foolproof, delicious recipe!

I've actually made this twice; the second time, for my workmates,(I'm a cook in a restaurant) I doubled the recipe. I used a 2 lb. package of frozen peaches, and baked in a 13 X 9 dish. I also put a rimmed baking sheet underneath the dish, to catch the bits of overflow. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of cinnamon.

I was skeptical when the recipe had me put the butter in the bottom of the baking dish and not in the dough mix. But, wow, did it turn out good! I have a freezer full of our last years peaches and needed to do something with them so I tried this recipe. I did add some fresh ginger and Meyer lemon zest to the peaches as well as a 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom. It added a bit of warmth and depth of flavor to the dish. Delicious! I will make it again!

I followed the changes another user suggested.  I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 cup milk.  I did not add the extra juice from the pot of peaches, I felt it was juicy enough.  I did add two cups of frozen blueberries at the last minute to the pot and let them defrost.  I then added the peaches and blueberries to the batter.  I cooked it for almost 50 minutes.

Yes. I added a little lemon juice, cinnamon , nutmeg and vanilla to the saucepan with the peaches. Also instead of using all white sugar in the saucepan, I divided equally between white and brown.  Delicious

I thought this recipe was way too sweet.  I made it again, reducing the sugar drastically.  It Was way better.  Still needs some cinnamon I think.  Would also try adding little chopped pieces of cream cheese.

I have followed this recipe many times. Every time I make it, it comes out delish. I followed the recipe to a T the first time, but suggest adding a little (like 1/2 teaspoon) cinnamon to the crust.

Making this for the 2nd time in one week by request.  I made it in two pans last week and it was superb the next day!  It was so good that my host only allowed me to eat a small portion of the cobbler I brought over! LOL!!

I made this exactly as written except I didn't have all-purpose flour so I used whole wheat flour, and I used a mix of frozen mango and peaches. Oh my stars it was amazing and the whole wheat flour gave it an amazing nutty flavor. Don't think I will ever make it with all-purpose flour again.

My husband loves this recipe and it is so easy! I do usually cut down the butter serving to half of what it calls for. I have also mixed canned and frozen peaches and it is all great!

I've never made a cobbler before and my husband asked me to make him a peach cobbler.  I followed the recipe as directed and he loved it! From now on, this will be my go to cobbler recipe when he's in the mood for cobbler!!
