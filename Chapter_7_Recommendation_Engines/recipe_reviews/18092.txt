Yum-eee.  I switched this up a bit by reducing the sugars to 1C br. sugar and 1/2C white sugar (as I was going to add a glaze to the finished cake), replacing 1C of the flour with whole wheat flour and adding 1/4 tsp cardamom along with the cinnamon.  And as dense as the batter was, it baked evenly and was done at 35 min (in a glass pan).  Then, to gild the lily, I poured Caramel Frosting VI on top.  Moist, apple-y... just plain delicious.  Thanks!

This recipe makes 6 mini loaf cakes. They turned out very moist and delicious, and they froze and thawed very well. Using them for the upcoming holidays for homemade gifts for family and friends.

I've been making this cake for years. I love this cake and so does eveyone that tries it. I use half the amount of nuts (we dont care too much for nuts), but I add that same amount of raisins (we like the chewyness it gives). To top it off I brush a little melted margarine to the top of the cake and then sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar. Perfect! It's more like a coffee cake to me so it's perfect for breakfast.

Awesome apple cake!  I omitted the nuts due to personal taste.  I used four McIntosh apples with a fairly fine chop to obtain the desired four cups.  In addition to the cinnamon, I added sprinkles of nutmeg, cloves, and pumpkin pie spice.  The resultant cake was a beautful dark brown with a crackled appearance.  The cake is beautifully moist and rich, with a spicy apple-y flavor.  Great with Caramel Frosting VI from this site.

This was excellent.  The batter is very thick.  Will try with 1/2 cup less sugar next time.  I grated the apples. Used the caramel glaze from Fresh Apple Cake III.

Wow!  Got lots of "hum hum" from first bites on!  Everyone went for seconds.  An absolutely wonderful cake.  I ommitted the nuts, but it still resulted in a really delightful cake.  You must try this recipe.

great recipe! Lost my favorite apple cake recipe so tried this one.  The key is using the right apples for the recipe.  Use only cooking apples, not too sweet and not too watery.  The info available at store.  Used one tsp of cinnamon instead of 2. Used 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup of oil.  Only used one tsp of vanilla.  Used pecans instead of walnuts and cut the apples thin and about 1/4 inch long. The mixing directions I followed perfectly.  I made 2 cakes to share and one baked in 40 min. and one in 45.  Just watch the cake.  If not using right away be sure to ventilate when covered or gets a little moist on top.  Only used cool whip for topping.  Icing of some sort not needed.  I will definetly make this again

This is the best apple cake recipe!  The cake was  moist and not too sweet.  Very tasty and easy to prepare.  I followed this recipe exactly the way the author suggested and I was totally satisfied.  I also think that using red apples adds to the moistness of the cake.  I have tried it with Granny Smith Apples and it was pretty dry and lacked sweetness.  Excellent RECIPE!

Easy and simple recipe! It's very moist and delicious. I like it as it is without icing, but it also tastes great with buttercream icing on it.

I've used this recipe for years, as dessert with cream cheese frosting and, unfrosted, I serve it for breakfast. I noticed that another reviewer found the cake to be sticky. I've discovered that if you cover the cake overnight, even after being completely cooled, the top will be "sticky" the next morning -  a result of the moisture in the apples, I assume. If I plan to serve it at breakfast the following morning, I leave it uncovered overnight. It doesn't dry out and the texture and appearance are more appealing.

This cake was moist and delicious!  Everyone who tasted it asked asked for seconds.  I added a thin layer of caramel to the top of the cake after it came out of the oven, and that certainly kept the cake moist and delicious.  I also added more apples, so it had to cook longer, but it was well worth the wait.   Great recipe!

AWESOME CAKE!!!  Also made the Caramel Frosting VI from this site and it made it even better. The "Frosting" is more of a glaze that needs to be put on the cake while it is still warm. The only changes I made were for preference and what I had on hand.

I wanted to try something different in a cake so I chose this apple cake recipe.  It is the best cake I ever ate.  My daughter, who is not a cake lover, absolutely loved it.  It was easy to make and if you love apples and love cake, this is the recipe.

Well...this has potential, but it's not there yet.  It was soggy towards the bottom of the pan.  I would recommend decreasing the amount of apples and making them as small as possible - maybe it will decrease the amount of moisture.  Just a note - this is almost the exact recipe I use for carrot cake from allrecipes.com and that is an amazing cake!

Very moist and delicious!!  I only made 2 minor substitutions:  instead of using all vegetable oil, I substituted applesauce (recipe from this site) for half.  I also omitted nuts and added 1/2 c raisins because family doesn't like nuts.  I WILL be making this many more times in the future.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is my rave review for this cake.  The first thing we noticed was that it tasted almost exactly like a dense, moist Welsh cake that my Aunt was given by her MIL about 80 years ago.  It had 5 or 6 spices in it with raisins and nuts.  It was called Cake Brith (Welsh).  It had no apples in it, yet it tastes similar.  I'm making one to take to my sister who is having breast cancer surgery tomorrow.  I'm positive she and hubby will enjoy it as well.  I followed this recipe exactly, but halved it for 2 of us.  The next one will be 9X13 in size.  I used Granny Smiths and it was perfect in taste, moisture and texture.  I'm adding raisins next.  Thank you for sharing a delicious treat.  It's a keeper.

This was wonderful! Very delicious, everybody loved it. I did think it was too sweet so maybe next time I'll cut down the sugar. 

I omitted the nuts and added a sprinkle of ground ginger, otherwise I followed as written. Very good.

Delicious and just the right amount of sweet.  Served it plain with whipped cream and it went over famously.  Would be good with ice cream too.

Great recipe. Only change I made was to cut the recipe in half and bake in a 9x9 pan (there's only two of us) and I used a bit less sugar and substituted about 1/3 of it with brown sugar (wanted a more carmel flavor). Turned out wonderful and the house smells heavenly! Husband fighting urge for seconds.  Try a litte whipped cream on it - Yum!

I just made this for the first time, it's really moist and sweet. Great way to get rid of leftover apples, too. Easy and rather fast to make.     I didn't use any frosting, just sprinkled a little sugar and cinnamon on top. Served it when it was still a little warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but I guess whipped cream will go well with it, too.

We loved this.  I just made half a recipe which was just right for the two of us. I used Jonathan apples but I still didn't use all the sugar it called for and it was very sweet. Next time I will try the butter/sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on top.

The most "apple" taste of the apple cakes! I've been making this for years with great reviews. The only differences in my recipe: 1 tsp soda instead of 2, Granny Smith apples, FINELY chopped, 3 tsp cinnamon instead of 2 & I use pecans. For those who take issue with the sweetness, too much vanilla or soda-like taste, using my recipe will address those problems. Granny Smiths are very tart (especially the greenest ones). By the way, vanilla is known to impart an impression of sweetness. I sometimes bake it in a tube pan for 1 hr. 10 minutes. And I've never needed icing (& I love icing!) Great with vanilla caramel ice cream.

Great recipe.  Similar to a carrot cake.  I used all brown sugar, and added 1/2 t. fresh grated ginger.  Frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting with minced candied ginger and rum added to it. Yum Yum Yummy.  Should be able to rate this above a 5.

this recipes was amazing and was finished in one day.  i was a little hesistant at first when i was making it because i felt as if there was too much apple and too lil dough but in the end it worked out perfectly.  soft apples.  would of been even better w. a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce but that gets too sweet.

Delicious cake!  I took this to an event and it was a hit.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II on this cake, but it would be good without frosting too.

After reviewing the alterations of this recipe, I changed the following: 1/3 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce, 1 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar. I thought the sweetness was perfect for my taste. The cake was definitely moist, and light even. It's delicious right out of the oven, but sets up when cooled. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! Not exactly a cake, but tastes good no matter what you call it. To make it a bit healthier, I used 1/4 cup of veg oil and a 1/4 cup of applesauce as a substitute. Also cut the sugar by using 1 1/2 cup with the 1/2 cup coming from Splenda's brown sugar blend.

A WONDERFUL CAKE!  In an attempt to save some calories I substituted Splenda for half of the sugar and substituted 4 egg whites for the two whole eggs.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This was a great apple cake - it smelled SO good while it baked, and the taste was not a letdown after the smell!  I frosted it with Fluffy White Frosting, a cooked and whipped frosting I found on this site.  It was good, but I would probably have enjoyed the cake just as much without frosting.  I only needed to bake it about 40 minutes?

I was worried about making an apple cake, but now I have no idea why! My cake was a huge hit, tasted excellent, and was nice and moist on the inside. I didn't need walnuts or icing. Thanks for the recipe!

Delish! I made this for a church 'harvest celebration' potluck, topped with caramel frosting VI from this site.  I also used apples from my gravenstein tree, so that helped with the yumminess :)  I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar only (no white). Also, I tossed the cinnamon in with the sugar/apple mix, and added about 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  It was excellent! I will keep this, and definitely make it again!

I'm sorry, I did not like this recipe.  I found it to be bland and I seemed to keep tasting the soda. It didn't seem to bother my husband, but my son did not care for this cake at all.  I feel bad to give such a low rating, but the taste was a 3 star experience for me.

Good but missing a topping and had too many apples. I highly recommend using 1 cup of apples maybe two if you want it to be appley.  Also, it is important to use grannismith apples. I used mactintosh and they are too soft.Cake became too watery like a sponge. I cooked at 350 for 30 mins and any longer would have burned. yummy. will make it again. followed everything else exact. smelled great in the oven. yummy cake.

Delicious, moist, like an apple spice cake.  I didn't frost it - thought it was fine just like it said.  Came out dark on top - thought I'd overcooked it, but it was perfect.

This apple cake is SO good, you better freeze half of it or it's gone before you know it.  My husband even said that it was GOOD and he's a fussy eater. I used one and one-half cups of white sugar and one-half cup of brown sugar.  This cake needs no topping; it's wonderful just as it is!

Amazing! This is a NEVER-FAILED recipe at all! I'm not really into baking, so I'm not really confident when I want to try a recipe. But not this one, I already made it few times now. I change several things, though: I replace half of the oil with apple sauce and replace the nuts with muesli with dried fruits. It's even tastier! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I added 1/8 tsp. each  ground cloves, ginger, and allspice.  This is the best fresh apple cake I have ever made.   It gets better each day, and I did not add any frosting.

We really loved this.  We used probably too many apples.  Also the pan we used was 8.5 x 11 pyrex.  We wrapped wet dishtowels around the perimeter of the baking dish while it baked, to avoid uneven baking (so the edges won't overcook).  Next time I will use exact amount of apples.  Granny Smiths, tasted delicious.  Oh,, I also added about a teaspoon of allspice.

The cake turned out absolutely delicious!  It was just as good straight from the oven as it was the following day after the spices had combined.  To lighten up the cake, I used cinnamon sweetened apple sauce instead of oil.  I also added a 1/3 cup of chopped dates.  The cake was very moist and the cinnamon flavor really accentuated the taste.

This is an excellent easy apple cake. I also reduced the sugar per other reviewers suggestions. Turned out very moist and needed no icing at all. I will definitely be making this one again.

This recipe is a keeper.  I added cream cheese icing on top with sifted cinnamon and sugar.  It is extremely moist and flavorful.  This is the best apple cake I've ever had!  My family loved it.

I have been a vegan for over a year, and constantly look for good recipes to adapt.  I used egg replacer instead of eggs, and like others, cut the sugar in half. I also added raisins, and it was sooo good!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I couldnt agree more! This is wonderfully moist and "cinammony"; reminds me of the delicious cakes I would have in Germany.  For me it is sweet enough without adding any kind of topping, but I imagine adding a carrot cake style icing would be great. I followed this recipe making no changes apart from using wholewheat flour and pecans. Thanks!

My whole family loved this apple cake especially with the cream cheese icing that I made to go with it.  It filled the whole house with such a good smell and was great eaten fresh or warmed up briefly in the microwave.  Really good.

This a very moist apple cake. Loved it. I added nutmeg and cloves to the recipe. I also Substituted half the amount of white sugar for brown sugar. That’s really all I did to the recipe. It turned out moist and it just melts in your mouth. Will do it again on a larger scale because I adjusted the recipe to make a loaf cake (10 servings).

Husband loved it,  but I did make a few changes  I used 1 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar.  The vegetable oil  I decreased to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce To make it a 5 star perhaps I'll add a pinch of nutmeg next time. But this is a recipe I'll make again and again

I have had this recipe for 45 years and make it quite often. I add a t. of vanilla and cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. With the natural sugar from the apples, I think less is more. I occasionally bake these as muffins for my grandsons. This cake is a family favorite and is Expected on my daughter's birthday. I guess I would call it comfort food.

The cake is outstanding, great texture with tender pieces of apple.  I used cake flour.  I made 3 cakes, one with vanilla, one with almond extract and one with lemon extract.  All are great.

This cake was so Moist and delicious!  I made a few changes; I added 1/8 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 tsp baking powder (I omitted the baking soda) . I reduced the sugar to 1cup dark brown and 1/2 cup white.  I mixed the brown sugar with the apples which I finely chopped. I added 2 tbsp of melted butter and whisked it with the 1/3 cup oil, the eggs and vanilla.  And on the suggestion of another viewer Iserved it with the caramel sauce from the fresh apple cake III. Wonderful. Oh, I used Braeburn apples.

I followed some suggestions...reduce the sugars to 1 C br. sugar and 1/2 c white sugar.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I made the basic cream cheese frosting.  OMG!!!  It is so delicious and not "sugary" sweet.  It was a smashing hit.  I must give thanks to all the reviewers.  Oh, depending on your own oven, I suggest begin checking for doneness after 30 minutes.  And one more thing, chopping the apples into small pieces does the trick!!!

Could be habit forming  and dangerous to your undersized wardrobe.  Made this yesterday to compliment a Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner for friends and it was a total success when complimented with Vanilla Ice Cream.  If you want,  a half cup of chopped walnuts is sufficient and Granny Smith apples are best.  Will do again.

Make this cake! So simple and easily customizable. No mixer or special equipment needed. Your home will instantly smell like Fall. 

I've made this exactly as written and with my own changes. You can easily add more spices like nutmeg, cloves or ginger according to your taste. Subbing some of the for for graham flour or finely ground oatmeal gives it a lovely new texture. I typically make it with half the sugar and I don't miss it at all! 

My favorite way to serve it is with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. The cake is delicious and most and doesn't ( in my humble opinion) need anything else! 

Tip: After the first day, the cake will get a little sticky/moist, so store it in the fridge so it will last longer. To restore this cake to it's fresh out of the oven crispiness, reheat in the toaster oven for a few minutes and then serve. Enjoy!

I always read the reviews before I make something, I find other experienced cooks and bakers have similar issues with recipes. I saw that it was a heavy batter and dry, so lightened it up by adding 1/2 cup milk, alternately with the flour. I also cut down the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and it was plenty sweet enough. The biggest thing I found, is that it was quite brown and well done at 37 or 38 minutes, so took it out - probably 45 minutes is too long for lots of ovens? Thank you for sharing.

I planned to make an apple cake for a work event, but at the last minute I realized that I didn't have any butter so I went looking for a recipe without.  This was so similar to my original recipe, but I guess there is just something about butter that makes things better.  This was good and everyone enjoyed it, but just not as much as my original.

I made this today and we love it!  I had some winesap apples that were too tart to just eat raw.  They did excellent in this recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  Will use this again!

Yes i did, i decided to make an extra half recipe to this recipe.   I used brown sugar to half and i also added lemon juice to apples to keep them fresh looking.  I've made it twice so far.  I also frozen one in vacuum pack machine for winter.  Delicious

I used 11/2 cups of brown sugar only and chopped the apples quite small.  Everyone in my family loved it!  Would make it again.

We used 1 c dark brown & 1/2 c white sugar to get caramel apple flavor. Frosted with white cream cheese icing then drizzled with caramel. Incredible! from grandkids to grandparents... all loved it.

Great recipe for when you have lots of apples to use up!  When mixing it up, it looks like there won't be enough batter but it cooks up to be a moist, spongy and very Apple-y cake. I omit the nuts, only use 1/2 cup sugar, all whole wheat flour and it is plenty sweet.

Substituted applesauce for 2/3 of the oil. Used about 1/3 whole wheat flour. Very small dice  for apples. Came out moist, tender, with great flavor.

Love this recipe. I baked mine with a sweet potato pie inside....the latest rage, pie cake, and topped it with caramel frosting vi and toasted walnuts. The cake part was perfect for a 10 in. Springform pan (buttered parchment round on bottom) and 7 inch pie, and it baked dark and dense, moist and delicious. (See pic) I had to bake it an hour and 20 minutes, and it was difficult to tell when it was done since it was so thick, but basically felt the middle of the top for firmness. The edges were carmelized and yummy chewy,  sooo good. The batter was very thick before adding the apples, but 4 cups of apples took care of that. Would definitely make this again!

Fantastic cake !!  Well, it was fantastic.with the changes I made. Lol 
It's way way better with Fuji apples !  I also added tons more cinnamon....I.love it so much so I just dump it in.  I bake it about ten to fifteen minutes longer too. Then to top it off, I drizzle my homemade maple icing on it, some while the cake is fairly warm so it seeps in some, then more when the cake is very very cool so it will harden a bit.  People beg me to make this cake, and just make up excuses so I'll make it. Lol.

Way too sweet and I only used 1cup of sugar. I also cut up the apples in very small bitesize pieces. One thing I did do wrong was I misread the recipe and added the apples with the sugar last. Don't think it made much of a difference through. Maybe my apples were sweeter than most.

For this recipe, I used only 350gr of chopped apples to become drier and half raisins/half nuts because I think they taste great on cakes. I baked this cake for my university group and they all loved it. I am definitely doing it again! The downside of it was that it burned a little on the bottom, so I would advice to keep the same cooking temperature and keep an eye on when to switch to top heating.  When done, I also advice to let it cool in the fridge first and then cut in pieces because I started cutting and the crust was breaking very easily.

Made this for a girlfriend who needed a dessert to share at school.  It is moist but thought it was missing something.   Sprinkled powdered sugar on top, once cooled.

I used 1 cup of honey instead of 2cups sugar and used almond flour instead of regular, a very easily adaptation for lower carb and healthier sugar. If you use almond flour and honey you need to add an extra egg so it firms up better. It was SO good!! Yum yum yum!!!

Easy to follow recipe with ingredients usually on hand. Made some changes for a healthier lower calorie version. Used very large apples which made it very moist. Used 1 part unbleached flour and 1 part whole wheat flour. Added ground flax meal 3 tbls. Cut the sugar by 1/2 cup as the apples make it sweet enough. Overall great success for my girls get together.

A FABULOUS GLUTEN FREE DESSERT! Here's how: Substitute the 2 c. flour with 2 c. of "Gluten Free Perfect Flour Blend" by Namaste Foods. It's delicious and moist! I also omitted the nuts (personal preference), cut the sugar down to 1-1/2 c. and left the skins on the apples. Why strip all the nutritional value off? Baked it for 45 min. and it was perfecto. Julia Child would be so proud of me--to adapt a recipe and make it healthier so this way I can "have my cake and eat it too"!

Very good cake, made with 2 large Granny Smith apples and substituted 1 c of brown sugar for 1 c of white sugar, used 1 c of raisins instead of the walnuts and topped with powdered sugar glaze as soon as it was removed from the oven. Cooking time in an aluminum 9x13 pan was only 31 minutes however. Make sure to check cake after about 30 minutes .

This was good but 45 minutes was too long in a glass 9x13. I should have checked it sooner but I'm guessing it was probably done closer to 30 mins. If you reduce the sugar, add more spices.

I was skeptical that it only called for 2 cps flour with the same amount of sugar, and just a small amount of oil. It was too dry to even stir with the recipe as is so I added a little milk and some applesauce. I am trying to cut back on the oil and applesauce works great. I turned the oven down to 325 and baked it for about an hour and 1/2. It is very dense, and full of flavor. I like that. The apples are just done enough. I really like it. I forgot the nuts, though. I was nervous about the ingredient ratios. All in all, it's good. I will make it again. Thanks

Bravo! It's a wonderfully delicious cake!   Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I made this cake and it was a winner at our house. One thing I did, was instead of frosting the cake, I put minature butter brickle chips on the top before baking. Kind of gives it a caramel apple taste - especially yummy recipe for the fall.

Love this simple apple cake.  As written it is very, very good but because of our taste buds I subsitute half melted unsalted butter for some of the oil.  Thanks for a great contribution and it also keep very, very well - but does not usually last too long!!!!

Loved it!  Great way to use extra apples.  I cut oil a little and substituted some applesauce.  Also did the butter/sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on top (suggested by another reviewer) instead of frosting.  Will definately make again.

This is a wonderful recipe. The only thing different was I added butter sauce and omitted nuts. I used real whip cream. My favorite of the apple cakes is the raw apple cake recipe from this sight. I made both of these late fall and will probably try a few more apple cakes as that, pies  and chocolate deserts are my favorite things to bake. Well; I do love to bake cookies and cheese cake too!(actually any desert)

This cake certainly did not live up to the rave reviews I read here. I thought the cake was over-run by the vanilla extract. I used pink lady apples that we picked from the orchard, they were sweet and juicy. I added a tablespoon each of lemon and orange juices to the sugar/apples mix to keep the apples from browning and b/c some reviewers noted the cake was dry. The didn't hold together when done but that may have been b/c I didn't chop the apples very finely. I guess the biggest disappointment was the overwhelming vanilla taste. I'll not make this again. I want an apple cake that tastes like apples.

This cake had great flavor, but it turned out very sticky and kind of fell apart in some places after I baked it. Here are the changes that I made: I baked it in a bundt pan, added 1 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I let it cool on a rack for about 3 hours and it still didn't come out of my VERY greased pan all the way. I think that if I make it again I will add more flour to bind it better and flour my pan along with the grease.

Thought this was a good recipe. I used 5 cups of jonagold apples and kept everything else the same even the sugar since i used more apples.  it's a tad sweet but not too much so.  I thought the sides and top were a little over cooked but I had to cook it for almost 55 minutes for the spring back action to take place.  other than that, the inside is nice and moist and my husband thought it was really yummy.  I think it would be good with some fresh whipping cream on top!

This was good and may be better tomorrow, but it's not the best fresh apple cake I've had--it has a discernible baking soda taste. I used part brown sugar and part WW flour. I frosted with a brown sugar, powdered sugar, butter, & milk icing.

It was good.  I think I overbaked it by accident, but it was still really moist and everyone at work loved it.  Next time, I will chop the apples smaller and add a little cloves and nutmeg.

This is a great recipe!  I've made it twice and I don't use the nuts.  The first time we did frost it for a party and today I made another, but left it unfrosted.  This is a keeper for us!

This was a pretty good cake, similar to the Pear Bread recipie on this site. I was surprised to find it was not overly sweet even with the 2 cups of sugar. I was able to use up a bunch of really old apples. I used almond extract because I was out of vanilla. The cake was moist delicious. I also added more cinion, another teaspoon. Next time I'll try adding cardamon or nutmeg.

Wow!  We just had a piece hot out of the oven and it was just what we were looking for.  We used braeburn apples, omitted the nuts because we didn't have any, and the frosting because it's so nice and simple by itself.  Delicious!
