This was really, really good. The texture was fabulous - light bust very moist. I subtituted the lemon extract with about 2 tbsp lemon juice and the rind of 1/2 a lemon, and the shortening with unsalted butter. Oh, and I used skim milk. : )

I'm giving this cake four stars because I felt what really made it amazing (even my father went back for seconds! unheard of!) was the lemon glaze I topped it with (just mix lemon juice, confectioners sugar, and lemon rind) and the lemon ricotta creme I served on the side. The combination was oustanding. For the ricotta creme, I just threw about a cup of ricotta (part skim), tbsp lemon juice, lemon rind from one lemon, 1 tbsp half and half, and maybe 2 tbsp sugar? because you can throw it all in the blender, you can really just adjust to your liking.

Wonderful recipe. This is probably the new family favorite!

Excellent cake-very moist. I made a couple of substitutions.  I didn't have cake flour, so I did 1 3/4 all purpose flour, 1/4 corn starch.  Also didn't have shortening, so I used butter instead.  I used the zest and juice of two lemons instad of the extract (although possibly didn't need that much zest).  Only had skim milk on hand, which worked fine.  I iced it with a lemon icing and topped with strawberries. Yum!

thanks for the great recipe! it's wonderful. however, i would liek to suggest some additions to this recipe. can try adding some lemon zest and fresh lemon juice in place of the lemon extract for a nice lemony taste. :)

these are fabulously light & moist!
i think you could sub almost any extract for the lemon and have fantastic results...vanilla, almond, they'd all be just as good if you don't happen to like lemon.
i did make these as cupcakes and baked them for about 12-15 minutes and they came out perfect. I frosted them with the lemon icing from this site and they were simply delightful.
yum, yum. :)

Reallly, really good! I cut this recipe in 1/2 to make 1 cake. Tastes like a fluffy, lemony marshmellow. Delicious!

Great, subtle lemon flavor. For true lemon lovers, add a little lemon extract to the frosting.

I plan on making this, but first I must let people know that often I log on to a recipe I know I would like. However, I pass them over mainly because of the reviews I read that people review only based on their changes. Simply put, try the recipe, review, if you don't like it, edit with your changes, submit it and wait until it is then selected and added to the new recipes. Seems fair. I know it takes awhile to have your recipe selected, but play fair, do not speed up the process by adding "YOUR" recipe in your review of another member. Just saying!

i have this cake in the oven at the moment so i will be back when it's done to update.  i did make some modifications as follows: i didn't have cake flour so i subbed 1 3/4 c all purpose flour + 1/4 c corn starch, rather than lemon extract i used the juice of two lemons + the rind of 1 lemon, and lastly, rather than 1/2 c shortening i used 1/2 c unsalted butter.  usually i LOVE the taste of cake batter but to be honest the taste of this batter didn't have me licking the beaters. :(  i REALLY hope this cake will taste better once cooked! UPDATE:  what a disappointment... this cake is nothing other than a mock angel food cake.  it didn't rise much and it actually fell a little in the middle (had it been in a tube pan like a normal angel food cake that wouldn't have happened).  because it fell the center of cake is a bit gummy while the edges taste pretty decent (but like i said, like an angel food cake).  if you're looking for a good lemon cake i recommend looking for another recipe.  i won't try this recipe again. :(

So good!  It had the perfect amount of sweetness and just the right amount of lemon flavor.  I filled the layers with blackberry jam and topped it with lemon cream.  It almost tasted like a brunch cake.  I will definitely make this again.

Very yummy!  I used the fresh lemon juice and lemon rind like other people had suggested. I also added poppyseeds because I had some and figured I should start using them up.  They added a nice crunch to the cake.  I cooked it in a bundt pan because I was running short on time and figured it would look nicer in it than in a plain pan. After it cooled I just drizzled a glaze over it.  (1 cup icing sugar, and the juice and rind from half a lemon and a little water to make it a little more porable) It turned out really well with a nice tart lemon flavor.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I took the other reviews into consideration and made this with the juice and zest of one lemon.  It was great but would have been fine with even a little bit more lemon.

I used this for cupcakes and baked them for 15 minutes.  I had to double the recipe at the last minute because the batter was only enough for about 18 cupcakes and I was bringing them to a party.  I topped them with a homemade cream cheese frosting and garnished with a fresh raspberry - they were a huge hit!

This is a really good cake, I served to my family and they all loved it. I followed the directions and used two 10 inch cake pans along with the Lemon custard filling from the "Lemon cake with Lemon filling, and Lemon butter icing recipe, and sprinkled the to with powered sugar. Chilled it and served for dessert! Will make again!

Great cake..maybe a teeny bit dry.  You have to use some sort of moistening icing or frosting to moisten it up - like a lemon curd or a syrup or something. But it had a great taste and got tons of compliments.  Freezes and decorates well.

Excellent! I prepared this as a stack of mini-Bundt cakes. Like most other reviewers I thought the recipe on its own would not be lemony enough so I zested an entire lemon into the batter, added a few teaspoons of lemon juice, and frosted it with a frosting that also used fresh lemon juice. When life hands you a lemon -- make this cake! :)

Yum! I made this as cupcakes to decorate for Easter. I added the zest of one lemon in addition to the lemon extract and I think the flavour is just right. I also reduced the sugar by about 1/4 cup. One recipe made 24 small cupcakes (2.25" diameter) and 24 mini (1.75" diameter). The texture and taste is similar to angel food cake, but not quite as light. I'm happy to have found another recipe to use up egg whites. I will make this again.

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was fantastic.  The only change I made was I added the zest of one lemon for extra lemony flavor.  I iced it with a lemon cream cheese icing and used lemon jelly slices for decoration.  It was a huge hit.  You could easily substitute lime or orange for the lemon for variety.  I will definitely make this again.

this cake was the best , light and fluffy: I did add lemon juice, orange juice, and lemon and orange zest to give it some flavor. after reading other reviews I saw that I would need to add some flavor, very zesty cake, topped it off with whip topping mixed with crushed pineapples and instant vanilla pudding. it was great

I used regular flour instead of cake flour and that might have been my problem. I also used rind and juice of a lemon instead of extract. The cake was okay but quite heavy. I whipped the whites and softly folded them in but maybe it's the altitude, I can never get a whisked whites cake to work for me here. Thanks anyway, I'm definately going to keep looking for my lemon cake recipe.

My bad.  I greased but did not flour the cake pans.  And I used all-purpose flour.  It did not singularly come apart from the pan.  So I used it as a basis for a bananna split cake, layering the cake, vanilla pudding, strawberries and banannas.  The cake itself was divine.  I should have floured the cake pans.

Meh... I didn't think the lemon extract would be enough lemon flavor. I followed other reviewer's advice and used fresh squeezed lemon juice in place of the lemon extract and added fresh grated lemon zest. It still wasn't lemony enough for my taste. I will make this again, but add even more lemon juice and lemon zest, as I like my lemon cake to be very lemony. I think there is some room to play with the recipe. The texture and moisture was great, just not lemony enough for me.

was very moist but not enough lemon. I added extra lemon extra and lemon juice and it still was very bland. Good cake but I was looking for something really lemony. I enjoyed the boxed mix much better.

Used the cake flour substitute (1 3/4 C AP and 1/4 C Cornstarch) and made into cupcakes. Turned out great although you could still taste flour. Perhaps just a little more extract could fix that. It wasn't a deal breaker for me. Made lemon curd that used the remaining 3 egg yolks (juice of 2 lemons, 3 egg yolks, ~8 tbsp sugar, 4 tbsp butter) and filled the cupcake with a little of it. Also topped it off with the Lemon Icing from this site. Thought it might be lemon overload but I guess this is where the subtle lemon flavor of the cake was a good thing.

would have liked to have rated this 4.5 stars...only reason not a 5 is that the lemon flavor is not as intense as needed...I used lemon juice and next time will add more...I will also use zest next time...didn't because I had made a lemon filling that was quite zesty and did not want to overpower the cake.  This batter is wonderful.  Cake was slightly less "fluffy" than I wanted, but a friend said it was fabulous!  She doesn't even really like lemon!  Will bookmark this one...I think a double recipe making at least 3 layers; cake would hold up to spliting and would be beautiful with multi-layers filled with a lovely lemon curd or filling.  I was also thrilled with the simplicity of the recipe.  Thanks!  a keeper.

I made this by substituting the lemon extract with zest of 1 lemon & about 5 tbsp fresh lemon juice.  I thought it was a little floury tasting with almost no lemon at all. I like the moistness & texture, but I'll try the lemon extract next time.

This is a wonderful, dense, moist cake.  I used lime juice and zest instead of the lemon.  I used about 4 table spoons of lime juice and the zest from one lime.  I also glazed it with a lime glaze.  (1 cup icing sugar, 1 tbsp margerine, 2 - 4 tbsp lime juice).  It was delicious!  Even my boyfriend liked it and he is not a fan of cake.  I made this in a bundt pan.  It makes a small bundt but because the cake is so rich the size was just right.  Oh, I also substituted the shortening for a 1/2cup square/stick of margerine.

I had to substitute regular flour for the cake flour, but that is very easy to do (1 cup flour  minus 2 tblsp, plus 2 tblsp cornstarch). I used a bundt pan so I had to bake 3 extra minutes. 
This cake was a big hit.....very moist....I will definitely make again. 
I'm all about the frosting so I made a lemon glaze taken from another Allrecipes recipe (Lemon-Buttermilk Pound Cake with Aunt Evelyn's Lemon Glaze). Follow those directions exactly and it's fabulous.  And use fresh lemon in the glaze

This was one of the best cakes of any kind that I've ever made. I made a couple of substitutions because I didn't have shortening or cake flour. I used the cornstarch method I've seen also listed here in the reviews as well. Also used margarine instead of the shortening. Didn't have extract, but had lemon juice. Worked just as well. This cake was incredibly moist and soft. I plan on making it again tonight! Lol ?? I'm so happy I found this recipe and so is my family. The whole cake was gone in  one night lol. I made a lemon glaze with 3 tablespoons of butter and about a cup and a half of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla, splash of milk and of course, more lemon juice. It hardened on the cake as it cooled and was absolutely delicious. I give this recipe 5 stars and would give it 10 if I could lol!!

Well I'm not sure what I did wrong, but there was nothing fluffy about my cake. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a total fail. Flavour was ok though. Don't think I will try this one again.....

Good flavor and texture. I increased the lemon extract to 2 tsp. I also didn't have any cake flour so I just decreased the amount by about 3 tbsp and used all purpose.

Absolutely delicious!  I've been looking for a good white cake recipe, and this is the one I'll stick with.  I used almond flavouring instead of lemon and made cupcakes with the batter, topping each cupcake with some almond slices before baking and topped them off with a sprinkle of icing sugar afterwards.  Seems like a very flavour-versatile recipe - I'm going to try lemon, orange, banana and plain vanilla in the future as well.  And the cake was SO fluffy and moist - just like a Duncan Hines mix but better-tasting and not full of chemical garbage.  Wonderful.

Excellent recipe and wonderful direction! I love to bake, but have always failed at cakes. I gave up years ago. But something stirred me to try this one, and it was a raging success! I opted for coconut flavoring and a light glaze to finish, and still it was divine. Thank you so much for this recipe! My kitchen has been my laboratory ever since I made this cake, and I'm loving every minute of it!

Absolutely delicious. I made this for my daughter's birthday. I can't get cake flour here, so I used all purpose. It was beautifully light and moist. Frosted with lemon icing from this site. Many Thanks.

This is a fluffly lemon chiffon cake.  I used AP flour and slightly less sugar. I subbed almond milk for the milk and added the lemon zest and juice of 1 lemon. Delicious!  I used the Lemon Icing Recipe from this website, and they were a great combination.



2 cups cake flour 
1 1/4 cups white sugar 
3 teaspoons baking powder 
3/4 teaspoon salt 
3 egg whites 
1 cup milk 
1 teaspoon lemon extract 
1/2 cup shortening

this cake was very moist and spongy, however the lemon effect was hardly there. It was not as 'lemony' as i would have wanted, so i used a lemon frosting. I've not tried this recipe again but maybe a little more extract would help?

Easy cake to make, but very disappointed in the outcome. Made the cake for my daughter as she wanted a lemon cake for her birthday. Not only did the cake have virtually no lemon flavor, it was very bland altogether. As suggested, I added lemon juice to the recipe, but perhaps I needed to have added much more than I did. Consistency was moist and similar to Angel food cake. Will continue to look for another lemon cake recipe as this did not do it for me.

I made these into cupcakes and they were really yummy. the initial texture was weird, kinda gluey. it could be due to the fact that i used gluten-free flour. but after they cooled, by the next day they had great texture and it was extremely light and fluffy. and since it was my first time using shortening, i was pretty lost. i didnt know if i had to melt it or just cream it in. overall, a good muffin.

More like a pound cake than a fluff cake, but delicious. A drop or two of yellow food color helps brighten the color. This is definitely a keeper!

What a lovely cake this recipe made!  Followed the recipe exactly - beautiful texture, crumb.  Very subtle lemon taste however.  Came out of the oven with a lovely rounded top, though it fell a bit as it cooled.  Lovely with coffee or tea.  Am making it again today but am going to try it with a layer of lemon curd/whipping cream and will drizzle a thin lemon icing on top.

This was very easy and I had everything on hand to make it. I used 4 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice instead of the extract and substituted butter for the shortening. Baked in a 11x13 pan. I made the lemon frosting with 1/2 c sugar, 1/3 c butter, 1 1/2 T. water and 2 T. lemon juice dissolved and brought just to a boil and poured onto the hot cake. Good hot or cold.

My daughter found this recipe for the surprise baby shower she threw me. I decided to make them as mini cupcakes and they turned out great!! I reduced the temp. to 8-10 minutes for 24 cupcakes. Yields about 48 mounded cupcakes. Top with cream cheese frosting and strawberry slices.

What a great, light cake! Perfect for warm weather when you don't want anything dense and heavy. Mild panic when I realized my lemon extract was actually banana extract, but I used 6T lemon juice and it was perfect. Great lemony aftertaste! (I also used butter instead of shortening.) Thank you for the recipe!!

I substituted 2 cups of Pamela's Baking Mix for the flour and baking soda in this recipe to make it gluten free.  It turned out moist (a nice quality when baking gf) and delicious.  Nobody knew it was gluten free.  My only issue was that it sank in the middle but a little extra frosting took care of that!

i doubled the recipe to get 2 10" round pans. I ommited the lemon extract and added 9 teaspoons of lemon juice for the double batch. When it came out however, there was barely any lemon flavour. i really liked the texture of the cake though and that is saying a lot since i hate cake! i would make this again but add way more lemon juice as i dont like lemon extract.

This cake turned out really nice adding some extra lemon juice and zest. It baked up beautifully and had such a yummy lemon smell coming out of the oven. The taste did not disappoint. Only small complaint is I thought it was a little dry, but everyone raved and the flavor was wonderful.
