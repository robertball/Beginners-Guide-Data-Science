This makes a delicious pie, even better when using supreme strawberry topping recipe on top as I did.  My kids simply raved about it and my husband enjoyed as well.  It is just creamy goodness.  I tried a similar recipe years ago that I loved but alas lost.  I thought this was it but I was mistaken.  However I think the difference may be adding twice as much cream cheese.  I will try that next time to see if I can capture the cheesecake taste.

It was definatly easy to make. I was craving a sweet treat and this was fast and sweet. I only rated it a 3 because I would have liked more of a cream cheese taste. I guess next time I will probably just make a baked cheese cake. Overall, if your looking for a quick sweet, fruity fix this hits the spot.

This is the second time I have made this Cheesecake, this week! It is super easy, fast and tastes great. I make my own whip cream and crust and use fresh strawberries. There are a lot of great possibilities here!
