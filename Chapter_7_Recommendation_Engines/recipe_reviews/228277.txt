I love, love, love this recipe!  You might not think it but the sweet of the watermelon pairs so well with the tomatoes.  I used fresh tomatoes right from my garden and it was like a little taste of summer.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

So I made this yesterday, and I'm completely addicted to it!! I had been looking for more fruit/veggie salad recipes for easy quick family snacks to keep on hand and this is my new favorite!! I had to modify the recipe because I cannot eat feta because I'm pregnant so I cubed provolone, I couldn't find white balsamic so I used regular and the grocery store was out of mint so I had to omit it. Also, I just tossed the ingredients together and then stirred but I recommend whisking as suggested so you dont break up the fruit. I also dumped all the watermelon juice into the mix. The dressing is so wonderful and delicious, we added some cold cooked pasta just because the juice/dressing is too amazing to waste. My husband was skeptical, but I knew it would be great since I had seen similar salads while I was stationed in Sicily and this recipe did NOT disappoint! THANKS SO MUCH for posting this recipe- its my new family favorite

I tasted after mixing up this salad, and then added more vinegar, but otherwise, followed the directions.  I was out of white balsamic, so I used Trader Joe's orange muscat champagne vinegar which gave it a nice zing.  For my own taste preference, I will add more mint the next time, but this is a nice and refreshing watermelon-tomato salad.

Awesome salad! I use grape tomatoes.  Used goat cheese because I had it on hand and it was wonderful.  I am definitely making it again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We both like this unusual salad but it must be made with cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes.

This was great with fresh tomatoes.  Perfect accompaniment to grilled pork chops.  I also omitted the mint and used 3/4c blue cheese instead of feta since I didn't have any.

This is a new family fav!  Everyone liked it and asked for seconds or the recipe.  I did make one small change.  I swapped out fresh Thai basil for the mint.

Great combination!  I used green onions, rather than a sweet onion.  Did not have mint on hand, but I imagine that would make it even better!

Made a smaller amount for two, and we ate it all!  The only change was dark balsamic vinegar--not as pretty, but as good.

Great summertime salad when using fresh garden tomato and watermelon. I used both chocolate mint and spear mint and doubled the mint in recipe. Next time I think I'll try some kind of fruit vinaigrette.

I made it for a party and only made it a few minutes before. It was very watery. Everyone enjoyed it, but I wasn't happy with the excess water and look of it. I hope to try it again with better results!!

I brought it to a party, great reviews!  Surprisingly people are still apprehensive of watermelon salad, but word spread.  I'm going to add more mint.  I'd also like to know how to keep it from getting too watery in the bowl!

Just made it again and I could eat the whole bowl!  I added extra mint and extra white balsamic vinegar to kick up the flavor just a bit more.  My watermelon wasn't the sweetest I've ever bought but it doesn't really matter in this recipe

Delicious!  Perfect light salad for summer. I added a bit more onion and mint than the recipe called for extra flavor, but other than that stick to the plan and this came out great.

This is so yummy and refreshing. As suggested by another, I used the Trader Joe's champagne vinegar.  Great for summer potlucks, as it does not have to be refrigerated. I also tried it with goat cheese instead of feta and that was delicious as well.

Wow!! So glad I tried this! All of the flavors go very nicely.  Fresh and light salad for snacking or to make for get togethers!
