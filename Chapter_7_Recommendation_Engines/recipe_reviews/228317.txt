I used "soured" milk and Jif super-chunk peanut butter in this recipe. Though the batter looked okay in the bowl, it was extremely thick and hard to not only get it onto the griddle without really messing with it AND the pancakes didn't want to cook once they were on the griddle. I would try this again but I would use a different pancake batter as the base--this one really didn't work out for me at all.

These were great!  My family of 7 completely enjoyed them.  I ran out of bananas and didn't have any chocolate chips, so I improvised a little and used chunky peanut butter and the new JIF chocolatey butter.  It worked great!  I can't wait to make them again, but with bananas next time.

These were okay, we all found them way too sweet. Also, the batter is very thick and the first batch I had to toss because the inside never cooked up. I thinned the batter with more milk and the rest cooked up fine. If I make these again, I will leave out the brown sugar. Also, the peanut butter is very strong even though there's only 1/4 cup. I love PB, but I think I would cut back just a little. If this was intended as a dessert pancake, with a little vanilla ice cream I'd give it 5 stars for sure!

These were excellent, for a special treat! I did add a little extra milk to get the batter more pourable, maybe another 1/3 cup or so, but these pancakes tasted great.  I used smooth peanut butter and warmed it a bit to soften it so it would mix better.

Some of the previous reviews said this recipe was too thick.  We actually had the opposite problem with it being runny.  I did add another banana and I mashed them and mixed them with the liquids.  Since it was runny I added an extra 2 TBSP of flour.  They turned out yummy!

These have become a staple in our house, one of the only breakfasts we all love! The only thing I do different is mash the bananas rather than dicing them.

I tried it without the peanut butter as my son is deathly allergic and it turned out perfectly. They ate them all and I had to whip up another batch. Thanks again for sharing such a great recipe.

Everyone in my family loves this recipe. It's always a great hit, and I feel like after making it a few times it's really easy to do. I like to add a little extra brown sugar and a few extra chocolate chips, but other than that this recipe is gold!  Truth be told, the banana being mushy in the pancake took a little getting used to for me (but I'm not usually a big banana fan) , but I really love it. I think it's delicious.

These are really good. I didn't make any changes. It was to sweet for us. Next time I think it will help if I leave the brown sugar out. I will try these again.

These were pretty great, and sweet enough that they didn't need syrup. I found that if you melt the peanut butter in the microwave for like 20 seconds, the batter is much easier to work with.

These Elvis pancakes were terrible. I am guessing too much soda. They didn't taste like banana or peanut butter. They were extremely runny.

great recipe. I followed it pretty spot on except I used crunchy peanut butter and didn't have choc. chips so they were more peanut butter pancakes. I don't think that made any difference to be honest. the peanut butter really came through which was great and perfect with the bananas. highly recommend!

These were delicious! My husband and I gobbled up these pancakes. I did mashed the banana instead of chopping it and double the chocolate chips. Thank you for this excellent recipe!!! Will make again and again.

My family love these. I make them as directed and I also make a version substituting 1/4 cup of flour with cacao powder  which the kids love even more. We eat them plain, no butter or syrup on top. I make double batches and freeze them so that we don't have to buy frozen pancakes for school mornings.

I left out the bananas, and used about half milk, half buttermilk, because I ran out of milk, but these were fantastic! Using creamy peanut butter was what I decided to do this time around; perhaps I will try with crunchy next time!! Definitely a keeper recipe!! :) Thank you for sharing it!

These pancakes were soooooo good I made these for my mom and I and even she liked them and shes not a pancake person. They had just the right amount of sweetness. However i did add another 1/2 cup of flour and i used 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of a quarter but they still could've used a bit more in my opinion otherwise really good and really fluffy too!

This turned out a lot better than I thought it would, but it is something I would definitely make again. 

I only changed it slightly in that I used two bananas mashed, and I used a 1.25 cups of milks to make up for the extra liquid from the mashed bananas.  Even then, I was afraid that the batter was going to be too runny, but it was hard to tell with the chocolate chips so I made a test pancake and they turned out fine. These aren't going to be the fluffiest of pancakes (though I did use some pretty old baking powder, so that might've been the problem) but they weren't too thin. Almost old fashion style. 

They were flavorful, but I feel like there still wasn't enough banana. 

The hardest part was whisking the peanut butter into the milk, and I was worried that .25 cups of it was still going to over power the whole dish, but it was basically the perfect amount. 

In the future I would probably up it to three bananas. Maybe a smidgen less of milk/more flour, and a few more chocolate chips. But that's just my preference in flavor. I had guests over for breakfast, and they thought they were so good and asked for the recipe! Definitely something to try!!!

I wanted to try a different pancake recipe and found it. These are tasty!! I would cut down on the amount of chocolate chips just so they are not super sweet especially if you put maple syrup on them, but other than that I would definitely make them again.

My husband said these were the best pancakes he has ever had:)  Like a previous reviewer, I used a blender to mix everything up, and I omitted the chocolate chips.

Not bad, although a bit too sweet for my tastes.  However, I shouldn't have topped with syrup. More bananas for topping would've worked best for me. I didn't find the batter too thick or too runny. Not sure if this made the difference, but I used soy milk and creamy peanut butter, which is all we had. I got seven pancakes out of this and topped with butter, chocolate chips, bananas, and syrup.

I didn't have any bananas so I skipped those, love the peanut butter flavor with the chocolate chips!! My husband loves any kind of food you can put syrup on so he approves as well.

Travel pancakes!  No syrup needed.  I used dark chocolate chips, probably about double what the recipe calls for.  Awesome.

These were just ok. I had to add extra flour and baking powder to get them to rise at all and had to turn the heat way down because they were burning and the center was still mushy.
