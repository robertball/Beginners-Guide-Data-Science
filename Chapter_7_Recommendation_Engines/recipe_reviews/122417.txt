The flavor was excellent.  I didn't have exactly 1/4 c. of regular soy sauce so I used regular and Lite and added a little more water to make a 1/4. I also used "already prepared" garlic in a jar. I didn't have the time to marinate for as long as the recipe said so I marinated approx. 1 hour and didn't throw out the remaining marination but cooked the steak on the stove in it.  I will try this with other kinds of meat.  My family really enjoyed this.  Thanks.

I must say, this did taste pretty good! If the soy sauce is too strong for your liking, try using a can of soda such as Dr. Pepper or root beer. It still adds a lot of flavor and tenderness without the bitterness of soy sauce. Also, be sure to poke the steak all over with a fork before adding to the bag of marinade to ensure that the steak will soak in all of the flavors.

This was the best recipe for flank steak I've found yet!  I added a little red pepper and a couple drops of sesame seed oil and marinated it for about 6 hours.  Then I pan fried it in some of the marinade.  It was so tender and delicious!  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and brocolli and my boyfriend was singing my praises. Thanks!!

This recipe was great!  We marinated the steak overnight and it was extremely tender and flavorful once cooked. We enjoyed this recipe so much that I will be serving this dish when it is our turn to host dinner club again!

I thought that the soy sauce was too overpowering. I marinated for only 1 1/2 hours and then pan fried it without adding the marinade and still all I could taste was salty soy sauce. Perhaps on the grill it would be different. If I make this again I will use light soy sauce and will use half the soy and replace the lost liquid with a mixture of water and balsamic vinegar, and will up the olive oil some. Definately not a good marinade for pan frying the way it is now.

This recipe was great!  SO tender.  I usually do not like eating any kind of steak, but this was like "melt in your mouth" flank steak

Divine! I mixed this up after breakfast and let the steak marinate all day. By the time I grilled it at 8pm, the flavors had really sunk in. My fiance tried to steal mine off my plate after he scarfed his!

This marinade has wonderful flavor.  I used flat iron steak and marinated it overnight to get the maximum flavor.

Fantastic, just as it was.  I didn't marinate the whole 8 hours, maybe 5 or 6 and it was still perfect!

I made this for dinner tonight and my kids loved it. I only had 2 hours to marinate and it still tasted great.  Cooked it under the broiler.  Bet it would be event better if I had marinated the full time.  Will make this again soon.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  It was snowing out so access to the grill was iffy, so i broiled it for 11 minutes on each side and it was a perfect medium rare.

We liked this but something was missing.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and thought it still a bit salty after marinating for about 5 hrs.  We also like our chinese with some heat, so I added a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes.  I prepared extra marinate for with the stir fry vegetables (minus the sugar and only half the oil) and it worked well with most of the vegetables, but the water chestnuts were a bit on the salty side.  This is a good base recipe to modify for your family's tastes.  Next time I'll cut the soy sauce a bit, add more ginger, a bit more red pepper flakes and remove the oil.

I am not one to leave reviews. I have to say however that this was awesome. I marinated over night cooked when I got home in a grill pan inside. There was nothing left and my picky husband asked to put this on the menu. The steak was tender. All I can say is yummmmm.

i made this last nite, as i was preparing this i was thinking of how tough this steak was going to be.  I miranated mine for about 5 hours and followed the recipe exact, except i doubled the recipe.  I had almost a 3lb. steak.  I have yet to cook a tender flandk steak...until tonite.  this was one of the best steaks i have ever put in my mouth.  I can't wait to do this again.

Of course, I was in a rush and did not think ahead to marinate for all the hours everyone did with this recipe.  I marinated it for 45 minutes and it was phenomenal!  After searing it on top of the stove, I diagonally cut it and placed it under my broiler.  Served it with beef gravy I made, baked potatoes, and home canned green beans.  Absolutely a memorable meal.  This was the best flank steak I have eaten in a long, long time.

This was not really what I was anticipating.  It was decent, but the dominate flavor was the soy sauce.  I couldn't really detect the ginger OR the garlic (even though I added quite a bit more than called for).  It wasn't as tender as I had hoped, either.  I grilled it and it was cooked to a perfect pink throughout.  This just wasn't a favorite here.  Thanks for posting so we could try it, though!!!

It was wonderfully tender!  I marinated it for 8 hours and grilled it.  Hubby absolutely loved it.  Will definitely make again.

This was not too good.  It mostly tasted like soy sauce.  I could not detect any ginger flavor and barely any garlic flavor.  Better than plain old meat but won't make again.

Easy, tastes great.  I used a touch of balsamic vinegar with the soy sauce and did not have any brown sugar so used raw sugar.  My husband loved this right off the grill.  Will use it again!

Very good. I let the meat marinade overnight and it was perfect.  Wouldn't change anything. Thanks!

So delicious!  It was my first attempt using the grill, and the meat was tender and flavorful.  Leftovers were great the next day in a green salad.
