Making this the first time, the batter was really too liquidy. I had to start over. The second time, I cut out two eggs and threw the remaining egg in my blender with the milk, vegetable oil and the two overripe bananas and pureed them until they were uniform. I poured the wet ingredients into a mixing bowl, then folded in the dry ingredients (cutting back the baking powder to two teaspoons instead of two tablespoons) and the chopped banana. Second time around, I had a much better result. The pancakes were good but noone really liked the banana chunks. I would make these again with my changes and omit the chopped banana.

I followed the recipe exactly and these never solidified into pancakes. Then I tried sauteeing them and putting syrup on them, but they tasted of baking powder. I think perhaps there was way too much baking powder in the recipe. Was very disappointed.

I really likes these pancakes, but I tweaked them a bit. I used two tablespoons of baking powder and used melted margarine instead of oil. I also swirled in a cinnamon streusel mixture. So good though, very fluffy!

Way too much baking powder in this recipe. Needs to be cut down to 1-2 TBSP. 3 TBSP for 1 cup of flour is overpowering.

Great recipe. Pancakes came out really fluffy. I added some brown sugar to add a little more sweetness along with about a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 of nutmeg.

They seemed too fluffy and without enough banana in them! I look forward to tweaking the recipe and adding a little more density, while taking out a bit of the fluff!

Just made and had them. I guess the amount of baking powder mentioned is by mistake so I used teaspoons instead of tablespoons. I pureed the banana separately in a blender. Then user a electric blender to blend the 3 eggs, mixed all ingredients together. The texture was amazing. The only issues is that it tasted a little bitter. I guess coz of the baking powder. Next time only 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder goes in. My toddler didn't like it though.

I made it several times. It is so delicious. Everybody at home loves it. We also get creative with the toppigs. Tastes great with white cheese, processed spread cheese, peanut butter & honey/jam.

This recipe was excellent!    The pancakes were very fluffy and tasted wonderful.  Beating the eggs for 2 minutes was key.

These pancakes were very delicious and were enjoyed by all of my children. Instead of (yuck) vegetable oil, I used clarified butter (ghee) instead. I didnâ€™t use a griddle and cut down the cooking time dramatically though I did have to pay more attention in order to keep from burning. I will be preparing these again!

I tried these because I had ripe bananas I wanted to use. If you make them exactly as the recipe says (which I always dio the first time) these are terrible. I'm very sorry to say. WAY too much baking powder, not enough flavour. I'm not sure if there is enough tweaking to fix these. If you must, use way less baking soda, add brown sugar (or any sugar) and 1-2 more bananas wouldn't hurt.

These pancakes were fantastic!  So fluffy! The only changes I made were 2 Tbsp of oil instead of 3 and 1 large ripe banana instead of 2 (hubby not a huge banana fan). This recipe was so easy and made 9 good size pancakes. We both really enjoyed them!  Thank you.

Would have been perfect but it tasted like baking powder. 2 TBS is too much.

Quick, easy, and delicious. The only thing I do differently is to mix the batter the night before and let it marinade in the fridge overnight for a more infused banana flavor throughout the pancake.

ON POINT for Mother's Day breakfast. FYI 6 serving=14-16 pancakes when 1/4 cup portions per the instructions is used.  Make sure to use really ripe and soft bananas so when mashed and whipped with fork, it has soupy oatmeal consistency, with some chunks but not any big pieces that would mess up the batter and make pancakes doughy.  I also added a little vanilla and nutmeg.  I used a whisk on the batter BEFORE adding the bananas to smooth it out and kept whisking as I added bananas until everything was completely mixed together.  I don't have a griddle so I used a non-stick skillet brushed with veggie oil.  Make sure you keep the pancakes warm until you are done/ready to serve.  I placed mine in the oven on an oven safe platter and covered with aluminum foil so they wouldn't dry out and so that they could bake a little because the first one I tried looked and tasted a little doughy, but leaving them in the oven on the "warm" setting (170 deg. w/my oven) bakes  them a little and gets rid of the doughy taste and look. When I tried the first one off the skillet it didn't have the sweetness I was expecting and I almost added some brown sugar to the rest of the batter but decided not to and was glad I didn't because once I added the warm maple syrup I got the right amount of sweetness I was looking for.  My neighbor has a bird appetite and devoured the 3 I gave her. I would have gotten her more if she was at home instead of a nursing home and I had time to go back before church.

Made these, my husband loved them!  And so did I.  After reading the reviews, used 2 Tbsp baking powder instead of three.  Also added about a quarter cup chopped walnuts and I Tbsp ground flaxseed.

Substituted the all-purpose flour for a gluten-free blend, & the milk for almond milk, & added a scoop of protein powder. The result? Gluten-free Dairy-free Protein-packed Yummy banana pancakes.

I added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. The cooking instructions were off. I had to play with the temperature quite a bit and had some waste. Try a griddle with oil at 375 and you should have good results. They tasted good!

I really enjoyed this recipe but I did a little tweaking to it. I added about 2 tsp of vanilla and put all three bananas in the mix to make it taste more like bananas.

My husband loved these.. I mashed the two bananas with a fork, added a few chopped strawberries that I had in the fridge and sprinkled cinnamon and cardamom in the batter... scrumptious!
