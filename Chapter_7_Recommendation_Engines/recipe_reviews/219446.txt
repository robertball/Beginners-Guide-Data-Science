This was really great! My family only likes cauliflower raw but I did have a green and yellow bean with carrot mix on hand. This dish was so flavorful! The lemons flavored the vegetables too and it was such a great meal! My kids loved it also! Will DEFINATELY make again but will add more old bay seasoning next time!

It was delicious and easy to make!  I cooked it for 25 minutes and substituted the red peppers for carrots instead.  Still came out perfect. :-)

My daughter and husband gobbled this up.  (My daughter is a typical 10 year-old who finds fish suspicious and rejects my offerings but she LOVED this.)

I did not have the Old Bay so I looked up a substitute and this is what I found: 

2 ½ Tbs. paprika
2 Tbs. salt
2 Tbs. garlic powder
1 Tbs. black pepper
1 Tbs. onion powder
1 Tbs. cayenne pepper
1 Tbs. dried leaf oregano
1 Tbs. dried Thyme

Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container. Makes about 2/3 cup

Served with brown rice (The three minute kind from Trader Joe's)  

Excellent!

WOW! I was pleasantly surprised at this recipe. Talapia is generally pretty bland, but this was tasty. I had to alter it a bit, since I didn't have the recommended seasoning, and I used fresh cauliflower and carrots, but I think the butter and the lemon was the key. My husband doesn't like fish and he didn't like this either so it probably won't convert a non-fish lover, but I thought it was excellent.

My family LOVES this. It tastes great, it's healthy, and it's EASY. The first time I made it I included the lemon, but I haven't since then. It wasn't bad, we just aren't lemon ppl. I change up the veggies with whatever is fresh at my local produce market.

Made this recipe for lunch today but had to make a few adjustments due to lack of ingredients and it was amazing!  Didn't have butter so I used "Can't Believe its not butter", didn't have lemon so used lemon juice, and the only frozen vegetables I had were frozen fingerling potatoes and peppers and onions from Schwann's.  Also didn't have Old Bay so I used Cajun Blackened Seasoning..... It was delicious.

I couldn't find just the frozen cauliflower, broccoli, and red pepper, but I could find all those veggies plus corn. It made a beautiful dish, and it was delicious as well. This is such an easy, healthy one-dish meal.

So easy to prepare.  I only kept the fish in for 25 minutes at 350, and they came out perfect.  Nice easy meal for the family, my 9 year old son ate it up in no time.  I served baby new potatoes and a salad.

Made this as my alternative to tilapia scampi (which I also found on here). Definitely a healthier way to make tilapia, but not super flavorful. I like a lot of lemon, so I'll amp that up next time. Easy and clean recipe for good ol tilapia.

I needed something different for tilapia. This recipe was great.  My family loved the tilapia with the combination of lemon, butter, seasonings, and garlic. The vegetables were a bit soggy.  Next time, I will steam the vegetables.

This was a great recipe! It was easy to prepare. The flavors were very simple, but enjoyable. I didn't have any lemons on hand, so I used an orange. The citrus and sweet tasted very good! I also used broccoli and carrots-- I don't like cauliflower or red pepper. Next time I would add some more seasoning, though. It was a little bland. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome easy recipe.  My girlfriend has never liked fish until now.  Yes it can be a bit bland but isn't Talapia supposed to be?  I just added a little extra Old Bay Seasoning and it was perfect.  I didn't think the lemon would make much difference at first...boy was I wrong!  It seasoned all of the veggies perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I’ve made this a few times for a quick dinner. The first few times I followed the recipe to the tee. I made it tonight and used frozen peas and carrots to change it up, especially since my son loves peas.

The only change made was using fresh vegetables (the same ones in the recipe) but roasted them in a separate dish while the fish cooked inside the tinfoil covered dish.  I used the same seasonings on the vegetables, which turned out very subtle.  Served it to company (very brave, I know!) and everyone loved it.

Wow....just made this. It's such a great recipe and I can't stress enough how easy it was to make. I used frozen stir fry veggies and followed the recipe as is. I made more since I'm starting to meal prep. I served it over Quinoa and Brown Rice and a side of Italian seasoned roasted potatoes. It reminds me of a dish I had at a restaurant. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Thanks for posting!

I used fresh broccoli and bell peppers because that's what I had. In my opinion it still came out great. My in-laws are healthy eaters and they gave nothing but raves so it was definitely a win in my book!

Delicious recipe but didn't need to cook so long, probably 20 minutes at most.

very tasty ! if your fish comes out bland, its because you didn't season it enough. Lemon gives a fish a taste that explodes in your mouth. I also added onions, and peppers, with the chopped up garlic

Omg, this was an excellent recipe!  I don't really enjoy baked fish made from home because I honestly prefer fried fish because it's more filling and tastier in my opinion, but I'm trying to get back on the routine of eating healthy again so I came across this recipe and noticed the ratings (I take ratings literally so they were good and it intrigued me to try it).  Well I followed the instructions almost completely, but I made a couple changes!  I unthawed 6 frozen tilapia filets and  placed them on paper towels and pressed all the excess water out, sprayed the sheet pan with cooking spray and seasoned the pan with old bay rub, placed the fish on the pan and seasoned the top of the fish with more old bay by actually rubbing it in, then heated two tablespoons of unsalted butter with 1 teaspoon of already prepared minced garlic, a little garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and a little all-purpose seasoning and then brushed it over the fish, then I placed thinly sliced lemon circles each filet, then placed frozen California style frozen vegetables around the fish and salted and peppered the fish and vegetables then covered with aluminum foil and baked as directed and I'll tell you, this absolutely came out amazing, my 11 month old son gobbled it up as well as I did and later on my bf ate it and loved it...this is my go to baked fish recipe from now on...thank you!

Really great flaky, moist fish. I added garlic salt. Other than that followed recipe and loved it. Use fish that is still frozen, just add 15min to baking time.

So I used this recipe as a base and kind of tweaked it but it still turned out tasty and super easy. I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to cut pieces of cauliflower, broccoli and red pepper. I added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth to help cook the fresh vegetables. I also put the three tilapia filets on top of the vegetables and drizzled olive oil along with the melted butter. Cook time took about 40 minutes but it was quite tasty!

Tasted great, but what's even better is how easy it was! I loved that it only required one dish and could just be put in the oven. No real prep (other than defrosting fish) required! I'm not a huge tilapia fan, so I may experiment with other types of fish. Thinking mahi-mahi would be the jackpot.

What a great recipe! Instead of using butter I used 1 tablespoon if olive oil, generously sprinkled Bays seasoning, and added dry dill. I had only fresh broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots so I added a little water. Baked 30 minutes ....the veggies took on the flavor of the seasonings..yummy
...Perfect!

I've been making this recipe for a couple years and it's great. I make it without the vegetables most of the time (we usually just have rice on the side) and everyone always loves it. Really gives the fish lots of flavor and it's so easy!

Easy and great! I sub the spice with paprika, thyme, shallot and lime (what I had). It turned out great! Just add the veggies of your choices. I put frozen butternut squash, pea, corn, green beans and there's plenty of juice which I will use a deep baking  dish next time. Thank you!
