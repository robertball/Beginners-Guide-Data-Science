I used tofu instead of shrimp. Kids liked it too. The parantha cooking direction are not clear even to me though I make paranthas every day:-) so I just folded the filling quessidilla style in half and ate it like that.

I would probably give this recipe 4 stars as written, because I think the 1/2 cup of oil was too much, but by reducing the oil to 1/4 cup or maybe even 1/8 cup (and adjusting if a bit more is needed) it's easily a 5 star recipe if not more. In 1/2 cup of oil, my filling was swimming in the oil. I ended up pouring out most of the oil after my shrimp had cooked but before I added the eggs.  Also, because we had our little ones eating with us, I omitted the chile in step 2 and after I cooked the kids parathas, I added some cayenne pepper in the filling for hubby and I.  It was really, really good.  Thanks!!
