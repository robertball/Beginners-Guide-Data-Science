I was a bit worried this cake would be sweet, but its not.  Its so easy to  make, and has a great flavor for black forest cake.  It makes a lot and I bet the left overs will taste even better.  I used light canned cherries, used whipping cream with only 3/4 cup icing sugar, but if you like it sweeter, use what they recommend.

This was honestly one of the best deserts I've ever made.  I used  a chocolate fudge cake mix.  I also used a little more hot fudge because I had a partial jar left in the fridge.  I didn't make homemade whip cream but used cool whip lite, then sprinkled shaved chocolate bar and chopped nuts on top.  It turned out Killer!!!
