Love this recipe with a few minor tweaks:  1 can of diced tgomatoes, one yellow and one red bell pepper which makes it sweeter, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. ground rosemary, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1 small yellow onion, chopped. Sweat the onion with the spices BEFORE adding peppers, tomatoes and sausage.  Let simmer for 15 minutes and then add the beef broth.  Let simmer for another 15 minutes, toss with pasta, and enjoy.  It is FABULOUSLY flavorful this way, especially with fresh grated parmesan on top!

WOW!  The first time I tried this recipe I thought it was way too simple to be a 5-star recipe, but boy, was I wrong!  DELICIOUS and SO QUICK!  It is a welcomed change from pastas with tomatoes and/or red sauce.  UPDATE 1/03/09 -- I've made this recipe SO many times now; it's a favorite with hubby and all three kids.  They actually get excited when I tell them we're having this for dinner. Here's how I've come to modify this recipe:  I use half hot Italian and half sweet Italian sausage with casings removed (about 4 links each); I fry this in a little olive oil until browned, then add sliced onion and both red and green peppers for color; I continue cooking until sausage is done and veggies are tender; then I add one full can of College Inn beef broth plus 1-2 T beef base, plus 2/3 lb. cooked pasta (we like Cavatelli and bow ties), and also add a sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes, about 1 tsp. black pepper and salt to taste.   TIP:  For lots of flavor, DON'T drain the sausage.  Sure, it's not good for your hips or heart, but boy does it kick this up!  After making this dozens of times, I really think this is key to great flavor. Afterall, if you're serving sausage for dinner, you're really not expecting a healthy meal, right? LOL

I was intrigued by the simplicity of this recipe and also by the rich beef flavor from the sauce.  My husband is not too fond of tomatoes or tomato sauces, so this was an ideal alternative.  It was quick and delicious.

I modified the recipe by using only a half a pound of sweet italian sausage, freeing the meat from its casing and cooking it loose.  I also added a half a pound of sliced mushrooms to the bellpeppers, which really added a mellow taste and added flavor to the beefiness of the broth.  I added a little bit more beef broth than the recipe called for, and really let it soak into the pasta.  At the end I added a small dollop of butter to smooth out the sauce, although this of course adds a little fat to an otherwise fairly lean recipe. Just a light dusting of Hungarian paprika and Lawry's seasoning salt also added a bit of flavor, but I would venture this would be unnecessary if the beef broth used was salty to begin with.

I think this recipe could even be a great noodle dish using just vegetables, broth, and farfalle.
The sauce was great!

Sausage and peppers, or sausage and peppers with pasta? – nothing new to me.  Adding beef broth to the mix?  Never have.  I don’t know if that’s what was responsible or not, or if I just plain love pasta, sausage and peppers, but this – was – excellent.  Used rigatoni rather than farfalle and, unlike other reviewers, did NOT use the grease rendered by the sausage. Rather, I removed the cooked sausage from the pan, cleaned it out, then cooked green and red peppers, onions, garlic and mushrooms in olive oil before returning the cooked sausage to the pan, adding the beef broth, then reducing somewhat. Tossed it all together with a good dab of butter.  A  sprinkling of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano  was the finishing touch.

My family loved this recipe. I used a package of Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage which is slightly over 1 pound. I crumbled it up and added minced garlic to taste. I boiled a 12 oz. box of bowtie pasta and used 1 can of Campbell's Beef Broth in the sausage mixture. I omitted salt because the beef broth had enough salt in it. I didn't have peppers so I used 1 cup of canned peas. I will make this again and prepare it as written and I also want to try this with a jar of roasted red peppers or a bag of frozen stirfry peppers and onions (cook them separate from the sausage to carmelize, then add to the sausage.) This recipe has many possibitlites. Because I used 12 oz. of pasta, it was necessary to use the entire can of beef broth and each bowtie was covered with the sauce and it was not runny. I served this with fresh grated parm cheese on top, french bread and a salad.

Great and easy recipe.  I double the amount of beef broth, and add fresh sliced mushrooms.  Instead of 2 green bell peppers, I use 1 red, 1 orange, and 1 yellow bell pepper.  This makes the dish more colorful and less bitter - the green bell peppers taste bitter to me.

I made this for a class project almost 2 years ago and liked it so much I continue to make it. I buy the frozen peppers from Trader Joe's (they are red, yellow and green already sliced so this saves lots of time)It makes great left overs as well! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this recipe so long, I may have already reviewed it.  However, I don't think that I have and that's a shame because this recipe is a keeper for my family, and has been for years!  I use 2 lbs of Italian sausage (I prefer the type that is ground and found in a roll, I think it's Bob Evans brand, fresh peppers and instead of the beef broth I make up a package of Au Juice for the gravy. (Sometimes, Au Juice can be found in can with the soups, but I cannot find it anymore...it was so much better than the envelope mix that I have to purchase now).  This substitution of Au Juice makes a world of difference in the overall flavor of this dish!  With just four ingredients, (pasta, sausage, peppers, au juice) this dish is delicious!  If you want to get "fancy", throw in some mushrooms or onions, or whatever to make it your own....but it's GREAT with just those four ingredients.  My family requests this frequently, and I feed a hungry crowd of teenaged boys. One of those quick, easy, and go-to meals.  Serve with crusty bread and salad.  Thanks to KSUDA for the recipe!

Good but with some additions.  Veggies, veggies, veggies....minced onion and garlic sauteed with the sausage.  Added chopped red roasted pepper and sun dried tomatoes.  Instead of cutting up fresh peppers I added a half bag of frozen peppers and onion.  Topped with asiago and parmesan cheese.

We are big Sweet Italian Sausage people,as unhealthy as it is,we still love it!This recipe is a nice change from a red sauce and my hubby really enjoys this.I use red,green and yellow peppers,they add such nice color and also chopped onion.I have to feed this to 5 big pasta fans so I use 2 whole packs of sausage and about 1 1/2 cups of beef broth.We like it with bow tie pasta and a green salad.I cook my sausage in a different pan than my veggies then I add them together at the end.The veggies maintain their shape and texture this way in my opinion and it's a little less greasy.

This is a terrific version of Salciccia Napolitano but can be ramped up with a couple of additions.  Add 1 TBS minced garlic to the sausage while cooking, add one red bell pepper sliced into strips (or use a jar of blackened red bell peppers from a jar, just be sure to slice them into strips), and add a splash of Light Olive Oil to the finished product before serving.  Optionally, add a pinch of dried red pepper flakes to give it some zing.  Be sure to serve this with warm bread to sop up the sauce!  Regular staple on our menu and everyone LOVES it!

The best! I followed many suggestions and sauteed 2 large cloves minced garlic, Italian seasoning, 1/2 large onion sliced, a yellow, red, and green pepper, and a package of sliced fresh mushrooms in olive oil until soft. I removed them from skillet and set aside. Then added a package of Italian sausage (about 19 oz) with casings removed and chopped into small chunks, and fried until done. I put everything back together and added a 14 oz can diced tomatoes, and 3.4 cup beef broth and simmered. I later tossed the mixture with about 8 oz rotini pasta and served with freshly grated parmesan. My family loves this recipe!!

Good, hearty, quick meal!  I could have sworn there was a box of farfelle pasta in the pantry, but there wasn't, so I opted for penne.  It turned out great, just not as pretty as bow ties.  :)  I used hot italian sausage (we like spicy!) and both red & green bell peppers for more color.  I tossed in a couple cloves of sliced garlic & chopped onion to it and we really enjoyed this.  Since I used the entire 14oz box of pasta, I used a full can of beef broth (it may seem too soupy at first, but if you cook the pasta till just al dente & add it to the skillet with the rest of the goodies while they're still hot, it'll soak up a good portion of the broth).  Next time, I'll use farfelle for a more appropriate picture.  :)  Thank you for the recipe!

I would rate this higher and the leftovers were delicious.  If prepared the way this recipe is written I can see that it could be bland but I followed what the reviewers suggested and sauteed a medium onion and 2 tbls. of italian herbs in some oil, added the peppers and hot italian sausage (removed from casing). Cooked till sausage was almost done, added the cooked pasta,whole can of beef stock and canned mushrooms.  Let it all simmer for about 15 minutes covered. Passed around the Parmasean cheese which was delicious on it.  This is a real keeper.  Quick and easy to make,low in calories and inexpensive.

I LOVE this recipe! The flavor of the sauce is delicious. Spicy sausage with the sweet peppers is a nice flavor contrast. Alternatively, we use one green one red bell, yellow onion, rotini noodles, and spicy red sauce. Another of Hubby's faves.

This was very good!!  I used both spicy and sweet Italian sausages, 1 green pepper & 1 red pepper, plus onion & garlic.  After cutting up the peppers, onion & garlic, I sprinkled them with Italian herb, oregano and garlic pepper.  I set them aside and browned the sausages in a little olive oil (took the advise of another reviewer and did not drain after cooking the sausage).  Then, I added the pepper mixture and cooked it for about 7 minutes before adding a full can of beef broth.  After that was all hot & blended, I added the penne that I already cooked, and it turned out delicious.  Served it with tossed salad and bakery fresh bread.  This is going straight into the monthly rotation for sure!!

I'm a newer cook so at this point I always look for easy recipes to start with and grow my ability and this one was perfect. I made a few changes using what others suggested. I used 1 red, green and 1/2 yellow pepper, 1/2 sweet one and 3 cloves of garlic that I sauteed in a little butter separately from the meat. I also seasoned the vegetables with onion and garlic powder and salt before adding to the meat which I seasoned with the same spices. I used 2pds of ground italian sausage and a little over a cup of the broth. Next time I'll reduce how much broth I used to a cup. To thicken the broth up I used some flour and it was perfect. Since I doubled the meat and veggies. I used 1pd of pasta. My boyfriend, who is an amazing cook, fell in love with this @ first bite and asked me to teach him how to make it. This is another one for my collection!

I am only giving this 4 stars, because as is -- I think it would be pretty blah.  I cooked the bowtie pasta in the beef broth, and that made it tasty.  I also added broccoli and tomatoes and sprinkled it with crushed red pepper.  The kids loved it, and so did we!  Pretty quick and easy!

Very good!! I wasn't sure of the beef broth but it turned out being really good. I added about a half cup more of the broth and 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper, instead of the 2 green. My children liked it too.

Great with a few modifications for our tastes.  I used a green pepper, yellow pepper and red pepper.  I also use ground hot Italian sausage.  The sauce is bit runny, so add a little cornstarch in water to thicken it slightly to get it to "stick" a bit better when I toss the pasta with the peppers and sausage.

Simple, tasty and easy to put together.  I used red peppers, because I prefer them.  Even my picky kiddos liked it.  Next time I might add some onions.  Thanks for one that's a keeper!

Sometimes to stretch the recipe so DH will have some to take to work the next day, I will add a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes to give it a little kick.  After it's heated through, I add about 2 tablespoons evaporated milk which cuts the bite of the tomatoes but doesn't lessen the spiciness!  Leftovers are even better. It's a favorite meal along with a loaf of Amish White Bread (another AR Recipe fav)   Deeeelish.

This is one the favorites in my house.  I make it using Hot Turkey Italian Sausage, Red and Green peppers, sliced mushrooms, one can of beef broth, one box of bow tie pasta, and add one jar of marinara sauce.  I like the adding marinara sauce, it gives the dish extra flavor.  I also top with Parmesan cheese on some occasions.  This is a very easy, fast dish, always comes out delicious!

It's surprisingly tasty for being so simple and I can see how it would also be a great base recipe for experimenting with adding additional ingredients.

My husband said that it had too many peppers in it but was otherwise good.

Things I noticed? The sausage took a little longer than 8-10 minutes to cook. So, I would start cooking the pasta slightly after I started the sausage and pepper combination.

I also noticed that I did not need to drain the sausage and pepper mix at all. I don't know what kind of sausage the originator of the recipe was using, but apparently mine was very lean. Plus, I felt like the very tiny amount of pan drippings would just add to the flavor. They did.

You'll also notice that the recipe does not indicate how long to boil the broth for once you've added it. I probably let mine boil for about 1-2 minutes. Just enough to make sure that it was hot and it coated all the meat and peppers. The longer you let it boil the less runny your sauce will be....mostly because you'll have less sauce. The less you let it boil the more broth you'll have to soak into the noodles.

In conclusion, this was tasty, fast and easy. And a nice change of pace from pasta with standard red sauce.

Boy, I nearly screwed this up big time but I managed to salvage it & it turned out being five star. I used 1 & 1/2 lbs of mild italian sausage (sliced 1" on a slight diagonal), one red pepper & one yellow (wish I had used one more) & while I was sauteeing those, I sprinkled some salt & pepper on it. Then I decided I wanted to use some creole seasoning...not realizing the creole seasoning was predominantly salt. At this point, it was really salty so when I drained it, I also rinsed it which was successful in removing the excess salt. I used about a cup & a half of low sodium broth, allowing it to reduce slightly & then I added a little cornstarch mixed in cold water. (about a tsp. of cornstarch in a tbp. or so of water) I added the bowties to the sausage & then copied WordChaser & added just a tbp. of butter. I topped it all w/ a sprinkling of romano cheese & fresh chopped basil. This dish had wonderful flavor! In fact, it was soo good that hubby asked me not to eat the leftovers for lunch but to save them for us to have for dinner again tonight.

We enjoyed this recipe but, the on line picture was not with bow tie pasta as the header stated.  Also, the picture showed red and green peppers, not just green peppers as the ingredient list stated.  Have seen many of these types errors lately on your site.   Would add mushrooms to the recipe.

This was really easy and tasted great. I used gluten free sweet Italian sausage with a bell pepper & onion mix (a bought cut up & ready mix for fajitas). I actually cooked the onions with the sausage first, then added the bell peppers. I added in some salt & pepper, garlic, red pepper flakes and fresh basil. Tossed with gluten free penne for me, and regular for the family. Sprinkled in mozzarella and Parmesan cheese for extra yumminess.

Quick and easy to make! I couldn't find the type of sausage the recipe calls for so I used 1/2 a smoked sausage and 1/2 a jalapeno sausage. It was so good!! I cut a whole onion into it and used a few peppers from a jar of roasted red peppers instead of 2 green bell peppers. Wow. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!!

Eh. This is not enough liquid. Like some other reviewers mentioned, I added minced onion and garlic. Used hot Ital sausage. I added 1 cup of beef stock. But, it needs more flavor. Needs more liquid. Maybe a wine reduction?

This one is definately going into rotation. A great change from the usual tomato and diary based sauces.  I used some other suggestions to tweak the sauce.  I used a cup of broth, added some minced garlic, diced onion because we do like a lot of sauce. I didn't drain the sausage either, there wasn't more than 2 tablespoon fat and it added a lot of flavor.  Sprinkled with parm cheese before serving too.

I like to start with the recipes as written, then modify it the next time I make it. We did enjoy this, but it was a little bland. Next time I will add some spinach and some garlic for added flavor and health benefits to boot!

Excellent recipe. Like others I added a couple veggies - sweet roma tomatoes and peas. I got a wild hair and decided to melt some cream cheese in the brothy bowties and man oh man, was it good.  A little Parm on top, and another staple meal was born. Thanks!

I make a very similar recipe that also has onions, olives and canned tomatoes added to it. This was a nice change of pace. I used green, red, orange and yellow bell peppers and served it with cracked black pepper and a generous grating of parm. Very good!

It's four stars because it doesn't carry over well in flavor the next day for leftovers.  That said, this is a 5 star recipe in my opinion simply because it's so different.  This is a one dish meal, and hard to believe, because of pasta and italian sausage so light tasting.  The BROTH is the KEY!  Even picky eater teenagers were surprised by the taste.  They were expecting the old standby of sausuage and pepper flavor.  Does make a large bowl so a very economical meal for a big family!  Followed recipe exactly.

I found this recipe on a search for a pasta dish without tomato sauce and this was a big hit. My husband and I both loved this. Perfect flavor for the two of us and no tomato sauce to bother my husband's stomach!

Great recipe. Instead of beef broth I used a can of chicken bouilin .....plus one package of dry onion soup and for the pasta I used the small "frozen" meat ravoli. Only reason I didnt follow the recipe was I didnt have it on stock so I just supllement what I had in the kitchen.
Very good.........Highly suggest you try it!

I make a version of this all the time, it's quick & easy. Mine varies just a tad. I use the frozen package of bell pepper & onion blend (that has green, yellow & red peppers), they are pre-cut & ready to go & I also add about 1/2 of a jar of alfredo sauce & sprinkle parmesan cheese on top!! My 3 & 4 yr old daughters LOVE it as do my husband & I. Great meal for a tired mommy or dinner in a hurry!

Yay!!  A new recipe to add to my short list of "things my husband will eat"!  i made this last night and he liked it.  I added a few things: two teaspoons of sourcream (at the end to give it a smoother texture), one beef bullion cube, red peppers, and red pepper flakes.  I wouldn't say these additions were necessary, but they worked well.  It turned out spicy!  But awesome.

WOW! When I read the reviews, I couldn't believe such a simple recipe could get such great reviews, but made it because I had the ingredients and no time. So delicious! I only had 1/2 of a green and yellow and added 1/2 an onion. Kept the fat in and sprinkled in italian seasoning, 1Tbs of flour for a thicker sauce and 1c of broth. Also added a drained can of diced tomatoes. It was beautiful, tasted wonderful, and my kids loved it!

What a simple meal, but so delicious!!!   And it can be tweaked for your tastes.  I added onion and used red, green, and yellow sweet peppers.  While it was cooking, I added a dash of some McCormick onion and garlic seasoning.

This will definitely be a repeat dinner in this house!

This was excellent!  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to cut up vegetables so I used a frozen vegetable stir fry mix.  I also added cayenne pepper and it was spicy.  Yum

This recipe although needing a little tweaking is sooo yummy! My alterations were using a frozen bag of green and red peppers and onions and a can of beef broth. It does make it a little more liquidy but after you combine them the pasta will soak up the liquid some anyhow. I also used several different spices/herbs and sprinkled with parm cheese before serving. Its a start and needs a little adjustments to your tastes but its different and tasty!

I don't know what all the hype is about with this recipe, sorry! I made it tonight for dinner, because I was missing so many ingredients to make something a little more elaborate. I made it exactly as is and it was so bland. It was edible, but quite bland. I should have known from the list of ingredients that it wouldn't be anything fantastic, but the reviews are so great, that I had to try the recipe out. I won't be making this again. There are FAR better sausage pasta recipes out there, and they're just as simple with just a couple more ingredients!

We loved this dish!  I tripled the amount of broth, making it from beef base. I added red & yellow peppers, fresh green beans, onions, mushrooms, garlic, & crushed red pepper flakes.  I finished it with fresh basil & parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

This was even more delicious than I had imagined! I don't eat red meat so I used turkey Italian sausage and chicken broth. I actually took the sausage out of the casing and turned into a spicy ground turkey kind of thing and VOILA. I can not wait to make this again!

This is a really good base recipe...I added some garlic, white pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and I thickened my sauce a little with cornstarch.  Also topped with some fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese...my husband loved it, simple yet tasty!

This was great.  I used a combination of hot and mild italian sausage and mini lasagne noodles.  We will do it again, only used 1 red and 1 yellow pepper and will do a medium dice.  Didn't do a parm and it was wonderful.  Full cup of beef broth and let is absorb.

This was a great easy dinner. I never had a pasta dish with a broth before and it was yummy. I doubled the broth like others suggested, I used a red and green pepper, added some fresh sliced mushrooms and some marinated artichoke hearts too. I sprinkled it with parm cheese right before serving. Oh I also added some garlic and basil while the veggies were cooking!

YUMMY! I just tweaked it a little. All I had was onions, no peppers so I sauted the onions and smoked sausage with about 3 cloves of chopped garlic and a little hot sauce, excellent! With the help of other reviews I used a whole can of beef broth. I let it all simmer for awhile and served with bread. My husband loved it and he is very picky!! Thanks

This is one of our favorite dishes.  I use red bell peppers, since they are sweeter.  I also add freshly grated parmesan on top before serving.

Really nice, especially with the spicy sausage we used.  Didn't have farfalle, so used penne.  Added abut a 1/2C of chopped red onion, a clove of garlic, about a 1/4t each of thyme, oregano, and marojam, a couple tablespoons of half and half, and used 2 very large peppers.  Served with shredded italian blend cheese on top.

The beef broth is this recipe makes it very salty and most of the liquid ends up getting soaked up by the noodles so it becomes very dry. I ended up adding a red sauce to it at the end because I just could not eat it.

This the first recipe I have taken the trouble to review.  This is WONDERFUL.  It's easy and fast and SO good.  My husband asked me to double the recipe when I make it because he can't get enough.  I believe in rating the recipe as written and it's 5+ stars.  I have also added onions at times,as well as red and yellow peppers along with the green, but this is perfect just as it is.  Use hot or mild sausage or a comination of both...Can't go wrong.

I thought this recipe was very, very good.  Normally I dislike it when chefs post all of their alterations to the recipe.  Since this one did have 197 reviews, I did take some of them into consideration~~to a great attribute to this recipe.  Sauteed onion, garlic, italian seasoning, 8 oz mushrooms and peppers in olive oil.  I like using the frozen pepper trio in soups so I decided to try it in this.  Next time I will use fresh red and yellow peppers.  The frozen ones added a little too much liquid which I had to drain.  Browned the ital sausage and apparently it was pretty lean as I didn't need to drain.  I added 2 cups of beef "stock" (mixed with a Tbs. of beef base) Added the drained farfalle (12 oz) to the sausage & stock and let it simmer for 10 minutes to help absorb the flavor into the pasta which I had cooked al dente to avoid it being overcooked.  Added the cooked veggies, some red pepper flakes and a dash of smoked paparika to the dish.  Let it simmer tossing often to absorb the stock into the pasta, veggies and sausage.  Delicious!!  The only thing I will do different next time, is to add a Tbs of corn starch to the stock, add to the sausage and let it come to a boil to thicken.  This step to help the wonderful sauce adhere to the pasta.  Such a wonderful way to make an Italian pasta dish without a tomato or cream base.  Thanks.

I made so many modifications that I almost feel bad reviewing it... But it was soooo good.  My husband said it was the best thing I have made in a long time.  I am constantly making meals more elaborate than this one, so I am very glad to hear he loved a meal that can be done in like 30 minutes!

Loved this!  Used red, green, yells and orange peppers to add more color, a bit of basil and oregano for a little more flavour,, and mixed a bit of corn starch with a bit of stock  to thicken up the sauce.

I made this according to recipe but it was pretty bland. It really needed more broth and something else. I may make again, but I'll add other things.

To cut the fat and calories I use Turkey Italian Sausage, Low Sodium Beef Broth and Wheat Pasta.  These ingrediants do not effect the flavor at all.

So nice to have a tasty pasta dish without red or cream sauce. To cut down the fat content, we use Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey and it tastes great, even with the beef broth. A nice variation is to saute red bell peppers and/or diced onions with the sausage.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So easy and sooo good. I couldn't believe how much flavor there was to this and honestly I was getting tired of forcing red sauces on my tweens who don't like it. They have now eaten half of this recipe, starting to wonder if there will be enough for the rest of us. Two thumbs up!

This was so good I could not get enough. Although I used country sausage, It was a little spicy for my taste. I added some chopped onions and home grown tomatoes.

WOW!  I wanted an Italian Sausage recipe where I could actually taste the venison Italian Sausage I made this week.  This is the ticket!  So Yummy!  I added onion and mushrooms when cooking the sausage and peppers but even without those two things I think this would be a 5 star for taste, ease, and pretty healthy with the low fat venison sausage.  Everyone enjoyed including my two year old, picky 3 and 4 year old and my 6 year old thanked me for making such a yummy supper!!! Thanks for a recipe that will be a regular menu item at our house!!

This was so simple and so good.  A nice change from using tomato sauce --  I added mushrooms and red pepper flakes as we like a little 'kick"--- next time even more veggies

An excellent meal!  I would suggest adding broccoli for a little "green" power and because it's what I had, I used a package of low-sodium breakfast link sausage that I cut in small pieces.  Thought that this would need more seasoning but it was yummy as is.

Excellent recipe.  Simple and easy to make with much more flavor than I expected.  I took others advice and used 1/2 and onion, red, yellow, and green bell peppers along with mushrooms.  I also doubled the amount of beef broth, and added a little crushed red pepper for some zing.

Delicious quick and easy.  I have just found out for the first time ever that I have high cholesterol so I have been loooking for low fat recipes.  This was perfect...I found a very good Italian sausage made of chicken and used red and green peppers for aesthetic purposes.  I also sauteed a little garlic and some onion in olive oil before cooking the peppers.  5 stars!

Found this recipe when I had some sausage and rainbow peppers in the fridge that needed to be used up, and didn't want a tomato-based sauce.  Thought the recipe seemed almost too simple,but wow...it was very hearty, tasty, and satisfying.  Based on other reviews, I also increased the amount of beefstock (and made it double-strength), and added portobella mushrooms.  Also parboiled the sausages in beer to cut back on the fat...which I then added back in with a healthy sprinkling of parmesan reggiano on top!  :-)  Overall, a great, quick weeknight meal.  Thank you!

This is so easy and delicious.  I used chicken sausage links that had tomato and cheese in them.  I added more than 1/2 c. of beef broth, I wanted more moisture.  I will make this again.

This was good--I added spinach, pine nuts, and garlic for a little extra flavor because I thought it might be a little too bland otherwise. I used about 2 1/2-3 C of pasta, and that seemed perfect.

This was delicious!  It was so easy to make, and my husband, children, and I enjoyed it.  I did add about a teaspoon of minced garlic and topped each serving off with shredded Asiago cheese, but it would have been wonderful without.  Thanks for sharing!

I read the prior reviews and took their advice.  I used a cup of beef broth, added onions and red and yellow bell peppers, salt and pepper and used frozen pork link sausages that I chopped up upon thawing in the hot skillet.  This was a deliciously easy recipe that all enjoyed and I will be making it again.

The recipe as stated was pretty bland even though I used hot italian sausage.  So I added some sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and Parmesan cheese, which made it much better.

This is on my regular menu now!!  You can't beat such a low-fat, simple, AND totally tasty dish!  Plus it's something you can easily play around with.  I added some diced tomatoes, as did others.  Who would have known that beef broth would be such a great pasta sauce?!

This dish was only a moderate success for me.  I added some Hungarian paprika to round out the flavour, but I found the beef broth gave the pasta a strange texture, and it took until I was about halfway through my serving before I could get past it.  The leftovers did not reheat well.  On the whole, I think I won't make it again, but it gave me a good solution for dinner one night when I had sausages to use up.

This was a good recipe, but a little too salty.  A low sodium broth would be best.  I doubled the broth as suggested and included onion, garlic, and basil.  The flavor was good, just too salty.  Will most likely make again.

Might possibly be better with a homemade beef or earthy mushroom stock. As is it lacked any sort of depth of flavor or complexity.

We thought this recipe was good...not spectacular.  I followed the original recipe b/c I wanted to rate the recipe and not my version of it.  After my hubby taste-tested it, I had to go back and add more broth.  I will make again tweaking it to our tastes.

Excellent recipe and very easy to put together - I used red and yellow bell peppers instead of the green and added one half chopped red onion.  Wonderful flavor!  Will definately put this one in my "favorites" recipe file!

This was very good...kid friendly. I forgot to add the pepper...I will make sure that I add it next time. I doubled the broth...it was too dry without it. We are not crazy about Italian sausage so I added chicken sausage instead. Next time I will add a few cloves of garlic to the sausage while it is cooking. We topped it off with parmesan cheese...wonderful flavor.

My husband made this (and he was so proud of himself).  It came together very quickly, and the taste was great!  We added some chopped onion with the peppers, and we topped the dish with some grated parmesan cheese (I think both of these were reviewers' ideas).  Quick, simple fare.

So fast and tasty.  I added fresh garlic, mushrooms, red onion, and used one green pepper and one red for color and flavor.

Pretty good for how easy it is, but I think it could use a little more flavoring, like maybe a a sauce or gravy to top it all off.

Great base recipe, but I had to add a bunch into it to make it taste like more then just beef broth and noodles. I added a few dashes of rosemary, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. Also used red, yellow and orange baby bell peppers because I didn't have any green bell peppers on hand.

This is just a great go-to recipe.  It has great flavor and none of the heaviness.  We use the the hot Italian sausage which really brings it up a notch.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this with chicken instead of beef stock and added garlic and smoked paprika. Also used two different types of sausage chorizo and andouille. Both were turkey sausages. Oh and a little butter. Tasted good to me. Hope it passes my kids' test!

It's decent.  I added tomatoes and that helped.  A good quick meal.  I also used ground Italian sausage and topped with mozzarella cheese after it was plated.  Kids liked it.

So simple, yet very flavorful. I like other reviewers removed the sausage from the casing. I used sweet Italian sausage, that packed more of a kick then expected for sweet. I browned it, did not drain the meat, threw peppers in with it. Then when the noodles were cooked and ready mixed it all together.  I topped with Kraft Parmesan cheese. PERFECT!

I just made this (with some alterations) for dinner and it was awesome. My husband commented that it was one of the very few pasta meals without an actual sauce that tasted excellent. I used Aidells Organic Spinach and Feta Chicken pre-cooked sausages, 3 fresh garlic cloves, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/2 onion, olive oil, penne pasta, chicken broth (didn't have beef), and pepper. I set a pot of water to boil and cut up all my vegetables. (At some point I set the pasta to boil).  I sautéed the onion in the oil for a minute or two and then added the garlic and sausage slices to stir up for another minute or two. Then I added the peppers and sautéed maybe 3 more minutes. All over a low-medium heat. I filled a pyrex measuring glass with 1/2 cup water and added a little less than half a bouillon cube and microwaved for 90 seconds.  I sprinkled some pepper over my sauté' mixture and made sure everything was nice and tender. Then I added the broth, boiled it all for a minute and added the drained pasta. A lovely meal and my 3 year old couldn't get enough of the sausages-lol- although they are a creation of their own.

The recipe has a good framework to work with. Used hot italian sausage, browned after removing it from the casing.  Added sliced portabello mushrooms, sliced sweet onion, green & orange sweet peppers and a few cloves of minced garlic in the sautee, seasoned with some black pepper & seasoned salt.  After draining, added diced tomatoes, cannelini beans and the beef broth, seasoned with some thyme leaves, a pinch of crushed red pepper and let simmer.  Very tasty and if you're creative with your veggies, very colorful in presentation.  Fast & easy!

Fantastic!! Only made 2 minor changes. First I used smoked sausage instead of Italian, and cooked the green peppers separately as not everyone here likes them. Easy and made a huge pot. Fed 4 of us easily with some not finishing their plates. Cheap and easy. Definitely a keeper!

Surprising!  Substituted whole grain pasta, all natural-skinless beef sausage and organic white pepper.  As I was making this, I thought, this will not be flavorful enough for me.  I usually like a lot ingredients and spices.  This was not my favorite flavor, but it was good and had a lot of flavor.

We have a recipe almost exactly like this in a book here at home.  It's SO easy, and it's delicious.  We use red peppers and 1/4 cup chopped fresh, Italian (flat) parsley.  You can use ground sausage of your taste, or we love the Italian links with cheese in them.  They're easier to cut after the sausage is cooked.

I agree with others--didn't care for the broth at all. I left it out and just kind of tossed the peppers, sausage and pasta. So, bottom line--leave out the broth and it may be nudged toward 3 stars for me.

I was looking for a pasta dish that wasn't too heavy with creams & sauces. I wanted to incorporate sausage as well. However, I found this to be a little bland and dry. Added lots of fresh grated Parmesan which helped add flavor. Still searching.

Just had this lovely recipe for dinner and it was fantastic.  I took others' advice and added onion and mushrooms as well as a full can of low sodium beef broth.  Also used super lean turkey Italian sausage and served it over spaghetti because that's what I had on hand.  It was truly scrumptious and very easy to make.

I hope you like sausage and peppers, because obviously there's not much else to this dish.  I used penne pasta in place of farfalle and instead chunked up some ground Italian sausage rather than cutting up links since my local grocery store was having a sale.  I also added a bit of onion and garlic in hope of increasing the flavor intensity and complexity.  While that helped a little bit, I'm just not terribly impressed with this dish.  I felt like the quantity of pepper and sausage was just too high for the amount of pasta suggested, and also, while the sausage, pepper, and beef broth combination is termed a sauce, it doesn't eat like one.  I see at least one reviewer enjoys this recipe by tweaking it with a can of diced tomatoes.  Seems like the right direction anyway.

Like many others, when I read this I thought, this is not going to be so great. However, I stand corrected. I added red bell pepper, onions, and an extra 1/2 cup of broth. It was terrific. The whole family loved it!

Actually added 1 small can tomatoes, 1/2 sliced red onion to the sausage and peppers and few flake of hot red pepper and 2 cups beef boillon and then cooked the pasta (did not cook separately) in with the mix for 10 minutes.
Very tasty and spicy.
Not low fat!!!
Very enjoyable!!

I make a similar recipe that been a family favorite for years. Instead of adding beef broth I add 1/2 can of diced tomatoes (approx 1 cup) and some dried basil....yummy!

yes this is a base for me, i'm rating this as it is, but love to make a home made red gravy, add mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and the spices i like, (basil, or oregono,garlic, italian seasoning, using thin pasta, i bid you a great experience, then i would rate mine as a 5 star, but every one has there own taste buds, it's all good, but i like mine very fine, hope you experiment to your liking enjoy

Our version has been a family favorite for years.  Instead of broth, I use 2 cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes, breaking up the tomatoes as they are added.  Also a sliced onion and sometimes mushrooms, depending on what is available in the fridge to use up.  Will try it with broth.

Tried this recipe for a weekday dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I modified it slightly by adding mushrooms, onion and sundried tomatoes topped with fresh parmesan cheese.  Don't forget the fresh bread.  I would definitely make this again.  Simply, Fast and Yummy!

Super easy to make. I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken instead. It came out good and I had it for leftovers the next day.

This was awesome! I changed it up to what I had on hand. Used chicken sausage, 1 pepper, 1 onion and tossed in some asparagus. Tasty indeed! I sprinkled a little bit of grated parmesan on top and it was delicious. Thanks for a super easy and tasty dinner!

My family loved this recipe - with a few minor tweaks.  I browned a pound of ground pork sausage.  I also used a yellow and a red pepper for sweetness.  Minced garlic, a large chopped tomato, and finally a bunch of chopped cilantro was added before serving.  Serve with parmesan cheese.  Delicious, healthy, and beautiful in presentation!

I have made this simple, yet delicious recipe many times, my family loves it!  you can add other veggies to it too, like mushrooms, onion, carrots.  I usually add a couple shakes of Italian seasoning to it also.

A really tasty easy meal that doesn't take long to make.  Depending on the brand of sausage, you may not need to drain it.  I used the fat of the sausage to sautee the peppers, so I didn't need to drain.

I thought this was great b/c I love all the peppers in there.  My husband didn't like it so much - that's why I gave it 4 stars.  I also added white wine and hot pepper flakes.

This dish was great.  I used half Hot pork sausage and 2 brats of salsiccia sausage (that I pulled out of the brat skins) and I sauted it all and left it in big chunks.  I probably added more than a 1/2 cup of water because I wanted more sauce and I put 2 beef bouillon cubes (to make it a beef broth).  Then I stirred in about 4 ounces of cream cheese and let it melt and it was delicious.  I also didn't drain the juice from the sausage.  This is definitely a keeper!

First off, my boyfriend loves this. He even claims this to be his favorite dish of the moment. It's simple and fast and he loves the taste. He made it on a night I wasn't home for dinner. We made this together yesterday. I believe we used too much pasta, because I thought it was bland and couldn't figure out why he raved about it. We used spicy sausages and green peppers. I think I would have enjoyed it more with broccoli and maybe a bit of mozza. We didn't have any. So I added a bit of fresh dill. I love dill. In general, a good and simple recipe, but nothing spectacular.

This was ok. We cooked crumbled sausage then set it aside in a bowl & cooked the peppers (I used a mixture of red, orange & just a little bit of green) in the sausage fat, when it got a little dry I added a tad of broth to keep the peppers from not burning.  When the peppers were done, we added the sausage, broth & a sprinkle of black pepper. I put some freshly grated Parmesean on the table for topping. I think next time I will let the broth soak in the pasta more & maybe then it will have more flavor. It was good but nothing spectacular.

I made this tonight for dinner as the recipe stated (except different pasta, and 1 green pepper and 1 red pepper, because of what I had on hand).  As is, I think this is an average weeknight dinner.  I wish I read the reviews before I started, but I was rushing to  throw dinner on the table before I ran out for work... it definitely needs the broth doubled.... Also, next time I may crumble the sausage for a quicker cook, and add red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.  Thank you for sharing, I will definitely keep this in my recipe box and try again, when I have enough time to do some tweaking.

The core recipe was excellent. My only addition, I recall, was sliced black olives which, I feel, enhanced the flavor.

Used red, orange and yellow peppers instead of green and smoked sausage instead of Italian. Also, used 1 cup of beef broth for more sauce. Definitely a keeper. Both wife and I loved it.

The 1/2 cup of beef brother was most definintley not enough sauce. It was pretty dry. I ended up adding some marinara sauce & butter. Next time, I will probably use a different sauce. My picky husband didn't enjoy it. lol

It was very good. I followed some reviews: added mushrooms, 1 green and 1 red pepper, some onnion and garlic powder, and more beef broth. Also, instead of pasta i made mashed potatoes. It was really good.

I loved this recipe-! I liked that there was no red sauce and it is perfect for a summer meal. I grilled my sausage on the grill for a few minutes then brought it inside and sliced it. I added it to a pan with garlic and some butter. I added a bag of defrosted Trader Joe’s Fire Roasted Bell Peppers and Onions. I tossed until warm and added the broth. Brought to boil and then added the cooked pasta. Sprinkled some Parmesan- and WOW what an easy, quick and delicious dinner.

This was a nice change of pace from pasta with sauce.  Easy to follow and came out well with gluten free pasta.  The sausage and broth I used weren’t too salty, so I added Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper.  Beef broth adds a nice depth of flavor.  I also added spinach & basil just for extra veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe, as written was OK.  When I made it a second time, I added a chopped onion and some crushed red pepper to make it more exciting.  I also used half sweet sausage and half hot sausage.

I made this with the garlic sausage, a mix of mini peppers, & added red onions. I also accidently put double the broth so I thickened it with some flower & water mixed in to a paste. I didn't drain the juices like they told me to either which made an amazing sauce. No extra spice just pepper like they say made a vary savory and filling dish I think I will add grated carrot next time for some extra vegies

Everyone in my family loved this pasta dish. The only thing I did different was I added more beef broth. I also made this one time with penne pasta and I didn't like it with that type of pasta, the noodle absorbed the beef broth too much. The bow ties is way better!!

I do something similar.  Only I add onion & garlic to the peppers.  Also I use Balsamic vinegar instead of the broth. I mix fresh basil in at the end.

I make this once a week in summer, when I can get the peppers from my garden.  It's terrific!  We like adding sliced onion and cherry tomatoes (or quartered Roma tomatoes) to the mix.  I've done it with the beef broth, with chicken broth (not as great, but that's just me).  I've also done it with marinara sauce, and a couple times with Alfredo sauce (again, not as great, but YMMV).

This is my favorite pasta dish.  My husband told me he didn't think he would like this combination but in fact loves it too.

I just added a pat of butter to the sauce.

A wonderful recipe!!!!!
I double the meat and add 3/4 cup of Mayo to add some creaminess and flavor. I don't drain the meat. I think it takes away all the good flavor. Also, put lots of cracked pepper and add minced garlic (fresh).

I had some Italian sausage and red peppers to use and I found this recipe. I added a few mushrooms and a small onion, but otherwise followed the recipe. I thought for sure this was going to be on the dry side, but boy was I wrong. This had so much flavor and the pasta soaked up all the juices so it wasn't a bit dry. My husband and brother in law loved it and we all had two helpings.  I can't believe how simple it was and I think the red peppers made it look so colorful and probably a little sweetness to offset the hot. This is the kind of,recipe you can have fun with adding different veggies. Loved it!

It was a little too dry.  I used pasta sauce on the leftovers.  If I make it again, I would use twice the amount of beef broth and add some sort of pasta sauce to it.

Very easy, very good. Instead of Italian sausage, I used smoked sausage because that's what I had on hand. I sliced the sausage and sauted it with garlic and just a small amount of sweet onions. I then added a bag of frozen mixed sweet bell peppers and tossed all with pasta and beef broth. I added some parmesan cheese to finished product and fresh basil and parsley. This was very good. Definitely will make again.

I CANT BELIEVE how delicious this was! I'm pretty sure it would've been absolutely perfect just following the recipe but I added things because, well, I'm me. I doubled the pasta and beef broth, removed the sausage from its casing, and added 2 cloves of garlic. I added a pinch of garlic and onion powder while it was cooking and at the end cooked the pasta with the sausage and pepper.

Incredibly easy to make and ready quick. The beef broth mixes really well with the sausage and green peppers and the pepper gives it a nice, smoky flavor. This was a great dinner. Parents went up for seconds, you know that's a plus :).

So I stumble across this recipe and it sounds absolutely fantastic! I took a couple of reviews and melded them together to make this dish, made a double portion, and could not have been more pleased! I found that the use of hot sausages and a little bit of red pepper flakes really kick up the heat in this dish and give it that spice that it needs. Extra points for this recipe because it's very quick and easy to make and taste absolutely delicious! Thank you very much for posting this on this website!

Simply delicious recipe! I did the same as someone else mentioned and added tomatoes and a tsp of Italian seasoning. We still have an overflow of frozen fresh diced tomatoes in the freezer. I added them once the onions and peppers (I did red and yellow) where ready. It's basically a throw it all in there sauce. Oh and I also used Johnsonville Hot Italian sausage with casings removed chopped into chunks. Will be making it again. Thanks for sharing. :)

My family loved this recipe (kids, husband, my mother and myself)!  It was quick, easy and absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe (although I did add fresh mushrooms)and it was excellent.  There was nothing left for leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

savory! Like others I added some more veggies like red bell peppers, onions, zucchini and mushrooms. I used Jennie-O hot Italian turkey sausage pushed out of the casing. it is not that hot, but the extra spices mask the fact you are eating turkey. Whole wheat pasta too.

Yummy and easy! My boyfriend doesn't like heavy sauces, so this recipe is perfect. I added a teaspoon of garlic to the sausage and used a whole can of beef broth because I used a whole 12oz bag of pasta, other than that, I didn't change anything else. This one is a keeper!

This was easy and very good! Used turkey sausage (sweet Italian) and mosticioli pasta. Made as written just added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper and Parmesan. 
Thanks for the yummy recipe.

I fixed this as Plan B Saturday as it was raining and we couldn't grill. Used suggestions by other reviewers: chopped onion, red and yellow peppers, hot Italian turkey sausage crumbled, can of diced tomatoes.  Added partially cooked penne to mixture for about 8 minutes to let it soak up some of the juice and it was wonderful!  Parm on the table to top it off.  Easy, yummy and not too bad for you.  Sourdough rolls on the side to sop.

This is ok - a little bland, but I was expecting that. I followed the recipe as written. I think if I make it again I will add some onion and a touch of garlic to give it more flavor. I also like the idea of adding some red pepper flakes, but i have young kids who wouldn't appreciate that very much. My only other complaint is that by adding the peppers at the same time as the sausage they got a little soft/soggy. I would add them later in the cooking process.

The sauce seemed a little thin.  I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to give it a richer texture and flavor.

This is one of those meals you can make in 20 mins but sometimes I find that the pasta kinda gets a bitterish taste. Just slightly bitterish. Has anyone else experienced this and what causes it?

This recipe was a good base in which to put my own spin on things, like I always do. I used a Johnsonville Beef Sausage. Red, Green and Yellow Peppers, Onions, and Fresh Mushrooms. I used Tri-Color Rigatoni. Couple pinches of salt and pepper. Tbsp of garlic powder. Mixed everything together and let sit over low heat for about 30 minutes. Top with some grated parm cheese. Eat it up! Nom-nom-nom!

Rating this 4 stars because I made a couple changes but my family really enjoyed it!! I was thinking it would be too plain but it ended up being really tasty!
I ended up using some frozen sliced peppers, onions, zuchini and potato mix instead of cutting up peppers by hand. I couldnt find a straight-up pepper mix so I got this kind and it worked out well.
I cooked my sausage and then removed from the pan to cool. While it was cooling, I added a can of Italian flavor diced tomotoes to the pan. I am a sauce person so I wanted this meal to have a little more liquid to it. I then added my pepper mix and also the cup of beef broth. I then sliced up the sausage and added, then let it cook up for about 10 more minutes to really get the flavor going. I served over bowties.
So really, the only big change I made was add a can of diced tomatoes and we all really loved it. Definitely a make-again!

This is a really tasty, and easy to make dish.  I tried it at home and loved it so much I made it for a friend for a birthday treat!  He loved it so much he got the recipe from me.  He's a basic level cook, and had no problem following this recipe.

This recipe was very easy, inexpensive, and good.  I used red bell peppers rather than green.  My 3-year-old and 6-year-old both thought the sausage was too hot even though I purchased the mild Italian sausage.  I got a big kiss from my husband after dinner.  He continued to praise it as he ate it.  I'll cook this again!

Was ok.  Added onions, mushrooms, garlic and a whole can of beef broth with 12oz of pasta.  Cooked for daughter who can't have tomatoe sauces right now.  Probably will not make again.

this is pretty good. i use a long sausage link in mine. it is a little on the bland side but that can be fixed with a little parmesan cheese. okay, a lot of parmesan cheese. but my husband keeps requesting it so he must like it.
