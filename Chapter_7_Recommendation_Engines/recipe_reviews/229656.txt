This is a great salad as is, however, I cut back on the apples and added shredded carrots. I made it even more colorful.  Doubled it makes a great pot-luck dish.

I used strawberry jello since I wanted to make this in heart-shaped molds.  Any red flavor would be excellent - strawberry, raspberry, or cherry. I hope someone comes along and makes it with the lime to make the photo appropriate for the title. Use your judgment and add only the amount of diced apples as would seem right. Mine must have been on the large side, so the salad was entirely too full of apples...it was really good though.

I cut the recipe in half to fit mould, used red AND green Granny Smith apples. Used sugar-free Jello instead. Sliced celery very thin. Had an awesome, almost lavender,  floral hint to it. Very elegant. I filled the center with fresh cranberries for the Thanksgiving table motif.

Very tasty and refreshing jello salad.  I made it as per the recipe and poured it into a 9 x 11 Pyrex dish to chill.  I served it with a dollop of Cool Whip.
