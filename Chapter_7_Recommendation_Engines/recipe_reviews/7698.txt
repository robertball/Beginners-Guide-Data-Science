I have never made a torte before so I didn't know exactly what to expect but I liked the results.  I did expect it to be a little moister but that will probably get better as I practice this recipe more.  I also added shredded coconut and pecan halves to the bottom of each cake pan before pouring in the batter.  That and the icing really made this cake!  I took it in to work today and even though cakes aren't normally a big hit at my office, this one was completely gone at the end of the day.  All the guys were ready to propose to me! haha

This recipe did not work so well for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out super dry and kind of bland.  I would make some changes before I ever made this one again.
