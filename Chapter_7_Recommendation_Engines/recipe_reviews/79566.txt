This is one that grows on you.  If you like blue cheese, you will love it.  It's even better the next day, because all the flavors have time to soak in.  Yummy!

This was pretty good, but i made some changes.  First, I fried the tofu for about 20 minutes, skipped the dredging and just combined all of the ingredients.  I served it on top of orzo which was a god additiion.  Also, I tried topping with gorgonzola since thats what i had on hand, but i didn't care for it.  I thought it was better with no cheese.

Sounds like a strange combination but, it was very good.  I had a difficult time dredging the tofu through the walnuts and have them stick.

It was ok. I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts, as I don't like walnuts. i also used brown rice. it had an ok flavor, but was just a little weird. I might make it again.

This wasn't my thing I guess.  I substituted gorgonzola cheese for Blue and yellow onion for red.

I added more tarragon and sage and the flavor was good, but the tofu should have been marinated in something before hand. I will make this again.
