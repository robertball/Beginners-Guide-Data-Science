As the recipe is written, I'd probably give this 4 stars.  However, I made some changes that we loved that made it a 5-star one for us.  I used baby eggplants for the flavor and tenderness, used a whole pepper (orange because that's what I had on hand), added 2 cloves of minced garlic, used Italian seasoning instead of the separate spices, substituted 14 oz of crushed tomatoes for half the diced tomatoes, used precooked bacon that I sauteed for a couple of minutes to crisp up nicely, added a pinch of crushed red pepper and used aged provolone in place of the swiss cheese, which I feel is a bit too mild for the bold flavors of the dish.  I baked until the dish was bubbly and the cheese was nicely browned.  It was delicous and we'll definitely make again with the same revisions I made the first time.  We loved it.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!

I was cooking for vegetarians so I omitted the bacon, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was absolutely delicious!!!!!!

This dish is completely awesome!  It's a really different way to make eggplant.  I was out of bacon so used polish sausage and it was still great.  This is going to become a staple in my house:)

Have made this three times--Everyone asks for the recipe. I vary with or without bacon with who I am feeding.  Fantastic.

My husband hated this, and I was pretty indifferent. I won't make it again.

It sounded great until I read the fine print.  Bacon?  Bacon and eggplant don't even sound good.  It's in the vegetarian section and it shouldn't be.

The mix of flavors (bacon, sage) surprised me at first, but I ended up liking this dish a lot. I used a little less sage. I halved the recipe but used the same amount of bacon and pepper, so I guess it means I doubled the amount of those two ingredients. Would make again. I also broiled the eggplant slices in the oven instead of frying them in the pan, which I find easier and less time consuming.

This had an odd flavor that I don't think would have mass appeal. I suggest making this for yourself and not for guests. I really like Greek moussaka and will stick to that next time.
