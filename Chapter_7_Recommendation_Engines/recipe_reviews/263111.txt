Good recipe but use large shrimp and cut them up. Larger shrimp have more flavor.

Made as written except that I left out the sugar and this turned out good. It was fast, easy, and would be perfect on a hot summer day. The only change I'll make next time is to use raw shrimp and cook them on the grill. The salsa goes really good with the shrimp. This is a keeper!
