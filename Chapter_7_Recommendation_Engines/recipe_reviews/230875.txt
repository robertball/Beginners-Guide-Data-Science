So here's the story...I thought I would make this while RVing...made the "sauce" in advance, brought the Pyrex and shredded potatoes all in anticipation of baking this dish. After waiting over 45 minutes for my RV oven to "heat up" and getting a headache from the propane, I decided on Plan B.

I took the cheese mix, folded in the potatoes and put the entire concoction into a slow cooker. I figured at this point I had nothing to lose. I cooked it on high for about 1 hour and then changed the setting to low and left for about 2 hours. I checked it upon my return, and low and behold, I had a dish that was respectable for the RV community potluck. I added the parmesan cheese about 20 minutes prior to completing the cooking. People enjoyed this casserole.

I had some leftover "sauce" that I folded into some additional frozen potatoes and made latkes. They were especially yummy! 

The moral of the story...when your oven is on the fritz, don't be afraid to drag out the slow cooker!

I followed this recipe as written and added  some bacon cooked crispy and broke into pieces. I also like peppers in my cheesy potatoes so I added some chopped red peppers also. I have tried other recipes for potato casseroles but this is  by far the best. This is always a great hit at  pot lucks. Thanks for sharing.

I was not impressed.  The taste was nothing exceptional and the only thing that saved it was the crispy hash browns on top.

Was hosting Ladies Bunco Night and needed an easy vegetable side, chose this, and was very glad I did!  I doubled the recipe because I had a 32 ounce bag of cubed hash browns on hand.  Got rave reviews by the bunco girls and several of them asked for the recipe.  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I'm a sucker for tater casseroles and I've had some awesome ones and some, not so awesome ones. This was pretty good. I used cream of mushroom soup because I couldn't find cream of potato and I added some Johnny's Garlic Seasoning (that stuff is like my Frank's Red hot, I put that sh*t on everything).  It turned out awesome and was a big hit!!!

This is excellent. I followed another reviewer and used a package of o'brian potatoes and no parmesan on top

I had never made these. I was nervous, as I was having a big Easter meal. Thank you so much for this recipe. It was exactly what I wanted. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly. It looked very delicious, I feel it lacked flavor. It was bland.

What a HUGE hit this simple-to-make casserole was! I used Obrien potatoes for added flavors and will try some green chilies in it next time. Everyone raved about it and there were no leftovers. Add in the fact that it took no time to put together, you have a big winner!

I made this for a pot luck. It's an easy side dish to make. The taste was good, but I thought it was nothing special.  To my surprise, it was very popular among both kids and adults, and several people commented that it was very good and wanted the recipe. Next time I need a side dish for a casual event, I will make this again, but perhaps with a little more seasoning.
