I scaled the recipe to 25 apples as that is what I had. I made 3 deep dish pies with it. I had 34 caramels, which I cut in half and divided among the 3 pies. I halved the sugar and used brown sugar instead of white. These pies will be a nice change from regular apple pie.

This is delicious and very easy and quick to make! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I thought it was too much sugar. Thankfully I only used 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet! There is still the extra sweet with the caramels and glaze, so 1 cup of sugar is plenty if you use granny smith apples. If you used a slightly sweeter apple you might want to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. To combat the extra sweet I sprinkled a little sea salt over the top, it goes so well with the caramel! I also used 12 caramels in this as it covered a little more evenly in the pan.  I will definitely make this again!
