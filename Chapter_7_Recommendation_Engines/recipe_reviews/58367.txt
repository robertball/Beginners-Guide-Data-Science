Excellent peanut butter cookies, and I don't even particularly like peanut butter cookies.  Following a previous member's review, I converted for the 15 serving recipe.  If you don't have a scale, it came out to  1 1/4 C. shortening, 1 1/4 C. white sugar, 3/4 C. brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1 C. peanut butter, 2 3/4 C. all-purpose flour, 1 3/4 tsp. baking soda, 1/4 tsp. salt,  Follow the same instructions.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe wasn't too bad to convert to family serving. The texture of the cookies was a little crumbley but overall very tasty.

I work for a school cafeteria myself baking for 650 kids and this by far beats the recipe that we had previously used for years! Dough is rather thick but don't let it fool you.... cookies bake to perfection!

THIS IS A GREAT COOKIE!! I actually decided to try this because it said "school cafeteria" and that was appealing...boy am I glad I did. I would go so far as to say that EVERYONE who ate this cookie LOVED IT. I followed the measurements posted in the review by Erin H. on June 9 09...and it was spot on!THESE WERE GREAT!! I will use this recipe from now on. In total 9 different people ate these and each one raved about it. A friend and her mom actually called me on the phone after they were in the car eating the cookies...they called to rave and say how good they were! As with all of us out here in "all recipe" land I love when people love my cooking/baking! Try this recipe and you will not be disappointed. I made the cookies regular size (1"-1.5" balls) and baked them at 350. The recipe temperature & time is for large cookies so if you want regular size cookies bake at 350 for about 8-9 minutes. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

Really good cookies! My only issue was that for some reason these took waaaaay longer to cook in my oven than the recipe stated about 14 minutes. Usually my oven runs about 25 degrees hot so no idea why. Once they were done they were lovely chewy peanut buttery goodness.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe. I wanted to stay home over the weekend to avoid spending too much so I came here to find recipes...Oh my- this is much more fulfilling that I expected. The cookies turned out amazing. The recipe is so easy to follow and the cookies are truly worthwhile. I think a little less sugar would be good but everything else was perfect. I will be baking these for my guests in a few days. I also have photos to post.

Excellent! I scaled the recipe down & made 11 doz. Baked at 350 for 12 minutes & let cool on the cookie sheet before removing. DH loved them and found them to have a "soothing flavor." My one son is not a big fan of peanut butter and he really enjoyed these also. Will be making these again.

I've tried this twice. Very dry. Takes to long to cook. Maybe it is because I downsized the recipe for 12 servings.I did read the footnote and gave them a try anyway. Will not make for home use again.

It's probably just me...but I didn't like these cookies much. They seemed 'chalky' and 'crumbly' with little flavor. I like chewy cookies and this wasn't it. Sorry.

I baked these cookies last night using the smaller amounts listed by other posters. They absolutely melt in your mouth! Nice and flavorful and they go very well with coffee. My husband took a large supply to work with him and by the end of first break half of them had disappeared. He checked back when it was time to come home and there was not a cookie to be found. Am now checking around to borrow an institutional mixer to make cookies for the local food pantry. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I followed the 15 serving recipe posted by Erin H (thanks for posting Erin H) Cookies came out delicious. Made 46 cookies. My husband couldn't stop raving about them. They do taste just like the school cafeteria.

I made these using Erin H.'s measurements. My husband grew up in a Chicago suburb and without telling him the name of the recipe he said they tasted like his school cookies. I didn't care for them until the next day and then I loved them! I think if they are crumbling then the flour isn't incorporate well enough.

Don't taste at all like the ones I had in high school absolutely no flavor waste of time and ingredients. Will not try these again.
