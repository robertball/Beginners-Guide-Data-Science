FANTABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've been saying for the last few days that I wanted some cod & panko, so on the hunt I went...ran across this quick little ditty & was most pleasantly surprised. I didn't have any cheddar cheese, so I used the rest of some 4-cheese (Italian blend) and the rest Asiago cheese instead and when I tell y'all that dish was good!!!!!! Yep, this will be in the rotation.

loved the combination of spinach and fish (only we use a lot more spinach).  No changes.   I did notice that one reviewer said she changed the egg for mayo...........she must have been reviewing a different recipe because no egg listed in this one.  I just question this that is all.

Was looking for a recipe for pollock, found this one.  Used lime juice instead of lemon because I didn't have a lemon.  My husband and grandchildren loved it.  The only way my granddaughter likes pollock.

Even with the cheese, this was a healthy choice type of recipe that really delivered on taste.  Don't skimp on the spinach.  We all know how it cooks down, so be sure to use the entire pound.  Such an easy one dish dinner that serves up veggies, protein and flavor.

Love this!!!  Have made several times, it is so easy and perfect for busy days!  I make as is except cutting back on the dill (not a favorite taste).  The spinach is always piled way higher than my 9x13 dish, I have to try to pack it down to get it all to fit inside but it bakes down so no worries.  I have tried this with cod and tilapia, both are good but when using tiliapa put a little extra water to the bottom of the dish so the spinach does not dry out..   Also do not over cook or spinach will dry out.   One of my favorite recipies!!!!

This turned out very well although I did not follow the recipe exactly.I am giving 4 stars since I did change the recipe. I did not have a lemon or the fresh dill but I used some old bay seasoning, and some garlic salt, The cheese and bread crumbs make a rich topping which was satisfying and flavorful. Family loved it!

I made this as posted. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again. Such a nice change from regular baked fish. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this yesterday and it was okay. I think I'll cut the 1 teaspoon of salt as this dish which my husband and I thought made it way to salty. The only change I made was that I used dried dill weed instead of fresh and used cream of celery instead of mushroom as suggested by another review. I think it will be better the next time I prepare it.

Whole family including very picky preschooler enjoyed this one! I didn't have lemon or dill so I skipped those but it didn't taste like it was missing anything. I did add some pieces of butter to the spinach to add flavor and because a couple of the reviews mentioned that the spinach had dried out.

This was just OK. If you're going to make it, you should note that the cooking time is longer for 1 inch thick pieces of cod - breaking them into smaller pieces as the recipe recommends would have helped this cook faster. I probably won't make again.

It was ok. the spinach was a waste as it disintegrated into hard flakes. My kids would not finish the meal as they didn't like the taste. The adults thought the lemon zest and dill did taste good, but imo this recipe needs tweeking.The panko cheese crust didn't stay on well. I would recommend seving it over rice if you managed to make it work for your meal.
