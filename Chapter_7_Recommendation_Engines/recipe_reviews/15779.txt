Thank you Nancy for this easy and decadent recipe.  I've had chocolate almond bark before, however what makes this recipe so delicious is the sauted to a golden brown almonds that add so much flavor.  I made 3 batches - semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips.  I gave this chocolate almond bark as Christmas Gifts, in cute tin containers lined with wax paper.  I kept my gifts in the fridge until I gave them away, suggesting to keep the bark in the fridge as I find it softens quickly. I will make again next Christmas - however I wonder do I have to use chocolate chips or can I use a higher quality chocolate?  I will attempt next time to swirl white chocolate throughout the dark/milk chocolate or vise versa!

Good stuff and an EASY holiday treat (compared to the several batches of cookies one will normally make for the season).  I used whole almonds instead of chopped and made one batch with chocolate chips, the other with white chocolate.  Although it may appear obvious, the instructions for this recipe forgot to include the final step: pouring the chocolate and almond mix over the wax paper, allowing to cool and breaking it into pieces.  An important step since this bark recipe cannot remain in the pot...without wrecking the bark or your pot.

Yummy!  I make mine with dark chocolate - PC semi-sweet chocolate chips are best.  The shortening is a must to get the chocolate to melt right.

If you need a QUICK chocolate fix. This recipe is for you. I definately love it and I'm an admitted chocoholic! I used whole almonds sporadically throughout, but I also used coarsely chopped whole almonds for a real nutty texture. Bittersweet chocolate baking bars were good in this recipe, too. Thanks for sharing, Nancy.

I would leave out the shortening next time. The shortening makes the chocolate stay soft.

The recipe is complete. See it says to sprinkle with remaining almonds, and chill 30 minutes, or until solid. 

I love this stuff and thought I might even make some this year to have for emergency gifts this Christmas.

Mmmmmm.  I used a good quality milk chocolate which made this especially creamy and good.  I also used whole, roasted salted almonds, which I chopped very coarsely.  I loved the sweet/salty contrast.  I made it easy on myself and just dropped the mixture into miniature foil baking/candy cups. So cute and a good way to help with portion control!

This treat is tasty year round! I have found that it is easier to use Candiquik, than chocolate chips.  You can find it at Wal Mart...or your local grocer. You can microwave it and it never turns lumpy!

As is this recipe is fine. I used sliced almonds, melted the chocolate in my crock pot on low, and used M+Ms on top. One thing to note, as you double the recipe I used half semisweet half milk chocolate otherwise it would have been too sweet.

Very easy, yet delicious! I melted the chocolate chips (I used semi-sweet) and shortening in the microwave ,then stired in the toasted almonds (I used sliced) and a large handful of dried cherries. Be sure to store it in the fridge, it gets soft and messy very quickly. Nice enough for gift giving, simple enough to make anytime.

Great basic recipe! I tweaked ours slightly, but it is the same concept. I used dark chocolate so my husband would eat it and left out the shortening. I added a sprinkle on cinnamon across the top as it is drying before I cut the bark.

Very easy, very tasty!  I didn't have shortening, so I substituted butter.  It took a little longer to harden, but this is a keeper.  The toasting of the almonds makes the bark better than most recipes.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I didn't think the almonds needed to be roasted before hand.  I thought it just gave the bark a weird taste when it was finished.  Next time I will try just coarsly chopping my whole almonds and dropping them in.  I also thought the recipe should have been doubled.

I thought this was good, although I probably really didn't need a recipe for this. I made 1/2 recipe and used dark chocolate and butter instead of shortening. Almost all nuts today come roasted, so I didn't bother toasting them further. When they aren't raw, cooking them further almost makes them taste burnt in my opinion. To save time, I also melted the chocolate chips in the microwave. My only issue with the recipe is like most all chocolate today, even though I used dark, the chocolate still tastes so sweet to me. Using a salted nut, may have helped with that. My chocolate wasn't perfectly smooth after adding the nuts either, but unless it is commercial it is to be expected. I liked the idea of saving half of the almonds to put them on top. I think, it could have used even more nuts and cashews would have been pretty good too. I broke it into about 1 1/2" pieces for a treat when the chocolate cravings hit.

I used sliced almonds because that was all I had. I had to do toast two batches of almonds because the first one burnt fairly quickly. As for the chocolate, I used regular nestle milk chocolate chips, so it wasn't amazingly delicious, but it wasn't bad at all either. I didn't like the fact that it cannot stand room temperature for more than 10 min without becoming soft. I think if I were to make it again, I would use a better quality chocolate because that's pretty much all I can taste.

So easy! That is a bonus when making a bunch of holiday treats. I did however burn my first batch of toasted almonds. I turned my head for what seemed like a second and they were unusable. So, watch them like a hawk and the whole recipe will be perfect. I left the baking sheet in the fridge over night (just forgot) and in the morning the bark was still good. I think next time I will try dark chocolate chips for a richer flavor. I think this was a bit milky for my taste but many people love milk chocolate. Try it.

Did not turn out as well as I had hoped. Would have used a deeper pan as opposed to a shallower pan and would have used whole almonds instead of sliced. But it tasted good.

Just a quick note: if you live in a high altitude area, you may want to omit the shortening. Having the chocolate set completely is difficult enough. (a former Denver candy maker)

Wanted a quick hostess gift over the holidays.  This not only fit the bill, I made some to send to out of state friends and took some to the bridge club.  Everyone loved it.  One of my best friends is a chocoholic and she couldn't get enough.  And it's so easy to make.  Followed the directions to the letter and it came out perfect.  And it shipped beautifully!  This recipe will definitely come in handy in the future.  Thanks, BUCHKO!

I gave this only 2 stars because it may be my fault that this ended up in the trash.  The chocolate didn't melt soft or smooth enough. I couldn't spread it at all. unfortunally even if it is my fault I won't make this again. sorry I like this for parties too.

This was just pretty average - nothing special. Milk chocolate was maybe, the wrong choice - I think it needed a bolder, darker chocolate. Not enough almonds and I would have liked a firmer texture.

How crazy simple and crazy yummy is this???? Just make sure to keep an eye on the almonds when you're toasting them.

This was an easy recipe to make.  It is good but our family prefers the white chocolate bark recipes that contain crushed peppermints or Oreos.  This was a nice change of pace.

I would give this recipe 4 stars.  The chocolate 
melts to quickly.  I think putting white chocolate would help with that as well as with the taste.  I will try that next time I make it.

I agree - great for a quick chocolate fix.   Hardens in a snap in the fridge, and a tasty cold snack as well.

This recipe shows how easy it is to make bark, which is such a decadent treat. But the shortening is unnecessary, and for those who said it went soft, this is why. You should not refrigerate bark. As for method, it is best to temper the chocolate so you don't get the bloom. That can be a bit complicated but to keep it simple, keep some of the chocolate chips (I used domes) out to add after the rest has melted and pot removed from the stove. Definitely use the double boiler as this recipe suggests. Once the chocolate has melted, stir in the remaining chips or domes until it is melted as well.  I added cranberries to the almonds topped with celtic sea salt (this is so good, and cuts the sweet factor down), and also did a milk chocolate version with pistachios and diced dried apricots. I give this only 3* because, as written, it just isn't enough. But it's a very good place to start!

Not nearly enough shortening, turned out to nothing but a crumbly mess.  I saved the Crumbly mess to use as ice cream topping or to put in a cake or cake frosting.  I used butter and nestle morsels.  Chocolate would just not melt to a proper spreading viscosity.  I will try another recipe and see what happens.  Happy for you guys that it worked out for.  It will make a pretty topping to white cake icing.  All is not lost!!

I added toffee pieces for a salty/sweet bark. My family loved it!

Easy and SO good, I make this a lot because it's a hit!  I substitute butter for shortening and use a mix of semi sweet and Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips.  I microwave the chocolate & butter in a glass bowl and it turns out just fine which makes this even easier.  Don't skip toasting the almonds, it gives them such a good flavor - I throw a little salt on them too.
