Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and just about any type of bread can be used as long as it's toasted. I put a little kosher salt on my tomato along with a bit of pepper and added some minced garlic to the cream cheese.  I didn't have alfalfa sprouts so I used some fresh basil instead. I also used light cream cheese and light mozzarella.  You know it's done when the cheese is nice and bubbly!

I liked this, but it needed something, so the next time I spread mayo on the bread first (you have to use whipped cream cheese in that case, though, because the regular, even at room temp, sticks to the knife not the bread) and I spread mashed avocado over the cream cheese.  I liked jack cheese better than mozerella and thought it was better with the sprouts added last (after it came out of the oven) because warm sprouts didn't do it for me.  Without changes, four stars.  With changes, five.

First time I prepared these I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful!  Second time around I used tortillas instead of the bread, added an envelope to Ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese, added sliced cucmbers and rolled them up.  Just as good as the first time but with a little bit of a twist.

A most excellent sandwich indeed! After being on the road for several days of pizza and burgers, I wanted something healthy and simple. One bite and my digestive system sighed in relief! I followed the recipe exactly,pulling it out of the oven after 7 minutes (I was hungry). Simplicity at its best!

I replaced the cream cheese with a wedge of Light Original Swiss Flavored cheese by Laughing Cow. It tastes just like cream cheese and is extremely easy to spread. I also used a store bought salad dressing spritzer and lightly sprayed some Italian dressing over the vegetables (tomato and avocado slices, chives and sprouts) and gave it a few grinds of black pepper. Try it!

Very good sandwich.  I made it on Italian bread, because that is what I had on hand.  I think next time I will try it with flavored cream cheese (chives, gr. onions, garlic, etc.) to give it a little more zing.  I will use this recipe again.

Good stuff. I added a grind of black pepper, and a little drizzle of olive oil. I was out of red wine vinegar or I would have added a splash of that too. Thanks!

A very nice sandwich. I used a lot less alfalfa sprouts and cream cheese than called for - maybe 1/2 less? Anyway,it makes for a very decent, interesting lunch.

I liked this a lot. I used havarti cheese instead of mozzarella and took this to work in a whole wheat tortilla and then nuked in the microwave. i added the sprouts, tomatoes, some dill pickles and a bit on honey mustard. I'll make this again.

I added pastrami under my cream cheese and didn't have alfalfa sprouts, but put lettuce and avocado in it's place, on top of the mozzarella, after it had baked.  Mmmm!  Mmmm!  I was so full I could have exploded!

I made one sandwich just for me. I did add some spices to my cream cheese like garlic powder, onion powder, basil, oregano, a little dill weed and fresh ground pepper. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. I did not use the whole amount of cheese called for, just a sprinkling. I really enjoyed this. Very filling. Using a good whole wheat bread (like Dave's Killer Bread) is crucial as is adding spices to make the sandwich pop a little more. This is a great way to use up the dredges of what you have on hand before the big shopping day. I think this would be good with thinly sliced cucumber, too.

This really was an excellent sandwich! I really was not expecting it to taste quite as good as it did. I am a salt a holic and normally put extra salt on everything. This was perfect as is. I'm positive I will be making these again. Thanks

This wasn't really my favorite thing. I think maybe I'd try mayo instead of cream cheese. It just seemed way too cheesy.

The title of the recipe says everything.  I was out of sprouts,but I found the sandwhich did not need them to be excellent.  I also found it took closer to 15 minutes to get the cheese to begin to turn golden brown.  I have used it on bagles and english muffins, which were both excellent.

Loved this!  Adjusted to what I had on hand but basically the same recipe.  I used a thick slice of homemade potato bread and sprinkled a little garlic salt on the tomatoes.  Used a clover, cabbage, fennel sprout mix.  Baked until bubbly and oh so good!

Very nice sandwich!  Excellent indeed.  :o)  Like another reviewer, I used laughing cow spreadable cheese triangles--mostly bc I had them and I didn't have the time to soften my cream cheese.  Apparently bf doesn't like alfalfa sprouts, but he gobbled up his sandwich without too much complaint.  These are so easy, take only about 15 minutes total, and are a nice vegetarian sandwich for a quick weeknight meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This sandwich was pretty good but I think I put too much alfalfa sprouts and they took away from the flavor.  I would definitely recommend a splash of oil and some wine vinegar as well as some black pepper.

Warm sprouts were NASTY!!  Add sprouts to sandwiches AFTER you take them out of oven.  Use whipped cream cheese - much easier to spread. Add chicken or turkey to make it more filling.  Use provolone or cheddar cheese because it compliments the cream cheese better.  Add Italian dressing, aioli sauce or vinegar/oil to sandwich AFTER you take it out of oven for added zip!

Pretty good. I didn't use sprouts because they are one of the most commonly contaminated foods you can get, so I avoid them. I julienned cucumber instead and put that on top of the finished sandwich for some green crunch. I also used shredded Italian  blend instead of straight mozzarella because I think it has more flavour. Next time I would spread the toast with some Dijon mustard before spreading on the cream cheese to give the sandwich a little more oomph. Thanks!

I added mayo under the layer of whipped cream cheese. Didn't like the combo of flavors but some people might. It was okay. Really good for you but didn't throw a party in my mouth. However, I would make it again probably with a few alterations (to be determined).

It's definitely tasty, I would suggest used herb & garlic, or roasted red pepper flavored cream cheese. Cream cheese AND mozza.. NOT very healthy! drop the mozza and add sliced avocado, s & p.

Super yummy but very filling. I added chives to the cream cheese and avocado slices as well. I had it for breakfast!

Great treat! Adding a little salt, pepper, garlic and some basil just gives it that little extra umph. Delicious!

For dinner last night we had Experimental Sandwich Night, where I made a bunch of sandwiches from my AR recipe box that I'd saved over the years. This one was the winner! No sprouts, so I used cucumber and mixed baby greens. Not exactly a revolutionary combination of ingredients, but a satisfying dinner idea, nonetheless, easy and good on a summer night. I like the idea of adding a little ranch dressing to the cream cheese, and I also like the idea of adding avocado. Will try those next time! Thanks!

This was a very good, different sandwich.  I used Honey Wheat bread, a thin layer of cream cheese, and added sea salt and fresh ground pepper to the garden tomato.  Made an easy lunch with some homemade tomato soup and fresh fruit.  Thanks for posting a delicious idea, SAMSARAMON.

I loved this sandwich! So easy too! Only thing I did different was add avacados which I read about in other people's reviews and it was wonderful! Other things I thought about trying but didn't would be to maybe sprinkle some garlic salt on the cream cheese before I put the avacados on, will do that next time. Also, my sister didn't like the alfalfa so I told her she might try spinach leaves if she ever makes it!   Next time I will try the different ways and let everyone know how it turns out!  But I will DEFINITELY be fixing these again! YUMMY!!

These were quick and easy. I was looking for a way to use an extra loaf of italian bread so thats what I used. I did have to doctor it a little the first ones were too bland. I added garlic and a pinch of salt to the cream cheese and since my husband and two of my kids won't touch alfalfa I used green onions instead. I don't know about excellent but it was different and everyone enjoyed them.

Very tasty, but needed some extra spice or something. I took out the sprouts as I dont care for them & substituted avocado. Very easy also.

This sandwich was great!  It wasn't really heavy.  I used hoggie rolls because thats what I had on hand.  I also had some left over pesto in the fridge.  I spread some of that after the cream cheese.  I served this with a cup of soup and it was a perfect lunch for my husband and I.  I will totally make this again.

I tried this the way that the ingredients say, and it tasted great! I used to make something very very similar....instead of cheese on top, I used to put fresh slices of avocado...very tasty and extra healthy. Try it and see...you will love it!

I did like this recipe. I used Rye bread and flavoured cream cheese (herb & garlic) and it turned out quite well. It turned out to be like a lot of cheese to me, but I like cheese. I love tomatoes so next time I will add more tomatoes and more alfalfa sprouts.
