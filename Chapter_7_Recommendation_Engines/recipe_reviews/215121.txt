6 cups water would make this apricot juice.  
I used only 1 1/2 cups water with a little orange juice added.    I added 1 teaspoon vanilla near the end of the cooking process, not the beginning.

I thought the amount of water could be greatly reduced.  I put in 4 cups and it was still too much water.  I guess it depends on the size of your apricots.  I also used half honey and half sugar.

SIX cups of water??? NO WAY!! And what's up with the notion of "two drops" of vanilla?? I guessed using 2 cups of water, but even that was too much.
