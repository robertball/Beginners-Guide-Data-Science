As per other Posters, after preparing this cake I put saran wrap over the cake and put the pudding topping on the cake the next day.You can also put the pudding on the cake but be sure to put it in the Fridge. The 2nd, 3rd and even 4th day was even better. However, I very rarely have any left after the 1st day! It was simply awesome. All the flavors from the cake stay moist and the taste of the ricotta cheese was not overwhelming. I think this cake is better the next day and the 3rd day after making this cake. The key is letting the cake really set before serving. My kids loved this cake but hated the taste just after preparing it. I know we were anxious to taste it. Letting it sit in the fridge for 24 hours is worth the wait!

This is a great cake to make for a function the next day. I recommend not frosting the cake until the next day.  I sometimes add a little heavy cream. Part Milk/Part cream to the pudding mix.

Love it! I will make this again and again!

 I have made this 5 times and it has simply been a hit each time. I am making another one tonight for the Office tommorrow! Thank You! Thank You! Just Awesome! I have also posted a picture of the Cake too!

This is one of the BEST cakes I have ever made.  I was a little leary because the reviewers either loved or hated it...no in between.  I had to make dessert for the bosses birthday, and tried this.  She loved it, and so did the rest of my coworkers.  I did make it the day before and frost the day we served it.  The frosting in of iteself is delicious and I know I will use this on other desserts.  I was afraid that the ricotta mixture wouldn't sink, but it did.  It had beautiful presence and everyone was wowed.  Definately one of the moistest cakes to date.  Thanks for the post.

This is a richly delicious and impressive cake. Even though it got rave reviews from the people who ate it, I thought the ricotta cheese part was too wet.  Next time I will decrease the eggs to 3 instead of 4 and drain the excess liquid from the ricotta cheese before mixing.  The pudding/whipped topping icing tasted like chocolate mousse!  Yum!  Yum!  I will make this again.

This cake was very different and delicious ! I made it "light" by using fat-free ricotta, which worked out fine, and Lite Cool Whip and skim milk. The ricotta filling sinks to the middle of the cake as it bakes and makes a "layered" look like a devil dog. I baked the cake (in metal pan) at 350 for just under an hour and it came out perfect. I cooled it for 15 minutes, removed it from pan to a serving platter, covered it w/ Saran Wrap and refrigerated it over night to set before frosting it. (The bottom looked alittle "wet" from the filling sinking through the cake when I removed it from the pan, but, after refrigerating it it seemed to evaporate and just make the cake moister.....not soggy at all, which is what I worried about !!) The frosting is light and delicious like chocolate mousse. I decorated the cake after frosting it with chocolate chips, but I think shaved chocolate & white chocolate from a candy bar would look even better. I will mkae this again. It's easy and very quick and perfect for a special occasion without spending all day baking and preparing.

I made this recipe several times and found that the quality of the cake mix makes all the difference - some of them are just better-tasting than others (I personally liked Betty Crocker German Chocolate). At first I was concerned that the cake will not bake through, but during the baking ricotta layer sinks into the cake-mix layer and in fact the cake comes out with the chocolate layer on top. Once I made a half of the recipe in 8x8 form with about 3/4 of the ricotta and it also was good, just a bit dryer (which some might even prefer). Most of all I like the frosting idea and have even used it on other cakes and desserts. Thanks Rene!

I had it once years ago at Mike's Pastry in the North End of Boston and was never able to find it again, at Mike's or anywhere else!! I'm so grateful I found this recipe!!Made with Devils Food cake mix and pudding, half and half instead of milk and whole milk ricotta.  Loved it!  Definitely got better after a couple days.  I might try the lemon idea next. And for those who don't know (I didn't!), 2 pints is one of the BIG containers.

Cake was fabulous.  Big hit at the party I took it too.  I added mini chocolate chips to the top to give it a little bit of added sweetness.  I cooked it in a metal pan, I think I will use a glass pan next time, as it wasn't as moist as I would have liked it to be.

Very good, the ricotta layer sinks and divides the chocolate cake into two layers.  Its makes a great looking presentation.  Next time I'll use real cream in the icing.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It is my new favorite as a fancier birthday cake or party dessert.  I would recommend making it the night before you plan to eat it, though.  I made it the day of and the cream/pudding topping didn't have a chance to set as well as I would have liked.

I made this cake twice in one day. If you want your cake to look like the photos, do not use a 'pudding in the mix' cake mix (Pillsbury). The cake will taste fine and is very good, but the batter is too dense to rise through the ricotta. Being a curious customer, I had to try it again with a Duncan Hines mix, and it turned out perfectly. The cake fills a WHOLE 9x13 pan, so I added the frosting to each piece as I served it rather than end up with smashed frosting from storing it. The cake itself is not very sweet, but the textures are fantastic. We ate the first cake within a couple of days and froze the second. It thawed beautifully, and we're working on it now. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing! It's not too sweet or rich but looks like it would be! I made this for Christmas dinner at my in-laws. I wanted something new and Since they had lived in Italy for 3 years thought this might be something they'd enjoy. They LOVED it! I took someones advice and made the cake part 24 hours before I needed it and then put it in the fridge to "rest." I then made the chocolate mousse topping the next day and had everyone add their own amount to their piece. It was perfect and moist and the chocolate mousse topping was just the perfect amount of sweetness to add! This is one I will be making again and again! I've already passed on the recipe to the in-laws!

Ok...so my friend made this and I fell in love with this recipe....although it was a little different....I just made this last night with a few changes....I used yellow cake mix...upeed the sugar to 1c. and also added about 3/4 of a bag of mini chocolate chips...dusted the cooked cake with confect. sugar instead of the pudding frosting. This is excellent....reminds me of a cannoli and cake together....will try with the chocolate cake next time....but I personally think that the mini chips really make the cheese filling. Thanks!

Bland, it just lacks a lot for everything you put into it.  I didn't have a problem with soggy, but it was dry.  I cooked it in a metal 9x13 and where the directions say 90 min, thankfully I took it out at 70 min.  
I did let it set a full 24 hours before making the topping and serving it.  As for the topping... not good, just bland yet again (and not remotely close to mousse), you might as well buy the chocolate flavor cool whip, save time, money, and a dish to clean.

This was a very good tasting cake. I had no problem getting the white layer to sink, just pour from a few inches higher. A+ & we're picky about chocolate cake.

This cake was good but it was missing a bit of a kick. I made this cake 2 times one was the recipe and the second one I added a bit of vermute in the ricotta mixture and it came out AWSOME. I added a teaspoon just to give it an extra kick. My hubby enjoyed it so much he wants me to make it for Father's day. Thanks for the recipe...

Fantastic!  Can't believe how good this is and so EASY!  I used Grande brand Sopraffina super fine style ricotta and dark choc fudge cake mix. I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 3 eggs in the cheese mixture.   The frosting is delicious but the cake is yummy without it too.  FYI ---  2 pints = 4 cups.

Made the filling with 3 eggs, used 1 and 1/2 pints ricotta and 8 oz cream cheese, used almond extract in place of vanilla. Replaced the water in the cake mix with espresso. Baking time given for metal pan is 90 minutes. that's way too long, cake was overdone at 60 minutes, not burned, but very dry corners. The  ricotta filling  did not sink, stayed on top of the cake, but  as it gets covered by the pudding/whipped topping frosting, it  now looks like a  beautiful 3 decker cake.  Next time, divide the cake batter : half in the pan, followed with the ricotta filling, then top off with the other half of the batter.  Unlike everyone else, I tasted this after it had cooled for 30 minutes and thought it was good.

Everyone at the party LOVED this cake and asked for the recipe.  I did as other reviewers suggested and made the cake the day before then iced it an hour before the party and put it back in the fridge. I used powdered sugar in the ricotta filling and doubled the amount as others suggested it wasn't sweet enough. I had extra large eggs so I only used 3 in the filling. The filling sunk into the cake nicely and I baked it for 60 minutes in a metal pan.  Perfect!  I also used 16 oz of whipped topping since I didn't want to have extra in the fridge.  I will make this MANY more times.  YUMMY!!

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this cake was. I'm not a big fan of cakes in general; however  the different layers of texture and flavor from the ricotta and the topping and the moistness of the cake won me over. The best part, it's so easy to make.  I followed the recipe fairly closely. I did use whole milk ricotta instead of skim and used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of light cream to make the pudding for the topping. I then baked it on 350 for about 30 minutes then turned it down to 325 for another 30 minutes.  As other reviewers suggested, I then covered the cake and refrigerated it overnight. I added the topping the next afternoon, and refrigerated it again for about 6 hours before serving. It got rave reviews from everyone at the dinner party!

I have been making this recipe for years.  It's always a huge hit and comes off as an elegant dessert that takes very little time to make even though people think you fussed.  I make mine in a foil lasagna pan (the higher one, not the short sided ones) and I usually end up using a 16 oz. cool whip (doesn't affect the flavor at all) and I put the extra frosting in dessert dishes as it's alot like chocolate mousse and is a great dessert all by itself. I make mine the night before and frost it the next day, I also sprinkle the frosted cake w/chocolate jimmies for an even prettier looking cake. If you get the foil pans that come w/the clear plastic lids, I find they work best as they don't come in contact w/the frosting. Delicious is all I can say!

Delicious! Not too sweet, which is a big part of a successful dessert to me. Used devils food cake, no changes to recipe. But I will say I was smelling burning of the cake. It bakes quite a long time, which concerned me. When I checked on it when I smelled burning, it was quite done on the sides but middle not even close. Closed oven and said a prayer. Worked out fine. Cooled and the placed in fridge.  Next day, made up "frosting" put on cake and shaved chocolate curls on. Looked pretty. Brought to a friends for dinner.  They all LOVED IT! I highly recommend this cake.

I made this cake 2 days ago and its gone. I however tasted it yesterday and it didn't taste the same as  it did today. The cake sitting for 24 hours made a huge difference. I used choc fudge cake and choc fudge pudding mix. I wish that the ricotta layer was a bit sweeter... next time I will add more sugar.

I was very disappointed with this cake. The ricotta layer is boring and flavorless. I was not expecting it to be so tasteless.  The next day the cake got very moist almost to the point of soggy. No one ate any of this. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the frosting. I really liked that and will use it again. But this cake is not something I recommend and will be deleted from my recipe box. And that is rare for me.

It's okay, but there's nothing special about it.  Also, my cheese didn't sink, but it ended up being fine that way--I had baked it in two round pans...so when I stacked them on top of each other, I had a beautiful marbled appearance.  I also put it on a glass pedestal and decorated it with violets and cherry blossoms, so presentation was paramount for me. (See the uploaded pictures of my cake.)

Well the first time I made this it was Great but that was several years ago when you could get an 18.25oz cake mix. I made this now and used the right amount of ricotta cheese but cake mix had hard time covering bottom of 13x9 inch pan because boxes now are 16.5. The result was cake was done 15 minutes faster than it should have been and it did not cover all the ricotta cheese. Now that everything is coming smaller with less in them then recipes won't come out right with mixes with less amount. Sad with today economy. I chose 5 star rating because when I first made this cake it was great it's just now measures are not right with today's packaging.

I was really hoping that since this cake has gotten some great reviews that we would love it, however, my family, who are big into sweets mind you, wouldn't eat it. I personally did not think the ricotta cheese filling was sweet enough and I couldn't get past it's texture. Oh well...win some you lose some.

This is kinda a "hmmmmm...?" for me.  I followed recipe exactly except subbed cold coffee for the water in my cake mix.  I read in the reviews to pour the cheese filling from quite high above so that it would sink into the cake batter -that did not seem to work for me. Some of it sank, some stayed on top.  The cheese filling that stayed on top cracked open during baking like a cheese cake so my unfrosted cake was pretty funny looking.  The baking time is off, for my oven anyway, which is usually pretty spot on. I baked it in a glass dish & checked after 1 hr and it was a tad overdone with the edges starting to dry out.  The mousse topping is wonderful, the cheese filling is good, but could use a little more sugar I think.  Overall its a nice cake, but not sure if I'll make again.

I gave this one 5 stars based on the reactions I got from everyone who tried it.  The thing most people liked was that it wasn't overly sweet.  I personally thought that the ricotta mix could have been sweeter, but it was still very good and everybody who tried it loved it.  I used DH dark chocolate cake mix and like other reviewers suggested, upped the sugar to about 1 1/4 Cups and used about 1 1/2 teaspoons Almond extract instead of vanilla.  I left the cake in the 9 X 13 pan and covered with foil and put in the fridge for about 16 hours.  Cake set perfectly and came out of the pan with no problems.  It should be noted that the recipe makes a ton of the icing.  I didn't put on an overly thick layer and had enough left over for probably another half of a cake.  I also decided to make mine soud a little more classy by calling it "Torta di Amore"

Made this cake for an italian homemade dinner for my in-laws yesterday. They loved it! Some helpful hints:

- Use Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge Cake mix (15 oz box) (Betty Crocker mixes have pudding mixed in and some ppl said their ricotta mixture didn't switch to the middle like it should and this could be the reason. It's sooo rich!

- I increased the sugar in the ricotta mixture to 1 cup. You can even make half the ricotta mixture as 2 lbs. ricotta is a bit much.

- It was done in 50 mins and I baked it in a dark metal pan.

Definitely making it again :)

I have served this at many functions and it is always a hit. A group of ladies came to my house recently and everyone just raved at how moist it was. I didn't think it was soggy in the least. I love the moistness of this luscious dessert.

Pretty good... something different from the norm, not too sweet. It looked quite odd coming out of the oven -- the sides raised up and over the middle, and it was crazy lumpy. Good thing the top layer covers all flaws. Anxious to see if it's better tomorrow... this was just okay.

This was by far one of the best cakes I have ever had.  I made it for my mother inlaw and my boss's birthdays this week and they were both amazed by it.  (my boss is a baker!)  I made the first cake with Pillsbury (we use it at work) and then read the rest of the reviews while it was in the oven and found out NOT to use it because of the pudding in the mix.  I then called my husband and had him get me Duncan Hines and made the 2nd one with it and it turned out perfect.  Granted, they tasted the same, but the Pillsbury didn't set the way the Duncan did.  I am fortunate enough to work in a bakery and have access to cake boards and plastic collars to make "decorating" it easier.  Since the cake rose real high in the pan, I couldn't really put the mousse on top of it so I put the collar around the cake and was able to do it that way.  Sorry for the long review!  Amazing recipe, will definitely use again and already have requests for upcoming bdays and anniversary's!

Yum, this was very good! I used DH Devils Food mix and made sure to buy a good quality ricotta, opting for regular and not part skim. This had a nice rich flavor and I'll use definitely make this again.

This is a perfect recipe for making something quick, yet elegant.  I accidentally made a change to the topping..... I only used pudding mix and cool whip (accidentally skipped the milk).  It turned out great...was almost like a FUDGE topping.  Also, I used applesauce instead of oil for the cake mix and it turned out very moist. so good!

Great cake but be sure to mix the ricotta in pretty good or the edges will not be as moist as the rest of the cake.  Very good cake though!  I was a bit unsure about it at first, having ricotta cheese in it and having to cook it so long, but worked out very good!

I would've added more sugar to the ricotta cheese because that layer was just kind of bland.

I have made this several times, I used 1/2 cup buttermilk and 3//4 water when I made the cake mix sometimes I will use sour cream. 

Everyone always loves this cake !! Thank you for sharing !

Made just like the recipe said--it was a beautiful dessert, very impressive. The taste was just so-so. I used a chocolate fudge Betty Crocker mix, but it just didn't have alot of flavor. I'm going to give most of it to my daughter and son-in-law--he'll eat anything!

i gave it full stars even though mine didn't turn out well since it was my own rookie mistake.  thought i could run cottage cheese through the food processor and substitute for ricotta like i often do with lasagna.  didn't work the same in a cake recipe though!  cake turned out an odd spongy consistency- it was okay, still cake afterall, but not great.

This is a wonderful and easy cake.  I used 2 eggs instead of 4 in the ricotta and it is wonderful.  Wrapping the cooled cake in plastic wrap overnight does make a good difference.  I made a cream cheese chocolate and hazelnut frosting.  It is really rich and impressive, but so easy!  Everyone loves this cake.

This is an awesome cake. When I look at the picture here, I wonder how you get your frosting to stay so firm. Mine kind of glops over, but it is still delicious. The ONLY thing I changed was I added pink food coloring to the ricotta mixture. That way, it looks more like love (sigh).

In the words of my son "OHHHHH-EMMMMMM-GEEEEE!"  This cake is my far my favorite...ever!  I don't even want to look at the Nutrition Facts!  Anyway....I made this with a marble cake because I am not a HUGE chocolate fan, other than that, I followed the directions exactly, and this cake is to die for!  I have had it before, but it's been a while, and I had lost the recipe!  So glad I found it here!  Thanks!

I recently made this cake for my daycare staff.  We had a celebration for two year anniversary!  It was a HUGE hit and my girls are fussy!!  I changed absolutely nothing!  However I should have changed how much I made because everyone wanted to eat some AND take some home with them!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Valentines Day.  It turned out great! Very glad I read the reviews to make a day ahead! I cannot stress it enough! Make it the day before!!  I could agree with others that the ricotta layer could be a bit sweeter, but it was wonderful when eating "straight down" (all three layers)  I won't change a thing next time I make it. Hope you enjoy as well!

The mascarpone filling needs a little something "more."  Next time I'll try adding some canelloni-like ingredients to it like mini chocolate chips.

Made this for a family dinner and it was fabulous!  I used Chocolate Cool-Whip Dips spread on top of the cake.  This is a very moist and yummy cake. An update:  I failed to mention the ingredient that takes this recipe from so-so to fabulous is replacing the vanilla with almond extract. It really does take this recipe over the top!

I made this cake yesterday.  Four adults and one child ate the cake.  The adults all agreed that it was one of the most mediocre cakes that we have ever tasted.  Not sure how so many delicious ingredients combine to be so boring.  Three of us didn't even finish our piece of cake.  For some reason, none of the flavors in the cake are strong enough to be reallly delicious.  We were all trying to analyze the problem.  We all uniformly agreed that the chocolate cake didn't seem chocolaty enough.  We agreed that the best part of the cake was the topping and that the cake was moist enough but not flavorful enough.

This was OK not bad, but not great.  If I make this again, I will definitely use a 15 in pan I didn't really get 3 layers, there wasn't enough room in my pan for the cake to do it's thing.  Mine looked more like a marble cake.

This recipe, followed to the tee, was not impressive. I was expecting a rich, flavorful cake, and what I served was a light, not that sweet, wierd textured cake. I didn't get very many compliments....I will not be serving this to my friends or family again.

This was not my cup of tea but if you don't like your cake sweet, then you would like this. It is pretty easy to make but the cooking time listed on the recipe is too long.  I used a glass baking dish and the cake came out dry. I would recommend lowering it from 75 minutes to 60.

I was not happy with the results. The cheese mixture which did go to the bottom was very wet. The Chocolate cake was baked completely. 
I will not make this again. I took it to a gathering and it was not a favorite.
Sorry.

For the ingredients involved, this should have been much better.  Maybe it was the fact that I used fat-free ricotta, which made the center kinda dry and not as creamy as I had hoped.  It seemed to lack flavor and richness.  Okay, but I won't repeat this again.

I have made this 2 times so far and both times it has turned out great. When I went shopping for the ingredients the first time I didn't read my list very well and I only bought 1 15oz container of ricotta cheese and didn't have time to go back to the store so I used what I had, I made it the same way the second time and I received nothing but excellent reviews from everyone who tried it, although when some people heard that there was ricotta cheese in it they were a little leary to try it, but when they did, they really liked it.

This cake is absolutely wonderful..not too overly sweet, just right. I had it at my cousins at Christmas and everyone was begging for the recipe. THE only DIFFERENCE was that she used a FUDGE MARBLE CAKE MIX instead of all chocolate. I have one cooling in my fridge right now to take to a church New Years party. I do think the marble is better and looks neater than all chocolate.

I served this cake to two of my friends, and both said it was a winner. I agree.
It was the first cake i've made in years, and I was proud to say I baked it. It was so easy to make, and it came out so moist. The ricitta cheese really makes this cake.
I baked it it a springform pan, and that way I could frost the whole cake, top and sides. I also addes one half teaspoon almond extract, I like the combination of vanilla and almond flavors.
Great recipe, i'd recommend it to all, especially those who are just starting out at baking cakes. I'd love to know where you got the recipe, let us know.

I made this exactly as written except for the baking time. Mine was done by 60 minutes using a glass baking dish. 75 minutes is way too long. I didn't top mine with the pudding frosting because I thought it would be too sweet. I just added a dollop of whipped topping to each piece as I served it. I wish the sweetened ricotta layer had more flavor. I think I'll use almond extract next time and some shredded coconut to turn this into an 'Almond Joy Love Cake'. And I agree with the other reviewers, this tastes much better after it chills in the fridge overnight. I tasted it warm and it was not as good. It also becomes more moist after it's refrigerated. A fun recipe!

I have yet to find someone who didn't rave about this cake. Even those that "aren't cake people" love it! (Seriously, who isn't a "cake person" though...) I use the "extreme chocolate cake recipe" (which yields a very thin batter, so it switches layers very well). I recommend using part skim ricotta, it has a more mild flavor. Please don't use cool whip... just whip your own whipping cream, and add dry pudding powder! Way easier and makes a more firm topping. Then you can make it into a beautiful layer cake! I made an enormous cross cake for my son's baptism, chocolate pudding mix for the inside between layers and frosted the outside using vanilla pudding, so it was white - beautiful and delicious!

Way too long to cook. Very dry. Ricotta did not sink. I even made it the day before. I was thankful that everyone had so much dinner they were too full for dessert. Would have been very embarrassing. Very bland.

I too increased the sugar in the ricotta mixture (to 1 1/4 cups) and I used Dunkin Hines dark chocolate cake.  It came out great.  I didn't even think it needed the cool whip layer (but that was good all by itself!)

This cake was good, not great. The topping was great and I will use that again. I think the ricotta cheese could have been sweeter. I also think 75 minutes was too long in my oven, next time I will check it earlier. It just needed something.

My husband had a modified version of this cake at an office party and wanted me to make it the same way. I used a marble cake mix, vanilla pudding and whipping cream instead of cool whip. Definitely wait at least 24 hours before eating to let the ricotta settle and soak into the cake. Its a very moist, decadent cake that would be great for any occasion. Next time I'll be using chocolate!

My cake turned out just like the photo! This is so easy to make and well worth the effort. I used Duncan Hines devil's food cake mix and part skim ricotta cheese. I covered and refrigerated the unfrosted cake overnight adding the topping just before serving. The slices came out perfectly. The cake could be dressed up with chocolate curls, sliced strawberries or raspberries. This was a big hit with us.

What can I say about Italian Love Cake. I use a Devils Food cake mix and followqed recipe exactly.Very moist. I ran out of oil and used melted butter, I think that made it richer if thats possible. I followed other rewiewers and put frosting on next day.  So good I can't wait until this on i gone so I can make it again.

I made this cake for a farewell party, even though someone else was bringing dessert.   It was awesome and will be one of my favorites.  I have passed the recipe on to family and friends who went crazy over it.  I brought the last 1/3 of the leftover cake (after 3 days) to work and it was gone in less than 45 min.  I made the cake on a Friday, took the left-overs to work on Monday and was expecting it to taste "left-over" but it's true, it was even better.  The icing stayed creamy and the texture of the cake remained moist but no runny or stale tasting.  The only change I made was I used 2 boxes of the chocolate pudding, 2 cups of milk and added one small contained whpped topping.  I cooled the cake completely (to avoid the cake falling apart) and iced the entire cake.I am going to try it with chocolate cake this weekend! I am also considering trying it will yellow cake and instead of chocolate pudding, will use lemon pudding for a "lemony cheesecake" creation.  Will keep you posted! It is much easier than cheesecake and was just as good if not better!   Thanks to the creator of this one!

I made this cake for a food day at my school.  I was a little worried about making something that I have never tried before.  The cake turned out great.  The frosting is my favorite part.  The only thing is that if you eat the ricotta cheese part of the cake by itself, it tastes a little different and may take some getting used to.  Make sure that you eat it with both the frosting and the chocolate cake.  I made the cake the night before.  I also made the pudding the night before so that I could make the frosting in the morning and it would be really cold and not melt while I was transporting it.  This worked out great.

Delicious. The cheese unexpectedly settled at the bottom of the cake, giving it a crust on the bottom, a layer of cheese, then cake, then the frosting. Beautiful cake, all my friends were raving about this one.

Myself and my family loved this cake.  I made it for Valentines Day and it was a hit.  Very big cake. We had leftovers for days, but no one minded.  I made it a day ahead and iced it the day I served it.  I used a dark chocolate cake mix and it was delish!  The only problem I had was that the Ricotta mixture did not sink under the cake in the middle so we had a large section where the ricotta was on top.  The cake was moist, but not wet at all. I'm putting this one in my recipe box and will make over and over.

This was pretty good, I liked that it wasnt too sweet. I used fat free cool whip, fat free ricotta, skim milk and egg beaters for half the eggs(used 2 real eggs)I also only used about 3/4 the container of ricotta and cut down on the sugar and 1 less egg to compensate, the whole amount would have never fit in my pan. I baked mine in a glass 9x13 pan and it puffed way up, only took about 50min.  I only used an 8oz cont. cool whip, 12oz would've been too much topping for my pan.

This cake was so great.  I made it the night before and frosted the morning of the party.  I used a little almond extract which really added pizazz.  The cake was very moist.  Thank you! This is being added to the family favorites.

This cake was okay, but I was really dissapointed with this cake, after all the other wonderful reviews.  I think I was expecting the cheese layer to be more like cream cheese than ricotta cheese.  The kids didn't like it much either.

I didn't care for this one.  The ricotta cheese takes away from the sweetness of the cake, plus it gave it a strange texture.

I made this for a birthday at work. I followed the suggestions and made it the day before, and frosted it before going to work. Everyone LOVED it. I also exchanged the coffee for the water in the cake mix, as well as increased the sugar a little. It was perfect. This will be my go to cake again and again! Thanks!

I made this for a friends birthday....I never got to try it. I made it in a large springform pan.....took a long time to cook. Would cook it in 9 x 13 next time. The only comment my friend said about the cake was that she liked the icing and chocolate part...but thought the white part tasted funny.

I actually found this on pinterest first but I checked and the recipes are the same.  I gave this a try last weekend for our wine tasting get away trip and it was a big hit!  I never modify baking instructions so I followed this pretty precisely.  Good balance between cheese, cake, and the whipped pudding frosting.  Our crew gave it two thumbs up!

I make this cake as is. Once in a while I do not put the whip cream topping. What I use is confectionary sugar instead. My family loves it both ways!!

This is an update of my last review.  I wanted to add I used 2 tsp. vanilla to my last review.  I just mixed this cake for the 4th time.  The cake mix batter looked a little skimpy.  I used Duncan Hines mix.  I put cake in oven and looked at empty cake mix box it said the box was 16.5 ounces.  This recipie calls for a 18 plus ounce cake mix.  I hope it comes out ok.

Taste and texture was just okay. I made mine in a metal 9x13. Baked for 75 minutes. The topping was pretty yummy. I did not spread it over the cake but placed a nice sized dollap on each piece as I served it. Since the taste was somewhat bland and the over all effect was just okay I would not make this cake again simply because of the cost of the ingredients. Far too expensive ingredients for a mediocre dessert. The topping I will make again.

I did not care for this recipe. It was very plain and dry, with little flavor. You have to let it cook forever and it is very dry when you take it out.

Made exactly as stated in recipe. The cake part was dry, the white cheese filling too salty, and overall lacked "depth" of flavor. It was improved after 2-3 days of chilling, but still not worth making again.

If using "pyrex" glass pan,cake & cheese mix will fill pan when cooked leaving no room for topping. If u make this, do NOT eat it warm as it's at its worst then. Much better cold. Also, the ricotta mix needs more sugar. It's gone from my recipe box.

Made as written. I think the cake was dry & it didnt seem to make much difference in the flavor with the Ricotta. I will try again only sweeten up the Ricotta and cook for 10-15 Minutes less. The frosting is really good, tastes like Chocolate Ice Cream.

I followed the advice of a previous person and used yellow cake mix and added mini choco chips to the ricotta. I made it this way because my Italian Mother In Law & my husband aren't big on chocolate. They thought it was very good! I will try it another time using marble or chocolate cake mix. This one is a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Was so looking forward to this cake (because of the great reviews) that i served it without test-driving it. Big mistake. I made it the day before Christmas (Of all days!) with good quality ingredients, waited til the following day to frost as recommended and was sadly disappointed. It was dry and just... blah. Couldn't give it away so i ended up bringing the thing home. Tried it again the following day and it wasn't any better. Thank goodness I'd also made the bavarian apple torte from this site which was the best!

I loved this cake! I had to make something for my work Christmas party, and it had to be Italian. I was weary with this recepie because like another reviewer, people either loved it or hated it. Well, I just tried a piece to make sure it was cooked all the way through, and I love it! I cooked it for 75 minutes in the glass pan, and the top was a little burned, but otherwise ok. I used DH Devil's Food for the cake, and it turned out moist and delicious, so I have no idea why some people got dry cake. I used A LOT less whipped topping because I didn't want to have heaps of "frosting" on top, and it turned out just fine (maybe 4-6 ounces instead of 12). I also used fat free milk which seems just fine (it was all I had in the house.) I would recommend adding two teaspoons of vanilla instead of one, the ricotta can be overpowering. Like the picture, my cake also formed a little crust on the bottom with the ricotta sitting nicely on top. I will be making this one again for sure!

This is an awesome cake! We've been making it for years and everyone loves it. I've also done it with yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding with equally delicious results. :)

Totally delicious!!! As many of the other reviews suggest I recommend using a larger pan than the 9x13 the recipe suggests. I sprinkled the top with mini chocolate chips. All around SUPER delicious and easy!

I will be an optimist I made this tonight disappointed that my ricotta didn't sink but then I read a post that said to use a duncan hines cake one without pudding I will try again I hope it tastes good for my group tomorrow night. I also thought possible it was to much ricotta or if it was to heavy to fall... I was right I have made this cake in just a couple of days the second time it turned out just like the picture make sure you use a cake mix without pudding that was the trick .... I also top mine with homemade whipped cream

I made the cake 1 day ahead (per other posters)wrapped in saran wrap and put in refrig. Was a little nervous about the long cooking time, cooked for 70 minutes but I think next time will cook for 60 minutes ( it was fine at 70 minutes).It wasn't dry  but it is not a sweet cake either. I think the quality of the chocolate cake mix could break or make the recipe. The frosting I didn't care for as much, I used a large box of pudding to the same proportion of cool whip. Not chocolate enough for my taste so I added some Hershey chocolate syrup by the spoonful until I got the taste I wanted.My family  takes instant chocolate pudding powder and we dump it into heavy cream and beat it,this frosting is more like a mousse (not too sweet either) consistency then the above recipe.FYI "our" frosting we like on angels food cake!

This cake came out to be wonderful! Followed all the directions to the mark! Baked for 60 minutes only and came out great! I put the mousse-like topping on and let the whole cake sit overnight. I had everyone try a piece later the next night and it was soooo moist and delicous...not too sweet but not dull just right!!!! Will make again!!!!!

I made this the first time exactly as the recipe states, and it was amazing! Then I made a variation of it for my sister who's allergic to chocolate - I used strawberry cake mix and white chocolate jello pudding mix.  It was a hit!

Delicious, did use 2 pkgs. of pudding in the Cool Whip for the frosting. Much better 2-3 days after making. I wasn't sure if you were suppose to take it out of the pan and didn't want to take a chance so I left it in the pan. Does any one know if it comes out of the pan easily when inverting? Would appreciate your help.

You might as well leave out the ricotta mixture and save time and money. The whipped topping/pudding mixture would be just as good on the boxed cake mix. The cake was dry and not at all exciting.

This was a great recipe.  I was looking for something different for an international potluck and didn't have much time to make something.
The cake was moist because I read the reviews and some people who cooked their cake following the exact recipe said their cake was dry.  I took mine out a little bit earlier.  I just watched to see when the sides began pulling away from the pan, then checked it with a toothpick to make sure it came out clean.  Also I liked that it was not overwhelmingly sweet.  Everyone loved the cake and actually a few days later one of the girls asked for the recipe.  I thought this was a great success!

This was pretty good. I used other suggestions and made it a day ahead of time. Good idea. It only better over the next couple of days. I used a metal bake pan and baked it 90 minutes. I think this was about 8 to 10 minutes too long. The corners were tough. I cut away from the corners and did not serve those. Everyone said it had a good taste. I was expecting something awsome but it was just OK. I will make again in April for a birthday party. Thanks for sharing.

Sorry, but I will not be making this again. I did as others had suggested and waited 24 hours to frost it. The frosting itself was not very chocolatey...I think it would've worked better with a smaller container of whipped topping. The cake came very close to running over the side when baking, even though I used a 9x13" pan as suggested. I think 75 minutes was too long; the crust has a rather bitter, burned taste to it (even though it doesn't look burned) and it's not as moist as I thought it was going to be, considering it has all that ricotta cheese in it. It just didn't have the chocolate flavor that I expected. I have way too many FANTASTIC chocolate cake recipes to choose from in my collection to ever make this again.

I made this on Christmas Eve, it was gone in 15min. The frosting is light, not to rich which is perfect because of the chocolate cake to much chocolate can be overkill.

Awesome cake, I've had it before my mother-in-law makes it.  I don't know if it is the exact same recipe but i do know that it is fantastic.  Best thing to have for desert too, not too sweet-  best thing for after a nice meal.

I followed this recipe exactly. I was so disappointed in it. Oven was at 350 before I even put it in and it still wasn't done in 90 minutes.  Well, the top sprang back up when touched, so I THOUGHT it was done.  However I couldn't get it out of the pan. The bottom was like a wet glue. I love moist cake and that's one reason I tried this recipe. Sorry, but I also thought it had an aftertaste. Will not make again--an expensive dessert with little rewards.  My 36 year old son took one bite and said, "what is in this?"

Thank you so much for a great recipe.  It was so easy to make and so delicious, even better the second day.  My picky brother who never likes anything can’t stop raving about the frosting being the best he has ever tasted.  I will definitely be making this cake again.

Since my daughter is NOT a fan of chocolate, I used STRAWBERRY cake mix, and vanilla pudding with strawberry coolwhip, I added a drop of red food coloring and she LOVED it. It was an instant hit with her friends for their Princess Party.

Cook time freaked me out.  Bought Apple Pie as backup.  Didn't need it - this cake was i-n-h-a-l-e-d!  I'll try cream in place of the milk next time...or mayby make the whipped cream myself.  Other than that - this is a heirloom recipe!
Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe!!  I run a large retirement community for seniors and once a month we have a bake sale and bake competition.  Normally, I just bring cookies --boring-- then I found this recipe- I should have made 3 cakes- and I won the competition!  My seniors ate this cake like it was going out of style!

WOW!!! This is GREAT! So easy to make and so good.  The ricotta cheese is not too rich and a perfect addition.  The frosting is an amazing idea! Not too sugary and so versatile.  I could see using it on many different cakes and pies. I used non fat milk and light whipped topping and you would never know!  Everyone raved about the cake, ate all of it and asked for the recipe, what more could you ask for.  Thank you Rene for a truly wonderful cake recipe!

I made this for a dinner party and I cannot tell you how much everyone loved it!  It is certainly a cake that looks a lot harder to make than it really is.  The only thing I changed was I used fresh whipping cream instead of the cool whip.

This cake is absolutely beautiful in presentation!  The flavor is unexpected, not sweet at all.  You really can't taste the cheese.  Make sure cake is completely cool before frosting w/CoolWhip and Pudding.  Will make again.  This is a "chick" cake.  Ginny

I’ve been making this cake for years! I’ve made it with all different variations white cake chocolate topping chocolate cake vanilla topping.. today I try something completely different.. i used lemon cake like another person suggested and I added some lemon zest to the ricotta mix, and I put a handful of fresh blueberries in the cake mix.. I’m having company tonight so I hope It comes out as spectacular as it usually does!

I just made this cake for a dinner party that I had and it was a hit! Two people had to have seconds and the best part no plate had left overs ... It was easy, made a great presentation especially with a large fresh strawberry on top, sliced with chocolate shavings. Everyone thought I slaved over it... thanks for the great recipe ; )

I rated this as just average based upon both expectations and the quality and cost of the ingredients.  While the cake came out exactly as the picture on the website the taste was rather blah with no distinguishing flavors.  I was expecting a cake like cannoli dessert.  The topping lacked much of a chocolate flavor either.

This cake is great is you do not like things that are super sweet. I followed suggestions and used a cake mix WITHOUT pudding in the mix. Everything came out spectacular. My Italian boyfriend and his father loved it!

The only good thing about this cake was the pudding and whipped cream frosting. It was terrible I threw it away... don’t waist your time or money making it. Sorry but this was a total dud.

This cake was very easy to make and everyone raved. I made a couple of minor modifications. I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the cheese mixture, just cause I love almonds, and 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder to the topping mixture to deepen the chocolate flavor.  It also kept it from being too sweet. I can’t wait to make it again. Next time I may add espresso powder because it reminds me of tiramisu.

Easy, delicious, and not overly sweet.  I substituted with fudge marble cake mix, then followed the recipe as written.  My cake rose so high that I was unable to spread it with the topping while in the pan.  Rather, I topped each cut piece, then sprinkled with shaved milk chocolate.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

This cake was amazing!  It was not overly sweet and the frosting was light and fluffy.  I followed the directions as originally written but checked to see if it was baked completely after only 60 minutes since other reviews said that was what to expect for baking time. My cake was definitely done after 60 minutes as well.  No one could believe that it was ricotta cheese in the bottom.  Thanks so much for sharing this dessert!

I did this cake for Thanksgiving and was a big hit. I baked this in a 9x13 and had no room for the topping so it was added at serving time.. The big difference to my version was I used real whipped cream. 2C heavy whipping cream, 1/3 C powdered surgar , and a 3 oz chocolate pudding mix and thinned the mixture with 1/4 C of milk to desired consistency.  The whipping cream sets up very quickly once the pudding is added in the mixer. Will make again.

I should not have cooked it the amount of time it said, got a little too done, will know next time to reduce the time, but it was still very good. I also put the topping on the next day.

I made this cake for a fund-raising event and had the privilege to bring the leftovers home.  As the other reviews said, it is SO MUCH better a day, or two, after. We're having a longtime friend over for dinner this weekend, so I'll be making this Friday night to serve Saturday.

I had two heart shaped pans so I thought to make this as a layered cake. It looked great especially when sliced with the Layers but I would use a 9x13 when I make it again.  I couldn't get a nice high layer on the top of the smaller surface. I think this cake needs a thicker layer of the pudding-whipped topping mix to counter the more dense cake cheese center.

Oh My YUMMMM!!! Super easy, really tasty!!  I did not bake it for 90 minutes tho, the cake tested at 70 minutes was perfect and I used a metal pan.  If left in for the additional time it would have definitely been ruined.  This cake is AMAZING!!!

I am not a baker, but I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! It is easy to make, turns out with a light texture, and is absolutely delicious. My suggestions - if you are a dark chocolate lover like me, use the darkest cake mix and pudding mix you can find. Next time I will add a little sweetener to the ricotta mixture, but not too much. It did not take as long to bake as the recipe says, so keep an eye on it. The chocolate whipped cream frosting using pudding for the chocolate is pure genius; I have had other chocolate whipped cream that just didn't have enough flavor to make it worthwhile, but this was excellent. Try not to use Cool Whip in it, it contains hydrogenated fats, trans fats and high fructose corn syrup - yuck! I found one called Truwhip that doesn't contain any of those.

I have made this cake twice. The first time is was perfect the second time it didn't cook quite right but it was still good. The difference between the first and second time of making it was that I decreased the 4 eggs to 3 the first time I made it and it was perfect. The second time I used the 4 eggs that it calls for and the white layer did not sink to the bottom as it is supposed to. If the cake is done right the white cheese layer will sink to the bottom and the chocolate cake layer will fold around it and it will look like a plain chocolate cake until you cut into it. I also found that this cake tasted better after being in the fridge over night or for a whole day before serving. Good luck. It's  a delicious cake!! Reminds me of my Italian grandmother's house.

This cake was so good!!!! Loved Loved Loved it! It did not turn out 100% perfectly part of the chocolate cake  flipped but once I covered it with the chocolate whipped cream you could not see and it was wonderful and moist. I did use fresh organic cream from a local farm instead of cool whip, but that was just because I don't like cool whip. I will be making this again. It does get better the next day.

Made as directed the day before a cookout; put the frosting on when cooled--didn't hear any rave reviews.  I ended up with 3 layers instead of 4, but I may have been heavy-handed when spreading the cheese filling. I wish I had started checking the cake after 60 minutes--it didn't taste burnt but looked dark and overcooked at 70 minutes in a glass pan. Three days after it tastes better than it did the day after baking--tastes like a good cake roll now which would be less trouble to make. The frosting tasted like store whipped topping. I would pass on making it again.

I love desserts that are very simple.  This cake is  delicious and I have not found anyone that does not like it.  I also made this cake and cut it into squares to put in a trifle bowl. I layered the cake then raspberries...then the topping.  I made sure the topping was the last layer & then added dark chocolate curls and raspberries to decorate.  Very pretty and yummy.

It turned out great :) None of us like anything super rich or sweet so it was a huge hit with us, though after reading the reviews I did add a bit more sugar to the filling which went a long way I also let it set overnight before putting the topping on which definitely did a lot for the flavor and I didn't leave it in the over as long with our oven putting it in the whole time would of burned it so i would definitely take your oven type and age into account when looking at cook times, all in all great recipe ^^

I followed a lot of the tweaks that the reviews list. Big ones is use heavy whipping cream in the frosting. I make my own stiff whipped cream and used extra un-whipped heavy cream to replace the milk for the pudding. It makes the frosting very light and very rich.  Also always make the cake part the day before-  much better texture.

Like others, I also made this the day before serving. I also upped the sugar to 1 cup. Delicious! I and some of my guests liked this better without the mousse topping. I'm not a big cream cheese fan, so the ricotta was a nice change. Will make again.

i liked the flavor and the topping was pretty good.  The ricotta cheese adds too much water.  It's workable if you're serving all or most of it the first night, but if you have extra it'll get very soggy faster than you think.

I made this cake and the layers did not switch. The white mix settled in the middle of the Pyrex and the cake batter only baked on the side of the Pyrex. What did I do wrong?

Everyone loved it. It looked very impressive. We made the bottom part 2 days before serving and I put the topping and shaved chocolate on about a hour before serving.

I have made this Italian Love Cake recipe 3 times now, always rave reviews.   If you read  reviews stating its bland or they don't like it, all I can say is either  they are not Italian or have never had it in an Italian restaurant.  It tastes exactly as love cake should. Baking time always depends on your stove, or elevation.  I tend to test my cakes with a toothpick in the center.  I start at about 5-10 mins before it's done time.  I have also served the cake warm or cooled, and  I top the slices  with the topping as I serve it, individually.  It is our Italian family favorite.

This was a miserable failure. I followed the directions exactly; no substitutions or changes. The cheese remained on top, and the cake mix burned.  What did I do wrong?

I couldn't get past the texture of the ricotta. I was expecting more of a cream cheese texture. I would use cream cheese if I ever made this again. The whole thing was a little bland, too. It looks very pretty, though.

Loved it! Changes I made: Used Devil's Food Cake mix, whole milk ricotta, and light whipped topping. Also I only cooked it for 60 minutes because it was set by then. I didn't have a 9x13 dish so I used a large deep dish casserole pan and a bread pan. The bread pan separated perfectly, but the casserole dish did not, but it still looked and tasted delicious.

Very good! I was also worried that the cheese wouldn't sink, but it did so beautifully. The top of the finished cake was very uneven. But completely unnoticeable after it was iced. Definitely add shaved chocolate to the top, the little bit of crunch was perfect. I may add mini cops to the cheese layer next time, but I worry they'd all sink to the same level? I baked my cake on a Friday morning, left it on the counter with seran wrap, until Saturday afternoon. I iced it Saturday afternoon for a Saturday evening party. It was a hit. And the leftovers as just as good!

UPDATE: I made it with mini chocolate chips in the cheese mixture. It was good but the chips didn't harden to add the texture I wanted. Next time I'll try regular sized chocolate chips!

I had a Italian themed dinner for friends and I  was looking for a dessert. This recipe sparked my interest specially cause they had just got engaged! I did everything according to the directions except I used a heart shaped spring form pan & baked for only 60 minutes. I made the cake the night before & iced it a hour before guests arrived. I topped it with shaved chocolate and some strawberries. Such a hit, It was delicious!

This is sooo good! I've made it twice now-second time was at the request of my family. The first time I made the ricotta part as the recipe stated. The second time, I made the ricotta mixture using a full cup of sugar (instead of 3/4 c) & 1 Tbl of vanilla (instead of 1 tsp). Both times I've made this I created my own frosting. For the frosting, I melted approx 1/2 c dark chocolate chips with a little coconut oil (maybe 2 tsp), added finely ground espresso (to taste), 1-2 Tbl of Bailey's Irish Cream (can be omitted) and a can of chocolate frosting. Once that was cooled, I mixed it into the cool whip and frosted the cake the next day. The combination of flavors, especially with the coffee, and the textures are just unbelievable! The ricotta becomes almost like a cheesecake consistency and the cake on top is so moist, then the frosting is so creamy! Definitely try this if you haven't already!

I have been making this cake for years, albeit a little differently. I always used only a yellow cake mix with the ricotta mixture. I then dusted the cake with confectioners sugar and offered the option of topping each piece with a spoonful of canned raspberry or cherry pie filling. With or without the ruin topping, it is delicious.I am always asked for the recipe. But I will be making this version today for my husband's 100 year old aunt, who loves chocolate!

This is sooooo good.  I thought I had screwed it up when the ricotta disappeared during baking.  I just cut a piece and the consistency is super moist and creamy.  This is a keeper.

Not hard to make.  It definitely looks impressive.  With the 7 eggs (3 in the cake mix 4 in the ricotta layer) it is a definite special occasion dessert.  Great with fresh sliced strawberries.

My friend's mother used to make this cake and I always wanted the recipe. Who knew it was so simple? The cake came out well. I did take it from the oven after 55 min and all was well. It was a big hit.

I am a pretty decent baker, but this recipe did not work for me.  The taste was good, but the cake never reversed itself.  The ricotta mixture was pretty fluid with 4 eggs.

Pretty awesome when you need a change of pace from a regular cake. My ricotta layer went to the middle which made for lovely layers. Made the cake and chilled in fridge the day before frosting. Made a half size in 9x9, used 1/2 devils food cake mix, but full amount pudding. Baked in about 55 min, in a word YUM!

If you want a dessert that is a hit, THIS IS IT!  My husband bought the ingredients for me and this is what he came home with:   Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate cake mix and Hershey's Dark Chocolate pudding mix (he kinda likes chocolate..) I used whole milk ricotta and whole milk for the pudding-if you're going for dessert why not go all the way?! I made the cake the night before and the  topping the next day.  After making the topping I put it in the fridge until I was ready and then topped each piece as it was served.   I used 16ozs. of frozen whipped topping instead of 12 ozs- can never have enough topping:).   It is not super sweet but just right.  This is definitely a keeper!!

As said before, the baking time is too long. Check after 50 minutes. I use real whipped cream for that part of the frosting- only takes an extra few minutes to whip the cream.

Made this cake for Easter and it was a hit. Very impressed with presentation and a nice blend of textures and flavors. Will definitely make again but would substitute either a real whipped cream topping or possibly a fruit topping. Didn't like the 'chocolate mousse' topping. Otherwise loved it: simple and delicious.

I made this as a two layer lemon cake, which turned out awesome, except there was two much batter for two pans!  I made it again as a chocolate 3 layer for a bake sale, and got so many complimens on it; pretty presentation and scrumptious taste!

i needed a recipe to use up some ricotta i had but i must admit that i was afraid of making this one. yet this was actually a pleasant surprise!  the boys and the hubby ate it all up and we're not big fans of sweets (maybe that's why we liked it) i did make some changes to the frosting: i whipped the cream myself and added more chocolate.  next time i will make the chocolate cake from scratch instead of using a boxed mix.

For some reason the cheese layer didn't sink to the bottom on mine. Got lot of compliements, still had a lot leftover. I and many others loved the whipped topping.

It was really good, I let it sit overnight so it would be even more moist. Every one loved it and ate like half of it. It's really rich with the cake and the chocolate mousse so it's not something you can have seconds with. I loved making it, very nice.

Very unique and attractive cake. I made a chocolate fudge cake from scratch (I prefer scratch cakes to box mixes), and I used a 10"x14" pan. The cake was perfectly done in 60 minutes. I'm glad I took others' advice and used a pan bigger than 9"x13". Even an 11"x15" pan would work well. The cheese filling was a little bland. I used 1 tsp. rum extract instead of vanilla, but I probably should have used at least 2 tsp. Also, I think the filling could have used a little more sugar. Overall, a very good cake, and it tasted even better after a few days! I'm sure I'll be making it again with a few alterations.

Pretty darn good. Very moist. As others suggested, I made the day before, and frosted the day of. I also baked it in a foil pan that had higher sides. I don't know if I would make it again, but that's only because I don't make a ton of cakes. Definately worth a try though.

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I use a marble cake mix, and add 2 tsp. vanilla to the ricotta.  Make sure cake is completely cooled before icing.  Better to make at least a day ahead of time.  Always a hit, wherever I take it.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, only I made it while we had guests.  I did not give it enough time to cool.  It, then tasted eggy.  But the next day, it was heavenly!!!  I gave a few pieces to some friends and family and they loved it!

I followed the intructions completely and was very pleased with the results.  I made the cake 2 days ahead of when it was needed and think that the additional time didn't hurt the cake in any way, if anything, it allowed the cake itself to become very, very moist.  This is definitely a great dessert to take to a pot-luck since it it very easy to make, and feeds quite a few people.  I have recommended this cake to friends, and will definitely make it again.

I think next time I would make it in a 15 inch pan so there would be more room for "frosting". Not too sweet which should be better for us.

This was very different. I used half of the ricotta mix just bc purchased what I thought was a large container for the recipe and it was just enough anymore of the bottom part and I think my family would of passed on this. They did however fight over the bowl that the frosting was mixed in. Truely heavenly and you can actually make this one lowfat if you wanted to and it would still turn out fabulous! Thanks for a wonderful recipe

I am giving this 4 stars b/c I didn't come back with an empty plate, although it might have been b/c there was a ton of food at the get together. The ones who did try it (I didn't b/c I do not eat cake)really liked it. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a big box of pudding per suggestions here. My only problem was that I had to cook it a little longer than said and the cheese part didn't sink as much as I thought it would. I may try this again at another time. Thanks!

Very good! I will let it sit for 24 hours next time. The frosting was sooooo good. I might use it for other things.

I made this cake at the suggestion of my mother.  I thought it was really plain.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I was not impressed at all!  I took it to a cook out, no one complained about it, but no one asked for the recipe either.

Awesome. I made it 2 days ahead of time as per the instructions of other reviewers. I topped it with the mousse several hours before serving. Yummy!!!

Good Simple cake.  I'm glad to find a recipe using a cake mix in a pinch.  The cool whip topping is very lite.  Will make again.

This was a big hit!  I made it for a family get together and two of the three other women in attendance asked for the recipe.  The other one doesn't cook much, so I wouldn't have expected her to want it.  It's very light.  I actually prefer a heavier cake, but everyone loved it!

this recipe was so easy and tasty.  I did cut back on the ricotta, only by about 1/2 a cup.  I also skipped the milk as one reviewer did and used a cook and stir pudding mix.  the only one I had on hand.  my husband loved this cake. It was better the next day, so I would recommend making the day before you plan on serving.

Yum yum yum!  My husband and I loved this cake.  I was skeptical at first about how the ricotta layer ended up below the cake layer, but it really did!

I would give this 4 stars for the richness but no one else enjoyed it much.  It's easy to make too, which is another plus.

We've been making this cake in my family for years.  The only difference we have is we use vanilla pudding instead of chocolate for the topping.  It gives it a nice contrast.

Easy, moist and delicious.  When making it you think that it will be a heavy pound like cake, but it is not...it is excellent and moist.

After reading all the reviews, I thought this cake would be to die for, but for some reason, it was just "okay" and I just didn't love it.  I also used the fudge marble cake mix, as one person suggested, which made it look nice, and it was quite easy to make, but I'll try something else next time.  Thanks for sharing it though!
