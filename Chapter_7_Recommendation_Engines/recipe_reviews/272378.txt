The only change I made was using a French loaf pans instead of rounds. Awesome recipe. Next time....and there will be a next time...I may put some moisture in the oven to make the outside crust a bit more crispy.

It looks like a lot of steps, but when you are doing it it is no big deal. This came out crusty and chewy and full of little holes. I added rosemary and anise seeds. I also brushed milk on the top. I trimmed the parchment paper  into a circle around the dough, about an inch extra all around, just before dropping it into the Dutch oven. I will be making this often!
