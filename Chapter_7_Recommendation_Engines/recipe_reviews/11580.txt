Something is missing here. Loretta needs to go back and check her recipe. I think she got the titles mixed up. "Pfeffernerse" means "pepper nuts". It's supposed to be a spice cookie with pepper added to zip up the spices even more. It's shaped like a nut, but it doesn't contain nuts. This recipe is for a nut cookie, like Pecan Dreams, which in Scandinavia is made with almonds.

I absolutely love the texture that the bakers ammonia gives this cookie.  They tasted like little puffs of sugar.  I would add a generous amount, 1-3 tsp, of vanilla extract next time.  Thanks for the post.  It was fun to see what bakers ammonia can do to a cookie.

I reviewed this recipe before, noting that these are exactly what my husband remembered his Norwegian grandmother making when he was a kid.  It turns out this recipe is also what my daughter's ice skating coach remembers her German grandmother making as well!  Simply by sharing the recipe you have brought back a bit of childhood for many people (I make these for all of my husband's family as well as the skate coach now).  That has been the best gift ever.  A million thank you's for sharing.  This recipe is Truly a gift.
