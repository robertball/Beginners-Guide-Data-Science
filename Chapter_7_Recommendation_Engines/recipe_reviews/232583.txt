This soup is just as I remember from my school days in Sölden, Austria! After making the recipe listed here, I changed a few things to make it even more like I remembered. Started with half pound of bacon, browned the meat in the bacon fat, left out half the butter, added the vegetables, crumbled the bacon. I replaced some of the 5 cups of water with a can of no-added salt diced tomatoes along with the tomato paste, and a big diced russet about 30-40 minuted before serving, 2 t. caraway seed and then a cup of red wine. I did not need to thicken with the cornstarch. I had to add some extra liquid and I’m not sure if it’s because of the potato or because I live at a very high altitude, but make sure you have enough liquid to cook your meat until it’s tender. I used a leaner bison chuck steak and simmered the meat for maybe 2 hours. Beef might take less time. This is just like I remember!!!

I would not change anything, I make this soup all the time. You can also put some Potatoes in at 2. but might add a little more water. In Austria this Gulasch soup is a tradition in Restaurants.  Excellent,

I was in Hungary this summer and fell in love with goulash. I was surprised to be served a soup when I ordered it! The secret is the paprika! I made this as directed. Next time I will add potatoes, but it is hearty and delicious as is!

I stuck with the recipe except I doubled the paprika and I am glad I did.  It was good, would make it again except I would just cook the meat without any vegetables for the 1st half hour.  I would add the veggies in for the last hour only (maybe half hour?), they were a bit mushy.

This was wonderful.  I've been trying to duplicate my mother's recipe for years and this came closest to hers.  I did start with about 4 slices of bacon, cut up, and only half the butter called for.  And added 2 cups of sliced fresh mushrooms with the tomato paste, etc.  Really delicious served over egg noodles.

Don't leave the lid on once it's set to simmer for an hour so the soup gets thicker. I also added a dash of celery seed at the end. Serve with plain Greek yogurt or sour cream. Yum!

Brilliant. I adapted this recipe to the Instant Pot (pressure cooker). I'm from Germany and can confirm it's damned good as is.
Changes: Beef broth instead of water (definitely do this)
- Double the Hungarian paprika
- I added carrots. Potatoes would go great too.
- I wound up adding more salt, Worcestershire, and Franks Red Hot than the recipe calls for to taste at the end (not too much more).

Instant Pot Adaptation:
- Add margarine and onions, saute for 10 mins.
- add paprika and the rest of the spices + 1 cup (or more) of broth. Mix for a minute or so.
- Add tomato paste and the rest of the broth. Mix for another minute or so.
- Add beef/veggies, mix, and pressure cook for 35 mins. Natural release. 
- season as needed after.
