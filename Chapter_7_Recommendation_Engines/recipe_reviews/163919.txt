These were good but not great. They were a bit dry (possibly because of the ranch mix).  Next time I will definately be using more Mayo.  Also, way too much pepper.  While I was grinding it out for the teaspoon measurement I thought it was a bit much, but wanted to follow the recipe to give a real review.  I would say to use about half to 1/4 of the pepper.  Also, what brings out the flavor in deviled eggs is salt, definately add a little.  The ranch dressing gave it a little tang but took away from the mustard flavor that I love when having these.  Good recipe for something different, but if you love traditional deviled eggs, you will probably only LIKE these.

I didn't have any ranch dressing mix, so I substituted 1 tablespoon of prepared mix and decreased the mayo to 3 tablespoons.  I also used dijon mustard and sprinkled with paprika for a more traditional look!  I'm not a big fan of mustard, but I really enjoyed them because the ranch toned down the mustard flavor.  We will make these again!

I added half the amount of ranch dressing mix that the recipe called for and the flavor was still extremely strong. The flavor was too strong to eat it.

Never thought of this- as a twist on regular Deggs..I think I solved the dryness of it though-instead of using mayo and mix, I add 'Litehouse' ranch dressing. Wow, that's good (it's versatile too) add some chopped green onion and a few bacon pieces. The possibilities are endless. Thanks for another way of looking at an old favorite!

We liked them. The were definitely different from the deviled eggs we've made traditionally. I didn't have paprika so we put cayenne pepper on half of them. That was really good. Next time I'll use more mustard. A good tip is to put all your indredients for the inside of your eggs in a zip lock bag. Gives kids a chance to help because they can squish everything in the bag and then you just cut the tip off and squeeze into your eggs!

Excellent !! The ranch is a nice twist, and I upped the ante by using a yellow horseradish mustard ... put it the fridge by reusing the egg carton and slipping the halves in each egg slot...decided I'd have a couple with lunch the next day, ONLY ONE HALF AN EGG LEFT !!!  I,m assuming the elves got to them..... my husband couldn't have eaten them all !!??  Could he ????

Made these for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of both ranch dressing and deviled eggs. Me, not so much for the eggs, but I really liked these and he loved them. I used the mustard that I had on hand, spicy brown, and they still turned out great. I'll be making these again, my go-to deviled egg recipe. Five stars from me! Thanks so much!

I just tried out this recipe today. I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't like it. The taste was too bland for me. It didn't give me that "mmm" or "wow" satisfaction. I give it 1 star because the egg itself was good. I'd rather eat the hard boiled egg by itself than with this recipe's mixture.

These were great!  My family really enjoyed them.  Even though I doubled the recipe, I used only 1/2 tsp of pepper and 1 tsp of ranch powder and they were just right for us.  Thanks so much for a yummy new way to make an old favorite.

prepared this for our memorial Day celebration.  I think it turned out great.  Did the suggestions of "Farmer's Wife" since I did not have ranch dressing mix and Lin by re-using the egg carton.  Will have to edit my review once my guests taste them...I'm sure it will stay 5 stars though

These are good, but needed some changes. My family really likes pepper, but this was way too much. I only put in about 1/4 tsp pepper. I also thought it wasn't creamy enough so I added 1 tsp vinegar and 1 extra tsp mustard. That made it much better. I wish I'd thought to add some salt. If I make this one again, I will.

Really good! I was only making these for 1 so I cut the recipe to just 2 eggs. I love finding ways to use my homemade ranch dressing mix. This was great. I like my eggs with crunch so next time I might add pickles or onion. Thanks!

Such a simple addition to the classic deviled egg and it makes a world of difference!  I've found myself preparing these more than the classics, which is saying something.

These are awesome, but I definitely recommend that you add more of the dry ranch mix than called for! I have made these several times now and they are super easy to make in large batches for family get-togethers, cook-outs, or church events!!!

I personally would have liked more Ranch flavor myself. I didn't find it salty at all. I did follow as written. I would try doubling the Ranch next time.

I suggest you add either dill pickle relish of sweet pickle relish to taste.  Being from the south, i have never made deviled eggs without it! I also added a couple of dashes of hot sauce!  Enjoy!

This is my go-to recipe for deviled eggs.  The ranch flavor makes all the difference.  I never was a fan of deviled eggs, neither were my kids, but since we've been making this recipe, I bring them to as many gatherings as I can.  My kids even make them.  They have been a staple at holiday gatherings since I found your recipe a numbers of years ago . (I can't believe there aren't more reviews.)  Everyone loves them!  Thank you!
