I made this recipe with one change added to it. Instead of using canned soup I put in vegetable broth using equal amounts of cornstarch and flour for thickening. I think this is a healthier alternative than using regular soup that can be quite salty. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Hi!  This is my recipe. I always cook the rice in the microwave because it's faster.  I add 1 c. uncooked rice and 2 c. water in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave for around 20 mins.  Also, I steam the broccoli.  You can also use 2 pkgs of frozen broccoli to save cook time.  The recipe takes a while to make, but it is worth it.  You can also make it the day ahead of time and bake in the oven when you are ready to eat.  It might need a little longer to bake if its chilled all the way through.  Enjoy!

This recipe is wonderful but save yourself some time by using frozen broccoli. Just thaw and mix in with the other ingredents no need to pre cook. It comes out great!!

Great base recipe.  I made a few changes to make it healthier.  Like a past reviewer, I used chicken stock thickened with flour and cornstarch with a bit of skim milk added to it in place of the soup.  I also added carrots and peas to the broccoli.  I used brown rice and used less cheese than what the recipe called for.  Turned out wonderful! This reminds me of a recipe my grandma used to make for us, but a LOT healthier version of it:)

I made this for my office Christmas party and it was delicious. I made one change and used sour cream instead of yogurt.

I have made this a couple of times, each time modifying the recipe preparation methods to suit my schedule and personal preferences- i.e. using frozen broccoli vs. fresh steamed broccoli, making the rice well ahead of time (many times using leftover rice from a different meal), etc. I also do what another review suggested in making and using my own cream of chicken soup. This recipe is GREAT! Very yummy... really love the combination of all the flavors and the crunch the almonds bring. Thanks for this great recipe!

Nice comfort food and easy to make as a one dish meal. I used cooked brown rice and two large chicken breasts boiled in water, cooled and cubed. Used one condensed mushroom soup and one regular mushroom soup because I didn't have another condensed one. Skipped almonds because I didn't have any. Turned out good. Both my husband and 2 year old who doesn't eat broccoli ate it up!

I made this for dinner last night-great recipe.  I made it as written, except for using 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar, and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds (that's how they're pkgd-didn't want to save small amounts).  Flavors are subtle...esp loved the curry! I may try it without almonds next time.  Even though I added a little extra, think I'd like to try it without the crunchiness of the almonds (just a texture thing-can't tell if they impacted the overall taste of the dish).  3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts is the perfect amount for this recipe if you're wondering.  I boiled then cubed them.  Thanks for the yummy recipe-it's a keeper!

I needed to use up some leftover rice and this hit the spot! I replaced one can of condensed chicken soup with coconut milk which tasted great with the hint of curry.

Made some slight modifications. I used pecans instead of almonds. I also added 1/3 cup sauteed onions. Microwaved the broccoli for 4 min instead of cooking stovetop. After putting mixture in dish cover with layer of cheddar cheese. Put casserole in oven 15 min. While Casserole is baking, mix 1/3 cup crushed cornflakes, 1/3 cup bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons melted butter, 1/2 tsp. Minced garlic & 1/4 tsp parsley in Ziploc bag. Add to casserole after first 15 mins, then bake for an Additional 15 min. Yum!

This was a nice, quick, weeknight dish, definitely a departure from the usual for us.  It makes a big casserole!  I prepared as written, but did add quite a bit more curry, love the stuff.  I topped with a butter/panko breadcrumb topping.  I baked for 45 minutes as this was just out of the fridge, and then placed under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the crust.  I let this sit for a few minutes before slicing, and it came out in formed squares.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

It was easy to pull together and delicious. I used chicken broth with cornstarch and flour and it worked perfectly. I also added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top. I loved the combo of the lemon and curry flavor.

I took the advice of other reviewers and made some changes- used sour cream instead of yogurt, deleted the almonds & I used a grilled piece of chicken and shredded it. It was delicious! My 1 yr old son gobbled it up & he's a picky eater! We will be making it again.

Way too sour with the lemon juice and the yogurt.  The almonds seemed out of place.  All in all, the recipe was not a hit at my house.

Easy and very good! I made a few changes and still turned out great. I substituted the yogurt for sour cream for ease of what I had in the fridge. I seasoned the chicken with the same seasoning the recipe calls for (garlic powder, curry powder, and pepper) before cooking . I also made a crust by mixing melted butter and bread crumbs and added this to the top in the last 10 minutes. I turned the broiler on for the last two minutes to brown the crust. Yummy!

Very good casserole. I hate it when people alter ingredients and then rate a recipe but, I had to. Its a stormy day in Ontario. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup creamed cottage cheese. I found my new convection oven didn't brown and bubble the top so, I broiled it for 5 mins. Doubled the spices and will be making again. Very good :) Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!!!! I made it the night before and let sit out for about an hour before cooking... Didn't use lemon juice or almonds... Topped with shredded parmesan and seasoned bread crumbs... My husband only likes 5 things that I make! This is one of his favorites... Thank you!

My family of 5 really liked this dish!  Even picky kids liked it.  I only had 1 cup of cheddar cheese, so I sprinkled it on top instead of stirring it in.  This tasted great and looked very appealing.  I added almost double the amount of garlic and curry powders because I like strong flavors.  I would do it again next time.

i changed a lot...added sauteed onions, fresh mushroom slices, fat free cheddar, a little reduced fat feta and did not add curry powder or sliced almonds.  it was kind of weird, but i will use this recipe as a base and try it again.  i think it definitely needs a top crust.

I only used 3/4 of 1 can of the soup because of the sodium content and just added more yogurt and a tiny bit of sourcream. I also used wild rice instead of white. It was sooooo good!

This dish was yummy!  Creamy comfort food, yet the lemon adds a zippy lightness and the curry, some warmth!  Even my son who hates casseroles, gobbled this up!

I only had jasmine rice & no curry or almonds, but it still turned out yummy! If you microwave rice, I suggest checking on it at 15min. Was over cooked when I microwaved it at 20min & had to add more water to help bring it back to life. ;-)

Very good and so easy. I took the advise of other reviewers and substituted the cream of soup with broth and also used sour cream instead of yogurt. It's awesome! Next time, I'm going to try the recipe as is, just to compare..and maybe less lemon juice

Easy Chicken & Broccoli Casserole Haiku: "Didn't use almonds. Mayo instead of yogurt. Did the rest the same." Not an elegant meal that I'd serve for guests but easy and comforting, most definitely.

This is totally a keeper.  I followed the recipe as is except for a few modifications to make it faster:

1. I used left over rotisserie chicken that got from Costco.
2. I used frozen veggies.  I did not have enough broccoli so I added about a cup of peas and a cup of asparagus. I boiled all of my veggies together and added them to my mixture. 
3.  I added an extra teaspoon of garlic powder and an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, just because I like those flavors.
4. When I combined this all into the bowl, it seemed a bit dry, so I added about 1/2 cup of milk.  Who knows if it helped or was even needed.  

This came of delicious.  Thanks for sharing!!

A success for my family! Substituted non-fat plain Greek yogurt and am glad I didn't have any lemons. The tang from the yogurt was enough! Delicious, easy and a great way to use the broccoli from veggie co-op.

I used cauliflower rice instead of rice and less cheese to make it healthier.  It was good, but next time I'd add spices and shallots to add more flavor.  I will definitely make again and see how I can spice it up a bit.

Fabulous! Super easy, and everyone went back for seconds! I did use a little "Slap ya Mama" Cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper ... marry a Cajun man and god forbid should you leave it out of a recipe! Definitely will do this again. I was skeptical about the yogurt, but it added a delightful flavor.

I skipped the yogurt and almonds, as I didn't have them and they didn't seem necessary. It came out perfect! I eyeballed the lemon juice, but probably used quite a bit less than the recipe asked for. I also added extra curry powder.  My husband loved this.

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken to add an additional flavor. And I used frozen broccoli that I had thawed - this saved an additional cooking step and ensured the veggies were crisp and not mushy as they were already blanched before freezing. I also only used a 6 oz cup of Greek yogurt (and the consistency was fine) which prevented me from buying a big container that I would not completely use to get the full cup.

I followed one reviewers advise to make it healthier by using flour and broth instead of cream of chicken soup, although I added about half a can of soup too.  I think it would have been better using the original recipe, next time I'll play around with it a little more.  Overall, my family really liked it.

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I would change is the amount of lemon juice added.  It was too lemony.  Next time I will either cut it out or only use half as much.

I made this and both my husband and I loved it! I rated it 3 stars because I made some modifications as recommended in the comments. As suggested I did not use precooked rice. I cooked my own and added two cups to the dish. Instead of the canned chicken I used the rotisserie chicken. I would suggest using the entire chicken as I only used two cups of worth of the chicken I pulled off. I used the onion mix vs a real onion. Next time I will use a real onion as the mix made the dish a bit salty for me. Also, to add crunch I used frenchies onions that I added to the top of the dish the last 5 min of baking. These were good but I think they added to the saltiness. Next time I’ll try crackers instead. And lastly, I steamed and chopped up my own broccoli instead of using frozen. This made AMAZING leftovers and I froze two portions to eat another day! All in all great recipe with good modification suggestions.

This recipe made a huge, comforting casserole, which I was able to divide and freeze for later. I left out the lemon juice, and glad I did, because the yogurt gives it enough tartness. I can’t imagine it any more sour. This is why I deducted 1 star.  You can get creative and add your own seasonings and extra veggies, if you’d like. I added a handful of frozen green peas and used half broccoli/half cauliflower, because it’s what I had.

Great casserole! A couple substitutions due to ingredients on hand. Mayonnaise in place is yogurt, jalapeño jack cheese in place of cheddar; chicken cooked in butter and white wine and finally topped with half packet of stove top stuffing.

Full of flavor! I only made a few changes, but I am sure it is great as it is. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so I used one can cream of broccoli soup and 14 ounces of vegetable broth, thickened with cornstarch (it's just what I had in the cupboard). Since we are going lower carb, I cut the rice in half. And I substituted cut up water chestnuts for the slivered almonds.  I divided the shredded cheese: 1/2 in the casserole and 1/2 over the top. I will definitely make this again!

Ridiculously easy and yummy recipe. Thanks! Easy to substitute things too. I used sour cream when I had no yogurt. Use precooked rice from the freezer and zap the broccoli in the microwave and there's practically no work.
