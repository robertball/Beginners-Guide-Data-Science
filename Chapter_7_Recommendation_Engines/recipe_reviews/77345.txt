I followed this recipe exactly, only I needed more like 4 bananas (but I like A LOT of bananas) and I blotted the bananas dry after dipping in the lemon juice so that I wouldn't get a lemony flavor.  It's a great recipe.  Much easier than my previous recipe which required tempering of eggs and always had to be doubled.  This makes a 'proper' amount of filling so that you have a good sized pie.  The flavor is a LITTLE rich and a LITTLE on the sweet side, but not overly so.  You just won't be able to sit down and eat the whole pie.  If you are not used to making banana cream pie you must make SURE that your filling is completely cool or room temp...even the slightest amount of heat will cause the bananas to turn black.

Awesome.  Pretty much sums it up!  Everyone who had it loved it.  I was a little worried about dipping the bananas in the lemon juice, but it didn't taste lemony at all.  To decorate the top of the pie, I placed 8 banana slices on the top and then I melted about a 1/4 c. chocolate chips with about 1 tsp. of Crisco and drizzled it over the banana slices mainly with a little drizzling in the center...looked really impressive!

This recipe is idiot proof...Hubby and I just loved it, the only change I made was 4 bananas (they were the small ones) and I used "light" condensed milk it was great(its all I had in the cupboard.)
This will be my only recipe for banana cream pie...
You will not go wrong using this recipe

All I can say is DELISH!  This pie is the best.  I usually use Jello cook n' serve pie filling for my banana pies and thought that was how it was supposed to taste.  Boy was I wrong!  This pie is just wonderful.  Hubby didn't usually eat banana cream pie, he tasted this one because I told him it was a new recipe and I think he has eaten 1/2!  With a mouthful of pie, he told me to not loose this recipe.  I will make this one again.  Thanks!

I think this recipe was a very quick and simple recipe to follow. I didn't pour the whole can of sweetened condensed milk in because I knew it would be too sweet for me. Instead, I used half the can. Other than that, I did everything according to the recipe, and it turned out great!

i was leary to make a cream pie of any kind b/c i thought i wouldnt be able to do it.  B/c i tend to rush things along, but this was so easy, and the custard was done very quickly.  it took longer to bake the pre-made pie crust for 15 minutes than it did to make the custard.  my hubby loved this, he ate 2 pieces right away.  not too sweet and very creamy.  very very good!

Excellent!!Don't be leary of the lemon juice-the pie did not pick up any of the lemon flavor-I think it actually brings out the flavor of the bananas-delicious!

This turned out fantastic. Next time I will use extra bananas. I served it with whipped cream and slivered almonds on top. YUM! Very easy to make, too!

My husband loves banana cream pie, so I thought I would give this a try.  The custard was good, however, I would not use lemons on the bananas again as it altered the flavor too much. I did use fresh lemon juice because I do not like the concentrated stuff - maybe that makes a difference. With that change it would be delicious!

I've used this recipe for years, but since we're not crazy about banana cream pie, I use it to make coconut cream pie and chocolate cream pie.

excellent in a graham cracker crust...line the bottom and sides with banana slices. also, no need to "dip" each banana slice in lemon juice...just put all the slices in a large bowl and add a few tbs lemon juice then toss with your fingers until all are coated. great recipe!

I have to say this turned out awful.  the taste was good, but never set up thick.  ive been cooking a long time and never had a custard not set up.  i followed this one to a tee, even the part about drying off the bananas.  i gave it 2 stars for taste alone, but wont be making this one again.

This recipie is AMAZING!  Soooo rich and creamy and full of flavor.  I recommend this recipie to anyone who wants a delicious pie for themselves or to serve to others. FYI, I didn't have any cornstarch on hand when I made this so I replaced it with 5 Tablespoons flour and it worked out perfectly.

Very easy and tasty. I added  1/2 cup toasted coconut to the bottom of the pie, before I poured the filling in, for a little more texture. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it turned out great!

Very good.  I used a double broiler per my grandmother's advice to cook the custard.  It took about 12 minutes until the custard thickened.  I think the bananas were yummy soaked in the lemon juice and you didn't taste the lemon at all.

This was an excelletn pie! Mmmmmm. I used 1 and 2/3 cups of water and it was SO good! I used a different named pie and it called for 1 and 2/3 cups of water, and I used that recipe. But other than that they are exactly the same. Yum!
 Thank-you.

My mom made this pie for me when I was a kid and I thought I'd never be able to replicate it. Little did I know she just used the recipe on the back of the can! This is my definition of the perfect banana cream pie; not too sweet, and very banana-y. The only thing my mom did different is to use more bananas (3) and crush them before combining it with the condensed milk mix.

The first time I made this I had trouble getting the custard to set up. It takes patience and more work than you'd expect. First, don't turn the heat up or you will surely burn the milk. Second, stir the entire time or the bottom will thicken before the top does and you'll end up with a lumpy mess. Third, have patience and watch it closely. I'd estimate it takes at least 6 minutes of continuous stirring on medium heat before the thickening happens, but when it does happen it happens fast, almost like magic so be prepared.

The filling tasted good but it didn't set up at all!!!! I followed the directions and chilled it for a long time too! We put it in the freezer and it was pretty good then but not the same as pie.

Great recipe - thanks!  It was my first time and it turned out great. The custard was a bit dense for me, so I added some extra cool-whip to it, which I thought made it absolutely perfect. I also REALLY appreciate the advice that the custard has to be absolutely cooled to room temperature before pouring on the bananas, it kept mine from turning black (along with the lemon juice). Easy, quick, and delicious! Thanks!

I am a pretty big cream pie fan, but I felt this recipe was overly sweet.  I am a non-baker as well, so making the filling was a little daunting for me.  My husband and kids loved it though, so although it wasn't my favorite I am still rating it three stars.

I made this pie for Thansgiving and it turned out really good. The only suggestion I would make is maybe add some Knox gellatin, because after about a day in the fridge, the pie got kinda melty.Also use Eagles brand sweetend condensed milk, not an off brand, it really makes a difference to the taste. I used extra bananas and dipped them fresh lemon juice, because that was all i had. Then i dried them a little on paper towels, and no lemony flavor was present. I think the pie overall is very good, and I had fun decorating it with sliced bananas and whip cream that i made out of the egg whites. YUMMY! thanks for the recipe!

This pie was so wonderful.  I used extra bananas.  The only problem that I had was the filling didn't set firm enough.  I think I might add a little gelatin next time I make the pie.

This recipe was so easy and the pie was just wonderful.  I will definitely make it again.  I tasted the filling before I added it to the pie crust and worried that the pie was going to be too sweet, but with the finished combination of pie crust, bananas and unsweetened whipped cream it was perfect.  I also used an earlier reviewer's suggestion and drizzled some melted chocolate over the top, which is an addition that I would highly recommend!

I normally make my cream pie from scratch (scalded milk, eggs, flour, sugar, butter, and vanilla), I am requested to make it because no one makes it like mine (they use a box).  I wanted to try something that omitted the scalded milk step.  I tried this one, it set up wonderful, better than my normal kind but it lacked in everything else.  They said it tasted "fake" (aka box).  I did notice when it was cooling it formed a skin on the top, if you place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding it will stop that from happening.  I wouldn't make this again.

I'm going to try this recipe again - following it to a "t" - then maybe change my rating. I made a few changes and I think that may have affected things - for the worst. I added two pureed bananas to the custard because we like lots of banana flavor. I'm not sure if the banana was the culpret, but the custard had a weird texture. It also didn't set up firm. Is it supposed to be firm? Also, I like a graham crust, but didn't have any, so I used crushed homemade sugar cookies (very good!) Also, after reading some of the reviews, I think some people may be a little confused about the lemon juice...In this recipe, it's not for flavoring - any time you add an acid (like lemon juice) to fruits and veggies (like bananas and potatoes) it keeps them from turning brown when exposed to air.

Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved this pie!  I used banana extract instesd of vanilla.  I also whipped up some banana pudding and dream whip and piled it high on the top! I will make this pie again and again!

Delicious pie!  I put 3 bananas in the pie.  I will use another next time.  The filling looked lumpy to begin with, but was creamy in the pie?
