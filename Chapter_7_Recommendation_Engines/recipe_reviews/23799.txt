I used reduced fat sour cream in this salad dressing. When I made this dressing, I added the white wine vinegar a little at a time, tasting after each tablespoon--two tablespoons was just enough for me. I ended up thinning it out a bit with reduced fat milk. I really loved the combination of ingredients in this dressing. This was nice drizzled over wedge salad. I'd like to make this again but maybe add some fresh chives and maybe a little onion powder.

Not bad for a quick dressing - I highly recommend adding the white wine vinegar a Tbsp. at a time to your desired taste though. I cut the recipe in half and used about 1 & 1/2 to 2 Tbsp. and that was plenty for me. I also used less pepper as well. If you want a thicker dressing be sure to use less buttermilk - add it slowly until you get the desired consistency. I let it set for about and hour to let the flavors blend together.

I was expecting a thicker dressing.  Even when I added more sour cream and parmesan, it didn't do the trick.  I recommend adding only part of the buttermilk and vinegar at first and then adding more to get the desired consistency.  This definitely was not the PP dressing we made in the restaurant where I worked in college.

This is one of the best dressings I've ever tasted!!! It has the consistency of a vinagrette, so be forewarned if you're looking for something thick.  It can be made a little healthier with a low fat buttermilk (I didn't think it diminshed the taste at all).  Also beware the amount of black pepper used--1 tbsp or less should do the trick if you don't like it too hot.  Great recipe otherwise though!

This dressing was a little to wartery for me. I even added more sour cream and cheese to thicken it up. It did not work. However, I did like the taste. I will try it again, but will figure out how to thicken it up a little.

Thankfully I tweaked this recipe based on previous reviews, or else I think this would've gone in the garbage.  I added about 1/3 cup light hellmans mayo to the dressing to thicken which resulted in the desired consistency for me, although not as creamy as a restaurant version of this dressing.  I cut the vinegar back to 3 tbsp. which was plenty.  I upped the fresh black pepper a bit based on personal taste.  This needs tweaking still, next time I'm using one clove of garlic bc that taste was stronger than I would prefer.  All in all I will try this again though bc it was fairly light for a white dressing.

A keeper!  First time around, I didn't change a thing.  Now that I've made it a few times, I think (for my tastes) it's a little heavy on the buttermilk.  So I cut down a little bit on that and the pepper. thanks!

Great dressing.  Could have used some more kick, maybe I could have added more salt and pepper.  Tasty:)

Reduce the amount of buttermilk to 1/4 C, use 1/2 C sour cream and leave out the vinegar and replace with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (or more to taste), and add a good splash of olive oil.  This should whip to a thicker consistency (adding more buttermilk as needed).  Also if you want a nice blue cheese dressing simply replace the parmesan with crumpled blue cheese.

I loved this. I used it over mixed greens and red onion and it was amazing. Id make it again. I did use milk I soured myself since I dont keep buttermilk on hand.

This dressing is very good.  I added 3T sugar.  As written it is very runny for our taste so I added another 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  I made this to go with the "cajun chicken club" from this site.  It makes about 2 cups of dressing.  This was great on my salad today.

This recipe turns out well if you make *serious* alterations.  I didn't add any milk at all and it was still quite runny.  I think it would turn out nicer if you added 2-3 Tsp of lemon juice instead of the vinegar.

Nice dressing.  I added the buttermilk and vinegar a little at a time to make sure it wasn't too thin.

Whew, this recipe is a little heavy on the vinegar.  I also had to add alot more garlic and some cayenne.  It was a little thin, so next time I will add equal parts of heavy cream and buttermilk.  Just okay . . .

I reduced the milk and used two percent to make this dressing into a lovely creamy dip. We used it for dipping with chicken fingers baked in our convection oven.

Made it, even triple the fresh grated parmesan and sour cream this stuff was running like water flowing down hill. Would barely stick to the salad. Wasn't impressed with the flavor either. Wouldn't make this again, wouldn't recommend this either, sorry.

This dressing is very good and easy to make. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, worked perfectly.

A very tasty dressing, five starts with more black pepper (but that's just a personal preference). I did try to make it healthier by using nonfat plain yogurt in place of sour cream, but other than that I stuck with the recipe. I found this to be a heavier dressing so I will probably enjoy it more for lunchtime salads. Thanks for sharing!
