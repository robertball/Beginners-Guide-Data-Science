Delicious! I recommend marinating the chicken overnight for the best flavor infusion. I used skinless chicken thighs for this with great results. Really unique blend of flavors...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This really good. I just made my second batch in 3 days. The yogurt coating is great. I did notice it doesn’t call for any salt and pepper. I seasoned the chicken before baking. It’s freezing outside right now so grilling is not an option. This is a keeper. Will be in my chicken marinade rotation.

My four children, ages 13, 12, 9,  and 4 loved this marinade.  Final yield covers at least 1.5 - 2 lbs chicken. 
I really enjoyed the flavor as well. 
Thank you for sending it in for us to share.
