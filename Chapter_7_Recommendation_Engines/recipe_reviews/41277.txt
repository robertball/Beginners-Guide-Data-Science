Lucious!  This cake was worthy of it's reward.   Like most foam cakes it's not quick to make. It takes time to fold in the egg whites, but it's moist and tender, and the flavor is wonderful. I'll pass the recipe along to others for sure!

This was really great!  Definitely a keeper.  Everyone loved the hint of orange.  One thing...my cake didn't turn out as high as I thought it would from the picture.  Any suggestions?

A great alternative to the traditional marble cake: light, tasty and very fragrant. I used extra light olive oil and 7/8 cup + 2 Tb sugar. A keeper that keeps well.

This turned out beautifully moist.  The only change I made was to exchange the 3/4 cup water with orange juice for a slightly more orangey flavor. If your cake isn't rising to the top of the pan, make sure your baking powder is fresh. This is a really impressive cake and a definite keeper!

it was my first time making a cake by myself without help from my mom. kind of a risky choice for my first time but i decided to do it anyways. it's ok, but nothing special. it lacked flavour. as for the sauce, just for safe measures i made half and i found that was just enough. i also added a bit of lemon juice to the icing to make it a bit more tangy.
