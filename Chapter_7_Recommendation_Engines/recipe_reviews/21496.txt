I can't believe it was so-o-o-o good.  I, too, followed another reviewer's suggestions and used a 9x9 casserole dish, two packages of spinach and no cinnamon.  Be sure you use a casserole deep enough because it can start out fairly high.  I used olive oil instead of butter to brush the phyllo layers, and added some fresh garlic when I sauted the onions.  Another step saver -- I thawed and drained the frozen spinach, then added it directly to the softened onions/garlic without steaming first.  I can't wait to make this again!

Here's what I learned from making this dish: I wanted to cut the saturated fat (a cup is A LOT of grease!); I did this by mixing 1/4 each melted butter and olive oil. Also added about 1 scant tsp. nutmeg (the traditional Greek seasoning for this dish). I never use eggs in mine, as they make the mixture too wet, and the lovely phyllo gets soggy as a consequence. Nothing worse than soggy phyllo! I also only used half the phyllo and 2 10 oz. frozen packs spinach for the same reason. Kept the parm and swiss cheese and that was a really nice touch. I used only half the package of phyllo and baked in a 9 x 13 Pyrex dish until golden. Make sure you roll the edges and butter them (it makes a nice pizza-like crust). I serve this with a large Greek salad, and, on special occasions, get to serve it with the homemade baklava that my next door neighbor Georgia -- who is Greek -- brings by during the holidays. Good times.

Excellent recipe, I substituted premade pie crusts for the phyllo dough. It was easier, and it tasted great still. Thanks Bea!

This was very good! Added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2c chopped parsley, 1/2c ricotta, nutmeg instead of cinnamon and garlic-herb feta. Squeezed the spinach very dry and even the left-overs where not soggy. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic! I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 baking dish. I did'nt steam the spinach but just drained and it's still great.I use 2 pieces of phyllo stuck together per phyllo layer and then butter them. They don't tear nearly as much and I cant tell the difference in texture or taste. Enjoy!

I usually bake half the batch and freeze the other half to bake later.  These are even great cold (perfect for lunches on the go, school lunches, etc).  This recipe is easy to tweak if you don't have all of the ingredients.

WONDERFUL!! The finished product was so good, my mother claimed it was better than her favorite Greek restaraunt's recipe. I did not add cinnamon and only had dried basil leaves on hand, but it was easy to make & even good re-heated in the oven.

This was a really nice addition to a greek themed dinner I prepared for my family on Christmas Eve.  I made the pie on Sunday night and cooked it through, and it refridgerated successfully and I warmed it in the oven Tuesday night and served.  The phyllo dough was tough to deal with but worth the effort.  I served it with pastitsio, tzatziki dip and pita and a greek salad, all of which you can find recipes for.  What a good meal!

This was really delicious. I only used two packages of spinach, however, the same amount of cheeses. I used a 9X9 casserole dish and was able to get away with eight sheets of phyllo. I nixed the cinnamon and added garlic and onion powders and some crisp bacon. The family loved this Bea and thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was SO good.  Never worked with phyllo before or made spanakopita, although I've always loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used Gruyere cheese instead of swiss and only two boxes of frozen spinach.  It was fantastic!  I will be making this again for Christmas.  Thanks.

I truly enjoyed this dish.  I followed the recommendations of others and left out the cinnamon, but added garlic and extra feta.  I think it still lacks flavor to have such strong ingredients, but we all enjoyed it over the holidays and will def. make it again!
Thanks!

I was nervous about trying spanakopita as I've never worked with phyllo dough. This was an amazing recipe and my family loved it. It baked up perfectly and was delicious. I added two additional eggs and a cup of ricotta cheese, but made no other changes. I had left over spinach mixture, which I used the next day to make baked ziti. I addition ricotta cheese to the mixture and layered it with ziti and canned spaghetti sauce and topped it all with mozzerella cheese and baked the entire thing. The original dish was amazing and so were the leftovers. I will make this again.

THis is the best tasting spinach pie i've ever made.  the only reason it doens't get 5 stars is because it's a pain in the butt to make because of the phyllo.

This is the best spinach pie i've made yet. it is as good as the one in the Greek restaurant that we love here. It took a little time but it was well worth it. I used Athens Filo and that part was very easy. THis is a keeper. THE three cheeses and cinnamon make it stand out. ThANK YOU!

I used 3 packs of frozen spinach and 9x13 pan. Didn't have an assortment of cheese but used around 400g pack of crumbled feta and 1/2 parmesano romano. Yum! My dude wanted to have layers so tried to add a phyllo layer in the middle, but as expected it didn't become crunchy since in between all the spinach.  Used my spray on olive oil instead of brushing it on the sheets, made it less messy :) 

Someone suggested to add some nutmeg next time and need to go get some FRESH dill. The dried one didn't make much of an impact on the taste.  But overall, we liked it and going to make it again :)

I only had 1 box of spinach, so I halved the recipe. I used mozzarella since I didn't have any Swiss, and pie crust since I didn't have phyllo, but kept everything else the same. This was so good! I imagine it's even better with the phyllo! Definitely making this recipe more often. Thank you!
