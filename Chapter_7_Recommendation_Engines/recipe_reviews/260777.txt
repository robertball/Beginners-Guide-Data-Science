I used beer instead of cider or apple juice (because I didn't have any apples, applesauce, or cider vinegar).

This was simple and good. I added a splash of apple cider vinegar to cut some of the sweetness as I am not one for sweet. Delicious.

Some prep beforehand but then it was a quick and easy recipe.  Everyone in my family really liked it.  I used red cabbage because that is what I had and it was very good.

Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I used unsweetened apple sauce to keep it from being too sweet. The one thing I did not care for was the caraway seed. It fits okay in the recipe but I've just realized I'm not a fan. This is a good recipe and one worth trying!
