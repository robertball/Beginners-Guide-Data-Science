This recipe was well written and concise.  My S.O. and I found it a delight with all the exotic spices.  I did make a few small changes such as adding a stalk of chopped celery, a bit of organic vegetable boullion and for his enjoyment, a chopped, browned, italian sausage.  Great job, Melanie!

This rocks!  I added 4 additional garlic cloves, a little extra of each spice, one jalapeno, and one dried thai chili 'cause I like it spicy!  Used canola oil because I didn't have ghee, neglected to add the cilantro, and added two roma tomatoes for variety.  Will be making this VERY frequently from now on.  Ate w/ homemade roti and mango chutney!

I only cooked this about 40 minutes and it was done, had to add some more liquid at the end.  I also would have chopped the onions much smaller and added about double the herbs, except the cilantro.  This was very good scooped up with naan.

this wasn't the best dahl recipe i have tried.  there was too much red onion and not much else.  also, it doesn't expain that the spices should be tempered and not just thrown in the pot.  and there is way too much water.  the lentils cook in much less time than the recipe calls for, so in 30 minutes you are left with all this water to be poured off.  if you do a google search for 'mum's every day red lentils' - you will get a much more indian variation.

I liked the spiciness of this thick soup!  I only cooked the lentils for 1/2 the time, and they were done.  This time, I used a yellow onion.  When I make this again, I'll use the red onion. Wonderful vegetarian meal!

I have made the recipe several times make just a few changes adding small red chili peppers in the water and removing them with the ginger and increasing some of the spices. My husband is from India and with those small changes he loves it. Thanks for sharing.

I liked this. I'd say that it could use a bit more flavor, but I just increased the amount of spices and I liked the end result better that way. I did add some chicken in, because I really felt like having a chicken and lentil soup tonight. It was very good. Thanks, Melanie!

Sorry for not liking this recipe, it doesn't have enough spices nor an indian touch, lentil soup is being cooked in the Midle East since ages and it's so close to your recipe, i don't understand what makes this an indian version. The 7 cups of water are not enough should be 10, u can see from the pic how thick the soup is like custard.

Tasty, hearty and healthy. My husband and I loved it. The lentils did not require a full hour - closer to 40 mins. Used butter instead of ghee. Love the simplicity and excellent results of this recipe. I highly recommend.

This was good just as written. I did not have red onion, so substituted yellow onions. 
 The second time I made it I used a little less water and cooked it until the lentils had fallen apart.  I added a couple of diced Serranos as I had an abundance of them.

This was not well received in my house.  I don't think it was the recipe just my families taste in food.  Thanks for the post.

I made it with half water and half of the homemade chicken broth and it is amazing! Lentils don't need to be cooked for more than 30 minutes, 40 at the most, otherwise they turn into much.

I forgot to take out the ginger which had been simmering with the lentils. It didn't seem to hurt the dish at all.

Serve with a spicy mango chutney - they really sing together!

I cook this often; usually let the onion and spices cook with the lentils for awhile for the flavors to blend in.
