Well, it was snowing outside and I wanted a comforting dessert and one to use up some ingredients I had sitting around. I made the version with dried cherries because I thought the pudding was a bit sweet and I do think the cherries helped with that.  Sorry, but I didn't have the specified coconut milk so I used a can of light (unsweetened) coconut milk. I could not taste any coconut flavor at all. The directions were perfect and the result was creamy. I doubt I would make this again, but I was glad to try it!

Fantastic! Just like mom used to make.  No it doesn't taste like coconut. It tastes like rice pudding, but is dairy free for anyone who has dairy intolerance but wants a creamy sweet treat.  I  used Jasmine rice, but often cook with brown rice and look forward to trying that next time.
