I love these cookies as does my entire family. I make a triple batch of them! I do a little different than the recipe. Instead of white sugar I use 1c brown, 1c confectioner's and 1c white with 3c peanut butter and 3 eggs. I like that the brown sugar gives them a little chewiness and the confectioner's cuts the white sugar so you don't get any gritty texture at all in these. It also stiffens the dough so they don't spread. You can do them with more confectioner's sugar if you like a really solid cookie. I also use a small scoop to form these and just put the flat side down on the cookies sheet-no rolling and rolling! Enjoy!

ExCELLENT. I took the advice of the first reviewer and used brown sugar, white sugar and the powdered sugar. OMG...these melt in your mouth. very chewy and awesome. they dont spread much at all. I have always had problems with peanut butter cookies spreading. By using the combination of sugars it made them not spread all over and chewy. great consistency. loved them. glad I used the advice of the reviewer.

Delicious!  I added 1/4 cup of flour to make it more chewy and the cookies came out great.  I'd definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe to make with my toddlers! I was a total skeptic about the final result, but they turned out yummy. Somehow ours made a lot more than the recipe said ~ we ended up with 21 big ones & 21 bite sized ones. For the little ones, we put a chocolate chip in the middle instead of a kiss. They are the perfect size for my 2 year old! The kids enjoyed measuring, mixing and rolling these into balls. We rolled them in sugar for added calories (well, mostly for appearance). One slight change I made was to take the pan out 2 minutes early, put the chocolate on and then finish baking. Very kid friendly & yummy recipe! Very, very little clean-up which is a HUGE plus!

HELPFUL TIPS IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: I love this recipe!  It looks elegant & best of all ...tastes great!  You really should unwrap the kisses ahead of time & keep them in freezer while the cookie bakes to eliminate them melting and looking yucky.  I also put the entire tray of cookies in the fridge for a bit after I've put the hershey kiss on top to help them set.  UPDATE: Okay, life gets busy!!!  I am all about making everything from scratch (heck, we make our own bread in this house), but with a zoo-filled household, sometimes I like to cheat.  Betty Crocker has little packages next to their cake mixes for peanut butter cookies (comes in red plastic).  You just add water, mix, and bake.  Well, they turn out identical AND hold together WAY BETTER the days after (you just have to add the kiss in the middle). A lot quicker if you want to double the recipe too.  Makes a bunch, and they can be stored at room temp whereas sometimes these don't always have thee same consistency several days after.  Just an idea for those in a rush!!!

With so little ingredients it is amazing how good these cookies are.  I did use chunky peanut butter in one batch and they were even better than the original.

this is an incredible cookie.  We found the recipe in a old old newspaper.  They used the flat chocolate stars instead of the hesheys kisses.  We love it with the star chocolates.  A must try cookie either way!!!!!!!!

This is the easiest cookie recipe ever!!  I listened to the other reviews and did the 1/3 of brown sugar, 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 powder sugar, and added 1/4 cup of flour.  I also used a bag of chocolate chips instead of the hershey kisses.  Because of the flour and powdered sugar the cookies won't spread, so when you make them, roll them into balls and flatten a bit with your hands.  Note:  when you mix the dough, it will look a bit crumbly, just roll it in your hands before you put it on the dish.  Bake ONLY for 10 minutes, max 12.  The edges won't brown but they'll be done.  I'm going to make this again and again and again.  They're really soft and chewy too!

I registered just to review this cookie!  Peanut Butter cookies have always been my nemesis, any kind, but specifically kiss cookies.  Well, they are my nemesis no more!  I have tried for years to make them, with no success..i couldnt ever get the kisses to stay ON the cookies!  I was so desperate to succeed I even consdiered super glue at one point..;). Finally I gave up, I was tired of wasting ingredients.  Then I stumbled upon this recipe, and figured I'd give it one last shot. I read every review, all 318 of them! TWICE!  and VOILA..I have finally slayed my Kiss Cookie Demons!  I followed the suggestions of all the slayers before me, and together we conquered.  So to all those who have never succeeded, take a chance, this recipe is no fail, IMO.  Thanks for the recipe and the many helpful suggestions!

I didn't have all the ingredients for the Hershey recipe and as this one was highly rated and looked so simple, decided to use. After reading many, many reviews, I made the batter with the three sugars: white, brown, confectionary, that had been recommended. Also, added the quarter cup of flour that some suggested. I did use a half teaspoon of vanilla to smooth out the taste. Then, I shaped the cookie dough into balls and rolled in granulated (white) sugar. I didn't find the dough crumbly, did not see a need to refrigerate before baking and did not flatten the dough prior to placing in the oven. Took them out at eight minutes, topped with the kisses, and let cool on the pan for another two minutes. Taste testers here give it five stars!

I was hesitant to try this one just because it seemed too easy to be true. But, they are a hit! I did the three different kinds of sugar as reviewers suggested and added just a little vanilla just because i'm into vanilla. So as i was pulling a failed batch of russian tea cakes (remembered to double everything but the flour...grrr) out of the oven, we noticed our dog, a Great Dane, over by the kiss cookies... half gone!! Good thing they are so easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe. Also, a tip, they don't spread at all so don't be shy about filling your cookie sheet up. Happy holidays!

Amazing!
I was attracted becuase it's gluten-free!
Follow 3 cups PB to 1cup white sugar, 1cup brown sugar, 1 cup powdered sugar.  
DON'T OVERBAKE!!  THEY BECOME HARD AS ROCKS!  Cook them JUST RIGHT and they're oh so soft.

Great recipe! One important word of advice that probably should have been in the original recipe - let the cookies cool on the pan!! The chocolate gets very melty and it will run all over your cookies if you try to move them before they are completely cooled.

As others suggested, I made these using 1/3C white sugar, 1/3C brown sugar and 1/3C confectioners sugar. I kept all else the same. GREAT taste, melt-in-your-mouth goodness! I also sprinkled some white sugar on them before baking. They could use another few minutes in the oven though - at 10 minutes, mine were a bit mushy in the middle. I think about 12 minutes would be perfect.

These don't taste exactly like the originals, but they are SO easy that it's totally forgivable!  I've made these dozens of times.  I've experimented with all types of sugar (1/3 of each brown/white/powdered, all white, half white/half brown)...  they turn out great every time.  And best of all, EASY EASY EASY!  No creaming butter/margarine/shortening.  Don't have to get out the beaters.  You can bake a batch of these in less than half an hour from start to finish with ingredients you already have in the cupboard.  Thumbs up for sure.

I doubled the recipe and used half brown, half white sugar and added in 1/4 cup of flour. Instead of kisses, I used peanut butter cups and these were a HUGE hit. I also only baked for 8 minutes because I like my cookies soft. YUM, very rich, but very good.

I have been making these without the kisses - as PB cookies since I was a kid. I've been adding the kisses to them for Christmas for many years. They are one cookie that'll always be on my list for Christmas. I roll them into balls and coat them in sugar before baking.

Doubled the batch, and used the 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 brown sugar, 1/3 powdered sugar.  Had to add a bit more powdered sugar to make the dough more stiff.  Refrigerated for about 10 minutes, rolling and shaping was easy, about 1-1.5" balls.  Came out chewy, very rich.  But something is still missing in the taste.  I wouldn't serve these to guests, as it tastes like kids made them.  Maybe next time I will try adding vanilla, or cinnamon, or try rolling the uncooked balls in sugar before baking.    UPDATE: The flavor really melds and mellows out the next day and by the second day, these are fabulous.  They stayed moist and edible for at least a week (in airtight container of course). The chocolate stayed soft as well, so careful with the stacking.  These cookies go wonderfully with a cup of coffee or glass of milk.

My daughter and I made these to put in holiday cookie tins to give as gifts and they turned out really cute. We took other's adive and used 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 powered sugar, and 1/3 brown sugar. We made a doulbe batch but ran out of kisses and used large chocolate chip and whatever chocolate we could find. They are deliocious especailly when warm. It was very easy too! Make sure your peanut butter isn't dried out or else the dough crumbles when you are shaping it. Great recipe!

i don't know why anyone would change this recipe!  You should never give a recipe a true rating unless you've tried it AS WRITTEN.  I made this one exactly as written and they're absolutely delicious!  The kids love them, and even my husband wants me to make them for his dart league pitch-in this Sunday!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

OMG. I was so skeptical because of the ingredients. Awesome. Imade a larger batch that consists of 1 cup each: confectioners' sugar, brown sugar, and white sugar. 3 eggs and 3 cups of peanut butter. baked 8 minutes..added my kiss and baked 2 more minutes.

This was good but I doctored it up a bit. I used half white/half brown sugar.  I added a bit of vanilla and enough flour to not make it so sticky.  I then rolled the balls in white sugar before baking.  They came out really yummy!

I followed the lead of the other reviewers, but I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and about 2 tablespoons of flour. I rolled the uncooked cookies in a bit of white sugar.  They came out perfect and are so easy.  They took less than 5 minutes to prepare. I just think you can't go wrong with these.  Easy and delish.

These were pretty good. They're made with sugar, so everyone should have known what they were getting into with regard to sweetness and texture :P I used the 3 kinds of sugar and organic natural peanut butter. I baked for 8 minutes, then added the kisses, then baked for 2 more minutes. I let them cool/harden for 2 minutes before putting them on a wire rack. They weren't extremely peanutty, but they were sweet easy to make. Next time I might try the more nutritious (and more complicated) version just to see what the difference is.

I made recipe as stated and it was a good cookie!  I bake over 50 dozen cookies (plus even more candies) as gifts during holidays so I have baked many cookies in the last 15-20 years.  These were simple, easy, and fast.  Couldn't ask for a better simple chocolate/peanut butter combination.    My batch made almost 3 dozen cookies.  Because I use Pampered Chef stones, I find my baking time generally takes 2-3 minutes longer on shorter baking times.  My first dozen I didn't add anything, my 2nd dozen when scooping I rolled in sugar.  both are great--for those thinking there is too much pb flavor you may want to try this method.  Takes away just a bit of the pb kick.  Or, you may want to try adding 1 tsp vanilla to your batch.   A friend of mine gave me a pb recipe like this once that used 1 egg, 1 cup br sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 c pb--and its a good recipe too.  No need to mix sugars like others have suggested.  Give this a try as is, I'm sure you will not be disappointed if you like peanut butter cookies! Also--FYI--only bake with a peanut butter that you like flavor wise.  Don't skimp on this, as it's a big reason why I believe one likes or dislikes the flavor of the peanut butter cookie--I've tried baking with brands I didn't like that were on sale, and in turn, didn't like my cookie.***Also want to add that I took these into work and everyone raved about them. ***

These cookies are VERY easy to make, and require few ingredients - wonderful for busy moms like me!  However, there really isn't much "substance" to these cookies.  They are too sweet and not very chewy.  Imagine eating peanut butter and sugar together - good for one small bite!  :)  Thanks, but I'm going to try a few others!

This recipe was super easy and the cookies came out great!  I made them for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he loved them.  I like soft cookies so I only baked them for the 10 minutes, but if you don't want them chewy I would bake them a little longer.

I love peanut butter cookies and I love chocolate. Now that I am gluten and dairy-free, this recipe is perfect for me. With little other ingredients you get the full flavor of the peanut butter. Don't skimp on the quality of the peanut butter. I use an organic crunchy type and dark brown sugar. I've also found dairy-free chocolate chunks. My teenage son who is not restricted by gluten or dairy loves these cookies too. He says "these are the best!"

Pressing the kiss into the cookie directly after taking it out of the oven somehow softens the kiss *just* enough so that it doesn't melt, but remains soft and creamy even after the cookie has cooled.

I would eat these all day, every day if i could. 

PERFECTION.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was a disaster!!!  I'll have to start out saying that the cookies did taste good, and were eaten very quickly!  Yet it was not worth the hassle.  When I first saw the recipe, I thought "wow, these seem too easy to be true!"  I went with another review and tripled the recipe and substituted the white sugar for 1 c white sugar, 1 c brown sugar, and 1 c confectionate sugar.  When I started to shape into balls, I realized that the cookies are just dripping with oil (I could actually squeeze them and oil would come out).  I started bake them, yet halfway through realized they weren't baking at all, so I had to flatten with a fork.  Before I knew what was happening, my house was full of smoke!  I was using a cookie sheet without edges and the oil had dripped in the oven.  I still had another 2 dozen or so cookies to bake, so I had to use fans throughout my house.  The cookies all turned more brown than I would have liked due to baking in so much oil.  I ended up spending all morning making these cookies and then having to scrape the bottom of my oven, so for me it wasn't "fast and easy".  All the other reviews are great, so I'm assuming I did something wrong!  Or it was that I used a store-brand peanut butter which just had a lot more oil in it.  But like I said earlier, they did taste good!

Are there better peanut butter cookie recipes?  Yes-- BUT, the simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so great.  You can add and change things like brown sugar, powdered sugar, flour, etc...but I love that this is a basic and EASY recipe that my five year old can help me with and I like the pure peanut butter taste of it.  Very good!

these were fantastic!!! I read other reviews and did 1/3 c. powdered sugar, 1/3 c. brown sugar, and 1/3 c. white sugar, and it turned out great!!! It made 20 for me, which was perfect. I cooked them for 11 minutes, but the top was still really doughy, and the bottom was brown, but it turned out ok because the browned part gave them a nice crunch in contrast to the chewy inside!!!! And I would also suggest waiting to serve for a couple of hours until chocolate kisses are cooled!!! The next batch I made i just did all white sugar and it still tasted AMAZING!!!! So the THIRD time I made them, I made little mini ones for a bridal shower and put chocolate chips in the middle!!! They were SO cute!!! About an inch in diameter!!! Thanks Sharon for this fabulous recipe that I will make again and again!!! So easy!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not press the dough ball down before baking unless you prefer the FLAT peanut butter cookie. The recipe has enough fat to make it spread by itself.
Simple ingridients and taste was good.

My dough was too sticky, but rather than putting it in the fridge for 30 min., I sprinkled a little powered sugar in.  They turned out perfect.  This is the easiest cookie ever, and they're so delicious!

Like another user said I triple this but use 1 part white sugar, 1 part confectioners sugar and 1 part brown sugar.  I roll the balls in white sugar before I bake them.

Wait about 4 minutes before putting the chocolate kisses in to help prevent them from melting. And as always use parchment paper for cookies that are easy to remove.

These are way good and the calories show it! I rolled my first batch into 1 inch balls, but realized if I kept that up, I'd be making a lot more than the recipes says. So, I made the 2nd batch of balls a little bigger. I do like the smaller balls though. They are more in porportion.

Im sorry to leave a bad review but these are just terrible! I make these every year and have the recipe saved in my recipe box, but for some reason this year when i opened the recipe it was this one, not the one i always use with brown sugar flour and shortening. I was confused at these ingredients to how they could possibly make a cookie..let alone one that would get such great reviews so my curiosity got the best of me and i decided to try these rather than  seek out the old reliable recipe my family loves each Christmas. im sorry i did. these are a greasy flat non rising flop! im waiting to see if MAYBE they're better the day after but i cant see how...save yourself the waste if you are used to the other kind of cookie, make it instead, i never ever write negative reviews but the day before christmas eve? thought id maybe save someone else from this disaster. gross!

I made this exactly as stated. It's been ~14 minutes and they are still soft to the touch in the oven and obviously not done baking. Not sure WHAT I did wrong..! I hope they turn out. Seems like everyone else did great with this recipe. :(

Well, they spread a lot. But they came out okay I guess. I would have liked it better if they had more height like the pic I saw for this recipe.

Fantastic! You can't go wrong with a recipe this easy and delicious. I used my smaller cooker scoop (1.5 Tbsp. size) to measure out the balls and got 20 cookies.

I made the triple batch with 1 cup of each kind of sugar and they were too sweet for anyone in my family's tastes. They all went to waste, I won't make them again. The recipe on the back of the Hershey Kiss bag is much, much better.

my husband previously banned me from baking cookies until i made this recipe.  i knew i had a winner when he told me they were the best cookies and i should sell them at bake sales.  the only thing i changed, based on others' recommendations, was i did 1/2c confectioners sugar & 1/2 white as well as 1/4c flour.  AMAZING!

Huge hit!! So delicious! So easy! My cookies are always bigger and, therefore, this recipe did not yield as many cookies as it should have so I double or triple the ingredients.

These cookies are so wonderful! They freeze well, they ship well, and they only have a few ingredients. Small children can help add the kisses to the tops.

I doubled this batch and followed the others' advice of using 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 brown sugar, and 1/3 confectioner's sugar. I also added a 1/3 c flour into the double batch. These cookies were delicious and moist and I had no trouble with the cookies spreading or running because of the peanut butter. They were gone in minutes and everyone loved them! Would definitely make again.

A friend of mine recommended these cookies, but I was a little skeptical that they were so easy. Nevertheless, I made them for a cookie contest at work and they won 1st place. I used dark chocolate Hershey kisses and these were the best cookies we've ever had! I did not roll the peanut butter "dough" in sugar, and combined with dark chocolate overall taste was not over-sugary like some have reported. I also put the kisses at 8 minute mark. They taste the most delicious when warm and chocolate is still gooey. When the chocolate hardens, you can microwave the cookies on high for exactly 20 seconds and the chocolate will melt, while still keeping shape. The dough does not get rubbery after microwaving.

I put the kiss on the cookie before I bake, that way the kiss is really soft, it still keeps its shape. Also instead of using kisses, sometimes I just sprinkle chocolate chips on top since I don't really like that much chocolate on a single cookie.

I tried this recipe and the cookies went FAST!  I changed the recipe slightly based on advise given from other reviewers.  I added 1/3 c. flour along with 1/3 c. powd. sugar, 1/3 c. brown sugar, and 1/3 c. white sugar.   These were very yummy!

Really easy and really good recipe. The main photo is deceiving though because you don't roll these in sugar. I baked mine on parchment paper because I've had lots of trouble in the past with peanut butter cookies burning, but these came out perfect this way. We made a double batch and ended up with 40 cookies.

This was extremely easy to make! And because there weren't very many ingredients i added a little of my own. I added 1/2 a tablespoon of Cinnamon and 1/2 a tablespoon of coco powder. I also put chocolate and peanut butter morsels in the batter since i didn't have any kisses. And if you want you can add cinnamon sugar when you take them out of the oven. They will taste amazing if you tweak the recipe like i did.

Delicious! Though, after reading all of the reviews, I did make a tweak or two. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I didn't have any powdered sugar. I also added some vanilla, about 1/2 teaspoon. And I added a 1/4 cup flour. I used Dark Chocolate kisses instead of milk. And I only baked them for 8 mins. They turned out perfect!

Pretty good!  Make sure you bake the cookie part long enough so that the cookies stay together.  I only used 1/2 the sugar and it wasn't too sweet at all.

I tried two versions of this cookie, both using the 3 different sugars recommendation from Dawn0001's review: First I used 3 parts sugar w/egg and peanut butter and baked for 10 minutes. These came out delicious, but a little undercooked and a bit too 'gooey' for my liking. Second batch, I did the same, but just added a heaping tablespoon of flour and baked for 12 minutes. These came out more 'cookie-like', still chewy and delicious! A friend of mine preferred the first batch and I preferred the second, so it really depends on how gooey you like your cookies. Thanks for the recipe! 5 stars

This recipe didn't come out at all for me.  I followed the original and was wondering why there was no flour in it.  When I took the cookies out of the oven they crumbled up when I put the chocolate kiss on top. I made a differend batch following the Land of Lakes recipe instead and they came out great.

Very very yummy. I added 1/4 cup flour to give them the chewy factor. They were awesome! They cracked alot when putting the kisses on. But they stayed together. Will totally be making these again! Way way to easy!

This is a great recipe for very popular cookie.  As recommended by other reviewers, I used 1/3 white, 1/3 brown and 1/3 confectioner's sugar, which resulted in a delightfully chewy, but not gritty cookie.

I give it 4* because I made this recipe as DAWN0001 suggested. Put the dough in the fridge for 45 mins. Used my small scooper then hand rolled them in a ball, to warm the dough back up, as it was a little crumbly. Then we rolled them in granulated sugar and baked for 12 1/2 minutes. From that recipe I got 51 cookies. These came out nice and soft and taste great!

My husband and daughter raved about these VERY EASY cookies. I did follow other reviewers advice and used 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 brown sugar, and 1/3 powdered sugar.

SO easy to make, literally 5 minutes, and yummy to eat.

Definately not for dieters!

These are amazing.  I took one reviewers suggestion and did 1/3 cup each of brown, white, and powdered sugar in place of the 1 cup white.  They are so super easy  and i know they will be gone very soon, so I will have to make more for the holidays!

Wonderfully quick and easy- do make double or even triple because they will go so fast!  I used chunky peanut butter and baked the second patch about 2 min longer.

so amazingly fast and a real crowd pleaser.  I've made a variation by using applesauce and baking powder instead of eggs and pressing the tines of the fork into the fresh cookies.  So wonderful, and versitile.  Also, I've used a caramel kiss in the center for a simple, decadent treat.

Despite the excellent reviews I was sceptical that a cookie recipe with so few ingredients could really work.  I'm happy to say, the reviews were right - these are fabulous cookies!  Wonderful peanut butter flavor, fantastic texture, and great even without the chocolate kiss!

These are delicious.  I could not understand how they could turn into a cookie with no flour (still can't!)... but they do...  I ended up doubling the recipe.  They are SO good and so easy :)

My suggestion is that you not use chunky peanut butter like I did. They don't look as nice. Also, I highly recommend chilling the mixture for a half hour and then scooping the balls with a melon baller.

I doubled the recipe, put 18 cookies on each baking sheet, put both sheets in the oven and baked 10 minutes at 375. Turned out perfectly and were delicious up to two days later (that's as long as they lasted!).

These little cookies have been in my family for years, in the form of a different recipe. I was ecstatic to find this one, it's gluten free! Becoming gluten sensitive in the past few years, this is a big thing.
Now, changes I made. I used dark chocolate kisses, no other reason than I like Dark chocolate. Any form of kisses would work.
 I made the cookies smaller than recommended. Once again, my preference of more chocolate to peanut butter ratio. Resulted in more cookies. 
I rolled the cookie dough balls in sugar before putting them on the baking sheet. Helps to keep them from sticking. 
These cookies seem to take longer to dry out verses other cookies. I think it's the peanut butter. All in all, I would (and will) make them again very soon!

I love these cookies as does my entire family. I make a triple batch of them! I do a little different than the recipe. Instead of white sugar I use 1c brown, 1c confectioner's and 1c white with 3c peanut butter and 3 eggs. I like that the brown sugar gives them a little chewiness and the confectioner's cuts the white sugar so you don't get any gritty texture at all in these. It also stiffens the dough so they don't spread. You can do them with more confectioner's sugar if you like a really solid cookie. I also use a small scoop to form these and just put the flat side down on the cookies sheet-no rolling and rolling! Enjoy!

I wondered with so few ingredients but they turned out perfect. The dough wasn't too sticky and I rolled them right away. What took the most time was unwrapping the kisses. I doubled the recipe because I knew they'd disappear if they were good and was glad I did. I got more that 36 cookies when I doubled. Yeah! This one's a keeper!

Quick, easy and fun.  What is not to like?  Kids love them and so do the grown-ups.  I used 3 types of sugar.  I baked them on a cookie sheet, using parchment paper so the cookies would not stick.

I love the combo of peanutbutter and chocolate! That is why I tried these. My first batch was so yummy it went way to fast. The second batch came out different....hmm so this is what I found. My first batch was wetter, just barely able to mold into a ball. These are the ones that were so yummy. My second batch came out drier and left me wondering why, once they were baked they were still good, but not spectacular like the first batch had been. Used large egg in both. But I believe my problem batch I over did the sugar. My third batch I went just scant on the sugars (which I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown). Back to YUMMY! So don't let the wet batter fool you. It's going to come out GREAT. Either way they are good cookie.

These are very plain. If anyone wants a better recipe for peanut butter cookies, check out my recipe box. They are the St. Patrick Shamrock Cookies, and they taste much better than these tasteless cookies.

We had a sweet tooth last night after dinner and I did not want to do a lot of work so I tried this recipe out. I did a double batch with half brown sugar and half white sugar. They cooked very quickly, so due to that I would make them again.

I made these for part of my New Years' buffet, and they were a hit! Just a note -- really stick to the size indicated or your peanut butter to chocolate ratio will be off. Also, I added 1/2 a tablespoon of vegetable oil to a double batch of dough to make sure they stayed nice and moist, and that was one of the biggest compliments I received that night: how nice and moist the cookies were.

I also used the combination of three sugars and this recipe turned out awesome for me. Some of my cookies spread a little so I ate those instead of gifting them and they were delicious! This was perfect for me being gluten free!

I used the triple recipe suggestion with 1 cup each of brown, white and confectioners sugar and it turned out nicely.  I baked for 12 min though.

I'm torn about how to rate this recipe.  I love the simplicity of ingredients and after they sit for a day or two, they taste great.  However, they crack ferociously when you put on the kiss - I lost about a quarter of my cookies during this process.  They are worth making again, but next time I'll add flour to see if that helps with breaking.

We couldn't stop eating these! We followed others' suggestions and used equal parts confectioner's sugar, white sugar, and brown sugar. After a day, these cookies were perfection: melt in your mouth peanut buttery, and decadent. We didn't use flour as we wanted them to be gluten-free. Awesome cookie!!!

A bit sweet if you are expecting it to be like a regular peanut butter cookie.   The cookies were real simple and fun  to make.   I used organic peanut butter.  I added a Tablespoon of Olive oil since I guessed this recipe was made with regular peanut butter,  most leading  brands  like Jiffy are less than 90 percent peanuts and rest is extra oils and sugar.   The cookies were easy to form into balls, held up nice baking.    I did do as others mentioned and split the sugar with brown sugar and a touch of confection sugar added up to make 1 cup, I think they would be fine either way though.   Be careful pushing the kiss on top, if you push them into far the cookie may split up too much.    It was a beautiful looking batch of cookies, my son likes them.  They were  too sugary for me, but if you like  sweet treats than this is a nice and easy recipe.  If I make them again, I will try the dark chocolate kisses, to make them a touch less sweet.

These are the easiest cookies in the world to make.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add 1/4 cup of flour to the dough.  It made it very easy to handle and not sticky at all.  To make things even easier for myself, I used a small cookie scoop to form the dough balls.  Also, to make them look more festive, I rolled the dough balls in red and green sugar before baking.  So cute, and SO easy!

Very good! Will keep this recipe and make it again. So quick and easy to make with just three ingredients. It doesn't make many, so next time I'll double the recipe. And.... if you can keep your DH from eating the kisses before the cookies are baked, your're lucky.

Pretty good for simple cookies.  I did use crunchy peanut butter, for no other reason than that is what we had an open jar of in the cupboard.  I doubled it and did half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I like how that made the cookies look and taste.  Very good, thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good and simple cookie. My only tweak was changing white sugar to brown sugar and adding about 1/4 c of semi sweet chocolate chips. Overall a very good cookie for beginners like me. Love them.

This is delicious! My son don't like sugary things, so he refuses to eat them, but my daughter loves them so does my fiance, and of course myself! I gave my grandma the recipe and My sister says "These are my FAVORITE cookies!!", My little brother says to "Save him some!", Overall GREAT peanut butter taste and the chocolate kiss in the middle compliments very well. We absolutely LOVE these, their easy to make, quick, and simply ingredients! Great Job!!

These are so easy that I made them in the morning before work. They make a very nice presentation. However I used a cookie scoop instead of rolling them into balls, so they cracked quite a bit. Everyone still loved them. I recommend baking on parchment paper so they can be removed easily once they cool.

Wow. I'm a little surprised at the high reviews for this recipe. The ingredients seemed odd, but I decided to give it a try. They are incredibly easy to make, I'll admit, but I just don't think they are very good... I suppose if you think of them more as candy than cookies, they may seem a little better.

I did follow some suggestions from other reviewers and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and added 1/4 cup flour, so my rating can be taken with a grain of salt.

My dough was not sticky at all. Rather, it was dark and very crumbly. I had to squeeze it together to form balls that would easily fall apart. Per some reviewers comments that the bottoms burned, I chose to bake these at a slightly lower temperature of 325 for about 15 minutes. No burning occurred. The cookies barely changed in consistency from dough to cooked cookie, so that was a little weird. After pushing the kisses in, they became pretty cracked and crumbly, and certainly weren't as pretty as some of the pictures. They ended up being very sweet and dense--which was pretty much what I expected from such simple ingredients. I guess I was just hoping I'd be proved wrong in the end!

I will say, they tasted fine. They tasted like sweet peanut butter and chocolate. And I do like the combination, so these will definitely get eaten. However, I will not make them again--especially not for company.

Those are sinfully delicious! Unlike most cookies these are even better cooled! I used the three different sugars as suggested by one of the reviewers and instead of the regular hershey's kisses I used the caramel filled kisses. I cannot believe how easy they were to make and how beautiful they looked!

They are ok, but you can't beat the original recipe. I did try this recipe before Christmas and without telling my daughter how I made them, she tasted it and said, "Mom, you can't mess with recipes at Christmas!" (in other words no shortcuts). I also divided the sugar to half white and half brown sugar. All this said, if I had a major craving and no flour or time, I would make this recipe again.

I followed the recipe and a couple suggestions. I added 1 cup of powdered sugar & 1 additional cup of peanut butter. 2 eggs (1 per cup of each type of sugar). I also baked an extra 3 minutes or so. Delicious cookies. Made them for all my neighbors, family, & friends. They were a hit every time.

Since I also revised this recipe, I feel it is hard to give an accurate rating. I added the the confectioners sugar and brown sugar, as well as the extra eggs & peanut butter. Kind of Gross, is how I felt these cookies turned out! To me it's like simply eating a mix of sugars & peanut butter...

My daughter just made these "cookies" and they are NOT, I repeat are NOT cookies. I would give them no stars if I could. We are now trying to make something workable with the concoction we now have.

These cookies did NOT come out like the peanut butter kiss cookies in the picture.  I have made a similar recipe before with more ingredients (including an oatmeal-based dough) which came out great and I wanted to try this simple recipe instead.  First, I had to refrigerate the dough for a few hours so that it was not too sticky or greasy to handle.  After the first batch did not turn out successfully, I tried adding some flour as reviewers suggested and then baking powder but the end result was still extremely disappointing.  I will never make this recipe again and rather stick to my baking instincts with a real cookie recipe that has more than just 3 ingredients.

If it seems to good to be true it probably is, Three ingredients does not a cookie make. After four minutes of baking the bottoms were already burned.

If you want simple and delicious, you can't go wrong.  My 5-year old daughter helped me make these and she had a blast rolling these and pressing the kisses into the cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly as is, using Natural Jif and they turned out great.  About to make another batch with Hershey's dark kisses!

Very good and easy to follow. I doubled the recipe.  I took a lot of previous reviewers advice...used equal parts white/brown/confectioners sugar.   Everyone at my house is gobbling them up!

These cookies are great! I made them with a heavier peanut butter (Smuckers Natural). I found the recipe yielded more cookies than it stated. I tripled the batch and had over 6 dozen cookies. I would highly reccomend this recipe, it's very easy to make, and tastes great! Next time, I'm going to try rolling the balls of dough in sugar before baking.

My family LOVES these cookies, we use whatever chocolate candies we have on hand...dove promises are FABULOUS in place of the kiss. I make exactly as the recipe calls for, no need to substitute 3 different sugars. Best, easiest recipe to remember by heart.

These were fantastic & SO easy! Be sure to put in the kiss in while they are still warm. Great recipe! No need for those cookie "tubes" from the frozen section. This is cheaper and just as easy & delicious.

I try to have an open mind and not give negative ratings; I made this recipe based on the ratings - however I won't make it again.  The consistency of the dough is odd, and the cookies bake up looking very dark and crumbly (as was the dough).  After the first pan I had to look through the pictures people posted of their results, to see if it was just my batch or if others turned out looking the same way mine did.  There were some pictures with some flat spread out cookies - definately not what I have with this recipe!  I added some water to the dough, it was so crumbly when mixing.  When baking, the oil was running out of the cookies, all over the pan.  I think the result of not having any flour in the mix. The 'blossoms' turned out in nice ball shapes, and after pushing a kiss into the center of each, they look very nice, yet because they are somewhat crumbly, I was trying to reshape them a bit, so as they didn't totally fall apart. After completely cooling, the cookies do set up becoming pretty firm and not as fragile as they appear to be when first done.  The doughy look is deceiving, so I cooked mine a little longer which resulted in pretty dark bottoms. The taste is good, but I think I prefer the taste of the standard cookie which has flour and baking powder in the recipe.  My husband has so far avoided trying them, going for the other standard recipes I'm making in my baking this season.  I hope he tries one eventually, I can't eat them all on my own or toss them.

Hmm, interesting. Way easy to make, but so rich, not like other kiss cookies I've made. But, for a quick recipe, this fit the bill. flavor was very good, just too rich.

I used the same recipe but used icing sugar (thought it would be easier to cream by hand) and 1 cup of Skippy's creamy pb, 1 egg. The dough was so stiff I added 3 tablespoons of milk to make it more malleable, then thought better of it when I got a liquidy dough and added about 1/4 cup plain flour.  The taste is okay (that's the 3 stars) but it was a nightmare to handle, super oily- there were small puddles of oil beneath each cookie when I removed them from the parchment sheet! And so sticky that my fork stuck to the dough,lol...now they look like hockey pucks and I could break my teeth on them!     What happened? I'm guessing its the icing sugar that made the cookies rock hard but why the excessive oil? *very newbie cook here*

Meh. These were "OK." Don't get me wrong... I've had cookies like these before and LOVED them. Unfortunately, the texture of this recipe was off (compared to what I've had before). The cookies I remember were firmer, yet still yummy-chewy and they STAYED chewy. My batch was very soft, even though I followed top reviewer Dawn's suggestion to use a combination of granulated, confectioner's and brown sugars (I also tripled my batch, but now wish I wouldn't have...).  Another complaint of mine is that these are waaaay too peanut buttery (and I like peanut butter!). The cookies I had before definitely had a peanut butter taste, but not as much of one. I ended up having to chill my dough for 30 minutes due to it being too sticky to work with, and then using my small Pampered Chef scoop to form each cookie, rolling each 'ball' for uniformity and then dipping the tops in granulated sugar just as I remember them. I baked my first batch for 10 minutes and they were not done at all, so in the garbage they went. :( I baked my second batch for 12 minutes and those turned out much better. And, btw, my cookies spread slightly, so I DON't suggest trying to fit 20 cookies on a single sheet lol! My fiance always says, "There's no point in making any cookie other than chocolate chip unless it tastes better or just as good." These certainly don't compare and he agrees (sorry!), so my search for the perfect cookie continues.... Thanks for sharing anwyays. :)

Great recipe!  Brought them into work for Valentine's snack - everyone loved them!  As suggested by other chefs here I added a bit of flour and ensured that the cookies sat on the cookie sheet to cool for a minimum of 5 minutes before removing to cooling rack.  Thank you for sharing!

I really should have followed my instincts and found a different recipe.  After following the directions, I moved these cookies to a cooling rack, where they promptly fell through it.  They were ridiculously underdone - forget about eating them at that point.  So, after they'd all gotten their kisses, back into the oven they went for another 10 minutes.  STILL not completely done.  I don't even want to look at the rest of the dough in the fridge, much less eat the ones that have been through the oven.  I won't be making this recipe again.

Outstanding! Be sure to use brown sugar & powdered sugar in addition to the white sugar, just as the first couple of reviews suggest. I was never a big fan of this cookie when I was growing up, because my family makes them with flour; but they're my boyfriend's favorite, so I gave them a try. This flour-less version is just wonderful! Nice, moist & chewy instead of dry and flavorless. They're great even if you run out of chocolate kisses (like I did!).

These are good but I prefer the recipes that include flour, vanilla , etc.   These were a little too sweet and fell apart easily even after adding 1/4 c. flour as some reviews recommended

Delicious and easy!! I was actually doing a search for the traditional peanut butter kiss cookie, but when I came across this recipe I was happy to see that it was gluten free. My son's girlfriend is allergic to wheat flour, so this was the perfect cookie recipe to make for Christmas. Followed recipe exactly, be sure to not overbake.

I also added 1/4 cup flour to mine, and the dough was much easier to work with, and they taste delicious; did not dry them out at all.

So easy to make or store the dough for later. Very good looking cookies. I made a few with three mini chocolate chips and it was also very cute. Next time I will try with a little less white sugar and definitely with unsweetened peanut butter.

I added about a tablespoon of flour, plus did the powdered sugar, brown sugar, white sugar split.  They turned out perfect and were a huge hit.

Surprisingly the best PB cookies i've ever had.  Not to mention the EASIEST.  I made these for Christmas last year...they were gone before dinner started.  I had so many compliments.  I will definately be making them again this year!

These cookies were AWESOME! I used the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used the 1/3c sugar, 1/3c brown sugar and 1/3c confectioners' sugar. Also, stuck our kisses in the freezer while these were baking and we didnt have a problem with them melting. My daughter and I loved making these together! A Keeper!!!

I love to bake with the kids but sometimes they get bored with all the ingredients needed in a lot of cookie recipes.  This recipe rocks!  It was so easy to make & cleanup was a breeze.  Not to mention the cookies were delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

Super easy to make and everyone LOVED them at my Christmas Party.  I would definitely recommend unwrapping the kisses and freezing them in the bag for about an hour before baking.

Decent! I used less sugar than recipe called for and was still a bit too sweet but giving it 4 stars because it was super easy, quick, and used just a few ingredients.

These were terrific and so easy. I served them at our Christmas party last night and about three people said, "Oh, I LOVE THESE," when they saw them on the cookie tray.  I will make this year after year.

At the advice of one of your reviewers, I also used 1 c. each of white, brown, and powdered sugar.  Omitted the kisses (cuz I didn't have any).  Yummy!  Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I will add the kisses next time.  Thanks for sharing.

needed to bake longer then 10 min as cookies were still really soft. I baked for 12min and then they had to set up on the backing pan for another 10 min or so as they would fall apart if you tried to move them before sitting for a bit. I used the same part qhite and part brown sugar as others suggested. Abit on the sweet side. Maybe use less sugar next time. I also added 1/2 c of flour to make the dough more firm. Good recipe for baking with the little people in the family :-)
Will make again.

Fresh out of the oven, it's impossible to eat one without a glass of milk. I personally think they are better the second or third day, when they are not quite so unbearably mouth-gooey. I also found them a bit grainy from the sugar.

Excellent!!!  Took the advice of those who said use 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar and I added the 1/4 c. flour.  These were awesome and easy, my 20 mth old poured everything but the pb and egg and loved every second.  Very easy and neat for the little ones to be able to help and delicious outcome!!!

This recipe will surprise you. Well I was. I didnt expect it to have a cookie taste with just peanut butter and no flour base.  My husband is a peanut butter freak and he freaked out when he ate this. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I like my cookies crispy on the outside and soft in the inside so I baked it for 15-20 minutes. I think the cookie will be gooey if you dont bake it long enough, as one reviewer complained about. Perfect little treat for sweet tooths!

Good cookie, dense and rich.  The cookie recipe itself is not a new one for me but I hadn't seen it with a kiss before and it really added to the appeal for people who hadn't tasted the plain ones.  The tip of my kisses burned because I baked them because I didn't read the instructions closely enough, I guess that'll teach me. :)

This recipe deserves 5 stars and is a keeper. I won't ever make another P-nut Butter Cookie. These vanished yesterday after I made them to take along to friends for a BBQ. I had no real problem with the recipe but next time I will use my Kitchenaid Mixer. It was difficult by hand but not the recipes fault, my own. My P-nut butter was quite cold from storage in the garage which actually lent to my dough not being soft when done at all, and needed no chilling, balled up very nicely. I rolled them in Turbinado sugar before baking, and poked the Kiss point down...seems to hold better that way. I did use both Reg Kisses, and Truffle Kisses...the Truffle kisses melted into a circle and took a long time to set back up. I dont wait until the cookies are baked then add the kisses, I get er done before I bake them. I did use the 3 sugars, tripled the recipe, and glad I did. I put back  about 1/2 the dough wrapped in wax paper to bake later. Thanks for this great recipe.

i took the advice of one reviewer who used a combination of brown sugar, white sugar, and powdered sugar.  the results were fantastic!  the cookies were still extrememly soft and chewy even after being frozen for two weeks.  will keep this recipe and use again!!

These were REALLY easy to make. But be aware, this is basically peanut butter flavored sugar. These cookies were REALLY SUPER MEGA sweet.

Wonderful cookie recipe!  My 4-yr-old son had a blast helping me to make them.  Very easy.  I baked mine on a stone and needed to add 2 minutes baking time.

Looks nothing like the picture.  They spread out when baked.  Needed to add more flour and refrigerated longer.  Tastes great.

By golly, it worked! Had my doubts with only three ingredients. I made mine small (2 bites) and got 35 cookies out of one batch! I also baked them 2 minutes longer than suggested. It's a keeper!

Made these with my 9-year-old and we LOVED them! The cookies are very rich and dense. When you take them out after 10 minutes, they are very soft, but they do firm up a little as they cool, and the chocolate melts right away. The kids did most of the assembly themselves, which was fun!

Very good and sooooo easy!  I set the kids to work on unwrapping all the kisses and then they pushed them into the finished cookies.  This was a great cooking project for my 6 yr. olds.

Fantastic!  As good as they look.  Simple, straight-forward recipe that makes a classic.  Made them for 2018 Christmas cookie trays and will do so again in 2019.  Just perfect cookies.

The only substitution I made was to roll the balls in more sugar. These do not taste like the classic variety. They are okay but I would not make them again. They taste eggy. Not quite right.

Added more natural peanut butter. The oil helped with moisture.  They were pretty good. I made these because they were gluten free and quick.

I followed some of the review suggestions and used 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar, and 1/3 c confectioner's.  Actually, I made a triple batch, but that's the ration I used. :) These were a big hit!

These came out perfectly for me! My family loves them.

But I do have a rather silly question. The recipe yields 18 cookies so two per person which equals the serving size of 9. My question is, does the Nutrition value of 311 calories equal the two cookies, or is that just for one? I'm trying to determine what my Weight Watchers value for this would be. 

I appreciate anyone's response!

I've never liked these cookies and my boyfriend begged me to make some for Christmas.  I found this recipe and its absolutely fantastic!  So delicious. I made my own peanut butter in the bulk food department of the grocery store.  Fresh and flavorful.  I used half icing sugar and half brown sugar.  Rolled in sugar crystals before putting kisses on top.  Beautiful, easy and devour able!

Used a third cup white, brown, powdered sugar as suggested by many. Natural peanut butter which I've been trying to get rid of for a long time. Cookies are easy to make but think they'll be better with regular peanut butter. the texture is just kind if weird and pasty, probably due to the natural peanut butter. Looking forward to trying to make these again. Also it takes a long time for them to cool down apparently. It's been about an hour now and the kisses are still soft and melty!

It looked good, but wasn't as good as the full, more involved peanut butter kiss recipe. It is great for kids who can't cook yet. I was disappointed and will go back to my normal recipe.

This was the best peanut butter kiss cookie I have ever made. Easy, yummy and they stay soft and chewy! I did the 3 types of sugars in my recipe! I also baked them only 10 minutes in a preheated oven at 350..They turned out beautiful! I will try the chunky peanut butter next batch!

Baked this recipe last night with my 12 year old. It was so simple! Followed the advice of tripling the recipe and I'm glad we did! With 5 children at Christmas….well…I'm sure you understand...I used the 3 kinds of sugar and added 1/4 cup of flour to make it less sticky. I also added an additional minute on the cooking time and it was perfect. We used the chocolate stars instead of the kisses and they looked so pretty on the cookie tray. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the suggestion of splitting the sugar between brown, powdered, and granulated. This TOTALLY rocked! consistency is awesome, no crumbling or spreading out. Best version of this cookie ever!

Very simple and perfect recipe. I too did what the original rater suggested by using a combination of confectioners, brown, and white sugars. They did not go flat like most peanut butter cookies.

Years ago, I had a neighbor who made these and gave me this recipe. I liked it ok, but haven't made it in years. So when I did it this time, I followed a few suggestions by other reviewers. I used 1/3 c white granulated sugar, 1/3 c light brown sugar, 1/3 c powdered confectioners sugar.I also added 1/8 (aprox) c flour. Rolled them in sugar, pressed down just a bit. Let them cook, added the chocolate the last 3 min. Not sure the cook time bc I forgot to set the timer. But they were very very good! Will definitely make these again, with the changes. (Simply bc I have made the original recipe quite a few times in the past, I knew what it was like and wanted to improve on it, especially texture-wise. The changes did the trick!)5 stars with the changes.

These were great - - the second time I made them.  Unfortunately, I used natural unsweetened peanut butter (with the oil on top) for the first batch and they turned out horrible: didn't bake up and were doughy and dry.  I changed to regular old store brand creamy peanut butter and they were fabulous the second time around.  I also used the trick from other reviewers to use 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 white, brown and confectionery sugar.  I rolled in sugar before baking and prefroze my Hershey kisses.  Yummy and easy!

I made these with the three types of sugar as suggested, but found them too sweet and sort of oily. perhaps because I used real peanut butter instead of hydrogenated peanut spread? Made these to accompany a thank you note, but seems like a waste of ingredients and three hours. As a gluten-free, flourless recipe this would be okay, but for the average diet I'm sure there are better out there.

Caveat: I modified this recipe. If I hadn't, it's possible the cookies would have been great.
I doubled the recipe; added 3 equal portions of powdered sugar, white sugar, and brown sugar; gave it 40m in the fridge, and it came out sticky and too moist. I added about 1/4 c. flour, and it was still very sticky, but a little easier to shape.
They came out flat (~1/2" thick) and chewy. They stuck to the pan - I would lightly grease it next time. They were too sweet (possibly the powdered sugar?) and overall, three stars is somewhat for taste, mostly for ease, but nothing very remarkable. Again, IF I tried this over, I'd stick to the recipe, and maybe just sub a little brown sugar.

This is my favorite cookie recipe - easy and delicious!  Instead of kisses I add semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter before baking. I do recommend cutting the sugar down just a tad (a little too sweet for me), though you have to be careful that the batter doesn't get too sticky.

I trippled it just like the other review suggested and it was the best cookies we've ever had!!! I too, used the 3, 3, and 3. One cup white sugar, one cup powdered sugar, one cup brown sugar, and then the 3 eggs, and 3 cups sugar. We used the white chocolate covered kisses, and I put them on the minute the cookies came out of the oven. It made them melt down, and OOOOOOhhhh were these fantasitc!!!!

This is a great, quick recipe! I did make some of the recommended changes others have mentioned. I did half white sugar/half brown (didn't do the confectioners sugar out of laziness) and added 1/4 cup flour. Did 1 oz cookies and the cook time was perfect. This recipe doesn't taste as good as the regular recipe, but it's not bad and is worth making when time and convenience are a factor.  It's not something I'd take somewhere, but it's perfect for a quick treat at home with the family. I also like that this doesn't make a huge amount of cookies...it's great for that quick fix when you get that sudden cookie or chocolate urge. It's also a great recipe for kids! Before baking, I used the back of my scoop to slightly flatten the cookie and then pressed down lightly in the center so there is a small groove in the middle of the cookie. This made a perfect spot for the chocolate to melt without it melting all over the place.

These cookie are ridiculously easy to make and taste great!  I followed another member's advice about mixing 1/3 C powdered, 1/3 C granulated and 1/3 C brown sugar instead of just 1C granulated and it tastes wonderful!  
     The one thing I would say is that they are quite dry, but I suppose that's what milk is for :D Also, the addition if sprinkling some granulated sugar on top after baking makes a world of difference.
     Overall, I will DEFINIETLY make these again!  Quick, easy, delicious!

While I still prefer the taste of the regular peanut butter cookie version, this was still very good and VERY easy!  It was a great project with my 6 and 7 year old boys.  I followed the recipe as is, but I think next time I will add some flour as suggested by some of the other reviewers.

These things were easy and delicious! My only problem is that 10 minutes was not enough time so I had to trial and error a few times to get them to stay in cookie form. They needed at least 12 minutes. But maybe I just used a peanut butter that was too oily... I don't know. But theyre mega fun to make and easy and delish!

These are killer good! I used the tip from the first review and used 1/3 cup of powdered, brown, and regular sugar and they are chewy peanut buttery brilliance! I also had a few mini dark chocolate peanut butter cups laying around and froze them before i inserted them into the middle like the kisses. Absolutely wonderful! Thank you so much for this post! I am also planning on making regular peanut butter cookies with this recipe. It is now my staple peanut butter cookie recipe! : )

I did not care for this recipe at all.  I say stick with the Jif recipe or your other favorite.  The dough was very crumbly and the cookie did not have enough flavor for me.

Every year, I bake these cookies for our family Christmas party. Every year I look online for a different recipe, but they're all basically the same. This year, I used this recipe, and it is definitely fantastic. However, you do have to love peanut butter especially in cookies to enjoy this recipe, though. Peanut butter and chocolate are my favorite, so I definitely love these cookies and they were enjoyed by many other people. One of my favs.

Definetly wait 3-4, or even longer before adding your chocolate. I used Reese's peanut butter cups on some, and Reese's pieces on some. Very yummy and good for days later.

These cookies were delish and super easy to make! I added 1/4cup flour and used 1/2cup brown sugar plus 1/2cup white sugar, and 1tsp vanilla extract. They turned out perfectly!

i have just baked my peanut butter kiss cookies (and i am enjoying one right now!) they are fabulous!!! usually i am not a peanut butter fan but these are simply delishous for anyone. my one tip is  to make sure that you don't press your thumb into the cookie too hard or else it will bake unevenly

I love this recipe because its so simple. I love how simple it is because you can add your own special touches and its still simple. I also tried it with chuncky peanutbutter and that really good too.  I also tried it with 1/4 C. honey and left off the kisses and that was really tasty as well the honey ones i had to bake on a light pan though because a dark pan they baked to fast.

What a easy recipe and the cookies are ready in 15 mins!!! What I would recommend is to cut may be a half cup of sugar since it's a bit too sweet for me! other than that...pretty and tasty cookies I would highly recommend for friends!

These are very easy and quick to make!  The amounts of ingredients created a perfect consistency, so I didn't need to do the refrigeration step.  I also used Reese's peanut cups for variety, which I thought made them better than the kiss.  So good. :)  To answer the previous reviewers (Epotts) question, don't press the kiss all the way down into the cookie or it will crumble.  Light pressure about half way down is all you need.  The chocolate will melt snuggly into the cookie.

These were great and so easy to make!  I did use equal parts brown, white and confectionary sugar as well as all natural (no sugar added) peanut butter.  They pretty much melt in your mouth! :)

These cookies are AWESOME!!!  Recipe is super simple, incredible quick to make, and Gluten-free as long as peanut butter you use is such.  No need to change much to improve recipe; just use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar (maybe slightly less than recipe calls for if you find them too sweet) and 1 teasp of vanilla.  I put chocolate kisses on them before baking and chilled them in fridge for 30-60 min or more before baking.  They were BEAUTIFUL and PERFECT!!!!!

I made these cookies and I took the review advice and did 1 cup of white sugar 1cup of brown and 1 cup of powderd sugar and I have to say I then rolled them in raw sugar before I cooked them and They were really SWEET.  I am trying a different peanut butter recipe today but for minimal ingredients I say this is a great recipe.

these cookies were easy and yummy. i took the advice of the reviewer who used 1/3 confectioners, 1/3 brown and 1/3 white sugar.  i just can't give it 5 stars b/c it's basically eating a scooper full of sugar in each cookie - scary!

These cookies are great! They are rich, but that should be expected since there isn't any flour used. I followed the recipe exactly (I think that is the only fair way to rate a recipe), the only think I did differently was add 1 tsp vanilla. I refrigerated the dough for a full 30 minutes to help form the dough into balls easier. Also, I rolled them in sugar before baking just for a nice decorative touch. Simple recipe using only a few ingredients!

So easy and so yummy!  I followed a fellow reviewer and took them out at eight minutes, pushed in the kisses, and then finished baking.  The chocolate melts in your mouth!  Super Yummy!

These cookies are phenomenal!! Not only are they chewy and delicious but they only ask for 3 ingredients.  I recommend having more peanut butter though.

very good cookies, but be sure to refrigerate the dough first. They are hard to get off the sheet otherwise.

These were easy and very good. Took them to a party and they were a hit. I've made them twice. Mine looked EXACTLY like the photo. I used all nutural peanut butter and they were picture perfect.

My boyfriend said that they taste just like the way his mother makes them, which is to say, very good. They're a bit too sweet for my taste so another time I'll use a bit less sugar. Otherwise, really easy and quick!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect... I don't ever bake but you really can't mess up this simple recipe! I let it sit for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet and then moved it to a cooling rack.  But, the chocolate took longer than I anticipated to harden so I'd give yourself some time... At least 2 hours!

Easiest, softest, yummiest cookies I could possibly make and I am a die-hard chocolate chip cookie fan! I made these yesterday as a last minute (literally!) treat for my daughter's class. I used the recommendations of dividing the white sugar by thirds, using 1/3 brown sugar, 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 confectioner's sugar. So, when I made it using the recipe as written, it became 1/3 cup of each. That was yesterday. My husband loved these so much he volunteered me to make these for a work function of his, tomorrow. (If these weren't so easy, I would have been mad! LOL) Today I'm tripling the recipe, thus 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, etc. These are awesome cookies and will be a regular in our home.

I also used 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 1/3 cup confectioner's sugar. WOW! These cookies are super rich! That's actually a good thing, because they are sort of small.  I love these and make them for holiday get togethers.  They are very easy and fast, but they taste fantastic. I will say that I did underbake my cookies a little bit, because I found that they tend to dry up a little as they cool.  I also press the chocolate kiss pretty deep in to the cookie so that it doesn't fall out. Delicious!

great recipe to use up leftover kisses from xmas. this makes a very sweet version but i liked it because you could actually taste the peanut butter. much easier than the other ones and fewer ingredients. i used equal parts white, powdered, and brown sugar and it did NOT need flour. i baked this w/ parchment and w/o. both turned out fine. mine were done after 10 mins.  give them 5 mins on the cookie sheet before cooling them on the rack to allow them to set or they will fall apart as any peanut butter cookie. i would not recommend rolling these in additional sugar as other recipes suggest. next time i may try this w/ dark chocolate kisses to help reduce the sweetness.

I followed all the suggestions made: used 1/3 each granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, and confectioner's sugar. Also added slightly less than 1/4 cup white flour.  I also used Skippy's Natural peanut butter and used slightly more than a cup.  It was nice to skip the hydrogenated oil altogether! I also rolled them in granulated sugar which isn't mentioned in the recipe, but shown in the picture.  I kept them in for 12 minutes. I might use light brown sugar next time or leave them slightly less time since they tasted ever so slightly over done.  However, our kids loved them, and they were SO easy to make.

Too sweet for us. Family voted and we decided not to make them anymore.  Joey's peanut butter cookies found on this site was a much bigger hit.  I've probably made 6 batches of those in the past week. Expecting the same wild reception, made a double batch of these.  One family member said, "the presentation is good, though." This would be a good and easy recipe to take to a function to make a "wow" visual impact, but the taste... not for us. Worth trying and tinkering with for others, but we'll not be saving it as a family favorite.

These turned out great! I am so excited to have this recipe. Based on the suggestion from another comment, I used 3 differnt types of sugar (white sugar, brown sugar, and confectioner sugar). They were pefect in texture, consistency, and softness. These cookies are loaded with peanut butter which made everyone clear them out very quickly.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used brown sugar, powdered sugar and regular sugar.  It turned out great!  My brother in law asked me to make these, and he said they were the best he ever tasted. Way better than the ones from the receipe on the back of the bag. I only gave four stars because I changed the original recipe.

This recipe was good, though I changed my amount of servings to 30. If I would have kept with the normal 9 serving amount they may have come out a little better. I followed everything precisely but since batter was so thick I used a mixer, I don't know if that was a bad move or not on my part. After doing so, I noticed the batter seemed a bit dry so I put in a teeny capful amount of milk and continued on with the recipe as written. They don't taste bad, but I probably should have left them in the oven for a bit longer. They're a little doughy, and it was too late for me to put them back in the oven, I had already pressed the kisses onto them. But overall, I'm not upset, they serve a purpose! If no one else eats 'em I will!

I followed another reviewer's sugestion of dividing the sugar among white, brown, and confectioners.  The cookies needed 14-15 minutes to bake and still came out VERY soft, but they didn't lose their shape.  My only complaint is that I prefer a more cookie-like kiss cookie (but who can complain with so few ingredients!).

The dough was super easy to work with. TIP: DO NOT PUT MORE THAN 12 DOUGH BALLS ON EACH COOKIE SHEET! I did and my cookies took forever to bake. Eventually I got so impatient I turned up the heat and my cookies weren't chewy and melt-in-your-mouth. They became hard, burnt, and wickedly dark brown.

I didn't change a thing and they are the most fantastic cookies! I'm a busy mom of two kids under three, so I love that there are only three ingredients. I've made five batches since Thanksgiving to give to friends/take to parties/etc. They fly of the plate!

These were good with 1 cup white, 1 cup brown, and 1 cup conf. sugar, but ...SO SWEET!  Almost sickeningly sweet, to me...but others seemed to enjoy them.  Will try again with only white sugar.

Very easy recipe.  Taste didn't compare to regular PB cookies, but you can't ask for anything more with just 3 ingredients and some kisses.  Will be serving these at a Christmas party tomorrow.

These are awesome! I've used the same recipe for these kind of cookies for 15 years (from my Mom who likes her cookies to be crisp) and this year I thought I'd try something new. So glad I did, not only are these easier but they are soft just the way my family likes them.  I did split up the sugars between brown, powdered and SPLENDA and they turned out great!

Very easy and delicious! Make sure that you bake them a little longer than the recipe calls for. It was a little difficult for me to tell whether or not they were done and I undercooked half the batch. I have learned from this and they should turn out better next time.

Would've given it five stars if the batter hadn't been so greasy!  I followed directions to a  TEE, and I was literally squeezing grease droplets from my fingertips.  I used Jif peanut butter, so maybe that had something to do with it, so maybe some flour next time.  Cookies were chewy and a little crisp, and otherwise good except for the grease!!

10 STARS! These cookies are fast to make,easy to clean up, and quick to finnish!! I made these yesterday with my little brother and sister. I doubled the batch using what a previous reviewer said to do-- one part brown sugar, one part confectioners, and one part white. My boyfriend just took the rest with him to work! Time to make more!!  LOVE THEM!!

I found this dough, when left the way it is written, was super super sticky and I did not have the time to let it chill and firm up.  I added about half a cup of flour to the dough and it set up a little more nicely so that I could roll it with my hands and not have dough inbetween my fingers.  I also doubled the recipe and found it made a LOT more cookies than written for - I got about 3 1/2 dozen from doubling this.  I always roll mine in sugar before baking, as well.  Overall, these came out pretty well considering how fast and few ingredients this recipe uses, but I have made much much better versions of these cookies.

I thought that these are extremely easy to make. However, I didn't like the texture. It was so soft that it tasted as if I took a spoonful of peanut butter straight from the jar, just sweeter from the sugar. I love peanut butter from the jar, but NOT that sweet. I used only 2/3 of the sugar. I won't be making them again but thank you for the recipe.

These were so good.  I only had Adams peanut butter, and they were still deelish!! I like peanut butter cookies with the regular p.b., so they were a little different.  My 5 kids couldnt keep their hands off them, and they sold out fast at the Middle School bake sale.  A big hit for sure!!

These were delicious and are gluten free! (Big Bonus!) I followed the "most helpful" review to use 1/3 brown, 1/3 white, 1/3 powdered... Perfection! The only thing I would add is to blend the sugar and peanut butter, then add the egg, and let stand about 5 mins. Blend again and roll! Perfect!!

We found these way too sweet, and they were definitely missing something.  Maybe they need a little flour to hold it all together?  They crumbled when I tried to take them off the pan.

Amazing! I really was nervous about this recipe, since it doesn't contain flour, but they turned out wonderful. I did add 1/3 c. wheat flour(I doubled the original recipe) to add some fiber. I did as some others suggested, and did some granulated sugar, some brown sugar, and some powdered sugar. I also added vanilla. I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar before baking. My kids loved helping unwrap the kisses. Delicious, I can't stop eating them!!

So good and so easy.  I prefer with about three mini Hershey kisses per cookie.  I have made these several times.  One note, do not use reduced fat peanut butter.  I did once and they were so greasy they weren't worth eating.

After reading some of the reviews i used 1/3 brown sugar, 1/3 white, and 1/3 powdered sugar, skipped on the baking powder, and rolled it in white sugar and it came out perfect. The only other thing i did was baked 1 min longer.  So good!

These are the best.  Be ready for rich, creamy, chewy cookies with a bit of chocolate bliss.  I also used the three sugars - white, brown, and powdered, and it worked out very well.

Came out excellent. Daughter and hubby like these. I would add less sugar in the future cause it was a little too sweet for my liking, but definately a big hit.

I agree with the few negative reviews on these cookies. They are okay, but don't really taste like cookies, but more of a peanut butter blob with a browned bottom. They did look very nice, but just too rich for me.

AMAZING cookies!!! i couldn't believe how easy they were to make and how little ingredients i needed. the only thing i changed was when i put the kisses on top of the cookies i let them melt a little and then pressed another kiss on them to double the chocolate. so yummy! the left overs i have (if my husband doesn't eat them all) i just warm one up when i am ready to eat them. will for sure make these cookies on a regular basis.

This an easy and delicious recipe. I used the advice of another reviewer and did the equal parts white, brown and powdered sugar - instead of just white. I also rolled the cookie balls in white, red and green sugar before baking to make them festive. I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet and it's completly non-stick. They were a huge hit with the family for the holidays. They were perfect blooms and didn't fall at all!!! Thanks!!!

These were really easy to make. I had my children form them into balls and roll them in sugar before we baked them. I gave them 4 stars out of 5 because they were a little on the dense side. I used another recipe in the past that was a little lighter but toke more time to make. With 4 kids, quick wins out! Thanks for the easy, quick recipe.

These cookies were very good. I followed the advice of others and used a combination of sugars and they turned out wonderful. Also instead of the Kisses, I made them with Dove chocolates for Valentine's Day and the Dove was much better than the Hershey's Kisses.I will be making these again.

If I could give 6 stars, I would. I also added a 1/4 cup of flour to make them a bit more chewy and easier to mold. A+ overall!

I really enjoyed these and thought they were the best I've had thanks to the review that suggested doing 1/3 confectioners sugar (so as not to have the granular texture), and 1/3 brown sugar (to keep them moist and chewy).  Definitely a keeper.

I made this twice. The first time I took the other reviewers advice and used 1/2 white & brown sugar. I also added some vanilla (1 tbs.) It was great. I cooked then a touch longe than the recipe called for but they were great. The second time I followed the recipe exactly... they were OK. They seem underdone and the flavor is just OK.

i'm a sucker for any combination of graham crackers, chocolate & peanut butter; so i used the same amount of dry ingredients but instead of just sugar, used 1/3 cup confectioner's sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, and 1/3 cup graham cracker crumbs.  sooooo delicious and my kids were actually able to help me with these ones.  will definitely, definitely be making these ones again.

Great recipe...so easy and quick. I used the suggestions of 1/3 C brown, white, and confectioner's sugar. I also used Chunky P-butter. I think they would be better with creamy. Will try adding oats and such to change it up. Thanks for a keeper!!

I added a splash of vanilla and sub the cup of sugar for 1/3C each, white sugar, confectioners sugar and brown sugar. Very rich and chewy cookie, not grainy at all! Kids loved them. Thanks for the tip!!

I am glad I waited a day to review.  I did not like these when they were warm - too gooey and tasted more like a candy than a cookie - so I made a traditional peanut butter cookie recipe and put these in an airtight container.  Tried them again the next day and they had firmed a little and were definitely softer than the traditional recipe ones.  I thought they were super easy to make, kept well and made a beautiful cookie.  Thanks!

Yummy!!! I was very skeptical, so I halved the recipe. I used brown sugar instead of white and also used soy nut butter instead of peanut butter due to a peanut allergy. These are fabulous. Thanks for sharing!

This cookie was quick and easy and yummy!! I mixed butterscotch morsels into the batter before baking and did not use the kisses! Delish! My family was burning their mouths trying to eat them before they cooled. This recipe will be a staple from now on! Thank you!

Great recipe - I doubled the recipe and I made a few mods. They came out a little flat (a dash of brown sugar, powdered sugar, flour, and vanilla extract) but still tasted great!

eh. I wasn't in love.  My husband liked them enough but he wasn't wowed either.  We use organic, natural peanut butter so I'm wondering if we'd like them better using a standard brand. It was very easy though and great to do with kids.

If you use natural pb, add a pinch of salt too. It made a huge difference.

Not my favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies...  I really missed the flour.  The texture was really heavy and it was almost too sweet for my liking (words that rarely come out of my mouth!)  I was looking for somethhing new to try out this year, but will definitely stick with the family recipe for PB cookies next time.

I followed the suggestion of the reviewer and tripled the recipe. The cookies were flat as a pancake.  Perhaps I should  have refrigerated the dough for 1/2 hour as suggested.  I will not make this recipe again.

I have to say I was a little hesitant to make this recipe b/c of the lack of ingredients... but they were wonderful.  I was in a pinch to fill a tray of Xmas cookies and was lookin for something simple... and this was it.  I did add a tablespoon or so of brown sugar and added some 1/4-1/2 cup of flour.  They turned out awesome!   Thank you!

Tried this recipe last night, WOW! So easy, chewy and delish! My fam devoured them! Love how simple this recipe is and I don't even have to write it down in my recipe box because I have it memorized! Update: tried to make this recipe lighter by using splenda instead of white sugar...take my advice, unless you want DRY cookies that are difficult to swallow without a glass of milk, try it. Stick to the original recipe that make awesome cookies!

I'm completely lost on the negative reviews of this cookie.  This is one of the easiest, tastiest cookies I have ever made.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe with the exception of extending bake time by 5 minutes, and I found the cookie to be neither granular nor oily.  My husband, who isn't a sweets fan but loves peanut butter, thought they were amazing, too.  AND THEY WERE SO EASY!  They could literally be thrown together and baked while getting ready for work if I ever need to bring something in on the fly.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I loved them! My husband really really loved them! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, I also used 1/4 cup flour. I also rolled the dough in sugar! Very tasty and super easy to make!

I followed the recipe to a T...even when doubled. I baked for the suggested 10 min. I could tell they were still doughy even on  top. So I put them back in for an additional 2 minutes. I went ahead and took them out and placed the kisses on each one. However, as I pressed them down a little, I could see raw dough peeking through a little. Very disappointing, as I am/was making these for my son's bake sale tomorrow along with other treats. Anyhow, I went referenced another recipe and it suggested to placed them back in for 2 addntl minutes afterwards, so I did. The cookies were still very doughy inside when I checked with my cake tester stick. Anyhow I ended up putting them back in for another 2 minutes and then again for another 3. Now the cookies are stuck to the pan, scorched black is on the tip of the kiss and it's finally cooked all the way through...I have no idea what went wrong, but beware when making this recipe..

I doubled the recipe, using 2/3 cup each white, confectioner's, and brown sugars. I rolled the unbaked balls of dough in some white sugar before baking. Baked until they  just began to have little cracks in the surface. Absolutely perfect!

Maybe how greasy the dough turns out depends on the quality of peanut butter. I don't know anything about the differences in peanut butters, but I used an off-brand simply because the jar was the exact amount  I needed. As I rolled the balls, I had to squeeze the grease out of the dough. My fingers were coated in grease and it was beginning to run down my arm at one point. The finished cookies taste fantastic, though I'm definitely not feeding any cookie like that to my children.

I followed the advice, 3 eggs, 3 c. of peanut butter and did 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown, 1c. confec. and they were amazing.  The best pb cookies I've ever had! I took some into work and served some at a party and both times they were gone before I turned around! I made some and put mini Reese PB Cups on top when the cookie is still warm, out of this world!

Quick and easy, but I think I prefer the "traditional" peanut butter cookie taste. To make mixing really easy (I beat everything by hand), mix the sugar and eggs together first, and then add the peanut butter gradually.

I made this according to the recipe, and it was just fine. Don't make things complicated! And don't expect a gourmet creation, there's four ingredients for goodness sakes! It's just a yummy peanut butter cookie! Don't forget a glass of milk!

This recipe was OK as far as flavor. I used all brown sugar and added 2 T. flour to help stiffen up the dough. I also cooked for an extra minute with the kisses on as I like the chocolate a little softer (this made it messy though, probably wouldn't recommend it). Overall super easy and fast.

These cookies need to be taken out of the oven a litte early in order to keep a nice soft texture. The cookies turned out really well, everyone at work loved them! I would also use mini chocolate chips next time in order to distribute the chocolate flavor beyond the center. Great cookie!

I did the same as other members by using 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I didn't have time to refrigerate the dough and I didn't think it needed it either. I used regular chocolate kisses and  the swirled kind (they're swirled with milk chocolate and white chocolate) and both were awesome, I will definitely be making these again real soon!

I followed advice and used,  1/3 cup brown, 1/3 cup powdered and 1/3 cup white sugar. Cookies were not greasy at all. I used Jiff pnut butter. My kids did not like them, however when I brought them into the office they dissapeared before noon! I will make again for adults.

When I saw there were only 3 ingredients (sans choco) to make these cookies, I had to try it.  They're so perfect, my favorite peanut butter Hershey kiss cookies from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! Like another review stated, I changed the sugar(s)... to make a double batch I did 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 confectioners sugar. I used JIF Creamy. With 2 eggs and 2 cups peanut butter. Very delicious. I think these taste similar to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. For Valentine's Day, or with any holiday this would work too - I used colored M&M's to adorn the tops. This was a VERy tasty addition to this recipe also. I do half with kisses, and half with colored M&M's for a little something different. I was pn the phone with my family baking the second batch.

Super easy, super good!  I did the "3 different types of sugar" thing, except the amounts weren't exact.  Probably 1/4 cup brown, 1/8 cup powdered and the rest white splenda.  They came out chewy and tasty.  They kept their shape too, and I did have to cook them about 13 minutes instead of the 10.  So, the moral of the story, as long as you have "some" brown and powdered sugar along with the white, the cookies won't be too greasy or grainy.

This is really a great recipe.  We add a teaspoon of vanilla to really bring out the flavor.  The best part is deciding what type of chocolate to put with this.  We've done mint chocolate, caramel filled chocolate, white chocolate all with fantastic results.

These were okay. The first batch fell apart. The second batch is edible but kind of greasy/gritty. I think I'll keep looking for a different recipe.

Delicious and so easy.  I used the white/brown/powedered sugar blend as well.  I recommend making them well in advance though, the chocolate took a long time to set and they taste better when cooled.

Delicious...to previous posters...they're supposed to crackle a bit when you press the kiss into them!!!
Great and simple recipe...came out perfect (11 minutes at 350 was perfect!)
I did use 2/3 cups brown and 1/3 cup white (had no confectioners) and came out YUMMY!!!

Super easy recipe.  I like to roll the dough into white sugar before baking.  It makes the cookie look even more festive and it doesn't ruin the taste of the cookie!

I am so pleased with this recipe! I used the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 (white sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar) hint and they turned out fabulous! I did add an extra spoon of powdered sugar because I felt the dough was too squishy at first, but then I refrigerated for 20 minutes and they are great. They look so sweet and uniform in size. I was glad they did not get too much spread to them. I pressed in the hershey's kiss and the top of the cookie crackled just perfectly. I love love love how they taste and at this point I don't even really feel like giving them away. :-) But if I don't, I will eat them all. Thanks for a terrific and easy recipe!

My mom taught me this quick and easy cookie recipe years ago. I must say, it's idiot proof, even when I was a new cook!!! They're very peanut-buttery and dense (no flour) and are so rich that I can only eat a few.  They make great holiday gifts for co-workers/neighbors if you put them in holiday tins you can pick up at the dollar store.

These were good. Easy. They are very sweet. The dough did not seem like dough and I wondered about them flattening out too much and not having any body to them, so I added 1/4 cup of flour to dough.

This was the easiest cookie recipe I have ever made!  I took them to a picnic recently and they were gone within minutes--kids and adults raved.  I did have to put the dough in the fridge for about 15 minutes but it worked out great.  Thanks for a great, quick, easy cookie recipe that I will use again and again.

These cookies are sooooo yummy, very rich. Not only was it fast and easy but I had the 3 ingredients so all I had to do was buy the kisses.  These are great for last minute desserts. I took them out a couple minutes early so that they were chewy.  They were a big hit at my house.

I didn't have creamy so I used chunky peanut butter. They were scrumptios. Got lots of wonderful comments on them. Next time I will be sure to use creamy peanut butter, since the little nut chunks in the chunky peanut butter kinda fell out of the edges of the cookie. Overall, the appearance of mine weren't tempting, but otherwise, a very yummy cookie.

Missing something.  I am a very big PB and chocolate fan, but I missed the traditional cookie taste.  We still ate a few, they were very rich.

Great cookie!  Couldn't be easier.  My family ate them as fast as they came out of the oven.  They have no idea how easy they were to make and I'm not telling ;) Those that weren't eaten immediately were just as good the next day.

This is exactly the pb cookie recipe my mom made growing up. So nice to discover you can still use it for the PB Kiss Cookies. Gotta love a recipe that you can memorize and don't have to look up everytime. I also love that it makes  a small quantity of cookies; all the other recipes are for 5 dozen or so.

Gritty, crumbly, just not what I was expecting at all. So disappointed! It seems like all the people who like the recipe made significant changes or substitutions, I wish I had realized that before making this.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and they were PERFECT!!  No need for powdered sugar or extra flour.   So, my review for THIS recipe is definitely 5 stars.  

As for how long to bake them, that will always depend on YOUR oven.  Know your oven.  Do a test batch with 4 cookies at the suggested time to see if you need to increase or decrease baking time.

I used to use this recipe for regular (press down the top) peanut butter cookies, and even substituted Splenda to make them low-sugar. The Splenda version is ok, but definitely not as good!
When I did it this time, I used another reviewer’s suggestion and did 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c confectioners sugar. 
They were perfect. My mom has had her original recipe (with flour and Crisco, etc)  for decades and said she might do them this way now!
I may try adding a little vanilla next time, but overall, it’s a solid, easy gluten-free recipe! Two thumbs up!

Turned out great! I used 1/3 cup each white sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and added 1/4 cup flour, since a lot of reviewers seemed to have done that. Very simple recipe, and looks great at the end!

Super easy. I made these exactly as the recipe states because what good would my review be of THIS recipe if
I changed things up?

Comments:

We wrapped dough and placed in freezer for 20 min. This made rolling easier as the dough gets crumbly as it warms so roll quickly.

Unwrap kisses and set them in freezer while cookies bake.  Took this idea from another comment and it is brilliant! 

These look raw after 10 min but take them out and press the kiss on them. They finish cooking on the 
Cookie sheet with no melting issues at all!

They are rich but I expected this based on the ingredients. One cookie satisfies a sweet tooth.

I will definitely make this again! I would recommend making a double batch though. My cookies didn't look as pretty and were slightly crumbly, but that is because I used natural peanut butter.

This was an easy recipe and everyone loved the cookies.  I made them a few days before Valentine's Day so instead of dipping the cookies in white sugar, I substituted red candy sugar.

SUPER EASY! This is the absolute best peanut butter kiss recipe i have found. The simplicity, and impressively delicious outcome combined makes this probably the best thing I've ever called homemade! Thank you for Sharing!  -- Also, I paired these with a raspberry jelly filled butter cookie and told everyone over the holidays that i made "peanut butter & jelly cookies" ;) ( really, it is fruit preserve in the cookies. It's just funner to say jelly.)

They turned out wonderful!   With making a double batch I used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar,  I also used the starburst chocolates instead of kisses.  I read from someone else’s review that the brown sugar would keep them softer and it did!  I liked that there was no flour in this recipe.  I’m sharing the recipe with my family.  The cookies were a holiday hit.

Very yummy cookie.  I also followed another substitution suggested by someone else (thank you!).  I tripled the recipe to share cookies with my friends.  1 cups sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup confectioners sugar.  I also had to cook them for 12 minutes and they still came out nice and chewy.

I decided to make mine like peanut butter blossoms made by Karlynn Johnston. I added butter, flour, baking soda and powder. I also rolled them in sugar before baking them. This is how my mom made them growing up.

Oh my goodness....these were the most delicious, decadent, soft, peanut buttery cookies I have ever had! And the best part, they are super simple to make! So simple, in fact, that my 8 year old made them all by herself. I was going to help, but when I saw all the steps and ingredients needed, I knew she could do them herself. The only thing we did differently was to add caramel filled kisses to the top. I would highly recommend this. It added a new texture and flavor to the whole thing that really enhanced it.

I used a combo of brown sugar, confectioners sugar and white sugar, which was good. I stuck the kisses into the cookies too soon and they started to melt. Next time I will wait a few minutes before using the kisses.

So my picture did not work last time. Are used a triple batch.  Used one cup powdered sugar 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white sugar and 3 teaspoons of vanilla. 
 I might reduce the peanut butter by 1/2 cup next time.  I also used chocolate stars But really good and Not dry

Baked up great!  This recipe is a keeper.  I don't roll the balls in sugar before baking because I don't care for the sugar texture, but other than that I made no changes.

I made this recipe as one reviewer suggested to triple it using 1 cup sugar, one cup brown sugar and 1 cup confectioner's sugar (swerve) and it was great and allowed me to cut back about 1/3 sugar this way.

I used the three different sugars and put them in for 8, put in the kiss, and then another 2. They are soft and yummy (and so easy). I would recommend letting them cool on the pan or else they’re kinda too gooey. They don’t look as wonderful as I hoped they’d be (they cracked a bit), but overall this recipe is a keeper. Thank you!!

These cookies were made following the original recipe.  They were too sweet to eat. Glad that I tried one,  because now I won't be bringing them to Christmas Eve dinner. Yuck.

I make these every Christmas for my mother who has a gluten allergy.  They're so easy to make I use chunky peanut butter to add a bit more crunch and I use a small ice cream scoop. I just spray the scoop with a little Pam, it's so easy.  No mess no fuss

This is the same recipe my “Grandma” Pat shared with me YEARS ago! Why add all that extra stuff when you don’t need to?! I always double this recipe and I make these every year for Christmas! LOVE THESE! The only change I SOMETIMES make to these is adding a few christmas colored jimmies before putting them in the oven. Oh, and I HAVE TO eat just one after the kiss goes on and is still in the “setting” stage....”just to make sure they’re not poison.” As I always tell my kids. Lol! Try them, they’re amazingly easy!!!

These cookies were a disaster! They taste like I'm eating pure peanut butter and sugar mixed together....wait, that's what I am eating! They are grainy and dry and I just wasted a lot of expensive ingredients (I tripled the recipe)!! Big mistake!

I loved these cookies , their easy to make and and extremely delicious! I had to cook them for a longer time , about 15 minutes. Also I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and instead of one cup of white sugar, I added  a half a cup of white sugar and a half a cup of powdered sugar.

I made these cookies about two years ago, then again last night.  I had forgotten how easy they were to make and how delicious they are!  I made them exactly as the recipe reads.  My husband is not a chocolate fan, but loved these cookies!  My daughter is avoiding gluten these days, so I can't wait for her to try them tonight.  Thank You!

Very good made exactly as described, and these are gluten free so I could eat them!  I noticed that mixing longer (i used a kitchenaid stand mixer) and faster made the mixture  instantly drier and easier to handle, so if it seems too gooey and sticky, mixing vigorously with an electric mixer seems to fix that.

I couldn't figure out how to edit my last review but I cut it off at "~ 10 minutes later" and it was perfect!! Simple ingredients and fast great results. Will make again but dip in sugar next time just to gave it a nice touch. Thanks!!"

Love it, but I double everything to make a bigger batch. I give them out to family during Christmas.
I also roll them in surger. If you make small balls the cook time is perfect. Also not bad for dogs, but cut half the sugar.

These cookies turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out just like the ones I remember as a kid.

What has always disappointed me with peanut butter kiss cookies is that they are so hard; regardless of temp cooking and ingredients and altitude, the cookie was always too crunchy for me. Today I made these with my 6 year old son. We used the 3 different sugars and it was divine. So easy and simple and the cookie is better than the kiss! A fantastic recipe.

The BEST.  Took the advice from reviewer Dawn Hill and they were perfect.  The consistency of this cookie was perfect with the mix of the 3 sugars.  I also put the kisses in the freezer before using them.  Simple.  Easy.  Delicious!

I must be a traditionalist.  Good PB cookies need to have flour because these little gems are too sugary for me.  Although, my husband liked them I just couldn't get past the crunchy sugar laden cookie.  I did as some suggested and exchanged some of the white sugar for brown as well as powdered sugar.  It still did not give them a good texture or make them a 4-5 star cookie for me.

I made one batch like recipe stated and they were great and really cute! But I read other reviews that suggested brown sugar and confectioners sugar Also so I tried another batch, they turned out all flat, tasted okay, but definitely didn't look right. Stick with original recipe in my opinion.

Substituted the sugar with salt, replaced the peanut butter with mayonnaise, and used mashed apricot baby food instead of eggs. I used Hershey's hugs instead of kisses. Very, very, tasty. In fact, they were the best peanut butter hug cookies I have ever tasted.

Amazing!!  I disagree with the person who stated that the recipe on the bag of kisses is better.  This one is simple.  And it's fantastic. You can crank out multiple batches with ease.  I've made them with children.  I've made them with clients who have dyspraxia (motor development issues). I make them every Christmas for a cookie swap party (like 4 years in a row now); and they are the first to go. They are the cookie equivalent to a Reese's Cup.

I still have a soft spot in my heart for my mom's old peanut butter cookie recipe, but these are much easier and made my  kids just as happy. Thanks! 
By the way, I forgot and added the kisses before putting the cookies in the oven - they turned out just fine.

Instead of white sugar I use 1c brown, 1c confectioner's and 1c white with 3c peanut butter and 3 eggs. I like that the brown sugar gives them a little chewiness and the confectioner's cuts the white sugar so you don't get any gritty texture at all in these. It also stiffens the dough so they don't spread

I was worried the dough would be too sticky, but it actually came out OK.  For some reason, the cookies were a little gritty... like the sugar didn't break down enough.  Wouldn't make them again.

I was super hesitant to try this but I had a gluten free friend coming to a party so I figured I would make a 1/2 batch of these and a full batch of the land of lakes recipe for pb kisses.  My fried loved them! She was ecstatic!! And a few others tried both and preferred this recipe. So peanut buttery and moist. Especially for day after, these were the winners!! I love how secretly gluten free it was!

AWFUL. Dont do it, dont even TRY. It turned out like peanut butter TAR. WORSE THAN CHEWING TOFFEE. I had to throw it ALL OUT. What a waste of my time and money, which I do not have either of. I went back to the traditional recipe. NOT IMPESSED

This is a great recipe, but I rated it 4 stars because I prefer to follow the advice of a reviewer who uses brown sugar and powdered sugar in addition to white.  I use 2-1/2 cups of peanut butter, 2 large eggs, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar.  I have made this recipe as originally written, and it turns out just fine, too.

they needed a few extra minutes baking time. I doubled the batch & suggest keeping out only enough dough to roll cookies for one pan at a time & chilling the rest. Also I used a previous reviewers suggestion of unwrapping & chilling all of the kisses.
these were the simplest cookies I've ever made --was skeptical at first that they could hold their shape with no flour but they came out perfect. Will definitely make these again!

These were perfect for a Christmas cookie swap! As the one reviewer suggested, I tripled the recipe and used 1 cup granulated white sugar, 1 cup light brown sugar, and 1 cup confectioners sugar. I also ground my own peanut butter. I made a trial batch the night before just to make sure they "worked" considering all the deviations to the recipe I  made. I was concerned about them being dry since I ground my own peanut butter. They were not dry, and were wonderful! Even two days old now, they are still perfect!

Delicious! I used the advice of the first reviewer: 3 cups peanut butter, 1 cup granulated sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup confectioners sugar. I also added a small amount of flour and rolled the balls of dough in granulated sugar before baking. These were amazing and stayed good for almost a week.

I was surprised how well this recipe turned out! Nice and chewy, but definitely dense. Like others said to do, I substituted a third each of brown, white, and powdered sugar for the white sugar. (Basically if you're supposed to use 1 cup of white, use 1/3 cup white plus 1/3 cup brown plus 1/3 cup powdered sugars.) I also added 1/4 cup of flour (gluten-free) per a batch to give a little more fluff/strength. Without these tune-ups, I don't think it would have been as successful. I made two batches like this for a party and they were gobbled up before the party was half-way through!

I did half white sugar, half brown sugar and would do it that way again. I would not use "natural" peanut butter. I used about 1/4 cup natural for 2 cups total peanut butter for a double batch and the cookies were kind of crumbly.  Also I live in Florida so I always put the kisses in the freezer while mixing & baking the cookies.

These are good and I use the tip from Dawn.  They are my boyfriend's favorite and are pretty addicting.  I have used crunchy peanut butter as well to give off the illusion I spent time chopping peanuts and putting them into the batter.  My secret.

I've made these forever!  It is completely unnecessary to use other sugars. These are like eating heaven. I use Brach's chocolate stars instead if kisses.

These ended up so greasy from the peanut oil and not enough sugar to soak it up.

I took the advice of the first reviewer using brown, white and powdered sugar. These were wonderful and loved by all! You will need to cook these a bit longer than the 10 minutes, for me it was more like 14. These were part of a cookie exchange and it was a huge hit.

I made these cookies since we are a gluten free household. I used a half of a cup of organic brown sugar, half a cup of organic regular sugar. I added a 1/4 cup of vegan butter and 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp. of baking soda to hold em together and used 2 egg whites instead of the whole egg due to an egg allergy. I also put in a 1/4 of organic white rice flour. Worked very well. My kids enjoyed them.

My whole family loves these cookies. My dad says they are just like the cookies my grandma used to make.  

You can even replace the kisses for semi-sweet morsels and mix in with the dough.  Its great that way too.

Made it with 1/2 cup of white and brown sugar.  Tasted really good but sweet!  Made 31 cookies instead of 18, maybe cuz I made them smaller than normal?  But, nevertheless, still delicious!

Not Good! Melted everywhere...had to scrape off pan and put in mixing bowl and used Herseys Kiss recipe like previous said by VALHFL, it's common sense you take mix nothing but sugar and peanut butter together and expect it not to melt everywhere but I even tried it with the different sugars hoping powdered sugar was going to be enough to bind everything together, but to no avail it melted like a 7th grader on her first crush.

They came out flat. I prefer them chewy, so I think this recipe needs a little bit of flour and the temperature needs to be raised a little to 375. Next time I am going to use the recipe on the back of the Hershey's bag.

Use three sugars, then these are awesome!
Tried this recipe as written the first time and ended up with flat, rock hard cookies. The next time I split the sugar 1/3 each of confectioners sugar, white sugar and brown sugar like the most helpful review suggested and they were perfection! Honestly, don't waste your time with the original. They tasted somewhat decent, but not what they should have been. Splitting the sugars is the way to go. No spreading, soft, chewy and melt in your mouth. Perfection!

I did what another reviewer suggested and used 3 different types of sugar. First of all, the dough balls were a greasy mess. Yes, they held their shape well, no problem. And they were tasty. But that was because of all the oil from the peanut butter. Secondly, one batch took about 14 minutes to cook while the other took 12 minutes. Waiting a few more minutes wasn't the problem...the issue was that the edges over-cooked slightly. Thirdly,  after removing them from the oven and letting them sit for a few minutes, the cookie had this desire to crumble from the spatula touching it, though it would've been more disastrous if I didn't have them on parchment paper. It's still a tasty cookie, and after sitting, it holds it's shape, but it is so darn chewy you have to pick it from your teethThis cookie is just plain weird.

I made these in two separate ovens at two different houses.  On my first attempt, they were basically raw when I took them out after 10 minutes, so I put them in an additional 5 minutes.  Apparently, that was too long, and they were flat, spread out, and all squished together.  On my second attempt, after 10 minutes, they looked great.  However, when I tasted one, it was raw... once again!  Tasted like cookie dough, but not in a good way.  Very frustrating!  Next time, I will buy prepackaged peanut butter cookies and put a kiss on top.  Much less trouble, and much cheaper considering I used an entire jar of peanut butter and 2 cups of sugar!

I love this recipe! Easy, delicious, and simple ingredients make it a great dessert. I've made it just like it says, but tomorrow I'm using coconut sugar instead of white sugar. Let's see how it comes out.

We took others suggestion & used 1/3c each sugar, brown sugar & powdered sugar. We also had to add 2T flour to stiffen the dough some. The taste was like I remembered. Although I won't make these often will keep for Christmas or something.

These had too much peanut butter flavor.  I think some vanilla and brown sugar would tone it down some.

Wow!  Melt in your mouth peanut butter bliss!  I followed the suggested recipe tweaking from Dawn0001.  The blending of 3 sugars made all the difference in the texture....My husband shared that it beat out the ones he grew up with...

This came out real good. I did follow some others advice. 1/3 cup white sugar 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 cup powder sugar. I used 1 1/4 cups peanut butter cause I had that much left in the jar and didnt want to save it. I also used 2 Tablespoons flour and the 1 egg. I also froze the kisses like some suggest. This is so good

With these cookies, I was expecting something more along the lines of a peanut butter cup: soft, moist, and 'peanut buttery'. However, these were hard, chewy and very eggy. This may have happened though, because I used the 'real' peanut butter and added a little less of it because if the strength or real peanut butter.

Wow, these are good even without the chocolate kiss on top.  I was looking for a PB Blossom recipe using butter rather than shortening, and found this recipe.  I made it using the suggestions in the review from DAWN0001. 1 C each of white, brown, and powdered sugars, 3 C PB, 3 eggs.  I did not believe these would work, but was hopeful, as we have a little friend who needs to eat gluten free.  These are awesome, GF or not!  Our GF friend loved them, I call it a win.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe because I wanted something simple for my 2.5-year-old to help me with.  It was easy, but I did end up adding about 1/4 cup of flour because the dough was so sticky.  I also refrigerated for 30 minutes before rolling into balls.  I used the smallest Pampered Chef cookie scoop, and I felt like that made a very nice sized cookie.  I also rolled the dough into colored sugar before baking to make the cookies more festive for Christmas.  I baked about 12 minutes, until they just started to crack on top.  I immediately placed a chocolate star on each cookie after taking them out of the oven, and I honestly didn't think the cookies were quite done because they seemed soft, but after they cooled they were just right.  The flavor is good, but I honestly prefer the flavor of the "longer version" peanut butter cookie.  This is more like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup, which I figured they would be when I read the ingredients, but like I said, they are easy.

Great option for a gluten-free cookie; try substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar. If not gluten-free, I prefer the consistency of the recipes with flour, as the cookies hold together better.

These are the BEST cookies I've ever had. Insted of 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1 cup of brown sugar in the dough, then rolled the dough in white sugar and baked the balls for a little bit before I put the chocolate on top.

Some reviews mention single batch, double batch, etc. (Ex: add 1/3 cup flour to double batch).  As recipe is calculate based on servings specified, what number of servings represents a "single batch?"

I was excited by the high reviews this recipe got and made them, along with my mom's recipe for peanut butter kiss cookies for an event. They have thick greasy texture and did not melt the chocolate kiss. Everyone tried both cookies and agreed this cookie is about as good as a spoonful of peanut butter. Do your guests a favor and find a recipe with a few more ingredients.Cookies".

These were great! I doubled the recipe, and did 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also rolled the balls in granulated sugar prior to baking. I baked for 10 mins, took them out, quickly popped in the hershey kisses (with a twist) and put back in the oven for 1 min. They came out perfect and are very, very rich. They go great with a glass of milk. Nice, simple recipe- thanks for this one!

These were very easy to make and turned out perfectly.  I did use 1/3 c brown sugar, 1/3 c powdered sugar and 1/3 cu white sugar.  I also found that adding the peanut butter before the egg helps to make the dough less sticky.  I put them in a pre-heated oven at 350 for 10 minutes.  I also found that if you twist as you put the kiss on the cookie, it reduces the cracking.

I followed another user's advice and used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar. Kept the other ingredients the same. Loved the cookies!

I made the mistake with the first batch and followed the most popular review of splitting the sugars into 3 and using 3 eggs. Big mistake! The dough was SUPER greasy and spread! Even after cooling down, the cookies still felt greasy. Not sure what everyone is raving about with that converted recipe.

This is a crumbly, oily mess.  I was skeptical of a cookie recipe without flour, but I tried it anyway.  Make these only if you are serving at home and need something quick.  They don't travel.  Actually, its hard to pick one up without it falling apart.

I mixed up night before and froze. They defrosted 2 days later and rolled into balls and put in oven. They immediately began to burn! Are there ingredients missing? Or should I have mixed them again before putting into oven. And yes the oven works correctly.. I ended up adding flour, vanilla,  and baking soda, and they ended ok. I question this recipe?

Very easy recipe! Taste delicious! If you follow the recipe....once again, IF YOU FOLLOW THE RECIPE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! This is the first time I have ever made/tasted peanut butter cookies and they were better than what I expected. The chocolate made them taste like a peanut butter cup. The family loved them! Thank you very much for the great recipe!

I've made this for 2 Christmas cookie exchanges and they are a hit!!!  I did make a changes though 1) Instead of 2 cups white sugar, I decreased the white to 1 cup and added 1 cup of brown and added 1 c confectioners sugar.  2) increased peanut butter to 3 cups 3) increased eggs to 3.

These are by far the easiest cookies you will ever make, and they taste the best! Make sure the cookies are completely cooled before you try and store them, or there will be chocolate everywhere. Delicious, scrumptious chocolate.

It could be that I used an organic peanut butter without the added sugar of a traditional brand, but These were not good.  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, but I don't think that would have contributed to the 'off' taste that much.  They were just... well... not good.  They are, however, very pretty.  I am going to try the recipe on the back of the Hershey bag next time.

Just made these with my 4 kiddos and it was a huge success! We all tasted and they gave them a big thumbs up! I did do as others suggested though- I multiplied the recipe x3, and did the sugars as 1c. white, 1 c. confectioners, and 1 c. brown sugar. Also added 1 ts. of baking powder. Now to keep the kids out of them!

I'm not sure what happened but I followed the reviewer who tripled the recipe and subbed brown sugar and confectioners sugar. The oil dripped all over the oven and the cookies were terrible. I'd still like to try, it seems so easy.

I was a little reluctant to try this, (it doesnt even have flour in it) but I tried them and they turned out great! All the great reviews convinced me to try them and im glad i did. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white. I'm keeping this one!

I tried these for a quick and easy fix for our cookie cravings when I all we wanted was some warm comfort food. They took all of 3 minutes to make, and about 15 -18 minutes per sheet to bake. I recommend adding PB cups (halved) as an alternative to the kisses, but we had both kinds and they were pretty awesome considering they took almost no effort.

I had some left over kisses from Christmas I wanted to use up so I decided to try these.  So glad I did, they are very yummy! I used half brown and half white sugar and they turned out great. They are very chewy, but I like them that way. Couldn't ask for any more out of only 4 ingredients.

Love the peanut butter and chocolate combo but I found them a little too sweet.  If your sweet tooth does not require a lot of sugar I would suggest adding a little less.

As a reviewer suggested, I also divided the sugar ingredient into white, brown and powdered sugar.  Additionally, I added approx. 1/8 cup of white flour to make rolling the balls easier.  They are a family favorite now!!!

These stayed chewy for me.  I did the white/brown/confectioners combo.  And instead of kisses, I made thumbprints and filled with melted chocolate frosting.  Super easy, attractive, and SO GOOD.

This recipe was amazing! It tastes so good and is so easy. I will definitely do it again. My husband's coworkers loved the cookies and are asking for more. Don't change it. This is my new favorite cookie recipe.

These cookies were YUMMY and just like eating a reese's pb cup!! Last night I was going to make Peanut Butter cookies but as I was gathering ingredients realized that I didn't have enough flour.  ARGHH!!! So I found this recipe and thought I'll give these a try even though there wasn't much to them but since it was 10:00 p.m. I didn't feel like running to the grocery store to get flour for the other recipe.  I took DAWN0001 advice and used 1/3 each powdered sugar, white sugar and brown sugar.  They came out FANTASTIC!!  Also only cook for 10 minutes even if you think they aren't done. I was a little leary that they weren't cooked but they were just fine.  They were so easy to make and any baker normally has these 4 ingredients on hand. Ok maybe not the kisses but you could use a bunch of choc. chips instead.  I would suggest that you make a double batch from the original because the original recipe didn't much maybe about 25 - 30 cookies for me and they go quick!  Thanks Sharon for sharing your recipe:)

I really enjoyed making these cookies! it took me only 15 minutes! Everyone loved. At first I was hesitant because the recipe did not consist of flour. I put  about 1/4 cup of flour. Instead of 1 cup of white sugar I put 1/2 of cup of white and 1/2 of cut of brown sugar!

These cookies were amazing!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used the 3 kinds of sugar and they were delicious.  I also used dark chocolate kisses because I had them in the pantry, I also think they toned down the sweetness a bit, which I liked.

Fabulous!  I make with 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup powdered sugar.  They are so yummy!  I used my tiny scoop and they were perfect.  I can't remember how many it made b/c I ate so many I lost count.

These were super easy to make and they tasted fabulous.  I loved that they were so rich in peanut butter flavor.  They wound up being really messy though.  They were very greasy (due to all the peanut butter) and were a little crumbly (not much to hold them together).  Adding a little flower or even just a roll in sugar before baking would make a huge difference.

I used the sugar mix as well.  1/3 cup each of brown, confectioners, and white sugar. Then added a tsp of baking powder as well.  Very good, easy cookies to make.

These cookies are super easy and come out delicious. I used another reviewer's suggestion and substituted the 1 cup of white sugar for 1/3 cup confectioners, 1/3 cup brown, and 1/3 white. I also added ¼ cup of flour. I will definitely make these again.

BIG HIT with everyone and fast and easy.  Also, it only makes around two dozen and are small.  I like this because I can't say no to cookies so it's better to not have several dozen cookies within reach.

I made these in a crunch for a party we were hosting at our house.  I loved the  fact that there were only 3 ingredients.  To my surprise they turned out wonderful.  They were so yummy that they were almost gone before our guests arrived!  I wouldn't change a thing.  They only reccommednation that I would have would be to just wait until they are completely before you eat them.  It's worth the wait!

SOOO YUMMY!!!  So much better than the recipe on the back of the Kisses' bag.  I did take some other reviewer's suggestions and did half sugar and half brown sugar.  I also use caramel kisses for half of the batch.

This was one of the easiest cookies I have ever made and they were SO good! I used another reviewer's advice and changed it to 1/3 c sugar, 1/3 c powdered sugar and 1/3 c brown sugar and they were soo yummy. Next time I will double the recipe. I took them to our church nursery for the Christmas eve service and they were gone before I could blink an eye. A couple of other tips, it was very helpful to sit and unwrap the kisses while the cookies were cooking so I could get them put in the cookies fast. Also, my daughter made some and she dropped the balls in white sugar before putting them on the cookie sheet...it gave it an added texture that was nice.

I cook but I do not bake.  I could not believe how easy this recipe was.  Had I known I would have been making these much sooner.  YUM!  It was a really fun project with my 4 1/2 year old.

Perfect as is! I had to cook a couple of extra minutes and they were great. Also tried another users suggestion of the 3 different sugars and found that not to be quite as good.

Followed exact directions and did not like results. Very chewy cookie. I was hoping for a softer cookie. Probably needs a little flour.

Great peanut butter flavor!  My first time making this cookie, and it's great.  Used a fellow reviewer's suggestion about the tripling it and using the brown, confectioners, and white sugar. :)

Sooo good, and super easy. I have an oven that cooks a little hotter than most, so I shortened cooking time to 8 1/2 mins. Also it definitely helps if you stick cookie batter in the fridge for a few mins prior to cooking. The cookies turn out rounder. This recipe will now be a regular at my house!

My husband and I loved this recipe over the one that was more complicated on the Hershey Kiss bag!!  They were AWESOME!  My 2.5 yo loved to help as well and there weren't a ton of ingredients.

Tried these for the first time and WOW they are easy to make and people love them!!  One small tip.. if you find that the dough is sticking to your hands when rolling... simply run your hands under water.. and instantly they stop sticking... worked wonders for me... thanx again for an amazing recipe =)

Easy, with a good texture, but the flavor of the more traditional peanut butter kiss cookies is better.

This recipe seemed way too easy and I was a sceptic. If you are doubting this recipe, I would encourage you to try it. I followed the directions as stated and they came out great.

I thought this recipe was ok - Mine turned out a little bit grainy - I cooked according to directions but maybe should have gone a little bit longer to get rid of the sugar texture.. VERY VERY easy but not sure if I will make them again.

These cookies got great reviews. I did have to add flour to help with the stickyness of the dough. Very rich and PB-y. Easy recipe though and great to make with kids.

I used the recipe for 2 dozens cookies. I am not fond of peanut butter cookies, but I wanted to try these out. The recipe reminded me of Peanut Butter Cups, so I had to try it. I changed the recipe a bit, I added the 1/4c of flour, 1/4 tsp of vanilla, 2/3c brown sugar, 1c white sugar, 3 eggs and 3 dashes of cinnamon. The batter alone was very good, I was afraid we would have any left to bake the cookies. I topped the cookies with the hershey kisses, then placed them back in the oven for a few more minutes....They are delicious and chewy. Thumbs up for this recipe.

I've made these before with traditional recipe and I can't tell the difference.  SOOOOOO easy I'll be making them more often.  I did add 1/4 c of flour because I wanted them to be chewy.  They were easy to roll. Don't overbake them--they will set up while cooling and won't taste raw.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Wanted a test batch, used 1/3C ea: granulated, lt brown & powdered sugars w/ 1C peaunt butter & 1 med egg.  mixed throroughly while oven pre-heated then rolled into 1 1/2" sized balls and placed onto cookie sheet.  My oven runs hot/quick, I only had to bake for 8 minutes. Removed from cookie sheet onto foil on counter and pushed kisses down into center.  They came out just like the picture and were an incredible hit.  Thank you for this quick simple recipe and to those who tried it and did not have good results, try again, it is worth it!  One note: I refrigerated the rest of my batter while the first batch baked and the second (cold batter) batch nearly overcooked outside so no refrigeration if you are using mixed sugars.

These were SO good!  I did what others suggested and used different sugars.  I was out of brown sugar so I used 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar.  Still came out great.  Half of them were gone within 20 minutes!  Definitely will make again.

They are good cookies and simple to make. I added the vanilla and used three types of sugar equally (granulated, brown, confectioners).  I also rolled the balls in sugar prior to baking to give them a Christmas glisten!  They turned out pretty, the dark chocolate kisses look best.

I made these for an office party and they all loved them! I adjust the recipe just a smidge.  I add 1/4 c. flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of salt. Instead of 1 cup of sugar, I add 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar. The brown suger sure makes a difference. This makes the dough more pliable.

Extremely easy!   Great for that last minute treat when unexpected guests are coming.   I will make these again.
I added 1/4 cup flour and did place the kiss on for the last minute of baking.  That way it sticks to the cookie

i tweeked the recipe like the others suggested: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup flour. baked for 12 instead of 10 min. NOTE: you must let these set on the pan for a couple of minutes after you push the kiss in before you attempt to remove them to a cooling rack. they will crumble if you don't. ALSO: i rolled the balls and then flattened them just a little bit before i baked them. then they didn't break up so much when i pressed the kiss in.
good recipe, thanks!

I used this recipe and the cookies were great!  I doubled the recipe and used 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar and I also added 1tsp vanilla extract.  I do agree with an earlier review that they need to be cooked longer...about 14 minutes worked in my oven!  Will make these again and again!

My sister-in-law claims these are the best cookies she's ever eaten. They are certainly the easiest I've ever made. Very, very rich but perfect for a group - who doesn't like peanut butter and chocolate?

Husband loved these. Didn't have a problem with them being greasy. Cooked for eight minutes, removed, sprinkled with sugar and added chocolate kiss. Cooked two more minutes. Very easy!

great recipe! And so easy to make! It lost a star because I found them a bit too sweet, but still enjoyed them on an overall scale. I would suggest baking them with the chocolate kiss already placed on top of the cookie...the outside of the chocolate hardens and the inside become soft...so delicious!

Awesome, easy, kid-friendly recipe. A great way to get your kids involved is to have them measure, mix and scoop dough onto the baking sheet with a mini scoop (if old enough) and unwrap the kisses while the cookies are baking. My 2 1/2 year old was able to do this for me. I put out a bowl (for the wrappers) and a cutting board (for the open kisses) so she had a simple and helpful project. I, like many others, used 1/3 of each sugar (white,brown & confectioners). After they were done baking I tranferred them from the baking sheet to the cutting board, so that my daughter could place the kisses on top. They turned out delicious and she had a blast helping.

I always make these cookies this way - one piece of advice.. before you remove the cookies from the oven, wait until the tops of them barely begin to crack (10-13 min usually).  This makes them crunchy on the outside and just a little chewy on the inside.  Also, already have your kisses unwrapped and immediately press them into the center.

If you have to change two ingredients, it's not a 5* recipe, IMHO.  As written,
this recipe is greasy.  Follow the reviewer's suggestions and try using a Rolo or Dove caramel for a 5* cookie.

I have never eaten a cookie that actually dripped grease!
Don't get me wrong, the flavor is nice, but because there is no flour and the base is pure peanut butter, this made for a very oily cookie.

This recipe was GREAT! Let me first start off by saying i am almost 37 weeks prego, so i tend to get alot of cravings. well lastnight it was something sweet. but i really didnt have that mayn ingredients in my cupboard but i found this recipe. It called for almost nothing. it was soooo quick and easy to make. and the cookies turned out perfect. i also had a lot of dough left over (after already making a triple batch) but even that quickly disapeared my boyfriend went crazy over the raw dough. i followed the recipe exactly the only substitute i did was i used dark chocolate truffle kisses instead of the original. but these cookies are absolutley awesome..thank you so much. You cured my craving!

These cookies were so simple to make and so yummy!  Everyone loved these.  I'm making them again tonight.  I took the suggestion of mixing the sugars and they came out great - the cookies stayed soft.  I did have to cook a while longer but I think that's because of my oven.  This is a keeper and my new peanut butter cookie recipe!  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were delicious. I took the suggestion of making the recipe with 1c white sugar, 1c brown sugar, and 1c powdered sugar. I also put peanut butter cups in the middle instead of the kisses. I love this recipe.

i tried the modified version and unmodified. both were MUCH too sweet. the first bath came out eh...too sweet and the kisses melted completly & never rehardened. the cookies hardened in both cases, and no matter how clsoely i watched, they were always burnt on the bottom, even after turning down the stove. Not happy with these at all

YUMMMMMMYYYYY!  I Used all natural peanut butter.  The dough was way gooey, so I added about 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar.  It was still a bit gooey, but I managed.  I also sprinkled sugar on top of the cookies when I pulled them out of the oven.  They looked great and were goobled up in a matter of minutes.

Easy and Oh So Good!  I made these cookies with my 4 & 6 year old daughters and they did most of the work (if you can actually call this work).  I did refrigerate the batter for 20 min and I also used the red, green & white icing that was featured in one of the photos.  I baked them for 14 min.  At 10 min they were still too soft to hold structure.  Love these.  I will definately make them again.

These are really yummy, and they are SO easy to make! I literally whipped up a double batch in about 3 minutes. Best of all, all of the ingredients are things that are always in my pantry.

It was very good! I made them as gifts to friends for Christmas. But I did need to cook them for 15min. instead of 10min. But over all very yummy:)

Easy and different than my usual cookie fare.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar...but I must have packed my brown too well as when I went to push the kisses in, the cookies cracked all around it, although they cooled in one piece, I didn't like the look.  I used raspberry and orange flavored kisses which gave them an extra flavor boost.  Not crazy about the texture/flavor of the cookie itself but still tres edible.

I love these cookies, but instead of kisses(Not a fan) I use small peanut butter cups. So good, and don't last long at all.

My 5 and 6 year old daughters helped make them! We used 2/3 cup splenda and 1/3 cup splenda brown sugar blend, and added 1/4 cup flour as one reviewer suggested. The kids thought they were good but not great and I agree. They are a little too rich even with the flour added.

First cookies I ever made and everyone loved them!  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions.  I also used the 1/3 brown/confectioner/white sugar blend and it worked wonders.

I made a batch of these and a batch of "Peanut Blossoms" These were flat, and too chewy.  Even though they're simple, go with the other ones.  Much better.

My four-year-old REALLY enjoyed making these, and it doesn't get any easier than three ingredients!  I baked as directed; 350° for 10 minutes, and they turned out just right.  VERY rich - make sure you have enough milk on hand!

I saw these at a party and thought the person who made them used a pastry bag for the chocolate. They look great, taste great, and a cinch to make. My kind of recipe.

The texture is a little dry and gritty and the taste is just ok. I added chocolate chips and that made it better. I would not make this for company, but the kids loved making them and ate them right up. I will give it 4 stars because it is so easy to make and uses so few ingredients.

I cant believe I havent written a review for these yet! Ive made them over and over for almost a year now. This is BY FAR my absolute FAVORITE cookie recipe, ever!
For me, the best part about baking is getting the cookies into the oven and with such a short ingredient list, this recipe is pure joy!
I made these for a christmas party and people are still asking for the recipe today!

Any cookie is good in my book, of course, but I think I like these better as plain peanut butter cookies than I do with the chocolate added.  I should add, though, that my husband disagrees with me!  LOL
