I made this for dinner, it was easy and quick to put together. I added a dash of Italian Seasoning. My husband, who thinks I make too much chicken, liked it so much, he  finished the pan.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I couldn't find creamy chicken flavor so I used chicken and broccoli flavor rice and added my own cream. I also finely chopped the basil (the boyfriend is not a fan of green things) and grated fresh mozzarella. I've been dating my bf for about two months and cook every other day, usually from scratch. He said this was his favorite dish so far (sort of disappointing since it's partly packaged), but his only complaint was my tomato chunks were big. He asked me to make this a staple recipe. 4 stars because I just can't get over the packaged, flavored rice

As someone else mentioned, it was good but not very exciting - it was easy but would probably be improved by perhaps a little chicken broth and some more seasonings.

This dish was very good and easy to make.  The only change I made was that I did not add the tomatoes in during the cooking process. I did add some once I was ready to eat.

I made the recipe without the cheese and fresh basil as I did not have both ingredients. I did use dry basil instead. Despite the fact that I added a bit of salt , pepper, and garlic granules to the recipe, it tasted a bit bland.  I will try it again as the rice came out moist and fluffy which is excellent. Next time, I will use cheese but will add chicken broth to boost the flavor. This recipe is not terrible. It has room for improvement without really losing the main idea of a quick comfort food dinner.

I made it word for word as the recipe called and it was delicious! Big hit for my family of five.

solid 5-minute meal.
 I made this using leftovers and what was on hand:... leftover rotisserie chicken, parmesan, chicken flavored rice pack, 
golden tomatoes, and squeeze garlic.   I made rice according to package directions, and in another bowl used snips to dice chicken, cut basil, halve tomatoes, dumped what might've been 1/2 cup parmesan, and plooped out maybe 2 tbsp tubed garlic.

My husband and I love this recipe! The only thing I did differently was I substituted shredded Swiss cheese for the mozzarella (because I only had Swiss). We decided we like it better with the Swiss, so now that's the only way we eat it!

This was certainly easy and super fast, but it wasn't exactly exciting. Definitely comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly, and after tasting added Penzey's Arizona Dreaming seasoning which perked it right up. I also used some really high acid tomatoes so they were more full flavored - that helped too. I'll make again for an easy meal.

This was a pretty good one dish dinner that was quick and easy.  I do think it lacks a bit of flavor, but that is something easily remedied by adding  a spice or herb your family likes. I would add some fresh thyme or extra Italian seasoning next time.

The -prep was fast and easy but for us it lacked the pop of flavor we enjoy. For a easy week night meal that does taste good I would make again but I would use something to give it a boost in flavor.

I like how fast this was to prepare, but it really didn't have too much wow factor. I don't know if I would make it again
