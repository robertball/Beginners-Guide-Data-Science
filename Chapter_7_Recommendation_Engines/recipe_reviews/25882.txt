This is a great combination of ingredients and flavors!  We are trying to cut back a little on the amount of red meat we eat, so I only used 1/2 a pound of ground beef, but I added in about a cup of cooked brown rice before adding the gravy to make up for what we were leaving out.  I used an entire 8oz container of fresh unsliced mushrooms - I'm not sure if that would have been the same as using 1 cup, but because they shrink down while in the saute pan, it turned out to be just the right amount.  I also used only about a half a cup of gravy to bring the beef mixture together, and I saved the rest for each person at the table to use on top of the meal.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Excellent recipe! This is a great alternative to regular "Italian" style stuffed peppers. I used Monterey Jack cheese with hot peppers instead of plain Monterey Jack. It made for a spicy dish! I'll definitely be making this again!

As written I would just rate this 3 stars but following suggestions in reviews it was quite good. I did add Paula Deen's House Seasoning and cayenne pepper to the ground meat while browning. After draining meat I also added about 2 cups cooked white rice. Used entire two cups of gravy in mixture to bind and made a third cup to drizzle over cooked peppers. I also seasoned the last cup of gravy a little to give it some added flavor. It turned out pretty good despite the fact that I only had green peppers on hand. I am sure it will be even better with red.

I was happy to find a stuffed peppers recipe with ground beef and no tomato ingredient. This is a great basic recipe that stands beautifully on it’s own, or you can add as much of what you like to taste. My 2nd time making this I sautéed the onions and mushrooms first, added a 1/2 cup of uncooked 30 minute rice, some Italian bread crumbs, minced garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also didn’t blanch the peppers first and instead added a bit of water to the pan to steam a bit during cooking. Peppers came out al dente, which is the way we personally like them. Using small peppers makes for a very nice appetizer too!

make sure you use all lean meat and low fat cheese, b/c the fat can add up significantly when everything is done.

WOW! This was delicious! I seasoned the meat with Adobo and pepper, otherwise I followed the recipe as is. I served it in a pool of gravy with some brown rice, and warmed Hawaiian Rolls. I sent the two peppers I had left to my dad, and he called the next day RAVING about these. YUMMO!! It was so easy to make and the presentation was very pretty. I regret not taking a picture. I will be making this again and again and again.

Excellent switch up to green peppers with tomato sauce.  Had enough filling for 4 medium size red peppers.  Added garlic & cayenne to meat based on suggestions.  Used McCormick beef gravy mix packet, had 1 cup leftover so next time I'll cut that back.  Didn't boil peppers since I like them crisp, only baked for about 15min.  Used italian blend cheese since that's all I had.  Served brown rice on side.  So yum!  Will definitely make again!

I thought these were really tasty.  One thing that I forgot to add was the gravy so I'm sure that would have held the mixture together.  I won't forget that again next time; I make these!

Bland. I would add more seasoning other than salt & pepper. Using a beef gravy I decided to enhance it with a little steak seasoning. It made a great difference!

I love this one. It's great. I added minced garlic, jalapeno, and used a brown gravy mix. Also added more mushrooms and less beef.

We are trying to cut back on carbs (like everyone else these days), and my fiance bought a huge bag of red peppers from Costco. What to do? What to do? Thought I would give this a try, since this is the only recipe I found that doesn't have the dreaded white rice. It was suprisingly good. Very tasty. I will definitely make this again. I used shitake mushrooms combined with the regular button mushrooms. I think this was a good move. It added just a hint of something different. Great recipe. Thanks Bob!

This was really good.  I added a bit more seasoning: white pepper, onion salt and a touch of red pepper to give it a kick.  Excellent.  I will make it again.

Great simple recipe!  I added a little bit of old bay and a Tbsp of minced garlic to the meat mixture to give it a little bit more flavor (I'm an avid garlic lover) but other than that I didn't change a thing and the whole family loved it...even my picky 4yr old!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This recipe is amazing!  The only thing I did differently was dice up the pepper tops and add them to the meet mixture, I also mixed 1 cup of shredded Monterey Jack Cheese in the meat mixture, and chopped up one jalepeno pepper and put it into the meat mixture.  With everything else, I followed the recipe.  I did though add more mushrooms.  This is a recipe to share!  Thank You to whoever posted it!  :)

Great recipe! This was my first time making stuffed peppers and they came out delicious. I added a bit more seasoning and cut back to about 1 1/2 cups gravy. Will definately be making this one again. Thanks.

I didn't pre-cook the peppers or the hamburger, just upped the oven time to approx. 45 to 50 minutes. I also used BBQ sauce instead of gravy and pepper jack cheese.

This was pretty good but I agree with other reviewers that it needs seasoning. I served it over brown rice, but I think it would be better with mashed potatoes.

My first attempt at making stuffed peppers, in fact I didn't think I liked stuffed peppers... but this recipe proved me wrong. So easy to make, I even cheated and used canned mushrooms and omitted the onions and this still turned out great. I did season the meat for extra flavor, and for the gravy I made The Simplest Beef Gravy from this site and I was impressed. This recipe is a keeper.

Agreeing with other comments--it is bland on its own but with spicy peppers etc, it was pretty good. We enjoyed this recipe after some seasoning.

Found this rather bland. Only put half the meat and doubled the mushrooms. Added fresh parsley, oregano and garlic. And still found it too meaty. Could imagine this  being great with some chopped tomato , less gravy and diced aubergine.

This is THE best low-carb alternative to Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches. Who needs the bun when you can have all this flavor!

I jazzed up the beef by adding 3-4 tbs of dijon mustard, 3 garlic cloves and doubling the amount of onion.  Great recipe but the beef mixture needs some embellishments.

Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five was because I had to tweak the spices quite a bit.  Otherwise was too bland for my taste.  But this was really good.  Definitely use red peppers instead of green.  I also added cheese into the meat mixture.  Did not parboil the peppers as I was worried they might become too soft after baking them.  They turned out wonderful.  Nice and firm but soft enough to eat.  We loved this a lot.

Very good but I took other people's advice and used more spices...cayenne, paprika and garlic all added to the meat at the beginning rather than at the end. I will probably make this again

Hey Bob, I'm so happy that I wasn't the only person in the world who considered making stuffed peppers using a brown gravy instead of the same ol' tomato sauce. O.K., so I didn't use beef, however, the thought entered my mind as I was trying to figure out a way of utilizing my leftover lamb from Easter. I specifically sought out this type of recipe and was thrilled to actually find one! YIPPEE, family loved the change! Thanks!

I thought they were fine, but nothing special. I would make them again, but I would use more spices then the recipe calls for. I ended up having to put hot sauce on them just to make it more flavorful!! Granted I didn't use extra gravy, I didn't add any after it had been in the oven. But that shouldn't have made much difference.

I had so many peppers from my garden this year, I didnt know what to do with them all. I found this recipe and made it for a BBQ my family and I were going to. EVERYONE there flipped out over these pepper. Thank you so much for sharing. My friends and I will be making these again and again. Oh, just one more thing. I added some crushed garlic and toppped it off with some garlic and pepper cheese. Yummy.

I had never thought of just using meat, mushrooms and gravy to stuff a pepper before.  It's a tasty result!!  I made some variations to the original recipe.  NOTE: I changed the recipe to 1 serving (1/2 pepper per person).  First, I doubled the beef in the recipe.  I then cooked in (I'm estimating the measurements) 1/8 Cup Worstirshire Sauce, couple splashes of Balsamic Vinegar, 1 tsp. each of oregano, basil, cilantro, and parsley to the browned beef.  Then I added the gravy.  I stuffed the peppers and put them in the oven.  Then I used the extra beef with another jar of sauce to make a side dish with white rice.  Such a yummy meal!  It's a must try. My husband and I couldn't get enough.

Nice, simple variation of the standard stuffed bells. My husband liked them. My kids, however, went hungry. I expected that with this recipe, though, because if anyone finds a way to get a bell pepper past a kid, then they are a culinary genious! Thanks!

I added some rice to fill it out and absorb liquid. I also added celery, 4 cloves of garlic, used a red onion and seasoned with Cajun. I also took the advice of a commentor and didn't cook the peppers beforehand, adding 1/2 inch of water to the pan so the peppers were al dente. Good recipe, will probably make again, with a few more variations

I was looking for a simple recipe for stuffed bell peppers, and this is it. I didn't have beef gravy or mushrooms available, but I did have a very chunky organic condensed cream of portabella mushroom soup and some really tasty low-sodium beef bouillon cubes. So, I dissolved 2 bouillon cubes in 16 oz of the condensed mushroom soup (without thinning it) and used that in place of gravy and mushrooms in the recipe. I added some crushed garlic, too. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I served it with garlic-&-herb mashed potatoes & a side salad. 

Short-cuts for this recipe: Use diced frozen onions. Monthly brown 4 pounds of lean ground beef, put 1/4 of the browned, drained meat into each of 4 quart-size ziploc bags, & freeze until needed. In this case, you'd just grab a bag of the precooked browned beef, throw it in the skillet long enough to sautée the onions & mushrooms, then just add gravy since it's already drained.

Gluten-free alternative: use GF gravy or use my modification with Pacific Natural Foods Cream of Mushroom condensed soup & GF bouillon cubes. 

Lower the fat content by rinsing the drained ground beef with hot water, and using vegetarian ground beef replacement for 1/2 of the ground beef, and using low-fat cheese. (Using rice or bread as extenders will add starchy carbs.)

I made these the other day and they did happen to turn out very well -- definitly something different for dinner. I just need to find some way to spice it up a little better something to knock you in the face when you eat it . Overall, a wonderful starter recipe and especially easy to make if you are not the Ultimate Chef.

This was okay. I would probably make it again for an easy dinner.

Delishous, quick, easy, and a lower carb alternative.  I used ground venison instead of beef and it turned out fabulous.  I added cheese into my mixture and stuffed some graded cheese into each bell pepper.  Good recipe!

This dish was a hit.  It's definitely preferable to the standard stuffed peppers with tomato and rice.

We all enjoyed this very much and it's a nice change of pace from traditional stuffed peppers.  I didn't add any extra salt because I used bottled gravy which has more than enough salt.  I served this with mashed potatoes and will definitely make again.

My family was not thrilled when I said I was making stuffed peppers for dinner until they tasted this recipe. There wasn't a bit of food leftover. I made mashed potatoes as a side dish which complimented the gravy. Thanks Bob, this is a keeper!

This dish was excellent.  The only change I made was I used bbq sauce instead of brown gravy, and it tasted great!
