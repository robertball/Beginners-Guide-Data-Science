I thought this recipe called for way too much BBQ sauce and really overpowered the meat and my mouth!  I think I would try it again, but with about half the sauce.

This was a great way to quickly cook up my leftover beef and it was good too. Super easy sloppy-joes

This was a very easy receipe, however I didn't measure anything so my version could be drier than the original.  I used leftover chopped brisket and several opened bottles of BBQ sauce and ketsup; I just kept adding sauce until it looked like typical chopped BBQ beef.  The beef was ready in less than 15 minutes too.

I didn't care much for this recipe, although my husband thought it okay.  Another reviewer is quite right in that by the time you get the sauce to a sticky level, the meat is way overcooked.  Might be better to cook up the sauce first, then add the meat in but I'm not going to bother trying.

Hubby really liked these - me, not so much but I am not a huge BBQ sauce fan.  I had thin sliced roast beef and that worked great for a fast and easy dinner.

Didn't like this one. Too much sauce and I thought the reduction process overcooked the already cooked meat.
