My husband and I enjoyed this recipe; however I prefer to know the measurements of the ingredients (minced onion and garlic and Worcestershire sauce). Also it never mentioned when to put the cheese in so I used shredded cheese and mixed it in before baking.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The noodles were dry and bland. I think it needed more cheddar cheese.

This had great flavor. I do think that adding a little more sour cream makes it creamier and a less dry in the end. I think it could be better is is was not as dry.

This is a good idea but it only tasted great after I added more cheddar and sour cream. I used spaghetti squash instead of pasta.
