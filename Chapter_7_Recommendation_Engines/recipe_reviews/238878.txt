Followed instructions as written and loved this recipe.  Was so much easier than others I found online for sweet potato waffles.  

The only small problem I had was that I was using fresh sweet potatoes that I boiled and mashed so my batter was pretty thick.  I had to help the batter spread in the waffle iron since the weight of the lid was not enough.

Will be sharing this with friends and family!

Love the recipe,  I did double it and instead of 2/3 X  cup milk I used 2.5  cup milk, an 3 egg and  1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups white. I blended the sweet potato and wet ingredients in a blender and then added to dry. MY HUSBAND LOVED LOVED LOVED these waffles and the ever so tasty cranberry maple syrup.   Thank you for this recipe :)

Followed the recipe exactly using canned sweet potatoes (in syrup).  The texture was perfect and the family loved both the waffles and the cranberry maple syrup.   It was a great way to begin the day and welcome autumn.

The waffles were absolutely delicious!! We loved them. I didn't have cranberry sauce so I just sprinkled a few Craisins on top with some toasted Pecans and warm Maple Syrup. My problem with this recipe is that it is super thick batter. It took forever to cook and stuck really badly in the waffle iron after I brushed it with veg. oil.  I ended up adding an additional 2/3c. milk and another egg . I got really frustrated trying to get the first one out .  I had to practically bathe the waffle iron  in vegetable oil just to get it to only get mildly stuck. BUT I will say the taste redeemed this recipe. I would try it again and hopefully remember to modify it. Five stars for taste but 4 stars because this batter really was a pain in the behind to use in the waffle iron.

I think these would have been good. But mine stuck to the waffle iron so bad I couldn’t even salvage anything. Not sure how I will get this clean! LOL anybody have any suggestions how to keep this from sticking? I Put lots of spray on waffle iron. Would love to make them again. But no way until I solve the mystery! I gave it four stars because I think the flavor is good. But I don’t know how to cook them!

The amount of milk in this recipe has to be doubled to make a ladleable batter. I did not make the maple cranberry sauce syrup recipe. I made maple syrup with reconstituted dried canberries and the last of my frozen wild blueberries in it.

Followed the recipe as written and it made a super thick consistency.  I kept adding milk until it got close enough to a batter.  Other than that the taste was great. Next I'll half the flour  or twice as much milk and see which works.

After I decided I was making this I realize I was out of flour so I did a little bit of adjusting and used pancake mix. I found the directions for this recipe minus the baking powder and the flour and then I added an extra half a cup of milk.    I gave it five stars because I have no idea what it would've been like with the flour and the baking powder but the taste of this was amazing! I served it with chicken cutlets and just use regular Syrup because I don't my cranberries. My husband had the leftovers for  lunch today only because he couldn't eat anymore last night he was so stuffed :-)

This was a good recipes to follow. I had a medium sweet potato that I cooked in the microwave and cooled. This I smashed into sour cream and peanut butter and a bit of molasses  instead of milk and butter  I did add some pecans and chocolate chips too. Baked up nicely in my waffle iron

I made these without nutmeg - how did I have none let and not know it!?

I enjoyed them. The recipe made 4 large belgian waffles - one for me, one for him and one for each dog!! (Not having nutmeg turned out well for the dogs!)

made the recipe and loved it, we both are sweet tooths so we felt it needed a little more sugar...also if you're using a Belgian Waffel iron you will need to crank it up to a higher setting or they don't cook all the way through
