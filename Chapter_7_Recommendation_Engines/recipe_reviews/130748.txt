This recipe reads like that for a very sweet Manhattan.  I scaled it down to one drink and as promisedit WAS very sweet, so not fair of me to judge. (The hot water is there to melt the sugar, I imagine).  If you omit the sugar and sub grenadine (maraschino cherry "juice") that actually might lesson the toothache factor.  I'm a sucker for a Bourbon Manhattan so this is a fun recipe to toy with!

The hubs....aka the Manhattan King....loved it.  The bitters do help with the extra sugar.  Added extra cherry juice, just for his personal preference.
