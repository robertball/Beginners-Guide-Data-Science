KEEPER! I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was great. I had to go to the Asian store for the Miso Paste - it is in the refrigerated section. This is company worthy, for sure. I served it with grilled fresh pineapple & sugar snap peas with a simple green salad with Miso Sesame Dressing from this site. What a great meal!

Tried the recipe last night.  Skirt steak is a cheap flavorful cut, perfect for marinades like this.  I make a similar recipe, add mirin and maple syrup, on Sea Bass and broil in the oven.  Yum!  Next time I'll add maple syrup.

WOW!!! What's not to love about this!?!?  This was of the best skirt steaks I have ever eaten, and I prepare it often using many different recipes. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect - no changes necessary - but I wouldn't expect any less from Chef John! Very tender and flavorful. I'm not sure why the other reviewer's steak was tough. Skirt steak needs to be cut against the grain.  Miso paste can be obtained from any Asian market in the refrigerated section. Sure, it's not available in your everyday grocery store, but no reason to rate the recipe down for that! I'll definitely be making this for company and I know they'll be impressed!

I used on filet mignon and grilled it.  It was very tasty and unique.  My husband and teenage son loved it.  I am going to try on salmon tonight. I would recommend to add two teaspoons of MIRIN, which Japanese use a lot for TERIYAKI or MIso based  sauce. And for salmon, I would add a little bit of ginger to kill the fishy smell. Yummy!

This was absolutely delicious!!  Only reason for 4 stars is because of the difficulty of obtaining the yellow miso paste!  Few ingredients, easy prep, love it and will do again!

It was very tasy and easy to make.  I did have to make an extra trip to get the Miso, but well worth it.  Thanks Chef John!

I give this three stars for the flavor. I made this following the recipe exactly. While I loved the flavor, the steak itself was tough. I cooked it to exactly 140 degrees (rare).  This is the first time I have cooked skirt steak, and unless I can figure out why it was so tough (I couldn't even eat half of my serving. I gave up trying to chew it because my jaw ached) I won't be fixing this again.

OMG is this to die for.  I did not change a thing.  So easy to fix and a wonderful flavor.  I also did the cherry tomatoes on the grill like the video and served with sauteed spinach.  I found Miso at HEB/Central Market.  Any store that prepares sushi will have it for sale.

Good recipe, I've been cooking skirt steak for over 40 years and its one of my favorite pieces of meat. That said, you can ruin it by cooking it too much. It must be med rare to be tender with or without a marinade. If you don't like steak cooked red, don't bother with this cut because you will never be happy.

I love this. My husband said its too much miso so next time i would wipe the steak down before i cook it. I also use the fork to tenderize the meat while marinate.

This was a 10 star recipe! I didn't have red miso so I used the white miso I had on hand as well as used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. It was amazing! I tried the marinade raw and it wasn't good. I love chef johns recipes and figured he wouldn't steer me wrong, and this was not a disappointment! This will def be my go to for skirt steak. Next time I'll try it with the red miso and brown sugar.

My family enjoyed this recipe but I have to say we are all pretty sick of it now.  Lol.  Mostly I think it's the skirt steak.  Sometimes it's tough and chewy.  I first attempted this recipe after seeing the video - I'm a visual person so I like to see how it's done.  Very easy to make.  Doesn't need to marinade overnight.  Sort of tastes like the beef teriyaki you get in local Chinese restaurants.

Probably the best "new" thing I have made in a while. Made as is and it was amazing! Company asked for more. My ONLY issue with this dish is I only double the recipe instead of tripling it. I found the miso paste at Whole Foods, if you have one in your area. Next time, I will do 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 red wine (that I will serve it with). That should bring out the flavors even more. 100% a keeper!!!

I am fan of skirt steak and miso.  The combination of all these ingredients was perfect.  Just the right amount of salty and sweet.  Chef John, you're the best.

I would have given this a 3 star because of the flavor if only I could have chewed my steak without my jaw getting sore.  I followed the directions to a tee, but I just couldn't finish it.  Luckily I had made a delicious potato casserole to go with it, so I didn't starve.

Thank you Chef John for introducing me to Skirt Steak.  I made this recipe and the coffee/soda recipe and both were awesome!  And so quick!  The only alteration I will make next time is to add a little extra miso....just a personal preference.  YUM!

For those who complained of a tough steak, Chef John notes in the video and written recipe the steak should be cooked medium-rare to medium, not rare as this will result in a tough steak. Great flavor and pairs beautifully with his Pickled Ginger Asian Pear Coleslaw!

Followed the recipe but only had white miso.  It still turned out great. Used it on a tri- tip and it had a really good flavor.  Highly recommended.

This I love, so easy and good. I read a few other comments about their steaks being hard to chew. What you have to do with Skirt or Flank Steak is to cut it across the grain.  You will have melt in your mouth tender steak at medium rare.

Had it last night.  We found Minute Miso in Roger's Supermarket in St. Joe.  We went to Falatic's meat market and they didn't have skirt steak, suggested flank steak.  We followed the recipe and we all thought it was great.
It is tender when it is cooked at least to medium.  Rarer, as Chef John said, is tough.  Surley wondered why her's/his was tough and it was because they cooked it rare.
I'm going to make it for company.

Followed the directions as listed.  We cooked it in the broiler for a total of 5 minutes,  The meat was tender however the flavor was average.   It seemed to be lacking something distinctive.  We will try it again however we add 1-2 more cloves of garlic and some flavored sea salt.
