This was really good. I added a bag of frozen stir-fry peppers and onion (I microwaved them for a couple of minutes first) and a teaspoon of ground ginger. After five hours on low I turned it up to high, stirred in about 2 Tbsp dissolved corn starch (I like thick sauce) and a tin of mandarine orange segments. By the time the rice was done, the sauce was nicely thickened. It tasted very soy-saucy to me, but was still very good and my husband really liked it, which is a big plus (he's picky). Super easy, I'll be making this again! Thanks!

I was looking for a slow cooker orange chicken so decided to give this one a try inspite of the bad reviews.  I made quite a few changes and it turned out wonderful (which is why the 4 stars).  this is what I did:
1st, I seasoned the chicken with s&p, garlic powder and dusted in flour then deep fried till golden brown.  Then I put drained chicken in crockpot with other ingred + 2 heaping Tablespoons of orangejuice concentrate and 1/2 cup of honey.  When the meal was finished I placed the chicken under the broiler until a bit crispy then dusted in toasted sesame seeds.  It turned out delish this way!!!

This was absolutely terrible, and there was nothing in it that I didn't like.  I followed it exactly to instructions.  If you like boiled chicken (which I don't) this is for you.  If you do try it, I recommend browning the chicken before putting it in the crock pot.  Maybe that will help.  Blah.

I made this and added a few touches, a tbs of ginger, and a tbs of pepper and a tbs of garlic. 2 fresh chopped small onions and some green onions as well.  It was good and I will make it again. I'm going to try using OJ next time instead of the orange soda.  :)

If you like the combination of sweet and salty, you'll like this recipe.  My husband and kids were able to eat it but they'd rather I not make it again.  The sweet and salty don't mix well with us, but it was easy to prepare.

Love the taste!  I used diet orange soda for a healthier version.  I also sprinkled a bit of ginger on the chicken.  Hubby and I both enjoyed this easy recipe.

I wouldn't make this again.  The orange soda and soy sauce made for a rather "interesting" mix.  Neither of us could eat more than one bite.

Well, it was easy, that's why it gets 1 star...I notice that most people who rated this high made a lot of additions to the recipe.  I made it as written.  When I got home, I lifted the lid and was greeted by an unappealing aroma. I am surprised this did not turn out at all, it seemed like a good idea.

the orange was TOO over powering, and mixed with just the soy sauce, it tasted bad. I think I'll stick to the longer-to-prep Asian Orange Chicken recipe on the website... that one is to die for.

This was the best chicken I've had in a while. It was so tender and juicy! My husband and I had it over rice like it is in the picture, along with fresh steamed green beans. The sauce was watery but it was great because we used the left-overs with some flour to make a chicken orange gravy. So simple, quick and yummy!

I'm not sure I would make this again, it was either too sweet or bland in places, the chicken was hardly flavored and it was just too much.

This was so simple! Our chicken was frozen when we put it in the slow cooker and it came out so tender and juicy. We will be making this again.

did not care for it AT ALL. When a recipe calls itself "Orange Chicken", it brings a certain expectation to mind about what the end product will be. If you are expecting the "Orange Chicken" you get when you order it from your local Chinese takeout, you will be sadly disappointed. It isn't that sticky, sweet, breaded orange chicken you are used to. I found this chicken to be overly salty, and otherwise bland, and I could barely taste the orange flavor at all. Honestly, this chicken tasted like a watered down soy sauce flavored chicken with a TINY hint of orange. Sorry, but definitely not one of my favorites! Won't make it again.

I agree with RUHRUH1979, this recipe was horrible.  She suggested that it might taste better if you brown the chicken first, believe me, it doesn't do a thing for it. To each their own.

One point for great idea! I made this and added somethings to make it less bland.  It didn't work and my garlic and ginger turned black. No worries right - I strained it out and made a yummy sweet and tangy sauce to save it. But as the previous poster mentioned the texture of the chicken is too soft.  It isn't like a dry taste when it's overcooked but, it's just not the texture you want for an asian dish. I gave an extra star because the juice made a great sauce. I just added a little cornstarch and sugar to sweeten it up. Yum. Me.

Boy, I sure wish I had read these reviews first!!!!! What an absolute HORRIBLE recipe! I had to tweak it aaaaall the way around...from corn starch for thickening, to a whole HECK of a LOT of brown sugar, just to even begin to make it palatable!!! I added the corn starch & onions at the end, while the rice cooked. Did not thicken!! Even had to add actual orange juice to make it taste like ORANGE chicken. ????????

Added a can of mandarin oranges, one fresh peeled orange, plus one onion cut into chunks.  The chicken retained an excellent flavor and moistness despite the overwhelming tangy flavored onions and oranges.

I found it to be very tasty. I used all of the ingredients the recipe but added a few things.  I bought one large orange and added the juice from it, just because.  I added two slices of ginger to the liquid and cut up one garlic clove and added it as well.  I used a bit of pepper on both sides of the chicken breasts.  After it was done cooking I used flour to thicken the juice into a gravy to add to the rice.

It didn't seem to make sense that just soda and soy sauce could make it taste good. I added 1/2 cup of Italian dressing, 1tsp of red pepper flakes and ginger, garlic salt to taste, 1/3 cup of packed brown sugar, and drizzled honey over he mixture. It turned out okay, just the chicken was a little dry

For what it was (in the recipe) it was a good dish for a college student with limited cooking space. It could be improved with added ingredients, like a   previous reviewer demonstrated.

This was pretty good. I made it more like a stir fry and not in the slow cooker. I added some sesame seeds at the end. I'm not sure I'll make it again, but I wouldn't say it was bad.
