Our family eats it like this, but we add the hard boiled egg last so that it is not totally mushy.

The lemon juice was  a bit too much since it overpowered the taste. I will put in on a romaine salad with croutons with a touch of balsalmic instead of throwing it away. Its a good combo of protein and good fats but I won't make again.

This is a great alternative to plain jane egg salad sandwiches. I followed the recipe and was delighted with the favor. Personally, I used tortilla bread and made a wrap. Don't fill to much it was bursting out the other end. Great for a quick sandwich or with chips. Thanks
