This is a good cake, but there's another recipe on this site that I prefer for pineapple and pecans.  Two cups of sugar for the cake seemed excessive to me, so I cut it to one, and that was more than enough sweetness for us. I checked the cake at 30 minutes, it was already very brown and slightly overcooked, so watch your time.  Although the cream cheese frosting is tasty, the one thing that I didn't like is that it just never really set or hardened at all, stayed very gooey.

The cake was super bland.  I had a feeling it would be so I added about 2 tbsp butter, and 1/4 c brown sugar to the pecans to make a caramel like coating on the nuts, then sprinkled them on top of the cake and half mixed them in before baking.  The texture was OK, nice an dense like a carrot cake.  Add cinnamon and vanilla and I think it would be good.  I also added an extra 4 oz cream cheese, and cup of pwdr sugar to the frosting. I'm glad I did, the extra cream cheese frosting made up for the bland cake!

GOOD MOIST CAKE. ONE CUP SUGAR IS SWEET ENOUGH. NO NEED FOR ICING. MAYBE SPRINKLE OF POWDERED SUGAR.
