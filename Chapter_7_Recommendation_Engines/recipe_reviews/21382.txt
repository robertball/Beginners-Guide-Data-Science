These have worked for me EVERY time I've made them. The only thing I do different is roll the dough a little thinner, then fold over once and cut as usual.  This creates a natural "center" that the biscuit opens right to.  Love this with honey on top.

Perfect biscuits!  Firm enough to stand up to a dousing of gravy, but moist and fluffy enough to eat with jam.  For those who are having trouble with these biscuits, flour makes a world of difference in a biscuit recipe.  If you live in the South, try White Lily or another low protein flour.  If you live in the North or West, replace 2-3 Tbsp of all purpose flour with cake or Wondra flour for the best results.  Northern flour, especially the nicer brands, have too much protein to make a good biscuit.

These are nice and light biscuits. I used 1-cup of buttermilk in place of the 3/4-cup Milk and they were delicios!  "Never Fail" stands up to its promise!  I recommend using these for berry shortcakes or topped with a peach and some juice, with a dollop of whipped cream.  This is a keeper!

This is the biscuit recipe I've searched everywhere for! Flaky on the outside, soft and thick on the inside. I doubled the recipe and made about 18 instead of 24, and I think they were the perfect size.
The only suggestion I would make would be to grate the butter in a food processor and then add it to the dry ingredients; it mixes right in and is much faster.

Very good! Nice and flaky! I don't have any biscuit cutters, so I always use the top of a glass jar that is about the same size around to cut the dough, just dip it in flour before cutting each one. Works the same for me! Thank you Madison!

These biscuits were great!  I have never had success with homemade biscuits until I tried this recipe.  They were nice and flaky with a hint of sweetness.  They were simply perfect...not to mention quick and easy to make!  Thanks a million!

Wonderfully flaky, tender and richly flavored biscuits! I've been trying to find a good biscuit recipe that didn't call for shortening, as did my old favorite recipe, because I'm now living in Finland where crisco, sadly, does not exist. I'm no longer lamenting my misfortunes, though, as I found this excellent recipe that yields a biscuit that is comparable in flakiness to a shortening biscuit, but it's taste is way more flavorful and buttery. I will be using this recipe from now on and am so happy to have found something to bake that sure does remind of being back home. I will note that I didn't use cream of tartar, simply because there isn't any available here, but the biscuits still turned out tasty and fluffy... I could only imagine that they would be even fluffier with the cream of tartar, though. So, if you're worried about not having any tartar, don't sweat it. The baking powder works just fine.

MY FAMILY LOVES THESE BISCUITS!!! Before all my biscuits turned out like little crackers(baker error of course) This recipe truly lives up to its name.  Even I couldn't mess these up. I'm an excellent baker, but biscuits had always been my down fall...until now.

I followed the recipe exact. Instead of cutting the biscuits with a glass, I rolled into a 3/4 inch thick circle, then used a pizza cutter to cut the circle into eighths (they looked like scones, little triangles). I brushed them with butter before baking. I did not try them myself but the boys raved about them. My husband said they're one of the best biscuits he's ever had.

I've made a fair amount of biscuits in my life. These were the best I've ever made! I put all the dry ingredients into a large food processor and pulsed. Then I added the butter and processed it until it was incorporated. I added the milk straight into the processor while it was running until the dough formed a ball. This took less than five minutes and made clean up a breeze! I did not have the cream of tarter, but it turned out just fine...

These were amazing! It is the first time I ever made Biscuits and it was so perfectly simple. I followed the recipe exactly. Just be careful not to leave them in longer than required, you can't see the bottoms, they are much darker than the tops. So as soon as that 10 min. is done, take them out. Loved this, will make them again!

This is my GO TO RECIPE for biscuits!  It wasn't until this recipe that I finally made a real biscuit that was edible!  Tips: I turn my oven up to ~500° F and get it HOT!  I use my food processor to mix my dry and butter all in.  Then I use a little less than 1/2 c. buttermilk (I take whole milk, heat it up, and throw some lemon into it).  Then I bake them for about 10 minutes and also broil the tops of them some.  KILLER biscuits!  I am a TRUE southern cook now ;)))

Raised light and tall, yet were moist and not crumbly.  I grated in a stick of frozen butter (I keep some in the freezer).  Mix just until dough holds together and then let it sit for a minute or two instead of mixing in every bit of flour.  Tasty and easy recipe.

I've used this recipe every time I've made biscuits in the last year.  They're always tasty.  Just make sure not to over-mix so the biscuits stay light and fluffy.

These biscuits were great!  I made them for Father's Day and my dad loved them.  I like a more buttery biscuit so I melted 2 tablespoons of butter and painted it on while I kneaded the dough and added a little more flour.  My cousin liked them a lot and told me they tasted like professional biscuits.  Thanks, Madison, for a great recipe!

These biscuits are even better if you use a tablespoonful of vinegar to the milk to sour it before adding it to the other ingredients.  Unbeatable!

The best!!  I have tried dozens of biscuit recipes, and for some reason, managed to turn them all into hard lumps.  But these survived, and went on to bake into light, flaky, delicious biscuits!  Wonderful flavor, super texture- I'm so excited, I think I'll eat them all!

Followed recipe, except for the cream of tartar that I did not have at the moment. First batch of biscuits came out a little bit burnt, so I lowered the heat to 425 and baked for 8 minutes, they turned out really nice. Just be careful to watch your biscuits especially on the last baking minutes so they don´t get burned.

BEST BISCUITS EVER! Followed recipe exactly and these were amazing. They complimented my roast and mashed potatoes nicely and the kids are already asking for them for breakfast tomorrow! Two things to note...do the fold over method that another reviewer mentioned to get that perfect break in your biscuit and brush with melted butter straight out of the oven!

I followed the recipe except I left out the sugar and the biscuits were fluffy, layered and tasty. Next time I will increase the salt to 1 tsp.

These taste excellent, but they didn't rise very much. I am probably doing something wrong though. Definitely an easy recipe, I will be making these again!

I was looking for a good biscuits recipe and I found it. I used to use baking soda but the cream of tartar makes a huge differece. They came out tasting like KFC biscuits and thats what I was looking for. Thanks for sharing.I will make it like this from now on.

I've been making this biscuit recipe for nearly 30 years, with the following differences:  1/2 cup shortening instead of butter(sometimes I use vegetable oil or bacon drippings),
2 pkgs. splenda or 2 tsp. sugar.
To keep your biscuits light and fluffy,
mix only until blended. Over mixing will cause your biscuits to be not as light. I bake mine at 425 degrees for 20 minutes.

This recipe is great!  I used buttermilk instead of regular, oops forgot to omit the salt so it was too salty but that was my fault.  They were flaky and yummy though

At 465 calories and almost 25 grams of fat per biscuit, they would have to be a once in a while treat for my family.  Certainly not helpful for healthy eating.

Tried this for the first time and it came out awesome! They were soft and just like a biscuit taste and texture should be. However, I read one reviewers comment and they suggested using 1 cup buttermilk instead of the 3/4 cup milk, so when I tried buttermilk the second time making these biscuits, I now never make biscuits with plain milk, because they are too easy to crumble. The buttermilk biscuits hold up much better and we use them for morning breakfast biscuits with eggs, chicken apple sausage and maple syrup. Yummy!!! I give this 4 stars for the milk recipe but 5 stars for the buttermilk recipe! This one is for my "pass-down-to-my-kids" recipe box :)

I failed :o( And I SO didn't want to! I followed the directions to a "T" (because I have NEVER been able to make a proper biscuit) but I had to bake them longer just to get some color on them.  The tops were ok but had a strange after taste. The bottoms were crispy yet still tasted like flour (??). I'm not sure what I did but I'll keep trying with different recipes. Maybe, eventually, one of these years, I'll be able to make a proper biscuit ::sigh::

great and simple recipe for breakfast biscuits from scratch  I skipped the cream of tartar. Let's face it, who has any of that in an average pantry?  Frankly i just skipped entirely and the biscuits were great!

Great biscuits! Mine didn't rise quite as big as I hoped they would, but this could be due to the fact that I have a terrible eye for measurements. I think I rolled the dough a bit thinner than 3/4". Otherwise, I was very pleased and for once I didn't serve my family hockey pucks for dinner! Thanks for the great recipe. This will be a regular in my house!

these were easy - I used a food processor to mix all the dry and cut the butter in.  I baked them until they were done but not brown and then froze them for my husband to pull out before work.

UPDATE: I made drop biscuits using this recipe by mixing in 1 cup of a four-cheese blend, a 4.5 ounce can of chopped green chilies (drained) and some minced garlic just before the milk.  I dropped them using a tablespoon on to a pan in 9 large mounds and baked them for 12 minutes.  They turned out great!  ORIGINAL: I can't give this recipe enough stars.  I have always made lump/heavy biscuits in the past.  I follow the directions to a "T" and they turn out great every time!  I use a 1 cup measuring cup to cut them at about 1/2 inch thick and they plump up beautifully (it makes 8 total that way).  Thank you!

My biscuits looked absolutely great, but they tasted funny!  When I made the recipe, it was supposed to make four servings and it called for 4 teaspoons of baking powder.  I'm a new cook and I used baking soda instead of baking powder (didn't have powder).  I just did some research and read that baking soda is four times as strong as baking powder.  Perhaps this is why my biscuits tasted funny?  I guess I will have to be more careful next time when adding ingredients.  Other than this, they were great.  I'll definitely try them again.  UPDATE: when baking powder and not baking soda is used, these biscuits are perfect.  I’ve never tried another biscuit recipe. :)

I was inspired to try this due to the beautiful picture submission. Up to this point, this reviewer has only been able to produce doorstops, paperweights, and hockey pucks.  These biscuits were not only edible, but were delicious.  So flakey, light, and airy.  I used the recipe to top a turkey pie, and had 3 good size ones to have with butter and my favorite pumpkin honey.  Just delicious.  This would be a great biscuit for strawberry shortcake...maybe just add a bit more sugar.  I subbed the sugar with 2 tsp raspberry honey.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe that has brought me up from the pits!

Excellent biscuits!  I did use 1/4 C soy flour and 1 3/4 C unbleached plain flour to make them more healthy.  Baked for 10 mins. at 450 in a greased 12" iron skillet.  Browned beautifully on bottom and top!

Awesome recipe.  I have been looking for a biscuit recipe that I liked and would be my go to recipe.  This was the best!  Very flaky and moist inside.  Turned out perfectly and by far my favorite.  I didn't add the sugar in though.  I like them like biscuits and to taste like them.  Delicious!  I did everything by hand.  Smooshed the cold butter into the flour mixture with my fingers and added the milk and mixed with my hands.  Don't over work the dough.  Just enough to get all the milk absorbed.  I only kneaded it about 5-6 times and patted with my hands.  I didnt use a rolling pin because you are over working the dough.  Thanks for the recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing unless I want to make them buttermilk in which I would use buttermilk instead of milk.

My wife who is a Chef, was excited when she saw them and couldn't eat them fast enough. These were great, light and fluff. Made as directed except I brushed the tops with melted butter when I pulled them out of the oven. Excellent alone or with sausage gravy!

These are the best biscuts I have ever made! The cream of tartar makes all the difference.......it's the only ingredient missing from the recipe I've been using for years and these biscuts are soooooo much better! They are light, fluffy and tasty! I used someone else's suggestion to grate the cold butter on my cheese grater, it made mixing up the dough very easy, great idea! I made these a few hours before dinner, popped the tray in the freezer, then pre- heated the oven at dinner time and baked them. Served them tonight with homemade soup and salad. Yum!

Awesome biscuits, and so easy to make!  I whisked all the dry ingredients in a bowl, then transferred it into the bowl of a food processor.  Added the butter and let it go until it looked like course cornmeal, transferred it back to the bowl and added the milk.  Use double sheet pans to prevent the bottoms from burning.  So easy and light and fluffy!

Really. The perfect biscuit! And I love that is has no shortening, just a great butter flavor. 

My grandma taught me: one of the tricks of a GREAT biscuit is to really cut the fat into it well (she used shortening). It should look kinda like coarse cornmeal, then add your liquid and pat them out and cut with floured sharp-sided biscuit cutter. Dull cutters don't make nice biscuits!

GREAT biscuits!  Great taste, great texture.  Will definitely make again.  Only thing was, I used a 2inch wide cookie cutter and the biscuits were too small.  Will use the bigger cutter next time....

Oh YUMMY!  These were fluffy but substantial enough for country sausage gravy!  I took the suggestion to fold rolled dough in half prior to cutting to achieve a natural break in the biscuit.

These were great biscuits!  Turned out light and flaky--delcious on their own with a pat of butter, or perfect with sausage gravy.

very surprised at how the biscuits turned out as i've never been happy with any recipes attempted thus far. this recipe was very easy and the results were extremely good. mine came apart in layers. usually leftover biscuits are thrown out but these were eaten as snacks and gone by the end of the day. thank you very much for sharing.

PERFECT!!! I usually end up with dense biscuits but these were great. I mixed the dry ingredients and butter in the food processor, then transfered to a bowl and stirred in the milk. Then just had to pat out and cut with a glass since I don't have a biscuit cutter. 

My husband loved how light and fluffy they turned out. Definetly will make again.

Wow - I always wanted to know how to make biscuits like these and now I do! They were delicious, flakey, buttery - my husband went back for thirds! Thank you for submitting this - it is now my new 'good old reliable' biscuit recipe!

Update: These are now officially called the 'oh my god' biscuits! :)

I have NEVER been able to make biscuits until I found this recipe. My Biscuits came out just like KFC biscuits and we love them. I even looked up KFC biscuit recipe and it calls for shortning which I don't have overseas(West Africa). I can say this was a great recipe. Just don't twist when cutting your dough. I found out that is the trick. My husband can't get enough of these biscuits.

This recipe was so delicious!!! Easily the best biscuits I've ever tasted! So moist, I added a tiny bit of Italian herbs to the dough and they added a very nice flavor. Also, I rolled out the dough extra thin and stacked layers of dough with a SLIGHT brushing of oil in between the layers. I will definitely make these again!

Oh what to do for the school holidays without much mess!! These biscuits were great for the kids to make, Turned out perfect! We even added a crushed up easter egg that we have in abundance and a hint of vanilla essence. Fantastic they are a hit! although I think well be making some again this afternoon they are nearly all gone!

Came together nicely with ingredients that I always have on hand.  Good flavor, but mine raised very nicely then seemed to fall a bit the longer they baked.  Next time I will try brushing some melted butter on top for more even browning...and I'll cut them to get 9 instead of 12 so they will be a bit bigger.  Thanks so much for sharing@

Wonderful!  I made a double batch.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  My husband was craving garlic cheese biscuits and asked me to make the biscuits like Red Lobster so I added 1 cup shredded cheese, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 cup extra milk to the recipe. I mixed until just moistened and dropped them by teaspoon full on to the ungreased sheet pan. After they baked I brushed them with melted butter and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  They were all eaten up! Served with spaghetti and salad.  Thank you.  I will definately make these again either plain or jazzed up!

These were a lot like KFC biscuits..I loved them sooo much. Must Use real butter for the best flavor, not margerine or country crock. I think the cream of tarter is the key. This recope is a keeper!

Very good biscuits. If any manage to survive the day, they do not dry out like a lot of recipes do.  They are great warm with molasses on them.  A big thumps up Madison.  This is now my number one biscuit recipe.

Yum!  These are so simple, and so good... they work well as a base for using other flours (flax, soy, etc.) too, without losing the taste or flakiness.

These are great biscuits. They're light and fluffy and full of that great biscuit flavor. Nice and quick to make first thing in the morning. Great recipe!

Easily the best made from scratch biscuits I have ever made. I patted the dough out a bit thinner and so got about 15 biscuits, but next time I will make them much thicker. They have great flavor and texture. Make sure you cut the butter in until it is very fine.

Nice flavor, easy as any other biscuit. I froze my stick of butter and shredded it in instead of cutting it in. Worked fine.

I just made these for dinner. This is the perfect biscuit recipe for me since I hardly ever buy buttermilk; when I do it just doesn't get used before it goes bad. I see some reviewers criticizing the mere 2 tsp of sugar in this recipe.  Just so you know, these don't taste at all sweet.  I think the sugar is a nice balance for the cream of tartar in this recipe, which gives the dough a bit of tang would normally come from buttermilk. I served them warm from the oven with a soup and my family all enjoyed them.  Slightly crisp exterior with a tender flaky center. I did roll out the dough and then double it over as suggested, which I would do again. My only complaint would be that they didn't rise much at all, so next time I'll just roll them to the thickness I want them to be post-baking, which should do the trick. I'll end up with fewer than a dozen but our family of 4 doesn't need a dozen.  Give this recipe a try - easy and delicious!

Quick and easy, with nice flavor. I did add an extra tsp of sugar, because I like my biscuits a bit sweeter, but you couldn't really taste any sweetness. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I love these biscuits! I have made them many times and they are true to their name! (Unless you roll them too thin, then they become hockey pucks...lol. That was my second time making them and I didn't pay attention :/) I made these biscuits to go with a new sausage gravy recipe I found and my boyfriend says and I quote, "In all my 43 years of living and hundreds of plates of biscuits and gravy, THIS is the best plate EVER!" Now he is off to go brag about it at work

Totally easy. Used the food processor to do everything, and stuck the diced butter in the freezer for about 10 min before adding, but otherwise changed none of the ingredients. I used a small Pyrex dish to cut circles since i have every shaped cutter but round.

I was intimidated by cutting butter into flour after wasting an entire pound of butter trying to make a pie crust a few years back, but using the food processor and ice cold butter removed a lot of the opportunity for error.

I have been searching and searching for a biscuit recipe that works for me. My mom made homemade biscuits often when we were little and I loved it. These remind me of hers. They worked great. They kept disappearing off the pan and I could hear my kids making yummy noises as they snuck them lol these are a huge hit in my house and so easy to make. The dough is very easy to work with. They came out puffy and flaky and delicious. Thank you for the awesome recipe!!!!!

Perfect every time. I didn't have creme of tartar though so I just compensated with extra baking powder. I also melted some butter and and wiped it over the tops and bottoms of the biscuits with a brush when I pulled them out of the oven. They are to die for.

Great Recipe, I have tried several times to make biscuits that taste good and that are a little crisp on the outside but very tender on the inside.  This recipe is a winner.

So sorry to rate so low but, something is wrong with this recipe..I think it may call for too much baking powder. The texture of the biscuit is all wrong..

My family absolutely loved these biscuits. I had to make two dozen! The first went really fast. I did not have cream of tartar and I only used 4 tablespoons of butter (1/4 cup). (Those were my only changes.) I used my whisk to cut in the butter (I have not been able to find a pastry cutter in the stores in the town we just moved to.) This recipe has replaced all others I had.

I found this biscuit recipe a couple years ago and it has become our staple recipe. It is a very easy recipe and the biscuits are delicious. My 17 year old daughter has become the biscuit maker in the house so I rarely have to make them anymore.

Somehow I managed to "Fail" on Never Fail Biscuits.  Don't know what happened, but they didn't rise as in the pictures.  They tasted ok, but were like 1/2" thick.  Not at all what I expected.  Probably won't be trying this again.

These were great, I used butter flavored crisco, and due to others  saying they were not browned on top I brushed melted butter on the top, before bakin, I also baked at 425 because my oven is small and gets hotter than most ovens, happy with this biscuit, it did take longer to brown so next time i will bake at 450

Easy and delicious. I had to use water instead of milk because we were out, so the biscuits didn't brown correctly when baking and I accidentally overbaked them. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because they were STILL good!!!!!

So easy!  I've made these twice, once with cream of tartar and once with vinegar....I preferred the taste of the biscuits with the vinegar.  They were great both ways, though.  Awesome with sausage gravy...definitely a keeper!

These turned out pretty good.  I doubled the recipe, and in place of 4 coups of white flower, I used 2 cups of whole wheat flower and 2 cups white.  It needs some extra salt, so be mindful of that.

Yesterday morning I make biscuits from mix for my kids. This morning I decided to try my hand at from-scratch biscuits. What a difference! The kids gobbled these up. This recipe yields a delicious flakey biscuit. I did not have quite enough butter but 3/4 of a stick seemed to do the job just fine. I also had no cream of tarter. I ended up using 3 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda. They came out very light and fluffy. Like another reviewer, I rolled out my dough thinner and folded it over. I will absolutely  make these again! Thanks for the great recipe, Dakota.

These are absolutely fabulous and surprisingly easy to make. BUT . . . due to the very, very high calorie, fat & cholesterol count for each biscuit, these will be for special occasions only.

These biscuits are awesome.  My 4 year old wants these at least twice a week.  She would eat them everyday if I would let her.  I've never seen a buscuit recipe that had cream of tartar in it.  It makes all the difference. I will use this one from now on.

Turned out good, used butter in place of shortening. Would make these again.

Just wanted to note that I didn't have Cream of Tartar and they were lovely without!  I just added a touch bit more baking soda than was called for.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Never made biscuits.  I always ask my brother or sister to make them for me.   Guess what I made them and they were awesome.  Family says that mine were so good that they are begging me to make some more but make sure that I make a bigger batch.  I've made them twice since then.  Thank you!

These were GREAT.  So tasty, fluffy, and SUPER easy.  Not only are they delicious on their own, but I am sure they will be easy to zazz up with additional flavours - savoury and sweet.  Look forward to making them again.

This recipe really is "never fail."  Roll a little thinner than recommended, fold over and roll a little more so you have biscuits that split easily.

This recipe is true to it's name!!  I have tried to make biscuits so many times and failed, until I found this recipe. I tried folding over the batter like another reviewer shared, and it does work well to make a natural split. Thanks for a great recipe Dakota!

Never fail is right on the mark! I made biscuits for the first time and they were perfect, golden and delicious! I had to laugh as I realized that I had  biscuits and water for breakfast and forgotten about the bacon and eggs.

I always make these biscuits now.  I used to use the recipe on the back of the Clabber Girl Baking Powder can, but didn't like that it used shortening.  This one, thankfully, uses butter.

I've probably made these 10 times, at least, and they come out well.  I have had a problem with them being too crumbly, but I've never rolled out the dough and cut it--I just knead it in the bowl and then pull off biscuits and shape by hand.

Edit:  I've now figured out how to get nice, non-crumbly biscuits.  It helps a lot to actually roll out the dough, but if, in the morning you are like me, that's too much work.  If you "beat" the dough in the bowl about 25-30 times, really mashing it down and kneading it very well, and then break off and hand-roll/pat the biscuits out, they come out well.

If you are having trouble with flat/life-less biscuits, use self-rising flour in place of all-purpose.  I have the best success with half of each!

These were actually the best biscuits i've made. I only gave them a 4 instead of a 5 cause it seemed to be lacking something, not sure what, but being that i topped them with gravy for breakfast they were awesome. It made 9 biscuits for me that i cut out with a drinking glass. I baked them for 3 minutes longer than the recipe said just for extra browness to suit my liking. Overall, this gets put in my binder and the old recipe gets tossed out. TY!

Absolutely fabulous, easy, tasty recipe - thank you!  I used a little more sugar in my recipe, as we like our biscuits sweet, and used butter-flavored crisco - otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Delicious!

The dough was easy to work with. The problem was probably my oven, but these burned on the bottom and didn't really brown on the top.

At the risk of sounding like a real geek, working with this dough was like kneading a cloud, ha ha ha.  Talk about soft and easy to handle.  I think my oven must be 'off' because I had to bake these for almost 15 minutes.  Boy, do they look nice!  Mmmmmmmmmmm, warm from the oven, delicious!  Not flaky like some biscuits (not quite the American biscuit recipe I was looking for) but absolutely wonderful.  Will definitely make these again.

Very quick and easy to make.  My 11 year old daughter made them while I supervised.  We rolled them too thin, so next time we will make sure they are thicker...practice makes perfect.

Made these for dinner to go with soup and they were great! I have a hard time with biscuits and these worked. I would say to add your milk slowly because I didn't need as much as was stated. Thanks for the recipe.

Being English I'd never made or eaten biscuits before. These were excellent, light and melted in your mouth when warm. They rose beautifully as well. I'll definitely make them aagain. Thankyou so much.

These were awsome.  Better than Nana's!! Sorry, Nana!  No, seriously they were tender, flaky, a nice pillowy dough, made great egg & cheese sandwhiches.  Went right into my recipe book for my standby all-time recipe.  Easy to make.  I sifted the dry ingredients and used margarine.  Brushed the tops with melted margarine and baked in a cast iron skillet.  Delish!

Update:  These are actually better with half shortening, half butter.

The first time I made these biscuits they came out horrible. I couldn't figure out why after reading all of the great reviews. Then this weekend I gave it another go and realized what had happened. My son bakes with me and he put in 2 T. of baking powder instead of 2 tsp. I know this because he almost did it again! This time they came out perfect and fluffly and tasted great.

This recipe is definitely being added to my list of favorites.  Instead of butter, I substited Olivo and used Splenda instead of sugar and got a biscuit to die for.  This is the easiest biscuit recipe I have ever used and the only one I will use in the future.

Absolute best biscuit recipe ever!  I will never buy refrigerated biscuits again.  I had to add about 2 tablespoons of extra milk to make the dough stay together, but these biscuits are perfect!  Flaky, buttery and perfect with gravy or jam.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

These turned out lovely.  I used margarine instead of butter, and they were still great.

These are the best! I have tried and tried to find a good breakfast biscuit recipe and this is THE ONE! They are so moist and fluffy. You can slice them open to add butter and jelly or sausage and they don't fall to pieces. I used self-rising flour, left out the salt and baking powder and they were perfect. I will be making these for a long time to come. Thanks for sharing.

I was inspired to make these after seeing Tunisianswife's photo.  They were scrumptious.  It was my first attempt at homemade biscuits, and they were very well-received.  Very tender!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I've made the ones with bisquick and they always turned out short, dry and kind of hard, so I gave up on making those.  These, on the other hand, rose nicely, and were light, and soft on the inside like they're supposed to be.  I did substitute buttermilk, though, because I didn't have milk.  Also, I patted mine to about 3/4 of an inch before cutting them with a 3" glass.  I was able to get 10 biscuits out of it by gathering up the extra dough twice after cutting them out.  Great recipe!
Update:  Yesterday I served these with sliced strawberries in syrup and fresh whipped cream, and it was sooooo good!

Soft, fluffy and yummy! These were so good and easy to whip up. I did not change a thing with the recipe. Although in the cutting process I started running out of space on my baking sheet so I made a few bigger than the rest...I enjoyed the bigger ones best and will make all of them bigger next time. I admit I was expecting them to "spread" and puff up more than these did but even though they didn't the taste did not disappoint! I also brushed the top with melted butter. Had them with stewed chicken and gravy, yummo! Would be really good with cheese too.

I left out the cream of tartar, added an extra 1/2 cup of milk, and made drop biscuits. They came out great! The recipe made 12 small biscuits... I will probably double it next time.

Well, well, well.  After many failures I've finally found the biscuit recipe I'm going to claim as my own!  These tender, flaky bites work up quickly; do not overwork the dough!  And absolutely add the cream of tartar; it's what makes the biscuit so tender.  While these are not the sky high, shortening  biscuits that my grandmother (unsuccessfully) tried to teach me to make, the search stops here.  Thank you for this great submission!

Absolutely delicious! This was the easiest biscuit recipie I have ever used.  If you don't want to use the butter,you can use butter flavored or plain shortening instead.

These were great, fluffy, moist and full of a delicious buttery flavor.  These biscuits can go well with any entree. Although these biscuits are perfect, I can imagine them with cheese and garlice or maybe some italian herbs and parmasean.  I think I prefer them plain with jam!

Ok, mine failed..........big time. I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was bland with a side of yuk. They weren't flaky at all and fell apart. I may try again but am not hopeful.

Best biscuits ever! Really. Although I think I might have doubled the butter, the dough wasn't looking like oatmeal, and I just kept adding more and more butter and lost track. But that just made them really, really good.

They were really easy to make, turned out great.  The best part is that they take no time at all to make.  I added a tiny bit more milk just to make the dough stick together.

These were so easy to make.  I decided on this recipe because I already had the ingredients.  I'm glad that I did because these biscuits are so light and fluffy.  Everyone gobbled them up (hubby had three).

I have been using this recipe for a couple years now. It's so easy and so good! I get lots of compliments on these biscuits. At first I was making them by cutting the butter in by hand but now I use a food processor to get the job done quickly. They're good with gravy or just butter. You won't be disappointed.

Used gluten free flour, turned out a little dry only because of the flour.  I may make them again but adding something to the mix so they are not dry.  On the most part they were good.

I made these on impulse and was happily surprised at how easy they truly were to make!   I did grate the butter and that made it a breeze to mix it together.  Will definitely made these again and often!  Now need to work on making  them more uniform!

The biscuits turned out just perfectly. I used buttermilk instead of whole milk. I also turned the oven to broil the last minute to brown the tops.

Ok first off, the reviewers for this recipe really dropped the ball when they didn’t warn you to double/triple/quadruple this recipe.  I was searching for a better biscuit recipe than the one I’ve been using for 30 years...  I came across this one and thought I’d try it.  Holy.  Mother. Of. God...... best biscuits ever..HANDS DOWN.  The texture is so light and flaky and the bottoms have the slightly crispy texture that set a biscuit above the rest.  I initially made a batch and I like a biscuit the size of a deck of cards or bigger and the recipe only yielded 5 biscuits so I had whip up more dough... so glad I made these.  I will never use another biscuit recipe again.  These biscuits would be great with a bit more sugar and adding cinnamon and raisins to it... excellent recipe!

This was my first time making homemade biscuits, and I read through the comments (on this and other biscuit recipes) for tips before attempting it.  Based on what I read (and what I had) I used 1 cup of buttermilk rather than 3/4 cup of regular milk, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I froze my butter and used a grater to grate it into a cold metal bowl with the dry ingredients that I had put into the fridge the night before, made a well, added the buttermilk, and mixed it all with a metal spoon.  I only kneaded it just enough to make it stick together (maybe 10-12 times) and used a medium-size biscuit cutter.  I put them into a cast-iron skillet to bake, but made the mistake of melting butter in the pan before I put the biscuits in it, and by the time I got all of them in there, the first few I had put in were starting to melt and spread out.  :(  However, they baked nicely according to the recipe directions and were really delicious.  The 4 star rating is only because although I liked the biscuits, I would have liked them better without the sugar.  That's really  just a preference though.  For my first attempt at biscuits I think I made a good choice with this recipe.

This is now my go to recipe for biscuits. Beautiful buttery taste, not sweet, tender and so easy. I used the food processor, doubled the recipe except for the salt, froze the butter in pieces, patted out on parchment paper without extra flour, yield 23 biscuits. DH said he would like them as drop biscuits so I may try that next time.

These biscuits came out delicious, love this recipe! I was able to make enough biscuits for pigs 'n a blanket for the kids as well as extras to go with sausage gravy the next morning. I rolled them out too thin but, they were still excellent.

Make it as is! For real, they will not fail! If you don't like the sugar do not add it. However, it is a NICE touch as you only feel it faintly. Now the fluffiness is OUT OF THIS WORLD! They are also light and buttery. Definitely pairs good with jam. It yielded about 12 little biscuits. Follow another user's suggestion of folding the dough in half so  you get a crease right in the middle to slice it open. My other suggestion would be to handle the dough the least as possible. This will help with the fluffiness and prevent the butter from warming up too much before you put it in the oven. I can totally see myself eating the whole batch right out of the oven!

Good recipe.  We have another recipe that is my husband's family recipe without the cream of tartar.  The difference is we use 1/2 cup of margarine plus 2 tablespoons, and 1/4 cup of sugar instead of this recipe.  Our recipe seems to be fluffier.  Overall, still tastes good.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.   I also read other cooks ideas about baking.   I did not want to over-mix my dough, I rolled it lightly into a 8 - 9 " circle, cut this into 8 pie shaped portions and baked it exactly as stated.    Wonderful, flaky yum!
Will make again, next time trying the Buttermilk for fun.

Omitted cream of tartar, used skim milk with 1 tsp vinegar ( buttermilk ),  margerine instead of the butter, and skipped the rolling. Used a 1/3 cup measure and dropped onto baking sheet. Took 20 mins to bake, made 8  good sized biscuits for 180 calories each. Will keep this for my winter soups & stews sidekick :)

Very nice. Crusty on the outside,  moist on the inside. 3 stars because they didn't rise as shown and I didn't play with the dough, used new baking powder, new cream of tarter, and grated cold butter from the fridge. I also used metal cutters and didn't twist.  Don't know what happened? ?? I have been baking for over 40 years. But the taste was there.

My 13 year old daughter made these. We laughed and she said she will be the first person to fail at making these. The dough looked horrible but she stuck it out and got them on a baking sheet. They were very flat when they came out but they still tasted delicious and everyone loved them! Definitely NO FAIL!

These are great. I made a batch to go with fried chicken and corn. I cooked them in a steaming basket and that made extra crisp on the bottom.

My husband kept asking me to figure out how to make a good biscuit and I just wasn't having any luck. All of the recipes I tried turned out dry. Until I found this recipe! It couldn't be any easier to make and it really is "never fail". Trust me, if it can be messed up , I would find a way. But despite my best efforts, even I can't mess this one up. And the best part is that it uses ingredients that are always on hand so you can quickly and easily whip up a batch any time. this is a new favorite in our house!

Light and delicious biscuits. Can't stop eating them. Made these once with grated cheese. Also, tried them with brown sugar, raisins & cinnamon layered on the rolled out dough then rolled up & sliced like a cinnamon bun before baking. Yummy.

SSUUUUUCCEEEEEESSSSS! I'm really sorry for "yelling" but I have tried SO many recipes for that perfect biscuit but out of all of them, one I did just winging it was the best--but I didn't write down the ingredients! THIS one however was PERFECT. PERFECT. I followed everything exactly except made it for two instead of four servings. Amazing, delicious, crisp exterior, tender interior, and I made a honey butter spread to go with it, which is just honey and butter (make sure there's more butter than honey). It's great. Will be using this recipe over and over!

This recipe wass jist what Ive been looking for. I havent bought premade biscuits since making these. I have over time made some modifications for my own tastes. Use 1/2 white whole wheat, half butter and half cream cheese, and I put in only half the sugar, plus I added about 1/8-1/4 tsp of baking soda oh and I use buttermilk instead of regular.

These are great!  I substitute buttermilk for the milk.  I put the cut up butter in the food processor with the dry ingredients and then add the milk.  Everyone loves them!

These are awesome! I followed one reviewers suggestion and rolled them out twice as thin then doubled up the layers. Flaky, golden and delicious! Perfect for sandwiches.

This is my go-to recipe for biscuits. They always come out amazing! I don't bother to roll them. I just press them out with my fingers to about 3/4" thick, then slice them into squares with a knife. Much quicker, easier, but with same great taste!

I tried this recipe[e and found it dry. There were plenty of leftovers. I am just not a biscuit maker. Not the recipe maker's fault.

The next day I put them into a warm pan on top of olive oil and warmed them with a lid to keep them from drying out. I TUCKED BUTTER BETWEEN THE BISCUIT HALVES.When warm I added maple syrup and left the lid off til warmed through and still moist.

YUMMMMM!

These are the best biscuits I've ever had, and I've had a lot of biscuits!  I always double the recipe because 1 recipe would just be a teaser for my family of 6. I also often replace 25 percent of the flour with whole wheat (which would ruin other biscuits by making them heavy)  and they are still amazing!  The butter really makes these!

Great recipe! I've been making these biscuits the night before for breakfast sausage biscuits. I just put a Jimmy Dean sausage patty in the biscuit, put it in the fridge, and warm it in the microwave in the morning. Yummy! Kids love it!

This recipe was easy to make, followed the directions to a tee. However, I was not impressed with the quality. For me, they were very dense. The taste was good, but the texture left something to be desired. I would like to figure out how to make this biscuit lighter then it would be grand!

They had a pretty good taste but I felt like the butter content was a little high. If I made this again, I would put a little less butter.

These were fine, but not great. I also found that the recipe doesn't yield twelve unless you like your biscuits pretty flat, which in turn makes them annoying to split. They were very flaky, though.

Never fail biscuits never fail; even in a toaster oven these turned out amazing!  Topped with a bit of melted butter baked to golden perfection and severed with a hearty sausage gravy makes for one delightfully fast breakfast for dinner!

The never fail...failed.  They had a weird consistency and didn't taste the greatest.  I do not make biscuits often but have NEVER had any turn out like these,

These were easy and actually came out great! I have a bad history with biscuits and so far I have made these twice with no complaints!! (I added a bit more salt for taste the second time). Awesome!

I made this recipe with my 8 year old daughter leading the way.  They were SUPER easy to make and turned out great even with our less than perfect prep.  Everyone in our home that tried them liked them so I'm sure we will make them again. Happy Baking Everyone!

I've made this recipe at least 6 times now... a couple as directed, a couple with half the butter (better but still a little much for me), and a couple with a quarter of the butter. All times they've been great, but I just prefer the lighter butter.

Very quick and easy. I did not have any milk so I used 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/4 cup cold water. They came out very light but just a little sweet. Maybe next time I will not put the 2 tsp. of sugar. Maybe it was the combination of sugar and evaporated milk. Either way they are and were great

This was the best biscuit recipe I have ever tried -- the name was very appropriate.  I had no milk but some leftover heavy cream so I used that in place of milk and they were still light and flaky.  Made these to serve with my crock pot chicken pot pie but now I almost hate to use them for the dish -- rather just eat them with a little butter.

I selected this recipe only because it looked simple and I had all ingredients on hand. I just wanted something quick to make in the morning to use for a breakfast sandwich. They were easy and turned out great but the flavor was just a little too bland. I think they would be great for biscuits and gravy but as a stand alone biscuit I prefer more flakey and light consistency.  Not bad....but not great.

Very good biscuits. Flaky and buttery. Always a hit. It looks like a lot of work, but it really isn't. Especially once you've made them a couple of times and you know what you're doing it's quite fast. They may not be the prettiest, but they sure are among the tastiest. I like them for breakfast with a nice sausage gravy.

Followed exactly, except used buttermilk instead of regular milk and cut salt by half. Buttery, tender, melt in your mouth good!

This is now my go-to biscuit recipe. I find it necessary to add a little more milk to hold the dough together. Sometimes I add 1 c. of shredded Cheddar + a pinch of dried parsley. Delicious!

I used 2 T. heavy cream in the milk, with the balance of the milk being whole milk. The biscuits were excellent. Try brushing tops with butter before baking.

We love these.  Nice and tender.  Don't overwork the dough.  Once the milk is added to the flour/butter mixture, turn out onto floured surface and knead no more than twice.  Lightly pat the dough to the desired thickness and bake!

Maybe I should have been doing this for years, but I stirred up my flour before scooping it tonight so it wasn't all packed down.  Also, I used 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/4 cup half & half (I was just trying to use it up so I didn't waste it).  I'm not sure if those two things made a difference or not since this was the first time I made this recipe, but the biscuits were truly the best homemade biscuits I've ever made.

Wow, these are great. I made them exactly as written, but my dough was a little dry so I added about two tablespoons of mayo instead of more milk. These are flaky on the outside and moist and tender on the inside with a fabulous rich flavor.

Awesome. Came out great on first try. I used a food processor and cast iron skillet.  A few extra minutes were needed for bake time since cast iron takes some time to heat up.

Great recipe!  Biscuits come out fluffy golden brown.  The main drawback is once you have these,  all the restraunt biscuits never measure up so you are warned!

Finally, a biscuit recipe that WORKS! I spent the last 3 days making several rounds of biscuits, all from different recipes (Cooks Country, the Homesick Texan, etc)...none of them worked. My biscuits didn't rise...they came out like buttered hockey pucks. I didn't want to use vegetable shortening and this recipe looked perfect, especially with all the rave reviews.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and I just whipped up the most perfect biscuits. Thank you, thank you!

Oh, one tip...use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven is hot enough...mine runs 50-75 degrees too cool so my biscuits would have been too doughy/uncooked if I hadn't had an accurate reading.

This is truly a never fail recipe !! Every single batch of biscuits I've ever baked turn out to be horrible. This is the first time my biscuits actually tasted like biscuits and not a pile of floured rocks !!

These are a must for anyone who has tried and failed (like me) to make homemade biscuits. They are perfect every time. For a "healthier" biscuit that my white bread husband actually prefers, try using 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. They have a wonderful nutty flavor but are still soft and flaky. I live on the southeastern coast (warm and humid) and find 1/2 milk is more than enough or I have to keep adding flour. I also cut the butter down to about 1/3 cup. Make these this weekend - you won't be sorry!

As a Chef I am very particular as to which recipes make it into my collection and this one has made the cut. These biscuits don't call for a large number of ingredients and are easily thrown together with the things I always have on hand. They come out lightly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, perfect for all biscuit lovers!

This is the first time I've ever made biscuits. I was very apprehensive because I'd read a lot of how tricky they can be, but I made these twice, and both times they were delicious! The outside was crispy and flaky, and the inside soft and doughy. I don't have a pastry cutter, so I just grated my butter, stuck the grated butter in the freezer, and then tossed it with the dry ingredients by hand until  the batter resembled coarse crumbs. (Note: I've made these biscuits twice. The first time I grated a stick of butter that was in the fridge and the process was rather easy, and not too messy since I held the stick by the wrapper. The second time I used a stick of already frozen butter, and I found that the grating process was more difficult, but the biscuits came out the same both ways). Also, I don't have a biscuit cutter, so I just used a glass, and I had no problems with my biscuits rising. I absolutely love this recipe, and will be using this from now on for any biscuits I made in the future.

Super easy and they were just as biscuits should be. My husband said they're better than Pilsbury...yes this was my first biscuit attempt since Home Ec in High School. But they came out great and I'm not making Pilsbury anymore!!

dont know what i did wrong but it just didnt come out right.  i thought i did everything to the letter but one thing.  instead of real sugar i used splenda.  do you think this would have made the difference? by the way this was the first time i have made biscuits and the dough was a little dry and crumbly. but it did taste good and the inside wasnt hard or dry it just didnt rise very much or brown. and i did grate a frozen stick of unsalted butter in it and added 1 tsp salt instead of half.

My boyfriend flipped when I made these!! His fave recipe is my cheesy garlic biscuits, which I've always used Bisquick to make. I tried this recipe since Bisquick isn't very budget-friendly, and adapted to make my biscuits (add a half a cup of sharp cheddar to the biscuit mix essentially) and I had to use 2 tsp vinegar in place of Cream of Tarter, because I didn't have any of the latter. They were AMAZING. So light and fluffy. This recipe is definitely sticking around at our house.

I raced home from work last night though a batch into the oven and my father-in-law could not get enough.  He was very upset when they were all gone.  Thanks for a great recipe Dakota Kelly.  I look forward to adding herbs and cheese as a variation.  Awesome.

Almost the same as our old family recipe.  Ours calls for shortening instead of the butter.  Also ours uses 3 tablespoons of sugar (we always make them heaping).  The sweeter biscuits are great with honey or desserts.  I do use level tablespoons when I am making them for gravy or a savory recipe.  Also, ours uses slightly less milk and 400 for 18-20 minutes.  I think I will try the higher temp for shorter time next time we are in a hurry.

I really enjoy baking. However, i've never been able to bake homemade biscuits. Finally, a recipe that speaks for it's name. These were delicious. Moist on the inside and light and crisp on the outside. My kiddos devoured them and I didn't have to hear them say they were "HARD AS HOCKEY PUCKS". Thanks, Dakota!

They do fail if you add baking soda instead of baking powder. I wouldn't recommend it. :) 
I made them again with baking powder and they were delicious!  My whole family really enjoyed them!

This is a great easy biscuit recipe. Made these for biscuits and gravy and they worked great. I did follow another review and rolled them out and folded them in half and gave them another light roll before cutting them. This made them peel in half easily after baking. Thanks for this great no fail recipe.

Perfect! I wanted to make my husband a special breakfast for a major catch at work and knew that one of his favorites is biscuits and gravy. I'd never made biscuits from scratch before and thought I'd give this recipe a try. I followed directions to a T except I followed Barbara's tip by rolling it thinner (I made it 3/8 inch thick) folded it over then cut it. Pulled apart in a perfect center and they were light, fluffy, and great. My husband ate his with sausage gravy and I had mine with butter. We were both torn as to which was the best way to eat them.

The only thing I will be doing different with this recipe is using a little less baking powder.  Other than that these are awesome and easy to make.

I would say the prep time is closer to 20 min, especially if you don't know what you're doing... But other than that, they turned out fantastic!

DEEEEELISH!!!!  I made them exactly according to directions.  I added a little Land O Lakes "Parmesan & Herb" blend to the flour (that I sprinkled on the board prior to shaping/cutting), and baked them on a brick stone.  EXCELLENT with very little effort.  My kind of recipe!

Very good! Just be careful when you have people read it to you though. My 10 y/o said 1 1/2 tsp salt... so yeah, lol. Now she knows how to read measurements though!

OUTSTANDING!  I used 1-1/2 times the amount of each ingredient for the 4 serving recipe (except for the salt) and was rewarded with 15 tall, beautiful, tasty biscuits that were yummy plain, with butter, and slathered with the Sausage Gravy III recipe.

I made these biscuits a few weeks ago and they were super easy and really good and simple. I actually made these as a topping for chicken pot pie IX from this site and it was really good. (See my review on it for more details) Thanks dakota!

OMG, I have never been able to make biscuits. I cut the butter and flour together in the food processor and it came out perfect.  Kneeded them lightly 3 or 4 turns and patted them out using 3/4 inch sticks as a guide and cut them with a water glass.  I got six good sized biscuits and baked them in a cast iron frying pan and it took about 17 minutes untill they were done and they doubled in heigth.  Served them with sausage gravy and my husband and his brother ate them all and said they were the best ever.  I will have to make them again so I can taste them.  I am sure I will be making these a lot from now on.  Never will buy expensive biscuits in a can again.

These were very good biscuits! A tip for easy combination of the butter and flour mixture if you don't have a food processor is to grate the butter with a cheese grater, and pop it into the freezer for 5 minutes while you are mixing the dry ingredients. Then quickly mix in butter till course, then add cold milk and mix until combined.  You still want to have small 'pockets' of the shredded butter... this is what makes them flaky. I prepared the dough in my stand mixer, as I do not have a food processor.  I made made the dough and  baked in a 8x8 cake pan and topped with whipped cream and strawberries for a shortcake.  Delicious!

OH MY GOSH!  

Very, very easy to make and very, very quick to go!  My family absolutely loved them and can't wait to have them again.  There was one biscuit left over and my son loved them so much, he heated it up when he got home from school and ate it just like that.  I don't think I will buy another can of store-bought biscuits ever again...not with how tasty and easy these biscuits were.  This is a must in every recipe box!!  

Five stars are simply not enough

I have NEVER made a bisuit that even came close to turning out. Seriously,  in college my roommate kept an out of a can job that I botched as a sort of pet rock. No more. Flakey, buttery and slightly sweet - these are awesome. Mine weren't pretty but they looked, and more importantly tasted, like a recognizable biscuit. I'll take it!

So good and so easy! I made these without cream of tartar because its not available where I'm living and they were still nice and fluffy. Sometimes I add grated cheese to the dough & brush with garlic butter for the 'red lobster biscuit' taste.

Great biscuit recipe! I had to substitute a baking soda/cream of tartar because we just ran out of baking powder and they were still great. Will make them again with baking powder next time. Might also try with half butter, half lard/shortening as well sometime to experiment like some reviewers said. Still, great basic biscuits!

I found the blending process to be a bit more labor intensive using butter instead of crisco. I even had to throw in about a tablespoon of crisco just to get enough texture in it. However, my husband and our guests all thought they were great in flavor and texture.

Great recipe! I am 7 months pregnant and was craving biscuits with gravy and I did not want to do anything time consuming or complicated, so this was perfect! I smothered it with "Bill's Saugage Gravy" and I could not have been happier. Thanks for a quick and truly no fail recipe!

Thanks so much! My family loved these! I substituted the butter for Smart Balance and they still turned out great.
Can't wait to make them again. I made honey butter with 3/4c Smart Balance Spread and 1/4c honey to go with them. 
I'm an official biscuit baker! Thanks so much!

As soon as my husband took a bite, he announced "these biscuits are great", and they are! I am happy to add my 5 star rating to the pack. My only disappointment was that they didn't rise as high as I thought they would, but they were still light and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Best luck I've had with any biscuit recipe. I like the addition of sugar--I think it tones down the baking powder flavor. Great recipe!

I never thought I could work with dough that wasn't "just add water"  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I fought the urge to over work the dough and they fluffed up to my satisfaction.  I used the good old Kitchen aid for mixing and a drinking glass to cut out the biscuits.  Boyfriend approved!

These were pretty good, although not anything like KFC in my opinion. KFC's are softer and cakier. Mine didn't rise at all, but I ended up letting them sit for about 1/2 hour before baking. Maybe that's why. My family loved them, though.

I used half whole wheat flour like somebody suggested and they were pretty good.  We used them for breakfast sandwiches.  I would make them again. :)

I am an accomplished bicuit maker thanks to this recipe.  I cubed the cold butter and used my food processor to add it to the dry ingredients.  I used the processor to add soy milk until it held together.  Then, I folded and kneaded it a bit on my kitchen counter, rolled it out and scored the top before baking.  These are the closest to KFC that I've tried and are a blessing to those of us allergic to yeast.

I made these biscuits this afternoon to use in my Thanksgiving dressing and they are fantastic. I did forget the cream of tartar and I doubled the recipe. The biscuits sat on the counter for about 20 minutes while my cornbread was baking.  They took longer than 10 minutes to bake but were pretty big.  My 3 year old daughter ate on after her nap and loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

I don't know what happened to my biscuits, but they didn't rise and they were in great need of salt and flavor. The texture was great and they tasted good except for not enough salt, so we ate them anyway, but they were the same size as the raw dough. Wish you could tell me what went wrong?

This was good and easy to make.  I have never made biscuits before and they turned out well.  I wouldn't say they taste like KFC though.  I made them with the ARMY SOS CREAMED BEEF on this site and it wsa absolutely delicious.

Very easy to make but definitely too bland though I added some vanilla extract (probably not enough). Sorry to be the black sheep, but won't make them again.

Excellent recipe - Thanks Madison!  I used 1 teaspoon of salt, doubling her suggestion.  I also added a pinch or two extra sugar, per other reviewers suggestions.  The biscuits were light, fluffy, and elicited compliments from my family.

I just want to say Thank You Madison! I've been trying to make fluffy biscuits for a long time and until now had been unable to do so. I doubled the recipe  and rolled it out thicker to make higher biscuits. I baked a few and froze the rest. It made about 16 and they turned out delicious!

My first attempt at biscuits, and I had the guts to use 1 cup whole wheat, and 1 cup white flour.  Added a little extra sugar, 1/4 cup flax seed, and it still turned out very, very well.  Smelled and tasted great!  Very easy to make, except I had to use a lot of elbow grease to cut in the butter.  Thank you, Madison.

This were very good, easy to make biscuits.  Great to throw together in a pinch.  They turned out a little small for liking so next time I will make them bigger.  Other than that it's a great recipe.

These were excellent!  Like another reviewer, I have always been a failure with biscuits that turn out like rocks.  Not this time!  My hubbie ate 2, which was a very good sign!  The dough was too wet, though, and I had to add a bit more flour, but otherwise they were perfect.  Thanks Madison!

Gave these 5 stars for the "ease" of the recipe.  I used buttermilk and just dropped the batter on a silpat.  Turned out fantastic.  Very tender biscuit and tasted great.

These were really easy to make looked very nice. I made these for dinner tonight to go with SOS and they came out perfect. I think I like these even more than my mom's recipe. The only thing I *didn't* like about these was the fact that I couldn't stop eating them:)

Awesome, soft, flaky biscuits! Best eaten warm from with oven slathered with butter and a good jam.
