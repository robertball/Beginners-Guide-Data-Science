This is a good base for bruchetta recipe but there are a few things that are missing or can help make it better.  
First off, a little sugar really brings out the flavor of the tomatoes.  Seondly I add a swirl of balsamic vinegar.  I also sometimes add capers in for a nice touch.  I also use a shallot instead of onion but either is fine.  
I do think it's important to toast the bread before putting the tomato mixture on there, otherwise it's too soggy.  Just drizzle some olive oil on there and salt an pepper and then toast for just a few minutes.  Gives it a nice crunch.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years when I have people over...and EVERYONE always wants more. I have always made the same alterations as most people here- add some minced garlic! The other change I make is to toast the bread alone after i have brushed it with the olive oil. Once it is toasted (heres a trick I learned from a gourmet chef)- you cut 1 or 2 garlic cloves in half width-wise and rub it on the tops of the toasted bread before spooning the tomato mixture onto it. For a kid-friendly recipe, I sprinkle a bit of grated cheddar on top and throw them back under the broiler for 30-60 seconds... Try this recipe! Its wonderful!

Everything about this recipe is great, except I feel it is missing one major ingredient: GARLIC!  I added garlic to mine and it was wonderful.

Garlic is a must for this recipe. I used a crusty french bread rather than italian bread. If you're thinking of trying this recipe, go for it.

very good -- I used much less onion, 3x as much basil, and I added garlic. 6 small Roma tomatoes made enough for a baguette (maybe 15 slices).

Best ever and so easy.  Don't have fresh tomatoes? Use drained diced tomatoes from the can.   Hard to tell the difference. We love this!

Add the garlic and you can't go wrong.  I fixed this with Baked Zitti and my dinner guest were ready to leave tips on the table.

Wonderful and impressive.  Made this for a party the other night and everyone loved it.  I added garlic to this mixture.  I love the way the vegetables have a soft roasted look to them.  I have been sharing this recipe with others too.  I made the mixture ahead of time and cut up the bread beforehand too, storing the bread in a plastic wrap.  It was so easy to pop into the oven and within no time was done.  Great recipe.

Delicious! I added garlic to the recipe as well and used about twice the recommended amount of cheese for my cheese loving family. I had a few left over slices and they were even better the next day!

I thought this was great! It was easy to make and tasted delicious, I'm definitely making this again! Maybe I'll use shredded cheese instead of grated next time, though.

Wonderful ingredients however, after making as written, it was too bland so I read reviews & with those additions, it was 5*!  Use 6 Roma tomatoes & remove seeds & pulp. Reduce oil to 1 tablespoon and use only 1/3 cup of finely chopped red onion or shallots. Increase parsley & basil to 2 tablespoons each & keep oregano the same. Add 2 tablespoons minced garlic (can be from a jar), 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, 1/4 + 1/8 teaspoon each of Kosher salt & fresh cracked pepper. Marinade in fridge overnight. Cut French baguette into 1/2" slices, brush both sides with "garlic" olive oil & bake 4 minutes at 400. Using slotted spoon, add topping, cheese & broil 1 minute.  On one occasion, I wanted my bruschetta for a picnic so I sprinkled grated part-skim Parmesan over the bread after brushing it with oil & baked it for 8 minutes at 400. I then served the topping cold on the side. My family had 3 slices each.

i made this at our christmas dinner and they went over very well.  i changed my presentation slightly from the recipe but kept the ingredients the same.  i chose to add fresh mozzarella cheese, the sliced plum tomatoes which laid over the cheese.  i mixed the other ingreds together and drizzled over the tomatoes, and then broiled in the toaster over (reg oven was full of turkey!!). delish!!

Very good, even with un-fresh ingredients (basil, oregano, parsley, parmesan...did them to taste...about half the amounts the recipe called for as not fresh).  Also added salt, pepper, and minced garlic.

I concur with others who have suggested adding garlic to this recipe.  Still, even without garlic, this recipe is exceptional.  I have ordered bruschetta in restaurants for years and this recipe is quite comparable to what you will find in great Italian restaurants.

Besides adding garlic, I added canned diced tomotoes.  While I'm certain that fresh tomatoes would have been better, it was still delicious.  If calories aren't a major issue, don't hesitate to pile on the parmesan cheese.  For my taste, it would be hard to use too much cheese topping this appetizer.

Finally, I could not find fresh oregano, so I used 1 teaspoon of ground oregano.

This will be a staple appetizer recipe in my family for years to come.  It is superb!

I am adding this note having prepared this recipe many times: Sometimes it needs salt.  Add 1/2 teaspoon to 3/4 teaspoon salt if--after you taste the mixture--it isn't salty enough for you.  Note that the parmesan cheese will add a little salt flavor, but not always enough.

Wow, this was great, it might as well have been the main course!  I recommend using more parmesan cheese than necessary, because as it melts, it really makes the bruschetta even more flavorful.  Also, I have found that preparing the ingredients before and letting them sit makes the different herbs and vegetables involved merge.

A yummy concoction. I used some dry herbs instead of fresh and it turned out okay. I think it would have been better with fresh herbs though.

I added garlic and it was amazing! I toasted some garlic french bread I bought from the store and ate it with goat cheese. Maybe the goat cheese adds more flavor but I thought this was incredible and EASY! I will make this again and again. Highly recommend eating this with goat cheese, you will not be sorry!

This was very good!  I thought it needed a little something, but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Also, I think maybe I should have toasted the bread a little before putting the tomato mixture on, as it got a bit soggy.  I will definately try again with some changes though!

very good, very easy, very healthy (if you don't use cheese).   Unlike other reviewers, I did not think the bread needed toasting prior to baking at all. Broiling it in the oven for a few minutes is enough to get them crispy. Also tastes good with dried oregano, although I highly recommend using fresh herbs. Definitely put oil on the breads before  spreading the bruschetta on. It'll make sure the tomato mix won't fall off the breads.

Delicious. I brushed the bread with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesean cheese and toasted in the oven. I also added garlic and balsamic vinegar to the tomato mixture.

I actually brushed on olive oil and baked bread and then added tomato mixture after topped with mozarella and baked again.  These turned out and tasted GREAT!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a great "base" recipe. I made a couple changes. One thing for sure is you NEED to have balsamic vinegar. As far as amount, it really depends on what you like. Start with a drizzle, stir, taste, and add more if needed. Also, toast the baguettes. I find that by using either olive oil or a little melted butter works great under the broiler. I also used red onion instead of a sweet onion. I prefer the color of a red onion for presentation. If you need it sweetened, just add a touch of sugar.

This is a really good recipe. I added a clove of minced garlic and used 1 t dried oregano instead of fresh. I also didn't have any Italian bread, so I used sourdough. I didn't bake it with the cheese either. I just toasted the bread in the toaster and heaped on the bruschetta mixture. Overall, a great, healthy snack.

This turned out really well. I used 4 roma tomatoes, a little less onion, 1 clove of minced fresh garlic, a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper, also I subbed mozzarella for the cheese because that is what I had on hand. As others suggested, I brushed my bread w/ Olive oil on both sides and placed in oven for 3 minutes, then added the topping. Bread was not soggy and was very good. Thanks for sharing!!

Just wonderful! Only made a couple of baby changes; one, I added 2 cloves crushed garlic and the teensiest sprinkling of sugar to the veg.  Set the vegetables and herbs in the refrigerator for a bit for the flavors to meld.  And then pre-baked the olive-oiled toast for 4 minutes in 400 oven before pulling them out and adding the veg and topping with parmesan (out of a can; all I had).  Great!  Thanks so much!

I am not really much of a tomato lover, but we had tons of plum tomatos in the garden this year, so I gave this a whirl. With the additions suggested by other reviewers, I used red onion, a bit of sugar, splash of basalmic vinegar, this was amazing! We wound up making so much, we skipped lunch all together, and then made it again later in the week. I highly recommend this! Next time I will try to add a little garlic too. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was good. I had company. They were really impressed by the presentation and the topping was very tasty. I do think that I will toast the bread a little before adding the topping next time as the bread  was a little soggy under the topping. I did not use wet tomatoes. I've seen other Bruschetta recipes that call for this. I also added a lille Kosher salt to taste before cooking.

Thought this game out wonderful!  Toasted the bread a bit first, used also fresh garlic.  Drizzled a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar before I put on the cheese.  Amazing!  Can't wait to make this again!

I made this twice and changed some things the second time.  Adding olive oil to the bread before topping with mixture is what will make the bread crispy and hold up the heavy topping.  Since I'm not an onion fan I finely diced up the onion and sauteed with garlic and oil on skillet first and then mixed it all together (except tomatoes) and chilled for a few hours to let the flavors blend.  I also used mozzarella instead so it would melt nicer and looks prettier.  A huge crowd pleaser!

Wow...these are great! I didn't even get them out of the oven and everyone had their plates out. Upgrades I made were to purchase a sourdough bagette and have the bakery cut them into 1 inch slices (this way if you have extra bread you can freeze it). I then lightly spread olive oil over bread and sprinkled garlic salt next. Place them in the oven until lightly toasted and remove. Add remaining ingrediants however sprinkle fresh mozzarella cheese on top and cook until cheese melts and/or bread toasts. These were a great hit!

Its missing garlic, and I substituted the onions for shallots (much milder).  Awesome  and very easy to make.  To prevent the bread from getting soggy, toast with some olive oil brushed over the top for about 5 mins, and then add the bruschetta and cheese if needed and toast again in the oven for another 5 mins.  Perfect every time this way.

This recipe was great and I received many compliments when I served it at my wine party. I took the advice of other reviews and added fresh minced garlic (maybe a bit too much - I tend to over garlic my food because I love it!). I did make an additional alteration. When I think of Brushetta, I think of a nice, big chunk of fresh mozzarella cheese! So this is how I altered this recipe: 1) I mixed in a small dish, fresh pressed garlic cloves and olive oil and brush this on the tops of the bread slices before toasting in the oven  2) Toasted the bread before adding the tomato mixture 3) The store was out of fresh basil so I used dried basil as well as dried parsley, however I did use fresh oregano and that really added a lot to the flavor of the tomato mixture 4) I added some more fresh pressed garlic to the tomato mixture and about 1 tablespoon of vinegar, HINT: If you mix the tomato mixture together and refrigerate for about 20 minutes, the brushetta will be more flavorful! 5) When it came to putting them together, I placed a thick slice of fresh mozzarella on top of the toasted bread slices, then the tomato mixture then sprinkled with the Parmesan 6) Baked them a little bit more after putting everything together so the cheeses would melt slightly. This recipe was ABSOLUTELY delicious and I will definitely make again!! Thanks Ali!

Wow.  Took this to a party, and it was devoured.  Followed these tips of others to make it perfect: drizzle the sliced bread with olive oil and a little salt and pepper, then broil for a couple minutes before adding tomato mixture.  Then sprinkle shredded mozzarella on top, and broil until melted.  Hint: using fresh herbs REALLY make this awesome.

Random tip: To drizzle just the slightest amount of olive oil on the bread so as not to make it soggy or overly oily, I simply poured the oil into a ziploc bag, cut off the tiniest hole in the one tip of the bag, and then just let it drizzle out while going back and forth over the bread slices.  It really works well!

This was great.  I made a few changes.  I added 1 T balsamic vinegarette.  Also, I served the mixture cold, in a bowl.  I served toasted baguette rubbed with garlic on the side...so the bread didnt get soggy.

This is a very good and simple recipe - made it for a family party and everyone loved it! I however, rubbed garlic on the bread, sprinkled olive oil and then toasted..and then added the toppings after taking out of the oven so they were fresh and cold rather than soggy and hot.  Some things I added to the toppings are: balsamic vinegar, roasted garlic, crumbled goat cheese, and capers for a punch. Could also do mushrooms and roasted red peppers. Possiblities are endless...

I made this recipe almost exactly as it was but I added more fresh herbs than it called for. Next time I will decrease the amount of onions as it was a bit much. I also made a large batch and canned it! It turned out wonderful. This is definetly a keeper.

Good, easy recipe.  One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the quality of your tomatoes will have a HUGE effect on the end result.  I used some locally-grown hydroponic tomatoes that tasted great out of hand but turned out really tart after they were cooked.  I wish I had made these at the beginning of the summer with some Farmer's Market tomatoes, instead.

As said before, I think this is a good base for bruschetta, however I tweaked it a little. I'm not a fan of onions so I didn't use them. I added salt and pepper to taste and a little dried rosemary and it turned out great.

Yum!  I too, after reading reviews, toasted the bread first after brushing with olive oil.  Also added minced garlic and a splash of balsamic for a little sweet to bring out the flavor in the tomatoes. This was delish!

A friend of mine [another allrecipes fan] and I made these together.  We both thought it was a bit odd that the bread wasn't toasted first and that the recipe didn't call for garlic.  We did add a bit of garlic.  The next time I make this I will make some changes...*toast the bread in the broiler...*add more garlic/garlic salt...*and maybe some dry Italian spices...*and cut the bread into thinner slices.

Served this on Saturday evening.  It was easily the star of the meal, (and would have been even if I hadn't screwed up the entree.)  I'd suggest placing the tomato mixture onto the bread using a slotted spoon.  The bread got slightly soggy, but otherwise this recipe is a keeper.

I made this for my niece's birthday party and it was a hit.  I researched many bruschetta recipes and decided to try this one. .  . only thing I added was some red wine and balsamic vingegar and fresh minced garlic.  The key is to let this sit for at least an hour to blend the flavors. I used 10 roma tomatoes which gave me enough for 2 baquettes of bread. I toasted my bread in my toaster oven ... put in a zip lock bag to take to the party and simply spread the brucheta mixture when I got there, they were eaten as fast as I could spread them out!

This is excellent bruschetta!  I was tempted to add some salt to the recipe but am glad I did not, this did not need anything extra and we enjoyed it very much.  I used fresh herbs from my garden and will definitely make it again.

Excellent Bruschetta! I made a couple of changes per suggesteions of the other reviews.  I added a bit of balsamic viniger, a dash of kosher salt, some fresh pressed garlic and some olive oil into the actual tomato portion and chilled for an hour.  For the bread -I took fresh garlic and rubbed it all over the top of the bread pieces, spread olive oil over that and then topped with parmesean and then toasted the bread in the oven.  Then when guests arrived topped the bread with the chilled bruschetta.  It was a HUGE hit!  Everyone enjoyed very much and said it was the best bruschetta they'd ever had!  Excellent!

This was very good. Made a few minor changes. I added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, and a pinch of salt. I dipped one side of thin sliced french bread in a good olive oil, then lightly dusted them with garlic powder and  Parmesan Cheese. I put them  on a cookie sheet and baked in a 400 degree oven, turning them over after 10 minutes. Baked these until they were a light brown. I served these toasts next to the bowl of bruschetta. I did not toast the bread with bruschetta mixture on top.

Thought this turned out pretty good but I made a few adjustments. I added a a 1/4 tsp of sugar, 1/4 tsp of balsamic vinegar, one small clove of garlic and a dash of italian seasoning. I reduced the amount of onion significantly (there was way too much).I Baked the bread first also. Next time I will use only 1 Tbsp of Olive oil and I think I will also use canned tomatos.

Great recipe!  This will definitely give you restaurant quality bruschetta with a few tweaks.

Tomato quality is the most important thing.  The sweeter, the better.  If the tomato is too acidic, it overwhelms the other flavours.

Once everything is mixed together, let it sit in the fridge for as long as possible to let all the flavours come out.

As others have stated, pre-toasting the bread will stop it from getting soggy.

This was okay. I didn't have fresh oregano, so I used dried oregano. I didn't have fresh basil either, so I omitted that. The onion and garlic (which I added) was a little overpowering. I would put parmesan cheese on the slices of bread and melt it in the oven, then put the tomato mixture on it after. Most of my friends preferred the Double Tomato Bruschetta (from this site) to this.

Wow, very tasty. I seeded and drained the tomatos, used scallions rather than sweet onions, refrigerated the tomato mixture for one hour to let the flavors blend, and toasted the bread on 400 for 10 minutes after sprinkling garlic powder and drizzling EVOO on it. Took the advice from others and topped the bread with the bruschetta after cooking and added some Italian blend cheese on top and melted it in the oven for a few more minutes. Definately a keeper!

Another great recipe thank you Alison.  My verry veggie daughter loves to keep this on hand for a snack.  She loves the tomato base on crackers.  This is also a great hit when we entertain which is nearly every weekend.

Chopping up all the herbs was a bit time consuming but well worth it. It was gone before I got to go back for seconds. My husband and his friend said it was "slammin'"! The only thing I would add is some garlic powder, but that's just a personal preference. I wanted to try this out before making it for a party I'm having this weekend. I will certainly have it on the menu.

Made this for the big Texan's game we had a week ago, had people over, and most of them are meat eaters. But everyone loved this! I coupled this meal with the Asparagus and Goat Cheese Quesadillas, and it was a hit, no one even complained or missed any animal products that day!

While this was tasty I would make some changes next time.   The bread was very soggy and the flavor was a little lacking but not bad. First, I would brush the bread with olive oil and toast in the oven before putting the tomato mixture on top.  Second, add a little salt, a little more garlic.

I haven't had a chance to rate recipes, but I said if this one turned out well i would..  This was truly an amazing recipe.  The only things that I did differently was I used small herb foccacia bread loaves (the personal size) and cut them in half to open them up.  I also buttered them with some tub margarine (I can't believe it's not butter) prior to adding the mixture and snuck in a dash (very small dash) of red cooking wine to the tomato mixture.  

I have made this twice and the second time I added some shreaded cheese to the top.  I loved it either way made this for a dinner, (Our mom's were meeting for the first time) and they LOVED IT, and still rave over it.  This is a very nice appetizer and goes great with a nice caesar salad.

Thanks a bunch.

this was a good recipe to start from, did find it a little soupy.  i put it on italian bread that i pre-toasted.  before toasting, i brushed with an olive oil, toasted one side, flipped it and brushed again this time topping with freshly grated parm cheese.  YUM!  after taking out of oven, let cool and top with *drained* brushetta or it will ruin the bread.  i also use this recipe on grilled chicken breast and grated cheese and it is very very good!!

We really enjoyed this.  I recommend toasting the bread slices before adding the tomato mixture.  Tomato mixture is best when it has at least several hours for flavours to mingle.  I had only dried herbs on hand and used an Italiano mix.  It was still great.  Also, for the cheese I placed a small piece of provelone on top and let it melt on.  Delicious!

This recipe was awesome. I made it as an appetizer for my family -- and they ate every last crumb. They're very picky eaters -- so I was pleased. The only thing I changed was I drizzled balsamic vinaigrette over the top once everything was assembled. Gave it the perfect zing.

I made this on Super Bowl and I wished I had of made more. I toasted up some rye bread and rub it with garlic gloves and served it with that. This is a keeper!! As a matter of fact, I'm making a big batch for a friend to thank her for dog sitting. She was here when I made it and her kids went nuts over it. Great Recipe.

This is my "go to" recipe not only for Bruschetta, but for pizza sauce as well.  I add garlic, of course, and usually use dried herbs - but it is amazingly fresh tasting!  I like to use canned fireroasted organic tomatoes when I don't have fresh on hand.  Try this recipe - it won me over to bruchetta!

Fantastic but it's missing one thing: garlic!  I added 2 tablespoon of minced garlic to the oil.  I served this as a selection of appetizers at my pampered chef party.  I love it because you can prepare the topping before hand and finish these the last minute with ease.

I used 5 roma tomatoes (squeeze juice and seeds out to avoid soggy bread) and added garlic.  Lightly sauted the onions and garlic for a few seconds to take some of the heat out of them before adding to tomato mixture.  Very nice change from our usual garlic bread.

Very good -- I think it needs a little more parmesan -- just my taste though.
If you can find Pepperidge Farm Texas Toast (frozen slices & excellent) it is even more simplified.  The toast has the oil & garlic and toasts up beautifully.

This was spectacular!! I made it for a baby shower and it was eaten up quickly! I substituted mozzarella cheese for the Parmesan because I wanted it more gooey.

Very good! I used canned tomatoes (with garlic) and omitted the onions, which I don't like. Using a shredded parmesan/romano/asiago cheese blend and extra garlic added a nice tang.

Hi all, I'm glad you like my recipe.  I  didn't add garlic to the recipe and maybe some are wondering why... I'm terribly sensitive to garlic and I cannot eat it unfortunately.  But please feel free to add it to your batch! -ali

I add garlic powder to the mixture and always prepare the topping at least an hour before so that the flavours can blend together.  I toast the bread for a few min before adding the topping and then stick them back in to finish.

This was really good. The spices with the tomatoes mixed really well together. I would recommend cooking longer than it says. I had them in the oven for almost 10 min longer.

I made this bruschetta and followed the tips listed by other reviewers - I add minced garlic, balsamic, and basted the bread with olive oil and baked it for a few minutes before putting on the bruschetta mixture. It came out delicious! (I also substituted parsley with cilantro because that's what I had, and couldn't tell the difference)

As is, this recipe needs some work in my opinion.  To me, it makes more sense to bake the bread first and add the bruschetta later.  Also, garlic is a must and I think salt is needed as well. I'm not sure this would have been very exciting without garlic and salt. On the plus side, the fresh herbs were the right combo and tasty.

I loved this recipe but one key difference is that I only toast the baguette and I serve the tomato mixture cold.  I leave out the cheese, I don't think its necessary.  I agree that sugar is key as well as a turn of the balsamic vinegar bottle in the mixture.  My friends and I devoured it!

WOW!!! No need to go to a restaurant! This bruschetta is simply to die for! Like others suggested I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the tomato mixture.  I had all ingredients on hand and had 2 packages of Concerto baby tomatoes and cut each of those in 1/4's.  I minced 4 cloves of garlic and sauted it in 2 Tablespoons of olive oil.  I used fresh basil and as others suggested tripled the basil.  One poster suggested to cut a garlic clove lengthwise in 1/2 and rub on the bread.  I also drizzled olive oil on top of the parmesan cheese.  I upped the heat and baked for 10 minute at 400.  My husband says this is our appetizer we will be making for all the parties this coming year! Thanks for sharing - a real keeper!

I lost my original copy of this recipe and have spent the last 30 minutes looking for this!  Don't lose it--you'll never find a better recipe...Ask my boyfriend and his family.  Since I usually don't make enough bruschetta for the tomato mix, I use it later by tossing it with pasta.  It is the perfect side dish!!

it's very easy. it tastes much better with only the bread toasted/broiled w/ olive oil and then garlic. And then just spooning over the tomato mix and serve!

Delicious!  I like to make the "topping" ahead of time, and add a lot of chopped garlic to it. I brush the bread slices very slightly with olive oil and bake them for a few minutes before putting on the topping so the bread is toasted and crunchy.

I made several changes based on other reviewers notes and personal taste.  I omitted the onion and used 3 cloves of garlic, pressed. As tomatoes aren't so good in winter, I used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes.  I used lots of fresh basil and oregano, but found the oregano overpowering and would recommend more basil and minimal oregano.  I also added a few splashes of balsamic vinegar and a tsp. of white sugar.  I recommend a stronger cheese like romano or asiago - if you use romano, no need to add salt as it has a saltiness on its own.  I also brushed slices with olive oil and pre-toasted which kept the bread crunchy. One guest couldn't stop raving!!

Very delicious, disappeared quickly off the table. Would suggest broiling the bread prior to adding the topping in addition to broiling it with the topping. The bread was too chewy and would have tasted better if it was crunchier.

These turned out very well, but I had to make a few alterations in order to liven up the flavor which is why the recipe fell short of the five stars.  In order to ensure crisp toast, I followed the advice of other reviewers and lightly toasted the bread after drizzling a bit of olive oil on the slices prior to putting on the filling.  Once the toast was crisp, I rubbed a halved garlic clove onto the toast for some flavor as well as a bit of salt and pepper.  To the tomato mixture I added minced garlic as well, and finished off the dish by adding a bit of mozzerella cheese to the top of each slice which added an attractive and tasty touch.  They disappeared before I had even finished plating the main course!

No, no, NO!! You need to toast the bread, rub it with garlic, and put the tomato mixture (ADD SOME BALSAMIC VINEGAR!!!) on top UNCOOKED! Try it and see! This is a good mixture but rendered onto a gooey mess!

Fabulous! I made my own french baguettes to go with this (http://bread.allrecipes.com/AZ/FrenchBaguettes.asp) and used canned diced tomatoes like others suggested. So not only was this absolutely delicious and easy, it was also really cheap! Two people at my small party asked for the recipe - a sure sign that it made an impression.

This was really good. I think I could have used less onions. I brushed bread with olive oil and toasted as someone else mentioned. These would be great for company.

Was for sure missing something, I put in some garlic and toasted my bread with olive oil in the pan first for some extra crunch to my bread. Over all it was a good base for my own creation, Thanks for the start just what I was looking for.

I added diced artichoke hearts, and a little more oil... (my preference) Read the reviews and DO toast bread before adding topping.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!

I wish I could give this a 4 1/2. It's a great recipe but, I did make a few changes/additions. First, I did not have fresh oregano, so I used about 1/2 tsp. of dried leaf oregano. I added about a 1/2 tsp white sugar, 1/2 clove minced garlic, and a swirl of balsamic vinegar to the mix. I would also recommend squeezing some of the juice out of the tomatoes before chopping them. I baked the bread alone for 5 minutes, then topped with tomatoes and cheese and baked for another 3-5 minutes. It was delicious and looked pretty too!

Taste was really good and everyone enjoyed it with their clams.  A great summer snack.  However watch how much tomato mixture you load on each bread slice....it will got soggy if you load it too much before baking.

Very good! My sister was ranting and raving about these, and it was perfect appetizer. I drizzled a little olive oil on top of parmesan cheese and used extra, fresh basil, but other than that pretty much stuck to recipe. Great recipe.

Have now made this 4 times, and it gets better each time.  A very serious hint to make it good, is to ensure that you only use fresh herbs.

I was surprised at how bland this was!  I had to add balsamic vinegar to make it taste at all.  It probably depends on the tomatoes.  But I was embarrassed to serve these to my friends.

I thought the ingredients listed here are a great combination. Only use fresh ingredients with this or it won't look or taste like a fancy restaurant bruschetta. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because after making it perfectly, it's lacking flavor. I think if I added something sweet to this it would be perfect, because you can't add much salt or it will taste like a cracker. Perhaps small thin slices of strawberry or another fruit on top would do the trick..

This is a great recipe to base your bruschetta off of. After using this, I've been able to play around and add various things, but no matter what, it really tastes great. I love to top this off with some really good balsamic vinegar.

This was good.  Being lazy I just estimated measurements and didn't measure anything.  I used plum tomatoes since they were on sale at the store.  I also used dried seasonings since that's what I had on hand.  I used left over french baguette that I had in my freezer.  I first toasted the pieces I wanted in the toaster oven to thaw them out and get a little crunchy, then made the bruschettas and heated as specified.  Turned out to be a good lunch, and I have extra bruschetta mix in the fridge for lunch tomorrow as well.

This is the first time I've ever made bruschetta and I tried it at a dinner party. One of the guests compared it to restaurant quality! I put the chopped tomatoes in a strainer and pressed gently to reduce the liquid. Then I added garlic and capers with the other ingredients and lightly pre-toasted the bread as suggested by other reviewers. There were a couple left over and I heated them the next day at 350 for a few minutes and ate them for lunch--they were still delicious!

I'm with Hollyj on this.  Good base, but as is... Not the best and a bit soggy. Definitely add garlic.  More cheese.  Drizzle and toast bread prior to topping.

These came out great and I will definitely make again... but I agree with others and I should have added garlic.  Next time I make this I'll add garlic. Yum!

A very good bruschetta.
Like a lot of other reviewers, I felt garlic really improves the taste. And I think it needs something to add a little kick, so I've tried balsamic vinegar and a large pinch of salt, on different occasions. I think that salt foes more to balance out the natural sweetness of the dish.

I loved this; it had such a powerful flavor with all those fresh herbs!  This was the perfect way to use the herbs in my garden.  Tasted very fresh and light!  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  I have made a couple changes.  Added 2 cloves fresh garlic, feta cheese, crumbled bacon & balsamic vinegar.  For a short cut I baked Papa Murphys cheese sticks, & had guests top with the tomatoe mixture & parm. cheese.  Fantastic!!  Thanks.

I added some crushed garlic and about 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar as per the suggestion of others. Brushed the french bread with a little EVOO, and broiled until golden. Put the cold Bruschetta on top. Husband loved it even though he is not a big fan of basil. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. I've made this twice this month, first using French bread, then using the larger surfaced Italian loaf. Since I didn't have fresh herbs, I used 1 tsp dried oregano, and 1/4 tsp dried basil. I also added one small clove of garlic, minced. As some others have suggested, I put the bread slices under the broiler for a minute or so first, before topping them with the tomato mixture. I then topped each with shredded mozzarella  and sprinkled with some Parmesan. Using two large tomatoes, there's enough mixture to cover about 8 Italian loaf slices, or about 14 French loaf slices. Will make again.

Very easy and fresh tasting.  I used a combination of fresh and canned tomatoes.  I ommitted the cheese.  Would also be a great topping for pasta, fish or chicken (that's what I'm doing with the leftover tomato mixture.)

I really liked this bruschetta but next time wouldn't bake/heat the tomato mixture with the bread.  I like bruschetta cold on toasted bread...thought I'd try this out.  It was great though...just would prefer it cold.

Where's the garlic? I added minced fresh garlic and toasted the bread prior to placing the mixture on top. I used a "bake your own baquette" and sliced on the diagonal. Yummy! Anisha's review was helpful because it called for rubbing the fresh garlic clove on each slice of bread before placing the mixture on it. Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding recipe!  I made this for an appetizer and it was gone in minutes.  Everyone loved it.  Too bad I didn't make a bigger batch.  Next time I sure will.  I toasted my bread for a minute before I added my topping.  I also cheated and used canned diced tomatoes.  So much easier.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mmmmmmm - very good.  This was my first time ever making bruchetta (or having it outside of a restaurant).  It was great, very fresh tasting.  I added a little bit of garlic salt, but probably next time I'll add freshed minced garlic to boost flavor a bit.  I had no problems with the bread going soggy.  Used french bread because that was all I could get, but I don't recommend that because it didn't slice up well.

Add 2-3 cloves garlic, which Ali omitted because she's allergic (poor Ali!), and it's perfect! I  toasted a hearty french bread a bit before adding the mixture.

Made exactly and was DELICIOUS!!!! You need to leave it in the fridge a few hours to let the flavors gel together..... it's so good. AWESOME with the garlic butter from this site. Spread the garlic butter on French bread, toast in the oven then top with Bruschetta, YUM YUM YUM!!!!

Easy and Delish! I served this with some pasta at a Christmas party that I hosted and it was a huge hit. I took the suggestions of many and rubbed garlic cloves on the bread slices, brushed them with butter and then toasted lightly for a few minutes before placing the tomato mix on the bread. The tomato mix also included balsamc vinegar, salt, pepper, minced galic and capers. I also reduced the amount of onions.  I topped the tomato mix with finely shredded mozarella before I toasted the bread for a second time. Mmm Mmmm Mmmm!

This is a great recipe but I tweeked it a bit.  I added some garlic and balsamic vinegar to the mixture and instead of parmesian cheese I used grated mozzerella on french bread.  It's always a hit when I serve it.

This was great. I had to use diced can tomato's but I rinced them well first. I also substituted the fresh with dried herbs, so I cut the oregono and basil down about half. Once the bottom of the bread was brown I broiled the top some. Turned out very nice. Will make again!

This was a great recipe with the classic bruschetta taste. I will make it next time cutting the bread 1/2 inch instead of 1 inch which was hard to eat keeping the mix on top (how big is your mouth?).  Definitely a keeper with the classic taste! Yum!

As suggested by others, I, too, coated the bread with olive oil before baking.  I also used French bread, and sprinkled with garlic powder before baking.  I used two "real" tomatoes, and a can of prepared petite cut tomatoes, too.  Used red onion and added garlic and capers.  This was a big hit.

I brushed both sides of the bread slices with olive oil and toasted them first.  Then I spooned the tomato goodness on the bread and broiled it.  It came out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

By the way, dried basil worked out fine.  I am looking forward to using the fresh stuff soon.

I like to give the bread slices a toast before putting on the topping and finishing in the oven. It's more work but they come out less soggy. Also out of preference, I double the basil and leave out the oregano.

Very good recipe! As I was combining the incredients, I couldn't help but notice that with all the tomatoes, onions, and herbs, it resembled a salsa. Boy it sure didn't taste like it! For an added flavor, I brushed each piece of bread with some garlic flavored olive oil prior to putting the tomato mixture on top. I will definitely make this again.

I think it could have used a bit more cheese...but it was pretty good overall and everyone seemed to like it.

This was very good.  I didn't bake it on the bread, however, as I made it a day ahead.  I sliced the bread very thin (1/4" slices) and baked it in the oven for 10-12 minutes, then when time to serve put the toast on a plate with the salsa in the middle and it was enjoyed by all.

This is delicious, and very pretty for serving!  I left out the onion, and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic. My only complaint is that they can be difficult to eat without having tomato fall in your lap.

I first found this recipe about ten years ago and STILL love it! I made it for my daughter's summer birthday party the first time which had tea sandwiches and it was a HUUUGE hit! People still talk about it! I made it ahead (using different varieties of tomatoes) the night before and tightly sealed it and stored in the fridge. It's easy enough to make the day of, but when you are throwing a party, why not keep it simple? ;) Love you Alison!!! Thank you so much!

This recipe was great!  My husband and I both agreed that it tasted just like the bruschetta you get in restaurants.  The only thing I added was a clove of garlic.

My family and friends love this recipe. Like others I add garlic and more cheese. I use baguette bread and slice it really thin, this makes it nice and crispy. If time is hurried, I will broil these and they turn out just as crunchty as baking them. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

Make it a little early and put it in the fridge to let the bruschetta come together.  Definitely add balsamic, I love basil.  Fresh is better, but especially if you have time to let the dried herbs rehydrate in the mix, use 'em!

I made this recipe and added minced garlic to it, and my family and I love bruschetta. This is a good recipe for bruschetta, but I definitely would say that garlic should also be used.

Just had it for breakfast and it's so yummy! So quick and easy. Yes, I agree that garlic is a must as it just makes it whole lot wholesome. I omitted the onions, though maybe next time I'll add it in. Also added a dash of worchestershire sauce (because I just like it :) ) a pinch of salt and a quick dash of tabasco for a little zing. Perfecto! Thanks!

Served with potato soup, which was a great pairing. Although I made this according to the recipe, so I could rate it fairly, the next time I make it, I will add some garlic and some balsamic to improve the flavour. Thanks!

I add about a clove of minced garlic to this and cut down the onion a little bit.  This is a great recipe and very easy to adjust to your specific taste.

Yummy but I add garlic like the other readers have done.  I also toast the bread first, definitely helps keep it from getting soggy.  I cut back on the olive oil to make it a little healthier.

This was an excellent bruschetta recipe.  To ensure the bread didn't get soggy, I spread a bit of garlic butter on each piece and toasted them for 1-2 minutes before adding the brushetta.  I omitted the Parmesan since some of my guests didn't like Parm and they were a huge hit at my dinner party last night.  Thanks!

I love bruschetta and this recipe is great.
If you don't have parmesan cheese, cheddar actually works quite nicely.

Be careful with the red onion, as it can be quite overpowering and make sure to toast the bread well on both sides, as it can go soggy very quickly!

I made these for a wine/cheese party and everyone really liked them...I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers - toasted the bread prior to placing the ingredients on it, added 4 cloves of minced garlic, and a little balsamic vinegar -

I liked them, but it still seemed like something was missing - I will play with some additional ingredients and update my post; also, I had to use dried spices (and that may have been the problem).

I can only give this 3 stars because I changed it a ton (but it is a FANTASTIC jumping off point for bruschetta). I used all of the same ingredients but made it more of a dip, than a hot appetizer. I was afraid the bread would get soggy as I wasn't serving it right away, so I let my guests spoon the bruschetta over the chibatta toasts that I toasted after brushing w/olive oil for about 5 minutes. I added several cloves of garlic and a splash of balsamic vinegar as suggested in previous reviews, and I used fresh basil & Italian parsley but dried oregano as that is what I had on hand. It tasted wonderful and I will certainly make again and maybe try the cheese next time.

Delicious, but please.....if you have fresh herbs, use more! It's not only healthy, but unbelievably tasty. I used about 2 Tbsp. or more each of basil and parley - so fresh. Also as the others have stated, I used 1 large minced garlic clove (also healthy). What made this over the top easy was that I purchased prebaked toasts instead of cutting up the Italian loaf bread. The kind I used was Nonni's Garlic Parmesan Panetini Toast from Costco. You can use any prebaked toasts. My family, including a 10, 12 and 14 year old thought that it was a keeper. I have this bookmarked under "Recipes - Summer". Thank you Ali!

An easy, quick recipe that came out very good. The only change I made was I sprinkled the bread slices with a bit of garlic powder before adding the topping. I think next time I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion and add a bit of balsamic vinegar.

Very yummy!! It is so easy and looks (and tastes) so good!! I think you can use pretty much any variation of the ingredients you have. Adding the garlic and toasting the bread first is a must! My 16 yr. old son says he is making it next time :-)

This recipe was pretty good.  THe only changes I made was adding a clove or two of garlic and I toasted the bread before baking it.  It turned out great!!

This came out great! When reading the recipe i did decide to add garlic, so instead of regular italian bread i used garlic toast. It was fast, and v. tasty.

I made this using 12 grain bread slices, and added garlic powder (a must). I used another reviewers suggestion of slightly toasting the bread before adding the topping.   If you increase the amount of olive oil and added a little more parmesan and lots of garlic with sauteed shrimp, this would be delicious over angel hair pasta!!  Thanks for your recipe, we really enjoyed it!

Very good but not something the family raved about (which is what we save the 5 star rating for).  I'd recommend it and my husband and I will probably have it again - but the kids will probably skip it.

I found that by pre-toasting the bread a bit it doesn't make the mixture to moisten the bread.

I made this recipe and it really taste great! i followed the suggestions of other members like adding sugar, Sauteing first the garlic and onion in butter, balsamic vinegar,salt and pepper and one more thing, you can add classic italian pizza sauce for a little twist and the taste was way too different!! ITS REALLY GOOOOD! I made it today for Christmas Eve and Im so excited to prepare this recipe again and again. For the Filipino members, i used the classic italian pizza sauce by del monte :D

It turned out very good. Everyone at my dad's office loved it and asked for the recipe.
However, I did tweak it a little. I added a teensy bit of garlic, a little green pepper, and a little red pepper. I ran out of parmesan, so I used mozzerella. I'm never prepared. Oh well.

My husband and I are not tomato eaters, so I'm judging this recipe based on how well it went over at a party. The only change I made was to use minced onions instead of fresh. I made the mixture the night before and let the flavors blend in the refrigerator overnight. Then I spread it (used a slotted spoon, as another user suggested) on pre-sliced pieces of French baguette bread. I made a ton of these and all but a few disappeared at the party... so, I'm taking it that they were good!

I've tried many bruschetta recipes, but I always come back to this one.  It is simple and delightful.  Occasionally I add a splash of red wine vinegar, but it is perfect as is.

These are amazing and easy.  A few changes, I added salt and garlic to the mix as well as 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar which really adds a zing but not too much that it gets that strong balsamic flavour.  I also followed others idea to pre toast the bread and they were nice and crisp.

Fantastic. Toasted the bread prior per the suggestions and added a splash of balsamic vinegar as well as a clove of minced garlic. Be sure to use ripe, good quality tomatoes. Made it as part of a father´s day  meal and dad loved it.

Excellent appetizer that my guests raved about.  I took the advice of some others and first brushed the bread slices with olive oil and rubbed them with garlic, and baked them for about 4 minutes before adding the topping and finishing the baking.  They were crispy and delicious.  A definite make again recipe.

By all means, spray or brush olive oil on the bread and grill at 425 degrees for 10 minutes prior to coating with the tomato mixture and you have a real winner.  We've had this recipe many times with family and friends alway recieve compliments.

Nice change of pace from our standard Garlic bread. didn't have fresh tomatoes recently and tried it using canned dice tomatoes, which I drained for 10-15 minutes. I also used dried herbs and it was excellent as usual.

In the past, I've bought bruschetta from the deli, but yesterday we had a late lunch and I wanted to make a snack that would fill us up.  I followed the recipe with one exception - I added the minced garlic. Brushed the bread with olive oil and toasted until crispy - topped the bruschetta with a Parmesan/Romano mix and stuck it back in the broiler for about a minute.  We definitely will be making this again and probably as an appetizer the next time we have guests over.  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was ok. I thought the bread was a little dry.  I also thought the tomatoes were cold and yes it was missing something.  Everyone liked it except my son who rated it a one.

I have made this recipe numerous times now and it is really excellent.  Sometimes I add garlic but it really is delicious exactly as written.  We also put it on top of garlic bread and top with parmesan before baking.

This was pretty good and easy to make. The only thing is I thought it needed a tad more flavor so I probably will add garlic as earlier reviews suggested.

True. Turns out every time, made this three times with fresh tomatoes from the garden. JUST NOW RATING IT, SO GOOD.  Made it for parties, every one loved it, garlic rounds out of the box works well with this if you don't have time to make the bread. Yum.

These were great! We used a whole grain baguette and cut them a bit thinner than 1". We had some leftover topping and just ate it with crackers - it was great! It's definately a good idea to let them sit a few minutes out of the oven - the topping cools and makes it more refreshing.

(note - I tripled this recipe since I had a lg pkg of roma tomatoes, pls downsize my given measurements accordingly.) Read thru many reviews, & reduced the onion to 1/2 & added 6 splashes basalmic vinegar & 6 cloves garlic as well. Also added a bunch of green onions for texture. Had some cilantro & Italian parsley too. Went 1/2's w/ regular parsley & Italian, then 6Tlbs cilantro. After letting it sit overnight, it seemed bland. The bite that I was familiar w/ in bruschettas made by others & in restaurants was missing.  So, since the mixture was rather juicy (will reduce the olive oil next time), I added a cpl tbls dried onion, some good sprinkles of onion powder, & abt 1t dried minced garlic. Forgot sugar, salt & pepper...so put in 3T sugar, abt 1t sea salt, & abt 1t Lemon Pepper. Once the onion started to rehydrate, I could smell the difference. For some added zing, put about 1/4t ground red pepper in. Waited til the next day & put on little dried toasts w/ melted Italian 5-cheese mix...YUMMM! I will only go 3/4 next time on onion. I would definitely recommend that anyone unsure of their tolerance start at 1/2, but don't be afraid to add more! This is a great recipe that just needs individual tweaking per the cook's taste.

I cannot wait to make this again.
The only change was that I did add some garlic.

This was superb with my pasta dishes at Christmas 2006.  Even after it cools, it still remains soft and tasty due to the olive oil.  I did drizzle a little extra olive oil on the bread to add a little more flavor.  Thumbs up to Ali!

I followed the advice of others and added some balsamic vineager.  I also added a couple cloves of chopped garlic.  I think next time I will cook the garlic and onions briefly before mixing to decrease the bite of the flavors.  Even so, people just kept eating and eating, and saying I was breaking their new year's resolutions!

My family thought this recipe was absolutely great as written!  I did not have the fresh herbs so used dried and it still turned out wonderful!  I have been looking for a bruschetta recipe similiar to one we tasted in Italy and this is the closest one I've found. Molto bene!

It was okay. I used about half the amount of onion called for and it was still too much. I've gotten some awesome recipes from this site but this is not one of them.

Boring... Honestly? Why isn't there GARLIC in this recipe? You definitely need to toast/bake the bread first to keep it from being soggy. Even doing this first, with olive oil didn't save this. I made it because it was "Amazing". I've bought jar premixed much better than this... Sorry, Ali.

Awesome recipe ;-) but if you want something a bit different check out Carrie's bruschetta ~ adding a bit of feta cheese can change it up !

Tried it with garlic butter instead of the olive oil and omitted the onions.Substituted feta cheese... total hit. Thanks for all the tips.

This dish was extremely short of amazing. It tasted like onions and that's it. Even the guests that liked onions didn't care for it. I will never make this dish again!

REALLY yummy Bruschetta and the perfect appetizer for an Italian themed dinner. I lightly buttered the tops of each slice of Italian Bread and then put the tomatoe mixture on top plus the parmesan and then popped it in the oven...perfect!

This was really good but I thought it was a little weird to put the whole thing in the oven. Next time I would toast the bread in the oven a little and put the bruschetta on top. I would also recommend adding garlic.

I made this as one of the appetizers at a baby shower I threw and everyone seemed to like it.  It was definitely good but I think next time I'll try using some extras for more flavor as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks!

I've made this three times now for 3 different parties.  What a hit!  I make half with cheese and half without since I have a lactose intolerant friend.  I also sometimes add roasted red peppers if I have them on hand.  Wonderful recipe.

Prepared recipe as written but added fresh minced garlic and used very thinly sliced bagette (approx. 1/4") slices.  Also spread very small amount of goat cheese beneath tomato mixture before cooking...simply delicious.

I agree with some of the other reviewers. I thought it was a bit bland, which was disappointing since it looked so good! I added salt and pepper after the first taste, which helped but I think adding garlic would be very helpful to this dish.

I thought it too was very good, but i also tweaked it a little to suite our tastes. I cut down on the olive oil, used red onions instead, and added a can of cut up artichokes, a little salt and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes.  I used fresh garlic and rubbed the bread with garlic and olive oil and toasted it beforehand, thanks everyone else!  But it was delicious, even good cold!

Wonderful - enjoyed this immensely!  I did add some finely minced garlic as others suggested, and let the tomato mixture sit in the refrigerator for several hours to allow the flavors to develop.  My husband wants me to make him the topping as a salad when tomatoes are not so dear!

I enjoyed this but made so many adjustments I can't give it a 5. I used a little more olive oil, less onion and doubled the fresh herbs. But I guess it's a good recipe because it's easy to adjust to individual tastes.

This makes a great salad as well.  Add a bit of garlic powder, a pinch of sugar, fresh ground pepper, balsamic vinegar and an extra glug of olive oil and you have yourself a terrific tomato salad.   Enjoy by itself or toss with chopped lettuce.

Love this recipe! I make it multiple times in the summer with our fresh home grown tomatoes.  Hubby and I will make a meal of just this on my Italian bread.

I tried it and it was okay.  I think I would have preferred some garlic in it to give that Italian flavour, but it was a good introduction to trying it

I toasted the bread in the oven for three minutes after brushing each slice lightly with olive oil.  Then before I put the topping on I put a teaspoon or so of parmesan cheese on each slice of bread.  Then I put the topping on top of the cheese and baked for 8 minutes. The mix I made from the recipe made 8 slices from french bread I bought at the store.

I love this recipe! Everyone I have ever made it for loves it also. I always cut back on onions, so I make it with 1/2 of the onion that it calls for. I sprinkle with my 30 year balsamic and grated parmesan. Delicious!

Could not be easier. I was able to use fresh basil from the garden. I also used olive oil I keep in a jug with garlic and other herbs. The result was quite flavorful. This is so quick and easy to make. You can't go wrong

I used 1 teaspoon of each herb in DRIED form--worked out great! I also used a French baguette instead of Italian loaf. Made a great light lunch or appetizer!

Amazing flavour!  My man couldn't stop raving about it.  I followed the recipe for the most part but adding half a clove of garlic.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

I've never made Brushcetta  before, but love it.  This was a great recipe for me, and, after reading reviews, I added just a few things...number one, most definitely, garlic.   I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used the canned diced...not as good, of course, but it worked.  I used more cheese just because we're cheese folks.  I, because I made this for a light dinner, added prosciutto (sp), just a small bunched up amount on each piece (it's a bit pricey for our food budget).  I did brush the olive oil and garlic bits on and toasted  lightly prior to building the  bruschetta pieces.  I adjusted spice amounts just for our taste...we're not crazy about strong oregano taste.  This truly was a delicious and fun light meal.  I served it with angel hair spaghetti sauteed to almost brown with tons of butter and fresh minced garlic...ahhh yes.  Satisfaction

I like to use the baguettes for this.  I butter the slices and toast them, add the tomato mixture (with garlic), cover with Parmesan and toast again until the Parmesan is melted.  It is so good.  I also added some fresh basil tonight when I made it.

Awesome! It is grill season so I made a couple of changes. I added cracked black pepper, a splash of balsamic vinegar and crushed garlic to the bruschetta mix and chilled. In the meantime, I took some olive oil, added crushed garlic, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and drizzled the baguette slices on both sides and sprinkled with cracked pepper.  I grilled the slices. Watch this closely as not to burn. Also, use the veggie grill rack so they don't fall in. I topped the hot bread with the bruschetta. As it was is hot weather, I did not bake it further. The warm bread and cool bruschetta were a great combo. It had a great bite! Our guests raved about the 5 star flavor!

I love this recipe and it's always a hit.  Although it's great as written, you can tweak it to your liking.  I've added garlic, dried herbs, more onion, etc.  When  short on time I've used the toasted garlic bread slices from the bakery section and just put mixture on top minus the oven.  Try to use a better quality olive oil and I usually make the mixture a couple hours in advance and let it sit room temperature a couple hours before using.

I always make a new recipe as stated first. This was a nice bruschetta but I found the bread a little soggy too. This is clearly not designed to be an Italian bruschetta as you cannot have that sans garlic. I lived in Sicily for two years and the second time I made it, I made these changes. I toasted the bread in the oven alone. Brushed w/EVOO & sprinkled w/a little salt and pepper. I use fleur de sel and fresh cracked black but it's a negligeble difference. When the toast is golden brown on both sides, flip after 4 minutes, I pull it out and allow to cool. Then I rub each toast with fresh garlic. Just slice off some so you have a raw face. I add diced garlic to the tomato mixture, use ciopollini onions but I love red too, a kiss of balsamic vinegar, sometimes capers (not authentic) and allow the mixture to marinate several hours. Cheese is also not traditional but in cheese loving America, I will add it sometimes and pop back under the broiler for a bit. But I know bruschetta to be a delicious cold tomato "relish" on top of room temperature toast and prefer to serve it that way. But I still enjoyed this recipe very much. I love trying new things and there's always more than one way to skin a cat, as grandma used to say.

I agree with other reviewers - toast the bread before adding the tomato mixture and then toast everything a couple more minutes!  Plus, garlic makes everything better.

Was really good! I usually add garlic to my bruschetta but this recipe did not call for it so I didnt put any in. The presentation was really pretty too (mine usually looks more homestyle). Only mods I made were adding in a splash of a good quality balsamic vinegar and only one tsp of parm.

This was bitter and soupy and I had to add all kinds of things to make it taste OK ( 1/2c.sugar, garlic, and an herb mix I use for bread dipping) .  Someone said that this is a good starting point for bruschetta, I would agree if tomatoes and onions are a start.  I hardly ever rate things poorly, but this was pretty yucky.

I made this today and it was great for the amount of ingredients/time it required.  I followed the other reviews and added some garlic and little bit of sugar.  I didn't have basil or fresh parsley, so I used dried parsley and italian seasoning, and crushed red peppers.  Since I knew it was going to lack on flavor because of the basil, I added salt and pepper and more parmesan cheese.  I also used rolls (cut in halves) instead of a loaf (took me 15 minutes to be done).  I really liked it!  It was quick and great for the few ingredients I had at home.  Thanks!

This is the best bruchetta ever.  I've made it numerous times, and it's gone in a heartbeat.  The only thing I do differently is put cheese in the mixture also. Then I top with fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano (save the best for last).  Thanks Ali!

Easy, peesy, lemon squeezy. This bruschetta is a party for the tongue and it's easy on the feet (easily and quickly made = less time cooking + more time enjoying). Try some Italian vinaigrette for an extra kick. Definite Must for any occasion, formal or casual.

These were very easy to make and disappeared quickly! My friends/family all loved them, although I thought they were lacking a little seasoning..maybe next time I'll add a bit more. I'll definitely make them again!

Very good and flavorful.  I used a shallot and garlic instead of the onion and mixed it all together a few hours before I needed it to let the flavors blend.

To be honest, I was disappointed with this recipe.  It was honestly quite bland, and thus, did not taste like bruschetta at a restaurant.  I think that it needed garlic.  I don't think that I would make it again.

This recipe was excellent.  I am starting a small catering business and "practiced" this recipe on some friends.  It was a huge hit.  One friend said that it tasted exactly like the bruschetta at a famous Los Angeles restaurant.  The only change I made was to add grated mozarella cheese on top, just before placing in oven.

This was the first time I made bruschetta; it was wonderful as an appetizer before linguine in clam sauce.  I made changes per others' reviews: used pre-made pesto in place of the fresh herbs, pre-toasted the baguette slices, added a splash of balsamic vinaigrette, and let the flavors blend for several hours in the fridge.  My own amendment was to use thinner 1/2" baguette slices.  My dinner guests said it was the best part of the meal!

You cant screw this one up!  Amazing flavor.  I use red onion for extra zip.  Yumm-oh!!  Also can make up extra mix and keep in refrigerator for a couple days - to make another round of bruschetta or add to a sandwich....  If you don't have fresh oregano, basil, and parsley, just put in a plop of store bought/made basil pesto.  Works great.  I've made this recipe more than any other recipe from allrecipes.com

Oh, this is sooo good.  I don't always bake the bread, either.  When I make this in the summer with fresh tomatoes picked warm from the sun, no baking is necessary, we just put big spoonfuls on our bread slices and gobble up.  Thanks Ali, this is truly amazing stuff.

Very good.  I made it with canned diced tomatoes (with olive oil & roasted garlic) and a thick french bread & it turned out really good.  Quick & easy, too.

Absolutely Fabulous! This is the 2nd time I have made this. I added a splash or two of balsamic vinegar and a heafty sprinkling of garlic powder this time and I must say it is one of the best brushettas I've enjoyed.

I used four large tomatoes and one entire small onion, but there was still way too much onion for my liking.  Next time I will use less.  other than that, everyone else really liked the bruschetta.

This was really easy to make and tasty too.  I will reduce the amount of onion in the future, though.  I used 6 tomatoes, and 1/2 of a sweet onion, but I think my onion was larger than the one Ali uses.  It was a monster!  Otherwise, the bruschetta was a big hit at our party last night!  I made the bruschetta mix early in the day and let it sit in the fridge to marinate for awhile.  I then toasted the bread and then brushed with olive oil, as suggested here.  Thanks for the submission!

This was pretty good Bruschetta. Next time I will brush each piece of bread with olive oil as the it seemed kind of dry. The flavor of the herbs and veggies was great however. Thanks for the recipe Alison!

Excellent appetizer!  I increased the quantities of every ingredient to make enough appetizers for 40 people (I added garlic and used dry herbs instead of fresh--it still tasted phenomenal!). I toasted the bread slices beforehand like others recommended, added the toppings with cheese, and put in oven again until cheese melted for a minute or so.  Everybody loved it and I will use it as MY signature appetizer in the future. AWESOME!

This was fantastic!  I even added chicken which I pan fried in salt, pepper and Italian Seasoning.  After I pan fried it, I mixed it together with the other ingrediants in a bowl and spread it on the bread and it came out great.

Definitly toast the bread before you start!
Thanks Ali!

Great recipe- however be sure to brush the bread with olive oil first- also I added minced garlic, salt and pepper to the tomato mixture for even more flavor. Very good on focaccia bread! Thanks Ali!

What can I say that hasn't already been said about this!  It was GREAT!  I took it to a friends house for dinner and it was gone.  Even my 3 year old, that doesn't care for tomatoes like it.  I did add the garlic and toasted the bread but I also used dried Italian seasonings in place of basil and orgeano (that was what I had on hand) but I did use fresh parsley and toasted the bread first!  Can't wait to make this one again!!!!

Excellent!  As others I did make a couple minor adjustments:  I added the garlic, had only 4 small tomatoes on hand so also added one small package of sundried tomatoes after reconstituting them.  I made this a few hours ahead of time and allowed the flavors to meld until my guests arrived before baking.  I too toasted the bread sprayed with a bit of olive oil before adding the bruschetta.  Will definately make again!

This was really easy and tasty- I took the suggestions of others and lightly toasted the bread first, just to give it a little more "hold". Everyone liked it- though next time I may add garlic and use sundried tomatoes because I like their flavor a little better than fresh tomato.

Very tasty and easy recipe, I did add garlic and took others advice and toasted the breas a little before adding the topping.  Brought them to a party and they were a huge hit.

Great flavor with garlic added. Very simple and enough left over try cold on bagel chips for a light snack.

So good!  I made this as an appetizer using italian bread cut into small slices.  It did help to toast the bread first in the oven, before adding the topping and cheese.  I made the topping the night before and the flavors seemed to intensify even more.

Absolutely loved this recipe. Only thing I changed was we used cubed mozzerella cheese instead.

This turned out great! And with two people making it togeter, it took less than 5 minuets. Next time I'm going to try adding just a bit more olive oil. I recomend using fresh garlic-- it's really good. (if you are a garlic person)

I loved this as is.  I made croustades instead of bread.  Fabulous!
