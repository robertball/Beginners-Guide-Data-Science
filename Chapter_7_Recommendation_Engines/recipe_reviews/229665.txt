I love all these ingredients individually, so this was a fun recipe to make.  I did two things differently, however, out of need.  I couldn't find blackstrap molasses at one store, so I used the Grandma's Original Molasses which has more sugar in it.  Because of that, I cooked my 2.5 lb bone-in turkey breast at 425 so it wouldn't burn.  It took an hour for it to get done.  I had almost a cup of the marinade left, so I do think it would be possible to get by with less of that (don't want to waste my Jack Daniel's)--even half the amount.  I'll find some useful way to use up the marinade!   The marinade gets all nice and carmelized in the bottom of the pan from the basting process.  I would make this again, but not for Thanksgiving unless it accompanied a traditional turkey!  Thanks for the recipe, 360!

Wow doesn't cover it. This had such a fantastic flavor. I couldn't find the smaller breast at any of my local stores, so I went ahead and got an 8lb. breast. I didnt change the proportions of the marinade/glaze, but I lowered the oven to 325. I'm planning to try this on the grill with chicken this summer.

This is great! I had a 9 lb. bone in turkey breast that I cooked in an electric roaster. I would cut down the alcohol by half and thicken the marinade next time. I used the leftovers in another recipe from this sight - "Dad 's Leftover Turkey Pot Pie" and it was delicious

My family loved this. I also used Grandmas original molasses, also I used Jamison since that was what I had on hand. I cooked it at 425 for 1 hr and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious and moist.  Perfect combination of whiskey and sweet, and I don't even like drinking whiskey!  Thanks for the recipe.  I'm going to try with it with chicken next time.

I thought I'd follow another reviewer and begin with 450 degrees, then pop it down to 375 after 20 minutes, and then take it out when the thermometer said 160. The skin was like leather. I had an awful time trying to carve the turkey breast, and the meat was very dry.

I kept exactly to the recipe. Although the turkey was extremely moist, we could not taste the marinade at all except on the skin which never crisped, but was soggy. I won't make this again.

I was already planning to make roasted Cornish Game Hens for dinner when I came across this recipe so I decided to try this glaze!  It was fabulous!!!!  I cooked the hens on top of red potatoes, onions, celery and carrots. Even though the probe indicate that the hens were done, they were not fully cooked so I ended up cutting them in half and cooking them 20 minutes longer, 15 minutes covered in foil and 10 uncovered.  It was so pretty that I was almost sorry that I was eating alone!  Almost, now I have 3 days of lunch all set!

Turkey was moist, the heat from the Tobasco really faded and we were left with a slight sweet taste. Would try with chicken this Summer, or maybe even injected in a fried turkey.

Followed the recipie exactly, marinated every 10 min, flipped every 15 during the marinade time.  This had no residual flavor of the marinade.  If I ever made again I would inject the marinade instead and let it rest for 30 min.   I wont make it again though.  Too much trouble for the turkey to come out tasting like turkey... wasted a cup of bourbon!

I used a 7 pound bone in breast. Doubled the marinade, used Dutch oven pot to make marinade on stove and then added the turkey breast to the pot (saved cleanup of bowl). I cooked for 45 minutes at 450. Then deboned the breast and put on gas grill to finish as the meat was only 150 degrees and I had no more time to bake longer.  The whole family raved about the tenderness and juicy flavor. This is now the only way I will ever do turkey again.

I basted this turkey breast a lot, after marinating for 1 1/2 hours. No flavor. I always cook breast side down. This allows it to cook in its own juices. Very moist. My advice, skip this recipe.

Used this recipe for a small Thanksgiving dinner.  It wasn't quite as unique as I hoped, but otherwise it turned out great!  Would recommend this easy recipe to anyone looking for something a little different from the traditional roasted turkey breast.

My favorite turkey recipe ever!  Tastes better the second day as the ingredients soak in more, almost made me a little headie. 
Moist, perfect, I did use a must less expensive burbon, my only change.
Love, love, love!

I got a 7 LB bone-in breast.
After cooking it... It tasted like cooked turkey,
Temperature definitely too high.
Marinade didn't do a thing.Tremendously disappointed.
My rating - a 1 - would have given it a 0 if I could...
Have been cooking successfully for about 6 years now...

This turned out awesome! Not sure why it turned out dry or had way too much alcohol for some.  My wife and I are not big drinkers and my kids are way too you young to drink.  Everyone in the family loved this it is a keeper! Moist and very tasty.  The only downside was cleaning the pan the next day after letting it soak overnight.  That took some work.

Oh I did use Jack Daniels as I did not have bourbon in the house.
