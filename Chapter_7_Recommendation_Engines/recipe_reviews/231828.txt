1 T honey subbed for the sugar.  At first, I didn't care for the hot and sweet together, but I ended up liking it!  Great flavor!

When I lived in South Florida, I would stop by a Jamaican food truck about 2 times per month. This lady made the best goat curry, jerk chicken, roti. I was especially fond of her cabbage salad. I could taste the ginger and asked her if she used any. She said that was the only way she'd make it and that was why hers was the best! If I asked, she'd throw in some extra chopped habanero for me. It was absolutely fantastic! So now when I make Jamaican cabbage salad, I always add ginger and lots of habanero. Too bad, I moved and found out she'd passed away. I don't even remember her name. RIP

I will put in more black pepper next time, and I also left the diced peppers in the cabbage.  I added some butter as well.  It went great with the jamaican rice and Jerk chicken, and Cuban black beans.

I subbed a habenero pepper for the Scotch bonnet pepper, as I couldn't find one in my local grocery store. The texture was nice, but the flavor was kind of bland. We added Sriracha sauce for an extra kick.

Because half my family thinks ketchup is too spicy, I had to do this in stages. I prepared it without the Scotch bonnet and the, when the cabbage was almost done, I transferred half to a second pan. As there would not have been time to infuse the cabbage with hot pepper flavor (I used habanero because I couldn't find Scotch bonnet), I seeded the pepper, cut it in quarters, and added them to the second pan. I removed the pepper before serving. I ate the part that had cooked with the habanero, of course, and it was absolutely perfect!

I used hot sauce instead of the scotch bonnet pepper. It worked great and I had more control over the spice level. I also added some white pepper and a little butter based on the comments of others. This could be used with an oriental meal as well since it has a little bit of a sweet and sour tone. I'll probably add more onion next time.

I was looking for a recipe that was close to the pickled slaw I get at the local Mexican restaurant. This was pretty close and we enjoyed it. I used a jalapeno since I didn't have a scotch bonnet. It was great on fish tacos.

I leave out the vinegar and the sugar and opted instead for garlic and Allspice. Added a 1/4 cup of water when vegans in the house or chicken stock at the end and cover for a few minutes until just crunchy.

Very easy and delicious dish. I only added 2 Tbsp white vinegar and sweet chili sauce to your likening. Because the chili sauce is already sweet, I didn't add the sugar. I also added some black pepper.

Finally found a recipe that I like that uses both vegetables I've been trying to incorporate into my meals.  I did ad the ginger as one reviewer recommended and it was delicious.

This is delicious. Much better than other Jamaican Cabbage recipes that I tried. It tastes just like the cabbage from the Jamaican restaurant that I like.

I was skeptical looking at the ingredients...  But, I substituted 6 packets of Sweet 'N Low for the sugar (equal sweetness according to Sweet 'N Low)...  I love heat, so subbed a serrano pepper sans seeds for the bell.  And left in the thyme and habanero (same difference as Scotch Bonnet I'm told) but removed seeds and diced into small pieces.  No carrots available, but just made this spicier...  The combination of Sweet and Heat was awesome :)

I didn't add sugar or vinegar, but luckily the peppers I added were really spicy so it gave it a great kick. Salt and pepper to taste and it was perfect. I didn't add carrot either but I feel like I have a staple and this dish will make it to thanksgiving dinner.

Made this for our Carribean themed family Sunday dinner. For the first time, my oldest took a to-go plate that had nothing but vegetables on it. This is a keeper!

Made it and it came out fantastic.  Used honey instead of sugar - just a little.  Did not have the right kind of chili peppers.  Since I like things not spicy, it works out anyway.  This goes in the repeat stack.

This is a very adaptable recipie, I added a bit more heat with a tablespoonfull of East Indian chilli and a clove of garlic. Served with rice and BBQ chicken breasts it made for a very healthy and relatively low cal high protein meal which the power lifter in the familly appreciated. This will be made again.

I had to us habanero instead of scotch bonnet due to availability. I also added a little curry powder for flavor. I really liked it with jerk chicken.

This came out much better than expected!  I really wish I would have taken a picture.  Definitely better than boiled cabbage and still healthy.  This hit the spot and my oldest son (who is anti-vegetable) cleaned his plate.  I made this with a pot of Jamaican jerk chicken and it complimented the main course perfectly!  Will make this again and again.

Per another reviewer, I added some fresh ginger. It gave it a nice punch, although I think I'll add more next time! I also used a habanero pepper and cooked it whole, but it wasn't spicy enough so I chopped it up and added at the end. Much better. It would've been a bit bland otherwise. Overall, the dish was a hit! Paired nicely with coconut rice and caribbean-spiced chicken, also from this site.
