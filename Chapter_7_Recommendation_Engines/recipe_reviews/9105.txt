This is a good basic recipe. For those who are having trouble with the loaf falling apart or crumbling-remember when baking quick breads that overstirring it will cause those problems. You want to add the dry ingredients to the liquid and only stir enough to mix things together and then stop. It is better to err on the side of not enough stirring then too much. "Just till combined" means just that. I put powdered sugar on one loaf and drizzled icing on the other. Both made nice additions to my brunch luncheon. Thanks Karin.

The first time I made this it turned out great. I took it to the office and it was gone in no time. The second time, I overground the cranberries and walnuts, and the bread ended up falling apart and tasting drier. Chop the cranberries and walnuts just a bit for the best taste.

Have been making this one for two years, and gets rave reviews every time I serve it!  The grated orange peel is important, and I love the fact that it's lower in fat than a lot of quick breads.  Dried craisins are not the same as fresh ... I buy extra bags of fresh cranberries in the fall and just toss them in the freezer as is so I can make this bread year round.  A belated thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good recipe.  Not too sweet and has a pound cake kind of texture. I added a jar of chopped (and rinsed) Green Maraschino Cherries to make it even more festive looking. Beautiful!

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I love this bread.  I used my food processor to chop the cranberries and nuts.  I also used a tablespoon of grated orange peel, fresh off the orange instead of the prepared orange zest.  It turned out great.  We ate half of it before it cooled!  It is very pretty too.  I will be making in and giving it out as gifts for Christmas.  Thanks!

This is the best ever cranberry receipe I have ever tasted. I used suggestions submitted by BREADBAKER with the following modifications: 1. One cup of raw sugar for a double receipe with one tablespoon full honey. 2. I mixed whole and chopped cranberries and pecans also finely chopped with larger chunks. 3. Whole wheat flour was combined with all purpose flour in equal amounts. The bread was just sweet enough. The orange zest must be included. We loved it!

We liked it, but it wasnt exactly what I was looking for. It had too many nuts in it, and cranberries. I substitued cranberries for craisins (dehydrated sweetend cranberries) which I think added to the flavor. It was good.

Pretty good, although not quite as sweet as I would have liked.  I liked the texture and crunch from the nuts, and the orange peel adds a lot of nice flavor so don't skip that.  I made 3 mini loaves from this recipe.

A very good bread.  I omitted the orange zest, which I will add next time.  This is not very sweet.

The bread was surprisingly easy to make and tasted great.  I used fresh cranberries and think I went a little overboard so it was a bit sour but overall this is a great recipe.

Outstandingly tart!  I made a few changes as I like to bake my cranberry bread with whole cranberries and I also used about 2 cups instead of 1 cup of cranberries.  Also I don't like nuts too much so I just omitted them.  But overall this is the best cranberry bread recipe I've ever used!

Made this last night and half is already gone this morning (yum!). We added an extra egg and subbed applesauce for oil. Gosh people, the recipe is perfect, don't add as many nuts or berries if it's too much for you. If it's too crumbly, then you over-mixed. Always set timer for ten min. early so you can start checking to see when the bread is ready to come out.

This is a very nice bread that bakes up perfectly and the cooking time of 50 minutes was exact for my oven.  Definitely add citrus of some sort to add a high note to this bread.  It is not an overly sweet bread and would be perfect for a brunch or tea.  Very festive looking for the Christmas holiday season.  I doubled the recipe and it made 2 nice loaves.  thanks for this nice recipe that is not heavy with oil.  This is not a dense bread; a rather nice light loaf with a perfect crumb.

Love this bread. First I made it by the directions. Great! Next time I made it a little healthier with 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 Splenda for the sugar. I did add about 1/2 cup more cranberries and used almonds because that is what I had. The only change to the original I would make would be to add more zest.

I made this bread last night. Cooled + wrapped with plastic wrap. It was sliced around noon today + was slightly crumbly. I read in another review that you need to keep it wrapped for 24 hours prior to slicing. Not sure what I did wrong but it may have been in the mixing although I do not think I over mixed. If anyone has any helpful hints I am all ears. Otherwise it was delish!

I made this bread with a few changes.  I used 3/4cup of whole wheat flour, about 2 cups of frozen cranberries and a package of crushed walnuts and freshly squeezed orange juice.  I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer then the recipe stated. The bread is moist and has the perfect balance of tart and sweetness.  The kids can't stop raving about how great it is.

Very moist and yummy. I left out the orange zest because I didn't have any, but it still had a very pronounced orange flavor. A bit crumbly, but over all very good. Thanks!

I just made this recipe for the first time to give out as Christmas gifts.  I followed the recipe exactly (added a few more nuts), and it turned out so beautifully.  It looks pretty, and the texture is perfect.  I'm also giving out Giada's Mascarpone Honey spread to go with it, for a little sweetness.

This tastes just like the way my mother used to make cranberry nut bread.  It's very quick and easy to make.  I made it with blood orange juice instead of regular orange juice, which made it too sweet for me, but I would suggest it to those who thought the bread was too sour.

Delicious! I substituted regular flour with whole wheat flour and regular sugar with brown sugar. Was suprisingly moist and was quite good with my morning coffee. I'll definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious, easy to make, super moist!!!  I will agree though, it can be difficult to cut.  Tends to crumble more than other breads.  But, tastes great!!!

I have made this bread a few times and it is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I do use a heaping cup of hand cut cranberries....smashed in the measuring cup! And I use a heaping heaping cup of walnut pieces, too. I add all the orange solids from hand squeezed oranges. Oh man, it is the best cranberry bread I've ever had! Thankyou!!! My husband loves when I make this bread. :D

it was super easy to make and came out great. i didn't have oranges on hand to zest, so i just used orange juice with pulp and it still turned out delicious. simple, easy, tasty recipe.

This was the first time I ever worked w/ cranberries or cranberry bread. I was very very pleased w/ the outcome. I did substitute the oil for applesauce and used a touch less sugar. Also, I used 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat flour. I didn't have quite enough orange juice so I used water for the rest of the liquid. The only I might suggest is using just a touch more cranberries. I like the flavor to really POP. Other wise, IT WAS SOOO GOOD!!! I can't wait to make it again! We toasted it and then added a touch of butter and cinnamon sugar! YUUUMMMMYY!!!! HIGHLY recommend this recipe...especially w/ these changes.

I was looking for a recipe to put fresh whole cranberries in and this one did the trick!  I thought the orange flavor in the bread added to the overall flavor.  It is not as sweet as a banana bread or other breakfast breads, good with coffee.

I make a lot of breads, but will not use this recipe again. While the cranberry and walnut flavor is good, the bread is much too sweet and has an unpleasant gummy texture.

Wonderful recipe. I did chop the cranberries, it definitely helps blend the flavors better.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 eggs not 2.  I also didn't have the zest so I used frozen concentrated orange juice.  I also doubled the oil.  It came out wonderful!!  This is a great simple no stress recipe.

Delicious!  I doubled recipe, made 5 mini loaves, added chocolate chips,  reduced temp to 330F and cooked for 40 minutes.  Also added a capfull of almond extract and dusted the pans with cinnamon and sugar. substituted applesauce for the oil.

At first I didn't think I liked this bread because I found it not sweet enough and sort of crumbly. My husband also commented about how  it was on the tart side however neither one of us could stay away from it. I believe this bread was three quarters gone within the first half hour it came out of the oven. Even though it was not what I expected it to be it was quite addicting. I must make this bread again very soon.

Nothing groundbreaking flavor-wise here.  Definitely doesn't have enough sugar to offset the tart from the cranberries.  I won't use this recipe again.

I've been making this for years as my Mom's recipe is essentially the same, but doubles the cranberries (or maybe I changed it, it's only been 25 years since I started making it - Curious where it originated).  My tips would be to Cut the Cranberries in Half, don't chop or process, it makes a world of difference.  Also, as opposed to wrapping the Bread in a plastic wrap to cool, I'd suggest Wax Paper, as it will absorb the moisture so the bread is less soggy--after you've cut the first slices, if there's any left, use new wax paper, it won't be in the fridge long enough to dry out.

Fantastic!  I had poured through all my cookbooks from the pros and the home cook church, community school cookbooks, etc. searching for the Perfect cranberry nut bread recipe thinking I'd find it from some local grandma.  Each had either too many cranberries or not enough personality.  The orange juice & zest in this were perfect.  The ratio of berries to nuts was great.  You can taste the tartness of the berries but it's complimented by the bread not being overly sweet. Already printed & in my bible of recipes as a classic.

It probably would have been a 5 star if I didnt have a brain fart and accidentally double the nuts. Therefore the bread was reaaaly dense and nutty, but I love my bread like that! I popped a slice in the toaster this morning and then spread it with jam for moistness...YUM!  P.S. dont be afraid to add the orange juice. I thought it would be too orangey but it came out perfect!

I love cranberries so I used 2 cups instead of one, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Luckily I did not overstir it because it came out really moist and delicious. I think next time I would add more sugar to balance out the extra cranberries. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Just finished trying a slice of this scrumpcious bread!  I found 2 recipes on this web site but this one is by far the best!!  The taste is wonderful.  Didn't change a thing.  I had a large bag of cranberries given to me and searched here first for the best of the best.

This is a great simple recipe. The taste was fine for me, maybe a little tart with 1 cup of fresh chopped cranberries. I feel like I should have chopped the cranberries a little smaller, but I usually like the taste and texture of fresh cranberries in baked goods. The bread was slightly crumbly, but I found the batter to be quite thick and dense, even while I was mixing it. I wanted to add more liquid to it but wasn't sure what to add. I will make it again, perhaps with slightly less flour, and less mixing,  and more citrus flavor.

I LOVE this recipe, and have been making it for a number of years. TIP: once it is out of the oven, I run a bit of butter across the top then cover it with foil for about 10-20 minutes and that helps to 'steam' the loaf so it is not dry. Love the fact it's made with oil. But stir only until blended.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I was careful not to over mix  the ingredients together and it turned out great. Did not crumble at all. I did use  dried cranberries and they were perfect. Will definitely be making this again - soon!

I made this last holiday season and this Thanksgiving for a potluck.  It was a huge hit.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for not adding nuts as I have nut allergies. I put the cranberries in whole this year and it was even better than last year.  I came up a little short of the required 3/4 cup of O.J. so I added two tablespoons of marmalade, which really made a big difference in the sweetness of this bread.  I like it a little sweeter than the original recipe.  I have had  many requests from friends to make this again for them.  Best cranberry bread recipe that I have found.

Favorite cranberry bread recipe!  Made this last batch with accidentally frozen eggs, so it isn’t sticking together as well, but it is really tasty!

Easy, made 2 smaller loaves for gift giving.  Made the following changes: used 1/2 Cup Sugar instead; omitted Walnuts; substituted 1/4 unsweetened applesauce for the oil; and for Cranberries, decided to do 1/2 Cup dried cranberries (that's why I used less sugar) and 1/2 Cup coarsely chopped fresh, frozen unsweetened cranberries. Everybody loved it because it wasn't too sweet.

Very good.  I like that this was moist, not like some recipes that are dry and crumbly.

Made this recipe for Christmas and it was perfect.  I love the color it gives the bread and it's not overly sweet.  Since the recipe didn't specify I squeezed oranges for the juice, thinking that processed OJ would make it way too sweet.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I think that I left it too long in the oven becuase it was a bit dry. But even with this set back it was really good, will definitely do it again!

Really good.  I added 1 cup reg flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also added 1/2 cup honey and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup. I didn't have an orange for zest so instead added chopped candied pineapple rings (about 3 rings). It was really good.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was very moist, which I loved.  I didn't have any orange zest, but it was still very good.  I will add the orange zest next time.
