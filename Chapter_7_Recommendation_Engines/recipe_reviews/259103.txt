We loved it! Only change, I do not like to pan fry or deep fry anything. I baked this in a convection oven at 375. I used pam (oil in a can) on the pan AND on the strips. I did not soak them. Just lightly sprayed. Cooked for 10 minutes, flipped and lightly sprayed again. Cooked another 7 minutes. Awesome!

We really enjoyed this dish!  The only thing I could say about the recipe is to go a little short on the flour until you know how much you really need because I had quite a bit left.   Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Thanks so much for a wonderful meal!  My husband especially thanks you!

Baked instead of fried. Not a fan.

My granddaughters love this! They asked me what it was when i served it. They said it didn’t look like the fast food type they’re used to. I told them its better than crappy fast food. They agreed whole-heartedly once I convinced them to try the chicken strips. Not even one nugget remained!!!

Easy to follow with simple instructions. I love how light and airy panko breadcrumbs are.

I use one stick of salted butter, melted, and a roll of Ritz Crackers ground up with a rolling pen.  Dip in butter and dip into cracker crumbs.  Place on a cookie sheet in a preheated oven at 350 degrees.  Cook for 20 minutes and take pan out of oven and turn all of the chicken tenders over.  Return to oven for 20 more minutes.   These are fantastic!!

These were wonderful!   The only difference I did is cook them in an Air Fryer instead of oil.  They came out great!

Don't forget to use a thermometer for an internal temperature of at least 165F

I made this and my children loved this. The only thing i changed was the wheat flour because i did not have any, used plain flour instead. Will definitely be making this regularly. Thanks for the recipe.

The only thing I did differently was soaked my chicken tenders in buttermilk for a few hours. Followed the recipe and it came out soooo good.
