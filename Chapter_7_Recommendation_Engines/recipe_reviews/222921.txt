These are appropriately named because they really were SIMPLE to make.  No dipping in flour, then egg, and then in bread crumbs.  Just right out of the ice water into the flour-cornmeal mixture and into the skillet.  The tomatoes didn’t turn to mush, and they had a nice thin crust which stayed on well, not a heavy breading like many recipes have which often can interfere with the actual green tomato flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to lightly sprinkle some sugar on the tomatoes instead of salt.  This is always the way I’ve eaten them, and I think it works well with the tartness of the tomato.  Enjoyed your recipe, thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! I think the ice water helped keep the tomatoes firm although the recipe didn't mention that. Awesome taste! I would have taken a picture but they were eaten too quickly.

I have made these 4 times all with the same result- I get sick from eating so many. I don't know if I should put that in a review... But it means they are so good I can't quit eating them. The cold water trick is essential and works great without the extra calories or cholesterol of eggs.

Now this is the perfect FGT! All the other recipes do the 3 stage breading.  I'd rather have the flavor of the green tomatoes front & center instead of fading into the background with a thick coating of crumbs or cornmeal.  The ice water works a treat for keeping the cornmeal stuck to the tomatoes. I used Martha White cornbread mix, which is what I always use for breading seafood.  If you make FGTs often, treat yourself to a great kitchen tool... a serrated peeler. It's made for peeling peaches, tomatoes, eggplant, etc.

So easy and quick! Used regular corn meal and it came out fine. Made Chef John's remoulade recipe (hot sauce, mayo, and relish) to go with it. Awesome!

I find that Simple is best, the only thing done differently was salting (kosher ) tomatoes letting stand about 7-10 min. prior to frying in coconut oil.

This recipe is simple yet delicious. The ice cold water made the tomatoes firm and made the cornmeal/flour mixture stick like glue. I added 1 tbsp of salt and 1/8 tsp of black pepper. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe
