I thought these would be really great after reading all the rave reviews. However, I found the first batch I tried to smell really great while baking but just tasting a little bland. I agree with some previous posts that added a lot more to it. I don't know why they gave such a high rating when they had to add so much to make it taste better. To my second batch, I added a tsp. vanilla to the eggs. I also added 1/2 c. brown sugar for that maple flavor, used a whole tsp of cinnamon and added 1/3 cup of cooled melted butter. It tasted a whole lot better and was gobbled up and gone in minutes. Everyone only picked at the first recipe and they went to waste.

Excellent reviewer tips on this recipe - a bit of tweeking for a perfect end result.  The changes made: substitute 1tsp. vanilla for the water, add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to dry ingredients, increase the cinnamon to 1tsp.  used 1/2 cup of Splenda for the white sugar ingredient (because I have to watch my sugar intake; worked great with the sugar substitute),used a 16oz. pkg. of almonds for this recipe to ensure good coating.  If using more nuts, increase the coating ingredients.  Cooked my batch on a cookie sheet with parchment paper (easy cleanup) at 250 degrees for 1hr.15mins. stirring every 20 mins or so.  Good stuff!  This goes into my Gift Giving recipe file.**Adding: save the "sugar crumbs" when you're done with the cooking.  I use the crumbs in my oatmeal while it's cooking, in coffee when I feel like a little cinnamon coffee!  I'm sure you'll find other uses.  It's a shame to throw those cinnamon sugar crystals ! :)** And  in my opinion, these are okay  when warm, however these taste much better when cooled.

Addictive!  I tweaked this recipe only a little.  To increase flavor I reduced nuts to 3 cups but kept coating ingredients the same.  Be sure to wisk the egg white until it is VERY foamy.  Baking an extra 30 minutes increased the crunchiness!  It's important to use the correct size baking sheet for the amount of almonds - nuts should be single layer and just fill the pan - an old dark pan works best and I don't bother to spray it - I scrape up the extra sugar at end and throw it in with the nuts. After the first hour stir every 15 minutes and continue baking until the coating is dry.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I have been making roasted almonds for a few years at X-mas time for my sisters who absolutely adore them, but I have never really liked them much.  This year I decided to tweak the recipe a bit, and I am very, very happy with the results, SUPER!  For one thing, I took into consideration other reviews and double the coating.  Secondly, I comined the sugar and water and placed them over a double broiler (low heat), as I never liked the grainy feel of the roasted nuts that I have made in the past.  After the sugar was almost completely dissolved, I removed it from the double broiler and added 4x the cinnamon, and 2x the salt and 1 tsp of almond extract.  After combining and baking per the recipe, I was astounded by how good these are.  My sisters, who loved the roasted nuts I made before, say that there is absolutely no comparison to these.  YUMMY!

We're NOT worthy We're not worthy... AAHHH went to get this recipe for a co-worker (made them for holidays and have been "advised" to make them again) and started to salivate thinking of them! Also added 1/2 cup brown sugar & vanilla to egg white on second batch really did make them perfect!  I also am a firm believer in easy and Reynolds non stick foil is perfect in this recipe! no mess and the nuts come off with ease after drying and hardening(YUM!) oddly enough I was looking for a recipe initially that was like the mall nuts--but found I LOVED this on pecans even better--thought maybe peanuts would be good--no dont try it not good on peanuts!

A hit!  We made 4 batches of these fabulous nuts right before Christmas.  We gave part of them away as gifts, and ate way too many standing in the kitchen.  They are very easy, and very tasty.  I did make double the amount of coating so that the nuts would be totally covered, and used a bit of extra cinnamon.  A word of caution- they really stick to the baking sheet, so give it a spray of Pam, or use a nonstick pan.

Wow, these are great!  I added about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the egg white. If you are using salted nuts, omit the salt.  I also made a separate batch for my folks using Splenda since they are low carb-ing.  The Splenda batch was drier, so double the cinnamon / Splenda mixture for a heavier coating.  They loved them.  Also, I would strongly advise using PARCHMENT PAPER on the bottom of the pan (secure it with some spray oil) to make stirring & clean-up a breeze.

Excellent, everyone says they are very moorish! but, like others did I followed the recipe but also added a half cup of brown sugar,used 1/2 tsp of salt as my almonds were unsalted (salt brings out the flavour in everything without having to taste salty) and 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon! other that than that I follwed the recipe to a T!!! many thanks, I won't need to try another recipe as this one is perfect. I can't rate original recipe but with my changes it was deffinately a 5, I may add some maple syrup to the egg and vanilla next time too and use pecans!

These taste just like the ones from the stand at the mall.  And they charge $3.25 for an individual serving of them.  Much cheaper to make at home and they taste exactly the same.  One tip though, they are very sticky.  I baked them on parchment paper.  Also I used 1 tsp. cinnamon and also added a dash of vanilla.  My husband and I ate the whole first batch ourselves.  Can't wait to make more for my Christmas party!!

Very good, for best results decrease almonds to 3 cups, increase cinnamon and salt to 1 teaspoon each, DO NOT BE AFRAID OF THE SALT! It makes everything taste better. Add Â½ cup brown sugar.  Replace the water with vanilla extract. Make sure to beat the egg whites until they form almost stiff peaks.  After mixing everything together and pouring on a parchment lined baking sheet, smooth out the nuts with the back of a large spoon into a single layer and bake 1 hour, then take a pancake turner and mix the nuts, then spread them out again into a somewhat single layer and bake another 15 min.  Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.  P.S. use raw almonds, the original recipe do not specify what type to use.  I made about 15 batches of these for Christmas gifts this year.  I had a hard time keeping my dad out o them!

Three stars as written, because this recipe requires major tweaking in my opinion...there is not enough coating and the baking time or temperature is off. Either double the coating ingredients or use half the almonds. As for baking them, either increase baking time to get them really crunchy or increase oven temperature to 300 degrees. Still, worth trying again and tweaking till perfect.

I have been looking for a recipe for this since I bought some at a fair and I have found the perfect one and so easy.  I did have to change it some using the 1 tsp of vanilla to the eggs and 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and they turn out great.  I did use parchment paper which help so much so they did not stick and also sprayed the bottom of the pan with pam to hold the paper.  I will use this again and again.  Thanks for shareing the tips it helped a lot.

So wonderful and addictive!  I doubled the coating, quadrupled the cinnamon and replaced the water with vanilla.  I also replaced 1/2 the sugar with brown sugar and added a couple Tbsp. of honey.  I increased the baking time by 15 minutes.  So easy to adjust to your tastes - use whatever sugar and as much cinnamon as you prefer!

As I was stuffing my mouth with these fantastic nuts I kept thinking this coating would be great on pretzels.  Not as addictive as the nuts but good all the same.  I used a 15 oz bag of pretzel twists, 1 cup sugar, 3 egg whites, 3 teaspoons water, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, no salt.  I cooked in a disposable alum. roaster and that worked great.  I stirred more frequently and cooked it about 1h20m then turned off the oven and left it there for another 20m and then cooled completly.

I am giving this 4 stars because I used so many reviewers' tips when making this recipe.  I used vanilla in place of the water, added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the topping mixture and only used 3 cups of almonds. I also increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  I stirred them on the cookie sheet about every 20 minutes to break up the clumps.  They turned out wonderful and I am giving them as gifts in little Christmas bags.

These are great.  I did however change it.  I used vanilla extract instead of water to mix with the egg white, added a 1/2c of brown sugar to the 1/2c white sugar and I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I baked them for an hour and a half and stirred them up every 15 minutes.  They were crunchy this way.    I know that I am not rating this recipe per se, but rather a variation but this was a great starting point.  Yummy!

These are amazing!!! Don't be afraid to try it!  I altered it, like everyone else...used vanilla extract instead of water, added 1/2 c. brown sugar to the white sugar, and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also baked an extra 20 minutes to be sure they were crispy. I have already made 2 batches of these, and given most away as gifts!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These were very good and easy to make.  I think I'd like more cinnamon flavor in the coating, though.  I will double the cinn-sugar mixture next time, as suggested by some reviewers.  I took these to a party and served in an oversized martini glass -- fun presentation!

These are ALWAYS a huge hit when I make them. Eat them with reckless abandon!! I followed some older reviews and use 4 cups of almonds, 1/2 c. each of white and brown sugar, 1 teas. of vanilla, 1 teas. of cinnamon and 1/2 teas. of salt. I also bake these on a half bake sheet lined with a silpat - super easy cleanup!

Fantastic!  I made these for my mother for X-Mas and she just loved them.  I loved them so much, I tried it with other nuts I had on hand (walnuts, pecans, almonds, and cashews at one time).  It was delicious.  Don't limit yourself to just almonds here.  Any nut will do.

Really yummy! Took the advice of other reviews and doubled the coating using vanilla instead of water and brown sugar instead of white sugar plus added nutmeg and cloves and cooked it a half hour longer for the crunch.

These were absolutely great! I followed the recommendations to add vanilla, used half brown and half white sugar, double the cinnamon and double the coating.  The almonds were a big hit.

These were FABULOUS!  I did use 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla which I added to the sugar mixture before coating.  I will definitely be making these again!

Thank you for this healthy recipe! I tweaked to add ground ginger and cardamon, omitted the salt due to diet restrictions. There's a tiny bit of sodium in the egg white which is enough for us. The relatively high 18g total fat content is due to 16 g of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats - the good guys! Almonds are packed with vitamins and minerals too. My husband requests these with no concern for the healthiness of the recipe. I have them on hand for munch food. At about 22 nuts to a serving, this is a healthy and satisfying substitute for a bag of chips. Great for guests too.

I made this snack for my mother. She cannot eat regular sugar so I replaced the sugar with SweetLeaf stevia. For half the recipe that would be 2 cups of almonds I used 2 1/4 tsp of stevia. My mother absolutely loved this!

This was an awesome base recipe; however, since I was trying to replicate some almonds that I bought from a street vendor, I ended up making modifications for my second batch. Please try it this way - you won't regret it!!!  I reduced the nuts to 2 cups (you could also just double the coating ingredients...) for a heavier coating. I replaced the white sugar with dark brown sugar, increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp, and decreased the salt to 1/8 tsp. Make sure you let the nuts cool off most of the way before eating so the coating can harden, otherwise they will seem chewy.

These are AWESOME! They taste just as good as the ones you buy in the mall for a fraction of the cost.  My daughter and I made these and gave them away in cute little jars for the Holidays, we didn't stop getting compliments for about two weeks!  I did add about a tbsn of vanilla and also added an extra tbsn of cinnamon (maybe even more).  These turned out so well this will definately be the Christmas gift people look forward to next year!

I gave this in Christmas bags with other goodies and it was the biggest hit.  People raved about them!  I couldn't stop eating them either.  Almonds can be pricey, especially around the holidays, but you catch a good sale, they freeze well.

OK as is. With the following changes -- spectacular!! Sub almond extract for water, then toss THREE cups nuts with 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 t allspice, 1 t cinnamon, and 1/2 t salt. Bake for 1 hr, toss around in pan, then bake in 10 min increments till done to your liking!!

These are very good.  They are very similar to the ones we used to enjoy at German Christmas Markets.  We like to add more cinnamon than the recipe calls for though.

Used other suggestions of vanilla instead of water, and added 1/2 C. brown sugar.  On a low carb diet, so I used Splenda brown and granulated sugar for baking.  Turned out GREAT and WAY less sugar!

This recipe is fantastic.  I did what others suggested and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon and I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the egg whites.  They were great! I didn't find them too sweet at all with the extra sugar, so I don't know what they would taste like without it.  The only thing I may do differently next time is add a little more cinnamon.  Maybe 2 tsp like a few people suggested.

I did the same "upgrade" as others did- adding brown sugar and some vanilla extract with the egg white. A touch more cinnamon too...yeah, I know I'm not rating the original recipe, but these are so yummy I don't think anyone will really care. My house smells like a delectable bakery and these are frighteningly addictive.

These are amazing and so addicting.  I was making them for gifts and I had to make more because we ate most of them before I had the chance to wrap them. So I followed some other reviews, this is my suggestions double the recipe ofcourse.  I used 2x the amount of salt, 4x the cinnamon, and added 1tsp vanilla.  On the sugar I used half the regular sugar and the other half brown sugar. I added about four tablespoons of water to the ingrediants and warmed them up very low on the stove so that the sugar dissolves and ingrediants blend nicely together, then mix into almond and egg mixture.  It will seem like a lot but the longer the almonds cook the thicker the mixture gets.  I also recommend stirring almonds every 15 minutes to evenly distribute the mixture among the almonds, always make sure almonds are in a single layer on the cookie sheet.  I cooked them for an hour and they turned out perfect. I suggest if you giving these for gifts wrap immediately after cooling :)!!!

I am so happy to have found this recipe!   I love these nuts, but cringe at having to pay so much for them from the vendors at malls and events.  It was so incredibly easy to make, and I will be making these for years to come!  I think this would be great to give as a home-made gift, and I know they will impress my friends, family & co-workers!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and doubled the cinnamon & sugar, and I used 5 cups of almonds because that's what I had on hand, and they came out perfect!  Before I spread the almonds on the pan I put down a sheet of Reynold's Release foil so I wouldn't have to clean up a cooked on mess from my pan, and it worked famously!

They taste good but I doubled the topping and the whites made it gooey and the topping was gooey till I cooked it (there was no tossing, only stirring, it was so gooey).  I cooked them 1hr20min and they never looked pretty like the picture.  If you have any suggestions as to what I did wrong, please let me know.  They do taste great.  They just aren't pretty.

Soooo Good, my family loves them.  I did follow the advise of others and cut back to 3 cups of nuts and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1tsp vanilla.  I baked them for an hour and half stirring them every 15 minutes.  My husband said he liked them better than the mall!!! Wow Thanks for recipe!

YUMMY! Decided to make for a Christmas gathering and I'm not so sure it'll make until then because I can't stop eating them! Definitely add the 1/2 c.brown sugar and 1 t. vanilla.  If you don't use salted almonds then use 1/2 t. salt. Enjoy!!!

And so easy to make!  My whole house smelled wonderful!  I'm going to be making more for Christmas gifts!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I am on a low-carb diet so I substituted Splenda for the sugar and doubled it as per MLCASE's advice.  They came out awesome and you'd never know I didn't use regular sugar.  This recipe is definately a keeper and a great healthy snack.  Thank you BJ!

I soaked them in boiling water for a few minutes, to get rid of the oil.  When I made these, my wife loved them so much that she had me make batches for Christmas gifts.  The moral:  Making these can be time consuming because you can be making them A LOT!!!

The key is to make sure you roast them long enough.  I followed the recipe instrutions and they were still raw in the middle.  The next day, I roasted them for another hour at the same temerature and they were very yummy and everyone loved them!  Good and easy!  Oh, I used 1 teaspoon cinnamon.

This is an easy recipe and it tastes so good. I wanted more cinnamon so I just upped it from 1/2 tsp. to 1 tsp. and that gave it the kick I was looking for without being overwhelming.

These are awesome! I followed the advice of some of the previous reviewers and tweaked the recipe a bit. I added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, I substituted vanilla for the water, and I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I used two cups of almonds and two cups of walnuts. They both taste wonderful. They taste exactly like the nuts I always buy at the fair.

I think with tweaking the ingredients, you can increase the flavor quite a bit. I used  3/4 C. of brown sugar and a full teaspoon of cinnamon. Great recipe!

Don't skip step #2 where it says to "beat the egg white".  I forgot this once when making this fabulous recipe and I ended up throwing out the batch.  It just didn't work right w/o the frothy egg white.  We make this all the time and give it away as gifts.  Huge hit!  And it makes the house smell good too!

These are always a hit and I am always asked for the recipe when I bring them somewhere.  I use 1 lb. of raw almonds, double the topping (I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar), and stir every 20 minutes until done.

Followed recipe exactly, but they tasted bland.  Second try:  Doubled the salt and cinnamon, and used half vanilla and half water.  Now I liked them much better.  Lined pan with parchment paper and no need to butter the pan.  Also, I needed to roast them an extra 15 minutes.

Made the following changes:  added 1/2 tsp vanilla (forgot to replace it with water as others have suggested), added 1/4 cup brown sugar, and put in 1/4 tsp regular cinnamon and 1/4 tsp saigon cinnamon.  Boy, oh boy, were these almonds sugar coated, so I actually added in another cup of almonds.  They were good but I would cut down on the sugars and replace it with spices or honey for health's sake.  I would add more cinnamon next time too.

I'd give this 10 stars if possible. They taste like the nuts you get at the fair or mall. I took other reviewer's suggestions and used vanilla instead of water. Still used 1/2 c white sugar, added a 1/2 c brown sugar, and doubled the salt and cinnamon. This was the perfect amount to coat 3 c of a pecan/almond mix. DELICIOUS!

As per suggestions, doubled the coating mix, used oil on the pan.  Also threw in cashews; next I'll try hazelnuts.  Awesome, and good for gifts.

Great!  I only use walnuts or pecans so the mixture will adhere better to the nuts.  Use splenda for half the white sugar, dark brown sugar and double the cinnamon. Add 1 tsp vanilla to the egg white. Wonderful hostess gift during the holidays packaged in a mason jar.  Everyone wants the recipe!

Y-u-m-m-y!!  I just made a batch of these and followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't think they were sweet enough so I came back and read the reviews.  Based on the reviews, I made another batch of the coating (w/a little almond extract) then dumped the already toasted almonds in the second coating.  I then toasted them for another 30 minutes.  Now they are tasty!!!  I think this method might actually work better because the second batch of coating seemed to adhere better to the already toasted/sugared almonds. So you get a nice double layer of sweetness... and who can complain about that?!?!?

I got rave reviews from family and friends. I bought a bag of whole natural almonds and after reading the previous review, was concerned they would be chewy.  So I roasted them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and cooled them before proceeding with this recipe.  I also used vanilla.  I tasted one prior to popping in the oven and b/c it didn't seem sweet enough, added some (maybe 1/2c) of brown sugar.  These will also make a great school snack.  thanks!

I made the mistake of using raw whole almonds. The sugar coating turned out great but the nut was raw tasting and chewy. Tried baking them a little longer but the coating was then overcooked. I'm definitely gonna try again with roasted whole almonds.

My teenage son LOVED these!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted vanilla for the water.  Also since he is diabetic, I used Splenda instead of real sugar.  They were delicious and he ate 2 lbs the first evening.

Wow...awesome recipe! Everyone thought that these were the best they've ever had! As other reviewers recommended, I added the 1/2 C brown sugar, 1 t vanilla instead of water and baked for 1 hour 20 minutes. Now I have to go buy some more almonds...

Insanely amazing!  Just as good as the nuts you would buy at a fair or theme park.  I made the same recipe with almonds and pecans.  I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, extra cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the eggs.  I also melted about 1/3 cup of butter, let it cool and added it to the mix.  Delicious!  They keep well and are great christmas gifts!

These are sooo good!  Did as other reviewers suggested and used 3 cups of almonds, the extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, and cooked an extra 20 minutes!! I made them for a party and everyone loved them. I just didn't think they looked that pretty. I plan on making these again this week just to have on hand, something great to snack on and a nice change!

I made lots of changes to this one as I was baking the almonds. I added vanilla, salt, extra brown and white sugar plus more cinammon. I had to turned on the broiler on low and watched them carefully to glaze the sugar as I had to keep adding sugar. At the end of the cooking time these were still wet and had sugar on top due to my actions above, but the broiler did the trick in drying and glazing the sugar and made them  even crunchier. The extra sugar gave these that "bumpy" look of the one I found at the fair, instead of the shiny, not so tasty look I was getting by following the recipe. The almonds came out really good   and very, very close to the bought ones, if not better. The kids loved them,.. well ok me too :) The recipe gives the right idea but the ingredients are a little off so I will give this recipe a 3.

I have been searching for a recipe to make the almonds that we buy at the mall during the holiday season.  After a few minor changes, I found that this was as good, if not better.  I used unsalted almonds, no salt, and added 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla as a reader suggested.  I plan on packaging these for Christmas gifts for hard to buy for co-workers.

This is a fantastic recipe--exceeded my expectations! I made the changes suggested by other reviewers (1/2 cup each brown and white sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla), used unsalted almonds. I had to fight off my family (who kept sneaking these from the pan as they cooled) so I would have some left to give away! Don't worry--the nuts WILL dry as they bake, and they WILL crisp up as they cool. Wonderful. Can't wait to try with pecans. THANK YOU!

My favorite recipe of Christmas 2012 ~ I was in a cookie/candy exchange and chose to make this recipe for one of the candy options.  After reading through all the reviews I chose to sub vanilla for the 1 teaspoon of cold water.  This recipe comes together so quickly, that they are in the oven within 10 minutes of starting to make them.  The almonds I used were roasted almonds, but they contained very little salt.  My mom made the same recipe using salted whole roasted almonds and I liked the flavor of hers even better than the first batch I made.  It was the salty/sugar combination that I really enjoy.  For the second batch that I made, still using my almonds, I increased the salt 1 teaspoon and liked the taste much better.  This will not be a âChristmas onlyâ recipe for me, as my family loved these enough to be a âyear roundâ recipe!

I love roasted nuts from county fairs and ballparks. This recipe is the closest match I've found.   I substitute half the sugar with splenda, and I've also mixed in cashews and pecans.  I'm addicted to these now!

Like others before I tweaked the recipe, and it came out delicious! Therefore I am rating based on the modifications. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 c of brown sugar, and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I baked for 1hr, but next time i will try baking for an additional 30 min. I also stirred every 20 min. Really good stuff!!

Oh my my ... these are FABULOUS. Definitely took the advice of others and doubled the coating mixture ingredients. Also, bake for an hour and stir, then stir every 15 minutes for another 45 minutes. These are a godsend for those of us trying to cut back on sugar .. Splenda works great with these. I make these just about every week!

I took the advice of other reviewers and replaced the water with vanilla, added 1/2 cup of brown sugar (but just 1/3 cup of white sugar), and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I had walnuts, almonds, and cashews on hand, so I made a mixture of nuts.  The walnuts were especially good. These are very addicting nuts!

These made a great snack. I had to portion them out or would have eaten them all at once. I followed the other reviewer's recommendations and only used 3 cups of nuts, vanilla instead of water and added brown sugar.  Also threw in a little cayenne.

This is a great recipe and I use it around the Christmas holidays a lot and give them wrapped in tins or boxes as gifts.  I also use the egg white and water base but change up the spices with sea salt, 1/4 cup sugar, cayenne, cumin, curry, or just about any spice combination you desire.  You can also use liquid smoke in place of the water for a smoked almond flavor.  I have used this recipe many, many times.

Yum.   They were quick and easy to make.  My husband said they weren't sweet enough.  Hmm...how much more sugar can I add.  Maybe I'll try a little brown sugar next time mixed in with the white.  Can't hurt!

We made these for a Christmas snack and they sure went fast. We followed suggestions to add  some brown sugar, vanilla, and cooked a little longer. We used pecan halves and almonds. This will be a holiday tradition from now on. Thank you, for a crunchy, not too sweet, and delicious recipe!

I tried making these cinnamon-roasted almonds, and I wasn't really impressed, even with "improvements" of using vanilla instead of water, and doubling the cinnamon. Mine ended up looking nothing like the image, so maybe using sugar in the raw is better to give them a bit more texture.  I really preferred the Candied Almonds recipe found on allrecipes to this one. :\

They turned out great!  I did follow the previous advice of doubling the coating mixture.  If I did not do this, I would not have liked this recipe but in doing so added more crunch and sweet taste per nut.  I also like my nuts a little more on the crunchy side so I added 15 minutes to the cooking time.  With these modifications I thought this was a great recipe.

This recipe was so so but after I added 1 TSP vanilla and 1 TBSP KARO SYRUP to liquid ingredients and then 2x cinnamon, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar to dry ingredients and mixed and baked it the same way, it was perfect!

These are so good! Thanks to the reviews I read, I used 1 tsp vanilla instead of the water, doubled the salt and cinnamon and used 1/2 cup each of sugar and brown sugar. I used parchment paper on the pan for easy cleanup. I will definitely make these again!

Here's what I did... first I roasted 1lb of whole raw almonds (about 3c) in a 350 oven for 10 min., stirring once. Then I mixed 1 egg white, 1 Tbsp dark rum, 1/2 c powdered sugar, a sprinkling of ground ginger, a sprinkling of ground cloves, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, several grates of whole nutmeg, and many grates of cinnamon stick. I coated the hot nuts, adding a good pinch of salt, then threw them back in the oven (at 250) and stirred them every 15 min for 1 hr15min.
This resulted in a light coating that was  slightly sweet and flavorful. This is perfect for my tastes, but if you want more of a candy-type treat I would go with doubling all the ingredients except the almonds.

Everytime we're at the mall or a fair, my husband looks for the cart selling roasted almonds.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a shot.  He loves them! I did read several reviews beforehand and added some additional cinnamon and baked them about 1 hour and 20 minutes to make them nice and crunchy.  Our family enjoyed them at Thanksgiving too....it was a "left-over" they requested along with some turkey.

AWESOME!!! Probably the best recipe I've made from this site...and I've made a lot! My husband and I loved this recipe! In fact, my husband like them so much he asked me to not take them to our Bible study, like planned, because he didn't want to have to share!I too added the additional 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. I wouldn't make any other adjustments! Can't wait to try with pecans...YUMMY!!!

Fantastic! Made great christmas gifts, they were a big hit. I added brown sugar and vanilla as many of the other reviewers did. I also made pecans using the same recipe, and they were even better than the almonds. Easy and delicious -  will definitely make again.

UNBELIEVEABLE!  This are so amazing & super easy to make!  I used some of the suggestions & made the following changes:  I used unsalted instead of salted almonds (I tried one batch of each and the former came out much better, especially because this allows you to adjust the salt).  I used 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1 tsp. cinnamon and added 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1 tsp. vanilla.  They store very well too!

WOW! I changed the recipe slightly as suggested. Try doubling the topping as follows: Â½ cup sugar; Â½ cup brown sugar; Â½ tsp. salt; 1 tsp. cinnamon AND 1 tsp. of vanilla. This slight change makes a world of difference and definitely moves it from a 4 star to 5! Yum!

Used 1 teaspoon cinnamon and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Also I followed other reviewers suggestions and used Almonds and Pecans. Very, very good!!!! I am going to make these for the holidays too. This would be good to sprinkle of pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream.

I've tried this recipe and like others, increased the cinnamon - DELICIOUS!!  I don't do any frying but would like to know if you can fry these instead of baking?  If yes, how long and what temp should the oil be?

***WARNING***  MAY CAUSE ADDICTION!  I have used this recipe with pecans and even non-nut eaters loved them.  I did use more cinnamon than listed.  Put them in decorative tins/bags and they make wonderful gifts.

Only complaint - NOT ENOUGH!  This was terrific!  Very easy, and smelled great while baking.  Next time, I'll triple the batch! (At least!)

The best I have ever tasted!  I used more cinnamon and pecans fresh from Georgia.  These are great!

Extremely easy and delicious! Great way to roast almonds. I made a mistake though, only using 1 1/2 cups of almonds so the egg mixed with the cinnamon sugar so I had to again coat the almonds with more cinnamon sugar so there was 2x the amount of sugar... Still very good and as good as candy (but healthier).

I made this recipe for a family open-house. It
was simple to prepare and everyone loved them.So
true as many have said...very addicting. Thank-you
B.J. for a recipe that will remain in my home
for many years to come. I love pecans and can't
wait to try them as well. I think that I will do
gift packages next Christmas also.

I've made these nuts to give to family members as Christmas gifts twice now.  They're a big hit!  I just have trouble keeping my husband from eating all of them before I can get them packaged as gifts.

Cooked for just over an hour, maybe 1h20m. It's good, but not as good as the Texas Glazed Pecans. The pecans have more nooks for the sugar to get into so I like them more. Also I prefer LOTS of cinnamon.

Wonderful recipe! As others suggested, I use half white sugar, half brown. I have found that tossing them in the pan every 20 minutes gives them a great even coating and crunch in the end. I'm thinking of adding a little cayenne to make these sweet and spicy for a Super Bowl snack. Yummo!!

Easy to make.  For more crunch, set temperature slightly higher and/or leave in oven longer; also, cool completely before eating.

I used mixed nuts with this recipe.  The family ate the nuts all night long.  I left out the salt because they were already salted. It was okay, but not stellar. Will use it again as a quickie snack.

I watched a cooking show yesterday with a similar recipe.  That show put cimmamon, cardamom and ground ginger into the nuts- just a suggestion for tweeking.  I'll save this one for next year's holiday baking.  Nice idea for something different to add to the packages.  They'd be cute packaged in the oriental food boxes you can get at craft supply stores.

Delish!!  Only giving 4 stars because the recipe needed to be slightly changed.  I double the try ingredients and subed vanilla extract for the water.  If you don't double the dry ingredients then they do come out rather bland.  Everyone was in love with these nuts!!  I also used this recipe to candy pecans and it was a huge hit.

I love making this recipe.  Great snack to have on hand.  I follow the recipe for the most part. Except, I add about a teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavor.  I also use half white sugar and half brown sugar!

Had these in New York City and wanted to duplicate. After reading reviews took out 1 T sugar and replaced w/brown sugar and used vanilla instead of water. My traveling friends though they were better than the NY ones and my kids couldn't get enough; they were fabulous!!!

I tweaked the recipie and used splenda and brown sugar and added the vanilla like many reviews suggested.  I cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes and I think that was too long cause they seemed a little burned to me.  They taste O.K.  but didn't fly off the shelf.  I tried this because my family was not eating the almonds (though penuts and cashews go like crazy) but I think maybe we just do not like almonds.  So maybe it is just us and not the recipie.

As most have stated, I added more sugar, cinnamon to coat the almonds. I get requests for these every year around the holidays. I put them in little decorative bags for friends and family. I also substitute pecans for the almonds. My husband prefers the pecans but both are very good

These were great!  I also added vanilla to the mixture.  Only 4 stars though because I had to increase the oven temp - they were too chewy at 250 - I increased them to 300 for the last few minutes to make them crunchier.

These are soooo YUMMY!  I doubled the recipe and used almonds and pecans.  I did use vanilla instead of water in my egg whites and added brown sugar (not much because I was almost out).  I also added some cinn/maple sprinkle that I had on hand.  They turned out crunchy and delicious...

I don't bake much, but this recipe taught me that wax paper does not equal parchment paper. My friend and I spent 45 minutes picking the almonds off! I doubled the spices and added vanilla because reviews said to. They were delicious, and if we couldn't get the paper off of one, we'd use it as an excuse to eat it.

I just made these in my toaster oven and they taste delicious! I currently live in Korea and this was the taste of home I had been missing.  I added a 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the mix as well and it gave it a nice bit of maple flavor.  Love these!!

Made for x-mas parties. Everyone loved them. Made a few changes....Vanilla extract replaced water and 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c white sugar. This is a keeper!

I took others' advice and adapted the recipe, and it turned out EXCELLENT! I had at least 6 people ask me for the recipe. These would make great small gifts for teachers, coworkers, etc.

I doubled all the ingredients, except for the almonds, and added 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. I baked them at 250' for 1.5 hours, until the coating was dry. VERY EASY and you'll look like a baking pro!

This is DELICIOUS!!!! i used a 7.25 oz package of pecans thats what i had and i did not adjust the servings. i used vanilla instead of water and i only had to bake for the 1 hour and they are nice and crunchy.  Next time ill try brown sugar, but great recipe. My 3 year old cant stop eating them she says "i like pecans"

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.  I too modified the original to include 1/2 of brown sugar and a bit of vanilla.  I believe my friends will be very happy with the gifts I give them this year.

EXCELLENT AND ADDICTING!
I made these and brought them to work and everyone loved them!  I used slivered almonds instead of whole, and "halved" the recipe but shouldn't have.  We could have easily eaten 4 cups!  They were extra crunchy because of the slivered almonds, I think.  I used a non-stick cookie sheet but they still stuck a little bit because of the sugar. Be sure to mix half-way through baking to help avoid that. Next time I might add a few peanuts or oatmeal, and try vanilla in place of the water.  YUM!  That could be a nice mix! Enjoy - these are really good!

These were very addictive to snack on.  I followed the suggestions to double to "sauce" but next time I think I will maybe do 1 1/2 instead of completely doubling it -- just a little too much for me.  I also followed a suggestion to add some almond extract -- loved it!  I didn't have quite enough almonds so I added a cup of peanuts to get the nuts up to 4 cups.  Tasted pretty good.  I will be making this recipe again, and again, and again...

This is my standard Sugared & Seasoned Nut Recipe. Great for gifts or for hoarding for yourself! I like using pecans as well as almonds and also like using pumpkin pie spice instead of plain cinnamon.

I've read some of the reviews that alter the recipe with brown sugar, vanilla, etc., but I didn't think it tasted half as good as the original recipe! I made these and gave them away to neighbors and friends. They were a hit!  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. They sell these exact almonds here for about $6.99 for just a small serving! Thanks so much for the recipe and for saving me money. It's easy and fun to make!

This recipe is an instant classic around the holidays and my family just loves it! Although I have found that by scalding the almonds in boiling water for about a minute takes some of the bitterness out of the almonds and really releases their flavor. I also substituted confectioner's sugar for granulated sugar, as it melts faster and has a better consistency coating the almonds.

So simple, and oh so tasty!  Try it, you'll love it.  We also cut down to 3 cups of Almonds and it seemed to be perfect measurement.  Next time we may add cocoa powder in place of the cinnamon for a twist.

Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum!! What a tasty, sweet treat & even better, easy to make.
The only adjustment I made was to cook the almonds 30 minutes longer...giving them that great crunch I was hoping for. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe last night.  I'd mentioned to my housemate that it was a five-star recipe.  It couldn't be easier to prepare (I added about 1/2 tsp vanilla and reduced the water accordingly, btw).  When they were ready, I let my housemate be my guinea pig.  His assessment:  five stars.  My assessment:  five stars.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  This is a FABULOUS recipe--thanks!

I wanted a healthy, sweet treat change from my usual raw almonds and this is it! I used splenda instead of sugar and doubled the sauce I also increased the cinnamon and salt per another review, I think I could use even more salt, but it's addictive and delicious the way it is. Thanks.

These were so delicious!! They had a great texture--crunchy on the outside, but slightly chewy on the inside from baking.  I could have eaten the whole batch myself!

I really loved this little snack.  I brought it to a New Years Eve get
together and it was perfect to sit around and munch on while playing games.  I would definitly make these again & even think about giving them out in tins for the holidays. (I did add the brown sugar as others had suggested.)  5 stars for sure!

These were yummy! I followed some of the advice I read here and used slightly fewer almonds, added some brown sugar and more cinnamon. The result was fantastic! I am going to use these as the gifts I give to co-workers this Christmas.

These are great!  The only two things I did differently was to add extra vanilla and I used both white and brown sugar...they were yummy!  Everyone who tried them loved them.  The second time I made them I used half almonds half pecans and they were still great!

These are so delicious!  And so simple to make.  I followed some of the suggestions and I used 1 tsp. cinnamon and I also added 1/2 cup brown sugar.  They are very similar to some that we get at the Holiday Food & Craft Fair and also at the Scandinavian Festival.  These will make great gifts, if I don't eat them all first.

I was shopping at the mall with my kids and we could smell these cooking a mile away.  When we got up to the cart and had a sample I remembered that I had seen a recipe on this website and told them "I can make these for us!".  We stopped at the store on our way home and bought some almonds.  I bought both raw almonds and roasted unsalted ones.  Definitely buy the roasted ones!  I made the recipe exactly as written. 5 stars!

The house smelled wonderful while these were in the oven.  Next time I will double the ingredients because I did not think they had enough coating on them like they do at the fairs.  Will definetaly try making again.

These are so good that I have four year olds requesting them! They are amazingly easy to make, and keep very well.  A great alternative to the spicy nut recipes.  They're addicting.

Wow! This was a terrific recipe. So simple to prepare and tastes similiar to the flavored nuts you see being sold in the mall this time of year (winter holidays). I did take other reviewers advice and added about a teaspoon vanilla and it was great. (But I don't know what it would've tasted like without the vanilla either!) I'm going to make these again and try pecans next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Quick and easy - the tips for adding a dash of vanilla to
the egg white and water mix was great!  I also added a little more cinnamon. Would be really good on a mix of different nuts  i.e.  cashews.  Great to take to the office for a treat day.

Love, love, love this recipe.  I have been making these for a few years now and even give them out as gifts.  Everyone loves them and they never last long.  Can also be made with pecans!

Tip:  Decrease nuts to 3 cups.

Ok.....loved this recipe! Great gift giving idea...I decided to try a batch to see if they were worth it and they were...hubby loved these. A perfect little gift to give someone or as favors for company. My only change will be to add more cinnamon...maybe 1 tsp. instead of a 1/2 tsp. Quick and easy....a recipe keeper!

Loved this recipe.  However, I increased the sugar, then heavily dusted the hot almonds with confectioners sugar as I like them sweeter.  The increased sugar seemed to bring out the cinamon flavor.

I have made these several times and love them. I used pecans instead of the almonds.  I did follow some of the readers suggestion, (Chey1) and they are fantastic.  I would give this a 10 star.  They are that good.

So easy!!  I used to watch my mom make something similar, heating the mixture and using a candy thermometer to get it to the correct temperature and knew I'd never have the patience for that.  Baking is much simpler and gets the same great result!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and kept mine in the oven 30 minutes longer and that made a huge difference, they turned out perfectly crunchy (make sure to stir every 15 minutes throughout the whole cooking time).

Oooohh myyyyy! These are absolutely wonderful. Just made them for stocking stuffers, my house smells amazing and I had to give some to the neighbors so we wouldn't devour them all. The neighbors loved them too!
My changes:
  Added 1/2c brown sugar
  Replaced H20 with vanilla extract
I used two baking sheets, but only one covered in foil. I didn't cover the other b/c I ran out of foil. 

Differences:
Sheet covered in foil - less crispy & harder to toss the first time   only b/c they stick (thus more clean up)
Covered in foil - more crispy + easy cleanup

Both had a wonderful flavor but if I had to pick I'd say the ones that were cooked w/o foil were our favorite.

I guess if I were looking for an almond roasted sugar recipe than I would have "tweaked" it and added a  load more sugar like you other sweet toothed control freaks.  This recipe is perfect as is.  LOL LOL  I thought it was a delightful way to roast up some almonds and add a dab of flavor and they were plenty plenty sweet.  What is with you America?  Chill with all the sugar. Dang

Awesome recipe! I gave it four stars cause I think the changes people made, did make it better. Reading the recipe I thought it would need brown sugar also. So I too added vanilla and brown sugar along with the orginal ingredients. I am so happy to have found this recipe as it reminds me of roasted almonds from the renaissance feastival I went to.

These were so easy to make and were a hit at our New Year's party.  I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and an extra 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. My Tip: Use a Silicone Baking Mat (Silpat) to line your pan and clean up is a breeze.

I made these tonight and followed the recipe exactly. They taste good, but we could hardly taste the cinnamon, so I think next time I will double amount of cinnamon called for, as other reviewers did.

This was easy and turned out so yummy!  I made these before the holidays and plan to set them out for company.  I know they will be a hit.

Terrific. Like many other reviewers, I added a little vanilla, and it turned out wonderful. I wouldn't follow the recommendations to decrease the ratio of nuts to coating because it came out way too sweet that way and pretty nauseating when you grab a handful. The recipe is really pretty delicious as is.

My family and I went to Chicago last month and I had these at Navy Pier (OMG so good!!), so when we we got home I immediately came onto this site and hoped there was a recipe!  YAY! I was so excited when I came upon this one.  I made this recipe exactly as written and although it was good, I know that they can be even better.  Next time I make these, I will follow the advise of others and double my mixture, add vanilla and a little brown sugar.  This recipe has good bones and I know that I will be making this for years to come!!  Thanks BJ!

These are sooooo good. Just tweak the receipe a bit.  I followed a reveiw that others found helpful the person reviewing said to use 3 cups of almonds not 4 as stated that made them turn out great!  This was you get every almond well coated.

I used raw almonds and pecan halves, basically quadupled the recipe however ended up with a little extra egg white b/c the 4th one I accidentally cracked the yolk and to avoid any yolk in the mix I threw the rest of the egg in with the other yolks. So I thought I'd do one more egg just in case.  Final ingredient list: 4.5 egg whites, 1 tbl water, 4 tsp vanilla, 15 cups nuts, 1 cup white granulated sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp salt, 4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I beat the eggs first then mixed into that the sugar, etc, mixing in the nuts last.  I used the convection setting in my oven and baked it at 225 for 1hr 10min, stirring every 10-15 min.  It's very sticky the first couple stirs.  I'm pleased it turned out well since I'm planning on giving a lot of it away, as well as snacking on a whole bunch myself.

This recipe was pretty yummy, but I found one I like more that didn't have egg whites. I think the water and egg whites make the almonds a bit soggy.

These are pretty darned good (though not QUITE up to par with those I get at shows and fairs).  Good enough though that I'll NOT be making them very often as they get eaten WAAYY too quickly (and mostly by ME! lol).

This recipe is great as is.  Sometimes I substitute the white sugar for brown sugar and it comes out great either way.  The brown sugar gives them just a little less crunch, but a richer flavor.  I like to serve these for a Thanksgiving day appetizer and they're always a hit.  For a spicy twist (sounds crazy, but sweet/spicy is a favorite of mine) try adding a little touch of cajun seasoning or cayenne pepper to the recipe.  This gives you a pleasant little kick in the taste buds!  Thanks, BJ, for a great recipe.

I use a little more sugar and cinnamon or a fewer nuts to make it sweeter for my taste.  Also, it is best to stir it often so that the mixture coats the nuts well.

Do yourself a favor and double the recipe! We ate the first batch fresh out of the oven and I had to mix up another batch to share with guests. Your entire home will be filled with the smell of golden brown deliciousness!  These are especially good when they are warm.  A+ recipe, highly recommended!

OMG!!! This recipe is so wonderful. I love the smell of the roasted almond vendors in the mall at christmas time and this was even better. I had trouble putting the lid on the container. This recipe is fantastic and I will use it all year round! My whole family loved it and it is sooo easy to make.

Loved this recipe, however I did use some of the other reviewers notes suggestions.  You should double the amount of coating for the almonds to get a better covering.  Also, add 1/2 cup brown sugar and use 1 tsp vanilla instead of the water.

Wow. My kids and I couln't keep our hands off the huge batch I made. I'm going to add a bit more salt next time and I'm going to try a touch of almond extract. Definitely line your baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean up.  And make sure you give the almonds a stir or shake during baking. This is a perfect fall/winter snack. Thanks!

These are the closest I can find to what they serve at fairs.  I double the cinnamon and use brown sugar for half the sugar it calls for.  Be sure you grease your pan otherwise they're a huge pain to scrape off!

Made these as part of a hostess gift for the Holidays.  They were gone before everyone arrived.  I presented them in amber colored martini glasses with a small ornament attached.  Everyone was raving.

Wow these were super easy and really yummy!  I made it according to recipe and thought they were really good, however I think I will add more cinnamon next time, and I might try the vanilla instead of the water as noted in other reviews. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Really super nice. I`ve already made loads and given also to my family. They all loved it very much. For my mum i have mixed pecans with the almonds, they stay softer, yet still have a crispy coating. Yummy!! Next time i`ll try this recipe with a differend mix of nuts. But the pecan and almond mix was fantastic.

This is the best roasted nut recipe and I've been making them this way for years. One thing that I've done to give them 'extra' flavor is to substitute some rum for the water.  Yummy!

I made this recipe tonight and found it  very good. I double all but the sugar and water. Also added 1/2 cup of brown sugar which made a good combination. However, eating to many of these will give you one good stomach ach! Just ask my daughter.

These almonds were delicious. Just like the ones that they make in the mall around the Holidays. I like mine a little drier, so I let them go an additional 10-15 minutes longer than the hour recommended, and they turned out great. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is two great things: very simple, and very forgiving.  I've tried all sorts of variations, based on other reviewers' comments.  What I like best is using the 4 cups of almonds, but doubling everything else.  Saigon cinnamon, I think, is the most fragrant and potent (I REALLY like cinnamon).  I've tried it with Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus Blend, but I still think Saigon Cinnamon tastes better.
I also use 1tsp water, and 1tsp vanilla.  I also use 1/2cup white sugar and 1/2cup turbinado sugar.
Even with several experimental preparations, these nuts have never tasted bad!

Made these three times with success. Very very good with both almonds and pecans (we live in the south). Definitely spray your pan or use a silpat on your cookie sheet and turn over every 15 minutes to roast evenly.

TREMENDOUS! I thought Planters had the patent on nuts this good, but these are just as good as any canned nuts I've had. Mine turned out perfectly salty/sweet with just enough cinnamon to shine through (without being overwhelming.) The possibilities for customizing these are endless (nutmeg? Pumpkin Pie Spice?)  Anyway, thanks for a great snack!

The girls in my office ate this up! They say it tastes exactly like the almonds you smell in the malls at Christmastime.  I sprayed my pan with Butter flavored Pam, but other than that, I followed the exact recipe.  The smell of my house as they were cooking was divine!  This would be a good thing to give to your co-workers/neighbors instead of the traditional christmas cookies.

i followed the directions exactly except i added extra cinnamon and vanilla. and all i can figure is the stars were not aligned just right and the universe was not in rhythm with my oven....because they were not sweet and tasted a bit burned. with all of the rave reviews, maybe you can only blame my lack of ability in the kitchen...but these were just not good.

This recipe is fantastic with the addition of the vanilla, brown sugar and extra cinnamon. No one could keep their hands out of them!

Great recipe!  The 2nd time I made them, I used a reviewer's advice and added vanilla (yum) and brown sugar (too sweet).  This will definitely be on the menu for "The Big Game" this weekend.  Go Steelers!:))

My husband absolutely loved these, as did I. Simple to make--just about foolproof! I used a teaspoon of vanilla extract the second time I made them, and brown sugar instead of white. Next time I might add more sugar and cinnamon.

made these for my dad for Christmas gift - used pecans instead of almonds & turned out great!  not quite like the ones sold at the craft bazaar where the guy makes them right there with some special cooker - but almost as good.  Tumbled them around on the cookie sheet with a fork every 20 minutes until hour was done. Even my almost 2-yr-old son loves them - kept grabbing them off the cookie sheet. Used a Sil-Pat to line my cookie sheet for easy clean up. Hard to keep my hands off them!

These are SO delicious. I make them every year for gifts at Chrismastime. Wrapped in cello bags with a ribbon they are the perfect gift to have on hand for unexpected guests or last minute exchanges.

I never change a thing. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

* 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1 tsp vanilla
Easy to snack on. I'm sure I will have to make more soon!

I gave this to a few friends for Christmas and apologized as handed over the bag.  Everyone said "Why, are they addictive?"  Yes, they are!!!  I made this with mixed nuts and added more spice and the half cup brown sugar that another reveiwer suggested.  Every time I went to check on them, just couldn't resist eating some right off the hot pan!  FABULOUS!!!  The recipe says to let them cool--not too long or they stick to the pan.  If that happens to you, just heat them up alittle and they will come off.  Though the pan was easier to clean than I thought, might try lining the pan with foil next time.  I'm sure that will be soon!

I am cooking these nuts now, but they still seem really wet.  Do they get dryer as they cook? Or did I do something wrong, like not beat the egg white not enough?

Yum! I had a bunch of raw whole almonds that I needed to use, so I thought this recipe would be good. I changed it as others suggested by adding 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and doubled the salt and cinnamon. Everyone enjoyed them, and I think I'll make another batch to give out to friends for the holidays! Thanks!

I made two batches, one with the original recipe, then another with 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 t salt and 1 t of vanilla in the egg mixture like another reviewer had suggested.  The second batch that the reviewer had suggested came out much better.  They are addicting.  Everyone loved them at Thanksgiving and I'm going to hand them out for X-mas.

I have been making these using cashews at Christmas for the past several years and now everyone looks forward to them. They are so easy to make. It will really work with almost any type of tree nut. I line the baking sheet with non-stick aluminum foil, makes clean up a breeze. The only change I make is to double the amount of cinnamon and, if I'm use salted nuts I leave out the salt.

I replaced the almonds with pecans in this recipe and was THRILLED with the turn out.  I never make any candies or mixes like this, they seem a little intimidating... but these were as easy as they sound and taste incredible.  I placed them in party favor boxes and handed them out at a family Christmas party... they were a hit!

WOW!  These are delicious, and this is a great way to sugar an assortment of nuts.  They are a hit at my house and with my guests.  Thanks very much for sharing the recipe.

This recipe turned out great!  I also used it for pecans and they turned out fine as well.  I added just a smidge of vanilla for extra taste.

These are extremely easy to make and taste DEEEELICIOUS!  Hard to eat just a few because they are addictive.  I used this recipe with pecans and they also came out great.  It got rave reviews at the office.  Thanks for sharing!

We are nuts about these almonds! I added 3X more cinnamon and 2X more salt then called for in recipe. My husband insists they are excellent with a cold beer and a football game. Will make again and again.

Delicious nuts!  I gave these to my family for Christmas.  I also doubled the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  The only thing I wish for is that more of the cinnamon coating stay on the nuts and not to my cookie sheet (I used a teflon coated sheet with vegetable spray - it still got stuck).

These nuts are a great idea, but the recipe could use some tweaking.  I doubled the cinnamon, and I think it helped.  They could still use some more flavour though, I think an extract (almond, rum, etc) would be good.  Regardless, they still turned out great, I just think they could be better.

These were okay.  Nothing to brag about.  I threw away about half of the batch.  After all the wonderful reviews, I thought they would be just like the ones that you get at the mall at Christmas time.  I took them to a pot luck treat party and there was only 1 person that said they really liked them but when I tried to give her the remainder of them, she declined.  I guess she was just trying to be polite.

This makes A LOT of almonds, and it's worth it. They are great snacks, and though both myself and my Dad love them, we are slow in eating them. Consequently, we have a good store of them for the future, and these will certainly keep well. I bring a small baggie of them with me when I go on walks.

This was an easy and quick recipe.  While they were in the oven I had time to focus on all the other things I had to prepare.  They were a great hit among all age groups, and could be used as an appetizer, or a desert because of their sweetness.  They are very addictive, but I think that next time I make the recipe I'll add a little bit more cinnamon.

Big hit!  You can be creative with this recipe! Add/change flavors to garlic, butter, use your imagination.  It was nice being able to set this out on a daily basis during the holiday.  A great Chrstmas gift as well.

I just made a triple batch of these nuts and they're just as easy to make in large quantities.  I also think it's a good sign when you are tempted to nibble at every stage of preparation!  I also tried this a second time with 1/2 tsp. of Chinese Five Spice, which gave it a light anise undertone.

I modified based on this review: 
tweeking for a perfect end result. The changes made: substitute 1tsp. vanilla for the water, add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to dry ingredients, increase the cinnamon to 1tsp. used 1/2 cup of white sugar ingredient,used a 16oz. pkg. of almonds for this recipe to ensure good coating. If using more nuts, increase the coating ingredients. Cooked my batch on a cookie sheet with parchment paper (easy cleanup) at 250 degrees for 1hr.15mins. stirring every 20 mins or so.

I used 1 t. vanilla (instead of the water) with the egg. I added 1/2 c. brown sugar. I increased the cinnamon to 2 t! (I love cinnamon). I baked on parchment paper and increased the baking to 1hr 15 min, stirring every 20 min. As another reviewer suggested, keep the sugar 'crumbs' that come from this after baking to use on yogurt, etc. The nuts were at hit at a football game viewing party!

I halved the recipe and used less than 1/4C sugar. Then when the nuts were spread on the cookie sheet, I sprinkled generously with course Kosher salt. A great sweet-salty snack.

My go to recipe for almonds! Iâve brought these to several parties and they are gone within minutes. I used vanilla instead of water like another reviewer recommended. Also increased the cinnamon due to liking cinnamon a lot. If the nuts are sticky, they arenât done yet! I usually bake them about 75 minutes.

These were pretty good. To be honest, I made a couple of changes based on my diet and what I had on hand. I halved the recipe and used a 50/50 (by volume) mixture of almonds and peanuts because I didn't have as much as the recipe called for. Then I substituted an equal amount of a powdered stevia & maltodextrin blend for the sugar called for. Despite the lack of sucrose, the nut mix was tasty. Next time, I think I'd add a couple of spices in addition to the cinnamon (maybe some cayenne or chipotle powder for heat, or some nutmeg, cloves, etc., for a holiday flavor) to give the overall flavor more depth. Still, when I get a craving for sweet junk food, I reach for these instead, and they help curb those cravings. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Oh my are these fantastic!  Iâve made them many times over the last couple years, and have given them as gifts as well as getting my co-workers hooked on them to the point they ask me to make them regularly. I use pre-salted nuts so I leave the salt out, and substitute some of the water for homemade vanilla. Otherwise everything is the same. I have made these with pecans, which are amazing also and both are fantastic for snacking or on salads. Thanks!!!

I followed some other reviewers suggestions of doubling the coating (4x the cinnamon) as well as increasing the oven temp to 300 and they came out wonderfully (and under  an hour). I tripled the recipe and gave as part of my Christmas Treat Bags as well as serving as part of my Christmas Dessert Buffet.  My guest were thrilled when they found out they each got a bag of nuts to take home.

I did not have almonds ar the time so I used walnuts.  It turned out great.  We were going on a trip and I wasted something easy to take to snack on waiting in airports and on long flights.  These were perfect and so delicious!

I replaced the sugar with Stevia (using only a half cup) and the salt with "No Salt Salt" (using only 1/4 tsp) and it turned out to be a delightful snack!

It was my first time roasting nuts. After baking for an hour I tried the almonds and they were kind of soggy. Initially I was worried that the nuts would be soggy but they dried up pretty crunchy. Overall the recipe was good but I wish it had more cinnamon flavor. And I even sprinkled quite a lot of cinnamon to the nuts. 

I would like to try the recipe again next time but perhaps make them spicy with chili or cayenne powder.

Really good with the other suggestions. Didn't make it exactly the recipe so couldn't tell, but with the adjustments turned out excellent. Will make again and can be made with other nuts.

Delicious! Extremely simply to make but be sure to follow other reviewers instructions - cook the almonds in the cinnamon/sugar mixture until the consistency is not longer gooey and becomes crystallized. I used natural raw almonds and just added a few pinches of salt to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.

This was the easiest snack I've made.  I did two batches with almonds and two batches with pecans. The only tweeking  i did was add a bit more cinnamon.  No brown sugar and it was perfect.  Just finished my 4th batch.

For my first time making, this was so easy to make and is a great snack for the Holidays.  Like many others, I changed recipe slightly.  I used only 3 cups of almonds, replaced vanilla for the water and doubled the cinnamon.  I also added about 1/4 cup brown sugar.  For an additional special ingredient I added 1 Tsp of Rum (Captain Morgan).  Why?  Just because of course!

I make these every year for my kid's teahers , they look forward to them every year!  I put them in mini chinese food take out containers that I got at the dollar store, each kids takes about 20-25 containers for teachers, crossing guards, cafeteria workers, etc.    I used 3 egg white and 1 1/2 tbls. water and 1 1/2 tbls. vanilla.  I doubled the sugar, cinnamon and salt.    I used a 3 pound bag of almonds from Costco and these ratios were perfect.

Make smaller batches, it turns out a lot better. I cut the recipe in half and added more cinnamon (about 50%) and sugar. Baked for 45 minutes, flipped them and sprinkled  a small amount of cinnamon sugar over them once more, then baked them for about 20 more minutes. I also added vanilla to the egg mixture as well.

Delicious. My house smelled AMAZING!! I made this as a gift for my dad who loves the kind you purchase, so i hope that he likes these!!!I took another's advice and used some brown sugar, Splenda , more cinnamon and vanilla. My adjustment would be to use even less almonds-maybe 1/2 to 3/4 lbs. But i am definitely keeping this recipe!

My wife and I love this recipe. I decreased the sugar to a heaping 1/4 cup and doubled the cinnamon. 
The single egg white binds the other ingredients beautifully to the almonds and  is the perfect amount for 4 cups. 
We will enjoy tailoring this recipe further to our flavor preferences. Awesome work. Thanks for sharing!!

Num.  I kept to the recipe.  Excellent texture, just the right amount of sweetnes, although next time I probably will add a touch more cinnamon.  I thoroughly enjoyed both making and eating these.  Bonus is the wonderful smell while baking

I have been making this recipe for several years now.  I have made the recipe exactly as written, which is quite good, but they are phenomenal with the following revisions: substitue 1 tsp vanilla instead of water.; add 1/2 cup brown sugar to the white sugar and cinnamon mixture; increase cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Also, be sure to use parchment paper for easy clean up.  If you put them directly on the pan, you could be scrubbing for hours once the sugar mixture hardens.  These are great to bring to holiday parties - everyone loves them!

I randomly looked up this recipe and went by it as written.  Meh, kind of bland.  I've made these before using other recipes that were similar that ended up being much tastier. Ended up sprinkling sugar on them after baking.

I followed the recipe to a T.  The only minor change I made was adding 3 drops of doTERRA's OnGuard essential oil blend to the egg white mixture to add another layer of flavor.  It turned out amazing!  I'm a doTERRA Wellness Advocate, so I add essential oils to recipes when I can for added health benefits.

These were just too good not to make multiple times!!  I took other reviewers advice and doubled the goop - it takes a little longer to bake, but my o my, are they delicious!

My mom gave me this recipe at least 30 years ago. I swap out the 1 tsp of water for 1/2 tsp Almond extract, a little of that goes a very long way. I beat the egg whites till very frothy and double the cinnamon sugar using a 50/50 mixture of white sugar and light brown sugar. When making candied Pecans, my favorite nut, I'll use maple extract. Sometimes if making a double batch I'll add just one dash of cayenne pepper to the egg white mixture and use that on the second batch. Either way they're very addictive.

O.M.Gosh...I just finished a batch of these nuts & they were amazing. After reading a number of reviews, I made several adjustments to suit our tastes. I subbed Splenda for the white sugar & added 1/2 c Splenda brown sugar blend (diabetic in the house); decreased the nuts to 2 c and also increased the (roasted) cinnamon to 2 tsp, but think I will try more cinnamon next time. The parchment paper made for a really easy clean-up.  Thanks BJ for the great recipe!

Easy and good! Perfect for the group I'm having over tomorrow. :) I only used 3 C almonds, and decreased the sugar by about 1/4. (Edited later: as they cooled, they didn't taste as great.)

I have made these several times and each time I bake them for 1 hr & 30 minutes and I stir every 20 minutes during the cooking process.  They are delicious BUT after I take them out of the oven within minutes they are stuck together really bad even though they are spread out on a big metal tray.  Then I end up having to break them apart.  Does anyone have this problem so can someone provide me with a suggestion or solution?  Thanks very much

I make these with almonds, pecans and walnuts. I like the pecans the best. I followed the reviews and add in 1/2 C brown sugar to the dry mix and add vanilla to the egg whites. This last batch I didn't double the cinnamon but if you want them cinnamon tasting, you should, otherwise they are more like candied nuts (and I prefer this). They are addictive but 4 stars only b/c there are so many changes to make them better.

This is a staple in our house during the cold months. This is the most requested snack in the family for christmas day while the kids are playing around with their new toys. I love the ease of making these nuts. I forgot them in the oven once for 15 minutes more than it should be, they still didnt taste over roasted or burnt. Exceptional recipe.

used 1 TBS cinnamon, no salt, 1/3 cup light brown sugar (which i mixed in my bullet)used vanilla extract for the water....baked in 250 deg oven for 1:20, stirring after each 20 mins.....
we love these almonds, but we really love cinnamon, so i upped the amount.....nuts made with the egg white as opposed to an oil mixture come out much better, and with less calories......i make a pound of these every week!!

My home smells divine from these little treats! So simple to make, I took the advice of others and used vanilla instead of water - I also doubled the recipe (eyeball, I'm not fancy ;) )with two egg whites. I added a dash of nutmeg and forgot about the tip to add brown sugar until I had already poured the almond mixture on the pan so I sprinkled some on top and due to the regular stirring it incorporated quite seamlessly. These are AMAZING. Definitely making these for Christmas!

I don't like high-in-sugar snacks, so I only added 1 tablespoon of sugar, a ton of cinnamon, and a pinch of ground cloves.  Good stuff.

These were very good.  The first batch I followed the recipe exactly.  The second batch I made I used pecans and doubled the cinnamon and sugar.  This really gave them a nice, thick coating.  Everyone liked them and I have made many requests for the recipe.

Good as a base recipe but could use a lot more flavor. Next time I'll add more cinnamon, maybe also some allspice or cloves. I beat the eggs almost to soft peaks (perhaps 3 minutes?), so that I easily had enough moisture to stir in the sugar and spices, and then to coat the nuts. They really do take an hour in the oven. I knew mine were done when they didn't stick to the (nonstick) tin foil anymore.

I even added the vanilla and brown sugar that others suggested.  I am not sure what I did wrong but none of the sugar stuck to the almonds so it was really just a waste of ingredients.

I love getting roasted almonds at fairs, and was so excited to find a recipe to use at home. I followed one reviewers tip and added 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, increased the cinnamon to 1 Tsp, and let them cook about 20 extra minutes or so to make them a little crispier. Stirring every 15min. They turned out great and my family loved 'em!

These are addictive! I followed the suggestions about using vanilla and brown sugar...I wasn't sure if I was supposed to include the same amount of white sugar though. I ended up using about 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and almost 1/2 tsp salt for just over 2 cups of almonds, and I ended up with some extra of this mixture, so it probably would have been the perfect amount for 2.5 - 3 cups almonds.

I made this for my coworkers last Christmas, and they were an absolute HIT!!!  I made 4 kinds of almonds and these were the most popular!  I brought in what I had saved for my family to coworker CK and he ate it ALL...including all the creams that fell off of the almonds!

I had a large container of almonds from SAM'S club... I wanted to do something with them, I found this recipe.  The almonds were roasted & salted so I didn't add the salt that the recipe called for.  It was easy and they taste great!  I am wrapped them up in little bags, put a ribbon on them and I am going to give them out as favors at my New Years party.

I made these to use for gifts this holiday season and I have had rave reviews on them from everyone who had tried them.  I would definitely recommend them to all as they are easy to make. I did add the 1/2 cup of brown sugar and the vanilla that others recommended.  I got a big container of almonds from Costco and it was enough to make 2 batches.  A winner recipe and many thanks for posting it!

These are so good! And my house smelled amazing! Like several other reviewers, I swapped vanilla for the water, added 1/2 c. brown sugar, and used 1 tsp. cinnamon. I also lined my pan with foil for easier clean-up. will definitely make again.

Talk about a hit.  My daughter eats most of these when I make them at Christmas, and then talks about when I am going to make them again throughout the rest of the year.

I made these after I had them at Disney. They are not quite as delicious but they are very close. I make them for our annual Christmas party. Everyone loves them!

I brought these to a holiday party, but we arrived late so they didn't all get eaten.   The host told me she really liked them -- and as evidence asked me for the recipe last Easter (4 months after she first tried them!).
The leftovers kept very well, too!
YUM.

Thanks for the recipe! Made 2 batch of seasoning as suggested and it was perfect for 1 batch of nuts! Only other change was I added ground nutmeg.

This is a great recipe !  The only thing I changed, I used sucralose vs real sugar.  They were excellent. . . . glad I read the other reviews about the additional cooking time.  Friends are wanting more of them !!!!!

This recipe is a grand slam.  Everyone I've made it for has loved it.  It was even requested as a wedding party favor.  I've also added a litted nutmeg and sometimes Frangelico, for extra flavor.

These are great!  I do double the coating, and add some clear vanilla in place of the 2nd tsp water.  There are several variations in the comments that I have tried and liked also.  Tweaked or as is, this is a GREAT recipe!

Two words: parchment paper! Line your jelly roll pan with that and clean up is a breeze. I always make as written, except I use a heaping 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, so it's probably more like 3/4 tsp. Everybody requests these at Christmas now.

Great recipe! Doesn't taste quite like the farmers market almonds that I love, but close enough! I doubled the coating and baked for an extra 25 minutes to make the almonds nice and crunchy! I will definately make this again!

These almonds were fabulous!  I made them for Christmas ahead of time and they definitely improved with age.  Everyone I gave them to loved them.  I will definitely make these again, perhaps replacing the egg white with maple syrup.  I tend to use egg replacers quite often and I think that would work well here.

Overall a decent recipe. i used 2 egg whites, added a splash of vanilla extract and a touch more cinnamon (I still think it could use more cinnamon).  I lined my jelly roll pan with parchement and cooked the nuts for an hour and 20 minutes.  The longer cooking time gave the nuts the crunch I was looking for.

This was an easy recipie that turned out perfect. I had no problems with sticking or the coating. I just used spray canola oil on my jelly roll pan. There was not any loose coating and it is very tasty. Habit forming!Mmmmmmmm!

Great recipe.  I made it with granulated splenda and it turned out great.  Make sure not to skim on toasting time, it makes the almonds crunchy rather then soft.

Made this for my niece's bridal shower. Used cashews because my niece is allergic to almonds. I added a little freshly grated nutmeg. Everyone loved them, but couldn't taste the spices very well. Next time will add more. Very tasty- thanks!!!

I did not love this recipe, but one of my relatives thought it was fantastic.  I think this is one of those recipes that you'll either think is great or just so-so, depending on personal preference.  I was really hoping to love this, so I guess I will keep looking...

I followed others advice and added brown sugar, extra cinnamon and vanilla.  Turned out great!  I used salted roasted almonds (couldn't find unsalted roasted almonds anywhere) and made three batches--only the second one was subpar because I forgot to leave the salt out.

These are easy and fabulous!  I made them in addition to my usual cookies over the holidays, and they were a huge success!  I did double the amount of cinnamon used, but only because I love cinnamon.  I also used an 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 pyrex dish because I don't have a jelly roll pan, but it seemed to work well.  Great recipe!

These were lethal to have in the house! I just could not stop eating them. I also tried a second batch with almonds, cashews and pecans. I didn't like the cashews but the pecans were yummy! Next time I'll try walnuts as well.

This was a great recipe. The smell from this recipe was amazing and just filled the house. They tasted amazing and were a perfect addition to the holiday party. It was so easy, but made people think that you had spent all day making them or that you had to buy them store bought. Would recommend trying this recipe at all holiday parties.

I made these for a holiday party. Following other reviews, I used pecans and added vanila and brown sugar. They were excellent. The only thing I would do different is use more pecans the next time. The liquid almost turned into a merangue on the nuts and I would prefer more of a coating and not so thick. Good recipe.

These are wonderful...I didn't have enough almonds, so I did a 3rd of each, almonds, walnuts and pecans...believe it or not, the walnuts were everyone's favourite. Costco sells the freshest, best tasting walnuts, so they really came through in this recipe. I'm about to make my 3rd batch and it's not even Christmas yet.  :)  Thanks BJ

DELICIOUS!! I used raw almonds and 3/4 t of cinnamon and I think they turned out perfect.  Someone mentioned using roasted almonds, but since you are roasting them youself for 1 hour that seems like they would taste kind of burned.

I made these tonight and they are AWESOME!  I too added brown sugar and vanilla extract.  They turned out great!  I was a little worried when they were baking because they were wet and shiny but they turned out great!  My husband and I could not stop eating them and I made them for him to bring to work:)

Super easy and super yummy.  I got a huge bag of almonds at Sam's club for about 10 bucks.  When I finished making the almonds, I put them in clear gift bags & tied them with some string with beads.  An easy little gift or party favor to have on hand.

My husband LOVED these nuts.  So much in fact that when he is away on business, he asked that I make some and mail to him.  I personally found these nuts to be just "okay" however they were very easy to make and since my hubby loved them so much I gave it a 5 star rating.

I got so addicted to these when I tried them at the county fair, and knew I had to duplicate them at home somehow. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. So, so good. It also works well with pecans, I've found.

I cannot say enough about this recipe. It is one of my all time favorites! The best! I used the previous suggestions to add brown sugar, vanilla and more cinnamon and they were great! I actually prefer this recipe with using cashews or pecans. So easy and sooo good!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!! I finally found the key to having the crunch coating that the mall roasted nuts always have!!  I did use walnuts instead of almonds and used splenda instead of sugar to make it a wonderful snack!! Also gave some as a gift to a diabetic relative.  Thanks for this great recipe!

We are seriously addicted to these. I have to limit them to the holidays so that we don't overdo it! I give them as gifts, and everyone is so appreciative. I also add pecans sometimes. Yum-my!

Everyone loves this recipe!   We used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, and 2 tsp of cinnamon and they turned out wonderfully!   We put them in holiday treat bags, tied them with ribbon, and gave them as small gifts for coworkers, neighbors and the mail carrier.  The only drawback is that they are so addicting and you can't stop eating them.

i was a little nervous as i cooked them i wasn't sure if they were burning or not but they ended up fine! i will reiterate the advice about adding more cinnamon and a bit of vanilla and brown sugar gives it a nicer crunch.  all in all quite delicious!

I doubled the topping and omitted salt since I was using salted nuts.  These turned out great!  I din't like them warm out of the oven, but as soon as they cooled they were great!!!  Easy recipe too.

Tasty treats.   I made according to recipe only doubling the cinnamon.   Just beware if you are a SALTY NUT FREAK, change your expectations to SWEET before popping the first one in your mouth.  Once you get over the "shock", you'll realize just how good they really are!

This is the perfect thing to make and give to bus drivers or as a hostess gift in a cute package.  I used pecans because they were on sale.  I'm sure they tasted very good, because my family devoured them before I could even grab a sample!

I added more cinnamon as suggested, but wish I had also added more salt. I typically like more of the salty/sweet tastes combined while this recipe is primarliy just sweet. Very easy.

Loved it! Made this for a holiday get-together for the faculty at my husband's school and they were a hit! I would use a bit more salt next time, but overall, they taste just like the ones I paid $12 for at Williams-Sonoma last year. I'm going to make a batch for gifts.

This is definitely something I will make again--so fast and easy! But next time I will add much more cinnamon, and perhaps some cloves and ginger.

I took these nuts to a football game.  They went over big.  I'm making these for the holidays and putting them in decorative bags for little presents.  Be careful. . . these things are addicting!

I used pecans rather than almonds just because I had them.  They were a real hit! I'm sending the recipe off this morning to the people we shared last evening with.  GREAT!

These are wonderful and are just as good if you use pecans.  Only lasted a day at our house.  Next time will double the batch.
