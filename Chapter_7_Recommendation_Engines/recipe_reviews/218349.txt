I submitted this recipe and just wanted to mention that I do not drain the mushrooms, the juice is needed for the gravy. Enjoy!

Totally easy.  Melt-in-your-mouth! The Brisket came out wonderful!  I was out of garlic powder & simply used salt.  The onion soup mix was the key.  I also substituted the beef gravy for beef broth with a dash of Gravy master.  (but a can of onion soup, or beef broth with chopped onions will do just fine as well!)  The Italian salad dressing is important.  Make some of it if you have to.  (Oil, vinegar, & your favorite Italian spices)  As long as the meat is lightly seasoned, and sitting 1/3 deep in whatever liquid you concoct... having it tightly covered in foil will make it come out fine!  Be creative & use what you have in the pantry.  275 degrees for 4 hours.  Pair with any starch, vegetable & wine!  Enjoy!

I made this tonight with a few minor adjustments. I used garlic instead of garlic salt and seasoned salt in place on meat tenderizer. And I did not have beef gravy, so I just add water to the italian dressing. mushroom , and dry onion soup mix. It was so tender. Probably the best brisket I have made in a long time. I cooked for 3  hrs 45 mins... 
Served it mashed potatoes and gravy from the meat.

I had leftover brisket I had cooked over the weekend. This was just the ticket to get a hot meal on the table in a hurry! I really liked the flavors. My DS is not a fan of mushrooms so I left those out. I had a brain fart and forgot to add the Italian dressing but I used a couple bay leaves & 1 teaspoon of rosemary which gave the gravy a pleasant earthy fragrance/taste! As you can see, I served it over my homemade mashed taters. Very YummO!! Thank you gagirl90.:)

very nice use for brisket, turned out very flavorful,
was easy to make, just put it in the oven and forget it.
the only change i made was to cut back on the salt, by about half. i had it with mashed potatoes and a spinach, water melon salad, from this site. made a great meal. will make again.

Very good.  Husband especially loved it!  In fact he wants this for Christmas dinner instead of our usual prime rib.

Wonderful, easy recipe. Tiny bit too salty, but that can be adjusted next time. We will make it again.

Very easy  recipe to follow.  I had to improvise the onion soup mix with an Allrecipes onion soup recipe. 

The leftovers made great BBQ Brisket sandwiches. 

I will use the recipe again.
