This soup is fragrant, warming, filling, satisfying, and definitely comforting!  I love the smell and taste of cardamom.  I had to make some substitutions: sweet potatoes instead of yams, dried basil rather than fresh, and I didn't have any goat cheese or turmeric.  Oh I can just imagine how the goat cheese would enrich this dish with a creamy texture.  The drizzle of soy sauce just topped off wonderfully melded flavors.  You must try this!

Tasty,, but it did need more water to make a broth. I added some red pepper flakes because I got a very tame jalapeno

I made a half recipe, but used full spice amounts.  This is delicious! I didn't have jalapeno pepper or cinnamon stick, so I used red pepper flakes for the heat and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I was worried that the soy sauce and feta cheese wouldn't mix, but it was great!! This goes in my permanent recipe file.

This recipe is delicious and so easy to make! I'm on an allergy elimination diet so I couldn't use the coriander and I didn't have any cardamom and I used fresh ginger instead of dry but made the rest as in the recipe and it was so delicious and warming on a cold chilly day.

This is so delicious, that probably any variation is great.
It is more like a curry, needs no extra juice (see my pic), I served it over brown rice.
The reason for 4 stars, because following the cooking times, will make it seriously overcooked (but, some people like it like that), also you don't need salt if you use chicken stock, or some chicken bouillon.
I used broccoli instead of cauliflowers, for added color.

Broccoli requires no cooking, just stir it in the food, when ready, wait 5 min. and it is ready)

This recipe was extremely yummy! Very hearty & tasty while not weighing you down after eating it. Loved all the elements together. I only have two critiques. First, I halved this recipe since the number being served was only two people and 10 servings seemed a bit silly, and when I did so I noted that there didn't seem to be nearly enough liquid for the amount of vegetables in this dish. It's hard to imagine how it would be different if I'd doubled everything. Fortunately I was able to simply add more coconut milk & water to bring the ratio to a reasonable amount (and to compensate I added more spices, halved yet again). This seemed to rescue the dish quite well. So at a minimum, if you're halving the recipe be cautious and keep the ingredients on hand. 
Secondly, the name; you've got to change the name. "Allergy Friendly Comfort Soup" does NOT sound tasty. I wouldn't even tell my wife what the recipe was called because I was sure she'd ask me for something else. 
All that said, this recipe is super delish and will definitely go into our recipe box!!
