I get a lamb from a local farmer each year, so have lots of bones to make soup with.  I didn't use the ground lamb but used a lot of meaty bones and a leftover leg bone that I had frozen from a prior dinner.  I used the same basic spices and this turned out great.    What I did with the bones was to cover with water and simmer for a few hours with a large diced onion and an envelope of onion soup mix and a few bay leaves.  (I didn't have the beef consomme or even an oxo cube so thought this would add the necessary salt and flavour).  I then strained the whole thing, picked any meat off the bones and added the diced tomatoes, can of tomato soup and chili powder and doubled the barely called for.  Turned on a very low simmer for a few more hours, got home from shopping and added a couple of handfuls of frozen mixed vegetables and some fresh celery and in about a half hour sat down to a very lovely soup for lunch.  I also got several containers for the freezer.  Thanks for the great ideas.  Wouldn't have thought to mix the chili powder in this soup.  I think it made for a nice little added zing.

very good..however i did change a few things i had three lamb chops from a leg os lamb so i cubed it up and 1lbs of groung turky threw the meat and onion in a skillet and cooked until just browned....meanwhile in crock pot turned on to high i added half a big can of diced tomatoes and the tomato soup the recipe calls for i used 3 beef boullion cubes and about a tsp each of rosemary and thyme also added the meat and some mushrooms to the crock pot of course i followed the rest of the ingredients in the recipe like chile powder and barley..and whatever else that was in there...cooked half the day made some dinner rolls from this site..sprinkled a little swiss cheese over bowls..(so kids would try it) very yummy husbands only complaint was that it needed fresh japs but he loves everything spicey....o i did add a little more water to the recipe since it was in the crock pot but it came out very chunky and hearty...perfect for the cold day we had yesterday.....worth trying and if nothing else a great base to add to and take away from for barley stews...thanks for the recipe.....this is the first time i actaully got my hubby to eat barley!!! yippie!! i love barley

Very, very tasty...my family couldn't stop eating it!  I substituted the ground lamb for ground turkey, though.

I needed to bring something to a family who needed comfort food.  This was great. I added a bay leaf while cooking and actually used 2 pounds of lamb to make it more stew like.  I also did not drain the diced tomatoes which added a little more flavor.  Great recipe!

I make this recipe all the time, it's very flexible and you can add any veggies you like, I like to throw in green beans and mushrooms in addition to the carrots, onion and celery. The broth is great, and I just usually use beef broth instead of the consomme. Sometimes I also use diced beef stew meat and simmer for a while until tender.

mmmmm mmmmm good!! i can understand why there is no salt in this recipe. IT DOESNT NEED IT!!delicious. i had ground lamb, and ahve never eaten it, much less cooked it. we found exactly one pound for sale one day, and decided to buy it. i didnt know what to do with it and i looked on here. the first thing that popped up (after you click on rating) was this. not one person, including me has rated this less than 5 stars. i just realized we had barley the other day in our cabinet, and had also never cooked THAT before (gimme a break. im a fairly new cook) and gave it a try, especially bcuz of the impossibility that anyone was able to rate it less than 5. glad i tried this. i made this on christmas and thought i had all the ingredients, and looked back at the recipe and realized it said one 28 OZ, when i thought it was just a regular can, and everythings closed so i had to use just one and a can on tomato paste, but everything else i left alone. oh, and it said in your description you could/should add any other veggies so i used everything here and a little fresh broccoli as well. WOW! thats very rare that every single person that rates, esPECially on this website, gives something 5 stars. idk why more ppl havent tried. it is SO GOOD!!!!

I had a left-over leg of lamb and a lamb shank. Cut the meat off bones into small pieces. Followed the recipe but found it to be too acidic, so I added 2 tbs of sugar, 1 cup of grated cheese, herbes du provence/parsely, and 2 pinches of baking soda. Lovely! Found it to be very comforting.....

Found this recipe while looking for recipes to use our ground lamb. My husband likes a lot of variety in our menus, but this is one dish he asks for often. So easy to make. I also use 2 pounds of lamb. We like to eat with sour dough bread. This recipe is at the top of our favorites!

Awsome! I am usually not a fan of soup too much but decided to try this cause of the barley benefits and wow! Great as a base soup to add to! I added  alittle more barley and did not drain the tomatos and left out the carrots...i will add them next time though and maybe some mushrooms too!

Outstanding!  Tried it tonight with very lean ground lamb exactly as printed, and everybody loved it.  Very rare that all the members of my family fall in love with a dish and ask to have it again while they go back for seconds!

Made 'Lamb Feta Peppers' (WOW) with 1/2 lb of ground lamb so thought i would try this with the 1/2 lb i had left.  Didn't have the lamb flavor i was hoping for.  It is really good but i will use a whole lb next time.

won a local cooking contest with this recipe with a few tweaks.  i doubled the ground lamb, added a can of stewed tomatoes drained and chopped, added 8 oz chopped baby portabellas, one more can of tomato soup, one more can of consomme, upped the barley to 2/3 cup and at the end added some chopped up curly kale

I used ground meatloaf mixed meat instead of ground lamb simply because lamb was $10 more!! It was a great substitute affording a good hearty flavor. As another option, I would use lamb chunks for a nice stew :)

Wow!  Easy, and delicious!  We had leftover lamb from roast.  I cut it up into little chunks.  I didn't change a thing from the original recipes...and my husband and my 5 year old daughter loved it.  I loved it too!  There was plenty left, so we froze some.  Perfect for a cold winter day.  Thanks for this one!

Made this recipe or 48 last evening for church dinner...the taste was "tangy tomato" and otherwise bland. Added parmesan cheese, sugar and half & half to cut the tanginess and make a bit creamy....it wasa HIT and no one was the wiser!   Cale

Didn't have any barley. It was lentils, so I tried it with them. Omitted carrots. We loved it! One of the best lamb recipes I have eaten because I' m not a big lamb fan. Will make again using barley because I know it will definitely be a keeper!

Used one pound of ground sirloin and one pound ground lamb.  Omitted the beans as they don't agree with my digestion.   Family loved it so much, that I have made it twice in a month.

So so so good.  Used 4 short beef ribs w/2 lbs of lamb shoulder.  Forgot the tomato soup & used beef base for the broth-making 4 quarts of broth.  Used 2 whole onions-about 4 stalks of celery-& the diced canned tomatoes.  Used quick cooking barley(the whole box) & it made it like a stew-just what I wanted.  Am adding mushrooms after the kids eat it.  Just exactly what I was looking for-delicious & easy!

Yummy if you're a lamb lover!!  I used chunks of lamb left over from a cooked roast. I also added a few string beans and garlic. The chili powder added the right amount of spice for us.... if you don't like heat add less chili powder. This recipe has been added to my keeper recipe book!

Fabulous recipe as written. After we all ate the soup I added another pound of browned lamb, puree'd tomatoes and beef stock to make it more of a stew. Just stretching it a bit more and changing it up for the next night. My children say it's one of their favorites :-)

I substituted the canned soups with low salt stock cubes, and  a small carton (approx. 6 ounces) of tomato paste,  and made up the volume of liquid with water; otherwise made it as per recipe. My family and I thought it was delicious! Will be making this on a regular basis in the future!

This was absolutely delectable with leftover lamb from our whole lamb roast.  My husband seasoned the lamb before we slow cooked it in a pit.  I'm not sure what seasoning he used but it was even better in this.
