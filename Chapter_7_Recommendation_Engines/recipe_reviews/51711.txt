Great recipe. Enough for 6-8.  I saved time by microwaving the potatoes. Browned them in the pan AFTER pouring out excess bacon grease. Added a tablespoon of garlic with the vegetables (you can never have enough garlic!). After adding the bacon to the cooked vegetables, I poured eight beaten eggs over the top, covered and cooked on medium-low about 10 minutes until almost firm. Then I topped with sliced tomatoes and grated cheese, and continued to cook, uncovered, until the cheese was melted. Had enough leftovers to serve the next day rolled up in flour tortillas!

In my family we call this farmer's breakfast.  We skip the cheese, however and just pour scrambled eggs right over the vegetable/bacon mix and cook them in the same pan.  You can cook the veggies ahead and when your brunch guests arrive, just heat them a little and add the eggs to cook.  Just one skillet to clean, yum!

This is a great Sunday morning breakfast.  It doesn't cook fast, so not good for the weekdays.  I figure it is one of those kitchen sink dishes as you can thrown in just about anything you would eat with eggs.  I didn't have peppers on hand, so left them out, used cheddar rather than american cheese.  But you don't really have to make anything else with this meal.  I did adjust the amount for only 2 people.  Also, I didn't read the recipe correctly and didn't boil the potatoes before putting in the skillet.  That may but it still only took my a little over an hour to make.

I've made something similar to this forever for a quick evening meal.  However, I use frozen hash browns instead of fresh potatoes and when I'm ready to cook the eggs I make indentations in the potatoes and drop the eggs in them, sprinkle all over with shredded cheddar, cover and cook on medium low heat till done.  Yummy!

and went with shredded potatoes instead of cubed.

Wonderful recipe.  Used frozen diced potatos that I thawed in the fridge the day before to cut down on cooking time.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent!!! Its Sunday morning and I'm in no mood to boil the potatoes so I cooked them in the mircowave before adding them to the skillet.  I also added some chopped broccoli. I choose to scramble the eggs because they were the easiest to make.  But basically followed the recipe to the letter.  This was a hearty brunch indeed, swallowed down by a glass of mimosa and a side of cinnamon rolls and it was a great way to start the day!! Thanks Jay!!

I also made this dish for dinner.  While it certainly was comfy breakfast fare and super simple to make, it needed some "spice" to perk up the flavors a bit.  I added garlic and onion powder, and used a sharp cheddar cheese in place of the American cheese.  My husband added quite a bit of a spicy ketchup to his portion.  Thanks for the recipe, Jay.

I loved this. It was so tasty. I peeled 7 Medium russet potatoes and placed them a bowl with enough water to just cover the bottom of the bowl. Covered with a paper towel and cooked for 4 mins. I then cubed potatoes and added papirika, salt and pepper to taste. I fried them in my skillet for approx. 3 mins then added crumbled sausage and cooked them with the potatoes. I drained the excess oil. For quickness I also used frozen stir fry green, red peppers with onions. I added these to my skillet with the potatoes and sausage about 5 minutes prior to serving. My cooking and prep time was less than 20 mins. I added scrambled eggs (which I made in a seperate skillet) and Mexican shredded cheese on top. My husband likes spicy and added hot sauce and jalepeno's on top of his, while my kids use ketchup on everything this was no exception even though it didn't need it. I did make alot of changes but this recipe was a great base and it turned out excellent.

Great for big breakfast.  My boyfriend loved it.  I used chicken breakfast sausages instead to bacon and it was really good.

Delicious!  Definitely hearty.  Although it does take a while to make, a lot of it you don't have to pay close attention to (like boiling the potatoes) so it's pretty easy to cook.  I made it for dinner, but I think because it is so solid it would be best for breakfast or brunch ( so you have lots of daylight hours to burn off all the calories!)  Next time I might use a bit less cheese since I don't think it would alter the flavor much but would cut down on the fat/calories.

I love an old fashioned bacon, eggs(omelet), hash brown style breakfast, but they can get boring on their own.  This is a great way to mix it all up without having to go out to a restaurant.  I made this very easy by adding mushrooms to frozen potatoes O'Brien and frying in the skillet.  You can make your own potatoes O'Brien using the recipe for "Striker's Potatoes O'Brien" from the allrecipes site.  Serve up with a side of salsa and you will have one hearty, tasty breakfast!  Or in my case, breakfast for dinner. :)

A very hearty meal that we all enjoyed. I didn't change a thing. Well, other than the fact that I didn't have any red peppers and I used yellow instead. I'll definitely make this again!

I was excited to try this recipe after my family raved about the frozen Bob Evans breakfast skillet mix, which was surprisingly good.  This recipe was every bit as good.

I made a few changes based on what was in my pantry: used lean ham instead of bacon.  Next time, I'd use the bacon or crumbled sausage since the ham didn't give as much flavor.  Used grated sharp cheddar instead of American cheese: used only enough to cover the top at the very end (opposed to mixing it in), which allowed me to reduce the fat/calories. 

I also adjusted the cooking instructions based on other reviews.  Microwaved diced potatoes in glass cake pan for 11 minutes.  Sauteed veggies slightly while potatoes cooked, then added potatoes and cooked all until potatoes browned.  Pushed potato mixture to side of pan and scrambled eggs in the other side of pan (so only one pan needed).  When the eggs were done, I mixed it all together and put the cheese on top.  Covered w/ lid so that the heat melted the cheese.  

Great recipe!  Thanks for a quick, satisfying recipe! My kids have requested that we have this for dinner twice a month.

I got as far as browning the potatoes.  It all went into a mush at the bottom of the pan, and my potatoes were only par cooked!  Half an hour later I gave up and added the rest of the stuff.  Gotta say, it was still tasty, it just looked kinda icky.

unless i did something realllll wrong, this was a really ugly dish.
it was, however extremely GOOD!
i dont see any reason to hide it in breakfast foods, just because it s ugly.
i will have it again for a casserole at supper time. i think in a casserole dish it would be more presentable.

This was a very tasty treat.  It was time consuming but definitely worth it.  My fiance says there's never a need to go out for breakfast again because this skillet was just as good (if not better) than a breakfast at a restaurant.  I drained most of the bacon grease so the food was not as greasy as it would have been at a restaurant and he liked it much more saying that you could taste more of the actual food instead of just the grease.  He also said it reminded him of one of his favorite meals at our favorite diner in Chicago, "The Melrose" on Broadway and Melrose!

Very good!  I did green and yellow bell pepper and used sharp grated shredded cheese.  Instead of using an extra pot to boil the potatoes, I cut them into super small cubes and just fried them until done in the same pan as the bacon.  Did my eggs over easy.  Delicious!!!

This was really good and we will make it again. The only issue I had was that my potatoes ended up as mush. Next time I will steam them in a pan with the lid on for 10 minutes, and then continue as shown in this recipe.

My group of cooking friends at OutTableTalk dot com chose this as our cook along recipe for the month of March.  No one can ever say this isn't a filling, hearty and flavorful breakfast.  It is all of that.  Honestly not unique as the recipe is written, but if you like all the ingredients it's very well worth making for your family breakfast.  So many ways to change it up too.  A very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Hearty & filling!!  Like other reviewers have said, this recipe does take awhile to cook (it took me over an hour).  The potatoes are the most time consuming part of the recipe.  I also used cheddar instead of american cheese & served the meal with toast.  YUMMY!!

I have been making this for years. It's called hopple popple, a German breakfast concoction.  It's great with bacon, but you can use any leftover meat like sausage, ham and especially Polish sausage.  A great use of leftover baked potatoes.- kylefan44

This was pretty good and everyone ate it but there weren't any rave reviews either. I added garlic and onion powders and used pepper jack cheese instead of American. Certainly budget friendly and it makes a nice hearty dinner too. Thank you!

This is fantastic. I boiled the potatos in the microwave to save time and I added fresh garlic, chopped jalapenos and green chiles for extra kick. We like things spicy in this house. We fried the eggs in the bacon grease and topped the 'hash' with them. Just as good, if not better than any greasy spoon out there. YUM!

Yay Jay!  This was fabulous.  All I had was red onions and feta cheese and this was a great alternative.  Can't wait to make it with the cheddar cheese.

My boyfriend and I make this recipe about once a week  (so yes we love it!). Save yourself some time though and buy the frozen packaged diced potatoes. Great with some salsa to top it off!

cut down the recipe for just two of us (which was more than enough) and based on the reviews, i was surprised at how quick it took to make...though i had help with the chopping. tasted great.

Our family calls this "South Dakota Breakfast". Everything but the kitchen sink goes in. It's especially good the last morning when camping, to use up all the leftovers. Love this breakfast! Reminds me of my childhood, going to South Dakota to visit my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.

I halved the recipe because I only had 4 eggs and it was plenty for 4 people.  Used hash browns to save on cooking time like several others and used italian sausage instead of bacon.  What fun to experiment with the variety of ingredients that could be used in this fun and hearty breakfast. I put the eggs on top of the whole 'mess' and covered the skillet.  The eggs turned out sunnyside up and the presentation was restaurant-worthy.  I agree with other reviewers who used cheddar cheese rather than American.  Yummy!

I thought this was good and hearty. I changed it some to make it healthier or lower in cholesterol. I boiled the cubed potatoes and set them aside. For the half pound of bacon, I used 1/4 cup of real bacon bits in a spoon of olive oil. I crisped them then added the poatoes. After the potatoes were briefly heated I removed them and cooked one red and one orange pepper and a yellow onion in a small amount of olive oil. Once tender I added a drained can of mushrooms. Then heated further before sprinkling on just 1/4 cuo of cheese approximately.  I seasoned the potato skillet with a little garlic salt, seasoning salt, and black pepper. I am not sure why the eggs are included in the recipe, as that is just based on the amount desired. Only problem with the recipe, for the most part, is the time involved. I made this on a weekend. Ty

This is fabulous! Since it is a "skillet" and not a "scramble" I opted to follow the recipe as stated and I made fried eggs, over medium for me and over medium well for hubby. It was gorgeous plated and oh so yummy! 5 stars! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great dish! I needed a quick meal for dinner, and came across this one...it was a hit! My husband bought me a cool chopper/dicer, which I used on the potatoes. I cooked the potatoes in olive oil, rather than boil them. When the potatoes were half way done, I added the peppers and onions(I omitted mushrooms, due to picky kiddos). Once the potatoes were done, I took them out of the pan, so I could scramble the eggs. I seasoned the eggs with garlic powder, sea salt & pepper. Once the eggs were done, I added the potato mixture to the eggs. I cooked just a bit longer. I topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I also substituted ham for the bacon. Any type of breakfast meat would be great in this dish. Next time, I plan to add fresh roasted green chile. Thanks for sharing!

I love big Sunday breakfasts. This is always a winner. I didn't use mushrooms [this time] I used frozen diced potatoes, bacon, sausage, green pepper, onion, a sprinkling of grated chedder chesse over the potatoes, two lg. eggs over easy, and season salt and pepper. Yum!

Very tasty and easy to make. I set up the serving for three (2 adults and two children) and still had enough for one more adult, or two.  I added the garlic as recommended and I included an orange pepper.  I will make this again.

I would definitely save this recipe for a weekend when you have some time, because it does take a while to make, but is so worth it. I added some garlic to the recipe, but other than that, wouldn't change a thing. Reminded me of one of those breakfast platters at Denny's only MUCH better! Yummy!!!

This is SO good.  However, be forwarned: the potatoes can take a while to make.  I've made this a few time, and it took 2 hours each time for everything to be done!  So... instead of breakfast, we've had it for brunch.  The mushrooms give it a GREAT touch.  It sure is filling!

My husband loved this skillet breakfast.  Since we moved from the Chicago area to SW Florida, we have been unable to find a good skillet breakfast like those served up north.  I used chopped leftover ham instead of bacon.  I also precooked the potatoes in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  I added a jalapeño pepper for a bit of heat.  Otherwise I followed the recipe closely and was very pleased with the results!  Thank you!

Will make again! It was rich with the bacon grease.
Will decrease grease next time. Didn't have bell peppers or mushrooms.substitute zucchini and shredded taco cheese that was what I had in hand. Still rated 5! Thanks! Very Good!

Don't boil potatoes 1st. Stupid. They get too mushy even though I took them out early. Potatoes stuck to bottom of skillet never browning and making a larger and larger pile of burnt potato in the bottom. Wasted a lot of time making a not so good breakfast with this.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  Soooo tasty!  The only think I did differently was I made grated hashbrowns and cooked them with the onions and peppers.  I probably used more oil than the recipe called for to keep them from sticking.

We liked this skillet breakfast but, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the texture.  The directions have you crisp up the potatoes in a skillet, only to add cheese (mixed through) which causes the crispy potatoes to turn mushy.  The next time I make this, I won't mix in the cheese until melted, I think it would be better to just melt the cheese on top to reserve the crispiness of the potatoes.  Otherwise, the flavors are good.  I served eggs-over-hard on top.

Fantastic! Although I would suggest two tips when making it just from my experience now: 1) pay attention when they say to only boil the potatoes until slightly tender but still firm...I would even go so far as to say it's better to leave them a little uncooked because they will have a chance to finish cooking later in the skillet with the other veggies, I ended up with mushy potatoes because I boiled them too long. 2) add 3 or 4 cut up mild or spicy Italian sausages in with the bacon, it makes it a bit meatier and tastes delish. Overall though, I would definitely make this again!!

I did a little adjusting but it was great! I scrambled my eggs and mixed them in, I added breakfast sausage links from my butcher (along with bacon), and while frying it all up, sprinkled cayenne pepper and chili powder for a Tex Mex flavor. Thanks for this recipe!

Pretty good, but next time, I will make the following changes-- I will not boil the potatoes first. Raw potatoes seem to crisp up better. I will also sauté the veggies in a different pan, then add them before serving. Onions, mushrooms and peppers have a lot of moisture, and that makes for soggy mushy potatoes.

I really enjoyed this big breakfast for a lazy Sunday!  It was tasty and comforting in this cold weather.  I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of American cheese though.

I made this recipe this morning. Yummy!!!! I didn't add mushrooms because I don't care for them. I used the Kraft four cheeses because that's all I had, other than that, I didn't change the recipe.

Great recipe as written however, some other great veggies to try that I didn't see anyone mention; summer squash, i.e. zucchini & yellow squash diced; broccoli slaw; kale. I use any of these that I have on hand in either this dish or 'loaded scrambled eggs'.

I have made a similar breakfast for many years except that I whisk the eggs as if to make scrambled eggs then add them to the potatoes mixture in the skillet cover and cook on low till the eggs are almost done then add the cheese of choice and cook covered till the cheese has melted and the eggs are done.

This is a dish that my mom made for me when I was little, and I now make it for my family. Because I'm from the south, we smother our potatoes. Cook your bacon or sausage first, set aside and reserve some of the oil to cook your veggies in. Cube potatoes, place them in a cast iron skillet with 2-3 tbsp of the meat grease & your veggies. Start on med-hi heat. Toss veggies to coat with grease, salt and pepper to taste. Cover the skillet with a lid, & turn your heat to med-lo. Turn occasionally to prevent sticking. In about 15-20 minutes, your potatoes should be nice and tender. Place them on a baking sheet. Now make your eggs to your liking. Place your eggs on top of the veggies, add crumbled bacon & shredded cheese. Slide it in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese, & that's it. All in all, this meal should only take 30-45 mins to make.

Loved this recipe, it is a keeper! I made just a couple of changes. I used sausage instead of bacon. I sauteed my veggies at the same time I cooked my sausage so they would be more tender. I also added a little of minced garlic to the skillet. We will be having this again and again.

I haven't tried this exact recipe yet, but I will be. I'm giving it 5 stars because it looks awesome and all other skillets I've tried have been great. I'll be making this for my family and I'm just gonna top it off with some sour cream!

It will help your potatoes if you microwave them first. While they are cooking I cook the onions, mushrooms peppers after they are cooked set aside. The potatoes will now brown nicely. Than finish the recipe.

This was VERY GOOD.  I used mild sausage instead of bacon (I don't like bacon) and just added beaten eggs with minced garlic at the end instead of cooking them first.  Took the advise of microing the potatoes instead of boiling, they turned out great  Had it for dinner, might try it for breakfast some time :)

We make a batch of this on Sunday morning and use it as a filling for breakfast tacos throughout the week. Needs salt &  pepper though. Yummy.

Fantastic! My boyfriend says this is as good as our favorite breakfast restaurant. The great thing about the recipe is that you can substitute nearly anything for the suggested ingredients, as long as the potatoes, cheese and eggs stay the same. We've used breakfast sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and spinach.

Had something similar at a restaurant. Veggies used were mushrooms and spinach. after preparing the potato mixture top it with gravy and over easy eggs (or however you like them). Delicious!

Was very tasty, and easy to pull together!  I will likely shorten the cook time on the potatoes as they were only in there for the shortest suggested time and they were a bit too mushy!

Very Yummy!! This is simple and tastes great. If you love a big hearty breakfast then this is it. I'm not really a breakfast person,so I do prefer it as an evening meal. But I do make this for the family on weekends. I prefer to make breakfast tacos out of the mixture. Mix some scrabbled eggs into the skillet, place in warm tortillas and add some salsa. Better the the Jimmy Dean's frozen in the bag.

Wow just made this for breakfast and it was fantastic.  I cut the recipe down because I was only making it for 2.  I took the easy route and nuked the potatoes instead of boiling.  I used a jalapeno monterey jack cheese that I happened to have in the fridge, and also used seasoned salt instead of regular and added a bit of garlic, and topped it with a couple fried eggs. I wouldn't change a thing it was amazing.  My husband went nuts for it!!

In this recipe I used Turkey Bacon instead of regular bacon, I found for us that about 8 slices is a good amount. For the potatoes I kept the skin on and steamed them in the microwave for about 10 minutes instead of boiling them. When frying the potatoes I used about 1 tablespoon of canola oil in the pan. ( I fried the turkey bacon in a griddle separate than the frying pan). For the eggs I used 4 eggs and 8 egg whites (16 tablespoons). I served this with toast.
