The recipe looked easy and delish and I had all the ingredients but I never expected the potatoes (after 60 mins at 375F) would be absolutely swimming in a cream bath!  
The author(s) have a responsibility to check their submissions for missing ingredients before they post!  Not creamy just incredibly soupy...which means all that wonderful cheese was wasted.  Never again!

The prep time is closer to 30 minutes. The foiled lined tray was unnessary. We enjoyed the Dish and would make it again

I debated if I should rate this.  I usually don’t unless I really don’t like something or I really really do.  I decided too because I have a recommendation based on my preference. The flavor is good but I suggest you skip the step of boiling the potatoes.  My family recipe is similar except that a variety of cheeses are used and no pre-boiling takes place.  Strangely, Parmesan was never the selected cheese.  Again no hard feelings just not first to mind.

In fairness if a dish of it were placed before, the dish would be returned empty.

I used about 1.5 cups heavy cream and a little more than 2 pounds of potatoes.  Came out great!

I didn’t have heavy cream so I substituted whole milk. It came out great and my family loved it.

It was a little more liquid than I expected but it tasted great. I may consider adding in some grated mozzarella next time. I will definitely make it again.

Doubled the recipe for Easter dinner using the adjusted calculations (x 2). I used  2 cups heavy cream &  2 of whole milk as a result so this may have altered the thickness! 
Used a 5lb. bag of potatoes, pealed to approx. 4lbs as required. I was concerned about too much liquid mix so held back approx.1/2 cup so I could add flour to make  a roux if required... it was!
After I baked  the potatoes for the 40 min., the sauce was too soupy & did not reduce!  I added approx.3 tablespoons of flour to the cold reserved liquid which made a paste/roux, then took approx. 1/2cup of the hot liquid sauce from the actual casserole, stirred in the cold roux and added it back to the casserole dish with a hand whipper to blend it throughout, then baked for another 15-20min.  This helped to thicken the scallops more!
This recipe seems to need more potatoes to match the amount of sauce so they are not too runny Or possibly use less sauce mix. Luckily, the roux worked to thicken everything up!
The family loved the flavour as did I. I will attempt to make it again in future.  Also, I think one recipe would be adequate for 6-8 servings. I had approx. half a large casserole dish left over after feeding 8 hungry people... oh well, they got to take home leftovers!

This even pleased my picky daughter.  I made it as written except for adding ~3/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese I had on hand.  I will make it again.

I halved the recipe and there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the baking dish. I will readjust the amount of cream next time. Browned perfectly and was flavorful. I will make this again.

Made these tonight and put them under the broiler for the last 5 minutes for some added crispiness! Delicious!

I added chopped ham between two layers of red potatoes, added a dash of nutmeg, added chopped onions to top layer of potatoes, and lastly, sprinkled Cyan pepper over the top layer. WOW! What a taste. A good way to use left-over Christmas ham. Try it.

Very good tasting,but I found it runny. Could be because I used milk and not cream.
