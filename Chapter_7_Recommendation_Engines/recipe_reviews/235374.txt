Made it exactly to recipe.  Served it with corn tortillas and the sauce.  Made excellent pulled pork tacos.

Outstanding.  I omitted the cayenne and hot sauce because my son doesn't care for anything too spicy, and I knew my husband would douse his serving with hot sauce regardless.  I also only added 1/2 cup of water, but still had plenty for the slow cooker.  I was a little concerned when it first started cooking, the vinegar scent was strong, but it mellowed throughout the day, and mmmmmm, the end result was delicious.  I would recommend this recipe for families like ours with varied tastes, it is a good, tasty meat and people can add more hot sauce or barbeque sauce to their own servings.

This pork turned out very tender and was easy to shred. I added about a quarter cup of bbq sauce and served mine on a soft taco shell with a spoon full of coleslaw and the sauce provided in the recipe (which my boyfriend said was amazing). Thanks for the recipe.

Seriously great recipe! I've tried many pulled pork recipes. This one is certainly unique! I strongly suggest eating this with the mayonnaise sauce. It made the sandwich! Thank you, Morgan for sharing this recipe!

I only added ½ cup of water, skipped the hot spices & mayo sauce.  I added 1 bottle of Newman’s own bbq sauce after shredding the pork.   It was delicious!

I made exactly as directed and came out perfect! I served over tortilla chips and added cheese to make pulled pork nachos. One of my favorite recipes!

03.12.17 ~ I scaled this back, just a tad, as my pork tenderloin was only  1.75#'s.  I put everything in the crockpot before going to bed and in the morning shredded it.  It was delicious.  We really enjoyed the mayonnaise sauce that accompanied it.  Next time I will up the cayenne pepper as we like the heat.  But, for the first time I wanted to make it as the recipe stated.  The leftovers of this meat was as good as the first time around.  We really enjoy shredded pork, and I will be using this recipe again.

Made exactly as recipe went. Holy moly this was delicious! I made the mistake of making tacos out of it; next time I don't want anything distracting from the meat! We left some over for  pulled pork sandwiches tomorrow, can't wait!

Simply outstanding!  I made this to recipe, and it was so good we've had it several times. I made it for a July 4th picnic with a group of friends. They lived it so much they HAD to have the recipe and they made it several times since then, too.

I made this exactly to the recipe, and the meat was dry.  The only flavor left after the cook was the mayo.  Will not be making this again.

I made this today. Added a little less red pepper to start but did it all exactly like the recipe, including that off the hook sauce!
