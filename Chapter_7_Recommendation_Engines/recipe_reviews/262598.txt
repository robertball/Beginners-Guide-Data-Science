Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I made another similar recipe to this one at the same time only the other kept the cauliflower raw. I liked this one better. I thought the steamed cauliflower absorbed the flavor better. I personally thought it could have used some heat though so next time I'll add a diced jalapeno.
