I'm enjoying playing with this sandwich (= I've had it four times in two days! Twice as written - though I don't measure the almond butter, spreading some on both slices of bread, and using ~1/4 of a peach. I also made this grilled, sprinkling a little cinnamon sugar on the outside of the sandwich, after buttering it. My favorite was open-faced, on toast, again with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top. Num!

I bought some really good almond butter at a farmers' market and wanted to use it for a healthy breakfast, and this certainly caught my eye!  I liked this but didn't think it was quite what I was hoping for (maybe my bread wasn't fresh enough or my peach sweet enough).  I thought I'd try adding a little butter or a little honey to the bread and then heating up the sandwich.  I will try this again because I love the combination of these food items.  Thanks, Alyson!
