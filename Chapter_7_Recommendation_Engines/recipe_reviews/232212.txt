These are really tasty with just a bit of a kick.   I baked them for about 15 minutes total, then turn off the oven and just let them sit in the oven to fully dry out without over browning.

Excellent. I used Cajun seasoning with fairly strong heat, and thought it might be a bit much for some guests. However, the heat tamed down a bit since made the day before serving. Added to a Caesar salad.
