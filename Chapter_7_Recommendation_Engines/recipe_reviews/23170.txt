My family and I thought this recipe was delicious. I added a little garlic but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  To eliminate extra pans, I sauteed the meat and veggies in a dutch oven on the stove and then poured the sauce over and put it in the oven. After 2 hours, the meat was very tender.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty. I was looking for a way to use up some stew beef I had in the freezer but didn't want to make that potatoes and carrots gravy type stew during the heat of summer. I followed the recipe almost to a tee except I didn't brown the meat and cooked it in the slow cooker, used sherry for half the water amount, used bottled lemon juice, and added the pineapple as other reviewers had suggested. I also added some cornstarch towards the end to thicken the sauce a bit. I will definetly make this again. But be warned these surprisingly small amounts of honey, lemon juice, mustard and ketchup do make for a subtle sweet and sour, oriental type sauce and it isn't at all what you expect for "stew". Next time I think I will dust the meat with flour or cornstarch. Yes, serve with rice, set the places with chopsticks and pass the soy sauce. Tell hubby it's "pepper steak" and forget the word "stew".

This has become a new favorite at our house. It is easy, and perfect for gloomy winter days. It's great served over steamed rice.
I usually wait to add the green pepper until near the end of cooking, to prevent it from getting too soft.

This is in the oven right now; based on the good aroma I'd say that this is going to taste like a "5".  I plan to serve it tomorrow over brown rice.  Update: I doubled the sauce ingredients and left the stew uncovered for about 20 mins - that was enough to thicken it to a very nice stew-y consistency.  Definitely a keeper recipe for stew that's a little different than the usual.

I loved the sweet and sour taste of this.  I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I substituted it for pure malt vinegar.  Next time I think I might add pieces of pineapple to this.

This is one excellent recipe.
I browned the meat and then instead of baking it, I put it into my slow cooker, and put 2 T. of instant tapioca into the sauce which then thickened as it was slow cooking.  I added the chopped green pepper about 1/2 before serving.  This way the pepper was not mush.  My husband loved this recipe, as did my elderly mother.  I served it with rice, but think it would go good with Yuca.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic, as I felt it was missing something.  The sauce was excellent and enough.  I think if you bake it, there may not be enough gravy.
It's a Keeper.

Eliminate the green pepper.  It doesn't do a thing for this recipe.

We put all the ingredients in the crock pot on low all day.  We added a shredded potatoe a bit of fresh grated ginger and a dash of cumin.  It was very delicious and easy. Will make again.

I served on rice and cooked in a crock pot.  No one in my family was too excited about this dish.  The sauce was really runny...more like a broth.  Flavor was just OK.  Won't make again.

The sauce tasted really intersting, kind of sweet and tangy.  The meat was very tender, practically melted in my mouth.

I served it over rice and enjoyed it along with my 3 kids, hubby didn't like it though I don't know why.  I didn't think it tasted like sweet and sour, it just tasted sweet to me.

I've made this recipe 2 or 3 times already.  It has a nice sweet taste.  It was great over white rice.  The first time I made it I used the pressure cooker for the meat and it was so tender it literally fell to pieces (yum!).  I'll make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  What a great pair of sweet and spicey!  I added things that I had in the house,....potatoes, zucchini and orange bell pepper instead of green.  Doubt I'll ever try another stew again.

This was great, I used vinegar instead of lemon juice. I didnt put in peppers or mustard because I dont have, or like either one of them! I did add some garlic powder. I think this recipe would be really good with broccoli in it so I will add that the next time I make it!

I was disappointed and will not make again.  This is basically a slow cooked sweet and sour dish without any asian ingredients.  I did everything as told but found it better to sprinkle chilli flakes over it when served.

Cooked this dish just as the recipe without any changes. I have to say we were very happy with it. Simply served it with  some chunky wedges of bread and butter. Lovely on a winters night.

This was much better than I thought it would be.  I especially liked the honey and lemon flavor.  I served this over brown rice, but next time I will cook 1 cup of rice in the pot since there was so much liquid.

Super easy and delicious.  I lowered the cooking temp and let it bake all afternoon.  Wonderful.
