Nothing says "comfort food" quite like mac & cheese.
This recipe was simple, has a great flavor and was enjoyed by my whole family.
I didn't have potato chips on hand so I topped it with some crushed crackers. Delicious!

This is a GREAT recipe. I'm not a very good cook but I nailed this recipe. My boyfriend LOVES it! I did do a few things differently. I used processed american cheese, added 1 chicken breast (cut into very small pieces, cooked and seasoned), almost doubled the seasonings and used ritz crackers instead of chips. I cooked the pasta all the way and only put it in the oven for 10 minutes for the cheese to melt and the crackers to brown.

I loved this recipe. I left the chips off and added a little extra Parmesan cheese for an awesome crust. I also added boneless chicken breast and shrimp, yes, at the same time. It is really delicious. 

I used boneless chicken breast that I boiled in water. Then I placed them on a cutting board and used a masher (like for potatoes) to mash and "shred" them. Set aside.

Then I used raw (uncooked) shrimp and peel them completely, including tails. Shrimp size is up to you. 

Mix in the chicken and shrimp (raw) when you combine the macaroni and cheese sauce. The shrimp will cook in the oven. Enjoy, it is an impressive meal!!

I made this exactly as posted here.  My biggest problem with this recipe is that it is bland.  I believe Mac N Cheese needs to have a sharp cheddar bite, even if it's only like Stouffers.  I would try to use all sharp cheddar, maybe add Parmesan or Asiago and lose the milk or most of it but consider using the liquid from the boiled pasta.  Lastly, the potato chip topping was good but you'd better eat all of it right out of the oven.  If you don't and then put the leftovers covered in the fridge for a day and then reheat.  I thought twice about this too when first making this recipe.  Have you ever put a potato chip in the refrigerator and eaten it the next day?  Not good.

I've tried several different mac n' cheese recipes and this one I LOVE! Three reasons: 1. It has a little zip to it with the cheyenne pepper (don't cut back on the amount - even though it seems like a lot) 2. It makes 2 9x13 pans, so I can freeze one for another night. 3. It has flavor. The only thing I did differently was add cubed up pre-cooked ham right before adding the cheese mixture. Delish!

A friend of mine made this and it's AMAZING! Since he changed a few things I'll post them here for my own notes as much as anything. I sure the original is equally as awesome.

Instead of onion powder and mustard powder I used Basil and Oregano.  I used chilli powder instead of Cayenne.  I also used Mozzarella instead of American Cheese and added about 8-12 oz of Six cheese Italian blend.

Delicious!  I used the cheese I had on hand (Italian blend plus some cheddar and american - it was tasty).  Though I forgot to add the worcestershire sauce, the cayenne pepper gave it some delicious zip.  I added crumbled crispy bacon to the topping.  It is the best mac and cheese I have ever had.

I've made the recipe "as is" and then changed it the 2nd time I made it. I would only use Sharp Cheddar now in place of the cheddar cheese. It gives more flavor, bite to the cheese. American is fine, and Parmesan adds a nice zip. The seasonings, as stated, are a MUST! Especially the mustard powder. Without the correct seasonings, this recipe would be bland...so please use the seasonings and taste as you go to see if more is required. Also, if it still turns out bland, then your seasonings are too old!! Buy new spices at least every year!

Halved the recipe to make one 9X13 in pan. Very good, but will use more cheddar than American cheese next time.

This was my first ever attempt at a homemade mac and cheese so I wasn't sure what reaction I would get from the family.  RAVE reviews from all, this will now be on a monthly rotation for sure.

The best homemade mac n cheese I have had in years!!! The only changes I made were I used velvetta instead of American and crushed Ritz crackers on top instead of potato chips.

Made this several times already, but Raves still go on!! Family LOVES this recipe!! Only change I needed to make was to eliminate the cayenne..just for the "fam's" personal preference. It's creamy & delicious as is..but I like to throw in abt. 1/3 cup of sour cream..just to creamy it up more.

This might be my new favorite macaroni and cheese recipe! I added 1/4 cup of onions to the recipe when I was melting the butter. Next time, I'll scale down the cayenne. It was so good, but a little too much.

Fantastic! We added spinach to make a bit healthier, and the kids loved it. We also did crackers instead of potato chips, and we substituted basil & oregano instead of onion power & mustard power. We'll definitely do it again!

Sooo great!  I made it last night for dinner.  My friends were minutes away from devouring the entire pan.  I added a few things here and there according to my own personal tastes.  My only question is where does the worcestershire sauce come in?  Did I miss it in the instructions?

This is great, and pretty easy.  I added a little applewood smoked gruyere and used white cheddar.  I don't think I cooked my roux long enough though.

Very good recipe.  I added bacon bits to give it a good flavor.  Also, you can use american cheese slices.  They melt up just fine as long as you melt only a few at a time.  This makes two 9x13 dishes. It feeds a ton!

Had this for dinner tonight. It's DEFINITELY a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly. It fills up a 9 x 13 pan FULL. It was SOO good and creamy. One of my daughters thought it was a bit too spicy with the cayenne but the rest of us loved it. I MAY (for my daughter) only use 1/2 the cayenne next time. Also, I won't leave it in the oven as long next time. I will pull it out after 20 mins and let it set for about 5 mins. Thanks for a YUMMY recipe! Comfort Food Heaven!

My Recipe:1/8 tea each-cayenne pepper, mustard powder, onion powder. 1 tea worcestershire(thick works too), 2 cups milk, 16 slices of american, 8 oz. medium cheddar, 2 oz. sharp cheddar, 2 tbl butter, 5-6 cups elbow, 2 1/2 tbl flour. didn't have flour so I substituted 1 with 1 1/4 tbl cornstarch. salt and pepper to taste. It was a large pot unbaked and easy to make very quick. I made in a large pot butter and flour first then milk and other seasonings, brought to simmer. Added my cheddars till melted then my slices of american (cheese food). Very good and creamy with that rich cheese color to it.

Made this recipe exactly as written.  Was delicious.  We loved the topping.  I was baking it from cold so added 20 mins on baking time. It got juat a little dry (but still delicious).  Will be making it again at 35- 45 mins.

I thought this recipe was delicious, but I do have a question. WHEN DO YOU USE THE WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE??? After I followed the recipe instructions, and was putting away the ingredients, I realized I hadn't used the Worcestershire sauce! Has anyone else noticed this. It is never mentioned in the directions. Oh well, I do have to say that everyone LOVED the topping!

I halved the recipe for just one casserole. I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar. I used 1.5 cups Panko breadcrumbs with 2 Tbsp melted butter and a bit of season salt for the topping. These were all changes because of missing ingredients. The only minor issue I had was that the sauce didn't thicken in the 10 mins. I ended up having to increase the heat back to med-low for about 3 more minutes. The result was delicious. I loved the slight kick. Husband loved it and said it was better than his mother's recipe.

Sounds fantastic,but, unfortunately it is not in the heart healthy category! There must be lots of alternatives that taste just as good without all the fat? Keep up the good work!

The flavor was good but mine turned out a little bit too dry. I made this last night but after reading reviews & other recipes I did make just a few changes. I do not like American cheese so I used all cheddar and Colby cheese. I replaced like amount of milk with 1 can of evaporated milk and added a little garlic powder and doubled the mustard powder or to taste. I read another recipe where they incorporated a beaten egg into 1 cup of the sauce mix when it was done cooking and then incorporated that mixture back into the entire pan of sauce. Mine was done at about 20 minutes. The potato chip and cheese topping was the bomb!

It's in the oven now, looks and smells delicious. My only problem is, the recipe calls for Worcestershire sauce......but it's not in the directions at all....?

I was so afraid this would be bland like other recipes I've tried, but it was quite tangy, dare I even say spicy! If I make it again, I will cut slightly back on the cayenne pepper. I used Ritz crackers becuase that's what my daddy used to use!

I've made this several times and everyone loves it, especially for pot lucks and parties!  I do however mix up the cheese- always using sharp cheddar and one other kind of melty goodness like gruyere, or gouda.  I'm not a fan of American cheese- but I follow the rest to the plan most of the time.  Occasionally I will add cubed pancetta cooked crispy, and fresh jalapenos minced in the food processor- that's an extra tasty surprise.  This is a fool proof recipe- for sure, so thank you for that!

I made this recipe, it was great. I used plain bread crumbs instead of the chips. also instead of cooking it in the oven I cooked it in my traeger grill and it came out great. next time I think I may use both milk and cream instead of all milk.

It turns out I didn't have any Worcester sauce or mustard powder so those were omitted. I also replaced the chips with bread crumbs and sprinkled cayenne on the top. Very creamy and had a nice kick to it. It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! I predict I'll be using this recipe for many years to come!

This was really yummy it makes a lot so we put some in a different container and put it in the freezer. I used Panko bread crumbs instead of chips for the top. I think next time I would add cut up cooked bacon the next time. But it was very tasty it doesn't need it.

I made this recipe exactly as it is.  PERFECT!  The mac to cheese ratio is just right.  There is no need to add much salt if you top with the potato chip & cheese mixture.  This was a big hit with my entire family, which includes 3 teenaged boys. My family likes spicy food, so I will add diced jalapenos to one of the pans, just to kick it up a notch, but I will leave one pan with the original recipe.  Thanks for sharing such a hearty, yummy treat!

First time making Mac and cheese as I grew up not liking it. Cut back on cayenne pepper and used a cheddar , Colby and Monterey Jack mix. Also used 1/2 ritz/pantko bread crumb mixture with some fresh parmigiana and smoked paprika. 2 helpings :)

This was super Yummy! Very creamy with good seasoning! I didn't have the Mustard Powder but that was okay because it came out great anyways! Instead of the crushed chips I got a loaf of Italian bread and cut that into bite size pieces. I cooked the Macaroni in the oven without the bread on top for 10 minutes than I took it out and put the bread on top and cooked it for 10-15 minutes. I took it out once I saw the cheese bubbling. My husband and I really loved it!!!

I liked the dry mustard & spices, but Worcestershire sauce has a sweet flavor that I didn't care for.  Sorry, but this was neither old fashioned or anything I'd make again.

Made this last night and it turned out great. I did not put the potato chips on though, instead I used buttered bread crumbs.
and for the person who said it did not list worchestershire sauce, read the ingredients again, and you will find where it says 
"1 Tblsp worchestersire sauce"

I didn't want that many servings, and didn't enjoy halving the recipe. I must have kept the roux on too low of heat, because it didn't fully turn brown, and I never got the milk sauce to thicken properly. I used medium and sharp cheddar, and I can see why it'd be helpful to have some smoother American cheese for at least a portion of the cheese.

It’s not a gooey type of Mac and cheese. And the potato chips are really not necessary. Good crunch.

I made two different trays with this recipe. Tray 1 had ham and peas, coated in ketchup potato chips, and Tray 2 had cherry tomatoes (cut) , and broccoli, with a bacon and bread crumb topping. I cooked the bacon in cut up pieces, drained most of the grease, and then poured a cup of bread crumbs into the pan with the bacon and toasted the crumbs before adding to the dish. Loved both versions. I love this cheese sauce.. it's going to be my GO TO

Yes it makes a lot. The only change I made was using Velveeta instead of American cheese because I already had it on hand. I hope it freezes well.

A great recipe and easy to make. I made this double batch for the office Christmas party, kept one for the kids. There wasn't a scrap left behind. I didn't have shredded American and just used whole slices in there. They melted and blended very easily.

I don’t know whether I used too much Pam but I used panko crumbs instead of chips and the topping was a bit hard and crusty.

Use sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream. 
 Cream cheese also added will add a thick, rich, creamy texture.

Cut in half because 2 pans is way too much! came out a little dry but was still very good. Will make again. Used 1 # macaroni could have used a little less maybe.

Gooey and delicious!!! The only thing I would recommend after making this is, if you have a low spice intolerance you might find it helpful to reduce the amount of cayenne pepper you use. Instead of a tablespoon we used a pinch the second time we made this dish. It still kept the flavour the cayenne adds to the dish but, the flavour is not as bold. My family and I enjoyed it thoroughly aside from that. It is also very simple to make. I would really recommend this dish for any fans of cheese!

It was great! I made two pans of this and the only deviation is that in the second pan I added 2 chopped jalapeños to the mix to make a spicy one! Both were delish!!!

FAMILY FAVORITE FOR SURE!  I left out the Worcy Sauce, and used 1 can evaporated milk plus 2 1/2 cups regular milk instead.  Also only put chips and Parm Cheese atop.

this recipe was simple and really good. The first time I did substituted 8oz of American for pepper jack and liked the heat. last time I made it I diced jalapeños and made bacon and crumbled it and folded both in the the pasta and for the topping I used kettle cooked jalapeños chips with the cheddar and parmesan. it was a thanksgiving favorite!

Delicious. Use a good quality cheddar. The quantity was too much for my family of 4, and I only made half recipe. Next time I’ll make 1/4. I recommend it.

Very good, for adults but picky kids probably would not like this dish because there are  too many flavors.  If I made this for kids I would put in ¼ of the  Worcestershire sauce because it can overwhelm, and red pepper too spicy, OR eliminate it all together, onion powder was fine, nice and creamy until it begins to cool off, but that was expected. We enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I changed was the topping. I didn't do the chips, just Ritz crackers and parm, mixed with a little butter. Make sure to use a good extra sharp white cheddar to really enhance the taste.

I really liked this. I made a few small changes (I was out of some ingredients) but the outcome worked just fine. I got rid of a small block of velveeta (it was sitting in the fridge for too ling), and topped it with cheddar instead of chips (none on hand). I halved the recipe. I thought it was slightly dry, so I will increase the sauce by 50% next time. it reheated very well and was perfect for adding to our other meals throughout the week. it was a bit time consuming to make because of the constant stirring. I will be making this again. thanks for sharing!

This was a HUGE hit at recent family get together.  Made it without topping, though, due to some picky eaters who like their mac-n-cheese "plain".  Was great without.

The change that I made were that I used instead Roth's Mac n Cheese shredded blend (Grand Cru, Havarti, and cheddar) and 365 Golden Rounds instead of potato chips. It was delicious.

Used old white Cheddar for the cheddar cheese and medium cheddar instead of the American.  Doubles the recipe for the topping and used Panko instead of potato chips.  My kids and husband loved it and we're talking about how great it was the whole next day too!

I did 1 cup less milk, added aged white cheddar (About 3/4 cup) and added 1 small can of mild green diced chilies and the 1 package of COOKED bacon on top. Oh and I didn't use wheat pasta... I used 3 small boxes of original Mac n cheese boxes

Just realized that personal notes are no longer supported on this website, which is a definite loss for me, since I regularly scan the ratings and usually incorporate some of the recommendations into the recipes. I guess now I'll have to use the ratings to track my tweaks...made macaroni and set aside; made roux w/3 tbspn butter and flour, added milk til desired amount/consistency; added dry mustard, cayenne pepper, basil and oregano, red pepper one time; mixed in a mix of cheeses on hand, including sharp cheddar, asiago and/or parmesan for bite; also mozzarella one time, pepper jack. Added macaroni back to saucepan and mixed into cheese sauce with big spoon. Done!

This is hearty enough for the 6 hunters at my house this past weekend. Served with crockpot barbecued chicken. Added ground leftover turkey to the Mac and cheese which I knew would make for wonderful leftovers, although not much was left ,   A nice recipe indeed !!!

The only thing different I did was added cooked Applewood smoked bacon, cut up and instead of using regular cheddar cheese I went with smoked cheddar cheese. I omitted the cayenne pepper and just used regular pepper.

I threw in some cooked chicken breasts and steamed broccoli to make it more of a casserole. and by the way, it makes a ton! so it's great to freeze for later lunches!

I followed the recipe exactly, but halved it for one 9x13 casserole.  The recipe was not as creamy as I anticipated it would be.  The seasoning was good.  For my family, I will use half the amount of cayenne next time.  To add creaminess, I might add some half and half to the cheese mixture right before stirring in the macaroni.  The best part of this dish was the amazing topping.  So, yummy!  I will make this dish again, and will try some variances to achieve a creamier consistency.

There are two reasons I am rating this 4/5. First, it was a TON of work. 2nd, I'm more of a fan of the dryer mac and cheese recipes. I took it to a potluck and everyone was raving about how much they loved it, the flavor and the recipe itself is great.

Yum! Loved this dish! Skipped the potato chips and was really pleased with how it came out.

I fixed this today for a Super Bowel dish. It came out great!! I didn't have a few items so I did substitute a few. First , I recalculated for 10 people instead of 20. I did not have worchestersauce so I  left it out. I also was out of all purpose flour , but I did have a box of downy cake flour and used it instead . My cheeses were velveeta  & colby. I didn't have potato chips to crush on top , so I topped with tiny shreds of cheddar cheese. I put in a preheated oven for 30 minutes. Everyone loved it!!

The family loved it. I used about half a Mexican cheese blend and 1/2 sharp cheddar. I don't think I'd have liked it with American. But I liked the spices and flavors in this, just wish it were a little bit creamier.

This was amazing!  And so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly, however next time I'll probably put less cayenne pepper, or omit it completely.
