I've made these before with the dark chocolate and white chocolate Godiva liqueur. Very smooth and quite sweet, more like an after-dinner nightcap.

What a treat!!! This was really good, but I think the cream was too much for my taste. Next time I will not add any cream and just add the liquors over crushed ice.
