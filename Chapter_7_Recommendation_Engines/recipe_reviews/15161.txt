Maybe the previous user cooked them too long or made them to small...these are great cookies, and very easy.  My batch of 8 jars took about an hour to assemble.  Found some cute red fabric at Walmart to glue on top of the jar and put these directions on my laser printer labels: Howdy Partner.  Preheat your campfire to 350 and grease up your cornbread pan.  You're in for a real sweet treat!  Dump this jar into the biggest bowl ya got and mix it around real good.   Add a stick of melted butter and whipped up egg.  (A teaspoon of vanilla if you got some in the chuck wagon.)  Mix with your five cleanest fingers till it looks like cookie dough ought to.  Bake for 11-13 minutes.  Makes 18 big 'ol cookies, or 2 dozen cowgirl-sized.

This was a really great recipe. I changed the arrangement of the ingredients putting the flour on bottom, then the oatmeal, brown sugar, white sugar, nuts (I used walnuts) and chocolate chips.  This kept the flour from spilling into the nuts and chocolate chips.  I was unable to use all of the chocolate chips but the cookies still turned out delicious.  I used a small spice jar to press all of the layers into the jar.  Several mentioned the cookies getting hard.  If you will put a half slice of white bread (wheat may work, I've just never tried it) in the container with the cookies and put a lid on them, they will stay soft.  The bread gets hard but the cookies stay soft...very weird.  Anyway, I tied little inexpensive ornaments and ribbon around them and printed the instructions on decorative labels and put on the jars.  TOO CUTE!!!  These will make great gifts!!

These are the BEST cookies I've ever had!!!  I take them to work for birthdays and other celebrations and everyone always begs for the recipe.  Everyone who receives them as a gift begs to get them again next year :-)  One change I would make is to switch around the order they tell you to package the ingredients.  Layer the chunky items (like chips and nuts) on top of the flour/sugar etc.  Otherwise they end up covered up by settling flour and sugar.  Use a widemouth jar, and make sure you pack the ingredients TIGHT, otherwise it won't all fit.  These cookies are fabulous in every sense of the word!!!

Great idea!  I think the next time I'll put the flour, baking sode and salt on the bottom layer to keep it from filtering down through the other layers.  Do remember to PACK EACH LAYER or you'll never get it all in the jar!  Great gift idea.

Thanks

This is a great cookie! I used 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips instead of the 1 cup regular size and put them in last (on the top). Everything fit perfectly and the cookie did not lack for chips. I also bought (for $1) a weighted-bottom, cylindrical bud vase to tamp down the ingredients as I placed them in the jar. It worked great. I just have to remember not to get in a hurry with my tamping so I won't knock the glass 'tool' up against the glass jar which might cause it to break. To decorate the jar, I spray painted the lid and the rim blue. I bought some fabric that looked very cowboyish (red with guitars, hats, boots, etc.) and cut it into triangular kerchefs and tied it around the neck of the jar. I used card stock to make postcard sized tags which I put the instructions on as well as a picture of horses from my cardshop software on the other side. I punched a hole in the corner and tied it to the jar with jute (I put this on first and then the kerchef.)

I made these jar mixes to give as Christmas gifts - they are attractive to the eye *and* the cookies taste great!  As other reviews stated, I found it a little tough to fit all ingredients into the jar, so what I did was place 1/2 cup chocolate chips in midway (where the recipe says), and fit 1/2 cup (or as much as I could) at the very top.  The chips are much simpler to scrunch down than flour!

Also, I echo the sentiment regarding low-fat margarine.  Although I use it for nearly all of my cooking, I found that when I used it with these cookies they were a bit crunchier and drier than I'd prefer.

These are awesome!  I gave out several batches of these as Christmas presents, plus I have made them 4 times now for home and Christmas parties.  They were a hit everytime, and delicious!
NOTE: I did make a change in the recipe -- I wanted chewy cookies, so I added a 1/4 cup of milk and a whole stick of butter.  Also, to reduce the amount of sugar, I use half the amount of sugar and supplement with Splenda (1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 whole cup Splenda).
Turned out wonderful every time!

I gave this as gifts to sunday school teachers, ballet instructor and so on. Perfect and got rave reviews. Best to use a wide mouth jar and pack well, I used the bottom of a glass to pack it down. I will use this again next year for gifts, can't get much easier.

These were fantastic cookies!  However, I think next time I will cut the oatmeal in half.  I used quick oats which swell up faster and make the taste fuller than reg. oats.

These were the best!  I am not fond of nuts, so I substituted butterscotch chips instead.  I have been looking for years for a recipe that would produce a cookie that wouldn't go thin after baking...this was it - just right!  If you do like nuts, it might be really good as well with the cinnamon chips that Hershey makes instead of the chocolate chips, if you want to try something different.  It was a hit to everyone I gave it to and I had to provide the full recipe several times!

First of all, the mix looks beautiful in the jar. 

To the reviewers who said it didn't fit:
(1) Make sure you're firmly packing down each level as you do it to make sure there will be room in the jar. 
(2) When you're measuring your flour, don't dip your cup measure into the flour and dump it into the jar. Loosely spoon the flour into the measuring cup, level it off with a knife, then put it into the jar. I did this one 1/3-cup at a time so I could press down each level. If you're dipping your measuring cup directly into the flour you could potentially have twice the amount of flour you need, as this method packs the flour in more tightly. If you measure the flour correctly, all the ingredients should fit perfectly with not an inch to spare.

I baked the cookies myself and they burned to a crisp. I apparently have a different view of "walnut-sized." :) I tried again and kept a closer eye on the cookies, and they turned out beautifully. I'm not a big fan of oatmeal in my cookies but it's not an overwhelming taste, and I ended up liking them very much.

Awesome gift or sale idea, love it any time of year! One little tip I use: After I measure out the flour, I remove 2 tablespoons. I layer everything in the order given, because I love the balance of dark and light. When I get to the chocolate chips, I put 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder on top of them around the edges to sort of seal them off against invading white flour. You could use hot chocolate pwder, too, or if you're feeling daring, a cinnamon-spice blend! I made a chai-inspired mix once and it turned out great- if spiced chocolate is your thing!

I don't recommend.   I followed the recipe exactly, but (1) it wouldn't fit into a 1 quart jar no matter how much I compacted it, (2) the cookie mix was so dry and crumbly it was nearly impossible to make dough balls, (3) the end result wasn't anything special, just a chocolate chip & oatmeal cookie that was rather dry.

I made 14 of these jar mixes for Christmas and they were a huge hit. I made another batch yesterday at my husband's request. He couldn't wait until Christmas to have them again. I used peanut butter chips this time instead of the chocolate and he devoured them. He suggested trying cinnamon chips next time. If you are new to making jar cookie mixes, definitely layer the flour first otherwise everything else in the jar will end up covered in white powder as the flour settles. I will admit that I did not put the pecans in the jar. It was pretty tight so I just added a little more of the chocolate chips and noted on the instruction card that the cookies would be delicious with some chopped pecans, if desired...not everyone likes nuts in their cookies. (I'm not one of those people, these cookies are definitely better with the pecans!) These cookies are delicious and I will be making them again this Christmas. Definitely a keeper!

I haven't made these yet, so I cannot comment on their taste.  However, I thought it would be beneficial to note that the reason these don't fit into most people's jars would seem to be the order.  The author listed the order in reverse.  If you look at the list of ingredients imagine the jar along side.  The  salt would be at the bottom followed by the baking soda, the baking powder and then the flour... etc.

Absolutely delicious.  I did mix the white sugar with the oats so that it would fit in the jar.  I did not have a wide mouth, just reg. size.  Thanks so much for the recipe the family loved it and the cookies only lasted in the house for 2 days.

I tried this recipe again last night. I kept everything the same, but added one more egg. What a world of difference it made! My husband couldn't believe they were the same cookies. Much more moist and chewy! The cookie dough looked like dough is supposed to and stuck together so much better. I set up an assembly line to make alot of mixes. I just dumped everything into a 1 quart bag without packing anything down or putting it in any order to make it look pretty. Got about 20 done in under an hour. Once I get the cow-print bags made up, I'll post a picture on here of the finished product.

My mom used to make a cookie like this, but she lost the recipe, so I tweaked this a bit to taste just like Mom's!  The first time I made them, they are a little bland just going by the recipe, and I used substitute egg instead of real egg.  The second time, I added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, used 1 real egg with an extra dash of substitute egg (to make the dough less dry due to the extra brn sugar), and an extra splash of vanilla.  They were sooo good!  Nice and sweet, and just chewy enough.  To anyone who didn't like the cookie when making them according to the recipe, I recommend the changes above.

EDIT* I just put a jar of this mix together and everything fit perfectly! I used the back of a large stirring spoon to pack everything down*EDIT
This was amazing! I tried out this recipe yesterday and I'll definitely be putting it in jars for Christmas gifts in the next few weeks. I took out the walnuts and only had about 3/4 c of mini chocolate chips on hand but that seemed to be plenty. I also had trouble with the dough being too dry so I added a 2nd egg and cooked them for about 8-10 minutes and they were perfect! Husband I can't stop eating them! Thanks for this awesome recipe, besides the extra egg and a shorter cook time I wouldn't change a thing!

Gosh these were the cutest presentation.  Based on the ingredients and the reviews, I trust they are good.  I didn't actually bake them.  I used all my ingredients for 12 jars but I think they will be fine.  I was anticipating it not all fitting, so I only had just enough nuts & chips for 1/4c of nuts and about 3/4 cups of chips for each.  However I must have really compressed it good, because I could have fit more if I would have had it.  I used a water bottle to help pack it down, then I would give gentle shakes to help level it out in between layers.  These look great.  I have yet to decorate them and hang the instructions but just looking at them assembled in the jar makes me warm and fuzzy.  Quick Update - I had one jar left over and I finally had a chance to bake them.  Two Words... A - MAZING!!

Since I was giving this as a gift to school teachers and was concerned about the nuts, I substituted dried cranberries and the combo of choc chips, cranberries and oats is fabulous especially for Christmas gifts!  My boys who are autistic, painted the jars with snowmen (thumbprints).

I reviewed this recipe the first time on November 9th.
I want to update my rating to the Cowboy Cookies in a jar.
I experimented with the recipe and jar and came up with the perfect order for me in order to fit everything in one jar. Flour, spices,white sugar, brown sugar, choc chips oats and nuts. I found that just overnight on my first attempt to fit into jar the brown sugar totally dried out on top of the oats, thats why I separated  the oats from the brown sugar. I also made up a batch and they were quite tasty.

I had to reduce the oats to 1 1/4, chips to 1/2 and nuts to 1/3 only because I used old mason jars with glass tops with wire latches (not ones with screw on lids) and they must be smaller because I couldn't fit everything as here.  After making those adjustments they fit perfect.  But nonetheless I wanted to make them to see what I was giving away and to find out what they tasted like.  One of the best cookies I have made in a while.  Thank you!!  Cooked for 11 mins and they turned out a chewy golden brown. Oh and I recommend using margarine not butter, I used smart balance, real butter tends to make cookies crispy/dry.

Awesome recipe, used for Christmas gifts after sampling the recipe.  Did have to rearrange the ingredients list to fit, I did the flour & baking soda, powder & salt first, followed by the choc chips, brown sugar, white sugar & oatmeal.  Couldn't get the oatmeat to squish good enough to get the flour in last (so had to make a few batches of my own cookies before I got it right).  I also loved the directions previosly posted by LillyG73 and used it to decorate my jars.

I consider myself a pretty good cook and very capable of following directions, but these cookies were as hard as hockey pucks when they cooled off.  I cooked them for 13 minutes.  I followed the directions exactly.  Would never recommend giving these cookie jars to anyone.  I would be mortified if they had the same experience as I did.  Should I have creamed the butter instead of melting it??

I  made a batch to try first and they didn't turn out. It turned out been the QUICK OATS I used. Cookies were dry but tasted good. I added a little milk to the last batch to see if it would help hold the dough together (instead of my squeezing into walnut sized balls)and that helped. The  add  of milk made the cookies turn out like the ones everyone raved about. So I will not use QUICK OATS! I will make this  cookie again

Have gotten great reviews from recipients! I've made the recipe as a regular cookie recipe and it turned out wonderfully. I've been told by a few people that the brown sugar may get hard and they had to poke it with a fork to get it loose (not a hardship to me). Also that it can be a bit dry if left unused for a length of time (like it would last that long in my house!). Adding a 1-2 tbls of warm water to soften it up a lil. I've made this for Christmas gifts for at least 4 years now.

My sister and I made several jars of this mix for low-budget Christmas presents.  Next time we'll rearrange the order of layers so that the more easily compactable items go on the bottom. The chocolate chips should definitely go on top, both to avoid the bulk in the middle and the odd-looking sifting-down of the flour throughout the chips.

I thought I'd bake up a sample batch before packaging this up for gifts and it turned out fairly well.  I didn't have any nuts in the house, so I substituted white chips--waaay too many chips for the dough!  I was left with a handful of chips in the bottom of the bowl.  Oh! That's why!  {Face turning red as she looks at the recipe} The recipe calls for 1/2 cup nuts, I was trying to fit in a full cup!  OOPS! My mistake!  Other than that, the recipe turned out really good.  I was all out of vanilla too but the cookies weren't lacking flavor at all.  The only problem I had was with the chips melting and sticking to the sheet, but that was my mistake!  Can't wait to get some jars and start packing them up!

These are THE BEST cookies I've ever made.  It really helps to use your hands (not just mix by hand) when making the cookie balls.

SO great. I teach, and this was a simple gift for the teachers on my team as well as friends I don't usually buy for. I bought a dozen mason jars and just kept making them. Changed the name to "Winter Wafers" to sound Christmas-y. I also added fewer nuts. Tested them out, they're AWESOME. Already had requests for the full recipe :)

I have seen this recipe on a few sites and think it’s a wonderful idea.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 cup of oats, ¾ cup of chocolate chips, ¾ cup of M&M’s (Love the extra color that the M&M’s add to the cookies).  I did leave out the pecans, as I am not a nut person.  I tried the cookies first of all before I made up the jars (made 28 medium size cookies per batch). The cookies were very good, they had enough crunch on the outside and a wonderful soft inside.  I guess the secret is not to over cook them.  For the jars, I did find it hard going fitting all the ingredients in, but I am just so pleased with the results.  Not only does it look good, but I know the finished product tastes delicious too!  I am taking both the jars and the cookies along to a Christmas cookie exchange, I am sure they will be a huge hit.

I changed my layers to be more pleasing to the eye.  Chocolate chips went last so that the flour wouldn't fall through the cracks.  I made these jars for Christmas gifts for friends and everyone has said they were really good when baked.  One husband said they were the best cookies he has ever eaten!

I've always been a little hesitant about mixes, because one year someone gave us one that looked pretty in the jar, but tasted just awful when prepared.  Before I gave this out, I tried it and was very impressed.  This will be the second Christmas I have given these out.  Last year, everyone I gave them to asked for the recipe, so I decided to make it again.  I printed out the instructions then attached it to a colored sheet of card stock and tied it with raffia around the neck of the jar.  So cute!  A big hit for everyone!  :0)

My family loves this cookie!  I have made it so often that I can prepare it without the recipe.  At a recent "Cookie Party" these were a hit with everyone.
They are especially good when baked on a Pampered Chef flat stoneware piece!

When making jar mixes I have found this kitchen tool that works GREAT!  A kitchen supply company that provides home parties sells an "all-in-one" measuring cup that is two pieces and the inside works great for "packing" the ingredients.  Also try a tall, narrow plastic cup using the bottom to press with.  I love to make these jars for convenient gifts for unexpected holiday guests.

I haven't actually baked the cookies yet, but I'm making them as xmas gifts.  Just one point of advise.  Do it in this order: 
Flour, bakingsoda, baking powder, salt. 
Brown sugar
White sugar
oats
chocolate chips
nuts.  

This makes it look a lot nicer and makes the layers more defined.  Enjoy them! These make great gifts! Love Jill

I changed the servings to 12 and the ingredients went in the jar perfect.  This seems to be the right amount of ingredients for the butter, egg and vanilla too.  Not the 18 servings as shown.

These were horribly messy to put together and it's nearly impossible to pack down the layers. I could only get a half cup of chocolate chips into the jar (not the full cup the recipe calls for). Once these are all cleaned up they look nice - but there's about half a cup too much filling listed to fit in the jar!

Used Quick oats. Reduced white sugar to slightly under 1/3 cup. Layered the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt first so the presentation looks really nice. Reduced choc. chips to 3/4 cup and used slightly less pecans, made some cookies smaller and some bigger. I like the smaller, they cook in 12 minutes, the bigger needed some more time. Making smaller cookies, the recipe should make 30 cookies. Cookies baked nicely, didn't flatten out, were easy to make, taste great, are different, and a nice gift idea. One question: where do cowboy cookies come from, I never heard of them before?

This is the worst cookie recipe ever!  I'm so glad I tried it before I gave it to anyone.  The dough was dry and would not hold together, nor would it hold the chips and nuts.  When cooked, the cookies were bland and tasteless, dry, and the ugliest thing I've ever seen.  I have blue ribbons from the fair for my baking, so I know whereof I speak.  I will never make these cookies again.

I used the see-thru "treat bags" & put whites together, then packed brown sugar, oatmeal & chips. Did not use pecans. Looked cute in the bag! First batch I cooked was too hard. Cooked 13 minutes, must have been too long. They need to be very soft when they come out of oven. Probably only cook 8 minutes or so. Second batch I did as a pan cookie, cooked 10 minutes & they were great! Put in a cute little plastic bucket & carried them to work. They lasted all of 5 minutes tops!

I made these for my co-workers for Christmas last year and almost everyone of them asked me for the recipe.  I never even made them to see how they tasted, guess I got lucky!  One person said that the brown sugar was hard to get out so she put it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up and that worked great.  I will definately give these again, very easy to make and I love one of the previous reviewers instructions on how to bake, how creative!!!

I LOVE this recipe.  I used it for a fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and came back for more.  I did change a few ingredients....instead of choc. chips I used white choc. and instead of the nuts I used dried cranberries.  Thank you for this recipe.

My kids gave their teachers these jar cookies as presents one year but not before we tested them.  I found the cookies difficult to make so I dumped the dough in a square pan and made bars.  Just bake them a little longer.  They were delicious.  I keep this recipe around for when we need a quick treat.

Cub Scout Den made these gifts in a jar...the flour worked better on the bottom of the jar, so we layered differently.  But they loved doing it and ate all the samples. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a terriffic recipe.  I put the mix in jars and gave them as Christmas presents.  Everyone was asking me for the recipe.  When one makes them they are better when eaten as soon as possible; otherwise, they harden.  I'm sure you won't have a problem with this.  Mine are usually eaten before I can get them all out of the oven.

This cookie was delicious! I noticed one review that said that they were hard, that would indicate that the cook used low fat margarine, or not enough shortening. These are really good! We used them for a fund raiser- everyone loved them.

These made the neatest gifts for family and friends.  They went over so well this year!  My dough was a bit crumbly so I did have to use my hands to mix and shape into balls, but the finished product was wonderful!  I left mine in for eleven minutes at 350 degrees which left them slightly golden.  I made a batch one morning and they were gone by that evening!  I will definitely use this gift idea again!

Awesome recipe! So far I have made one batch and my husband keeps eating them all! I recommend adding 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon (which I did), and using a little more batter and then squashing the cookie onto the cookie sheet for a fatter cookie.  I cooked mine at 11 minutes (not even golden brown yet) and they came out nice and chewy, but at 13 or 14 minutes, they come out nice and crunchy! Either way, I'll be using this recipe for my Cookie In A Jar this holiday. =)

I feel like CRYING. I bought 12 jars, all the ingredients, made a adorable labels for the jars and followed the recipe EXACTLY. THIS DOES NOT FIT!!! I have a big MESS in the kitchen and after pressing & pressing the OATMEAL over and Over..the FLOUR ( last part ) DOES NOT FIT. I am so upset.

There are too many ingredients to fit in the jar.  I made two jars and had a hard time fitting everything into the jar.  I had to omit 1/8 cup of flour because it wouldn't fit.  I followed the recipe exactly and decided not to follow it the second time.  When I repeated this recipe again, I added the flour first and oats second.  This arrangement worked out for the best as I was able to tamp all the ingredients down really well and fit everything.  This is my suggestion for the arrangement of this recipe: flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, oats, holiday mini m&m's or chocolate chips, brown sugar, sugar and then pecan halves.  I didn't like having my decorated holiday m&m's at the top as you couldn't see the color display.  Hope the recipe is delicious and my family enjoys this as a gift.

This was a fun gift for our family to make together and give to friends and neighbors. All of my children ages 13, 10 and 6 enjoyed participating. We used walnuts instead of pecans for some of the jars.

Wow, these were just fabulous!  I made these for Christmas gifts, and of course, had to keep a jar for us!  Made them tonight -- best cookies ever!  I ended up with 24 cookies using the medium cookie scoop.  I left out the pecans and used chocolate chunks rather than chips.  The jar was really full (which is why the nuts were skipped).  Easy recipe.  Very nice looking cookies.  They stayed as mounds and didn't spread out at all.  They tasted just fabulous!  Brown sugar and oatmeal, my favorites.  And the chocolate chunks added a little extra touch.  These have become our new favorites.  I recommend them!

These cookies are delicious and easy to make but I'm holding back one star because....AS WRITTEN IT WON'T FIT IN A 1 QT JAR!!!!    I bought my jars at Michaels today and measured the inside to be sure.  I also packed in the ingredients but still ended up having to remove some chocolate chips.   Next time, I'll cut back on (or omit) the pecans.   I baked the recipe yesterday (no jar!) to test it and thought they were really good - nice thick cookies.   Just don't over bake them - light golden brown on the bottom is good.

Great presentation-horrible cookie!  I should have baked these cookies before making them as gifts.  Not only were they super dry, but they fell apart as soon as I took them out of the oven, and then they became rock hard.  Very disappointed!

This became my parents' favorite cookie recipe after I made these for the first time. I put the mix in the jar and left it there for over a week before using it. Here are my tips:
1. Layer the ingredients in this order: flour, baking powder, baking  soda, salt, oats, brown sugar, white sugar, pecans, chocolate chips. Make sure you shove the chocolate chips into every bit of space at the top. Mine could barely fit!
2. If the brown sugar hardens, dump out all the mix that can come out of the jar. Then stick the whole jar in the microwave next to a bowl of water ONLY IF there is no metal in your jar. Microwave about a minute, and the brown sugar should soften a bit.
3. Try to dump in the chocolate and pecans in last when you add the wet ingredients.

If you give this as a gift, tell them to use it as soon as possible!

I made up a few of these for gifts but should have made some first. The first batch I baked were quite dry & hard. I added 2 tabl. of milk to the remaining mix and the second batch was much better. I also rearranged the layers and used dried cranberries & pecans in place of choc. chips & walnuts.

A one quart Mason jar DOES work, but you have to be patient and take time to push everything down.  What helped I found was after putting in the chocolate chips, when add the flour tap the jar several times and you will have more space.  This turns out looking very nice in the jar!

A friend made these as party favors for her 2-year-old's "little chef" themed birthday party. They were a wonderful favor (who needs more plastic doodads, etc) and my toddler daughter and I had fun making them at home. They were so easy and very yummy. I would make the mixes myself without hesitation for gifts.

This was my first attempt at doing Cookies in a Jar.  I made 9 total (neighbors, friends, teachers) and it took about an hour having an assembly line set up on my island.  I omitted the nuts in case of allergies and everything fit just fine in the jars.  I also used a piece of parchment paper rolled in a cone shape to get the ingredients in without making a mess.  I layered them (bottom to top) - flour, salt, baking powder, soda, brown sugar, oats, white sugar, chocolate chips.  I printed out instructions and glued to red cardstock, cut out with scrapbooking scissors, and tied to jars with pretty Christmas ribbon.  I've not made them yet but the feedback so far is that they are delicious and easy!  Friends and neighbors loved doing with kids.  Great recipe.  I'll post photo when I can.

Too hard to enjoy. I am so glad I tested these before giving them as gifts. Tried them while they were still warm and they tasted delicious. Came back to them after they cooled and they were hard. Good for dipping in milk and the children don't mind them, but I was hoping for a softer more chewy cookie. I think I'll try another recipe on this site before settling on one of my own tried and true less colorful, but quite tasty recipes.

I decided to make the cookies first before handing them out as gifts. I agree with some of the reviews that the cookies were somewhat dry. They tasted ok, but I prefer a softer chewy cookie rather that a cookie with the texture of a biscotti. Perhaps, I should of added an extra egg or some milk as suggested by others.

Sorry, but this cookie wasn't very good.  The MELTED margarine in it made it so the oatmeal and chocolate chips wouldn't mix it very well and they got HARD, quickly.

The jar looked great and the layers - with their different colors and textures - make for a very nice presentation. However, the cookie was very average and had way to many oats for my taste. Looking for a better cookie in a jar recipe that I could offer as a gift this coming Christmas, I tried  Julia's Best Ever Chocolate Chip Cookies In A Jar (also found on this site). Julia's cookies tasted heavenly! The look of the jar is not as pretty as this one, but hey... who cares about the jar? It's the cookie that matters! So... if you are just after a pretty looking cookie in a jar recipe, this is it -- but if you want an outstanding cookie, try Julia's.

TASTY!  Did fill quart jar just right!  Made with (red & green) m&m's for Christmas gifts... kept one for us to try.  Better with m&m's than just chocolate chips:)  Made some smaller than suggested & were good; bigger seemed to stay more moist.

Per other reviews, I also added an extra egg which made the cookies quite moist.  When I layered in a jar this was the order: combined the sugar and flour mixture (w/ baking soda, baking powder, & salt) and put that in first; then chocolate chips, brown sugar, and rolled oats.  I then put the pecans in a ziplock bag and stapled it to the back of the recipe card.  This way if the recipients didn't like nuts in their cookies, they weren't stuck with them.

This is a great recipe. I did add an extra egg as other reviewers suggested and I didn't have to use my hands at all (the dough came together nicely with the extra egg and I just used my cookie scoop). The flavor was still excellent, but I didn't have to fuss with doing everything by hand, so I recommend adding an extra egg!

As a jar cookie, these work great, too. I  am giving them as Christmas gifts, so far to rave reviews! Be sure to pack each level tight!

These cookies were great!  I tried out three different recipes in one day to decide what to do for my neighborhood cookie swap this year.  These won as they were the best and everyone loved them.

Made these for a friend for the holiday.  She says the cookies tasted great but she had a lot of trouble getting the sugar out of the jar.  Next time I would layer in reverse, since sugar can harded and be difficult to remove from the jar.

A very good recipe.  I think that 2/3 to 3/4 C. Chocolate Chips would be enough, though.  Using my hands to mix really helped.  They were moist, chewy,  and everyone loved them :)

Having never tried this before, I wasn't sure it would work. Either the recipe wouldn't be good or it wouldn't fit in the jar. Was I pleasantly surprised! It was perfect. Did a trial run to make sure of the taste and it gets five stars! only thing I did different was use half chocolate chips and half mini m&m baking chips, just for color.I plan to give some of the cookies with the jars so everyone will know how good they are.

These taste very good.  A bit crunchy, but I like crunchy cookies.  Easy to make.  Look good when layered in jar; however I changed the order and put the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt first.  Then followed with oats, etc.  Keeps flour from drifting down and looked better.  Kids liked them too.

Great cookies and especially a great gift!!
Looked REALLY cool. It all fitted well in a 1 litre jar. (Don't pack the layers TOO tight)
Next time I'll put more layers in the jar, and use white, lightbrown and darkbrown sugar. 
The dough was a little crumbly, but when shaping, it becomes smooth.(but be sure to use a large egg)
The cookies didn't spread much. Because I like my cookies more flat, I pushed down the dough.
I used half pecans, half walnuts.
I can't wait to make more jars to give away!

Cookies turned out really good, a little flat though.  I think if you let the mix sit for awhile or pop in the fridge it will do better

I put these into those cellophane Party Loot bags and added a nice ribbon at the top with the instructions.  Gave them away as Christmas gifts.  I kept one for myself and felt that they needed about 1/4 LESS sugar and less chocolate chips and some water.  I added water once I was mixing it cuz I just couldn't get it moist enough.  The result however is very good.  I think they're a great gift idea, especially for moms with young children.  They just pour it out, mix in what's missing ad voila!  No mess, no stress!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I couldn't find any jars because they are a seasonal item at the stores.  So, I used a food storage container instead.  Everyone loved getting the yummy cookies and a new "tupperware" type container also. You can also add white chocolate chips or toffee chips to this recipe instead.  Any way you choose, it is delicious.

I was easily able to fit all the ingredients using a 1L (33.8oz) wide-mouth Ball mason jar, and had 1" of space leftover.   As others have noted, the ingredients are listed BACKWARDS.   A few recommendations for all jarred cookie mixes:   Flour/leavener goes on the bottom, followed by brown sugar and other dense ingredients, and topped with less dense "mix-ins".   For ingredients in larger amounts (like flour), mound them in the center to make more room along the perimeter for the next layer.   This will give you more defined layers.

The resulting cookie dough seemed too dry at first, but eventually came together just fine.  I used 1.5Tbs scoops and baked the first batch for 11 min, pulling them when the centers were soft and the edges were barely crisp.  They had great flavor, shape, & texture.  However, after cooling, these cookies went from chewy to rock hard, moreso than other cookie recipes.   I underbaked the second batch, and that seemed to do the trick.

I loved these cookies!  We didn't have pecans so I used peanuts which worked just as well.  However, my kids weren't a big fan of the peanuts.  Next time I used slivered almonds and they loved that.  Great cookie!

I made the recipe exactly as written, then formed the batter (yes, it is very loose and dry) into large balls in my hand and flattened them a bit before putting them on the pan.  This recipe made 22 large cookies. We enjoyed the flavor of this cookie very much, but my husband didn't like that they seem so fragile to hold, they can easily fall apart.  There's very little liquids in this recipe, so I am assuming that is why they are so crumbly. But still very tasty!

SO much tastier than Nestle's recipe and these make an awesome gift in a jar.  We like them with 1/4 cup of white sugar - they are almost too sweet, if that's possible.  We use the dark Ghirardelli chips (again a bit less than called for in the recipe).  I'll never make chocolate chip cookies the "old" way again!!!

These made beautiful gifts for teachers and friends and they were inexpensive to make.  I actually made a batch of these first to try them and they were delicious.  I left out the pecans just in case of allergies and the recipe made 3 dozen cookies.

Gave as a gift, has a few left over and I just made one.  The Brown Sugar was a bit hard, make sure to really tighten the lid.  Turned out great, my husband's fav. cookie.  For the day after, microwave cookies for 5-7 seconds to soften.  Store cookies with a slice of bread to keep soft. Really had to pack it down to get it to fit, so I omited the pecans.

Soooo crumbly. I mixed for what seemed like quite awhile to me, but I'm not sure if that was the issue. Both the batter and the cookies kept falling apart. The flavor is good. If you know enough about how to adjust cookie recipes, you could probably make this one work.

This baked up very well, but the order of the ingredients is wrong if you don't want flour getting into the choc chips.  The order I used was flour(pre-combined with the bp, baking soda and salt), oats, brown sugar, white sugar, pecans and choc chips.  As I was giving this to friends who don't bake at all I experimented with using canola oil instead of melted butter (people who don't bake tend to only have spreads which ruin baked goods) and it works perfectly.  None of the recipients had ever seen a cookie mix jar before and seemed to really enjoy the novelty.

Great Recipe... although I didn't eat them- I gave them away as gifts. You DO have to put the ingredients in backwards, thanks for the tips.  One person I gave them to said "best cookie ever"

Made far too much to fit in the jar. Cookies were just okay.

Despite the directions stating to layer in order, be sure to put the flour in first. If not the flour seeps into the layer of chocolate. I used M&M's and there seemed to be more space for seeping. Also, I have a small gravy ladle that fits perfectly into the mouth of my jars, and with it's shape it makes pressing the layers down perfect!

I made these for Thanksgiving to test them out before I do them up for Christmas.  Yummie cookies.  I can't wait to give the jars as presents.  I will be putting them in gift bags with aprons as gifts.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and the great idea

I made this recipe twice before I made up jars for gifts.  I found that cutting up the stick of butter and letting it soften instead of melting it made a more cohesive dough.  The melted butter didn't mix as thoroughly and the dough fell apart as I tried to form balls.  With the softened butter the dough was evenly moist and the cookies were easier to work with and had better flavor.  I also found that moistening my hands helped to keep the dough from sticking to them when I formed the balls.

Before I packaged these up for Christmas gifts, I wanted to try them.  They are soooo delicious and very easy to make.  I can't wait to package them up and give them away!

Added later: I didn't have any problems with space in my packaging.  I took the advice and reversed the order (it looks better than the original instructions, too).  In fact, I have room to spare!  Perhaps it's because I used a 1 qt. square cracker jar with a large opening.  You may also be interested in knowing that 1 quart = 1.1 liters. So, try a large mouthed jar, or if using a small mouthed jar, look for a jar that is 1 liter in size for just a little more space.

They may taste good but do not attempt o fit these in a jar.  Mine wouldn't fit even though I pressed them as hard as I could.  Wish someone would have told me this before I tried to make 7 jars full.

This makes a great gift and the resulting cookies are delicious. I used Mason jars topped with a bit of  bandana fabric that had snowmen on it.  It made a great make-a-gift project for kids through junior high.

Delicious. I didn't even put these in a jar. The kids just put the ingredients into a big bowl and mixed with their hands. We brought these cookies to a get together and they went fast.

Good recipe, I didnt care too much for the taste, but everyone that tried them thought they were delicious.  My mom doesnt like Pecan's but she still thought the cookie was wonderful, pecan's included.  I made two batches of these for the christmas holiday!  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to spice it up a bit.

These were nice. Spreaded out a bit too much, but a bit of flour solves that problem. Burns easily too, be sure not to overbake. A bit too sweet for my liking, so I added a small amount of lukewarm water. Soft when just taken out but hardens when cooled. Nice cookies!

These were pretty good.  I bought regular quart size jars instead of wide mouth which made it harder to pack each ingredient down firmly until I figured out that the bulb end of my turkey baster was perfect for packing the ingredients down.  I've given them as gifts to my grown nieces and nephews this Christmas plus I'm keeping a couple on hand for that last minute gift.  They would also be great to store in my pantry, in case I need cookies in a hurry.

I needed 25 gifts for hard working Ontario Fair volunteers and the Cowboy Cookie Mix has worked out great.  I had a hard time to get everything in the jar.  Did anyone else? I cut back the flour a bit and added it to the instructions for mixing.  The layers look very attractive and the cookies taste great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I can't find my previous review but I wanted to add these tips:

We used a wooden spoon to pack it down. 
Great family project. We made an assembly line. 
We used a large mouth funnel. 
There is more than enough room if you pack it down right. 
Do NOT follow the ingredients list. I started following the picture after reading reviews then found this to be best:
Flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt then oats, white sugar, brown sugar, nuts, chocolate chips. I even added more chocolate chips. 
The directions say, "walnut sized balls" but the dough thankfully didn't want to do that because they are much better maybe double that size. 
Some of the best cookies I have ever had!!!

This is a great recipe (had to test it out before giving it as gifts). 

For those who have had trouble fitting the contents into the jar, the following order of ingredients to go into the jar first is what worked for me:

1. Flour (using parchment paper to funnel into the mason jar)
2. Brown Sugar (then I patted down, which in turn compressed the flour underneath it, I also pressed some of the brown sugar against the side (1/2 C. isn't so much that you're going to get a thick looking layer unless you do this).
3. White Sugar
4. Oats
5. Baking Soda / Baking Powder
6. Chocolate Chips (the trick is to put in as much as you can (it won't be the full cup) and then press down on everything. It will compact all the layers underneath it. After that, you'll be able to pour the rest of the chocolate chip cookies in.

As you can see, I omitted the nuts. What I did was on the recipe instructions (where they add the butter, eggs and vanilla) is just added the instructions to add 1/2 C. chopped pecans if desired. That way you let the person who's receiving the gift decide if they want the nuts or not. 

Definitely a great, simple, (delicious), inexpensive & very thoughtful gift!

The whole recipe wouldn't fit in my jars so I reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. I made a batch for myself to test them out and they came out pretty good even with the reduced chocolate chips.

Great cookies!  A suggestion:  Instead of using quart jars, I use one quart plastic bags.  I give out so many of these gifts in a "jar" at holiday time that the bags are much more affordable than the quart jars, plus they have a little "wiggle room" if all the ingredients don't quite fit in a glass jar!  They look just as nice wrapped with a ribbon and small embellishment, and/or a decorative tag.

I have made this recipe often and always am very conservative on the bake time. Set it at 8 min. and usually add 2 until just slightly browned on the edges and set in middle. They will firm up quite a bit after cooling. They are really good. As far as fitting in the jar goes, I bought two quart jars and I also added a cup of peanut butter chips, 1 cup of raisins, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Fit great with just a bit of room at the top. Also followed recommendations to start with flour first and it did look much nicer.

Made a batch of cookies exactly as written... Got really big chewy cookies that everyone in the family loved. The key is not baking too long. For us that meant taking them out at 12 mins after baking TWO cookie sheets at the same time. Would definitely make again!

Wonderful!  I used this recipe last year as Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved them and I will be using again this year.  Note: It definitely took a little bit of finess to pack the ingredients into the jar tight enough to fit it all in.

I didn't make these in a jar, just mixed them like a regular cokie recipe.  They are wonderful.  I made a mini chocolate chip, pecan, raisin combination cookie that tastes awesome.  A little chewy from the raisins, a little crunchy with the pecans and oats, and gooey with the chocolate.  Everything you want in a cookie - Great Recipe!!  Next time I am thinking of a milk chocolate, white chocolate, walnut combination - YUM!

I changed the order the ingredients go in the jar and it was much easier and looks better too! I did flour, baking soda and powder then brown sugar followed by pecans, oats, chocolate chips, and then sugar. Make sure you pack after adding each ingredient. Great gift idea!

Hallelujah!!! These are faboo!  I've just eaten one fresh from the cooling rack, and it will be hard to control myself.  They are supposed to be for dinner tomorrow night.  Fat Chance!!!  I used pecans and real butter (as any good Amish wannabe would!)  Try these; you won't be sorry.  Blessings!!

These were a huge hit with my kids teachers!  I love the advice of turning the recipe into a cowboy poem.  Definitely reverse the order of the ingredients into the jar or else the flour will sink to the bottom.

Really neat gift idea!  The cookies arn't bad either :)  I couldn't fit it all in the jar so, I left out 1/4 cup of the chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of the oats.  It didn't effect the yumminess of the cookies, in fact they are more moist without some of the oats.  Even with leaving out those ingredents I BARELY could pack it all in to a quart sized Mason Jar.

I put the flour (pre mixed with the baking soda, salt, and baking powder) on the bottom.  I then put in the brown sugar, white sugar, pecans, chocolate chips, and oats.  This way the flour doesn't dust all the other ingrdients, and also you can make sure you have enough room.  If you don't you can eliminate oats and chocolate chips instead of a more important ingrident.

Based on other reviews, I added 2 tablespoons of milk to the mix to make them more moist.  I thought the cookies were tasty but even with adding the milk, the texture was a bit dry.  I think adding another tablespoon of milk would make them just right.  I also think adding a teaspoon of cinnamon would add extra flavor to the cookie.  Overall, it's an average cookie recipe.

This recipe made some excellent cookies for me and the jars were fun to make(a bit of a pain to pack down). But when I gave the jars away as gifts last year I got complaints. I filled the jars about a week or so before giving them and those who waited a while (a few weeks or so)to make the cookies had problems. Apparently the brown sugar hardened and wouldnt come out of the jar except with a chisel and hammer. So, I would recommend not letting the mix sit in the jar for too long. But aside from that the cookies are super yummy and the jars looked beautiful.

I thought I was packing hard, but like others, I couldn't quite fit everything.  Leaving out the nuts it just barely fit.  I scooped by teaspoonfuls instead of forming balls, and the first batch was a tad too crispy around the edges.  I made the cookies a bit bigger in later batches and they stayed chewier.  Will definitely made again, really great cookies, and will probably try the gift jar again.  It was a pretty & inexpensive gift with a personal touch.

These were very good.  I had to add 1/4 cup of water to help everything stay together.  I made a batch to test them before giving as gifts and now I'm eating myself sick because they're so moist and delicious.  I layered them with the flour & salt & baking powder and soda on bottom, then packed down the brown sugar, then all the chocolate chips, then the oats, then the white sugar on top. (I left out the nuts--I don't know how hard you have to pack things to fit those in.) You can't see much of the white sugar but I was more interested in seeing the other colors/textures.  Thanks for the recipe!

The whole point is to put it in a jar, not a jar plus a zip lock bag. Not attractive for gift giving. I might try again with the ingredients in a different order.

I made a test batch a few days ago, brought them to work and they dissapeared real fast. I did have to change to recipe a bit though, it came out way too dry. So I added an extra egg to the mix and it was still a bit dry, but I was able to hand roll them in to balls and bake them. They turned out great, but not the best!!

I made 8 jars of these cookies for teacher gifts.  I found a small child's drinking cup works well to pack down the ingredients.  They fit well in the jars, and turned out beautifully.

The presentation was great--but it didn't even come close to fitting in the jar!  So, make sure you use a big jar when making this recipe.  The lady I gave it to LOVED it!  I hope it works good for you!

I made these last year for Christmas presents and they were a huge hit!  I got the jars back a few weeks after Christmas with a "demand" that they be filled again for the next holiday.

I haven't tried these yet but made them for a friend and she gave them rave reviews!!  The only problem I had was trying to fit it all in the jar.  I used the size it called for but had to leave at least a 1/4 cup of the flour out and I only added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips cause it wouldn't all fit.  Maybe if I used mini chocolate chips next time?  Anyway it still turned out great and I'll try packing it WAAAAAY tighter next time.  A hit!!

Never mind the jar, these are not even making it to the cooling rack. My kids love them and I don't even like oatmeal and I am enjoying them. I did leave out the pecans and add a splash of milk. Thanks for a new family favorite.

Great cookies!  Perfectly chewy, moist, and with a little bit of crunch.  I had a difficult time fitting all the ingredients in the jar- so I would decrease the choc. chips a bit!  I will definetely make these again!

Easy to assemble and nice looking.  Make sure you use a large (I mean large) jar or you will have trouble fitting everything in.

Thought I would try a sample batch before giving as gifts. Yum! Added dried cranberries for a little chewiness and color.

This is one of the worst cookies I've ever had! I was very disappointed with it and surprised by the reviews it was very dry and does not spread at all I used regular butter not margarine. I tried another batch 2 days later thinking I might have done something wrong.. they came out the same again AWFUL! it might just be me but this is not a cookie I would ever recommend or give as a gift.

Our family made these cookies to taste before giving them as gifts!  WOW are they delicious.  A family favorite from now on.  So chewy and gooey.  Something fun for kids to make and so proud to give as gifts to friends and teachers.
Thanks for submitting this recipe.

These are fabulous!  I actually tried them last year before giving them out as gifts (wanted to make sure they were worth giving...) AND BOY HOWDY they are! :o)  Have had 2 "hints" this year that they would be oh so pleased to receive these again.  I have actually used the recipe at home just to make the cookie!  AND hubby likes to make ice cream sandwiches with these.  Give them a try!  :o)

I made these as gifts for the fire crew that works with me, and even though 97% are single guys, they all went home and baked cookies. each one of them called to tank me for a great gift, they said it was almost like having me there cooking for them, LOL.

I made these and Brownie Mix in a Jar II (also on this site) for Christmas. I didn't try these personally, but I've gotten nothing but good reviews, even from my sister who would definently say if they weren't good :) !! And they did look so pretty in the jar with all the layers (much better than the brownie mix)!!

Cute and easy. The mixes were a big hit as 'gifts from Texas' with small western ornaments attached. The cookies were good too, but need to be kept in a airtight container, so as not to get dry and hard.

The recipe was easy to make and bake, although I thought the cookie was not quite as flavorful as I would prefer.  It was ok but not great.  It will be a good present for those random last minute people you need presents for.

Although I've never made the cookies or eaten them, I made 3 jars for Christmas presents.  It didn't take long to do, was alot of fun and I had all the ingredients at home already.  They were so cool looking that I plan on doing it again next year.

It was difficult to get the cookie balls to hold together so I found making them was time consuming. The last half of the batter I put in a 6x6 pan and baked it at 350F for about 11 minutes. They came out very well. I cut them into squares. Eat plain or frost with chocolate icing. Faster and just as good. Barb G.

I made these cookies for a family get together
this spring and everyone loved them, especially
the guys. I added raisins and sunflower meats.
I was surprised how quickly they baked and how
large and chewy they are. It's a great cookie to
take on a picnic or family outing.

I got these as a gift and they are great!  This year we made them as gifts along with Cranberry Hootycreeks.  We used regular quart jars as opposed to wide mouth and could only fit 1/3 cup of flour at the end so we just added the extra cup of flour to the recipe card.

Pretty good cookies. Taste-wise not bad, not sweet, and nice mouth bite. They are a little dry and don't really flatten out much during baking, so they stay in the shape you started with. If you desire a flatter, thinner cookie, I recommend pressing them down slightly after placing on baking sheet. Also let them cool a bit before transferring to wire racks, they are kind of cakey fresh out of the oven, so they might fall apart if you transfer too soon. Cheers!

Tasty as written but mixture was crumbly .  I agree that this works better with 2 eggs vs one.  With 2 eggs, the cookies were perfect - soft and not too sweet.

Used others' suggestions and added an egg. Also, made sure to put the brown sugar layer separate from the oatmeal layer. I also had trouble adding all ingredients. Cut back slightly on the chocolate chips. Good taste. Family likes. :)

Like others I decided I need to rearrange the layers and probly decrease the oats and chocolate chips slightly for an easier fit. And put flour on bottom. I added 1 extra egg as someone else suggested as well as some cinnamon. Turned out greAt. Will be making jars for coworkers.

I put the white sugar on the bottom followed by the brown sugar and then the oats. The layers were well separated this way. Then the chocolate chips, pecans and flour. I used it as a prize for my western themed party for best dressed!

I gave these as Christmas gifts this year.  Everything will fit into a quart Mason jar; however, you need to pack very tightly.   It is better to over do it than to not have enough room.

Everyone told me how great they were so I pulled out the recipe and made some myself last night.  Very easy and oh - so - good!  I'm keeping this one.

Saved us countless dollars on Christmas this year ! paired each jar with a large mug containing coco mix, crushed candy cane , and marshmallows  and a pair of Christmas cookie cutters they look super festive and fun and no one will know they cost less then 50$ total for it all .

I made 10 of these jars... 9 for Christmas presents and 1 to keep. It took me to my 3rd jar until I found a method and order that worked for me. First - I left out the nuts, and tweaked the directions to indicate that 1/2 cup of nuts could be added with the contents of the jar. Not everyone likes nuts, and with all the allergies today I felt this was safer. Now, to the order. I did oats, flour/spice mixture, brown sugar, white sugar, chocolate chips. I have no idea how one would successfully add 1/2 cup of nuts in addition, which is one of the reasons I am docking a star from the recipe. I made the jar that I reserved for myself, and had to add a little more butter to get the dough to stick together enough. That is the other reason I knocked it down a star.  The cookies, however, where fabulous. I only got about 26, and baked them for the lower amount of time.

For a Christmas twist, we added peppermint chips instead of nuts.  Really yummy like hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps :)

The cookies are wonderful! I had a problem fitting everything into the jar, after reading other comments know I'll have an easier time next go-round. Going to pkg. ingredients in zip top bags to take in RV for cookie baking. Thanks everyone for great suggestions! Merry Christmas.

these are amazing!! we made a batch last night and they are already all gone...we made these as thank you gifts for the guests at our small wedding...we omitted the pecans and when packing made sure everything was pretty snug..we did it in the exact order as written....we mixed the baking soda, powder, and salt in with the flour then packed together....we did not taste them before we handed them out so we were crossing our fingers but they are soo good!! when you mix the wet and dry it seems as though there is not enough wet ingredients when you begin to make the balls but dont worry about it they are amazing as is!!

My daughter and I made this as a gift for her teacher. It is very easy to do, just take your time. I added all kinds of extras like peanut butter chips and coconut, and than just adjusted her recipe card that was attached. We made one for ourselves and it turned out very yummy!

This was really easy to make and it tastes delicious.  My friend had made these for me and then shared the recipe.  They were so quick and easy.  These are definitely a keeper.  The dough is a bit crumbly but I just form the balls by hand and them smash them slightly flat.  The recipe for 18 makes pretty large cookies and I had to bake them for 15 minutes at 350F.

This year for Christmas, I decided to give these for gifts. I baked them first to make sure they tasted good & they do. My only problem is fitting everything in the jar! I followed the directions first then tried a suggestion from another review. I also tried mixing the nuts & chocolate chips together but came up 1/4 cup short. HELP!

I LOVE these cookies!! I used to make them years ago for my family and friends, but the recipe was lost in a yard sale and I couldn't find its match anywhere. Imagine my delight at finding it on Allrecipes! It truly made my Christmas! This recipe is so simple and fun, I love the jar ideas too, what a wonderful way to share my favorite recipes!

The cookies were amazing! We baked them to test the recipe before we use them for gifts, and we will definitely be giving these to friends for the holidays. The ingredients fit perfectly in the wide-mouthed quart jar. We used an empty water bottle to press down each layer. The next day, we heated them in the microwave for 10-15 seconds on high power to make them warm and soft as if they had just come out of the oven. We highly recommend this recipe! :)

These are delicious!  I was able to fit almost everything in the 1 quart jars.  I started with the flour, then oatmeal, then Chocolate Chips, then brown sugar and white sugar and I topped it off with the pecans.  I packed each layer down very well.  Each jar had a different amount of pecans as I just put enough to fill up the rest of the jar.  I will save this recipe to use every Christmas.

This is a delicious cookie, and the mix fits nicely into the jar, as long as you smush down each layer as tightly as possible.

It needs a little TWEEKIN', need to add a little water, and less oats to fit in the jar. I started with 1/3 c oats, then packed it all in, then topped it off with more oats if I had room.

The batter is very dry and crumbly when prepared as directed.  Nonetheless, I resisted my impulse to add a little moisture, and the cookies turned out fine.  A bit dense and hearty, but tasted good.

Great cookies. One of the best that I have eaten. I had a huge problem getting everything in the 1 quart jar I will go to the next size up the next time I make these. I am sure that will do the trick.

Thanks for the recipe.

This mix looks great in the jar but I barely (and I mean BARELY) was able to get all of it in the jar.  I packed the ingredients in tight and double checked the size recommendation on the jar.  I'm just hoping that it doesn't make an enormous mess when it is opened!

Super easy!! I was trying this before I made it for gifts. Very good!
I didnot have the rolled oats that the recipe called for so instead I used 4 packets of flavored instant oatmeal and cut the sugar in half. I baked mine in a 9x9 pan as others suggested for 15 minutes. They turned out moist and delish!! You could use whatever flavor of oatmeal that you have I had four different flavors and it was great. I will definately make this for gifts and if I have the troubles that others suggested with filling the jar I may just include the 4 packets of instant oatmeal with the jar or add it to the recipe card that way the recipient can use the flavor that they like the best. I did not have to use my hands to mix a wooden spoon worked just fine.

I haven't tried them to determine how they taste, but was extremely disappointed with them because all of the ingredients would not fit into a quart jar.  I had to go buy 12 oz jelly jars to put the flour, etc. into.

3/15/2007  This is just one of the Recipe, for cookie jars I sold for the 2006 Christmas season.  I did this instead of getting a part time job to pay for Christmas gifts for my 3 kids with cash.  I had the most orders for this recipe.  All together I made $250.00 profit and plan to do it again this Christmas.  Thanks, so much.

I tested them out last night to see how they taste before giving as gifts.  They were pretty good.  I agree with the other poster that they were a bit dry.  I will try again adding an extra egg.

The cookie recipe is very good although I added an egg because it was too dry.  I did discover, though, that if you make the jars too far in advance, the brown sugar dries out.  I made one two weeks before using it and the brown sugar was hard as a rock.  As a cookie recipe it gets 4 stars, as a jar cookie recipe it only gets 1.

Taste is scrumptious.  Can really taste the brown sugar in them which gives them an almost caramel flavor. Cookies are not too soft, nor too hard.  But mix is difficult to scoop and keep together long enough to bake. Otherwise this would be a 5.

These are great cookies!  I did have a problem fitting everything into a 1-quart wide-mouth jar, even when leaving out the nuts.  I guess I'll have to work on that part; maybe I'll try reversing the order as someone else suggested.

This recipe is good and a great gift idea.  I made the recipe for 36 cookies but ended up getting more than 50.  It's better to make the cookies bigger.  The smaller cookies were a little dry.  But over all everyone enjoyed these cookies!

These cookies were OK.  I found them a bit crumbly and hard.  It was hard to fit all the ingredients in one jar.  
I think I'll keep looking for another recipe.

Yet another five stars here- I also skipped the jar and just made the recipe for our Christmas party this year. These were a huge hit and they looked great! Love all the yummy stuff that pops out of the top of the cookie! I doubled the batch and probably wouldn't have needed too- kinda hard to mix the thick batter. Overall great recipe!

made these as a test, prior to giving away. Put all ingredients in mixer at one time to simulate someone pouring the jar contents. Worked out great! Used a small scoop to keep cookies uniform. Everyone loved them!

I can see why this is one of the Top 10 recipes.  When everybody in my family loves it, I know it's a "keeper".

This recipe was awesome!  I made it for some neighbors and relatives this holiday season.  It was easy to place in the jars - with the exception of the brown sugar, which was a little bit difficult to pack down - and it looked terrific.  The final product was the best thing about these cookies.  It was tasty and the baking time was right on target.  I know that this recipe will become a permanent fixture in my book at home!

I think it would also be good with 1/2 cup chocolate chips, to reduce the fat and calories a bit

Without much money to spend on gifts, my
daughter made and gave cookies-in-a-jar
last year.  This was a real favorite.
