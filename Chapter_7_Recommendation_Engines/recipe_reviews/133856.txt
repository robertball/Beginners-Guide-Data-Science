This is a great soup that my kids love. I have made some simple changes though. By using Bouillon tablets, I am able to throw in a vegetable tablet with the chicken broth and it's a nicer flavor then the ready made broth, plus the kids get some extra vegetables. I also changed the parsley for Dill Weed, which gives the soup an added kick of flavor and for the kids I make smaller matzo balls. But I love the recipe for the matzo balls and find they work out every time!!!

I added some shredded dark meat chicken and it was amazing!  Everyone loved it.  Also used premade matzo ball mix and added some parsley.  Making it again tonight!

Made this during the week and it is very good. I didn't have white pepper so I used black and it worked fine and I used dried parsley. I appreciate basic, simple food.

I'm not jewish, nor have ever made any traditional jewish food, however my husband requested this when he was sick one weekend. I found this recipe, had no problem following it and the results were great. I'll make this again for both sick and well family members.

Excellent recipe. I tried making matzo ball soup for the first time, and impressed the family with this one. I used homemade chicken broth, which I think makes this more authentic. Your Bubie would be proud, hillrockra. lol. Thanks for sharing. I'll make it again soon.

Ouch! The matzo balls were so hard that when I tried to cut into them with a spoon, one popped out of the bowl!  Don't like using a knife for soup...

I added diced onion to this and it was delicious.  Oh, the broth was super salty.  I will buy less sodium chicken broth next time.  I also used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of veggie broth.  When making the balls I added a few tablespoons of fresh cut parsley.

Easy to make and hits the spot--especially if you're sick and have no one to make this for you! I used a combo of chicken and vegetable stock for more dimension. Yum!

Deelish! I have made this soup a few times and each time played around with it. I have added cut up chicken and also made my own stock. This is a great recipe to make and also use as a guideline. It's so easy!
