We loved this recipe ~ instead of using pork chops, we used pork tenderloin which we marinated with olive oil, cumin, ginger, cayenne and garlic then grilled the whole tenderloin and served it with the peanut sauce over rice.  Delicious !!!

This was a first for me to make something Thai. Since I don't really know what thai food should taste like, I am not sure I would be a fair judge of this recipe. I made this for my family and it was easy to make. I doubled the sauce part and I would encourage you to do the same. The flavors were interesting and different...I would say different-good. Instead of using the red bell peppers as a garnish, I put them in the sauce during the last couple of minutes with half of the green onions to flavor the sauce alittle more. I garnished the meat with the other half of the green onions and sprinkled the peanuts on top as the recipe says. It was a beautiful presentation. My brother in law has had thai with this paticular peanut sauce and he said it was excellent. I thought the meat would have a "bite" to it with the red pepper in it, but I hardly noticed it. My 2 year old and 5 year old ate it with no complaint about hotness. I would of preferred it alittle hotter, so next time  
I will increase that- or maybe just put the red pepper on the table for each person to decide how hot they want it. Be sure not to overcook the pork so it will remain moist. If you have alittle pink in the middle when you pull it from the pan, as it sits it will continue cooking on it's own while you are preparing the sauce..it will be perfectly done and moist.

thanks for a fine, "Thai style" pork chop recipe that is both tasty, and easy to put together.  BTW, for those who were put off by the extra coconut milk, this is a clue; put the excess in a small freezer proof container and freeze it.  The stuff lasts for about a half a year that way, and if you don't use it in that amount of time it is too bad.

I too made a bit more sauce, and I used some cashews instead of the dry roasted peanuts.  But that was not for any reason other than I had the one and not the other?

Thanks, good stuff. Clint.

This was delicious.  I served it with Peanut Butter Noodles on this website which was a bit of a mistake because both recipes have VERY strong/rich flavors... nevertheless, these chops were superb and I will definitely make them again..... maybe with some plain white rice (for the sauce) and a salad with a miso dressing for an Asian flair. Oh, the sauce went from thin to a bit over-thick quickly, so watch out for that .. .espec if you are wanting something to pour over rice.  Maybe, if making rice, I'll double the sauce so there's enough to pour over the rice.  The sauce was really yummy and reminded me SO MUCH of the food I get at my yummy local Thai restaurant.  EDIT:  Made this again, (no red peppers for us!) tripled the sauce and made rice.  Tripling gave me a bit too much sauce, doubling would probably be perfect.  Poured the sauce over the rice with the onions/cilantro/peanuts. Still a delicious recipe.

My family quite enjoyed this  - but I have to say I found the peanut sauce a little overpowering. I would probably make this again, but add a bit more coconut milk or water to the sauce.

I was tempted to try this recipe using chicken instead of pork, but my husband was in the mood for pork, so I made it exactly as written and it didn't disappoint!  Yum!  What a wonderful and tasty dish!  We really enjoyed the flavor combinations and will definitely be making this again.

I didn't try this myself, but my husband loved it. I made 1.5 times the amount of sauce and it was perfect. I didn't bother measuring the amounts of red pepper, onion, nuts, and cilantro for garnish--just did it to taste (i.e., a lot of each). EDITED: I tried this finally and it's very good. Served with Thai fried rice and lots of crushed nuts, yum.

Wow, this was great!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  All three kids had seconds and even my picky husband enjoyed it.  I think I would have liked some garlic or cayenne in the sauce (I like spicey food) but then my kids wouldn't have liked it as much.  The topping of pepper, onion peanuts and  cilantro on really takes this from good to fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum! I have made this twice now, the second time round I doubled the quantity of sauce as it's so delicious. The only thing I change is the nuts. I cannot stand the dry roasted peanuts in shops so I just buy regular salted peanuts and dry fry them in a pan to toast them.

This is really good; I just think it is missing garlic.  I didn't even realize there was none in the recipe until I was eating it!  I would also add some lime juice.  It took longer than stated to cook my pork chops all the way through.  I made two large pork chops and doubled the sauce- there was a little too much but I'd rather have too much.  We used it on our brown rice.  Omitted most of the salt and used light coconut milk and natural peanut butter.  I cooked the red pepper (a whole one, pork) with the pork, too.  This was a satisfying meal.

This sauce is absolutely delicious! I didn't make the sauce for pork...we used chicken thighs instead and it was amazing! A new favorite in my house!

Very, very good.  The peanut-butter-coconut milk sauce was less sweet than I expected, the raw green onions, bell pepper and cilantro were a great addition and gave the dish a nice, fresh flavor.  The peanuts added a nice texture.  All of the components were excellent, but when I was eating this, I felt as though it was missing something.  I heated up some leftovers the next day and topped with a few drops of Chile sauce.  THIS is what these pork chops needed for me.  The extra heat brings out the sweetness of the sauce and adds another level of flavor.  The cayenne in the chops wasn't quite enough for us.  A little added spice took this from a strong 4* dish to a 5* in my house.  It's very tasty as is, but, the the addition of the Siracha took it over the top!

Made these last night and it was so good I wish I had doubled the recipe!  My four year old and wife loved them as well.  Followed the recipe exactly except used gluten free flour, which worked out just fine.  I will be making this again soon.

I made the recipe as directed. The sauce is kind of bland on its own. The cilantro, onions, peppers and peanuts give it a little more depth.

Love this recipe! I changed a couple of things because we are paleo eaters in our house. I swapped out the regular flour for almond flour (which gives it a great crust!), swapped peanut butter for almond butter, and pan fried them in coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. DELICIOUS!

WOWOWOW!!!!  This was awesome!  I added a bit of cumin to the sauce because I thought it needed it, but otherwise this was amazing!  Even the kids ate it.  It makes more sauce than you need; I'll probably 1/2 next time.  I served with brown rice and a tiny bit of sauce on the rice just to give it the flavor.  Spectacular!

If you are serving with rice you will want to AT LEAST double the sauce.  Next time I serve this (with jasmine rice) I am planning on 3X the sauce.  It was delish!

this was really good.  i added some fish sauce to it also.  sprinkled with the chopped green onion, cilantro and one sliced jalepano.  i didn't  have any nuts in the house, i think that would have really put it over the top.  i will make this again.  i also, doubled the sauce.

I made this for dinner tonight and we hought it was good, but not great. I'd give it a 3.5 stars, and I'm bumping that up to 4 because I made some small modifications that may have affected how I felt about the dish. I didn't really change  the recipe, but rather how I served it. I bought  thin, boneless fast fry chops and cut them into strips, and used all the other ingredients plus thin egg noodles to do a stir-fry. I doubled the sauce (I put a little bit less than double of the broth and coconut milk, and a little bit more than double PB and honey) partly because of the other reviews and because I was mixing the noodles right into it.  I might suggest to anyone wanting to do something similar to use rice instead or a thin spaghetti rather than the very fine egg noodles, because they got kind of mushy with the sauce (but that's of course not the fault of the recipe). This had good flavour though, but I think it's missing something I can't put my finger on. Even though I added more PB than called for it, I didn't taste it too much and I like a nice peanut buttery sauce. I also added more ginger when stir frying the pork as well as red pepper flakes, but it still didn't have any kick. I'm not a spicy food person, but I think maybe that's what I missed here, a lil kick. My fave part was the crunchy peanut and green onion topping - it was nice! (I didn't have any cilantro, maybe that also would add a lil somethin somethin to this). Overall, pretty good!

First time trying any Thai recipe.  Made for the family, and everyone really loved it.  Made exactly as written except doubled the sauce quantity.  Not spicy which works for kids.   Next time will add a bit of chili sauce as noted by another reviewer to bring up the 'kick' a bit. Made a brown rice and sesame snap peas as sides.

The toppings were critical.  Next time, I would use chicken instead of pork.  The pork chops I used were thick.  It took a long time to cook and they were hard to cut (difficult with having to cut all the kids meat).

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and only tweaked it ever so slightly. I used rice flour instead of AP flour and 5 thin cut pork chops instead (as that is what I prefer). My only "complaint" is that there wasn't enough sauce. I think the sauce is fantastic and I would be sure to double the sauce next time I make it!

The sauce is everything in this dish; I would have doubled the cayenne pepper (but that's just my taste).  I had someone with a wimpy spice pallat taste the sauce and he did not find it spicy too spicy.  Yeah...I'd say double the cayenne pepper.  I didn't have green onions, so I carmelized  brown onions...mm mm good!

I loved this, my hubby wasn't too keen on it thought it was a little too sweet. He ate it but I'll just have to try this with a little less sweetness for him.

Excellent! I substituted 1.5% milk for coconut milk and it was wonderful--so don't feel you must go buy coconut milk if you don't have it on hand. Highly recommend this dish!

I thought the sauce was a little weak, I made a lot of changes to it as I cooked it.  I did double the amount of sauce, to serve on the rice nooddles I made to go with the pork. 
I added 1 tsp lite soy sauce, about 1 tbls ginger(fresh) 1/2 tsp fish sauce, and 2 tbls chili sauce with garlic. But we do like things hot around here.
The recipe was a good starting point, but needed more flavor for me.  The pork was pretty good.

This was excellent!  I didn't want to make a trip to the store on the way home from work so I used what I had on hand at home.  I didn't have pork so I used chicken breast.  I didn't have fresh red bell pepper so I used roasted red bell pepper from the jar.  Everything else I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good.  Can lower the cal's a bit if you find some low fat coconut milk.  I find a good peanut butter makes the addition of more peanuts uneeded.

The sauce was good on the chops but even BETTER mixed into the rice!  I ended up mixing a little bit of red pepper, cilantro and green onion into the rice with the peanut sauce and that was the highlight for me!

This was decent, however, I thought the cumin was a bizarre spice for thai?  I had run out of cayenne, darn it, so I just went without.  I use organic peanut butter and chicken stock and sometimes I need to remember to salt a little bit heavier with those.  Pretty decent dish, but I would not make it if you don't have the peanuts, cilantro, onions and bell peppers.  They are the icing on the top.

Great base recipe! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cut the pork into small pieces, then used a zip-lock bag to shake the pork and spices. Served with rice noodles which were briefly stir-fried in with the pork. With the sauce, I added a bit more peanut butter and some freshly ground pepper. Thanks, JDOERINGPA!

This was ok. Kind of bland. I followed the recipe to the letter. It was alright but I don't know if I'll make it again. Not to say others wont like it, obviously they do. But personally, it just wasn't a "favorite". Thank you though.

This was so good!  My husband and I don't usually go for "sweet" dishes, but after seeing the reviews, we decided to try it.  It was worth it!  The flavors blend together so perfectly.  We just put the pork on a bed of rice and then poured the sauce over the top, garnished with about 5 red pepper strips and then the peanuts, cilantro, and onions.  It was a hit!  Definitely will make again.

I absolutely love peanut sauce and this sauce was amazing! We also used pork tenderloin instead of pork chops, and it was delicious! My fiance loved it and wants me to cook it frequently. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I have tried it and l love it. I made pretty much everything for this recipe myself. I had already made chicken broth so I used this instead of store bought. I made the coconut milk and roasted the peanuts. I have a ginger syrup leftover from when I tried making crystallized ginger. I used the syrup instead of honey. I was really pleased with the finished results. It had been a first for me in making coconut milk and crystallized ginger.

This was a great dish. However, if you are looking for something spicy, you have to add to it. Contrary to some comments in prior reviews, red bell peppers are not spicy.  We added some Siracha at the table - allowing each person to add heat to their taste.

The pork chop was good but the sauce was salty. I put two Tb of brown sugar to make it somewhat edible. I put the sauce on the side rather than pouring it on top of pork chop.

Yummy and easy to make. I cooked the red pepper and green onions in the sauce for a few minutes.

It cooled very quickly - I would keep the pork chops in a warm oven while the sauce was being made.

I loved this recipe so much! Tonight was my first time making it, so I made it with exact ingredients listed. The only thing that I did differently was to cut up the pork chops into cubes after browning and I added the sauce directly to the skillet with the pork (without removing the pork). Eat this over Jasmine rice. Very very good! I will definitely make this again!

I would have put 4.5 stars because really this recipe is very, very good ! Only surprise was that it was so mild - usually Thai cooking is pretty hot...
So I shall definitively recommand it and do it again but with more chili powder and onion greens or chives (but NO garlic please !). Also doesn't need the chicken broth if enough coco milk and spices.

This was exactly the type of dish I was looking for and was simple and delicious!  I cut the pork into strips and added the sauce right to it so it was nicely coated.  I also doubled the sauce and added more cumin and cayenne to it.  And I always try to add some extra greens so I wilted some spinach right into the sauce and served the finished product over some basmati rice.  Amazing!

Really liked the recipe. Pretty much followed all instructions, except I used chunky peanut butter therefore I omitted crushed peanuts. Will definitely make this again, next time might try adding a red chopped chilly to spice it up. Great easy, quick recipe!

Very delicious!  I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  Very good meal!

This had great flavor. Not real hot so if you like spicy I would add more red pepper to the sauce. I also served it over plain raman noodles.

Made the sauce as is and used left over pork tenderloin for the meat. I served it over rice with peppers/onions. It was tasty and a nice change.

Thought the flavor of the sauce was very nice and delicate and paired well with the raw red pepper.  We had linguini noodles with ours which was very nice.  I did not care for the meat.  Eight minutes for cooking 3/4 inch pork chops was not enough.  I cooked mine a lot longer and they were still pinkish in the middle.  The meat ended up tough and I really did not taste the spices on it.

This meal was AMAZING!!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used light coconut milk to save on fat and calories.  My husband and I both greatly enjoyed this meal!  I am not a huge fan of pork chops, so next time I will use either pounded out chicken breasts or pork tenderloin as another person suggested.  It was so good, I will be making this over and over.  I served it with the asian chicken salad (omitting the chicken) from this site and white rice.  Thanks for sharing this, we LOVED it!

5 stars because it was EASY, fast and delicious. Next time I will double the sauce to put on the rice. 
I loved that I could use all organic ingredients to make the sauce vs buying from a jar.
MMMmm. Will be adding to my list of faves.

I had to change quite a bit...I thought it was bland when I tried it as it cooked. So, I added more of every seasoning, then added minced garlic too. I left out the honey, thank goodness, plenty sweet without it. I tend to like my peanut sauces more spicy than sweet. The cilantro and chopped peanuts make it! YUM!

The sauce was great! I went more of a stir fry route with it - cubed boneless pork loin sprinkled with the cumin and cayenne. I skipped the flour and salt. Stir fry until cooked through then remove from heat. I also steamed some vegetables (carrots and broccoli) and stirred it all together with the sauce a few minutes before serving. I didn't use the peanuts or red bell pepper just because I didn't have any on hand. I doubled the sauce and it was just right. Serve over rice.  It was very tastey! Will make it again.

Made this a while back and we liked it. Made it again last night and it was a big disappointment. Didn't even bother to save the leftovers. Peanut taste was too mild and overall the dish lacked flavor. Too many other good recipes on here to try this one again.

This stuff was great.  The hubs initially wrinkled up his nose when I suggested it, but he loved it.  Like another reviewer, I used cream of coconut, about half the amount, since that is what hubs brought home.  I doubled the sauce for the two chops we had and had a little left over.  Used a little snack-pack of hot peanuts and one of honey-roasted peanuts.  No cilantro and we didn't miss it.  Added juice of half a lime.  Served over lo mein-style noodles.  We will be having this again.  Yum.

I don't care for red bell pepper so I left it out.  I added regular onions too.  The sauce was a dreary brown color but very tasty.  Next time I plan on sauting some jullienned carrots and adding to it.

YUM!  This was a really easy and delicious recipe.  I think it tasted very authentic.  I also doubled the yummy sauce recipe. I cooked the red pepper with the pork and served with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Next time, I will add some Thai chili paste to spice it up a bit!

This was really good, much better than the Thai restaurant down the street (and cheaper too!). I had a lingering single bone in chop, that I cut into chunks. I also used half a chicken breast (cooking in seperate pans). I did not bother with the red bell since they are so expensive, and used several packets of McDonalds sundae peanut's that I saved. I also used 1/2 tsp chicken bullion in the 1/3 cup water. Can't wait to find an excuse to make again!

As a novice cook, this was one of the most complicated recipes I've made, ingredients-wise.  And I was extremely happy with the results!  I didn't think I could make something that resembled the flavor of a Thai restaurant!  My boyfriend said it's one of his favorites now.  If you like spicy - I added about double the cayenne pepper just to kick it up a little.  I ended up cooking the red peppers after I cooked the pork and sprinkled them on top before adding the   peanut sauce.  Also, I did not have any cilantro and forgot to add the peanuts - it was still good!  Also used chunky peanut butter.  Give this recipe a try!

I changed this recipe to fit my busy life for the dy.  I used  pork loin and put all ingredients in a slow cooker for 4 hours on high and served over rice after pulling the loin apart.  Very delicious!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly but I served it with potatoes.  When I do this again, I will add a few more veggies, like broccoli, to make it a complete meal! :)

Nice peanutty sauce. I added a couple of cloves of garlic and a chilli on the advice of other reviewers which worked well. If I make it again I will add more chicken broth and less honey to make the sauce a bit runnier to coat noodles and a bit less sweet (my personal taste).

This recipe was really great! I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and instead of serving it with pork, I served it over chicken and rice noodles. It was delicious! Next time, however, I'll add garlic. This dish would be great for a small, informal dinner party!

This was very good. I doubled the sauce since I was cooking for 6 people. It was a bit too saucy for us, maybe next time I'll add an extra 1/2. I added thin sliced green zucchinni, bean sprouts, water chestnuts and a tsp. of fresh minced garlic to the sauce along with the red pepper and green onion as others had suggested. It came out fabulous. My boyfriend loves Thai food and he was raving about this one to his work buddies! :) Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! The only change I made was that I tripled the sauce measurements and poured some over the pork and the rest over cooked spaghetti noodles.  I served the pork on top of the noodles and drizzled more sauce over that. We ate it with a salad.
I will certainly be making this one again!

I really didn't think I would like this but we were in the mood for something different.  My husband says it's the best thing I've ever made.  Really restaurant quality.  He finished off the leftovers last night.  Really awesome recipe, thank you :)

This was so simple to make but I would do somethings differently I would add the red pepper and cilantro and green onions while the sauce was cooking.  I also like spicy thai food so I would add thai chili paste and would make more sauce because we ate it over brown rice.

Great recipe. We enjoy a lot of sauce over our rice, so, I put in a splash more of coconut milk and chicken broth.  Then, rather than using them to garnish the dish, I threw in the red bell peppers, cilantro, and green onions in the sauce for a minute to further infuse the flavors.  This will DEFINITELY be added in my recipe rotations!  Thanks!

While just finishing up on Whole30, I was able to adapt this recipe to keep me from returning to non-compliant foods; however, I needed to convince my husband I did so as it was THAT good!  How did I find this recipe? Even easier than making it...I typed in my leftovers - pork roast - and added ingredients I had on hand, including red peppers, scallions, and peanuts.  I knew then I could make the best version I could with what I had.   A keeper for us.

Love this recipe.!!! Because I always want to be sure the pork meat is well done, after frying it,I put it in the oven 20 minutes,  350F covered with aluminum. If it is well covered, doesn’t get dry. I served with white rice.

I had about 1.5 pounds of cubed pork tenderloin but this sounded good so I tossed the cubed pork in the flour/cumin/cayenne (instead of flour used 50% flour/50% cornstarch) and dried on paper towels.  I then made the  sauce (tripled it--which was too much, as some other reviewer said---next time will double it).  It really needs all the garnishes of red bell pepper, green onions, peanuts and cilantro.  It was REALLY good!  Only tossed the amount of meat that we were going to eat that night in the sauce and stored the sauce separate from the meat so it wouldn't get soggy.  Very good and different.  (Trader Joe's carries the coconut milk!)

Great recipe and sauce. My family loved it.  I made enough sauce to use all the coconut milk (quadrupled it?) and then froze what was leftover. I agree with the other reviews that said the green onions on top really added something to the flavor. Will make this one again.

This was amazing!  The hubby suggested I make it a go to recipe.  The only thing I added was some thai chili sauce and some lemon grass but that is because I bought it for some other recipe and wanted to find some way to use it.  To be honest, we didn't taste any of it so I think the recipe would have been great as is!  It wasn't very spicy for us so I will probably increase the cayenne pepper or more chili sauce next time.

I used all the ingredients but since I prefer to use my slow cooker for pork, I adapted the recipe.  I cooked the pork in my slow cooker on medium for about 4 hours in a vinegar and water solution.  Then I pulled it apart and placed it on the side.  I fried the peppers and green onions until wilted.  I added the shredded pork, peppers, and the rest of all the ingredients (I used chunky peanut butter though)  into my slow cooker and set it on low for one hour.  It was delicious!

We make this dish all of the time and LOVE it!! It always turns out better than what you could get at a restaurant. It has simple ingredients and is easy to make and doesn't require a lot of time. We always throw it over rice and it's so fantastic.

really good!  I doubled the sauce and used pork stew meat.  I followed recipe,  but followed another reviewer's suggestion and added the bell pepper after putting sauce to cook, then added the stew meat back into the sauce at the end for more of a saucy curry than a sauce covering.  I did not have the pepper flakes, so added chilli drops to the sauce at the end.  I served over rice.  Will make again!

This turned out to be really tasty. I added some chili garlic sauce to spice it up a bit.

I make this dish at least once a month...it's one of my husband's favorites!  I recommend doubling the seasoning and sauce.  I also use chicken in place of pork...maybe one day we'll try the pork, I usually have chicken on hand.

Delicious, easy and quick. I used pork loin and skipped the cilantro because my family fusses if they even smell it. I used lite coconut milk and more veggies because I like them. I made rice and doubled the sauce recipe. Everyone likes the seasoning on the chops. A little sesame oil would be a good addition. I served this with roasted Brussels sprouts.

Not bad.  I'm going to play with this one a little bit to get it closer to what I was looking for.  I ended up adding some fresh ginger to get the sauce the way I wanted it.   I agree with other reviewers that it does require some more heat, I'm adding red pepper next time.  I'm not a big pork eater, this has potential and worth another attempt.

Made this tonight! Sliced the pork thinly before cooking....as this is how the Thais would do it. Very very tasty!! My husband needed more red pepper flakes to spice it up. But it was perfect for me and the kids.

Nice flavor but for anyone who really likes Thai food this will be a big disappointment as it is very bland.  The seasoning in the flour seems a wasted effort as little or none of it comes through in the final dish.

I'm not a huge Thai food lover but boyfriend is. He would have prefered a bit more "kick" so would double the cayanne next time. In my opinion the ginger was too strong. Next time will cut ginger in half.  Will also double the sauce.

This is SOO good! Delicious! quick & easy to make. It also looks very pretty. This is one of my new favorite dishes! I would give it 6 stars, but if you werent a fan of peanut butter you may not enjoy it as much as my family.

Success on the home front.  I used tenderloin instead of chops.  I had no garnishes other than chives!  Did the trick.

Hmmm. Made this for dinner tonight. Neither my fiance or I cared for it, although he liked this more than I did.... I must say that the presentation is GORGEOUS tho! :) I followed JDOERINGPA's directions exactly. I thought about adding my bell peppers to my sauce (to soften), but am really glad I didn't. I enjoyed thier crunchiness, and, other than the green onion, peanut and cilantro garnishes, they are the only thing I liked about this dish. My fiance and I both disliked the peanut sauce. He thought it was too peanutty and I just didn't like it (I guess I'm not a peanut sauce fan...). As April B. did, I too used up a couple packs of McD's peanut sundae topping to sprinkle on top of my chops (great idea!). Tip: To keep your chops warm while preparing your sauce, place them in a baking dish and pop into a slightly warm (i.e. 200 degrees) oven. They won't overcook, but will retain their heat until serving time. Also, if you dredge your pork chops in a plastic Zip-lock bag (mix your flour / spices directly in bag beforehand), you'll have one less dish to clean! Carrot rice (Sowmya) and homemade Thai iced tea (sweet tea with a little half-n-half mixed in) was a nice complement. I LOVE Thai cuisine, but apparently not all of it. Oh well! Thanks anyways. :-)

I've only ever made pork chops one way, so I thought it high time I try something new.  I definitely picked the right recipe!  Wow!  These are great!  I followed the recipe to a "t" and the meat turned out perfectly moist.  The sauce was very mild in flavor, so those of you who like spice may want to kick it up a notch.  For my family, however, these were perfect.  I will definitely be making thes again!

I liked the many flavors in this and the crunch of the peanuts.  It actually was more work than what it seemed like it was going to be.  Maybe that is because my pork chops were too thick so they took forever to cook on the stove and it made our whole house smell like grease for 2 days.  Make sure you get the thinner pork chops without a bone!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty bland. The peanut sauce took a long time to thicken. I also found the coating on the pork chops didn't add anything to the dish.

Tasty sauce!  My pork was tough, but that is not the recipe's fault.  I left off the garnishes because we did not have those items, and I didn't want to make a special trip to the store for them.

This was good and I will make again.  Only changes I made was to sautee some garlic in the pan prior to add the sauce.  I also chopped the red peppers and added them and the scallions to the sauce one it had thickened to warm them up.  Next time I will increase the cayanne as I felt it need a bit more kick.  The husband loved it as is.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight to use up some pork chops.  I cut the bone out, made medallions, and fried them substituting garlic for the red pepper, and gluten-free flour for the all-purpose flour.  The peanut sauce was great, and I used light coconut milk to save a few calories.  Served over brown rice, with corn and green peas.  Great gluten-free dinner!  My 8-year-old wasn't a big fan of this.

Excellent!  Did change up a few things.  I added a little bit of sesame oil to the veg oil when frying the chops.  I added a little bit of soy sauce to the peanut sauce as well.  And left out the red pepper and cilantro.  We will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe! It is reasonably easy & tastes great.  Instead of toping the dish with the chopped peppers, onion, & cilantro, I added them to the sauce when it was simmering. I also served this over a bed of jasmine rice steamed along with some lemon zest & dried cranberries.  It's wonderful, I could eat this meal every night!

Oh Yeah!  This is so easy and so-o-o good!  I tossed a few dried cranberries into the sauce because I didn't have red pepper and I wanted to 'jazz' up the color of the entree a bit.  Left overs?  Works in a wrap with a bit of shaved lettuce and diced tomato.  Definitely a keeper!

The only change I made was to add minced garlic.  Since we ate this over rice, I doubled the sauce which worked out great!  Can't wait to eat the left overs.

This was so good.  I did not have coconut milk, but I did have cream of coconut.. which you use for drinks.  I used alot less of this and it still was wonderful!

Great recipe. I added some ground garlic to the flour mizture and used low fat peanut butter. I also doubled the recipe for the peanut sauce so that there was enough to serve over lo mein noodles.

Wow, what a surprise.  My husband must have told me 6 times how much he loved this.  I changed things up a bit. I cut a single half pound pork chop into very thin pieces and pan fried it.  I doubled the sauce.  If you actually use 4 pork chops, I would consider trippling or quadrupling the sauce. Lastly, I cut up the red pepper in tiny pieces and sauteed them first.  I added the cooked pork and red pepper to the peanut sauce and served it over rice.  Fantastic!  Don't leave out the onion and cilantro!

This was delicious and can be used for a week night meal. Only complaint is the small amount of chicken broth & coconut milk which leaves alot to waste. It would be nice if I had another recipe to use it on. I also threw the sliced red bell peppers in for the 2nd half of the pork's cooking time. Deliciouso!

My hubby and I made this with chicken instead of pork. It was fabulous! We'll definitely make this again!

This was very good.  Very tasty and quick to make.  Because my 5yr old doesn't like spicy food, I used less cayenne, but I would prefer it with more. I think I will also add a little more coconut milk next time so that there is more sauce! Everyone in the family loved it and I will definitely make it again.
