I usually don't rate recipes so low, but this recipe has TOO much butter.  I did reduce the quantity of butter, but the addition of more butter would NOT have made it a 5 star recipe. The base recipe is a good idea but needs work.

This was sooo Good! This will be made again.  I did make a few changes.  I added chicken with the Shrimp and sausage.  I also used Half and Half to cut on the calories and not as much butter.

Made this for Mardi Gras-DELICIOUS!  Used the smoked andouille sausage which gave it a great flavor, and went a little heavier on the veggies.  This recipe is definetely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this!!! Kinda makes me wish I was down in New Orleans! I ended up making some changes though. We did not have sausage or mushrooms on hand, so instead I cut up 4 oz of Mahi Mahi fish, and 4 oz of Salmon and cooked it along with the shrimp. I also added some lots of Red Onions and Jamacian Jerk seasoning made by Tones (to taste) and only used about 2 tablespoons of butter instead. Turned out great! Oh I also added a pinch of frest cilantro and extra parsley. Yum! Will make again

Wow! So great! My husband loved it as well. I added more sausage and shrimp than was called for and I think it was a good change. No ingredient was overpowering everything was perfect! You will love it and if you are a new cook and wife like me this is the meal for you! Awesome!

AWESOME! I omitted the butter at the end, and used more of all the other stuff (except the heavy cream and lemon juice). I just went w/ how I wanted it to be, but used all of the ingredients...this was sooo simple, tasty and it really made enough sauce for 1 pound of pasta (I used rotini, which was selected by my little guy). I was glad that I chose this recipe for my first time using andouille sausage! I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

really good pasta, I will make only a few adjustments next time I make it... I will put more sausage and more shrimp,  and maybe leave the shrimp whole or halved.  I may also try to cut down on fat by using fat free half and half and a butter spread.

Very very good. I sauteed ALL the veggies in butter and then added then to the sauteed meat. I also added chicken and shrimp. This is a definite winner. YUM

This was delicious! I added more veggies and sausage. I used chorizo, half n half, added a bit of basil and only used about 1/4 cup butter in the beginning, none at the end. It was so delicious! I can't wait to make again :-) Thank you!

Very easy pasta dish!  I didn't have many of the ingredients so I substituted where I had to, and used this recipe as a base. I didn't have sausage or shrimp, so I just used bacon.  I didn't have white wine, so I substituted equal amount of lemon juice.  I also used 1% milk instead of heavy cream.   To balance the flavour I lack, I added fresh rosemary and parmesan cheese along with the cold butter.   The result was still very good and satisfying dish - I can't wait to make this again when I have all the ingredients.

I made this accordingly last night. I almost had a heart attack while eating it from all the butter and cream, not to mention all the meaty goodness. Idc...I DIE! Will keep making this until I do anyway. Good job!

My family thought this recipe was awesome! I added diced chicken, extra sausage and tomatoes, and substituted Half & Half for heavy cream.  The flavors blended deliciously and I'll definitely add this to the rotation.

Excellent recipe.  However, I will cut the butter in half next time and add more shrimp and bell pepper.

Loved this recipe, will definitely make it again. There were no leftovers! Hubby and son approved! I did substitute hot Italian sausages. And I didn't have white wine so I used some vodka instead. Also used less butter. Still creamy and delicious.

I have made this 4 times now with only a few changes. I absolutely love this recipe. All changes are based on my own personal preferences. I omit the mushrooms and shrimp and exchange the green onion for sweet onion. I have problems with textures so I puree the onion, peppers, and tomato to make a smoother sauce. I also fry the Andouille in a separate pan. I felt that cooking everything in with it made it too mushy. My family and coworkers love it.

This is our new favorite! I used a can of cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have any mushrooms on hand. This enabled me to use a little less cream. I didn't use any wine either. Yummy!!!

DELICIOUS!!!  However, way too much butter. Next time I make it I won't include the last 1/2 cup of butter at the end.  I added onions and one whole fresh jalapeno chopped, cause I'm a Louisiana girl and no dish is complete without onions, and jalapenos are always appropriate :)

Excellent.  Thumbs up from the whole family, even the picky anti-pepper people.  Would make it again.  Added chicken as well.
