these were a big hit at our barbeque. several people asked for the recipe. we used vidalia onions and prepared them the night before with the marinade. they were a little tricky on the grill because of the dripping bacon fat, but well worth the effort.

Great marinade!  I didn't have hickory smoked bacon, so I splashed it with hickory flavored liquid smoke.  I also grilled (with the marinade)it in a foil packet flipping it every 5 minutes.  The onions were soft & the bacon was tender (but cooked) just like my husband likes it, great with steaks.  Thanks SLM!

Yum!  I marinated the onion/bacon bundles in the refrigerator overnight, baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes, then they went on the grill.  My guests raved!

Really delicious!!  Great with grilled steak kabobs.  The only thing I change is I don't cut the bacon in half, it makes it easier to wrap around the onion.

Mmmmm these were DELISH! I made these while we were camping, I used a whole piece of bacon instead 1/2 piece & also used a sheet of foil over the grill.

Fabulous. I also did not cut the bacon in half--but I also cooked them in the oven for about 40 minutes on 350 and they were great. I used a shallow baking dish and propped the skewers up on the edges to the fat could drip down into the pan--it worked out great. Many compliments.

These were an instant hit!!!  The marinade/sauce is so simple.  I couldn't eat enough of these.  These were such a great new way to enjoy onions with my steak.  
I had no problem with the bacon drippings causing flare ups.  I found that the wedges with more than 3 layers of onion didn't allow the inner part of the wedge to cook thus a nearly raw tasting onion in the center.  I plan to keep the wedges smaller and not so thick.  I can't wait to make them again!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!  I used regular vinegar, and it was still great.  I also cooked them in the oven and then just heated them up on the camp fire.  great.  Tastes like baked beans

I didn't care for these.  When I tried to turn them, the bacon was falling off the onions.  The flame was very high from the bacon grease falling in.  They cooked very quickly!  Much quicker than 20 minutes.  The bacon was scorched... I don't recommend this recipe.

The flavor of these grilled onions was not out-standing.  I, also, had problems with cooking.  As the onions cooked and softened, they slipped out of the bacon as I turned them.  I finally sprayed a cast iron skillet with Pam, set it directly on the grill and transfered the onion there (removing the wooden picks).  I poured the marinade over all and then stirred frequently.  I had high hopes for this, as grilled onions are a favorite with us...and I love bacon.  However, I would have to recommend the Grilled Onions recipe found on this site and not this recipe.  The other recipe is much simpler and always turns out great.

These are absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  I tend to make about 6-8 onions worth of these, they go that quickly. I omitted the molasses after the first time I made them it seemed everyone preferred them without it.  I make these at every BBQ we have & they are always gone within minutes!! A+++

Dad and I made this for my little brother's graduation party...they tasted great.  Had no trouble with the bacon, although the flame did get a little high because of the grease and the cooking time wasn't the full 20 minutes...about 10-15.  Thanks for the recipe...great.

These are so good.  I also used a whole piece of thick cut bacon (I didn't see the part about cut in half).  I only had time for them to marinade for about 30 minutes, and we grilled on indirect heat.  We only lost one piece of bacon to the flames, but the crispy pieces were the best.  My only complaint was after 30 minutes my onions were still not done.  I will try using a smaller onion next time as well as cutting the bacon in half.  I used the molasses and wouldn't leave it out as I think the sweatness is what made this so great.

I tried this the first time at a barbeque about 1 year ago, and it went so good that I was asked for the recipe from about 10 people. I, since have made this about 15 times for various functions both in my community and my family, and have given out the recipe and the site about 60 times.

This was addicting!  I did not have a problem with the onions.  I cut the onions in wedges and wrapped each wedge with 1/2 slice of bacon, then put a toothpick through the outside layer of the onion straight through to the inner layer.  Every onion stayed in place.  I also baked them in the oven first.  Then put them in a foil pan, carried them to a barbeque at a park and re-heated them on the grill.  It was great.  We hardly had enough for the table....they were eaten at the grill!

This were really good but I also had a problem with
flame-ups from all the bacon drippings.  I think a
good idea was to bake them first.  That way the bacon has a chance cook before putting it on the grill.  Although some people said they just baked them in the oven without grilling them at all and they were good.  Either way, these are very tasty.  I also used a whole piece of bacon on each wedge and that seems to keep the wedges together better.

WOW...were these awesome!!  We could have made a meal of these alone. The flavor was great and we had no trouble grilling them (our grill has a "tent" over the burner to prevent flare-ups).  Everyone huddled around the grill waiting for the next batch to finish...thanks for the great recipe.  This is a new favorite!

Utilizing the info from other reviewers, I used regular cut bacon and baked them for about 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  They got very black, very quickly on the grill, however.  I am going to try again, but next time I will grill them over indirect heat.  These have potential!

These were just OK.  I probably won't make again.  The bacon did make the fire on the grill flame up and burn them, and I watched them carefully.  I only used three layers of onion in my chunks, as another reviewer suggested and they still were not even close after 20 minutes.  I'm a little sad.  The 3 stars are for the flavors, they blend beautifully, but I might try the flavors in a different dish altogether.  Thanks for the recipe, Southern Living.

I was going to cook these on the grill as the recipe states, but it was so hot today, I decided to do them in the oven. I sliced the onion wedges quite thinly, and wrapped them in half a slice of regular bacon. I used half the amount of molasses and sugar, and they were ready in about 25mins. They didn't look particularly appetizing, but they tasted delicious! Will definitely be making them again. Thanks!

Great recipe! Because of fear of flare-ups, hubby covered the grill grate w/ foil & then cooked the onions on it. The glaze ran off the foil & did cause a small flare-up so that was smart thinking on his part. Be warned...these are not a finger appetizer, you'll need a knife & fork to eat these.  Next time, I will try cutting the wedges & the bacon in smaller pieces & skewer them w/ toothpicks & see if they can't be just popped in your mouth that way. Everybody loved these...thnaks!
