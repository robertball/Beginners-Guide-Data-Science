My whole family really liked it BUT, we changed a whole lot. I am sure it tastes great as is. But we are trying to cut out all refined sugar and vegetable oils. so I substituted a banana and coconut oil. Smelled like banana nut bread while baking and had excellent flavor. We ate almost all of it in a day so now I am making a double batch today (not even 24 hours since the last batch)

Delicious, simple and quick to make. Wow, I have not bought store-made cereal since discovering this recipe. I double the recipe because it goes really fast and eliminate the sugar because it doesn't really need it. Sooo good!

Me and Chef John have a difference of opinion on what the finished product should be.  I guess he was making a loose granola that could only be used as a topping.  While I was looking for a granola that would set into big pieces that could be grabbed as a snack to go.  When I realized this granola was not setting in the oven I started topping with honey and then light corn syrup when the honey ran out.  I added enough to get the effect but I will go back to my old recipe.  Also, I always bake with the dried fruit mixed in, I actually like it better.  The fruit plumps and sticks to the oat mixture when you bake it in.

Very tasty, a little on the sweet side so next time I might try to reduce the amount of maple syrup. I'll definitely make it again.

this recipe is my favourite! I make double so it lasts longer and I eat it with yogurt and berries. instead of maple syrup, I put water to make it a little healthier. if you still want the sweetness from the syrup, half of each is also good enough. the recipe is a much healthier alternative compared to the granola you buy in stores. I also add sunflower seeds and cranberries because my brother is allergic to all nuts.  I love this recipe and so does my family.

I've used various types of nuts.  Couldn't find unsalted pumpkins seeds so used salted pumpkin seeds and did not add salt.  Since making it quite a few times, I change the currants to chocolate chips or raisins - always adding after the mixture is still hot but not in the oven.  Excellent.  I also use gluten free oatmeal and give as gifts to my gluten intolerant friends.

I skipped the currants, replaced the pumpkin seeds with sunflower, replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil, and put it over yogurt and fruit as suggested. It was superb.

Wonderful, not too sweet.  Used pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts (didn't have almonds), used raisins (next time will likely double raisins or add cranberries too).  omitted coconut. Family loved it.  Used as a snack, mixed with yogurt and topped ice cream with it.

Yummy!  I made this as the recipe as written and I'm so pleased!  Next time I'm going to add cinnamon.  Really easy and it makes just the right amount of granola.

This was great! I added cinnamon and cayenne pepper when adding spices. I will not purchase my favorite granola at the local market again because I will be making it. It is addictive. I will try the banana later on. Thanks for sharing!

I love this granola recipe and will never buy again.  Weening my husband off cakes and pies seemed impossible until I found Chef John.  Yogurt parfaits fill the need for him.  Go figure.  I changed out vegetable oil for coconut oil.   You can put almost anything in this.  Iâ€™ve used fake syrup and real syrup.  Both tasty.  I make two batches every week. 

Thank you, Chef John for sharing this recipe. You could be a life saver!!

UPDATE:  since my original posting in October, I have made 2 batches every single week.  This is hands down the best granola recipe.

This granola is delicious and super-easy to make. And it's pretty economical, too, if you buy from the bulk foods section of the supermarket (I think the coconut cost me 22 cents).

I followed the tips from the latest reviewer (adding banana and coconut oil instead of sugar and oil)  It was very good.  It would have been too sweet for me with the added sugar.  Great recipe and lots you can do with it.

I was shocked at how good this recipe was when I Meade it minus the nuts and minus the fruit. The flavor was great. I actually doubled the ingredients except for the sugar, in addition to omitting the nuts and fruit. I cooked it in 2 trays and it was done in under and hour. I'm sure the original recipe was fantastic but I needed to bring it to a party where nut allergies are a problem. Overall great recipe.

Great, flexible recipe.  I actually think it has less sweetener than most, which is a plus.  I am going to try to cut down on the brown sugar next time to see if it is still good with less sugar...

This smells AMAZING while cooking!
I think this is pretty much my favourite thing I've ever made! however, I did add extra coconut, still tastes amazingly good :)
