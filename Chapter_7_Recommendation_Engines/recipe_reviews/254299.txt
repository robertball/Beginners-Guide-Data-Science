This is yummy but donâ€™t let it set out before cutting it. It melted very fast. It said to freeze 4 hours. I did for 6. Overnight might be better. I will try that next time.

The recipe said to top with strawberries and Redi Whip and serve immediately. I had kept it in the freezer overnight and it was really frozen solid. I think I should have let it soften for 10 or 15 minutes before serving. Never the less, everyone raved about it.
