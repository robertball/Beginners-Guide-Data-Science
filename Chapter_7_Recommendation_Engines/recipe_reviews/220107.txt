Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe. I wanted to make something new for breakfast today...and this certainly hit the spot. The entire family loved this, and was easy to make. The only thing I changed was using my griddle for all the toast at a time, rather than 1 at a time in a skillet. A+++

This was really good, and not hard to make. I think the time estimate is pretty accurate. The cream cheese filling was grainy from the sugar, not smooth and creamy like I had expected, but it was still good. Definitely take the serving size seriously here! It is very rich and sweet, and I cannot imagine eating more than 1/8 of this recipe (one half sandwich).

A quote from my 8 & 12 year old "this is off the hook good mom" "can you please make it for us again". This was a huge hit by all.

I did make a couple changes as well. First I used frozen peaches,  all I had. I loved the fruit topping! You don't need any syrup. Actually, I tried some syrup with too and didn't like the way it changed the flavor! 

I also addes some cinnamon to the egg mixture,  seemed to just go perfect with the peaches.

Next I used confection sugar with the cream cheese which made it smooth. I also spread the cream cheese on one slice of bread then topped it with second slice and then cut the bread diagionally. Seemed a bit easier. 

I too used more than 8 slices, I think we used 13. I still had egg mixture left. I made baked oatmeal the next day with it, it was yummy too.

We totally forgot to use the whipping cream on top, it was so good even without it.

This was awesome - thanks for sharing your recipe!

yum!  i made this for myself and my 1 year old, who doesn't eat much refined sugar.  i replaced the sugar with half the amount of maple syrup everywhere it was called for.  i also used frozen strawberries because that's what i had on hand and omitted the whipped cream.  even with these modifications, this is a 5 star recipe!  (but i'm sure it would look a lot prettier with the powdered sugar and whipped cream on it :)

What a hit! My husband ate double the helpings, and he is not a sweet tooth breakfast kind of guy!! I used powdered sugar in the cream cheese filling, and we had enough filling and eggs for 12 slices! We had no whipping cream, but we didn't miss it. I think we'll try it next time with blueberries :)

My family could not get enough of this!  2 things though,  I think this would be better with thicker texas cut bread and I think the egg mixture could be reduced by half as I had a lot left over. I followed the recipe exactly and it is a keeper!

All combined, this recipe is really, really good and very hard for anyone not to like it, especially if you love sweets.  That being said, I must say that I was less than impressed with the strawberry sauce.  It was pale, opaque, and tasted more like sugar and cornstarch than it did strawberries.  I tried adding red food coloring, but stopped after it became apparent that I was going to have to add more than desirable.  Iâ€™m thinking frozen strawberries might work better for the sauce, but there are better strawberry sauces out there.

Absolutely delicious!  I cut back a little on the sugar in the cream cheese filling and used fresh sour dough bread, and boy was it good!

Awesome! Made a few changes: confectioner's sugar instead of regular sugar for mixing w/ the cream cheese (light); bananas and pancake syrup on top instead of strawberries. I used Martin's whole wheat potato bread-fiber and protein! Thanks for the recipe.

I hollowed out bakery hamburger buns and stuffed them with the filling and topped them with the strawberries. I did add cinnamon to the eggs. My family LOVED this!

Oh good Lord. YUM. That's about all I can say. I had cream cheese stuffed french toast once in my life at IHOP, and this recipe is right on par with it. This is so simple to prepare and cook, and it looks very elegant when it's all put together. Like a lot of people said, this french toast is very filling and one little triangle of this will probably do the trick to fill you up, especially if you serve it with coffee, juice, or fresh berries on the side. I thought I would add this note: To cut a few calories, you can also just spread light cream cheese or Neufchatel cheese between the slices of bread instead of mixing in the sugar/vanilla mixture, and instead of putting butter in the pan to brown the toast, use a no calorie PAM spray and leave out topping your toast with whipped cream. Absolutely wonderful recipe. I will be making this again!

A great stuffed french toast recipe that doesn't need to soak for hours or bake for a long time.  Results were fantastic and easy to do all at once  on an electric griddle.  I used homemade strawberry rhubarb sauce inside the "sandwiches" and served on top.  French bread makes big fluffy servings, but regular bread works well also.  Very adaptable to any fruit on hand.  Thanks for sharing a great idea!

We liked this recipe, but I wasn't as overwhelmed as I thought I would be.  I also had leftover milk/egg mixture and cream cheese filling.  Made some extra toasts, then scrambled eggs.  The filling oozed out and made it not look too pretty.  My strawberry sauce didn't thicken much--I would bring to full boil next time.  I used our whole wheat bread that we always have.  I am sure I could tweak this and with some practice it would be awesome, but we just don't eat unhealthy all that often.  I made this to use up a bulk of strawberries from our garden, and it did the trick.  Thanks for submitting!  Oh, I originally forgot the confection's sugar--it really made a difference (improvement) when I added.  I left off whipped cream.

I made this for my kids on Valentine's Day. It was AMAZING! They all said it was the best french toast they'd ever had. I completely agree. I made it exactly the way it was written. I wouldn't change a thing! I will be making it again soon!

I made this the other night, my husband was weary, he kept saying just make regular french toast and to his dismay it was so very very good! He ate 3rd's maybe even more. The kids all ate it up too there were NO left overs and they are already asking for it again! Great recipe! I used frozen fruit for the topping, it's what I had on hand so it was a mixture of pineapple, mango, strawberries and peaches. Smashed them up while cooking and it was a very tasty topping!

Really good, made it last weekend and my boyfriend demanded it again for his birthday this weekend. He says this is best yet, even better than the baked creme brulee french toast.

I followed the recipe as is and it tasted exactly like I expected: a french toast strawberry cheesecake.  I actually liked it with maple syrup more so than with the strawberry glaze (but that's just me).  I think this would be a fun Saturday morning breakfast for kids.

Holy moly! This recipe is great! I made these as a surprise breakfast for my boyfriend. He cannot stop
talking about them. He also said he can't eat regular french toast anymore because nothing compares to this. I agree with another reviewer A++ recipe. Yum!

Very easy to make! The whole family loves it, it's perfect to make for breakfast on weekends. And if you don't want to make the strawberry glaze that goes along with it, regular syrup is just fine!

Absolutely the Best French toast recipe you will ever find! My children would not eat French toast until I made this recipe. I have had to share the recipe with every person who I have made this for. So easy to make all at once on the griddle. The syrup is fantastic as well. You can use any berry you prefer. Yumm yumm!

This was delicious! I made these for my daughter's 30th Bday breakfast and everyone loved them. After reading comments from others I decided to use powdered sugar (1/2c) with the lowfat version of crm cheese so it wasn't gritty. I used 1.5T & 3/4 c water to thicken the strawberry glaze and used French bread. I used a few less egg yolks and added more egg whites to reduce the cholesterol. Had enough egg/milk mixture left over to make several slices of traditional French toast. This will definitely remain in my recipe box! Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my new favorite french toast.  I made small changes...I used 1/2 cup of sugar in the cream cheese mixture which made it pefectly in the sweetness factor.  I also used french bread, but there was so much cream cheese that I ended up needing 12 slices.  I also had an opened can of blueberry pie filling and it just made the morning.

This was absolutely fabulous!  Made it for Sunday brunch for my brother and his wife and there wasn't a crumb left!  Followed the recipe exactly and the strawberry glaze was perfect.  Used cheap white bread and it was still delicious!

My family absolutely loved this! Made just as the recipe called for. The only change I might make next time is to cut down on the eggs or milk. Seemed like a lot left over after making the french toast. Either that or make more french toast!!

What a glorious way to start your day! I made it exactly as written. At least on my oven, it took much longer than 5 minutes for the strawberry sauce to thicken. Other than that, perfection. For what it's worth, there was PLENTY of strawberry sauce, as well as the cream cheese filling. (I spread the cream cheese fairly thinly on both sides of the triangle!) Thank you.

This was sooo yummy! I used more fresh strawberries for the sauce than called for, and didn't bother with the whipped cream or powdered sugar.  I also used cheap sliced bread, and put a little bit of flour in egg mix - also some cinnamon as you can't have french toast without cinnamon!  Definitely substitute powdered/icing sugar for the white sugar in the cream cheese, makes it smooth.  For those who think this might be too sickly sweet, I found this to be less sweet than using traditional maple syrup.  Highly recommended and fairly easy to make

Amazing.  Made this for my girlfriend and I and be forewarned:  This is RICH.  That being said, it was delicious and we weren't able to finish half of the recipe between the two of us...definitely a repeat.

For the most part I made the recipe as was. The only thing I changed was I used powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture because many of the reviewers complained about it having a grainy texture. Mine came out perfect! Nice and smooth and creamy.

All I can say is delicious. I mean deeeeelllllliiiicccciiiooouuussss. When it was time to stir the sugar in the cream cheese I didn't use as much because I knew it was going to be to sweet. I just use 2/4 cups instead. I put the cream cheese in the microwave for 10 seconds to soften it so it can spread better. When I tell you every Fridays morning my family request this for breakfast over anything. Great recipe

Oh myâ€¦ simply decadent, I would say! I made it today for Easter breakfast and it was a hit! My family absolutely, positively loved it! I tweaked it a bit though. I used only four eggs, added cinnamon to the egg mixture and added powdered sugar to the cream cheese instead of granulated sugar. These were so yummy! I definitely will make again, thank you!

Oh my goodness! I'm sure I've never rated any food items but i had too rate this! I don't even like French toast abs it was amazing. I replaced the granulated sugar in the cream cheese mix with powder sugar and used Texas toast but did everything else the same. Fantastic! If you're on the edge of whether or not you should make it, definitely do! Amazing!

I tried this recipe and it came out great.  I ended up using challah bread and it worked perfectly and turned out to be the best french toast i have ever made and also the i have ever tasted.  This all cooks pretty fast if you prep stuff the night before.  You can also try using banana's on top instead of strawberries.  I also dusted the top with cinnamon in addition to the powdered sugar.

Although a bit overwhelmingly sweet the first time I made this (i made this for 4 triangle sandwiches instead of 8) so while i cut the sugar to suit for the strawberry glaze.. I got a bit side tracked and failed to cut the sugar for the cream cheese mixture.. OOPS! Toothache city sweet.. So the second time I did NOT forget and results were so much better.. Loved it and can't wait to make it again.

I wanted to take a picture but they were eaten too fast. No white sugar for us, but I did use powdered sugar for both strawberries and cream cheese mixture. YO. So good. Regular weekend rotation.

Very tasty! The only changes I made was using less sugar; I used powdered sugar in the cream cheese frosting and granulated sugar in the strawberry compote. I also added cinnamon and pure vanilla extract to the egg mixture and pure vanilla extract to the cream cheese frosting.

I used powdered sugar in place of sugar.  I cut down the milk ALOT, probably only 1/3 cup of milk!!! Just made it like normal French toast.  I used homemade strawberry jam instead of the strawberry topping, why mess with making jam when I already had it made!!!  No whipping cream needed! Nor did we have any! We used left over cheesecake middle to add to the top also, I may not have stuffed mine as full as suggested! So very delish!!!  Mine made 9 1/2 full sandwiches, I used all the egg up.

Delicious! Be sure to follow the comment tip about using powdered sugar in the cream cheese part rather than granulated that the recipe calls for. Also be sure to bring strawberry sauce to a near boil to make it thick and darker red. If you donâ€™t, it will be thin and watery. Also you donâ€™t need six eggs. I used 4 and it was more than enough.

I liked the  individual components of this recipe .  The cream cheese mixture and the strawberry compote. But the French toast concept is a bit too  mushy for me.   I rather just make cheesecake!  or bread pudding.  But for those people who love French toast, this may be ideal for you.

My family really liked this.  I only changed minor things, such as using 4 eggs and 3/4 milk for the dip (and I still had some left over)  and I made 12 sandwiches and had plenty of filling.  I cooked at 300 degrees on my griddle and I was able to cook them all at  the same time, so I didn't use the oven.  I cooked them for about 6-8 minutes per side to make sure all of the egg was cooked--I'm not a fan of soggy french toast, but that wasn't a problem.

This is delicious!  I made the strawberry glaze and the filling  ahead to streamline morning prep.   Also used a large electric skillet and was able to do all the pieces at once.  It was the perfect use for my fresh strawberries.    Beautiful presentation dusted with confectioners sugar, a few sliced berries and a sprig of fresh mint.   Everyone loved it!!!

This was good but really sweet. I found the directions a little unclear as to how much cream cheese  to spread on each piece and subsequently had a bunch left over but that just meant more French toast!  I will make this again but cut way back on the sugar.

Made this today and it was absolutely delicious and pretty simple to make. I did use powdered sugar with the cream cheese instead of regular and added a little cinnamon to the eggs. I also used Sara Lee artesano bread, but any thicker bread will do. Definitely a show stopper.

Enjoyed it very much, especially the grandson. Used Sara Lee's artisan bread and the confectioners sugar as recommended.  I did cut back a little bit on sugar and glad of it.  Husband recommended blueberries next time and cant wait to try it for whole family on our beach vaca.

It was delicious. I used a combination of fresh strawberries and frozen mixed berries to make the sauce.
Also, I made chocolate cream cheese.
The crowd went wild

A big hit for Motherâ€™s Day Brunch! To prevent any chance of serving uncooked egg between toast, I grilled the bread slices individually then spread the filling between two whole grilled slices and cut the sandwiches diagonally.  I made the sauce as directed and though it was tasty enough  next time I will simply serve the toast with mashed strawberries and sugar. I donâ€™t think the cooking and thickening added to the flavor or texture of the berries. I substituted powdered sugar in the filling as other reviewers suggested.  Perfect!  I will definitely make this again for brunch. Itâ€™s like dessert but everyone ate it first before the eggs! Life is sweetâ€”eat dessert first!

I made most of it the night before (to save time). I put together the triangles of bread with the cream cheese spread between two triangles and pre-made the strawberry sauce. (I re-heated it in the morning). It was  delicious! Just what we needed for a sweet fix!

I followed the recipe and my husband and I loved this French Toast. However,  I will reduce the number of eggs and the milk, since I have used just 3/4  of this mix. I think, next time I will mix 4 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk. Also, I  would sprinkle pecans on top of the strawberry glaze: Yummy!!!

Made this for my mum for mother's day. She loved it! I lowered the sugar a bit because we don't like things too sweet, but my mother thought it was even better than restaurant quality! I bake often, so I used homemade whipped cream. My mum said it was the best mother's day breakfast she's had. Served beside a scone in the photo.

P.S. I used a griddle, rather than a skillet, for faster cooking (:

It was wonderful and  Iâ€™ve already been asked to make it again (after 2 days).  Visiting daughter in Japan where fresh strawberries are much too espensive.  Heated some strawberriy preserves to use instead and it was terrific.

This recipe was amazing! I made it for my mom and dad on Mother's day and everyone loved it. It took me a very long time but that was because I am a begginer and I also made homemade jam instead of the glaze. I used the Strawberry Jam recipe from Allrecipes by Katharine  I put the jam in between the samdwich so it wasn't just cream cheese and I think it made it better.

It was very good but next time I would lower the amount of sugar added to the cream cheese filling as I found too sweet.
Also, this recipe yielded 12 sandwiches instead of 8. The strawberry glaze was enough for 12 sandwiches too.

Easy & delicious.  I halved all the sugars and it was plenty sweet and flavorful.  Made getting up on a weekday easier for Dad and the teenagers.  A very pretty & presentable recipe for company or special occasion like Mother's Day (hint. hint.)

This is very good! But I did some changes after reading others review. I added the water cornstarch to the sauce pan with the strawberry.  The other change was using confectionar sugar with the cream cheese, this make them smooth. Then topped it with walnuts and whip cream with maple syrup. (this is personal preference) This is so delicious that you can made them with any fruit, next time I will incorporate part of the fruit to the cream cheese. But you can use any fruit, this recipe is a keeper.

Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast and Bellini's  will now be part of our Father's Day brunch every year - Fantastic. We used croissant's sliced in half instead of bread slices.

This was delicious! Very very sweet though! I'd definitely recommend having this as a side rather than the main part of your breakfast. My girlfriend the gritty cream cheese problem by mixing that part in a bowl surrounded by hot water in my sink.

Absolutely delicious, I used raspberries rather than strawberries out of personal preference.  I also substituted for powdered sugar in the cream cheese.

I will add a little salt to the milk and egg mixture. Maybe to the cream cheese as well. I used peaches instead of strawberries, because that was all that I had. It still turned out great. I bet you could use blueberries, blackberries, apples, etc, as well.

So yummy!  My husband and I really loved these for breakfast!  I pretty much went by the recipe except changed a few things around.  First I used powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture instead of sugar.  I also halved the egg/milk mixture since it made plenty enough for 10 slices of bread.  I also always add in a pinch of cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla in with the egg mixture.  I also did not do the step of layering the bread with the cream cheese mixture before cooking.  I dipped the bread slices and made the french toast on our griddle like normal, that way both slices of french toast are cooked up.  Then I layered with the cream cheese between each piece, and layered with the rest of the toppings.  These were super yummy and filling.  Thank you for the recipe!

I normally dislike French toast, as it always seems to taste like bland, soggy bread, but this recipe was superb! I halved the recipe and still had enough of the egg-milk and cream cheese mixtures to make 8 sandwiches, so possibly the servings are a bit off? I used around 3/4 of the sugar called for and it was just sweet enough. Will definitely be making this again!

I followed the recipe for the French toast pretty closely. However I used only three eggs and a half a cup of milk to coat a total of eight pieces and that was plenty as I hate wasting. Although you could use that egg batter and make some scrambled eggs. Also I found a different recipe for the strawberry syrup sauce as I didn't have any cornstarch. You basically can use the same recipe here without cornstarch additionally I put sliced strawberries in between the pieces of bread with the cream cheese. I would like a griddle to do several pieces at one time however I had to do what the suggested and do one piece at a time and storm in a warm oven. You don't need three minutes per side. I also used in artesian bread so is that it was a thicker denser bread

I made this using Dave's Good Seed bread. 
I halved all the sugar in the recipe and substituted confectioners sugar for granulated sugar in the cream cheese. There was enough cream cheese mix and egg/ milk mix to use ~12 slices of bread. I also used frozen mango cubes instead of strawberries--what I had on hand. Also, no whip.
This was a hit with everyone.

This was a hit for Mother's Day, with a couple of changes.
Added homemade strawberry jam to the cream cheese to add strawberry flavor.    Added some red food color to the glaze to improve the color.   Cooked the French toast separate to get some crust on both sides.  Assembled cream cheese cheese between two slices of French toast, and topped with glaze, whipped cream , sliced fresh strawberries and powder sugar

Next time I will let the French toast cool just a minute so it will not melt the cream cheese and whip cream so fast

Yum! Best French Toast I have ever made. Tastes just like you are eating a cheesecake. I did put a bit of powdered sugar in place of some of the white sugar in the cream cheese mix, but the rest stayed the same. I did have a lot of egg wash left over - you could probably get away with only half the amount. This is definitely on my make again list.

Whole family loved it, including my picky 14 & 11 year old daughters.  I used thick slices of egg twist bread, and it held up very well. I kept the slices whole, and not cut diagonally, and didn't spread the filling to the very edges, so no leakage of the filling while cooking. For the strawberry sauce, next time I'll use 1 lb. of fresh strawberries, but keep the rest of the sauce ingredients the same. Based on other reviews, I used confectioner's sugar in the cream cheese filling (1/2 cup), and cinnamon in the egg dip. Also, 4 eggs and 3/4 milk was enough. The pieces cooked beautifully in a cast iron pan. Added Reddi Whip topping for a nice presentation. There was one piece left, and I'm sneaking it right now! Thanks. Pamela, for the great recipe!

Tried this recipe this morning and it was wonderful.  Not to sweet like some of them. I used a cinnamon raisin bread to make it on. I did double the sauce part and left out the whip creme. lol My husband love it also.

Delicious!!! My husband was impressed he said it was restaurant quality :) I put a teaspoon of the strawberry glaze on top of the cream cheese filling for each sandwich I made. Definitely will make again & again!!

This hit the spot! I woke up one morning thinking about those ihop stuffed french toast commercials, and looked for a recipe I could do myself. Thankfully I found this recipe and it tasted even better than expected. Perfect!

Really tasty! I thought that the recipe made a bit too much of the cream cheese mixture per french toast sandwich.
