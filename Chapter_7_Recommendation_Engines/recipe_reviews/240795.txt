Really easy to make.  I used vegetable oil because of vegetarians in the family, but looking forward to trying with beef drippings for the full flavor.

Very easy and virtually goof proof. I did use my large sized muffin tins instead of glass dishes (I'm guessing Pyrex ramekins are what is meant). Definitely must have some kind of gravy with these Yorkies whether beef, lamb, chicken or even Southern U.S. sausage (with sage) gravy all work wonderfully.

Fast. Easy. Probably not as brown as might be expected by some, but f-a-s-t, which is what I needed.
