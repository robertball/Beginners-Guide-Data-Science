The name of this dessert is just cute as a bug and it’s what drew me to the recipe.  I was so lucky for it!  This is one of THE best desserts I’ve made in recent memory.  Granted, I really lucked out with beautiful, perfectly ripe, juicy and blemish-free peaches and the importance of that must be underscored.  But the best peach in the world wouldn’t help a bad recipe.  This one is absolutely beyond any criticism.  None.  Zip.  Loved the sweet peaches just as is – no cinnamon or other spices, no thickening agents, no butter, vanilla (as it seems so many are often wont to add) or anything else extraneous.  Just pure sweet peach flavor.  As for the cake-like topping,  mmm, good.  Buttery, moist and tender cake which could not have been a better partner for those sweet, juicy peaches.  I added a handful of dried cherries to the peaches and I sprinkled the top with sanding sugar before baking.  While both were nice additions, neither was necessary, nor was the dessert necessarily any better for those additions.   The baking directions were helpful and the time and temperature spot on accurate.  Pansy Petals, you indicated this recipe has been in your family for generations and it is completely understandable why.  Thanks for sharing your family’s special recipe - it’s a jewel.

This peach cobbler was very good! I kept it in a little longer in the oven, and it browned very nicely. Besides that, I sprinkled a small amount of sugar on the top to add a tad more sweetness. I would add a little more peaches, as my recipe turned out more bread-y than fruity. However, my family and I thought it was very good and this recipe was a hit for dessert. Also tastes delicious with a dollop of ice cream on top.

This recipe is as wonderful as it's name.  I have made it several times without a problem.  Just love it..
This is not a cobbler or a crisp, it's a "wrinkle" and amazing with our fresh peaches, or as the recipe suggest, other fresh fruits.
A slight adjustment in temperature for me when I bake in a glass pan I do this at 325 degrees. Never had a problem with under baking.  Just touch the top, if it springs back it's done!
If you use someone else's recipe and make all sorts of changes on your own and don't like it, well it's not the original recipe and you should not review it as such.
This is perfect and a real keeper for my family...thank you
Use a 9 X 13 pan for perfect results

A nice way to enjoy peaches for dessert. I used an additional peach and added a splash of vanilla. It came out tasting a bit eggy, so next time, I'd probably just use one egg, or one egg and one white.

A total and utter bust.  When I checked it at 40 minutes, the center was still not set.  I baked it an additional 10 minutes, and it still wasn't done.  Went a further 25 minutes, and although the center seemed to spring back at that point, it collapsed while cooling, a classic sign of under baking.  Yup.  Sure enough, when the crust was broken to dish it up, the center revealed a raw, gooey, semi-liquid mess. I regularly check the calibration on my oven's temperature, so that wasn't the problem. The edges were crispy, due to the added bake time, and the flavor was decent.  Recipe was followed exactly, and measurements were triple checked. All in all, a sad, disappointing waste of some gorgeous (and expensive) peaches.

Everyone really liked this.  My peaches were on the small side so I used a 9x9 pan.  It was too much cake mixture for that small of a pan. I had to cook it way longer than specified.  Next time I will use a lot more peaches and use a 9x13 dish.  I also thought it could of used a little more sugar.  I think a good sprinkle on top would help.  There was no left overs.

I had to use canned peaches because I couldn't find peaches anywhere (it's December), but it was still great. I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top of the peaches before I spread the batter. Our favorite part was the cake topping, it was soo good! Can't wait to try this with fresh peaches!

My husband's exact words were "this is awesome".  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter.  I then served it with vanilla ice cream.  Don't think of this as peach cobbler, it's a lighter cake-like topping.

Absolutely delicious- Easy to make, and the fact it uses common ingredients is great. We used slightly under-ripe peaches, which gave a great tartness and made the dish not overall too sweet and rich. The sponge was light and fluffy, too.

Like another review, the name of this recipe is what drew me to it.  Just had to make it.  I had just a small bowl full of diced peaches left after a day of canning, so I was looking for something to help me use those up.  I halved this recipe, baked it in a pie plate for 25 minutes, and it is beautiful, and also very good!  It's not really a cobbler, so there is not all the juice in the bottom of the pan.  If you prefer something more like that, the ice cream idea mentioned by other reviewers sounds like a plan to me!  This is not overly sweet, and there are no competing flavors.  Just a simple, classic comfort food recipe.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my first review...ever.  I had purchased peaches at a great price so decided to experiment with this recipe. I used six large peaches and the only change I would...will make is to used more. At least nine to ten peaches. The rest of the recipe was well received by the family. We served it with vanilla ice cream and it enhanced the flavors. I think I will add a sprinkle of sugar on top before baking, as recommended in another review. It didn’t need the additional sweetness, but would have made a prettier presentation. Used a 9x13 pan as recommended. Perfect size, especially with the added peaches.  This is a keeper.

Used an 8 x 8 pan.  Used 6 peaches...some bad spots, so about 5 peaches in total.  Sprinkled 1/4 c sugar on them and dotted with butter (forgot to butter pan).  Made a mistake and used 1/3 c butter, instead of 1/4 c.  Used 3/4 c whole wheat and 3/4 c white flour and 3/4 c sugar.
For sugar, used Xylitol.
Sprinkled with cinnamon.
Very good!  Found it a bit sweet yet, so will make it with 1/2 c sugar in batter.

This came out great!   Followed the recipe but used 10oz  thawed frozen peach slices since peaches are not in season yet. I decided to  serve  this upside down so the cake was on the bottom and topped with ice cream.  Thanks for sharing this super easy recipe. Yummy!

It is peach season  in GA so I tried this recipe today with great success! The recipe does not say what size baking dish to use (I think this might account for a negative review or two) but I found one reviewer  who said to use a 9 X 13 glass dish, so I did. The only adaptation I made was to substitute olive oil for the butter, in proper proportions, to accommodate my food allergy.  The cake does not look very attractive as it comes out of the oven but looks lovely when it is scooped out onto a serving plate and the top "wrinkles" a bit crunchily over the fruit   -  delicious with or without ice cream or other topping.

Needs a little more spice for my taste.  Had to cook it 40min longer after turning down to 300, otherwise the dough wasn't going to bake on the wet peaches.

Eh, just barely ok......I have had much better.  This seems to be missing something, maybe some kind of spice?  Will not make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made several different types of peach cobblers and this one has a cake like topping instead of pie crust or bread pudding consistency.  The fruit stay on the bottom and is a perfect compliment to the cake crust on top.  I used can peaches and blueberries.  Since I used canned peaches I didn't add the 1/2cup sugar to the fruit.  I baked in a 9X9 glass pan so my cook time was 55 mins instead of 40-45min.  Top was nice and golden brown.  Thanks for the recipe.
