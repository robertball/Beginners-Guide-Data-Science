This was very good. I used all ingredients, but I took a different approach. I mixed the yogurt, ranch, mustard and half the cheese together and dipped the chicken in that first. Next I dipped the chicken in the panko, cheese, garlic and pepper. It was so good and I had no trouble with sogginess and it crisped up perfectly under the broiler. Thanks for a very tasty recipe.

I made a few alterations to accommodate what I had to work with.  In place of the ranch dressing I used garlic powder, ground sage, ground rosemary and a pinch of thyme and I forgot to add the mustard, but honestly did not miss it.  My biggest issue was trying to get the mixture to stay where I put it on the chicken even though I had blotted the surface with a paper towel.  The final result was nice crisp, flavorful, moist chicken.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  Especially the broiling technique.  Substituting the ranch dressing packet for a tsp each of a few spices of your choice works well.

The breading mix is a good idea in theory however if you mix the the wet ingredient (yogurt) with the dry (everything else sans chicken) you'll get a paste compared to crumbly play-doh. First dry chicken with paper towels,  then dip in yogurt- I would even whip in some sour cream, then coat with the dry ingredients, season with salt! As for the taste, my family thought it to be plain. Otherwise, the temp, timing and the broil part was spot on!

We really enjoyed this very moist chicken and it was so quick and easy.  I mixed everything together in a bowl, dumped in the chicken, stirred to coat and transferred the whole thing to a baking dish.  Baked then broiled and ended up with a lovely crisped and toasted top.

The chicken was flavorful and moist, and very easy to make. I had thicker chicken breasts so I just cooked it longer but still quick and simple to make.

I gave this 5 stars because
1 - it is so easy to make
2 - even without all the right ingredients it was tender & delicious
3 - My 10 yr old loved it. 
Didn't have any ranch dressing mix. Looked up the ingredients to make your own - dill, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, salt, pepper, dried mustard and added these from my spice cabinet. Didn't have any dried buttermilk so used 1/2 cup sour cream. Added turmeric for color and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Marinated the pounded breasts for 30 mins in the yogurt mixture and baked for 35 mins. Served with Near east rosemary and garlic quinoa w/brown rice and salad. It does have a hint of lemony taste from the yogurt!

This  recipe was easy to make. I thought it was very tasty.  But  I have the fussiest family and they did not like it at all. 

Also, coating the chicken with the sticky paste was very problematic.  I will not make this again.

This was delicious.  I seasoned up some boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, but it all turned out great since I'm a low carber.   I spread the mixture on the meat quite easily with the back of a tablespoon.  Will make again or use the yogurt mixture on other cuts of meat or veggies.

This is a very tasty dish, but it's a hot mess to put together. I did keep the wet and dry ingredients separate in the hopes of making it less messy, but it didn't entirely work out that way. I approached it this way because of other reviewers stating that combining everything together turned it into a gloppy paste. You basically wind up with paste either way, so it might be easier in the long run to just combine it all and spread it over the chicken breasts as carefully as possible. A lot of it doesn't want to "stick", though. I think it would have been awesome had I been able to get more of the ingredients to adhere to the chicken to get a more thorough coating. Overall, this one is worth a try! Very nice flavor.

Fabulous recipe - only trouble I had was flipping - they were a bit soggy on the bottom but I think I flipped them over too soon !  They were delicious though!

This tasted fine but please explain how your suppose to spread that yogurt paste on the chicken, it was like spreading kids construction paste and did not stick at all to the chicken.

I liked this and so did my 4 and 7 year old children. As it was cooking, the juices seemed to start making the topping too soupy. I pulled it out and dumped out the extra juices. That seemed to be the right thing to do since when it was done, the chicken was tender and the topping had caramelized to the point that I scraped it from the pan so I didn't waste the yummy goodness. I will make this again.

The flavor was great, but I followed the advice of another reviewer to split the ingredients into two bowls (yogurt, ranch, mustard and 1/2 the cheese in one, panko, cheese, garlic and pepper in the other) and wish I would have halved the yogurt bowl and doubled the crumbs bowl. I had way too much of the first and not enough of the second. It did turn out tasty though!

Not sure what I did wrong!  I followed the directions exactly, but it came out a goopy mess and hardly toasty on top.  It was a little too tangy for my taste, but in all it was easy and I can see if done correctly, delicious.
