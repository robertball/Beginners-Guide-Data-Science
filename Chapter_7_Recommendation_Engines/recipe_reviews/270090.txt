I committed the poultry seasoning. I didn't have green onion so just used regular onion.  Everyone liked it. You can make this half a day or one day before then heat in oven.

It was ok. I’ll never make it again using this recipe. My husband gave it three stars. My 7 year old didn’t care for it at all.  I left out the mushrooms.
