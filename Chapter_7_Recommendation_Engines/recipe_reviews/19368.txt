My mom makes a really good Macaroni and Cheese, and she is always being asked to make some for someone.  She is not really a Macaroni and Cheese person herself but she loves making it for people.  I tried Chuck's recipe this past Thanksgiving and it blew my Mom's out of the water.  Sorry Mom!  She agrees with me also.  I am originally from California and we had this restaurant in downtown Los Angeles called Clifton's Cafeteria and I thought that they made the best Macaroni and Cheese in the entire world.  Well, I have finally found the recipe for it.  Thank you Chuck for bringing back wonderful memories and for one of the best recipes on this site.  By the way, my Mom actually loves Macaroni and Cheese now, and is always wanting me to make Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese.  It is now my family's favorite too.

This is not your typical shells and cheese recipe.  Very tasty indeed.  My family loved it and the leftovers were just as good.  Some suggestions though which most people have already mentioned:  The amount of bread crumbs needs to seriously be reduced.  Instead of 1 cup, I would only use a 1/4 of a cup with the 1/4 of melted butter.  This will provide a light garnishment on top of your dish.  Mmmmm...also add a 1/2 cup of milk.  If not, your leftovers will be dry as a bone.  A tasty bone, but still quite dry.  Happy eating!!!  :)

I must say that I have been using this website for over 5 years and this is my first review ever...this recipe is top notch.  I usually add some chopped ham (or sometime Kielbasa), peas and finely chopped onions to this and add a little milk to keep it moist.  This is definitely in my top 15 recipes ever.

Oh god. This recipe is better than sex. Seriously, we make it all the time. Add a can of condensed tomato soup and you will be in cheesy, artery-clogging heaven.

Of all the dishes I have tried from this site, this is one of my top favorites, and my family and friends rave about it. I make it exactly as directed except skip the breadcrumbs and cover the top in a thick layer of cheese instead. It is interesting to read all the mixed reviews on this mac and cheese, because depending upon what part of the country you are from, people eat different kinds of mac and cheese. Some people like creamy and some people like it the way this one is made. The mac and cheese that I am used to making and eating that taste like this is made with egg. The cottage cheese in this recipe gives the same consistency of that without the egg, and I like that. Thanks so much! This recipe has really been a great find for me!

best mac & cheese ever!!  i eliminated breadcrumbs & butter.  i added lots of fresh sliced tomatoes (tossed w/ pepper) between mac & cheese mixture.  also added 1/2 - 3/4 c skim milk (per another reviewer's suggestion) & used fat free/reduced fat sour cream, cottage cheese & shredded cheese & low carb pasta.  gotta try to make it healthier somehow!!

I love this recipe.  It is easy, creamy, and the sour cream add great flavor.  I prefer crumbled triscuits on top and a little bit of cayenne pepper.  I also like to use fat free sour cream and cottage cheese (no one can tell the difference).I make this about once a week.  Thanks for sharing!!

When my roommates and I realized that we ran out of bread crumbs, we crushed up ritz crackers and sprinkled them on top instead of the butter-crumb mixture.  I think the crumbs make this recipe perfect, regardless of whether you use ritz or breadcrumbs.

This was wonderful! I had about half a head of cauliflower that I needed to use up, so I cut it up, steamed it, and threw it in with some leftover penne pasta. To make the cheese mixture a little more creamy, I added about a half cup of jalapeno cheese dip (the kind you put on tortilla chips), then added a little cayenne pepper. It had just a little kick, but otherwise tasted like your typical rich, homemade mac and cheese. Very easy too!

Oh. Wow...this is some good Mac and Cheese. This recipe is a keeper just like it is!! It just kills me on this site when someone alters multiple ingredients in a recipe (basically making it into a different recipe) and then has the nerve to give it a low rating...don't mind them, just make this mac and cheese and enjoy it. It's good. Really, really good!!!

Delicious taste and good texture.  Mine was creamy and not dry - and not greasy like some mac and cheeses.  Other reviewers found it dry but I didn't.  It was not bland either - the recipe says to use OLD cheddar for a reason I believe.  Maybe some people used dry parmesan, not fresh?? Or maybe b/c I just sprinkled bread crumbs on top and didn't use a full cup mixed with butter?  In case it's useful to someone else, since we don't buy food in ounces here, my conversions are 2 1/2 c macaroni, 1 block of cheddar cheese (450 g), 1 1/2 c cottage cheese (or maybe could use just a whole 500 mL), 1 c sour cream (250 mL).

Amazingly delicious! Love the tangy taste and lovely texture. I don't know why some people don't like it... if you want Kraft Mac n' Cheese, it's much cheaper and faster, so just make that! I used low-fat everything: cheddar, sour cream, cottage cheese. I used large shells instead of elbow macaroni (personal preference). No bread crumbs/ butter, I used a bit extra cheddar on the top. Seasoned with salt and crushed red pepper, along with garlic powder, hot sauce is also a good addition. I used a parmesan-romano-asiago blend instead of plain parmesan, and added 1/3 cup milk. I don't like cottage cheese, but it's really not noticable- though you can see curds. Amazing-- thank you!  For those who love this dish like me, but don't want to end up the size of a planet, making this dish with 2% milk sour cream and cottage cheese, and 1% cheese (Cabots has a great 75% reduced fat sharp cheddar, you will have to grate it yourself, though), results in a very healthy recipe that tastes really amazing. Per serving (1/6 of recipe): Calories:333, Fat:9.7g, Protein:28g. 26% fat, 33% protein. Very balanced and tasty! This is what I'll do in future!

I've made this three times now and have tweaked it to my liking as other reviewers.  I increase the cheddar, decrease the cottage cheese and  I add  1/2 cup of milk as suggested by others. I use panko instead of bread crumbs, decreasing the amount and I decrease the butter.  I have found that if I make this too far ahead of time, it becomes dry, so I try to assemble the ingredients shortly before baking.  I've also found that if I cover it for the first half of the baking time and uncover it the last half, it stays creamier.  If after 30-35 minutes, the bread crumbs haven't browned, then I pop it under the broiler for a minute.  UPDATE: 9/15/10 - Made a more "adult" version of this.  For the topping, I used equal parts of panko bread crumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Added chopped fresh basil and moistened the mixture with EVOO.  The basil added a different dimension to this compared to the original.  Either way, this is great!

This recipe is similar to the recipe for Mac & Cheese served at the Hoggy's restaurant chain here in Columbus and it is great.  Ratios of ingredients are slightly different.  I use 2 cups mixed dry pasta to 16 oz of Sour Creme and I substituted 15 oz of Ricotta for the cottage cheese.  Also used 24 oz of shredded Cheddar or any mixture of shredded cheese you would like. Finally uses 2 beatten eggs.  I mixed the ricotta, sour creme and eggs first then added the shredded cheese and pasta. Salt and pepper to taste.  Dashes of  Worchester sauce and hot sauce are optional but worthwhile. I used an italian bread crumbs, parmesian melted butter mixture to top it and baked 40 min at 375. Superior recipe but not creamy,  Add a 1-1/2 cups of milk if you want a creamier texture. This is a keeper

I was skeptical and I LOVED IT!!  And I already make a mean Mac & Cheese.  I really like that you don't have to make bechamel sauce first.  My 4 & 7 year old kids loved it too.  I did use my stick blender to smooth out the cottage cheese because I didn't want my kids going EEWWW when they saw the curds.  There was not one complaint and my son asked for seconds.  They didn't even notice that it was different from my regular Mac & Cheese.  This will now be my standard Mac & Cheese.  THANKS!!

I've made this dish about 5 times already for work potlucks.  I crush up Ritz Honey Butter crackers and use for the topping instead of bread crumbs.  The sweet and salty really accompany the dish well.  Thanks  Chuck!

I'll sure be making this recipe again! The best mac and cheese yet.. I added some onions 'cause I like them so much and I did add a little milk as others suggested.  I would recomend at least 1/3 cup of milk or it will be rather dry... still good but dry.  I also used roasted garlic bread crumbs and WOW did that ever add the flavor. I had three helpings and my wife had two! This one hit my taste buds just right!

I "food-processed" the cottage cheese to make it a bit creamier, added milk, italian blend cheese (about 1/2 cup) and used garlic heb bread crumbs.  It was a hit at work.

This was very good but needed more zip. The 2nd time we made it, we added a T. of Dijon mustard and a few shakes of hot sauce.

This recipe should be in a smaller pan or casserole dish due to 8oz box of macaroni. If making this for a large family, double up on the recipe. All the cheeses didn't melt throughly. The next time I will melt my cheese in a pot of warmed milk with flour. Milk needs to be added-1 1/2cups or lil more. It was very dry. Other than that it was very good. If you want to kick it up add pepper jack cheese.

I have been making this recipe for almost a decade now and it has made me a hit at parties. People request this from me. I misplaced the recipe a few years ago and frantically went through dozens of recipes until I found it again. Why the desperation? I have NEVER tasted any other mac&cheese recipe that comes close to tasting like this. It is a uniquely rich experience. If you like the homestyle mac and cheese bake (instead of the creamy type) I cannot recommend trying this enough.

I made this as written with a few *minor* changes. I used full fat cheddar, but Daisy light sour cream and 2% cottage cheese. I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard and 1/2 cup skim milk, Panko breadcrumbs on top. This was easy and absolutely wonderful. It is not the drippy, artificially yellow stuff that some are accustomed to from childhood. My husband loved it, too. Thanks for a great *keeper* recipe.

This is the best Mac N Cheese by far!! I've been making this for two years now and my family loves it!!  The only variation I have is that I double the recipe and add a 16 oz. pkg of parmasean cheese! The cheesier the better!!! We love this mac and cheese. We have it at least twice a month. My hubz will eat a whole pan by himself. Yummy yummy*

I made this once before making it for a party with a bunch of out of town friends.  They still rave about it, and I even made it in the crock pot instead of baking it.  I use light sour cream and 2% milk, low sodium cottage cheese.  I add 1 egg and when I bake it use 1/2 cup bread crumbs instead of a whole cup.  I also add 4 ounces extra cheddar and shred it myself.  Sometimes I throw in other cheeses I have around the house like feta.  Adding paprika is a great addition too.  Enjoy with friends and family!

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe. I've been craving S'MAC since leaving NYC. I couldn't believe that this turned out better than the best Mac & Cheese we've ever had. I used gluten-free brown rice pasta to accommodate our gluten allergies. As suggested by other reviewers, I blended 1/2 cup milk and cottage cheese together. To intensify the flavor I included onion powder, garlic powder, nutmeg, dried basil, and himalayan salt. Instead of breadcrumbs, I generously added a layer of mozzarella cheese on top. I covered and baked the dish for 15 minutes then removed the aluminum foil. After another 15 minutes I broiled the pasta for 5 minutes to thicken and brown the top layer. Next time we'll be adding meat and vegetables to this fantastic recipe.

This is really, really good, but I add a little bit of garlic powder and ground mustard to kick it up a little bit more. If you are like me and love a really crunchy topping, replace the bread crumbs with panko bread crumbs. It's soooo good!

I really wanted to like this since it had the addition of sour cream. I followed the recipe exactly as is. I brought it to a party and no one ate it. The cottage cheese was just too weird for people. The cheese didn't melt enough, despite giving it and extra 10 minutes in the oven. Way too much bread crumbs. I ended up scraping off half of the bread crumbs after 30 minutes of baking because the center was just not heating up.

I have to say that I do not think this is as great as everyone else believes.  It was a nice, creamy mac & cheese, but lacking in flavour.  I picked it because I needed to clean out the fridge and lo and behold here was a recipe with all the extraneous dairy products I had on hand.  So with that in mind, yippee!  I followed the advice of others and added a little bit of milk and only used a bit of breadcrumbs on top.  Also, as others have mentioned, for those who complained that it was dry maybe used a whole 16 oz box of pasta as opposed to the 8 oz called for.  It was good and I will probably try it one more time, but for now, it's not a keeper. Thanks though!

My family makes a recipe similar to this We use all of the ingredients except we also add an 8 ounce package of shredded mozzarella, 3 ounces of cream cheese and one egg to the mixture.  Very creamy and very good.

Excellent recipe; take the time to read through some of the reviews and tweak according to your own taste. I doubled recipe, used as many fat-free or low fat ingredients as I could. Definitely puree the cottage cheese, all we have is a little Bullet so had to add about 1/2 of 2% milk to get it to blend. I used a big tupperware bowl and mixed all the ingredients together, then added cooked macaroni and mixed well. Couldn't resist throwing in a good handful of real bacon chips (didn't have time to cook some bacon) and instead of bread crumbs I sprinkled shredded cheddar on the top. I also probably added at least another 1/2 cup of milk to make the entire mixture a teeny bit soupy. Wow, what an incredible mac & cheese delight. Husband loved it. The only thing I'm going to change is next time go with a whole wheat pasta and skim milk. It is a definite "go for it" recipe for even a beginner to try. The folks saying it came out dry probably used pre packeaged cheese. If that's what you use add milk - pasta takes on a lot of fluid. Should come out of the oven bubbling like mad and need a few minutes "set" time. As the recipe is doubled I was able to make a 9x13 pan full as well as a 9X9 pan for a neighbor. Baked both at that suggested 350 degrees on the same rack for about 40 minutes.

Great recipe!  I was a little nervous about the sour cream and cottage cheese. I had nothing to worry about.  It was DELICIOUS!   I took it to an AFC playoff party (go Broncos!) and everyone loved it. The only change was that I used ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand.

We really enjoyed this!! My son gobbled it up and wanted a second serving. I halved it and had enough for about a 1 1/2 inch layer in a 2qt dish. I do think the topping should be halved, but it was tasty!! I used light cottage cheese, sharp white cheddar and natural sour cream - very tasty and creamy! :)

I prepared this one and another from this site at the same time.  The other was more complicated withmore ingredients and  a sauce.  This was by far so much better and much easier to prepare! We all loved it, including a 10 month old and 4 year old.  I will definitely make this again.  I may try whirring up the cottage cheese before adding just for the texture for the 4 year old who thinks he doesn't like cottage cheese.  It's a simple, delicious way to make mac and cheese!
*Also, for those who thought it was too dry, just add a little milk, and don't overcook.  A very few people said it didn't have much taste -be SURE to use a really good cheese and grate it yourself - none of that pre-grated, tastless, packaged stuff!  Makes a big difference! I usually use crushed crackers that we love on top for a little more zing.

I've made this recipe as written before and loved it as is. But last night I didn't have any cottage cheese, so I substituted ricotta (part skim). Wow I love it even more now. It looks better to me, I don't see the curds of the cottage cheese. I also used low fat sour cream, extra sharp cheddar, whole wheat rotini noodles, butter substitute (Smart Balance Light) and panko bread crumbs. I was trying to cut some of the fat, it was delicious.

I tried it with half sour cream/plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese 2%, and creamy havarti with aged white cheddar. Used penko and spices with butter for the topping.

I have been making this for a while now and everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it. My only suggestion would be if your making a single batch, use a 9x9 baking dish. Pasta comes out much more moist and not dry at all.

I really thought for the last 25 years of making macaroni & cheese I already had the best recipe on the planet...until I tried this recipe. It really came out fantastic and I followed it exactly as written as far as quantities and baking. I only added 1/2 teaspoon or so of Dry Mustard to give it some sharpness and a dash of garlic powder. And since I used lowfat cottage cheese and light sour cream, I added 2 tablespoons of regular Hellmanns Mayo to add some creaminess. After it comes our of the oven, be sure to let it sit for at least 15 minutes. Delish the next day cold!

Great dish! My whole family cleaned their plates and ate leftovers twice. Just as good as the first time. I added ham and peas. My husband is still talking about it. Next time I will add a little milk and more cheese. It needed a bit of moisture when reheated.

Fantastic! Make as is, but It does dry out so I may try to broil it instead of baking. I have been told to never bake mac n cheese. It dries it out. Also it seemed like it need milk somewhere. ???

This is FABULOUS!!! I modified it a little bit to our taste...cooked a whole 16oz box of elbow noodles. In a bowl I mixed together low fat cottage cheese and sour cream, the parm cheese, colby-monterey jack cheese, a little mozzarella and some extra sharp cheddar. Used a little salt and pepper. I also buttered my baking dish and then mixed all together. I also added about 1/2 cup of milk, then baked for 30 mins, stirred then placed crumbled Ritz crackers on top and baked an additional 10 mins. AWESOME taste...my picky fiance said it was the best he has ever had. This is a must try.

**Cooking TIP** : Put the cottage cheese thru a blender or food processor before adding, in order to eliminate the curd-y texture and make it smoooooth.    Believe it or not, mac & cheese enthusiasts ~ the cottage cheese improves the flavor!   This recipe is not especially creamy or cheesy, but definitely delicious in its own right.

Holy Macaroni!  If you like real mac n cheese, you should make this.  I didn't alter much.  I added almost 1/2 a cup of milk.  For the topping, I used butter crackers, the suggested melted butter and also added parmasen chz & blk pepper.  I think I also used a little more shredded cheese then the recipe called for.  All in all, totally yummalicious.  Try this recipe! : )

Did not care for it in the least. I erred in putting too much topping on it nevertheless, it lacked flavour completely. It was dry. I'll keep looking for the definitive macaroni & cheese.

This was very good.  I finally found a recipe for M&C that I can make low fat, that's easy and still tastes good.  I used low fat marg.; low fat sour cream; low fat cottage cheese and 1/2 low fat cheddar and half regular.  Even my picky husband liked it.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good, this was my first attempt at 'homemade' mac n cheese and it was very easy and a big hit. I used crushed up french's french fried onions instead of the breadcrumbs, much more tastier.

This is one of the very best Mac and Cheese recipes available.  Do follow the minor (though important) adjustments on cutting down on breadcrumbs.  You may want to balance some of the suggestions to reduce the sour cream ... a little at least (hey, not too much ... it is Mac and Cheese after all!).  Overall awesome recipe.  Use your judgement and have fun.  Just be sure to go out for a walk after dinner!

I was really disappointed in this recipe after reading so many positive reviews. My husband liked it okay, but I didn't care for the texture - the cheeses didn't meld together into a creamy sauce like I was expecting. I think the cottage cheese was the culprit. I might try again and puree the cottage cheese first.

This dish tasted like warmed cottage cheese and sour cream on noodles- and way to many breadcrumbs.  Not tasty at all.

I didn't really enjoy this.  If you like creamy mac and cheese (similar consistency to velveeta or kraft) this is not for you.  This was more like noodles with lumpy melted cheese on it.  I tried to like it but just couldn't.

The first time I made this recipe I followed all of the directions but it turned out too dry for liking, but still good. The second time I added an egg and about a half cup of milk. I also added some cubed ham, finely chopped onion, and about 1/5tsp of dijon mustard to the cheese mixture. DELISH!

This was great!  I also get frustrated when people change up the recipe but I did add 1/2 cup milk and reduced bread crumbs to 1/2 cup. Without the milk it would've been too dry for me.  I've tried many recipes for deluxe Mac n cheese and this one was EASY, FAST and DELICIOUS. And 8 ounces is about 1 3/4 cup of elbow macaroni - I used 2 cups dry and my dish was perfect.

This is the best mac and cheese. Creamy without been gooey like mac and cheese out of the box (and without genetically engineered ingredients, food coloring,  and excess salt!).  Wonderful just the way it is (but if you add some garlic to the butter and breadcrumbs it will be gourmet). Add some chopped spinach and get some veggies 
 into your kids.

I'm sorry if I come off as extremely critical or rude, but this recipe was absolutely not to my liking! I have made Mac and cheese several times using different recipes from this site, some wer good, some were a little less than great but I have never ever followed a recipe this not to my liking. The end result of the product was so bad that I even took the time to make an account and review this recipe for the sake of others! I don't understand why anyone would put cottage cheese into such a dish. The macaroni turned out extremely dry and flavorless (I even followed another persons advice to add 1/2 a cup of milk). My boyfriend who is the most non-picky eater in the world wouldn't eat it... Mind you he is the type of man who eats leftovers on a plate! Beware of this recipe, if you're really craving some Mac and cheese I suggest you to go and buy a box of kraft dinner instead.

I LOVE this recipe! Every time I make it, people are always begging for me to bring it again or for the recipe. I do make a few changes though. I add several (6 or more) slices of American cheese for consistency, add precooked bacon, broken into pieces, and omit the crumb topping. I believe the crumb topping makes the dish seem really dry, especially if you have leftovers. Great recipe!! Thanks Chuck :)

Some people complained about the texture of the cottage cheese in the recipe...I think I fixed that by pureeing the cottage cheese with some milk in the blender. It kept the creaminess without having the lumps. I also added some onion powder and garlic powder. It probably could have used more spices, I'm just not sure what. One more change was the breadcrumb topping--I omitted the butter entirely and only sprinkled maybe 1/4 cup of bread crumbs on the top. Overall we really liked this recipe.

I could not stop eating this!   I didn't have any parmesan cheese on hand so I used Beecher's Flagship cheese (from Pike Place Market) which has a slightly nutty flavor, but melts a bit creamier than parm.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of milk.  It was perfect!  I will be making this again and often!   If you are looking for a creamy mac and cheese, this isn't your recipe.  This is chewy and rich with a bit of crunch from the bread crumbs.  Yum!!

So,  you love mac and cheese, right?  I assume that's why you are trying this recipe...look no further, this is your go to mac and cheese!!!  Scrumptious, cheesy, heaven on a plate.  I think the people who said theirs was dry might be using a whole box of pasta.  DO NOT use a 1lb (16 oz.) box of pasta! This recipe calls for 8oz of pasta!!! I'm glad I looked through the pictures first because I did not like the way the cottage cheese made it look, so I  blended 1/2 cup milk with cottage cheese to *smooth* out the sauce before adding it to the noodles I also used equal parts cheddar and  gruyere, added a little ground mustard and ground nutmeg.  I used about 1/2 cup of panko mixed with melted butter (sorry, did not measure) on top!!! Soooooooo gooooooood! You will not be dissapointed!!!

I made some changes in the recipe, due to what I had on hand. First I halved the recipe. I used 1% cottage cheese and light sour cream. I added shredded medium cheddar cheese, Parmesan, and provolone. (About a cup altogether.) I added about a 1/8 teaspoon of salt and pepper. I had Ritz crackers, and used them instead of bread crumbs. I would definitely make this again!

Well I think it may have been the sour cream, or maybe it was the parma, but it came out with a funny taste, like sour. I don't think I will be making this one again. :(

I like my mac 'n cheese gooey and with the amount of bread crumbs called for it turned out a bit dry. We used more cheddar cheese to try and compensate but still not as good as other mac 'n cheese recipes I have. If I do make again it will be one of the versions other members posted.

this is my new favorite recipe for homemade mac-n-chz.  i would have rated it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the excessive amount of bread crumbs.  in the future i will use half the amount.  i subbed jack cheese for half of the sharp cheddar because i ran out of the latter, and it worked great.  i also added a little cayenne to give it a kick.  wonderful recipe.

I love the cheesyness of this recipe but I made a few changes. Like my mom I make a roux, add milk and the 3 cheeses before adding the macaroni and baking. I throw in the mustard, ground or Dijon, depending on what I can find in my cabinet.  BUT, we like our topping a little crunchy so we use crumbled cornflakes instead of bread crumbs. That brings it up to a near 5.

We enjoyed this dish.  The first time I fixed it, we thought it was a little too dry.  The next time I fixed it I added a can of evaporated milk.  The family loved it.  No complaints.  This will be our standard recipe for macaroni and cheese.

Great.  Very easy to make.  I was looking for a recipe that tasted like a local stores homemade one- and this is it.  I wasn't sure of how the cottage cheese would tase (sometimes in lasagna it stands out), but it was great in this, blended well with the other cheeses.  The texture is wonderful, sort of like the types made with eggs- but smoother.  To me, the bread crumbs are optional (I put it on half- my kids don't like the crumbs, but I and my husband do).  My kids loved this, and they normally do not like my homemade mac & cheese.  They use to prefer the Kraft Deluxe, but not now- this is what they want.  I also added a little cayenne.

I thought this was a great recipe. I used the little seashell pasta, and fat free cottage cheese, fat free sour cream and fat free cheddar.  It turned out wonderful.  Very rich and creamy. If you are looking for a great mac & cheese recipe this is the one.  (Fat Free or not)

I really liked the flavor of this Mac and Cheese.  I made it according to the directions, but used garlic salt instead of regular salt because that's what I use for cooking.  I also didn't have any plain breadcrumbs, so I substituted some crumbled up butter crackers.  Needless to say it didn't stay on the table for long.

This is seriously amazing. It rivals even the best restaurant mac and cheese and may just be the best I have ever had. My husband and I were skeptical because when we first mixed everything, all we could see and smell was cottage cheese and sour cream but it really works. Thank you so much!

It drives me crazy when people rate recipes high then process to totally change it in their reviews.  I tried this one because it had such a great rating with so many reviews & I didn't see too many people with revisions.  It was only okay, too much work & expense for a fairly bland mac & cheese.  I liked the creaminess but I want it to be cheesier.

I loved this recipe. I followed it exactly as stated. I love the addition of the cottage cheese. It has a subtle yet sharp flavor, hard to describe. To make it a meal I brown a pound of ground beef in A1 sauce and add it to the macaroni and cheese before baking. We all loved it!

My family loves homemade mac n cheese and this is no exception.  The secret is to use sharp cheddar cheese. I let this bake a little longer then stated because we like it crispy on the top. Easy to make ahead in the morning and bake in the evening for dinner.

I put the low fat cottage cheese, low fat sour cream, cheddar , sharp cheese and 1/2 of milk in food processor to break up the cottage cheese curds. Used crushed ritz crackers and italian bread crumbs with butter for the topping. I will make again very, very good.

I bought a 20lb ham last week for a terrific price so I've been trying to find recipes to use it up on. The other night I made this baked Mac & cheese and added cooked ham and cooked carrots to make it a meal. Topped with more cheese and homemade french fried onions! Yum!  I doubled the recipe for my family of 7.

I LOVED this meal! The only thing I would do differently is add more ham than I did. The ham added such smokey depth of flavor. My oldest did not like the cottage cheese in it. She's a visual eater. So she nuked it until all the curds were melted, lol. My husband is not a cottage cheese fan either but he had no problem gobbling this up. This is my first time cooking with cottage cheese, and I was hoping it would melt along with the other cheeses but it didn't. So keep that in mind if you have picky eaters like mine. Apparently the cottage cheese is used as a binder, so I will substitute with an egg or two next time...and there will be a next time...but with more ham, lol.

FYI, To make homemade french fried onions I very thinly sliced up a red onion, separated the rings and soaked in milk for 5 minutes (I used the milk that I soaked these in to the cheese sauce). Mixed up some flour with season salt, a little regular salt, and a dash of pepper. Then coated the onion rings and fried them up in oil until light brown. Salty crispy goodness!

This was pretty good.  I wanted it to be just a little bit creamier.  I think I will make it again and try adding some velveeta.  The bread crumb topping was so good, I will use this on my mac and cheese from now on.

My family loved this recipe. I had some provel, fresh paremsean, and asiago cheese so I threw all of those in as well. I also added a bit more cheddar than is called for as we like our mac&chz extra cheesy and gooey!!! I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs

I am giving the original recipe a rating of 4. The consistency wasn't great and it was a bit bland. I then added about 3/4c milk and some sweet chili sauce. This really helped make it a 5 star recipe.

very good.  My kids loved it.  I love the sour cream in it.  I made it a second time and added a bit of a bechamel sauce i made with mustard powder, paprika and minced onion and it was amazing- elevated the flavor.

While I'm not sure this is a substitute for a roll in the hay as another reviewer suggested, it is delicious! I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I tossed in about a tablespoon of left over feta. I also only had whole grain pasta on hand, but other than that, I followed the recipe as is. It worked well with low fat cottage cheese and light sour cream. I will definitely make this one again.

Made this last night.  I did not care for it.  With the exception of the topping, I followed the receipe exactly.  The cottage cheese overwhelmed the other flavors and gave the whole thing an unappealing clumpy texture.

I figured I would give this a try because I had everything on hand and we love home made mac an cheese. However, we could not get over the cottage cheese taste. It wasn't visually appetizing either.. I followed the recipe exactly except threw some chopped ham and tomatoes in.  That part was yummy!

I expected this mac & cheese to be a lot better than it was since it had such great ratings.  It was SO dry.  I had even added some milk before I baked it.  Aside from the dryness, the taste was just average.

I have always loved mac and cheese, but I have also always wanted it to be cheesier.  I think perhaps it is because the sour cream and cottage cheese give it a tang, but this DOES seem cheesier!  It is my new favorite macaroni and cheese recipe and I have abandoned the one I had used for almost 40 years.

Wonderful.  I tripled for a family gathering and everyone raved about how good it was.  I did not use the bread crumbs or butter on top and did not think it was missing anything.

I put extra cheese on top rather than the breadcrumbs.  My family, adults and children all said it was the best mac and cheese they have ever had.

Just as good as my moms! I followed as directed and really enjoyed it. The cottage cheese really gives it that cheesy homemade taste.

Just made this for dinner tonight; so simple but delicious! My husband doesn't usually like mac n cheese but he said this is one mac n cheese he would eat. I liked the strong flavor but my 13 year old wasn't so crazy about it. Could easily reduce the fat in this by using light versions of the cheeses and sour cream

This was the perfect home made MAC I did make a few additions to make it even better. Instead of the 12oz cottage cheese I used 8oz cottage cheese and 4oz light cream cheese. I also added 1/3 cup of milk. I topped it with some sharp cheddar cheese and I took the advise of others and only used 1/4 cup bread crumbs used italian because that was what I had on hand, it didnt cover the whole top of it so I crumbleled up a little bit of FRENCH"s FRIED ONIONS and sprinkled that over the spots missing bread crumbs.

This recipe was so easy and the perfect flavor and richness of the good ol comfort food I was looking for.  Definitely add 3/4 cup of milk before baking, I only cooked for 30 mins and stayed moist next day.

OH MY GOSH. This is the best mac and cheese I've ever had. My friend made it for me and after I had it I joined this site JUST to get the recipe. I made it for my family and some friends last night and everyone agreed it was the best ever! It's got a classic feel to it with just a bit of tang from the sour cream and cottage cheese. Holy cow was it good....

I did not care for this. Such a waste of...everything included.  I admit that I cut down the cheeses but the fact was that they never melted and instead seemed to clump together tastelessly.  It was devoid of flavor and even when I added some spices the monotomy was stifling.  I'm just confused why everyone is going all crazy over this...

Not good.  First bite or two were ok, but after that it was WAY too rich to eat anymore.  It was also very salty and I didn't add any extra salt.  I'd choose a different Mac and Cheese recipe for a main dish.

Different mac and cheese than I normally make.  I took the suggestions of others and reduced the bread crumbs.  I am glad I did, all in all, may make again with no bread crumbs and just add cheese as the topping.

Great base recipe with adjustments. Skip the bread crumbs entirely. DO add 1/2 cup milk to the mixture. And to create a creamier sauce, blend the cottage cheese until nearly smooth, then add remaining ingredients in processor and whirl together for a few seconds. I also added hot dogs for more flavor!

I hate cottage cheese but I decided to give this recipe a try. Honestly it was amazing. I added ham to give it some meat, it was a neat additional. I think adding some tuna would also do well. But really this recipe is definately a 6/5... seriously!

I'm just not a fan of the homemade mac and cheese.  It always seems bland to me!  Besides that my family wasn't crazy about the breaded topping.  Sorry, but this recipe wasn't for us.  We'll keep looking though!

I wanted to give this recipe 5 stars because my dish turned out so well, but decided on 4 stars because I put my own spin on it that made it 5.  Firstly, I doubled the recipe because I was cooking for a crowd.  I then added an additional pound of pasta for a total of 2 lbs.  I added a cubed 2lb. block of velveeta when I added the other cheeses.  Do not be afraid of adding the cottage cheese.  It blends in seamlessly.  Also, I would recommend adding the sharp and velveeta when the pasta is hot and fold until nearly all melted and then add the remaining ingredients.  It was sheer perfection and everyone went nuts!  I really appreciate the recipe, because it is a wonderful base to build on.

This was awesome. I made it for 3 people and had very little leftovers. I took  advice from others and used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs rather than the full cup. It was just right. I also increased the butter to 1/2 cup and sprinkled sharp shredded cheese on top. YUMMMMM. I will definately be making this again....SOON! It is such a wonderful comfort dish.

The kids absolutely love this recipe, so long as they don't see what goes into it!  The youngest saw the cottage cheese go in while constructing and decided he wasn't going to eat it.  Took quite a while to get him to try it, but he did indeed like it and ask for seconds.

Very mild and comforting.  My kids like a bit more spice so they added garlic salt after it was cooked.  It packed great for their school lunches...

Really disapointed with this recipe.  It came out dry and thick and tasteless.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The tray of this mac and cheese was hardly touched. I will try a different recipe next time.

I dont know how to cook macaroni that doesn't come from a box!!!  This macaroni was great, my BF and kiddo both loved it.  It was rich, so a little goes a long way, so I wouldn't recommend doubling the recipe unless you are feeding an army.  I turned up my nose for a long while becuase of the cottage cheese, but WOW!!  Just try it!!!

Probably the best macaroni and cheese
we've ever had. I made some adjustments to the recipe, some that were suggested
by other testers and some of my own. I added in 3/4 c. milk and 6 oz. shredded pepperjack cheese in with the other cheeses. I also sauteed half of a sweet
onion and four large cloves of garlic
and added that in, too. I didn't have
packaged breadcrumbs, so I made my
own out of stale bread, butter and garlic powder. I plan on making this 
again. Really, really good.

We loved this, really cheesy taste and quick and simple to make, mix everything together and bake. Great for those who want something to eat without to much effort.  I added half a mug of milk to it before baking as suggested by another reviewer and in doing this found it not to be dry at all, even the leftover the next day were still moist.

Really good. This has become a staple at both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I used fat free cottage cheese and sour cream. My family could not taste the difference. I did leave out the bread crumbs.

very mushy needs seasoning. i added Greek. seasoning and that seemed to help.  I added milk suggested by other reviewers and I think that made it more mushy.

Very tasty. I was skeptical of the cottage cheese but it turned out great! Instead of normal cheddar I bought chipotle sharp white cheddar. The smokiness and spice of the chipotle really added a tasty kick!
UPDATE- I still love this recipe, but I made a few changes. I use whole grain pasta. I also blended the cottage cheese with the low fat sour cream in a blender with a few cloves of garlic to get rid of the cottage cheese texture. For the bread crumbs I toasted bread and sprayed butter spray and garlic salt on it before turning into crumbs. With these changes it makes it much healthier but doesn't sacrifice taste!

This was tasty.  I love cheese and wanted it to be somewhat creamy so in addition to the sharp cheddar, I added an extra cup of medium cheddar to it and put extra of it on top as well.  I used about half the bread crumbs called for (maybe even a little less) and sprinkled the butter-bread crumb mixture on the top with the cheese.  I'm glad I cut it back because the bread crumbs do have a distinct flavor and a whole cup would have overpowered it as the others reviewers have noted.  I also added 1/4 cup milk as suggested in previous reviews and it kept it nice and moist.  I loved the cottage cheese touch and the sour cream gave it a little kick.  Note that the sour cream also makes it quite rich -- I found I couldn't eat as much as I normally do, but perhaps that's a good thing! This is a great alternative to traditional mac and cheese!

Most definately a 5 star recipe.  I'm not into Mac N Cheese much, but this recipe is good.  I had to make some modifications, for instance, I only had about half the amount of medium cheddar so I added mild cheddar.  I also mixed in about 1/4 cup of cream style corn (I scaled the recipe down to 3 people).  I didn't add any salt because I believe the salt from the bread crumbs & butter was pleanty.  Plus I salted the pasta.  It turned out good and I will definately make it for dinner one of these days.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Pretty good mac n cheese reciepe - i added another 4 oz of vermont white cheddar because it didn't look cheesy enough when i mixed everything together, and also added two scallions. I usually just make mac n cheese on the stove with just pasta, milk and cheese, but i'm on the search for an out of this world macaroni reciepe. i would probably make it again, but it wasn't much better than my basic mac n cheese so i haven't decided if it's worth the extra effort. I have to say that i like mac n cheese super cheesy, and this isn't really that kind of a reciepe. It definitely has more flavor than others, and i like the healthy addition of cottage cheese (which i abhore usually). Not super smooth, but i'd rather have flavor than the fake cheese smoothness (yuck!). and i didn't have any problems with leftovers being dry, as some reviewers have noted. just reheat on 50-60% microwave power for a longer time, and mix halfway through. All in all, a flavorful, decent reciepe (just add extra cheese!!!)

For some reason, I was a bit paranoid to make this because it had cottage cheese in it! But according to friends, they thought it was one of the best they've ever had. I didn't put any sour cream in it, but I put some splashes of 1% milk. The cheeses I used were shredded Sharp Cheddar... and a shredded 3 Cheese blend. I also used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs (without the butter, like other reviewers suggested) and garlic powder. This is best served with some tomato soup! :)

I don't know how to say this is the best stuff-but to say "this is the best stuff". It would be good with or without the crumb topping. Sooo creamy. I will never make another recipe for mac and cheese but this one.

This was a simply amazing, flavorful gourmet mac 'n' cheese. Now a HUGE FAVORITE in my family! Definitely worth trying. I added about 2 T of cayenne pepper sauce to spice it up.

I made this tonight  and I did not change a thing.   I think this recipe tastes very sharp with nothing to balance that flavor.  My biggest problem with this recipe is that it is not at all like a traditional comfort food mac and cheese.   It  comes out white and is kinda creamy but the flavor is off.   I was craving mac and cheese and took a special trip to get everything to make it.   I'm going to keep looking for the perfect mac and cheese dish because this one is not it.

I started making this recipe and at first I was skeptical....it was kind of soupy, didn't look very good and even my husband made a face. I put it in the oven and the whole house began to smell wonderful, even my two year old mentioned it. The end result was amazing!!!! We loved this mac & cheese and will be making it again!!! I made it exactly as as called for except no added salt and used regular cottage cheese (couldn't find small curd) Thank you for a great recipe!!!!!

Doubled all the ingredients except for the bread crumb topping, and it was perfect. Also added a little bit of rice milk just to ensure it didn't go dry. This was so easy, and it's absolutely delicious!

This has become our very favorite Mac and cheese recipe!  I make it as written (although sometimes my fresh grated Parmesan is actually Parmesan, Romano, Asiago blend).   My daughter's boyfriend also loves it and, I think, could eat the entire pan himself.  Not sure how it tastes the next day because we've never had any leftovers. Thank you for a wonderful, comforting, delicious side dish. Four thumbs up from this family of cheeseheads!  MMMMmmmmm.

This recipe is delish! I make pretty much the way it says in the recipe, except I don't really measure anything. This makes it end up tasting a little different every time, but we don't mind. The only thing I really do differently is that I skip the bread crumb/butter mixture. Instead, I just save a little of the grated cheese to sprinkle on top, and then sprinkle the bread crumbs on top of that before I put it in the oven. It still gets nice and crispy on top, but without the added butter! Yum! I will be making this for supper tonight!

Love this mac and cheese!  It's the only kind of mac and cheese we eat now. The only change I make is using Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.

Yummy. My son loved it. Its the best mac and cheese I've ever had. I did add a bit of milk to jus give it a bit of moisture and used less breadcrumbs as suggested by other reviewers.
Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!  I did follow the tip to only use 1/4 cup of bread crumbs which was a little too wet for me so I increased to 1/2 cup and adding a 1/2 cup of milk turned out perfect!  Will be making frequently!

This has become a family party regular recipe for me.  The problem with this recipe is that it doesnt travel well.. you have to pretty much eat it right out of the oven, so it doesnt work for potlucks.  As it sits it dries out quickly, even with LOTS OF added milk.  Cooking it too much or reheating makes the noodles soggy.  However, right out of the oven This recipe is just like my grandma used to make.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I put the cottage cheese in a food processor to grind out the chunks.  I then blended into the cottage cheese 1/2 cup milk and other reviewers suggested to prevent dryness.  I also made sure to use REAL shaved parmesean cheese from the deli instead of the crumbled kraft kind.  I think this made a huge difference, and the dish had a bit more flavor.  If you don't like the "fake" tasting TV dinner mac and cheese, this is for you.  Extremely creamy, flavorful and smooth.

Unless you are a fan of cottage cheese, don't use the cottage cheese.  The taste doesn't come right away but more so in the after taste. IF I made it again, I would leave it out completely, use farmers cheese or ricotta cheese (with some butter for added moisture) in it's place or maybe just add an additional package of shredded cheese.  I like to use potato chip dips in place of sour cream for added flavor.  French onion dip puts a nice subtle onion flavor into this.  This is a good recipe in itself but may need alterations due to personal tastes.

Excellent Mac & Cheese recipe!  In fact, the best i've ever made!  I did make a few adjustments because let's face it -- Mac & Cheese is very forgiving and a great way to use up what we already have on hand.  I used radiatore pasta, roughly 10 oz of Cabot Extra Sharp Cheddar, a 16 oz container of cottage cheese, the 8 oz called for of sour cream, skipped the parmesan but used a can of cheese soup to help make up the difference.  I also only baked it for @ 15 minutes (just long enough to crisp the bread crumbs on top).  I find that baking Mac & Cheese for too long makes it dry out.  The result?  AWESOME!!!  Thanks MRSO!

Who wouldn't try a recipe when one of the reviews says it's better than sex? Made this exactly as written but it's not creamy or cheesy enough for me. Also, I'm not a big fan of the texture of cottage cheese. I will try again but modify and see if I have better luck. Hubby liked it!

I did not like the sour cream in this at all. This may work better as a casserole with some chicken and veggies. But for mac and cheese I found the taste and texture not to my liking.

This is my fmaily's favorite mac & cheese.  Everytime I make it, I have people wanting the recipe.  I do add some milk to recipe to avoid it being too dry if there are any leftovers.

Very good, I added garlic powder with the salt and pepper.  Next time I will add a stronger cheddar, the flavor of the cheese seems rather subdued.

This recipe has GREAT flavor, but made as directed mine -did-turn out a little dry. I'll definitely make again, but will add an extra 1/4-1/2C each of the sour cream & cottage cheese, and maybe some milk, as well. 
Also note: half the bread crumbs called for will be more than enough to give it that extra-special kick.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was really good and rich.  I made it exactly as directed, but doubled recipe.  I had to bake it a little longer due to doubling the recipe.  I don't think it is dry, as others have mentioned.  It isn't a super creamy mac n cheese, but that doesn't bother me or anyone else in my family that tried it...great and easy recipe!

awesome recipe!! i've made it for a couple of potluck dinners and everybody has raved about it. the real kicker is the buttery bread crumbs on top that form a nice crust. i like the consistency of the cheese as well. followed the recipe to the T.

I must say I was certainly surprised when I made this tonight and it was yummy! I made sure to add the milk that others suggested and I threw some all beef hot dog bits into the mix. I also added some garlic powder to it as well since I saw a lot of people saying it was too bland. I must say this came out GREAT!

This is so creamy and yummy. I doubled the recipe and added a cup of milk and a cup of diced ham. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used white cheddar cheez-it crackers. Will definetly make this again and again. Thanks Chuck!

This mac and cheese is addictive. It is even better if you have some leftover ham to dice up and add to it, but is wonderful either way. I have made this recipe several times.

The cottage cheese texture takes some getting use to, but I tell myself that it compensates for even more cheese which would really load on the fat.  I skip the breadcrumbs because the one tried I tried it, I wasn't a fan so I now sprinkle some real bacon bits (not the jarred stuff).  Good recipe for when you are feeling in the mood to eat bad. :)

I absolutely love this recipe! The whole family loves it. I don't do the bread crumbs on top, but I do add butter and mild cheddar cheese over the top so its still gets nice and crispy. Love the flavor that the cottage cheese and sour cream adds.. although you could never guess the ingredients.

It has good flavor, but the bread crumbs take away from the Mac and Cheese. Also, I felt weird putting cottage cheese in Mac and Cheese.

Love this recipe!  I've always made it with sharp Cheddar, monterey, and mozzarella (about 4 oz each) and it tastes great!  I highly suggest adding the 1/2c milk as stated in previous reviews.

This was really good and so easy to make.  I did not add the bread crumbs on top as my kids are purists.  The only other change I made was to add 1/2 cup milk, per other reviewer suggestions.  That said, the only reason that this didn't get 5 stars is that my kids didn't like it!  My husband and I really liked it though.  However, the search continues for a yummy recipe that is homemade - gotta get rid of the Kraft boxes!

Made this for Easter dinner with the family.  Should have made a double batch, it went that quick!  Added extra as other reviewers suggested to keep it from being too dry, used 1/2 cup but probably could have bumped it up another 1/2 cup and been ok.  Added garlic and onion powders to the macaroni mix and paprika to the panko I used on the top.  Definitely will be making again!

This is the very best mac and cheese I've ever had.  Its as good as any restaurant style.  Even the leftovers were delicious !  I followed the suggestions of others and added a 1/2 cup of milk and i seasoned the noodles with garlic and onion powder to taste.  I will definitely make this again !!

So good!  I brought this to a family pot luck and everyone loved it!  I did add some garlic and onion powder, and 1 tablespoon of milk, but otherwise followed the letter of the recipe.

i've been using this site for years and this is my first review just because i was so impressed with Chuck's recipe. the only change i made was use Panko breadcrumbs which turned out so yummy! i also browned the top more by broiling it the last few minutes. the result was crunchy, creamy, cheesy goodness...and the rest is history!

I was skeptical with this recipe as I have always made the white sauce based mac & cheese.  I even used the creamed cottage cheese vs the small curd and I still not like the taste or the texture.  I will stick with the tried and true white sauce mac & cheese.

I was skeptical at first, but let me tell you this is the best baked mac I have ever tasted! I added fresh chopped bacon, 1/2 cup milk, some green onion, dash of garlic powder, paprika and cayenne pepper. I also coated the top with a thin layer of cheddar and halved the amount of bread crumbs- yum! My new favorite mac n cheese.

Doesn't compare to my 5 cheese mac, made with a traditional white sauce.  This is almost like a baked dip due to the cottage cheese and sour cream.  Definitely agree on reducing the bread crumbs and adding shredded cheese on top, half cup milk to add moisture too.  Better than a box but not worth more than 2 stars.  I make the homemade mac quite often for my husband and thought this was better based on the reviews, it's not.

Best mac i've ever had!  Already signed up to make it at family Christmas dinner.  I added 8oz gruyere cheese too!  Divided it into 2 small pryex to try 1 dish with breadcrumbs and 1 dish without breadcrumbs.  Result:Ditch the crumbs, they dry it out a little.  I graded 1/2 inch layer of gruyere on top of the "non-bread crumb" version and set oven to broil for the last 5 minutes.  It was incredible. C'est Bon, Sha!

Delicious! I was tempted to add milk after reading reviews, but decided to follow recipe.  So glad I did! I baked in an 8X8 and when I scooped it out had delicious crunch to go with every bite. My hubby claimed it was the best mac & cheese I've made yet.  Thanks!

So decadent! My family are not mac n' cheese lovers, but this was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. The only 2 extra things I added were 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard powder, and 1 tablespoon dehydrated onion. Better than any restaurant mac n' cheese!

We loved it.  I meant to add milk like someone suggested, but forgot.  It was good without it, but would have made it a little creamier.  We also added a little crushed red pepper and onion.  GREAT recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.  Also the easiest baked mac and cheese I've ever made.  Literally just combine everything and put it in the oven.

This was a great recipe.  Very simple to make.  I found it a bit rich - I think I'd only be able to make it a couple of times a year to save my waistline!  But my husband adored it and wants me to make it like this from now on.  I added some chopped onion and made a smaller amount of topping with Italian bread crumbs.

I didn't care very much for this mac and cheese. It didn't taste very much like mac and cheese at all, and the cottage cheese made it a little weird. Thanks for sharing though.

Not our favorite.  I should have left off the bread topping, it doesn't really add anything to the dish other than calories.  A couple of guest said they liked it and it was easy to put together at the last minute, so I gave it 3 stars.  I probably will not make again. Thanks for sharing.

We made this exactly as written and it was not bad, but not great. Very tangy with the sour cream and cheddar. A little heavy on the bread crumbs. However, I think this is a great casserole base with some of the changes other suggested like adding onion, peas and ham. We may try it again with those changes.

MMM...sooo good! Chuck is a genius! This recipe was just what I was looking for! Outstanding flavor, creamy texture..nothing like many of the other drier versions I have tried in the past. I used 24 oz. light cottage cheese, 8 oz light sour cream, about 8 oz. plain yogurt, 8 oz sharp cheddar, about 10-12 oz pasta, eyeballed the bread crumbs, sprinkled a little extra Parmesan over the top and then drizzled with olive oil instead of using butter. The whole family loved it!

I see that a lot of people made modifications, but this is absolutely delicious as is.  I used reduced fat sour cream and cottage cheese.  Maybe in the future (because I definitely will be making this again), I will play around with some more cheeses.  My family LOVED it, and we are a fan of the breadcrumbs, so we enjoyed that this recipe had a lot.  3/4 cup would still be plenty though I'm sure.  It even makes great leftovers, and tastes just as good as the first time.

This was too dry and that was with extra milk. It wasn't wet and dripping with cheese like the kind of mac and cheese I was looking for. It was even worse the next days. Wouldn't make this again

Put this together with what I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe, but only had a 16 oz. cottage cheese container so that is what I used.  It looked a bit dry, so after stirring it in the pan I poured a little under a cup of milk over it before adding the topping.  For the topping I used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs, it was crunchy and yummy.  I will make this again.

I loved this recipe!  I did make some changes.  I fried 1/4 cup finely chopped onion in 2 tsp garlic butter and I added ~1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to the cheese.  I added 1/2 cup of half and half as well.  I also sliced 2 tomatoes and placed them on top of the butter and breadcrumb mixture.  Then with about 5 minutes left, I topped everything with some parm. cheese and when it was done baking, I broiled it until it browned.  Such a warm and hearty dinner.  Thanks very much for the recipe!

AWESOME!!! I will never go back to the traditional way of making mac-n-cheese.. I followed the instructions but made some alterations.. I did used BARILLA Multigrain- Elbows and Whole Grain Medium Shells I used 8 oz. of each because I was making a huge pan of this. So naturally I had to increase the amount of sour cream and cheese. I kept with the same amount of cottage cheese. I did alter the topping, I used bread crumbs w/ mixture of crunched up potato chips, I also put a little shredded cheese in the mix of the topping....  WHEN IT WAS DONE IT WAS GREAT.. I must say when I make it next week again for thanksgiving I will also add to the topping crunched up bacon..  I have uploaded pictures of what I made today.

It was a good mac and cheese, but I was looking for a creamy southern style recipe.  The kids and family all thought this was good.  Would make again.

Both my husband and I are macaroni and cheese fans, and we both did not like this recipe.  The cottage cheese gives it a really weird texture, and the flavor was quite bland.  After trying this, we tried the next best recipe (Four Cheese Macaroni) and it was TO DIE FOR.

Very good. Very Easy. Less time consuming than making traditional bechemel sauce. If you were looking for the traditional mac n cheese, this would not be for you. I added a few more spices. I always tweak a recipe, who doesn't.

My brothers and I made this for lunch once and were rather disappointed. Coming from WI, we like the type of mac&cheese that has a thick, creamy, smooth, sauce with cheese all over the place. This was no doubt tasty, but not the right texture.

Very good.  The big kids ate it (8 & 10) the little ones (2 & 3) would not.   ****changes  I added 3/4 cups of 2% milk and melted all cheeses and milk together prior to adding to noodles.  Used 1 pound of medium shells also.  Next time I would use more cheddar or a smoked swiss.  I also threw in 1/2 pound of kielbasa so this was a main entree.

I am not sure why this mac and cheese got so many good reviews. I am amazed at how many people had to adjust the recipe - and surprise! I had to adjust it myself when it came time to cooking it in the kitchen because following the directions like it says just doesn't work. I think that if I am getting a recipe online I shouldn't have to make any changes! Maybe the amount of salt, cheese, etc. I ended up doubling the recipe to 12 people and it just wasn't enough. Since I was making it the day of the party, it made me stressed to have to worry about it. Just because it has a high review with a lot of reviewers doesn't mean it's good, unfortunately. I'd advised to "shop around" for other recipes first before using this one!

The taste was great, but the contistancy was griddy. Next time I will blend all the ingredients together (minus the noodles) I also added about 3/4 cup of milk. I like my mac and cheese creamy.

Maybe I just like a different kind of mac and cheese, but this was too cottage-cheesy. We were looking for more of the kind you get at a steak house with gooey cheese. I felt the sour cream added a lot but the cottage cheese just made it a weird texture. I'll try other recipes before I go back to this one.

No one in my family is into dry mac and cheese which by the reviews this seemed to be. Rather than keep looking I just swapped the cottage cheese for 1 can of Campbell's condensed cheese soup and 1/4 cup milk. It kept the same mild undertones as the cottage cheese and didn't make it clumpy, it was creamy, not runny but not dry, perfect. The topping makes WAY to much unless you usually layer a 1/2 in thick crust on top. I cut it to 3/4 breadcrumbs and still only used half. I will try a cracker crumble instead of bread crumbs next time as it was a little too fine for my taste. Served with chicken fried chicken of this site.

Oh my goodness, this was so delicious!!!  This will definitely be something I make again, and again.  I did follow a few suggestions of the other reviewers.  First, I added 1/2 a cup of milk so the leftovers would not be dry.  Secondly, I cut the bread crumbs down to 1/2 of a cup.  The next time I will increase the bread crumbs to 3/4 of a cup.  1 cup would have been a bit much, but 1/2 of a cup was definitely too sparse.  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!

So yummy! I used club crackers with butter, and I smoothed the cottage cheese in a blender with some milk (maybe 1/2 cup) I thought this was so creamy and delicious. I jumped right on to give my 5 stars. I will make this all the time.

I made this twice: once by following the recipe exactly, next by omitting the bread crumbs and adding half & half cream with the different cheeses... I liked it better the 2nd time. Either way, fantastic recipe!

This was absolutely wonderful. Added milk as many reviewers suggested and other than that followed it almost exactly, just added a little extra cheddar cheese, well, because it is my favorite! I've made this many times and I always get rave reviews by all. Also, I most usually use all low-fat products to help reduce the fat content, and it tastes just at great! Thanks.

This was excellent!!  I quadrupled the recipe for a Thanksgiving family get together and it was a huge hit!  I followed everything to the T, except, I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream since I had it on hand (and a few other reviews I read indicated it's not as creamy as they'd like).  I separated the mac n' cheese into 2 very large casserole pans.  I didn't add the breading/butter mixture to one just to see if I liked it better with or w/ out that.  (since other reviews also stated the bread crumbs on top make it even drier.  I wasn't sure what else I could add to make it creamier with out changing the taste, but it was delicious.  I do think it would have been just as good creamier though!  So I wonder if there is something I could add to help that out, but not change the taste very much. Anyway, this was a great side for our HUGE Thanksgiving Day dinner!

I loved this!  So easy!  I made a double batch.  I cooked 1/2 and put the other half in a zip lock bag and just baked that 1/2 tonight.

I suppose I could put 1/2 in a freezer bag and it would keep.

Too much bread crumbs.  I really think it's better to just do a roux and add cheese and milk and stir and bake.  I tried this to just throw together and bake, but not saucy and rich like we like our mac n cheese.  Sorry!

This mac and cheese lacks in everyway.  I would recommend changing this recipe entirely if one was to make this, invariably creating an entirely new recipe.

I wont try this again. I followed the recipe to a T and the cottege cheese didnt melt properly. I thought the taste was good but the texture was not something I cared for at all. A bit grainy and the cottege cheese curds were odd.

Mmmmm! I made this today for our church potluck tomorrow. I doubled the recipe, but  I really didn't need to! I'm glad I did, because I am sitting here eating the extra. I gave it only four stars because I made a few changes. Instead of adding the shredded cheese to the macaroni, I made a roux of about 2 tbsp butter and flour, then added about 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of half and half. I let it thicken and added all the cheeses. After I removed it from the heat I added the sour cream. I mixed the noodles and cheese sauce in 2 9x13s, topped with the butter and PANKO breadcrumb mixture, and browned it in the top third of the oven for 10-15 minutes. The Panko makes all the difference-I love the extra crunch! I will definitely make this again-it will be replacing my family recipe in this house!

I like to try new recipes on this site based on their rating.  I figured with the high rating this recipe had I couldn't go wrong...I was WRONG.  I followed this recipe EXACTLY the way it is with no changes.  I am so disappointed.  This was dry, sticky, flavorless macaroni and cheese.  My husband who will eat anything had a hard time with this one.  I thought the bread crumbs and butter baked on top would be crispy, but it was dry and crumbly and made it harder to eat.  Sorry, this isn't all it's cracked up to be.  I prefer boxed mac n cheese to this.

This is my first review on this site although I've tried a ton of recipes.  This mac n cheese is amazing!  Try the recipe "as is" the first time you make it (great)  but then it's fun to experiment.  I add roasted jalapenos and bacon to mine but by all means go crazy.

This was extremely good! I realized after I made it that I forgot to add the sour cream, but it was still great! I can imagine how much greater it would be with it! I followed the recipe as written except I added 16oz of cottage cheese instead of 12oz and I only used half the butter and bread crumbs. I also sprinkled chopped parsley on top for color. I will definitely be making this again.

Almost everyone in my family liked this.  I will make a few changes next time I make it though.  TOO /MUCH BREAD CRUMBS ON THE TOP.  Instead of the cup it calls for I think I'll go with 1/2 cup, maybe less.  And next time I will go with a little less sour cream.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe. It is light tasting and I used organic seasoned multigrain croutons that I smashed up for the topping and the croutons have a great taste that really made this for me. I followed the recipe exactly except I uzed mini ziti noodles instead of macaroni because I was out. They are basically the same size without the bend. Sprinkle some fresh cracked pepper on top and it is ready to go!

Good, but not great.  This did not have good eye appeal.  I scaled the recipe to 3 servings, but easily got 5 servings. I had to sub ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese because that is what I had. This may be why it came out

My family of 4 thougt this recipe was a good base recipe.  I should have read some of the reviews about the bread crumbs, way to much, almost tasted like sand on top of the mac-n-cheese.  I don't think it had enough flavor, that is why I'm only giving it a 4 star. Next time I think I'm going to add in a few different bolder cheeses, like an asiago cheese to give it a bolder flavor.  Also I agree with other posters, I think people where getting dry mac-n-cheese most likely because they used the whole box of pasta rather than 1/2 the box, mine was very creamy.
Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars because if I had made it exactly as the recipe stated, this would be fantastic.  I always feel guilty over the white pasta and fat content, so I alter recipes to make it lower in everything.  Because of that, this was a 4 star recipe... But that isn't fair to Chuck!  His recipe with white pasta and high fat cheese HAS to be delicious!!!  This was a good recipe without those things, so I can only imagine how yummy and comforting this mac-n-cheese would be with starch and fat added! If you want an alternative, try whole wheat pasta and reduced fat cheeses and lower salt. Add a pinch of milk for moistness ~ Still pretty darn good.  Makes a big batch, too!

My family loves mac and cheese and they would not eat this after I made it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it ended up very dry, and everyone complained especially about the bread crumb topping.  I was disappointed after seeing it was a 4.5 star recipe.  I will not make this recipe again.

I took Chucks idea and everyone else's suggestions and ran with it...used whole wheat pasta and all low fat cheeses and skim milk.  I mixed in sliced green onion and bacon bits with the pasta and cheese.  My husband was making spinach dip while I was throwing it together, so I added some fresh spinach too.  I also added a layer of sliced fresh tomatoes in the middle.  It came out so delicious and good.  I'm dieting and it fed my desire for some gooey, cheesy, creamy comfort food...and I was able to cut out a lot of the fat and calories with substitutions.  I think I'll add grilled chicken and diced ham and create a Club Casserole out of it.

I also think I'll try Chuck's actual recipe as a side dish for other meals. It is a very nice base recipe. I love that it can be made with low fat options!

I tried this recipe yesterday for Christmas and I was a little worried at first because it had sour cream and cottage cheese, but everyone loved it. My husband, who doesn't even like to eat mac and cheese, loved it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

I just made this for my daughters Thanksgiving potluck at school.  So easy and it turned out so good.  Several of the parent's were commenting on how good it was and asked for the recipe.  I did follow other reviewers and blended my cottage cheese until smooth, added a little milk, and then I topped it with cheese.  One reviewer mentioned they use fat free cottage cheese and fat free sour cream and no one can tell the difference.  I bet it would turn out just fine that way.  I think I'll try that next time.  Really a great recipe, tasted like a lot of work went into it.  Thank you for sharing.

To me it wasn't "mac and cheese" - but it was a very tasy dish! My hunsband and I both agreed that it even tasted better warmed up the next night! I give it a four though because we both didn't care for the bread-crumb topping. Maybe some french-fried onions for a bit of a crunh, but the bread crumbs were a bit overwhelming! I will make this again!

This is now one of the most requested side dishes I make.  A great change from traditional mac and cheese.  I add 1/2 cup milk to keep it moist and  I omit the bread crumb topping.  To make it a meal, I add diced ham, chicken or tuna.

This is 'classic' macaroni and cheese (not pasta with a creamy sauce like so many reviewers seem to prefer).  It is thick and very cheesy - no runny sauce in this one! This is the BEST recipe - my entire family (and extended family!) loves this recipe and it will continue to be the only mac & cheese recipe I make!

This recipe was very tasty and well-received by my husband & me.  A couple of comments, however:  Contrary to a couple of previous comments, my dish came out alot creamier than I expected.  Who knows?  Maybe I put more cottage cheese or sour cream than the recipe called for.  Also, I added about a tablespoon of cumin and a dash of pepper to the mixture.  Next time, I may add more sour cream (vs. cottage cheese) for that extra "zing."

My 7 year old is a connousseur in this department.  She absolutely loved it and so did I.  Easy and inexpensive to make.  Very creamy and delicious.  Used about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs instead of the recommended 1 cup and also added little link sausage.  Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was good, but I tweaked it a bit.  I used three different kinds of cheese and 1 and 1 half times the amount of cheese as the recipe called for. I used; shredded sharp cheddar, shredded colby jack and shredded velveeta(comes already shredded in a pkg.) and then added the cottage cheese, sour cream and parmesan cheese the recipe called for.  I made the topping out of 1/2 cup cracker crumbs mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/2 tsp. paprika.  It was very good.  My fiance loved it, and he's a big mac and cheese fan. Maybe it's because his name is Chuck, also. ;) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe because my son is such a fanatic about his mac & cheese.  It didn't go over very well.  He said it was dry, and didn't have a "cheesy" flavor.  I didn't care for it either.  My husband thought it was okay.  We just tossed the leftovers.

Sorry, not one of us liked this recipe. It had a weird taste and the topping was too much and flavorless. It wasn't creamy at all. I even doubled this recipe because I was sure we would love it too.

On the whole we enjoyed this dish, following the advice of others in terms of adding milk to enhance creaminess.  Also used 1 cup french fried onions in mixture.

This is good, but I would cut the bread crumbs down by half- maybe more. Too many bread crumbs for our taste. I'd also use extra sharp cheddar in place of just sharp cheddar. It is good, but not the very best.

I am a fan of traditional Macaroni and Cheese. Unfortunately, this recipe did not make a convert out of me.  I was skeptical when I saw the ingredients, but decided to give it a try based on the rave reviews from others.  For me, the sole bright spot was the topping, (I used crushed Ritz & melted butter), aside from that, I was unimpressed.  I even added a shot of mustard for a boost of flavor, but even that wasn't enough.  It wasn't terrible, but for my taste, there are better recipes on this site, like Chef John's Macaroni & Cheese or Grandma's Macaroni & Cheese.

After reading a few negative reviews, I was nervous to try this, but then again, it's pasta and cheese....how does it really end up bad? I did read that it wasn't cheesy enough so I doubled the cheese (maybe it's because I'm from Wisconsin though too) and skipped the cottage cheese. Instead I used a little bit of heavy whipping cream & milk since I needed to get rid of it. It turned out very good. My boyfriend said he liked it even better for lunch the next day after it had time to sit. We added chicken sausage to the recipe and it complimented the mac and cheese perfectly. Next time we will try adding beef & some hot sauce to spice it up a bit.

I found it to be dryer than I like.  Next time I will leave off the breadcrumbs and top with more grated cheese.  If this were  made with gluten free pasta and no crumbs, it would be perfect for those with gluten  intolerance!

The recipe calls for 8 oz. not a BOX of macaroni; my mistake but that's why it was dry and others rate it the same. I pureed the cottage cheese with 1/2 cup milk but it still wasn't creamy; probably because I used a box of macaroni and not 8 oz. I will try this recipe again.

I made this recipe as directed, however I used cheez-its(without the butter)instead of bread crumbs and added a layer of parmesan on top.  We did 20 minutes in the oven and 20 minutes in the smoker.  Everyone at the party loved it and took home all the leftovers, but I was honestly a bit disappointed.  I was really looking for a creamier texture and tangy bite and I just don't feel like this recipe delivered.  I have a feeling most of the guys liked it because of the smoke flavor, but I'm not a huge fan of the smoke and I think otherwise it may not have been such a big hit.  For me it was just ok.  This was really my first time making homemade mac n' cheese, but I think I'll keep looking for a recipe with a creamier consistency. Thanks anyway

I thought this was delicious! My only question is if anybody has tried to purée the cottage cheese and if it changes anything? While it tastes great, I think it looks unappealing with the chunks of cottage cheese.

It took me several times to Master this, but now its an absolute hit. Everywhere I go where it involves bringing a dish I am asked to bring this dish. The key is really reading the reviews. I found I liked it better with more yellow cheddar, and I like to add some ricotta as well. I also used heavy whipping cream to help keep it nice and moist. My family absolutely loves it!

AMAZING & SPECTACULAR.....would definitely be on the menu if this were my last meal on earth!!!  I usually make a double batch in a lasagna pan, and I sub extra shredded cheddar on top instead of bread crumb / butter topping. I recommend adding a 1/2 cup of milk to the pasta mix before baking (1 cup if you're making a double batch). This will keep it moist when you reheat it the next day. This is definitely a dish that will have people singing your praises!  Thank you MRSO!!!

I personally love this recipe!  I don't make it often because of the calorie count and because my husband doesn't care for it at all.  Of course, this is the man who thinks the best mac and cheese has a can of condensed tomato soup in it (blech!)  I think in order to truly appreciate this you have to like all the ingredients going into it.  If you are looking for a boxed mac and cheese flavor then you need to buy boxed mac and cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is SO easy and delish. Easily doubled to make a heaping casserole to feed a crowd. Make sure to add some milk to keep it moist (no more than 3/4 cups if you double the recipe!).

The only change I made to this recipe was using mild cheddar instead of sharp because I prefer it so it's what I have on hand. It is now in the oven for the second time exactly the same because it's perfect, as far as I'm concerned. My 4-year-old can't get enough of it, and his dad acted like a little kid when I told him I was making it because he loved it so much last time. It's a perfect way to get little kids to eat their supper and could be easily tweaked to increase the protein or decrease the fat. Well done to the creator of this recipe! A family favorite for sure.

Not too bad, but certainly wouldn't make it again.  I just happened to have cottage cheese on hand, but the tang of sour cream is not good to us.  I'm known for my macaroni and cheese, but never mind trying a different way of making it.  My granddaughter did eat some, but she's 3!

My family loves this recipe. My son won't eat anything with sauce (not even spaghetti) so we love the types of Mac and cheese that aren't creamy like Velveeta. Since he is gluten free, for health reasons, we substitute bread crumbs for ground up honey nut Chex and it adds great flavor! You have to make sure to cook your pasta al dente or it can get soggy.

I have tried 2 dozen mac & cheese recipes and this one is by far the best.  if you ask me you dont need to change a thing.  it is perfect just the way it is.  Made it a few times for the family and then for a party of 80 people.  everyone loved it, and thought i had it catered. lol  Finally a mac & cheese that everyone loves.  Thanks Chuck !!!

Very good the day it's made, but if you like leftovers like we do it's very dry. It's not your creamy Mac & cheese, but it's still yummy. Next time I make it I'm going to add some milk to see which way I like it better.

I was worried about the cottage cheese & sour cream because I make a more traditional mac & cheese, but I wanted to try something new.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised! This was really good, & the entire family enjoyed it (even my picky eaters).  I did use fat free sour cream & low fat cottage cheese but those were the only changes I made.  I will make again.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a stand-by for my family of 6.  If I have Velveeta I cube up about 6 oz and add to the recipe.  I usually double the amount of elbow macaroni.  I add a little crushed red pepper to the cheese mix & top the whole dish off with paprika before I bake it. Oh, I love this recipe!

A good base recipe. Kiddos loved it as is. The suggestions about adding milk were spot on-- definitely needed moisture. I'm also looking forward to adding more varied cheeses, and possibly a dash of cayenne. But it was lovely just as it was (with the milk, I mean.)

I love this recipe and have been making it for a few years now since it first arrived in my inbox.  Everyone always loves it and wants the recipe.  I don't put the breadcrumbs on top, just extra cheese and sometimes some sliced tomato.

Great. Add ritz crackers crushed instead of bread crumbs, and cook pasta until it's only about halfway done (otherwise absorbs a ton and gets too soft in oven)

This is by far the easiest baked macaroni and cheese recipe I've ever made - just mix everything together in a large bowl with the boiled pasta and bake it.  Two modifications that I've made are:  using Panko breadcrumbs on the top (fluffier/crunchier/better texture) and using 1/2 sharp cheddar + 1/2 horseradish cheddar.  I've also prepared it adding chunks of smoked ham.  It's delicious and everyone loves it.

To Freeze: Only cook pasta for 2 minutes and omit bread crumb topping until day of cooking. Completely thaw in refrigerator then add bread crumb topping. Cook as usual.  If you add the topping before you freeze it, when you cook it, it is too greasy.

This mac n cheese is AH-MAZING tasting and I always get asked for the recipe.  Sometimes I'll bake this and then portion it out and freeze it for a quick lunch for the kiddies.  Just microwave and they LOVE it! I like to use extra-sharp cheddar. Chuck has great taste!

This is so good and easy.  I did add a about 8 oz of velveeta but I'm sure any cheese that melts really creamy would work well.  Also added about a 1/2 c. milk.

Yum!!!  Guess what!!??  We added a small can of green chilis and a few diced jalapenos to this and it made it go kung pow!!  I would do a layer of the mac and cheese into the bottom of the pan... sprinkle some bread crumbs.. then pour the rest of the mac and use the remaining read crumbs so that the crumbs aren't overwhelmingly stuck to the top noodles only.  Love this!!  Would be great for a movie night with friends with some beers!

I was skeptical about this being good. But my picky kids LOVED it. It was so much better than I thought. The only change I made was to add lil' smokies chopped. Next time I think I'll try it with chopped bacon.

My family loves this recipe and I'm now the designated mac and cheese cook for family gatherings . I'm not a big fan of mac and cheese in general but this recipe is one I cannot resist. Try it with panko breading if you like a nice crunchy top layer.

Best mac and cheese ever, and much easier than many homemade mac n cheese recipes. I didnt care for the breadcrumbs. I will use ritz next time. I used fat free sour cream and low fat cottage cheese, and it didnt seem to make a difference.

Great flavor! I definitely had to add a half cup of milk. My kids approved this recipe also. My only concern is I don't like the fact that you can see the cottage cheese after it is fully cooked. I may add more cheddar cheese next time to try to hide the cottage cheese.

it was pretty good. a smidge bland, but adding some extra salt/pepper afterwards really helped. i took the advice of others and added 1/2c of milk. i have no idea how you could make this without it! it would be SO dry. and i think the breadcrumbs listed is a perfect amount. maybe other people are using a smaller cooking container so it seems like too much for them? not sure.

This recipe prompted my first review on Allrecipes.com. It's amazing!! My husband LOVED it. We are mac & cheese lovers and always try it at various restaurants. This was my first time trying to make it at home & it turned out better than I expected. If you like thick, cheesy mac w/a little crunch on top, this is for you! I was hesitant to try it b/c of the cottage cheese & sr. cream but it was fantastic. I also added like 1/4 cup of chopped proscuitto, it added flavor. I forgot to salt & pepper it & it didnt need it. I also added more of both cheeses on top & used Garlic & Herb bread crumbs. I saw other reviews state it was too much bread crumbs, I agree, I would use about half of the suggest amount. This is seriously my new fav recipe!! Thank you Chuck!

Wow, this is a great recipe!   I was afraid that with the cottage cheese and sour cream, some one would complain, but my picky teenagers loved it!  I omitted the breadcrumbs, but that's just a personal preference, and still used a little bit of the butter to pour over the dish.  Excellent recipe.

Wow, great recipe.  But try Panko crumbs.  My husband doesn't even like cottage cheese or sour cream.  He said this was pretty tasty.  Not gritty either. I've never used panko crumbs but I've seen them in alot of restaurant m&c recipes.  I tried them and they were way better than bread crumbs.  This is the first time making this and its already a favorite.

Love this!! This does not use a lot of pans, like other Mac and cheese recipes, which is great for clean up.  I am not a big fan of bread crumb topping, so I just put extra sharp cheddar cheese on top and browned that. I will recommend this recipe to everyone from now on!!

Ever since I made this once for a dinner with friends, I'm ALWAYS asked to make this mac & cheese recipe! I use panko for the bread crumbs and also often substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream, because I make my own yogurt and generally have it around. As I always say with this recipe... five kinds of dairy; you can't go wrong!

I doubled the recipe for a large family vacation dinner and added boiled broccoli to the casserole before baking (boiled in the water with the macaroni).  It was pretty bland and there were too many crumbs.  Next time I will cut down on the crumbs and add something for flavour, just not sure what.  The best part about the recipe was using the sour cream and cottage cheese instead of making a white sauce, this really cut down on the prep time.

I made this for company last night.  I just now realized I didn't put in the parmesan cheese!  No matter as this was gobbled up post haste.  I wish I'd doubled the recipe!  My husband isn't a fan of sour cream, so I didn't tell him he was eating it until he commented how good this was.  I've got to make this again soon!

Can I just say sinful!  it was the best ever and I dont do mac and cheese. I used two cups of a fancy macaroni an not the shells.   I sauteed onion and put a layer on the top of it and covered it with panco bread crumbs. a million stars for you Chuck!  
 It was BTS.

fantastic recipe!  too easy to make as well...not too healthy to have this lying around the house all of the time.  i added chopped onion to taste (about half of a decent sized onion), and it came out perfect.

My husband and daughter both request this as their birthday meal. That says something. A bit rich for me. A pan of it doesn't even last 24 hours in our house. I use seasoned bread crumbs (Progresso) - adds some flavor.

It didn't have as much of a cheesy flavor as I was hoping.  Then again I fail at making flavorful mac and cheese recipes so maybe it was just me.

HOW is this recipe NOT number 1?

Literally best recipe in the WORLD!  Totally agree with the suggestion of adding just a tad of milk.

I like to do my mac&cheese "German" style by adding caramelized onions.  In Germany, they have their own version of Mac and Cheese and it's very common to add a layer of caramelized onions instead of breadcrumbs.  It's simply amazing!!  So I do both, add onions and top with breadcrumbs... yummmm!!!

This Mac and Cheese was delicious! I brought this mac and cheese to a BBQ and everyone devoured it. Now I am always asked to bring this dish to events. I usually only make mac and cheese for my kids but now I can eat it as well. 
 The only thing I did different is that I added 1/2 cup of milk as suggested from another review,
  This is now my go to Mac and Cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is crazy good! I have no idea why some people didn't like it, perhaps they tried to modify the recipe or something. The only thing I added was a few dashes of cayenne pepper to give it a little bite & I used crushed Ritz crackers istead of bread crumbs & butter like other reviewers suggested & it came out awesome! This is definately a keeper!

Fabulous.  Whenever my little grand-daughter sleeps over, we make a double batch.  We have one pan while she's here (with leftovers for Grammy and Grampy) and the other goes home with her to share with her family.

Wow, I love this. It's probably the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had! I only made a few changes. I added paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the bread crumbs and a pinch of paprika and cumin to the cheese mixture. Which I did not use all of, there was quite a bit left over. I also added about half a can of diced tomatoes, drained, which I will not do again. I didn't care for the flavor of this specific mac and cheese and tomatoes together. I will be making this on a regular basis. I love how quick and easy is it was, it's a great recipe!

I made this today for a big crowd. Doubled the recipe, and ditched the breadcrumbs. It was reeeally good and everyone liked it! But personally, I prefer something creamier. Looking through the reviews people were saying something about adding milk? I definitely will the next time I make this. It was pretty dry really fast. But otherwise, very yummy! First time ever making homemade mac n cheese--Success!

Looooved this mac & cheese. Super easy to make, really delicious. I did not add any extra milk, as other reviewers suggested, and did not find it dry at all. I also didn't find it to be too much breadcrumbs (as some others did) - though if you make it in a dish with less surface area than a 9x13 pan I could see this being a problem. I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs though. I also only had 10 oz cottage cheese (instead of 12). Will definitely be making this again.

This is a fabulous recipe and super fast and easy.  My kids and husband ate almost the entire dish.  They all had 2nd and 3rds.  Can't wait to make it for our next potluck.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Nope, this was not good. If milk was added and if the parmesan cheese and bread crumbs had been eliminated, it might have been decent. I will never make this again.

I used this recipe for my daughter's birthday party.  It was easy and cheap to make.  The only bad thing was that it was a little hard to mix the noodles, sour cream, cottage cheese and cheese.  

I would receommend less sour cream, cottage cheese and cheese than more.  However, the ingredient amounts seem correct.

very tasty, but might have used wrong cheese? I went with a standard old cheddar and might invest next time in a more sharp selection. Will also add milk next time as we did find it on the dry side. but overall worthy of a repeat attempt!!

I read all the reviews before making this recipe they were very helpful. One in particular said to use thick layer of cheese instead of bread crumbs. Another said they added jalapeno cheese dip for chips,great ideas. So when i made this i did both i added a 8oz bag of triple cheddar shredded cheese to top and added the jalapeno cheese to the mix , but i added grated parm cheese  to the top also. This recipe is awesome the entire family loved it . Thanks for all the added changes they made this dish great!!!

Way too dry!  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, and even added a little milk like others suggested, and it was still too dry.  If you're looking for the typical creamy, cheesey mac & cheese, this is not the recipe for you.

Very good! I used low fat cheddar and cottages cheeses and sour cream, with great results.  My husband really liked this style of mac and cheese said it was the best that Ive made.  Will make many more times in future.

Sorry, but not worth the hype if you are expecting a cheesy version.  Although easy preparation, I feel as though the cheese did not melt enough and the consistency was weird.  I'm going to stick with a rue based mac n cheese.

I really liked this recipe, I made bit exactly as written. The changes that I would make is to add some chopped onion 1/4-1/2 cup lightly sauted and as a reviewer stated maybe add some cream cheese to put it over the top.

I thought this was nice! Nothing spectacular but nice. I did love the flavor imparted by the sour cream, I'd never had that in a mac & cheese before. Halved the crumb topping, used 1/2 cup milk per other reviews, added dry mustard...  Very good overall and will make again.

I was skeptical about making this one for my family! WOW were we surprised! It was soooo good. I used low fat cottage cheese, sour cream and low fat cheddar as this is all I had on hand. It was yummy! I also added a tablespoon of finely chopped onion for some extra flavour. I will definitely be making this again!

was a HIT on thanksgiving. do NOT bother making this if you are a creamy, melted oozing macaroni & cheese lover (Like velveeta shells or kraft). this is not that kind of mac n cheese. this is "drier" & more gourmet.was told @ dinner that this recipe was like something they would serve @ steak house. very tasty. healthier because no eggs/cream & option to use lowfat/nofat ingredients.I did add milk & processed cheese. Make sure you put under boiler last few minutes..makes a wonderful yummy crispy top.

Very good - a different kind of mac and cheese.  Its totally different if you don't add the crumb topping.  I like it, but my kids prefer not to have that on top. We all like it - goes quick in our house!

I added milk as suggested in some of the other reviews and it still came out dry! It was not so tasty - added some mustard but it was still bland. My husband didn't like it at all and made himself Wacky Mac for dinner - I still have most of it in the freezer...

I have used this recipe for years and always asked for it.  My favorite version is to add a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos.....yummy!! I also add any extra bits of cheese I have on hand in addition to the cheddar.

Creamy - cheesy - I added 3/4 cup of milk to make it a little less custard like and moist enough to reheat

This is one of my favorite mac and cheese recipes! It's always a huge hit with my kids.  I read that some people said it's turned out dry for them so the first time I made it I used 16 oz of sour cream instead of the 8 oz it calls for. It's never been dry for me. I also usually add diced up deli ham to it. Thank you Chuck for this awesome mac and cheese recipe!

This is one of the few recipes that my entire family will eat AND they all love it!!!   Finally, our youngest son have given up the boxed mac and cheese for this recipe.  :)

Finally!  This will be our go-to macaroni dish.  It's so creamy, and the cottage cheese gives it an excellent texture.  It's good even if you don't bake it and can easily withstand additions like broccoli, beans, carrots or other sneaky pureed add-ins.

Great and easy recipe.  Perfect amount of cheese.  Used Italian breadcrumbs because that's all I had on hand and that added a nice bit of flavor and color.    Added a bit of garlic salt but otherwise kept things as they were meant to be.  Will definitely have this again and bring to potluck type events.  Thumbs up from both of my daughters as well!

Tastes good but has a funky texture.  Appearance is somewhat disconcerting as well. . .  Okay, I originally gave this 3 stars, but I'm upping it to 4 stars.  After it cooled and thickened up, the texture changed a bit.

I have made this numerous times and it is always a popular dish when I share it with friends and family. I try to use fat free or reduced fat ingredients when I can, and also sometimes add diced ham steak. I love how quick, easy and delicious this recipe is!

Very good.  Easy recipe.  I would recommend adding milk like the other reviews have.  Makes for a creamier dish and left overs (if you have any) will be less dry.  TFS!

I've been wanting to try this for a while and finally got my chance and what a disappointment!  The sour cream cottage cheese and cheddar just do not meld together.  Even my 4yr old wouldn't eat it....

I thought it was ok. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I really prefer my mac and cheese to be creamy. I didn't have as many bread crumbs, and I still thought there was too much. very creative recipe but it wasn't as good as I was hoping.

I had this recipe saved in my favorites for 6 months before trying, thinking it would be awesome. The ingredients sounded perfect. Overall I think it was too dry and kind of bland for my taste.

This was so easy and so yummy!  The only change I made was to use panko flakes as someonelse recommended and added a little garlic powder.  I recommend smooth cottage cheese for less texture though.

This is the only mac and chees I make now. My kids will no longer eat boxed mac and cheese they ask for the "homemade stuff".  I like to add a little Franks hot sauce to mine for a little zip.

I made this 3 times and everyone in the room enjoyed the mac and cheese except me.  It was a bit on the dry side and not creamy at all!  I need to try another recipe on this site.

I liked this quite a bit.  Mine came out nice and creamy, however I did use a bit more cottage cheese and a bit less sour cream - maybe 14oz. cottage cheese and about 4-5oz of sour cream.  I also used Colby-Jack reduced fat cheese and a few passes over the grater of parmesan.  I did not do the topping because I'm not a fan of that type of topping on mac & cheese and this topping seemed really heavy to me.  When we splurge on homemade mac & cheese, this will be one of my top 3 - thanks MRSO!

I dont write reviews often- but this is the BEST Mac and Cheese I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, I like the creamy mac and cheese, but the flavor and texture of this mac and cheese is to die for! Even my picky 2 year old (who doesnt normally like mac and cheese) LOVES it! Per other reviews I did add 1/2 cup milk. In the future I might add some onion, peppers and ham. Super good!!!

This is by far my favorite recipe for Mac and Cheese. I have tried many recipes and this is truly the best. The only thing i do differently is add a little cayenne and paprika to give it a little flavorful kick!

It's very important to use sharp cheddar cheese. If you like this recipe you should try the one of the Taste of Home website... Its called, Deluxe Macaroni 'n' Cheese. That recipe is my favorite Mac n Cheese recipe...Tasting this recipe before i baked it it just wasn't the same. but i think my fiance wont mind. its still pretty good. I like to make it in the summer because i tend to burn off the calories faster than i do in the winter ;)

wow! this recipe requires a lot of cheese! i got to watch how much i consume but i cant help it because its so darn good! i didnt have cottage cheese, so i threw in some random cheese i had in my fridge (cream cheese and gouda). still turned out great! i actually melted the cheeses together then pour the sauce into the pasta, then throw it in the oven! cuts back baking time. oh after baking, i actually scooped the mac and cheese into wontons in a muffin tin to make mac and cheese wontons! pretty neat combo! :)

I love this mac n' cheese. It is wonderful. I do eliminate the cottage cheese, as it is not something that I keep on hand (and I'm not a big fan either). This turns out so good. It reminds me of K&W's mac n' cheese. Perfect, in my opinion for a baked mac n' cheese. Sometimes I also leave the breadcrumbs off and just add extra cheese to the top. Heavenly, either way!

Very good with a few tweaks.  I puree together the cottage cheese, sour cream and about 1/3 cup milk - then stir in the cheese.  It really needs a little extra moisture from the milk to help it all melt together better. I also add a little seasoned salt and a dash of dry mustard.  I use fat free cottage cheese and sour cream - and skip the bread crumbs -  to lighten it up a bit.  I have also tried a mix of cheddar with colby jack - seems to melt together a little better than just plain cheddar.

I makes me laugh because this recipe is so easy, but I've become "famous" over the years because of this mac and cheese.  I often add some more cheddar, but other than that, I do just what Chuck says.

Not as creamy as I'd like but still good. Everyone else seems to love it when I make it. I follow the recipe excatly using the light or fat free vesion of sour cream.

This is FANTASTIC! I usually change recipes up a bit to add pizazz, but I made this according to the directions and it was perfect! I wouldn't change a thing. It's rich and creamy, but not too rich. It's always a hit every time I make it. 5 stars!!

I thought this recipe was disappointing and bland.  I was really looking forward to it because it sounded rich and interesting with the added cottage cheese and sour cream.  Instead, what I discovered was the flavor immediately disappeared when these two ingredients were added.  I added peas for added flavor and health since this isn't the healthiest recipe.  Honestly, I don't understand why this is so highly rated given it's overall bland taste.  I wouldn't make it again and will be throwing out the recipe after I'm finished writing this review.  I think there are much better mac & cheese recipes out there.  This one is definitely not a keeper.

5 star, with the following changes: add 1/3 to 1/2 cup half and half, change cheese to 4oz sharp cheddar and 8 oz american (it melts better and is more creamy) , bake 30 minutes. Omit the breadcrumbs altogether and sprinkle the remaining 4 oz sharp cheddar on top and bake additional 5 minutes. Everyone loved it!

i liked this a lot--doubled the recipe--added the extra milk suggested by others (used a can of milk which i think is a bit richer)--i like the drier texture, the bread crumb topping and the less cheddar flavor but can understand others might not--oh almost forgot --added dry mustard and cayanne pepper since that is how i always make mac and cheese--adds a little zip i guess

Not a fan of this recipe.  I followed recipe exactly and it just tasted like bakes noodles with too many bread crumbs.  Kids did not care for it either.

NOT A BAD FLAVOR, BUT SOMEWHAT LUMPY. PERHAPS THE CHEESE I USED DIDNT MELT WELL. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A MAC N CHEESE FOR THE KIDS. MY GRANDDAUGHTER did not care for IT BECAUSE OF THE SOUR TASTE. MORE FOR THE ADULT PALLET.

Very good for a baked mac and cheese!  Rave reviews and the family would like to have me make it again.  Next time I will use less bread crumbs as it tends to dry it out a litte more than I like.  I like just a little bit on top but for those that enjoy it crunchy, leave it like it is!

Incredible!  The flavors blend beautifully.  I had a small wedge of Brie, a few slices of swiss, an ounce of Velveeta, and an ounce of white aged cheddar that needed to be used up, so I chopped and grated it all and added it last minute to the mix.  Unbelievable burst of flavors!  I served it with some cut up polish sausage on the side and all together it equaled one fantastic meal.

This was a really good alternative for mac-n-cheese.  It was just a little "heavy", so maybe next time I'll skip the butter on top.  I did add a splash of milk and it was nice and creamy.  I have to say though, I was born and raised on the blue box, and to this day I am still a blue box girl...

This is what is so weird about different tastes and opinions - I didn't like this at all, but my husband went for seconds! I won't deny that this recipe is great, look at all awesome reviews! But it might just be me that didn't like it.

This recipe was really good.  I swapped out some of the cheese for other varieties because I didn't want to go to the Grocery store.  Didn't have cottage cheese so I used shredded mozzarella and some 1/2 and 1/2, crumbled club house crackers for the top... very tasty.  It's my fault it turned out a little dry I should have used more cream or gone and got cottage cheese.  Oh... also added a couple squirts of hot sauce, added a nice taste but it wasn't spicy... liked it.

I made this for the superbowl party we had.  It was sooooo good.  I can't believe how much everyone enjoyed this mac & cheese.  I did double the butter and add 1 cup of panko to the bread crumbs.  We will be enjoying this again soon!

I made this for four teenage boys and it was devoured with complements! They always eat a ton but they hardly ever note the flavor. It tasted fantastic. I made it twice and used ricotta once and small curd cottage cheese the second time and I think I preferred the small curd cottage cheese.   Thanks for the awesome mac and cheese!

mmm...I made this as a side to our New Years ham.  It was a HIT!  I doubled the recipe and it was perfect in a 9x13.  I did follow a few others suggestions and used sharp cheddar, i used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese, added 1/2 C. milk and about a Tbl of a random sweet/hot mustard i had in the fridge!  Everyone was asking for the recipe!

Oh man, dude this is by far the best Mac n Cheese I've ever had or made.  Whenever I have a potluck or people come over, this is the side dish I will be making.  I followed the recipe to the letter.   Perfect in an 8 X 8 dish.  Amazing, you the man!!

Fair. My sister in law gave me a recipe that included cream of chicken soup and melting the cheese. Now that was a creamy mac and cheese. I bet I could combine the two of this recipes and maybe add some spices like dill. Her recipe called for 1/2 tbs of mustard and a 1/2 tbs of mayo.

This was easy and everyone loved it, including the leftovers.   I added 1/2 cup light cream, used 1/2 cup bread crumbs with 1/4 cup melted butter, mixing them with finely crumbled crisp bacon for the top.  I don't think this recipe can go wrong.  We loved all the combined flavors with the sour cream and cottage cheese.  This is a keeper.

My family ADORES this recipe. We double everything and still end up with no leftovers. It is tangy and cheesy and everything that is great about macaroni and cheese. The only thing we do differently is that we put cooked crumbled bacon on top in the last 5 minutes of baking. We'll definitely be making this as often as possible.

I never want to make any other mac and cheese! Once I got over the fact that I could still see the curds from the cottage cheese (don't just expect them to go away like I did!) this was an amazing dish.

I followed this recipe to the letter. My husband and myself took one bite and discovered it tasted rather horrible..  Think we'll stick to the store bought boxed mac & cheese.

I made this last night for a pot luck and there wasn't a noodle left!  It is by far the best mac n cheese I've ever had in my life.    I used cavatappi instead of elbow macaroni.  To prepare, I cooked 1 pound of noodles and used 20 oz of sharp + extra sharp cheddar mixed, 16 oz of sour cream, 6 oz of cottage cheese, 1/4 cup of whole milk, 1/2 cup of grated parmesean, salt and pepper to taste... use your hand to mix together with noodles. I layered another 4 oz of shreddered cheddar as a topping before adding the butter/breadcrumb mixture.    I took everyone's sugggestions of adding less cottage cheese, more cheddar and some milk and it was absolutely wonderful! Thanks to all!!

Put entire recipe together the night before Thanksgiving and into the fridge.  All I had to do on on the busy day was to toast bread for breadcrumbs, melt the butter and do a pour over and pop in the oven for about 35 min. Turned out perfect. My MIL hates homemade mac and cheese but she couldn't get enough of this one. The sour cream takes the cheesy out of it and gives it a great twist. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was great! Very creamy! The different cheese flavors blended well to give a nice taste to the palate. I used recommendations of adding 1/2 c milk and lessening the breadcrumb amount to 1/4 c. Will definitely be making again! Thanks!

This is a super yummy and EASY recipe! I served it at a family dinner and everyone loved it. Next time, I might try a cheesy top instead of the crumb top. I made the recipe exactly as directed, and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top. Dee-lish! We'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely divine!!! Even better topped with stewed tomatoes!!  This one is definitely going in the recipe box!!  Only thing i did differently was added 1/4c. milk to the mixture before putting it in the oven.  It was far too thick without doing so.  But taste wise... the best!!!

Made this last night as a pre-Thanksgiving test. It was pretty good! In fact, I'm having leftovers for lunch. I did add about 1/2 cup of half and half per other reviews and I used garlic & herb breadcrumbs because that's all I had on hand. For Thanksgiving, I'll probably add some Velveeta and swap the breadcrumb topping for a cornflake topping for more crunch - the breadcrumbs came off as more gritty than crunchy to me.

Ive only had Mac and Cheese out of a box once when I was younger and didnt like it at all, so whenever I had the chance to try anyone else's I refused.  Now that Ive made plenty of baked dishes with meat I wanted to try this and it came out great!  The only alterations I made were adding onion and bacon, still used the full cup of bread crumbs because I like the texture and didnt add any milk as reviewers suggested as I prefer a cheesier texture.  This was perfect, will make again but double the cheddar!

I've been making something similar for years, but with the addition of fried, crumbled bacon and sauteed, diced onions. They really kick up the flavour and you'll never want it plain again!

the bread crumbs never got crunchy- they were soggy. next time i will do it the way my mom does - butter sliced bread and cut into squares. i added ham to mine, which gave it some flavor, i was surprised how bland it was. probably will not make this again.

Excellent recipe, this mac & cheese is delicious! I used reduced fat sharp cheddar, parmesan, cottage cheese and sour cream and it still tasted great so the recipe can easily be lightened up a bit.  Also, I took other reviewer's advice and added about 1/4 cup of skim milk to the mix to keep it moist and the result was perfect. Definitely a recipe I will keep coming back to.

This recipe is going to single-handedly make me fat!  It is AMAZING and so easy to make!  I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday party- he was skeptical b/c of the cottage and sour cream, but he LOVED it and so did everyone else.  The bread crumbs are amazing with it.  Made it exactly as the recipe said and it came out perfect!

Superb Mac & Cheese.  I cut back on the breadcrumbs to use a smaller casserole dish and took this to a get together.  Was a huge hit.

Quite suprised that this was not as amazing as I thought it would be.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was too dry for me.  If you like creamy, gooey mac and cheese than this is not the recipe for you.  I don't think that I will make this again and if I do I will need to make modifications to get the taste that I like.

Definately a recipe worth a try.  I too could have gone for a more cheesey taste. Like others I added milk, onions, used fiber enriched pasta and cut back on the bread crumbs.  I also used freshly shredded parmesan in the noodle mix.  My changes: I topped with a mix of canned parmesan and italian bread crumbs added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick.  And to get some veggies into this, chop up some yellow squash, saute until just soft and add right in to noodle mix, tip from Rachel Ray.

Pleasantly surprised with this!  I've been looking for a GOOD mac and cheese recipe that didn't use processed cheese, and I think I found it!  I used low salt Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and it turned out great.  I also added some milk as others said it was a tad dry, and that made it perfect I think-definitely add a little milk.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I thought I'd try it because it had so many good reviews but I found it to be too sour/salty tasting to me (most likely from the Sour Cream & Cottage Cheese ingredients) and the breadcrumb topping dried out the macaroni too much so that it wasnt as creamy as I would have liked.

it's good, but not great. definitely pros are that it's super easy to make and relatively inexpensive. i would prefer a bit more cheesy flavor though.

The mac & cheese part was very good, but the bread crumbs were too much.  I ended up scraping as many of the crumbs off that I could so the kids would eat it.  They asked me not to put the bread crumbs on it next time I make it.  Will probably just put extra cheese on top like some other reviewers suggested.

Very very good. I think I will skip the bread crumb topping next time. It was a little too rich...but the actual mac 'n cheese was fantastic!

Wonderful Mac & Cheese!  My husband asked me to make homemade macaroni & cheese because he loved his mother's.  He said this was the BEST he'd ever had!  :)  I made it exactly as written but used the hollow, spiral noodles.  Doubled the recipe to have leftovers for lunch.  Served as a main dish with broccoli.  Also, I mixed it together early in the morning, refrigerated it, and popped it in the oven for dinner.  Great, easy meal!!  Thank you.

I love this recipe!  The cottage cheese and sour cream make it healthier than regular macaroni and cheese while still providing an amazingly creamy texture.  I recommend using lowfat cottage cheese, nonfat sour cream, and then regular fat cheddar and parmesan for the maximum health benefits with minimum taste compromise.  This reheats very well, if you have any left! (We usually don't.)

Delicious and very easy! I added some extra Monterrey Jack and didn't have enough cottage cheese...but it's one of those recipes that's very forgiving. I also added garlic powder, pepper and a generous splash of milk. I sprinkled the top with Panko crumbs and fresh grated Parm then just broiled for a few minutes to get it browned up a little.

My fiance ate this in two minutes.  I made it according to the recipe, and only broiled it for 5 minutes at the end to crisp up the top.  I will definitely make it again.

loved it!  Really good on the second day as well, after being microwaved.  Used nonfat sour cream and a little bit of milk, just because I like to leave it in the oven for longer and I didn't want it to dry out.

I made this for Labor Day but tweaked it a bit. Instead of cottage cheese I used ricotta and I also added some Gruyere (just because I love it). The mac and cheese was a big success. However next time I am going to add milk to make it a little creamier and maybe some crushed red pepper to give it a little kick. But all in all a great recipe!

Anything this good has to be sinful!  I made it as written and it was delish. However, it was very, very rich compared to what I'm used to so on the second time I used 1/2 the bread crumb mixture, yogurt instead of sour cream, FF cottage cheese and added a few drops of liquid cayenne. Also yummy this way.   I also let the dogs have a very tiny bit and they followed me around with love in their eyes for the rest of the day.

I've made this a few times and it's pretty good (and addictive). I like the texture from the cottage cheese (similar to scrambled egg) but it adds a tangy flavor which is offset by the crumb topping (I used Ritz without melted butter).  Definitely add the extra milk (it will look soupy before baking).

The flavor of this was outstanding.  I used my immersion blender to mix all the cheeses and then folded that into the macaroni.  This comes the closest to the taste of the wonderful "school mac and cheese" we love.  I saved a little grated cheese and sprinkled that on the top and then added the cracker crumbs.  I used only 1/2 cup of crushed cracker crumbs mixed with only 2 tablespoons of butter and that was plenty.    While super tasty, we found this a little dry.  Next time I'll add 1/2 cup of milk to the cheese mixture.    This is the best tasting mac and cheese I've ever made.  Thanks.

whoa, be careful! this stuff rocks. there is a seriously high sauce to pasta ratio. i don't think i have ever put that much cheese in any one dish. i think next time i will use regular cheddar instead of sharp. i think that would make it more kid friendly. however, i must say that this was the first homemade mac and cheese that my son actually liked. he usually prefers the boxed stuff! i had to quickly put the leftovers away after dinner. i could not stop picking at it and i was going to make my self ill. this will rock the house at the next potluck i go to.

Just OK in my book. Decent flavor, but I like mac and cheese to be pretty creamy and this bordered on dry.

This was edible but nothing i would make again. This got alot of rave reviews but after reading closely,alot of the rave reviewers made lots of changes to recipe. I followed recipe (which i always do when making for 1st time) and found that it was not at all creamy, or cheesy enough. I also didnt enjoy the clumpy cottage cheese either. The best part was the panko/butter topping. Will not make again.

Yummy! I never tasted a better mac & cheese meal than this one. I made it yesterday and it was simply delicious. I usually don't ever go near mac and cheese but this was a great recipe. Per many suggestions, I added a bit over 1/2 C of milk and a tons more cheese on top! I also added around 1 C of sauteed onions to the mixture. I was a bit skeptical about eating cottage cheese but it really made the dish. I loved the little chewy bits of it. I didn't get a chance to put the breadcrumbs but I will definitely try it again with some panko. Thanks, Chuck!

Perfect when made with whole grain pasta and some low fat ingredients (but never substitute for real butter).  In summer,  if you don't want to use the oven,  use a Crockpot  or slow cooker to 'bake' it.  Then sprinkle on the bread crumb mixture as you serve.  Great with green beans.

I come from a long line of mac & cheese lovers and I will have to say this is a really great dish. I took this to a boy scout dinner and it was gone in a flash. The only thing that I changed is I added a little more milk otherwise I do think it could have been a little dry.

The weather here cooled way down-went from 95 to 55 in one day-so I decided to get away from the BBQ and try this mac & cheese casserole. Great combination of flavors! Make sure to pay attention to the quantities in the receipe- 8oz of pasta not 12 oz and you will come out allright. Also add a can of evaporated milk & a teaspoon of dry mustard powder. Top with panko crumbs mixed with a 1/4 cup parmesan. Make sure to use good quality local cheeses and don't worry about the fat. Savor the moment!

This was dry even after I added a little milk as was suggested by others.  Just didn't care for it.  I'm surprised by all the high ratings.  I guess some people have never had really good mac & cheese.

I used a smaller casserole dish (8X9). I also used 1/4 cup parmesan WITH 1/2 cup bread crumbs to sprinkle them on top! I loved it and will make it again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I don't like home made macaroni and cheese, but I thought this was pretty good. Two people said it was by far the best they'd ever had, two people hated it because of the cottage cheese. I guess it's a touch and go recipe, you can't please everyone!

I tried this recipe out last night for my husband and twin brother...both are rather picky.  I took the advice of others and added 1 cup of milk to the recipe and used far less bread crumbs.  I did, however, use olive oil instead of butter as suggested with a small layer of cheddar cheese.  To add some other flavors, I changed up the cheese mixture.  I added cheddar, provolone/mozz, a small amount of shredded parm, and small cubes of munster since I couldn't located my grater.  Turned out great!  Moist, creamy, and reheated well the next day.  I think this would work well with low fat cottage cheese/sour cream as well.  Will try for the party!

Awesome recipe! Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it...especially my little granddaughter who is a finicky eater. Didn't add the butter or bread crumbs...didn't need to. This recipe is excellent!!

This is an excellent mac n cheese!  I hesitated making it for a baseball party b/c some commented about it being bland, so I mixed w/ half boxed mac-n-cheese and then followed the recipe exactly.  It was FANTASTIC!  One woman at the gathering came back THREE times for more:)

This is delicious. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is a bit dry if you don't add the milk, as suggested by other reviewers.  I made a double batch for a party and it disappeared before I even got back to my kitchen. A definite keeper. 

UPDATE 3/29/14: I'm still making this and everyone who tries it loves it and wants the recipe. I've used both low fat and full fat cheese and cottage cheese, and it's great either way.

I've also added spinach and baked it in muffin tins for play date food for toddlers and this was a real winner--pre-portioned, greens but still yummy. Very good. You can prepare this ahead of time, keep it in the fridge, and pop it in the oven when you need it, just add some cooking time if you take it straight from fridge to oven.

I do not like Mac & Cheese, but my family does.  I added milk as other suggested and used cojack cheese on top instead of bread crumbs.  My daughter said my mac & cheese was "better than grandmas"  That is a huge compliment! Thank you for sharing.

The macaroni is extremely delicious, but I added one and a half cup milk so it was cheesier and didn't dry out for leftovers. Don't be turned away by sour cream/cottage cheese... it's delicious!

I wanted to make a few changes to the final product but the guests I feed have spoken. A+ and a new fav of everyone. I did add a layer of Mozzarella cheese to the top before the bread crumbs. All 26 guests loved it and devoured 2 full 9x13 trays.  I won’t add anything but next time I am going to try processing the small curd cottage cheese to an even smaller size for a better visual appearance.

WOW!  I know so many people have already reviewed this recipe, but my family told me that I needed to do it, too.    We have 6 children, so sometimes it can be difficult to find foods that everyone likes ... except pizza, and who can eat that every night of the week?  I decided to try this recipe last night, even though one of my daughters is a die hard mac 'n cheese hater, and it was completely gone in less than 15 minutes.  (The die hard mac 'n cheese eater had 2 servings).  Everyone was upset that there was none left & begged me to please make 2 pans of it next time!  This recipe has so many great things going for it:  It is a breeze to make, it is relatively inexpensive, and everybody thought it was worthy of 5 stars.  This was also the first mac and cheese recipe that I ever tried which used shredded cheese instead of Velveeta & yet was not stringy.  I'm sure that we will be making this again & again.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

FABULOUS!!! Very forgiving! I used the odds and ends of various cheeses including cheddar, jack and Romano. I saved some calories by eliminating the bread crumbs. I saved some time by just cooking the mac on the stove. Turned out great!

I've made this twice now and my kids ate it after the few changes I made. The major one was to put all the sauce ingredients into the blender with a little bit of milk so there weren't any cottage cheese "chunks". I also used some crushed caeser croutons for the topping instead of plain bread. The last thing I'd recommend if making this for kids is to use half sharp cheddar and half american for a milder flavor.

4 stars because the recipe is very high in fat.  I used ff sour cream and ff cottage cheese, along with 2% cheddar.  Still very good, and a lot healthier.

My family loves this!  I have made this at least 5 times now and stick exactly to the recipe.  Sometimes I throw in leftover ham and/or peas if I have it.  I use low or no-fat cottage cheese & sour cream, but a sharp cheddar for flavor.  We are not fans of cottage cheese, but you can't taste it or detect the texture.  This is not like a box of creamy sauced mac & cheese, but a more traditional baked version.  Took some to my neighbor too and her husband wouldn't eat it upon hearing the ingredient list, but finally relented and enjoyed it as well!

This is the only Mac n Cheese my family will eat. I have tried others. Everyone frowned at the sour cream and cottage cheese.  The taste is exactly what we were looking for. My family loves this recipe.  I won't cook any other Mac and Cheese but this one. Thanks a million.

This recipe freezes very well for an easy dinner. Make the recipe as directed up until the point where you put the mixed up mac and cheese in the casserole dish. Put it in a big plastic freezer bag and toss it in the freezer. Pull it out before work in the morning, let it thaw in the fridge all day and at dinner time just transfer it to a baking dish, add the breadcrumbs and bake. I froze several batches this way when I was 9 months pregnant last year and it saved us!

Oh My! Oh My! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made this on New Years Day. My family LOVED it. It was different from the usual Mac & Cheese that they have all the time. The bread crumbs on top really gave this recipe a HOLLER!!!
I did what another reviewer suggested and added milk to it to prevent dryness the next day. Well, it turned out that I didn't have any leftover BUT tasted just as GOOD. My nephew who is a big guy in his 30's says my Mac & Cheese was so good it makes you wanna SLAP somebody! LOL!!!! I just had to show everyone where I got the recipe. I emailed the recipe to family members who are not close by. 
So now when someone sees Mac & Cheese at the table.....the ask if it's CHUCK's!!!!

I didn't care for it but my husband and kids loved it! So I gave it 5 stars.  I did blend the cottage cheese with 1/2 cup half n half so it was smoother. I will add ham next time, maybe I will like it better.

I made this for Christmas 2008 dinner and it was a huge hit.  Overall it was very simple to make and I omitted the salt and pepper, the flavor is excellent.  People were begging to take the leftovers home. 

I did double the recipe and used Monterey Jack in place of the additional cheddar, I also used crushed Ritz crackers in place of the breadcrumbs.

I doubled this for Christmas. I added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk to the cheese mixture. Got rave reviews and will be making again and again. I really does taste like cafeteria mac and cheese. (A fond childhood memory).

It's great tastes just like my Grandma used to make. It brought bake some of those great childhood memories. 
I read the reviews and put in 1/2 a cup of heavy cream so that it would not be dry the next day. It came out great and was even better the second day!

Very tasty. I made it last night and I added 1/2 cup fat-free milk, 1/2 cup of minced onions, 3 garlic gloves and 2 tablespoons of Dijon Mustard. Yum.

This was good but certaintly not the best like everyone raves...it is not creamy at all and the curd from the cottage cheese does not melt.  So, if you aren't happy with the way cottage cheese looks, don't make it.  It was definately drier than more traditional recipes.  Taste - good but dry.

Good template for expanding.  I felt the recipe itself was a bit bland.  The second time I made it, I added shredded chicken, broccoli, and green chiles.    On the third try, I took one reviewer's advice and added a can of tomato soup.  WOW!!!  This recipe is now a five-star recipe.

Great recipe!  I added a 1/2C of milk as someone else had suggested and served this with ham and asparagus.  My kids would have been happier with Kraft mac n cheese, but my husband and I loved it!

I doubled the recipe because I took it to my mom's for Thanksgiving.  I used a 9x13 and an 8x8, spraying Pam on each so the dishes wouldn't be too hard to clean.  I used ziti pasta and also added about 1/2 c. milk, a little garlic powder, extra parmesan cheese, and a few tablespoons of light butter, hoping this would make the recipe creamier.  I lightly sprinkled breadcrumbs on top  of both dishes.  They were ready after about 35 minutes and I took a bite as soon as i took them out of the oven.  It tasted great.  However, by the time we ate the macaroni was dry as a bone!  I had lids on them so they were still very warm, but it wasn't creamy at all!  Unfortunately, only half of one of the dishes got eaten.  Tomorrow we are going back for leftovers so I am going to try pouring more milk on top and popping it in the oven again.  So as of right now, I will give 3 stars....if tomorrow goes any better, I will change it!

A deliciously simple recipe. I like the "throw a bunch of things together and bake" dishes. I was a bit apprehensive about the cottage cheese and sour cream because I am a bechamel cheese sauce kinda gal, but I thought "5 stars and 500-ish reviewers can't be wrong." The only thing that I did differently was I added half an onion finely chopped. I like a oniony tang to my m&c, but that's just personal preference. Whenever I'm not feel up to making a roux, this is the recipe that I will use.

Excellent!  I couldn't get my 4 yr old twins to eat mac 'n cheese until I tried this recipe.  I did alter a bit.  I added 1/2 cup of skim milk, a little bit more cheddar and I chopped up 3 small tomatoes to break up the richness.  Very good!

I used low fat cottage cheese, sour cream, and parmesean cheese and added about 1 tsp of ground mustard powder. I also used dried stuffing mix, crushed, in place of bread crumbs for the topping for extra flavor. The whole family loved this!

Very very tasty! This was exactly waht we were looking for in a mac and cheese! I made the following changes, sauteed half of an onion in butter and garlic, added it to cheese mixture. Used a food processor to puree the cottage cheese. Added a 1/2 cup milk, used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and less butter. Mixed all the ingredients together on the stove before putting in oven. Added some hot sauce and red pepper flakes to the mixture. Added some chopped cooked bacon on top of the breadcrumbs. YUMMMMM!

I had to try this, after seeing the list of ingredients!  It was amazing.  My toddler and my husband usually just pick at macaroni and cheese (even other from-scratch recipes I've tried) -- but they BOTH loved this one.  Before baking, I sprinkled with a mixture of melted butter and Panko bread crumbs -- delicious!

I doubled the recipe right from the start and boy am I glad I did! Thumbs up from the kids and husband, they asked when we can have it again! To me that makes any recipe a winner. I did add some pepper flakes to it and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, which was good but I doubt I would do that again, no need for 'extra flavor' for the dish. Try it, you'll like it if not love it!

I've made this 3 or 4 times now and have had excellent reviews with it. My brother in law says I'm the master of macroni and cheese. I do add milk and extra cheese, the last time I made this I also added crumbled bacon on top and several people that tasted it said it was the best they ever had. Thanks for the recipe.

This was the best.  It even got a "wow Mama, this is better than the box," from my 8 y/o.  It is so easy to make and taste so wonderfully cheesy and creamy.  I did add 1/2 cup of milk as others had suggested.  Also, I was out of bread crumbs, so I used crushed cheez-its, which gave it even more of a cheesy kick.  However, next time I make this (and I've already had requests 2 days after), I will just top with extra shredded cheese and broil a couple of minutes at the end, as I prefer that to a crumb topping.

This was just OK. I think next time I will melt the cheeses together to make a cheese sauce before mixing it with the noodles. Needs to be a smoother consistency.

Although the mac and cheese tasted good right out of the oven, within minutes it developed a sort of mealy texture -- kind of gluey and clumpy -- even though I had added milk like the other reviewers suggested.  It was not at all the creamy mac and cheese I was looking for.  I ended up throwing out the rest of the batch, and I won't make this recipe again.

This recipe was great!  I took the suggestions of others and added the milk.  Otherwise, I kept it as is and it was a hit with my husband and 2 year old.  It is also SO easy.  I grated all the cheese yesterday and the rest was as easy as boiling the water!

Kid Favorite! I substituted approx. a 1/2 sleeve of crumbled ritz crackers for the bread crumbs.  I just smashed them in a plastic bag and mixed with the melted butter. Also used fat free sour cream.  I think this is a great take along dish for parties and such.

Very hearty, great tasting mac and cheese.  I use the Mexican blend cheese, I tried sharp cheddar the first time and found it too potent. I don't use butter and use Fat Free Sour Cream, normal small curd cottage cheese.  I use 1/4 tsp Kosher salt, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper and 1/4 tsp paprika for more taste.  I add ham (the thick kind and I cube it) and 1/2 cup of frozen peas.  I also add 1/2 cup milk to make it more moist.  Comes out perfectly delicious!

DH LOVED IT. Added appx 1/4 cup green onions and instead of the bread crumb / butter mixture I crushed up some pre-packaged herb flavored croutons. Gave it more zip!  I never want to make the boxed stuff again!

I was wary of the cottage cheese. This has an over-all light home-baked mac N cheese taste. I found it needed a little salt to fight the blandness, but it could have been that I used whole wheat spiral pasta. update: it's better using ricotta in place of the cottage cheese, but I've also found other recipes with a more intense cheese flavor that I liked even better.

This was really good.  I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream.  I added the 1/2 cup milk, plus 2 pieces of bacon, a cup of frozen peas, and a teaspoon of mustard.

I added 1/2 cup milk, crushed Ritz crackers on top, and omited the butter. Turned out perfectly - tasted great and was nice and CREAMY, not dry and strigy as others described. 

I don't know why others are having such a problem with it turing out dry (I am assuming they are using an entire 16 oz. box of pasta rather than half.)

Next time I'll be adding onions and bacon to give it some more texture.

Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed Cheese It's (parmesan and garlic flavor) to the top and put the butter over it, as indicated.  I also added 1/2 cup of milk, next time I will increase the milk.  However, this recipe is INCREDIBLE!  Added to favorites!

So delicious!  This whole thing was eaten in one night by just three people!  

I added a cup of milk like others suggested and I also added more cheddar cheese inside of the casserole.  

I also significantly decreased (less than half of what it called for) the bread crumb mixture like others suggested, but I wish I would have only decreased it a little bit.  I actually liked the bread crumb topping!  

When I uncovered it and sprinkled the Parmesan cheese on it for the last 15 minutes, I also sprinkled more cheddar cheese on top which REALLY helped out the dish!  Yum yum yum!  

I will definitely be making this again!

This is an awesome recipe and so easy.  My husband loved it too.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs for the topping, but didn't make any other changes.  Don't know why other reviewers thought it was bland.  It had tons of flavor.  No more boxed Mac & Cheese for us!!!  Thanks Chuck!

This is different. I didn't mind the cottage cheese being in it but it doesn't look very appetizing. I made 16 oz. of pasta, added a bunch more cheese, 2 green onions and 2 tsp minced garlic. Then we liked it!

This recipe is great..I did add milk to it to make it a little creamier. I also combined a couple different cheeses to it (Sharp cheddar, swiss, colby) I added a layer of cheese on top before I put the bread crumbs on it and it worked great! I also used wheat pasta, ff sour cream and ff cot. cheese and put some scallions in it :)I would definetly make this meal again..next time I would like to try it with chicken and broc. :)

Not bad... but it lacked the gooey cheesy consistency that I was expecting. Perhaps it was because I followed the advice of another reviewer and added about 1/4  cup of milk? Or maybe it was because the no fat cottage cheese I used seemed more runny than curdy. In any case, I'll likely try this again, omit the milk and maybe use dry curd cottage cheese instead?

Great recipe! I added more noodles and about 4 oz of velveeta.  I also skipped the breadcrumbs.  Very good overall flavor.

This is my first time writing a review, but this is seriously the best baked mac & cheese recipe I have ever tried. Don't be alarmed by the cottage cheese - my fiance hates it, but loved this dish. As other reviewers have said, you definitely have to reduce the amount of breadcrumbs at least by half. Also, I used fat free everything and it still turned out just as good.

This recipe for mac and cheese is the best that I have ever had.  I don't usually even like mac and cheese! But this was exceptional!  I did use italian bread crumbs instead of plain and also used alittle more cheddar cheese, 3 cups,(I'm a cheese lover), and it was fabulous! Thanks alot!

TOTALLY AMAZING!! We loved it. While the macaroni was cooking I went ahead and mixed everything else ahead of time. I added some seasonings, like garlic,parsley,italian seasoning and some goya ones. Then I added alittle milk and butter and it made it really creamy before I added the noodles. For the topping I used the garlic and herb bread crumbs mixed with the butter. I made it for a potluck at my sons school. Im sure its going to be a hit for them too. This one is going in my recipe book :-)
Thanks

Excellent dish, and very easy.  I suspect I will be serving this weekly.  Great as is, but also very tweakable.  Add ham for a more robust meal.  Use light sour cream and lowfat cottage cheese to lower calories.  Use Italian style breadcrumbs for a different flavor... etc, etc.

This is delicious and so easy to make! Made a few changes to lower the calories - used 8 oz. lowfat cottage cheese, light sour cream, and only used 1/2 the bread crumbs & butter for the topping. I also used whole wheat rotelle pasta. This tastes almost exactly like my family's favorite mac-n-cheese recipe but is much easier to make - thanks!

Super easy, but agree it was a bit dry.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, and would cut back on the topping a bit.  But served it for a girls-nite and we all loved it .. a real "homie" meal!!  Will definately make regularly.

This was great!  I admit when I saw the ingredients of sour cream and cottage cheese I was very sceptical.  It was GREAT!!  It was so quick and easy to make and it was delicious!  The only thing I would suggest is to use a little less bread crumbs.  Other than that it's awesome!

I really liked this, I did, BUT it was definitly lacking something...I'm just not sure what. I know I didn't put enough salt in, but I'm pretty sure it could have used a little something else. It wasn't as good as it could have been...certainly worth making though!

This was good but two things I would change.  The topping (while tasty) was too much.  Lessen the amount and you will be set.  Also, if you did reheat it, the topping loses its crunch.  The second thing, is that this recipe wasn't creamy at all.  Not that it needed to be, but I may try adding a little bit of milk next time.

Rich and creamy.  The way mac and cheese should taste.  My children loved it and it made a large enough batch for lunch the following day.

Excellent.  I used 1/2 the breadcrumbs and almost 16oz of the pasta.  So delicious!

We didn't care for this.  The cheese was very thick and congealed.  It wasn't creamy at all.  Also, the sour cream adds a tang that doesn't seem to belong in good ol' mac and cheese.  I'll keep looking for the perfect creamy, cheesy recipe.  Thanks, anyway.

This recipe was awesome! My 16.5 month old son and my husband also loved it. I did add about 1/3 cup of milk because I didn't have enough cottage cheese and it turned out great. This is a keeper!

I thought this was so easy to make and tasted great!  The only change I made was to add some milk because I was worried about it drying out.  I haven't tried the leftovers yet, but my boyfriend said they were good too.  Thanks Carla!

I love veggies so I added about two cups of mixed veggies(broccoli,caul,carrots), and also added another 8 oz of mozz. cheese. Next time I'll do the same but cut the bread crumbs in half.  Thanks

This is some of the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had, and I consider myself one of the great mac-n-cheez critics of all time. :)  I made this for a family cookout, and it went over great.  Even my husband and mother-in-law, who don't usually like macaroni and cheese, devoured it.

I discovered this recipe while trying to find something to do with some almost out of date cottage cheese.  I feel like I won the recipe lottery.  It is so good.  I have never bothered with the bread crumbs or butter.  I also substituted medium Cheddar cheese.  I usually add some onion powder too for a little additional flavor kick.  I have made this multiple times and usually just put in whatever type of cheeses I have on hand (in addition to the cheddar.)  I loved it with Provolone added with the cheddar too.  This recipe always seems to work out and everyone has been asking for the recipe.  Chuck this recipe is a keeper.

I have never seen my family go crazy over mac and cheese like this before.  This is by far the best recipe for mac and cheese I have ever tried!  I would give it 10 stars if I could! The only thing I did differently was omit the cottage cheese(didn't have any on hand) and added some half and half which made it very creamy!  Highly recommended!

I was looking for a recipe to use with reduced carb pasta that didn't use flour. OMG I tried the right one! I did add 1/2 c. cream. Also because I like a bit of a "bite" I added about a 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 tsp red,(cayenne) pepper, and a bit of paprika. It came out so creamy and rich. I've made alot of mac'n cheese through the years. This was the easiest, and the best.

Very tasty!  I made it with low fat cottage cheese and sour cream, and didn't need to add extra milk--there was already enough liquid.  I also halved the breadcrumbs.

I followed the recipe, and it turned out just how it should. If you enjoy a strong tasting mac and cheese then this is the recipe for you, however if you are into a more subtle taste I would reccomend just sticking with the traditional style.

Not bad. But still lacking something that I can't place my finger on. But the sour cream and cottage cheese is a nice touch...definately adds a little something to the traditional mac and cheese.

This is fabulous. Nice subtle flavour and super quick and easy to make. I used whole wheat noodles, and used more than 8 oz. Also used low fat cottage cheese, and fat free sour cream. I added more cheese than asked for (I like it cheesy), and added a tbsp of mustard - Mom's secret ingredient. Now when I crave KD, I will make this instead. For the topping Iused crushed up crackers and it was great. Had 2 bowls for dinner and can't wait for my leftovers for lunch.

Mmmmm!  Good recipe!  I used pasta shells and added some chopped broccoli for a little nutritional value :)  I totally forgot the butter and the parmesan and it still came out great!  I did not even miss 'em.  I will definitely make this again--quick, easy and delicious!  Thanks.

This was not your normal creamy mac 'n cheese but boy was this delicious! The whole family loved it and it's even better the next day. I doubled this recipe and it makes a ton. The only thing I wouldn't double is the bread crumb topping next time because it was way too much.

This recipe was great!  I normally only like creamy mac-n-cheese, but this was fantastic AS WRITTEN!!  I've never had anything like this before.  It had a great taste and great texture!  This is a wonderful change from normal mac-n-cheese!  If you have leftovers, you may need to add a little milk when you reheat it.

Delicious! I used freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, sharp cheddar, Monterrey Jack cheese, and Gouda. I added some chopped jalapeno peppers and Cajun seasoning because that's what I do. I was skeptical about the cottage cheese because I really don't like cottage cheese, but it was a great addition to this recipe. The recipe was easy since a roux didn't need to be made, so it didn't taste like the macaroni and cheese I'm used to. It was still delicious. I will be using this recipe on the regular.

I would give it TEN stars if I could!!!! I am sitting here, as I review this most precious gastric gift, eating my THIRD helping....all the ingredients meld to make the consummate comfort food, and I have to admit: at first I wasn't sure about how I'd feel with regard to the sour cream (though I adore it in most instances)...well, I am happy to report that it was essential in producing the perfect "zing". I did add one cup of milk, and I even had to reconstitute it today for my "next-day assessment"...and that is a-ok with this girl. One other addition that is a default measure with me: Italian bread crumbs....sends this already fabulous dish to the stratosphere......I am truly on a HAPPY PATH!

I made it and it didn't last long. It was delicious.. but I also made it with ricotta cheese recently because my daughter inlaw doesn't like cottage cheese.. and it was almost the same taste..i think I may use ricotta all the time.

This was an amazing recipe! I had to make some modifications to be gluten free using gluten free noodles and potato chips for the topping instead of the bread crumbs. To make it a one dish meal I added slices of smoked sausage and we devoured it. Will absolutely do this again!!

First thanksgiving together so you gotta impress the future in laws, right?Thinking there would be a large crowd clammering for mac and cheese, I quadrupled the recipe. Needless to say I have several tupperware in my freezer of homemade cheesiness, which we are ecstatic about. The feedback of this dish were astonished looks of delight and seconds, sometimes thirds be had by many. I did crush a couple fresh cloves of garlic on the noodles and mix before the all the wonderful cheese jumped in. Also I added about a 3/4 cup of half and half as suggested to increase the liquid. Some other slight changes, adding some white cheddar to the mix, which I personally believe was the clincher and throwing panko crumbs in with regular breadcrumbs.

I've made this recipe multiple times and it is WONDERFUL. Every time I make it for a potluck, it's the first dish gone and numerous people ask for the recipe. 

I use Cougar Gold sharp white cheddar cheese and use half panko and half cornflake crumbs for the topping. Delish!

I have made this many times and it is such a great go to recipe! Adding stuff to it as well is easy and great for that left over ham, sausage, tomatoes, asparagus, or anything that you need to use up when making this recipe. I usually make a double batch when I make this mac and cheese. I use the breadcrumbs sometimes, but found that I like the French's French Fried Onions or comparable best. If I bring it to a potluck however, adding a cup of whole milk keeps it from getting dried out on a plate warmer. But a single batch with a family of four, with growing teenagers you do not have to worry about it hanging around or being reheated for leftovers, LOL! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I've made this several times for work potlucks as well as family get togethers and it's always a hit. Like others, I would recommend to purée/pulse the cottage cheese to give it a creamy consistentcy. I also use half of the recommended amount for the bread crumbs. I definitely recommend this mac & cheese!

Love this recipe!!!! Make it all the time. I use Traditional Panko bread crumbs instead of regular and like it much better. I sometimes use a little more butter on top and have used mozzarella or other cheeses instead of sharp cheddar such as a Mexican mixture to give it a kick. You can really do a lot with this recipe and it still tastes great. Always a big hit!!!

This was quick and easy but pretty bland for my taste. I like the idea of mixing in the cottage cheese though, instead of making a roux-based cheese sauce. I will play with some spices or maybe double the cheeses?

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I am giving four stars only because I altered the recipe and put cubed ham and peas in it for some flavor variance. If you are a fan of mac and cheese then I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe was just fine. My husband enjoyed it but I found it to be far from special. Ended up tasting like sour cream and cottage cheese -  nothing special.

My 2yr old and 4yr old loved this. I tried to stick as close to the recipe as possible. I did have to make a few changes I used gluten free pasta, plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added some diced mushrooms that needed to be used up. Found it very creamy and delicious

Love this mac n cheese.
I swap 4oz of sour cream for Campbell's cheddar cheese sauce. I also add some peas and cubed ham, also easy on the bread crumbs. Turns out great.

After trying countless Mac and Cheese recipes, my two very picky children approved of this dish (without the bread crumb topping).  I would have given 5 stars, except it was a bit too salty and fatty for my taste, even though I omitted the salt from the recipe. Next time, I will again omit the salt AND use low sodium and low fat sour cream and cheeses. I would love to make it a little bit healthier somehow.

So, there are some people who like their mac and cheese a bit dryer, and some that prefer velvety mac and cheese. This one's on the dryer end, which I personally like. HOWEVER, I've modified this to incorporate some added creaminess by making a roux, adding cheese to it, pepper, paprika and shaved garlic. I add the cheese mixture to some added cheddar, sour cream and cottage cheese. This mac and cheese is perfect. I really enjoy the little pieces of cottage cheese throughout.

I have not met anyone that doesn't like this mac and cheese recipe. I've doubled it, tripled it, even put a pan in the freezer for my boyfriend before I went out of town. Sometimes, I like to use smoked gouda instead of sharp cheddar and sprinkle a little cayenne in as well. I also always use panko breadcrumbs for the ultimate crispy topping.

Dry, so so dry.  Not at all what we expected.  It needs WAY more cheese. I followed the directions to a T and then added a small amount of half & half based on several reviews stating that it because dry the next day for leftovers and was still dry.  Very disappointed.

Wife and I made this recipe and I must say it came out excellent!  Very tasty!  Had to cook it a little bit longer but came out great.  Took out the Parmesan but added mozzarella instead and did it chunks not shredded.  Fabulous!!

This is my favorite Mac and cheese dish! I substitute the elbow Mac for the small shells macaroni instead.  I pour a little half n half in for a little extra creaminess.  My friends rave for this dish!

I used low-fat everything (cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese) and added 1/2 cup a milk as another user suggested and it was amazing! First word out of my mouth after tasting it was, "wow." Some of the best mac n' cheese I've ever had. Reminded me of the mac n' cheese they have at Pitfire Pizza...my fave.

Served this at a campground potluck where I did not know anyone and got many compliments .. Mostly from men!  My tweeks were (from other reviews) .. I puréed the cottage cheese... Had extra sour cream so just dumped it in but also added some milk for creaminess (careful how much.  The heartiness of this receipe is part of the attraction!). Also grilled up a ham steak and added.  Used shells.   Yumm!

This recipe is fantastic-- don't be put off by the fact it looks different from many recipes when you'r mixing it.  It turns out amazing! I just followed the exact recipe.

First ill start that this was my first time making mac and cheese that wasnt in the blue box and im a begginer cook. I followed the recipe 98%. I add a lil milk because it looked a litle dry and i added extra sharp cheese because we LOVE cheese. It came out ok, i think its just not the mac and cheese im use to. I would use less cottage cheese. It taste very creamy,  not cheesy at all:-)

extremely good, down-home dish.  The only thing that didn't garner it 5 stars for me was the topping.  Waaaay too many bread crumbs and may have made the macaroni seem more dry.  Next time I make it, cos it does deserve to be made again!, I will halve the bread crumbs and maybe keep the butter close to the same - just so its crumbly.

Made it for dinner. I put in some diced ham that we had last night. It was awesome. My wife gave me a surprised look. I'm not the greatest cook. But her and the kids were very happy with it. Thx.

This was great! I did change a few things. I did not add parmesan cheese or the bread crumbs. It's very rich, so It could be a meal within itself.

Delicious and quick.  We have changed to low fat cheese to cut calories; it does not affect flavour.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! It was very easy to make compared to other mac and cheese recipes where you have to make the sauce separately. It turned out just as great, and in less time. I served it with a salad of baby arugula, spinach, and cherry tomatoes, with an olive oil-based dressing, topped with Spicy Glazed Pecans (also found the recipe for those on allrecipes.com). The whole family enjoyed it.

This is exactly what I was looking for in a mac and cheese.  The recipe is great as is and is also good with ricotta subbed for the cottage cheese, seasoned bread crumbs for regular, dry mustard or dijon mixed in etc.  I love the cheesiness, if you are like me you can add in extra to taste.  

Keep in mind when making a mac and cheese recipe what type of mac and cheese you are looking for.  Though the creamy, bechemel sauce based recipes are great for some I find them seriously lacking in cheesiness and texture and better suited for recipes where you don't want the cheese to come through so strongly.  If you like a really cheesy recipe however, this one is for you.

This is amazing! I was honestly a little terrified when I was mixing all of the ingredients together, but my entire family agree that this is an amazing Mac and Cheese and that's saying a lot because we feed 3 kids under the age of 6!

I'm also someone who is writing their first review after using the website for years.   I LOVED THIS RECIPE and so did my husband.  I can't believe how easy and how delicious it was.  I still can't figure out why it works, but it really does.  The only thing I added was a good squirt of dijon mustard because I've never made mac and cheese without adding some mustard.  And I've tried all kinds of mac and cheese recipes.  But this was really, really good and really easy.  Will definitely make this one again.

I never write reviews but this recipe is FANTASTIC !!! Very easy and super good. If your leftovers are still a tad on the dry side despite the addition of the 1/2 cup milk you can use a small knife to poke holes on the top and pour a little milk in. Cover with a damp paper towel, microwave and they're good as if you'd just pulled them out of the oven !

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I only gave four stars because it was a little to rich for my taste and I didn't like bread crumbs or as much bread crumbs as the recipe calls for.  If make it again after I figure out how to lighten it up.

I made this according to the recipe with a couple tweaks--I threw in a can of cheddar cheese soup and used Panko on top (sans butter). I doubled it for a neighborhood party and people were scraping the pan. After trying quite a few mac and cheese recipes, finding this one has ended the search for a keeper.

I was really iffy about this at first because I didn't know how well cottage cheese would taste in a mac and cheese, but it was so good!  The only complaint I have is that there were too many breadcrumbs for my liking, so I might take them out next time I try making this.  Really delicious though!

I love this version! I've made both straight and with modifications, and this now the only mac-and-cheese version I use. The cottage cheese is a great substitute for eggs (which I hate in my mac 'n' cheese) and I was never a fan of wholly creamy versions. This gives me crunch and body without dousing the poor pasta in God-awful, Velveeta-style sauce. Such a great recipe!

Has a more "tart" cheese flavor than, say, Velveeta and cheddar.   Unique but delicious.  And my name is Chuck so it really is MY favorite mac 'n cheese!

I mixed the cheeses & sour cream in a glass bowl, microwaved in stages to warm, then beat with a mixer to blend them together.  Then nuked and beat in stages until mixture was almost smooth and very warm but not hot.  I folded in the cooked macaroni with the cheese mixture in the glass bowl first, then poured into a round casserole dish.  Warming the cheeses helped with baking since the mixture was thicker than in a 9x13.  Also, you can ease up on the quantity of bread crumbs if you do this, as there is less area to cover than on a 9x13 dish.

My whole family loved this recipe! it's our new go to mac'n'cheese. I added a 1/2 cup to all the other ingredients to make the leftovers a little moister, and some smoked summer sausage to give something other than cheese to the palette. 5 stars for sure!

Best mac and cheese on the planet! I add a few slices of crumbled bacon and about 1 small onion, and a little garlic too. I also recommend using about half the amount of breadcrumbs. Love, love, love it!

Delicious!! My mom's mac and cheese is usually my favourite...or I should say, WAS my favourite! It was super easy to make and I will definitely be making this again. I read what other reviewers suggested and I added a little bit of milk. And since I'm a lover of cheese, I added more of that as well. A little more cheese doesn't hurt! It was amazing!

I have been making mac n cheese for 25 years and this is the best and easiest recipe with amazing flavor!  Wish I had it years ago. No roux- no butter, flour, cream sauce to cook before you bake...and so good.

I used panko for the topping and omitted the butter which didn't take away from the taste at all. I also turned the oven to 425 for the last few minutes to brown the panko. Yum!

I made this recipe exactly as the instructions say and it was delicious! Last night I made it and I accidentally poured in double the amount of sour cream. I decided to shred another 8 ounces of cheese. So, I had sharp cheddar and extra sharp white cheddar, double the amount of sour cream, and the correct amount of everything else. It was amazing! Everyone who tries it loves it!

This is incredibly easy and delicious.  I didn't think their was a better recipe than my mother's mac and cheese.  My guests gave many positive comments whenever I fix this recipe.

First time I made this it turned out a little dry (but still good). Second time around I added milk and more cheese and it turned out amazing! Also cut down on the amount of breadcrumbs.

Not the best. To me it had more of a sour cream taste. I will try again by adding more cheese. 
That said, this is the best web site Ever.

This is the first review I have written for a recipe I have tried and I decided to do so because it is the only recipe I have repeatedly made that is not something from my grandma or my mother.  Yes it is simple and traditional, but I appreciate it for that.  You could easily take the portions of this recipes to use different cheeses, add a twist such as bacon or tomato, and a different spice depending on what cheese you decide to use.  Very good beginner recipe.

I really just thought it was okay. My significant other seemed to like it more, though. If I make it again, I will omit the cottage cheese, replace it with another creamy cheese, and cook it stovetop before putting in the oven to finish it off.

Delicious and easy! The only changes I made were using Cavatappi pasta instead of macaroni. And because I used the entire 16oz box of pasta, I used the whole 16oz cottage cheese, added about one half cup extra cheese, and one cup of milk (based on others' recommendation to add milk to avoid dryness). And I used Panko bread crumbs, but will probably use less next time we make it.

I was so disappointed!! After reading the Most Helpful reviews, I was salivating at the thought of how amazing this would be. I should have paid attention to the 1 Star reviews!! It was bland, and boring, and no one in my family liked it at all. They didn't even finish their servings, and filled up on salad instead. If I wanted to change this recipe enough to make it palatable, then it would not be this recipe any more. I'm throwing out the leftovers *and* the recipe, and continuing my search for a great mac & cheese!!

I just made this for lunch, and oh boy! This was good stuff! I was extremely skeptical about using sour cream and cottage cheese (as I hate both) and the lack of a roux to make the cheese sauce, but this turned out fabulously! It really tasted just as great as my regular baked mac and cheese, except even creamier!

I did make some small changes as I wanted a healthier recipe. I used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese, and half the butter and breadcrumbs for the topping. I also blended the cottage cheese and sour cream in a food processor until perfectly smooth before mixing it with the cheese and pasta. The addition of sour cream and cottage cheese definitely increased the protein in this dish as compared to regular mac and cheese. With the minor changes one serving came in at just under 300 calories!

my family and i love this recipe. it is also an excellent if you add some bacon with sauted onion and garlic with about 1/4 cup white truffle oil. i actually add about 12oz of the sharp chedder instead of the 8oz and a full cup of the parmesean.sooooo decadent...

Made it just as it says and it was fabulous.  Easy to make, just add everything to the cooked macaroni (no white sauce to make).  It was as good or better than any other homemade mac 'n' cheese that I have had.

I am pretty sure this mac and cheese is the only reason I get invited anywhere. I add about a half cup of milk, helps left overs not dry out.

I would never make this recipe again.  I made it just as written by the original poster. I will go back to my old recipe of making a white sauce, adding the cheese and then the cooked macaroni.  So simple, so smooth.

Wonderful recipe! It's not too heavy and just fresh enough that it doesn't feel like a weight in your stomach. My fiancé refuses to eat cottage cheese and when I made this for him, he loved it! He didn't realize that there was any it! A real crowd pleaser.

This recipe was OK.  I used reduced fat versions of everything and substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (as I do for everything).  The Mac & Cheese had a nice tang, but but about half way through the meal it got overwhelming to me.  My husband enjoyed it more than I did, but thought it was really dry and needed more cheese.

Amazing!! Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese but I honestly think you can go either way for a tasty dish. I also sprinkle the top with a touch of cayenne or paprika and salt/pepper and since we love our cheese we add a little extra :) Thank you for this!!
PS if you MUST have it more creamy, add a touch of milk and about half a tub of  cheese dip (Cheez wiz, queso, etc)

It left a little to be desired as it doesn't necessarily replace my craving for restaurant mac and cheese. It wasn't exactly as creamy as I hoped for but I suppose I could making a white sauce first then adding cheese = more work and that's not what I was looking for. I added a whole head of broccoli, 1 cup milk, half the amount of sour cream, no cottage cheese cause I didn't have any on hand, half the panko (all I had), no butter... Just sprayed top w cooking oil and tossed it in a 8x8 baking dish. Oh yeah, and an egg. I would like to try it with cottage cheese next time and maybe omitting the egg will help w creaminess. Overall, very easy and recommended.

This was alright. I didnt think it was any better or worse than any other macaroni recipe I've made. It was easier than making a regular cheese sauce but I didnt find it tastier. Still good though.

I made this last night and it's absolutely a keeper! The only modifications I made were to add a quarter cup of milk (per previous reviews) so the cheeses and pasta would mix a little easier, and I used panko rather than breadcrumbs. It's rich and creamy and my boyfriend and I ate half the pan ourselves. Thanks so much for this recipe!

YUM!  I made this recipe and followed it exactly.  It turned out very good!  I agree with other reviewers, only HALF of the breadcrumbs are necessary.  Since making it the first time I have made a few changes that I prefer...I use plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream (no difference in taste, at least my husband and I can't tell), lo-fat everything, added about 1/4 cup of milk, and I ditched the breadcrumbs entirely.  I do like to sprinkle a few tbsp of panko bread crumbs on top.  I'm pregnant and can't get enough of this recipe!  I have a double batch cooking in the oven right now.  We'll see if there is any left over for hubby and the kids. ;)

I was worried about the cottage cheese...a healthier option but my kids frown upon it, so I used half the amount in the recipe.  Also, I eliminated the bread crumbs and 1/4 cup butter (again my kids like their Mac and Cheese moist and creamy).  Finally, the ingredients seemed to result in a mac and cheese that's a little too dry, so I added one and a half cups of skim milk.  My son LOVED it.  My daughter said she preferred good old fashioned Kraft dinner because it had less cheese.  She didn't finish 4 tablespoons of it before giving up on the richness.  I suppose this stuff is for REAL Mac and Cheese lovers.  The adults in our house don't eat Mac and Cheese...looks like I will be giving most of this stuff away to the neighbours!

I'm really sorry to say but I thought this was really terrible. I know that mac and cheese is macaroni and cheese :) but this was like a sour cream/ cottage cheese and cheddar cheese mess. I did follow the directions exactly as it is without making any substitutions. I love cheese but somehow it's just too much overpowering cheese taste. And the seasoning leaves much to be desired.  I'm sorry.

WIN! Everyone loved this Mac and Cheese, even the kiddies. I lightly brown Panko bread crumbs  before topping it and covered with foil for the first 15 mins. I also added some milk as other suggested. When I make this again, I will probably add Velveeta or something to make it creamier.

My husband and I agreed that the taste was good, but too dry.  Wish I had read the other reviews which suggested adding some milk beforehand. I especially liked that after a big portion, I didn't feel overstuffed!

I took this to a play date and everyone raved about it, I thought it was ok. I think next time less cottage cheese (?) maybe a few more spices thrown in. Otherwise, pretty simple

This was easy and the best homemade Mac n cheese I've ever had. I'm not a huge fan but ate some more after the kids went to bed ;-) I did add 1/2 milk and the leftovers were a great consistency. Recommend to all!

This was really good. The last time I made macaroni and cheese from scratch was 5 years ago in a high school foods class. This is a different recipe from the typical roux/milk cheese sauce. I was really skeptical about this recipe but after I saw all the good reviews I knew I had to give it a try. I did know that due to my likening of spicy foods I would have to adjust the flavoring of this a bit. 

I made half of the recipe.  I sautéed some onions, 1 clove of garlic and a jalapeño pepper. I added a tsp of paprika and oregano. I added ¼ cup of milk to the mixture and set aside. I added all this and the ingredients listed in the recipe to a casserole dish and mixed well. I baked WITHOUT adding the breadcrumbs. After baking 30 minutes in the oven I topped with a light sprinkle’s of cheddar cheese and the bread crumb mixture. The only thing I would change next time was to add ½ cup of milk because even though it wasn’t super dry it wasn’t as creamy. I would recommend that you cook it until the cheese is bubbling.

Made according to the recipe, except that I added some Velveeta. It is incredibly bland. I like the idea of the cottage cheese with the pasta, so I will try again but will make major changes. I didn't want to rate this with stars, being that taste is soooo subjective but, unfortunately, I had to.  Since so many people like it, it is clearly a good recipe, it just does nothing for MY particular taste buds. :-)

I've never made homemade Mac and cheese before, but those recipe was easy & super yummy! I made it for a get-together & there wasn't any left to bring home! The kids all ate it up... I will definitely be using this recipe again. I left out the bread crumb topping (just b/c I'm not a bread crumb person) and just sprinkled shredded cheese on top instead & it was great!

Maybe two and a half stars.... I wanted to like this so much after all the good reviews. We didn't care for it. The sour cream added a "tanginess" that we didn't care for. It wasn't cheesy tasting at all. Just not our preference. Two of our three children and my husband said it was okay but it wasn't something they cared to have me make again, the third child and I thought it was too sour and didn't care for it at all.

This was seriously very bad, and I don't understand the high rating. AllRecipes doesn't usually let me down, but it did this time. A cup of bread crumbs is WAY too much. I almost thought about eliminating them, but I wanted to make sure I made this the way it was meant to be made. The texture was awful and grainy with all the topping on it. The taste...it was tangy from the sour cream. Other than that, there was no cheesiness to it. It wasn't creamy. Like I said, I made no alterations. But this was a complete failure. I will not make this again. I'd have been better off using Velveeta.

Super yummy! The bread crumbs on the top really give it a nice texture. I have taken this many times to potlucks and it is always a hit. My family gets huge smiles on their faces every time they come in the kitchen and ask "what are you making?" I stick the original recipe with no changes.

This recipe is fantastic. I agree with suggestions to add a little milk. It helps, especially when reheating. This recipe is good by itself, but we sometimes add to it to make it more of a complete meal. We add steamed broccoli and chicken. A dash of Tabasco tops it off perfectly.

Delicious!  I followed advice of other reviewers and added a little milk.  I also completely ommited the crumbs/butter on top and added extra cheddar cheese on top.  It was great with addition of ham and peas.  So easy!

I LOVE this recipe.  It's so quick and easy and my whole family loves it!  I add Johnny's Garlic seasoning but other than that I stick to the recipe.  Perfect side dish.  I usually omit the bread crumbs as my kids aren't big fans.  The cottage cheese adds more protein to the meal and makes for a great texture in the dish.

My only complaint is the amount of calories in this dish (+500) which is absolutely crazy for someone limited to 1200 calories a day. BUT, I make this dish as a treat for accomplishing something and it's absolutely wonderful. I like adding peas to the dish to make it a tad healthier, plus the contrast in colors is quite nice. Again, very delicious dish but I wish it didn't count for half my daily calorie intake.

My kids loved this, but my husband found it a bit dry. I added 1/3 cup of milk, I think next time I'd up it to at 1/2 cup. I also cut down on the bread crumbs a bit. Simple and hearty.

I seriously don't know how this recipe got such a high rating. I followed this recipe as written and was so dissappointed. It was dry and the flavor was lacking....will never make again. Surely there are other recipes that will be creamier and flavorful.

This was okay--very rich from the sour cream and cottage cheese, but not especially cheesy per se.

I tried this recipe and loved it. I made it for a family gathering and the dish was scraped clean. ALL kids gave the recipe a "thumbs up" except for the bread crumbs.  It's now a requested dish at all the family parties!

I have been searching for a recipe for this exact type of baked mac n cheese for the last sixteen years!  This is the kind that was served in high school and I loved it!  I did not change one single thing about this recipe.  Just a warning to everyone that If you are the type that is looking for a very creamy type of mac n cheese, this is not it.  This is very firm and has a dry texture but you should still try it.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and bringing my search to an end, finally!

It was a huge hit, and will probably be my go-to recipe for future potluck dinners. As other reviews suggested, I added 1/4 cup milk and it was nice and creamy.

Added some Tuna to this one, you can use white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  Very good as a main dish.

It was a good mac and cheese, but not great. The consistency was a bit different, seems like the cheese (in particular the cottage cheese) didn't melt all the way through out the dish. I only used 1/2 the bread crumbs and it seemed too much. I really like a creamier version, so I think I would tweek it alittle more next time and opt out of using the cottage cheese.

This is an amazing mac n cheese recipe for cheese lovers. It is creamy, tasty and the consistency is perfect for a homemade mac n cheese. I added a bit less white pepper and I used sharp white cheddar instead. I made this for Thanksgiving and three times since upon request!

This is exactly what I was looking for. I was using the Betty Crocker cookbook recipe for mac n cheese but it was always so dry. This is my NEW recipe for mac n cheese. My family loves it and requests it as a side dish everytime we are making our menu for the upcoming weeks. I've also made it for holidays. Guests LOVE it. I couldn't be happier!

Love this recipe.  I have used this site many times and this if the first review because I felt guilty that I make this recipe so often and have never paid tribute!  I make as is, but use a different bread crumb topping (with real bread crumbs, melted butter and parmesan cheese, on top about 20 minutes into baking).  Get raves on this recipe, so thanks for sharing i!

Delicious!!  I wish I had made more. The dish was literally scraped clean!  I used half the bread crumbs and added some goat cheese for a little bit of a twist.  It was a huge success... not dry at all like i read in some of the reviews.

Can you say DRY? I gave this recipe a try because of the good reviews. (Even doubled it.) To me it was edible, but I'll never make it again. I don't think I would be able to get my family to try it again. Too big a risk and too costly.

I made this as a main dish. One out of three kids ate it without complaining. Of course they prefer Kraft. Good mac 'n cheese, but I will probably go back to my mom's recipe.

"Amazing" was the word used by my new (mid life newlywed) 17 year old Stepdaughter. I have been looking for the perfect mac/cheese recipe and this is it! I've tried them out of cookbooks, websites, etc and none have matched the rave reviews this one received as a Thanksgiving side dish. I doubled the recipe and used Seriously Sharp and Extra Sharp Cheddar cheeses, which I hand grated/shredded myself (always tastes better than packaged shredded). As recommended, I only used 1/4 cup bread crumbs on the top. I was concerned about using Italian bread crumbs b/c that's all I had on hand; but it didn't have a negative impact. It's important to remember to double the cooking time when doubling the recipe. Thank you MRSO for the best Mac/Cheese recipe any of the 10 people at our Thanksgiving table ever tasted!!

We tried a couple different mac recipes from online during the holidays last year and this was a huge crowd favorite.  This was the first recipe I tried from this site and it brought me back.  It's a go-to staple!  I made this for a friend when she had her baby and it was refrigerated for a week before they cooked it and she said it was the perfect comfort food she needed.  I didn't modify the recipe at all!

Everyone loved the flavor, but I did add some garlic powder.  I added milk per other reviews and it was still very very dry, maybe double the sour cream next time.

This had good consistency. It had good potential, but it was really REALLY bland.  Maybe if you made it with a mexican cheese or put in a bit of chili pepper... something to make it tasty. I'll use the recipe base again but I'll definitely be adding my own stuff to it.

This didn't knock my socks off like other reviewers, but I thought it was pretty good and super easy.  It was nice to just stir everything together and not spend time making a bechamel sauce like my usual recipe.  I would make this again, especially for a crowd.

Skip the breadcrumbs or use less than the recipe suggests. For me, it dried out the dish too much.

So good! I wouldn't skip the breadcrumbs. They gave great crunch.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added about a half cup of milk. I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese and added a bit of monterey jack for meltiness.

Excellent recipe!  I added cooked bacon and chicken to the mixture before baking, it was amazing!  I also used fat free sour cream and low fat cottage cheese to make it a little less fattening.

This recipe is amazing. It needs NO alterations. I make it all the time for family parties and everyone always freaks out about how great it is. It is so easy to make, and I have made it at least 10 times with all different serving sizes. It has turned out perfect everytime I have made it. I would like to thank whomever submitted this recipe for making my potluck days a whole lot easier!!!

I've made this twice now and think it needs 'something'.  We do like it, but I'm going to try a can of cheese soup mixed in next time.  It tends to be a bit dry so that should do the trick.

I really loved this recipe. I didn't leave my bread out to make bread crumbs so I didn't use that, but it really turned out great. My husband and older kids didn't like it all that much just because it doesn't taste like traditional mac and cheese, but my 9 month old and I ate it all up. :)

This was great! The only change I made was to substitute the shredded cheese for the bread crumb topping. Everyone loved it and it will replace my old recipe because of the great flavor, cheesy goodness and this recipe is also much easier to make! I made this ahead of time and just put it in the fridge until I was ready to bake it. Thanks!

I've been searching for and trying trying to find a great homemade mac and cheese recipe...I've FOUND it!  I used a 2qt baking dish & chose to sprinkle cheese on top instead of bread crumbs.  Also, the only modifications I'd make next time (for my family's personal preference) is use less cottage cheese and more sour cream...

Amazing! So good! I made this for my mom's wedding (the menu was all barbecue food) and it was a huge hit. I tweaked it a little bit: added garlic powder and dijon mustard and more shredded cheese, and instead of all cheddar i did half cheddar and half monterey jack. It turned out so well, and it was so easy to make! Thanks for sharing!

I'm usually very skeptical of recipes. This is the first from this website I've done and it was deeelish :) I decided to branch out from my hubby's grandmother's classic recipe so I wasn't sure about the ingredients at first but it turned out awesome. My hubby and our guests loved it and I'll definitely be making it again. Palate pleaser for sure. Mm mm :)

This was very easy and delicious. I made it for a gathering at my place and everyone loved it. I used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese. I doubled the recipe and used one chedder and one low fat chedder package. I boiled the noodels in part childen broth for a little extra flavlor and added about 8 strips of chopped, center cut bacon to the mix. A big hit. Will make again for sure!!

This mac and cheese is sooo good.  I make it all the time!  I use low fat cottage cheese, low fat sour cream and 2% cheddar.  It's delicious.  Sometimes I add in a little truffle oil to make it interesting.

I was given a recipe almost identical to this one.  I've made it several times and have adjusted several times.  This recipe is great with low fat ingredients.  Additionally, I make with seasoned salt (instead of regular salt), onion powder, garlic, and without the breadcrumb topping.  This is by far and away the easiest homemade mac and cheese recipe I have ever seen and the great part is that it is equally delicious in lower fat form.  Also, try cutting the sharp cheddar cheese in half and adding 1/2 a cup of low fat mozzarella for additional cheesy texture.

I can't stand "processed cheese food" mac and cheese, so I was very pleased to find this recipe. The first time I made it as is and it was good, but needed a little adjusment to my family's tastes.  I now double the recipe, add milk, dry mustard, cayenne and instead of bread crumbs, I crush seasoned crutons mixed with butter for the topping.  Delicious every time and never a scrap left.  Thank you!

I did not like this at all. The texture from the cottage cheese made it appear as if the cheese had curdled. The taste was just BLAH, there was nothing to it. I am not a spicy person, but this was just so bland. I would not make again.

Wow, this was cheesy! I made it with Italian breadcrumbs (all that I had).  I don't recommend this because the flavor doesn't interact well with the others.  I thought it was a little too cheesy, but my husband really liked it. Only problem is he ate too much and felt a little ill.  I did not go the low fat route so my 17 month old daughter could get her calories for the day.  I would make this again, but on a cold winter night as opposed to hot summer evening!  Its definitely comfort food.

This is my new "potluck recipe."  It's simple enough that I don't need the recipe to remember the ingredients at the store, and it's gotten me rave reviews everywhere.  The only alterations I've made are to use half again as much cheese (I recommend a blend of good melters) and I use extra fresh-grated parmesan on the top instead of messing with the crackers and bread.  It's delicious and you don't miss it!

Easy and tasteful.  I made this for 7 kids all aged 5 and under and they all gobbled it up.    I'll definitely make it again.   I followed the original recipe and it turned out great.

Left off the butter / bread crumb topping.  Added a can of diced tomatoes (drained).  It was tasty, but not the best mac and cheese I've ever had.

This mac and cheese is awesome!! The only thing I did differently was to add the half cup of milk so my leftovers wouldn't be dry as another reviewer suggested. This is a definite must. I will probably add closer to 3/4 cup of milk next time because leftovers were still a little too dry for my taste. I also added 1/2 cup of monterey jack cheddar blend as well as a 1 inch block of velveta, basically because I had them on hand and figured you can't have too much cheese. My whole famly gobbled it down as a main dish. We served it with fresh from the garden sliced tomatoes and it was perfect. My husband especially like the little bit of crunchy bread crumbs on top. I used about 1/2 cup of those and cut back the butter to 3 Tbsp instead of 4 just to cut down on the grease factor. My first time making baked mac and cheese and this is definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

It was delicious, however I would either recommend less bread crumbs or more butter with the bread crumbs. It was just a little over bearing, and hid the great taste of the mac and cheese!

This was very good!  Instead of bread crumb I use club crackers, it was what I had. I added 1/4 C milk.  Otther than that, made as written.  2 out of my 3 kids liked it and my husband and I thought it was a comfort food.  Thanks for sharing.

Really great! I don't have breadcrumbs so I crushed some crackers for the topping (regular, whole wheat and even graham cracker taste great). I also add a little bit of milk to it so that it is moister when reheated.

I have made this 3 times now.  I put the cottage cheese in the food processor which gave it a creamier texture.  I also use the food processor for fresh grated parmesan cheese and freshly shredded sharp cheddar.  What a difference.  I topped it with more shredded cheese because my 3 year old didn't like the bread crumbs.  He also made us pick out the pieces of pepper, so I no longer put pepper in it, just salt and it tastes just fine even if I forget to top my portion with pepper.  This is a new staple in our house.  The best mac and cheese EVER!!!

This recipe was actually given to my mom by her friend with the exception of adding a tsp or two of flour to the cheese base to ticken the sauce.  It's the easiest dish to put together and it tastes amazing, keeps well in the freezer and fulfills your cheese craving.  I've added green onions, olives, roasted red peppers, 1/4 blue cheese or feta and tomatoes for a twist.  But this dish is great just as it is!!!  You will be suprised and satisfied!!

This was pretty good. Not the best every, but I'll be making it again. It did have a bit of a tang to it.  -I used farfalle pasta, I don't know if maybe it had an effect on the finished result. -Added a bit of milk right before I put the bread crumbs on. Didn't measure, just poured a small amount over the top and stirred, probably less than 1/2 C.  I really do wonder if some people who made this used a 1 lb box of pasta instead of 8 oz, I didn't find it dry. The leftovers were a bit drier, but it wasn't like I needed a sip of water after each bite or anything.  I *loved* the breadcrumbs on top. I thought 1 C was just fine, but I like toppings :) I used the Progresso Italian style. Very good.

The sour cream and cottage cheese are an awesome spin!  I have made this several times and love it.  Don't use low fat anything!  It will ruin it.  If you are worried about fat.. just eat smaller servings of the mac and cheese and (and make your veggie side larger).

Awesome!  I used DiGorno Parmesan, Romano & Asiago blended cheese which gave it more flavor.  I also added 1/2 c almond milk to moisten it and cut the bread crumbs and butter in half.  I used gluten free pasta and bread crumbs.  I also tried subsituting low fat another day and it was pretty awful unless you microwaved it for a while!  I'd stick with the full fat in the future.

I was expecting more from all the amazing reviews on this site, but it was good/fine.  It's not very flavorful, and I used top-notch ingredients, so it wasn't that.  It's just kinda bland.  Otherwise, decent.

This was pretty good mac & cheese. I had leftover Mouse's Macaroni and Cheese (from this site), which I used as the base. I added all ingredients as stated, plus diced turkey ham. Even my picky daughter loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I am not a huge mac and cheese lover but I thought this was pretty good. I was a little nervous about the cottage cheese but it turned our really well. Hubby loved it and I will definitely make it again.

My 9 yr old daughter and I love the texture and taste of this mac and cheese. Pretty easy to make and doesn't take that long to make.

Five stars is not enough...This is the best mac and cheese I have ever had. It is so moist and the bread crumbs on top are the perfect touch. My whole family was in agreement that it was the best Mac and Cheese they have ever had.

Every time I make this for any event, i ALWAYS have requests for the recipe! I do add a little extra milk (about 1/2 C.) since it seems it tends to be on the dry side a little bit for us. Thank you MRSO for the great recipe!

WOW really really good!!!  Perfect exactly as the recipe is written.  I left mine in the oven about 40 minutes, so it wasn't as gooey as it should have been, but it was still excellent!  Next time I will only leave it in for 30 minutes.  Perfect comfort food.    As with another review I read, this is going in my top 10 or 15 recipes in my recipe box  =)

Best mac & cheese I've ever eaten, the whole family loves it. I do scale back the amount of sour cream to allow the cheese flavor to shine a little more. Also, I use panko for the crumb topping, add a little grated parmesan and only make about 1/4 the amt in order to cut back on the calories. Also use low-fat cottage cheese & sour cream. Add an additional 1/2 c skim milk for added moisture that makes the leftovers still be sublime

Oh. My. Goodness.  This was one of the best dishes I've ever tasted.  I didn't make it exactly as written, as the cottage cheese idea made me a little squeamish.  Instead, I mixed in some heavy cream for moisture (didn't measure).  Also used panko breadcrumbs, which were a perfect topping for this creamy and flavorful dish.

I doubled the cheese and added milk, and halved the bread crumbs. This was still waaaaay too dry, even right out of the oven. And bland. We will not be making this again. I guess some people like mac'n'cheese this way, but not us. Tasted like macaroni with sour cream and cottage cheese, with a bit of cheddar cheese mixed in.

This is SO good. I make it at least once a week, my household loves it so much.  I made two giant pans of it for Christmas for my entire extended family and there wasn't a bite left!  I use Panko bread crumbs on top because they get crispier, Italian flavored or plain, whichever I have on hand.

I made this recipe with a little milk but otherwise changed nothing and it turned out great. There was something coming across that overpowered it a little. Not sure what but I will play with it a little and see what I can come up with. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this (what I thought was) exactly the way it's written. I realized once everything was mixed that the recipe calls for an 8 oz box of pasta and I had used a lb. I was confused, surely an 8 oz box of pasta would not require a 9x13 baking dish? At the last minute I added extra cottage cheese, extra sour cream, extra shredded cheddar, extra grated Parm...but wasn't able to quite double everything the way it should have been. It came out ok, nothing to write home about. Didn't seem to all melt together like I would have expected. Could almost see the lumps of cottage cheese. Will give it another try. Also, I used extra sharp cheddar, next time will use regular sharp cheddar. Will 8 oz of pasta really require a 9x13 dish?

Excellent mac and cheese - super simple to make. I added roma tomatoes and imitation chunk  meet to make it a bit more interesting. Try some Tobasco sauce on it too. Great for adults and kids.

Excellent! I am in heaven. I used very few breadcrumbs and I added 1/4 cup evaporated milk and a teaspoon dried mustard. So good! Will be making this again. I will say the crunchiness of the breadcrumbs was a nice touch.

This Mac and Cheese is delicious. I use fat free sour cream, low fat cottage cheese, use half sharp cheddar/mild cheddar, the parmesean, and add a couple of peices of laughing cow swiss cheese wedges and it is perfect. Great taste and texture. I don't do the bread crumb topping, just add a little bit of each kind of cheese to the top. I love it!

Love this!  Tried with the exact recipe and it was great, but for my personal tastes I also added about 1/2 tsp garlic and onion power and also crumbled French's onions to the topping.  I would still give it 5 stars without any changes though. :)

This macaroni and cheese is great!  Every time I make it for gatherings I get compliments.    I suggest using Panko breadcrumbs so the topping is really crunchy.  It is a good contrast with the tender macaroni.

A bit too rich for me, but still tasty.  Probably better for side of mac rather than being the main course.   =P

This was a good mac and cheese, but not great.  I knew from the start that it was going to be different (sour cream and cottage cheese), but this was not better than just regular cheese and velveeta.  I finally realized what it tastes like--a grilled mac and cheese sandwich.  I also added 1/2 c milk and it was still fairly dry when reheated.  Not bad, but not memorable.

Excellent Mac 'n Cheese. A Favorite in my house. We do opt for replacing the Bread Crumbs with more Shredded Cheddar.

Thought this was really rich & had a good flavor. I made the following changes: used about 3/4 C of both sour cream & cottage cheese; added a squirt (maybe 1 t) mustard; added a splash (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 C) milk; used a mix of shredded sharp & mild cheddar & a bit of pepper jack; also used just about 2 T melted butter & about 1/4 C breadcrumbs over top. Thought this was a good change from the ordinary & a good meatless meal when paired w/ a salad or veggie.

I thought it was fabulous!  I'm so surprised at the negative reviews.  I didn't follow the recipe to a 't', but I made little changes to make it more our taste.  A touch of mustard, butter crackers instead of breadcrumbs, I blended the cottage cheese first, but I did everything else as directed, and I adored this.  My husband wished it was more "cheesy", and I'm thinking what I'll do next time to attempt that, but there will definitely be a next time - thanks!

very simple & delicious! I used whole wheat macaroni and old cheddar. I didn't really measure everything accurately and I probably added more cheddar cheese. I think next time, I might try crushing some corn flakes so that it's more crispy on top.

This was interesting. I liked how it was made with cottage cheese b/c it seemed not as fattening as other M&C recipes, however it was hard to get over the fact that the curds were visible after baking.  Also, I think there was too much sour cream.  I probably will make again, but reduce the sour cream and go without the bread topping and just add more sharp cheese in the last 5 minutes to give more cheese flavor.

This mac&cheese recipe was alright.  It wasn't very creamy or cheesy, but actually rather dry.  It was not a bad dish just not the conventional macaroni and cheese most are used to.

It tasted great, we left the crackers/ or bread crumbs off the top and covered it with cheese. The only problem with this recipe was I was really hoping the cottage cheese would blend better and not be quite so apparent. Everyone loved it anyway though.

Wow!  This recipe was wonderful.  My son normally eats his meat first, not this time...he inhaled his macaroni first, my daughter went nuts over it, they both requested to take the left overs to school for lunch the next day.  Hubby loved it too.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added  1/2 cup of milk.  I will definately make this recipe again. Thanks!

This was very different for macaroni and cheese.  I would call this a pasta dish with cottage cheese personally.  The taste is great with modifications.  I added in ground mustard powder, cayenne and about 1/2 cup milk as others suggested.  I didn't really measure the breadcrumbs on top.  The flavor was really good and I will make again.

WOW I was soooooooo impressed with this delightful recipe.  It tickles my stomach when we have it for dinner!  First servings are cheesy, but I always add milk when reheating leftovers or they will be dry. I give double thumbs up for the mouth-watering chuck's mac and cheese!  :o)

AMAZING!! SO good!! Double the sour cream though - I did on accident (actually I tripled it, loved it, doubled it loved it more, then finally made it the "right" way and it was just so so and much more dry).  It's now become the dish that I make for events. It's SO good! Breadcrumbs make it awesome too, don't change the amount.

i've been looking for a good mac n cheese recipe and i think i've found it!  the best mac n cheese i've ever made! i followed another reviewers advice by added 1/2 cup of milk and reducing breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup milk.  next time i might actually leave off the breadcrumb topping.

This was my first attempt at mac and cheese, and I was very concerned about the use of cottage cheese (because I'm not a fan), but it turned out great. I added 1/2 cup of milk, only used 1/4 butter + 1/4 breadcrumb, and layered the top with cheddar. Instead of mixing the sauce in the pan, I combined it in a mixing bowl; by the time it went into the pan the cottage cheese curds were no longer visible.  I'll definitely make again (but not for a long time because this an indulgent meal!).

My first "real" mac and cheese- so simple and yummy! I stirred all the ingredients into the pasta, and topped half with/half without Italian breadcrumbs (figured my kids wouldn't eat the part with) - the breadcrumbs added a surprising tastiness to the recipe that I didn't expect. Hubby (who is trying to avoid carbs) caved and REALLY loved it!

I was a little disappointed by this recipe. Way too much topping, and it really wasn't that cheesy.  It had a pretty good flavor once you got though all the topping, but it was lacking something. I won't be making this one again.

used whole wheat Rotini (all I had in the house), subbed milk & cream cheese for cottage cheese because I didn't have any. Aslo used half the bread crumbs & butter. Cut up a left over chicken breast and added that. Kids & husband loved it. Next time want to try it per the recipe.

This was not appealing in the least.  Neither my husband or I finished our servings and I threw the rest of it away.  I'm very suprised this has such a high rating

This is the BEST mac and cheese recipe that I  have used!  Always a huge hit in our house.  We have even added a large can of drained tuna to it to make the perfect cheesy tuna noodle casserole that kids will eat up!

This is a great twist on mac and cheese! I did change a few things though. I used about 2 oz less of both the cottage cheese and sour cream, 1/4 of breadcrumbs (Italian flavored) with only 1 tbs of butter. I also added just a little bit more cheddar cheese to make up for taking out the sour cream and cottage cheese. I also added about 3/4 of milk so it would be creamy. It turned out great! However, I think that next time I will use even less breadcrumbs.

THis was dry as a bone.  I'm a pretty darn good cook and I made this -on Thanksgiving. I added the extra milk and only sprinkled about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs on the top and it was still dry and lacked flavor.  IF I decided to try it again, I will make MANY MORE alterations!!

Way too much sour ceam taste.  I was out of cottage cheese, but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  I'll try it again but with less sour cream and maybe some mayo instead.  And I will add more cheese next time.  It was okay tasting, just not like mac n cheese.

This is a great hit at the firehouse. I add spicy Italian sausages, which I grill a bit before I add them to the mix. Also, I use Panko breadcrumbs instead of the melted butter/breadcrumb mix. A side of lightly steamed broccoli and you're done.

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe I have had!  We love it.  I didn't have all 8 oz. of sour cream -about 5 oz., so I added milk to make up the difference. I used both light cottage cheese and light sour cream, as well. I used less bread crumbs, about 1/4 C.   to lightly cover the top.  My son who usually isn't too impressed by homemade mac. & cheese ate 4 servings!  It's that good! It reheated nicely for lunch as well!

This one was good – I found it a little on the dry side.  Flavor was great but not the dripping gooey cheesy dish I was looking for.

This was good great recipe...I doubled the recipe, but added slightly less cottage cheese than the recipe called for; I also added 2% milk and more of the cheddar and parm cheeses on top, then the breadcrumbs on top of that.  I did cut the breadcrumb mixture in 1/2 as well.  My hubby and I enjoyed it very much; and I'm taking leftovers to my brother to taste!  I'm sure he will enjoy it!  Thanks!!

Great recipe! I only used 1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs though and made the dish in a 8x8.  I did add a pinch of garlic powder, 1/2 cup 2% milk, and mustard powder per another reviewer, but I'll leave out the mustard powder next time.  I also used whole wheat penne since that's what we had on had. And I used Parmesan/Romano mix since that's what we had.  Before I put the bread crumb/butter topping on, I added 4 round slices of Colby Jack.  I baked it for 35 min. Even my 13 month old and 2 yr old loved it!!

I was expecting something much better, neither my husband or I were real impressed. It didn't seem to have enough cheese and was a little bland. Otherwise by adding more flavor and cheese its a great recipe and really easy to make.

I didn't care for it, but my husband said he liked it and my mother-in-law LOVED it.  Too much of the sour cream flavor in it.  Maybe the combo of the sour cream and the cottage cheese?  I won't make this again, but mac & cheese is a preference thing, so don't let me stop you from trying it!

Gluten free lighter CROCKPOT version: substitute GF pasta, any combination of cheeses for total of 8 oz (I used low fat cheddar, extra sharp, and sharp cheddar), low fat cottage cheese. Since I had no sour cream, I substituted plain yogurt. Also substituted GF cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs. It went into the crockpot on low for 3-4 hours. It was yummy!

This recipe is awesome. Best Mac and Cheese on the planet. Only thing I changed was the topping. I use Cheddar Jack Cheez-its and a little bit less butter so they dont get so soggy. Ive made this countless times now. It works really well for get togethers and potluck dinners etc. Everyone raves about it. Kudos to whoever Chuck is.

Maybe it's my general distaste for cottage cheese, but this isn't the greatest mac 'n cheese I've had. I'll probably make this again with ricotta instead and see what happens from there.

Made this for my hubby & son tonight.  Changed it a little.  Used low fat parmesan like topping instead of grated parmesan.  Used shake & bake mix instead of bread crumbs because I was out.  Blended cottage cheese so the kids wouldn't see or taste the curds.  Used mild as opposed to sharp cheddar.  Also only used 5 ounces of shredded cheddar + 8 slices pepperjack cheese to give a little more flavor.   After cooking noodles until done, I drained them, then added all the rest of the ingredients to the pot the noodles had cooked in and cooked that over the heat for a few minutes to make sure all the cheese melted in good THEN added it to casserole pan.  That way I only had to cook it for about 20 minutes.   It went over well (especially for mac n cheese).

Pretty good variation on Mac 'n Cheese. I used Farfalle instead of Elbows which actually seemed more substantial. It wasn't too heavy with cheese but don't dare this one if even remotely lactose intolerant :)

Big hit with family! No bread crumbs so toasted whole wheat hamburger buns for 9 minutes at 400 degrees. Cooled - tossed in cuisinart with McCormick Italian Spices. Fantastic.   Also, since this was to be main part of meal, I thought 8 oz. of pasta would be skimpy for 9x13 casserole, plus I wanted leftovers. So I made entire 16 oz. box, doubled everything plus extra cheese (various in frige) and 1.5 cups skim milk per other suggestions. This fit my oval pan which is only slightly bigger than 9x13. Fed 5 adults plus leftovers.

Just made this mac & cheese, Did not use crumb topping because my kids don't like it, still came out great! Didn't have sharp cheddar so I used mild with 1/2 tsp of bottled mustard. Thank you!

This was very good.I made some adjustments using what I had on hand and it turned out great. I used penne pasta,I grated a 10oz block of cracker barrel extra sharp cheddar cheese,added Kraft Classic Melts (four cheese) to it and only used half of the sour cream it called for,I added evaporated milk and on top sprinkled more cheddar and Kraft classic melts and topped it with 1/4 cup of garlic  and herb breadcrumbs which I mixed with 2 tablespoons of butter.I baked covered for about 40 minutes and then 10 minutes uncovered and finished it by putting it under the broiler for 2 min. I served with broiled herb seasoned center cut pork chops and wilted spinach. It was a great meal!

This tasted great!  Next time, I won't use bread crumbs, I will just sprinkle more cheese on the top.

This was good but...I would add the 1/2 cup (or more) of milk or cream like others suggested. I would also add another 8 ounce pkg. of colby-jack cheese. It just wasn't cheesy enough for us. (we're from WI) It was good, but could be better.

I made this for Thanksgiving and even skipped the cracker topping.  Everyone loved it, and I ran out.  I'm doubling it for Christmas!  One slight change:  I used a five cheese Italian blend instead of the Parmesan - still awesome!

This was awesome! I didn't have plain bread crumbs so I crushed up some ritz crackers and sprayed it with butter Pam instead of pouring melted butter (all that cheese made me feel guilty). Sour cream and cottage cheese just add an amazing flavor to this recipe. This is my forever mac n cheese recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Addition: I now use Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) toasted in butter in a skillet to to top this awesome Mac n cheese!

I've made this 5 times now.  Oven and crockpot methods.  2 times with light/low fat items, 2 times with regular fat items and once I tried Fontina cheese vs cheddar and added some prosciutto to the mix.  Next time I'll do some fried up Pancetta.  In all cases though it's been fabulous and I keep getting asked for the recipe!  I love the response "Cottage Cheese? Really?".  Simply - THANK YOU for such a wonderful, and might I say, very EASY, recipe!!  This will be made again and again and I'd give it more stars if I could.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year, it was a hit!  Had to make extra for leftovers for home.  At the suggestion of others who rated, I increased the amount of cheddar cheese, added a little milk, and also cream cheese.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I will definitely be making this one again!  It was by far the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  The cottage cheese sounded weird to me, but it helps make this so rich and creamy.  I did cut back on the bread crumbs as suggested by others, and I'm glad I did.  I doubled the recipe but only used about a half cup of bread crumbs and it was plenty.

Fabulous! Everyone scarfed this down and want me to make it all the time. Just added a couple dashes of ground mustard and used ritz crackers instead. My husband and mother in law can't stand mac and cheese but they raved about this!

There wasn't anything I liked about this dish. I did leave off the bread crumbs...maybe they were the key ingredient, I don't know. It just wasn't the smooth, creamy, cheesy dish I thought it would be.

The texture is the problem with this recipe.  I put cottage cheese and sour cream in blender as another reviewer suggested.  I'm sure it helped, but the flavor was still "different."  I won't make again. Still on the hunt for the perfect mac and cheese.  The Triple-Cheese Macaroni on this site is much better.

I'm not big on mac and cheese, but this was a well-rounded meal. As many suggested, I added 1/2 cup of milk, and heated the milk, sour cream, cottage cheese, and cheddar cheese together in a saucepan until it was creamy, and then tossed it with the pasta. I had some polish sausage lying around, so I fried some up and threw it in with the noodles. I added cayenne pepper and garlic powder, and the final flavor was satisfying. It seemed nice and creamy to me; maybe that's because I added the 1/2 cup milk and I used a 16oz container of cottage cheese instead of 12oz. It was a recipe that would go over well with kids.

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I doubled the recipe and added a little garlic powder and onion powder as some other reviews suggested.  I also added 1/2 c. buttermilk.  Very good, and I am a mac and cheese snob.

I made this for my 2 year old's birthday dinner. My wife, who hates mac & cheese, LOVED it. I used extra cheddar, but it was mild. Will definitely use Sharp Cheddar next time.  I substituted crushed corn flakes for bread crumbs. This recipe is very easy, and sure to please everyone

Good recipe. Tasted more like cottage cheese and sour cream than the cheddar that I was expecting.  I would have liked for it to be more creamy also.  I will try adding a soft cheese like mozzarella  and more cheddar next time.

Deliciously decadent! My whole family loved this! I added half a head of cauliflower, steamed and pureed with a 1/2 C of milk. I also only used 2 T butter and 1/2 C whole wheat panko bread crumbs. It reaheated well the next day and was just as yummy!

I followed the directions exactly. I prefer my mac and cheese creamy and this wasn't even close to creamy. It tasted like the kind of mac and cheese you get at a buffet at some cheap place. For all the cheese in it, it was lacking flavor.

Not what I expected. Followed the recipe exactly except for a tiny bit of mustard powder. We all thought that the cottage cheese and sour cream were interesting. Reminds me of a buffet mac and cheese--sorry, everyone who had it thought it was "meh" in taste.

I had high hopes, but my family didn't like this at all.  Too many bread crumbs, too dry, bland flavor.

This is a very "grown up" mac & cheese (but not so grown up that the kdis don't enjoy it--it IS mac & cheese!) Quite yummy!  I use Italian bread crumbs, and instead of the sour cream, I use a pint of ricotta and one egg, as in more traditional italian cooking.  This is a great quick fix, and an even better freezer meal to pull out on busy night--I'll actually be taking it to Thanksgiving this year.

I love, love, love this recipe!  It is even great making it a little healthier by using lowfat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream with whole wheat pasta.  I also sometimes mix ham or kielbasa in with it to make it a casserole!  This is definitely a family fav!

Too many bread crumbs, about a 1/4 cup would be plenty, then this would be a five star recipe.  I'll try it again with this one modification!

I would give just the crunchy buttery bread crumbs on top of the mac and cheese 5 stars by themselves. For me those MADE this meal. I used milk instead of sour cream, which I'm glad because I don't like things tasting too sour. And I used less than called for. I also added some onion, garlic and cayenne powder for extra flavor. It turned out better than I imagined.

After making this I had to go back and see if I followed the recipe correctly, which I did. It was good I guess, and very easy to make, but the cheese sauce didn't come together at all. It was like cottage cheese with melted bits of cheddar sprinkled throughout. I like macaroni and cheese to have a thick, smooth, creamy sauce, and this didn't come out that way at all. It didn't taste bad, it was just disappointing cause it wasn't what I think of when I think of mac and cheese.

Quick and Easy!  My wife loves it. I halved it, mixed in a cup of milk and replaced the bread crumbs with crushed corn flakes.  Move it up a rack for the last ten minutes to add more color to the topping. Things you can add:  ham, peas, onion or tomato sauce. Don't tell my wife but I did add a little more cheese then it called for.

We loved this recipe!  The only thing that I did differently, was I made a double recipe and doubled everything except for the sour cream & cottage cheese - I used the original amount - and I added about a 1/4 cup of milk.  It came out great!

The recipe was absolutely awesome!!!  I read a lot of the reviews before deciding to make it, and I was NOT disappointed.  I did double the cheese and didn't use the bread crumbs because I don't care for them, and added milk as many reviews suggested.  This will be my Mac n cheese recipe for LIFE.  Thanks Chuck for posting.  I can't wait to make it again at Thanksgiving!

Awesome mac and cheese recipe!  We all loved it!  Leftover were so good as well.  Defiantly will be the only way I make mac and cheese from now on.  I didn't put the bread crumbs on top only because I didn't have any and I didn't feel like making any.  But it was still just as good without them.

My first time making this.  Doubled the recipe- it turned out great!  Took to a Halloween party and was a hit for kids and adults.  Used panko bread crumbs instead and put under broiler for 3 minutes once at the party- browned beautifully for serving & gave great crunch on top.  Would definatley make again.

This was great, I really enjoyed it, but it was REALLY rich! I think it was the cottage cheese, but it tasted a little saltier and not as cheesy as the way I normally make mac. I used almost double the cheddar too.....the bread crumbs were good, I followed the recipe exactly except for using more cheese.

I've made a few mac & Cheese recipes from this site. This one has been the easiest and tastiest so far.  As for the breadcrumbs, I used Panaku (it was all that I had) and it gave a REALLY extra crunchy topping, which the husband loved.

I used whole wheat pasta and halved the bread crumb topping.  Tasted sourish and the white cottage cheese is unexpected to see.  Wanted more of a traditional savory cheddary taste.

This is the best baked mac and cheese ever!  I will use this recipe forever.  I added a little more shredded cheese than called for and added itlaian bread crumbs a little more than the recipe called for as well.  You won't be disappointed

Minus out most or all of the bread crumbs and this is a winner!  It surprisingly tastes really good with the inclusion of sour cream and cottage cheese.  The bread crumbs ruined it in my opinion; It tasted like eating breaded mac n chz - ick! If I altered this recipe in any fashion I would just add some red bell pepper and mushrooms.

This was really good stuff - best baked mac and cheese I've made yet! It's still missing a little something - maybe next time I'll add more seasoning (added garlic, paprika and hot sauce this time around) or try some ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

Good recipe I made the original the 1st time but the 2nd time around I added 1/2 c 2% milk & 1/4 cup cream cheese.  I also put several splashes of chipotle tabasco on the topping. YUM

This was delicious!  I added some chopped up ham and served it as a main course and it was GREAT.  Our guests asked for the recipe!  I will say that I will add about 3/4 cup of extra milk or cream next time...the leftovers this time were pretty dry, so it will help with that, plus I just like a creamier mac and cheese.

I too added 1/2 cup milk and it made the left overs devine. I used 1/2 ritz crackers and received mulitple compliments on the topping. This is my new favorite!!!

Wow!!  I listened to the advise of some other reviewers and added 1/2 cup milk and decreased bread crumbs by 1/2 cup.  I also added lots and lots of crushed red pepper cause I like it spicy!  This is pretty much the most tasty, cheesy, comfort food that made a hard day of marriage turn to bliss. Thank you a million!

Soooooo yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing.  It makes a lot of food so my husband and I were eating it for a few days.  It's not as mouth watering good the second day, but it was still quite tasty!

The flavor was EXCELLENT!  This is preferable to other recipes that include eggs, which in my opinion weaken the flavor.  This was very cheesy!  Because I only had mild cheddar, I added the following to give it more "zing": 2 dashes curry powder, about 1/8-1/4 tsp. dry mustard, and 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. garlic salt.  (Yum!!!  I'm going to make it this way all the time!)  I am giving it only 4 stars because of the texture.  I prefer a creamy mac 'n' cheese, and although this was very saucy, the sauce itself was very grainy.  I did run the cottage cheese through a blender, but it didn't help much.  I wonder if shredded parmesan would melt better than grated, or if another creamier/better melting cheese could be substituted.  Also, I see why people added more macaroni; 8 oz. does not make much and does not fill up a 9 x 13 pan.  I would keep all the same proportions (because all that sauce really makes it good!), but increase the entire recipe by half.  Wonderful recipe overall; will definitely make again!

My husband said-"Don't tell mom, but, this is better than hers!" The only change I made was rather than bread crumbs (I didn't have any) I made my own with garlic and cheese croutons- awesome!

I thought this was kind of terrible. It had a very sharp tang from the cheese, of course, but also from the sour cream.  Also, it looked kind of gross because of the cottage cheese.  Not a fan.

Fine Work Chuck!  I cannot believe there are ratings below 5!  If you like you mac and cheese out of the box, don't make this.  If you like homemade mac and cheese where it is a bit dryer, (still creamy, just not soaking!) then this is for you!  My solution, too dry? Add Butter.  Too Moist, more cheese and bread crumbs! YUM!

EDITED: 7/6/10
I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could!  It's fairly easy to make and so good.  I usually make it every couple of weeks, and serve it with lots of fresh veggies!  In fact, I no longer use the recipe as I know it by heart!
This is a great basic recipe, and also very easily altered to adjust for what I have in the fridge.  Tonight I subbed Swiss because I didn't have the Parmesan on hand, and it was just as good.
Though I used to pre-melt the cheeses with about 1/3 c of milk, I now find that to be unnecessary.  I just add all of the ingredients minus the noodles to my 9x13 plus the 1/3 c of milk, then stir the noodles in.  The milk is important, because without it can get a bit dry.  I've also used half & half in a pinch, which was very good as well.
Please note that this is NOT a recipe for Velveeta type mac & cheese, and if that is what you are looking for you will not be pleased.  This is a rich, tangy oven baked mac & cheese.

this recipe was good, but not what I was looking for.  I'm looking for something a little creamier and cheesier.  Maybe if you add more cheddar....Also, too many bread crumbs.

This was a pretty good recipe.  A little dried out though... I guess I like a little creamier of a mac and cheese.  Thanks for sharing though.  I will probably make it again.

I made this to serve with a Pork roast and Lima beans for my son-in-law's Birthday dinner.  It was great everyone loved it and he had three servings.  I made it lite as some others mentioned.  Fat free sour cream, cottage cheese and skim milk.

I have attempted various forms of mac and cheese for years and was unable to get it right.  This recipe was so simple and yet it came out truly delicious.  For this first time, I followed the directions exactly.  Next time, I will try to add some meat and/or veggies to make it well-rounded.  Thank you!

I'm so happy with the way this turned out. Specially since I added half a zucchini (raw)and 1/2 cup cauliflower (boiled)with a squeeze of lemon that I processed in the food processor. My kids are picky eaters so I have a hard time getting veggies in their system that's why I snuck it in this.  I didn't bother with the breadcrumb topping but everything else I followed exactly.  I just added the cup of smooth "veggies" to the cheese and macaroni mix. Delicious! Cauliflower and zucchini are my least favorite vegetables but you couldn't trace a hint of their taste with all the nice cheezy taste in this dish. I had seconds and thirds and the kids had seconds. I can't wait to find out what my husband thinks when he comes home from work and tries it. Thanks Chuck!!!

This is a delicious recipe for mac and cheese. I did add a few extras (peppers, onion and cubed ham as this was all we were having for dinner) However for a side dish no add ins were needed.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is the absolute best.  I add gruyere just becaue I am a cheese lover and andouille sausage because I am a firm believer that a meal isn't a meal without some meat.  The sausage is pre cooked so I don't have to cook it first.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it is FAB U LOUS.  Thank's Chuck.

Delicious, although maybe not "knock your socks off." I like how the cottage cheese and sour cream disappear to make it creamy and a bit healthier.  Next time I'll try it with whole-wheat macaroni and maybe add in some fresh parmesan instead of the stuff from the shaker.

I made this recipe for company last night and was really disappointed.  Very dry and not a lot of taste.  I rechecked the recipe to make sure I had not left something out.  I probablt will not make it again, I will stick with my old yummy recipe.

I made this for my cheese-loving wife and she loved it.  I added a can of condensed tomato soup and used Italian breadcrumbs.  Oh my god, it was delicious.  After dinner I couldn't stop scraping the sides of the pyrex with my fork. I recommend eating with a side of spinach or something green to cut through all the fat.

This is a great recipe. I was a little worried as I don't really care for cottage cheese, but I pulsed it in the processor first and mixed it with the other ingredients. It was wonderful. Everyone had seconds.  I doubled the recipe.  Thanks for a great macaroni & cheeze.

The best homemade mac&cheese I've ever had!  I only used 3/4 cup breadcrumbs, and I can't imagine any less than that being enough. Awesome dinner for a cold winter night, and great leftovers for the next day!

This was excellent and totally unlike the one I have prepared for years so it was a nice change.  The only thing I will do different is use less bread crumb topping and will bake it in a smaller sized pan.  This makes a good side dish where as the one I make is more a main meal dish.  Nice flavors too.

Me and my family LOVED this recipe!!!  I've tried several different mac n cheese's and have never found one that I like until now.  I used some Italian Bread Crumbs on top because that was what I had, and it turned out wonderful.  I'm making it again this weekend for a get together.

I haven't made homemade mac n cheese in years, but it was what my daughter requested for her last meal before going off to college, so...  I followed the recipe as written and although the family had mixed reviews about the breadcrumbs, this recipe was a huge hit.  It is real comfort food for sure!  Thanks for the recipe, MRSO!

Not bad.  It was easy enough for my husband to make, but it was a bit dry, next time will use some milk or cream. Will use less bread crumbs as well though it gave a nice crunch every bite!

I followed this recipe as written (though I tend to "eyeball" quite a bit), with the exception of subbing crushed croutons for the bread crumb and butter on top. (Which will henceforth be how we have it-- SO good!) This will be "my" mac and cheese from now on. :) Thank you for a great recipe!

I am sorry to add a negative review when so many people seem to like this but I didn't like it at all, in fact, no one in my family liked it.  We still have a lot of left over and I will have to toss it soon.  I thought it was too tangy and had too much topping on it.

Yummy!  I doubled the recipe and added 8 oz of shredded colby mont jack cheese with 8 oz of sharp cheddar. It still fit perfect in 9x11 dish. I did not have parm cheese on hand.  The bread crumbs made it really yummy!  I only used 3/4 cup and will use more next time.  All of my family enjoyed this dish!

I LOVE THIS!!!  I made a few very minor changes: 1) added a bit of dried mustard powder, 2) added a bit of whole milk, 3) cut the bread crumbs by half.  This is DIVINE!  I love this texture of macaroni and cheese.  If you are looking for the smooth, creamy kind, this is NOT the recipe you want to do, but if you're looking for the kind to evoke memories of a down home potluck, you can't get much better than this recipe.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

To be honest, I was not that impressed with how this turned out.  It was pretty dry & it tasted somewhat sour.  I didn't think it was very "cheesy" either...

I used Japanese breadcrumbs which make a very nice crust. But I have to say this Mac is very bland. Today it is so firm I will have to slice it and fry it. Perhaps that will improve it. I think there are better recipes out there. Update: SRIRACHA Hot Chili Sauce saved the day and made it a fantastic dish with a KICK. OK I heated the bowl with the Mac and Cheese in the oven, than added 3/4 c milk and 2 tsp of the HOT Chili sauce. Use less if you don't like spicy. I added some more cheese and baked it another 30 Minutes. Now this is good.

Ewww.. I didn't care for the taste or the texture.  The sourcream was way too overbearing and the cheeses didn't really melt very good.  Oh well, this won't be a keeper.

This recipe was so easy. The flavor was good and a little tangy. I did add some milk per other reviews and found that the dish was a bit soupy, next time I'll skip it. I forgot the breadcrumbs and didn't miss them. Will make again.

I've never reviewed a recipe before, but this was so good that I felt compelled to share. I made it for the first time last night and everyone LOVED it.  I'm talking everyone had third helpings!  I followed the basic recipe, making a few tweaks based on other reviews.   I added a 1/2 c. of skim milk, as well as a dash of paprika. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs to add a little spice which worked really well. I used low-fat cottage cheese, sour cream and reduced fat cheddar cheese to make it a little healthier, but the taste wasn't compromised at all.  We will definitely be incorporating this as a dinner staple in our house!

This was quite dry, and lumpy from the cottage cheese. Maybe we're just creamy mac and cheese people, but our regular roux with cheese recipe is 10 times better. To be fair, I did use lowfat sour cream and cottage cheese.

We didn't like this very much. Very little flavor. Could have used garlic or something. I used seasoned bread crumbs. The flavor of them was overwhelming compared to the bland mac and cheese. Won't make this again.

This was a very easy recipe to put together, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best either. 1 cup is way too much bread crumb. I'll cut that in half if I make this again. It was very creamy and not too heavy, but it seemed like there was something missing. If I make it again, I will definitely play with the recipe and try adding different things to it to jazz it up. A little blah for my taste.

Flavor was good but the texture grainy and I actually blended the cottage cheese before use. I think the parmesan adds to the graininess.

This recipe was "OK".  The ease of preparation is good, but it just didn't have a whole lot of flavor..  I will probably make it again when I want mac & cheese without the hassle of making the  beschamel, but I'll add about 50% more cheddar.  I think it definitely needs more cheddar.

Delicious. Followed exactly as recipe states. It is a different kind of mac n cheese.  The sour cream and cottage cheese didn't create a creamy texture like traditional mac n cheese. Which is why it's not a 5 star because it wasn't exactly as I expected it to be. But the crumb topping was a great touch.  I loved it.

This was Great, it was tasty and even my picky eater (boyfriend) enjoyed it.  The best part about this recipe though i find is how easy it was. My father makes a mac and cheese but it requires melting cheese in milk on the stove top, and that takes ages and also ends in a pot that needs alot of scrubbing each time no mater how much you try to keep it from burning on the bottom.  Where as this recipe, makes very few dishes to clean, and those it does make are easy to clean. Also no need to be chained to the stove, simply cook pasta then mix everything togeather then stick in stove and walk away.  i followed the recipe exactly, and was very happy with the results, next time i will use slightly less crumbs, but even as it was it was great!  will be making again forsure!

This is a really nice recipe, and more of an adult flavor than other mac and cheese recipes I've tried.  I ate this as a main course, and it's a little heavy for that.  I will definitely make this again, but next time small portions as a side dish.

It was ok. The cheddar cheese didn't melt into the cottage cheese and didn't stick to the pasta. It wasn't the creamy melty cheesey mac 'n cheese that I was expecting.

YUM!!  Very very good.  I did add some milk and I'm very glad I did.  I think it would have been too dry without it.  Great great recipe, although I'd definitely consider it a "heavy" dish with all the cheeses, etc.  None of us could each much.

I didn't add enough cheese and cream and I'm sure that affected the outcome. When I added Bac~Os, though, it was absolutely delicious.

This is the best mac-n-cheese ever! Every time I make this recipe I get so many compliments - from the kids and the adults. The only thing I do different is put cheddar cheese on top, rather than breadcrumbs. Yummy!!

I do not eat Mac and Cheese, but I was asked to make it for a party at work.  Everyone raved about it. My husband loved it. It must have been great because I made a double batch and it was gone before the first round of people ate. I did add 1 cup of milk like suggested and I only put 1/2 the suggested breadcrumb topping on it.

So far, every time I make this, everyone loves it!  I always use low-fat or fat-free cheese products (except the parmesan) and everyone raves!  This last time, I used a jalapeno cheddar cheese (50% reduced fat), and that gave it a lot of flavor, too.  Possibilities are endless with this recipe!!

It was definitely a crowd pleaser... had to add some velveeta to heat up and serve the next day... will do that from the beginning next time to make it "creamier" for the kids... overall, though, great recipe!

This was WONDERFUL! Not like your traditional southern mac n cheese but SO tasty! My husband and kids loved it. Even my picky 4 year old liked it(trust me, that speaks VOLUMES!). I didn't realize I was out of elbow macaroni, so I used whole wheat egg noodles instead. I did used all natural light sour cream and mixed in some milk before adding the bread crumbs. I could tell it would have been too dry otherwise. This is a definite keeper in my household! Thanks for the recipe:)

This is a great recipe!  I use different combinations of cheese everytime I make this and so far monterey jack and cheddar cheese is the best combination.  One variation I have found that we like better is melting the sourcream and cottage cheese down with the cheese before combining with the macaroni.  It makes it into more of a cheesy sauce for those people who aren't used to homemade style mac and cheese.

This wasn't horrible, it just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  It had the baked consistency vs creamy type that I was looking for, but I definitely found it to be lacking in the flavor department.  Perhaps adding more cheese and more salt would help.

i really enjoyed this dish and others said it was pretty good. we did this for easter so i was too busy to get a picture(which i try to do with every dish from this site). the only riff i had about this dish was the fact that it didnt mix as well as i wanted it to while baking. next time i think i will bake with out the topping for most of the time and stir as it bakes then add the topping at the end in just enough time for it to get crispy!!!

My husband and I did not care for this mac & cheese.  It tasted ok, but it did not compare to other recipes I have tried.  The texture was not creamy, and the taste was not cheesey enough.  Our friends, however, liked it alot and one said it was the best mac & cheese he's ever had.  But then again, he's only had the box kind!  It's worth a try, but if you like the cheesey, creamy mac & cheese you won't be satisfied w/ this recipe.

Another reviewer was correct - it's hard to rate this because it's a matter or individual taste.  I happen to like my mac & cheese creamy.  However, I appreciated this recipe greatly and am glad that I tried something new.  I wouldn't make it again, but enjoyed it all the same.

This is one of the best Mac & Cheese recipes I've ever made. And it's so easy. I added some spices: paprika, cayenne and a little nutmeg. An extra 1/2 cup of milk will make it moister as left overs

Mmmmmmm... I, too, omitted the butter and breadcrumbs. My daughter liked it and it impressed my mother-in-law who is a fabulous cook.  Must mean it's good!

I had a different idea of what this was going to turn out like.  Although it was still very good, I expected a rich, creamy dish. I understand now when the other reviewers said this wasn't like Velveeta.  Definitely worth a shot though!

Very good! I didn't think I was going to like it but to my surprise, my whole family liked it.  However, I did use only 4 ounces of sour cream (not a big fan), 1/3 cup bread crumbs WITHOUT butter and 1/2 cup of milk.

DELICIOUS!!! So much more flavor than your everyday mac & cheese and very easy to make. I prepared mine the night before for a playdate lunch. I put it in the fridge overnight. I microwaved it for 10 minutes to warm it up some then I topped it with crushed Ritz crackers and baked it at 350 for 10 minutes. It turned out great!!!

This would have gotten 5 stars if it were not for the bread crumbs on top, that didn't sit well with my guests, but the recipe overall is a winner.

This is perfect macaroni and cheese - tasty and moist enough to enjoy as leftover.  I added 1 pound of grated cheese (american, swiss and cheddar) and 1/4 cup of milk and it was delicious.

This was super good, and fairly easy for anyone to make.  One of the best recipes I've cooked so far. The modifications I made were 2x the smoked cheddar, 1/4c more parm, sprinkled atop generous amount of 3 cheese motzarella, cheddar, swiss I topped the whole thing off with some grilled bread crumbs and crushed up Tim's Maui Onion Chips.  Fishinig with fresh maple honey ham strips laid over everything, which I cut from deli ham,  it was time to go into the oven.  Delicious! And the leftovers were just as good, if not better :)

This was the best Mac & Cheese I have had. I stuck with the recipe with no alterations and was not disappointed. However, My son (who is 6) was not to thrilled. He is used to boxed and he wasn't too happy with the differences in texture.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, what with the cottage cheese and sour cream. But I made it for my book club's "Gone with the Wind" meeting (we were going for southern food) and it was fantastic! I added a little onion powder, some cayenne pepper, and 1/2 cup milk.  I had to send the recipe out to everyone who came to book club! If you're looking for a good mac N cheese recipe this one is a crowd pleaser.  My 1 year old and 5 year old also loved it.

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of adding a 1/2 cup of milk per other reviewer.  The next time I make this I will add more salt and some onion and garlic for more flavor.

This was pretty good.  It had a good flavor, and I added some hot sauce to "kick it up" a bit.  This is definitely the baked-style of mac and cheese - not the creamy version.  Very easy - nice to not have to slave over the stove top with this one (no white sauce!)

WOW! This recipe turned out AMAZING! My husband does not like homemade Mac and Cheese and he scarfed this down. I only rated it a 4 because I changed a few things. I used Velveeta cheese instead of Sharp Cheddar because Cheddar tends to give a grainy texture to the macaroni. Velveeta gives it the added creaminess everyone loves. I also added a little half and half at the end to make sure it didn't dry out. Lastly instead of using bread crumbs I used crushed up Cheese-It's and that made it even better. It turned out amazing! My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.

This is a good basic recipe which can be expanded on to suit your taste.  I added about a cup of milk because the mixture seemed a little dry. Next time I may add more. I also used a mexican cheese blend.... added a couple tbs. of garlic powder,eyeballed  the adding of dijon mustard, worchester sauce, cajun seasoning, and white pepper to taste. I also used crushed ritz crackers w/o the butter. My BF who was tramautized by his childhood mac and cheese, was hesitant at first, but really enjoyed it after trying it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

i made mine with way less breadcrumbs- since the amount seemed silly anyways for such a small amount of actual food. Very rich and creamy. I have had no problems reheating this one (better not since i take it to work!). I passed it on to the in-laws and they loved it too. this is 4+4 stars really. it just seems to be missing some kind of spicy tang, but it's pretty good on its own. this time around i added in a green pepper. hopefully this will turn out just fine.

I didn't change a thing to this recipe and it is far and away one of the best mac and cheeses I've even had.  Rivals some of the best in any restaurant. I added more cheddar cheese than called for but that's cause I was shredding it myself so couldn't gauge exactly 8 oz and I figured more was better. I was right.

I used a little less cottage cheese and added 1/2 cup of milk - thought of cottage cheese in it scared me a little - and I am a cheese fanatic so I added a little extra cheddar. I used half Panko and half seasoned bread crumbs for my crumb topping.  My family went nuts for this - I really liked it and I usually can't stand the thought of eating mac & cheese.   A keeper in my book!

This was a nice easy family meal. It was creamy without being too rich, and I liked the flavors of the different cheeses.  I added some chopped ham & peas, and subsituted crushed goldfish crackers for the bread crumbs.

This was good, it was very creamy. I did exactly what the recipe told me to do and it turned out like they said it would. My husband loved it and was very surprised to find that there was cottage cheese in it. And of course my six year old was crazy about it too, but what kid isn't crazy about mac n cheese. I think next time I'll add ham and peese to make it a whole meal.

Whoa...that's a lot of crumb topping!  It made it way too salty.  I scraped off what I could and that improved the rating from a 2 or 3 to 4 stars.  I used almost 1/2 t. black pepper and 1/4 t. salt.  I will drastically reduce the crumb topping next time.

Made this recipe twice....both times I thought this was a great mac n cheese.  I did add 1/2-3/4 cup milk and did throw in 1/2 bag of shredded velveeta.  Also, I used Ritz crackers instead of the breadcrumbs, sprinkled some garlic powder in them and added the rest of the shredded velveeta.  Put this combo on the mac n cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.  Delish!

Delicious twist on an old classic.  Make as is or use crushed melba toast (onion or garlic flavor) instead of breadcrumbs for a crunchy topping.  YUMMMMMM!

Delicious. I upped the cheese amounts a bit and cut back on the sour cream and cottage cheese (I didn't want it to be too soupy) and added more pasta to the sauce. I also threw in some broccoli about 2 min. before the pasta was done...SOOOO Good. My 1 year old daughter LOVED this.

It was really cheesy and I would understand why mac and cheese lovers would enjoy this recipe although it was not my cup of tea.  I added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of milk as others suggested as it would have been super dry without.  I also substituted soy cheese, fat free sour cream and low fat cottage cheese and no one could taste the difference.  Bon appetite!

I made this recipe for me and my roommates and we all loved it! I am a new cook, with not a lot of experience, but besides looking for a new mac n cheese recipe, I will definitely make this again.

I will make this again, but mainly because it was SO easy to throw together.  I did not think it was the absolute best mac and cheese I'd ever had, but super easy to make.  Next time I would probably puree the cottage cheese before mixing it in.

Followed the recipe step by step. Tried it immediately after and it tasted gross. Tried it again 1/2 hour later hoping that it might taste better after it cools with no such luck. Threw away the rest. Quite a waste. Sorry.

This recipe was fantastic! It was so easy to make and double.  I made this the night before the party and added about 1/2 cup of buttermilk before putting this in the fridge over night.  The next day I added the breadcrumbs and the butter (dabs) before putting it in the oven.  It got rave reviews!

Everyone really liked this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I always wondered how some places got that curd like texture to the mac and cheese, now I know.  Thanks for the recipe.

I must admit, I was surprised by just how good this simple recipe was. A great choice for those looking for a homemade mac and cheese recipe, but don't want to spend the money on some of the more expensive cheeses out there. Comfort food at its finest. Great as a leftover as well.

We followed the suggestion to use half the breadcrumbs written, and also add 1/2 cup milk to prevent dryness. This recipe was good, and the cottage cheese gave it a lighter, non greasy taste. It didn't knock our socks off. If I made it again, I would put more salt (I only added 3/4 teaspoon or so, because I thought the cheese would make it salty enough, but it didn't), and more pepper.

I made this dish for Christmas Dinner  and no one liked it.  I enjoyed the flavor, but it was dry.  I added the half cup of milk as other people recommended but it was extremely dry. This isn't a dish I would make for my family again.

Great taste -but WAY too much bread crumbs! Next time I will try crushed crackers and use only 1/3 - 1/2 cup. Also, I think it would be better in a deeper, smaller dish.  It was such a thin layer in the 9x13 that it was a little dry.

I added bacon because bacon makes everything better! It needs more cheese and next time I'll add more. Overall I really enjoyed the amount of bread crumbs the recipe called for, I even added a little bit more. I was happy with the result of the recipe!

I've tried nearly all of the mac & cheese recipes on this site and this is by far the best!  I used medium instead of sharp b/c its all I had & it was good.  I used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs b/c its all I had as well & it was good as well.  It was so moist & didn't get dried out like mac & cheese usually does.  I love this!  Thanks for sharing.

This is my favorite mac & cheese recipe yet. Rather than the bread crumbs and butter, I normally use croutons- garlic cheese flavor. Sometimes I put them over top whole, and other times I crush them into crumbs. We love the flavor these give. Great recipe- OH, and I normally don't care much for cottage cheese, but I think it really makes this recipe great!

I made this recipe as it states and my family found it to be too salty and not creamy enough.  We are used to the white sauce mac and cheese and wanted to try something different.  I probably won't make this again but I am glad to have tried something new.

I made this recipe exactly as it says to and it was ok.  My husband loved it.  I thought that it had too much bread crumbs and not enough cheese, but I think it depends on your taste.  My husband hates velveeta so I could never put that in it.  I am going to make this again though.  I am going to cut down the topping by at least half and I am going to add more cheese.  I wasn´t real thrilled with the cottage cheese as it didn´t melt and it was weird to see chunks of white stuff in the mac and cheese.  I am going to try processing it in the food processor first like someone else suggested.  I also think I may melt the cheese mixture on the stove first.  This is still a decent recipe though.  It´s all in what you like!

This was really awesome. I made a few changes just because of our tastes.  I was worried about the consistency of the cottage cheese so I threw it in the food processor and smoothed it out a little more.  I added one egg and a little half and half to the cheese mixture.  I also added a little sauteed minced onion and garlic.   Super delicious.

AWESOME recipe - I wouldn't change a thing other than making a double batch to make sure there is enough.  The pan seems large enough to handle it doubled.

I tried this recipe last night and it was so good, I didn’t have any cottage cheese so I substituted it for a pkg of cream cheese and everyone loved it I don’t know if I will try it the original way because this way came out so good!

I have finally found a mac and cheese recipe that I can make healthy!  This was so easy to alter to keep the fat down and add additional nutrition.  I used whole wheat noodles, low fat cottage cheese and fat free sour cream.  I blended the cottage and cheese and sour cream to gain a better consistancy for picky kids (it came out like ricotta).  Then, I added southwestern seasoning salt, italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I mixed a half a cup of 1% milk to make it creamier.  I used 4 oz of low fat mexican cheese blend, 4 oz of italian cheese blend, and 4 oz of colby jack (I didn't have chedder or parm).  I even added a cauliflower/zuchinni puree to the mix to add a little more nutrition.  The kids didn't know the difference - said it was their favorite mac and cheese!

interesting.  the flavors are good, though i admit i doctored mine up by adding cooked chicken and bacon crumbles, green onions, and garlic pepper.  i also used a combo of sharp and mild cheddar and some mild Monterey jack.  and increased the ratio of pasta (narrow corkscrew shape.) still, the texture of this dish i would call "a noodle casserole with cheese" not my vision of "mac and cheese."  but i was expecting that from reading the other reviews.  for the people who wrote it tasted like "with egg" custard style baked mac and cheese without the egg -i think i'll throw in an egg if i make it again. again, interesting to make if you have the ingredients on hand, but i wouldn't buy stuff just to make this.

I have been looking for a good mac 'n cheese recipe and this one hit the mark. We added some cubed turkey ham but it would have been excellent without it.

very good! I had to tone down the heat a bit because of the kids, but still had plenty of flavor. I topped the kid's bowls with sour cream and cheese - they loved it!
This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this was a great recipe and it sure was a crowd pleaser.  Next time I'll experiment with additional cheeses and will add a little bit of Tabasco sauce and red pepper flakes to give it a little bit of kick.  Be sure to reduce the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup and omit the butter if you’d like as I don’t think the butter was necessary.  Other reviewers suggested adding a 1/2 cup of milk, I’m glad I did, as it kept the dish from drying out.  Thanks for sharing!

This is by far the best mac and cheese recipe that I have tried and I have tried quite a few. This is really, really good. I followed this recipe pretty much as written but I did leave off the bread crumbs, I did not feel the need for them. Everyone loved this, I will definitely make this again and again.

This was a big hit with my family.  It is also easy to double and the doubled amount fits nicely into a 9x13 casserole dish.  I will try this out on my extended family at this weekend's gathering.

Decadent! My kids didn't all love it -- but the adults did! One even said he wants it for his bday dinner. Served it with Ahi Tuna steaks and steamed broccoli, simple and light to balance this rich side dish.  I did add a bit of finely chopped onion, cayenne pepper, and mustard, just to sharpen the flavors a bit.  I used whole grain crackers for the crumbs, which worked wonderfully.

I had been craving home made mac and cheese for a few weeks and finally gave in and decided to make it. I came across this recipe and I am SO happy I decided on this one!! I did make a few small modifications for my own tastes: I added about 1/2 cup of peas, I chopped and sauteed one leek with a bit of garlic in EVOO and added that to the mixture at the end which tasted awesome in my opinion! I also subbed in one 12oz block of firm tofu for the cottage cheese because I had some on hand that i wanted to use up and I think that it worked quite well for the consistency. Definitely cut the bread crumbs down to about a 1/4 cup. 

I can't wait to make this again!

great recipe!

a little runny at first, needed to sit for a little while - i used half the bread crumbs/butter mix as told, but i think next time i'd like to add 3/4 of it instead.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. The only modification that I make is to add a bit more sour cream, use very high quality white cheddar cheese and parm, and bake it a bit shorter since I am in a dry climate at high altitude. This recipe is a favorite of every person I make it for.

Great, but too many bread crumbs.  Next time I'll use a smaller and deeper pan (than a 9x13) and fewer bread crumbs.

My family and I thought this recipe was just wonderful. I did take the other reviewers advice and added 1/2 cup of milk before baking. Don't get grossed out because the recipe calls for cottage cheese--it adds nice body to this dish. This is my new Thanksgiving mac and cheese recipe!

Yummy! A flavorful mac & cheese and very easy to make.  I added a few pressed garlic cloves to spice it up a bit.  Next time I will probably omit the bread crumbs out of personal preference.

Loved this! So good...my fiance is a big kid and loves mac and cheese so I wanted to make a more "gourmet" version if you will. Added precooked sausage to it and used broken Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. My fiance can't stand cottage cheese and i had to tell him after he devoured it that it had it in the dish. Next time i'll use less noodles, i used 24oz, but i still think 8oz is too little. Will make again!

Great mac and cheese.  However, I used a whole 16 oz box of elbow noodles and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  8 oz of noodles seemed wrong and wasn't enough to cover a 9x13 dish.  I also used crunched up corn flakes instead of bread crumbs because we were out of bread.  Mac and cheese was very good. So much better than the recipes made with "processed cheese food"!!

I've been making this recipe for a few years and it really is a favorite of everyone I've made it for! Those that said it was dry probably used a whole box (16 oz) of elbows instead of 8 oz. I actually did that the first time I made it. If you make as directed it's really perfect!

While this wasn't the very best mac and cheese I've ever had, I thought it was so quick and SUPER easy, and it was really delicious.  I added a little paprika and garlic powder, and accidently bought italian seasoned bread crumbs at the grocery store (turned out good though), but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I only got to have a small bowl of the finished product before the rest was devoured by my fiance and his son.  The 14 year old has already requested it again, and it's only been a day!

Awesome mac and cheese recipe...very rich and flavorful.  I followed the advice of other testers and decreased the amount of bread crumbs & butter used for topping to only 1/4 cup and also added 1/2 cup milk to make it creamy.

This is a fantastic Mac & Cheese recipe!!!  I always have requests for this dish, even from picky eaters.  The cottage cheese secretly lends to the light, almost fluffy, consistency.  Don't let the cottage cheese scare you away; you cannot even taste it in the dish!  I use light ingredients and could eat this everyday!

This is a simple MAC & CHEESE that turns out great every time I make it. My 3 year old just loves it. I also put in some parsley, about two table spoons to give it extra flavor.

This receipe became an instant family favorite.  I did add two eggs to keep it moist and used Italian bread crumbs.  I also ofter substitue ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.

SOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!! Wow, that was great, my husband said it was quite possibly the best thing I've ever made.  That said, next time I will only use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs on top, I might use the other 1/2 cup mixed in.

Made this for MY birthday and it was to DIE for!!! Oh my!! I didn't change a thing and we loved it. Hubby said the breadcrumb topping made the dish taste like grilled cheese which is his number 2 favorite after mac and cheese ... so I guess this one is a keeper :)

LOVE IT! But, no need for so much bread crumbs. That is the only thing that needs to change.

Exceptional mac 'n cheese! I took the advice of others and added some milk, plus some onions and topped with tomatoes.  Yummy! UPDATE: I tried to make this healthier and made it per the recipe, but substituted whole grain macaroni; fat free plain yogurt in place of the sour cream; and Smart Balance in place of the butter. Still SOOOO yummy...both of my kids ate it right up!

Great for a "lighter" mac n cheese. If you're looking for a sharp, more adult mac n cheese, I don't recommend this one. I served this for company and everyone liked it a lot - kid friendly. Good sauce to pasta ratio. I like a sharper, richer sauce but I would make this again.

This is a keeper! I doubled the recipe to fill a 9x13 casserole dish. I was leary of the cottage cheese (not a fan) but left it in thinking it may be a crucial part of the flavor (though I did run it through a food processor first to eliminate chunks of cottage cheese). This is delicious mac & cheese. A cup of bread crumbs is way too much - it detracts from the flavor of the dish, so next time, I'll only use 1/3 of a cup of bread crumbs. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is the best!! Just follow the recipe as written and it is perfect. There is only two of us here in the house and it took us two (2) days to eat it all; but it was as good on the last day as it was on the first day. Excellent; and thank you for sharing!!!!

I love mac & cheese and I think I've tried about a billion recipes, but this was a total winner.  My BF and I were both in heaven.  I wasn't sure about the cottage cheese but I couldn't even really tell it was in there.  The only changes I made were using low fat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream (an attempt to make it "healthier").  And I browned a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs (1 C. would have been a lot) in 2 T. of butter.   I didn't think it needed milk.  It was great.

I made this as directed but didn't do the breadcrumb topping.  It was great!  I didn't add the milk and didn't find it dry at all.  It was FABULOUS reheated the next day.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in less than 24 hours (family of 4, kids 3 and 19 mos).  I might blend the cottage cheese next time before mixing it in.  Even though I used the small curd, you could still see the curds.  This was the best mac and cheese i've ever made - and i'm trying to find a recipe to use over and over and right now this is it!

Very good, very solid homemade mac and cheese recipe. We did as others have said and added a cup of milk and halved the breadcrumbs, and it was great. Nice, comfort food, a little bit of kick with the sharp cheddar and sour cream but not so much as to offend picky eaters. Just a nice, solid, homemade tasting mac and cheese.

The whole family loved this!  I did follow some advice from previous reviewers: less sour cream, added 1/2 cup milk, and less breadcrumbs and butter because the children prefer no topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good Mac and Cheese.  I followed one  person's suggestion and added finely chopped onions and frozen peas.  Next time I will sautee the onions in butter and add milk because it was a little dry.  Plus I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes after putting in the extra ingredients.  This recipe tastes even better the next day.

Wonderful taste! I doubled the recipe using 1 lb long macaroni, cooked it until soft (i.e. longer than the package recommended boiling time), added 1/2cup milk to the cheese mix. Came out perfect and not dry at all.

Love this recipe with some added milk.  Recently made a HUGE batch and wanted to let you know that it freezes really well!  I mixed it up, and wrapped it up.  Topped with the breadcrumbs once I was ready to cook it.  I cooked one from thawed and anothe one from frozen.  Great results either way.

VERY GOOD.  I didn't use butter for the bread crumbs though. I used olive oil and it was very tasty.  Almost left the bread crumb topping off , glad I did add the breadcrumbs. Will be making this again. Nice, easy tasty recipe.

Three & A Half Stars...AFTER I put some Cholula Hot Sauce on top of it.  Made as written, with the addition of a bit of garlic powder and shorting the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup, as suggested.  The sour cream was a bit overpowering, so if I were to make this again, I'd cut it down.  The kids went wild for it, however.

This is now my family's favorite Mac & Cheese recipe. I did add milk as suggested and it was not dry or bland. Instead of the breadcrumb topping I used leftover grilled cheese sandwiches that I placed in the food processer and pulsed until crumbly. Sprinkled on top before baking. Tasted great!

More like a cheesy pasta casserole. Good.  Add about a cup of milk and greatly reduce the breadcrumbs.

I made this for something different to take to Christmas dinner.  It was a hit.  I did add a 1/2 cup of milk as another reviewer mentioned.  Next time I will probably add more milk and cheese.

I was really hoping to love this recipe as it smelled fantastic.  My husband came into the kitchen and was standing next to the oven waiting for me to take it out, that's how good it smells.  I made the recipe exactly as posted.  There wasn't much of a sauce and it was very bland.  I added more cheese and it was still very bland.  I'm guessing that came from the cottage cheese and sour cream.  Will definitely not be making again.  Sorry Chuck.

This was the best homemade mac & cheese I have every tasted!  The cottage cheese gave it a unique flavor!  I used the packaged shells that came in an assortment of shapes for variety!  The bomb!  Loved it.

Amazing.  Not only does it taste good but it's super easy.  I didn't change a thing other than using low fat everything and it still tasted great!

This was my first attempt at making mac n cheese from scratch and it was a hit! Instead of cottage cheese I used Skim Ricotta and I added 1/2 cup of milk. I used of mixture of cheddar and colby jack plus some parmesan. I did reduce the bread crumbs as well since I used a 9x9 square pan. I don't think my husband will be happy with box mac n cheese now!

I have heard from several of my family and friends that this is the best mac & cheese they had ever had. I too think that this is the best. I have used crushed corn flakes when I was out of bread crumbs and it works well.

I reduced breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup, added a 1/2 cup milk, and added a couple large spoonfuls of ricotta since I didn't have cottage cheese.  I also reduced sour cream to 1/2 a cup.  It turned out really yummy, light and creamy-- tasty not tangy.

The *best* macaroni and cheese I've ever had. 

This is the first time I've made macaroni and cheese, and I'm sticking with this recipe. I did have a few variations:
I used 16oz of rigatoni instead of 8oz of macaroni.
I added 8oz of monterey jack cheese.

I doubled the recipe for my son's 2nd birthday party.  It fed about 25 people and we still had leftovers.  Everyone loved it!  I actually added extra shredded cheese and left out the bread crumbs and butter topping.  I loved the cottage cheese and sourcream.  The texture was just fine.  I will probably always make mac and cheese this way instead of the box.

This was awesome! i made it for a labor day BBQ and the boys devoured it in under 10 minutes. I added about a half cup of skim milk, b/c i was worried it would be dry since i was reheating it when i got to the party, and it was the perfect consistency. Will def make again since i only had two bites before it was gone!

I am giving this 5 stars even though I did things a little differently.  I didn't have sour cream so didn't use that.  To the rest of the basic recipe, I added 4 finely chopped scallions including the green part, 1 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, 4 or 5 shakes of green tobasco, about 1 cup parmesan freshly grated and a cup of cottage cheese.  I added about a cup of milk. I then sprinkled about 2 TBSP. Ital breadcrumbs on top, and shook some pre made parmesan over that then sprayed with butter pam.  This came out spectacular.  The best mac and cheese I've ever made and I've tried lots of recipes. Thank You!!!

I was disappointed with this dish. I even followed various suggestions (more milk, no breadcrumbs, paprika, ground mustard), but it was dry and bland.  If you want a cheesy dish, this is not it. My husband's tip was "to find a better recipe". It was worth a try though, esp with so many fabulous reviews.

Served this as a side last night for dinner. Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!  We all enjoyed it.  I took advise from other reviews.  Added 1/2 cup of milk and did not use all of the bread crumbs.  My mother wanted to doctor it some, so we cut the sharp cheddar in half and added velvetta to make up for it.  We also had a little bit of fresh mozzerela on hand so we added a few chunks of that.  It was soooooooo delicious, everyone loved it. A real keeper!

Excellent flavor. Reminds me of my great aunt's homemade mac. cheese  Texture was a little bit different than the regular creamy macs. Either way was quite good for my first time making this. I might make a couple experimental changes next time but overall this is a good base recipe. Who knows maybe I just need to use a higher fat cottage cheese. I will definitely be trying this again. Thank you.

This is absolutely delicious...and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like homemade mac & cheese!  Made this for a party and got RAVE reviews - I was asked for the recipe by several people.  I did add a 1/2 cup of milk to make it creamier.  This was great!!!

This is so yummy! And it's easy to prepare. I had some leftover mozzerella so I dumped that in with the other cheeses. It was creamy and the perfect comfort food.

This Mac N Cheese is amazing. I make it regularly. I have even made it for guests (who have been over a few times before for dinner) and although skeptical when they hear we're having Macaroni & Cheese for dinner, they are amazed and awed when they taste it. So am I. Mmm. Downside of this is it's so good 3 people can finish off the whole casserole in one sitting. Mmm. Cheese.

Had a group over to my house, and trust me, I just don't have company often.  This is a favorite amongst the kids though, so I decided to go with it with the company.

Two of the "guests" are very picky eaters, and they both agreed that this is one unique decent mac and cheese.  Its in the recipe box and it'll be a regular family meal.  Thanks!

I liked this recipe. Although I did tweak it a bit. I added a can of Cheese soup, and doubled the shredded cheese. I'm from Wisconsin! I also used low fat sour cream, and cottage cheese. After those additions its delicious. I make this at least every other week

Very cheesy, but I added even more cheese and added milk to make it more creamy. Next time I might try using heavy cream to make it even creamier. Tastes great with whole wheat rigatoni!

I love homemade macaroni and cheese, but this was kind of strange tasting (I think it was the cottage cheese).
Three stars because my husband liked it. 
I probably won't make this again, though.

I love this recipe!!  I had never made mac n cheese unless it came from a blue box.  This tasted great and I really liked the bread crumbs! Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was absolutely delicious!  However, I think next time I will prepare it without the breadcrumb topping...just a preference.  When I take out the breadcrumb topping, I will probably add 1/2 cup of milk as others said they did, because I imagine without the breadcrumb topping holding the moisture in, it could become a little dry.  Also, I agree with Amy D., better to mix in bowl, and then place in the baking pan because it's easier to mix up.  I really did love it though.  Very tasty!!

I made this for the first time with no tinkering and it was excellent! I thought the consistency was fine and the taste yummy. It is simple to put together as well. I have a pot luck dinner in a few days and this will be my contribution!

Maybe not fair of me to rate the recipe as I made a few changes.  I added some milk like other reviewers suggested, and also added some broccoli and cauliflower.  I think I'll serve the veggies on the side next time and stick to just pasta with the cheese sauce.  It tasted great but was not crazy about the consistency... but this will improve with the veggies removed I'm sure.

Really good - only thing I would suggest is to mix the macaroni and cheeses in a large mixing bowl, then pour into the baking pan. After adding everything, it was kind of hard to mix well without losing ingrediants!

I took the advise of some and added a half cup of milk to recipee, and it was delicious, not dry as others stated.  They may have used too much pasta, be sure you only use 8 oz per recipee, a typical box is 16 oz.  My picky boys, ate it right up, I added the bread crumbs, only half, and they made the dish I think, sprinkled with a little ceyenne pepper. Will Make Again and Again,. thanks!!

Really yummy! I added some ground mustard, hot sauce, and minced onion for some added flavor. I also cut the bread crumb mix in half and that was more than enough. The whole family loved it and it is really quick and easy.

This was really good, but (as usual) I tweaked it a little after trying it the first time. I reduced the sour cream and added more cheddar and a little milk. My husband loved it! Delicious comfort food-thanks!

This wasn't very creamy and there was way too much bread crumbs on top.  The flavor was good, but dry. I won't make it again.

We added more sour cream and more cottage cheese to this recipe to make it moist. We also use crushed potato chips and bread crumbs on top. It is ymmy.

This was good, but it does have a very "sharp" taste. I thought it was the sharp cheddar, so the second time I made it, I used mild. Still tasted sharp, so it must be the sour cream. If you want a milder taste, maybe use less sour cream and mix in some milk or something. My husband and I liked it, but it was strong for my son.
Edited to add: The day after, this is even better. The flavor really mellows, and the leftovers are perfect.

This is a very good recipe our whole family likes a lot. I make it a few times a month.  Its very rich and filling even though I normally use light or non-fat cottage cheese  and sour cream.  I've tossed in other shredded cheeses sometimes depending on what we have on hand.  I've spiced it up with jalapeno jack and a can of diced chiles.  I love the topping and one time used crushed croutons.  That was real good too.  Thanks

Well, this was certainly different... I was expecting more of a traditional mac and cheese with a slightly stronger flavor, and while the flavor was very strong I dont really like sour cream at all... I was expecting it to blend in more with the other cheeses but when it was finished all I could taste was sour cream... I gave it a 2 not out of personal preference, but for the fact that the flavors did not meld together, and the finished product was more sour-creamy than cheesy

Fabulous.  I made exactly as directed and it was *wonderful*.  My kids weren't thrilled the first day(I think they were expecting Kraft dinner), but as leftovers, they gobbled it up.  Outstanding!

I can eat this everyday (will at least every week).  I served it at playgroup and the moms and kids ate it up.  One child asked for thirds!  I will make this again, although my 3 year old didn't care for it (he was the only one - but he only likes Kraft Mac and Cheese).  I didn't change a thing.

"Great mac and chee, Mom." That was my kid's comment. I agree. I used Dreamfields macaroni (low carb) and ate guilt free. Of course I left off the breadcrumbs, and didn't miss them a bit!

This recipe was awesome!  My husband is pretty picky, and he LOVED it.  I would put a little less cottage cheese and add a little more chedder, but that's about it!  Otherwise, this recipe is the best.  We'll defintely make it again.

Thanks to this recipe I am now the assigned macaroni maker for all family gatherings.  We absolutely love it!  I did use 2 cups cottage cheese and omitted the bread crumbs because we like it nice and moist.  It has a nice tangy flavor with the sour cream and sharp cheddar that you don't get in most macaroni recipes.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe; it was so simple and tasted great.  I used fat-free sour cream and cottage cheese, and the recipe still turned out well.  The addition of either garlic salt or seasoned salt adds a nice flavor.

For all the rave reviews, I thought my family and I would like this better.  It tasted o.k. but we all agreed that there is way too much breading on top.  Cutting it back by at least 1/2 would probably help.  I cut out the salt since there is so much in all the cheeses already.

Like several other people said, this was a good mac and cheese, but not a show stopper. I didn't have any sour cream so I used half and half with a teaspoon of dijon mustard instead. I also added browned chicken breasts to the top to make a complete meal. It was SO easy, that I will make it again, but not for the special occasions.

I love all the cheese in this recipe.  The cottage cheese adds a good lower fat protein to the dish.  And it's even better warmed up later.  I don't think I'll ever make another mac n cheese again.

I use to eat this in elementry school! Much better than plain mac & cheese! Very easy and quick to make (HINT: Buy already shredded cheese!) Very tasty even if you use low fat sour cream and cottage cheese!!!!

I found this recipe to be really bland. It was fast and easy but not very tasty. Maybe alot more cheddar cheese is the answer...

This recipe didn't really have the flavour of traditional Macoroni & cheese, but was quick and easy to prepare.  Not a favourite, but an experience nonetheless.

Good recipe and quick to make. I added some grated Velveetaa cheese for a little extra cheesiness. 
Breadcrumbs on top made for good crunch

I've been making my own recipe of homemade mac 'n' cheese for about 10 years now with nothing but compliments and AMAZING results. I decided to "try something new" and try a different recipe to mix things up a bit and I'm very sorry I did. NOT EVEN CLOSE. I'm sure some may love it but it just wasn't for us. I gave it 2 stars because it was edible but that's about it. 

P.S. I very rarely leave a review on recipes. It has to be pretty darn impressive or very bad to get me to come yap about it. ;)

Not bad..I'm on the fence between 3 and 4 stars...it had good creaminess.  I think I'd like it better with more (or different) cheeses.

I have made this dish a dozen times. It's creamy. It's flavorful. It's just a great dish. I guess if you want runny macaroni and cheese soup it might not be for you. But I'm a nut for baked mac and cheese and this is THE recipe!

This is my go-to Mac & cheese. I make it for potlucks and Thanksgiving every year and always get rave reviews and requests to make it again. I do equal parts butter/breadcrumbs (1/4 cup each) and that is plenty. I make the cheese mixture the night before so that all the flavors can meld together and stir in the half cup of milk (as suggested by another reviewer) when I add the cooked noodles the next day. I also always add a little extra salt at this point as well, because of the milk. I taste everything right before it goes in the oven to check for salt/pepper. Fail proof! So good.

Easy to make.  Everyone likes it.  Expect to make it often. Have added onion, garlic, mushroom.  Used Panko and chopped pecans to make extra crunchy buttery topping.

I recently tried this Mac n Cheese recipe and enjoyed it very much.
I did make 3 minor adjustments though.
I used sour cream onion dip instead of plain sour cream.  I added 1 Tbs. of Dijon mustard and added a handful of crushed Salt & Vinegar potato chips into the buttered bread crumbs.

I made this recipe for my daughter’s volleyball team and they loved it. I did substitute cottage cheese with ricotta and did add half cup of milk. Instead of bread crumbs I topped it off with more cheddar. The first time I made it I used an entire 16oz box of elbow macaroni and it came out dry. The second time I made I used the 8oz the recipe call for and it was awesome.

This recipe similar to one that came from either WW or Cookinglight  I had been searching for.    I added a package of Normandy frozen vegetables.  I don't add the bread crumbs but I made it for someone recently with panko bread crumbs and butter,  adds to the calories.

After reading many reviews, I was anticipating a delicious dinner. Sorry to say I was sadly disappointed. I also applied the suggestion from many to add milk, as it was dry without the additions liquid. The texture was clumpy, even though I cut back on the cottage cheese, and used my immersion blender to smooth it out prior to mixing. I have been cooking for over 40 years, and am considered to be a great cook. Perhaps the fact that I am from New England has affected my opinion. I have never had mac and cheese with cottage cheese as an ingredient. Mac and cheese in this area has an abundant and creamy sauce. I made it two days ago, and the leftovers haven’t been touched by anyone in my family. A sure sign that this was not a hit at this kitchen. Even two stars is generous.

Made this low carb by replacing the noodles with layers of sautéed red pepper and zucchini. Replaced the bread crumbs with crushed pork rinds. It was a hit!

This recipe was very tasty with a lot of flavor. I had a lot of bread crumbs left over so maybe use 1/4 or 1/2 cup. That was the only issue,  other than that it was delish! Will definitely make again.

Love love love this mac&cheese! I don't add bread crumbs to mine because I think that's strange but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. Don't leave out the cottage cheese! It's always the hit of the party in its ooey gooey cheesy goodness. I also like to take this camping with me. Prep it like normal, add additional milk to keep it moist and throw it in a couple gallon ziplock bags. When you're ready to cook, throw your pasta in a foil pie pan (don't forget to grease!!) wrapped with foil and throw it on the fire. Yum yum yum!!

This is the recipe I've been looking for. The flavour and texture were fantastic. The only change I made was adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk to make it a little more creamy. I also didn't add the bread crumb top because my kids don't like it.

Fantastic mac and cheese.  I modified to double the batch more or less.  I agree with others that this needs a LOT more liquid than it calls for if you want it creamy.  Of course how liquid or not you want it is subjective.  I probably used half the cottage cheese called for, and subbed in quesadilla cheese (very mild, off white Mexican cheese, shredded - found in Wal-mart and IMO THE best shredded cheese on the market for any Mexican or Tex-Mex dish you make).  I also reduced the bread crumbs a bit per other reviews.   Mac and Cheese is hard to mess up, but I've made quite a few and this one by far was best (including slow cooker mac and cheese recipe on here, which had my previous top spot).   Fantastic recipe!   Thanks OP.

Great way to use unusual ingredients to make a common entree!  It was a hit!  Nice twist with a different consistency.  I used mild cheddar since that's what I had, and 1 cup panko for the bread crumbs, again, because that's what I had on hand, which worked actually better than I thought it would but I was up for an experiment and it all worked out well!

We made this and served it with the Boilermaker Tailgate Chili recipe - it was a huge hit!  Kids and adults all loved it!  Super easy to prepare before and then just pop in the oven to cook when ready!

So. Good. I've made it like 10 times. I mix up the cheeses every time and every time it's good. Favorite is to use half jalapeno cheddar. Add some milk before baking to keep moist.

Absolutely awesome!  I double the recipe and bake it in an 8x8" glass pan for 30 minutes.  I first made this to take to a potluck and everyone asked for a copy of the recipe.  The last potluck I took something different and everyone was remarking that they wish that I had brought this along instead.  Even a favourite among my teen sons, one of who remarked that it was okay but quickly finished off the pan...

I doubled and followed the recipe and used some of the suggestions I found in the reviews.  I used regular sharp and regular parmesan cheeses, low fat cottage cheese, low fat sour cream, and I added 3/4 C skim milk and a few dashes cayenne pepper.  I used 1/4 C melted butter mixed with 1 C panko bread crumbs for the topping.  Everybody loved it, and I sent the recipe out to two friends.  It mades a hearty 9x13 and 8x8 pans.  Thank you Chuck.

Not my favourite.   I have definitely tried better recipes.  This was a little bland and I wasn't fond of the cottage curds.

I have been making this Mac and cheese for years and it is always a hit among kids and adults. I leave the bread crumbs off completely. I mix cheddar cheese and a little Parmesan cheese with the noodle mixture. On the top, I sprinkle a thin layer of Parmesan cheese which gives it a super cheesy texture and dramatic look when you cut into the meal. Add freshly grated cheddar cheese to the top to cover. 

Easy and perfect every time!!

Nobody in the house cared for it.  The cottage cheese doesn't melt down and while I absolutely love sour cream, this recipe has such a terrible flavor.

Made 2 batches: 1 with cut up chicken breast. Added almost 1/2 cup milk to each batch. Used 1:2 c- 3/4 cup oatmeal not breadcrumbs and 1/4 c butter, not 1/2. Was delicious! Used food processor to grate cheese, much easier than by hand. Definitely will make this again. Thanks for recipe!

Any of “Chuck’s” recipes I’ve ever tried are always great. Even though I usually tweak the recipes for our own personal taste, the original recipes are always superb as well! For this recipe, I usually make it with low-fat dairy, whole grain pasta, and add some spices, veggies, and a protein for a complete meal!

The first time I made it, I followed the instructions exactly, and it turned out wonderfully. I recently made it again with an addition of bacon, which also turned out great. Next time I make it, I’ll still use the bacon, although I think a little less of it, but I’ll also substitute extra sharp cheddar for the sharp cheddar as the bacon overpowered the cheese a bit. Still a fantastic recipe either way.

The kids really didn't like the topping - it was messy and crumbly even after cooking, even though it looked like it would be crunchy.  The mac/cheese part was creamy due to the sour cream and cottage cheese, but this just messed with their idea of what mac and cheese should be like.  Keep this for the more refined palates, not the kids who just prefer a good simple mac and cheese.

Quick and easy to prepare. But it was too sour for my tastes. I will try making it again with less or no sour cream. Used panko and liked the crunch it added.

This dish was a big hit at our float building party and when I brought some to a sick friend. I believe that you should always make a recipe as written the first time. However, I needed to bake and take so I saw some reviews saying this ran on the dry side so I added some milk, maybe a 3/4 C to a tripled recipe. Next time I will try it as written. Thanks for the great recipe.

It wasn’t as creamy as I expected. Also I would have preferred mild cheddar cheese as opposed to sharp cheddar cheese. It wasn’t good at all as a leftover the next day.

Great recipe, I added a little Parmesan cheese to give it my own twist and it added a lot to the dish. If you are looking for a great main meal, one pound of lobster or shrimp mixed into the dish is also a great idea, crab as well, try all three, maybe.

I followed the recipe as written but doubled the ingredients for a large picnic. It was very good, moist, and flavorful. I did add some onion powder but otherwise stuck to the recipe. The kids all liked it too. This was by no means “gross” as one reviewer stated. If you don’t  like something just say you didn’t. Insults aren’t necessary. I will definitely make this again. The sour cream and cottage cheese definitely make the difference with this dish. I’m not a fan of cottage cheese but it was really good in this recipe.

COOK THE PASTA FIRST!  The recipe doesn't mention that crucial step!  I used extra sour cream (because I had a bit extra on hand that needed to get used up).  Put cottage cheese and sour cream and parmesan in a blender to disguise the cottage cheese from my son.  Didn't have sharp cheddar - it would have been even better!   And I forgot salt and pepper - would have been a nice addition.  I am on a slow carb diet, so I replaced the bread crumbs on top with some extra cheese, which turned out delicious!

I can’t figure out why so many people like this so much. I made it exactly as the recipe says. My six kids ranging from 3-14 hated it. I gave it two stars because I thought it was okay. I’ll never make it again.

Yes! This is it! I doubled the recipe and used shells instead of macaroni. Used a stick blender on the cottage cheese so the curds didn't give away this ingredient. Next time try adding one-third to one-half cup of milk so the leftovers are not so dry. I sprinkled panko over the top and then sprayed with spray butter. Broil for a few minutes to get a crispy top.

Loved this!!!  Only thing I did differently was I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, undrained.  Next time I may cut the amount of bread crumbs on top in half, got a tad grainy.

I'm very particular about mac n cheese. I hate ordering it at a restaurant. If it's homemade, I'm more likely to try it. This is my absolute favorite! I made it for a barbecue and my family requests it now. The only adjustment I made was no topping. Everything else was made according to the recipe.

This is SO easy!  Easy to have the ingredients on hand and quick to make. I add about a cup of ham (leftovers I have frozen in one cup bags so they are ready to go). Ultimate comfort food! You gotta try it!!

This was good.  I added red pepper flakes and might add more of the spices recommended by other reviewers to kick it up a notch.  I used 3/4 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup shredded parm on top.

Through a series of events, I ended up with way too much cheese that needed to be used and looking for a way to 'offload it on my coworkers'. I decided this recipe could handle the load, even though I myself am not a mac & cheese fan and had never made any variation of the dish before. The only problem I faced with this recipe is that apparently I did not make enough. Those who got to try it first immediately determined they needed second helpings and, as a result, I have been on the receiving end of some disdainful looks from my slower coworkers all afternoon.
The slight variations I made were using medium shell pasta instead of elbow, adding some Colby jack cheese, a bit of cream cheese, more white cheddar, ½ cup of milk and only ¼ cup of seasoned panko breadcrumbs (per other users' suggestions). Also, I may not have measured everything correctly, as it was a mad dash to fit this into my morning routine – easy as it is. To conclude, I will definitely be making this again, and the only things I would change are making at least double the amount, and maybe ½ cup of the breadcrumbs instead of a ¼. Did I mention I had a second helping myself? Oh well, you can’t please everybody. Sadly, there was no time for a picture.

Made this the past two thanksgivings and it NEVER disappoints. I keep it the recipe mostly stock with the exception of low sodium cottage cheese and I do half cheddar and half gruyere. Very good indeed!

I pride myself on being a very good cook. That is why I was thoroughly disappointed with how this turned out. Globby cheese, not enough flavor and poor consistency added to my displeasure. I will not be making this again.

I made this for dinner and my family loved it. Next time I will replace the buttered bread crumbs with crushed buttered Ritz Crackers for a little crunch. Otherwise, I would not change a thing. This is a keeper. The recipe served three people and we had enough left over for two small lunch portions the next day.

This has become my go to Mac & cheese recipe over the past few years. Love it! 
Suggestions:
Bypass breadcrumb topping (based on personal preference).
Add some Swiss cheese
After mixing ingredients, add some milk to moisten it up (eyeball it).

This is  the only mac and cheese I make, I have been making it for a while now!  It's everyone's favorite!  I never put the bread crumbs on the top only because I don't like toppings on mac and cheese--I just sprinkle a light amount of shredded cheese as a topping.  Regardless, this recipe is amazing!!!!!

Yum.  Turned out great.  I had to add 1/2 milk as it was too thick to stir.  Could have been because I grated the cheddar and didn't use shredded.  I didn't have breadcrumbs and used ritz crackers on the top.

I love this Mac and cheese. The only thing I changed was the amount of bread crumbs. I use 1/3 of a cup instead of a cup. The flavor is excellent.

This was by far one of the easiest to make with the most flavor pay off! I am so used to making  mac and cheese with a bechamel sauce, now I dont have to! I mean granted this isnt as creamy BUT its more like a macaroni pie or bake! I used old cheddar and a ton of parmigean  cheese (make sure to use fresh parm) i also added some cayenne, you dont need much but its nice to cut the richness.  I ended up filling 2 9x13 pans!
oh and I didn't add the breadcrumb crust and it turned out just fine!

This is truly a phenomenal recipe!  I did not have cottage cheese to add, but I can imagine how it would compliment this dish. My husband loved it, and he never likes new dishes. Winner Winner! Thanks for sharing Chuck!

No, I didn't make any changes to the original recipe, although I'd used old or extra old cheese next time (all I had was medium).

Yes, I'd make it again.

TLDR; Keep looking if you want a creamy mac and cheese.  

I should state I'm one of those that wants creamy mac and cheese.  That being said, I had hopes for this highly rated recipe but I just don't get all the rave reviews.  The only thing I changed was adding a little milk so that it wouldn't come out dry.  It still came out dry and with a weird consistency. 

Not going to make this again and super disappointed I wasted all those ingredients.

I found this recipe years ago on a different website.  It has been a family recipe every since (I've since passed it down to my daughter)! Absolutely delicious!   We do add cheddar and mozzarella cheese but we like it cheese! This dish is always requested!

This is really good! It's better than any of the other recipes I have tried by far. Others mentioned adding milk, so I used 3/4 cup. A half cup would probably be better. My whole family liked it, and I will definitely make it again.

I don't like mac and cheese, so I didn't try that. That being said, none of my three kids enjoyed this and they love pasta.

My husband also didn't care for it. He said it was dry and lacking in cheesiness. ("All hope had left this dish")

My favorite Mac and Cheese! I followed the recipe exactly and was so pleased. I served it as a main dish. My husband wasn't quite so thrilled, he wanted meat. So the next time I make this as a main dish I plan to add some ham or bacon. We used left overs as a side dish and that was more to his liking.

It wasn't pretty tasty but needs a little more zest. Extra sharp cheddar maybe? I also ended up broiling the bread crumbs because they became soggy while cooking. Not sure why. Broiling gave it some nice crispy texture though.

i did not add the cottages cheese and just put shredded cheese instead of melting the cheese which is more time consuming,  the sour cream was good and I added evaporated milk as well. it came out very good

It could use double the pasta and half the breadcrumbs, but was deliciously cheesy and creamy regardless!

It was almost perfect just needed a little bit more flavour for my family so I added Parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the recipe. 
Everyone LOVED it. Even my pickiest eater.

Great recipe.  Very easy and very good.

The only change I would make is to use less bread crumbs.  Maybe 1/4 of a cup.

I loved this recipe. My late grandmother liked a firm mac and cheese and I know she also used cottage cheese in her recipe. When I say firm, I don't mean dry. This was firm with a sharp and smooth flavor and texture. If you like a mac and cheese with your cheese more saucy then no, this is not the recipe for you.

I left out the Breadcrumbs and butter the second time i made it. i also added bacon to it and left out the Parmesan.  now its basically not the same thing, but was a great base line. also i found by mixing ingredients in stand mixer (without noodles) for an extended time it smoothed out the cottage cheese curd and made a smoother texture while eating. was an easy bake for a guy who doesn't cook . i found it quite simple to make my daughter loved it andwe have had it several times now

Simple ingredients and great tasting.  My personal preference is to lighten up on the bread crumb topping.  Also, it's on the dry side so I would add either some cream to the mixture or butter on top.

I have made this so many times over the last 2 years, my family actually asks for it!. I always add a little more of all the cheeses to make it a little tastier & creamy. It's easy, simple ingredients and feeds many!

I've been making this for every pot luck dinner I attend for over a year now. It's absolutely delicious! I like to use Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.

I tend to like my mac n cheese a little on the saucy side and this dish was way too dry. Even after I added a 1/2 cup of milk like another reviewer suggested, the dish was still too dry. It also needs salt so if you're going to make this, be sure to salt the water to boil the elbows and salt the cheese mixture as well.

This recipe is not bad.  The mac and cheese came out thick.  I would have preferred a more cheesy mac and cheese. I wasn't sure what bread crumbs to use so I used the Garlic & Herb bread crumbs I have at home.  Next time, I will try to remember to use plain bread crumbs.  If not, the taste of the garlic & herb overpowers the mac and cheese dish.  Also I added a little too much salt by accident.  (My fault)  I'd make this again.  Since I added a little bit of milk like other reviewers mentioned, it was moist the next day.  Great for reheating.

Need to double up on everything but the bread crumbs and I think you'd be good to go! The taste is great but there is WAAAAY too much bread crumbs in each bite. More cheese and pasta would counter this.

EDIT: The longer I eat this the more I dislike it... it's probably because I eat healthy and this isn't healthy or nutritious. The crumbs definitely ruined it for me, so I'll probably leave them out the next time.

This is the easiest, tastiest mac & cheese ever!!!
I did one little change and added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the buttery bread crumbs. It was fabulous!
I will never do my old standard recipe again, way to much work!

Taste of the mac & cheese was good but the bread crumbs overpowered the dish. I ended up scraping off as much as I could before grabbing seconds. It tasted more like Mac  & cheese toast, which was not what my boyfriend and I wanted or expected. 
I picked this recipe because it has such high reviews and not as many changes in the first reviews listed. I wish I had used 1/4 the amount of breads crumbs & butter. Not sure I'll make this again :-/

I'm an experienced cook. Made it exactly as the recipe called for. Total flop. Dry and tasteless. Needs milk or butter and some seasoning. Will add things to spruce it up for leftovers. Won't make it again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some cottage cheese and sour cream I had... Never thought of Mac and cheese. Easy to make, tasted great... I added a can of diced fire roasted chilies for a little extra. I also took a pan to a sick friend, with great compliments. Thank you!!

Love this recipe!! I make this for all holidays and family gatherings and it is always a huge hit. I substitute the cheese for Colby jack and pepper jack so it has little kick to it, but the kids will still eat it. I also use more cheese than the recipe calls for and less bread crumbs. The recipe is great as is.

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.  I thought this recipe sounded really good, quick and easy.  It was way too easy and tasted like it too.  This was definitely NOT the creamy mac n cheese I was hoping for.  I guess I'll have to find a more traditional rue and 5 cheese mac n cheese to satisfy that craving.

This recipe wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't creamy. It actually was kind of lumpy with the small curd cottage cheese.  And a bit too dry with the amount of bread crumbs that it called for.  I would use less bread crumbs and use a smaller pan than called for so the mac n cheese would be thicker. 9 X 13 is too big for the amount of ingredients.

Off to find that creamy, cheesy mac n cheese that I long for ;-)

Amazing!! Doubled to bring to Thanksgiving dinner for 20. Was perfect size. Still fit in 9 by 13 casserole dish. Added about 1/2 cup milk and used butter and Ritz for topping. Baked for about 10 minutes more. Lots of compliments!!

This was good, but not great. I like my Mac and cheese to be REALLY cheesy.  I would make it again but with more cheddar and a little spice. The cottage cheese kept it moist and a great consistency that I wouldn't change.

I don't make mac n cheese usually, but decided to try it for dinner for the guests at the Hope Lodge along side country ribs and a green bean dish.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have enough cheddar cheese on hand so I added pepperjack cheese.  They thought it was the best mac n cheese they had ever had.  One man even said he is a mac n cheese lover and would have me cook for him any day.
This is a keeper as I had to feed 30 people.  Thank You

This recipe is great for people who are open to try new things, but is probably not good to people who are use to processed cheese or boxed Mac and cheese. I personally find it pretty good, I make it all the time!

This is a great recipe... an especially good "adult" mac n cheese.  I used Barilla Gluten Free Elbows and substituted crushed corn tortillas for the bread crumbs to make this gluten free, and I used 6 oz colby-jack, 1 oz sharp cheddar and 1 oz Jalapeno-pepper-jack cheeses instead of the 8 oz of cheddar, because that's what I had on hand. I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes which, along with the pepper jack cheese, kicked up the flavor a notch.  I sprayed my baking pan with Pam, and even though I mixed the ingredients right in the baking pan, it did not stick.  The cottage cheese did not melt together with the rest of the cheese and sour cream, and the little pieces of cottage cheese were clearly visible in the finished product.  While it's not what I was going for, I'm glad it came out this way because it added a nice texture to the dish.

I have EVERYONE begging me for this recipe! 
I love how easy it is to adjust the portions up or down. 
I usually add 1/4 cup of milk at the suggestion of other reviewers, it truly does keep the leftovers moist the next few days (If it lasts that long!)
I also grate (not chop!) about 1/3 of a small yellow onion into the mix as well as add bacon (I found this recipe to be lacking in salt -- something I almost NEVER say but this trick adds both bacon and salt) a well as doubling the cheddar cheese (I usually use half old white and half extra old orange).

Mine and my husband's biggest compliant is that 1 full cup of bread crumbs was a bit much. Were I to make this again, I'd go with maybe half of that. The recipe tasted a bit sandy.

I made this recipe just as directed. It turned out great from a visual stand point. I wish I had read the reviews prior to preparation as the bread crumbs were just too much. My son usually gobbles up Mac and cheese and he asked me why I changed from my recipe. He thought the bread crumbs were a bad addition. He said he wouldn't eat again and don't save the leftovers for him.

I make this mac and cheese a lot for get-togethers, and it's always a hit.  I usually double the recipe and top the casserole with crumbled Ritz crackers instead of dried bread seasoning for a little sweetness.

Was really hoping this would be a good recipe, as most highly rated recipes are. Unfortunately, it was horrible clumply, terribly tasting, and disappointing.

-- I make this for every holiday, birthday party, and get together. I never have leftovers.  There are a few things I do differently. First and foremost, make this in the crockpot!!! The cheese melts better and more thoroughly than in the oven. Second, forget the breadcrumbs. Third, add more sour cream and substitute cottage cheese for cream cheese. Finally, add milk.

This recipe is confusing.  It says to use an 8oz package of elbow macaroni, but the regular size of elbow macaroni is 16oz.  I made it with the 16oz box and it came out delicious, but no idea if that was right or if I made it with twice as many noodles as I should.

I made it almost exactly according to the directions.  I was surprised that it didn't call for milk.  In fear of it turning out too dry,  I poured about 3/4 cup of milk over the top, before adding the breaded topping.  I also doubled the recipe.  I used aluminum foil while baking and removed it the last 5 minutes or so to kinda toast the top.   I didn't use all of the topping the recipe called for either.  It was just overkill for me.  I used all low-fat ingredients including the sour cream and cottage cheese and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it!

I did like someone else said and blended the sour cream and cottage cheese in blender so no one could tell cottage cheese is in there.  I also did as people suggested and added an extra cup of milk.  Before baking it was really soupy and I thought maybe milk was too much, however, it was still a bit dry upon removing from the oven.  I received lots of compliments on it.

Alright alright alright (in my best Matthew McConaughey voice).  

Changes on my end:  I doubled the recipe, divided and baked in two 8x8 Pyrex dishes.   Omitted the Parmesan (but not on purpose) I haven't quite mastered the skill of texting and cooking.  Didn't add salt and didn't add pepper.

My children's taste buds are SO REFINED they know they don't like something before they've even tried it *eye roll* so I couldn't get feedback from them but thumbs up from the picky husband and my sweet (and brutally honest at times) mom.  Not dry AT ALL and I agree with another reviewer that people who are saying that might be dumping in a whole bag of noodles when it only calls for 8oz.

My leaving out the Parmesan probably cut back on the type of additional salt I wanted,  it was already really good but I bet it would have been even better had I not messed that up.   Hooray for homemade Mac & Cheese!!

DELICIOUS!!! The only things I changed were deleting  the bread crumb topping (I don't care for it) and adding a small amount of half and half - I live at high altitude and have learned to always add more than called for.  This is an absolute keeper!

My wife and I love mac and cheese.  I like to cook, trying new recipes is always fun on the weekends and this was the recipe to try this weekend based on the ratings of over 2,000 people.  This recipe did not disappoint, we loved it and the only change we would recommend is using a little less bread crumbs or a little more butter, for some reason the bread crumbs were too dry for us.  Otherwise, this is being added to our regular rotation of recipes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

All the different cheeses provide a wonderful mix of flavors. I did stir in a 1/2 cup of sautéed onions for added flavor.

The only change I made was adding canned bits of Jalapeno peppers. Yum! I think without them it may have been just "ok" as it lacks flavor.  Doesnt look the most appetizing with the cottage cheese, might have been more appealing with it puree'd before mixing with the noodles. I also opted to top it with cheese instead of the crumbs.

My husband LOVED this.  I made it with Ricotta instead of cottage and added half a cup of milk.  It's a dry recipe, but don't let that put you off... it's still very good.  For breakfast, my husband will fry a piece of this.

I liked this recipe, I added milk to keep it moist and left the pasta al dente so it cooked to perfect!  Next time I'm going to leave off the bread crumbs or drastically reduce the amount.  It distracted from the flavor.

It was definitely more time consuming than making a box of Kraft mac and cheese and I thought it didn't taste nearly as good. Just not a fan.

Delicious mac & cheese. Calls for way too much bread topping though. I cut the topping in half the second time I made it and plan to cut it to 1/4 next time.

I followed the recipe exactly for all measurements,   mine looked nothing like the picture, looked mostly white... Tasted even worse, like bread crumbs mixed with plain macaroni, couldn't taste the cheese at all. None of the cheese melted underneath the breadcrumbs and I baked it for a good 50 minutes, if you are going to make this recipe I suggest doubling or even tripling the cheese amounts in the ingredients.

Really good and easy! I used whole wheat pasta, and added a little half and half for moisture. Very tasty. We added a little chipotle salt for flavor, and I think next time I may just add a whole chipotle for something different.

I made it and thought it was great. I added a half cup of 2% milk, used lite ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and lite sour cream as suggested by many reviewers. I cooked it for 45 minutes before the top started to brown.  I probably could have used more salt and pepper but I still thought it turned out tasty. It wasn't "creamy" or "yellow" like a Kraft dinner type Mac and cheese which some people dig.  I would like it to be a bit creamier so I might try more milk next time. All in all a tasty success on the first try.

This is soo good.  Only subtle changes (mixed pepper jack cheese with the cheddar and Panko breadcrumbs for a crispier topping. )
I would never have thought to use sour cream and cottage cheese, but it really added a deliciously unique flavor
For those who want it a bit creamier, just add a little milk into the mixture before baking
Excellent recipe. Thankyou!!!

This is one of the VERY best side dishes I've made! I cannot wait to make it again. My husband and kidlet could not quit raving about it. I did eliminate the butter. I felt this would make it too greasy. What an easy and impressionable way to spice up a weekday dinner!

I love this recipe! The only changes I made was I added more butter (I am a butter junky) And I used large curd cottage cheese (it's all I had). So this recipe is stupid easy and tastes like a million bucks. My dad doesn't even like mac and cheese had two servings and then left overs. Thank you for posting this recipe. It's amazing!!!

Hubby and I are not M&C fans, but the rest of the family has been bugging for me to make it.  I made it as shown, and both my husband and I ate it up.  We still wouldnt have it as a main, but as a small side - kids liked it too.

This is my go to base for mac and cheese now! Some changes I make: omit the breadcrumbs for additional cheese that gets crispy and brown on top and use a mixture of sharp cheddar and smoked gouda.

This got rave reviews at a family Christmas dinner, I did blend the cottage cheese to make it smoother and skipped the bread crumb topping and just topped with cheese, note the recipe calls for 8oz of noodles not a full box.

My family and I loved this! I made exactly how the recipe says - the only change  made was used "garlic & herb" flavored bread crumbs which made it extra yummy.  Like other's have mentioned, if you are looking for a creamy gooey cheesy mac, keep it movin - that is not what this is.  I don't even like cottage cheese personally, but it is great in this recipe.  My husband and 2 teens ate all of it :) Will be making this again.

I love this recipe!  I make it all the time .  I typically add a few splashes of milk to it to make it creamier.  The last time I made it  I amped it up even more (for a thanksgiving pot luck at work) I added chopped jalapenos and fresh crumbled bacon.  The jalapenos mixed so well.  I got a lot of compliments at work... my supervisor even said it was "THE BOMB!"

I made this exactly as directed (I never really measure so I was just ball parking everything) and it was awesome! I'm not sure why some are saying they don't like it...to me it tastes like a classic macaroni and cheese! I will definitely make this again. Next time I would probably add in some meat like sausage or chicken. Yum!

Followed the exact directions and everything came out perfect. Let me say one thing, I hated mac and cheese until now. Never liked it, most recipes are dry and the crumbs on top remind me of dirt.. except for this one. I was so amazed by how good it was that I woke up the next day and ate it for breakfast, as well as made the neighbors try it and they loved it. My hubby wasn't a fan, for some reason we've switched spots about liking baked mac n cheese but this is amazing and I will keep the recipe around.

I have made this recipe numerous times and each time I get rave reviews. There are usually never any leftovers and if by some chance there are people are taking it to go! I do add some carnation milk to keep it moist. And sometimes I throw in a can of condensed cheddar soup or condensed tomato soup. Haven't tried it with bacon yet but oh I plan to! I sometimes also double my topping and use panko. This recipe is good as is but it's great to experiment with :)

I've made this multiple time and people are ALWAYS asking me for the recipe afterwards. I do tweak it here and there, sometimes I'll use full fat cheeses and creams, sometimes non-fat versions. If I am making it for my family I add some pepper flakes and garlic. You can doctor this us however you like and it will still be delicious.
EDIT: When making the breadcrumb topping, always use SALTED butter for a little extra flavor! I sprinkle extra cheese on top before putting it in the oven!
EDIT: This is still my go-to recipe. It's always a crowd pleaser, and it's easier to adjust the portion sizes. Making it for dinner again tonight.
If you don't like the base recipe, play around with it and find the balance of what you like best (different cheeses? My favorite is colby jack cheddar here).

This mac and cheese is fantastic! The leftovers are just as good too; something I can't say for any other baked mac and cheese recipe I've ever tried. I will be making this again and again and again...

I love this mac & cheese and so did everyone else. I did make some adjustments based on comments off other reviews. First off this recipe is for 8oz box I had to double everything for my family. When I doubled the recipe I added 3/4 cup of milk.In stead of using all cottage cheese I added half ricotta cheese and I added 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and 3 cups sharp cheddar  this made it creamy and stringy.  I left everything else as the recipe called for. This made it perfect for everyone it has great flavor but if your idea of mac & cheese comes in a box then you are not going to like this. I will make this again and may add things like bacon or even put some tomatoes on top I didn't put any bread crumbs or crackers on top because that's not how we like our mac & cheese

It was good, but kind of dry. I put chopped up bacon on top.  The bread crumbs weren't browning so I had to put it at the top of the oven and broil it for about 30 seconds.

This actually is pretty good.  I gave it 4 stars, since I thought it could be a little more flavorful. At the same time, I mixed the sharp cheddar with a mixed cheese bag of: sharp, mild and Vermont. Nonetheless, it was still really good. My husband ate half the pan, and my daughter loved it too.

We liked this recipe. We added more noodles than it called for to even out the cheese to noodle ratio. We added some fresh tomatoes and salt&pepper. So good. My husband who doesn't even like mac & cheese liked it!

After having made bland, boring macaroni and cheese for years, I tried this recipe and it was outstanding!  My husband and I loved it!  And I followed the recipe very loosely.  I didn't include the topping (b/c I don't care for crumbs in pasta) and I didn't measure any ingredients, but included them all to taste. I admit... I only glanced over the ingredients and went out to buy the different cheeses.  I didn't even realize the original recipe didn't call for milk.  I have always added milk to mac & cheese, so I poured evaporated milk into the pasta and cheese mixture, with one beaten egg and I melted it for moments on a low fire (which eliminated the issue with the curds of cottage cheese (I hate curd texture too).  My cheeses blended smoothly and wow, are we impressed!  The recipe was easy and nothing short of delicious (even followed loosely).  Thank you much Chuck, for sharing.

This is a really good, subtly a-typical mac n cheese. Much more flavor depth than your run-of-the-mill box mac n cheese but still mild enough to please the picky eaters. I made a double batch, half as-written, half with the addition of ham, mushrooms and peas--both were tasty but I definitely prefer the version with ham and veggies.

Turned out a little dry. Definitely will add something to make it creamier and cheesier, and less bread crumbs next time.

This is a really good mac and cheese recipe. I wasn't a really big fan of the bread crumbs but I think that is just a matter of taste. My mom did like the bread crumbs. Her only request was that I cut down on the amount that I put on top. This has gone to the top of my favorite mac and cheese recipes.

When I first mixed the ingredients together with the pasta I was skeptical, it looked different from every other mac n cheese i have seen or tasted. However, I trusted the reviews & I am so glad that I did because this recipe is on point! Instead of using the regular bread crumbs, though, I used cracker crumbs which worked just as well. I definitely recommend this recipe for any beginner cooks, or anyone that needs a quick dinner...it reheats well too! I am super picky about eating leftovers, but this tasted just as good every time.

Best mac & cheese recipe ever!  I made it even better by adding diced, leftover spiral ham, and adding some Loeb's Onion Crunch to the bread crumb mixture. I probably used more cheese than the recipe calls for, and it was a variety of what I had in the fridge - cheddar, monterey jack, colby, whatever.  I think the "secret" ingredients making this recipe awesome are the sour cream and cottage cheese. It was seriously off the charts, everyone loved it.

This is our go-to recipe.  Chuck's Mac shows up at nearly every big family event.   My kids are constantly requesting it for dinner.  

The one change is as another reviewer suggested:  replace bread crumbs with crushed Cheez-Its. 

And no, this is not a creamy Mac and cheese.  I would suggest it is more gourmet.  Simple but more grown up.

Very creamy, but really very bland.  I used small curd cottage cheese.  My family definitely identified the cottage cheese even after it was cooked.

I have a feeling this would have turned out a lot better if I hadn't used reduced fat cheddar and low fat sour cream. It came out super creamy but all I could taste was cottage cheese :( That's what I get for trying to cut even more fat from the recipe. Silly me. Luckily the boyfriend loved it regardless

Love this recipe.  I used about 12 oz of (gluten free) pasta, so added a little more cottage cheese.  It came in a 12oz container, so used the whole thing.  I'm making it again (2nd time in a week), but adding crumbled bacon! :)

As I'm making this recipe for the 2nd time, I thought it was a good time to review the first time.  This is a wonderful dish, the entire family enjoyed it.....the only think we didn't care for was the bread crumb topping.  Was easy enough to scoop off - but as I make it again, I plan on omitting the topping and making just the mac and cheese.

My 2yo son loved it! I used french fried onions and bacon bits as a topping instead of the buttery breadcrumbs. I will use less parm cheese next time and maybe make another change or 2 to make it creamier!

Just WOW! This was so different than any mac and cheese I have ever tried. I really loved the textures and flavors of all the different cheeses and the bread crumbs. The only thing I did different is that I added a shredded baked chicken breast so I could have some protein with all those carbs! Lol! This is a keeper!

When I first looked at this recipe, I scoffed at the dismissive negative review that said simply, "I'm sorry this was gross". Now that I've tried it, I'm starting to understand where beckyp382 is coming from.

There's a reason most macaroni and cheese recipes don't have sour cream and cottage cheese in them. Maybe if they were used as accents as opposed to 70% of the recipe, it would make more sense. This was soggy and not very tasty, except for the sour cream, which was all I could taste after a while. I had to stop mid-meal and eat something else.

Love this recipe.  I have a wheat allergy so I used my gluten free (bionaturae brand) noodles.  These are the only noodles to hold up
to any pasta dish.  I also added 1/2 diced onion and 6 slices thick
bacon. Both onion and bacon sauted together and added to the sauce. I leave the bread crumbs off all together.

I have been looking for a mac & cheese receip which did not use milk and eggs as a "custard" type when baked.  My husband commented after the first bite, "this sure ain't Kraft, but it's like going back to my childhood.  THIS is what mac & cheese is suppose to be"!!!!

I have used this recipe (with less breadcrumbs and the addition of about 1/2 cup of milk) many times now and it's a crowd favorite!  It's being requested again for yet another event, superbowl mac and cheese this time!! And with the addition of milk to the cheese mixture, the leftover's are never dry and always nice and creamy.  One other tip, when people ask why it's so good and what the ingredients are, don't tell them it's made with cottage cheese.  For some reason that seems to scare some people and they make sour faces at the thought of it.  Just leave that as the "secret ingredient."

5 stars! I make this all of the time now, it's one of my husband's favorites. I double the shredded cheese, and add roughly 1/4 cup of milk as per some of the reviewer's suggestions. I usually substitute crushed Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs, as we like their crunchy texture and buttery flavor. With these simple alterations, this dish is always a winner.

This was amazing!  I did add some freshly ground pepper and a little bit of nutmeg (per more traditional baked mac & cheese), and it was amazing!  I also used slightly stale garlic & parmesan french baguette (ground in our magic bullet) for the bread crumbs.  SOOOOO yummy!!  Even with fat free cottage cheese and low fat sour cream.

This mac & cheese was a hit for Thanksgiving dinner with my family. I used the other comments to make adjustments by adding milk. I also added butter to the noddles for extra richness and flavor. I made a full pan 11x18 and the whole pan was gone at the end of dinner.

Ok, I hate to be a downer but we didn't care for this at all. 
All I can say is that the cheese did not adhere to the pasta at all.  Oddly the cheese mixture was kind of custardy and was separate from the elbows. The cheese didn't soak into nor coat the pasta.  I did blend up the cottage cheese a bit to removed the lumps from the cottage cheese, but I don't see how that would affect the end product.

I loved it!  It is a must have to at least one of our holiday dinners.   I use Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and everyone who tries it always ask for the recipe!

I always get compliments on this.  I love it because it's so amazingly easy to put together and it's homemade with a homemade taste, perfect for potlucks.  I omit the breadcrumbs, the mac & cheese is awesome by itself.

Eh.  First time making homemade mac and cheese.  My husband seemed to like it, but it tasted like it was missing something, and I think I expected the breaded topping to get crunchy/crispy, so the texture disappointed me.  Not sure it's all the fault of the recipe, or maybe I'm just not really a homemade mac and cheese kind of gal.

This was delicious and super easy. I look forward to trying different variations of this. I was hesitant about using cottage cheese, but it just made the dish creamier.

This mac and cheese was just okay. It called for WAY too many bread crumbs. I felt like it also was missing a flavor. Overall it was decent. Not sure that I would make it again.

I've made this many times over the last couple of years and it's always a big hit. I've even added big slices of tomato under the breadcrumbs and it's delicious.
This last time, I made it the night before (except for breadcrumb layer) and it baked perfectly. Just need to make sure there's plenty of time to bring it up to room temperature before putting it in the oven.

I always get compliments on this dish as it has become my staple Thanksgiving contribution. I have not changed anything in the recipe, just added more cheese. Can't wait to try it again with a few of the suggestions I read here. This is the first time I have reviewed any recipe here and it is just because, I think it is that good! Try it!

When asked to prepare a side for Thanksgiving my daughter said why don't you make that mac and cheese you made that one time.. it was really good.  When I got the recipe out I saw it was 2009 when I made it. That is saying something when a kid remembers a dish after 3 years. I can't wait to make it again.  I am going to try the idea of  modifying it into a chicken recipe tonight.

This was okay.  I was hoping for it to be more ooey-gooey, like mac and cheese should be.  I liked the bread crumbs and the cottage cheese and sour cream in it.  It just needed more.

This is one of my favorite recipes I have ever gotten from this site.  I add a lot more cheese though.  I use a full package of spiral pasta (13oz) and add Mozz, and a bit of Mexican cheese.  I would say I add about 2 to two cups more of cheese.  I use all low fat everything and add a cup of low fat milk so the leftovers are not dry. I even made ti one time with Turkey Sausage and jalapenos and it was great. It tastes amazing also if you sub out all of the yellow cheeses for white ones and add pesto and chicken.  This is a fantastic   recipe to build off of.  I add something different each time.

I made a few changes with the recipe as suggested by others.  I skipped the crumb topping (toped with a very thin layer of cheddar instead). Doubled the recipe, used low fat everything, added 1 cup milk, half an onion chopped, 1 tsp dry mustard and 1 tsp smoked paprika, plenty of fresh ground black pepper, used "cork screw" pasta and some cubed ham (just because I had it) YUM!!!  Next time, I will blend the cottage cheese to rid of the clumps and NOT salt the noodles and no salt to the recipe.  It had plenty of salt from the cheese and ham.

I am giving this a 5 because I have adapted the recipe and made it even more fabulous. I make it about 3 times a year and everyone is always asking for more! I keep the recipe the same for the most part expect for these additions/subtractions - So given all of the suggestions I add 1/2 cup of milk (keeps it moist and not dried up), a jar of jalapeno cheese dip for an extra kick (it's not TOO spicy), a variety of cheeses (whatever's on sale or I go really fancy), and no bread crumbs (my personal preference).

Creamy and good. The cheddar cheese mixed with the sour cream adds a nice tangy flavor that is very good. This recipe is a keeper!!!! I didn't know what to think about adding the cottage cheese but it makes a huge difference.  I also added 1/4 cup of milk so that my mac and cheese wouldn't dry out.

The ONLY reason I didn't rate this a 5 star was because I made changes without trying the original. In stead of one cup of cheddar I mixed 1/2 of sharp cheddar with a 1/2 of gruyere cheese. I did not do the butter crumb crust I did however mix the bread crumbs with left over shredded cheddar and gruyere and sprinkled it over top. It was amazing! Thank you.

I took this dish to a play date and it was a huge hit, especially with the parents!  It is not your box brand and may be a little rich for the kids.  However, it is worth the effort to make from scratch.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing! New holiday favorite.  Splurge on good cheeses and lots of breadcrumbs!  Be patient while the cheese melts on low.  Rushing it will give you a grainy sauce.

Neither my hubs or I cared for this at all (sorry!). Not only was this an odd take on our favorite comfort food, it was NOTHING like any mac & cheese we've ever had. This was not creamy, had an odd "tang" to it (prolly due to the sour cream) and looked terribly unappetizing on our plates. My cottage and cheddar cheeses never melted properly (hence the not so great texture / appearance). I expected a slightly creamy, custardy dish, but what I ended up with was FAR from it. NOTE: Traditional mac & cheese starts with a homemade cheese sauce. Flour and milk are slowly combined to form a roux and then a variety of cheeses are added to create a velvety smooth sauce. While this may be another way to enjoy a popular classic, It didn't do much for us. I guess I'm just a sucker for Mouse's macaroni & cheese (it seems more authentic, IMHO). Thanks anyways, MRSO. :-)

This is hands down my all-time favorite macaroni and cheese recipe! I was hesitant to make it at first, because I had never before heard of cottage cheese or sour cream being used in mac and cheese...but, I'm so glad I gave it a shot. I found this recipe quite some time ago and I've made it many, many times since. I never change anything in the recipe -- it's perfect just the way it is. The only thing I "change" (not really a change, since it doesn't actually specify which to use) is my choice of bread crumbs. I use Italian style bread crumbs, not plain ones. The Italian flavor seems to give it a whole new layer of deliciousness. (The ONLY thing I would change, if I had to, would be the amount of bread crumbs. You could easily get away with using maybe a half a cup instead. But, I do love bread crumbs, so a full cup works for me!)

This was good.  The only 'accidental' change I made was using mild cheese instead of sharp.  That may be the reason it was a bit more bland than I would have wanted.  Took a bit to zest it up a little.

Sooo good, Chuck!  I usually make a more traditional and lower fat version but it's crappy compared to this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except used ziti pasta and panko.  We had a bit extra parmy so added that with the breadcrumbs and butter!  It was rich and AMAZINGLY creamy!  Careful to add only 8oz of pasta...I almost used the whole box which was a pound.  We used good quality extra sharp chedder.  I'd like to try to make it lower in fat but it was so good and so worth the splurge!

Fantastic! I was craving greasy fast food so I made this to contain the craving. Definitely fulfilled what I wanted. I did not have cottage cheese so I used plain yogurt and still delicious! I will be making this everytime I crave Jack in the box! Btw also good with tapatio if you like spicy :)

I loved this.  I used 1/2 C. shredded parmesan, asiago,romano blend and1/2 cup of milk, like others suggested.  I also only topped with cheese because I didn't feel like messing with the bread crumbs.  I'm SURE it would be great that way.  Very creamy and delish!

I thought this was a very good recipe!! It was my first time making homemade mac 'n cheese and my partner loved it...the only changes I made to it was adding milk like others had suggested. Next time I will decrease the sour cream by half simply because it over powered the rest of the cheeses. I will also add garlic...overall a fantastic dish...

This recipe goes in my hall of fame.  I have made it for every function possible and it is always a huge hit!  Even the pickiest eater in my life loves it.  (Don't mention it has cottage cheese and they will never know.)  I don't eat cottage cheese at all except in this recipe.  I do add a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little extra kick!

Took this to a pie making party and everyone LOVED it. I added 1/4 cup milk as some people suggested and extra cheddar and Parmesan. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because it was all I had in the pantry. At the end I put it on a high broil for a few minutes to get the top really golden brown. It was delicious!

I did not care for this recipe at all. My husband (who will eat just about anything) asked me to please not make this one again, but rather my other baked mac recipe. I think the cottage cheese threw it off a bit for me. Needless to say, the leftovers were tossed. :(

I tried this last Thanksgiving for the first time and everyone absolutely loved it!  The biggest plus is that it was so much easier to make than my traditional mac and cheese!  I lost the recipe and had to search again to find it for this Thanksgiving!

This was just "ok". As suggested by others, I added some milk, about 1/2 cup. If I hadn't it would have been rather dry. It was "gooey" but not the rich cheesy consistency I was wanting.

Just okay.  Reminded me too much of cheesy potatoes because of all the cheddar & the SC.

Sorry. I tried to like this but it had a sour taste probably due to the sour cream and possibly the cottage cheese. I like a much richer cheese flavor and thought this was it. I followed the recipe exactly since I like to start off that way but it just wasn't my taste. sorry.

Very good recipe! I used shells instead, and did not have bread crumbs, so I crushed about half cup of Toppables crackers as the topping. I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while and I've not been disappointed :)

Love this!  I always use non fat sour cream and low fat cottage cheese to cut down on the richness some.  Add whatever seasonings you are in the mood for...this weekend I doubled the recipe and made two batches.  The first in a 9x13 with a mixture of seasoned pepper, garlic salt, cajun seasoning, and a pinch of cayenne mixed into the bread crumb mixture.  The second, no breadcrumbs and extra creamy (eyeball the milk...you won't go wrong) to make a velveeta like consistency for the kids.  Next time I will add curry, chicken, and a green veggie...yum!

I made this today and it was a hit with my husband! I took everyone's suggestions and added 1/4 of milk to prevent having it dry out and decreased the breadcrumbs to 1/4 as well. I can't wait to experiment with other kinds of cheese :)

DON"T BAKE IT! It is so much better not baked. Just mix the cook pasta with the cheeses, cottage cheese, & sour cream. Mix it on the stove to keep it warm and serve.

This was such a wonderful change for macaroni and cheese. It was not as rich as other recipes I have, but that's okay. Adding the cottage cheese actually makes it semi-healthy and adds alot of protien. Will make again and again!

I havent reviewed on here in years, but I felt compelled to review this. I have never in my life intentionally ate cottage cheese, knowing its in there grosses me out. But, I took a risk after reading all the great reviews and made this....I'm not sorry!! It was delicious. It was easy to prepare, I had all the stuff already in my fridge (minus the cottage cheese) and it was ready in a snap! I only put half the amount of cottage cheese, because I was nervous I wouldnt like it if it tasted like it too much (which, it did not) and we didnt have a whole pack of shredded cheddar, so I put what we had (maybe 2ozs) and the rest in cheddar cheese slices I crumbled up, and I added two crumbled up pieces of American as well. Everthing else I did the same (but next time I will only use half the amount of bread crumbs....it was a bit much for me) we baked as directed and it was awesome, even my kids loved it. We ate and ate it and only ate half. So I saved the rest, and we'll heat it back up in its baking dish tomorrow and eat it with something else! It makes a large pan, my family of 5 only consumed half.

This recipe turned out great.  We didn't end up adding the milk, but the end result wasn't as dry as some others claimed it to be (although I suppose all of that is based on preference).  The taste is great and it's very filling, but the stuff sits HEAVY in the stomach.  It took a few hours for me to feel alright again.  It'd be nice to lighten the recipe a bit, made by taking the bread crumb topping out and lessening the amount of cheddar cheese.  Next time we'll try adding some other ingredients.  The tomato soup that another reviewer suggested does sound like a good idea.

wow. I did end up making a few changes like some of the other reviewers. I used 1/4 cup bread crumbs and used less butter, about half the butter reccomended in addition to adding a little milk, about 1/4 cup.

I think this is a dish that needs to be eaten right out of the oven.  I took this to my small group, and by the time we were able to eat it (approx. 45 min. later) it was a little on the dry side.  The taste is very good though, but not the best I've eaten.

Wow!  This dish went fast---all gone the first night!  I also modified the basic recipe some based upon what I hand on hand.  I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.  I added about another cup's worth of cheese to the mix as well as one-half cup of whole milk.  We like Mrs. Dash seasoning, so I added lots of that as well.  For the topping, I used crushed salt and pepper kettle chips (instead of the bread crumbs)and added some extra cheese and some melted butter.  Kids loved the smell as it was cooking.  My teen-aged son had three helpings! Wish I had some for myself right now:)  Will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

It called for way too many bread crumbs.  It also wasn't cheesy enough. The noodles soaked up all the cheese.

This was really good. I think next time though I'll add a splash of milk to the filling, and use different bread crumbs- but overall it was pretty good, and definitely filling!

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars.  Followed exactly minus the butter for the bread crumbs.  It is nice to have a mac & cheese recipe that doesn't require all sorts of ingredients.  These are always on hand.

My teenage daughters love this stuff!  I have made other mac and cheese recipes but always come back to this one because my daughters dont like the other recipes.  This is a very tangy mac and cheese dish so it may not be for everyone but we like it.  
Sometimes I add some melted butter to the recipe to make it less dry.
We will eat it either way!
Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all - I like my mac and cheese creamy and rich, and this did not cut it.  It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't a great recipe.  It's fairly dry, add milk.  There wasn't nearly enough cheese, I would double the cheddar for sure.  I'd also lessen the bread crumbs and bake it in a smaller but deeper dish.

Delicious recipe but I prefer a less 'gooey' mac and cheese, so I doubled the amount of pasta and put in one pound.  It was still very good and my toddlers loved it.  I love the buttered bread crumb topping.  The cheese combination creates a tangy flavor which is very pleasant. Good recipe.

I love this recipe! The cheese is so ooey gooey delicious! It's creamy and the breadcrumbs add the perfect bit of crunch. I especially like the parts that are a little more "burnt"...yum.

Made this on a recent camping trip thinking it would be a hit for both kids and adults alike.  Not that great.  Kids did not care for it and most of the adults couldn't get over the oily bread crumbs on top.  My suggestion to make this better is to incorporate a simple veggie mix to give it more nutrition and skip the bread crumbs on top.  Very salty made from original recipe but if you skip the breadcrumbs and do not add any salt it may help.

The first time I made the recipe I put too many breadcrumbs on it and that is all we tasted. Second time omitted some of the breadcrumbs and was much better.

I'm not a well practiced cook & wanted to make my boyfriend's favorite food for him (mac & cheese) from scratch. I put these ingredients together; adding a splash of milk because of dryness. The final result was good; however, a bit oily from so much butter. Next time, I'll leave out the buttered bread crumbs and go with low fat dairy.

Not exactly what I expected, taste was a little to tangy for my liking. Instead of using 1 cup of bread crumbs I would probably do 1/2 cup as well as a little less cottage cheese and maybe add some milk.

This is great, especially if you LOVE cheese with a passion. I am more of a creamy person, so I will substitute some of the sour cream and cottage cheese with milk and/or cream next time and see how it goes.

I've tried many different recipes for mac and cheese, but I have to say this one is the best! While making it my husband was sceptical because of the cottage cheese and sour cream. He actually told me he wouldn't even try it. Its a good thing that he did because he was impressed and declared that I had to make this more often. I loved the topping but he wasn't so sure about it. I think it just depends on what you like. If you prefer topping like this, don't skip out. If you don't like it, still use this recipe but put a cheese blend on top.

First time I made this I used what I had on hand, and it turned out wonderfully with the following changes: (warning, for cheddar lovers only!) Omit Cottage Cheese (gotta try that at somepoint...) Increase Cheddar Cheese to 10-12 oz (about 1.5 cups) Add 4-6oz Mozzerrella (about .5 - .75 cups)

Not exceptionally creamy but still very good!  I stirred it every so often to ensure the cottage cheese melted.

This macaroni is the BEST.  So easy...don't need to make a sauce and dirty another pan.  People have told me they don't like Mac N Cheese and have gone back for seconds on this recipe.  My husband prefers 1/2 the bread crumbs, but otherwise this is a keeper!

I loved this recipe.  I added some mozzo cheese too.  Really, you can play around with all sorts of different cheeses.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added Ritz crackers on top instead of the breadcrumbs.  Yummy!

This is the greatest homemade mac and cheese I have ever had or made.  Thanks for sharing.  I did add alittle more cheese (colby and alittle mozzerella) and like another review I added milk and it  turned out creamy.  Very good.  This is something that I will make over and over again.

It was just okay.  I followed the recipe, but added more cheddar cheese. a bit of milk and decreased the bread crumbs as other reviewers suggested.  I guess I didn't like the sour cream/cottage cheese taste.

This is hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had/made. I subbed half the cheese with horseradish cheddar and it was an incredible addition.

This was really tasty. The only complaint I heard in my house was that they didn't like the bread crumbs so next time I will probably leave them off, but that is just a family preference I think. Otherwise this was a very good mac and cheese!

Great recipe.  My kids LOVED this.  I followed advice of others and cut the amount of bread crumbs in half.  I also added 1/8 tsp of turmeric.  Outstanding flavor!!  We will make this one again!

Surprisingly, the cottage cheese and cream cheese flavor didn't stand out like I thought it would.  In fact, based on the rave reviews, I was a little surprised by the lack of flavor.  It wasn't that cheesy at all...it was somewhat bland.  I followed the recipe; except, I followed the recommendation of the other reviewers and didn't use all of the bread crumbs.  I was able to thickly cover the casserole with about half of the bread crumbs.  I think next time I'll go for a cheesier mac and cheese recipe.

Simply Fabulous!  Added some mozerella in since I didn't have enough cheddar and topped with Panko!  Family loved it!  Might add some milk next time to keep a bit more moist; but great recipe!

I have made this dish many times now. I have used bread crumbs and cheese on top and I think the bread crumbs are better. I also add 1/3 cup of milk just before cooking to help keep it moist for reheating. I think I will try adding onions next time!

ooooo...this is so yummy!!  I'm from the South and nothing up north compares to Southern mac and cheese!  Most of the Southern restaurants use cottage cheese and sour cream in theirs and this is the closest thing I've had!  It's just wonderful...my fiance and I are always trying out new mac and cheese recipes and this is by far our favorite.  We're huge fans of Panko breadcrumbs b/c they stay nice and crispy and crunchy when you back them, so that's what we use.  And we also love spicy food, so we always use pepper jack, or some variation of spicy cheese, as one of the cheeses.  This is a keeper :)

This recipe was not creamy enough, had way too many bread crumbs, and was pretty bland.  It was also not very cheesy tasting.  I prefer my macaroni creamy and cheesy, so I am sorry Chuck, I will be making someone else's macaroni next time!  It was edible, but not preferable.

I made this for my neighbors (and kept a little for us) and it came out perfectly!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain.  I also used freshly grated cheese instead of packaged.  It came out incredible.  Crunchy on top, creamy and cheesy in the middle.  My neighbors said it was the best mac-and-cheese they have ever had!

I am trying to find recipes that all three of my kids like and are somewhat healthy.  When I read this, I thought will they eat this with cottage cheese in it.  I made it, and they said - don't ever buy box macaroni and cheese again.  They would eat this every night if I made it.  I told them after they loved it so much that it had cottage cheese in it, and they said they knew all along, but liked it anyway.  Gotta Love It!

I tried this recipe because my youngest son was coming home from school, and brining his girlfriend. Wasn't sure they would like the cottage cheee and sour cream version, but what the heck try everything once. I also added some milk and extra cheddar cheese  (as mentioned below). I doubled the recipe since all three sons were bringing girlfriends over. There was not one noodle left in the pan after 30 minutes. THEY LOVED IT! This will be my new easy mac and cheese recipe. Thank you for posting! Amazing!!

This was a wonderful variation on an all time favorite! I followed the reader suggestion of adding milk to combat any dryness and it worked beautifully! I also added a tsp of fresh cracked pepper and about a 1/4C Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb topping and it gave the crust a delightful crunch! Crunchy topped is our family's favorite way to eat Mac-n-Cheese!

Certainly better than from a box, but not the best baked mac and cheese I've had before. Topping was crispy which was good.

I make this recipes for my vegetarian cousin during the holidays.  It is a great side dish or a main dish for the kids.  Instead of using bread crumbs and butter, I use crumbled up salt free ritz crackers.  Yummy:)

This is a fabulous recipe my wife and I enjoy once a month. It is very satisfying and cheesy. We add bacon bits (bacon, bacon, bacon) and onion crisps and yes mozzarella, ummmm!!! Try it yourself you will not be disappointed.

One of my favorite recipes, I make variations of it fairly often.  Try adding a chopped tomato (better than canned stuff), and adding a bit of cayenne and smoked paprika to the bread crumb mixture.  I like to put a bit of salt or parmesan in the bread crumb mixture as well.

Tastes very good. I made some quick farmer's cheese mixed with some yogurt as I did not have cottage cheese. I also used yogurt instead of the sour cream. This turned out delicious inspite of my substitutions. Quite a foolproof recipe!

I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand so I replaced that with ricotta. When reading the reviews before making this, I couldn't understand how people could say it was dry with all the cheese involved! But, lo and behold, it was indeed dry. If I made it again, I would probably add milk to make it creamier. It was the kind of recipe where the first few bites were great, but... Also, if I make it again I'd definitely cut the amount of bread crumbs in half. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed.

This was very easy to prepare and came out rich, creamy and good!  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage.

Chuck you rock!  Best mac and cheese ever.  I even preferred it the next day because it was bit more dry.  Kids wouldn't touch it because they only eat real mac and cheese from box. Ha.   Anyway, can't go wrong with how easy this is to make.  I didn't use all of the topping, but that is something you can easily adjust.  Anyway, will be making again when I feel like some comfort food.

This wasn't too bad. A little dry, but good. I used as much low fat or fat free ingredients where I could with this recipe. Kids loved it, of course.

The containers of cottage cheese and sour cream made this recipe a bit too tangy for our tastes.  We'll either cut those down next time or find another recipe.  The consistency was great, however-- sauce wasn't too thick or thin.

I used light sour cream and lowfat cottage cheese, but it was still: Very flavorful. Light compared to a lot of Mac & Cheese recipes. Nice crunchy breadcrumb topping. Simple, inexpensive ingredient list. Simple, fast preparation. Was perfect amount for 6 servings (5 adults, 2 small children)

My pickiest eater actually gave this 5 stars, but my husband and I would have liked a bit more sauce.  I did make 1 1/2 times the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan but it wasn't very creamy.  It was very good but not near as creamy as I was expecting..

Verrry yummy and so easy to make because you just mix all the ingredients in the 9x13. More flavour then the usual mac and cheese because you use sour cream and cottage cheese versus milk.

I did really enjoy the bread crumb crust, topped it off very nicely!  My only complaint was that yes, it was a little drier than I expected, and not as cheesy as I prefer macaroni and cheese. I think the suggestion from other people was to add some milk? Next time! I used whole wheat macaroni, and it tasted just fine. I also reduced the fat on the cheese and sour cream as well. I'll definitely try it again, and pair it with a great ham or something, to accentuate the taste!

My mom's Southern mac & cheese is the best, in my opinion. But it's time consuming. I decided to give this a try on a day I wanted mac & cheese but didn't have alot of time. I like the tangy flavor of it. And I didn't use any cottage cheese (didnt have any). I also think next time I will leave off the bread crumbs, as this recipe is very rich as is.

This recipe was so delicious.  My three kids (ages 7, 5 and 20 months) loved this recipe, as did my husband and myself.  I added diced onion and the overall consistency wasn't altered at all.  I separated the mixture into two pie dishes...froze one and baked the other and served as a side dish.  Needless to say, the pie dish I'd frozen came out a two days later and was quickly consumed!!  :)

The best! Beats grandma's recipe, hands down. When reheating it seems dry at first, but then when I pulled it out of the microwave it was moist and creamy again! Even my husband who prefers the box kind to homemade loves this!

This deserves a double thumbs up!  It is surprisingly delicious.  The only change we made was adding a little season salt to the bread crumbs.  This is probably the BEST homemade Mac and Cheese recipe that we have ever made OR had!!!  We will definitely make this one again.  WAY TO GO, CHUCK!!!

This is SO good. I will not be adding bread crumbs next time - in my opinion, it just added useless calories to a high calorie meal. My BF, whom doesn't like sour cream, liked it but couldn't eat too much of it (the reason I gave it 4 stars).  But it is SO gosh darn good!

I LOVE this recipe and has become a favorite in our family.   And the revision I have made is I replace the bread crumb topping with bacon bits!   I use about 1/2 lb. bacon per batch.  AWESOME!

It was pretty good. Very rich and creamy.  My kids suggested more cheddar, less crumb topping next time.  I've had better, but this one is pretty good. I am thinking next time I'll add some milk and maybe a creamier cheese and I'll cut the crumbs by half, maybe more. I did use lower fat and calorie sour cream & cottage cheese. Next time I may also use a whole wheat pasta and a lower fat cheese in place of the cheddar, it was almost too rich!

This is my staple mac and cheese recipe - everyone asks for it. You need to add a half cup of milk and cut down on the bread crumb mixture by at least half. You can use low fat sour cream and cottage cheese, but you've got to use full fat cheddar cheese - not the 2%. I usually add some garlic powder and whatever other seasonings look good at the time. With these changes, I really don't know how anyone could NOT like this.

It was pretty good but I really did not like the breadcrumbs on it and I reduced it to 1/2 cup.  Even that seemed too much.

Update:  leftovers allowed the breadcrumbs to soften, and when heated with a splash of milk and some american cheese, it tasted MUCH better.

Great adaptable creamy mac and cheese. I am sure this would be good just as it is.  Who would have know to use cottage cheese and sour cream?   Anyway I came across this recipe while looking for a recipe that would clean out my fridge.  I use up some other ingredients in my fridge, cut the amount of macaroni down to 6 oz added cooked bacon, sauteed onion and 1 jalopeno pepper, and some diced deli ham.  I also used swiss instead of cheddar.  It was very good.  I also season with chili pepper and a dash of hot pepper and dijon. the point of my review was that cottage cheese and sour cream are really the secret ingredients to good mac & cheese.

This was so good! The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup milk to make it creamy.  Would not change anything else!! Perfect!

i could see how someone might love this. it's very flavorful and not run of the mill. i did not love it. my kids did not love it, either. they wanted me to replicate trader joe's mac and cheese.

As easy as it is delicious! I was skeptical; this is a very unconventional recipe, but I highly recommend it...I will make this again and again..I just made this last night and could not wait to review it.

Very yummy. I've made this for many people and everyone raves about it. I like to get an 8 oz block of extra sharp cheddar - shred the whole thing and use that instead of a pre-shredded cheese.

I made this for a couple friends the other night.  After a few bites of this, one friend looks at the other and asks "have you ever had better homemade mac n' cheese? I know I haven't!" I will make this over and over.  It's sooo delicious and super easy!!

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was bland and the cup of breadcrumbs made it really dry when we ate it. Oh well.

This was so yummy.  I have "food rules" and I would have to say no cottage cheese in Mac 'N Cheese would be one of them, but I tried it anyway, I'm glad I broke the rules.  I used Munster and Colby Jack, it's what I had on hand, I added more then the recipe called for.  I also added ham.  I ommited the salt since I put in the ham and pepper cause I used Italian bread crumbs.  I also took the other advise and added milk.  This is a great recipe.  I try not to make boxed meals for my son so this is a GREAT alternative to Kraft Mac N Cheese.  Thanks!!

YUM-O!! I didn't have sour cream so I boiled 3/4 cup of milk and wisked in about 1/4 cup of cottage cheese. After thickening, I poured mixture all over the cooked corkscrews (used corkscrews instead of elbows) and followed recipe for remaining steps. My husband LOVED this mac-n-cheese!!

Made exactly as recipe stated, it was dry and sour tasting. The next time I made it I added 4 oz more cheddar, a bit of garlic and a bit of mustard and still the over all taste was sour and dry. Everyone left it on their plate, will not make again.

I thought the basic recipe was great but I always switch and substitute in recipes. I used fat free half & half instead of adding milk like others had suggested. I also used the last bits of several different types of cheese that I had in the fridge; some manchego, gruyere, aged gouda & asadero plus a package of sharp Cheddar which made for extra creamy deliciousness. I processed the parmesan, sour cream and cottage cheese in the food processor with some kosher salt, wacky salt, seasoned salt, garlic & onion powder and a bit of tabasco and cajun seasoning for a little bit of zip. I also added a few teaspoons of leftover cream cheese :) On the top, I did a layer of cheddar cheese and I only had Italian breadcrumbs so I went with a crushed up mix of corn flakes, saltines & ritz crackers mixed with melted butter. It was even better with my many modifications but I am so glad for the idea of using sour cream and cottage cheese rather than the traditional ways with bechamel sauce or eggs. This is a much better base recipe to start from.

I thought this would be fantastic with all the rave reviews, but it was very dry and there were way too many breadcrumbs. I'd suggest cutting back by 1/2 on those. It was also very plain... don't think I'll be making it again.

I thought this recipe was a bit dry.  Overall taste was good. I think the next time I make this I would add milk (as someone suggested) to make it creamier and do away with the breadcrumb topping (as many also suggested), and add more cheese for the topping.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! I made it as a side dish at a family event and it was a hit, everyone enjoyed it. I also made it another time and added a few other ingredients but I still thought it was amazing the first time! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great! Used Panko bread crumbs and they worked great.  Love the Parm but would add more cheddar. My finicky Mac-n-Cheese daughter even liked this recipe (and I have tried a few she didn't).

I doubled the recipe for a big event.  I added an additional 8 oz bag of cheese to the dish (so 3 when I doubled it), and sprinkled panko breadcrumbs on top (without adding the butter).  I too used low fat cottage cheese, 2% cheese, and light sour cream.  I used spiral noodles versus elbow macaroni.  The dish was a hit!  This is also even better day 2.  It was thick so if you like fried mac and cheese, you could do that with this recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe. The first time I made this I felt it could use a little more cheese. I use reduced fat cheeses, light sour cream, and reduced fat cottage cheese and it still comes out tasty! I used a little more cheddar and parmesan the second time around and it was perfect! I has a nice flavor and you don't feel so bad eating it if you use all the reduced fat products :)

I tried this recipe at least a couple times and did not see what all the fuss was about. not cheesy enough and too sour creamy--- thats about as simply as i can put it.  Definitely not your traditional comfort food you're used too.  I'm all for fancifying things but i just didnt appreciate the end result.

This was very good. Make sure you don't used flavored bread crumbs though, it takes away from the delicious cottage cheese.

Selected this recipe for my daughter's b-day party b/c of the reviews.  This was a hit and will be a do-over whenever we have a gathering of kids.  The cottage cheese didn't melt or mix up well - used the full-fat versions of everything.  Ran out of bread crumbs b/c I doubled the recipe, so I used oyster crackers.

FANTASTIC and so easy. No need to make white sauce as I normally do for man 'n cheese. I layered with sliced Campari tomatoes from Costco. Wonderful!

Pretty good, but not cheesy enough for my crowd. Next time I'll use twice as much cheddar.

I never liked mac and cheese until I tried this recipe. This is the most delicious thing I have ever tasted! I have roommates demanding that I make this every week. Thank you so much for posting this!

This came out really good. I added baby spinach to the macaroni the last minute of boiling then drained. I had it on hand for another macaroni recipe. I also used season bread crumbs and added a little parmesan to the mixture. It came out great. Next time I will add either ham or bacon. Clean up was a cinch only used 1 pot and the casserole dish!

I had a craving for a home cooked meal and this definitely did the job! It was my first time making homemade mac and cheese and I loved how quick and easy this recipe was. I made it exactly as written and the only thing I didn't like was the bread crumbs. Next time I will either try a cracker topping or leave it out altogether. Other than that it was perfect. I had leftovers 2 days later and didn't find it dry at all. It was just as good as the first night.

I thought this turned out okay. I think it could have been a bit more moist, so if I make again in the future may add egg and more milk to the recipe. Taste wise it was fine, a little bland for my tastebuds, but compliments an entree that is saucy. Thanks for sharing!

I made exactly to the recipe.  Gave 3 stars, it was just average.  Might make again, but will have to figure out how to give the recipe some zing!  The bread topping seems to be to much could be cut in half.

This was super easy and quick to make. I followed the recipe and my dish was dry. After I pulled it from the oven, I added aditional cheese. Next time, I will add the 1/4 to 1/2 C of milk and extra 4 oz of cheese, maybe montery jack, and only top with 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. For the size baking dish I used, there was too much crumbs. This is a great dish to add extras to: peas, ham, tuna, ect.

Family & friends really loved this. Kids? Not so much. For some reason they all rejected it saying it was sour. But all the adults raved about it! I doubled the recipe as I made it for a large group and had plenty of leftovers. I DO recommend adding extra cheese to counteract the sour.... It was different & really good!

Very good! Next time I would probably heat everything in a pan together before I put in the baking dish. The next day I did add a little bit of milk to reheat it back up and it was still very good! I will def use this again!

this recipe was just okay. my 8 and 10yo boys really did not like it at all.  i think it might be okay for a side dish but definitely not as a main dish.  i doubt i will make this recipe again.  too bad, i love sour cream and cottage cheese in recipes!

This tasted to me like traditional mac and cheese.  It was so good!!!!  I made is just as directed except added a little extra sour cream and about 1/2 cup milk.  It wasn't dry at all.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and used the whole amount.  That added alot of flavor and texture.  For more flavor, some crushed red pepper or hot sauce would be good.  Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is great and easy. I didn't have problems with it being dry like others though. I did use about half the amount of breadcrumbs than the recipe suggested. The macaroni came out very cheesy and delicious. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because I feel like it is missing something. I'm not sure what perhaps some other spice or something to give it some flavor.

Substituted Ricotta Cheese for Cottage Cheese, otherwise followed it exactly.  It came out a little dry.  I suggest 1 1/2 cups of milk to make it a little more creamy. Pretty good though

Followed the recipe exactly - no tweaking and no substitutions - sorry, found this to be rather dry and very bland, not much of a cheesy flavor at all.  A half a cup of bread crumb mixture would be plenty.  Prbabaly will not make again.

This recipe is unbelievable!  My husband, 6 year old and super picky 2 year old devoured it.  I doubled the recipe and added an 8oz. pkg of diced ham from the meat dept at the grocery and served it as a main dish.

Good if you prefer more of a tart Mac and Cheese. If i made this again, I would probubly top with more cheese and cut back on the bread crumbs.  I did not like the texture with the breadcrumbs.  I would maybe follow another reviewers advice and add Ritz Crackers.  It was good reheated.

This recipe is AMAZING.  I used all low-fat cheeses, and actually had to substitute plain non-fat yogurt because I didn't have any sour cream, and it still tasted delicious.  Even my husband liked it, and he is a bona fide mac and cheese hater.  I also cut the recipe in half, but used almost 8 ounces of cavatappi pasta instead of 4 ounces elbow macaroni.  The ratio of sauce to pasta is great, and the flavour is wonderful.   This is my new go-to mac and cheese recipe.

This is WONDERFUL! I debated trying it based on reviews but went ahead and I'm glad I did. It cannot be compared to Kraft or a saucy style mac and cheese because it's totally different. I did add 1/4 C. of milk and that added to the gooey yumminess! My 19 month old is loving it! If you're looking for a cheddar saucy mac n' cheese try elsewhere. This may be my new favorite kind!

This was fabulous!  I had no sour cream, so I substituted plain yogurt.  I made a double recipe and added a small amount of garlic powder to the mix.  I also used Italian bread crumbs which had a bit of garlic in them too.  Since I made a double recipe, I baked it a bit longer, til it was bubbly.  My husband and I loved it.  This is definitely going to be a regular for us from now on!

I was so dissapointed with this. It was super dry. I like my mac and cheese very creamy and this was not that. I'll admit the buttery bread crumbs were yummy but that was about it. Won't make this again.

Delicious and Oh, so easy to make! I followed advice from other reviewers and added a bit of milk. I also added a dash of dry mustard and about a 1/4 cup of mozzarella, just because I had it on hand. My kids (8 and almost 6) gobbled this up, as did my husband and myself. Will be making this often, as it is SO simple!

This did not go over well in my house.  Either I really messed up when making the dish, or it just wasn't all that good.

I'm not that good of a cook but this one worked well for me. Maybe I did something wrong but I was thinking ( hoping) it would have been moister and/or gooier but it was good and easy to make.

This recipe wasn't as good as my go-to mac and cheese recipe, though I'll still make it again for a change of pace. The flavor of the cottage cheese really stood out for me and completely overpowered the cheddar. Next time I think I'll cut back to 8 ounces.

I was so excited to make this, but with a house full of kids, the cottage cheese didnt go over well.  The sour cream was a bit much as well, that combined with the cottage cheese, it didnt have that creamy mac and cheese taste  Sorry, not for us.

Delicious! Changes I made were to add about a half a cup of cream (The left overs can be quite dry otherwise) and mix some parmesean and smoked paprika with the topping

LOVE this macaroni and cheese recipe! I doubled the recipe and added some chicken stock and about 3/4 cup milk for some moisture - glad I did. I also used soda crackers instead of bread crumbs. My only complaint was that it was a little bland. Definitely needs a fair amount of salt and pepper or some other type of kick. We all agreed it tasted even better the next day.

I was looking for a simple and tasty recipe and this certainly met the criteria. I'm not one for left overs, and so generally something of this size ends up in the garbage because I don't want to eat it for days HOWEVER, we finished the entire pan last night. This is a keeper! PS - used Italian Bread Crumbs instead of plain as that is what I had on hand. I won't make as much in the future as we ended up scraping a lot of it off. We loved the additional flavor however it was just too much topping. Thanks again!

Excellent flavor! This recipe is a favorite recipe in my house. It's both quick and easy.   My boyfriend requests it weekly. Both he and his bro LOVE it! I think it's delicious as well, but I'm lactose-intolerant and therefore all that cheese requires at least two Lactaid pills to digest.  I usually add about 1 T of ground mustard and Extra Sharp Cheddar.  Last night I added  1 T of Vegetarian Worcestire (sp?) based on another reviewer's suggestions but did not really like the flavor and got less compliments this time.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'd hate to work up the numbers and find out just how fatty this recipe really is...yikes. Only healthy and yummy get 5 stars from me.  Anyway, thanks so much for this variation on mac and cheese!

This tasted great!  The sharp Cheddar and sour cream add a nice "bite".  I put the cottage cheese through a food processor so my kids didn't see lumps of cottage cheese.  I cut the amount of breadcrumbs to 2/3 cup.  I also added some strips of American cheese on top before the breadcrumbs to make it a little cheesier.  I will make this again.

The flavor of this mac and cheese was very good, but the texture wasn't quite right. It was still a bit chunky from the cottage cheese, and a bit dry. I am going to add milk to the leftovers. Next time I will try baking it a little longer to let the cottage cheese melt, or maybe I will blend the cottage cheese in a food processor first. I like the tangy taste from the cottage cheese and sour cream. I used low-fat versions of both and regular sharp cheddar. I omitted the breadcrumbs and butter topping. Maybe the added butter would have helped the moisture problem.

Just made and it is delicious!!!!! This was my first time ever making macaroni and cheese. I am a beginner cook and was definitely surprise on how it came out.  I added 1/2 cup of milk and probably could have used a little less milk. I used Italian breadcrumbs because it was all I had but added a good flavor to the dish. I used a little over a half of shredded cheddar cheese and around 4 ounces of velvetta cheese. Almost burnt my tongue eating it out the oven!!!!

This is pretty good!  I've made it twice, now.  The first time was at my son's birthday party (at the doubled amount) and everyone raved over it.  The second time, I did it and it was a little better, probably because I made the breadcrumbs myself by taking 2 slices of Whitewheat and toasting them, then crumbled (loosely in chunks) into a bowl and tossed with melted butter to put over top.  Store-bought breadcrumbs are icky.  :)  This will probably be my go-to for mac and cheese; it's pretty easy.

It was quick and easy to make, and a huge hit with the in laws, but both my husband and I thought it was a little dull. For some reason the left overs a few days later were far taster though. The bread crumbs are defenitly over whelming, I'd cut them down by at least half, and toss in some peas and chicken for some extra flavor. Other than that it's definitly a keeper!

This is the tenth or more time I've made this dish. It's a family favorite. Last night though I added some diced leftover ham to it. My 13 year old son declared it the best thing I've ever made! Thank you so much for sharing this!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner because I'm not a fan of steak or lobster. It was magnificent! Everyone raved about how good it was, and most went back for seconds. I used Panko bread crumbs and could have added more salt, but overall a fantastic dish.

Delicious.  We often add bacon or diced ham.  Don't be scared of the cottage cheese!

I always look in allrecipes for new recipes before I look anywhere else. Almost, without fail the 4 and 5 star recipes have the the best I have found anywhere online. I tried this recipe tonight as it is cold here in Florida and we wanted some comfort food. I have to say, of all the recipes I have tried on allrecipes this is the most disappointing. The only things I changed after reading other reviews was: I added 1/2 cup milk to keep it moist and reduced the breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup. I found the flavor bland with the sour cream the most prominent flavor. I am still searching for the best mac and cheese and will keep looking. I will not make this again.

Great mac and cheese. I even used fat free cottage cheese, whole wheat elbows, and light sour cream. Also used light canola oil butter for the bread crumbs. It's a keeper.

After reading all the reviews, I was expecting an exceptional dish...unfortunately this dish was way too bland...no one raved about it at all...it was "okay" according to my guests.  It was medocre at best. Maybe good for a weeknight side dish b/c it's pretty easy to make, but I wouldn't serve at a party again.  I made it almost exact to the recipe except left off the breadcrumbs...maybe I should've left them on.

I will warn, this is NOT a traditional mac and cheese.  It's very tangy and the consistency is different.  That being said, it was GREAT!   I followed the recipe except I had a 12 oz block of sharp cheddar that I shredded by hand. I used probably a cup of shredded Parmesan, 1/4 cup of TGI Friday's bleu cheese dressing and 5-6 dashes of red Tabasco to give it a kick. You will definitely want to add about 1/2 cup of milk to keep it from being dry. I crumbled Ritz (veggie flavored) crackers on the top and sprayed it lightly with Pam instead of using butter.  Baked it for 30 minutes and it turned out beautifully.  I am a very amateur cook - the extent of my abilities is usually the microwave, so the fact that this turned out so well for me shows how easy it is.

This was the creamiest mac and cheese ever.  Next time I will use low fat ingredients however, you could just feel the heart attack coming with every bite, but it is SOOOOOOO good!  I did add about 3-4oz less cottage cheese, and replaced it with some more sharp cheddar.

Made this for a potluck and it was ok.  It is a little bit too dry for my style.  I also added 1/4th a cup of milk as suggested by some reviews.  The sour taste is a little too overbearing, for mac and cheese. Will not make this dish again.  I guess, depending on what type of mac and cheese you are used to and where you are from, you may like this style.  I personally prefer a cheesier, more moist style of mac and cheese.

Loved this recipe!  I used a bit more than 8 oz of pasta and also added about 6 slices of Muenster cheese.  The cottage cheese made the consistency soooo good. Awesome!

This recipe is amazing!! The only thing I'd change/add is use a bit less sourcream, and add twice as much cheddar cheese and about a 1/2 cup of milk so it doesnt dry out.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!! I was hesitant at first bc of the cott cheese and sour cream, but it was awesome and gave it moisture. You have to follow everything ... as in don't cut down on indgredients.  I used LOW FAT cott cheese and sour cream.  I mixed the cottage cheese, parm chese, shred cheese and sour cream FIRST so it was all blended well.   THEN add the elbows.  Mix very well... it was all gone after bringing it to a xmas party.  Thank you!!! GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!

Actually pretty good. I was doubtful about the cottage cheese, but it turned out well. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a kick, and my husband loved it. I halved the recipe and it still made quite a bit - my husband and I were eating leftovers for two days. This is not that gooey creamy mac and cheese but still very good. UPDATE 1/2009: I've made this four times now, and these are the changes I've made: for every one cup dry pasta I use 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup cottage cheese, 1/4 cup parmesan and 1 cup sharp shredded cheddar. I add about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper. Once everything is mixed in the dish I pour about 1/2 cup of milk over the top - this results in a much creamier mac 'n' cheese. Top all with a sprinkling of shredded cheddar AND the butter/bread crumb mixture. The results are nothing short of fantastic; I will never order a gourmet mac and cheese from a restaurant again.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and didnt require lots of prep work, which is great!  I used an 12 oz bag of noodles and found that to be a perfect amount. I added more cheddar cheese, and cut the cottage cheese to about 10 oz instead of 12. I also added 1/2 cup of Parmesan instead of 1/4, along with a little over 1/2 cup of milk for creaminess. 1 cup of bread crumbs is also way too much, you can probably cut it down about half.  Some reviewers said it was bland, but my husband LOVED it, so I think the additions of more cheese helped it create more flavor.

I thought this combination with sour cream would be the best, but I really didn't like the overpowering sour cream flavor. I love sour cream though, but not with this. I made a 1/2 batch to try before going ahead and bringing a pan of it to a party. I will not use this, instead I prefer Cabot's.

This recipe definitely isn't a favorite. Sorry.  I attempted the cheese sauce twice.  The first time I didn't stirr frequently enough and the cheese burned.  The second time I got it right and it tasted great.  After baking, however, it was really dry.  I took it to a Christmas party and it was hardly touched.  The breadcrumbs definitely didn't fit well, another topping may work better.  I won't be finding out though, because I won't be repeating this receipe.

Great recipe!  I made this last weekend for a huge family Christmas party (tripled the recipe) and it was wonderful!  Did add milk to cut down on dryness but the taste was great and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  Thanks Chuck!

yummy yummy.  This is requested for every holiday- even by my husband's family who are not very big on cheese.  Add the 1/2 cup of milk as mentioned earlier. It does help with reheating.

I've been making this dish for over a year now and friends and family love it. I have never changed or added anything. It's perfect as is. I've made this dish for potlucks, parties, bbq, or just for dinner. It's also extremely quick to make. My husband gets excited when he knows I'm cooking this.

This wasn't as good as the normal mac/cheese recipe I make, Mouse's on here.  My husband thought it was dry.  So so.

I made this yesterday. I did it because of the overwhelming reviews. I made the recipe as is and was dissapointed. Its ok, but thats about all I can say. I dont thing the cottage cheese did the recipe any favors. If I make it again, I will leave that out and replace it will something else, like real cheese. As is, the recipe is not very cheesy at all. If you make it, Id suggest mixinf up the ingrediants very well. Otherwise, you will wind up with spots of while in your sea of yellow. I might make this again, just because I dont want to go searcing for a better recipe to make for Christmas. As is, this recipe lacks cheesyness and flavor.

Awesome!!  My usual recipe for mac and cheese starts out with making a roux, then adding milk, then the cheeses.  This was so easy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe and added more sharp cheddar, a little less cottage cheese, and a little less sour cream.  I had some left over velveeta cheese that I added also.  I will definately be making this again!!

Well, I cannot say I am all that impressed.  I made a HUGE batch of this as a donation to a homeless meal, and honestly it was bland, perhaps I was expecting something way better.

This was good but next time I make it I'll make 2 changes:  1.) cut the topping (breadcrumbs / butter) in half and 2.) bake in a deeper casserole dish (not 9x13).  Seemed to have too much topping for our preference and dish was drier than expected (I thought it would be creamier).  But good.

Although I added a 1/2 C of milk it was still a little dry.  I think next time I will add a little bit more milk.  Very tasty.

Thought this recipe was fantastic.  Their was way too much topping for my taste so i'll probably make a 1/4 of that next time.  I did subsitute  about 1/2 cup cheese crackers for the bread crumbs and it gave it a really great flavor I also added about a T of Cayenne for added heat.  Will definately be my regular recipe from now on.

I left off the parmesan cheese and the bread crumbs. In place I put 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top. This was SO easy and very tasty. I have made this 3 times in less than 1 month and taken it to holiday parties where it has been a hugh hit. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe. Enjoy!

This is a good simple and easy mac and cheese recipe. The only thing I'd change is the bread crumbs. I probably wont add any next time as I didn't like the added texture. :P Other than that, it was still pretty good and was even better the next day!

This was the easiest and tastiest macaroni and cheese ever! Absolutely loved it. Next time I'll definitely try reduced-fat sour cream and cottage cheese (I don't think it will change the taste) and I will try a different noodle. The elbow macaroni I used was a bit small in size.

I added a little garlic powder and a little extra cheddar cheese. For the topping, I crumbled a sleeve of ritz crackers and added the melted butter...came out great! Even better the next day!

My favorite food is macaroni and cheese, so I was happy to try a new recipe.  My whole family liked this when I made it, but next time I will add milk to make it saucier and cut the topping ingredients in half.  Definitely worth making!

This is excellent and super easy to make.  I've made the tradional bechamel white sauce and added cheese ot toher recipes, but this one is even better. I made it  for a Sunday afternoon football gathering and it got great reviews.  Kids and adults enjoyed it.  Even my picky eater son had second helpings!   It was very moist, and the sharp chedder brings out the cheesy goodness. I buttered the baking dishes to make clean up easy.   I will make this again!  I did try to vary the recipes by adding some diced smoked turkey which was fine, but this recipe needs no alterations.

I thought this was one of the best recipes for mac and cheese I have made.  The only problem that I had was it was way too sharp.  Next time I make this I will go with a mild cheddar and see how it turns out.

I also lightened up on the breadcrumbs but followed exactly otherwise.  I would like to start a petition to change the name to Delaware's Favorite Mac and Cheese.  I had about 12 people eating this and everyone (I'm not kidding...everyone) loved it.  Kids, Adults, adult men that act like kids when they're all together; etc.  This will be my "go to" mac/cheese recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I rated it three stars because it *was* good! ..but I most likely will not make this again, unless I forget I tried it (that happens sometimes, haha).  I will say I made them w/o the butter and breadcrumbs and forgot to add milk to the recipe as some suggested, but those are trivial to the actual =cheese-taste= ..the cheese taste was not to my liking, tasted WAYYY to cotage cheese-y! (but I still ate it)

I made this for a family member, and sent the batch over to them.  They loved it, raved about it, and told others about it- so it must have been pretty good!  I made a low-fat batch for my home, and it was excellent as well.  Great recipe!

OUTSTANDING!  I made this with whole wheat macaroni and whole wheat bread crumbs.  WOW!  This is the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted.  Thank you MRSO for submitting this great recipe.

I loved this mac and cheese recipe. I've tried others but this one is by far the best. I did use the tips left by other reviewers. I added 1/2 cup of milk as someone suggested and I also cut down on the amount of bread crumbs as some one suggested. I think next time I'll do away with the bread crumbs all together. I also added extra cheddar cheese on the top.

This was really good!  I quadrupled the recipe so it was a really large batch.  I also made a mistake and added an extra 16oz sour cream by mistake and it still tasted good.  All the cheese did not melt inside though so the next time I make it, I will make the following changes--not rinse the pasta with cold water, instead, warm up the 1/2 c milk, mix it with the hot pasta, mix in the cheeses, so they will melt, the cottage cheesed, then the sour cream.  Also, cut the butter and bread crumbs in half, because it is too much.

I loved this....my boyfriend, not so much. He thought there were too many bread crumbs but I happend to like them. The best part was the center where it was the moistest. I can see this being really dry the next day. I will definitly make this one again. I thought it was great.

Awesome!  Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and EVERYONE LOVED it! Only changes I made were adding the 1/2 c of milk (very glad that I did) and I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed up ritz crackers instead. YUM!

This recipe has a decent flavor but there are way too many bread crumbs for me.  Try omitting the bread crumbs or sprinkling just a little on before baking.

Yummy!  My 5 year old loved this recipe and asked for me to make it again!  I would not use all the breadcrumbs like other users said and use low fat cottage cheese and sour cream w/ whole wheat pasta makes it a tiny little bit more healthy!  I'll be making this my permanet mac and cheese recipe

This was absolutely the best Mac & Cheese dish I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe pretty close but made some minor changes. I added a 1/4 cup more each of Cottage Cheese and Sour Cream. Topped with more cheddar and substituted bread crumbs with crushed Ritz crackers. WOW that was tasty!!!

This has become an almost weekly recipe in our house.  I throw in some ham or kielbasa and some veggies for an easy one-dish meal.  The original way to make this is very good, but I have found we all enjoy it more when I use an Italian blend bag of cheese instead of what the recipe suggests.  Extremely delicious!

Not a bad recipe...I'm not a fan of how the cottage cheese doesn't fully integrate and thus leaves little white pieces throughout.  When reheating, be sure to add a little milk.  The taste was good, I'm just more of a fan of mac and cheese that's more creamy than dry.

It's MY favorite too! It's soo good, I have to double the recipe to feed 6. Moist and flavorful. The only thing I add is a little onion powder and garlic powder. Give it a try!

It was fairly good.  But next time I will add some milk to make it creamier and use corn flake crumbs.  I really did not like the bread crumbs at all.

Although it was not bad, I really didn't love this recipe.  I grew up eating my mom's mac and cheese made with a very basic cheese bechamel sauce and this doesn't really measure up...it had more of a dry/lumpy texture (and I added 1/2 cup of milk as some reviewers had suggested).

I didn't care for as much of the bread crumbs as there were and it was not as "creamy" as I would have preferred, that can be tweaked though and that being said, it has a delicious flavor to it.

I thought this was a really good quick and easy Mac N Cheese. I usually make a very labor intensive mac for special occassions. I wouldn't make this when I want to impress because the flavors aren't intense enough but I will make it again for a regular dinner when I'm craving cheesy carbs! I will also add in some extras next time (bacon, veggies, cayenne pepper, etc).

I made this the other night for my family. It was FABULOUS! The leftovers sat in the fridge for a day, then enjoyed by my husband and I for lunch. It was GREAT!!! I will definitely make this again. I've already shared the recipe with friends and family.

The macaroni had very good flavor but was quite dry and needs more cheese or liquid.  Also, it had WAY too much bread crumbs on top.  I will reduce by half next time.  With these few tweaks I think this recipe has potential.

This had a decent flavor but the cottage cheese really threw the texture off and made it look very strange. I could never serve something that looked like this. Back to the search for mac and cheese.

EXCELLENT!!!!! Cant wait to have this again.  Made it lastnight and it's already gone today.  Only changes I made were: Shell pasta; added PepperJack cheese; Didn't use butter, just lightly sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  Best mac N cheese recipe I've tried AND made myself!

This was a tasty recipe that was very easy to make "healthier."  I used fat-free cottage cheese and sour cream and low-fat shredded cheddar cheese.  It wasn't the "best-ever" mac & cheese I've had, but I will definitely make again because of it's low calories.  I may add some ground mustard seasoning to add some additional flavor as I have seen in other recipes.  Thanks for the easy, tasty, healthy dish!  My family liked this too!

my husband and i are huge mac and cheese fans. we loved the cheese mixture. but we did not like the bread crumbs. i covered the dish with the bread crumbs and still had more left over. so i dumbed all of them on top.. bad idea. i should of used 1/2 or even a 1/4 cup. i tried to brush most of them off after baking with no luck.. maybe next time, i will top it with more cheese??

This recipe turned out great and my boyfriend loved it! A few suggestions:  -Definitely add some milk -- about 3/4 cup  -Perhaps sub a bit of milk for sour cream and add a bit more cheddar -- I found the taste of the sour cream slightly overpowering, but it does make this dish very creamy  -add some bacon!!

This was very good.....not sure... I also had a hard time with the bread crumbs....came out too soggy instead of a crunch. That's why only 4 stars.  Great to keep in fridge for my husband to eat late at night!

Perfect, after I made these changes; I added about 3/4 cup milk, and I used 3/4 cup bread crumbs. I didn't have as much cottage cheese as the recipe called for,but it was still great!

This was delicious! I ended up doubling the recipe because of how much macaroni I had on hand.  I searved it to my inlaws for some confort food and they loved it! I even froze the extra and we had it last week.  My only complaint is that I wish I had followed other's advice and used less bread crumbs.

loved it and was a hit at the tailgate. i like to kick it up a notch, and suggest mixing in some cayenne pepper. regular pepper works too for the mild crew.

My husband said this was the best mac & cheese he has ever had, and when he took the leftovers to work, no one would believe it was "just" macaroni & cheese!  We loved it, and I made it as written.

This is wonderful.  I added a 1/2 cup of milk as others suggested to cut down on the dryness and it worked.  I only wish it was alittle creamier, but it is still good!

Didn't change a thing, and it was perfect.  My in-laws chowed! Kids loved it.  My hubby, who is a vegan, looked at it and said, "That almost makes me want to eat cheese.  It smells amazing!"  Thanks Chuck!

I added 1 can of cream of tomato soup as someone suggested but it was on the dry side.  I should have reduced the bread crumb mixture as someone suggested....way too much!  And the leftovers are dry but I will add some milk and hope for the best.  The flavor is good, not your traditional mac and cheese but tasty!  Thanks!

Excellent! I made the recipe exactly as is and it was delicious! I think it could have been even better with more cheese so Ill be adding more next time. As for the bread crumbs, I had read previous reviews that said they thought it was too much so I was curious to see how it turned out, as I used the recommended amount...as a result, I see no need to use less, it was perfect!

Sooo tasty! I added extra cheddar, and used about 3/4 of the bread crumbs. Will definitely be making this again! My nephew (who is 3 years old) couldn't get enough of this mac & cheese!

This is so good! Only thing is that you only need about 3/4 cup of bread crumbs - i didn't use all of them.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I hate the SITE of cottage cheese and was VERY hesitant to try this ... but I did because it made it fairly healthy :) I followed it to a tee except I didn't do the breadcrumbs. It was late and I was too lazy!  I sprinkled more of the sharp cheddar cheese on the top and OMG ... sooo good! I didn't tell my husband that it had cottage cheese and sour cream until he told me how DELICIOUS it was. He was amazed and had seconds.  I am eating it right now at my desk, ice cold ... it's like a macaroni pie!  No signs of cottage cheese and GREAT flavor. I used 'reduced-fat' sour cream.  Thanks for this one!  Making it for guests next week. Can't wait to tell them what's in it!   Oh, and I used a different small pasta instead of elbows because that's what I had ... rattoulli or something.

This was all crumbs and macaroni, no cheese. It was dry, and tasted nothing like mac & cheese. I thought crumbs and butter was going to make a crispy top, but NO... it was dry and crumbly. I won't make this again.

This is my new go to recipe for mac and cheese.  I use extra sharp cheddar and a good dose of cayenne pepper to give it some zing.  I leave off the bread crumbs.  This stuff disappears instantly when I make it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was heavenly! Very rich. Wow. The whole family raved and we all stuffed ourselves. The only thing we changed was used we penne pasta, rather than elbow as we prefer a denser noodle. And this sauce was more than a perfect match for a heavier pasta. Bread crumbs were just the right topping too. Highly recommend this recipe.

This is a change on rating from a 4 to 5 star.  This is now my go to recipe. I keep trying other recipes but they don't compare.  Everyone who tries this, loves it.  Only thing I do different is I do not do the crumb topping (I tried it the first time and it comes out oily), and most the time I add in some bacon.  I make this almost every week.

This was a pretty good recipe. I would probably use more cheese next time. It didn't have the cheesiness that I like. But a good start!

This is by far the best mac and cheese I have ever eaten. I loved it and, more importantly, so did my whole family of picky eaters. I was nervous with the inclusion of cottage cheese, but the recipe is perfect as it is. I didn't change anything the first time I made it. The second time I made some changes to make it a bit more diet friendly. I simply substituted the lower fat versions of everything (low fat, NOT non-fat because then it is gross) and it was still delicious. I have to be careful to get enough protein and between the Barilla Plus pasta I used and the cottage cheese and other cheeses, this is a great dinner! Lots of protein and really not too much fat, with the substitutions. Any way you make it, this is delicious.!

I made this sometime last year. I must be a fan of southern mac and cheese instead.  It was the cottage cheese I couldn't get past.

Much simpler than the "start with a white sauce" mac & cheese recipes, but not quite as cheesy tasting as those, either.  Also, a little on the salty side (probably the cottage cheese). I mixed all the dairy ingrediants in a bowl and added milk (1/2 cup?) before mixing it with the pasta.  The cottage cheese curds were really obvious the next day when I reheated the leftovers, but the flavor was still pretty good.

I did not care for this recipe.  The cheddar cheese made it stringy and dry.  I even added milk as another reviewer suggested but was still too dry for my liking.  My mac'n'cheese lovers informed me to stick with my old recipe!

I gave it 3 stars because my bff Gina makes mac and cheese better than this. I was thinking i would have to yank her hair out to get the recipe but she gave it right up so i'll try it next time. this is kinda dry... the kids didn't love it. it was just ok.

Just discovered this recipe a few hours ago and made it for dinner. My spouse who never eats sour cream ate a very large serving of this recipe and then asked what was in it. He was surprised and said give it 5 stars and keep it! Will make this often. Thanks for sharing.

very good mac & cheese!  you can absolutely change it to your taste.  we used lite cottage cheese and sour cream, added milk, and cut the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup.  second time around, we added capers and tomatoes to change it up a bit.  always delicious.

Good Mac and Cheese.  I added 2 crowns of broccoli to the pasta for the last 5 minutes of cook time and little smokies sausages to the top.

I needed to use up some cottage cheese and this recipe looked like it fit the bill. I did add about 1/2 cup of milk to moisten up the recipe. My toddler (a picky eater) had 2 servings and my hubby said it was his favorite kind of recipe for macaroni and cheese. A keeper and so easy I did it off the top of my head the 2nd time around. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe and SO EASY!  My entire family loved it.  Next time, I'll use less of the bread crumb mixture - about half.  It was too much.  It's good for having the texture.

I have made this mac and cheese several times. I have taken it to dinners and pot lucks. I half the recipe for dinner at home. My favorite element is the "bread" crumbs. I use cracker crumbs but either way it is good. Love it!

This is awesome and my family loves it. By far the best mac and cheese I have had. I did ad a couple of tablespoons of butter in with the mix and a splash of milk which keeps it from drying out. Very very good.

The only thing I really like about this dish was the breadcrumb topping.  The cottage cheese gave it an off taste/texture in my opinion.  It was just okay.

This is a fast and excellent recipe with a resulting quality product. This is so good that I van't think of a single thing to change. Just Perfect. If using a convection oven lower temp by 25 degrees.

this was great! I eyeballed some of the cheese items, but I just tried to keep the ratios about the same. I omitted the extra butter in the breadcrumb topping. Very yummy

This is the best mac and cheese I have ever made! I altered it by adding a few slices of crumbled bacon, and a small diced sweet onion. I also leave off the bread crumb topping.

I have been on this site for many many years and never have given a review!  This was so yummy I had too!  My picky picky 15 month old son loved it along with dad.   I did take a few suggestions and added milk--about 1/2 cup) and was lighter on the breadcrumbs I also added cooked chicken to this to make it more a full meal!  Loved it!  Was even better the next day!

This was very good.  I did add about 1/2 can of evaporated milk because it seemed too dry before baking. I used another reviewer's idea and used crushed plain potato chips on top, however I think i would have preferred it without anything.  Nice change from regular mac and cheese, and I was skeptical about the cottage cheese, but it added a nice touch.  Will definitely make this one again.

This is great! I made this for my husband and parents, and was a little worried that 8 ounces was not going to fill up a 9x13 in pan.  But it worked out well.  Next time I will use a smaller pan though, and there definatly will be a next time.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

Very good!  I followed a few sugguestions from others and added extra cheese.  Since I'm not a fan of bread crumbs..I changed it to crushed saltine crackers with melted butter on top sprinkled with cayenne pepper. I would certainly do this recipe again!!

I thought this was a very yummy and unique mac & cheese recipe. The flavors blended in well together.  Since I am not a fan of bread crumbs I emitted those, and I also added a few splashes of milk before it went in the oven and added a few extra sprinkles of sharp cheddar on the top 15 minutes before it was done. Turned out great!

This was very good, I found it a little dry but liked the flavors otherwise and my boyfriend loved it. Next time I'll add a little milk. Instead of bread crumbs/butter I used crushed, leftover potato chips we had.

This was the best mac and cheese recipe I've found yet on this site.  It was very delicious and my entire family loved it!  My husband really liked it and he doesn't even care for sour cream or cottage cheese.  I will definetly make this one again!

I thought this recipe was interesting, but I felt awkward making mac and cheese with cottage cheese and sour cream. Anyway, the flavor was pretty good, but overall I wasn't floored, and will keep looking for my favorite mac and cheese recipe elsewhere.

I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!  Very good and rich. No salt needed with this much cheese.  I did sub half of the sour cream with plain yogurt because I didn't have anough sour cream on hand. My husband, older son and I liked it, my 8 yr old wouldn't eat it though. 3 out of 4 say 'make it again'.

I followed he recipe exactly, and I'm not sure why so many people enjoyed this.  I felt the cottage cheese sour cream mixture made it too sour. It did make it moist, so maybe I'll try it  again with one or the other and more reg. cheese.

Only could find the 8oz cont of cottage cheese. seemed fine to me. I used ritz crackers crumbs, had no bread crumbs. Way too rich maybe would just leave off the topping. Otherwise what a recipe. A real keeper!!! Will always make this one now. THANKS CHUCK :)

My Dad said that this is the best macaroni and cheese he's ever had-and the rest of the family agrees.   This was refreshingly different but incredibly good. Thanks!  Suggestions for lower fat/calories: low fat cottage cheese instead of regular cottage cheese and minus the buttery bread crumb topping. Or just minus the butter equivalent.

This is really tasty.  I have made it several times for work and home and it is always devoured.  I do add just a tiny bit of milk and a couple dashes of Santa Maria seasoning.

I made this for the first time tonight. My 4 year old love mac & cheese and i've been searching for one to make for him. This was also the first time i've ever made it from scratch and not form a box. It was very yummy. It wasn't dry like some said. Although i did added a little light cream (i didn't have milk) just incase. I also only added a small amount of crumbs on top (used panko) Don't really wanna overload it :) Other then that i totally followed the recipe. My son ate it right up. It is definitely worth remaking. I'm even thinking of bringing it to my cousin's who will be hosting our family Thanksgiving dinner this year :)  EDIT.... Made this again but instead of normal mac i used the whole wheat type (hubby is trying to force better eating habits) Anyway, it came out just as good. You can't even tell it's whole wheat pasta. But the 2nd time around i forgot to add the Parmesan. I had no idea until after we finished it so it really didn't need it. Still just as good. And this dish i think actually taste better as leftovers :)

This was a good macaroni and cheese recipe, better than most that I have tried.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to add about 1/4 cup of milk as previously suggested and I added a little bit of butter to the actual sauce mixture.  It was very creamy and had a unique flavor.  Next time I make it I will probably add a bit more cheese, as the cheese flavor was a tiny bit lacking.

I made this as written, and it's pretty good! As other reviews have stated, it does get a bit dry, so next time I will add some milk. And reduce the amount of bread crumbs, I have no idea why I added the massive amount it called for! (I'm sure this is just the author's taste, it's not a big deal.) Also I will use an immersion blender to mix the cheeses SMOOTH next time. Sorry, I just like my mac and cheese creamy. BUT if you just make this as written, it is still very good!

good as is. also did 6oz sour cream, 1/2 c milk and that was good as well. i doubled it, put it in a big foil pan that was slightly deeper and bigger than a 9x13. baked for 35 mins. it was the right amount for a large group picnic.

This is an okay mac and cheese recipe.  It has good flavor, but the texture is not creamy at all, possibly add some milk too it. It definitely is better than recipes that use velveeta though.   Also it calls for entirely too much bread crumbs.  I'll be trying other recipes to find the perfect mac and cheese.

Wonderful!!  Only thing I did different was add 1/2-3/4c. evaporated milk.  It was delicious.  They scraped the pan and then wanted the recipe.  This is a winner!

Excellent. My husband said it was like his (now passed) Grandma's mac and cheese. The ultimate compliment! (I also reduced the bread crumbs and added 1/2 cup milk.)

This is similar to my own mac and cheese. I just leave out the cottage cheese. (only cause that's not something that's used in my house) It's nice to get measurements to something I've always "winged".

I really didnt enjoy this. It was dry and there were way to many bread crumbs. Maybe without them it would have been better

OMG... I doubled the recipe and it was more than enough for the six adults. So, so, so good. Followed recipe exactly and would only add more sharp cheddar next time - but wonderful as is. Thanks!

Quick and easy, but a little too tangy for my taste.   I would try it again using only 1/2 the amount of sour cream.  To reduce the fat & calories, I used 1% cottage cheese, light sour cream and topped it with Panko instead of buttered bread crumbs.

I ended up using more pasta, so I just added a little more of each of the ingredients and it worked out beautifully! This is very similar to a homemade mac n' cheese that is our family favorite. This one is now another favorite! Thank you!

This is a very easy mac-n-cheese to make, but it is a bit bland and not moist and cheesy enough for my taste.  I added a cup of diced ham and a few tablespoons of diced jalapeno pepper, which really picked up the flavor and added a bit of southwest kick.  I'm going to try this again but increasing the amount of cheese and sour cream a bit to see if I can make it  a bit more moist.

Whoever Chuck is, this recipe is fabulous. I don't really care for mac and cheese (too orange), but hubby likes it. The catch he doesn't do cottage cheese or sour cream. Told him I was making mac & cheese, he said are you sure?? I said, of course. He went to the store while the elbows were cooking. I put the rest of the ingredients  together, mixed well. Tossed in the elbows and put it into the oven by the time he returned. Store is 5 minutes away. He ate it and asked for seconds. HURRAY!!!! Had extra elbows and more cheeses and sour cream so I'll put it together and froze for another day. Thanks again.

For me, this was very bland. As others said, it lacked something, and the amount of breadcrumbs took away from the creaminess of the cheese sauce. I am a comfort food lover, and this was a big disappointment. I followed the recipe to a "T" and even doubled it because I expected to love it and freeze portions. Now I am stuck with a huge pan of tasteless noodles :(  I'll try to add a few things and hope to save it.

I made a few changes to this recipe to make it healthier, which is maybe why it didn't taste that great.  I used whole wheat pasta, 1/2 fat free cheddar cheese, 1/2 2% cheddar cheese, fat free cottage cheese, and lowfat sour cream.  I also added tomatoes, asparagus, and brocolli.  I also added some garlic powder, and the taste was still just kind of bla.  If I hadn't of added the vegetables, I think it would have been tasteless.  Though, that may be because I used all low fat ingredients.  I will not make it again as I always cook low fat.  I was really hopeful of this recipe from all the reviews, but it just wasn't for me.

Very good.  I did not add the parmesan or use the bread crumb mixture.  I added extra cheese to the top because I like that better.  I found whipped cottage cheese and used that.  I didn't think it was very creamy but I could have baked it to long.  All in all it had great flavor.

I was really sceptical about this one, but I'm glad I tried it. The cottage cheese threw me. I found it was even better the second day.  What I really like was that you didn't have to head milk or cream and melt the cheese.  It is really quick and easy!  I will definately make it again.

Was disappointed in this one. Not a creamy mac & cheese for sure. No one in my family liked it, not even the kids.  I like my mac& cheese creamy and this was by far not creamy. Will try another recipe that is creamy.

This was alright - if I made it again, I'd make changes - add more cheese and less bread crumbs.  We weren't a big fan of the crumb topping.  Next time I'll make a baked cheese topping instead.

I thought this was very good but maybe a bit too sharp tasting? I think I will try a different kind of cheese than cheddar next time because the sour cream adds plenty of tang on it's own.

This was the best Mac and Cheese I have tasted not like the traditional ones made with a white sauce.  The only change I made was to omit the bread crumbs I thought it just had way to much.

Good but not great. Definitely will cut the bread crumbs in half, way too much. It made it too dry. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and didn't care for this. Will try the Ritz cracker next time and add some mild like others suggested

I thought this was an ok recipe. It didn't have a lot of flavor and wasn't as cheesy as other recipes I've tried. I added a little bit of Frank's hot sauce to it to give it a little more flavor to use up some of the leftovers. If you haven't tried hot sauce in your mac and cheese you should try it!! It's awesome!

This wasn't bad, but probably not a recipe I would make again.  We found it bland and not really cheesy enough for our tastes.  The sour cream and cottage cheese made the cheddar and Parmesan barely noticable.  Thanks for letting me try your recipe though! (Edited because this is MUCH better the next day)

My three children are CRAZY about Mac and Cheese!  My five year old helped me make it and she was so excited.  She tasted it when it was done and said, "Mommy, it needs more flavor."  I completely agree.  The flavor of this dish is very mild.  It's not bad in any way, just bland.  I don't particularly like Mac and Cheese that tastes like biting into a spoon of pure cheese.  This dish went in the opposite direction though.  None of my kids ate an entire serving.  I only used half of the butter/bread crumb mixture and it was still too much for our liking.  Also, I agree that the recipe definitely needs milk.  I thought I added quite a bit of milk but it was still on the dry side.  I will be looking for a cheesier and moister mac and cheese recipe.

it had a nice taste but the texture was just not my thing...i even blended the cottage cheese into the milk to make it smoother...and it was still all seperated - the cheese wouldn't stick to the pasta at all... but the taste was good - and i really liked the bread crumb topping. i used olive oil instead of melted butter.

Not what I expected, but not bad overall. The cottage cheese made it seem more like a lasagna than mac and cheese.

DELISH! I added a cup of milk as suggested and let it bake for 45 so that I can get the pasta nice and tender.  I also added Parmesan to the top before I added the bread crumbs to add flavor.  I loved every bite.  It tasted even better the next day reheated!  AWESOME recipe!

The sour cream flavor was too strong, and there were still bits of cottage cheese after baking which were not very appealing (yes, I used small curd). The sauce was also a little thick and didn't coat the pasta well. I plan on using milk and ricotta next time to make the sauce. Good start to make my own recipe for oven mac-n-cheese.

I thought this was a good creamy recipe for mac and cheese.  Next time I think I will use less sour cream, cheddar cheese, and cottage cheese OR I need to add more noodles.  I cooked this in a 9X9 pan instead and did not top with bread crumbs.  I also used whole wheat pasta, low fat sour cream, and low fat cottage cheese and couldn't taste the difference.

Great macaroni and cheese, none of that processed junk.  A good base recipe but excellent for adding your own twist.  I cooked up some bacon and sauteed some leeks with a couple chipotle peppers.  Turned out great.

I really loved this mac and cheese! It taste kindof like a lasangna without tomatoe sauce. I did add some onion powder and used Ritz crackers in the place of bread crumbs. To this mixture I also added a little garlic powder which smelled like garlic bread when the butter and Ritz started to cook.  For some reason my husband doesn't like the taste of cottage cheese so he was not enthralled with my new favorite dish, but hey, more for me right? :)

Very good. I agree with Vicki adding 1/2 cup milk did make this creamier. I also reduced the amount of bread crumbs to about half. they just made it too dry. Best Mac n Cheese I've had in a looong time. Thanks Chuck!

This is the best Mac and Cheese recipe ever!!!  I'm not normally a fan of mac and cheese but the combination of cheese flavors is awesome!  I forgot one time to put the bread crumb topping on and the noodles got a little crunchy on the top, but it was still so good.  You've gotta try it.

The flavor was okay, but the texture was way off. Or perhaps that's the way it was supposed to taste. I added some milk but apparently not enough as this turned out dry, and the cheese curdled giving a grainy texture. Thanks anyway!

easy and great tasting recipe. like the fact that it doesn't require making a white sauce, just kind of dump it all together and bake!  I used whole grain macaroni, light sour cream, reduced fat cheddar and 1% fat cottage cheese to lessen the fat content. Still came together quite well and my fiance has already asked that I make it again

Very good - used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese and still tasted very rich and filling.  Should have followed others' recommendation to add some milk.  The leftovers were really dry.  My husband puts a little hot sauce and grilled chicken on his mac & cheese and I eat it as is.  Overall, a really good recipe... just needs a little tweaking if you plan on reheating leftovers.

Used LF CC and SC to cut some fat and it was still positively deadly.  Added garlic salt b/c I can't live without it, but it didn't really need it.  So easy too...don't have to mess around with a roux, etc.

I agree with many of the other reviews that this recipe needs milk.  It is dry if not.  I took this to a Mother's Day cookout made without changing the recipe, and everyone agreed it had a great flavor, but just wasn't creamy.  I think you could do away with the bread crumbs entirely, too.

I followed this recipe exactly and mine tasted a bit salty and also didn't come out creamy but perhaps I may have cooked to long. Also I should have cut the indgredients down for two. It made plenty and I am just one person.

This is a good mac and cheese recipe but very heavy. I also added 1 cup of milk as suggested by others and I think next time I would add 2+ cups of milk. Not creamy at all. Also added 3 cloves of garlic.

I am very picky about macaroni and cheese recipes but I really enjoyed this one! I was able to use low fat cottage cheese and sour cream to make the recipe healthier and it still taste great. Also, instead of mixing the bread crumbs with butter I sprayed them with nonstick spray before baking. I will make this recipe again!

Extremely TASTY!  I nearly double the cheddar, add just a little extra cottage and sour cream, about 50% more butter to the crumbs, and I also add garlic to the whole mix.  Oh, and rotini noddles are good too.  I call it heart attack mac when I make it...

Deliciousness! I made it the first time according to the recipe and it was FANTASTIC!!! I made it this time with 1/4 cup of half & half. I really couldn't tell a difference. By far my favorite mac & cheese!

This was so easy to prepare...loved that!  I've been trying to find a recipe with the "right" consistency for my family and this is it!  My girls ate it up, so my search is over.

We did not like this at all as it had very little cheese flavor. It was moist but not cheesy and lacked flavor. I guess we are not baked mac and cheese fans.

The worst thing about making mac and cheese dishes, is making the bechamel sauce. I didnt think this recipe was gonna work without it. This IS the best mac and cheese I have ever had. My family are VERY picky eaters and they said this was the best dinner I have ever made.  I felt like Super MOM! Altho, I believe this dish does better with a little milk added.(I eyeballed it, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk) This was very simple to throw together.  Thank you for the recipe.

I have to tell you that when I read this recipe I thought, "what is going to hold this together"?  No rue, no eggs, nothing that resembles glue!  So, I threw it in the oven and hoped for the best.  Well, I got the best!  OMG - this is to die for.  I made it exactly as instructed and even my daughter who hates my trying new mac and cheese recipes agreed that this was very, very good.  Thanks Chuck - this is now a staple in my recipe book!  Granted, it is not diet food - but it is pure comfort food!

I really like this recipe. It's very flexible in terms of the quantities and types of cheeses - I just use whatever I have on hand. Last time I used some cream cheese to supplement the recipe, and it was great. I also like to add chicken and veggies to make it more of a casserole. This recipe is a great base for personalizing.  p.s., The bread crumbs really add to the recipe - don't cut them!!

This is GREAT!  I did add one thing because it seemed quite a few people said it needed "something"...I added a thin layer of american cheese before sprinkling the bread crumbs over top.

One of the best mac & cheese recipes I've tried. I did add some dry mustard, worcestershire sauce, and some asiago cheese. I also used Panko bread crumbs for the topping. Fantastic recipe. Thanks for sharing. A big hit with my family.

Easy to make and everyone seemed to like it. Made ahead to the point of baking and then refrigerated until dinner time. Added extra cheese on top mixed with about 3/4 cup of panko and butter. Thanks!

Easiest mac & cheese recipe ever! Awesome texture, great taste, extremely easy! I forgoed the bread crumbs because my boyfriend and I don't like breadcrumbs. The second time I made this I sauteed some ground turkey in taco seasoning and added it to the mac & cheese. It was wonderfully delicious!

This recipe is missing something. I love the addition of cottage cheese, but the cheddar should maybe be a mix of Colby/Montery/Pepper Jack/Cheddar. Also, for the love of bacon, add fried/microwaved chopped bacon!

This was really good! I used whole wheat noodles and it still tasted great. I thought there it was a little heavy on the breadcrums so I'll half those the next time I make it...but will definitely make it again!

I don't understand the high rating of this recipe either.  It was ok and my 12 month old loved it but he was the only one who asked for seconds.  Maybe I'd have to be a die hard mac N cheese fan to love this recipe.

Super simple and quick recipe....However, I found it to be quite bland.  I would probably add some Worcestershire next time and perhaps some minced onion to give it some flavor.

I was so curious about how this would taste with the cottage cheese in it.  It was great!  I used fat free sour cream, 2% cheddar cheese, reduced fat parmesan cheese, and 1% cottage cheese.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

I have to admit, after reading many of the reviews I was expecting the mac of all mac and cheeses, but for me it just wasn't there. I'm not saying the recipe was bad, it just wasn't mouth watering and it certainly didn't get me excited. Part of the reason may be because I'm not really a mac and cheese type of girl, but I found that the whole thing wasn't too flavorful or particularly memorable. Perhaps I should have added those bread crumbs and butter which I skipped because they just didn't appeal to me. Everything else I kept exact (oh except I used 16oz of pasta instead of 8oz and I couldn't imagine using less, was that a typo??) I did however find it tasted better after reheating which was slightly odd, but good because most mac and cheese is horrid after reheating. All in all, it's a decent recipe, just not worth writing home about and I may hesitate before making it again. If you are a mac and cheese lover, give it a go, maybe it's just me.

I give this 5 stars even though I changed some things. Everyone has different tastes so I consider recipes to be a base to start with.  I sauteed pancetta, onions, and mushrooms, and also added some fresh sweet peas.  I cut the sour cream by 1/4 and added dry mustard and Thai chili powder for some punch.  I also added 1/4 cup of half and half, saving the rest to use when reheating.  I used Japanese panko for the breadcrumbs as a poster suggested and added the fresh grated parmesan to that.  That gave a nice crunchy crust but was a bit lighter than breadcrumbs and butter.  I would add that it is far easier to mix all of the wet ingredients, spices, and cheese in a large bowl before adding to the pasta and any additions.  That way you get a more consistent mixture.  My husband and I both grew up on baked homemade mac and cheese so this was right up our alley.  Delicious!  It IS rich but we used it as a side dish with a large green salad and lemon sorbet for dessert.  I will definitely make this again.

I definitely liked the cheese in this recipe.  It tasted great.  I would use more butter with the breadcrumbs because it can get a little dry.  Maybe if I baked it longer or broiled it, the top crust would have turned out better.  In any case, the flavour was perfect.

Best homemade mac and cheese I've ever had. I think I've finally found a recipe I'll use regularly.  Was out of normal breadcrumbs so I used panko, Japanese style breadcrumbs and was very satisfied with the results. To keep all the cheeses from separating, as a reviewer mentioned having problems with, I put all the ingredients that would be mixed in with the pasta through the food processor first and added a little bit of milk.  I even loved it day old and cold.

I was originally looking for a "sunset magazine" mac and cheese I made yrs ago, could'nt fid it so started searching. This was as close as it gets. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp dried mustard and cayenne pepper to spice things up. Added garlic salt to bread crumbs. Then I put in a pound of raw shrimp. (I cooked them for about 5 mins prior to adding to mac n cheese) Outstanding! Very sophisticated mac n cheese. This ones a keeper!

Best Mac and Cheese recipe I have found.  It didn't reheat very well, but that could have been operator error. Great flavor!!!! I did leave the bread crumbs out, just because I don't like bread crumbs on my Mac and Cheese.

I halved the recipe to make in a 8 x 8 pan.  Turned out very good.  My 11 year old didn't like it but my 9 year old did.  I couldn't decide if I should add milk or not, as per other reviewers.  In the end, I added about 2 Tbsp. of milk and extra cheddar cheese.  This is the kind of Mac-n-cheese I grew up with; the baked kind.  It was even good the next day.

I love rich, but this was a bit over the top for me.  Too rich for mac and cheese.  The kids had a mediocre reaction for it, and they're the reason I make mac and cheese.

Oh my God, this is so good! Thank  you to all the reviewers who said to add 1/2 cup of milk. I put it all in a 9 x 13 pan, added another 8 oz shredded cheddar and then topped it all with the bread crumbs. It is so good!!!!

This is an excellent mac & cheese!  I added in a little onion powder -  and as others suggested some milk to make more creamier (1/2 & 1/2 would be ideal!)  If you prefer "less homemade" you could substitute some of the sharp cheddar for velveta cheese.  I was low on parmesan cheese, so I threw in a little italian cheese blend.  If feeding a crowd you will want to double the recipe - this stuff goes fast!

I don't understand what is special about this one - especially for all the different ingredients required. It needs some milk or something to help all the cheeses melt together. It will be a long time before I make it again.

I thought this was very good...however the bread crumbs were a little overpowering. I usually like to try the original recipe as is first. So...good enough to make again with a few adjustments.

Excellent. My sister made this a few years ago for a family reunion and has been making it since. I decided to make it for myself. Instead of bread crumbs I used smashed cheese it's (all I had cracker wise). Still delicious!

This was good, but not my favourite.  I used whole wheat rotini and added about 1/2 cup of milk mixed with a tsp dry mustard and some paprika.  Hubby and I both found the sour cream/cottage cheese gave it a unique taste that wasn't typical mac and cheese to us.  Thanks anyway...will stick to my other recipe.

This is hands down the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. I found this recipe while trying to find food for my daughter first birthday party. I wanted kid friendly food that adults would still enjoy. This was perfect. Everyone at the party went on and on about it. I didn't do the bread crumbs topping as I was feeding 70 people so I was refilling constantly. I didn't tell anyone about the cottage cheese or sour cream until the end of the party. One friend who is one of those adults that still eats like a 5 yr old, kept saying how good it was and told his wife to get the recipe. As I was telling her his face just dropped and she started laughing and said he hates cottage cheese and sour cream. LOL! I used low fat cottage cheese and sour cream to save a few calories and it still turned out great. I make this all the time now and my whole family loves it.

This recipe can be made with low-fat milk, cottage cheese, sour cream and even low-fat cheddar, offering a more healthy alternative.  I add 1-2 tbl. Worstershire Sauce for a some zest.  Overall a good recipe, but best eaten the first day.  Not so good warmed up.

Yum.  So good.  My changes were to saute a minced onion in olive oil, add chopped mushrooms and a package of cooked frozen peas.  After macaroni has cooked, pour in back into the large pot it cooked in and add ALL the ingredient to it along with a 1/2 cup of milk.  Stir well then pour into baking dish.  Instead of the peas, broccoli would also be terrific.  Enjoy!

I'd say the recipe was okay. Reading other reviews, I agree that it was too dry. I like the creamy mac & cheese recipes. The bread crumbs were a bit too much and probably could have had more of the moist ingredients.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very dry.  Way to many bread crumbs.  My 11 year old nephew who LOVES mac and cheese didn't like it.

I didn't use the sour cheese, but it didn't matter. I used low fat cheese and multigran pasta. I think this is the healthiest mac n cheese will get and it was great. I will use this recipe again.

This was awesome!!I made as written except I used butter crackers for the topping. We love topping on our mac and cheese. As my kids say "It makes it more special". Next time I make this I'm going to take this advise of another and add some ham and our favorite vegetables. It will then become a one dish meal and I will LOVE that!!

This mac & cheese was good, but not GREAT. It came out a little dry and a little bland. Also! Beware the sour cream if you're serving to a crowd.. lactose intolerant guests didn't do so well with this one for me, despite the SC being baked..

Excellent! I made this for my son's 2nd birthday party and all the adults loved it as much as he did. It was creamy and tangy and really easy to make. Highly recommended for family gatherings and picky toddlers.

I was so happy my husband loved it! I also added a 1/2 cup of soy milk (my husband didn't even notice) and I also added chopped green chillis. Next time I might add some sausage. It was great as left over too.

The best Mac and Cheese I've ever had and my family loved it. Will definitely make again! The only different is I put half the amount of cottage cheese.

This was an awesome recipe. Following the recipe and taking into account some reviews by other people, I added 1/2 cup milk and Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs. For the topping I mixed some of the cheese with the crackers and butter it made a crunchy and sharp topping! Yum! Also, no one will notice using low fat ingredients...

Oh yum, this was fantastic!  The only sub was using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (it's all we had), all else was the same.  Great taste, really enjoyed the sour cream.  Will try it with added milk next time, or maybe an extra cup of cheese, but the recipe as is is delicious!  And soooo simple to make!

This recipe is the best combination of the dry Mom's old fashioned mac n' cheese, and the creamy mac n' cheese of current.  This recipe is excellent, and sure to please everyone.  I make this at least once a week, and I've brought it several fiend's homes (children included) with rave reviews.  The only thing I change is to add 1/2 tsp minced garlic and to add (as other's have suggested) 1/4-1/2 cup milk.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you.

Delicious!  I edited the recipe a bit for my family's taste.  Instead of shredded cheddar cheese I used shredded mozzarella and provolone cheese, I also added chopped smoked sausage and peas.  I think next time, for a little more flavor i will add sauteed onions.  My mother loved it!  And she hates Mac n Cheese.  She called this Gourmet Macaroni and Cheeses. (when i cook mac n cheese it's usually from the box)  What a nice and delicious change!

I have never left a review but have used this site for many years.  My 5 and 3 year-old boys were quiet during dinner because they were concentrating on their meal!!  We, as a family, really enjoyed this recipe--my boys wanted to know who Chuck was.  We prepared the recipe as is, but used a 7 x 11 dish--will probably modify to use fewer bread crumbs next time for this dish size, but my crust-loving guys (all 3) were very happy!

I've never made mac and cheese before, and wanted something simple, which this was.  It was absolutely delicious!  The only change that I made was adding one half cup of milk.  I'll definitely make this again, but next time leave off the topping.

This was good for a change but still a bit too dry for my taste. Also a lot more work than I usually put into macaroni and cheese. I grew up on a creamy mac and cheese so I guess I'm just not used to the drier baked versions. Still good though.

Very good mac & cheese.  I do admit I had to sub some stuff because I didn't have it on hand but even with the substitutions it was great.  I used 4 oz sharp cheddar, 4 oz velveeta, no cottage cheese (didn't have any) but used 1 egg instead, and used ritz crackers (about 10) on top. Plus I food processed all the cheeses with the egg and sour cream (great idea whoever said that!)  De-Lish!

This recipe is OK - nothing special. It was dry and was not creamy even though I added some milk to the cheese mixture.  I honestly don't understand the rave reviews.

Wasn't bad, but didn't fill my Mac n cheese craving.  Was a little bland/dry.  I would do it again but maybe add a little more Velveta type cheese, moisten it up.

I was a little skeptical about trying this recipe at first, but after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did, because it's so good!  It's quite a nice change from my usual mac'n'cheese.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to add less bread crumbs, since I felt that 1 c. was a little too much.

My family absolutely LOVED this Mac n Cheese recipe. I have served it at a potluck as well as for my in-laws all with rave reviews! Two have already asked me for the recipe! I did take a couple of suggestions from other posts, like added 1 cup of milk and covered the top with cheddar cheese instead of bread crumbs. Delicious!!

Hubby really loved this.  I thought it was good.  I didn't have any elbow mac so used egg noodles. I think it would have been better with elbow noodles.

This is the best mac and cheese I have made Homemade. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone was begging for the receipe! I do add a cup of milk to make it more moist! But over all 5 STARS!

This recipe turned out amazing and it is simple to make.  We made this as the main dish with green beans and salad on the side.  My 1.5 year old and husband both asked for seconds so it gets a 5.  I will be making this again.  I think I'll try adding grilled chicken next time.

Wow! This Mac lived up to all of my expectations. I followed the recipe to a "t" but added a lil' extra cheddar (because more is better, right?) and a little bit of half and half. This is so rich and delicious, you will not be disapointed.

I think this is more of a "creamy" mac and cheese than a "cheesy" mac and cheese.  I threw in a little more sharp cheddar than the recipe called for as well as a little colby.  I also added a little milk to keep it from drying.  I do think that the amount of crumb topping is too much.  I will cut it in half next time.  It overpowered the dish a little.  But overall it was good.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but it wasn't creamy or all that cheesy tasting... too many noodles possibly. I'm sure I will try it again.

This mac and cheese was very tasty, however, the appearance wasn't super appetizing. I think maybe mixing the cottage cheese with an electric mixer would make the consistency smoother. I added about a half cup of milk and it still got a bit dry. Overall, this was flavorful and I would like to make it again sometime. Thank you!

I made this for a family dinner and asked my guests to rate it. They gave it a three but I think most of the blame is with me for using too much macaroni which made it a little bit dry and bland. So I gave it a four and will definitely try it again. It was very easy to make.

Just didn't have enough flavor for me. I might add some kind of meat next time, maybe a little big of milk or cream to make it a bit creamier. Less breadcrumbs are necessary. Maybe some random spices would've spruced it up. I guess it's all about personal preference because people really liked it at the party I brought it to!

Just OK. Decent flavor but completely dry.  I was supposed to have company over the night I made this - there was a storm and they didn't come over - I a thankful because I would have not wanted to serve this to them.  I won't be making it again.

This is BY FAR the best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten. Better even than my Grandma's and I didn't think that was possible.

I was a little concerned about the cottage cheese, but WOW this is good!! This is now Stacey's favorite mac and cheese too!

My first attempt at Mac and Cheese, and it was  good! I added chopped ham and peas, and used italian bread crumbs. Also used light cheddar, fat free cottage cheese and fat free sour cream to make it a bit healthier. And half a cup of skim milk. Also, I minced half a cup of onion, and used 3 cloves of garlic, minced. Didn't add a touch of salt. With the ham and cheese, and the seasoned bread crumbs, it didn't need it at all.

I'm pretty sure this is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had. And I really am snobby about mac&cheese and am a big fan.

My only qualm was that it's a little too rich. Maybe I should use fat free sour cream and cottage cheese as the other reviewer suggested. I didn't add milk so I hope it's not too dry as leftovers....

Overall though, this was amazing. I added bacon bits and peas and that made it even more tasty. Thanks Chuck!!

This was the BEST mac and cheese i've ever had!  It was very easy to make and I loved the flavors with the different kinds of cheese, using sour cream really gave it a unique taste that everyone seemed to really enjoy.  The only change I made was I used italian bread crumbs instead which added an even better flavor to everything.  I will definately make this again.

Soooo good and cheesy!  I didn't have cottage cheese so I used some mozza and cream cheese instead.  I also used about 1/2 to a cup of cream as suggested by others and added about a cup of grated marble cheese to top the casserole off. I did the bread crumb butter mixture but I think next time I would just omit it altogether as the recipes is quite decadent as it is.

The Basics of this dish are great! I did make some additions to it though. I added browned ground beef with sauteed garlic, shallots, scallion and mushrooms to the sauce. It was devoured. Loved the cream cheese and cottage cheese really added some great flavor.

This is my first time at mac n cheese and already I found a keeper. I agree with some of the other reviews about it not being creamy enough and that the bread crumb mixture was very dry. Next time I may try adding a can of cheese soup or a milk cheese combination and using PANKO as the topping. Do not make this dish for small children. It is not the average yellow creamy consistency. All the children in my sons pre k class opted for the other kraft looking dish. This is an awesome mac n cheese! Next time I will just tweak it a little.

Flavor is undoubtedly yummy, however while I didn't mind the consistency, I think I would like it better if the "sauce" was more "saucey" and smooth.  I ended up making a basic cheese sauce to spoon over it.  All in all a good recipe that I will make again.

I wasn't crazy about this. It was dry and I like my mac and cheese very creamy. I don't think I will make this again.

This was really good, I made it as written except I added more cheddar. Next time, I'm going to use more macaroni to stretch the servings. I am also going to add some half and half to make it more 'saucier' instead of goopy... does that even make sense? anyway, it had a really interesting flavor and I'll definitely be making this again!

This is good.  I did use more pasta than the recipe called for and added another 8 oz. bag of cheddar and some milk.  I actually think it tasted much better on the second day.

I loved this recipe. I would have given it 5 stars but I altered it a bit according to other's reviews. I added a 1/4 c. 1/2&1/2. I also used 12 oz of sharp cheddar and added crumbled bacon. It was a big hit.

I used fat free cottage cheese and sour cream, didn't add the butter, but just sprinkled crumbs over the top. It was very good and my husband raved over it. I also added fresh tomatoes as others suggested.

It's not like Kraft but my husband loved it... and he is VERY picky.  I just sprinkled the bread crumbs on top and then drizzled the melted butter over top.  I also added Broccoli and used shredded parmesan instead of grated.  Very delicious!

Good texture, pretty creamy after adding 1/4c milk. However, it was almost tasteless, except for the breadcrumbs which i had reduced to 1/4c as well. Next time, I'll increase the amount of sharp cheddar and try adding some garlic or cayenne or basil and oregano, anything i can find to give this creamy casserole better flavor than that of a balloon. i added salt and pepper, but that was not nearly strong enough.

This is probably one of the best homemade mac and cheese recipes I've tried yet.  I did add about 1/2 cup milk, but I think I need to add a little more...I like my leftovers to be pretty "wet."  I also just added about 1/4 cup crushed crackers over the top instead of the bread crumbs and butter...it turned out great!

This was VERY tasty.  I left the bread crumbs off the top as I don't care for "crusts."  My kids, however, didn't really care for it.  Maybe it was too rich for them.  In any event it was delicious.

I have searched long and hard for the perfect mac & cheese recipe.  I finally found it.  I used 16 oz of cheddar and it turned out wonderful.  I also added a little cream that i had in the fridge to keep it moist per other reviewers.  This will be my staple mac & cheese recipe from now on.

This was good.  Wasn't the best mac and cheese I've had.  It didn't have that creamy texture everyone is raving about...maybe I used too much macaroni?  It was good but I probably will try other mac and cheese recipes on this site.

I thought this was very good especially considering how easy it was. I have been looking for a recipe that would be close to the frozen Stouffers mac and cheese because my kids love that. This was not creamy enough for them but maybe I can eventually get them to convert. I also used low or non fat sour cream and cottage cheese and like that I can get some fat out. I only buy Barillas Extra in dried pasta and their box is 14.5 ounces so not enough to quite double the recipe that I needed to do. So while my proportions were not quite right, it was still tasty.

I think the recipe has potential. I added some broccoli and some ground chillis. It added an extra flare. I would take it easy with the cottage cheese (1/2 cup) and add more sour cream (1/3 cup more) and add more cheddar cheese (1/2 cup) and parmesan (1/2 cup more).

This was a hit in my house!! Even my 4 year old daughter replied "Mommy, this is sooo good!" ..and she's my toughest critic! lol I like to add my own personal touches to recipes =) Used a 16 oz. box of penne. Added garlic salt, black pepper and a little paprika. About a 1/4 cup raw onion and 1/2 cup skim milk.  Topped with french fried onions. omg! Indulgent!  Served with sauteed smoked sausage and a crisp salad. You have to try it!! =) Thanks Chuck!

Well first off, I'm not very exposed to macaroni and cheese, so I decided to use this recipe. It wasn't enough to fill the 9x13 baking dish, so I had to add one more cup of macaroni at the last minute. To make sure that the recipe wouldn't be dry afterwards, I added one cup of milk, as well as some mozzarella cheese. 

It looked and tasted great, for about 5 minutes. When I came back later on for just a bit, the cheese and macaroni were all clumped up (i.e, some parts were really salty and cheesy, while some parts had NO cheese and NO taste), it was too dry, and WAY too hard. I was hoping for some nice, stretchy and soft macaroni and cheese, but sadly, this wasn't it.

Finally!  I have found the recipe that my kids and hubby and I all love.  What a wonderful combo.  I was skeptical of the cottage cheese, but it makes it so creamy.  I also added milk around the edges of the pan before baking.  Truly wonderful.

I like this a lot, although it does not taste like macaroni and cheese to me.  I was able to esemble this very quickly and it still tasted great even though I used fat free dairy products.

I'm  new to this site but find many similarities of common recipes I've tried - Macaroni and cheese, another family favorite! Ok,so try this recipe my omitting the cottage cheese, replacing w/jar of double cheddar cheese sauce, blend w/sour cream, 1/2 stick butter,1/2 c. buttermilk and cooked macaroni. Season w/white pepper and dash of seasoned salt then multi-layer mixture w/parmesan and 4-6 oz. grated cheddar cheeses. 

p/s GodivaGirl - you are all that! I love beautiful foods and you have the pictures to prove it!

I would give this 2 stars but my family enjoyed it so I'm going off their reviews.   I added a 1/2 cup of milk per other reviews and it came out perfect.  I also added ham for some flavor.  The family enjoyed it.  I think I might stick to box macaroni and cheese!

This is good, but a bit bland.  I added
ground chipotle pepper to the cheese sauce as well as to the topping which I made with panko flakes.

My family enjoyed this recipe, but we didn't care too much for the breadcrumbs on top.  I don't know if I just don't know how to cook with breadcrumbs, or if we just don't like them!  Regardless, next time I make this I'll just leave them off.

Excellent.  I actually made this for a group as a side dish.  They loved it.  I followed the recipe but did add a little garlic powder.  I liked it fresh from the oven.  I thought it had a tendency to be dry when served later but others liked it that way.  It really did have good flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly, and this was okay, but it definitely wasn't great.  Maybe I didn't add enough salt and pepper or should have tried extra sharp cheddar...it just didn't have a lot of flavor.

Really delicious.  A very different Mac and Cheese with a wonderful flavour.  I would not hesitate to make it a part of a company dinner.  Will make this one over and over.  

Also, I know the recipe added a 1/2 cup of milk to prevent drying out, but if you have a lot of leftovers and want to reheat more than once, no problem in adding milk again and again. Just pour over the top and reheat.  Yummy!!

Great flavor.  My family really enjoyed it and I will make it again.  I would like it to be a little creamier.  Next time I will add 16 oz sour cream or can of cheddar soup, maybe even both which is similar to a ham and noodles casserole I make.  The kids said more pepper.  I used 1/4 tsp but next time I will use 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp dry mustard and use a 9x9 pan. I didn't know if I would like cottage cheese in it but now I'll never make it without it.  Thanks.

This was VERY good. I doubled it (except for the crust). I also topped the noodles with some extra cheese before putting the bread crumbs on the very top.  It tasted like restaurant quality. Yummy!!!  Hubby and I both enjoyed it!

I love sour cream and cottage cheese in a mac a cheese.  This recipe turned out to be pretty tasty.  Only complaint was the texture of the grated cheese.  I didn't find the overall texture smooth enough to be a great mac and cheese.  Maybe some milk would have helped?

With the amount of mac n' cheese my kids eat, I wanted to find something healthier.  They thought it "looked funny" but ate it so well it was quiet at the dinner table.  I skipped the butter for bread crumb topping and just sprinkled on bread crumbs. Excellent!

The flavor was great - I used triscuits to top as recommended by someone else and the crust was great!  However the left overs were super dry even with the added milk.  I re-heated with some cottage cheese and that worked well.  Thanks for sharing!

This was SO delicious!  Words can't even describe.  I usually use a recipe that has cream, butter, etc...and takes twice as long to make.  Never again...who would have thought cottage cheese & sour cream in mac & cheese!  It tastes just like homestyle mac and cheese.  Will use over and over again.  I added a little onion to mine b/c thats how we like our mac & cheese...

I really liked this, it had a very mellow but yummy flavor, and it was nice and creamy. The topping was super yummy too. I liked that it stayed creamy while baking, alot of times baked mac and cheese gets hard on the top, but not this one. I'll make this again.

This is so tasty! I admit that I omitted the bread crumbs, but it is only because I was in a giant hurry and the two minutes it would have taken to mix the melted butter and bread crumbs was more than I could spare. My husband loved this. My daughter said it was super cheesy. Yum!

This recipe was easy to make, and delicious. As per others comments, I added some milk and used less breadcrumbs than stated. I will certainly make this again!

Yummy, but dry.  I reduced the breadcrumbs and added milk, but it still seemed too dry.  The kids didn't eat it (guess nothing compares with the blue box:) but I loved it.  The texture would be improved with a bit more milk, but the taste is great.

Great yummy mac & cheese.  I followed others' advice re: adding more liquid (I added 1/2 C of cream!) & less bread crumbs, and I also used some tangier cheeses (Italian blend) and added a little minced onion, dijon mustard and dash of cayenne pepper.  Would definitely make again!

This is so good, and I don't even like mac & cheese!
I made it for my wife, and she went wild over it. She
said it tasted like a gourmet version of the box kind.
I did follow other reviewers advice and added 1/2 of
milk to keep it from being too dry. I also left off the
bread-crumb topping, replacing it with more shredded
cheese, but other than that I followed the recipe to a
tee. A 5 star recipe that is highly recommended!

It was dry dry dry!!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I added milk, more cheese, more sour cream and made it palatable but it was no where near cheesy enough or creamy enough.

This Recipe was great. I made it for Easter Sunday, and everyone loved it. I substituted Fat Free Cheddar Cheese, Added Reduced Fat sour cream, 2% Milk, and Fat Free shredded Parmesan. It still came out wonderful, with a nice crust based. I devited slightly with the bread crumbs, but it was still wonderful.

We liked this recipe; it reminded me more of a casserole than of macaroni and cheese - not very saucy, but still good. We enjoyed the tangy flavor that the sour cream added. We skipped the breadcrumb topping, just because we like a creamy dish and added a bit more cheddar on top during the last few minutes of cooking. We'd make this one again.

Oddly delicious.  The sour cream adds a tangy flavor and a heaviness to the recipe.  I think if I made it again I would use less of the sour cream and more of the cheddar cheese.  I followed the advice of others and added in an extra 1/4 cup of milk, so it wasn't dry at all, even when reheated.  I took it to a group lunch and everyone seemed to really like it.

Definitely a very good recipe.
I think the breadcrumbs enhance the recipe, as does the parmesan. I added finely chopped onions. I didn't add any milk to the recipe and left it in the oven for 30 minutes. It was definitely not too dry for me. I guess if you like a more "saucy" mac and cheese you might want to add some.
I will be making this again.

Good recipe, but needs some more layer to the flavors...a little more kick. Add some feta cheese, or some red pepper flakes...I did both.

This was so easy and tasted so good!  Anything my kids will happily eat always works for me.  They both had two servings, and I ate the rest for lunch the following day.  I was reading some reviews about the mac-n-cheese being dry.  We didn't notice this at all.

Kids loved this and easy enough for my six year old to do most of it. This barely fed five of us. This amount hardly filled a 9x13 pan. I recommend doubling it and putting it in a 9x13 for a much denser and heartier serving.  I am glad we added 1/2 cup of milk, ground mustard and cayenne pepper. It would have been too bland for me. We also added a clove of garlic to the bread crumbs. Definitely cut the topping in half. We used low-fat options and it was still pretty good.

We LOVE this recipe. I've made it several times (with a little extra milk). We're trying to go "low-fat" so I've made it with low-fat cottage cheese and sour cream and 1% milk, it tastes just the same! Leftovers? Even doubled the recipe and we never have any when I make this!!!

The cheese & noodles were absolutely delicious! There was way too much breadcrumb topping though. It coated the top so much you couldn't see the noodles. Next time I'll halve it.

This recipe was delicious!  I made the dish just like the recipe with two exceptions; I only had Italian bread crumbs at home so I used them and I added some onion flakes because our family loves onions.  I think I would like the plain bread crumbs even more and next time I may try real diced onions.  The whole family loved this recipe...and I will be making it again soon.  Thanks!!

Holy cheesiness!  Yummy, yum.  I made this as directed but did add 1/2 cup of milk as per other reviews.  It was EXTREMELY creamy and at first a bit liquidy though as it cooled it thickened.

I think next time i might try just 1/4 cup milk and see how that went but it was certainly ok with 1/2 cup, it just made me wonder if the milk was even necessary.

I used 1% cottage cheese, fat free sour cream, and 2% old cheddar and it was so yummy.  All of us loved in, even my 8 yo son who doesn't usually like mac n' cheese much at his up.  We will definitely be having this again.

I can't imagine saying this recipe was dry in any way...it was very creamy! Took the suggestion to add 1/2 cup milk and when I reheated this another day-i added a little more milk and stirred it half way through reheating...my husband doesnt usually like mac/cheese---loved this!

I thought this recipe was decent, but nothing to rave about.  I probably won't make it again, but I gave it four stars anyway since I did modify the recipe and used everything low fat.  Maybe if I had used the full fat versions it would have turned out better.  I also found that it was dry even though I had added an extra 1/2 cup of milk per other reviews.  I will say that my two year old son liked it a lot!

Excellent recipe, we no longer eat box!
I use no breadcrumbs or butter, too many extra calories! My fussiest eater requests this all the time, I make it weekly.

This was the dryest macaroni and cheese I have ever made.  Leftovers were good only when I mixed in 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of milk. It is quite tasty but oh so dry!!!

I don't know if it's fair to really rate this recipe because I did alter it.  I didn't have any cottage cheese so I omitted that and added some slices of american cheese to the top of the noodles halfway through baking.  My 7 year old LOVED it and had 2 helpings, but my 4 year old and 2 year old wanted no part of it.  I think the cheddar was too sharp for them. I also added some milk which made it creamier.  And I skipped the breadcrumbs.   I think this is a great recipe for adults to "fancy up" mac n cheese, but if you have picky kids, try another recipe.

This was pretty good!  This was my first time making "real" mac and cheese, and not the kind that comes in a yellow box, and we all liked it.  I did add some milk to help with the consistency, and I might need to add a little more next time as we like ours creamy.  I didn't dare tell my kids that it had cottage cheese in it, and they loved it!

My daughter asked me for a dish she could take to a luncheon for a play group of 3 & 4 year olds & parents. I suggested this one, after I'd tried it & thought it was wonderful. It was a BIG hit! When I made it, I added a little sauteed onion & bell pepper, a few ounces of Velveeta &, instead of the bread crumbs, I used French fried onions on top. Absolutely yummy !

YUMMMMMMYYY!!! I followed this exactly, but I felt as if there was too much topping to go on top so I only used half. This is excellent. I never would have thought of cottage cheese in my macaroni!

This is the best mac and cheese recipe I have ever tried. Very easy to prepare and ultra creamy. Only thing I added was 1/2 cup milk as others suggested and I used less bread crumbs.

I didn't have any sharp cheddar cheese and so I used medium and it was really lacking in flavor. Make sure you use sharp. I will try it again and use sharp cheese and I am sure it will make a huge difference. I will also reduce the amount of bread crumb on top by half because it was just too much.

Pretty darn good. I took other users advice and added 1/2 cup milk to the mixture and it turned out perfectly! Also, I used a little olive oil to moisten the bread crumbs instead of the butter. My husband says this is a definite keeper. (Did I mention he also ate it the next morning for breakfast?!?!)

Super easy to make and fabulous tasting. The only thing I did different was to mix it in a bowl before adding it to the pan, and I had to use a smaller pan because that is all I had (8x8 I think).

Super cheesy tasting.  Creamy but not runny.  PERFECT!

My family loved this recipe!  I was looking for a different mac n cheese than my own.  I love the one that I make, but my one son doesn't like the tomatoes. That son actually wouldn't even try this new one, if you can believe that. In any case, I doubled the recipe, every ingredient, and it was outstanding. I actually used non-fat cottage cheese, reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese, and light sour cream to reduce some calories. I didn't have them on hand this time, but next time I will use whole wheat bread crumbs and whole wheat noodles.

Loved it.  However, use the sharp chedder. I added another 1/2 cup.  It is a nice alternative to the regular mac & cheese.  Minimal effort to prepare.

This is great and much easier than going through the normal process of making a roux and then a cheese sauce.  I added chopped up kielbasa and had a one dish wonder.  Great comfort food!

I have had this recipe on hand for a couple of years now, and I just finally got around to making it for a group of friends.  They loved it and gobbled the whole pan up in one sitting.  Very good, but probably will save for certain occasions.

I really wanted this to be fantastic, but not a single person wanted to eat it after the first bite and I ended up making peanut butter sandwiches for everyone to eat. I followed the directions exactly, but found the taste to be incredibly bland. I even tried to add some flavor after the first bite, and still ended up throwing the whole dish out. I think I will stick with another baked mac on this site.

great tasting mac and cheese & easy to prepare.  To make it more healthy I used Dreamfield's pasta which has a fiber added to it that cuts the carbs. I used panko bread crumbs and scattered cherry tomatoes on top. Yummy!

This was my first homemade mac and cheese .  It was delicious.  I did add a bit more cheese, though - just a small grab of each of the shredded cheese.  I also didn't use breadcrumbs, but only because I didn't have any on hand.  My husband loved it.  Will definitely make again!

If you've been to Atlanta and have tried the mac n' cheese at Mary Mac's Tearoom, it tastes exactly like that.  We made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit...soooo good!  I'm making it again this week for my office's holiday lunch and can't wait!

Sorry but I'm in the minority here...made exactly as indicated only added 1/2 c milk.  My husband was expecting my orig. made from scratch macaroni and didn't care for the strong "sour" flavor from the sour cream.  I should know better than to try anything new.  I thought it was good but he kept saying this sure isn't macaroni and cheese!  So...I have 3/4 of a pan to consume...thank anyway Chuck!

This was so yummy, my teenager LOVED this and that's saying a lot!  I increased the amount of noodles a little, as I don't like my mac and cheese to be too "saucy".  All we had was a 4-cheese blend, so I used that instead of the cheddar and I omitted the bread crumb topping as I was in a hurry, so good!

I wasn't overly impressed. There wasn't much to it, just a bunch of cheese and no real interesting flavors in there...sort of bland.  I'll probably add some thing else next time.

This was awesome! I did change quite a bit, but I'm sure it would be perfect as is. Didn't need to add milk. I think it would have been way too soupy. Did about 8 oz. more cheese than called for but really I don't think it was needed. I also added mozzarella (in place of one sour cream, monterrey jack (subbed some cheddar), and provolone and did not do the bread crumbs on top. Next time I might do about 1/2 the bread crumbs mixed with cheese on top.

yum yum yum!  Better than mac & cheese from box and very easy to make.  Would recommend this for any family gatherings...it won't last long!  I made it exactly as is...except instead of putting the bread crumbs on top I just added extra sharp cheddar on top and sprinkled some grated parmesan & romano on top of that. I also used mozzarella in addition to the sharp cheddar and that made it cheesier it seems. With this recipe you can't go wrong because you can put in any cheeses you like.  Very good and easy!

My family including five children loved this recipe! I did add more noodles since I didn't think it was going to be enough. This will definately be on the normal recipe list and one to use for families of new moms.

If you are a sharp cheese lover, then this is your dish! Didn't really change the recipe, but didn't measure carefully either. Used crushed Ritz crackers for buttered breadcrumbs and Irish cheese for parmesan. Excellent!

I must have done something wrong although I do not know how since this was the easiest recipe. It just did not taste right as the cheese taste was not consistent as it was not creamy. The nest day it was dried up and not good for left overs.

I really didn't care much for the tangy flavour that the cottage cheese and sour cream gave to this dish, even though I like both.  It wasn't like any 'macaroni and cheese' that I'd ever tasted, either in flavour or texture. I feel that the name is misleading.

That said, my two kids loved it and polished off the leftovers.

Despite being very easy, I don't think I'll be making this again.

incredible just as everyone describes.  through reading the reviews i added 1/2 cup of milk and didn't added the bread crumbs.  i also added a lot of extra cheese on top just because my bf and i are huge cheese fans.
only reason i give it 4 instead of 5 is because reheating it the next day it didn't taste good at all.  
but will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and we decided that it wasn't bad.  Next time we would lose the bread crumbs completely and add a more flavourful cheese.

This is one of the easiest mac and cheeses out there...so for the minimal effort put into it and the outcome is a pretty good payoff.

This got mixed reviews from "okay", to "ohmygosh this is good". I was somewhere in between. I'll probably make again, but it's not quite what I'm looking for.

I followed the advice of others here - only used about 1/4 c of Italian seasoned bread crumbs on top (though I could do without), 1/4 c of milk, and processed the cottage cheese.  Overall, I felt it needed - something.  

So, I used a parmesian/mozz. mix cheese and half a small jar of nacho cheese dip (sharp cheddar with hot peppers/spices) for a kick.  I also used more pasta than the recipe called for - closer to 12 oz.  

Pretty good change of pace.

It was ok.  Not real creamy and the bread gave it a wierd taste.  Maybe next time I'll add a bit of milk and maybe some garlic croutons instead of the bread.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was not all that great. I did not like the texture and the flavor was sort of bland. I did like what the cottage cheese added to the flavor. I may try this again, but adding more seasonings and cheese. I didn't add the topping as I've never had mac n cheese that way. Maybe next time.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I used this recipe more as a guide.  I did zero measuring, and just went with what looked right.  I used seashell pasta with peas (instead of the macaroni) and just barely sifted some bread crumbs on top.  I omitted the butter as this seems to have enough fat/calories packed in.  It was fabulous.  I wouldn't have come up with it on my own, but am so glad to have stumbled across it.  The kids loved it, too.  Will definitely do this again and again.

I found the macaroni and cheese to be just ok.  It is not like the creamy sauce I'm used to but more like stringy cheese attached to macaroni.  The dish tasted fine but the texture is not what I was looking for.

I didn't really like this.  I added a couple things that I thought would make it better, like a lil milk and butter.  I also used mild cheddar, a monterey jack blend, and some velveeta for some creamy texture.  I sprinkle a little paprika on the bread crumb topping also.

This was VERY VERY good. I was really surprised just how good it was. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs on top, but I recommend that you use your favorite flavor because the dish takes on a lot of the breadcrumb flavor. When you dish out a spoonful onto your plate the breadcrumbs, being there is a lot, (1 cup) fall onto the macaroni mixture and coating the macaroni even more. I kind of stirred it into the macaroni noodles to give it that extra nice coating.  I used the large macaroni. This is so easy to make and well worth it. Try it, you wont be disappointed.

followed recipe to a t.  for adults, the taste is wonderful but for kids, the sharp cheese is a bit overpowering.  served up creamy but as other reviewers said, ends up a bit on the dry side.  will make again though and use medium cheddar and add some milk.  thanks

This was really good! I thought as I was making it that it was going to be too thick. But it wasn't at all! It was great. I added a little too much salt, so it was a little more salty then I like. But that was my own fault. I will definetly make this again! (sans all the salt)

This is pretty good.  I had a college friend who made something similar so I was happy to find this recipe.  I cut down on the cottage cheese, butter, and omit the bread crumbs.  You can change this recipe to your liking and be fine.  If you prefer creamy macaroni & cheese like velvetta than you probably won't like this but if you like all kinds, give it a shot!

I thought this receipe was a little bland.  I think I'll cut half the cottage cheese next time and add more sharp cheddar for a stronger bite. Maybe add a little mustard, too. Great recipe to start with and adjust to your own tastes, though.

Very good. The only thing I did different was to use seasoned bread crumbs and used half of them and the butter. I baked it in an 8 X 8 dish. I wonder if those who thought it was dry used a whole pound of macaroni. Mine was very moist and tasty.

Didn't change a thing, however I did add some veggie burger to this and it tasted better than Hamburger Helper!  I love the sharp cheddar cheese flavor and the consistancy of the sour cream and cottage cheese added to the richness.  A keeper in my recipe files.  Thanks Chuck!

This was great, although I did make a few changes.  I added 1 tsp of ground mustard, and used about 1/3 c of bread crumbs, to which I added 1 tsp of oregano.  I did not add the butter to the topping.  Next time, I will probably puree the cottage cheese, but it was delicious the way it was.

This was really good! I only made a few changes. I used a (16 ounce) container of cottage cheese instead of a (12 ounce) container and I grated my own sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese. I also used Italian bread crumbs.

I liked the variation of this recipe but we felt it had too much breadcrumb topping. I will make it again but cut the crumbs in half! The little one loved it as mac and cheese is her favorite!!

This mac and cheese was cheap, easy and delicious.  I would suggest shredding your own 8-10 oz block of sharp cheddar for better flavor, I also added a tsp brown mustard and some dashes of hot sauce for flavor.  My only change will be omitting the butter from the topping.  Rather than mixing it into the breadcrumbs I had cut the butter into small cubes and dotted the casserole with it which lead to it being greasier than necessary.  Frankly I don't think this needs any butter as there's plenty of dairy to begin with.  Very good though.

Unique ingredients - but quite average result.  It was good - but I think it needs more cheese.  To me it was just a side dish rather than a meal without the flair I was expecting.  MORE CHEESE!

This was dry although I added milk and was not "cheesy" enough.

Really delicious! I added a tsp of dry mustard and used cracker crumbs with melted margarine.  MUCH much better than the box and not much more work.  In a pinch, I have cooked the mac in the micro. but this has to be baked to get that wonderful brown cheese. Yum.

I thought this was just OK but my family really enjoyed it so I gave it 4 stars instead of my 3 star impression. It was easy to throw together and a change of pace from the usual.

It was okay. I made it exactly as shown on the recipe it was just okay. If you don't love cottage cheese (i dont) then there may be too much in this mac and cheese recpie. Next time I'll go with a little less.

Not your typical mac 'n' cheese, but such a simple recipe! Being able to combine everything in the 9x13 pan eliminates a bowl and just makes it so quick! Everyone likes it, including my 15 month old!

This truly is the best mac and cheese.  My husband craves it all the time!  Don't expect that artifical yellow color you get from a box.  Use really good sharp cheese, it makes it that much better!

Delicious! This is a nice change to my same old mac and cheese recipe. I didn't measure the ingredients and it turned out a little dry, but the flavor was excellent. Next time, I'll measure everything and I'm sure it will be even better. Thanks!

I wasn't too crazy about it, but my family loved it!  If I make this again I would definitely use 2% large curd cottage cheese.  I used fat free dry curd and I think that is what I didn't like, but everyone else like it.

This is the best home-made mac n cheese recipe I have ever tasted.  I put this on my "make-again" list and was asked for the recipe.  I did make 2 minor changes due to comments made by other reviewers.  I added a small amount of butter, and about 4-5 Tbsp. of milk (or heavy cream, both are good)  The mac n cheese was not a bit dry and was deliciously cheesy!

I made this dish and was okay.  I didnt have plain bread crumbs on hand so i used Italian flavored and made it a bit salty.  Didn't fee it was "cheesy" enough.

This was a great macaroni and cheese recipe.  My wife and I loved the way the sour cream gave the cheese sauce a nice flavor.  I used to make macaroni and cheese a little differently but this is the recipe that I will use from now on.  If anyone wants to try a new macaroni and cheese recipe then this one is for you to try.

Fantastic!!!! I needed a mac & cheese recipe for a dinner I was preparing for my wife's work. I used Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese recipe for the first time and it was a hit. All the women at my wife's work now beg me about once a month to come and cook for them, as long as I make my mac & cheese for them.

I used roasted garlic breadcrumbs to give it flavor. I really enjoyed this recipe. Makes plenty of macaroni. I will try this again.

We loved this recipe.  It is a great twist from the traditional mac and cheese.  I will definitely make this again....very soon!

I can't beleive the simple yet awesome taste this recipe makes. I have made a few changes including nuking it to melt the cheese and using ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese. I also crumble crackers instead of bread crumbs. I've made this for picnics, parties and just because meals without problems. It's too good to keep to myself. Thanks Chuck where ever you are!

I chose this recipe because I had some leftover cottage cheese I didn't know what to do with.  The consistency was fine and the flavor was unique, but I don't think I would make this again.  It got a mixed review in my house.

I liked this recipe...not as cheesy as i might have liked but I am sure next time we can add more cheese...I added more topping to mine because I think its one of the best parts...I added some paprika to the topping for a little more flavor.  I will say that the cayenne does give it a little added kick that is welcome!

This was pretty good. Everyone was happy. No complaints but nobody raved, either. I would make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe (my husband was not as enthusiastic as I was).  The ingredients added a unique texture, and it was even better as "left-overs!"

I really enjoyed this recipe. It makes a slightly different style of mac-n-cheese so it is nice for a change of pace. My husband prefers a creamier version so I take turns making this recipe and another. I have used cracker crumbs, cornflake crumbs and even potato chips crumbs as topping and they are all good.

I find that this was a very good recipe.  However, the taste of sour cream and parmesan can be pretty strong.  Fortunately I love those ingredients and so does my spouse!  My 14 month old wasn't too fond of the recipe though, probably because of the such strong taste, and this is the only reason why I gave this recipe 4 stars.

Delicious! With some green onions, hot sauce, and parsley thrown in, this dish was amazing.

Very good.  I will use less bread crumbs on top next time.
