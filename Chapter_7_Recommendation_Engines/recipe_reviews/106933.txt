Our girl scout troop makes these a little differently.  We cook the biscuits in butter on top of the camp stove.  Melt the butter first, add the biscuits to cover most of the pan. We don't bother cutting and rolling into a ball. Be careful to keep flame low or you'll end up with burned biscuits quickly. Add pats of butter on top as needed as biscuits cook; flip one time as you cook.  Roll the hot, buttery biscuits in the cinnamon sugar.  Delicious!  The girls hover to make sure the get them hot and fresh! If you do cook the biscuits on a stick over fire, I learned to sort of stretch the biscuit out and wrap it around the stick.  You'll end up with a long twisted breadstick shape that will cook more evenly over the camp fire.

This is a yummy recipe. However we make a little different.  First of all we use the biscuit with the bits of butter in them (Grands) then we cut them into 4ths and then roll them out like a snake and then wrap around a hot dog fork and cook until golden and then roll into butter and cinnamon sugar. The grands biscuits make a huge difference.

Based on the process I have to only give this a 3.  Our process is different but the results taste like Crispy Cremes! We simply place a coffee can on a rack with 2-3 cups of canola oil inside.  Make sure your rack is over the even coals. A raging fire will only be a disaster. Use the cheapest biscuits (10 per tube) and simply poke your finger in the center of each biscuit. We usually do this ahead of time and place them on a paper plate for easy access. Gently drop the biscuit in the hot oil.  You can cook 2 at a time and use a marshmallow fork to flip them after they turn golden brown.  Have a helper standing by with a brown lunch sack filled with 1 cup of sugar and some cinnamon to taste.  Place hot donuts in bag, close and shake.  They are then passed around the fire and you are lucky if you even get one!  Definately not a job for children though they do a great job of eating them up!  We usually make 6 tubes and it goes pretty quick.  I wear a headlamp so I can see them browning as it's usually a nighttime treat.

Made these donuts during our last camping trip. Sometimes the method worked sometimes it didnt. The trial and error of it made for some good laughs around the campfire. We rolled them in to balls, stretched them out and wrapped the roasting stick but found that cooking them in a pan over the fire in melted butter worked the best. I'm only giving it 3 stars because they only turned out half the time and talk about high cal/high fat. Doubt I'll make them again.

I used "Grands" biscuits and baked them rather than roasting on a spit.  Once dipped in melted butter, I rolled them in confectioner's sugar.  I used a pastry bag to pump red raspberry jam into some of them.  You've got to eat them while they are still warm.  Not bad for something so simple.

Great recipe and fun to make!!
I made smaller balls and lined them up in rows in a pam sprayed pie iron.  Makes it go a little faster for all your hungry campers.

This sounds great. We tried this while camping and did not have much success.  The dough did not want to cook all the way through, so the centers were very doughy.  If we left them over the fire the outsides were burnt to a crisp.  We did have a rather high flamed fire.  This may work better over a small hot coal fire.  I will try again with a different fire next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Great idea; a hit with the kids and the grown-ups!  Had the  7.5oz can size; cut the biscuits in half - worked great over hot coals. Didn't have white sugar, so used brown - delish! We couldn't make them fast enough. Will definitely be a new "tradition" for our campfires.

The kids loved these, but I too thought that they were basically biscuits with cinnamon and sugar. Some were a bit doughy in the center, but nice and golden on the outside. I guess I should've made them more on the crispy side like the picture shows. Thanks for something different to try!

WE ADD PECANS AS WELL AND ALSO USE THE LAYERED, FLAKY BISCUITS SPECIFICALLY. WE CALL THIS MONKEY BREAD AT OUR HOUSE. IT HAS BEEN A CHRISTMAS MORNING TRADITION SINCE I CAN REMEMBER. ALONG WITH SPARKLING CIDER AND QUICHE

This one has become a staple at our campfire outings!  My hubby is the king of cooking them...it does take some finesse when using marshmallow tongs.

The taste was great. It was hard to get the donuts baked all the way through without burning on the outside. So they all turned out a little doughy in the middle. It was a really messy recipe especially when camping.
