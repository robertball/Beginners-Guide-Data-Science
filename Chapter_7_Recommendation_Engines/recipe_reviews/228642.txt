This one of the best lamb recipes I have ever found. The marinade makes it. The flavor is bold but not overpowering. I made this recipe twice, once grilled and once broiled. It was excellent both ways. When weather doesn't allow grilling, broiling works as well. The only change I made in the marinade was using a tablespoon of chili sauce in place of chili paste. I will definitely use this recipe again

These were wonderful! Husband said make sure you know how to make these again! I didn't have any plain yogurt, so used real mayonnaise and only marinated for about an hour. These could be a new favorite!

Made this as kebabs. Delicious! I had this as one option in a meal for company that didn't really like lamb (and I don't necessarily either unless paired properly) and got lots of compliments. It was even good cold (which I don't think usually works for lamb).

I left some of the marinade on the lamb and broiled instead of grilling; it was fantastic!

Very simple and very tasty! Kids (8 and 10) liked it. Would definitely make again. The rosemary wasn't overpowering which was good because so many recipes overpower the flavor of the lamb with rosemary or mint.  Will save some of the marinade next time (before I put the lamb in with it) to drizzle over top like the picture shows.  Might also increase the cinnamon a bit as it added a unique, but not overpowering flavor.

These were crazy delicious.  No changes.  Not necessary.  Two hours later we are still talking about how tender and tasty the chops were.

First try, with two chops and therefore inexact quantities of marinade ingredients, and it was still delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

WOW, I guess I LOVE lamb!!  I wanted to try and cook something new...I bought some lamb loin chops and scrolled through Allrecipes!  SO glad I did!  This recipe is absolutely the BOMB!  The lamb was so moist and delicious!  I also did not have yogurt, so I used real mayo.  I also cut up onion and added it to the marinade and cook on foil on the grill.  DEEElicious!!!  Making it again, tonight!  Just for me!

The lemon flavor was a bit too strong - will try a small lemon instead of a large lemon next time.  Mine required longer cook time than 3-4 min per side.

I used lamp crown chops (sliced separately) and cooked for 3 minutes on the first side, 2 minutes on the second side.  Watch to not cook it longer; these burn easily.  My wife loved the single leftover chop as an appetizer the next day.

This was an excellent marinade. I used it on loin chops, marinated for 6 hrs. Really “soaked” into the lamb.
