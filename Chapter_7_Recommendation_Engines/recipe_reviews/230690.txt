I really liked this recipe. It is very clean and simple. Not too many flavors going on to confuse the palette, but still very tasty. I doubled the recipe and used jrbaker's tip and added about 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of chili powder. Also, I baked it in the oven rather than nuking it. Turned out great!!

this recipe is very good for a quick yummy  snack. I find it is also beneficial to add a bit of lemon juice and diced tomatoes.

Good Stuff! Very easy to make and tastes great. Made it twice. First, just as written except I mixed the cheese in and did not cook it. Second, no cheese but added a little chili and cumin. Very good either way and a nice change from guacamole.

When I made this dip, I decided to keep it cold. I added a layer of hot sauce,some cilantro and cumin, followed by shredded cheese and topped it off with sour cream. I preferred it with my modifications. It was a good base for what I wanted to make.

I really liked the simplicity of this recipe.  It tastes very clean, and would also be good with the addition of some cumin and chili powder.  Easy, simple, and good is always a winner in my book!

This is a very good recipe, as written!  I did some playing around with it and added some chopped grape tomatoes and green onion along with some additional garlic.  I left the cheese out and served it cold and discovered that it is very tasty that way, as well!  Thanks for the great recipe, Beebzz!!!

This is so delicious and so simple to make.  I made it basically by the recipe.  I had read the reviews though and noticed that several people had added salsa so I did the same.  The only other alteration was I used the entire can, but only because I reread the instructions  after I had added most of the ingredients and noticed it said 1/2 can.  It still turned out great.  I really liked the lemon.  It added the right kiss to finish it off.

Thank you!! I didn't know what I was gonna make for dinner, looked on AR for something with black beans but everything looked too involved or I didn't have the right ingredients...then I ran across this simple and delicious recipe! I took the advice of reviewers and added some chopped tomatoes, chili powder and cumin. Mixed it all together spread into a 9Ã—13, sprinkled cheddar on top and baked just long enough to melt the cheese. Served on top of baked (to make them crunchy) corn tortillas. Perfect easy and quick!

My middle son devoured this.  I am considering making a large batch and freezing it in small containers for his school lunch.  It's a nice change from guacamole.

Awesome & versatile! I made this last night & served it with homemade chicken tacos. They were devoured! I had extra leftover, so I had it with my breakfast tacos this morning. Fabulous!

Great appetizer. This was a hit @ our family bbq.  I added minced jalapeÃ±os for a bit of a kick. Gonna add this recipe as a regular.

Good recipe. Used 2 cloves of garlic and added some fresh cilantro. Also used Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar.  Passed the kid test with flying colors!

Easy to make even if you don't have a microwave (like me!), just heat up the beans, mash them when they're done, then add and mix in all the other ingredients. I've used it on crackers, tortillas and as a cold dip for nachos. Always a winner!

This made for a quick and easy snack. I was confused if the beans and avocado were mashed together because of the picture. I just mixed the beans in initially. The color gets a funky green brown if mashed together I found. I thought the lime was quite pronounced. It did give it a fresh flavor. Not my favorite bean dip, but it was gone fast.
