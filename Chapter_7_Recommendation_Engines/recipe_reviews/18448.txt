This is a great tasting soup!  I did it in a crockpot without any of the extra steps. Chicken and roux and rice were all raw.  Just combined everything, set it on low and walked away. I added the cream/milk just before serving. It still turned out great and was super easy! 
Recipe survives well with substitutes or omissions: oil instead of butter, milk instead of cream, no mushrooms, etc.  I used the food processor to chop all of the veggies fast and easy.  Great recipe.

Since moving to Minnesota, I've tried several wild rice soup recipes - this is the best yet.  Several steps can be completed the nite before - cooking/cubing the chicken, cooking the rice, etc.  I've found that the key is to learn how to cook wild rice first - I always use 4 cups of water to one cup wild rice with a tsp of salt and boil it for approx. 40-50 minutes.  Then I divide it into to large baggies of 2 cups each, which can be frozen for later use.  I added 8 slices of cooked and crumbled bacon, substituted garlic salt for the salt, and ommitted the curry and mustard powders.  I also used 3 cups of cooked wild rice instead of two.  A GREAT recipe that I will use again.

This is the second time I've made this soup, and had to jump on here and give it 5 stars!!   This soup is naughty but oh so nice  :-)   One observation and one suggestion.   Observation:  Don't worry about the flour "clumping" when you add it to the veggies....the clumps cook out!   Suggestion:  Double the Curry.  This ingredient sounded strange to me when I first looked at the recipe, but believe me it's the *KEY* to this soup.   Well any type of chicken based soup, so I'm told.   Who would have ever thought Curry makes chicken soup more "chickeny"!!   Enjoy, it's awesome.

I read through the reviews before I made this recipe, this way I'd know where to make changes and not risk wasting ingredients. I used a quarter of the butter called for in this recipe and added in just a little extra virgin olive oil to keep the butter from scorching. I did double the mushrooms and I added in quite a bit of fresh minced garlic. I did not need the flour or the salt. I used all organic chicken broth. To cut back on the fat, I used 1/3 cup fat free half-n-half and that was all I needed to make this a creamy soup plus it made it thicker without needing the flour. I did not add the mustard powder as I didn't have any. This is very good, though after tasting it, I did add in more curry powder. The almonds were just right in this soup, just wonderful. I would have never thought of that.

Oh my goodness!  This is fantabulous tasting!  I added a bit more curry than called for, and made a double batch.  Freezes and reheats wonderfully, so make extra and take a night off in the kitchen.  (Hint: use an ice cream bucket that fits in your crock pot to freeze left-overs, and you'll have an easy meal.  Just remove frozen soup from ice cream bucket, place in crock pot on low, and come home to a delicious meal.  Hubby said the house smelled fantastic when he got home!

Great soup. I made changes. Less flour, 2% milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2, Beer instead of Sherry, Dijon mustard instead of mustard powder, used wild rice, brown rice and basmatti for a total of 3 cups cooked rice, combo of butter and olive oil to make roux, no almonds. Turned out FANTASTIC! Will make again and again!

Excellent, excellent recipe, Sue!  I made this on a rainy Friday afternoon after a long day at work, and it was remarkably easy and very tasty!  My two roommates and I feasted on this with toasted wheatberry bread...  They raved about it!  I baked the boneless, skinless chicken breasts (brushed with extra-virgin olive oil, sprinkled with marjoram, thyme, oregano, a little salt & pepper, then baked at 450 for 30-35 min.)  Turned out great!  This is definitely a keeper!  I even sent a copy of your fabulous recipe to my mother (a native Minnesotan from Hibbing).  Thanks!

When I made this the first time (OH MY!!), it was soooooo good!  Unfortunately for me, I had friends over--they ate every morsel, leaving nothing for me!!  Okay, the first time...I used the crockpot.  After much online research, I sauted the onions, celery and carrots, mushrooms and then added the flour and the chicken broth.  Then I put this mix and the rest of the ingredients (except the half and half) in my crockpot on low for 8 hours (I added the half and half the last hour).  I used a can of cooked wild rice soup, by the way.  THIS is the way you do it if you want to use a crockpot.

The second time I made this, per another poster's advice, I was lazy and put EVERYTHING in the crockpot for 8 hours (added the half and half the last hour).  Bad idea!  It was very watery, the carrots and the celery were hard (even after 8 hours!), and the soup was bland.  

Anyway, this is the BEST wild rice soup recipe ever!  I will definitely make it again, the way I made it the first time.  I just have to saute the veggies before crockpotting them.  

YUM!!!

Hubs and I weren't fond of this at all.  Other than using rotisserie chicken and shortening the cooking time accordingly, I stuck to the recipe like science.  So, against my better judgement, I watched the vegetables swim, not saute, in a stick of butter. And then I winced a little as I added the entire 3/4 cup of flour. I tasted it after seasoning it with the curry and mustard powder which I not only found odd, but unpleasant. After stirring in the almonds I discovered I didn't care for that either. Finally, to this thick concoction I added the prescribed pint of half-and-half. Rather than hearty, creamy and satisfying, I found this excessively thick and floury with a flavor that didn't seem quite appropriate for a chicken wild rice soup.

Fantastic! Being a Minnesotan, I've tried many different versions of this thick, creamy soup and this one is definitely the best.  I made it low fat by using nonfat half and half and only a tablespoon of olive oil in place of the butter. Delicious!

I chose this recipe over another chicken & wild rice soup recipe because it used all "from scratch" ingredients & had more veggies. I prefer real wild rice to the boxed stuff any day! We enjoyed this soup with just a few changes: less butter (1/4c) with 2T olive oil, less flour (1/2c), more curry powder (2t), more wild rice (2.5c), add 1/4t thyme, & next time I will leave out the almonds.  Overall, it turned out well and I will make it again. We really liked the curry flavor and the rich & creamy broth. A very beautiful soup when all is said and done. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I wanted to make a soup that both tasted great and was easy to make.  I chose the right one.  This soup was rich and creamy and had just the perfect amount of seasoning.  I left out the sherry and almonds and it was still delicious.  I will certainly be making this again soon!

this soup was alright.  my whole family enjoyed it, but to me it tasted more like chicken ala king (it was definitely not a soup).  I don't think i'll make this again.

Good soup. I threw it all in the crock pot and let it cook all day. I wasn't sure about the flour but I put it in anyways and it turned out. Poured the milk in an hour before serving. Used more curry and mustard powder.

We made this soup the other night and my husband ate 3 bowls, after that he mentioned he could really eat a fourth bowl since it was so delicious. This is not likely for him to go on like that. I did add one cup of white rice to the recipe, along with more carrots. I also cut back on the Sherry and used 1 tablespoon + 1 tsp (like I do for my cream of Mushroom soup). I kept some of the hot broth separate and then opted to add cornstarch mixed with cold water in place of the flour/butter roux. I then added it back to the soup pot. It thickened beautifully. Not real thick, just right. All other ingredients were followed as posted. This soup has a fine gourmet essence about it. We are very particular about what sounds good to us and we make lots of soups from scratch and this has now become one of our favorites. Thank you for sharing this keeper with us. It also reheats the next day and tastes just as wonderful...Thank You Sue!

I'm going to break the trend here...I made this soup last night for dinner - exactly as stated in the recipe - and we did not care for it at all. It came out much thicker than I expected (all the flour) and the color was not very pleasing. It did smell great and the flavor wasn't bad...but the thick texture and color didn't make it very appetizing.

Fantasic soup, people will ask for it again and again. To make it even better, buy a roasted chicken from the supermarket. Take off the meat, you'll use that  for the chicken. Then, put the carcass and skin in a pot and pour broth over it, let it simmer for an hour. (I use 8 C broth.) Proceed as recipe calls for. Makes it unbelievably rich for very little extra effort.

I made it in the crockpot like a previous reviewer said she did - without all the extra steps - just put everything in the crockpot, stirred, turned on low and walked away.  I used left over turkey from Christmas and used Uncle Ben's Chicken and Wild - including the seasoning packet.  I did put in 2% milk about 30 minutes  before serving.  Everyone ate seconds - so I will have to make after Christmas to have more to freeze!! Great Recipe - Thank you

This is really yummy. I used a wild rice/brown rice mix, doubled the curry powder as other reviewers suggested, also used a bit more mustard powder, and accidentally added way too much black pepper, but it ended up being okay! Used a bit less butter to lighten it up, added only 3 heaping tbsp of flour (and it was still a bit more thick than I usually like soup), used white wine in place of sherry and used fat free evaporated milk (a 370 ml can) in place of the 2 cups of half and half (used 1/2 cup more chicken broth to make up for some of the liquid). This is a very comfort-food soup!

This is WONDERFUL! Just made it tonight, used left-over T'giving turkey instead of chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe. Oh I did add extra rice since the pack I used made 3 cups. Spices are perfect, don't omit anything, including the almonds, they add a nice crunch. My DH has been craving the wild rice soup he's had at the Hilton in MinnMinn - he said this is as good if not better ('course he loves me, lol). Served it with salad and hot bread - perfect meal for a crisp fall evening. Thanks Sue!

This is like Panera's but much better!  I used all the meat leftover from a roasted chicken, pulling it by hand to the size pieces I like.  I used my homemade broth (also from the same roasted chicken) to cook the rice and for this recipe.  I left out the almonds and added white pepper.  Minced garlic was added to the celery/onion/carrot mix while sauteing.  Seasonings were measured "heaping".  I froze the leftovers right away, so I hope it reheats well.  DELICIOUS!

MN native and this is a fantastic chicken wild rice soup.  I've made it a couple times...with chicken and turkey.  Last time we used turkey and homemade turkey stock with some chicken broth added (only had 4 cups of homemade stock).  Cannot say enough good things.  Many people have commented on this being one of, if not THE, best CWR soups ever!  Highly recommend.

This was fabulous!  I used about half the butter plus a tablespoon of olive oil, and chopped pine nuts in place of the almonds.  Served with a great crusty Italian bread and nice red wine - PERFECT!  Thank you so much.

This was so good we absolutely loved it. Thank you for a very wonderful recipe. Next time we make it we need to make a double batch so that we can maybe freeze some. Next to the 
Grand Casino in Hinckley MN This is the best I have ever tried, & I have tried Many. Thank you Thank you Thank You!!!

loved this soup. Just a perfect early fall evening meal. I did omit the almonds and skipped the half  and  half. Accidentally forgot about the cream until half way through eating it. That was just fine though because it had a lot of flavor and creaminess without it. Loved the curry addition and the sherry. I will make this again. Really tasty.

Loved it! Doubled the curry as others suggested and added more wild rice than listed. It was a smash hit!

5 stars coming right up! Excellent taste, color, consistency and texture. If you chose to double up on the veggies and rice be sure to add extra chicken broth (at least a can) I added an extra 2 cups of chicken broth -it would have been crazy thick if I hadn't. I didn't have slivered almost so I toasted a cup of whole almonds and then chopped them- it really adds a neat dynamic to the soup. Loved the nutty-ness. Feel free to be liberal on the sherry and curry- they play the biggest part in the flavor. I was making multiple soups at once and didn't have a stock pot available so used my electric skillet- it worked great and found I could control the boil and simmer parts of the recipe as easier, if not easier than on a stove top.

This is the best! Supper good. There would be no problem using 1/3 less butter and substituting milk for the 1/2 & 1/2 it is rich and thick and yum. I have 2 in my family who don't like mushrooms they both has 2 big bowls. Try it with sour dough bread.

Based on taste I would give this recipe 5 stars.  But had to give it 4 stars due the fact that this soup goes beyond being just thick.  Definately thicker than any chowder I've ever seen.  I had to add an extra 6 cups of liquid (4 cups broth, 2 cups half & half...wanted it to still be creamy) to make it a soup and not a chicken and rice meal.  Other than adding liquid, I also added garlic with the onions/carrots, left out the almonds (my husband and daughter have nut allergies), and had a small amount left of spinach that I chopped and added in (next time will add more). Overall: DELICIOUS!!!  The family loved it and (with my own twist on it) have asked me to keep this in dinner rotation.  Served with salad and crusty bread.

My husband and 5 year old son loved this recipe.  It was very creamy and tasted great.  We bought some large bread rolls at the store and made bread bowls. The left-overs were great to.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

For crock-pot enthusiasts:

I made this recipe in the crockpot for 5 hours, and the flavor was wonderful! The veggies and chicken were cooked perfectly, and omitted the flour, 1/2 and 1/2. However, unlike what another reviewer said, you do not want to throw in the rice at the beginning, otherwise it is way too mushy and it becomes a "chicken and wildrice" mush (which was still good to eat!). My second go-around I added the rice for the last 2 hours, was a very nice texture.

Very good! I needed a recipe that didn't use whipping cream or cream of chicken soup, and this worked beautifully. The seasonings weren't my personal favorite for this kind of soup (and there weren't enough for my taste) so I ended up adding some other herbs and so forth, but on the whole, this was really good. Also pretty easy. I did cut the butter to 2T and added 1T of canola oil, and I used less flour and made it whole wheat.  I even used skim milk because I'm trying to keep things low fat/low calorie around here...and it didn't break! Thanks, Sue!

This soup was great!  I make large pots of soup each weekend during the winter here in Illinois.  I immediately freeze half and we eat the other half right away.  That way we have homemade soup all winter.  This batch never made it  to the freezer.  My family couldn't get enough of it.  The curry and the mustard add just enough zest to this rich soup.  We will make this again for sure.  I shared a small sample (my family didn't want to share!) with my co-workers and they immediately asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I froze mine in widemouth Mason jars for quick dinners and lunches.  I added a teaspoon of thyme leaf at the end because I thought it needed a little zing of citrusy flavor to it.  But great over all.

This is my kind of recipe! Creamy & delicious with a rich mushroom broth! I couldn't find wild rice in my small town stores, so I subbed a box of Uncle Bens Long Grain & Wild Rice. I also subbed Smart Balance margarine to make it less artery clogging. And I only simmered for 30 minutes. Still, definitely 5 stars! Loved the layers of flavor from the sherry and dried mustard, veggies, etc. Awesome recipe Sue, Thank you, for sharing.

This soup is very thick, rich and could almost be used as filling for a chicken pot pie.  It has a lovely mellow flavor (I doubled the curry spice and parsley and chopped rather than sliced the carrots). Trader Joe’s has packages of pre-cooked wild rice which I happen to have on hand so that cut my prep time down considerably.  BTW- the sherry really makes a huge difference so my suggestion is to not omit it.  I simmered the soup for about 90 minutes which really helped bring together all the ingredients well.  This is definitely a cold weather or tail-gate soup.  I will make this again, maybe on a cold & rainy day (well as cold & rainy as it can be in Los Angeles), but next time may try using low-fat or non-fat milk instead of half & half (it was a little too rich for us) and serve it in individual toasted bread bowls, or I may simmer it down another 30 minutes and make a pot pie using frozen puff pastry.

Converted this recipe to feed 40 people.  It was the hit of the party.  I did cut back on the amount of cream by a third, but still it was very rich and creamy.  I also used portabella mushrooms and they added quite a bit of flaver as well.

This is one of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted!  It is also very elegant and perfect for serving to guests.  I made the soup the night before and added the wild rice (precooked the day before)and the half and half to the soup before serving the next day.  I served it at a soup buffet and this was the only soup that was totally gone by the end of the evening.  It got rave reviews by all the guests.

Came out very tasty!  I substituted red wine for the dry sherry and milk for the half-n-half.  On the second day of the soup I had to add more liquid it was too thick.

I made this yesterday for dinner and it is very good!!!  I had to make some changes due to what I had on hand.  I used chicken drum sticks for the chicken meat....boiled them and deboned...got my chicken broth from this too.  Then I used skim milk instead of half and half.  The soup would have been too thick had I used the half and half.  This soup turns out really thick even using skim milk.  Will be making this again!!

Good, solid soup for fall. The seasoning combination was pleasant but the almonds were not. I will definitely leave them out next time - I did not like the crunch compared to the smoothness of the rest of the soup.

I used fat free half-and-half and it turned out fine. I also left out the celery since my husband doesn't like it. He also doesn't like curry powder, but I put it in anyway and he never mentioned it. Win!

I think this was just a textural problem for me. My husband and i did not enjoy the almonds in this soup. I also found it to be very thick when I followed the recipe exactly. Leftovers seemed to turn into a mush.

This is a nice soup - I wasn't blown away but I enjoyed it. I reduced the butter and added olive oil and cut the 2 cups of half and half to about a half cup of half and half.  Otherwise I think it would be too creamy.  Very tasty and, I suspect, quite healthy.  Good use of veggies that everyone has around the house.  Thanks.

I'm from Minnesota where chicken wild rice soup is a staple and this is the best one I've come across.  My boyfriend and I finish off the large batch in only a few days.  The only changes I make to the recipe are to add 1 C. of cooked white rice in addition to the 2 C. of cooked wild rice.  I also double the amount of curry and mustard powders.  I absolutely love this recipe and make it a few times every winter.

I cannot say enough about how good this soup is.  It is my husband's all time favorite soup requesting it every week during Ramadhan the muslim month of fasting.  I never put almonds or sherry, and it always turns out absolutely delicious.  I also, cut up raw chicken breast and let it cook in the soup which cuts down on work.  It freezes good as well.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This recipe was great! It made a ton so there is plenty of left overs. The only changes I made were to add 1/2 a cup of fresh corn and I omitted the almonds. Delicious! Thanks!

I got this recipe from my sister a few years ago.  I love it!  I have made a few changes to it though.  I am not a fan of mushrooms, so I omit them and add more celery and carrots.  I also put 1 tsp of spices, instead of 1/2 tsp.

I adore this soup...I made a few substitutions to make it low glycemic index but it didn't hurt the flavor at all.  I used skim milk instead of half and half, used smart balance instead of butter and used whole wheat flour.  The only addition was garlic powder!  We love this soup and make it all the time.  You will not be disappointed if you make this soup - no matter which version you choose.

Very good. I halved the recipe as there are only three of us. I simmered it one hour (everything was already cooked) and added the wild rice during the last half hour so it wouldn't "blow up" as wild rice can do. 
I only added enough half and half to make it look creamy, and toasted the almonds and sprinkled them on top to serve so they wouldn't disappear into it. It came out more like a stew. The curry powder and sherry are key. Good depth of flavor. This is worth trying.

I never take the time to rate or review but this soup demanded it.  I haven't even put the half and half in it and I think it's better than Panera's Chicken and Wild Rice Soup.  Wow!!!

OMG!  This is so good.  I made the recipe almost exactly as written.  I used 2% milk instead of half and half.  I can't believe how good this soup is - just like eating out!

Yum! I changed the method a little, and it turned out amazing. I started the rice as I started the veggies. After the veggies finished sauteeing, I added the raw chicken and browned. Then the flour, and followed the recipe, minus almonds. I added the rice (cooked in broth) once it was done and simmered an additional 20 minutes. In total, it probably simmered about an hour, and it was delicious. Poaching the chicken in the broth made it moist and delicious, and though I don't like carrots OR celery, both were perfect with this dish. Will make again many times, but only when I've got time. Not a quick dish, but recommended!

This is the second chicken/wild rice soup I've tried from this site. It is excellent. The almonds gave a nice crunch and interesting taste - my father's favorite thing about the soup. I used white wine instead of sherry but next time I'll either use more white wine or try the sherry because you could hardly taste it. I made the mistake of making two cups DRY wild rice and had about enough to sink a battleship. Ended up with two pots of soup though which was nice.

Simply fatastic! I had some green onions and broccoli that I threw in and it turned out really good!! I also used a wild rice and brown rice mix and added a little fresh garlic. This is definitely a recipe I will be using a lot in the future.

Oh my gosh, this soup is awesome. I didn't use as much half and half because the soup was pretty thick as it was. I did double the curry as suggested, but other than that didn't change anything else. Threw away all other recipes for Chicken Wild Rice soup.

this soup is excellent! my husband loves it and calls it "restaurant quality". the great thing is it uses ingredients we usually have around the kitchen most weeks! the process of cooking is long, but its totally worth it! you also have leftovers for days (if you have a family of 4).

This has become a staple in our home.  Especially during the sub-zero Michigan winters.  I followed the recipe exactly for the first round...AWESOME flavor but didn't care for the almonds.  Second round...omitted almonds, doubled the curry & added celery...DELICIOUS.  We love it so much that I now I reduce the liquids by half, add potatoes, peas & carrots and use it as our chicken pot pie filler!!! YUMMMM

This was really good! I made exactly according to recipe, only omitting the curry powder (didn't have any and I don't care for curry anyways)...it was still very tasty but needed some extra salt and I used white pepper instead of black, adding a little extra.  The finished product needed a little something, so I added celery salt.  Perfect. I'll make again!

I was really excited about this one but as I looked at the small ratio of spices to liquid I shoudl have trusted my gut.  We thought this was terribly bland.  I wonder if it may have been intended to be tablespoons instead of teaspoons?  I will make it again but will use more of the spices for sure.  At least double.

Loved this recipe from a fellow Minnesotan! I made it pretty much as written, except left out the dry mustard (didn't have any) and used red wine instead of sherry. 1 hour of simmering was plenty. A small salad and warm french bread made for a delicious, hearty meal. I'll be making this again on Christmas Eve!

For me a recipe should be really good as is but still adjustable to my personal taste for 5 stars. I made this recipe as in and was extremely unimpressed, especially considering the ratings. I thought it was very very bland. I probably would not make it again unless there were lots of adjustments.It just needs flavor!

We've made it three times in three weeks and loved each batch. Be prepared, though - it's thick and very hearty. I added extra carrots/celery, skipped the mushrooms and almonds and used beer instead of sherry. Very, very good. My husband suggested reducing the liquid a bit and turn it into pot pie filling. We'll give that a go! Enjoy!

I can't believe this is rated so good.  The flavor is bland and it needed more veggies added to it.  And it is SO thick, I ended up adding more chicken broth to it.  I felt like I was eating a bowl of thick gravy.  Will not be making this again.

This was excellent!

I made some changes to the recipe and cooked it in the crockpot.  First I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the roux.  I also at least doubled the veggies (except for the mushrooms) and then used black rice instead of wild rice (just rinsed it well before adding it to the soup), I used some homemade chicken stock, 1 cup skim milk, and 1 cup heavy whipping cream, and I skipped the sherry because I didn't have any.  I sauteed the vegetables and made the roux on the stove and then got it all into the crockpot.  This soup was fabulous, it made about 13 cups of soup total so about 1.5 cups of soup per serving.

Really good base recipe to which you can add your preferred type/quantity of seasonings to suit your taste. So yummy, great texture! I ended up doubling the recipe and still found it a little bland, although I didn't have the sherry and used red wine vinegar instead. I guess I like things a bit saltier. But this is really, really good and my kids liked it, too. 

TIP: If you aren't doing anything extra fancy with the chicken (or using rotisserie or leftovers), I found that it worked perfectly to boil frozen chicken breast with the wild rice for 45-60min in 8 cups of water.

This was one of the best soups I have ever made, and I make lots of soup.  The sherry really enhances its flavor.  Four and half-n-half gave it the perfect creamy texture.  Consider substituting or adding bacon for the almonds.  I did and it was great.

This is great - been making it for years. I use half the butter and it works fine. I also add a lot more curry and sherry and use a mixture of half and half and milk. Really good!

This is a very good soup. I changed a few things.Only used olive oil and no butter. Didnt add sherry or almonds. I used milk in place of the half & half. It turned out great and thick. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was one of the best soups I have EVER had!!  I made 2 servings of rice in my rice cooker & added it at the very end.  I doubled the celery & carrots, used only 1/2 cup flour (3/4 sounded like a lot, and 1/2 cup was perfect), used a rotisserie chicken off the bone), 3 cans chicken broth, 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. curry powder (KEY!), and I simmered it only 30 minutes.  Wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow this was a really wonderful chicken soup!  I precooked my rice because I prefer brown over white and it takes forever to cook brown rice if the water/broth has salt in it.  So since I didn't need the extra liquid for the uncooked rice I cut it down to 4 cups of broth.  Instead of making a flour roux I just added extra rice to thicken (gluten/wheat sensitive family member).  Worked great. I also found that 1 cup of heavy cream did the job. The whole family (hubby, 5yo, 3yo, & 19mo) LOVED this recipe and gobbled it up. Will definitely add this one to our family wintertime meal rotation!! Thank you!!!

This is a fantastic soup! I changed some ingredients though (I can never follow a recipe:). I put in 3 tbsp olive oil instead of butter, I didn't use any flour (I try not to eat wheat) instead I used a 1/4 cup cornstarch. I cooked one cup of wild rice which in turn was 3.5 cups cooked so I just used all of it. I used 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp balsamic for the sherry. I also used 1.5 cups 2% milk instead of the Half and Half. I also only put in a 1/2 cup of almonds and I quadrupled the curry. This is my new favorite soup! I input my version on sparkpeople recipe builder and it ended up being 291 calories for 2 cups. Not too shabby in my opinion. Thanks Sue for a wonderful recipe base! I'm sure it's even more fantastic as is but, I'm trying to watch the size of my butt.

The predominant flavor in this soup is mushroom followed by wild rice.  Homemade chicken broth is a must if there is to be any chicken flavor.  I used red curry powder - next time I’ll use yellow.  A solid recipe.

Only thing I did different was left out the almonds and used seasoned rice like Garlic and Herb. Dirty Rice is almost too spicy.  Thank you for the recipe.

I also just made this with left over thanksgiving Turkey.

OMG - my sister-in-law cooked this on the weekend and out of 4 adults, all 4 loved it.  I had a second bowl.....it's been added to my recipe file as a keeper.  She said she ad-libbed some on the cream ingredient but I would have to let her comment on that.

When I made the soup the first time, per the recipe, it turned out WAY too thick.  I tried the soup again with slight changes to fit our taste.  Used 1/4 cup butter, 2 TBS of flour and 2 cups milk.  Omitted almonds and curry and replaced with grated nutmeg.  Also, just sliced up 2 uncooked boneless  skinless chicken breasts across the grain, very thinly, and added to soup.   Love the soup, thanks for sharing.  Before serving you can add some fresh chopped parsley or spinach for a nice presentation.

This is some Awesome soup! I tried to make this a bit healthier so I used decreased the butter to 1/4 cup, I also only added 1/2 cup of flour since I had decreased the butter. I don't have any mustard powder or curry powder, so for spiced I used 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp smoked spanish paprika and 1/2 tsp white pepper. I omitted the salt all together and didn't miss it. Thanks for the recipe:)

I really like this soup (its more of a stewp)!  I didn't have a chicken and rice recipe and had been looking for one, I think I have found it. I had to change it up because I was out of some things I thought I had.  I didn't have curry powder so I looked up what to substitute for it and used most of the things suggested that  I had and it worked. I didn't use half and half but used some 1% milk cuz I had it, and I had to omit the sherry cuz I was out.  It was still fabulous and I will make it several times this season!

I used homemade broth (made from turkey bones).  This was savory and rich (some of that is from density of homemade vs. store bought soup.  My husband gave it a rare "five star."

This Chicken Wild Rice soup was outstanding.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as given. I had to substitute the wild rice with organic brown rice because I couldnt find wild rice at my nearest supermarket and this was in my pantry. I also didn't have dry mustard so I used dijon. I did substitute regular half & half with fat free. It was still creamy and yummy. As others have said the curry gives it such a unique flavor, do not omit! Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I will use it over and over agian.

Have made this soup many times- esp with leftover turkey! It's the closest to wild rice soup served at airport bistro at MSP, and sooo good. I now keep 'cooked' wild rice in my freezer to reduce the prep time. Can be frozen.

The curry makes this soup outstanding.  I added a bit more w/a pinch of thyme and extra pepper.  I also used less butter and ff milk in place of the half & half to cut down on cal/fat.  I think it's plenty thick due to the flour.  Wonderful, wonderful recipe and one that I will be making many times over.  Thanks for sharing!

I have been trying my hardest to find a recipe similar to the wild rice soup at the grand casino. This is even better! I followed this recipe almost exactly as it is described. I doubled everything though, and did not add almonds or sherry. Also I ran out of broth and substituted water. I like my food full of flavor, so after doubling the recipe, I doubled the spices again as well. I did not however double the curry. This turned out to be great! Everyone loved it! Time consuming, but worth it.

This is, by far, the best chicken wild rice soup recipe I have ever made.  I omit the sliced alomnds just because I don't like them.  I make this about once a month when it gets cold and it rarely lasts very long.  I have givein this recipe to many others and they always love it.  PERFECT!!!!

My family LOVES this soup.  It has become a cold weather favorite.  I tweaked the recipe according to some of the reviews and use porcini mushrooms for added flavor.  You can't go wrong with this recipe, and you can play around with it to tailor it to your family's liking.  I make a large batch and freeze half.  It freezes well and leftovers always taste great.

I made this in my crock pot, and it was fantastic!  I cut down on the fat (1/8 c butter + 1/8 c Olive Oil) and used less half and half, and it still turned out thick and rich!  Great recipe.

This was wonderful. Best wild rice soup I have had to date. I used up left over turkey instead of chicken and it tasted great. Try this! You will not be disappointed, this is so much better than recipes that use condensed soup. It was very easy too. Thanks!

What a wonderful soup this is!  I followed others' suggestions and added more curry and mustard powder.  I also added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  I had used homemade broth and had to add a boullion cube to the finished product, but this is delicious, hearty soup.  Thanks for the post

It was an easy to follow recipe. Great basic soup, but it was lacking flavor. I followed the recipe to a "T", but i had to add more chicken bouillion. And even after that, it was a lacking something. Probably won't make again

I have made this a half dozen times.  I use milk instead of cream and it tastes just as good.  Even my pickiest eaters like it.  The sherry is what gives the soup it's richness.  I also put it in the freezer to reheat for another meal.

Outstanding!!  I had some left over wild rice and was looking for a soup recipe when I found this.  I made it according to the directions and was very pleased.  However, it makes far more than 8 servings...more like 12!  Do not be tempted to increase the curry...it is perfect.  I thought about it as I love curry but decided against it and am very glad I stuck to the recipe.

I have made this soup twice, mostly because my 14 month old loved it.  I did not add the cream at the end, only a little milk to thin it.  Do not skimp on the curry powder, as odd as it sounds it really does complement the soup in the most unexpected (but delicious) way.  Otherwise I made the soup exactly as described.  A really thick, stick to your ribs soup (more like a stew, really), perfect on a cold winter's night.  Thanks!

Excellent. The only change I made was to add 6 ounces of beer to it.  The curry and the beer do wonders - I was a bit hesitant at first. Excellent receipe, will definately make this again.

We actually prefer this soup without the half and half - we only added it the first time.  You can cut back on the butter also, and the taste is still wonderful.  I've made this soup several times now and it's a keeper.

UFF DA!! Thats good soup!!
We live in Northern Minnesota and we LOVE wild rice! I refuse to make a soup that has canned soup in the recipe, UGH!
This soup is FABULOUS !!!! I have been searching for the PERFECT recipe for years HURRAH I found it!!
The only thing I changed was some garlic with the other veggies. But I live garlic!
Thank you for this recipe!!

With all the great reviews this recipe got, I was pretty let down by the way it turned out.  I followed the recipe exactly and found this soup to be rather bland.  Have been making a different version of wild rice soup (with bacon) for years.  Maybe I am just used to that one.  The bacon adds much more flavor.

This recipe was awesome!  I didn't have curry, sherry or almonds so I left them out, and I bought a rotisierre chicken and used that, it was unbelievable.  Will definitely make again and again.

I tripled this for a big family gathering.  After sauteeing the veggies I put everything in the slow cooker, did not pre-cook the rice or chicken.  Subbed the half and half for lowfat milk.  I used white wine instead of sherry.  The soup was delicious.  Used all organic ingredients.

I've been making this recipe for about 4 yrs now & it's the best soup on the universe.  I always add a little more celery, carrots & onion.  I have never used the sherry but it's good without it.  Makes a big batch which I love.

This is a very good recipe.  I did try some of the suggestions made, such as using fat free 1/2 and 1/2, and replacing butter with 2-3 Tbls olive oil. I do like a little more salt than the recipe calls for, but it isn't necessary.  This one is a keeper!

Perfect!  I used fat free half and half, cut back slightly on the butter, used a chicken bouillon cube when pre-cooking the wild rice, and it was awesome!  Being from Minnesota, I can tell you that if you want the true taste of the state; this is it!!!  Hats off to Sue!  Thanks!

Delicious!   I did not add the sherry and almonds b/c I didn't have them on hand.  My husband and two small children (2 & 1/2 yrs. and 15 mos.) loved this!  Will definitely make again.

This was a super easy, delicious soup recipe.  I cheated and bought a pre-cooked free range roasted chicken instead of the 4 breasts, and just took all the meat off it, chopped it up and threw it in the pot.  I would NOT add the almonds next time - they're too crunchy and my husband, not knowing they were almonds, thought the rice wasn't cooked.  Otherwise, the flavour is great and I'll definitely make it again without the almonds.

Great variation on old favorite soup. I followed the recipe, but found it too thick and bland. Liked it much better after cutting flour to 6 T, increasing wild rice to 3 c, sherry to 6 T, curry powder and mustard powder to 1 t each, and used 2 T fresh chopped parsley. Also cut out the almonds. 
Delicious!

Ok so I have to admit when I saw the ingredients I was thinking what the heck?! Mustard powder? Curry powder (even though I LOVE curry powder? And a 3/4 cup flour? This sounds crazy! But this is by far the very BEST chicken and wild rice soup I have ever had!!! I used turkey instead of chicken since we had tons left over from Thanksgiving but it would have been great either way. Truly delightful and a wonderful surprise to the palate. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! FYI I used a bit more curry powder since I love it :)

Finally found a recipe that didn't call for canned soup.   This is a great starting off point.   I actually made my own chicken broth to begin with.  I used 6 cups of water and put in 2 bone in chicken breasts and 2 leg/thigh quarters.  All grass fed.   after the chicken was cooked I removed and let cool.  Then followed the recipe for making the roux.   I doubled the veggies as I put some in to make the broth.  I also slowly added the milk to the roux to warm it before adding it to the broth.  At that point my chicken was cool enough to take off the bone to add to the pot.     great recipe will definitely use from now on..  Thanks !

I made this with turkey leftovers from Christmas and homemade turkey stock, and it was delicious.  Everyone enjoyed it--from our 4-year-old up through the adults.  Ours went without the mushrooms and almonds, as I didn't have them on hand, but the recipe was actually great to help use up some of the holiday leftover ingredients (butter, cream, wild rice, celery, etc.) without having to run to the grocery store.  Thanks for the great recipe!  This is just what I was looking for!

I used baby Bella mushrooms instead of regular mushrooms and omitted the almonds.  I found it good, however felt more like cream of mushroom than cream of chicken.  I had to add some chicken bullion flavoring to get one chicken flavor back.  I think part of the reason is that 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 is too much.  I do plan to try it again, but this time will use 1/2 the mushrooms and cut back on 1/2 and 1/2.  One cup may even be too much.   Also, may make some additions to the seasoning at that time if still bland.

I love chicken wild rice soup and have been trying to find the perfect recipe. Unfortunately, this wasn't it...BUT it was still pretty good. The slivered almonds were genius and the whole family loved that. Overall though, I felt it was bland.  The curry didn't do as much for it as I hoped it would and other than that, there isn't much in the recipe to really flavor it.  I made the recipe as written up to adding the chicken broth, then I put everything but the half & half into the crockpot. I did cut the butter in half. I also doubled the carrots because we like more veggies in our soup. When I went to add the half & half at the end, the soup already seemed really thick so I just added a cup of skim milk instead. I was glad I did.  It would have been WAY too thick otherwise.

Used less butter, and substituted fat free half and half. Didn't have almonds, but the soup was amazing! I've made this several times now and it's a real treat. It does freeze well, if we ever have any leftovers.

This soup is phenomenal! Other than leaving out mushrooms since my kids don't like them, I made exactly as the recipe lists. I wouldn't change a thing! This is a keeper! Glad I doubled the recipe so I can eat it again tomorrow. :) I normally make a recipe and then write notes on it about what I would do differently next time. Not with this one. It's perfect!

Excellent!  We loved it.  It smells divine while it's cooking.  Couldn't wait to eat it.  Followed recipe exactly except I used 1/4 cup butter and whole milk and it worked fine.  Also left out the almonds because I didn't have them:(

Second time I made it.  Added some fresh thyme instead of curry powder (not a big curry fan)and used fresh parsley instead of dried.  Also used more mushrooms and less chicken than the recipe calls for but I never follow recipes exactly!  Will make this again and again! It is definitely on the high-calorie side but oh so creamy and good on these sometimes harsh Wisconsin winter evenings!

Amazing - nothing bothers me more than people changing the recipe and giving a bad review-even if I change it I usually don't say I did. However, I have to share what I did as I think it made a difference for the good. I thought I had enough wild rice at home but I didn't. I had uncle bens long grain and wild rice- I used it (and the flavor packet) and I used a splash of Johnny Walker black Scotch as I didn't have sherry and scotch is bold and rich. Those are the only substitutions. This soup was amazing, hearty, creamy and nutty. I cooked the chicken in olive oil as I was sautéing the veggies and broke it apart with a wooden spoon when done-it made the soup rustic and even more hearty. I think the scotch and curry made this dish a winner. I'm not a curry fan but I'm so glad I included it. Watch the salt - if too thick, thin it with milk not chicken stock. I have tried many wild rice soup recipes and this is the best ever. Thank you for this recipe- so amazing!!

Can be much healthier if you sub  olive oil for the butter, fat free half and half - and I used only 1 1/2 cups, for the regular. Used only 4 TBS corn starch to thicken, rather than all of that flour. Basmati and wild rice mix, because it was what I had on hand. This is a keeper!

I have now made this twice.  The first time I made it exactly like the recipe stated.  The second time I made some minor adjustments based on reviews and our family tastes and, of course, we liked it better.  I doubled the curry and used one more cup of broth and cut the cream to one cup.  I also added more salt, added a little thyme and left out the almonds.  We love it and I will make it again and again.  I gave this five stars because I believe it is such a great recipe - and everyone should feel comfortable making a few minor adjustments based on your own tastes. I also want to add that I think any kind of rice can work.  We used a wild rice blend and it was wonderful.  Heats up beautifully for leftovers too - just add a little more broth because it thickens up, of course.  Highly recommended!

Made for work "souper bowl" luncheon.  Everyone liked it.  I think the Sherry added at the end adds a lot to the final flavor.  It helps, as one reviewer suggested, to have the wild rice and chicken already pre-cooked.

It turned out way better than I expected! I didn't put as much half and half in it because it tasted just as good without the half and half!

Fabulous soup! I tweaked it a bit, I used a 1/4 cup butter and a 1/4 cup flour. Then I only used 1/2 a cup of half and half and increased the chicken stock to 7 cups. It is by far the best chicken and rice soup I have ever had! It has so many different layers of flavor that when you serve it  to guests their first reaction is "wow, what is in this".

We love this chicken soup. The flavors are so yummy together. The only modification I did was I left out the almonds the second time I made it. Just not crazy about the added crunch. My husband said it was the best chicken soup he had ever had. Not hard to put together and doesn't have to simmer all day, which I like.

Great soup!  I used only 1/4 cup butter, and used 2% milk instead of the half and half. I will be making this again. The soup was even better the next day warmed up.  It would be good with leftover turkey instead of chicken.

Made recipe as printed with only minor changes.  Doubled celery & carrots to 1 cup each. Did not add almond slivers. Food processed the mushrooms. Used red wine instead of sherry. Kids ages 10, 9 & 6 loved it! "Better than Panera!" said my 10 year-old. This is very high praise in our house! Will definitely make again.

I love soup. I really loved this soup. My husband does not love close to not even liking soup. My husband loved this soup. It is flavorful with layers of texture. I did not have sherry so I used beer instead. I definitely will double and freeze next time.

This was a great Fall meal; nice comfort food.  I substituted broccoli for the mushrooms, as some members of my family are not 'shroom fans.  I added raw rice and let it absorb the broth, so this was more like a casserole in consistency for me, rather than a soup.  I'd sure like to try it more soupy next time.  Thanks a lot for a yummy recipe!!

This is definitely worth the many 5-star ratings that it has received! The recipe is well written and tastes FANTASTIC! Do *not* skip the curry powder...it makes this dish. I served it with hot french bread and a pumpkin bundt cake. Best meal ever!

This soup is wonderful BUT only with a couple of corrections. REDUCE the flour to 1/4 cup or don't use any!  It was way toooo thick!!  I would definitely at least double the curry powder as that made the soup. Instead of using wild rice which takes so long to cook, I bought a box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice. I will also use milk or reduced half & half next time to cut down on the calories and will use a crock pot.

We liked this one a lot.  I knew I would be freezing this, so I went about making it a little bit differently.  I cut way back on the butter for sautéing.  I then added the broth and simmered to soften the veggies.  I added the rice, chicken and seasonings.  I did not add the flour, almonds or milk.  This yielded 6 servings for me that I divided into 2-serving portions and froze.   After thawing two servings, I reheated the soup.  I made a roux using 2 T. of flour and 2 T. of butter and 2/3 cup milk.  Once the roux has thickened, I add it to the hot soup.   I don’t think the additional simmering time of 1 to 2 hours is necessary at all.  I garnished mine with the almonds that I toasted in the oven at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes, until golden and fragrant.

I just LOVE the smooth velvety texture of this soup!  The curry is a great little note.  The mushrooms add depth to the soup.  The only thing I'm always unsure about.. I love the almonds, but the crunch reminds me of under cooked rice.  So I'm not so sure about it. I think next time I'll just use fewer of them.  Great recipe!  its snowing here today and its just the perfect thing.

Would give it more stars if I could!!! Don't poo-poo the curry....gives it a great flavor and would never know it was used! My husband wont get within 10 feet of anything with curry in it and he had no idea it had curry in it! Did not use almonds, didn't have any.

My family really enjoyed this soup.  I made the following changes, I used fresh parsley, used turkey instead of chicken, used turkey stock instead of the chicken broth, and replaced the sherry with dry white wine.  The spices and seasonings needed to be adjusted for my taste, no way I could taste 1/2 tsp of curry powder in this much soup.

I did this in the crock pot. I put everything, except the cream, in the pot the night before. In the morning I turned it on high for 6 hours and it was ready for lunch. I added the cream just before serving. I also cut the flour in half and used a gluten free flour blend from Pamelas. The consistency was just right I thought. The only reason I gave it three stars is because we did not care for the curry or the seasonings in it. I also thought it was a little bland. It was ok but I probably won't make it again.

I was born and still live in MN, and this recipe is great.  I recommend getting 100% naturally grown wild rice as it is soooo much better than the "mass produced" hard, black variety.  A great site is www.christmaspoint.com.  Runs about $10/pound.  I made this recipe as listed except omitted the sherry and almonds just because I didn't have them.  Super delicious, even my 2-year-old couldn't get enough.  I've made tons of different wild rice soup recipes over the years, and in my experience you can't skimp on the butter and 1/2 and 1/2 or you may be disappointed.  Go for the full fat!  I add a lot of extra vegetables, rice, and chicken to make it extra thick and hearty.  You may need to add extra salt, to taste.  I used Tastefully Simple's "Flavors of India" curry seasoning salt in leu of the salt and curry, and that was awesome.  I don't know if they sell it anymore, but it's fantastic in wild rice soup.

Excellent soup for a rainy night! I made a few changes though and it turned out wonderfully. 

I didn't have sherry so I used dry vermouth as a substitute. I also did not add the almonds or the half and half as I didn't have any on hand. Last, I halved the rice since I wanted it to be a little less thick.
I also added some dried sage leaves and a few dashes of hungarian paprika. 

Definitely try this!

I added 1 tsp of sage.  Because I am allergic to dairy, I used olive oil to stir fry the veggies and left out the cream.  I left out the flour as a thickening agent, because I am gluten intolerant.  It probably results in a little different flavor, but is still chicken soup.

This if the first chicken wild rice soup that I have ever made. It was delicious! Entire family (including 7yo and 13mo) loved it!! I omitted almonds, sherry and half-and-half, just because I didn't have them. We thought it was perfect just like that. Very flavorful with curry powder. I would have never thought to use it in a soup like this. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I will make this many many more times.

After reading the reviews, I followed the recipe with the exception of adding raw chicken and wild rice. A very hearty soup, and the flavor is awesome!

This was great soup.  I took some of the advice of the other reviewers - I doubled the curry and added some milk to the 1/2 and 1/2 along with a dash of minced garlic.  Next time, I'm going to do one cup of milk and one cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  I would also slice both the celery and carrots and add a full tablespoon of minced garlic.  For larger groups, I'd add another cup of milk, another cup of rice, and more mushrooms.  And there will definitely be a next time (and I can't wait to take this home to the family in Minnesota)!

Generally, very good!  Skip the mushrooms, almonds, and curry powder.  Go for the 2% milk instead of half and half.  We prefer Chardonnay to Sherry.

This recipe is the best soup recipe that I've ever had and it tastes 100% better than Paneras. I followed the recipe to a t and it came out perfect.

Excellent!  My only modification was using chicken thighs instead of breasts only because I like dark meat better.  I'm sure it would be delicious no matter which parts are chosen.  Excellent recipe.  Very easy.

My husband and I both liked this recipe! I will say that I was not a huge fan of the almonds in the recipe - the crunch just did not seem to blend in well with the other ingredients. I also used wild rice and basmati rice which I thought gave it some nuttiness so that I can omit the almonds next time.

I used my leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the chicken. After adding the half-n-half, I thought it was just a little bland, so I doubled the salt, mustard powder, and curry powder. I also used fat-free half-n-half and twice the amoutn of rice.

Delicious, This soup is worth the effort. Prep time of 15 minutes is a joke - I spent an hour on this soup from start to finish but it was worth it!  Left the almonds out and sprinkled on the individual bowls as it was served because my son didn't want the almonds.  Very good!

My first attempt at home made soup and this turned out great...reluctant husband and daughter quickly changed their tune and it disappeared quickly.  Was hesitant on the curry, but based on other reviews made sure to include it.  Substituted barley and lentils instead of the wild rice the second time I made it, and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe...as my kids say, this one's a keeper.

I made this today, and it turned out pretty good! I used half chicken breast and half chicken thigh. I also added about a half cup more rice and some lemon juice. I think the next time I will add some more lemon juice and some other kind of herbs, because i think it needed a little of something extra to bring it over the top.

Loved it!  The only thing I didn't like was the almonds, because they stayed hard, and I kept thinking the rice wasn't done.  Also, I wish the celery had softened up more, so I will precook that a bit next time.

This was delicious.  Even my picky children ate it all and loved it!  It was creamy even without the half and half so I only used about 1/2 cup.  Very good.  Will make again

Excellent recipe! Here are my changes. I used a little less butter and flour. I did not use mushrooms, or sherry. I used 2% milk. Instead of using boxed wild rice I bought birds eye brand frozen wild and brown rice mixture that had diced carrots and broccoli in it. I just added it to the soup base when I added the chicken. I used store bought rotisserie chicken. I didn't cook it as long. Turned out EXCELLENT! Definately a recipe I will use over and over.

Making it again...for the third time.  My family (2 toddlers) loves this soup and it is very easy to make.  I don't add sherry and use lowfat milk.  We are curry-lovers so I doubled the amount.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!!

Very good. I added fresh minced garlic and half wild rice and half white rice. There wasn't enough liquid for the rice to cook. I had to add about a cup more of the chicken broth.The curry and sherry add nice depth.

Make it vegetarian!  I used vegetable stock and--instead of the chicken--I used one pound of mushrooms.  I also doubled the amount of curry, pepper, and mustard powder.  Don't leave out the almonds!  They may seem strange in a soup, but they add protein and truly add to the taste of the soup!

Love this soup.  Used wild rice blend I found in the bulk section of my supermarket.  Boiled ahead of time as someone else suggested- 4 cups of water & tsp salt per 1 cup dry wild rice.

Used butter/olive oil blend, subbed thyme instead of parsley.  I also used 2% milk instead of half & half.  Was plenty creamy for us.  I think the curry makes this soup!  Very subtle flavor- don't leave it out!

This soup is wonderful. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 milk (2 cups) and 1/2 half-and-half. I also ommitted the mustard powder. It is simple to make and tastes great (my picky 4 year old even loved it). Will definitely make this one again.

Simple to make! House smelled amazing! I added two cups of uncooked wild rice mix and increased the chicken broth by 1 cup.  I was able to freeze a couple containers and have some fresh... always looking for the large recipes to have extra in the freezer for an easy dinner.

I cooked a box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice (Herb Roasted Chicken flavored) with the seasoning to add to this since I didn't have plain wild rice.  I only added the mustard and cooking sherry and it was very good.  Also used leftover rotisserie chicken that I made stock from.

This recipe is satisfactory, but I changed some of the recipe to come to my tastes. Instead of 1 cup of half&half, I made it 1/2 cup - 1 1/2 tsp of mustard instead of 1/2 - about 1 teaspoon of thyme and oregano. I also decreased the time it simmers to 30-40 minutes.

Not a fan. I tried the crockpot version someone suggested and it was way too thick and mushy. That aside, it's only three stars because I really didn't care for the flavor. Just kind of weird. Maybe being from MN makes me picky about my wild rice soup? I see lots of others liked it. I made it as listed with no substitutions.

whooo baby, this was good. I did the crock pot method- had to add about 3-4 extra cups of water/broth to the mixture throughout the day. That is probably because I used raw wild rice. 

I sauteed the chicken and veggies before hand for the extra flavor. Omitted mushrooms. Substituted mustard sauce for ground mustard. Delicious.

How ever many stars there are above, add another one!  This soup is fantastic.  I doubled the recipe and probably quadrupled the veggies, onions, and spices, but the flavor is very much like a lobster bisque.  I will surely make this again.  The only other thing I changed for my personal preference was to omit the almonds and substitute thyme for the parsley.

ummmm...YUMMO! If you're a MN housewife like me this will definatley be one of your favorite winter recipes.  I had to use Uncle Bens long grain and wild rice original recipe instead of plain wild rice and it worked out great...plus added alittle more flavor.

Amazing. I usually find recipes for inspiration and never follow it exactly. This was awesome. I did not have dried parsley or sherry so I just omitted them. I was very wary of the curry but it turned out perfect. Thank you for the recipe, it will be my one and only wild rice soup recipe.

I really liked this.  I too am from Mn. and this is a very original recipe.  Thanks to the curry powder!  I was a little skeptical but it sure does make the recipe!  I made a vegetarian version with veggie broth and no meat but otherwise folllowed the recipe (except for the almonds which I didn't have).  Yummy!

Instead of mushrooms, I sauteed the veggies in a combo of butter and black truffle oil.  We don't like squishy mushrooms in our soup!  Also, did not use any flour but a little corn starch mixed w/ broth then added to the soup.   Wonderful soup! Devoured at dinner tonight!

This soup was very good and super easy.  I used leftover turkey from Christmas and already cooked wild rice.  I substituted coconut milk for 1/2 and 1/2 because dairy doesn't agree with me and it still turned out fabulous.  I thought it needed a little zip-- maybe a dollop of sour cream for serving? (I can't have that, but others might enjoy it).

I increased the recipe for 12 servings and made it exactly as written (omitting only the almonds).  Absolutely the best soup I have ever made.  This is a keeper.  If you like MN Chicken Wild Rice Soup, you will love this.

I followed this recipe basically to the tee.  This was the best soup by far that I've ever made.  The flavor, consistency and overall look was outstanding.  I will definitely pass this recipe along as well as make it again.  Thank you very much for such a quality recipe.

This is one of my favorite soups.  During the winter months I make soup every Sunday, and this is in regular rotation.  My boyfriend prefers plain, honest food, and I would rather eat something with a little more pizazz and sophistication.  This recipe fits the bill on both counts.  I love the addition of the curry powder.

I love this soup, but do modify it when I make it. I use lowfat milk in place of the cream; 2 cups of cream makes it too rich for our taste. I also like it better without the almonds, but the sherry gives it wonderful flavor.

I am from Wisconsin and even for me, I thought it was heavy on the cream!  I would nix the half 'n half, and add more dry wine to make it distinct.  I also thought the almonds ruined the textures of celery and carrot:  Be forewarned of nuts in soups and jello salads!!  Also I would try to get pure wild rice.  I compromised with long grain/wild mix--that was not distinct enough for me.  Good luck and bake some homemade bread to go with this.

I made this vegetarian with veg stock and fake chicken.  I also didnt pre-coom the rice and it turned out fine.  Tastes good, but I think it needs a little something.  I'll try adding more black pepper next time or maybe a dash of cayenne.

This is delicious and tastes like a soup from a good restaurant! I followed the recipe almost exactly - used canned cooked wild rice, doubled the salt, curry and mustard powder, added a half teaspoon of garlic powder, omitted the almonds, used cream instead of half-and-half. The soup was really easy to make and I think the base would be a good starter for many different soups. Next time I will make a few changes - if I am in the mood for a traditional Chicken Wild Rice soup I would definitely omit the curry. If I felt like having the curry in the soup I would add some potatoes, coconut milk, red pepper flakes and garnish with jasmine rice, like a yellow curry soup.

Fantastic! I was worried about the curry powder because while I love it, my fiance isn't completely sold on it. However, all the flavors came together very nicely and it was just a really mellow flavored dish overall. All I had on hand was an Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice mix that was instant, so I used that (sans seasoning packet) and it worked very well. The only change I would make next time would be to omit the almonds, I just didn't love the crunch in there.

This soup has excellent flavor.  The curry adds such a nice depth.  I left out the almonds and sherry simply because I did not have them on hand.  To simplify the process, I used 2 cans of cooked wild rice.  I added an extra small can of chicken broth and some extra spices.   The soup separated a bit,leaving it kind of buttery... possibly from being too hot?  I think next time I'll cut down on the butter.  But I'll definitely try again for the perfect texture, as the flavor of this soup is wonderful.  I plan to freeze the entire batch to serve next week...when I reheat I may try to thicken the soup with more flour/broth roux.

This is some seriously yummy soup! The only prep work I did was cook the wild rice, then I just threw all of the  ingredients, except the half and half, in a crock pot for several hours. I only added two tbsp. butter, and used only one cup of fat free half and half, but otherwise followed the rest of the ingredients exactly and it was perfect. This soup is so hearty and filling you don't need to serve anything else with it. My boyfriend didn't like it as much as I did, but still enjoyed it and liked the different textures and that it's very healthy - especially when you omit most of the butter.

This was a hit at my house!! First I cooked two boneless chicken breasts in 4 cups of broth in the slow cooker.  Then sauteed onion, carrots, celery and mushrooms ( I put these in the chopper and chopped fine and my kids didn't know they were in there!!) in the butter.  I then added the flour and 2 more cups of broth to that.  I removed the chicken from the slowcooker and chopped -then put the sauteed mixture into the slowcooker in the broth and added the chicken.  I used two boxes of Uncle Bens wild rice with seasoning packet. Didn't need anymore seasonings except I added some garlic salt. I cooked both in the microwave as directed on the box except cooked 10 minutes at the end instead of the specified 20-25.  Dumped it in the slow cooker and cooked for a couple hours and poured 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk no sherry no almonds- the last 30-45 min.  It makes a huge pot of soup and my picky eaters loved it!!!!  I served with Beer Bread II on this site and it was the bomb!!!!!!  THanks for the recipe!!

I love wild rice soup and this is a fantastic recipe. It had great flavor and easy to put together.  The only thing I changed was subsituting half the cream for skim milk.  Not sure if that is what made the soup seem seperated.  Other than that, it was delecious and I will definitely be making it again!

I love this recipe! I've made it 4 times now, and the last 3 times it has been HEAPING double batches!!  I do nearly double the veggies bc I'm a big fan of carrots.  it freezes and reheats so well that as soon as I finish cooking I pack it down into those 3cup disposable containers to store for the winter....great recipe, fed it to a friend for the first time last night (she came over while it was simmering and stole some) and she instisted on taking the recipe and a container full home!!!

SO GOOD!  I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup olive oil, and cut the flour to 1/2 cup.  I used leftover Rotisserie chicken (which I like the texture of WAY better than cubed chicken breasts.)  I put in the spices as they were called for but after tasting ended up doubling the curry powder, tripling the dried mustard, and adding 1 good teaspoon of garlic powder.  I added an extra tablespoon of sherry.  I also tripled the salt (to 1 1/2 tsp).  I used unsalted butter which may be why I needed more salt.  I used 1% milk because we had it on hand and it is healthier, and it turned out great.  I was skeptical of the curry.  I like curry but wasn't sure about it in wild rice soup...but it is SO yummy!  It works really well. This will become a winter staple in our family.  And it's a great recipe to take to friends.

This soup is incredible! My husband and I made it for dinner tonight and we were blown away. I added garlic with the other vegetables, and used 8 cups chicken broth. Doubled all the spices except the curry, and used garam masala for that. It was just delicious. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe :-)

It is ok but it was very bland I did add garlic, paprika and some red pepper as one other review said to do. my son and I kept tasting it to get it to the right taste. I didn't like the curry in it as I think that is a taste that you have to grow to like. It definitely makes a huge pot of soup though.

THE BEST SOUP EVER!!!  I made this with a few omissions, no mushroom and no sherry.  Everything else was exactly the same.  My whole family loved it.  I live in Minnesota and we have a lot of restaurants with Chicken and wild rice soup and this is better than any restaurant version I have ever tasted. Thanks for the recipe!!

4 stars as written - I feel it needs a little more. I'm a native Minnesotan who has lived in the South for 11 years, so I like my food spicier and more garlicky than what I was raised on. I basically use this base recipe, then add 6-8 cloves of garlic when sauteing veggies as well as some diced red pepper. I also use a "curry masala" Indian seasoning that I buy instead of curry powder. Add cayenne, cumin, and/or minced hot peppers to taste for more heat. As others have said, the recipe is certainly forgiving. You can some various dairy products to reduce fat, and while it changes the taste and consistency, the soup is still good. Just remember that you'll have to add more milk than you would cream, so use less stock and vice versa.

Outstanding recipe!  I've made this recipe several times (as is) and I always get compliments.  Thanks for sharing!
P.S. It's also good with pheasant instead of chicken.

This is my first review. I had to take the time to review this recipe b/c it is sooooooo good. I have made this several times - I personally think that it is thick and creamy enough without all of the cream. I like to substitute 1/2 c broth and 1/2 c of half and half for the "cream" step. Enjoy!

I modified the flour/chicken broth part.  Stir 3/4 cup flour into cold chicken broth and add to soup.  Simmer on low.  Add half-and-half just before serving and just heat it through.  Do no boil or the half-and-half will curdle.

This was wonderful!  I halved the recipe and used brown rice instead of wild because my husband doeson't like wild rice.  Cooked in separate pot until almost done, then added to soup to finish cooking.  Used milk instead of half and half to cut calories and because I didn't have half and half.  Other than that, I prepared as directed and I can't complain!  Thanks!

I have made this recipe twice and it's about as perfect as a recipe can be!  My family loved it!  I doubled the celery and carrots, used one whole rotisserie chicken cut up as another reviewer suggested, and a little more wild rice.  I thought the liquid proportions were just about right.  The first time I made it I added more broth after reading other reviews; but, the 2nd time I used the recipe's measurements and it turned out perfect. We didn't think it was too thick.  It does thicken up a little the next day but it was just as good.  Highly recommended.

This was so yummy, but it does take a long time to make which I didn't realize-LOL! My prep time came out to an hour and a half. We ate it with fresh bread which made it even better.

What kind of idiot would try a soup that has wild rice and curry in it when her children don't eat rice or curry?  Me!  I have eight kids, each one pickier than the next and they ALL cleaned their bowls and asked for more.  I used extra broth as well and threw in some sour cream, other than that I followed the recipe.  We LOVE this soup!

I'm originally from Minnesota and I have to say this is the BEST Chicken Wild Rice soup I have ever tasted! I cooked the chicken separately in a crock pot with some chicken broth until it was super tender, and then added it to the soup at the end, simmering on low about an hour. I think the curry and mustard spices are a hit, and will add a larger amount next time. My husband complimented this soup's aromas while it was cooking, through dinner and all night afterward. 10+

OMG! This is awesome.  I didn't have Sherry or curry powder and couldn't add onion (Hubby is allergic to them) and it was really great, imagine the taste if I would have put all the ingredients in there.  Thank you.

I made this recipe last night and substituted mushrooms with chopped up potatoes and corn.  I added a cup more of cooked chicken, fresh parsley and minced garlic.  To make this it is smart to do the chicken and the rice ahead of time, but once I got all my ingredients ready to go it was fast and easy.  Everyone loved it, my favorite part was the thickness of the soup.  Also, plenty of leftovers!

This soup is really good.  I left out the mushrooms and used a package of already prepared wild rice from the rice isle plus the meat from a deli roasted  chicken - this cut down a lot on the prep time.  Because I was afraid of it being too salty as other reviewers had commented, I used low sodium chicken broth.   Then I thought it needed more salt.  It's always better to error in the side of less salt as each person can add their own, but you can't take away.  Very tasty and not too thick or thin. Thanks!

Yum!  This soup was rich, hearty and flavorful -- definitely a keeper!  The only changes I made were to substitute turkey for the chicken and to cut the butter and flour in half.  The almonds were a nice crunchy surprise.  This recipe will definitely be a regular on our menu from now on!!

We made a few changes, and my 9-yr-old picky eater loved it.  Changes:  no mushrooms; no mustard; no sherry; and we used milk, instead of half-and-half.  Next time, we will cut the curry in half.  Actually, we'll just DOUBLE everything else, because, next time it'll be a BIG BATCH!  

For the 2nd attempt, we cut the curry in half.  It was still good -- but the original amount of curry makes a better soup.

Score!  Soups are my specialty, and I've made a lot of them.  They're generally easy because you can just throw whatever sounds good in a pan and usually it's good soup.  I really wanted to try a wild rice chicken cream soup, but I was suspicious of the curry in this recipe.  But hands down this is the best soup recipe I've ever made!  The curry adds a great flavor.  The next time I make it though I may reduce the curry by 1/3 to see if that's even better.

Absolutely delicious!  The prep was fairly easy too.  I used full cook wild rice and just dumped it in the pot with 2 c. of water.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  This was a warm and tasty supper on an usually cold March day.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Excellent soup! I skipped the sherry, almonds and celery family preferences.
I did mix the flour with some broth to make a roux then added it to the soup.  I didn't want lumps.  I simmered it for more than an hour and the guys came running to eat. Yum, will make again

Excellent!  The only changes I made was to add more chicken broth and reduce the flour in an effort to avoid a "thick" soup that others described and it was perfection!

Wonderful I loved this soup my co-workers and friends think I’m a gourmet chief or that I moonlight at Campbell’s. I made this twice, once exactly as written and the second time with less butter and skim milk. The second time Ialso used whole wheat flour because that was all I had…still tasted good just a little darker in color.

Excellent!  I had to use canned mushrooms...no big deal.  I also cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and used skim milk in place of the half and half.  It is still very rich and creamy.  I will definitely be making this again.

This soup was GREAT!  I didn't use the sherry or the almonds and instead of slicing the veggies, I chopped them.  We also like our soup a little thicker so we ended up putting in almost 3 1/2 cups of rice.  I also made this soup with pheasant the second time and turned out just as good.  Already had to give the recipe out.  Thanks!!!

The best chicken and wild rice soup I have ever tasted!  Added a little more sherry to taste. Also Lawry's seasoning salt is a great addition to most soups.

Excellent recipe!  This has become a regular at our house.  I made it for a potluck, everyone raved and compared it to Panera's soup.  The only change I made was I eliminated the almonds.  Thanks!

Excellent! Fabulous flavor. I doubled and made in the crockpot for a housewarming and everyone raved. If you do make this in the crockpot, be sure to occassionaly check the liquid level. I did have to add water and more half & half because it got a little dry. This is going into my permanent recipe box!!! Thanks Sue ;o)

This recipe is INCREDIBLE. My new favorite soup. A little time consuming, but well worth it!! My changes: no mushrooms, curry, sherry, or almonds. I used milk instead of half & half. To make my chicken broth, I poured 6 cups of water into a pot, threw in the raw chicken breasts & 6 tsps of chicken bullion & let it simmer while my wild rice was cooking. Served with fresh bread for dipping - what a meal!

I have made this frequently since finding the recipe in 2004!  My family and I love it and it does freeze nicely.  I do leave out the mushrooms (not a fan) and I only use about 1 cup of the Half n half - we found it was too rich with all the cream the recipe calls for.  Also, I don't add the almonds to it because my husband and youngest daughter don't like them, so my oldest daughter and I add them seperately to our own bowls.  You can also substitute leftover turkey in place of chicken!

This was my first time making a wild rice soup.  I used only 1 c. wild rice (was all i had) i followed the instructions given on the package for the rice, which was 4 c. water per 1/2 cup of w.r. I also only used 1 c. half and half (fat free) and only 2/3 c. of flour, all with positive results.  I didn't have any celery on hand so i subbed 1/4 tsp of the salt for celery salt and increased the carrots.  Savored by all.  Thank you Sue!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  My husband asked me if I could make a recipe that was similar to the one he had in college.  This was it.  Super huge hit with DH (darling husband) and with both kids (now that's a miracle).  We have one bowl left after 2 days, but I'm sure it wont last long.  As with previous reviewers I left out the sherry, curry, and almonds.  I also served it with warm parmesan bread sticks.  Also, my husband usually complains that we have too many leftovers, but he didn't mind so much that I had made the full recipe!

I made this several weeks ago and although the flavor was very good....the consistency was just a little too thick for me. If I was to make it again...I would not put the half and half in at all as the way it was before adding it....would have been just thick enough for my liking. Overall though....it was good.

Very tasty and fragrant soup; it does have a tendency to thicken up overnight in the fridge and become more of a stew or casserole. I used a low-fat chicken broth, brown rice (I cooked the rice in leftover chicken broth for added flavor), and grilled the chicken breast. The mushrooms added a lot of flavor and the almonds added a nice crunch. Plus, I'm a fan of any recipe using sherry - it's excellent in split pea soup, too! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Sue!

Contrary to Sue's statement, it does not freeze well. The cream separated in the freezer and I had to add milk when reheated. A rather bland soup - salsa might jazz it up.

This soup is awesome! It is very easy to prepare.  My husband & children all had thirds!  Next time I make this I will try to reduce fat content with lowfat milk & margarine or olive oil.

An excellent way to end a snowy day -- a big bowl of this soup and warm crusty bread.  My husband and I loved it.  Both my kids liked it ('course they're grown so I'm not sure my "kid friendly rating" applies).  One has already asked me for the recipe, she's making it this week.  This one's a keeper.

This is the best chicken wild rice soup I've ever made!!!!  Some of the most picky members of my family even loved it.  I omitted the almonds and sherry and I still think it was fantastic.  The best part of this recipe is that consists of ingrediants that I usually have on hand!!!  Try this, it will become a family favorite!!

I’m from Minnesota. This soup is a thick soup, that’s the way it supposed to be. There’s a hotel on the Mississippi River in Red Wing MN that is known for their Chicken Wild Rice Soup. IMHO, this soup is better. I prepare it as written. One difference only, I toast the slivered almonds. Toasting nuts brings out the flavor of the nut and makes them crunchier. It makes a great recipe fantastic. Try it for anything you use nuts in. You won’t be disappointed.

Delicious recipe.  It takes a little cook time but goes together easy.  We had it Christmas Day.  I used whipping cream instead of half and half.  I only had 5 cups of broth, so I added an extra cup of water.  I put in about 3 cups of wild rice.  It was great for lunch the next day.

Excellent Soup!  I modified it using wild pheasant, and it was very good.

Fabulous...and I'm not exaggerating!  You know it is good when everyone asks for the recipe.  It has alot of ingredients, but is well worth the very unique-tasting broth it produces.  Everyone loved the taste...but couldn't place the ingredients exactly.  There isn't a drop left of this soup...and I only made it yesterday.  Thank you Sue for submitting this!

Delicious!  Great way to use leftover chicken.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to use a half stick of butter and milk.  Soup was still thick and tasty.

Great soup.  The sodium content is high!! But, chicken broth usually has a lot of salt in it so I never add the extra salt.  Also, I use Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (white and Basmati rice combo) and add it close to the end of cooking because the rice is cooked already. Ready rice comes in a lot of flavors so you can pick the one you want for this recipe.  If I don't have leftover chicken left, I use canned chicken which is really good.  I just dump a whole large can or two in, broth and all and it is delicious.

Great recipe! I made a double batch and froze some of the leftovers.  He said it’s one of his favorites even after reheating, freezing, and reheating again. Thank you for sharing it!

Made this today. Nice texture and very creamy, but I think the seasoning was shy by about a factor of 10! I’ll be trying this one again, but I’ll amp up the salt and seasoning and add some more herbs.

I substituted fat free chicken broth and fat free half and half and that lowers the calories and fat a bit. I also used Wondra flour instead of plain flour, which completely eliminates any clumping. I used a mix of gourmet mushrooms. I didn’t have Sherry, so used Marsala. Otherwise made it as written. It’s a lovely soup, still very creamy and full of flavor. Very good.

I varied it a bit ... no mushrooms or almonds
I used a package of wild rice/quinoa 
Super easy and tasty!

So good. Didn’t have celery so doubled carrots. Didn’t add wine. Used 1% milk instead of half & half and was plenty rich. Definitely going in the recipe binder.

The whole family enjoyed this (even the picky teen). I used homemade chicken broth, replaced 6 ounces of the half-n-half with 0 fat Greek yogurt, used leftover chicken and did not have the sherry. We did add some garlic salt and pepper and next time will add more rice. Thank you so much for a good, hearty soup recipe!

Left out the mushrooms.
I buy a little extra stock because sometimes it can get a little too creamy. Very delicious!

I cooked this in a crock pot. I put all the ingredients in except for the half and half, that was put in about thirty minutes prior to serving! The crock pot was on low for about three hours. Next time I will probably cook it a little longer for the vegetables to soften more. However the flavor was delicious!

I tried this recipe because my husband doesn't care for my current Chicken Wild Rice Soup recipe because it's so thick.  This one was worse!  Not only was it too thick (even thicker than my original recipe) it was so bland that he had to use Lawry's seasoning salt in order to eat it.  He said go back to my other recipe :-/  Disappointing.

I didn't change anything except substitute evaporated milk for the half-and-half.  It has such a good taste and really didn't take long to make.  I had leftover cooked chicken breasts, and cooked the rice while I chopped veggies.  This soup is a real keeper!  Thanks, Sue

I eyeballed all the quantities so I have no idea how much I actually used. I’d say keep everything but the mushrooms and almonds—they seem a bit out of place with the other flavors. The seasoning is so simple yet SO GOOD. Who knew just simple curry and parsley could be so delicious.

I did not add the Sherry or the half and half, I just added additional water and it turned out fine. If anything, I would say add a little less flour up front, or your soup will be more like a gravy--that's not what I want for a soup, personally.

Very happy with this recipe.  Will use a third less of flour next time. A base was a little to thick. Great flavor with Brown rice.

Before I added the half & half, I put the soup in a crock pot on low for the simmer time.  Also, I omitted curry, mustard, sherry and almonds.  I didn't have a couple items and don't like a couple others.  This soup was devoured by my family!!  A keeper!!

Loved this recipe!  Used it as a base and changed a few things based on what I had.  Didn't have celery, mushrooms, sherry, or wild rice.  I didn't want to use flour so I followed some other suggestions and skipped it.  Did not use as much butter as was called for and added a bit of olive oil to help saute veggies and cook the chicken.  I doubled the curry and used part milk and heavy whipping cream because it's what I had.  Used boullion rectangles instead of flakes.  Had skinless chicken legs bone in so I pan fried them with the onion, garlic, and carrots.  Let them cook the rest of the way in the soup and pulled them out about halfway through and took out the bones.  Overall cooked for about an hour and the family loved it.  Added extra boullion when the liquid was cooking off about 3/4 of the way through.  This recipe allows for a lot of changes!

Delicious!  I omitted the almonds as I did not have any on hand.  Husband stated this is his new favorite soup and asked for it to be in the rotation.  Thank you, Sue! :)

Very good!  I did not add curry and used 2 boxes of Uncle Ben’s wild rice, which had parsley in its mix so I did not add more parsley. Instead I added rosemary.  Turned out great!

No changes...an excellent cream soup. Must say the almonds added a crunch that came off very nice, but overall easy, nice appearance and best of all great flavor. Can't ask for more??

I make a lot of soups in the winter time and freeze them for quick easy meals.  This soup is absolutely wonderful.  I have made it several times just as written.  I always have it in my freezer.  Try smoking your chicken, it adds a layer of flavor.

This soup was so tasty!  It is one of the few soups my husband thought was so filling he didn't need to eat a sandwich with it as well!  

I made the soup almost to recipe except use cabernet sauvignon instead of sherry.  It tasted great and added a nice color.   

Super yummy recipe!

As another reviewer stated, I did this in the crock pot and added everything in raw. It was very, very good. I added a drizzle of olive oil - literally a drizzle and no butter at all. There is no reason for this much butter in this recipe.

Soup came out delicious and I would make again, however, I would not add the almonds next time.  In my opinion, the almonds were a funky texture that you don’t expect in soup.  The curry gave it a really nice flavor.

I have been using this recipe for  5 years. Loved by all.  My adjustments are as follows:  I measure onion to be about 1/2 cup and double the amount of celery and carrots to 1 cup of each. I use whole milk instead of half and half.  I always use mushrooms but not always the almonds.

I used chicken thighs in the soup only because that is what I had on hand. It was very creamy and excellent when reheated.  Will definitely be  a go-to soup this winter.

This is a fabulous recipe! I’m a hardy Minnesotan and make this at least twice a year in the winter. It’s so good! I pre-cook my wild rice in the Instant Pot (cooks perfect and so much faster). I usually always use 2% milk instead of cream or half and half. I don’t always have almonds on hand so I skip them. And I use fresh chopped parsley (1/4 cup, and add fresh thyme (1 Tbsp). My husband gives it 5 stars too. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This is excellent! I made it almost to spec. Didn't have any mushrooms & had only one cup of half & half. The almonds are a great addition! I'll definitely make sure I have mushrooms for the next time. It was so good both my husband & 4 year old asked for seconds!

I made the roux gluten free by using rice flour instead of wheat.  I also used half cream half coconut milk instead of full half and half because I’m mildly lactose intolerant, and it helped.  It was so good and hearty, even my 10 yo son who hates all soups ate it all!

Delicious and comforting!  I omitted the mushrooms due to personal preference and therefore added double the carrots and an extra cup of rice to make up for it.  I also added a 4 oz jar of pimientos (diced) as per another Chicken and Wild Rice soup on this site.  Absolutely loved the curry and other spices! I will definitely make this again however next time I think I will half the slivered almonds as they were a bit overwhelming.

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the curry powder, cut back on the butter by a couple tbsp, and used 4 cups chicken broth to 2 parts water to cut down some of the salt. Definitely will be a staple going forward, particularly in the cold winter months.

I used Costco rotisserie chicken and added extra wild rice. I cooked 1 dry cup of wild rice and added it all. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It is some of the best chicken and wild rice soup ever. I will definitely make it again!

Wow!! Sooooo much flavor! This really hit the spot. I won’t call it easy as it does take a while to prep if you’re starting from scratch for stovetop version (rice & chicken) and you have to be very mindful before the ‘simmer’ step. Once it’s going though, it’s just a couple stirs. I will definitely leave out the almonds next time. They do nothing for the flavor and it adds a odd texture, I kept thinking I hadn’t cooked the rice all the way. I will also chop the mushrooms more than a slice. It made it more of a stew than soup. I will have it again very soon with some preferred changes

I modified this a bit as I like stew consistency over soup and I wanted it heavier on the veggies but overall the flavor is wonderful! I used a cup of celery and a cup of carrots with the 8 oz mushrooms. I only used 2 cups broth and 0.5 cup almond milk and skipped the half and half, sherry, and dried almonds. I throw all of it in the crock pot with three frozen breasts and cook on high for three hours and it’s turns out perfect!

Very good recipe! It was simple and filling. It was a little thick for me, so I might thin it down next time. I also added about triple the amount of curry, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.

Very rich & thick. I have another Chicken Wild Rice Soup recipe that is quicker that I'll probably make more often cause of the ease of it but this is different than that recipe is many ways so it'll depend on what we want. I'm not sure what the almonds do for the recipe but my hubby liked it - I'll just use less.  We may thin out just a tish but it probably was cause I added more carrots & celery than called for (our preference).  Will make again for sure.

I made it like the directions, minus the mushrooms and almonds.  Next time, I might add a can of corn, but my hubby thinks it's absolutely delicious!  I did use Uncle Ben's Long grain and wild rice blend because that's all I could find, so had to add more chicken broth to thin it down.  Froze half and will eat the other the rest of the week.  Good thing he likes leftovers :D

This has great flavor-best thing about this recipe. I think a few changes could be made. As is it’s way too thick. Definitely not a soup. I suggest less flour. I had the leftovers of a whole chicken from the night before and some ground chicken. I also didn’t have any rice but I did have some pearl barley. Because the soup should simmer for an hour or two I chose not to brown the ground chicken first, nor cook up the barley first. Once all the liquid is there I just added those two uncooked items. It all turned out nicely. But as I mentioned, it’s just way too thick. Which of course does make it a very hearty filling dish on a cold, dreary winter night! This also leads the way for any other veggies laying around that needs to be consumed.

Rich and creamy.  Only ingredient I did not have was sherry.  I used a bit of dry white wine in its place.  The curry powder is a must.   I have to admit I did not have curry powder, so I made my own.  
Ingredients
    2 tablespoons whole cumin seeds, toasted.
    2 tablespoons whole cardamom seeds, toasted.
    2 tablespoons whole coriander seeds, toasted.
    1/4 cup ground turmeric.
    1 tablespoon dry mustard.
    1 teaspoon cayenne.
Fantastic recipe.  Loved it, and will make again and again.  10 stars!

Made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit. Cut down on the flour a bit as many have indicated a floury taste to the soup. Seasoning is spot on, although  I added a bit more black pepper, and used 1 cup half and half, 1 cup milk. Also added more veggies and chicken to make it a little more hearty. Going to make with pheasant some time soon. A definite keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

This tasted amazing!  I made a few changes in that I did not add flour nor did I add the almonds and sherry wine as I didn’t have any??. And I forgot to add the half and half!  Regardless, it was excellent and will be making it again.  Oh yes, one more thing, I used uncooked rice because I didn’t read the recipe thoroughly before making it and it turned out great ????

This is absolutely a 5 Star Plus recipe. I made this for dinner and hubby couldn’t stop raving about it. I used the box of Uncle  Ben’s Wild Rice, the quick one, and it made exactly 2 cups. I also used baked chicken tenders (only adding salt & perrer to these and covered while baking to keep them tender and moist) instead of the chicken breasts. Also, as I didn’t have dry mustard, a 1/2 teaspoon of the yellow mustard worked just fine. One note is that I did follow the directions but it didn’t seem like the carrots, celery, & onions were cooked through in the  five minute timeframe. I would definitely cook these three items a bit longer - at least until the onions were translucent - before adding the mushrooms. Other than these comments, this soup was wonderful and will definitely be made again (& again) in this household. Thanks for sharing this!

This was excellent, and really not that difficult to make, but we felt it needed a little more salt, pepper, and sherry.  Once those items were added (at the table rather than mixed into the "pot"), it rated a big "10"!

Great ingredients and a great soup for a wintery day. Makes the house smells so good. I think the amount of curry powder could be halved. My soup looked great but the first taste was of curry powder. If you dont like curry powder then you would avoid this soup. I happen to love it. Try this easy soup.

The aroma of this soup was amazing. Everyone couldn’t wait to try it. I cooked per the recipe and added 1/4 cup of Sherry. The soup was hearty and creamy. The texture of the slivered almonds confuses the tongue. I may omit it next time around. Since there is chicken in the soup it’s easy to think the almonds are parts of the chicken cartilage. I know this sounds strange but 3/4 of ius made similar comments. Soup thickens up so you may need to thin with water. Everyone loved it!  Very flavorful.

Great. Simple. I used a crock pot multi cooker so I could do it all in one pot. Note, you have to make the rice and chicken first, and set aside for later. The crock is nice also because you can't overcook this and the crock makes that easy.

I did not simmer 1-2 hours.  Only for 15 minutes.  Needed to add additional chicken broth to thin out soup.  Clearly, this was a real winning soup for my family.

Very tasty!  I took a crockpot full to our neighborhood soup supper.  It was a big hit, only had about a cup left to bring home.  Made as Recipe with minor changes.  I cut the butter and flour in half, didn’t have any sherry, and added a few strips of cooked and crumbled bacon.  Will definitely be making this again!

A delicious soup, even though it's probably not very healthy!  I did take the advice of other reviewers, and reduced the amounts of butter and half-and-half, substituting skim milk for part of the cream.  I toasted the almonds b/4 putting them in, and waited till the end to add the cream.  It thickens as a left-over, so I thinned it even more with skim milk, which didn't take away from the richness one bit.

Excellent soup.  Smooth and very tasty.  I did leave out the almonds, however, since I didn't have any on hand.  Although I love almonds, I don't think the recipe lost very much by doing that.  I'd definitely recommend this one to soup lovers!  Next time I'll use the crockpot.

This is terrific!  Throw everything in the slow cooker raw and let it go for 6 hours.  Add cream or half and half at the end.

Great recipe, was looking for something different for our winter rotation of meals and something I could maybe freeze part of. I really enjoyed it , my husband did too, and would do a few things small different next time just for my preference. 

Here are the changes I did make this time based mostly on not being able to eat dairy and also not wanting to cook elements ahead of time: So I did 1/2 vegan butter and half olive oil for the butter, only added about 1/4 cup flour, added 8 cups of chicken broth instead of 6, and added dry wild rice and 2 raw chicken breasts (skinless, bone-in) to the broth. I didn't have sherry so used a small splash of red wine vinegar, and did 1 cup of coconut milk instead of cream, which I added once the chicken was cooked and shredded, and finished it off with 1 lime's worth of juice. Phew! It turned out delicious, and thick (which I think it's supposed to be!).

Next time, I'll add even more chicken broth like 10 cups maybe 12, I'll double the curry powder because I like that flavour in there and just wanted more, I'll try and actually use sherry or white wine because I think that would taste great. It worked great throwing the raw chicken and rice in there and I would for sure not cook them separate again! Sorry for posting with all the changes, but just in case someone wants to take the dairy out I thought I'd offer what I did. Also, I will keep the small amount of flour, as it added a little thickness without the paste like flavour that somet

From Minnesota: it’s official this is Great soup! I read all the reviews prior and made these changes: no butter, subbed 2 TBSP evoo,  I sautéd with fresh garlic first, then the onion, celery mushrooms, etc and used 1/4c flour only. I didn t have the dry sherry so I put in more chicken broth and added some water. The wild rice I used (grown in MN) was very dense so the additional broth worked well. I always use reduced sodium broth as well. Added the half and half just at the end. Fantastic! Will be making again!

i was a tasty change in soups.  i added two cups extra liquid and only one cup of rice and  cooked the rice with everything except the meat, resulting in no need to make a rouge. it was nice and thick.

I had left over veggies from a veggie dip kicking around and this popped into my email box as a daily recipe video. I had all those veggies including broccoli and Red peppers too.... so chop chop into the skillet.... followed the video (sort of ...I don't measure )  and the rest was a breeze.  FANTASTIC!! OYEZ!

I love this recipe. I am from Minnesota and have tried many versions of wild rice soup. This is by far the best. There are a few changes I have made after making this recipe several times. I like to use more curry powder to amp up the chicken flavor. I will either skip the sherry or use a light beer instead. I will also use some finely chopped pancetta or bacon. The saltiness and depth of flavor the pancetta adds is totally worth trying when you make it this wonderful soup. I make a double batch and it is gone in two days.

We love this! I add fresh rosemary and do the recipe in a crock pot.  An hour or so before we serve it we use the flour cream and butter and mix it in a sauce pan to make the roux. Delicious!!!

Second time making this recipe.  My grandchildren loved it.  I  did reduce the butter greatly and also the flour.  Butter to a couple of tbsps. and flour to approx. 1/2 cup.  First time only added 1 cup half & half and that was plenty.  I use 1 tbsp. of a curry blend spice & it is excellent. Did not use almonds or sherry - didn't have.   Most forgiving recipe - just taste and observe as you go along.

I followed the ingredient list exactly (except for reducing flour to 1/2 cup), but I put everything raw in the crock pot and cooked on high for the afternoon. I added the half & half just before serving. Super easy and delicious!

This is my favorite soup that I make and it garners a lot of requests so I make huge batches, several times a year.  At first I was suspicious of the almonds...if you're like me, just try it...so good!  I do add a little extra curry powder and an extra tablespoon of sherry but it's pretty perfect as is!

This recipe is perfect for cold rainy days and has the perfect thickness  with the flour. Made a few changes for my own liking. I added 2 chopped zucchinis, 3 carrots, no half and half, doubled salt for taste and used chicken half breasts with bone and skin for more flavor in the soup broth. I boiled the chicken breast half and used the water as the chicken broth along with some store bought  broth -which is why I probably needed more salt but it always tastes fresher when I do this. I didn't have wild rice so I boiled orzo in chicken broth and added it in the soup (including the broth) since I omitted the cream and it needed more broth. I let it simmer for about 1.5 hours but I think I left it on too high temp because it came out sort of mushy. Next time I will put it on the lowest temperature on the dial so this does not happen.

Used regular rice instead of wild, still delicious.  Note that 2 cups of uncooked rice absorbed all the liquid and more, so I'd cut that amount in half.

Wow! Is this soup great! I made mine in the crockpot, with changes I read about here: but I did throw all the vegies in the frying pan first. Then, I just put them all in the crockpot and let it cook on low for 7 hours. I also reduced the brown rice (my husband can't stand wild rice!) and put in more broth, as well as doubled the amount of curry. Excellent soup! I'm sending this recipe to my friends NOW!

Thick and good, tasted like something from a restaurant.  Made in the crock pot:  sauteed onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, and added flour and broth.  Poured into crock pot with rest (except half and half), low for 8 hours.  Stirred in the half an d half maybe 30 minutes before serving.

This was delish!  My sister-in-law gave me a bag of wild rice so I looked for a recipe & found this one. I made it for dinner & we all loved it. My picky 17y/o son thought it was great.     Of course I doctored it a bit.     
I used 1/4 C olive oil w the 3/4 C flour instead of a 1/2 C butter & it thickened beautifully. I used 2-1/2 C of shredded rotisserie chicken bcs that's what I had on hand & added 4 large cloves of fresh minced garlic bcs we love garlic.      
 I also added more: carrots (4 large), celery (4 ribs) & onions (2 med) & omitted the mushrooms bcs I didn't have any.  I'm sure that mushrooms would be a great addition.      
For health reasons we don't use heavy cream, so I used unsweetened almond milk.  I also used unsalted chicken stock instead of chicken broth.   
After I mixed everything up & added the broth, almond milk & slivered almonds, I thought it was a little bland for my family's tastes so I doubled the curry, mustard powder, & pepper. 
 I let it simmer for 2 hours & served it w fresh beer bread & a salad. Yum!      Note: I thought the slivered almonds seemed odd, but it was  a great addition.  Freezes well!

I left out the curry and mustard. Added about 2-3 cups more water and used milk instead of half and half. Also sautéed the vegetables in olive oil instead of butter. Also used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts since that is what I had on hand.

One of the most delicious chicken soups I've ever eaten.  Like other reviewers, I skipped the roux-and-cream additions and doubled the amount of curry.  The ingredients blended perfectly together into spicy, silky, chicken-y goodness.  Thanks for this one!

My family and I really liked this soup.  I made a few changes.  First, I forgot the mushrooms at the store.  They would have added great flavor.  We have to be dairy-free due to intolerances so I used coconut oil in place of the butter and only used about a 1/4c vs. 1/2c.  I will reduce the flour by half next time around.  I also replaced the half and half with Almond Milk.  I added extra of all the seasonings and a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar to the soup to give it a little more depth.  We will definitely make this again.

This is a perfect recipe.  I did not have Sherry so I used dry white wine in its place, other than that it was to recipe.  Thanks for the great soup.

I added turnips and peas, and subbed a tablespoon of prepared Dijon mustard for the teaspoon of dry mustard, Marsala wine for the sherry, and duck broth for the chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. Didn't have the parsley so skipped it. I waited to add the half-n-half till it was done cooking and after tasting it and thinking it was pure heaven decide against adding it. I have never made or eaten  the chicken and wild rice soup that my husband from the Midwest has asked for, but he told me this is one of the best he's tasted. I thought it was amazing. I think the basics set you up for a great foundation, and there's a lot of room to do your own thing.

Made a larger batch, so I added more of everything except for the butter. I didn't use the flour past, I used corn starch to thicken.

Excellent! No Sherry... and it was still fantastic!...A labor of love and it really tastes like it! Made it twice and will continue to do so, Tastes so good...especially on a frigid Minnesota Day!  (Salt and Pepper to taste...too much will over-power).

I'm originally from Minnesota, and I'm very familiar with wild rice soups.  I've been looking for a recipe to compare to ones used back home, and I'm happy I took a chance on this one!  I made very few changes, and it turned out wonderfully!  First, I used canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh ones on hand.  I also used a wild and long grain rice mixture instead of just using wild rice.  My husband didn't grow up around wild rice, so using only wild rice is too much for him.  It turned out to be a hearty soup with a ton of flavor!  There's plenty to freeze, and I know I'll be making this again.

Great soup! The whole family loved it, including my 3 and 5 yr-old.  I needed to sub brown rice for the wild since I was out. I added it in raw to the broth and cooked it a bit longer before adding the cream. It worked just fine.

I made this just as instructed, only left out the chicken as I was serving this soup as a side with chicken salad for a luncheon. The soup was well received. I did notice the longer it cooked beyond the two hours, it became very thick, like oatmeal. Simple enough to thin down with extra stock. I have plenty left over and can't wait to try it again as you know soup always tastes better the next day.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and sautéed the veggies before putting everything (except the half & half) in the crock pot.  I made only a half recipe for my first attempt and cut the uncooked chicken into small bite sized pieces so it only needed to cook for 4 hours on low, then added the half & half for the last hour.  The only change I will make next time is to leave out the almonds, I love nuts but I didn't care for the texture of them in the soup.  But I will definitely be making this again!

Made this with a few mods and was happy with it: used 1 cup of uncooked rice (which I cooked before adding); used 1.5 tsp of curry powder, dbled (at least) amounts of pepper and parsley; added 2 extra cups of broth; doubled amounts of veggies; cut flour to a few TBSP more than 1/3 cup.

Delicious! Made wheat/dairy free. Substituted 1/4 cornstarch for the flour and 1 1/2 C of coconut milk and doubled the spices. Had some home made chicken broth. Seriously the best soup ever. Was super thick.

This is a great tasting soup! It did not take long to prepare and was easy. I did not like the slithered almonds in it. It  added too much texture and very crunchy.  I did use more butter than the recipe called for while sauteing my veggies. I also added 2 minced garlic cloves to this recipe. All in all I will make this again without the slithered almonds.  It pairs well with a french baguette of some kind for dipping into the soup.

I used the left over meat from a rotisserie chicken  and Uncle Ben's wild rice from the night before.....and, instead of heavy cream, I used a can of cream of celery soup and a little less butter and flour.  I also used a 1/4 cup of fresh flat leaf parsley instead of dry parsley.  I didn't have almonds, so I left those out.  It came out SOOOOO delicious!  It is the perfect comfort food for a rainy day.

This is a great recipe for the crockpot. I don't cook the wild rice or chicken first I throw everything but the cream in and add extra chicken broth.

This soup is delicious.  Next time I think I will try using less flour. Also, I thought putting almonds in soup seemed kinda weird, but they are really good in this soup.  I will definitely make this soup again.  Thanks.

If you like it like this, add the zest and juice of a lime..... fabulous!    I used 1/2 the butter and flour, double the curry powder, 2 cloves of minced garlic and the lime zest and juice, we are in LOVE!!!

Excellent soup!!! Will be making again. I added extra wild rice so it will go further and feed my whole family. Not sure if I will add the curry powder next time though.

I only use 3/4 the amount of almonds it called for. Before I left it to simmer I tasted it and decided to increase the seasons. I double the curry powder like others suggested and I also added a little more salt and parsley. I used fat free half and half for this and I let it simmer for one hour. It was very creamy and hearty. It wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping for. None of the flavors really stood out. I would suggest lowering the amount of flour if you're going to try this.

I follow the recipe and it was very good. I had guests over and they all had seconds and thirds. I thought it was a little bland, since I was expecting a little more chicken stock flavor, but it was very good. Will be making this again soon. Thank you for sharing!

My family's favorite chicken wild rice soup recipe! In the cold winter months in Minnesota this recipe is a staple!! Make this soup exactly as recipe reads & you will not be disappointed! Nothing needs to be changed! Making it with your own homemade chicken stock is the way to go & is so easy! I make stock every time I have chicken bones & freeze until I need it. Homemade stock always makes a tastier soup!

I found the taste of the flour to be too strong. However, I know this is what makes the consistency perfect. So here is what I did to make it even better: Squeeze one lemon into the pot and add 2-3 chicken cubes. PERFECT!

Really what's not to like about this? It was delicious. For the record, I added a bit more curry as it is an amazing addition. I used chicken from a Costco roasted bird and left out the sherry as I didn't have any. After the step 1 stuff, simmer until it's a bit thickened. Once you add the cooked rice etc from step 2, just simmer it for a little bit to let the flavors come together and have it thicken just a bit more. 1-2 hours is way too much. Enjoy!

I too three the ingredients in the crock pot & walked away. The adjustments I made after reading others reviews were I omitted the roux. I halved the amount of chicken broth & found the wild rice adsorbed the excess just enough to make it naturally thicker. I also reduced the half & half to taste. It was the most satisfying soup I've had in ages! It's a keeper!

Amazing soup with a thickness that is filling - truly a meal in and of itself on a cold day.  I used a food processor for the onions and celery for a smoother texture too.  Recommend serving with a loaf of french bread and sliced avocado with lemon and salt.  Officially a favorite.

I added 1 cup uncooked wild rice rather than cook it separately.  Turned out just as good.  I also used turkey meat and broth.

This soup is wonderful!  I added extra minced mushrooms so there was more "fungus among us." :-) Highly recommend if your looking for a soup that can be used as a main dish, or the first or second course in a larger meal.  Bravo!

I finely dice the carrots.  I use heavy cream.  I add more sherry (and I throw a dash in towards the very end).  I leave out the almonds.  But I think all of those changes are minimal enough for me to say that this is a really great recipe, even as written.  I cook a bunch of wild rice all at once (in chicken broth), and then freeze it in portions that are the right side for this soup.

I increased the vegetables but followed the rest of the recipe. This is a fabulous soup! I made my own chicken stock from a fresh chicken instead of already baked at the store. I have never made stock before but I will be making it from now on.  So much flavor and I did not add any salt so it turned out to be a low sodium stock.  I only wish they would give you the carbs, sugars, calories etc as I am diabetic and this would help alot.  I just found the button for all of the nutritian info, this is the first time I have used this web cite so sorry for above.

I made this but after making several soups I did make some changes. I chopped the carrots and mushrooms as well as all the other vegetables. I also substituted heavy cream for the half and half. I also doubled everything and took to work. Everyone raved about the texture and the addition of the almonds. Will definitely do again.

This is soooo good!  I added a little dried rosemary at the end and it brought it all together.  I didn't have sherry and I used almond milk instead of half and half.  I cooked the rice in the soup and added extra water to allow for that.  I used rotisserie chicken meat.  I'll make this again and again!

At the very end I take about 1/3 cup of flour and very cold half n half and stir that up.  Then I add that mixture into the soup to thicken it... a little at a time constantly stirring... it will thicken as it get hot again.  Don't get it too thick... my 1st time it was like a stew instead of a soup.  My family just loves it, there is never enough to freeze!

Extraordinary.  I'm from Minnesota.  Wild rice soup is on the menu everywhere.  This is the best I have had.  But, if you can find it, use Indian harvested and prepared wild rice.  They parch the rice over an open fire giving it a mildly woodsy taste.

EXCELLENT recipe with a few minor changes... I almost doubled both the carrots and celery and will add even more next time. I also sauteed (in 6 tablespoons butter with a splash of olive oil to prevent the butter from burning) 3 cloves minced garlic with the vegetables and a whole large onion. I added 3 cups wild rice which was cooked for about 50 minutes, it was perfectly cooked and not at all mushy after sitting in the soup for 2 hours. After reading reviews about how thick it was I was a bit nervous, but, though thick, it wasn't too thick. I also accidentally added about 1 1/2 cups of flour (thought that that was what the recipe called for) and it still turned out okay, I just added an extra can of chicken broth and it was the perfect consistency. I added the full 2 cups half and half about an hour before serving, I know that a lot of reviewers added less or none at all but I really liked the creamy taste it gave it and wouldn't recommend getting rid of it. Mine did not turn out bland like some reviewers complained, but that is probably because I always season to taste. Be sure to season the chicken well as this will definitely help with the flavor, I seasoned with plenty of  salt, pepper, garlic powder, and hot curry powder. I also almost doubled the spices, and after tasting added even more curry powder about a half hour before serving. The curry is GENIUS in this soup, it really makes it, so be sure to include it! I really wanted the curry to pop which is why I was sure

Delicious. I don't use curry normally but it does seem to bring out the "chickeny" flavor. Great soup as it finally got cold in the mid-Atlantic.

I made it. It was delicious!
I followed the recipe except I used chopped fresh parsley instead of dried (it tastes better), doubled the curry powder and ground mustard and used less flour - it was perfect. My teenage son loved it too. I'd definitely make this again. :)

The first time I made this I accidentally doubled the almonds.  I loved it.  However, other family members complained.  So now, I make it for everyone and add almonds after the first of two scoops into my bowl while everyone else has it plain.  I did find that the brand of wild rice used can make the favor fuller, but honestly, it was good no matter what.

What can I say? This soup is heavenly. I've made it twice, first time without the almonds, second time with. Both ways are delish!

I was a little disappointed with how this turned out- given that it had such great ratings. I followed the recipe to a T. The consistency turned out perfect, but the flavor was very bland in my opinion. After tasting it a final time I decided to add a bullion cube and thyme seasoning. This seemed to give it some additional flavor.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I dont really know how to cook much, but my hub loves CWRS. I wanted to make CWRS as a treat for him and this was the recipe I found and followed. I couldnt find dry sherry at the Cub Food grocery store so that was the only thing I left out. Also for less calories, I used 1 cup of cashew milk (25 calories) and 1 cup of half and half instead of the 2 cups of half and half. He says its better than Eddington's! So I'll take that as a fine compliment! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! Its extra special here in frigid cold Minnesota!
Also, after the soup was cooked, I transferred it over to my crockpot to have it simmered.

Really Good!  Didn't have chicken SO substituted the chicken  for cooked ground beef (browned and drained), beef broth instead of chicken broth and beer instead of  sherry.  I also doubled the broth for more of a liquid consistency rather then stew.  It was delicious!!  Serve with a crusty bread and sprinkle some cheese on top of the soup!

Ok I am that obnoxious person that changed the recipe. i basically took all the weird stuff out ( So no mustard or curry powder or almonds or sherry) The soup was amazing though! I followed most of the rest of the recipe to the tee. the only thing i did differently was make my own quick broth which was super easy. boil frozen chicken thighs in water with salt, carrot, celery, 3 cloves of garlic, and one small onion quartered for an hour, strain out broth into bowl, then shred chicken and proceed with recipe. it really is a good base for chicken and wild rice soup!

This was fantastic.  I made as directed except I didn't have any sherry so I substituted vermouth.  Very rich and delicious.

I made this last night not planning on eating any until supper tonight. At 10pm I had a bowl and so did my husband, even though he had been to a work supper!! 

We are blown away by the flavour. I didn't have wild rice so used white and I just made the roux and put in all other ingredients using boneless chicken thighs. I think they are more flavourful. Chicken extremely tender, curry and mustard and sherry are such an unusual combo, BUT wow!. Didn't need the cream as far as I am concerned.

Would make this again and again. My true test will be if my son and his family like it. They really like my former chicken and wild rice soup.
Great for clearing out the sinuses too.

Excellent soup.  I made it as directed except I used almond flour and white wine instead of all purpose flour and sherry.  Also, I pureed it after sauteing the vegetables since I'm not a fan of the texture of mushrooms.   Next time I make this I'll leave out the almonds; it was strange to me to have something hard/crunchy in soup.

Used rotisserie chicken to save time and skipped adding salt. Always a hit with crowds and I leave with an empty crock pot every time!

This was delicious, even my picky two and four year olds ate it. I really love the addition of the almonds! I wasn't doing measurements for my broth, chicken, mushrooms and wild rice, and think I added more of each than the recipe called for but it turned out great. I used a wonderful bone broth I made the previous night after roasting a chicken. We're living abroad right now so I used 1 cup of heavy cooking cream and 1 cup of whole milk, rather than half and half. If I made it again, I think I'd try adding the rice later in the process as I like the wild rice in it's chewier state (as it is after cooking it per the instructions, vs. after cooking it and then letting it cook again for 1-2 hours with the soup). Overall, delicious and it made a lot so I'm hoping it freezes well and that we can enjoy it in a month or two.

Followed Cynthia's suggestion and made this one in the crockpot - put all ingredients in (except cream) set it on high (stirring hourly) for about 4 hours.  I used 2-13oz cans of cooked/chunked chicken breast.  Super easy and so yummy!

This is my favorite chicken and wild rice soup.  The taste is just right but you can use a little extra curry if you like.  You can also use rotisserie chicken to save time.  Remove any skin and chop the chicken.

I like this recipe. I have a habit of changing things no matter what recipe I use unless I'm baking. the changes I made: 64oz of chicken broth one low sodium one regular. I roughly chopped the onion, 1 cup of celery, 1 tsp of curry powder, .5 tsp poultry seasoning. 10 baby carrots sliced. 1 rotisserie chicken (I used the thighs, breast and drumsticks) dice the meat, no skin, add the fat from the chicken to the soup. 4 cloves of garlic. The chicken saved me some time. This soup hit the spot. I Waddington feeling well and I wanted a one pot meal. This turned out great. I would certainly make it again with my changes. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I made changes so I can't speak for the recipe as it is without tampering. Also for anyone looking for sherry, Jewel has Sheffield very dry sherry. though I honestly don't feel like it's necessary in the recipe.

My daughter made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it.  She doubled the recipe so I could have some in my freezer when she went home.  The only thing she changed was to exclude the mushrooms because she does not like them.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe just as written and it was a BIG HIT.  I had to leave out the almonds because I didn't have any, but i KNOW they would have been excellent to give it some crunchy texture.  We have a bag of wild rice from our trips to Minnesota that has just been sitting for lack of good recipes.  THANKS SO MUCH for this one!!  (add more than two chicken breasts, tho)  I wasn't sure how much a pound of chicken breasts was, so I only used 2.  Mistake.

Hubby and I loved this soup.  He ended up eating three bowls in a row.  I was hoping to freeze some, but by tomorrow, it might all be gone!  The flavor was complex and altogether awesome.  I used leftover “Forbidden Rice with Lime” (black rice), and two chicken breasts that I had cooked Sous Vide, and then frozen.  Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely (except cut the butter to ¾ stick, and cut the flour to ½ cup).  I sautéed the veggies in the butter in a saucepan, stirred in the flour, then the chicken broth.  Added the spices, chicken and rice, brought to a simmer, and put it all in my crockpot on low for about 4 hours, then added about ½ cup of half & half.  Served with slices of Asiago Parmesan bread, which we tore into pieces and dropped into the soup.  I feel the Sherry, the mustard powder, and especially the curry, are key to the flavor of this soup.  Next time, I think I will add the chicken and the rice later, during the last hour of cooking.  I think this will keep the chicken from drying out a bit, and the rice from getting a bit mushy.  Overall, this was great.  It is definitely a keeper for us.

We loved this soup.  Worried a bit about the curry powder because I didn't want an Indian sort of soup.  But it's just a touch to add a unique flavor that enhances the chicken flavors and not overwhelming at all.  Pay attention to the part about not boiling or the roux will break, it did!  But it still tasted great.  I am trying it again but will be more careful to not let it boil at the end! I made it from scratch using some frozen chicken pieces that I wanted to use up and followed the recipe with no changes except for cutting back on the butter to 1/2 stick and with the cream at the end.  Just use as needed to get the consistency you want.

It is an excellent recipe. I added an italian chicken sausage, like somebody suggested in reviews,  and for a better flavor - 1/2 teaspoon cumin and just a tiny pinch of cinnamon. Right at the end of cooking I added chopped kale get it to boiling and turned it off - for making it even more nutricional. This is one of the best recipes I tried for this soup.

This is my favorite soup and this recipe does it justice.  I had boiled some gizzards earlier so I used that stock with the broth and thickened it toward the end.  It is a great recipe.  thank you.

Okay, I hardly ever take the time to review a recipe- mainly because I'm not usually overwhelmed with it's success. This recipe, however, is amazing. I've made it twice now, and both times it was a hit. BOTH my children love it (which is huge) and company gobbled it up as well. I followed the recipe, except I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any, and used coconut milk in place of the half and half. So delicious! and the texture is very rich. Thank you!

Tried this recipe for Christmas Day lunch - big hit ! Family said this soup 'knocked it out of the park.' Serves a crowd, and is great leftover.  Subbed Merlot for the dry sherry, left out almonds (nut allergy) and parsley (Kroger was sold out) otherwise stayed on the path.  Both kids and adults cleaned the bowls and went back for more. So glad this one was shared here ! 
Will make this again, for sure.

Excellent recipe! I have made this recipe several times.  When I take it to "pot lucks" at work, I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe. And family member request this for get-togethers.
I double the seasonings (except the salt) and the sherry. I also put in a bit extra of celery,carrots and chicken.  I also shred the carrots. Great recipe!

As I was getting ready to make this today for the umpteenth time, it occurred to me that I have never left a rating!! I make this decadent delight once a year, after Thanksgiving, with my leftover turkey. It's my favorite use for leftover turkey! So delish! The mustard & curry powders are key ingredients. The flavors they impart make this taste so gourmet!  The crunch of the almonds take this over the top! I may love this more than Thanksgiving dinner itself!! Thanks Sue!!

Absolutely loved this soup. I did omit a few things such as the mushrooms because my hubby is allergic and the carrots because I don't like cooked carrots. The soup was super easy to make and makes a large batch so it's great for leftovers. I am making it again this weekend, but am choosing to omit the almonds. It was odd to have the crunch of the almond, but the softness of the broth and chicken. For my husband it just threw him off a little.

Wonderful soup for a cold winter day!  The flavor is amazing.  I added more carrots, celery and mushrooms (double) and also doubled the curry as suggested.  Skipped the almonds because I didn't have any.  Also used Chardonnay instead of sherry.  Great recipe!  I'll definitely make it again soon.

Doubled the curry, subbed baby spinach for mushrooms, doubled carrots since I didn't have celery on hand, and cut the flour to half cup.  I baked the chicken with evoo, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, parsley.  Also increased rice.  Fantastic!  Loved the curry spice.

This was a whole lot of work for not a whole lot of taste. In fact, the taste reminded me of bland baby food until I added about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, which definitely make it much better. Also, I had omitted the salt, thankfully, because the broth I used was already quite salty. The consistency was okay. It only took about an hour to simmer and thicken up, but I had used one cup half and half and one cup full cream. Perhaps it would have taken a bit longer to thicken had I used all half and half instead. I think there are probably other recipes out there for chicken and wild rice soup that have a lot more flavor, but perhaps this is a good base to use and then add your own extra seasonings. I quite liked the almonds in this, and was surprised that they remained a bit crunchy despite having cooked for so long. But if you do like crunchy nuts in otherwise soft things, you may want to skip them.

Was delicious. A few changes were needed though: I used 4 carrots and 3 celery stalks, 1/2 cup of each would have been way too few. Also I would cut back on, or eliminate, the almonds - the soup was quite crunchy.

I added spinach instead of mushrooms and used batsmatti rice since I had it on hand.  Instead of half and half, I used a little milk.  Overall the soup was really thick, so each bowl I mad I stirred in some extra chicken broth.

This is my go-to recipe for chicken wild rice soup, and it gets rave reviews from family and friends. I've also used leftover turkey instead of chicken. For optimum results, follow the directions closely, and don't overheat it (see step 2). Thanks, Sue, for a wonderful recipe!

Very disappointed in the lack of flavor in what should be a rich and creamy deeply-bodied soup.  When you get a great bowl at a restaurant, it is divine.  As someone who makes lots of soups, looking for a terrific recipe for this soup not in my repertoire.  Came away thinking something is not right.  There is 8 cups of fluid in this dish with not much to flavor it.  Ladled a small bowl and tried the curry...didn't resound with me, and I love curry!  Plus, there are tons of curries, so which curry flavors did she use?  Parsley doesn't add flavor, especially if cooked long and low, just a touch of color.  Mustard just adds tang, but with 8 cups liquid, it was meaningless.  Something is missing.

Sometimes I think I should not rate the recipe if I don't follow it exactly -- I made some minor changes and still think its 5 star! I did not have almonds or sherry on hand, and replaced the half and half with whole milk. The dried mustard and curry gave it a lovely rich flavor. WIll definitely make this again!

I too am a Minnesotan, and I love this soup! I made this recipe as is (except I left out the mushrooms because I'm not a fan), and I received lots of compliments at the party for which I made the soup. Another time, since 1 cup of  uncooked wild rice makes 3 cups, I went ahead and put in all 3 cups of cooked wild rice and omitted the almonds. Also, since I'm lactose-intolerant, I decided to substitute 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup low fat lactose free milk in place of the half and half. I was able to eat it without an upset stomach and without taking pills. The soup came out really creamy and delicious, and the texture was better than before. I still give this recipe five stars!

This is a fantastic soup! Quick and easy! I followed other reviewers suggestions and sautéed celery, carrots, mushrooms (if I have them), and onions with a little bit of butter or olive oil then add the chicken, broth, and water. I definitely think the added vegetables makes it a more heartier soup, and anything to add more vegetables to my kid's meal, I am all in! =)

This is my favorite soup recipe. I add a bit more rice to make it thinker and a whole habanero pepper while it simmers to add a little extra flavor, and remove before serving. It turns out perfect every time!

This was a great tasting soup I did have a little trouble with lumps from the flour... However I am pretty sure that was from my lack of experience.  Aside from that it was probably the best soup I have made :)

Great, classic recipe. I didn't love the curry... might omit it next time. My changes: added at least 50% more veggies (personal preference), and will make some changes to reduce the fat. I found it a little too rich to feel good about eating it! :) So, next time: less butter and 1c. milk substitution for half & half. Still deserves 5 stars. I especially love the almonds.

The slivered almonds are the clincher for me in making this an incredible soup.  As another way to spice it up, I added dry chow mein noodles instead of crackers.  The extra crunch along with the almonds just gives it a unique texture and flavor.


It does make an awful lot, but I found that I can freeze half of it and thaw it out for a week of lunches.  The base of the soup does break down a little bit, but once reheated, it smooths back out well enough to be very enjoyable.

This was so very good.  I followed the recipe as written (almost), adding a little more rice, just my preference.  Oh, I didn't have any sherry so I used dry white wine.  Very tasty on this 10 degree evening.  Served with rosemary & olive oil crusty bread.

Made this with 2 percent milk, made roux then transferred to crock pot as my saucepan was not large enough. Will try it all in one step in crock pot next time, as suggested. Made without chicken (only broth), without parsley or sherry. Added 1 extra chicken boulion cube because of not having sherry or cooking wine to add for flavor. Was still wonderful. Had to add small amount more flour to thicken a little more to my taste but this was easy enough to mix a little flour and cold water together then stir it in. Will try adding more curry or serve with a sprinkle on top.

Soup was tasty. Used some other reviewers suggestions on cutting back on butter and cream and would probably reduce even further next time.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was a hit.  Not too thin, not too thick.  I used 6T corn starch instead of the flour to be gluten free, will try arrow root powder (6T) next time.  My family doesn't care for curry, so I used thyme instead.

The soup was delicious! My four kids and husband had seconds and give this two thumbs up! The only thing I changed was splitting up the butter with some grapeseed oil so that it wouldn't burn while I was sautéing the vegetables. I also followed another reviewer's advice by using only 3 Tbsp. of flour for the roux because we didn't want the soup to be too thick and shredded the chicken before adding it so that it could go a long way. The flavor was satisfying and comforting, especially since today was -20F! Thank you for sharing!

My review is for my reference since I can no longer make personal notes or custom recipes.  The first time I made this it was a three star, but with these changes it is very good. I used my pressure cooker to cook two good sized boneless skinless chicken breast, adding in three cloves of mince garlic and seasoning with pepper, dried parsley, shakes of celery seed, and wee bit of salt. I browned the breast on each side and used four cups of water to cover the chicken, this was part of my chicken broth for the soup. I did use two boxes of Rice a Roni wild rice since with seasoning, cooking that in my cast iron skillet. I used my large stock pot for the vegetables, two medium sweet onions, four sliced carrots, four sliced ribs of celery, 8 ounces of sliced portabella mushrooms. I used a bit over half stick of butter and a tablespoon or so of olive oil. Only used a half cup of flour and that was plenty, no more is needed. I used a total of 6 cups chicken broth for the liquid, with added chicken bouillon packet, 16 ounces of half and half. Followed the directions for preparing, omitted the almonds but added fresh chopped parsley, and only simmered the final soup for about a half hour, husband was very hungry and it was perfectly fine. My electric stove top was starting to scald,  even with constant stirring.

Fantastic!  I doubled the carrots and celery and added a little bit of chicken powder.  I did not add the half-and-half.  It was thick enough and the taste was outstanding.  The almonds are a great touch!

Yum!!! We loved it! I doubled the carrots, rice, curry and dry mustard. I didn't have sherry so, I used 1 1/2 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar. I used evaporated milk instead of half and half and I didn't make a roux, I used cornstarch.  I forgot all about the almonds but will truly it next time. Very satisfying!

Very delicious soup! I omitted the slivered almonds and added a bit more curry powder, mustard, and black pepper than the recipe calls for; I also added a dash of cayenne.  I added a little minced garlic to the pan when I sautéed the mushrooms, too.

Through all the years and recipes I have used allrecipes.com, this is my very first review. I was compelled to write one because I love this soup so much! I have made it a few times and follow the recipe as it reads with a few changes.I boil chicken breasts with the bone and skin on and then use this liquid for the soup. Instead of using regular all-purpose flour, I use Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All-Purpose flour. I have had some BAD GF experiences in the past. However, this one works well :) Also, I do not add the half-and-half or the sherry. I also add 1 1/2 cups uncooked rice (3/4 cup wild, 3/4 cup brown) and 3 extra cups of liquid. One final addition, I followed another recommendation from one of the reviews and doubled the curry powder. But checked on the flavor as the soup cooked (due to the additional liquid)...I ended up adding an additional 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder (a total of 1 1/2 teaspoons) and added more salt and pepper to taste. Thank you, Sue, for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Super tasty.  I used canned mushrooms and red wine in place of sherry because we didn't have the others on hand.  Still super tasty and pretty easy, just takes a little time.

This recipe was awesome! I made one change to the recipe. To make this recipe gluten-free, I used coconut flour instead of regular flour and WOW! It made the soup just a little bit sweet, which was perfect. My roommate and I would have eaten all of it in one sitting if it wasn't so filling.

I love this recipe!  Everytime I serve it, it gets rave reviews even from my 3 and 5 year old kids!  I use a rotisserie chicken picked up at the store and put in all the juices from the chicken too.  Large bag of frozen peas and carrots add extra veggies that the kids will eat.  I also use the concentrated chicken stock.  Love the curry! Delicious!!!

Just made this soup tonight.  Delish! The husband loved it too.  I did add a little more chicken and a few cups extra of home made stock. Also, I had a bag of frozen "steamers" wild rice and veggies that I threw in there.  Saved 45 Min cooking it on the stovetop!  Will totally make it again! Thanks for the post Sue!

This soup is absolutely delicious! I used a rotisserie chicken for extra flavor and it was divine. The soup is very hearty and filling. I didn't use sherry or almonds, but added frozen peas. I'll definately be making this again!

Cooked this for a lunch.  I placed it in a crock pot.  If you do this it would probably be a good idea to add another cup of broth or water.  It was pretty thick.  But it was still very good.

Excellent ! We omitted the mushrooms and used cooking sherry. We also used whole milk from a dairy farm for 1/2 of the half and half. The flavor was amazing ! Great recipe! Will definitely make again!

Easily the BEST chicken wild rice soup recipe ever. We have a smoker, and I use smoked chicken in mine. I've made it for my family and they begged for the recipe--and they have since made it too!

We didn't have a chance to grab some sherry, but we made it without and it was absolutely wonderful! The only change I would make would be to add a bit more rice. Great recipe!

This was delicious! My husband is gluten and dairy free so I substituted corn starch for the flour (mixed it in with some of the broth and then added) and used plain rice milk in place of the half and half. It turned out great.

We really enjoyed this.  We used homemade chicken stock and leftover meat from a roasted chicken dinner a few days ago.  I didn't cook it as long as called for in the recipe.  We let it simmer about 30 minutes (without the half-and-half), then added the half-and-half and let it cook about another 10 minutes.  Ditched the dried parsley, and added fresh right before serving.  I also didn't have any wild rice, and used cooked brown rice instead which worked fine.  We didn't care for the addition of the almonds, and will not put them in next time.  Overall, a great soup, and a good use for our stock and leftover chicken meat.

I found this recipe to be very bland.I would suggest only using maybe 2-3 T. butter with a little oil so the butter doesn't burn.  
  Also I would use spicy curry instead of regular and add a little more than the recipe says. i did not put in the almonds. Personally, I wouldn't make this recipe again soon.

Excellent flavor!  Definitely will make again.
Love this recipe!  ?? Easy, delicious and doubling the curry enhances the flavor (and we are not fans of curry).

This is delicious! I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store and I think that made it even better. I also added a bit more salt (since my broth was low sodium) and some garlic powder. Took this and some homemade yeast rolls to a family who just had a bably and they LOVED it. Can't wait to make it again. The half and half makes it creamy and wonderful.

Yummo!  Used a white/wild rice blend, 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup flour (I had eight cups of chicken broth), used some white wine in place of sherry, no dry mustard, added a bit of thyme and poultry seasoning - basically made the soup with what I had on hand.  This is DEFINITELY a keeper - very delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

We had wild rice casserole, which contains almonds, mushrooms and butter, for Christmas dinner, so I made this soup with home made turkey stock, leftover turkey, and leftover wild rice casserole.  Amended with some more mushrooms and slivered almonds as directed in the original recipe, and also used whole milk rather than cream.  Everybody loved it (and nobody complained that they thought it was left overs!).

Love this soup! I read other reviews before making soup. I left out mustard powder, sherry, half&half,almonds and used only 1/3c flour and 2tbsp of butter + a little olive oil. It was some of the best soup I have ever had

Fantastic!! I would not change a thing. For those of you who are skeptical of the curry and mustard powder, as I also was, I assure you that this is one of those instances where you will not notice a pronounced flavor from either of them, but they will certainly be missed if you choose to omit them. I would be willing to bet that only the chef (you) will even know that these spices are present.  This recipe is as good, or better than any one of those served at the numerous MN restaurants I've worked at over the years.

This recipe was so good as is :) However my hubby thinks I knocked it out of the park and healthied it up a bit by sauteing the veggies in coconut oil (2T) and then adding coconut milk instead of the half and half! Yummy! Doubled the curry as well.

This was a tasty soup, I did omit the sherry and almonds, did not have any but it was good.It did come out a little thin, I had to make a roux and add it at the end and I also picked up some beautiful swiss chard at the farmers market that morning and added it for a little more vegetables, thanks for sharing a solid recipe.

OMG, this is a wonderful recipe!  I made a healthy version by substituting two 12 oz cans of fat free evaporated milk whisked with 1/4 cup flour instead of the butter, half and half and larger amount of flour.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly. Excellent!

I never knew chicken soup could taste so good! I added some very finely chopped red pepper with the celery, carrot and onion. I used a little bit more butter ;) and a little less half&half. I didn't have any sherry so I substituted with a dash of vodka (its all I had), a dash of apple cider vinegar and a tablespoon or so of brown sugar. What a fabulous soup. Thanks very much for the recipe.

I found this recipe on here a few years ago now. I was looking for something similar to a chicken wild rice soup I was in love with at a restaurant I used to work at but they closed. THIS IS RESTAURANT QUALITY! I've made it dozens of times now and it's always a huge hit and I always want more when it's gone. I make double batches so I can freeze it. I never have sherry so I haven't used that in the recipe though I have used some white wine if I have an open bottle. So good! Can't wait to have it again tonight!

This is amazing.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of curry powder and also used Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice instead of wild rice.  I only used 1/2 mushrooms and made them into small chunks.  Everyone in my family ate it including my picky 7 and 3 year old kids.  Definatly a keeper

SOO easy - SOO yummy!  I have a husband that never ate soup before we got married and he actually downed several bowls of this!  I have a chicken in the crockpot right now specifically for this recipe!  Will never make another chicken & Rice soup recipe but this one!  Kudos!

I added head of garlic (minced) to the saute with onions.  Nummy!  Left out mustard.  No need for salt if your broth has enough.  I didn't have broth on hand so I used a packet of chicken noodle soup mix and 4 tsp chicken bouillon powder.  Also, make sure your spices are fresh.

This soup was delicious!  The only change I made was to use a box of long grain & wild rice without the seasoning packet instead of all wild rice.  The package was the perfect amount and the soup was great.  Will definitely make this again.

So delicious. I brought the leftovers to work and everyone asked me to send them the recipe.
The picture is a bit deceiving, because I thought it would be more of a broth soup instead of so creamy. Still very delicious!

This soup was delicious, even the kids loved it!!  I prepared the soup as described, adding only 1/2 tsp garlic powder.
BUT when I got to the step of combining everything and getting ready to add the half and half, my husband tasted it and said the soup was amazing as it.  I agreed - to save a few calories you can go without the half and half and it is still delicious.  The sherry and the curry really do give it great flavor.

Very good. My picky family loved this and ate the leftovers for the next few days.  I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients and method and found that I needed more liquid. So, like other reviewers, I added about 2 cups more stock.  I still found it to be thick, like a stew, but my family and I loved it so I'm not upset by the mis-characterization. I will make this again, but I won't add as much flour.

This was wonderful, I only made one change.  I used fat free half and half instead of the real deal (gotta cut back where I can!), but it was still amazing.  Even my husband, who swears he doesn't like creamed soup loved it....finally I can make a creamed soup he will eat.

Run don't walk to your kitchen and make this fantastic wild rice soup! The best I have ever made or tasted (and I grew up on the stuff)!  ONE MODIFICATION.....double the curry - you won't regret it and I added 1/4 tsp ground white pepper!

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It was wonderful. I like curry and considered omitting the mustard but didn’t so I was so pleased when it came out so nice. The slivered almonds give it a crunch.  Very different flavors that made it different in a good way. Something I would expect to find in one of the high end restaurants in Los Angeles.  Thanks for this.

Excellent!  I added 1/2 tsp of thyme, would probably add a little more next time.  I halved the butter and i was still delicious.  I will probably try 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of low fat milke next time just to lighten it up a little bit.

Mmmmmm.....so delicious! Used a seasoned rotisserie chicken to add flavor, didn't have dry mustard so I used 1 tsp dijon instead, cooked the wild rice in chicken broth instead of water (again, to add flavor) and used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour, which of course doesn't change a thing, just wanted to point out to those trying to avoid gluten that it can be done with this recipe and still taste amazing. My daughter had friends over and one of them said as the soup was cooking "Do I smell Curry?" Who would have thought she could pick that out when there's only a half teaspoon in the recipe. All her teenage friends tried it and loved it...one even asked me to send her the recipe and said it tasted like Fall. Wish I could give it 6 stars because my super picky daughter loved it as well which means I have one more "go to" recipe for the family - bonus! Thank you!

Lotta of work. Did exactly like the recipe stated except sherry was trying to keep the cost down. Other than that every thing was as stated. Haven't set down to this yet but have tasted it and I think it will be a good feel good soup for fall. But don't know if I will do again because of the "prep" work involved and having to babysit it.  I did add extra salt just my preference. Can't wait to eat it but it wore me out cooking it. Everyone should try it once. Still a lovely soup. And makes your house smell awesome.

This is really good soup. I purposely left out the curry and mustard powders, almonds and sherry, and inadvertantly left out the half and half (realized I never added it after we already started eating, LOL) so my version is undoubtedly much different than it meant to be, but the way I made it is a very tasty, basic chicken & wild rice soup. It's thick and creamy even without the half and half. My whole family loves it, and that's rare.

YUM. I took a couple soups to a sick friend and she wanted to have this one first. She had no appetite but got it back after trying this soup. I love the recipe for only wild rice in it as it doesn't get so thick and mushy. I didn't use curry or mustard as she could not use strong taste. It was still wonderful. I also used a rotisserie chicken and used 1/2 for this and 1/2 for chicken noodle soup. I put in a little cooked bacon for a nice added flavor. I will make this for my family soon.

Great recipe! I thought it looked pretty good before I added the half and half( I also used fat free to lower the calories), but I still added it to get that creaminess! I also had no sherry so I read that I could substitute it with apple/grape juice. Since I had that on hand I used that instead. Also I had no curry so I did with out, I will have to remember to get some for next time and try it out! So far it is Delicious! and I still have 2 more hrs for it to cook.

Modified for son with gluten and dairy allergies, used almond milk and corn starch.  Didn't have celery, almonds or dry sherry.  Used up turkey broth from Thanksgiving and added leftover ham instead of chicken.  Great way to use leftovers.  Will definitely make again.

Maybe the best soup I've ever made. I had to make a few changes to the recipe, no carrots so I used a potato, hot Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard and no sherry or almonds. I used an "old world pilaf" (mixture of rices and dried beans)  I found in the bulk food section at the grocery store instead of wild rice. The addition of curry is awesome in the soup.

way yummy!  I didn't have any celery so i used a yellow bell pepper.  Also used brown rice instead of wild rice and whole milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 (its what I had on hand).  It made a ton!  I used double the veggies.  I always buy in bulk so it is always a challenge to use up all the produce before it goes bad.  This is a great recipe to use up those veggies!

I am going to have to agree with everyone else...this soup was amazing. The only changes I made was I left out the mushrooms because we are not really a shroom family. I went a little bit light on the curry and mustard poweder, but next time I will put in the full amount as the flavor was a tad on the bland side. I will be making this soup a lot this winter!

I really enjoyed it. I used extra curry powder and brown rice. It turned out perfect. It was really easy to make since I used left over rice and chicken. I will definitely be making this again.

So Very, very good! I made the soup late Thursday night, without the cream, and it sat in the fridge all day Friday and Saturday.  Here it is Saturday night, I froze (without cream) 3/4 of the batch, and added some cream to the remainder.  It is wonderful.  I wonder about the almonds, the crunch...I'm not sure about them.  It's different, but oh so tasty!  I remember the sherry being a touch strong on Thursday night, but here on Saturday, and with the cream added...oh ya baby!  We're talking deliciousness!

This is a very good soup.  It's very thick and hearty so if you're looking for a light broth, this is not for you.  The only change I made was to omit the almonds.  The only suggestion I would make is to reduce (probably by half) the amount of sherry in the recipe.  I added the required amount and could really taste it; so much so that it was distracting.

I was surprised at the spiciness of the soup.  I have always lived in MN and tasted many wild rice soups before and never had a soup with spice like this.  It was surprising, but ended up being pleasantly surprising.  I may have gone a little overboard with the seasonings though...

This is an excellent soup, especially on a cold winter day. I took some hints from some of the other reviewers and used 8 cups of chicken broth. I used very low sodium and ended up needing to add more salt to taste. I also used more curry powder and pepper, as well a tablespoon more sherry. I think the curry and the sherry add to the wonderful taste and aroma of this great recipe.

This was a really easy soup recipe that I'll definitely make again with just a few tweaks.  I will add some more chicken broth (maybe 1 extra cup) to thin out the broth - it was a little TOO creamy for my tastes (and I like a thick, hearty soup).  Also, the roux is prone to scorching, and needed frequent stirring.  Make sure you use a heavy bottom no stick soup pot to help decrease that.  I like the curry and the sherry, the flavoring was different than anything I would have whipped up on my own.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!!  I just made it for the first time.  The only alterations I made were omitting the dry sherry for extra chicken broth and I added a pound of extra crispy bacon (cut into small pieces) as a final step.  YUM!!

My Life Skills class (Middle School), periodically makes a soup for staff to buy for lunch.  Last week we made this one, served 22 bowls of it, and it was a HUGE hit!  Thanks so much for a real winner, that I know will be requested over and over!

Good recipe. I made this for Halloween night. I made enough for 12 servings and doubled the onions, and added 3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic.  I also added a pinch of tarragon.  Some family members don't like celery, so I omitted it and doubled the carrots.  I added all the ingredients except the 1/2 and 1/2, simmered for about 20 minutes, cooled it and refrigerated it overnight.  I undercooked the wild rice about 10 minutes.  The following day it was thick, like a stew.  I warmed it up and then added the 1/2 and 1/2.  Everybody raved about it!  My husband is not fond of curry, so I did not add any additional, but it would also taste good with another 1/2 tsp or so of curry.

This was very good, even my 3 and 6yr old liked it. I cooked it in a slow cooker and the only thing I changed was adding the mushrooms in later so they wouldn't get too mushy.

This recipe is fantastic!! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts - I like them better for soup, otherwise, I made the recipe as is. For my taste, I would have liked a bit more salt but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing! Even my kids (1 and 3) loved it. My 3 year old, who loves to help pop the stems out of mushrooms but never wants to eat them said to me "I guess I do like mushrooms after all mama." The flavor is pretty sophisticated, so I was surprised at how much the kids enjoyed it. If at all possible, DO add the wine -I know I often omit wine if I don't have any in the house, but the smell/flavor went from wonderful to extraordinary after I added a bit of Shiraz. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe - I can only image how much more we'll enjoy it in the winter.

Oh my goodness!  This recipe is better than anything I have tasted, even from restaurants!  First of all, I will list my dissentions:

I used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store.  This provided a better taste and variety of meat.  It was way better than just using breasts.  I also left out the sherry because (a) I don't know what it is and (b) I obviously didn't have any.  

My wife and I *LOVED* this recipe and will definitely be using again and again.

this is a great recipe.  i want to note that it can be very healthy too. i substituted brown rice, skim milk, and low calorie butter and my dad and boyfriend LOVED it.  the only complaint was from mom who sd it was too thick to be a soup but you can just add more broth if you want it to be more liquidy.  (she copied the recipe before i left though)

This soup is excellent. I also add 3-4 strips of cooked bacon that I have chopped and 2 cloves of garlic. When I cook the chicken, I season it with a creole or a southwestern seasoning to give the soup a little added kick.

Consistent with other reviews I was somewhat skeptical about the introduction of curry in this soup. But, I made it nevertheless, and had to say it was outstanding. I made it true to the recipe. My 4 and 5 year olds asked if they could have it for breakfast!

Overall I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with my leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  The curry gives it a nice flavor.  The only thing I would change is to maybe leave out the almonds next time.  I think they're a little too crunchy - but perhaps I didn't cook my soup long enough.

Just made this for the first time - and I LOVE it!!  We're serving it in our restaurant, and it seems to be a hit!  Thanks for all the great reviews, I never would have thought to use curry or mustard powder - and I probably would have skipped this recipe if it didn't have all of the great reviews.  All I changed was adding a extra salt, but that's it.  This is a keeper!

We all really liked this - and that says something because my son does not like cooked mushrooms!  I did add more vegies, used left-over roast chicken, used extra chicken stock and less milk (2*) as others have suggested.  Initially I thought the curry powder a little unusual so only used half of what was called for, but next time I make this I will add what the recipe calls for.  Also, remembering a mushroom soup I made years ago, I added a little extra sherry - to me, it just adds that "special" something.  This is a keeper - I probably will keep experimenting, but thanks for a wonderful starting point! (We're having the leftovers tonight; has anyone tried freezing this?  How does it fare?)

The taste is incredible. The only problem is that it comes out way too thick. Heeding the warnings, I added extra chicken broth and used skim milk. Still came out like a stick-to-your-rib stew/chowder. Next time, i'll reduce both the amount of flour and rice to make it slightly thinner. Other changes: sherry -> beer , wild rice -> long grain.

I made this for the first time for company and it was a big hit. I got rave reviews and will definately make again. I only used half of the half and half it called for. Otherwise, a simple and wonderful recipe.

This was really good (after I spiced it up a little).  I am from Louisiana, so it was a little bland for me.  I added garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and white pepper to give it a little kick.  Also, I did not have any almonds, so I left them out.  I could not find straight-up wild rice, so I used  uncle Ben's pre-cooked long grain and wild rice. Anyways, it turned out really good except it was a little too thick. I may decrease the flout a bit next time.  Great recipe.  Thanks so much!

This was a fantastic recipe!  Very hearty for a frosty winters night!  The soup was very deep and I had enough left over to freeze for later! I used 5 drumsticks instead of breasts, per my family’s request.  I also added a bit of garlic salt, at the end, for a robust bite.  I am very happy to have found this great chicken soup recipe, thank you very much!!

Made this soup on a cold winter day and my husband and I loved it!  We're not very big soup eaters, but it is so thick and hearty that we had it for lunch everyday until it was gone.  I mis-read the recipe and used long grain & wild rice, but it turned out so good I'd probably do the same again.  Also used milk instead of half/half, which didn't seem to affect it.  I will definitely make again!

I have tried several of the chicken wild rice soups on this site and this is by far the very best! I followed the recipe exactly except I used homemade broth. Everyone loved it.

Very flavorful.  The whole family enjoyed it.  It will become a standard in our family.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I did make the following changes to match our preferences:  sauted onions in 2 T. butter; doubled celery and carrots; simmered veges, chicken, spices and sherry in broth (did not use flour or make a roux) 30-40 minutes.  Used 6 oz. package of long-grain and wild rice mix prepared according to package directions.  Used 1/2 c. almonds which I "toasted" in 1 T. butter.  Added rice, almonds and half-and-half and heated through.

Made this soup for my customers today.  I left out the almonds and added more broth.  (it was getting too thick without the extra broth)  It was perfect.  One customer said, "oh wow, this is good."  Thank you.

The soup was really good, we were pleasantly surprised by the combination of spices and almonds. I used about 3 cups of white and wild rice and it was very thick. I had to use prepared spicy mustard instead of powder. Very filling and great aroma. We will definately use this recipe again.

I always come back to this recipe for chicken and wild rice soup. It's hearty and well flavored. I've viewed other recipes on this site only to find that the people who highly rated other recipes modified it so it ended up pretty much being this recipe. Just use this one and you've got all you need. Great in bread bowls.

Sue, thank you for this recipe.  I have used it MANY times and have been asked for the recipe over and over.  I have made it in large quantities (80 servings) or small.  It freezes beautifully.  Thanks to AllRecipes for the serving calculations--I use them lots.

I'm just learning to cook, but this recipe makes me look like an accomplished chef.  Every time I make Sue's soup I have to print the recipe again.  Each time I have fixed it, my guest's ask for the recipe.  This recipe has half of San Antonio talking about my native Minnesota.

very good, but too much rice.  I kept having to add more broth so it would be soup-otherwise it's a rice dish.  Next time I will cut the rice by half.  Otherwise it's a very delish soup ricipe

Substantial, flavorful soup! I was afraid of the curry & mustard, but they added great flavor! I omitted the mushrooms, & used half white rice & half wild rice. Short on time, my children, husband, & I ate it after it simmered less than a half hour, & it was great! It'll be good to serve to guests.

Soooo Good!!  My husband couldn't stop eating!  I sub'd chicken with ground turkey and made meatballs.  Didn't realize how long it takes to cook wild rice so couldn't cook it as long as recommended after added the rice, but still it was very delicious!!

This was a pretty good soup.  I put way to much rice in it so that kind of messed things up...turned out more like a stew.  Very flavorful though!!

First of all, my apologies to Sue for somewhat butchering this recipe :)  I followed it to the letter with the following exceptions:  I omitted the fresh mushrooms and added a family sized can of fat free cream of mushroom soup with the chicken broth.  I also used substituted prepared mustard because I didn't have dry (and it worked) and used fat free milk to thin the mixture to "soup" consistency.  It is wonderful.  I gave some to my babysitter last night and she asked me for the recipe this morning!  Thanks, Sue for giving me something to "build on".  It's a wonderful soup!

This is an awesome soup(chowder-like) recipe. I think I will use fat-free half/half next time, and cut the butter in half, but I followed the directions exactly this time and it turned out FABULOUS!!  Perfect for a cold , snowy Wisconsin Saturday.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup is wonderful! I served it for my daughter's 4th birthday party, and it was a hit with the adults! It takes quite a while to simmer/cook, but it's very easy and quick to put together. The left-overs kept very well, and we ate the last bowl two days later. I recommend this soup to everyone!

This tastes like something you'd get in a high-end restaurant.  Everyone I've served it to has been so impressed!  I took the leftovers to work and everyone had to have the recipe.

I was looking for a recipe that my 14 year old son would eat.  He absolutely loved this soup; although I did omit some of the spices and the mushrooms for his taste.  I wasn't looking for a quick recipe, so the time it took to make wasn't a factor. However, it didn't really take that long and it was very easy to follow.  I also wanted a recipe made entirely from fresh ingredients.  I will definetly make this recipe for dinner guests!

I thought the recipe was OKAY....but no big deal....a little boring but good at the same time... I added fresh rosemary w/the roux and a little Essence which helped.  I used a LOT of milk and it was still pretty thick...more like a chicken and rice entree than a soup.....

Our family loved it!  Maybe because we added 6 tablespoons of sherry (instead of 3)!!!

This soup takes some work, but it is sooo darn good.  I'm addicted!  I've made two pots so far and my boyfriend and I just eat it up! Great for chilly nights. Thanks!
