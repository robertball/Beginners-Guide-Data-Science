I made this with a snowshoe hare... it  wasn't bad... it was certainly edible... but there was nothing SPECIAL about it. in fact, I think it was on a par with rabbit that's just slow-roasted with no spicing preparation. I found it rather bland. Don't think I'll make it again.

Pleasant.  I like rabbit and have some very good recipes, but I didn't feel that this was worth a place.
