This was very good.  I only had cream of chicken soup (without herbs) so I added thyme, basil, oregano, parsley, black pepper, onion and garlic powders.  Very easy to make and sauce tastes great on rice (would be good over mashed potatoes or noodles also).  I let the chicken simmer for 15 minutes instead of 5 and was done just right.

This was so incredibly easy and delicious. Some small changes I made: used EVVO instead of veggie oil. I also made short grain rice in a rice pot. This was the perfect meal to a cold, wintry day. It easily fed my family of 6 and was very economical.

This is definitely not the most fantastic meal you will ever eat.... but if you need something to eat in a real short time, this is a pretty good choice. It's super easy to prepare and the flavor was solid.  I butterflied a few chicken breasts and seasoned them with Salt Pepper and Garlic, and then I followed the recipe exactly after that. It really is as easy to make as the recipe sounds... from start to finish it took 15 minutes at the most.  If you need something quick, tasty, and family friendly, this is a good meal for you. Cheers!

I browned the chicken in the pan after sprinkling it with onion and garlic powder.  Like another reviewer noted, I'm not sure this made much of a difference.  Because I worried about the chicken being cooked thoroughly, I cut it into smaller pieces and cooked it some more.  I would suggest pounding the meat prior to browning to make sure they're all the same thickness.  This recipe was easy to make and a hit.  I will definitely make it again and perhaps throw some frozen vegetables into the chicken/soup/milk mix and let it cook on the stove a bit longer. The rice was excellent - I'll use that part of the recipe again and again.

Sorry I save 5 stars for the very best but that being said, this is very fast and quite tasty. I recommend seasoning the chicken how you like (basil, oregano and the like). The 8 year old ate it quickly which is always a good sign.

I have to give this 5 stars since it takes no time to prepare and is quite yummy. The recipe doesn't call for any spices and I was afraid the chicken would be bland, so sprinkled pepper and garlic powder on the chicken before I browned it. I don't know if it improved the taste any. My husband has requested I make this recipe at least twice a month.

All I have to say is DELICIOUS!!!  Takes MINUTES to cook, and my 8 year old LOOOVED it, and it is very very hard to please her!!!  My grocery store didn't have the cream of chicken soup with herbs, so I added my own like another person on here did...I added:  thyme, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and parsley, and I made corn and potatoes and poured the gravy ontop!!  Thanks!!!

Not gourmet or anything, but easy, quick and tasty. My husband used to make this for me when we first got married. (He used the oven, but same concept) Now I'm doing all the cooking...what happened??

This was delicious! My kids ate it all! 2 thumbs up! 5 stars!  Preparation was very quick, and the food was tasty. I added my own spices to plain cream of chicken soup. My kids cleaned their plates and that is saying a lot!

My husband's favorite sauce.  I added caramelized dice onions and used cream of mushroom soup.  I think any condensed soup would work.  This would make a great "gravy" on mashed potatoes.

This was the easiest, fastest and tastiest meal I have made!  It is perfect when you have next to no time to cook!  I wish Campbell's made the Herb soup with less sodium, but other than that this is a keeper!

Yummy and super easy - will definitely be a go-to recipe when I'm short on time and want a salty, creamy sauce for my chicken.  My store didn't have the cream with herbs, so I added some garlic and onion powder to the sauce and chicken and it tasted great.

Really good recipe. When my mom went shopping she accidentally got cream of mushroom instead but it still wored wonderfully. I like my rice sticky and following this recipe it turned out a bit wet for my tastes but it was still really good. Just add less water next time.

Absolutely delicious and fast to prepare. Seasoned chicken first with basil, oregano, thyme, parsley, rosemary, garlic powder, and pepper and cut into chunks to cook faster. Used regular white rice instead and turned out fine. Only complaint is that everything is very thick, may use chicken boullion next time instead to lighten it up a bit. Other than that I can't ask for a better comfort food.

Have made this twice since I found the recipe.  I do cut up the chicken and cook longer than suggested to make sure it is cooked thoroughly, as others suggested.  I do sprinkle the chicken with Tony Chachere's - everything is better with Tony's!  I also just use whichever soup I have on hand - just about anything would work.

Fast, easy, and tasty. It looks like it took a lot more effort if you take time to plate nicely.  My picky palate-challenged boyfriend did not complain so it must have been good.

4 stars only because I made some changes. I thought the original sounded a little bland so I browned the chicken in olive oil and garlic, and then added basil, parsley, black pepper, and onion powder to the soup mix. Served over mashed potatoes and it was amazing!! Everyone loved it.

This recipe inspired me with a few tweaks of my own. Like others, only had crm of chicken, so added my own herbs (1/2 tsp of tarragon, 1tsp parsley, 1/4 tsp marjarom,1/2 tsp garlic powder), substituted 1/3 cup white wine for milk. Used EVOO. Turned out great and in about 20 minutes (used long grain rice).

Family did well with this! 

Typically they dont like casserole type of dinners.

Used Potato Soup and lots of herbs - cooked chicken in Garlic and oil for more flavor.

I would make it more healthy by using low sodium broth and soup and adding salt at the table.

Made it yesterday for lunch as written except substituted chicken broth for milk b/c I was out of milk.  It was quick and easy and pretty good except a little salty (prob from soup + broth).  I took the leftover chicken, chopped it up, combined it with the rest of the rice and added  about 1/4 of feta cheese and 2c steamed broccoli then topped it with a few breadcrumbs and butter.  Baked it for 20 min and it was a nice change-up for dinner.

I actually cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces before I cooked it to make it more of a chicken and rice dish.

It was deeeeelicious!  I'm currently expecting and was asked by my doctor to lessen my sodium intake and am so glad I came across this recipe!  I cubed the chicken breast and made my rice without the chicken broth and it was fabulous!  Very happy I tried this...

I have made this dish several times, and making it again tonight! My dad who loves chicken and rice swears that this is the best chicken dish he has ever had. He arrived at my house today for a long visit and this is on our menu. The first time I tried this I used regular cream of chicken soup with the additional herbs, but trust me when I say that the Cream of Chicken soup with herbs makes this dish! Whenever I see it at the store and it is on sale, I stock up just for this dish alone! Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Great easy recipe!!! I thought it might be a little plain but I was wrong. We ate it with rice and a frozen veg. My husband asked to have it again the next week. Good thing I had extra ingredients to do it again. I tried the broth simmered rice. It was ok. Regulare rice was great also. Thanks for the recipe. I'm sure I will be making it again.

This recipe is good, but would be better without so much herbs. So I will just use regular cream of chicken soup.

Easy and delicious for time put in. I added steamed broccoli and bacon bits to mine to liven it up a little. Also used some Cajun seasoning for a little heat.

This recipe was actually very good! As another user noted, I only had regular cream of chicken, so I liberally added basil, oregano, parsley and a little pepper.  I had to stop myself from adding wine or garlic and I am glad I did! It turned out great.  Easy, fast and my kids actually ate it without complaining.

I cut up the chicken, pepper and flour it before putting it in the oil for a pre-fry type deal. I love this, my boyfriend is saying I need to revamp but now I remember I haven't broth simmered the rice since the first time, re-reading the recipe reminded me. Maybe that will add the extra flavor back in this dish.

Very simple prep and tantalizing aroma while cooking! Added spinach and sliced tomatoes to sides and used brown rice and plain cream of chicken soup with my own mixed Italian spices stirred in. My chicken breasts were unusually large, so I think I will cut them into strips next time.

This was pretty tasty! I did season the chicken with salt, pepper and onion powder before browning. I also cooked some onions along with the chicken which added to the sauce.

Very easy to make and , it was delicious!! 
Def on my fav list. I pre seasoned chicken and used cream of mushroom instead, it was still good.
