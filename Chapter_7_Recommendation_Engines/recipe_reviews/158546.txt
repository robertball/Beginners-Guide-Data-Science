This was just ok for me.  It was hard to follow the directions since my 4 potatoes could not be layered in a single layer in the bottom of even the largest pan I have.  I also thought there was too much herbs for the amount of potatoes.  Mine were covered and you could barely taste the potato.  I would use less spices next time.

These potatoes turned out really well, I did cut back on the fresh herbs and used a little white pepper.

I left the skin on my potato, and just used one large one (i didn't want more than one layer of potatoes in the bottom).  My husband loved these.

These were so yummy, but I made them with only thyme and garlic, and a little red pepper sprinkled on top. The list of ingredients seems like herb overkill. I also used unpeeled red potatoes, which I think are way better, plus the skin is good for you. It's unnecessary to "lay the slices across the bottom of the skillet in a single layer," that takes forever and you'll probably need multiple skillets if you're cooking for a bunch of people. Just dump a reasonable amount of slices in, spread them out as much as possible, stir and make sure they're all coated with the melted butter/oil, maybe add a small dollop of butter to the top and then simply cover the skillet. Turn them every once in a while til they're done, works for me every time.

This recipe is fantastic! I absolutely loved it. Wish I would have cooked up some more! :) The only thing I didn't follow was peeling the potatoes. They were so thinly sliced though, I don't think it made a difference whatsoever! I will definitely be making this recipe again and again...and soon!

Excellent. So difficult to find a quick yet elegant potato recipe! Slice very thin and use a 12" heavy bottomed nonstick skillet. I loved the fresh herbs but have subbed a proportionate amt of dried as well. I've even used peeled russets that were a little old and rubbery - couldn't tell! Mine usually take (3) turns of 5 min ea. Thank you!!!

Very tasty, but there's no way to get 4 thinly sliced potatos in a single layer in one pan.  We ended up frying in batches in a 12" cast iron skillet then returning all to the pan with a little oil, the seasonings (using 1t dried thyme and parsley, and 1/4t dried rosemary and oregano), and the garlic.  Really liked the flavor.

The resulting dish was a mixture of burnt and raw slices of potato, most of which were over-seasoned.

Good, but didn't impart as much flavor as I expected. Also, the potatoes took a very long time to cook.

I was looking for a really great potatoe recipe and decided to try this one.  These potatoes were okay, but this receipe is not *the one*.  They were pretty tasty but somehow they tasted like a million other potatoes dishes I have eaten before.  Just not very unique.

I was not pleased with this recipe. I followed it verbatim and my potatoes looked burnt and were not cooked all the way through. I didn't like that it had you sprinkle all of the spices on one side. They stuck to the potato and once flipped they just burned. I will not be cooking this recipe again. I also don't know what size skillet the person who made this recipe used but I bought four potatoes as it calls for and only used 2.5 because that many slices wouldn't fit in a normal size skillet.

I made it with the boys and we added a few sprinkles for extra taste and colour.  The sprinkles mixed with the organic spices made the potatoes to die for.  Would recommend adding sprinkles to anyone who wants a little colour in their life!

The first time I made this as written. The herbs were a little to over powering.  I have made this several times since. I cut the herbs in half, dumped my potatoes in a large 12 in. skillet along with a couple of table spoons of olive oil and stirred to coat the potatoes. Mix all spices (just half of the amounts) in a small bowl and sprinkled them over the potatoes,  stirred them again to coat all potatoes. Added garlic about way thru. I do double the garlic just because we do love garlic.  It gave me a choice of making it my own. 
Thanks for this recipe!!

Made these as a side dish to a skillet pork chop/gravy recipe and it was all delish.  Made no changes to the recipe other than using small white potatoes as that's all I had on hand, and used garlic powder instead of crushed garlic. Sliced potatoes about 1/4 inch thick (left skins on).  They came out beautifully browned and tender.  Will make again!

Started review and hit done before I was finished so I have two out there.Rated 4 stars as is because I feel u can leave skins on- less work and more nutrition with on. Because I mixed the spices and butter and olive oil and tossed potatoes right from the beginning feel the potatoes absorbed more of the spices. Used baby reds and halved or quartered- less work. This is a great base recipe and with the few modifications made it a five. We will make again for sure. Thanks for recipe.

Pretty good! I needed a griddle I think...I didn't get 3 potatoes worth into my skillet. And I liked the ones I cut thinner, but if I kept doing that I would have run out of room even faster. I kept the cayenne very light, added a bit more butter (probably more than I should have!), and used garlic powder. But they turned out good. I don't make potatoes a lot, but I'll try this again sometime,

I loved this! I made it as is the first time, but for the second, I added some chopped Conecuh sausage and a large pinch of cayenne pepper. It turned out fantastic. This is one of my new favorite recipes.

I loved the flavor combination and cooking technique. I used three small to medium white potatoes (my favs for everything but baking and French fries)  which was enough to fill one 12 inch sauté pan 1 and 1/2 times. If you used idahos or another baking russet you would have way too much potato. All three potatoes were about the equivalent of 1 large Idaho russet.   There are smaller russets on the market (think Prince Edward Island russets and some others). They would have  about the size of my medium white potatoes.  So perhaps that is what the author of the recipe had in mind .  In any event I did in two batches up till adding the garlic.  I combined both batches at the end and combined them and added the garlic.   Oh yeah, the skins are light enough on the eastern white  you don't need to peel first .  I would peel the tuffer skinned russet.

My family really enjoyed them, NO leftovers! I did not have paprika but they were still delicious.
