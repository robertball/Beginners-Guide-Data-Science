Made these with white chocolate instead of semi-sweet for dipping.  They were delicious - everyone asked for the recipe.  This recipe wil be used ver and over again in my family!

I make these every year and I need to keep making a large batch every year. This recipe is time consuming but simple. 

Notes I'd like to add: 
1. Crush oreos, then put into a food processor. Add the cream cheese but make sure it's softed to a spreadable state. The quickest way to do this is by throwing it in a microwave in a bowl. Mix until the mixture is nice and black. 
2. Chill this mix in the fridge or the freezer. If planning on working on these in the same day, the freezer works. 
3. Ball up the mix. This stuff will be warm so put it in the freezer. 
4. Coat with chocolate. Don't use almond bark or imitation, people can tell the difference. Dark chocolate is rich; milk chocolate will taste like a hot cocoa ball; white chocolate has a great contrast. Most people who don't care for white chocolate like this one the best. 
5. For dipping chocolate: warm up water to 180 degrees. If you have an electric tea kettle it works pretty well. I don't have a double boiler so I find a large pot and fill it with 2" of water. Then, I have a metal mixing bowl to put the chocolate in. I don't take out all the balls from the freezer; instead, take out about 20 at a time. They'll keep form better when dipping. I use a teaspoon to toss chocolate on then place onto parachment paper.

The cookie-cream cheese mixture is yummy but the dipping into chocolate part is difficult. I made a few dipped in chocolate and then the chocolate got too hot and thick and wouldn't melt correctly. The few that I was able to dip were Way too chocolaty I couldnt even taste the oreos. I decided to roll the rest in powdered sugar and that was so much easier and tasted much better!!!!Also the recipe only made about 28 one inch balls, so you may want to double it

I thoroughly crushed the package of regular Oreos by placing them in a large ziplock bag and using the heel of my hand. I then hand-stirred the cream cheese and Oreos until evenly mixed. I used a tablespoon to scoop out the globs of Oreo and placed them on a wax paper-covered baking sheet. After placing them in the fridge for 30 min (or freezer for less), I hand rolled them into a nice round ball. Also, using a double boiler is fantastic for melting chocolate. I added a small handful of chocolate chips at a time and stirred occasionally until it was all melted over low heat. I let the chocolate cool some, and then put a couple of Oreo balls in at a time and rolled them around in the chocolate bowl with my fingers for even coverage. Chilled them again in fridge for a few hours and they came out perfectly.

Very versatile! Swapped out Nutter Butter cookies for the Oreos, and dipped in melted peanut butter chips. Crushed gingersnaps, mixed with cream cheese, and coated with white chocolate sprinkled with cinnamon

Love this recipe!!! I found that placing the balls in the freezer for about 20 minutes makes it much easier to dip this in the chocolate. This was a big hit with my family!

I made the cream cheese/cookie balls and stuck them in the fridge overnight on waxed paper.  They were hard enough to dunk in the chocolate and came off the waxed paper easily.  I then put them back on the waxed paper and back into the fridge.

AMAZING!!!

Excellent - made dough entirely in food processor.   I too used white chocolate to coat, and sprinkled with jimmies so they were pretty as well.  I followed a suggestion to use a tooth pick to dip, and had to re-heat chocolate a few seconds half way through so it didn't get too thick.  Very easy - So fudgey and yummy!!

I consider myself a pretty good baker. I rarely have difficulty with a recipe. But let me tell you - these were hard to make. Definitely tested my patience. I tried what some reviewers had said and froze the dough for a little while before rolling it. Even after that the dough was hard to roll out.

These cookies are really easy to make and popular. Instead of using semi-sweet chips, try using Andes mint chocolates. They melt more quickly (and easily) and is SO MUCH easier to work with when dipping, plus it gives a mint taste to the cookies. I also color the white chocolate with food coloring to make different colors.

Absolutely fantastic and addictive! Don't make if you're looking to watch your figure! To save on calories and fat, you can make without cream cheese; cream filling from cookie is enough to hold the ball together. Makes it more cake-like. Dipping in chocolate is messy. I recommend small bowl and small slotted spoon. Roll ball in chocolate with tip of spoon, scoop up ball with small slotted spoon, shimmy back and forth to get extra chocolate off,and roll off spoon onto parchment paper. First batch was messy, but 2nd was better once I got a rhythm going. Well worth a little mess....Good Luck!

It tastes delicious. I modified, by adding a half a hand full of white sugar and a dash of vanilla into the cream cheese and oreo mixture. Then once I rolled the balls, I added toothpicks before putting into the freezer to help dip.
Idea for Halloween, use the Halloween Oreos on the base, use white chocolate for dipping and its a ghost!
Bon Appétit!

These were the hit of my little one's 3rd birthday party!   
*First, since several attendees were gluten-free, I made this with Gluten Free sandwich cookies (Kinnikinnick K-Toos chocolate cookies - 2 packages of these equals 36 cookies exactly.  I didn't cover with crushed cookie crumbs.).  It worked beautifully - no issues. 
*Second, I followed other reviewers' advice and froze the balls before dipping (actually, they sat in the freezer overnight).  
*Third, after freezing, I inserted lollipop sticks and these made dipping in chocolate a breeze.   I did spoon chocolate over the tops and merely dipped the bottoms to cover the entire cookie ball.  This also made eating a little easier for little ones - less chocolate mess on the hands.  :-)   (We're in the middle of a typical, brutal Texas summer.  These melt fast, so I served them straight from the 'fridge and the lolly sticks kept some of the mess in check.)

I can't wait to make these again...and try different variations.  :-)

I followed this recipe exactly as given. Making the oreo/cream mixture is easy enough, but dipping in the chocolate is not easy task - Messy. Although they do look pretty when done - I used white chocolate and sprinkled with oreo crumbs. For me the cost of cream cheese and oreos, and mess is not worth what it produced.

Made these with my grandchildren and had a lots of fun...and lots of mess, but was sooo tasty we didn't care about the clean-up. Of course, most of the cookie balls didn't make it to the dip in chocolate stage as we had fun eating them as we went along. Better have lots of ice cold milk on hand.

This is so easy,my daughter 15,makes them! The dipping can be tough. I like the candy melts from walmart for 'making candy'  They can be microwaved over and over,and it gives the cookies a shell. I also use the food processor for the mixing,makes this recipe a snap! P. S. They are suppose to be sweet,lol! You are rolling Oreos in Chocolate! :)  So fill a glass of cold milk and yum!

i made this recipe with my friend to race money for the American Cancer Society. Everybody loved them and the fundraiser was a huge success, with over 100 orders. I will say that the dipping took a while when you have to make 200 plus cookie balls, but otherwise this was a great recipe.

Love. Especially since this recipe doesn't involve anything that I wouldn't normally have. Just a warning. Using the Oreos with red frosting will stain your hands.

I made these cookie balls yesterday for a 4th of July party and they were delicious. I used the semi-sweet chocolate, not white chocolate, and sprinkled a few red,white, and blue sprinkles on each. I left my balls in the freezer for at least an hour so they were good and hard and could be easily dipped in the melted chocolate. The recipe as it is does not make anywhere near 48 balls though. I was lucky I got 30 small balls out of my batch. Just a few comments about the negative reviews: yes its a little messy covering the balls in chocolate and mine did not come out looking like smooth little candy balls, but the party I was going to wasn't fancy and no one cared what they looked like; you have to work fast with the melted chocolate because it does tend to thicken up quickly; I do agree with some of the reviews that they are a little expensive to make but man are they yummy.

Have been making these for years and always a hit!!! I usually dip in white chocolate with a milk chocolate drizzle. Sometimes use peanut butter Oreos dipped in milk chocolate with a peanut drizzle. Place them in mini cupcake papers for a nice presentation...easy & delicious!!!

Made these for a bridal shower and they were a huge hit! I am surprised at how many reviewers are saying these are difficult to make.  I thought they were one of the easiest desserts I have ever made in my life.  Also, one of the tastiest.  To make the process easier, I do agree with the suggestion to use a food processor to crush the Oreos and mix them with the cream cheese.  I used tooth picks to dip them in the chocolate.  Once the chocolate started to run low I just plopped the balls in the bowl and then spooned the chocolate over the top to coat the entire ball.  I agree that they are very rich, but I don't consider that to be a negative thing.

Messy to make, but worth it.  Very rich, so be careful not to make the balls too big.

Love these! Three simple ingredients and simple to make. Plus I crush the Oreos in my food processor which is always fun. They are super delicious, my husband can't get enough of them. In fact because of him I have to make my 3rd batch of these.

Taste was great...they were a big hit but coating them in the melted chocolate was nearly impossible!! It was an extremely messy process...I tried spoons, toothpicks...nothing worked!  Don't know if I will attempt this again.

These Oreo balls are a delicious and addictive treat. I love this recipe so much! One change I made was that I put the Oreo cookies through a food processor rather than just breaking them up of crushing them with something. Also, after I rolled the balls and placed them in the freezer, I left them in for 20 minutes rather than 10. I also used white chocolate instead of semi-sweet and it was amazing!

I love this recipe, and it works for my family. But instead of chocolate chips, I highly recommend almond bark of any brand it makes it moe about the oreo even with that little bit of chocolatey taste.

I love sweet things but this is WAY to sweet to swallow. I made the balls and froze them for 20 minutes.  Then took a little white chocolate and dipped a cake pop stick.  Put the stick in the ball then into the chocolate.  Sounds easy...no.  The GRE was easier than this recipe.  A pain and quite an expensive recipe for the results.  A lot of oddly shaped, way too sweet cookies is what I ended up with.  I'm glad I did a trial run today.  They wont be making it to the Christmas dinner table.

Try using cooking wax. Boil water and have another pot on top with the wax and chocolate. Then dip. It works so much better.

Another good ball is Reese Balls with powered sugar, peanut butter, sugar and butter. So good!

My kids love these, even now that they're adults!  The advice I've read in reviews has been very helpful. I don't have a food processor or double boiler, but I made do. Definitely soften the cream cheese well. Crush the cookies well. I started crushing by hand in a Ziploc bag, then put them and the cream cheese in a large bowl and mixed with a hand mixer. Only slightly messy. Form into small balls, insert a toothpick in each, and freeze for an hour. I put a metal bowl over some very hot water on the stove to melt the chocolate, and this kept the chocolate very workable for dipping the balls to coat. cool on parchment or waxed paper, remove the toothpicks and you are good to go!

Ok, so these taste amazing - what's there not to like, right?  However, unless you are a baker extraordinaire you may find yourself thinking somewhere along the way (as I did)...."how on earth can a recipe with only three ingredients be this much trouble??!!" Seriously. And the time estimate of 1.75 hours is a joke. It took twice that easily but really longer considering the time needed to chill. And they looked rather unsightly. Fortunately, just about any dessert tastes great regardless of appearance but was hoping to present something pleasing to the eye since I was whipping them up for a cookie swap. Um, not exactly - they were funny little misshapen globs with clumps of white chocolate and holes and oh my. Not pretty. So yes, they are wonderful and I can see the potential but don't think you are embarking upon a simple baking venture!!  Good luck!

Giving this a four out of five because while they are super delicious & fun to make, the process of dipping them in the melted chocolate was  difficult. I would suggest if you're a novice like me to buy those Baker's dipping chocolate cups instead. They're little microwaveable bowls of chocolate wafers & they are so much harder to screw up than melting chips on the stove!! Delicious recipe, but really disappointingly challenging to pull off without them looking a mess. Guess this is a recipe that takes practice to master.

I used my food processor which made it really easy! I also used the smallest cookie scoop I could find which kept my hands clean and kept the size small enough to pop them in your mouth without getting overwhelmed by the richness. I put them in the fridge for 30 mins while I heated my chocolate coating (note the chocolate coating not chocolate chips) in my candy melts pot that keeps it at a good temp. Before dipping a rolled them in my hands to give a better shape. After dipping I used festive sprinkles! I tried different combinations too and loved them all. Mint oreos with dark coating, regular with white, mint with white... you name it! All in all they were a hit with family and friends, but I made sure I kept them small!

I have made these for Christmas dipped in white chocolate and sprinkled with red and green sugar.   I also make them into football shaped and dipped in milk chocolate for Super Bowl.   Piped white chocolate or royal icing for the laces.

These got mixed reviews but I personally liked them. I had never melted baking chocolate prior to this recipe and I frustrated myself during the first failed (slightly embarrassing) attempt. I used the water bath technique the second time around. It worked wonderfully. I used toothpicks for dipping which also made things easier. I'd recommend this recipe.

This recipe is sooo yummy! To crush my Oreo's, I used my blender and then mixed the fine cookie crumbs with the cream cheese using a hand mixer. The second time I made these I used the Berry Burst Ice Cream Oreo's and covered them in vanilla almond bark. These tasted just like chocolate raspberry truffles! My family can't get enough of these!

These are sooooooo good!!!! For my Christmas cookie party, I added crushed candy canes inside, as well as sprinkling a few on top. I used a double broiler for the chocolate, used two forks for dipping, and put them on waxed paper when done. You have to freeze the mix for a good 15 minutes to make them easy to roll in your hands; just putting them in the fridge even for a half hour, doesn't cut it. I also added just a tad extra cream cheese for extra creaminess inside my cookie. They were a hit!

This is the easiest and most loved recipe at Christmas in our house.  I make these as gifts every year.  Make sure the filling  is very cold, frozen if possible. Then use a slotted spoon to cover in Chocolate. It is without a doubt a little messy to make....but well worth it. (I bought a small candy kit just for this recipe because we make these every year. The kit has a slotted spoon, sharp metal tools to help in dipping the cookie mixture.) There are so many flavor variations for this recipe. Don't be afraid to try different Oreo Cookie flavors. It is worth the work when the compliment s start coming in!!! Enjoy!!!

I make these for work and they vanish almost instantly with rave reviews from everyone. They’re super easy to make and once you get your rhythm down they’re fairly quick to make as well. Instead of a toothpick I just toss a ball into the chocolate and then use a fork to roll the ball around until it’s covered. This works especially well once you start running low on melted chocolate.

This is a simple recipe I made with my boyfriend, and we both loved it! Since we don't have a food processor we just put the Oreos in a large plastic ziplock bag and crushed them with a rolling pin. 

We added 1 teaspoon of chocolate sundae sauce to the cream cheese and oreo crumbs mixer to really get that chocolate taste all the way through, highly recommend doing that, otherwise, it just tastes like cream cheese! 

But overall great recipe, brought it to a family get together and was a huge hit with everyone! Would totally make again!

I've been making these for years and everybody loves them! I have also added Bailey's or Kahlua to the cream cheese mixture. Delicious! I've also used Nutter Butter cookies, instead of Oreos, for a "peanut butter cup" cheesecake ball! Yum!

These are a big hit with my family.  Put a little butter on your hands before rolling the Oreo mixture into balls.  This prevents sticking to your fingers and it is less messy.  I use Baker’s dipping chocolate and it is pretty easy and the chocolate stays consistent.

Defenitly very good I recommend making the balls pretty small because there very rich. So if you make them to big it’s even difficult to finish one.

These are a holiday favorite in our house. I like to use Andes mint chips instead of chocolate chips as they provide a thinner coating and a minty flavor over the ores balls....for extra mint flavor you can also use mint Oreos!

AR really needs to change how you type reviews -_-               I have made these many times and my boys love them, but I stumbled onto a variation that they love even more!      We used vanilla Oreos and the ghiradelli white discs for the coating & they’re absolutely delicious!!!

These are so easy and soooo delish.  I used my Ninja to mash up the oreos and cream cheese.  Then froze mixture for about 30 minutes to make it easier to roll into balls and dip.  Also used white chocolate as my dipping preference.  So yummy

After making and trying these, I’ve downrated the recipe to a 1 star. They are horrible tasting and if not taken right from the fridge to eat, become little lumps of mush. Will not make again.

I took the advice of other cooks and rather than use melted chocolate, used cocoa powder and icing sugar, then dipped them in a few Christmas sprinkles for colour and a festive look.

Big hit!  Will try to make balls a little smaller next time so it will maybe be easier to cover in the melted chocolate. Love only 3 ingredients!

These are a great, chocolate-rich treat. I highly recommend making these and then hoarding them all for yourself.

I love love love these cookie balls! They are just so good. The only thing I change with this recipe is I don't add the chocolate coating because I find it too sweet.

My 14 year old daughter made these for a Christmas party dessert and they were a hit!  She followed the recipe as is and we wouldn't change a thing.  She used Ghirardelli white chocolate baking chips as the coating and they were AWESOME!  We will definitely be making these again!!

It was very good, really rich.  All the other reviews are correct, dipping in the chocolate was not very easy.   We finally used a small fork and let the chocolate drip thru the tines and that seemed to work the best.  I would definitely make it again.

They are delicious, but not as pretty as the picture as the melted chocolate is hard to work with. Sometimes the balls fell apart even after freezing

These are always a hit. Try melting a little crisco with the choclate for added smoothness and you also can use white chocolate. This is my sons favorite- we freeze them so we can savor them a little at a time!

I can't believe how good these were. Too good. We made them as gifts, ate them all, made more, then decided to make some for Christmas Day. In all, I think we made 3 batches. So so so good! I think this year we'll probably make some for Thanksgiving as well!

We followed the advice of someone else and put the mixture in the freezer for a few minutes before making them. It's really a must. I was working with my kids, so it was going slowly, so I ended up taking a break halfway through to let the mixture cool in the freezer again for a few minutes.  I also used milk chocolate instead of dark.

Absolutley love these! I have made these a couple of times already and have not had an issue at all. Be sure to keep your chocolate in temper (If working with real chocolate) so you don't have to get the chocolate all over you when you are trying to eat it. It gives the chocolate a nice snap to it! Thanks for the recipe!

I expected so much more. The chocolate was too thick and I burned it because I was trying to get it thin enough so the cookie balls wouldn't crumble apart. I was kind of disappointed after all the work I went through. I felt like there should of been more of a kick.

Easy, quick, delicious! What more can you ask for? These are my go to for any type of event. They're always a hit. I've been experimenting with all of the other Oreo flavors since I discovered this recipe. Try the mint Oreos dipped in chocolate, yum!

Thought it was pretty tasty and extremely quick to make. I did it with the red velvet oreos but you can definitely get creative with this recipe, starting with different types of cookies.

Very tasty, Made these with green sprinkles just for looks. Btw you can also use semi sweet chocolate chips for dipping instead of semi sweet bakers chocolate and it tastes just fine.

I made these with 2 bars of Ghirardelli semi sweet baking chocolate, 1 bar of 70% dark baking chocolate and 1 bar of white chocolate to drizzle on top of the truffles.  Put the truffles in the fridge for 30 minutes and formed into perfect balls before rolling in the melted chocolate. The chocolate melted perfectly using the stove top method.  They were a little tricky and messy  to handle with two forks, but the end result was perfect, will try the took pick next time. Made 40 for an office party, will definitely be making again.  A crowd pleaser for sure, irresistible.

The filling is very easy to make. The chocolate I see some people had issues with. I found doing the doubt boiler method works better than the microwave and add a little bit of oil to the chocolate as it's melting. It makes it more liquid. Also, keep the temperature at a simmer so it doesn't get thick or burn.

Our family makes these Oreo truffles every year and LOVE them!! They are so easy to make.  I made them for the office staff and they ask for them every year as well. One of the best recipes on allrecipes.com!

I make these every year for Christmas and they are always a huge hit! I always dip them in different things to give them a different taste (in melted peanut butter chips, andi's mint candies, cherry Hershey's kisses, etc.) AMAZING!!!

Wonderful! These turned out great and look like something store bought. I used a small food processor to crush the Oreo's  (I had to do several small batches). Then I used a hand mixer to blend it with the cream cheese. I tried the toothpick trick for dipping and it worked great. Next time I will put these in those small cupcake liners so the chocolate doesn't pool at the bottom. WILL MAKE EVERY YEAR FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange party and they were a huge hit. Ever since then my family refuses to let a Christmas go by without me making them. They are extremely time consuming and messy, but are just divine. I use the Baker's chocolate in the microwavable tub. It melts very easily and can be microwaved again when it starts to thicken up. Plus, the tub is the perfect size for dipping. I use two spoons and just transfer the balls from one to the other to let the excess chocolate drain back into the container.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them:)))

Love these!  So easy.  I crush the cookies in a zip lock with a rolling pin.  Before I dip them, I chill first, but I chill with the toothpick in it.  Makes dipping a breeze!

This is an easy recipe, though time consuming. 
We crushed the oreos in a food processor before adding the cream cheese and made a smooth mixture, and made the balls right away. Since the "dough" is so soft, we put the balls in the freezer before dipping them in melted chocolate. 
We used a double-boiler method to keep the chocolate warm while dipping, and found that we had to add some butter/coconut oil to make the chocolate a bit finer and easier to dip in (we put a couple inches of water in the crockpot to keep it hot, and put the chocolate and coconut oil in a glass measuring bowl).
Threw the finished balls in the freezer to firm them up and they don't take long to set!

Made these for the first time last year, ended up making 3 other batches during the same holiday season they were such a huge hit! Planning on making these again.

Some tips:
1- Don't freeze the batter before making the balls, I don't see how this can be helpful, probably making it more difficult to break off and create evenly sized Oreo balls.
2- Dark chocolate is amazing replacement for the chocolate coat. These became a bigger hit than the milk counterpart at holiday parties.
3- I microwaved small batches of chocolate chips in a bowl for the dipping, take out only a few Oreo balls at time for the dipping, I rolled the balls around with a spoon within the melted chocolate bowl. (NOTE: White chocolate was a FAIL in the microwave- it did not melt properly, might actually have to do the double boil process for it. Will try that this year.)

Yes the process for the chocolate coating is time consuming, but it's totally worth it :)

Reallllllly delicious!!! My sister and I made this for Memorial Day! We used gihradelli white melting chocolate. We also dyed the chocolate red white and blue and arranged it in the shape of the flag.  We tried it with just plain white chocolate, but when we added the food coloring it hardened up and we had to throw it out. Very tasty though :)

A coworker brought these to the office and they quickly disappeared- they are yummy!   I made the mistake of trying to melt chocolate in the microwave.  The chocolate didn't melt well.  It was dry and not able to dip and coat the balls.  The chocolate melts better in a double boiler.  I didn't have a double boiler but just placed metal mixing bowl over a pot of water.  Adding a small amount of oil to the melting chocolate keeps it glossy.  I will try chocolate specifically for dipping next time.  The biggest challenge was coating the balls with chocolate without coating being too thick.  Even without chocolate coating they are delicious...and easy to make.

Love these! After trying these incredibly delicious Oreo creations at a cookie exchange, I just had to try them myself. When I found that the recipe had come from Allrecipes.com- I was ecstatic! Eating these cookie balls, you would think to make these you would need to be a cookie-making pro. The cookie and cream cheese combination is genius. This is definitely a recipe I recommend.

I loved this recipe. The rolling in chocolate is time consuming. It helps to freeze the balls before dipping and keep the chocolate very runny. One thing I did notice.... Doing these a day ahead is a great idea because they need time to sit and marry. At first they were ridiculously sweet. The next day they were perfect, and interestingly enough, became better once they got to room temp. I'm going to make again, and this time I'm gonna try different cookies. Yummy!

I use this recipe all the time and my family and friend love it!  I learned the hard way on the dipping in chocolate, it came out really thick! I used some paraffin wax to thin out the chocolate so it wasn't such a thick coating on there and it worked great!!!  Haven't tried the snowmen yet... but is a great idea for making with the kids to leave for Santa ;) thank you for the idea!

These taste good, but they are a lot harder to make than they look. You need a food processor to get them fine enough to be perfectly round. Mine look awful, but taste yummy.

very good recipe but I added paraffin wax to my chocolate and it was very easy to dip and use. I also took slips of paper and cut out the 1st initial of everyone in my family and coated in powdered sugar so you could see the letter and they were super cute and fun to make :)

I tried this with Golden Oreos and it turned out great!!  This recipe works for all sorts of holidays.  I made it for Christmastime and used red and green sprinkles, dipped in white almond bark and used blue and red sprinkles for 4th of July, making some now just for the fun of it!

It was delicious at first when I made them but they went bad really fast. They were easy to make besides when it was time to make a perfect round ball it was really clingy and then when I had to dip it in the chocolate. How am I suppose to get it out without making a big slit through it with a spoon? But people have different opinions.

too much mess for a less than spectacular pay off.  2 of 4 kids liked the white chocolate dipped ones all right, the ones i dipped in chocolate chocolate were just too much, no one liked those.  will not make again.

For fun Christmas Party appetizers, this is a great choice.  I made plain, mint and mixed berry.  All were awesome.

These are delicious and so easy to make! They also don't take up any space in your oven or microwave when cooking multiple dishes. I have also made them using the Mint Oreo cookies for a mint chocolate variety.
