I have made these twice and have had excellent results both times.  My only pet peeve with this recipe is that it calls for "one zucchini" - if you see the massive size of the ones that came out of my parents' garden this year...so I have experimented with 2-3 cups of zucchini and it's been fine.  I love that they freeze well and are great for me to eat at work.  I've also substituted applesauce for the oil and chocolate chips for the cherries.  Both worked well for us!

I really, really enjoyed these healthy muffins, so did my almost 2 year old daughter and my husband.    They were delicious and moist.  We are striving to reduce processed foods and this was a perfect addition to our meal plans.  I almost exactly followed the recipe.  I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil (1/2 cup for 1/2 cup) and didn't add the pecans because I didn't have any on hand and I wasn't sure if my daughter would eat them anyway.  My yogurt was Greek yogurt.  My only regret is not doubling this batch.  I felt great about letting my daughter eat these for dinner because of all the veggies and fruit.  These muffins barely rise, so fill your muffin tins completely.

Before using the oats in this recipe, I ran them through the food processor to get a finer consistancy. I also did not have dried cherries, I substituted Craisins. I got twelve biggish muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done at a little over 22 minutes. These were VERY good, perfectly sweet, moist and slightly chewy and packed with all kinds of yummy goodies. The whole family loved them. DELICIOUS.

I substituted a shredded apple (with peel) for the zucchini and used honey flavoured Greek yogurt. These were delicious and even got top marks from my picky husband. This recipe excites me because I can have a lot of fun with substitutions and experiment with flavours. I will definitely make this again and again! Thank you for posting.

If I could give 2.5, I would.  These had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, they come out super soggy and mushy.  I felt like it needed more flour going in, but I stuck to the recipe (unlike pretty much all the other reviewers for this recipe.) I would say add at least another cup of flour.  I know zucchini and banana breads are moist, but these were so moist that they almost seemed raw.  I would try again, but add more flour, and possibly more spices ginger, cinnamon, and some vanilla extract.  Also, another reviewer said she used 2-3 cups shredded zucchini as one zucchini's worth.  I also have huge garden zucchinis and used 2 cups shredded.  I would stick with that, as long as you increase the flour.  The flavor combination was nice, we just didn't like the mushy middles.

I have made these several times, and it's now my favorite muffin recipe! They are great for breakfast, or anytime! The first time I made it as written, but its so easy to make substitutions to suit your taste or what you have on hand.  I have subbed dried cranberries for the cherries, sunflower seeds for the pecans, pur√©ed butternut squash for the zucchini, you get the idea. With all the nutritious ingredients, I feel good about giving them to my two year old, who gobbles them up! She loves to open them and find all the goodies and chunks inside. The recipe makes 12 big muffins, and I fill the cups all the way to the top because they don't rise too much. They freeze very well, but between myself, my husband and daughter, they are usually gone before I get a chance to freeze any for later!

I used soy milk instead of yogurt, spelt flour instead of whole wheat, and raisins instead of cherries.  I replaced the brown sugar with half the amount of honey, and found that these were VERY sweet muffins.  I love the color, texture and taste of these moist muffins!  When I make them again, I will plan of freezing some, as I'm sure they will freeze well!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very adaptable. I make these all the time at the request of my hubby, but I use leftover baked plain sweet potatoes or canned pumpkin in place of the zucchini - no one in my house cared much for these when zucchini was used. You can pretty much use any flavor of yogurt that you happen to have - I've used plain, peach, vanilla, and pumpkin pie flavored yogurt, both light and greek types, all successfully. I use Craisins or dried blueberries in place of the dried cherries. I also add 1/4 cup ground flaxseed meal and sub unsweetened applesauce for the oil. SO good! I sometimes have to increase the oats by 1/4 cup because they can be almost overly moist. Wonderful flavor! Don't leave out the ginger - it really makes these stand out over others.

Since I am not a person who usually likes healthy muffins, I can say these have changed my mind. This recipe is so versatile. I read every review and followed some of the suggestions (using coconut oil) and applied some of my own changes. I made three versions of these muffins, one as is, the other two I replaced the Bananas, one with pumpkin puree the other with mashed sweet potatoes. In all three I did omit the shredded coconut and dried fruit, because our family is not a fan of either. We kept some out, tossed the rest in the freezer and they have been such a big hit in out home. My kids are munching on them all day, I had to hide them. Next time I will make minis so they can grab them and go outside. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic! I thought I'd venture from my breakfast cookie and make some muffins and came across this recipe. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable and instead of yogurt, cottage cheese. I used a small zucchini. The only nuts I had around was "Almond Meal" from Trader Joes (which is almonds ground to a fine powder), I put in a whole cup to add protein, and I also threw in 1/2 cup of ground flax. These are SO delicious, and the consistency is PERFECT. I cooked mine for 20 minutes. Thanks, Katie! I'm going to try your Kale salad next. Keep posting ;-)

I cannot get enough of these muffins, they are perfect for breakfast at work!  I add more oats (just shy of doubling the amount) to make them a bit more firm (very moist batter), use apple sauce instead of oil, use greek yogurt and add a handful of ground flax seed (for the nutrition).  I also suggest giving the zucchini a squeeze after shredding to remove some of the excess water.  I've been experimenting with flavors and everything has been wonderful, so far my substitutions have been:
- dark chocolate chips instead of nuts and oranges instead of the dried cherries (which were INCREDIBLE, though next time I will add some orange extract as well to bring out the flavor)
- pineapple instead of dried cherries and walnuts instead of pecans (just what was in the cupboard)
- a mix of dried cherries, goji berries and blueberries rather than just all cherries and walnut instead of pecans.
All versions so far have been wonderful and SO filling (though chocolate orange was the household favorite).  It's a great muffin to just put whatever you have on hand into and it just works!  Amazing!

Great snack or healthy breakfast. Teamed with a sausage frittata for a working breakfast meeting. Hit a good note with Paleo dieters, vegetarian and all of us between. Rave reviews and they kept nicely for two more days. Warmed with a bit of butter. Yummmmm!

I am getting ready to try this recipe today.  After shredding my zucchini I will wrap it in a paper towel and squeeze some of the moisture out.  Hoping that well reduce some of the sogginess  some reviewers  have complained about.  Can't wait!

I made these in preparation for my son's arrival in about 3 weeks. They are delicious, nutritious and super moist. I added some chia seeds for extra fiber/omega fats, and walnuts instead of pecans. I doubled the recipe and froze most of them (after my husband and I sampled a couple of course). These will make a prefect breakfast or snack on the go!

These were amazing- moist and flavorful. I  made changes per my taste, as I see many reviewers did. Apple sauce instead of oil, no nuts, added some ground flax seed.... loved them and they will be my new go-to breakfast.

These are great! I did change a couple things. One review said they didn't rise very much so I added a tsp of baking powder since there is yogurt in there it would activate.  I eliminated the brown sugar entirely since I had sweetened vanilla greek yogurt and sweetened coconut and it was plenty sweet, but cut the salt in half. I chopped the bananas instead of mashing them to make it more chunky and swapped the oil for equal part applesauce. My 2 year old loves these

Such a customizable recipe,  which I love! I generally mash my bananas with a pinch of brown sugar, honey-flavored Greek yogurt, a splash of vanilla and applesauce. I'm also generally inclined to add dashes of spices like cinnamon,  cloves,  nutmeg or pumpkin pie/apple pie spice. I decrease the oil (I like canola or coconut) and sub applesauce or extra yogurt (or sometimes both!)  I give the oats, coconut, and pecans a couple whirls in the food processor, but next time I'll go for more texture.  I also add a shredded granny smith apple to the mix as well. I use these as grab-and-go breakfasts,  and feel good about serving them to my 5 year-old DD.

Great recipe! I used butternut squash puree in place of carrots, applesauce instead of oil. I ground the oatmeal and added 1T milled flax and 1/2 t baking powder (some mentioned them not rising). I will probably increase the oatmeal by 1/3 c next time to soak up some more moisture. Used half the sweetener (b. sugar/honey combo) and it was perfectly not sweet but not nasty.

I just finished baking these and they are hearty and delicious! The weather is cooling down inn South Korea and these are the perfect morning breakfast treats! Like others, I subbed the oil for applesauce  but followed everything thing. Definitely a keeper!

I read a few of the other reviews and decided to process the shredded zucchini and shredded carrot before putting them into the wet ingredients bowl.  I also decided to put the oats and coconut in the food processor before adding to the dry flour to mix.  
I used craisins and walnuts (chopped) instead of cherries and pecans.  (Only b/c those were the ingredients I had at the time.)  
Once I mixed the wet into the dry, I decided to add an over flowing 1/4 cup of oats unprocessed/whole and an overflowing 1/4 cup of flour.  They baked for 24 minutes.  Delicious. Not gooey.  Not dry.   
Great recipe.  Thank you!

I LOVE these muffins and so does my 1 year old. I keep them stocked in my freezer for quick and tasty breakfasts. I leave out the pecans because my little one isn't ready for nuts and the coconut just because I prefer them without it.  As another reviewer suggested I also substitute applesauce for the oil. I've  used dried cranberries and fresh blueberries in place of the dried cherries and they're great every time. I can always count on my daughter gobbling this breakfast right up and I'm happy knowing she's getting so many good things!

Before I make any recipe I read  the reviews and take the suggestions to heart.  This is an amazing and heart healthy recipe and my family loved it!  The trick is to use a zucchini on the smaller side so they don't turn out too mushy - thanks to Ryersae for that tip.  Only change I made was to add 2 Tbsp of ground flax (added health factor)and for lack of cherries and pecans we substituted with raisins. Love them and will definitely be making these again and again and again.

Great muffins!  Very moist and dense.  I added a little vanilla and used Craisins instead of dried cherries, but other than that didn't change anything.  I cooked mine for the full 22 minutes to bake - and maybe could have used a few more.

Great base recipe for a healthier muffin. As said by others, these don't rise much, so feel free to fill your muffin cups to the brim! They came out perfectly after baking 21 minutes.

For adjustments, I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil, apple in place of zucchini, and omitted the nuts. I also added about 1/4 cup ground flax and used quick-cooking oats instead of rolled oats, which might have helped reduce the "sogginess" some reviewers experienced.

These are delicious! I used 2 cups of shredded zucchini - hard to know what amount is in 'one zucchini'. I kept them in the fridge and they were great even 5 days after I made them.

I made this exactly like the recipe says. I needed a good breakfast that I can just grab and go. I really liked how moist the muffins are and all of the healthy ingredients. I shared some with my 13 month old and he gobbled it up. I will use less salt in the future.

not the best for the office ladies didn't like the healthy part. use 2-3 C zucchini, forgiving - even try pureed butternut squash instead of zucchini,  
can use choc. chips, or craisons instead of cherry, etc, applesauce instead of oil, 
can run oats through food processer to get finer, 
freeze well, 
Need to bake longer, used Med. size pan and still need an extra 10 min.

Loved everything about this muffin.  Only change I made was craisens for the cherries. I used average grocery size zucchini, 1 1/2 bananas (hubby got to the bananas!) and had no issues with it's being too mushy.  Perfect moistness as measurement was given. Definitely will make again. Actually I am making a 2nd batch now to share at church.  Yum!

Wow! I was a tad sceptical, but these were awesome! My 2 year old daughter and I loved them. She finished hers and said "I want yours too". Lol :). I followed the recipes, but used walnuts (more affordable) and raisins (what I had).  My only complaint was that they were crumbly taking out of the pan. Not sure why that would be. They taste great! I love that they are pretty healthy and loaded with veggies and other good stuff. Lots of work to grate carrots and zucchini and measure out all the ingredients, but worth it.  I will definitely make again

These muffins are SO yummy!  I did substitute applesauce in place of oil, raisins in place of cranberries, and gluten free flour in place of the whole wheat flour.  I have been looking for a good, healthy, muffin recipe for a while and have finally found it!

Great! Left out cranberries because husband doesn‚Äôt care for cooked raisins or cranberries but they‚Äôd be delicious. I made a double batch and used five dead bananas, and two huge carrots shredded fine. It made 24 full size muffins plus 22 mini muffins! Only ten of the minis remain as the kids found them delicious. These are NOT sweet and VERY good. Fill the cups 4/5 full; they did not overflow. The tiny ones I cooked for 20 min; large cooked about 25 and ones in silicone cups in a baking sheet cooked 30.

Other than replace the oil with unsweetened applesauce (which I do in all recipes, knocking off nearly 40 calories per muffin), I followed the recipe exactly - it was wonderful! Texture was perfect, baked in 20 minutes exactly.  I may add a bit more spice next time - and there will be many "next times"!
Just a comment for those who had issues with the baked muffin being undercooked: I bake a lot with zucchini (from my garden); it is necessary to really drain the moisture from it, or the bread will be way too moist.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Kids love them. 

For those who are worried about high moisture - Note: drain the zucchini after shredding by wrapping in towel and squeezing, you'll remove almost 0.5C of water. Also, whole wheat flour is a must, if you substitute white flour, cut back the wet ingredients.

Yes I exchanged pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds for the nuts. I added 1/4 cup of apple sauce and that really made them moist, I didn't need butter or want it, because it's so moist already! I did add a little alspice to the mix and WOW WOW WOW, it's so good ?? everyone wants me to either give them the recipe or make them for them LoL ?????? 
These are so health yet you wouldn't even care cause they are so good! Try it, I've been baking for years and I am thrilled..so I think that says something.. lol

These turned out very well. The second batch I made last night was doubled on everything except the yogurt,( because I didn't have enough) and they are definitely drier than the first batch but still delicious.  I will definitely make these again and look forward to trying different ingredient combos.

Way too mushy. I made one batch following the recipe and it came out sooo mushy gushy and raw tasting. Very bad consistency. I added flour to the second batch and that made the consistency much better but I would not make these muffins again; they're nothing special.

I have made these muffin several times and thought I should finally review it. These taste yummy and you don't have to feel guilty about eating them because they are so healthy.  I made a few changes due to my husband's 
health issues.  I used unsweetened applesauce for the oil, splenda for the sugar and used craisins because I didnt have any cherries. They are a bit labor intensive, but well worth it. They are moist, slightly sweet, and chewy. They freeze well too. My only regreat is not making a double batch, because they disappear so quickly!

These were just as yummy as previous reviews suggested--I left out the coconut and added an extra half cup of flour and oats. Then, I threw in about 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Next time, I will bake a little longer than the 18 minutes I baked at the first go-round.

I'm always looking for healthy alternatives to make for my diabetic husband.  I made these last night so he could have with his coffee this morning.  He loved them!  I read the reviews first and, though I didn't have all of the ingredients, decided to give it a go using what I had on hand.  I only used 1 banana, substituted 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used 1/4 cup of Truvia for baking instead of the brown sugar, used 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds for the pecans, 1/2 cup of raisins for the cherries, and cut back the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. As another reviewer suggested, I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes before taking them out and cooling them completely on the rack.  They came out perfect! Delicious and not too sweet.  I will make them again!

This is a great recipe! Followed the original recipe with some small add ins...ground clove, nutmeg, ground flax seed and chia seeds. These muffins are a great grab and go, taste amazing and are moist with the perfect crispy outside. Tripled the recipe and still turned out fab!

I only had one banana, used an apple instead of a zuke, used applesauce instead of oil and walnuts instead of pecans. I added more oats at reviewers suggestions. These came out perfectly and tasted great. Loved by all, young and old. I will definitely make these again. It is super versatile.

Very tasty muffins. I didn't have dried cherries so I added some crab-apple applesauce. I reduced the sugar and added a small amount of maple syrup as well. Everyone enjoyed them.

Loved my first batch so much I immediately made a second. But the size of the carrots must have been different. Something went wrong with the second batch. They didn‚Äôt cook well and were too mushy. I had to take them out before they burned. Will try again. I would give it 5 stars if the amount of zucchini and carrots needed were better specified.

I love these! I‚Äôve made them so many times!!!! I make them on Sunday and put them I a giant ziploc bag in my freezer and have  two for breakfast during the week. My daughter asks to have them for her breakfast too (4 yrs old). You do have to be careful about moisture. I‚Äôve only ruined them 1 time bc I put in too much zucchini.

Delicious!  A baking time closer to 22-23 minutes worked best for my oven. I used honey peach greek yogurt.

Because of the mushiness, do NOT sub fresh fruit for the dried. I subbed the raisins for fresh blueberries and these were a hot mess. I even doubled the oats to get more dry ingredients and it didn‚Äôt work out. This recipe as written is just way too wet to hold together. They still seem raw on the inside after full cooking time.

They were moist and delicious.   Two words my children rarely use when speaking of my baking.   I did substitute for what I had on hand, hemp ie almonds for pecans and pear for zucchini.  Will make often

I have found I continually return to this recipe.   Highly recommend

These muffins are outstanding! I was out of carrots so I skipped those, and I used walnuts & raisins instead of pecans & cherries, cuz that's what I had in the cupboard. They were absolutely delicious, really flavourful without being too sweet, and a fantastic option for quick breakfast. They also freeze really well.
The only thing I'd mention--though it's not a complaint--is that they don't rise all that much, so feel free to fill your muffin cups. On the first batch I only filled them 3/4 full and ended up with very small muffins, so for the second batch I loaded them up. I'll be making them again this weekend!

These are very good.  I made them as is except I used dried chopped apricots instead of cherries since I had them on hand.  The recipe made 12 regular size muffins plus 9 mini muffins.

I used unbleached flour as I was out of whole wheat and I used raisins, an apple  and sunflower seeds as I didn't have the zucchini, cherries and pecans. I would add a little more cinnamon next time but other than that they were perfect. Very moist - I sent them to work with the grandkids who are all into healthy eating. They loved them and didn't feel guilty about eating them.

These muffins were delicious and live up to the name "Hearty". I didn't have any zucchini on hand so I used a small apple in its place. And I substituted kefir for the yogurt. I also didn't have the nuts or dried cranberries so I just left them out, but they were still great without them. I think there is some flexibility in the additional items like nuts and dried fruit, so you can add what you like.

I squeeze most of the water out of the zucchini before I use it. This prevents the mushiness from happening.
Plain Greek yogurt is my favourite type to use, but vanilla should work. I'll probably reduce the sugar too.
I tend to skip the dried fruit, and instead add a few mini chocolate chips.
Delicious.

I substituted pumpkin for the bananas and shredded apples for the coconut. I probably should have added a bit more flour or oats to compensate for the additional ‚Äúwet‚Äù items. The texture was a bit mushy. Still, The flavor was really tasty!

I made these a few years ago and shared with my daughter who LOVES making them!
I used all purpose flour so my wheat intolerant husband can have them. I double the recipe and use  coconut oil and applesauce. Cranberries instead of cherries.  I added about a third cup more flour for a thicker consistency and they rose a lot! My bananas were very ripe like I use for banana bread. I would like to add vanilla next time to enhance flavor. Also considering adding pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice for the holidays.  You can‚Äôt go wrong trying different ingredients. Enjoy:)

The only change was to omit the dried cherries due to family preference. These are amazing, so soft & moist.  I doubled the recipe & frozen more than half. Wanted to have these on hand in freezer  for busy mornings to pop in microwave. Big hit & they freeze well.
Thank you Katie for sharing

Will definitely make these again and I look forward to it. They taste great and full of healthy ingredients!  Used 1 1/4 cups zucchini, baked them an extra 5 minutes, based on the toothpick test and they are Super. Read some reviews and will be playing with the ingredients next time, ie applesauce instead of oil. Thanks for the great recipe!!  Ps. Took me a lot longer than 20 minutes to put the recipe together

I substituted raisins for the cherries. Yum. I love the ginger.

No ginger and have substituted all ones of veggies like summer squash, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, apples etc. Also substitute dried cranberries and frozen blueberries and walnuts instead of pecans. Also added a couple of teaspoons of flax seeds and unprocessed wheat bran!  Delicious and healthy!

I heard these muffins might be a bit too wet and not firm up in the middle so I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, a 1/4 cup of wheat bran and 1/4 cup of oats for a total of an extra 3/4 dry ingredients.  Since the wet ingredients were very vague I used 2 cups shredded zucchini, 1 large carrot, and 2 medium sized bananas.   I did a test batch and even cooking at the max time they were very wet in the middle and did not rise well.  So I added 1 tsp of baking powder and approx another 3/4 cup of dry ingredients.  This time they came out nicely rounded and cooked all the way through.  
Therefore I would suggest if adding approx 2 cups zucchini, 2 med bananas and 1 large carrot to add AT LEAST an extra cup dry ingredients (I added approx 1 1/2 cups of dry ingredients).  Also 1 tsp of baking powder seemed to help a lot.  I cannot rate the original recipe well but with the changes it came out to a definite 5 stars and even my picky kids managed to already eat quite a few between them.  Not an overall sweet muffin, but definitely has lots of texture and flavor and is pleasant to enjoy with a cup of tea or coffee. 
Also I did not have pecans and added sliced almonds instead which was great.

I have made this a dozen times and it is amazing! I add vanilla for flavor and I make them in mini muffins because they are too difficult to cook the center if you make them in the regular size. I use coconut oil and coconut brown sugar (half the amount of sugar). My 9 month old and 3 year old gobble them up!

These muffins were delicious.   I was unable to find zucchini do doubled up carrots and added beet pulp. Used walnuts instead of pecans.  Very hearty!

These are absolutely fantastic! I will be making these weekly. As per another reviewer, it‚Äôs uncertain how much zucchini to add as it does not specify size, measurement, weight etc. So she tried them a few times and she said to use 2 to 3 cups of shredded zucchini. I purchased a smallish zucchini (maybe 1 foot in length) at the grocery store, and it was the perfect size. Again these are fabulous!  You will regret NOT making them!  LOL

I really like this recipe! I doubled it and made a bunch of changes to add what I had on hand and the muffins turned out great! I had no oats so I substituted a mixture of chia seeds and flax meal. I had no coconut so I substituted hemp hearts. Instead of zucchini and banana I added mixed frozen berries and added a little bit more yogurt for moisture. I added cocoa nibs instead of shredded coconut but kept a coconut flavour with coconut oil and coconut sugar. They are hearty and delicious!

These are moist and hearty.  I told everyone that they were oat muffins so they would last, that did not work.  I made a double batch with blueberries instead of cherries, and they were gone in a couple of hours.  I gave the recipe to all concerned so I can now eat theirs when they make them.  I suggest you make double batches and freeze them.

my muffins turned out great. I didn't know how much zucchini to use, so I used to 2 small I had in my fridge. I did squeeze out the zucchini after shredding it, because there is a lot of water in zucchini and it can make your bread/muffins very heavy and wet. I didn't have coconut, so I didn't put any in, and I put in a little flax meal to help soak up the extra fluid. turned out well, would make again!

I made it with slightly modifications: I put the veggies into the ninja blender as time was limited...i did not put coconut nor dried cherries.  it went flat on me as i opened the oven and after 30 min the muffins were not cooked inside even though the toothpick came out clean...  it tastes good but not presentable...

I adapted this recipe to cut down on any wetness and they turn out better for me.  I reduced bananas to one only, substituted applesauce for oil.  I didn't want to use nuts so used 2 T chia seeds (plan to try poppy seeds).   Used dried cranberries.  I like the way they turn out better without using paper cup liners, too.
I also cut down the brown sugar by loosely measuring to just below 1/2 cup...did not pack it.  Doesn't compromise flavor at all.

So good! My 4 and 6 year olds approve! Plus they had a fun time helping to shred the carrots and zucchini. I altered the recipe a little by halving the brown sugar; and instead of dried cherries we did raisins; and I omitted the shredded coconut and nuts and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. We also added half a cup of chopped blueberries. The muffins turned out so great! Will definitely make them again.

Great muffins!! Like other reviewers I subbed applesauce for the oil. They took about 23 mins at 375 and were very moist inside, which I like.  Also used raisins instead of dried cherries for personal preference. My toddlers love them! Would be great with some kind of cream cheese spread... Thanks so much!

I made a few changes, based on what I had in my kitchen. I did NOT have any zucchini, so used just carrots and bananas. Zucchini has alot of water in it, so after you shred it you need to put it in a cloth to squeeze all the water out. Instead of oil I used unsweetened applesauce. Eggbeaters instead of eggs (just pure laziness on my part lol) dates instead of dried cherries. I also ADDED 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder, in addition to the baking soda. Timer on for 15 minutes to start, but needed just 2 more minutes to finish. Leaving them in the muffin tin for 5 minutes after baking and they cook just a bit more. I made my husband split one with me. They smelled very good baking and I have to say they were surprisingly tasty. He said they reminded him more of a dessert muffin, rather than a breakfast muffin, lol. I'd actually like to try them again with the zucchini to see how that changes it.

These muffins are such a good grab and go breakfast. So much so that my veggie hating teen loves them. The first time that I made them I made them as is, just swapping dried cranberries for the cherries because that's what I had on hand. My fave substitutions are to swap ground flax for the coconut, adding chia seeds, and 1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks.

Love the versatility and deliciousness of these healthier muffins! After having made these per the recipe, I became daring! I add whatever I have on hand, including grated apple, yellow squash, left over trail mix, applesauce instead of oil, whatever! They turn out great every time. This last time I added cocoa powder because I was craving chocolate. Needed a tiny bit more sweetness to offset the bitterness of the cocoa powder, but the craisins and other sweet goodies came really close to doing the trick. I will be making these often! Thank you for sharing!

We recently had an ice skating show here in Southern Oregon where 10 professionals come and perform along with our local talent. I went out on a limb and volunteered to make breakfast for everyone. Besides making a couple egg casseroles, I made two versions of these and they were a hit! One I did with all ingredients but substituted apple for zucchini. Oh WOW! The other I just left out the nuts and coconut. Both were fantastic and will be making these often. Such a good grab and go in the morning! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made it as directed with one small step added. Squeeze out the excess water from the zucchini but the rest of the recipe is perfect. Freezes beautifully.

With the long list of ingredients I thought this might be a lot of work but it wasn't. No more difficult than banana muffins with a bit more quick measuring! I used plain Greek yogurt to up the protein and was thinking about adding flax or chia seeds but thought my first run should follow the recipe as is. Delicious!

These muffins were fantastic!! I didn't have a few of the ingredients to make it chunkier so I made up my own, I DID add carrots, coconut, oats, and banana but from my own kitchen I threw in some hemp hearts, dried cranberries, and you count throw in some nuts too! They were extremely easy to make and from my personal experience, you can kind of just wing it a bit.

These were great!! Did quite a few substitutions such as honey instead of sugar and coconut chips instead of shredded coconut. In the future think shredded coconut will do better just none on hand. Also skipped the carrot and just did the zucchini and banana with a lil extra zucchini. Did it nut free and raisons as a previous comment did instead of the cherries. Then for kicks did chocolate chips as well. The 2 year old and 4 year old loved them and so did I. These will be made again.

I made these for the first time this morning and they are so yummy!  The recipe makes 12 nice size muffins and I am taking some to share with fellow potters at my studio.  I left out the nuts (personal preference), added a mix of dried cranberries and tart cherries, and used vanilla flavored greek yogart.  I also added a bit more carrot for the zucchini.  They came out moist but not soggy and just the right sweetness.  I will definitely make these again and will have some fun playing with the ingredients!  This recipe was just what I wanted.

Success! I tripled the recipe (6 cups zucchini, 5 bananas and 3 carrots) and added in about 1/2 a cup of extra flour.  Turned out moist and loved the chunks of raisins, veggies, coconut and nuts. Truly a good muffin for the health conscious and those who want more substance than just flour.

After going through the reviews, added half a cup of number one semolina as well. I didn't drain the zucchini, so still needed more time to cook - 26 minutes. The taste was very nice but the muffins were close to falling apart until completely cold.

I don't like coconut a and my husband doesn't like pecans, do they got omitted. I also used applesauce instead of oil and cranberries instead of cherries for a healthier alternative. I will say tho, they stick to the muffin papers like crazy... Will be looking into an alternative for that.

These were surprisingly good - tasted almost like a dessert but I knew it was filled with healthy and fresh ingredients which made it all the better. I added a couple tablespoons of ground flax seed just to provide some extra fiber and protein. I also used Chobani raspberry greek yogurt. Can't really make out any major taste change from this, though. Overall, excellent recipe!

Followed the recipe to the T with a small sub of dried cranberries for cherries. These muffins are killer! I would just try for an extra 1/2 c. flour next time around. I baked for 22 min on 375 if that helps.

I made mini muffins and had batter left over so made a mini loaf.  I used walnuts.  I also substituted applesauce for oil.   Added a 1/4 cup extra oats and flour until the batter looked about right.  I added more  spices - cloves, nutmeg.  Really great flavors.

Very moist and filling.  I am excited to try other nuts and dried fruits as add-ins.  I think the last step of keeping the muffins in the tin after coming out of the oven is crucial.  I had no problem with them falling apart.  A great snack!

I love this recipe! I played around with it to me it a bit more healthy. I replaced whole eggs with egg whites, made homemade organic applesauce In my food processor, left out the zucchini, replaced vegetable oil with organic cold pressed coconut butter, used walnuts instead of pecans, I used low sugar Craisins and Stevia instead of brown sugar. They were delicious! Complately filling and a great way to start off a day or carry on the hiking trail for quick energy. This will be a regular in my house from this day on. Thanks ?

I made do with what I had at the house so I had to make some changes. I used almonds and walnuts chopped as the nut,  skipped the dried fruit and used one banana. Turned out pretty good, my boyfriend who said the batter looks disgusting and knew there were vegetables in it even said they were good.
Also, I added a new mini chocolate chips which helped becuase I was slightly skeptical. And to save time I used a food processor for the carrots and zucchini!

I've made this a few times.  with a variety of add ins.   This last time I used hubbard squash instead of zucchini.  pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds are good too.  Chopped up some candied ginger and dates for a change.   Delicious!

I loved this recipe! I have made it twice now! I have made several adjustments, and each time they have turned out amazing! (and my boyfriend LOVES them!)

1st Batch: instead of zucchini, I added a whole mashed sweet potato; instead of vegetable oil, I used 1/4 cup melted coconut oil; used 100 calorie vanilla Kroger brand Greek yogurt; used Morena brand cane sugar instead of the brown sugar; No coconut, but instead added 1/2 cup toasted black walnuts, instead of the cherries, I added 1/2 cup dried blueberries and also added 1/2 cup chopped dates; I also added 1.5 tsp pure vanilla extract; and I added 1/4 cup flax seed meal. Everything else was the same on the recipe list.

My 2nd batch, I kind of went the same route as above, but made a couple of changes.  I used one cup of shredded carrots and one cup of shredded zucchini; I didn't have the vanilla yogurt, so I opted for my boyfriend's Yoplait blueberry yogurt! I increased my vanillla extract to 2 tsp. Instead of the black walnuts, I used toasted hazelnuts.

For my 3rd Batch, I am going to try using Almond Flour instead of the wheat flour! I like the fact that I don't need any xanthum gum with the almond flour (at least that is what the articles online say!) I'll let you know how it turns out!

Happy Baking!

Love, love, love these muffins! I'm gluten free so I just replace the whole wheat flour with a packaged gluten free blend and it's still delicious . After reading all the reviews, especially in regards to the high moisture problems, I shred and drain the zucchini and carrots for at least 3 hrs, add about an extra quarter cup of flour, and let the muffins cool to room temp.  I find these muffins firm up and taste better when just slightly warm to room temp.

I add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, toss in a little more cinnamon, a little less sugar because I don't like sweet, dried cranberries instead of cherries, and sometimes walnuts instead of pecans.

I wish the carrot /zucchini measurements were in cups instead of by piece but I use about 2 cups carrots and 1 cup of zucchini., maybe a little more at times. I also bake for 30 min.

I do all the prep in the evening and in the morning it's just mix and bake, so much faster and easier.  And I double the recipe since it is a lot of work to make only one batch, and they get gobbled down so quickly.

This is a delicious muffin. I used plain yoghurt and skipped the cherries. They were lightly sweet, but still very tasty. I might add more ginger next time as I couldn't really taste it.

I made these last night after harvesting carrots from my garden. They were a great way to get vegetables in and use up what we had on hand. I used one banana and one apple as that is what we had on hand, 1 egg and an egg white left over from another recipe. Instead of dried cherries, I used craisins, omitted the pecans and added two handfuls of chocolate chips. I recommend adding more cinnamon and ginger. My husband and I loved these for breakfast today. Great fall breakfast on the go.

This was GREAT. Very moist and very adaptable. I used flavored yogurt that we make ourselves as it was on hand. I also threw in some fiber supplement (Benefiber brand), some LSA, and some chia seeds, as well as mincing some regular (not dried) cherries. Used dessicated not shredded coconut as that is what I had. I also left out the nuts and put in a handful of mini chocolate chips, another of diced plums, and another of raisins. So a lot of tweaking around the edges, but the basic recipe was unchanged. It is GREAT. Can always add more dry ingredients or drain the shredded carrot/zucchini to cut down on the moisture. Thanks so much for this - will be packing it in my little one's lunchbox as well as eating en route to school!

Very yummy, even though I forgot the bananas.  I substituted more dried fruit for for coconut and nuts because of family preferences.  I also used applesauce instead of oil.  The recipe is flexible!

Hearty Breakfast Muffins Haiku: "So wet & squishy. Perhaps more flour or oats? Still, they tasted good." Definitely four stars for flavor (the baby approves and would probably give them 10 stars) but the batter was very wet, and the resulting muffin was overly moist. Some muffins can be overly dense and heavy, and others too smooshy - I like them to hover in the middle, so I think this one either needs less wet additions (or drain the zucchini 1st), or more oats and/or flour. The only change that I made was to drop the pecans, and use raisins instead of cherries.

This came out surprisingly moist and perfectly sweet.  They were gone within a few hours in my house and I will definitely be making more.

These are awesome!! Made them this morning with a few tweaks. Like someone else suggested, I used grated apple instead of the zucchini, since I couldn't find any zucchini at the store. I squeezed out some of the juice from the apple so that they wouldn't be too moist. I also used chopped dried dates instead of cherries. The dates are yummy in the muffins but a bit soft, I think dried cherries or raisins would have been better. Anyway nevertheless they are hearty and delicious! Highly recommend.

Recipe very moist and full of fruits and veggies...I made some substitutions, coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, Apple sauce instead of oil and finally used quinoa flour.  My elderly parents love it as I made them in tiny cake pans for them.

Followed it exactly except omitted the coconut.  I froze them to pop out for a quick breakfast.  They hold together well (I've made other recipes that were too dry and fell apart) and these are super moist!  Just sweet enough, not overly sweet.  LOVE THIS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING!  I have passed this along to friends and family.  I took a photo but it's too large to share but mine looked just as good as photo above.

My family loved this recipe.  I did use craisens in place of dried cherries, and almond flour in place of whole wheat, and coconut oil (as recommended by another reviewer), and they turned out awesome!!! They did not last 2 days.  Now making them again for the 2nd time.

A versatile, tasty recipe.  Made significant changes based on the reviews:

-Added 1/2 cup white flour.
-Omitted yogurt; used 1 tbsp cultured buttermilk instead
-Used 1/3 cup melted virgin coconut oil
-Used 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder
-Added 1 tbsp freshly ground ginger
-Added 1 tsp Penzey's apple pie spice
-Squeezed the shredded zucchini to remove some juice
-Omitted cherries; used 1/4c dried dates and 1/4c raisins
-Baked for 27 minutes

Because I used banana-bread-ripe bananas and some dates, they were very sweet. I would have used 1/4c sugar.

So good! I love how hearty and healthy they are. I added flaxseed to mine and passed on the raisins. My husband has raved about them and this recipe yielded about 24 standard sized muffins. Perfect for freezing and for on the go!

I made this recipe for the first time  exactly as written...they were fabulous. They are moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making them again soon to stock up the freezer.  No need to change a thing....I baked mine at least 25 minutes.

Super delicious.  The variety of flavors is a delight. Super moist with the banana and zucchini. - I was out of carrots, and didn't use ginger. I split the rolled oats amount with half quinoa flakes, and added 2 tablespoons wheat germ. Give it a try!

Overall these muffins were really good! I made a few changes- I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, I omitted the pecans and cherries, and I added a bit more spices. Also I made sure to strain both the carrots and the zucchini before I added them to the mixture- I think this would help solve the problem some people were having about the recipe not calling for enough flour- there was a LOT of liquid in the vegetables. One problem I had with this recipe was that it called for an entire teaspoon of salt!! I only added about half that much, thinking it seemed like a lot, and still my muffin turned out a bit too salty for my taste. Other than the salt issue, these muffins were wonderful- very moist and light- not dense like I thought it might be. I will definitely make these again, maybe with a bit of orange zest next time...

First time making these muffins and they came out pretty well. I had to leave them in for almost 35 minutes since the recipe was very wet, probably due to using frozen bananas.

My family asked, "What's in these things?" My answer was "Everything!"  I used carrots, bananas, pumpkin, apple sauce, coconut, dried blueberries, pecans, chocolate chips, oats, whole wheat flour, eggs, coconut oil, eggs, yogurt, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, & salt. Whew! I baked in silicone muffin and mini loaf pans filled to the top. Cooling in the silicone made them easier to push out whole. Next time I want to add a streusel topping! Happy Baking!

Tastes like a carrot cake and banana bread combo.  I was looking for a recipe to use ripe bananas but wanted something more nutritious than regular banana bread. These muffins even got a thumbs up from an unnamed individual who doesn't like anything too healthy tasting.

I really like these muffins.  I'm sick of cereal for breakfast so was looking for something healthy for a quick morning meal.  These were very easy to make and exceeded my expectations, with great texture and only slight sweetness.  Much better than store-bought muffins with sugar listed as the number one ingredient. I used dried cranberries and chopped walnuts because I happened to have them on hand.  I also used 1 whole egg and two egg whites. While no recipe tweaking is necessary, I may next time use only egg whites and try different fruit and nuts, as suggested.  I also enjoy eating them with a slice of nice sharp cheddar cheese. Mission accomplished.

These are very moist and tasty without being too sweet.  As reviewer Helen did, I substituted a shredded apple for the zucchini which turned out really well.  Also, I'm a big fan of flax seed meal because it really helps with hot flashes and it's very nutritious so I substituted 1/4 cup of flax seed meal for the flour.  I will definitely make these again.  As others noted, you can use lots of different combinations of dried fruits and nuts in place of the cherries and pecans to vary the recipe so it doesn't get boring.

These muffins need more 5 star ratings! They have become a staple in our house. I have made them 4x now and they always turn out great. They freeze well, and reheat well. The recipe needs to be doubled, so you can get closer to 2 muffin pans.

Made these for the first time today. As other reviewers suggested,I revised a little. I added 1/4 cup of flaxseed and increased oats to 3/4 cup. Also used applesauce for the oil, and only had organic regular yogurt to use as well as walnuts instead of pecans. Decided to use the chocolate chips instead of cherries. Because I had some whole wheat flour to use up I used it but next time I plan to make it gluten free. Will post it when I do!

I doubled and put two trays in oven at same time and it took 30 min for the toothpick to come out almost dry.  But worth the wait!

This was awesome and I plan to make again and freeze for quick breakfasts before school. My batch made 16 cupcakes and they were the perfect consistency. I substituted chocolate chips since I didn't have any dried cherries on hand and I substituted 1/4 c agave nectar instead of sugar. I also used applesauce in place of oil.

I love to adapt this recipe to what I have on hand. I used applesauce instead of oil and cranberries instead of cherries. Had to turn the oven down and cook a bit longer so they weren't soggy in the middle.

Update: Apparently the first time I made these, by a complete fluke, I hit the proportions right.  The second time -- ROYAL disaster.  I would say that both the zucchini and carrots should be on the med/small side AND the carrot should definitely dictate the amount of zucchini. It can be hard to gauge if these are done even with a fork/toothpick. Mine came out clean, but are complete mush inside. Will continue to play with the recipe, as I know these can be delicious, but had my second experience been my first experience, I would never make these again. Original: Really yummy recipe base, but needs some minor tweaking, as my muffins lost their "bottoms" (!) to the tin despite very adequate greasing. Unlike others, I grated two carrots and then used that amount as the example for how much zucchini to grate (I had to sub some grated apple, as one zucchini was bad inside). Kept all other measurements the same & felt that the ratio of flour was normal. They are beautiful muffins -- look like something from a bakery.  Appreciated hint to fill tins, as they do not rise very much.  My tins were filled to the very top, but did not overflow (made exactly 12). Could probably reduce sugar to 1/3 cup if satisfied with a less sweet muffin.  YUM all around!

These are terrific and about as healthy as you can get a muffin and still have it taste good... the oil, salt, & sugar being the negatives, but this makes 12 big hearty muffins, so 1/4 cup oil divided by 12?? I'm not gonna worry, altho I usually use light olive oil...  AND, I love the flexiblity of this recipe... subbing dark or white raisuns, prunes, dates, cranberries, nuts... I made without the nuts or coconut and they were still wonderful.  I use the old-fashion rolled oats so they add texture, especially if I don't add nuts. I like to shred the carrots very fine so they nearly disappear, no one guesses they're in there. You'll probably get more than 12 muffins if you add all the fruit & nuts... get out 2 pans to be ready.  I now double the cinnamon and ginger, both good healthy spices, and sometime I'll add some flax seed and/or bran, added healthiness!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I have been making at loving these muffins for a few months now. Because there are so many ingredients, I find it convenient to alter the amounts to suit my available ingredients -- I substituted a single smallish eggplant for the zucchini in a doubled recipe and it worked great; oat bran or any other flaky grain works instead of oatmeal. I think that the flavor of the cherries and pecans gets lost a bit, so it's not worth the expense to get those fancier ingredients -- walnuts and raisins are cheaper and work just as well, and I don't notice the flavor difference much.

Very good. The only thing I changed was I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil because it seemed like the right idea. It was delicious.

These are fantastic and healthy! They are perfctly moist and not too sweet. Also, i domt feel bad eating them because they have fruits AND vegetables in them. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used chocolate chips instead of cherries and it worked well with the recipe. Next time I'll try it with cherries also. Both my brother and husband loved them and typically brother hates "healthy" tasting things (aka dry, unsweet, and strange). I will be making these again and again. PERFECT for breakfast!

These are great. I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and used egg whites instead of the full egg. I also used chocolate chips instead of the cherries. I will maybe add a bit flour next time as they are quite moist and seem to take longer to bake than suggested. They don't rise much so fill tins to the brim!

I liked these, but it seemed like the time it takes to bake muffins isn't enough to cook carrots properly. They tasted raw to me. Still, I had no problem eating these for breakfast and snacks as long as they lasted. I didn't have any coconut or walnuts, so I left those out; I don't like walnuts but I think the coconut would have improved them.

Everything CaliforniaGirl said in her review is what I have to say about these muffins. I did everything she did and ended up with the same results. I also have to add that the muffins tasted salty; 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of salt is too much sodium. I tried adding a little more sugar to the second batch, but it didn't help.

Delicious!!! I halved the recipe because hubby isn't a big muffin fan. I subbed apple for zucchini, used steel cut oats, used pan toasted walnuts and crasins, (accidentally) doubled the ginger and tossed in about a tablespoon of chia seeds. I had 12 small muffins even though I halved it- I think they would have been way too moist if I had only done 6 muffins. Before popping them in the oven, I sprinkled the tops with a little extra cinnamon. These are great, but next time I may add more flour to make them a little more cake-like.

These muffins were so hearty and full of good stuff, the flavor is great but they stay really moist due to all the fruits/veg in them, my husband wasn't a fan. I really enjoyed them, might add just a little more flour next time to get them a bit drier. Oh and make sure you spray your muffin tins or liners with oil or something, I thought it wouldn't matter so I didn't, and they totally stuck to the liners! Had to partially freeze them to get them off lol. Overall though a tasty healthy muffin, will make again maybe with some modifications.

I really enjoyed these. I made a few changes based on personal preference. I don't care for coconut and used raisins instead of cherries, but kept the recipe the same otherwise. I'm excited to try them again and start trying some other combinations.

Very good muffins! I made a double batch: half regular size muffins and half mini muffins, the mini only took 11-12 min. Took them to pre school and about 8/10 3yr olds liked them so that's pretty good for toddlers! My 3yr old and 18mo old couldn't get enough! I used raisins instead of cherries, no nuts, and I was short 1 banana for the double batch so used a jar of apple/cherry baby food (which was fine, but not necessary). Used plain greek yogurt and next time will use vanilla greek (I like them a little sweeter, but they were sweet enough for everyone else) and add nutmeg. Will DEFINITELY make again.

Love this recipe, and so do my 2 and 4 year olds. I changed it a bit since starting to make these. I use coconut oil instead of vegetable, applesauce in lieu of yogurt, and add vanilla, flax or chia seeds, and sometimes sub sweet potatoes for carrots depending on what I have. They love helping me make these, and I feel better knowing that they start the day with something packed with wholesome ingredients. Great for snacks, too.

These muffins were delicious!  Tripled the recipe and substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, walnuts for the pecans, and omitted the cherries.  As suggested by another reviewer, who said 2-3 cups of zucchini; I measured 2 cups heaping of the zucchini per recipe (6 heaping cups total for tripled recipe). The zucchini had been shredded a couple days previous to me using it, so it had petty well drained in the plastic bag.  I avoided scooping the liquid out of the bag when measuring.  Took some to mom's house and they asked for the recipe.  Nice, versatile recipe that freezes well!

Yummy.  Very moist and like other reviews mentioned, there are many substitutions available.  I followed the recipe as written and I am very pleased.  Love all of the additions. The family is already asking for another batch.
