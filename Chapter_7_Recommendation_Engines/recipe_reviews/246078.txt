I wonder if they meant to say coconut milk instead of coconut water? The only thing I changed was using jasmine rice instead of basmati. It tasted terrible. Not sweet. Bland. Metallic. We threw it out.

This is great.  I used about 1/4 c of margarita mix with the coconut water because I was making margarita chicken and had it left over.

Delicious! I've never made/eaten Basmati rice, and I'm so glad I finally tried it. The package of rice said to rinse thoroughly before cooking, so I did do that first. The flavors of this are great...sweet and aromatic...this is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
