This was great and got good reviews from the whole family!!  I did the following substitutions as others had suggested and I think they were dead on.  I used 3/4c brown sugar and only 1 Tbls. corn syrup.  (Now that I have made this I might sub maple syrup for the corn syrup next time.)  I only used 4 eggs and it was plenty "eggy".  I can see what others were talking about.  I was able to fit 8 slices of French Bread in the 9" x 13" pan.  I left the crusts on with excellent results.  I would suggest not skimping on the orange liqueur as it definitely added the extra layer of flavor that made it an "over the top" recipe.  Our liqueur stores sell small samples of liqueur at the registers, and I was able to buy that for just a couple bucks!!  I sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking.  Would recommend that too.  After the casserole was done baking I flipped all the slices over and put the dish under the broiler for just a few minutes to brown the tops until golden brown.

Important safety note!  Several reviews have mentioned broiling as a final step.  Be sure NOT to do this if using glass ovenware such as Pyrex, which specifically warns against broiling at the risk of shattering!

This is a great recipe that is much requested at family gatherings. I make a couple of changes as follows: I use 1/2 teaspoon orange extract in place of the liqueur or omit it entirely - you won't really miss it. Use challah or Hawaiian sweet bread instead of french bread. Don't bother to remove the crusts and pack your pan tightly with bread pieces cut 1" thick to absorb the excess liquid. (I use almost an entire loaf of challah for one pan.) Melt the butter in the microwave, stir in the brown sugar and corn syrup and then pour into the pan. The sugar will dissolve during the baking process. No need to bring the pan to room temperature before baking. Invert the pieces as you serve them. The brown sugar mixture is a substitute for syrup, don't use additional syrup when you serve or it will be too sweet.

This was a delicious recipe that I made for Easter brunch.  We all loved it, and overall I would make it again for a weekend treat.  Perfect for make-ahead night before.  I read ALL the reviews before I proceeded and combined all the wonderful suggestions, as I beleive that helped make this recipe even better.  I used a large loaf of 2-day old French bread and left crusts on --- this is soooo key, and especially helpful in "flipping" half-way through baking (you MUST to this to saturate the bread fully, otherwise too eggy as others warned), and then again at the end before broiling to get the caramel sauce nice and brown and bubbly.  If you left the crusts OFF, I beleive it would be too soggy and not as "chewy".  I made it with 4 egss, and thought it turned out great.  I used 1 TBL vanilla vs 1 tsp.  The Grand Marnier is a must, or do something to bring out the orange flavor even more (I will add orange zest next time in additon to a TBL more of GM).  I did add cinnamon to egg mixture  before dipping each slice of bread into it.  Then, I poured the remaining egg mixture over the entire thing before putting in fridge overnight.  I used 1 TBL maple syrup v. corn syrup (liked this!!).  Served with slices of strawberries for more elegant presentation (will do seasonal berry for future).  I used about 8 slices of bread per pan (vs 6) at LEAST 1 inch thick is a must as well, and liked having these individual servings when flipping and plating.  I also like the idea of using a Frenc

I made this today for an afternoon snack.  I didn't have any french bread, so I used regular loaf bread and left the crusts on.  I didn't soak it overnight, just prepared it and stuck it in the oven.  After it was done, I cut it into slices and inverted it onto a serving platter so the brown sugar would be on top.  It turned out delicious.  No need to sit in the fridge overnight if you were pressed for time like me.  Thanks Sandi.

This was very good and scores extra points for easiness!  I had no problem with sogginess, I really think the key is to use stale bread (mine was 2 days old).
Mine turned out a bit eggy, but I think maybe that was my fault - I didn't beat the eggs enough.  But it was pretty and fluffy when it was finished.  Still, I'm considering cutting out one of the eggs the next time I make it.
I did make some changes though.  I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and only 1 tblsp of corn syrup.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness.  I didn't bother to remove the crust from the bread.  It's not necessary.
Also, to all of those people who are leaving out the Grand Marnier, you are missing the point... the orange flavor is what gives this its Creme Brulee taste!  As for me, I decided to use 1/2 tsp. of orange extract instead and that did the trick for me.  Just a hint of citrus, much like Creme Brulee.
I cooked it for about 37 minutes and it came out perfectly.  It was a practice run for a shower brunch I'm throwing, & I'll definitely leave it on the menu.

Fantastic! Not soggy at all.  Have made this recipe a few times and is always perfect.  The Carmel that forms on the bottom is SO good.  I altered it a bit, insted I used French bread, left out the Brandy and used milk rather than half and half.

I made this for my daughter's Christening brunch and it got rave reviews from children and adults alike.  I used less expensive triple sec for the orange flavor, still tasted wonderful.  Will make again and again!

I took the advice of the most helpful reviews, and this turned out absolutely amazing. I cut the eggs to 4, the half & half down to 1 cup, added orange zest, flipped and broiled to carmelize the sugar after cooking. I sliced my French bread about an inch and a half thick, which I think made a big difference in the overall texture. It came out crispy on top, tender in the middle, and soggy nowhere. I've never liked French toast until now: this is a keeper! I also sprinkled it with cinnamon  - what can I say - I'm a traditionalist.

Over the years I have tried many different recipes for oven baked French toast.  This is BY FAR, the best recipe!  I now make this for Christmas brunch as well as several other special occassions (bridal & baby showers).

Couple of things I do differently:
-I left out the brandy (didn’t have any on hand)
-Instead of using French Bread, I used a loaf of country white bread or cinnamon  bread with the crust cut off.   To make it thick, I had two layers of bread (I’ve also used 3 layers and put “stuff” between the layers…cream cheese w/ jam, etc…).   I put the brown sugar mixture down first (as it says in the directions), then a layer of bread, I poured about a cup of the milk/egg mixture on top to wet the bread, another layer of bread & milk/egg mixture, and the final layer of bread and the rest of the milk/egg.   I let it set about 12 hours in the refrigerator.   It made a FULL 9x13. 

-I’ve also substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup.

Very good and easy. I used a smaller loaf of french bread so had 18 slices in the pan. Next time I would cut the bread in 1/2 inch slices. They absorbed too much of the egg/milk mixture so the top half of the bread was dryer than I would like.

Made this for a Mother's Day brunch because creme brulee is my Mom's favorite dessert.  It was very easy to set up and my family loved it.  I followed other reviewer's advice and used less sugar and flipped it over and broiled the "carmel" sidefor 3 minutes  to get it crunchy like the dessert.  Big hit.

My family and I loved this french toast (even my picky two year old!)!  I made some small changes as suggested by other reviewers:  I left the crust on the bread (I used italian b/c my store was out of french bread so I did use 6 slices) and I only used 4 eggs.  I soaked each piece of bread in egg/half and half mixture for a minute each side and then just poured the leftover mixture over the entire pan.  I did not cook butter/brown sugar/corn syrup, I just mixed sugar into melted butter. It seemed a little gritty to me, so next time I will make sure to fully dissolve the brown sugar before I pour it into the pan.  After baking I also flipped them over and put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes (I used a metal pan, NOT a glass one) I highly recommend doing this, it seemed to caramelize/thicken the glaze.  This tasted great!!

After reading numerous reviews I modified the recipe just a bit to reduce the brown sugar, add cinnamon, going with maple syrup, leaving the crust on the French bread, reducing the egg count and broil glazed side up after baking. It was easy and worth the wait overnight in the fridge. 
Modified Ingredients:  
6 TBS unsalted butter 
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 ½ TBS maple syrup  
6 (1 ½ inch thick) slices of French bread cut on a diagonal 
4 large eggs  
1 1/4 cups half-and-half 
1 tsp vanilla extract  
1 tsp orange liqueur (Grand Marnier®, Triple sec, or orange extract)  
1/4 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp cinnamon

I cut the bread into 1" cubes, used skim milk instead of half and half, and omitted the brandy. Instead of pouring the egg mixture over the bread cubes, I stirred them all together in a bowl until the bread was all coated, eliminating the need for the flipping suggested by some reviewers. The only problem I had was it took about 10 minutes longer to bake -- after the suggested time, it just looked like soggy bread in a pan. I decided to leave it in for a little while to try to get a golden brown color to make it more appetizing. After 10 more minutes it had puffed up beatifully, was a lovely golden brown and was cooked through.

This recipe was AMAZING!!  I made it for some picky eaters too and even they couldn't get enough.  I do make two changes to the recipe each time... I substitute maple syrup for the corn syrup and sprinkle cinnamon on the top before baking.  Also, when making it for people that are watching their fat and calories, I substitute egg beaters for the eggs and either milk or fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the regular 1/2 & 1/2.  Having made this for 3 different groups now, and getting all rave reviews, I am confident in highly recommending this recipe.

I have been making this exact same recipe for 13 years.Its my favorite holiday &  for that special company breakfast dish. I love that it can be made ahead and it can sit over night. Everyone loves it & wants the recipe. I use more eggs per 13 by 9 pan and its not eggy at all. I wish  my grocery stores carried bricohe bread, but they don't,so I use that extra thick french toast bread in pkg and works fine. I squeeeze the bread slices in and get about 8 in a pan over the syrup before I pour  the egg liquid over  the top. I use  grand marnier & I use more than called for - its a keeper recipe for sure!

Not sure what happened, or what I did wrong?  I follwed the directions to a T and even cut the toast 1.5 inches thick. They were super soggy in the middle and really dry on top. The bottom of the pan literally had egg on it.  My boyfriend couldn't even eat them (he loves french toast), and I ended up throwing mine away too. I would love to make this right, especially since it's probably user-error on my part. if someone has any tips. please let me know! It seems like the flavor was right, but consistency was not...

Wow! Absolutely Delicious! I made some adjusments due to lack of ingredients and now I will continue to make it like that.

I didn't have half and half...instead I used Egg Nog! Delicious and perfect Christmas Substitution.

Didn't have brandy used orange juice instead...still tasted great don't know if brandy would have made a difference.

Didn't use french bread, used butter white bread instead.

Try this recipe and enjoy! Also I didn't prepare overnight, I coated the bread with the sugar mixture on both side and let it sit in the EggNog, egg, and orange juice mixture for 15 minutes. Cooked french toast on the stove top and then cook the left over Egg Nog Mixture seperately and put ontop of French Toast. It was divine.

I think that making sure that the bread is cut to 1 inch thickness and leaving the crusts on the bread helps to soak up just enough of the liquid.  Very rich and very sweet, this was a real hit after a teen slumber party!

This was soooo good! I used cinnamon mini crossiants cut in half. The croissants have cinnamon sugar and walnuts in the middle so because they are already sweet I cut the brown sugar in half, it was perfect! Thanks SANDIPANTS ♥

This is my all time favorite breakfast recipe. I cook breakfast once a week for smy husband and some of his friends and they never leave any leftovers. I do leave the crust on and have no complaints:)

Delicious,I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast, it is very easy to prepare the night before. I left the crust on and substituted Amaretto for the orange brandy, turned out terrific! Very creamy

Made this for our Easter breakfast. The egg mixture did not soak into the bread enough (I think I should've soaked the bread before putting it on top of the sugar sauce). It still tasted good but would've been better if the bread was not so dry. Definitely will try again!

Excellent!  I accidentally left the crusts on the bread and was glad I did.  It needed the crust or it would have been too soggy.  I also added a touch of cinamon and it was fantastic.  I didn't need the full 40 minutes.  The toast was toasted after only 35 minutes.  I didn't have orange brandy so I used an orange liquer instead and it was still great.

Excellent Recipe!  Great with baguettes!
Bake until slightly toasty on top and then turn onto serving tray or cookie sheet when you remove it from the oven.  If you cook it too long, the carmel gets hard.

Incredibly good.  Lots of teaks (as is usual for me). Left the crusts on the bread, used leftover french and challah, cut about an inch thick. I used 4 eggs instead of 5, 1 cup half n half and 1/2 cup whole milk.  And I had no orange liqueur so I upped the vanilla to a Tbl.  Also used salted butter so I omitted the salt.  I have no doubt the recipe is exceptional as written, I just went with what I had on hand.   I will absolutely make this again.

I've had better baked french toast with richer flavor and better carmalized base, but overall the ease of this recipe is worth sacrificing a bit of flavor.  I prepared this the night before as instructed and simply baked for my overnight guests before they woke.  Give it a try!

Oh, my goodness!  I have made this several times, and it comes out perfect every time!  I keep looking for occasions to invite people over for brunch just so I can justify the pure indulgence!  I have yet to have a guest leave without asking for this recipe.  Once or twice I have left the crusts on, and no one cares!  Thanks, Sandi.  You have made Sundays very special for the fam.  PS:  I keep forgetting to buy orange brandy, and it is still fabulous.  One of these days, I'll try it with the brandy

I've made this many times - the men at the church breakfast go wild for it. The only thing I changed was to use maple syrup instead of corn syrup and added almond extract instead of Grand Marnier. This one's a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This was great! A comination of custard and french toast! I used texas toast white bread with the crusts cut off and left them out to dry for an hour or so. I'd use one less egg next time. If you want the bottom of your pan coated in that nice syrup/toffee mix, then you should use the stated amounts of butter and brown sugar. I baked for 20 min. and then broiled until browned on top. My wife who was about go jogging tried a mouthful and almost cancelled her running plans. But when she got back, she ate 2 pieces! Keeps well warmed in the oven on low heat. Nice recipe for company.

Call me Sherlock.  I just made this for my family, and contrary to most reviews, mine turned out dry on the top.  It didn't  totally ruin the dish though, after baking, I flipped each piece over in the pan so the tops were moist--and the flavor was wonderful.  The important thing is that it made me realize why there were so many varying degrees of success with this recipe:  It's not that there are too many eggs or too much milk or anything faulty with the recipe.  It's the bread.  I'm reading that some have used  pre-sliced sourdough--I know the bread, and it's MAYBE 1/2" thick.  The bread/liquid ratio is off, leaving a soggy, soupy mess.  Others are using roughly 1 to 1-1/4" slices with great success.  Me?  I LOVE big, fat slices of French bread for my French toast, so I cut my slices at least 2" thick, making the bread to liquid ratio off again, only in the opposite direction.  Mine was dry.  To make matters worse, I had company for the weekend and wanted to make sure that I had enough French toast to serve for breakfast, so I squished and squeezed and pushed and pinched every slice of an entire loaf of bread into my 9"x13"--until I thought it was going to spring up and hit me in the face.  Rookie move!  I should have known better, but after enjoying the beautiful flavor of the dish, I know now that I can have my 2" giant slices, I just need to adjust the liquids to accommodate that preference.  I may have to make it 2 mo

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and it was a great success!! Believe it or not I used Texas toast because every store was out of both french and italian. I left it sit out for about a day and a half to dry out. I also used maple syrup in place of corn syrup, decreased brown sugar to 3/4 cup, one less egg and turned the toast over half way through. I did sprinkle a touch of cinnamon. Mostly for coloring not taste. Dangerous to put broiler on with glass baking dish. Anyhow, it was a huge success and everyone raved on about the dish!! This goes into the books!!

This Recipe is awesome! We make this for special occasions and it's always a hit. I like to flip the toast an hour or two before I bake it so the caramel will cover the bread. I've done this with sour dough and brioche, and both were fantastic!

I loved this recipe and only made a few minor changes. I halved the recipe, used two eggs (rather than 2 1/2), swapped Triple Sec for the Grand Marnier, and used as many slices of bread as would fit in an 8x8 square pan (I think it was 5), with the crusts left on. I'm normally indifferent to sweet breakfast foods, but this was so rich and delicious, it was almost like eating dessert for breakfast. Definitely on the "make again" list!

Mmmm this was sooo delicious. I did make a few changes: I did NOT take the crusts of the bread. It gave some stability to it while it was soaking. I also bought a whole loaf of French bread and cut it myself so I could get nice big slices. I took some other reviewer's suggestions and added orange zest and some of the juice (made it EXTRA delicious) and substituted real maple syrup for the corn syrup. I don't have corn syrup and it just made sense.  This was a really delicious breakfast but it IS VERY RICH (which is really why it's such a treat). You don't need syrup for the top and I would suggest serving it with some fruit and breakfast meat on the side. I think that if you were to completely fill up on this french toast, you may have a tummy ache later.

This was amazing!! The best thing I've ever made. My family wouldn't have believed I made it if they hadn't watched me prepare it Christmas Eve. Then we put it in the oven Christmas morning.  What a treat.  We used Challah bread from our neighborhood bakery, it absorbed the cream better than using French Bread, the texture was wonderful. I sprinkled the top with Cinnamon sugar before baking. It rose nicely.  Sorry, but I've claimed this recipe as mine :)

Like the taste, but I think I need to work on the caramel topper. It turned out too chewy. Not sure what I did wrong. My husband thought it was a bit too sweat for breaskfast, but the kids liked it. It would be great to make for company since you can make it ahead of time and just pop in the over.

Absolutely delicious!  I was very nervous about making this because I wanted something special to serve to my son and daughter-in-law for brunch.  Both of them attended Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in Paris and work as chefs.  Well, we all loved this!  I used a 2-day-old loaf of grocery store French bread and left on the crusts.  I sliced it into about 1"-1 1/2" slices.  I didn't get this made the night before because, quite frankly, I was exhausted from holiday activities that day.  So, I mixed it up in the morning, soaking each slice of bread in the egg batter before cramming as many as I could into the 13 X 9 pan.  I poured what was left of the batter over the slices, and let it all sit in the refrigerator for about an hour. Before baking, I sprinkled on a little cinnamon.  I flipped the slices over to serve with the yummy caramel syrup on top.  I thought this was perfect as written, but I may try some other reviewers suggestions in the future for variety, such as mixing chopped pecans in with the syrup mixture or using maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  It was excellent served with sausage links and fresh fruit.

I made this for Christmas brunch and I can't remember when I've gotten more compliements about something I made.  I used sliced Hawaiian bread and no Grand M. (didn't have any) and flipped it over on a platter when it came out of the oven.  It even sat out and got cold and everyone still loved it.  I paid attention to the reviews and made sure to not overcook. I will definitely make again. Thanks for the receipe!

HOLY SMOKES!  This was yummy- VERY rich.  We had this Christmas morning and didn't eat again until dinner.  My husband is a french toast guy AND creme brulee is his fave dessert.  He absolutely loved it.  I was surprised that he got thirds because it was so filling.  I made it with challah bread and our own orange brandy.  We didn't want to spend $35 on  Grand Marnier® just for a tablespoon of it.  So we bought a $8 bottle of regular brandy, squeezed some orange and zest into it and let it sit for a few hours.  It was just as good.  I will definitely be making this again.

I was surprised I did not like this recipe considering all the great reviews.  Maybe I will try it again, but I think I did everything as directed.  Mine came out semi-soggy and the caremalized part was just gummy and sticky.  Overall, a big disapointment.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I use slices of french bread and leave the crust on. Very easy to prepare the night before.  Bake till top is toasted.  My friends and family make me make this all the time.

This recipe was great! I used regular milk it was all i had, and added a big dollop of sour cream, also used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, I also added about 1/4 cup of baileys.  Put it in the fridge in the morning and had it five hours later for lunch. 
Absolutely Fantastitc!  I didn't use orange liqiure, but I did add 2 T of Blood Orange Olive Oil from "Olive Us"... and it added just that extra layer of flavour! wonderful! We will make this our new Sunday company dish!

Yes, it is more like dessert for breakfast, but what's wrong with that once in a while? You don't eat this every day and it really is a holiday morning/special occasion time saver. I used day old challah bread (it has a wonderful rich flavor)and tore it into cubes, crust and all and sprinkled the top with cinnamon. It made for nice, square, even portions that were much easier to cut and serve. I also spread a small amount of butter over the top when it came out of the oven. Certainly not necessary, but it made it glisten.

I may have already rated this but I keep coming back to it so it is worth two sets of five stars!  My kids ask for this now for every special breakfast and are disappointed if I don't make it.  One thing I do is after putting the slices of bread in the pan, I cut up extra slices to fit in the gaps so it is pretty much completely filled.  I go heavy on all the ingredients to compensate and it always turns out amazingly delicious!

Wow!! my family loved this. I had to tweak due to not having a lot of the ingredients.
1 used reg milk with 4 oz of cream cheese (we didn't have cream)
2 we used ameretto because we don't like orange.
3. I only soaked it for half an hour, because I didn't read the instructions right the first time .( I wouldn't skip this step, if you don't have to, but it's still pretty tasty if you do)

Turned out GREAT!!!

Excellent french toast recipe. This was super easy and the brandy really did add good flavor. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and used maple syrup in place of the corn syrup. I also only used 4 eggs to reduce the egginess that others had mentioned. I had no problem with mine sticking to the pan either. I topped mine with a little cinnamon and powdered sugar with a dollop of whipped cream. My kids like it sweet :)

I'm sorry I thought this recipe was awful.  I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out to be this sticky gooey mess.  My husband wouldn't even try it.  I had only one slice of the toast and found it to be really soggy and very sticky.  It was more like a hard, sticky carmel sauce on the bottom then a custard like creme brulee.  Sorry just not the recipe for me.

I'm giving this a four just because it was really too sweet with the caramel sauce on the bottom (and I am a self-proclaimed sugar fanatic). The overall taste was very good though.  The Grand Marnier was undetectable and I would probably not bother with it next time, unless I added some orange zest or something to highlight the orange flavor. It was great to be able to make this the night before. I didn't have any sogginess problems that other people complained about. As long as you use day old (I used 2 day old) bread, you will be fine. Everyone at my brunch loved this and most people had seconds. Except for the sweetness, this did not taste as heavy as I was expecting it to considering the ingredients, which pleasantly surprised me. Overall the taste was great and made the house smell heavenly.

I wanted to love this recipe but it turned out way too soggy.  I followed other recommendations of flipping the bread halfway through the baking and even reduced the amount of eggs.  The flavoring was fantastic (otherwise I'd only give it 2 stars) but I just can't see myself making it again because it was just so soggy.

This is the best french toast recipe around!  We love the carmel that is formed at the bottom that makes this recipe taste so good!  It is easy and I don't trim the crusts, they are the best part!
A true favorite.

First I made it and it came out perfect! I used whole milk as I didn't have half-n-half and omitted the liquor (I hate Grand Marnier!). Perfect caramel bottom-which when flipped onto the plate looks like a creme caramel. The inside was a perfect custard texture.

Wow, this was so delicious. I made a double batch and used a big disposable aluminum pan. One whole loaf of slightly stale Italian bread (12 1 inch slices) fit perfectly. I cut back a bit on the brown sugar and used natural maple syrup instead of corn syrup as other reviewers suggested. I flipped them over half way through and broiled them for the last couple minutes. ( Be careful not to let them burn!) I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.

I've been making this for years!!  I used homemade challah and it was outrageous!!  I didn't remove the crust because it was delicious bread.  I also left out the Gran Marnier and it was totally eaten so   I don't think it's  a critical ingredient.

There wasn't a lot of flavor. A lot of people said it's too sweet. The caramel layer is, of course, plenty sweet. The egg mixture, however, needs sugar, and cinnamon (or something to give it depth). Also, I would agree it's not really French toast. It's more like bread pudding. It's OK but not worth the calories and carbs. With the tweaking I mentioned, it might be worth it.

I made it with 4 eggs and about 3/4 cups brown sugar as suggested.  No need for syrup and it was delicious!  It is easy to put together so I'll make it for Christmas morning for sure now. I didn't have half and half but I had heavy whipping cream so I used a cup of that and half a cup of milk.  I also used normal bread slices.  I ended up using 8 slices.  Two of them were cut into smaller pieces and squeezed into every possible area in the pan!   It turned out well.  I did skip the orange liquor but next time I'll be sure to put orange extract to make it taste more like my favorite dessert as others have suggested.  Thank you so much for this recipe:).

All I can say is WOW!  This was sooo delicious.  I made it this morning for Valentines Day - and I'll certainly be making this again.  I made it exactly as written - with just a bit more bread (whatever would fit in the dish).  Yummy!

I made this for a brunch that I hosted, and there was a fight over who would get to have the last piece! :) Excellent, easy, and a crowd-pleaser.  As suggested, I decreased from 5 eggs to 4 and it was plenty enough.  I was unable to find a French loaf, so I went with an Italian loaf with superb results. I was able to get 8 thick slices from my loaf and they fit in the dish just fine. If you do not have Grand Marnier or do not wish to use alcohol, you can substitute with orange extract (I did!) and it was perfect. Instead of corn syrup, I used pure maple syrup.  So easy to just prepare in advance (and it is quick!) and it's ready for the oven in the morning.

My family and neighbors LOVE this recipe. I make it at least once a month and my family loves it. I make sure to always take some to my elderly neighbor because it's one of her favorites. There's three minor things I do differently...
1. I leave the crust on. I like the crunch that it has.
2. I never have orange liqueur but I do always have oranges. I zest and juice one and that seems to work great.
3. I omit the corn syrup completely. The recipe is great without it.

I have made this recipe for my family's Christmas brunch for the past 10 years. This year I tried a different apple cinnamon one and was told if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will continue to make this one! You can find the Grand Marnier in the tiny "airport size" bottles at the local party store. Don't skip that part it does make a difference. We heat up syrup and serve that on the side for anyone who wants it a little sweeter. Great recipe!

I love this recipe!!!!!!! Once you start eating it, you can't stop!! Turned out great without the liqueur. I wasn't sure what the "6 french bread" meant but I used 1 whole wheat baguette and didn't remove the crust. I used all the recipe ingredients as listed and I cut the bread into cubes. As it bakes in the oven, just make sure you flip the bread pieces over to make sure it cooks out evenly.

I made this exactly according to the recipe. No one in the family liked it. The kids tasted it and wouldn't finish it.

This recipe was delicious but I had issues with the bread being soggy after baking it for 45 minutes.  Next time I make this, I will cut my bread under an inch thick, and I don't think I will let it chill over night. As substitutions, I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and I used orange flavoring instead of the liqueur and it still tasted great!

I know that I made this correctly and it was awful. This shouldn't even be called French Toast... as it's not a true FT recipe... more like a sweet "strata". The sugar content was disgustingly high and all of the fat in it is not nearly worth the the calories... unless it was actually fabulous & divine. The bread was uneatably (don't think that's a word) soggy and I basically told my family that they were eating yogurt & fruit for breakfast. I will never attempt to make this again... I have no clue why so many people like it. If you still choose to make this, be sure to use all 5 eggs, possibly 6 and be prepared to cook it for longer... more like 45 minutes. I don't think the half & half added much so I would use whole milk instead.

I went to a brunch where my friend made this. It was the hit at the brunch! I asked her for the recipe and she sent me this link. I didn't have any french bread on hand but a whole bag of french toast bread I bought at Vons/Safeway. I figured, I'd give that a shot. I followed the recipe except for the grand marnier. I just omitted it all together. The french toast was a hit when I made it! Everyone loved it and begged for more. It's an easy recipe and I'm glad I made it! I was asked to make it again the next morning because it was that good! I did change the recipe to 1 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of reduced milk. It was still great and decadent. My boyfriend said this is the new  heaven for him. (he refers to amazing food as heaven!)

This recipe is ideal just the way it is.  If you are pressed for time, don't leave it in the fridge overnight, but you are missing much of what makes this recipe special.  I did not have grand marnier but did have some orange juice and orange zest.  was able to re-create the flavor with this. This is one of the best recipes I have found!  Thanks!

I've been making this for years, and every birthday when my 5 kids get to choose what dinner they want, they always pick this. I've used Texas Toast and cut it into smaller pieces so it makes a bigger pan of goodies, and easier to eat.

This recipe is great as written, however I now make it with challah bread.  I cube the bread -  it makes for easier serving.  This is the most requested Christmas brunch recipe.  I think my friends and family would be in an uproar if they didn't have it on Christmas morning.  When I make it throughout the year, my kids will get up early and come over just to have it.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

This is a great recipe - we love it. I made a couple of modifications - once the French toast is finished cooking, flip the individual pieces over and put it under the broiler to crisp it up - keeps it from being soggy and makes it more like creme brulee. I also toast sliced almonds separately and use that as a topping once the baking is complete. It's great with different toppings served on the side - cinnamon apples or sweetened strawberries are great with it. We don't remove the crusts, and it still comes out fabulously. This one is definitely a keeper. Bacon makes a great complement to the sweetness.

WOW! This was great!! I used challah bread instead, used only 4 eggs, fat free half&half and milk, and Splenda Brown sugar. Trying to make it a little more healthy ;).I also have a non stick cake pan and it worked beautifully!! No mess at all! My husbands loves this recipe and if it wasn't so high in calories, I'll be making it everyday.

This recipe was delicious as part of our family brunch. We ate it along with ham, fried salmon, quiche, and fresh veggies and fruit. Everyone loves it and it's a special request now. I substituted the corn syrup for a mixture of sugar, water, and cream of tartar.

I thought this was really good recipe since I am not a huge fan of french toast.My only complaint, is it was really really sweet. I think it was the brown sugar/syrup bottom that made my teeth hurt. My suggestion: cut down 1 tablespoon of syrup and do 3/4 or 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

I am testing out brunch recipes for the party I am going to have New Year's Eve and this is the first I tried out.  My husband and I agree that it is no more than 3 stars - he says because it is way too sweet, and I say because it is too eggy...and I even reduced the eggs to 4 as suggested in the reviews.  It makes a very pretty presentation though once inverted and the carmelized top is exposed.  I would say if you don't mind the sweetness (which I don't) reduce the eggs to 3, and follow everything else to the letter, it will make a very good (and it is very easy to prepare!) breakfast treat.

You definitely need to adhere to the recipe when it says the bread needs to be thick.  For me, the flavor was great but I cut the bread too thin and it was soggy.  I will try it again and follow the directions....

Doesn't look like much at first but, flip it over and you see that beautiful glaze. Loved the custard texture. I can't believe some of these reviews were bad. One person said they didn't like the custard texture. Did they not know what creme brulee was?

Very good, cook for 40 mins, and then put oven to 425 and cook till toast Browns.  I also used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and only 4 eggs. Also use 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup.

This was definitely something I'll make again. Made a couple substitutions. Read reviews about reducing brown sugar and eggs. Used only 4 eggs and 3/4 cup brown sugar, also didn't have half and half so I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup skim milk. Substituted orange liquor with Parrot Bay coconut rum. Cooked at 350 but last five minutes increased temp to 405. Also baked right after I made it. This was fantastic

OMG!  This is not your usual French Toast.  This is just plain sinful and so good. Make sure your bread is thick and a day old very tasty.  Put a little powdered sugar on top when serving then place strawberries on the side of the plate plate.  I have no idea how many calories but who cares!

Delicious.  I made a lower cal version that was very good.  Used sourdough bread with crust on, Splenda mix brown sugar, salted butter (and then did not add more salt), 1/2 cup nonfat milk and 1/2 cup half and half, sugar free maple syrup instead of the corn syrup, and 4 eggs.  I definitely agree with those who say 5 eggs and 1 1/2 cup half and half is too much liquid.  I was not able to get the topping crunchy like a creme brûlée even though I did flip it and put it under the broiler as many suggested.  It may be due to using the Splenda brown sugar, which requires only 1/2 cup.  All in all a great dessert and a keeper.

We liked this a lot and it was great that I could assemble it the night before.  For those who said that they don't like the custardy consistency.  Crème Brulee IS a custard, so that is what you should have expected.  It is sweet and you kind of need to serve some kind of protein with it such as bacon or sausage.  It's a great breakfast for the crowd who spends the night after a party or on Christmas or New Years morning.

I loved it!  It tastes really good with maple syrup instead of corn syrup and a dusting of cinnamon on top.

i dont understand all the great reviews.  I understood before making this that it would be more like bread pudding than true french toast, which was fine.  however the flavor just did not work for me.  First of all there is way too much sugar, almost inedible.  Also for me there were too many eggs because the egg flavor was overpowering.  I'm extremely disappointed in this recipe.

This is a tasty dish and easy to make.  For my personal tastes it was too sweet, but my boyfriend loved it.  If you're expecting a french toast texture, you'll be surprised.  It is more like a custard (doh-creme brulee).

This recipe makes a wonderfully rich french toast. We make it every year for Christmas brunch. I double the Grand Marnier and put it together the night before so that all I have to do is put it in the oven on Christmas morning.

I followed the recipe as written and was severely disappointed. It was more the consistency of a bead pudding than any kind of french toast and the flavor wasn't even all that good, not at all creme brulee like. I even tried to brown these in a frying pan after pulling them out of the oven and seeing how soggy they were, it didn't help. My husband and I both had a half of a slice and threw the rest away. Glad I decided to try it myself before making it for company. I definitely won't make this again.

Great receipe.  I did follow everyone else's advice with only 1 tbsp of corn syrup, 3/4 brown sugar and 4 eggs instead of .  Turned out great.  My picky eater even loved it!

Very good!  I did leave out one egg, left the crust on the bread, and used less corn syrup.  I also used triple sec instead of grand marnier.  Everybody loved it!  I agree that the littlt bit of orange flavor adds a lot.

We loved this baked French toast.  I did use maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Next time think I will cube the bread.  This recipe seems fool proof.

This was good, although not the best overnight french toast recipe I've tried.  I wasn't sure what "6 French bread" meant, so I just used an entire loaf and I did not cut the crusts off.  I guess I'm not used to the "topping" being on the bottom of the dish, which left the top rather dry.

Excellent...though I didn't remove the crust (I like the crust) and see why you may want to: so the egg/milk mixture can seep in. If you don't remove the crust then you'll probably want to try 'basting' the bread every couple hrs or so with the mixture so it gets good and soaked. Oh and I didn't use the liqueur, I didn't have any, just used a bit more vanilla. Tasty!

this is the most amazing quick breakfast.  We are snowmobilers, and we make this the night before we go out.  while everyone is showering, breakfast is baking.  It works out well.  The second time that I made this I used cinnamon raisin bread.  It was yummy and I will use it again.

EXCELLENT!  Followed the recipe but did not add the brandy, instead added 2 teaspoons of vanilla (instead of 1) and dipped each bread slice (crust removed) into the egg mixture before adding to pan - poured remaining mix over the casserole.  Next time I will add chopped nuts of some sort to the bottom of the pan with the brown sugar mixture, then top with bread!  I also baked with foil on pan for 30 minutes and then removed foil for 15 minutes - came out great!  Not too hard, not too soft.

This recipe was great.  Even my ultra picky eater husband loved it.  One drawback: the creme part is a bit too eggy.  Next time I fix this I will try reducing the eggs to 2-3 instead of the 5.  I also only chilled it for about an hour before baking.  Still turned out great.

I had a similar recipe that used brioche bread (crustless) and it really puffs up.  To cut the sweetness, serve with fresh blueberries or strawberries.

Ver quick and easy to make. I am not sure if I made it right but it comes out soggy with the egg mixture just baked. It would have been good if the whole thing was kind of toasted. Good flavorings though!

I would give it 50 stars if I could.  I used the Texas toast from Safeway (crust left on) & the 3/4 c brown sugar, 1 Tbsp corn syrup suggestion & it was perfection.  I could only fit 6 pieces of Texas Toast in the 13x9 pan.  I also sprayed the pan with non stick spray before adding the brown sugar mixture & everything released well from the pan & was beautiful & caramelly (is that a word?)

Great recipe, very well received.  Followed advice of other people and filled the pan with bread,  used 4 eggs, used 2 tbs of grand mamarnier.  Instead of flipping during baking, I poured 1/2 the butter mixture on the bottom of the pan and the other 1/2 on top of the bread.  Great recipe and suggestions - thank you!

Have to add my five stars to this - bread pudding has never done well in the family, but this one got gobbled up (one piece leftover; I was told it was just as good when reheated). Did leave out the salt as I had only salted butter; subbed orange zest for the liqueur. Did not cut the crusts off the bread. Thanks so much - we'll enjoy this many times!

I peeled and slice apples on top of the brown sugar. Everything just melts in you mouth! Great for when all 4 of my daughters are home with their families..easy make ahead and breakfast is a breeze. I have also had it with sausage lunks cooked and extra grease taken off then layered in pieces on top of brown sugar!

This was delicious! I made this for Christmas morning brunch along with the Breakfast Pizza recipe from this site and everyone loved this. I did follow a few of the suggestions and cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup. Also, since I didn't have any orange liquer on hand I used about 1/2 tsp. of orange flavoring. This added just a hind of orange flavor. Overall a very easy recipe that everyone enjoyed.

A huge hit for Christmas morning, and it was super easy to prepare the night before.  I gave it 4 stars only because of the alterations I made based on the other reviews.  I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  I used 4 eggs and 8 slices of French bread and kept the crusts on.  I will definitely make it again!

Amazing, I used cinnamon swirl bread sliced 1/2 inch thick and don't use any Grand Marnier.  I spread  the brown sugar/ butter mixture over the bottom of my pan added a layer of cinnamon bread poured 3/4 of the egg mixture over the bread, layered another layer of bread &  poured the remaining egg mixture over the bread and followed the rest of the recipe as suggested. Was so delish one of the woman who enjoyed it laughing told me it was better than sex!

I made this and put it in the oven right away - no problems.  I substituted honey for corn starch, and some baileys and whiskey for the orange liquor.  I put 8 slices of regular wheat multigrain sliced bread (with crust on) in two layers in an 8"x8" pan.  I flipped over the bread at the halfway point of 20 minutes.  Not soggy or too egg-y.  Delicious!

This was SO easy and a big hit with everyone at our family gathering!
A few changes: leave out the corn syrup; add cinnamon to the egg mixture; substitute fresh orange zest for the Grand Marnier and add fresh orange zest to the egg mixture or layer between the sugar/butter and the bread; for a double recipe, use a pint of 1/2 & 1/2 plus 1 Cup of milk.    Definitely slice the bread a day or 2 ahead and let it dry out.  We had no need to flip the bread during baking.  A bit more of the butter and sugar mix would be good.  Enjoy!

Looked at many of the reviews and then made the recipe exactly as is. Exceptions: left the crust on the fresh grocery store variety french loaf, added some cinnamon spice mix to the top of the dish before baking. Baked it up to the forty minutes or so. The last few minutes of baking the whole casserole began to puff up beautifully!Didn't turn the bread or broil anything. A wonderful rich sauce formed on the bottom. The bread slices were moist on the inside and the crusts added a little bit of crispiness to the dish.Looked just like the picture. Rave reviews from husband, granddaughter and self on the taste.No improvements necessary for taste. Because of the calories however, this will be a special occasion dish. Very easy to prepare the evening before and that's very important.

Different, easy, and awesome!  Used what I had (regular white sliced bread) and didn't have time to bake it so I just mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and dipped in the bread for a minute or two.  Then fried in it butter on the stove top on low until it was browned on both sides.  Very nice change for breakfast - but very sweet too and rich too.  A little goes a long way!

A little too sweet for me, but my family loved it.  I think if I make it again, I'll cut the butter and brown sugar in half for the bottom layer.

This was delicious, but very sweet.  Be sure to pair it with some bacon or sausage.  Also, better fresh and warm.  Not quite as good as leftovers.

Delicious! I have made this multiple time with various types of breads. I did'nt like the layer of egg that forms with 5 eggs so I decrease to 3 or 4. This is very sweet, perfect with fresh fruit and coffee.

This is sooo delicious! I cut the sugar and cornsyrup in half and used low fat half and half, it was a huge hit. I also doubled the Grand Marnier and used Kings Hawaiian bread leaving the crust on.

WOW!  This is amazing.  I left most everything the same, but I did leave the crusts on the bread, added cinnamon to the top and a little extra orange liqueur.  And it's now my FAVORITE breakfast recipe. 
If you like Creme Brulee you'll love this recipe!

Since I was cooking for two, I cut the recipe in half. I used the recommended reduced brown sugar amount, 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup (so for half a recipe I used >1/3 cup. It was the 3oz mark on my Pyrex measuring cup). To halve the eggs, I went with two since people were noting some egginess. I baked it in an 8x8 square dish, and it was so wonderful. I'd eat it everyday!

This was ok but way too sweet for my family. I cut back the brown sugar and corn syrup like others suggested and still found it too sweet. I also used 4 eggs instead of 5. I think that is a good suggestion as I did not find it too "eggy" at all this way. I also used orange extract instead of the liqueur and added some cinnamon into the egg mixture. The flavoring in the egg mix was great but brown sugar mix was too much. I don't know if I will make it again simply for the sweet factor.

I was really looking forward to eating this.  From the reviews I was expecting the brown sugar on the bottom to come out thick like the center of a cinnabon. No such luck, it just melted into a watery syrup.  I used orange extract since I didnt have the liquor.  I cut down the egg by one and it was still too eggy.  I had scrambled eggs on the bottom!  Overall the taste was good so I may attempt this again with more modifications.

I know this is a bit late, but I made this Christmas morning as it is my husband's favorite French toast recipe ever! As I was preparing hors d'ouevres for the afternoon and prepping for dinner. He (my husband) and my brother-in-law were in the fridge with forks finishing off the last bits. I guess this will be on the menu again for this coming Christmas. This is a great brunch recipe, easily doubles and triples as long as you have room for it in the fridge. I like to make a little extra syrup for serving too.

Excellent recipe! I took some of the other suggestions and cut the sugar in half. Next time I think I will add more sugar, but probably not the full cup. Also I added cinnamon and vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture, and also added cinnamon to the egg mixture. It made my house smell like Cinabon! I didn't have time to let the bread get stale, so I sliced it and then put it in a warm oven to dry out. That seemed to work just fine. There were a few soggy spots, but overall it turned out great. And the way that my over cooks I did not have to broil it at the end.

So yummy and almost licked my plate!  First time I did not let it sit, second time let it sit over night and it made the difference big time!  Great spin on French toast served at a brunch with mimosas!  What an impression I made.  Will certainly make again.

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this. I looovvve this recipe. I've been making this for the longest because we are a fan of creme brûlée. You really don't need to use the grand marnier if you're out.

This is quite good.  Very sweet, but a glance at the recipe told me it would be.  The caramel bottom is really nice, and makes for a rich and sweet treat.  I didn't use french bread bc I had stale lemon poppyseed bread and wanted to use it up.  It worked extremely well with the orange flavor.  I don't have Grand Marnier so I just used orange extract, and I improvised for the half and half with 1 cup of milk and 1/2 c of greek yogurt.  Not the same, I know, but it seemed to work well enough.  This is a  very enjoyable treat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my mother's day brunch...what a fabulous meal.  I made turkey sausage also...YUMMO.....I followed other reviewers...melting butter in microwave, adding sugar and corny syrup and stirred...I also didn't let it sit overnight....I used 4 eggs 1/2 tsp orange extract and dipped the bread before putting it in the pan.  I ate some of french bread loaf before making this dish so the pan wasn't packed tight.  I had leftovers which I warmed up at work for breakfast on Mon and Tue....everyone was so jealous...gonna use grand marnier teeny size bottle next time....can't wait to make this again....OH SO GOOD!!!!!

Very Delicious!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers.  I used only 4 eggs, was a little generous with GM, used maple syrup, added a little cinnamon on top and added about 1tsp of orange zest to the egg mixture.  I also chopped about 1/2 C walnuts and sprinkled on top of the sugar mixture.  Most importantly, I baked for about 45 minutes which was key in avoiding a sogginess.  We were having a buffet style brunch so I flipped all the pieces over in the baking dish and just set it right on the table.  It was a HUGE hit!

This was a lot of work for French Toast.  It was soggy on the bottom.  I tried cooking it longer and that didn't help.  No one in my family liked it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I only made a couple small changes.  I cut the eggs down to four (large eggs), and I left the crusts on the bread.  Other then that I followed the recipe.  The first time I made it I halved the recipe and it turned out PERFECT!  The second time I did a normal sized batch, the only issue was that some of the egg mixture made it under the bread so a couple of slices weren't the pretty carmelized color when flipped, solution, just make sure that the bread is in there tight enough to keep the egg on top and not surrounding the whole bread.  Fabulous recipe, everyone loves it!

I first made this recipe for Christmas brunch.  It was a huge hit!  I can't say enough about how easy and delicious this was.  It only took about 10 minutes to prep, then refigerated overnight and popped in the oven in the morning.  The "creme brulee" bottom makes this a fancy, almost gourmet dish.  I didn't and wouldn't change a thing.  I will continue making this over and over again.

I used challah (egg) bread for this recipe as a personal preference (cut 6 slices, 1" thick).  Per other reviews, I also cut down on the sugar a bit, used 4 eggs and left the crust on.  The crust was crispy on some slices, moist on others. I will either use 5 eggs next time or cut off the crust.  I loved the flavor and ease of the recipe.  Will be added to breakfast rotation.

wow this was very good, I did have to bake it longer then the time stated as mine wasn't very brown.  am not sure how much longer maybe about an extra 10-15 min.  I think next time I will cut the bread into cubes instead of slices, I also used egg bread verry yummy!!!!! ***UPDATE*** Made this for a friends sons birthday brunch and wow was it a big hit.  As it was to feed close to 20 odd people, here is what I did.  I cubed up a whole loaf of bread for 1 13x9 and I decided it looked like it needed more eggs so I added 2 extra eggs and a splash more cream.  Next time though I think I want to make more of the carmel sauce but overall it was still amazing, had so many people that day ask for the recipe.  the one thing to remember is to don't leave it in the pain to cool, the carmel sauce hardened and was hard to get out

I have tried numerous baked french toast recipes .. and never really cared for them.  Not the case with this one.  This one is a keeper. The "creme brulee" at the bottom is what makes the difference.  I added triple sec since I didn't have any Grand Marnier. I imagine you could use any flavored liquor. I also kept the crust on the bread.   Once I finished putting the pan together, I topped the bread with a little maple syrup.  Really good recipe, and scales down well !

This dish is a favorite! I have made it many many times and given the recipe too at least 20 others! You don't actually have t remove the crusts from the bread if it is not too hard, and I recommend packing as may slices of bread as you can into the dish- because people will want seconds! The only other adjustment I make is to double the Grand Marnier.

Great. Few changes based on others suggestions.  For less clean up melt butter and brown sugar in baking dish in micro. Put egg/ milk mixture in large measuring cup and use handheld stick blender.
Used 11X15 pan - 12 slices of bread with crust(crowded in pan.) Same amount of eggs and whole milk, 1 1/2tsp orange extract, 3/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter.  350 convection for 30 mins. Turned pieces over when finished. Crust sticks to bread instead of pan. Pan was easy clean up. Thanks for the recipe.

I had been looking for a recipe like this since my husband and I had creme brulee french toast at a really nice B&B. I made this recipe last year for a family Christmas brunch and it was so happy to have found a match! It is really rich but is so great served with some fresh fruit and a few other light sides. Can't wait to make it again this year!

I recorded the recipe based on other reviews to be 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tbs corn syrup, 4 eggs, 1 tsp liqueur, 1.5 cups half & half, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla + cin for egg mixture & cin-sugar for top. This morning I 1/4-thed the recipe b/c it was just for my husband and I. 
I used bread from a round of Hawaiian bread (not stale), did not marinate, left the crusts on (recommended b/c they get crispy & delicious while the middle stays soft!), substituted Bailey's Irish Creme for the liqueur, did not broil b/c baked in a glass dish, cooked 40 min & flipped half way through the baking. I also added cinnamon to the egg mixture & sprinkled the top with cin-sugar before baking. 
Before serving, to make it look more appetizing, I lightly sprinkled the servings with powdered sugar and served with fresh fruit. My husband is not generally a French toast fan, but he said it could go in the "make-again" file! No syrup was needed. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe cooking this for 40 minutes and it was not good. It was soggy and too sweet. It tasted like soggy scrambled eggs with syrup on them. Ewwey.

Not your mama's French toast ! I made this recipe (as written) about 6-7 years ago and it has become a Christmas morning tradition in addition to other holidays. Today is Easter Sunday and It was requested that I bring it to a family brunch so I have quadrupled the recipe. I've made it with and without crust using French bread and prefer it with the crust. It's rich and sweet and goes so well with a savory quiche and fruit on the side. Amazing.

So fabulous!  I didn't have OJ or GM, but it still turned out delicious and would be awesome for an AM get-together or brunch!

Ok - but will have to vary the bread thickness to get all of the egg mixture to soak in.  Not too sweet for us "southerns" either.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top before I baked.  I left the crust on the french bread I used - which I will do again.

After a few bites of this my husband said:  "Two words, Dee-Licious"!  We did not soak overnight, nor remove the crusts and added orange juice concentrate.  Soooo yummy!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

This was wonderful!  The only thing I changed was to cube the bread before placing in the casserole, for ease of serving.  Everyone loved it!  It is so sweet, no maple syrup was needed.  Definitely a "keeper".

This recipe was definitely yummy, but it should really be called "French Toast Flan" instead. Any cook knows that creme brulee is characterized by a crispy, burnt sugar top, and that you won't get here. I didn't have any brown sugar, so I improvised with half a package of cook and serve butterscotch pudding. This thickened the resulting syrup well. I also used a cranberry pecan bread from a French bakery. Will make again, and experiment more!

I can't believe I forgot about this recipe! I made it for Christmas brunch & it was loved by all. The only changes I made were to use croissants instead of french bread because I had some stale ones.

I used Dulce de Leche liquer instead of the Grand Marnier. I also used an Italian bread and used 10 slices.
I did no flip through cooking and thought that it still turned out fine.  Next time I absolutely will flip it out onto another tray as soon as it comes out of the oven.
This was scrumptious!!! I wish I had some now!  BTW...if you can eat more than two pieces I will be shocked...its super rich!!!

This recipe was a hit with my family.  Great to serve to our overnight guests as well.  However I did modify.  First, omited the alcohol.  Also, I dipped each slice of bread plus a few extra in the egg mixture and baked immediately. This really cut back on the french toast being soggy.

SO I didn't follow the recipe exactly...I made do with what I had, and it turned out great.  No corn syrup, found a site online that said I could substitute with white sugar, only 1/2 the amount, so that's what I did.  My butter and sugar mix turned out like carmel, not sure if it was supposed to, but it worked.  Had no Grand Marnier, so I used an extra tsp of vanilla and a little orange zest.  I also used 1 french bread baguette and did not cut the crust.  Like others suggested, after the mix sat in the fridge a couple hours, I turned the bread over.  Cooked as directed.  Turned out awesome!  Nothing was overly soggy, egg ration seemed just right.  Had no trouble with pan cleaning as others complained.  VERY rich, but delicious!

I found this good although a calorie bomb. I tried this twice and it did not look like the photo at all. There was alot of egg at the bottom but nevertheless wasn't a bad thing. I am not sure that 6 slices of bread is right. I had twelve slices and the egg mixture was still alot. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup but still felt guilty eating it (because I am diabetic).

The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 was because of how SWEET it is.  But everyone loved it, even my mother-in-law.  Also, I read ALL the other reviews and I used 4 eggs instead of 5.  I also used a 9 x 13 Pyrex baking dish.  As soon as it was done, I transferred it to the dishes for serving and while the dish was still warm, I washed out the excess and then put it in the dishwasher--CAME OUT CLEAN.  This recipe is definitely a KEEPER.

I'm wondering what I did wrong. This morning I made this recipe for some old friends that were coming over for breakfast. Based on all the reviews, I was very excited to make it. I assembled yesterday and left in the fridge overnight. I popped them in the oven this morning and after 45 minutes I removed them. They looked and smelled great! However, it all went down hill when I tried to REMOVE them from the dish. The underside of the bread was a soggy, egg mess! So..I tried flipping them with a spatula to broil (based on one reviewer) which was next to IMPOSIBLE because they were close to being permanantly stuck to the bottom of my dish. (I don't think I'll ever get that dish 100 percent clean again) When I did finally flip them I put them under the broiler to try to crisp up the egg goop...which only produced burnt edges to bread. Fortunately I had a few more minutes before they arrived to whip up my emergency back up plan of scramble eggs. I served both the eggs and the french toast with strawberries and bananas. My friends said they liked them, but I think they were only being kind. I'm giving it a three because I think they have the potential to be very good...but I will have to use less eggs for the mixture next time.

By reading other suggestions, I cut down the recipe to 3 eggs and it was still too soggy, even after cutting the bread slices thick.  Although the butter/brown sugar/corn syrup mix was a good caramel, the bread itself came out really mushy and the texture was gross.  I served it a group at breakfast and no one was thrilled with it.  I was surprised at how it turned out with so many good reviews.  Maybe I did something wrong but probably will not bother trying it again.

I made this for my best friend when she came over for Christmad presents.  All 3 of us loved it!  What I loved the most was how easy it was!  I didn't have to stand in the kitchen while they we in the livingroom.  I found bread that was already thick sliced (actually called French Toast Bread) and it worked perfectly.  Also instead of using the orange brady I used Orange extract and brandy extract.  Worked perfectly!  It was REALLY sweet and we had coffee to counteract the sweet.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I can't wait to make it again!

Here's what I did and it worked out wonderfully:
I used baguettes. I doubled the recipe and put it in a lasagna pan (I was making it for breakfast at church). I sliced the bagettes (I used 4 1/2) into 3/4 inch slices, layered them flat over the brown sugar mixture, mixed the eggs up (I used a dozen, instead of 10 like the doubled recipe called for), and didn't add the orange brandy. I let it soak in all night. I was worried at first because it had  a dry look to it. The egg was completely soaked up by the bread. But, once it was baked and had to travel for an hour even to church and then be reheated, it was delicious. Once you spooned out the pieces (smaller pieces also made it go farther), there was a wonderful suprise beneath it. Way to go!!!! Will make again and again. Everyone raved.

This was a success at a Mother’s Day brunch— however I want to caveat upfront that my  rating is based on suggested modifications I made, not the original recipe.  I made the caramel exactly as stated in the posted recipe.  I used about 3/4 of a loaf of challah cut in thick (1 inch+) slices. I cut the slices in smaller pieces to fit more in my 13x19 casserole dish and to make easier for serving a large crowd.  

For the custard, I used the recipe but added orange zest as recommended by another reviewer.  Since many reviewers noted it was too eggy, I slowly added the custard until the bread was thoroughly moistened.  That was about 2/3 of the custard.  I covered the dish and refrigerated overnight but reserved the rest of the custard separately. The next day, I added a few more spoonfuls of the custard over the bread before baking for 45 minutes.  It was PERFECT!!  Next time I make this, I would probably reduce to 3 eggs and 1 cup of half & half.  Overall, an excellent combo of flavors and no need for extra syrup.

Amazing!  I used Hawaiian sweet rolls since I had that in my pantry.  I omitted the orange liqueur since I'm not a fan.  I did as another reviewer suggested microwave to get the caramel mix.

This was much more simple than I thought.  One suggestion I have is to add some fresh berries instead of powder sugar to garnish.  This recipe is VERY sweet.  Too sweet to add more sugar for my taste.

I always have to make 2 batches at a time because it disappears so quickly. This is the most requested recipe for work potlucks. So easy to make. I usually use an electric knife to remove the entire crust from a loaf of French bread. Then I slice the bread into the required 1-inch thick-slices. The electric knife makes everything much easier. Because the bread needs to soak overnight, I just pop it in the oven while I'm getting ready for work and it's still warm when I serve it to co-workers.

AWESOME recipe. I grated some orange peel also and let it sit over night. It made the orange flavor just explode. VERY filling. My Hubby said," This is SO GOOD! I should have eaten just one." I told him," You did eat just one."

So good, and so easy!  I used pancake syrup in place of the corn syrup, because it was on hand, and I left the crust on the bread.  Followed the remainder of the recipe as written.  This is a keeper!

I love this recipe with a "FEW" changes/
1. I used a very denies 7 grain bread with crust on.
2. 1/4 cup brown sugar with 2 TB honey
3. Unsweetened almond milk ( never use regular milk or heavier) don't even have it in the house.
4. Very genius portion of Grand Marine.
Turned out very well - will make it again SOON.

So this is not really French toast.  The name is very deceiving.  French toast is a breakfast food.  This is more like bread pudding.  No shame in eating that for breakfast though.  Loved the recipe.

I made the french toast this morning.  It was a very easy recipe to follow.  The texture of the bread was wonderful after cooking.  The only complaint I have is that my brown sugar crust stuck to the pan and the custard was a bit bland for my taste.  I'm used to the burst of cinnamon.  Otherwise...a good recipe or even a base for adding to it.  Thanks for sharing.

I have tried this recipe twice and while the second time was better than the first, this is not a "simple" recipe for a novice cook.  I was served this for breakfast by a chef acquaintance and loved it but I am apparently still missing something.  The first time I made it, the bread was just downright soggy and I realized that I didn't let the bread get stale enough.  This time, I brought french bread and gave it a couple of days to get stale.  Took the suggestions regarding the brown sugar, increasing the orange liquer and using only 4 eggs.  Otherwise, I followed the directions perfectly.  I really thought I hit a homerun this time.  I filled the pan with bread and it looked like the bread had soaked up the mixture pretty well.  By the end of the cooking process, the bread was not the least bit soggy (I thought) and I was confident that I had found the holy grail of creme brulee french toast - that is until I flipped it over for browning.  The bottom was a little wet but didn't seem overly so and yet, it didn't crisp up under the broiler as others had mentioned so while everything looked like it was going well, the end result was that this still seemed eggier and a little soggier than I remember.  The flavor with the extra orange was good but not enough that I'll try again.

We loved it.  It was great for Christmas brunch.  I didn't take the crusts off and it was just fine.  The casserole does get hard on the bottom pretty quickly, so I kept it on the warm stove and served from there.

This recipe is fantastic.  Even if you follow or don't follow the recipe it's a huge hit for my family and I've been making this for Christmas Breakfast for the last few years.  I dare not stray from tradition ;)  I only came back for the ingredients for shopping today.  Instead of the french bread though I use Texas Toast and I have left the crusts on and have taken it off.  My family prefers I leave the crusts on merely because of the fact that that means there's more of it! The one thing that I do to the toast is let it sit out and become a little stale from the air or I toast it in the toaster for a little bit.  I think this helps with the sogginess that some people complain about.  But I do that for any french toast recipe.  One time I forgot to buy the half and half, so I just used milk and sour cream and blended them and it worked out fine.  The crucial part I don't change is the corn syrup and brown sugar.  That makes the perfect crunchy crust.  I do love this recipe!

I made this today gave it a a 3-star rating at best. 

I think my first mistake was cutting the brown sugar in half. I didn't get that wonderful sauce at the bottom of mine and I think that is why. Cutting she sugar to 3/4 a cup like others have done might work fine, but if I try this again, I'm going to start with the entire 1 cup (as excessively sweet as that may seem). 

I also got the eggy consistency that others have mentioned. My Mom's version didn't have this. I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing that I got this because my bread didn't completely cover the bottom of the baking dish. The next time I try this, I think I will completely cover every square inch of the dish as possible. That way the bread will absorb all of the egg mixture. 

The only other change I made (except halving the sugar and leaving the custs on) was using 1-2 tbs of orange juice instead of grand marnier because I didn't have it. 

But here is my main point: many reviewers are saying this is an easy or foolproof recipe. Perhaps if your cooking level is excellent, it is. But if your cooking level is any less than excellent, I would not experiment too much with this recipe the first time, except to leave the crusts on.  This is a recipe where technique is essential for texture.

This was pretty good and I guess I would make it again, but for a different "audience" .  I cut the amount way down as it was just for my husband and I. Being so rich we could only eat a small amount. I think this is a "girly" breakfast being so sweet. Rather like eating a giant caramel roll.  Might cut down on the brown sugar base next time and my feeling is it definitely needs a meat served with it to offset the sweet.

This is super yummy!  My mother-in-law said it was the best she has ever eaten. I didn't have half-and-half, so I substituted milk. I omitted the brandy, and it still turned out great.  Next time, will use brandy.

This was fabulous!! I made as a snack for my work collueagues and they all asked for the recipe.  I made a few changes turning it into a bread pudding, or as i called iit creme brûlée French toast casserole.  I doubled the butter, sugar and syrup, then I cut 2 loaves (3x8inch) into small cubes, poured 3 cups of half and half mixed together with 8 eggs and vanilla.  Put it in the fridge over night and baked in the morning.  There was delightful bits of crunchy caramel bread on the bottom which went perfect with the creamy top layer.

I make this all the time! My whole family loves it! I never have removed the crust or put in the liqueur (didn't have any the first time, and we all like it without it anyway). I think that next time I make it I will make some more of the syrup mixture to set aside for serving. The family fights over that part and we never have enough. LOVE this recipe.

This recipe was OK.  I followed other reviewers and decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still too sweet.  Aside from that it wasn't bad.  I used standard wheat bread including the heals.  I would NOT recommend using heals and now know why the recipe instructed to cut the crusts off; they form this tough, chewy layer.

I've made this before and love it.  Im visiting my son & his family so I was happy to find it on Allrecipes so I could fix this for them.  You probably don't need to fix this the night before as others have mentioned, but I sure do like having a leisurely morning while visiting and all you have to do is stick it in the oven.  The only change I made was to delete one of the eggs.  I like the idea of cutting back on the sugar & corn syrup & will try that next time.  But if you follow the diections, you won't be disappointed!

Delicious!!!!  Absolutely loved this to-die-for recipe!  Thank you!  Did make a few changes - 4 eggs, 6 Tabl. butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Plenty sweet enough.  Served with fresh berries and bacon.  Wonderful!  Love the make-ahead option.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. Unlike other suggestions, we kept the amount of brown sugar, but I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, halved the butter instead mixing with a little very light olive oil, didn't de-crust the bread, didn't chill overnight (this is only necessary if you're afraid to stir your bread mix!), used lemon juice instead of the brandy, and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to balance out all of the sweet. It turned out great! don't waste your time cutting crusts and chilling overnight though, I don't know why people keep saying you need this for bread puddings (I've tried both ways and it's just a waste of time!)

This is my new Christmas morning breakfast.  It was awesome.  I used evaporated milk because I didn't have half and half and it was still great.  I used maple syrup and pecans as others had suggested.  Wonderful, wonderful!

Made it this morning. Hubby and kids loved it. Of course, family has sweet tooth. I used 6 French toast bread and left the crust on. Also used 1 cup whole milk + 1/2 cup silk almonh milk. Baked for 35 mins. Came out great. Leftovers ade also good cold. Overall, a good recipe for sweet lovers!

This turned out as it was supposed to mostly but it didn't get puffy like it was supposed to. My boyfriend loved this, but we both agreed it is REALLY rich. I could only get through about a piece of it (and wont make again), though he ate the rest the next day after reheating :) Great recipe if you like decadence!

Disappointed.  Maybe I sliced the bread too thick, but it didn't soak up the egg mixture much.  The middle of the bread was still bread.  My own french bread is so awesome compared to this, I won't try this again.

Yummy, I make this often and everyone loves it. The only things that I change are adding toasted pecans to the brown sugar topping and I dip the bread in the wet mixture and drizzle a little over the top I found this makes crispier toast. Using less of the wet mixture leaves the toast perfectly soft on the inside and toasted on the outside as if it were pan grilled.

I know why people complained about the brown sugar part.  The recipe states...heat until sugar dissolves and it should state...until smooth. It is heating too long and ruining the recipe. And another thing, you should include more info. on how tight or spaced the slices of bread should be.  Loaves are all different sizes and unsure if I used enough.  I hope I am happy with it in the morning.

Exceptional!  This was just fantastic.  I made this with the french loaf and I have made it with regular bread.  Both turned out great.  Thank you for posting this delicious recipes.

This was very good, although very very sweet and rich.  I used 8 slices of French bread and did not remove the crusts.  I also only used 4 eggs, 1/2 cup half and half, almost a full cup of milk, and a splash of cream (to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid total.)  Didn't have any orange liqueur or any orange flavoring so I used a couple teaspoons of honey instead.  The custard was great.  I think next time I will probably half the caramel recipe, because it was almost too sweet for me.  I used 3/4c brown sugar, 1/4c dark corn syrup and 2 tablespoons maple-cinnamon syrup this time.  It was very good but very rich.  Baked for about 35 minutes, at which point it seemed done although the top of the bread was still pale, so I turned the broiler on for a few minutes to brown them up.  This worked great and next time I may try flipping them over to caramelize the bottoms as well.  Overall, a great recipe, will make again.

I took hints from others but one thing that I was disappointed in was that the brown sugar combo did not rise to the top.  It stayed on the bottom and was it sticky.  I had to soak the pan to get it clean.  It was yummy though; I put raspberries on top. But, what did I do wrong?  Any suggestions?

I make this for every brunch I host and it's always a HIT! I use orange flavoring in lieu of the orange liqueor and think it works nicely. I make the egg mixture the night before and I soak the bread in a ziploc bag with the contents overnight. In the morning I make the brown sugar layer, and then drain off the excess egg mixture and lay the bread over it. It's less of a souflee and more french toast.

This is my new favorite weekend breakfast.  I have made it before with milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2.  It turned out fine that time.  I made it today with 4 eggs and it also turned out fine.  Next time I am reducing the amount of brown sugar.  Reading the previous reviews helps.  I think 3/4 cups brown sugar is plenty.  Grand Marnier is a must, and we top it with fresh berries.  The sweetness of the sauce and the sour of the berries is a nice combo.  I am so glad I found this recipe!

This was AMAZING! It was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. My husband and kids loved it too! Soaking it overnight keeps it from having "eggy, runny" spots as some other reviewers had trouble with. The bread needs time to soak up all of the liquid. We sauted some chopped almonds in butter, cinnamon, and sugar then sprinkled them over the finished product. Mmmmm, so good! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent! I went over the top, if possible with this recipe, by using croissants (sliced in half). I also added some nutmeg and orange juice, used triple sec for the liqueur.

Very yummy and went over well. There is some planning that needs to go into making this as it needs to sit over night but turned out very good. I made it with some homemade french bread that I cut up into about 1" slices then cut each slice into 4 pieces to make it more of a finger food and allowing others to take as little or as much as they wanted. Would totally make it again and wasn't hard at all.

This is really a nice recipe.  My husband even enjoys this dish!  The only alteration I make is to use more slices of bread; six slices doesn't cover the dish so I use enough to cover the bottom.

This turned out really well. I followed the recipe exactly (except I filled the baking pan completely in one layer with the bread, not leaving any area uncovered). As written my family didn't find it too eggy and they are usually ones to voice their opinion when something is too much so. I personally did find it a bit too sweet and also with a bit too much butter, so I may cut back on the sugar and butter next time. Though it was very easy to make and everyone really enjoyed it as written. I used some hawaiian sweet bread since our grocery store didn't have any heavy french bread, only light fluffy french bread. I cut it and left it out for 6 hours or so on a cooling rack to dry out a bit. Turned out great. I do plan on making this recipe again in the future. This did serve 6 easily with some sausage on the side, 1/6 of the 9x13 pan was a large enough serving with it being so sweet. I imagine that 1/8 would be enough with some hashbrowns added or some fresh fruit.

My family loves Creme Brulee so I just had to try this recipe.  I made it this morning for my out-of-town company and it was delicious!!  I will definitely make it again.  And probably for Christmas morning.  I used Triple Sec which is a brand of orange liqueur and it was just as good.  You have to let it sit overnight so that the egg soaks into the bread.  I used 2 different kinds of french bread.  The denser bread was better.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic recipe. I did have to cook it for about 50 minutes. At 50 minutes it was puffed up & slightly brown-perfect! I omitted the Grand Marnier. This is a keeper. Super easy & delicous.

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast, the family enjoyed it very much. I substituted the GM with 1 tsp orange extract and 1 tbls orange juice concentrate giving the desired flavor without the stop at the liquor store. I baked the dish in my stoneware (I love my stoneware) which baked it beautifully and kept it warm. I used 8 pieces of bread instead of 6. I will make this again and again.

Update: I made this from memory (and surprisingly got all the ingredients right), but I just melted the butter with the sugar, didn't heat it til it the sugar actually dissolved. BIG big mistake! Make sure the sugar dissolves. Original:  I made a few changes and I thought this came out GREAT!  First, I melted the butter, sugar, and maple syrup in the microwave in the pan I intended to bake it in - one less pan to wash!.  I reduced the sugar even further to 2/3 cup and found it to be perfect. Didn't measure the Triple Sec, probably double the amount tho.  I followed Josie's advice and didn't use French bread and didn't let it sit.  I actually used leftover hamburger buns (did not cut off crust and placed crust side down).  This was even better later in the day and just reheated in the microwave.  I'll definitely make this again!

I am a french toast lover and this recipe by far takes the cake!! I substituted amaretto for the liqueur.  I intend on making this for Christmas breakfast because this french toast just gives off that "special meal" taste!

Made this for breakfast this morning...and um, well, it is pretty much dessert! :D I didn't marinate it overnight, just made as written and put in the oven (took 40 minutes at 350). Also, no liquer in the house, so I used orange juice. Very tasty, but very sweet! You could definitely reduce the sugar significantly and be fine!

This is an amazing recipe.  It tastes awesome for adults and children.  I tried this recipe for Christmas breakfast about 3 or 4 years ago and now its a family tradition.  Highly recommended!

Very sweet. It is good, almost like a dessert rather then a breakfast. No need for syrup.

This is delicious! And relatively easy to make - I like to make it for family gatherings, and it never fails to make me look like a better cook than I really am!

OMG!!!!  This is SOOOOOOOO delicious!!  I was planning a girls' brunch, so I tested this out on my family first. They LOVED it!!  My husband had 3 servings that night and my daughter even ate it for lunch the next day.  When I served it for my brunch, ALL the women raved about how AMAZING it was and all asked for the recipe. One woman who said she didn't even like the taste of creme brulee LOVED it, and you know, it REALLY does taste like creme brulee!! YUUUMMMMM!!!!  The best part was how EASY it was to make - very few ingredients and you can prepare it the night before.  This recipe will definitely be added to my recipe library and I will be making it for MANY occasions to come!!  Thank you for this!!!

This is not your traditional French Toast.  In my opinion it was more like bread pudding than French Toast.  The taste was awesome but the texture was horrible!

My husband rarely cooks, but for my birthday he surprised me with this awesome dish!  It was the best birthday gift.  He added a little bit of cinnamon and used day old grocery store sweet french bread and left the crust on, he also prepared it about 1 1/2 hours before putting it in the oven.  It was soooo good.  I can't wait to have it again.  Syrup was absolutely not necessary

I wish I would have loved this more because it sounded phenomenal!  I thought the carmel sauce was way too sweet and the eggs were an awful consistency.  Will probably not make again.

I could not believe how much this tasted like creme brulee, the texture of the bread and crispiness of the top makes it feel like you're eating creme brulee, and the taste is absolutely delicious. I recommend this for any and EVERY brunch you throw, absolutely delicious!!!

Excellent! I cut this recipe in half, using 3 eggs, and about 2/3 stick of butter. I didn't have any orange, but it still came out great. I didn't do the overnight thing either -- but it was just soo good! This is going to the favorite recipe box.

Made this yesterday for my husbands birthday brunch...It turned out fantastic and everyone loved it.  Made a few minor changes and used just what I had on hand...I didnt have  corn syrup so I used maple syrup instead.  Didnt have french bread so I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon and Raisin bread (cubed).  I didnt have GrandMarnier so I used regular Brandy.  I also added an 8-oz pkg of cream cheese to the milk mixture.   It turned out really well.  Hubby and the kids really enjoyed it.  I already have requests to make it again.

I made this for my mother on mother's day and she LOVED it. She even ate it for lunch. I filled up the pan with as much read as it could hold instead of the amount iin the recipe so that it wouldn't get to soggy. It was so easy to make. I prepared it the night before and baked it the mnext morning. Such a simple and easy dish that will have guests and family raving about your cooking skills. My parents have already requested it for next Christmas breakfast.

This recipe was amazing and very easy to prepare. It's very rich and sweet, so if you're serving it with brunch you have other "more bland" options. Also, make sure to cook it until it is golden brown, or else it will be soggy. I've made this with half and half and with soy milk, and they both taste excellent. I will make this again next time I have a brunch!

All my friends request this whenever we manage to get together for breakfast :D -- rather than stick to just 6 slices of french bread, I slice enough 1" slices from the loaf to fill the 9x13" pan.  With this many slices, no worries about sogginess -- nothing but goodness!

I loved it, but my family thought it was a bit too sweet (creme brulee is suppose to be sweet).  I will add a little less brown sugar this time around, but I loved it.

This recipe is always a hit.  Instead of french bread, I usually use challah (egg bread) found in most grocery store bakeries.  I trim the crusts from the bread. It is a ilttle softer bread.

These were pretty good and my guests enjoyed them.  Based on the other reviews, I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 Tbs. of corn syrup.  I used a mini baguette of French bread and kept the crust on - altogether it was about 9 slices.  I also used 2 tsp. of vanilla and 3 tsp. of Grand Marnier.  I also flipped and recoated the bread while it was in the fridge about halfway through.  I would make it again, but would probably cut the recipe in half.

I made this for my sister's baby shower and everyone loved it!  I cubed the french bread so that it would be easier to eat, without cutting.  Definately let the dish rest for a while before serving--it will set up and cool down enough for everyone to enjoy!!

Fabulous dish!  We added a little more Grand Marnier (2 to 3 tsp) to get more of the orange flavor.

I copied the review from Chef Wanda because it fits me to a tee as well. My feeling is that I cut my bread to thick and maybe used to dense of a bread. From Chef Wanda (and me): "I was surprised I did not like this recipe considering all the great reviews. Maybe I will try it again, but I think I did everything as directed. Mine came out semi-soggy and the caremalized part was just gummy and sticky. Overall, a big disapointment."

I've made this about 20 times in a variety of sized pans & combinations of eggs to bread getting it all to fit.  Sometimes it's dry, sometimes too custardy, but ALWAYS SOOOOO YUMMY!

The recipe was easy, but my family did not like it very much.  My child thought that it tasted like warm graham crackers. I did not care for the taste lacked comething, and did not tast like creme brule at all! I probably  will bot make this again.

Absolutely delicious. I made this for my mother's birthday and it was a HUGE success. I also flipped the bread halfway through cooking so that it would brown on both sides. Letting it soak overnight turned the bread into a delicious custard like consistency. I have been asked to make it for 3 other birthdays since.

This is very good!  I wouldn't compare it to creme brulee but it is a wonderful "breakfast casserole".  I didn't cut off the crusts and I can't imagine that it would be any better after you took all the time to do that.  What I do suggest is to serve with sliced strawberries as another reviewer recommended.  I think that greatly inhanced the flavors. Thanks Sandi!

This was given such high ratings thought i'd try it. I hate making breakfast in the am (not a breakfast eater) but my husband is, so i made this the night before. Was very easy to put together. I didn't have the brandy so used a tsp. of almond flavoring. It came out wonderful, even the pan was easy to clean up. I'd make this again. We both loved it. Didn't even serve butter or syrup with it--don't need to. Served banana slices and berries with as a side and made sausage but didn't need the sausage--very filling. Had leftovers!

I have to go with the majority on this one - a great recipe.  A very unique dish that my husband and kids enjoyed.  I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions. I only had the pillsbury french bread on hand so I had to use a few more slices to cover the 9 x 13 and had a carmel brandy that made this heavenly!  It turned out wonderful - thank you - it's a keeper!

This french toast is absolutely amazing.  Every time I make it I get rave reviews.  When I make it without crusts, it is more like bread pudding and I serve it as a dessert with fruit on top.  With the crusts, it's more like french toast.  Last time I made it as french toast, my friends put cream cheese and berries on top and it was even richer and more delicious, if that's possible.

I made this exactly as directed and it turned out perfectly. At first I was worried because the bread was swimming in the egg mixture, but after leaving it overnight it had all soaked into the bread by morning. It's important to leave this recipe for a minimum of 8 hours or until all the egg mix has soaked in. I used french bread and cut each slice just over 1 inch thick. I did not have a problem with sogginess, even after having left it overnight (probably sat for at least 14 hours). I cooked until the bread was toasty on the top. It wasn't dry or soggy. I used the amount of eggs as directed in the recipe and I did cut the crusts off the bread, unlike some other reviewers. The only reason I gave this recipe 3 stars instead of five is because I personally found it WAY too sweet with the caramel sauce. Even my kids found it too sweet! I would make it again but maybe next time just drizzle maple syrup on the bottom of the pan instead of the brown sugar/cornsyrup mix. But I liked how easy it was to prepare and my guests were impressed.

We prepared this recipe for Christmas morning, and I must say, it was the best french toast I have EVER eaten!!!  I loved the "creme brulee" topping and thought that the recipe turned out just right as listed.  The only thing I changed was that I added ORANGE JUICE instead of orange brandy - I don't think we missed it - it was extraordinary!

Very, very nice for special occasion/holiday breakfast or brunch. I used challah instead of French bread and Grand Marnier rather than "orange brandy." It was delicious.

mmm... soo good! i made this for christmas breakfast and it was delicious.  a little pesky that you have to bring it down to room temperature first before baking, because it did make us have to wait longer to eat, but it's okay. worth the wait!! i made this with challah bread and it was wonderful with it.  everybody loved it...thanks!!

This was absolutely delicious.  It was made for Christmas morning breakfast and was a big hit with my family.  I did make two modifications though.  I used plain brandy and orange extract instead of the orange brandy.  I also used one of those pre-cut loaves of french bread and ended up using 10 slices instead of 6.  It worked out well for us and there were no leftovers!  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for the second time on Christmas and it was again a big hit.  I've made it with regular white bread and french bread.  It came out great both times.  I used two layers of regular bread and did not remove the crust from either bread and it worked perfectly.  My daughter's boyfriend requested the recipe so my daughter could make it for him again.

I made this for Christmas Morning.  It was absolutely fabulous and EVERYONE loved it and RAVED about it.  I did NOT cut the Crusts off of the bread and it was great.  I doubled the recipe too.  I didn't have 3 Cups of half and half so I used 2 Cups of half and half and 1 cup of milk and it was still delicious.  This is a KEEPER for sure and will become a tradition!!!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  I am planning on serving this at a baby shower brunch because it was a perfect night before dish.  Not only was it SUPER EASY (I followed the recipe & had no problems), it was delicious!  I thought six slices of bread is 2 servings for us big eaters, but neither of us could finish.  I would say it is more like 3 filling servings.  The next time I serve it, I will probably serve it with bacon to counteract the sweet. A KEEPER.

Holy cats this thing is rich! It tasted great though - I had thinner bread so I used two layers and it soaked up the egg mixture easily. If you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth some evening, make this up, put it in the fridge and enjoy it in the morning.

I don't know what I did wrong but my french bread did not soak up the egg mixture and I ended up with baked bread in a baked egg mess.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of bread.  I'd try again, it smelled wonderful as it baked but I'd try a different kind of bread.

Incredible! The first time, I accidently made this with whipping cream (that'll teach me to cook without putting on my glasses first) and it turned out much more rich but still rather good.  I've made it since (with the half and half), and it's become a Sunday tradition in our household.

Amazing French Toast recipe!  I started out with a local bakery country French bread, quite dense and delicious.  Although this recipe would have been great as is, the toast became exceptional with double the Grand Marnier and more vanilla.  Also, once the French toast was almost finished, I removed it from the oven, carefully lifted each piece from the dish and quickly fried in butter on the non-caramel side only for a golden  finish.   Remarkable.

Always a favorite in our house.  I like to impress guests with this too. I leave out the orange flavoring, but that's the only change I make. anyone commenting about the custard consistency being unfavorable, obviously does not know what creme brulee is, js.

We make this for Christmas brunch as well as other special occasions & it is always a big hit.  We use baguette bread sliced into 2" thick pieces and stuff them in to the pan.  We then top with fresh strawberries, whipped cream & warmed, real maple syrup. Outstanding!

I have made this as part of my Christmas morning brunch buffet. I double the recipe and make it in the disposable aluminum pans -- no cleaning required when you're exhausted from Christmas prep. This is a great recipe because it must be made the night before. **Just remember to take it out of the fridge for a few hours before you bake it!**  It's important to take that into consideration for your meal time. I usually have it in the oven while presents are being opened. Everyone loves it; leftovers taste great after re-warming in the microwave.
Suggestions:  Leave the crust on the French bread; it gives better texture to each piece. Maple syrup can be subbed for corn syrup. And if you don't have liquer, use orange extract. Also, I have grated orange zest over the top before chilling it in the fridge.  
** Someone reviewed that they did not like the custard texture of the final product. But note the title ... Creme Brûlée is, by its name, a sweet vanilla custard. I would expect that to come through in the recipe and would be disappointed if it didn't.

The whole family loves this recipe.  During the holidays I use eggnog instead of milk.  I use orange juice instead of liquoire and sprinkle with cinammon and a little bit of nutmeg. I use the whole Challah bread as well.  Perfection!

Made this the night before and I did two layers.  Made sure the bread was evenly covered in egg without being drenched. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and added some cinnamon and brown sugar on the top to make a crumble.  Received rave reviews for Christmas brunch...even my husband who doesn't like French Toast said it was really good and had a second helping!

Fantastic for Christmas brunch. Everyone raved and I should have made a double batch.  I loved to creamy consistency.  I followed the recipe except for leaving the crust on and having a heavy hand on all the measurements. Great served alongside ham, veggie eggs and topped with raspberries . Thank you

Used 4 eggs as so many recommended.   Didn't cut back on brown sugar ... Loved having sweet French toast ...no syrup needed. Did sprinkle with cinnamon and dipped bread before putting in pan... Poured remaining egg mixture on top.  Like others flipped and broiled about 3 min.   Awesome Easter breakfast

Substituted triple sec for grand Marnier

This is an awesome recipe! A very big hit in my family. I added a big hand full of crushed pecans on top of the brown sugar. Next time I will cut back on the amount of butter & brown sugar, just a little bit. I also used orange extract instead of the liqueur.

SOOOOO rich and sweet.  Plus, for some reason mine didn't come out with a crispy bottom so they were pretty soggy.  I cooked it longer than it said too!  I so wanted to love this.

Turned out great.  I used 4 eggs instead of 5 like many of the reviews suggested. I didn't soak the bread but I did flip the bread half way through cooking.  I also put the oven on broil for a few minutes after around 40 minutes and that worked out great. 
My wife thought it was too sweet but I reminded her that it was a creme brulee recipe and I'd try a different recipe if I wanted to cut back on the sugar.  Overall it was awesome!

I just made this dish for my family, and it was a huge hit! I lieu of French bread, I used a thick baguette. I also baked it right away, only letting it soak in the custard for about 20 minutes. My only critique is that you don't need all of the custard- next time I'll use 4 eggs and 1/4 cup less of the cream. Other than that, it came out delicious! It's now in my recipe box!

This may well become our Christmas morning tradition!  The only thing we have say about it at this point is it seemed a little to 'eggy'. Next time we are goo to scale that back a bit. Otherwise, perfect!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the eggs in the french toast did not set properly. The resulting texture was that of uncooked eggs. It also seemed to have too much eggs, I would cut them back in the future. But the flavor was nice.

My husband and I love Creme Brulee, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  Boy am I glad I did!!!  It is delicious and definitely will be making it again and again and again, etc.  Sweet on it's own...doesn't need any syrup at all.

Made this for my military son on Mother's Day.  He absolutely LOVED it!  I used French bread with the crusts on, only 4 eggs, no liqueur (didn't have any), inverted the slices in the pan after 40 minutes, and put back in the over for 5 more minutes. Served with syrup and butter.  It was spectacular!

The BEST thing I've ever tasted!!! I make an overnight French toast every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but nothing as good as this. AMAZING!! I used challah bread and orange liquor and also reduced the eggs as others suggested. I think I will double the recipe next time and make a double layer of bread to make a thicker French toast, still using the sane size pan. Can't wait for Christmas morning to eat this again

Excellent! I didn't have corn syrup so I just used some "pancake syrup" that I had in the cabinet. I also used two teaspoons of Grand Marnier because I just wanted to. It turned out great!

I think this dish has potential---but it was a bit too eggy for my.  It could've been that I didn't soak it over night.  Either way---recommend cutting the suggested servings of eggs in half...

Made this today for my family. I did double it to make sure there was enough. Well, while the taste was very good, way to soggy. Most definitely way too much butter. I did add less brown sugar and corn syrup, but, geez, butter bubbled everywhere!! Won't make again.

I've made this 3 times and everyone who tries it absolutely loves it!  I use the hawaiian sweet rolls and I use milk instead of half and half to cut the calories a bit and it still tastes great.

Followed other reviewers' advice and added less sugar and corn syrup. I also flipped it, and broiled it at the end. Mine came out a bit chewy on the tops but it was very tasty. Will definitely try to make it again, perhaps without broiling it.

I've tried overnight French toasts before and have not had any luck until I made this one. It was delicious and not too soggy, which is usually my problem. Love it!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DISH I haven't met one person who did it, I am a model and I will say its not good for you if your watching your weight (be prepared to work it off later) but it is delicious, At 1st I didn't like the consistency but when I left it in the oven a little long it got to a french toast like consistency

I don't really eat much bread but this was AMAZING!  I used 4 eggs and left the crust on, like the other reviewers suggested.  Will DEFINATELY make it again, and again, and again!

My cousin made this for us when we stayed with her & it was sooooooo delicious!!!! We all begged for the recipe & she finally told me where to get it. One big change we made (by accident) my mom got carried away & accidentally cracked 2 extra eggs into the mix. we took out the 2 yolks, but coulsnt get 2 egg whites worth out so we just left them & YUM! We also added a smidge extra grand marnier. hehe

This french toast is such a treat. I reserve it for "special occasions" because it is too rich for every weekend. I am frequently asked to bring it to brunches. Only thing I do differently is I use more orange liqeur (increase to 3 Tbsp)!

This one of my favorite overnight French toast recipes. I don't always have Grand Marnier, but I never let that stop me.  This recipe is great with or without it.  I like to serve this with a dollop of whipped cream and a tiny bit of syrup, although the syrup isn't really necessary because this forms a rich caramel layer on the bottom.

I substituted 1 1/3 cups vanilla soy milk for half and half or cream, oj for grand marnier and almond extract for vanilla (because I realized at the last minute that I was out) and it turned out fabulously well! What a delicious breakfast - perfect flavor from the bottom all the way through the bread!!

I made this for brunch on Sunday and it was sooo good. I let it stay in my fridge for two nights, I didn't have time to make it the morning before and ti turned out great. I also let it bake for about 45 minutes, keeping an eye on it and pulling it out when the butter brown sugar layer started to bubble, I think it helped to keep the bread crisp and the brown sugar to further caramelized making the entire dish crisp and nothing like soggy french toast your used to.

I make this for my MOPS (young moms) group at church. It's wonderful!!!! I use that thick Texas Toast (Winco carries a maple-flavored) and cut the crusts off. Don't use plain, thin bread--it won't do. Also, I leave out the Grand Marnier...you can add more vanilla or sub Wilton's butter flavoring, if desired. If possible, let bread come to room temp before baking. Oh yes, and I recommend using a glass pan, and not a metal pan-the caramel bottom gets too hard in a metal pan.

This french toast is fabulous, not to mention, simple.  This is the third time I've made this and I did make some changes.  I used 8-2 inch thick slices of french bread, used 2 cups of half and half, and omitted the orange liquer because I did not have any.  It turned out great and there were no leftovers.  This is delicious served with sausage and fruit.

This French Toast is delicious!!!!  It's a breeze to make and such a treat.  I have made it twice and both times stacked two pieces of stale white bread on top of each other to make it thicker, because I didn't have french bread.  Other than not using french bread I follow the recipe exactly, and it turns out perfect every time.

Made for Christmas brunch -- even the kids loved it!  I used 8 slices of Texas toast in a 9x13 pan.  Did everything else as described and it was perfect.  It's on the keeper list for us!

Great recipe! After reading the reviews, I left out one egg, tripled the vanilla, and used 2% milk.  It still tasted plenty rich.. I can't imagine what it would have been like with heavy cream! Eek!

I ended up using tiny slices of sourdough bread, and each slice was practically enough for a meal. I also let it soak for 14 hours, and it was wonderful.

This was SO good.  This will be a Christmas morning tradition from now on.  I did make a few changes based on other reviews and based on personal taste.  To the brown sugar mixture I added chopped pecans.  I also left the crust on.  For the egg mixture I used egg beaters, and insted of orange liquor I used cinnamon liquor (Goldschlager) and topped it all with a sprinkling of cinnamon.  This is so unbelievably good.

Delicous.  The only thing I did different was to leave the crusts on the bread.  I made this for our Christmas morning brunch.  Everyone loved it.  I will make it again soon...maybe for new years morning.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

We looooved it!! My slices were about 2 inches thick and did not get soaked all the way through. We liked this because we could pick it up by the bready end without any mess. If you want the top crispy you'll have to broil it but great without the crispy top too. We left this in the oven after it was cooked all day on 100 degrees. It stayed warm and was munchable all day.

I made a few modifications since I didn't have some ingredients (and based on other reviewers comments). I used 1/2 c soy milk and 1 cup of Silk Nog (soy nog) instead of the half and half (probably should have cut back on the sugar a bit but it was still delicious). I also cut back the eggs to 4 since I was already using egg nog. I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier, maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and added some cinnamon to the sauce. I used 2 day old french bread cut 1/2 to 3/4inches so I didn't put all of the sauce on, it was for xmas morning and I didn't want to take any chances. I just reserved the extra sauce for morning in case it looked dry but didn't need it. It came out delicious, browned on top, crispy on the edges, moist but not soggy (i also left the crusts on). My family loved it, and I wasn't slaving in the kitchen, missing out on the fun! :) I recommend serving w/some type of meat to offset the sweet.

Very rich.  Very good.  Can make with a 'flavored' creamer, but be sure to cut the other sugar.

This was Awesome!  I actually doubled the batch and I made one dish with the crust left on and it was still delicious
The carmelized bottoms were simply divine. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the egg mixture was even eaten alone, just the right sweetness. I will be making this again & again!

This was a really good recipe but my husband and I both thought it was too rich for a breakfast food.  Seemed more like a dessert.  It is very custard-like.  I do recommend this recipe if you enjoy custard as it is more like that than french toast.

I made this for a girl that I am dating and it was AMAZING!  I gave the leftovers to one of her roommates that thought it was great and my roommate that thought it was the best french toast that he has ever tasted.  This is obviously a huge hit with everyone that I know.  One thing was that I didn't have 8 hours to let it sit.  I let it sit and soak up the mix for 2 hours and it turned out great!  I assume that if I let it sit for longer it would have been fluffier but I loved it just the same.

Made this the other day, and just finished the leftovers reheated in the oven.. which are just as excellent as they were two days ago.
I read alot of the reviews, and followed the recipe to a "tee" with one exception.  I didn't have french bread, just plain jane wal-mart white, which I left the crusts on and doubled for the 1" thick slices.  
I left all the eggs in and whipped them well with the half and half, which I believe now is critical for the texture of this recipe; as is letting it sit in the fridge overnight for it to appropriately soak the bread.  If it is baked correctly and not overdone, the texture AND TASTE mimics the fluffy jiggly nature of real creme brulee.  
WONDERFUL RECIPE!!

I thought this was basically a bread pudding recipe. I did follow the most popular advice given by others, but this recipe really fell short. The flavor is good, I'll give you that, but if you are one who does not like the texture of a bread pudding (soggy) then DO NOT make this!

Incredible!  I used Hawaiian Sweet Bread - the round one.  I just sliced it and included crust and all.  I did not have any Grand Marnier; so I doubled the vanilla. Everyone loved it.  Thank you for a wondeful, easy recipe!

I made this recipe for Mother's Day Brunch and it was a huge success!  After reading the advice of several critics, I altered the recipe as follows:  I did not cut the crusts off the bread, I used a little over 1 loaf of french bread, putting about 16 1 1/2" pieces into a 13 x 9 inch pan.  I omitted the orange liquer and added cinnamon to the egg mixture.  What I would do different next time....and there will definitely be a next time...I will use two more eggs and 1/2 cup more half & half to compensate for the extra bread and I will flip the bread 1/2 way through soaking.

Fantastic!  I had 6, 12 year old girls sleepover last night outside in a tent, and this was just the breakfast to welcome them in the house in the morning.  The house smelled great, and the girls inhaled this.  In fact, I was told I should open a B&B.  :-)  I served with banana slices on the side.  My modifications:  filled the 9x13 pan with bread (about 10 slices), used 4 eggs instead of 5, and added some cinnamon to the egg mixture.

I have made this recipe MANY times and it is fantastic!  Every special brunch or breakfast I have hosted in the past 3 years has featured this, and now my friends and familt expect it!  I make it just as written, except I have never removed any crusts.  Also, do not let this sit around for too long after removing from the oven--once my guests were late and while it sat, the delicious caramel on the bottom hardened and then got stuck in our teeth while we ate it.  But that was my guests' fault, not the recipe's!  An absolutely fabulous, easy, and convenient recipe.

THE BEST french toast bake recipe.  A staple every year for Christmas morning.  I like to try new recipes but every year I try, I get asked to make this one again.  Don't fix it if it ain't broke, I guess!

This is so delicious. I made it for the first time for a mother's day brunch. I tripled the recipe and it was gone so fast! I recently made it for a christmas gathering. I only had 1 cup of half & half so I added 1/2 cup of creme brule liquor and it turned out wonderfully!

I made this over Thanksgiving weekend for breakfast for my extended family, doubled. I was told that it tastes just as good with the crusts on, but it didn't with the bread I used. Some crusts got very crunchy, so I wouldn't recommend that. Even so, the taste was great! I'd love to make this again!!

Soooo good and easy too! I made this for my in-laws and got great reviews, a little sweet for me though. I used orange zest in place of the grand marnier. I will make this again for sure.

OH MY GOSH! This is so good and so rich that I have decided to only make it on very special occassions. Our family parties always seem to start early in the day with everyone cooking, etc. and last late into the evening. The problem is the family wants this on Easter, Christmas, Birthday's, etc.

To give credit where credit is due, I've been making this delicious recipe since 1998 when I discovered a similar recipe featured in Gourmet magazine in an article on best Inn breakfasts.  It deserves its fame!

My family requests this dish every year for Christmas brunch.  It is super easy since all of the preparation is done the night before and it soaks in the fridge.  A real winner!

I have made this dish several times and every time it is a huge hit!  Word to the wise - no matter how much your guests insist that they want the recipie for this dish, do not tell them what's in it while they're still eating it - the thought of consuming that many calories is enough to ruin many an appetite.

Excellent. Didn't have French bread so I used regular bread that I tore up and dried a bit in a warm oven. Instead of liqueur I substituted 2 tablespoons of OJ concentrate but it was undetectable. Next time I'll try orange zest or extract.

FABULOUS.  I made this when a friend and her little girl came to town for a shopping excursion to the Windy City.  We loved it and Gracie learned how to say "Cake"... no syrup needed, very easy.. matched it up with sausage and fruit.  We make it all the time.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!   I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast and we loved it.   I baked it longer than it calls for so the top was well-browned.  I also substituted egg nog for the 1/2 and 1/2 and it was delicious!

I just made this for company for the 3rd time.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.  I don't remove the crusts and I flip the bread half way through.  It's great, b/c you can make it easily the night.  I usually serve it with strawberries on top.

Delicious and so pretty.  I made this for my husband and kids, ages 2 and 4.  The kids weren't fond of it.  I will make it again for my girlfriends!  It's more likely I will get the ooh and ahh I was hoping for, lol!

Absolutely Divine!  I served this for my fiancee the morning after our engagement. Needless to say, she said "yes" again, this time to my offer of another helping. Enjoy!

Not for those that don't care for sugary, sweet entrees at breakfast. If you are such, I'd reduce the corn syrup and the brown sugar as suggested by veronica in an ealrier review.

First of all I am a HUGE fan of Creme Brulee so i was so excited to try this recipe.  That being said I think this should have been called carmel corn french toast.  My husband and I both thought it reminded us of carmel corn.  I made the recipe exactly as it wias listed.  We also found it to be a little sweet.  My 3 year old seemed to really enjoy it but I was only able to eat half a slice.  Not a bad recipe, just not for us.

Very sweet!  Tasty.  Should have boiled the caramel longer (my fault) and I found it easy to prepare and popped it in the oven. Hubby thought it okay and he's the french toast man but I would serve it to guests along with other breakfast goodies!  I did keep the recipe.  I may use Italian bread next time.

My wife makes this, and it's a big hit with overnight guests. We modify the recipe by placing cherry pie filling or apple pie filling in between the slices of bread before pouring the egg mixture (for me cherry works better, the tart blends well with the sweet of the main dish).

Good, but more like a bread cinnamon roll than French toast. Mine didn't puff up like I expected it to.  If I make it again, will add at least 2 more eggs, and use 2 cups half-and-half.  The bread soaked up all the excess liquid as it set overnight.

I made this for my daughter's personal wedding shower.  It was a HUGE HIT!!!!  After reading the reviews I was cautious about the amount of liquid, but it was okay.  I dotted the top with butter right before baking and substituted a scant 1/4 cup of caramel liqueur instead of the grand marnier.  This is already in my recipe box and will stay there forever...

What a treat! After baking, I carefully flipped the entire french toast casserole over and baked it for about 15 minutes more. (use a large spatula and flip one half at a time.) Before pulling it out of the oven, I broiled it for one minute. This gave it a caramelized crunch to the edges and tops of each slice. I served it with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Next time I make this I'm going to boil the butter/sugar/syrup mixture for about 5 minutes before pouring it into the pan.

thank you for this delicious recipe.  i used crusty french bread, and so ended up with 10 slices in the pan.  even after refrigerating it overnight, there was still a layer of egg mixture that was not soaked up by the bread, but after baking it all turned out perfect anyway.

I tell EVERYONE about this recipie!  I made it for Eater and a bridal shower and I have had rave reviews.  I used more than 6 slices of bread though.  I used about 12 slices enough to fill a 9x13 pan.  No syrup needed it has enough in the recipe already.

I've tried many recipes from this site, but this was the first I HAD to write a review for.  This is fantastic French toast.  It's not hard to make at all, and the results are wonderful.  I served it at a Christmas brunch for 30 people, and everyone raved about it.  A must try recipe!

Thought this was excellent just as the recipe called. We added a little maple syrup and the entire casserole was eaten. It was a great Christmas morning treat. Thanks!

My goodness this is delicious!  It has a wonderfully rich taste and texture that is perfect on its own without any syrup or butter.  I served it with sliced fresh fruit and was praised by everyone at the table – not a crumb left on the plates :D  It takes a bit of time to prepare, but is hands-down worth the effort.  TIP: To keep it from being too soggy, keep the crust on the bread!  Its structure allows the moisture to evaporate correctly in the oven and adds nice contrasting texture.

This was SO good and SO easy!  I added more vanilla and more Grand Marnier!

YUMMY! I followed exactly, but I didn't have any orange brandy so I used 1/2 tsp brandy and 1/2 tsp orange juice.  Also, I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and it still turned out fine.  I didn't have time to refrigerate overnight since I found this recipe the morning I was making it, so I just put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it still turned out delicious! Will make again, following the REAL directions next time!

This was fabulous!  I didn't add the brandy (didn't have any) and used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup and it still turned out great.  Made this for a women's breakfast, and everyone raved over it.  Will definitely be making this again! Make sure to butter the pan, and when serving, invert it onto a serving plate for a beautiful presentation.

This came out tasting great!  However, next time I will reduce the eggs by 2.  The texture was rather "gloppy", at best.  Also, I used cinnamon raisin bread (texas toast) instead of french bread & added some maple syrup to the batter.  Be careful of oven temps!  My oven is at least 25 degrees over & the creme brulee part was a bit burnt (but still tasted good!).  Will definitely try this one again.  You'll love the way it makes your home smell!

This was good. I made mine with a drop of orange extract and regular brandy, but the orange flavor was too overwhelming. I wouldn't recommend using it. Just use plain brandy if you have it, or leave it out entirely.

I made this recipe for a brunch I had today and everyone LOVED it!  I followed others advise and left the crust on and had NO problem with a "custudy mess" as others have complained about.  I also made sure my bread was sliced 1" thick.  I didn't have any orange brandy, so I substituted a small amount of orange extract.  Would make again for a special occasion.  It was an impressive dish!  Thank you!

I have made this several times now and it always turns out fabulous. A couple of times I used 2% milk because I didn't have any half & half....still delicious.  I also have just waited until the morning to make up and pop in the oven...and skipped the overnight in the fridge.  Very forgiving.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Yummy!  I made this for myself, for mothers' day.  I prepared everything Saturday night, and left it to sit in the fridge, then cooked it Sunday morning, when I got up.  I did cut everything in half, using only 2 eggs, but I used enough bread to fill up my 8x8 pan.  I loved this!  It wasn't too custardy, it was perfect.  My 7-year old wasn't fond of it, so I refrigerated the leftovers, and this morning, my 3-year old can't get enough of it.  I think I am going to have to make some more, if I still have enough half-and-half on hand.  Very, very good, so glad that I tried it.  This one is getting a permanent spot in the recipe book.  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious- we are both creme brulee lovers and french toast enthusiasts, so we very much enjoyed this.  The one caveat is not to let it sit too long- it is very easy for it to get soggy.  But served fresh and hot it makes a wonderful special occasion brunch.

Great stuff!  I followed the ingredients pretty closely, but instead of making the caramel sauce and putting it in the bottom, I made it the next morning and poured over the bread.  Still came out wonderfully!

Yummy!  I made this recipe once for a weekend in Big Bear and was able to make it 2 nights ahead so I didn't have to cook once up in the cabin.  Due to the supermarket strikes, we couldn't find french bread so we used sliced, packaged potato bread and put it 2 slices thick in the pan and it turned out perfect!  The bread "melded" into one think slice.  I've made it since Big Bear without the recipe on hand (from memory) and forgot the corn syrup, orange brandy, and salt and it was just as good as the first time!  I always serve w/ sliced strawberries to cut the sweetness.  I have received rav reviews every time!

WOW!!  Was this fabulous!!!!  Instead of French bread I used cinnamon swirl bread with bits of apple in it.  Since I bought it uncut, I could cut the slices the size needed for this recipe.  I didn't include the orange brandy but I did leave the crusts on the bread.  It was VERY, VERY easy to do.  This was served at a Holiday brunch and was a total hit.  I think I've started a new tradition for us!!!  THANK YOU, SANDI!!

Good but I recommend using a 15 to 16-ounce loaf of French bread cut or torn into small pieces and forget about taking off the crust.  No need for any additional syrup with this but you might want to add some pecans.

This is a delicious recipe! Very Rich! You will not need syrup for this french toast. I served it for Easter Brunch, everyone loved it! It's SO EASY to make! Texas Toast will work well with the recipe in a pinch, the French bread is better. Thanks Sandi!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it didn't turn out as I expected. I sliced the bread to 1" thickness but the liquid was not enough to cover the bread. I ended up with slices of bread swimming in a custard mess. I think next time I would maybe tear the bread into pieces, add the liquid, and see how it turns out. Still...the taste is great.

I hate to give such a higly rated recipe a bad review but this dish really didn't turn out very well.  The taste was entirely dominated by the flavor of the eggs, and considering the fat content of this recipe, and the time involved I will never make it again.

Excellent recipe and it is SO easy!! I made it for brunch and it was a huge hit. I didn't have half & Half so I used the Heavy Cream I had on hand. I omitted the liqueur because I didn't have that either.  Used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet at that. Also only used 4 eggs. You can't go wrong with all the delicious ingredients - I added cinnamon on top and it was amazing. Next time, I will add cinnamon to the mixture and broil it like others said or even try to pan fry it to get a harder crunch on the outside. So good!

it was delicious and so freakn easy to make too!
bit more sugar than what I'm accustom to so will make it again with less.
instead of brandy I chose to use Port wine. ;)
every one that has tried it has loved it.

Amazing orange custard flavor with crisp brown sugar glaze topping if you flip it over and broil on low for a few minutes as suggested by others. I only had Texas toast so we can’t wait to try it with a rustic bread or croissant! I went heavy with the Grand Marnier and used the zest of an orange. We served it with extra thick cut bacon and Raspberry Blood Oranges. Perfect Birthday in Bed Breakfast! My hubby said it was best French toast he’s ever had.

I made no changes to the recipe presented and it was absolutely delicious.  The 1st time I used dark brown sugar and the 2nd time we made it with light brown sugar.  The dark brown sugar, in my opinion, is the way to go.  Both tasted really wonderful but the dark brown makes a better presentation.

Absolutely amazing. Our family finished the whole pan and wanted more! I followed the recipe with these exceptions: used a whole loaf of French bread except the very ends, did not remove the crusts. I used 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of Grand Marnier. This was a mistake on my part, but it tasted great, so no regrets! I refrigerated overnight, then let it come to room temperature in the morning while getting ready. I did sprinkle cinnamon on the bread before placing in the oven. I will do this recipe again, with the same methods, as this was fantastic! Definitely my standard go to for brunch for every holiday. I plan on making this again for New Years!

I made a Christmas variation of this using Italian panettone (the short wider one) and used 3 eggs and a third of a cup or egg substitute also used maple instead of corn syrup and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on it. It came out great.

Everyone loved this!  I made almost exact to the recipe, except used 3/4 cup of brown sugar as suggested and was generous with the liquor and vanilla.  I also turned the temp up to 450 F for the last 3-4 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

It is tasty but I will only cut the bread 1" thick next time and I will soak them first in the batter on both sides to evenly absorb. I had to freeze them for a few days but that wasn't a problem.

Made this and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator for guests that were coming over the next morning. It was so easy to make and they loved it! I did reduce the egg and half and half as other reviewers suggested, also added a bit of cinnamon. It was definitely sweet, but that was pretty obvious from the ingredients list. My company said it was like getting the center of a cinnamon roll with each bite.

Wonderful! I realize that it can be an advantage to prepare something like this in advance such as the night before, but I have made this twice now on the spur of the moment with very little soak time and it turn out amazing. As with some others I changed the corn syrup to maple syrup and cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup and think that I will try 1/2 cup next time.

Been wanting to make this for months.. Finally got around to it and this dish did not have a creme brulee taste at all. I read so many reviews and incorporated what I thought would be good.  I used maple syrup in place of the corn syrup and orange extract in place of the Grand Marnier as some suggested and it was waayyyy to "orangey". The brown sugar/butter mixture was gloppy and did not pour easily into the pan. I did use 2 day old french bread which made a nice thick piece of French toast. I also did not make ahead. I used 4 eggs  which worked just fine.. I added banana slices when serving this to my boys (9 and 14) and they did say it was good (but this was after I added more of the brown sugar mixture on top). We also used more maple syrup. Overall, this dish tasted nothing like Creme Brulee. Next time: no orange flavored anything!

4.29.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/35255/creme-brulee-french-toast/ ... This was a hit. ‘So much of a hit they I made it twice in one week! First time, I followed directions with 3/4c sugar in pot, which slightly caramelized as I attempted to dissolve the sugar. Second, I sprinkled the 3/4c sugar over the melted butter in dish. With that, sugar crystals still, kind of grainy. It didn’t bother me, but others liked the first one better.  I’m not up for the Gran Marnier price tag n added a half t orange extract; subtle, yet effective. The vanilla is optional. I tried with n without. I love vanilla, but with another recipe, adding vanilla detracted from the orange flavor. ‘Wasn’t the case here. I followed reviewer comments n along with lessening sugar to 3/4c, only 4 eggs. I greased the dish & snuggly filled with one inch, crust-on, day old Italian bread. K, 19, liked it because it was sweet enough, didn’t need syrup. Right, she was! For good looks, you’ll want to flip it. I subbed Bikerfamily’s syrup for the corn syrup.  Brilliance.  :D

Made this with sourdough French bread & replaced the corn syrup with maple syrup since that's what was in the fridge.  So yummy, and sweet enough that there was no need to put more syrup on the finished toast (although we did top it with some fresh raspberries).  Loved it, will be making it again for sure.

Made one change, and it was still amazing! My store was out of French Bread, so I ended up using texas toast. The entire family asked me to make it again. So it looks like I'm going to have to double the recipe for the next time.

Made it and took it to work. I had to substitute a tsp each of orange and brandy extracts for the liqueur  and it worked amazingly well. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top before placing in the refrigerator.  Will definitely make it again soon!

The family loves this recipe!  Creme Brulee for breakfast.  I love that it’s something I can make the night before and just throw in the oven on busy holiday mornings.  If you want a dish that ensures your adult children will be on time for brunch...this is it!

Made per the recipe, except for subbing maple syrup for the corn syrup, which was a good call. Didn't flip halfway through cooking, and definitely should have. Ended up with a tasty, but eggy slop on the bottom. Was very easy, and would definitely make again.

I’ve made this for Xmas morning  the last five years.
Everyone loves it, and the aroma is intoxicating in the house.
I serve it wuth fresh fruit and it’s wonderful.

Make sure you refrigerate overnight so the flavors marry.

I made this for an after Thanksgiving breakfast and it was really excellent.  I made exactly to the recipe but found the cooking time was considerably longer than called for, even in my convection oven.  Still, this is a recipe the whole family loved.

This is a GREAT breakfast dish! I've made it several times, however, the most recent time I used Challah bread from Publix, it was the best yet!! I tweaked the recipe a little. Make it the night before, spray baking dish with PAM, use 6 eggs, Challah bread, and 1 tablespoon of grand marnier. Once it's ready flip the dish onto a serving platter so all the gooey good stuff is on top, delicious!,

This recipe is loved by my whole family.  Instead of one layer of bread, I used two layers of sour dough bread with crust.  I poured half of the egg mixture over the first layer of bread, sprinkled it with cinnamon and then added second layer of bread and poured the rest of egg mixture over it and then again sprinkled cinnamon on the bread.  This way all the egg mixture is absorbed by the two layers of bread and was not custard like as some have described.  Plus there is more yummy to eat!!

I made this for my "Toast and Theology" breakfast and Bible Study.  I made one change and used frozen OJ concentrate (2 tbls) instead of Triple Sec.  I hah some left over so I took it to the Police/Fire Dept.  The Chief told me later that "it was Heavenly."

Love this French toast! I always make it the night before so it is super easy the next day.  Everyone always raves about it and wants me to make it for every brunch event.  I do use challah bread instead of French since it is denser and I think that really helps it hold up with in the egg mixture.

I didn’t have 1” thick French bread, nor could I find any that wasn’t already sliced at my local Kroger, so I used a loaf that was pre sliced and squeezed 7 slices into the pan. With less bread, the mixtures of wet ingredients were so sweet that my family all stopped eating at or before 2 slices and normally they love sweet food. The flavor is delicious and the recipe as is is very decadent! The bread remained soggy after 40 min of cooking but my guess is that thicker slices would have helped. I decided it would be nice to do the work ahead of time and just cook in the oven as this recipe states because mornings are hectic in my house with 2 kids and some days 2 adults rushing off to drop kids and get to work. Pleasantly surprised by the flavor, will either use less sweet ingredients next time or thicker bread. Perhaps both. And I had read some reviews and since I never use corn syrup I used maple syrup instead. Plenty delicious!

I made this according to direction, EXCEPT, since this was a brunch for adults only, I added white rum instead of the other liquids.  Gave it a slightly different taste, but, I did make 2x as much and there was nothing left!  Great recipe!  Will definitely make this again, but thinking that orange liquor would go as well, as long as no children are b
eing served the same portions!

The recipe was changed so much in the video.  Crust on, crust off. Orange zest and maple syrup,  but no corn syrup. . 
This is really 2 different recipes from written vs. video. 
Trying to find orange brandy was not easy. Grand marnier is really cognac. Found Apple, pineapple and peach brandy, but no orange. 
Grand Marnier better be on you liquor shelf already or get ready for extreme sticker shock. Miniature came in handy at $6.00. That will make about 4 batches. 
Ok so I made it with part of the crust cut off, the size dish called for hold 8 slices easily. 
I only use salted butter in my home, so I just omitted the 1/4t. salt, called for. 
Sprinkled with conf. sugar and cinnamon when served. 
Not bad. Family liked it as a change from regular French toast. 
It was good and I will make it again.

Happened to see this recipe & happy I did. We had it this morning & it was wonderful. I saw a couple of reviews that made me use 3/4 cup of brown sugar & Maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Also used 2 tsp of Orange Liquor instead of 1 tsp.
It turned out GREAT. My husband liked it too, which for him is sometimes unusual.  Will make it again. Marilou

This was a relatively easy recipe with  good results.  The recipe states to remove  the French  bread crust but the video shows otherwise.  So I didn’t know which way to go so I left crust on.  It was very good but it was a bit tough on the crusty edges.  The recipe does not say to serve it by flipping it over and it should cuz it looks very moist with a  sugary layer resembling  maple syrup .  Otherwise the top is quite dry and crusty looking.  Flavor was wonderful.  However I may add  a little cinnamon to the egg batter and pecans to the brown sugar layer before pouring the Egg Batter over the bread.    But it was  excellent   Without any changes.  I like to always prepare a recipe as stated then make the necesssry changes to accommodate my families likings.   I topped it with sliced Bananas and almonds.  And there was no need for maple syrup  if you flip when you serve.  My husband dubbed it a Vegas Breakfast.   I will make this for guests next time.

I’m so happy that I tried this, it was GREAT. After reading other reviews, I used 4 eggs, added some cinnamon, and nutmeg. I also baked it a little longer than suggested and I was extremely pleased.

I found this recipe on All-Recipes years ago and have made it oodles of times for special days.  Everyone loves it!  It's absolutely scrumptious! I may try some of the suggestions I see here just to lower the nutritional cost.  Oh, but it's so good as is.

I made following recipe using Trader Joes Brioche bread.  Baked for 35 minutes and flipped when done and did a low broil on the lower rack for a few minutes.  I did sprinkle cinnamon before baking.  Got to room temp before baking.   It is sweet but good.

Excellent recipe.  It was a hit at our brunch for 15.  I wouldn't change a thing, and didn't change anything.  Some reviewers suggested flipping the French Toast but it looked awful, so I put it back.  There was a lovely sauce under the toast - and the toast didn't harden on the bottom as a least one reviewer said was a problem.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks to the poster.

Made this for brunch and everyone loved it! After reading the reviews I subbed maple syrup for the corn syrup, used 4 eggs, used 3/4 c of brown sugar, added cinnamon to the top, and  flipped the toast over half way through bake time. I have to say I would have preferred a little more liquid because it was just a tad dry but that could have been because I used dense challah bread. Will definitely make again and adjust the liquid next time,.

This was easy to make. I read reviews on this so I made a few modifications; used 4 eggs, used lactose free milk, added extra teaspoon of Grand Marnier. I let this set overnight. Popped it on the oven without bringing it to room temperature and it was fine. I sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking.  It was prefect for my family. No leftovers.

I made it but I did change the brown sugar amount to 1/2cup and the corn syrup to a little less than 2 tbsp. I also cut more than 5 slices of bread. Baguette is the best and do cut off at least half the amount of crust and I arranged it in a 9" x 13 glass casserole dish and covered it with saran wrap. I also spooned the egg mixture over the bread about an hour or so after I placed it in the refrigerator. In the morning, I sprinkled cinnamon over the top of the bread and baked it for 25 mins. Very good recipe!

I made only one change. I used brioche bread.  Next time I would substitute maple syrup also. I loved the recipe and will make again. I had a little trouble with the caramel bottom. It became quite stiff and gooey when I tried to serve it. Maybe that's just what's supposed to happen. I'm going to try again because the taste was fantastic.

I have made this for every Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter morning breakfast for the past five years as well as any other occasion when I am serving brunch. Prepping the night before and only having to pop it into the oven makes it even better. The only change is that I use Panettone for the holidays and regular French bread during the summer. Everyone raves and I have passed the recipe on to a number of people. Not for calorie counters though.

Yummy! Made a 9x9 pan since we are a small family. Reduced quantities (3 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup brown sugar, etc.), also, as suggested in other reviews, used maple syrup and orange extract. Don't forget to flip the slices before putting in oven, which also adds some of the caramel to the 'top'.

Pretty much  just a glorified version of Grandma's  bread pudding. Nothing revolutionary there nor would I call it "French Toast". But as a bread pudding  variation? I'd make it again.

Wow - great - also omitted the corn syrup - plenty rich and sweet as is - adding Saigon Cinnamon about 3 tsp helps.  Also took the suggestion of inverting when serving since it looks great upside down. To accomplish this, I used round pyrex pie plates and cut the bread to fit - one plate serves 3-4 .  Just carefully loosen the toast around the corners and flip onto dinner plates (too hot to use a plate on top and flip) - also used my challah baked in a loaf pan. Any flavored liqueur works. Some topped with berries, whipped topping, powdered sugar but adding too much extra sweet stuff is not my preference and the caramelized crust makes a great presentation

At the first taste, my husband made the OK sign with his hand, and had a big smile on his face.  "This one's a keeper," he said.  

The orange is so important that I doubled the Triple Sec and put the zest of a big orange in the egg mixture.  DON'T cut the crusts off.  Like others, I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup, used regular butter,and doubled the vanilla.  I like lots of flavor.  

When you serve the toast, bottom side up, it's like a wonderful carmel roll  -- but even better!  We'll make this again!  And again!

I have made this three times, after seeing it in your magazine. I made it the same day, as each time we wanted it that morning. Twice I used Texas toast bread, which worked well.  I used Italian bead once, and forgot the orange liquor, I also didn't remember to cut the crust off.  I prefer the soft crust or I would cut the crust off of a crusty bread in the future.  It's better WITH the orange liquor.  I only used one TBSP of corn syrup. So far everyone here has LOVED this dish.  I plan to make this again and again.  Why go out for breakfast when this is SO Yummy and inexpensive to make??   I am contemplating  adding pecans to the brown sugar layer next time... The recipe doesn't say to turn it over or broil... If you check your oven temperature, and follow the directions, why complicate a good thing?

I made with a special twist for Valentine's Day. I used cookie cutters to make a top layer of hearts. The kids loved it. I also only had whole milk and used that (1 cup), 4 eggs, reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup as other reviewers suggested (plenty sweet enough) and didn't have Gran Marnier - so I just used a little OJ. I also didn't cut off crusts for bottom layer and just used regular bread. Just made it based on what I had. My top was very crispy before 35 minutes so keep an eye on it well before - maybe due to fewer eggs and less dairy.

I've been making this for my guests at my Bed & Breakfast for about 4 years,  it always comes out perfect.  I make my slices about 1 & 1/2 " thick and use a glass or pyrex dish.  I do add a slight more Grand Marnier tho, so far no complaints. Hugs to Shawn for the recipe..

I made this recipe.  Doubled the vanilla extract.  Substituted Triple Sec for the Grand Marnier.  The French Toast was a standard French toast with squishy insides.  I have.a personal preference for crispy outsides, which this recipe does not do.  For those who like the inside of the French Toast, it is a great recipe.  For those who like crispy outsides, this is not your recipe.

AMAZING. I took the advice of some others and only used 4 eggs and it was perfect. I actually even made it the night before so it sat all night and all day (breakfast for dinner) and it wasn't so good! I also didn't have any orange liqueur so I used about a tablespoon of rum infused with orange peels. Really good!!

Absolutely delicious!!!!  My family LOVES it!!  My only changes were based on recommendations.  4 eggs instead of 5.  I didn't have any unsalted butter so I used salted and decreased the added salt and I used regular table corn syrup.  Tell everybody up front - no syrup needed at the table! Yum, yum, YUM!!

We made this for Christmas morning and it was fabulous! Like some others, we used only 4 eggs, 1 tbsp corn syrup, and less brown sugar, otherwise sticking to the recipe. Of course it was sweet and very rich--not an every week meal, but perfect for a special occasion.

I'll definitely make it again...yummy! But French bread is small around here so I used 9 slices but will use 12 next time which will fill the baking dish. I did not cut off the edges...less work and makes it less mushy! Definitely use more Gran Marnier for more Brule flavor. Some chopped pecans or walnuts and cinnamon would be nice in the sauce, too.

-Don't cut the crusts off (who would do such a thing to good bread??)
-Increase the vanilla to 2 tsps and the orange liqueur to a full tablespoon
-Needs to cook for about 50 minutes for good browning and so the eggs custard within the bread is at the proper firmness

My family loves this! The only change I made was to not take the crust off the bread. 
I've made it probably a dozen times since I first found it. I tell folks about it all the time.

AMAZING. I made this for my fiance's birthday breakfast, and he was wowed. I didn't bother cutting off the crusts, and just used enough slices of bread to fill the pan. (Mine held about 9.) Used a splash more of the Grand Marnier, and made sure to do the flip-and-broil trick to achieve the crispy top like creme brulee. Tastes like a million bucks, and a great way to treat someone you love!

I've made this recipe so many times.  It's so yummy.    To make it go far I cut up my bread and made it look almost like a bread pudding and to change things up a bit I used Almond extract instead of Vanilla and used Amereto instead of grand mariner.

Very good recipe. The toast is tasty and rich and so convenient to make! Only issue is I found the sugar butter in the bottom prevent the bread from absorbing all the liquids so the pan is a little messy after baked and the presentation is not attractive. I made it a couple times until I found the 'make ahead French toast'. That is even more fluffy and have a crust on top, plus it yields a almost clean pan

This was REALLY good but beware ... it's also incredibly sweet, more like a dessert. If you are making this for guests don't plan on them eating more than one - maybe two - pieces. I used challah instead of the bread they recommended and left the crust on and it was delicious. Love that you can make this ahead of time and then just stick it in the oven.

Amazing! I used 3/4 c. dark brown sugar. 1 tbsp corn syrup and salted butter. Cooked to almost boiling for toffee like texture. Then added to it to bottom of glass pan and placed bread slices on top. With the custard I used 4 eggs, dash of salt, and Kahlua instead of brandy. Definitely let sit over night. So freaking good!

I loved it, but I love eggy dishes.   My family of one hubby and three teens were less enthusiastic.   They thought it was "too eggy".  Whatever, I thought it was yummy and rich and delicious.   So if you are a  fan of egg based dishes, try it out.

Second year I have made this for Mother’s Day. I had to double the recipe in order to make enough. I used 8 eggs because I didn’t want it to be eggy. I also decided to add a bit a cinnamon sprinkled all over. Instead of using the French bread from the bakery, I decided to buy panifique which I feel was way better (also got better reviews) I prefer to leave the crust. At the end, like most suggested, I did broil it. The few that had it the year before, said it was way better this time around. Good luck

This is so yummy! I've made this several times now and always get compliments on it. I've even posted a picture of the finished product on Facebook. The only change I make is to sprinkle a little nutmeg on top. Otherwise I think the recipe is perfect as written!

I've made a few times as directed and as casserole. It's fabulous. Don't skip the liqueur. Use extract if u must. It makes a difference in flavor and give it the brûlée effect

This is an amazing breakfast dish!! Can't believe how close this is to Crème Brulee!. I flipped it and put in broiler for 21/2 min. This is a must step at the end. Only change was I used Hawaiian Bread for a little more taste.

This is my recipe except for the bottom layer and I use 1/2 cup Grand Marnier. After sitting over night I remove bread to a griddle and cook it there. I set the buffet with powered sugar, fresh fruit , and different surups . It's a beautiful dreamscape for any special brunch. Great for holidays when you all want to eat at the same time. Plus bc it's made the day before it's super easy. I use French baguettes and not trim the crust . Beautiful and delicious!

A little soggy on the bottom so I flipped it and put it back in- besides that it's flavorful enough that something like syrup would only take away from the flavor!

We love this French toast! I usually make it for brunches or holidays. I've never used French bread for this recipe and have made it quite a few times now. I use Challah bread and cut all of the crust off. It's slightly sweeter and bakes up great. Thanks!

Delicious!  Everyone loved this and it  was gone fast.  Instead of bread slices, I left the crusts on the bread and cubed homemade French bread that was a few days old, perfect for using in a recipe like this.  Instead of Grand Marnier, I used rum, and I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the caramel while it was cooking.  I also added 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice to the egg mixture, and sprinkled a tad bit on top just before I baked it.  I baked it in a hot water bath, like I do with creme brulee or flan, so that the end result was like a custard bread pudding, but it still retained enough texture to have a French toast flavor to it.   Absolutely wonderful and I felt it was worth the effort, for sure.  :)

I think this recipe has some merit. I did make the substitutions recommended by several other. I did not cut the crust off the french bread. I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup. It was plenty sweet for my palate. I added the zest from one orange.  I think because of this the orange flavor was a bit too overpowering. After letting it soak up the egg mixture overnight I flipped each slice of bread prior to baking so that the saturated part (and some of the caramel) was facing up. This made for a nice crunchy crust! I baked it for 40 minutes. I didn't like how much egg spilled over the edges of the bread so a 9x13 seems like to big of a pan.  If I hadn't flipped then bread would have been very dry. If I were to try it again I would use only as much bread as I could comfortably snuggle into 9x9 so the egg couldn't spill over. I would pick one method of orange liquor or zest. I would try to flip before baking perhaps flipping the entire thing from one pan to another. I am glad some of you liked you like it. Sorry... the way the recipe is written and even with the suggestions given by other... this just wasn't our thing.

Oh, yes this was very good.  I did the suggested 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 TBSP corn syrup.  I loved this the first time I made it and the second time added sliced bananas and a sprinkling of cinnamon after pouring the sugar mixture in the pan. Don't put the orange liquour if you add bananas. If you like bananas foster, you will love this.  It was so horribly delicious, ecstasy in a pan....

A word on the bread.  I used Texas Toast bread that I let sit for a couple of days after poking a few holes in the bag. I left the crusts on.

After you cook this wait about 30 minutes before sinking your teeth into it.  It firms up as it cools and tastes much better than the hot soggy mess you'll get if you don't wait.


Other than that I followed the directions.  The hardest part is having to let it sit in the fridge over night.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very Yummy. (with some changes) I used about half the amount of butter and brown sugar, it was still plenty.  I also left out the corn syrup and orange liqueur. I didn't want to go buy it for one recipe.  I used orange zest instead.  Right before baking I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top and baked it the full 40 min.  It turned out perfect! This is definitely going in my recipe folder!

These were super easy to make. I love just popping something in the oven for breakfast. These were basically like dessert, though. They didn't need any syrup because the butter/sugar combo on the bottom is basically like a syrup sauce. It was very good and I'd make again.

This is SO yummy!! A friend and I made it for her son's wedding rehearsal dinner- for 40 people, with a small buffet of fruit & cream toppings, and it was a hit! I added a little cinnamon to the butter/sugar mixture, and to keep her budget intact, we substituted orange zest for the orange liqueur. It was still fabulous! DO be sure not to use more half n half than called for - or it will be doughy.

I love this recipe as does my entire extended family.  I made as written except I used maple syrup instead of karo syrup and did not remove the crusts from the bread. At the request of my granddaughter, the second time I made it I added a little over a cup of chopped pecans to the brown sugar and butter mixture.  The pecans are a great addition to an already excellent recipe. The second time I made this I used Reynolds non-stick foil in the pan and when it was completely baked I turned it upside down onto a cookie sheet.  This makes it much easier to serve.  Oh and the Grand Marnier...a must.

Made this for the first time for my Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit!!! I was even asked for the recipe. I did make one change, I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup.

This is a great recipe.  First time I made it I had cut the crusts off and the bread was a little thinner than 1".  I had soggy bread. I made it today for Mother's Day and used 1" French bread and left the crust on. Made a huge difference.  No soggy bread. Consistency was perfect.   I did however not melt the brown sugar enough before I put it in the pan. Came out with a gritty texture but flavourful. Next time I will dissolve the sugar better and flip the toast over to finish it off as others have suggested.  Thank you Sandi for submitting this. It is now my go-to recipe for brunches and special occasions.

I made this for Sunday brunch this weekend. I needed to make 2 pans of the french toast and so I used the recipe calculator to increase the servings & adjust the ingredients. What a fiasco. The brown sugar/butter mixture to pour on the bottom was just barely enough to cover the bottom of the pans. I used the amounts of other ingredients in the amounts the on-line calculator listed. It called for 9 1/4 eggs! The adjusted recipe made way, way too much egg mixture. I poured it in both pans to cover the bread & I still had enough left over to fill a 3rd pan. I refrigerated overnight & in the morning the bread was still sitting in the egg mixture to the level of half way up the bread. Since others had complained about it being too custardy, I poured off some of the egg mixture. It took longer to cook than the directions said but I watched it carefully for the extra 5 minutes. It was brown & puffy on top but when I served it, It had a layer of  "jelly" on the bottom. The adults ate it politely but my 2- twenty somethings only had a couple bites. And they are not picky eaters. They will & do eat almost anything & everything. NEXT TIME I will make much less of the egg mixture and probably turn the toast half way through so both sides get crispy.

I made this recipe for Easter brunch.  It was very yummy.  I did read reviews beforehand and made a couple changes but next time I will follow the recipe as is with the exception of leaving the crust on the bread and adding orange peel like the video indicated. I had made it with one less egg and only 1 cup of cream.  Didn't think it had enough egg mixture so that goes to show you sometimes you should just follow the recipe.  I didn't have any orange based liqueur so used just regular brandy.  The french toast came out crispy and yummy, Thanks Sandipants!

This recipie is outstanding ! Great reviews from my guests at Easter brunch. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and only added 3/4 cup brown sugar ands Tbs of maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Also I went a little heavy on the Orange liquor and it was delish!  I also layered some of the bread to fit more in and just cut into it like a bread pudding. It was perfect, thanks for a great recipie !

This recipe is easily enhanced by putting a layer of thinly sliced apples in the dish on top of the brown sugar/butter/syrup mixture - before you add the bread and custard mixture.  To keep the apples from oxidizing, I tossed them in the Grand Marnier, while I completed the other steps of the recipe.  I think of this as the Tarte Tatin version.  Next week, instead of apples and Grand Marnier, I'll use bananas and rum - for the Bananas Foster version.  I used home made sandwich bread and the one inch thick slices were a bit too thick - for my taste - and the next time will use thinner slices.  This is a superb recipe!

I used a loaf of pannetone and a roaster pan, so i increased the ingredients by 50%. Used the recommended substitution of maple syrup for corn syrup and subbed cointreau for the grand marnier. I also flipped the pieces over after baking and ran the pan under the broiler for about 5 minutes. To. Die. For.

Took the advice of others and cut brown sugar to 3/4 c, and corn syrup to 1 tbsp.  Packed pan tightly with Challah bread, left crust on.  Turned over slices when serving, no need for extra syrup.  One of the better french toast recipes I've found.

This was outstanding!  We substituted a loaf of wheat bread and cut it up into bite-sized pieces instead of whole pieces.  This is a winner.

This made a fabulous french toast for our family on Christmas morning. However, my son loves to cook and we made a few revisions that worked wonderfully. We did not bake it like a casserole -but only dipped our eggs and then pan-fried the toast. We went a little light on the sugar (1/2 cup), omitted the corn syrup (did not have any), and substituted orange flavoring for the orange liqueur. We used gluten free bread for those family members that are GF and then used regular bread for everyone else. The thing that made it special was my son also added about a tablespoon of pumpkin pie seasoning. It was awesome. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is one of my family's favorite breakfast recipies.  It seems that I never make it the same way twice.  There are a few things that I do consistently however... I make the Carmel sauce on the bottom per the recipe. I cut up the French bread into chunks. The egg mixture I have fun with. Today I used the 5 eggs, added a cup of milk plus a half a cup of eggnog because I had it in the house.  I added triple sec, again because I had it. I added vanilla a couple shakes of cinnamon and beat well with my whisk and poured over the bread making sure all was saturated well. Baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Cut into squares and "flip" it over when serving so the Carmel is on top.... Yum!!!!

I've made this several times using Portuguese sweet bread. The only change I make is not using the corn syrup. It turns out perfect as written. When serving, I invert the slices so the caramel is on top as others suggested.
My family loves it.

Very good, worth the effort.  I used Texas "toast" bread but next time I will definitely use thick sliced French (or Italian) bread.

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for. I always use the "Bread Machine Challah I" recipe when I make it. I use more bread and cut it in cubes instead of slices. Super indulgent but great for special occasions. A little butter brushed over the top for the last 10 minutes of baking sets it over the top. :P

I went ahead and used regular salted butter or margarine, and substituted dark rum.  Like others did I also substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup.  On the other hand, I used regular 2% milk for the cream and it has always turned out ok.  It's very rich, but very popular in our house.

A HIT!  It was so yummy and perfectly sweet.  The only difference in the recipe when I made it was using Triple Sec Orange Liqueur because it was all I had and the liquor store was closed.  I got a recipe request and will make it again.

I doubled the recipe and used maple syrup & a combination of Hawaiian rolls, pretzel rolls & french bread. Was well-received at a recent weekend at the Lake. Not as good the second day. Better eaten asap!

This recipe is very tasty, but I was looking for a recipe that was almost like a creme brulee bread pudding. We had it at a wonderful Sunday brunch at a New England inn on Valentine's Day. My moth has been watering for it ever since.

I think with a few changes this would have been better. A couple of tablespoons of sugar in the egg mixture, for one thing. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and coarsely chopped pecans on top before placing in the oven, which saved it from bland-dom. My biggest problem, however, was with the hard tackiness of the caramel layer. It was not soft and gooey but just a very tough layer that required a lot of dedicated sawing and tooth-chomping in order to eat it. Next time I'll probably just caramelize some sugar (see the Creamy Caramel Flan recipe on this website) and use that instead. I'm giving this recipe one more chance...good thing I scaled it down when trying it out!

So rich and easy! I needed more than 6 slices of french bread to fill my 9x13 dish.  I used about 12!  This is great with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a dollop of homemade whipped cream.

Family loved it! I will keep the brown sugar to a full cup next time, I reduced it as some  suggested but I felt it needed a little more. I used really stale (about a week old) french bread and milk and it turned out great!

This recipe works great with all kinds of bread.  I used a mixture of orange cranberry brioche and challah and it came out awesome!

You'll have to watch yourself with this recipe, it is dangerous. So easy to make and what a delicious treat. I made this for Christmas brunch and every single person went back for seconds, even when they were too full to eat any more!

This is fabulous!  I had this at a brunch with friends and we all had to have the recipe - it is Delicious with either the crust left on or removed- I also sprinkled a little bit of Cinnamon on top prior to baking!

This is definitely the best french toast! Easy overnight recipe. I  had it for a holiday brunch and people were loving it! It totally disappeared. I am making it for Christmas morning because the kids want it.....

I'm rating this a 5 for a simple and tasty recipe.  I had every thing in my pantry to make this after being gone for the weekend.  The only change was to use regular bread and I stacked them on top of each other.  So simple.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used Challah bread cut about an inch thick and it worked well (although if you like it eggier, I would use 6 eggs instead of 5).  I also used 1/2 cup of pecans on the bottom with the caramel sauce and it was yummy.

Everyone loved this french toast!  I used 2 day old French bread and doubled the amount of Grand Marnier and it turned out great!  I also sprinkled cinnamon on top and that added a lot of visual effect.

Nice recipe- but i'd make some changes if i made it again. For one, I cut my french bread into six slices- but it should've been eight. Also, i used about 2 teaspoons of grand marnier but still couldn't taste it. I'd use at least a tablespoon. Finally, i think it could use just a little spice- maybe some nutmeg or cloves?

This wasn't very tasty by itself; we ended up putting a bit of syrup on it.  It's already sweet enough without the syrup, but the taste of it wasn't right without some of it on top.  My husband told me not to make this again, but I'd like to mess around with it and tweak it.  I more than likely won't make it again, sadly.

Wow, this is super sweet and delicious!  I left some crust on the french bread and loved the crunchiness of it when the french toast came out of the oven.  This is a great dish to serve for company.

IS there something i'm doing wrong? I made this as a dessert for Vday. I used 10 sliced of French bread and there was just way too much of the egg mixture. My bread just floated to the surface. Was my bread supposed to absorb all the egg stuff, because it did not and when I put it in the oven to bake it was this soggy mess. As someone once reviewed, this is bread pudding.I finally gave up after 35 min in the oven. I took it out and moved the soggy bread onto a baking sheet and baked it for 15 mins on 350. That was much better, i will try again but i will not bake it in the mixture. I will remove them and bake on a baking sheet. Sorry, I think the recipe instractions are all wrong. The taste is great though.

I made this for our first Christmas morning with my new in-laws.  They loved it!  It was easy to make the night before and bake while we were opening our gifts.  My family loved it so much that I am now responsible for breakfast every year!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using a little more brown sugar and one less egg than recommended.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks for a great (easy!) recipe!

I put this together Saturday afternoon and was in a rush because we were having a party that night. As a result, I didn't get to read others' reviews so I made it as is. Served to our overnight guests with a side of goetta and it was a big hit. Was very tasty, though in the future, I would definitely add pecans and sprinkle a little cinnamon on top. And it did take 10-15 more minutes than stated.

We made this for a special Christmas morning breakfast. It's dynamite as far as being able to prepare ahead. All I did was take it out and set it on the counter before the gift-opening began and then popped it in the oven after. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to use maple syrup and I flipped over the toast mid-way, as well as broiling for a bit at the end. Also, I simply sliced French bread and squeezed in as much as I could in a 9x13 (without OVER-packing). It was more than just six slices, which was helpful since my crew all loved it and six slices would never have been enough. This is certainly a keeper and easy enough to make more often than just special occasions!

We didn't love this recipe. It was very eggy and I couldn't tell that the liqueur was even in it. Maybe will try again with some adjustments.  Does look beautiful though when made.

My family thought this was fantastic!  Put it together the night before and just popped it in the oven on Christmas Morning! I used the entire loaf of french bread, crusts on, cut into 1 inch slices.  Filled an 11x17 pan. I didn't change anything except did take another reviewer's advice and sprinked top with cinnamon and used real maple syrup instead of the corn syrup.

I made as recipe with very few changes.  I did flip the toast over to broil a little when it was done.  Good crispy ending.  I also did leave the crusts on.  After cooking for 50 minutes it still was mushy on the inside.  Next time I think I will not let it sit over night as in the recipe.  I loved it, with just a little powdered sugar and strawberries

My husband threw this together on Christmas Eve for Christmas morning.  He followed the recipe exactly, except for the orange liquor.  He subbed orange juice, but it didn't make a difference really. He also had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes, until it browned on top. It turned out FANTASTIC!!  Very rich, very yummy, very gooey and sweet.  We used fat free half and half, and it was still rich and delicious.  This one is a keeper!

My husband and I thought this was spectacular (the clean up, not so much ;) )!  I didn't have French bread on had, so I used some Sara Lee bread- which is pretty thick.  I left out the orange liquor, as I just don't have that laying around.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've had this twice now and it was delicious both times!  I didn't bother taking the crust off the bread and I think it was more delicious that way.  It also froze remarkably well!

this recipe wasn't for me at all.  i popped them out of the baking dish and put on plate sugar side up.  it was just too sugary for me.  i cooked for 45 minutes and broiled for 4 minutes, and the middle wasn't soggy, but it just tasted undercooked.  so undercooked eggy bread with a too sugary top just wasn't for me.

This French Toast is fantastic without altering the recipe.  I make it a day early and soak it overnight.  This has become one of my all time favorite recipes.  I usually have to make a double batch to satisfy my family.  Everyone loves it!!

This was a very good recipe and actually easy to make, but I was slightly disappointed that the orange flavor was so light.  I think next time I will double the amount of liqueur.  I also took the advice of prior reviewers and used 4 egss, 1 tbsp of maple syrup (instead of the corn syrup) and only half of the brown sugar.  My husband compared it to the custard-soaked french toast at one of our favorite local breakfast places.

one of the best french toast i've ever had!  i had to scale down the recipe a lot because i was only cooking for two. somehow i ended up with a lot of the "brown sugar syrup" so i decided to spread it to both sides of the toast.  i also used the convection feature in my mini-oven and baked it for 20 minutes.  the toasts came out nice and brown and the crust very crunchy. it was yummmm!!!

This recipe is to die for!!! You will never make any other french toast, ever! The moisture, flavor, warmth...it just melts in your mouth. I consider myself a very-very-beginner at cooking and mine came out perfect. Everyone wanted the recipe. I just soaked the toast in the mix and put them in the cooking sheets. I wouldnt suggest dumping the mix on top of the bread...too soggy!

My daughters both loved this recipe, as did I!  It was amazing and dessert like.  We had it for breakfast one morning and dinner the next night.  The only thing I will do differently next time is make double sauce for the bottom.  Yes, it was sweet, but it was so good to dredge the "toast" in.

Oh my was this good!  I used fat free half and half.  No booze, but added a little orange extract.  I didn't remove the crusts from the french bread... that seemed to be to much work:).  I squeezed in 8 pieces of bread into a 9x13 pan but did increase the half and half by about 1/2 cup and added 2 more eggs and 1/4 c more butter.  Will make this often when guests come into a town.  Thanks for this one...a keeper.

Wow, wow, and wow. I've tried very few recipes on this site and I must say this is one of my absolute favorite. I did change a few things on the recipe. I cut the bs to 3/4 cup, 3 xlarge eggs instead of 5, and 1 tbls of c syrup. Plenty eggy and sweet this way. I must say the refrigeration adds to the delicious taste of the french toast. If you're not into the puffiness of the recipe I would turn it over after 20min of cooking so that it carmelizes on both sides. I then put it in the broiler for a few minutes to get nice and brown and toasty. Simply marvelous.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING! One way to cut down on the calories is to use just 1 tsp of corn syrup and reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  We also used a tad more Grand Marnier!  By all means, turn the toast after 20 minutes to get a texture on the bottom and why not broil for the last few seconds to allow the sugars to carmelize?? These few altercations still yielded a deliciously sweet french toast which needed no additional syrup.  Try this one this weekend!

For Father's Day, I wanted to make the DH a knock out breakfast.  This delivered.  (Well, not with the kids.. But, we nearly took down the entire pan!) I used torn up Vienna bread (13 slices), and followed the common modifications (3/4 cup brown sugar / 1 tbs corn syrup / 4 eggs / cinnamon) Also, used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier.  Keep in mind nay-sayer's, this isn't "FRENCH TOAST" per se.  It's going to have a different texture.  But it's just phenomenal.  Actually, the word he used was  "Fantastic" (A rarity from his mouth). Served with bacon and fresh strawberries.

Wow, this was wonderful!  I made it without the Grand Marnier®, used doubled up regular sliced white bread, and heavy cream instead of half and half (it was what I had in the fridge already) and it was heavenly! Will definately make again and again!

I thought this recipe tasted wonderful and I loved the fact that all the prep was done the night before cooking so all I had to do was pop it in the oven in the morning. I used one less egg than called for, 3/4 C brown sugar, and maple syrup instead of Karo syrup.  I will definitely make it again for company or on special occasions (a bit too rich to make as an every day breakfast dish).

This is a very "custard-y" variation, hence the name.  So, it turns out a bit different than you may expect.  That said, it is easy and delicious.  It requires little prep and makes for an indulgent breakfast for houseguests.  But be forewarned, kids can think this looks a bit scary.

I understand what other reviews have said about the consistency being odd, but bottom line is this is DELICIOUS.  My fiance who 'doesn't like french toast' had seconds & asked when I'm making it again.  I didn't have any grand manier in the house so actually used cognac & it was delicious.  I also didn't trim the crusts, but let it soak for over 12 hrs & kept spooning more of the egg mixture on top of the bread.  Sprinkle some cinnamon on this & voila!  Yum!

wow, I really wanted this to be totally spectacular, but I was a little disappointed. It isn't bad, but I can make better stuff for guests, in my opinion.The reviews were so glowing, and this recipe is so famous, I figured it had to be awesome, but i thought it was a little greasy (too much butter), and the custard takes on a little bit of a strange texure in the bread (I used Challah). Its good if you need something flexible that can be done overnight, but I think regular french toast is tastier.

Great recipe, but not for everyone because it is sooo sweet. I used challah bread, which was awesome, and prepared it in the morning. You definitely don't serve this French toast with syrup, but you may want a dollop of whipped cream or some fresh raspberries to cut the richness. This was a hit with some and too much of a good thing for others, but I will make it again.

I received this recipe from an InnKeeper in Bar Harbor. Imagine my surprise when she gave me the allrecipes web site. This is very rich - but a wonderful change to 'regular' French toast. I made for friends from the UK, and they found it way too sweet - that's not as much of an issue with my Canadian friends :-).

My mom requested french toast for Mother's Day and I didn't want to make the same ol' same ol'.  I found this recipe and went with it.  I used Van de Kamp's "french toast" bread (basically thickly sliced egg bread) instead of french and kept the crusts on.  It was SOOOOO easy and my family LOVED it!  We were very full after one serving but it was delicious, and did I mention easy?  Thank you!!!

I really didn't care for the taste of this recipe.  I gave it 3 stars because my guests really liked it.  I didn't add the brandy, instead I added orange juice concentrate and a little bit of orange zest.

Very good. I followed the directions exactly and thought it was a bit soggy in the middle, but I am not much of a french toast person. I might follow another recommendation to use 2 day old bread next time. Made it for Christmas morning, it was quick and easy and it sure did dissapear!

I used regular white bread and I would still advise removing the crusts.  Delicious!  Many people asked for the recipe.  The brown sugar syrup on the bottom is great.  I melted it in the microwave, and used 4-5 T butter instead of 8.  Turned out wonderfully!

Wonderful flavor.  Has a definite flavor of creme brulee.  No need to add anything else to this dish except maybe some strawberries on the side.  This also feeds more than expected.  Definitely will be making again.  Maybe will try cubing french bread instead of using slices.  Thanks for a great post!

This was really good but REALLY sweet (and I cut the sugar in half) directions weren't clear so i cooked the sugar mixture until it boiled which made it turn out similar to toffee yum.  Im not a fan of sweet things but could handle this every once and a while, whole family LOVED it.  As for cleaning easy peasie, and we let it set for a couple hours before cleaning the pan.  I would definatly recommend cutting the sugar and corn syrup in half, at least.  But will make this again because it was a big hit w/ everyone else.

I made this for easter brunch! Total hit...my only addition was a sauce made out of strawberries & a little suger. It cut down the richness and added an extra demention of flavor.

I was going to follow this recipe but found I didn't have the right ingredients and I had to make more than just 6 slices.  I used regular butter, no corn syrup, about 10 slices of bread, 2 C. half and half and 6 eggs.  I didn't have Grand Marnier, so I used peach schnapps, about 1/4 C.  Boy, was it good!  All my guests loved it, too! I've made it several times. One of these days I'll make it your way.

We make overnight french toast every year for Christmas breakfast.  The taste of this was right on for creme brule.  A little sweet for my taste buds, but the kids and hubby enjoyed it.  Next time I will reduce the sugar/corn syrup amount.  Thanks for a keeper!

My guests LOVED this dish, but I didn't care for it.  I was WAY too sweet for me.  I didn't use as much of the egg mixture (I thought it would be too  much) but the extra actually becomes a custard on the bottom kind of like creme brulee.  I would make it again upon request, but for just myself and my husband, I think we'll stick with something less sweet and less rich (it's tough to eat more than one slice).

this was well worth the time and preparation.  I substituted 1/2 t. orange extract and 1/2 t. brandy extract for brandy based orange liqeur, and it came out wonderfully.  Soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I definitely will make again.  a new favorite!  Family loved it and ate every last morsel.

My only complaint is that this didn't make more. I'll have to double or triple the recipe next time as it was a HUGE hit. I didn't remove the crusts from the bread at all and I used amaretto in place of the brandy. Very good, but VERY rich. Only for special occasions.

I made breakfast for dinner the other night and these came out wonderful. The only thing I will do next time is line my baking dish with foil because it can be a little tricky cleaning your dish afterwards. I loved the taste of the french toast and so did my daughter!

It was very simple and good.  I didn't care for the eggy-creamy stuff that didn't soak into the bread - hence the 4 stars.  If I took that off and just ate the bread, it was excellent.  My parents seemed to love it.

I made this for a bunch of friends and it was great!  SO nice to have it all done the night before so you can just enjoy the time with your company instead of being in the kitchen cooking.  We topped with fresh cut strawberries.  After splitting the dish 5 ways we didn't eat for hours and hours.  Very filling!  Just great.  One thing.  Don't expect it to LOOK like Creme Brulee.  The bread is on top of the cream part so it doesn't crisp up like creme brulee.  I suppose if you flipped it it would, but that seems tricky.

This was sooo good. We loved every bite of this wonderful breakfast treat. The only thing that I added was a little cinnamon to the egg mix. Other than that I left it just like it was. Thanks for a scrumptious breakfast/brunch delight.

taste was good, but the bread turns into soft custard (I'm sure some people like it this way). I think I might try it again with a little less egg mixture.

This made a great Christmas morning breakfast.  I used a whole loaf of Challah bread (enough to fill the 9x13 inch pan) and left most of the crust on.  I also omitted the brandy and used fat-free half-and-half.  I used five large eggs, and did not think it was eggy or gooey (maybe the extra bread I used soaked up the mixture).  Sweet, rich, like a bread pudding.

I made this recipe this year for the morning after Thanksgiving before we decorated our house for Christmas, and it will now be a yearly tradition.  Since I don't keep orange brandy around (and wouldn't use the rest if I bought some for this recipe), I mixed one part orange oil to two parts rum, then used 1 tsp in the place of the orange brandy.  It turned out great!

This was great and I'd say quite easy to make since you prepare it the night before.  The hint of orange is just right.  I didn't change a thing - well actually I was lazy and didn't remove the crusts, but that seemed to be OK.

I loved this, my husband thought it was OK.  He perfers the more basic french toast.  The flavor was delish.  It was sweet, you don't need butter or syrup with these.  I used texas toast, next time I will try the french bread.  It is an excellent breakfast for a holiday.

Delicious and easy to make.  I used day old French bread which made it easier to cut off the crusts.  This dish was a big hit at Mother's Day brunch!

I used 4 slices of white bread from my bread machine and left the crusts on, regular instead of salted butter, skim milk in place of the cream, and amaretto instead of orange brandy. We enjoyed it, however I did find it a bit too wet and eggy tasting. Also it was a bit of a pain to bring it to room temperature before baking it. I reheated the leftovers the next day with foil over the top for about 30 minutes and it tasted just as good as the day before. My husband liked this recipe better then the usual pan fried french toast but I prefer my usual type.

This is very good - to me it tastes exactly like creme brulee. I used triple sec - didnt have orange brandy - fantastic - would make alot. Might try Ameretto next time! Served with bacon on the side.

I made this for Easter brunch this year and it was wonderful!  My whole family wanted the recipe.  It was very easy and remember you won't need syrup it's already in the recipe.

Wonderful and so easy.  Made this the last two Christmas's the day before and put in oven in the morning and after we were done opening presents, it was ready.  My family loves.

Very, very rich, but very good.  This is something that would be nice to serve on Christmas morning.

I didn't have the brandy so I tried 1 tsp lemon extract. The subtle citrus flavor is a nice touch to this delicious recipe.
