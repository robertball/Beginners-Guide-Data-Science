Easy to make recipe.  I also fried up onion chunks and sweet potato slices about 1/4 thick that came out very nicely.  I fried the vegetables first and then the shrimp so I would not have a cleaner taste for the veggies.  I also divided the batter, one for veggies one for shrimp.

I make tempura shrimp alot and I usually just use boxed tempura batter, but i was out so i thought i would try to make it from scratch. i went by the directions exactly and i had the same problem that others had. the shrimp never turned brown and were soggy no matter what i did. the flavor of the batter is good, but this is not a keeper.

This was so GOOD! I lived in Malaysia for many years, and this tastes exactly like how they would make it in local Japanese restaurants. But maybe what I like so much about it is about how easy it is to make, AND cheap. I bought shrimp on sale a couple weeks ago and its been sitting in my freezer with nothing to do. The ingredients were all on hand it it just turned out puffy, golden and crispy! Beautiful! Thank you!

Used this tempura recipe yesterday because I could not find my usual tempura recipe.  The batter was bland and not crispy at all.  Very disappointed.

I did not use an egg but substituted for 1tbs baking powder. I found this idea on a vegan website. I made veggies for me and shrimp for the DH.I made him shrimp tempura sushi. I used coconut oil and my cast iron skillet. This recipe was awesome!! I flipped my veggies & shrimp in order to get a nice golden color on both sides.

This was pretty bad. It tasted like shrimp wrapped in egg white. I stopped making them in the middle of cooking and used the shrimp with another recipe. This recipe is a waste of time.

I had 2 pounds of shrimp to cook so I doubled the recipe exactly. I used my deep fryer and kept the temperature at 375. When the shrimp came out they were delicious and crispy for a minute or two, then they began to get soggy. I had to do several batches so most of my shrimp were doomed to sogginess. I solved the problem by quickly dipping the battered shrimp in Panko bread crumbs before frying. These stayed crispy and were very good, but they were not exactly tempura shrimp anymore. This is a good recipe if you do a small amount and be sure to serve it immediately.  I’m not sure, but I think this will be true of any tempura shrimp recipe.

Like this batter because I didn't have to put any ice cubes like some other tempura batter recipes require.  Otherwise, the recipe is excellent and a keeper.  Oh, last thing, I'd add a little more salt for added flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

For a bit more flavor I used 1/4 tsp each of salt, pepper and onion powder. I was using it on veggies so wanted a bit of flavor in the batter.

This was a failure for me.  No flavor, not crispy, didn't stick to my shrimp.  I used my Fry Granpappy so the oil was fresh and hot.  I fried up some fresh broccoli, vidalia onions, and zucchini along with the shrimp.  I didn't overcrowd the fryer.  The batter never looked like it was done, I expected a bit of browning, but none occurred.  I've had so much better, I will not be making again.

because of previous reviews complaining about blandness, i added some black pepper and Old Bay seasoning to the flour mixture. 
I wasn't too concerned about the batter not browning, as i've never seen brown tempura in an authentic restaurant. 
Still it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. i fried it nice and hot, it wasn't greasy or soggy, but just not crispy. i wonder if a quick dip in panko after the batter might help satisfy our crispy cravings?

Five stars for the batter recipe. I didn't use this with shrimp, I actually used it with sliced zucchini. I added a little more salt to the recipe along with a heavy dose of garlic powder and some pepper. It works great on vegetables and gives just the right texture and flavor. I've made it twice in the last week!

I tried...I really tried. First batch came out very, very blah and not crispy at all. I added pepper, salt and sriracha sauce and a bit more corn starch. That crisped it up a bit and added flavor. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Batter made exactly as in recipe, Canola oil, used Jumbo shrimp so I butterflied them to cook faster.  Recommend highly.  I turned shrimp once as they cooked.  Golden brown all over.  Placed them on paper towel lined plate in a 185 deg. oven to absorb oil, and keep warm while fixing my rice casserole in the microwave.

The batter amount is generous.  

Will make again, and plan also to use this batter for fried filets.
