I've only eaten Red Velvet Cake once in my life and it was well...bad. I thought I would try one anyway and see if I liked it or not. I really liked the cake part of this recipe. It was moist and had a nice flavor to it. The frosting was really sweet and kind of grainy, the grainy could be my fault I've never made a cooked frosting so I'm not sure if its supposed to be that way or not. I was also kind of confused about how much sugar was supposed to go into the frosting. The ingredient lists 2 cups but the directions say 1. So I used one then tasted but I thought it wasn't sweet enough so I added the other cup of sugar. It ended up being to sweet once I put it on the cake. But I don't know if it was supposed to be 1 or 2. I'll probably make the cake part again but use Ricks Special Buttercream Frosting for the frosting part. The frosting wasn't bad it was just not for me.

This is the original recipe for Red Velvet Cake, I rec'd my recipe in 1963.  I have made it numerous times...the icing is luscious.  You really have to let the butter and sugar mix until there isn't any grainy bits left in the icing and then beat in the flour/milk mixture.  I like making this as a xmas dessert and decorating the top of the cake with  marzipan  pointsettia leaves and flowers -not the real ones as they are a bit poisonous.  Just mix some food colour into your marzipane - yes you might have to make some using almond paste.  and then make a template of pointsettia leaves and flowers and have some fun.  You can make a large decorative cake and use a large flower for it and then make a 9 x  13  cake and make a smaller flower for each slice.

This is a disaster! I spent so much time with the many steps of making this, the directions are not clear as far as if it should be mixed with a beater or how many strokes if it is meant to be stirred only. Anyways, the frosting is horrible. My cake looks awful and the frosting is nothing more than butter with grainy sugar. Find another recipe if you value your time.

Love it!  I discovered red velvet cake while living in Atlanta.  Can't find the real deal now that 
i'm living in Mass.  THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!  Made it for the family... every-one loved it.

This recipe is all you need. I know people are always trying to change their recipes to "make it better" but don't! All you need to know is with the step with the red food coloring and adding cocoa to make a paste. Add cocoa until there is a paste. The recipe called for 2T, I definitely had to double the cocoa (heaping tablespoons) to get a paste. Just a tip, use it or not ;P Great recipe, got RAVE reviews!

Important,in the original recipe it calls for the cake to have split layers, it should 6 layers from 3 cakes. I see some say it is dry. It is anything but dry with the 6 layers. It is better to let the cake set for a day. I fix this cake with double icing, that way I can ice it between layers and on the sides

This is the red velvet cake that mymom made in the 60's for Valentine's day and Christmas! Love, It is definately notthe texture of a box cake if that is what you are used to. This scrumptious frosting takes me back.....feel like that little girl again eating mom's best cooking. Perfect.

I have not made the cake yet. I have a couple of questions please,  the ingredients say 1 & 1/2 cups of white sugar 
and  a few ingredients down the list says 1 cup sugar.
so does the recipe require 2 & 1/2 cups of regular sugar? 
or does it require both sugar  confectioners sugar?

please let me know which or both and how much of each. 
thanks
