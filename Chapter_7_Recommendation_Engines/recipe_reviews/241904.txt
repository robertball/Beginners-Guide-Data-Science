Recipe calls for way too many breadcrumbs. Use 1/2 cup max or you will likely have to add milk or sour cream. We also flash fried some salmon in the bacon grease to add protein and make it more of a main dish and instead of using seasoned breadcrumbs we added smoked paprika garlic powder and salt and pepper.

This turned out really good. (See photos). Will definitely make it again! Didn t have the brand named items but substituted brands worked just fine. Even had some leftover pulled pork that I mixed in with the bacon and crumb topping.
