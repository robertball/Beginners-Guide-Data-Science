A nice change of a salad for us.  This was the first time I recall purchasing sprouts.  I used broccoli sprouts rather than alfalfa sprouts as that is what they had at the Farmer's Market.  I mixed the salads up early in the day and covered with plastic wrap for later in the evening.  Therefore, we didn't add the salad dressing until right before eating.  This is a pretty salad that I would make again for us and would be a nice presentation for company.

SO GOOD!
I left out the onions because I didn't want to deal with it. Might try adding them next time.

Sprouts are a powerhouse of nutrition and so easy to grow yourself. I made some slight changes only because of preference and what I had. I used clover sprouts I grew myself and dressed my salad with a creamy vinaigrette dressing because I don't care for ranch. I couldn't find honey glazed almonds and used candied walnuts instead. Fabulous salad and healthy too! Thanks Apple Jacks!
