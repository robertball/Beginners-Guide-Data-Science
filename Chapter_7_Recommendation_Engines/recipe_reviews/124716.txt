Excellent soup-I've made this MANY times! I do not add the bacon but do add a dollop of sour cream when serving(& sometimes crushed tortilla chips). You can easily make this low-fat too, using fat-free refried beans, 2% cheese, & fat-free sour cream. Very tasty!! Thank you!!

This was excellent! I used five slices pre-cooked bacon (microwaved) and a little more garlic than called for. (Sauteed the veggies in two tablespoons butter.) Had to make a second batch to combine with the first as the recipe as written serves four, and it didn't look like enough for 4-5 people. We like leftover soup. Very tasty!

It was pretty good. I used real garlic instead of the powder. I thought it was a tad bland even with using two cloves of garlic. I added some cumin and chili powder and that really helped. I think it would be really, really good with some fresh chopped cilantro on top. Thanks for the easy recipe.

This was super easy, and the whole family liked it. But it doesn't make a lot, so you may want to double it. I used the crock pot refried beans recipe from this site.

So sneaky - it's like eating chips and dip for supper (at least that's what my husband insists). VERY tasty. My 3 & 5 year-olds love it to.

This was delicious!  I added some turkey bacon and it turned out great!  My husband loved it too.

This is so much better than it seems it would be! I used bacon bits, but next time I might use bacon strips & remove before serving. I also added a can of rinsed pinto beans- gave more substance to the soup. (although it's good without- just thin.) Flavor is really great. You can add a dollop of sour cream to your bowl & mix it in, or not. Great both ways! And SO easy! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I made this like a tortillia soup & I fried up my own corn tortillia strips & put them in the bottom of the bowl before the soup. I put 2 cans of chicken broth & added cilantro. Dont leave out the hot pepper sauce, use plenty, it what makes this sooo yummy. I topped the soup with cheese, avocado, & sour cream.

My 11 year old loved this soup, as did I. Added some left over white corn and a can of drained rinsed dark red kidney beans for just a little more texture and flavors. I used a medium heat salsa which gave it a little heat. Nice! Will make again...an easy and tasty soup! Thanks!

Similar heartiness as a black bean soup, but creamier. I added jalapeno and green pepper to the saute mix. At then end i stirred in shredded chicken. Garnished with tomato and the cheese.

This was just "average" for me.  My other family members liked it a bit more than me, but no one really "loved" it.  I doubled the garlic, but it didn't seem to do enough for the flavor.  It tasted just like refried beans to me.  The bacon taste was not really noticable.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Grace!

Pretty good soup . . .and soooo easy.  I added a chopped orange pepper since I had it, and after reading the reviews, I tossed in some seasoned salt and chili powder with the veggies to help with the blandness people complained about.  I also added minced garlic at about 2 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients to the veggies.  I dumped in a little more hot sauce than planned, but it worked just fine, and it wasn't too hot.  This doesn't make a ton of soup, but I think it will work fine for bf and I.  Very good, thanks!

This was not bad, but not great either. We have had bean soups that we prefer over this one. I will probably not make this again.

I was skeptical, but this was delicious.  I made it without the picante at first (on accident) and then added it later, but it was great both ways.
