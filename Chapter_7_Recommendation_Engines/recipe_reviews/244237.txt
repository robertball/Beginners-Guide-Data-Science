I add one tablespoon of lemon juice to a cup THEN add milk to equal a cup. Som recipes need exact measurements. I use the lemon for baking, but found that vinegar works well too. I am going to soak the chicken I am frying today in buttermilk made here before breading.

Thank you so much for this.  My friends and family love my cole slaw, but I end up with a carton of buttermilk left over since my recipe only calls for up to 1/2 cup (doubled recipe) . Thank you again for this shortcut.

As I use only fresh lemons, it may not have enough of the acid level to change the milk.  I added a tsp of Rice vinegar so as not change the culture too much.  I used this to soaked my green tomatoes and tomatillos in prior to frying.  I was very pleased with the quality and taste.

Itwice the milk d=did not become thick or curdle. I used 2%
milk. 
full fat milk with one tablespoon of white vinegar  made
very good substitute buttermilk.

This worked better with warm water. So, do you put it in the refrigerator to have it cold for biscuits? Will it still work as buttermilk after being chilled?
