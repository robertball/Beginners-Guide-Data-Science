I was really nervous about making this recipe because my husband is not a big fan of sweet stuff.  Well, I'm happy to say we both LOVED this!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I only added 1 cup of ketchup as per other reviewers suggestions and than I added a 1/4 cup of Bull's Eye bbq sauce because I was worried it would taste to "ketchup tasting" as other reviewers said. The intersting thing about this recipe is that is tastes awesome and you would never be able to tell what it is that tastes so interesting.  I had my husband brush this on chicken wings that we grilled and they reminded me of the wonderful taste of duck when they serve it with a fruit glaze/sauce.  I used  seedless blackberry preserves.  We are having a bbq on JLu 4th and are planning on serving this!  I can't wait to see peoples reactions when they ask what is in it.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!  Try it...you will not be disappointed.  It is NOT too sweet......just YUMMY!

HI EVERYONE! YES THIS IS MY RECIPE, BUT I FOUND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE SEEDS SIEVE THEM OUT OF THE JAM  OR USE JELLY
PRESERVES. EVERY SUMMER I MAKE MY OWN PRESERVES  USING LOW SUGAR AND MORE FRUIT. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT SOME JAMS OR JELLYS MAY NOT BE AS FRUITY AS HOME MADE PRESERVES.
 IF YOU PREFER A HOTTER SAUCE ADD A COUPLE OF DASHES OF EITHER TABASCO SAUCE OR THAI HOT CHILE SAUCE  OR CHILPOTLE HOT SAUCE.
YOU MAY ADD FRESH BLACK BERRYS TO THE FINAL SAUCE   THESE  ARE A FEW THINGS I HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH  AND
 DONE TO THIS RECIPE.
i AM GLAD EVERYONE LIKED IT

My family loves this sauce.  To combat the excess in ketchup, just add more preserves and we also add a little honey.  This is our favorite barbeque sauce.

Similair to my Blackberry Barbecue sauce , except I use blackberry Jelly ( no seeds), double all the amount , add 2 tablespoons of celery seeds and cook it 8-10 hours in a crockpot and store it in the fridge for future use. Excellent!

I thought this was ok, but to be fair: I'm not into bbq sauces. But my husband is another story. He totally loved this and (this is major): he wants only this bbq sauce for pork/chicken/ham/duck/turkey, and I had to stop him from eating this out of the bowl! Bye-bye Open Pit, Famous Dave's, and everything else that comes bottled in the stores. I used preserves like the recipe calls for; be sure not to use "jam" or "jelly".

Being from Memphis, BBQ sauce is a big deal.  This is better than the best restaurants in town.  I recently used this sauce in a Sunday School BBQ contest and it was the hands down favorite.  The blackberry really gives it a great flavor.

I used this yummy sauce with Ken Heffner's recipe for Barbecue Baby Back Ribs (on this site).  What a wonderful combination!  My guests are still moaning with pleasure!

We loved this! I marinated the chicken overnight in a McCormick's Mesquite marinade. We had this for a large group for July 4th, and everybody loved it. More like a treat than a main course!!!

This bbq sauce was perfect on the beef ribs I cooked for my husband's birthday. They were sweet, tangy, and had a kick of spice at the end. I added a little more cayenne pepper and seedless blackberry jam because as written it had a little too much ketchup for my taste. Also used white wine vinegar instead of red (only because I didn't have red).  I will definitely use this recipe again. Can't wait to try it on chicken! Thanks so much for sharing.

I did enjoy this sauce, but I had to alter.  We like our sauce more bbqey?, so I added some onion and garlic powder and a little liquid smoke.  We loved the end result almost better than my homemade regular bbq sauce.  I will probably make more, because I have a ton of blackberry jam that didn't set up, so now I have a use for it!

Love this sauce!  We add some garlic and onion powder.  It's awesome on pork ribs.  The sauce tastes "OK" when you first make it but, when it's grilled (or broiled I imagine) the sugar carmelizes and it becomes fruity, sticky, BBQ wonderfulness!

there was no taste of Blackberry till I ended up adding 3 jars of it. This site is bad about reviewers giving 3 stars and still saying they don't like it. Call it what it is people!!! This is "no" BBQ Sauce.

I decided not to use this as a basting sauce but as a dipping sauce for homemade chicken strips. My husband and I both loved it! I'm definitely going to make it again.

I have been looking everywhere for a blackberry sauce; my favorite rib place in North Conway, NH uses a blackberry BBQ and it is out of this world. This fit the bill!
I did add a little salt and pepper and onion powder, and used seedless blackberry jam because that was what was available at the grocery store.
I added this sauce to the crock pot with a rack of pork baby back ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

Snaps for Ina! This is the best sauce ever, so much better than anything out of a bottle. I used regular mustard because thats what I had and it was amazing. I used it on grilled chicken and everyone loved the fruity flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This is really good and i'm more than happy with the results. We actually have this jar of blackberry jam that no one would touch for quite sometime now. The bbq sauce is a great way to add zing to your meal without your family guessing what your secret ingredient is. Here are the changes I made: reduce  ketchup to 1 cup, instead of vinegar i added 2 T white wine (bec it is what i have at hand), add 2T each of freshly ground ginger and garlic, add a dash of paprika, since i dont have mustard powder i used 2 T prepared mustard, used hot sauce instead of cayenne, and added a dash of italian seasoning. I used this sauce to baste the baked baby back ribs i prepared for a family dinner following the baby back ribs recipe submitted by Ken Heffner.

This sauce was excellent! My husband made it and changed the recipe a little. We skipped the brown sugar, increased the vinegar and added worcestershire sauce. This cut the sweetness a little bit. It was soooo delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent sauce! I used a seedless all fruit preserve and substituted 2 tsp worchestershire sauce since I didn't have any cayenne pepper. Quick, easy, poured it over chicken and let it bake. Used what I had left to brush over burgers the next day. An all time fav!

This recipe is so easy and tasty.  I threw everything in the crockpot and let it simmer for a few hours.  I have also used marionberry jam, with success.  I added just a small squirt of bbq sauce I had on hand, but it was surprisingly good without it too.

I think this sauce is versatile and pretty awesome.  I serve it to the kids and uninitiated who cannot handle the "She Devil" BBQ sauce I make on ribs and such.  I've made it for about 3 years now, and keep coming back.

Excellent!  Entire family, guests included, loved this sauce.  Instead of using it as a BBQ I saturated a cut of beef in the slow-cooker, and it turned out quite nicely.  I added a little garlic and ginger as well.  Even the folks who are not big fans of beef had seconds!  Next time I think I will use a pork butt to slow cook because it isn't quite as stringy after a whole day of cooking.  Thanks for this unique and tasty recipe!

Really good sauce! I did substitute 1/2 cup of the ketchup with my husbands favorite VERY spicy bottled BBQ sauce and omitted the cayenne.  Normally no one else in the family can eat his sauce, but it gave a nice kick to this, that everyone enjoyed (5 stars with this change!) Cooked it about 15 minutes before basting meat to blend flavors and thicken it up.  Used on ribs, would also be great on chicken.

I love blackberries and love the idea of bberry bbq...I tried this recipe..but of course I couldn't leave it alone...I added more cayenne and mustard powder..I doubled the batch and also added two huge cloves of pressed garlic,liquid mesquite smoke and some bbq rub spice that I had.  I tried it on western cut pork ribs...Outrageous..

This recipe was way to sweet for my personal taste.  Being from Texas I prefer a tangy bbq sauce.  My husband however loved it.  Go figure....

A friend gave me some homemade preserves, so I found this recipe.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I omitted that and added 2 tsp worcheshire sauce per another reviewer.  I only used 1 cup ketchup and added a tiny bit of dijon mustard.  Very delicious.  You have to really like sweet barbeque sauce though.  Thanks!

This is delicious and so easy!  Next time I'll try cutting back on the ketchup a little so the berry flavor comes through more.

I am so glad I tried this bbq sauce.  I did have to change a few things because of my food allergies, but it was wonderful. I love sweet stuff, but I didn't find it overly sweet. A perfect balance.  Thanks for the recipe - its so hard to find things now that I can eat!!!

This is lip smacking good! I did however downsize the catsup by half. Was great on grilled chicken. Nice change of pace. Really unique. My girlfriend Brenda could not stop licking her fingers. I did not tell her WHAT was in it until AFTER she ate seconds.

This was a good sauce, I was hoping for more blackberry flavor but I used sugar free blackberry jam. I don't know if I would make it again.

This sauce was a complete hit!!  I followed the recipe as written with one exception: I had every type of berry preserve except for blackberry.  So, I used up three left over jars of random berry preserves.  The sauce definitely tasted too ketchupy before it was cooked, but after the ribs came out of the oven I couldn't taste the ketchup at all.  I will definitely make this again, and try it with the blackberry preserves next time!

To die for!!! I have never made home made BBQ sauce and I was so thankful that I chose this recipe to start!! It is soo delicious and the flavoring is great!! I added a few things though to give it an added kick: paprika, hot sauce, salt and pepper, real mustard (not powdered) and 2 gloves of crushed garlic. It wasn't too sweet and it added the right tang that I wanted, my boyfriend who rarely compliments me on my cooking said it was really good. Yay! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good sauce!  I used it as dipping sauce for Pistachio Crusted Chicken (from this website).  I substituted cooking sherry for the red wine vinegar, although I wouldn't recommend doing that.  I had to add some extra blackberry jam to balance out the sherry.  I'm looking forward to making this sauce again!

This sauce is ok, but not anything special.  I probably won't make again.  It just didn't have that ZING I was looking for.  Every once in a while when I took a bite, I could taste the sauce, but not like I wanted.  Thanks for the recipe, Ina.

I did not care for the fennel flavor, as I found it to be a little too overwhelming. Maybe using an entire bulb, and substituting anise (which I think is the same thing) is behind this, but I am not sure. My family seemed to like the burgers, but they said they could not really taste much. Overall, I would not invest the time in this recipe again, nor would I use it as a base to try to come up with something better.

I made this recipe and changed a few things about it...I did not add the brown sugar or vinegar because you have both in the ketchup, blackberry preserves and mustard. However, I used some Jalapeno Mustard and 2 drops of Haberno Sauce and then add some dried onions and fresh garlic to the recipe.

I cooked it on low to mix everything together and bring the flavors together. It did not come out sweet, but had a bit of snap and zing to the recipe.

I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce because it was too ketchupy for my taste.  Adding more blackberry preserves helped get the flavor closer to what I like.  Very easy and tasty!

OMG this is AWESOME, with just a few changes. I used only 1 cup of ketchup, no brown sugar, about 1/4 cup of Bourbon, worcestershire sauce, prepared yellow mustard, cut up two little green onions added some garlic powder and poured it all over pork baby back ribs in my slow cooker. It was not too sweet and a little tangy and you can't beat bourbon for ribs!!!!!!! Can't wait to try them!!!!!

This was for pulled pork.  I didn't have blackberry preserves but I used cherry (so I guess... Cherry BBQ Sauce!) but other than that I followed the recipe.

This was really good.  I used apple cinder vinegar and didn't have mustard and it was still good.  It did taste to ketchuppy  before cooking.  Once I had grilled it the taste was better than store bought.  It tasted great cold the next day to.  I will definitely make this again.

Really good! I made this for lamb. Scaled the recipe way down (serving 2) and it still seemed to work out.   I didn't do the cayenne (didn't have any). Substituted apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar. Used sugar free seedless blackberry preserves, but also threw in 5 blackberries (mashed up) so it was a bit grainy-er. Cut the recommended ketchup in half as well.  Edited to add: Did it again without the cayenne for grilled fish (salmon and tuna). This time, substituted splenda for the brown sugar. It was slightly better on the tuna than the salmon, but really good either way. I reserved half to put on top after it finished cooking.

I used Chinese five spice since I didn't have cayenne pepper to give it some spice. This worked well since it is an ingredient used in plum chicken. I cut down on the ketchup since others suggested it and was glad I did. I also added some honey as well. It turned out really well. My family enjoyed it.

Substituted apple cider vinegar for the red wine, since that's what I had.  It was tasty, but a little sweeter than I like my bbq.  Next time I'll use more heat and less sweet!

I used this recipe on Easter with a 2.5 lb pork tenderloin in the crockpot.  My family didn't hate it but they didn't love it either.  It very well may have been the pork tenderloin, or perhaps I screwed up when I doubled the sauce--but for some weird reason the sauce had an odd aftertaste--a little bitter????? It was very easy to make and considering there are so many rave reviews, I will make it again!

Very tasty. I added some chopped garlic and used this on cornish game hens. Plan to use the rest for beef ribs. It is better the next day after the flavors have had time to marry and mellow.

Not bad, not fantastic. The best part about the jelly was telling people that it was in there and seeing their reactions! I used a reduced sugar berry blend jelly, and it was quite good. I also used homemade ketchup, which may or may not have affected final result. I'll probably try it again with store-bought ketchup, just to see the difference. Thanks for sharing!

I've made it several times, and I always make changes. I always exchange the brown sugar for maple syrup and blueberry honey. I only use 1/2 the ketchup mixed w/broth/sauce from slow cooking pulled pork, once I remove the fat by chilling it. My pulled pork always goes into slow cooker w/one ea sweet and red onion, and sliced green pepper rings. I love layer upon layer of flavor. I add a couple Tbsp of organic butter, a couple Tbsp Dijon mustard, and Instead of red wine vinegar, I use Frambois raspberry vinegar and add 1/2 pint of raspberries and crush them w/a potato masher. All the while bubbling and reducing. I spice and balance w/a bit of dry mustard, onion pwd, celery salt,  a pinch of cayenne, a splash of real lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and worcestershire.  When it's reduced and a bit thicker, I strain the raspberry seeds out, return to pan and drop in a good handful or more of dried blueberries and cherries, continuing to reduce and balance. I've bottled and given away. A wonderful start to some fabulous fruited BBQ sauce.

I found this recipe very useful for using up leftover jars of  dark berry jam that have been open in the fridge for too long.  Like many others I found the ratio of ketchup to jam to be too heavy on the ketchup side and it is in need of a good bit more spice/flavor to suit our taste.  I found a good bit of harisa powder adds an interesting flavor and a bit of heat.

I had picked a lot of blackberries and wanted to try something different in addition to all my favorite classic berry recipes. This is definitely a keeper! My son and I love this recipe! Like others suggested, I only added 1 cup of catsup, and since I didn't have dry mustard I used 3 tsp of Dijon mustard. I had slow-cooked some pork to make pulled pork sandwiches and we added the amount of sauce to our liking. I froze the rest and brought it with us to share on our camping trip and it was obvious I didn't make enough. I am very happy with the way it came out, but I am also going to try another reviewers suggestion and see what it's like with garlic and ginger added to it.

We have been using this recipe for the past year, and it is our favorite bbq sauce.  It is very versatile, and we use it for all our grilled meats and veggies.  Also works great over baked chicken.  I usually sub apple cider vinegar.  Kids love it, hubby loves it, and even my skeptical mom enjoyed it!

I was excited at the thought of this recipe.  I made it as others suggested with 1 C Ketchup, and BBQ sauce.  I found I needed to add way more Blackberry Jam than it called for. (Maybe because it was an off brand of Jam) I ended up adding white pepper, more brown sugar, cayenne, and vinegar.  I also added Jim Bean at the last minute, it added incredible depth of flavor.  I gave it 4 stars, because it was unusual, and a great base to start from, to make your own flavor.  Thank you!

How sweet it was.  Absolutely mouth watering.  Had to add a little extra (1/2 tsp) cayenne and 1/2 tsp of mustard to give it a little more zing and spice.  But highly recommended for rib conosuers.

Excellent!  I used fresh blackberry jam - I picked the blackberries today and took some of the juice while it was cooking up for jam.
Pork ribs were among the best I've ever tasted!

We enjoyed this BBQ sauce very much.  I added some hot sauce to this for extra flavor.  We used it on bone-in chicken breasts.  I brushed them with oil, sprinkled Season All on them, and grilled them for 40 minutes.  Then the last 10 minutes of cooking I brushed on the sauce.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe, except I heated it in a saucepan to help mix the flavors and get rid of the lumps from the preserves.  Delicious as is.  The only complaint I had from my guests was that I didn't double the recipe.  I will definately make this again (doubled).
