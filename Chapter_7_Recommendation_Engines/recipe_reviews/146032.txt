This was very, very good. Expect a mildly spicy avocado hummus. Preparation was quick and easy, and Husband and I made a light meal of it with warm whole-wheat pita.

I did not enjoy this one very much at all.  I think it was the orange juice.  Next time I will try omitting the orange juice and put in a little lemon instead.

Tried this spread it was very good. Made a few changes such as adding a little lemon juice and less orange juice.  Taste great!

WOW--- this had a wonderful flavor! I had no orange juice on hand so I freshly juiced an orange which was about the right amount. I actually loved that part as opposed to lemon for a change. This is a real keeper!

The only reason I did't give this recipe 5 stars is because of the orange juice--please omit it and add freshly juiced lime (or lemon) instead.  The jalape√±os should also be added to taste.

I was impressed with the orange taste!  I left mine a little bit chunky when processing it.  Next time, I might leave the seeds in the jalapeno pepper for some added kick!

I really like where you are going with this! I just made it tonight. I am also going to vouch for lemon juice over the orange, however. I feel orange competes with the other flavors a little to much. Thanks for sharing!
