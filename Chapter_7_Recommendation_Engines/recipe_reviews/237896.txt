Fantastic.   My picky father-in-law said that it was the best ham he's ever had.   It was flavorful, super moist and super tender.   By the amount of juice left in the foil, you would have guessed that there was none in the ham, but there was loads.    I cooked at 325 for about 3 hours instead of 350 for 2 1/2.   At this point, my ham was about 130 degrees inside.  Not as warm as I'd like, but I think that was due to the high sided pan that I used.  I then opened up the foil and cooked for another 30 minutes to give the ham a brown and to raise the internal temp, which it did.   I removed from heat and closed the foil back up and let it set for 15 or 20 minutes.   Fantastic and easy.   I definitely will use this technique again.

I used half of a pre-cut ham and this was good. Not the prettiest of hams but good. I recommend letting it sit for 10 minutes or so. When I took the picture it was bright pink but turned a nice golden brown once it sat.
