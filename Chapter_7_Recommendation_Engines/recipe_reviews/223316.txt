This was a great recipe for using chard and zucchini.  The muffins freeze well, too.

These are awesome.  I took them for a luncheon.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I reduced the salt by half , no butter butter to fry the bacon and basically steamed the chard, onions and garlic in the skillet I browned the bacon in.  All grease drained.  I also used parchment baking cups.  Don't use cupcake papers.  They will stick.

If you've stumbled upon this recipe then you must be *thinking* about making these. Do yourself a favor and just DO IT! I followed the recipe exactly, doubled it even, and they came out incredibly delicious. Their density is more quiche-like than muffin but super good nonetheless.

These were amazing. I diced the zukes instead of shredding them and cooked the onion at the same time as the bacon. They were out perfect.

The only real suggestion I have for change is that 20 minutes was not enough cook time. It could be that my oven is on the weak side but 20 minutes definitely wasn't enough when I made these. I took them out at 30 mins and they were perfect.

Absolutlely DELISH!  Was even better the next day!  I made a double batch - one for my employees and one for home.  I did not have any chard - so I used spinach which was on hand.  This will be a go to item for me!

It is tasty but far from healthy... No kidding about seriously greasing the muffin tin: I used paper liners and the mixture stuck to them like glue. The recipe is also vague when it calls for 8 chard leaves: leaves have various size, depending at what stage the cook picks them. Maybe it should state that you should steam a bunch and obtain xx ounces. Lastly, there is no reason why the shredded zucchini can't be saut√©ed together with the chard.

I made these this weekend using my CSA veggies and they are great! The muffin name is a little misleading because it doesn't have the consistency of a muffin. They are more like crustless quiche. The only changes I made was that I used spring onions instead of regular onion and parmesan cheese instead of swiss. I would make these again!

Awesome recipe! We didn't change anything, and it was perfect. It seems like it would work for similar veggies too (squashes, etc.). Highly recommend.

Amazing. Only change was omitting the butter. Seemed excessive to add butter to bacon.

delicious! didn't have bacon, so made it with ham...just amazing! the only thing is that it's a bit messy to clean afterwards (still all worth it!), so I'll follow the advice of using parchment paper liner cups next time...

A good way to use zucchini and chard. I followed the recipe and found it to be a little too heavy for my taste.  Will make again, with some adjustments.

My family and I really liked these muffins. We are trying to cut back on wheat so I substituted the 1 cup of flour for 1 cup of almond flour and they turned out great. Also I didn't has Swiss cheese so I used med. cheddar

I didn't have any chard but decided to make it anyway.  I also think I would use less salt.  I think you could make with spinach as well.  I will make again.

Very good, just a bit heavy, but that figures seeing the ingredients.  And I did grease the muffin tins heavily with spray on shortening which caused them to slide out of the tins easily.  Yum!

I have an abundance of chard and zucchini right now and was looking for ways to use them.  I made the recipe just like it says except half I made without bacon for my daughter who doesn't eat meat, and half for the rest of us.  I am making a 2nd batch right away because they were so good!!!  I used cheddar instead of swiss but will try gruyere, swiss , and maybe parmesan too.  Yummmmm!!!  Oh, I substituted spelt flour for the AP flour.

Great alternative to sweet zucchini muffins! I've made it several times and given out the recipe to friends. Its not a healthy breakfast, but each day after I made these I found myself grabbing for one in the fridge.

Wow, surprisingly good! I really dislike cooked greens but see the value in eating them.  We belong to a CSA this year and I have to find away to use chard.  This was a big hit by all the family (4 year old and 1 year old).  I was skeptical of the butter with the bacon but it turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did remove the bacon after cooking to drain and chop, not sure if it was implied or not.  Good stuff!!

These are superb! I am trying not to eat them all before my husband returns. There was plenty of fat on the bacon so I didn't fry it in butter. I also greased the muffin pan with butter, no problems with sticking at all. I didn't have Swiss so used cheddar, it was fine but Swiss would've given it a kick. I'll be making these again soon and will sprinkle some grated parmesan on top before baking. Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

Delicious! Made it twice now. Followed recipe as is except for using butter instead of cooking spray to grease muffin pan.
