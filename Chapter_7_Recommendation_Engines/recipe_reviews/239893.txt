It was really good! I kinda messed up, and put the raw chicken in with the potatoes, and then boiled for fifteen min. It came out so tender! I would add some spices to it, like parsley (I sprinkled it on top in the bowl). I really enjoyed it, so did my family.

It was ok.  I added minced garlic to the onion and a bit more cheese.  The kids considered it bland and added salt, pepper, scallions and bacon crumbles to their soups.  They were happy after these additions.  It's missing some serious flavor.  Maybe nix the cup of water and use another can of stock--I used homemade but we still added 'stuff' to it.  Bacon, more cheese, sour cream, splash of sherry....something.  The ease of prep was fabulous, but it was just a 'meh' dinner experience for us.

I was trying to find recipes to use up some leftover bacon fat and came across this soup recipe.  I thought it was very good. I made one slight change, which was to replace the butter with bacon grease (okay, maybe not the healthiest but it gave it a great flavor).  My husband is a garlic lover so I added some minced garlic as well, but I think it would have tasted fine without it, too.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as instructed and the soup turned out great, I'll be doing this one again.

I had to substitute 1 envelope of liptons savory herb and garlic seasoning for my 2 cups chicken broth.  But it turned out great!! This soup was delicious and husband pleasing!!!  Next time I will make it as the recipe stated.

Excellent base recipe. I began by cheating with using a rotisserie chicken from the deli at the local Kroger for my chicken. Then, after the onions were clarified, I added two minced garlic cloves, and about 1tbsp thyme and rosemary, sautéing about 1min before adding the potatos.

Added 1 1/2 cups of cheese to make it a bit "Cheesier". Also chopped up the bacon (4 Slices)  and added. To get a vegetable in there, I added a can of peas.- Kids loved it. Lots of flavor.. and hearty!
