Tried it because I had a taste for some coleslaw and didn't want to drive to get some.  It came out great, I was passing spoon samples all over the house, it was enjoyed by everyone with out a drop remaining!

Now, we didn't eat this as a separate side dish but this has now become the coleslaw recipe we will use for every time we make pulled pork or beef. Amazing! I used the cola pot roast recipe from this site but "pulled" it and added BBQ sauce to make sandwiches and used this coleslaw recipe to top the sandwiches with.  Loved!  This coleslaw recipes adds a nice sweet touch to the sandwiches.  For sure a keeper. Thank you! We all thought this this coleslaw recipe was "da bomb" - thank you so much!

If you are looking for a fast and easy recipe for coleslaw, this fits the bill.  It's not my favorite coleslaw, but very good if you are on the run.

Just put in a pork roast on a bed of onions in the crockpot to make into pulled pork sandwiches for dinner.  My hubs and I decided we wanted to try coleslaw on the sandwiches.  We whipped up the slaw (used Splenda instead of sugar to save the calories), and this was so "Shove your Face in the Bowl" good that I hope we have some left when the pork is finished.  Simple but amazing!

I used an 8 oz. bag of coleslaw mix and cut the ingredients in half. I used white wine vinegar instead of cider as it's what I had. I added in a hefty pinch of garlic powder (family not-so-secret secret), about the same in kosher salt, and lots of freshly ground pepper. This was so delicious that it only fed 2 adults. In fact my husband has seconds and wanted more and there wasn't any. The next time I will fix the entire batch for only 2 of us and stretch it over two days. I only let this sit about 3 hours while the ribs baked. I stumbled onto this recipe by accident when I couldn't find my usual one and this one had my name so I had to try it... sooo glad we did! This went perfectly with bbq baby back ribs. This is a great basic recipe and it's easy to personalize and make it your own. Loved this!!!

Creamy and good!  I made only half the recipe for the whole bag of coleslaw to cut down on calories.  I used light mayo too.

Super easy and quick.  My bag of shredded coleslaw mix was only 14 oz. but I liked it with extra dressing. I will make this again!

Really good.  Instead of  so much mayo I did half mayo half sour cream.  Also added fresh lemon juice.   Came out perfect.

Fast and easy and just the right balance of flavors.  Add a little garlic powder for an extra layer of goodness.

This Coleslaw was wonderful - my guests went back for seconds!  When I put the dressing on, it did not appear to be enough but am glad I did not add more because after it sat in the fridge for an hour or so, there was alot of "juice". Since it was for a party, I mixed it again and put it into a colander to drain and then served.  It was creamy and excellent.  I served with Zesty Slow Cooker BBQ chicken.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the family enjoyed it a lot. I was asked to make it again for Christmas and am doing so. This salad also goes great with pulled pork, grilled bbq chicken, sausage, burgers any summer grilling menu.

I tried Cindy's Coleslaw recipe because it seemed like the easiest.  It was soooo easy and super tasty.  My only amendments were that I didn't have onion powder so I added 1Tbsp. chopped shallot and  1/2 tps. seasoned salt instead of reg salt.

Very good coleslaw...I used half mayo, half low fat sour cream since I am not a huge fan of mayo.  It turned out very well!

Thank you! This is simple, quick and delicious! And I really like that it adds the health benefits of apple cider vinegar! 

Oh! And I did used dried "minced onion" just because I didn't have onion powder. Yummy!

I love how easy this recipe is. No fuss is right. I don't always have time for elaborate recipes. Sometime you need something simple but still deelish! The only thing I changed is the mayo. I use 3/4 a cup of mayo.. just my preference.

Yes, I made changes to this recipe. First off I used Splenda instead of sugar (I'm diabetic) then I also added fake crab to the mix. Love it. And yes will make it again. Also sometimes when I've made up a bowl of it, I pop it into the microwave and heat it up a bit. A very nice Krab Coleslaw.

A good alternate to my usual use of purchased slaw dressing. I have not tried sugar before and it softens the flavor. I shred my own cabbage and carrots and onion. I also add a little finely chopped jalapeno for a small kick. 
This is a good use of what is left in the mayo or miracle whip jar as well.  Thanks.

This is very yummy.  My family and I just moved into our new house and I couldn’t find my grandmother’s recipe book.  I put a tiny bit of extra mayo, but it’s really good

I made this recipe for a party of almost 80 based on the ratings here. I used 10 lbs of cabbage and quadrupled the sauce recipe. 

Modification: The only modification I made was to add 4 tsp of celery seed (1 tsp per recipe as written). The taste is amazing and I received several compliments on the slaw.

This is my new favorite cole slaw recipe. Thank you Cindy!

My husband and I live this recipe. The only addition I made, was to add some chopped onion. Otherwise it’s just fine the way it is, creamy, sweet and yummy.

Made it to use up half a bag of Cole slaw.  Followed the recipe except Truvia instead of sugar.  Cindy, we liked this better than the "Crack Slaw" we made with the other half of the bag.  LOL
Thanks for the recipe.  I was able to whip it up while the BBQ chicken was Instant Potting.  EZ, PZ.

Quick, easy, and tasty. We did cut down on the sugar only adding a handful. I also added celery seed for more taste. Second time I made this. We will return to it over and over again. My husband loves it!

It’s very good. I used 1 packet of Splenda to sweeten rather than sugar. My packages coleslaw mix already had onion and bell pepper, so I didn’t add the onion powder (but would otherwise). I did add a little ~ a tsp of a neutral (sunflower) oil. And I only used ~1/2 cup of mayo. I just eyeballed the consistency. I’ll definitely make this again.

Love this!  It reminds me of my mom's cole slaw.  I chose to chop my own head of cabbage and add shredded carrots, but buying it pre-mixed would've been a lot easier! It's perfect with BBQ chicken sliders. Thanks Cindy!

This coleslaw recipe is my favorite.  It's creamy, tasty, and easy to make.  I cut back a little on the sugar and added a pinch of celery seed to customize it to my style.  But this is by far my favorite coleslaw.  Way to go Cindy!

When I first made it the vinegar taste was too strong, but after it sat in the fridge for awhile it balanced out and was quite good. There were no leftovers.

This was great and simple recipe. I have never made coleslaw before, but my daughter and husband love it so I wanted to try to make it, they both loved it. I made one adjustment, I used less mayo in my version. I came out great, i will use this recipe again. Thank you for the help.

This is a simple and great recipe..  everyone I've served it to has loved it.  My only alteration is I find that HALF the amount of each ingredient is plenty for a 16 oz bag of slaw. And save yourself a bowl by mixing it all up right in the bag the slaw comes in.

I made this and added green onion and squeezed in some fresh lime. It was very tasty but I think adding the lime made it extra yummy and a little watery. I used two 10 oz bags of bagged coleslaw. Thank you for a good, easy to make recipe!

We usually prefer a vinegar dressing, but I wanted to try something different.  This recipe was just perfect.  It would also be good with shredded carrot, some green pepper, etc. Today I made a big batch to take to a potluck tomorrow.

I made this again, using 1/2 mayo and 1/2 greek yogurt.  I also added the shredded carrot, chopped green pepper and chopped celery .

I like less dressing so only used 1/2 cup mayo and full amount of vinegar. Add some shakes of garlic powder and celery seed. Easy and tasty!

Pretty good. Nice and creamy. Too sweet though. I have never made my own so I didn't know what to expect. Next time I will definitely use a lot less sugar or maybe even agave mentioned by another reviewer. Also regular vinegar instead of cider vinegar.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe. I did make one change by using red wine vinegar or pomegranate vinegar (I've made several times each way). This makes for a little sweeter addition to a BBQ sandwich! Compliments galore and always requested.

I was making Alabama pulled pork and wanted coleslaw to go with it.   I did not have sour cream or lemon juice (ingredients I found in other recipes) so I searched recipes excluding those ingredients and found this.  It was excellent!   I did add a splash of celery seeds, otherwise made as written.

Husband and I agree that this is THE RECIPE we'll be using for coleslaw until the end of time! We've made it as listed (butbwith vegan Mayo) on three occasions and it is just so tasty--a classic coleslaw recipe, in our opinions.

I tried this recipe because I didn’t have any onions and this was the best looking one I found with no onions. Glad I did! We are picky about coleslaw so were surprised and delighted that we liked this one so much!

For so few ingredients, this was very good. I was tempted to add more to it, but I'm glad that I didn't. It's fine the way it is, and I liked the creaminess of it. I tried it right away, but I'm sure it will be better as it stands. Thanks for this easy recipe, Cindy!

Super easy and nice mix of sweet and sour - didn't have onion flakes so used minced onion - not the best move but it still survived! Also used light mayo and it was totally fine with that.

I've made this several times and it's now requested for all family events. It's easy to make and tastes great. I usually double the recipe. It's best when made the night before and with a fresh head of cabbage shredded in a food processor but I usually make it with the bagged slaw mix and it still tastes great.

I've been looking for a coleslaw recipe that I really like over the years and I've finally found it.  The whole family loves it. Made it for our July 4th picnic and the guests loved it too.
This is now our go-to coleslaw recipe!

Followed recipe exactly for all ingredients. My coleslaw mix didn't have onions so I added 1 small vidalia onion finely chopped. It ended up a little watery after a day in the fridge so next time will try a little less mayo or vinegar. Very tasty and lots of compliments at the family barbecue. This ones a keeper in my book.

Very nice balance of sweet and savory. I doubled the amount of slaw mix and it still had enough dressing. Simple and good.

This is a disarmingly quick and simple recipe.   I kicked it up a notch by adding a handful each of blanched slivered almonds and orange flavored dried cranberries, both from Trader Joe's.   It was phenomenal.  
The next time I make it, I will try honey instead of sugar and  only half the sweetening.  Also, because the honey is liquid, I'll be able to use less mayo.    I used fresh slivered cabbage, not packaged. 
Thank you, Cindy!

First time I made this I thought it needed a bit more vinegar, but served it as written. (I follow all recipes exactly the first time.) Hubby liked it, but thought it was lacking something. I suggested he sprinkled a few drops of vinegar on his cole slaw. He did and said that was what it needed. Since then, I add another 1/4-1/2 tablespoon of vinegar and we both think it's perfect. I have also served this to company and taken to potlucks, and I received compliments and requests for the recipe. Thanks for a really great salad!

As is - it's a little too wet and sweet. I cut the mayo and sugar by 1/4, and add a dash of cayenne and celery seed. Family really likes it.

My bf loved this! Went back for thirds! I will definitely make this again and again. I would have rated it higher but I don't personally like coleslaw much.

Was out of Apple cider vinegar when I made it used rice wine vinegar instead but stuck to the remaining recipe and all I have to say is YUM!

I doubled the recipe, so cut back on the sugar a bit. Instead of onion powder, I used about 1/2 tsp. celery seed for the doubled batch. It was gone in a flash and my husband said, "this is a keeper"!

I made this with seven heads of cabbage and 1 pound of carrots and one onion. I cut back on the sugar a little and it came out great! Thanks for an easy crowd pleaser! It's going to be served with barbecue pulled pork and sweet Italian sausage.

As others have said, this is a very easy coleslaw recipe. It turns out really really well and since coleslaw is never really the star of the show, I think this recipe is perfect. It's creamy, it's appropriately sweet, and there wasn't one shred of cabbage left. This is definitely a keeper and I will definitely make this again. No changes are needed in my opinion.

I was looking for an easy recipe for coleslaw and this was it.  I made it as directed except for the sugar, of which I only used 1 tablespoon for 1/2 bag of coleslaw mix.  Any more would have made this taste like a dessert.
I enjoyed the taste of the final product and will make it again.

This was delicious! I was looking for a recipe for coleslaw like my grandma used to make. This wasn't spot on but it so close and by far the best recipe I've found. Even my husband liked it and he's usually not a fan of coleslaw. Next time I make it I may decrease the cider vinegar a little but it was good nonetheless.

This is a good recipe.  I made it a while ago with no changes (I try to follow the recipe the first time as written).  I was happy with it.  This time around I added dill weed, and this was an awesome addition.

A little bit too sweet.  Would cut back the sugar next time. But good when you need something quick.

I used 5 packets of splenda instead of the white sugar - less calories and the flavor was terrific!

This was a really good, easy coleslaw! I halved the sugar, and I think it was perfect! Very good on BBQ sandwiches and can stand alone as a side. Thank you!

This is a great recipe.  This is how my mother used to make hers exactly except for the onion powder.  I am sure she would have if she ever thought to.  People used to ask her all the time how she made hers and she never exactly told them how much of what she used. She would eye it as she said. I had to learn to cook that way also.  My mother passed away when I was 22 and was sick early on in my life so I had to learn to cook with her sitting in the den while I was  in the kitchen just taking instruction.  It was hard that way. Any baking she did have recipes for. And anything she got from friends etc..... she would have the recipe for also so I had a few things to go buy but not many.   I had honestly forgotten how to make this. Since you can buy the coleslaw cabbage already chopped for the last several years I have just done that.  I had picked up a bag this weekend and got the kind that had not mix in it.  So here I come in hopes to find the recipe of my mothers and sure enough here it was!!!  I am so very happy right now. When making it my son who is 30 said....... I hope your making it like you used to when I was little?  I actually said son I really am this time......and you should have seen his face.  Its chilling as I speak but we both had a good taste and he jumped up and down and I was so happy I have this recipe back now.  I have put it in my recipe box here and my hand written one.  Never to lose again.

Made this recipe exactly as written except used fresh cabbage instead of packaged mix.  I found it to be much too sweet.  Also by the next day the dressing had become very liquid.  Would not make it again.

Made this exactly as written for the first time for a family reunion. LOVED it - as did everyone one else at the reunion!!! Already had several requests for recipe. Easy & used ingredients that I always have on hand; went well with pulled pork. Will be making this again and again!

My goodness! Was looking for an easy, tasty coleslaw recipe. Didn't have half the stuff of some of the other recipes, plus I'm lazy. This was QUICK and tastes fine. This will probably be my go to. Thanks for the great quick recipe!

I have made this recipe twice, and am making it for another party this weekend. I double the amount of coleslaw mix lettuce because it is too much dressing by the original recipe. I also add garlic powder (I add it to everything I make). This is a perfect coleslaw: very easy, quick, and delicious and I'm quite picky when it comes to coleslaw. I definitely recommend!

Simple and Perfect. I needed to make coleslaw but wanted it to be fresh (not the pre-made mushy stuff at the grocery store). I didn't want to get all crazy with different ingredients so this was perfect. It's crunchy and fresh and was super quick and easy! Thanks!

Used with Dr. Pepper pulled pork sandwiches. Was so simple and tasted just as good or better than any other slaw I've tasted. It really made the sandwich and I felt there was nothing lacking what-so-ever. Very happy with this recipe!

"This is the best coleslaw I every tasted" says my hubby when ever I make it. So, what else can I say. Very easy to make and stores very well in the fridge separately from the grated slaw. I make the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing.  Update: I now reduce the sugar by half and it still tastes awesome!!  Great way to reduce sugar intake.

So simple. So yummy. Can't get better than that! I also added other veggies just because I had them in the refrigerator: finely diced bell peppers (any color), celery, onion, additional grated carrots.

This is a very simple recipe. It is not runny so it is perfect to put on a pulled pork sandwich

Quick, easy, tasty. We didn't have any onion powder so I used Penzey's Sandwich Sprinkle instead, on the theory that it was a similar flavor. Very, very good. We'll be having this again in the summer.

Made this last weekend for super bowl side and wife loved it. Only deviated a "smidgen" from the recipe and found it worked like a charm. This is an excellent recipe for beginners like me. Oh, and the deviation was just to substitute a hint of fresh lime juice for a hint of vinegar, not too much.

Traditional cole slaw in my book. I reduced the sugar just a little bit and didn't notice any difference.

So easy and So Good!  I did cut back on the sugar just a bit though.  After sitting a couple of hours it does get wet.  We like it that way but, if you don't like yours so wet, then just cut back on the mayo a bit or the salt(this draws out the moisture). I had to come back and make another comment. After several days I don't know how it could get better, but it did, amazing!  So if you know ahead of time, make it early and give even more time for the flavors to blend.  But, remember it's still great the first day!

Yum! I needed a quick side dish and this did the trick!!  I thought it was quite tasty for being such a fast fix. Thank you for sharing it! I reduced the serving size to 4 and used a 1/4 head of green cabbage. Thinly sliced it and tossed in a few handfuls of pre-shredded carrots. I will be using this recipe a lot this summer!

Very fast and easy!  I only eat coleslaw on top of my BBQ sandwiches, not by itself, so I can't evaluate it on its stand alone flavor.  However, it was good on my sammich!

Extremely easy to make. I used Lite mayo and reduced it to 3/4ths a cup because I don't like a *lot* of mayo, and also used rice vinegar because I didn't have any cider vinegar, but because store bought coleslaw is so unhealthy and mayo crammed, it's a great substitute with barely any effort at all.

Delicious.  I made this, along with homemade chili for chili dogs, to rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, and doubled it.  Chilled for a full day before serving, and the flavor was great. This time I am adding 1/2 tsp each of celery seed and mustard powder for a little more complexity.

Very good basic recipe. I have made it several times, and our whole family likes it. I always use fresh grated/ sliced cabbage and carrots, and sometimes use finely chopped or grated onion instead of onion powder. Very good this way too.

Used low fat mayo and used 2 packets of Truvia non sugar sweetner instead of straight sugar. Made in the morning and let sit in the fridge for the day and served with shredded BBQ beedf sandwiches. Delicious!
