I loved the roasted peppers and the chorizo, and the beans.  I added less salsa then it called for because I thought it made it too wet.  I also added some Monterey Jack cheese to it.  My guests enjoyed this and I would make it again.

This was FANTASTIC. I don't like spicy things so really wasn't expecting to like this, but I really, really did. We charred the bell peppers on the stovetop since it was raining outside and I cooked the sausages in the oven on 350 for 20 minutes. I used pinto instead of black beans and corn tortillas since that's what we had on hand. Otherwise followed the recipe and will definitely use this again (the charred bell peppers really added a unique, smoky and wonderful flavor)! Yumm!!
