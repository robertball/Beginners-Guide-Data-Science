I made this recipe without the "escarole", because I could not get it where I live, however, the soup was absolutely fabulous without it.  My family loved it, even my 4 and 6 year old children gobbled it up.  My husband commented that the next time I make it, he would like more meat in it.  I used 5 thighs instead of 4 to make make up for the Escarole and he still wanted more meat.  None of this soup was thrown out.  We ate all of it over 3 days.  It's a keeper.

this soup is very good! you can add whatever vegetables you want... aduki or adzuki beans are fantastic, a delicious way of adding more fibre to your diet, and they go so well with the sweet potato flavour! *warning* if you are not used to eating too much fibre, the adzuki beans may sneak up on you ...

We all LOVED this one!! I used (dry) kidney beans in place of the adzuki...and I added them in toward the middle of cooking. Also, I used a box of Uncle Ben's wild rice which I cooked in the microwave then added toward the end of cooking. This was especially good the next day.

This is a fabulous soup. I usually omit the zucchini because I never seem to have it on hand. The key elements to this soup are chicken stock, adzuki beans, sweet potato, escarole, and the spices. All other ingredients I've added or subbed, depending on what was in the fridge, and it's been delicious every time.

My husband and I both enjoyed this healthy and delicious soup.  Substitutions could easily be made for personal veggie preferences.  I used fresh garlic and, perhaps because I used low sodium broth, I found that it needed some himalayan sea salt before serving.

I wasn't sure if I should review this recipe, because I had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand, but I decided that my substitutions didn't change the overall flavor of the dish.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs, brown jasmine rice instead of wild rice, part of a pattypan squash instead of the zucchini, and spinach instead of escarole.  I had bought some adzuki beans from the bulk section of my grocery store because I thought they were beautiful beans, so then I had to find a recipe to use them in.  The flavor of this is incredible!  I thought for sure I would need to add salt, but the herbs combined with the slight saltiness of the broth made the flavor perfect.  I researched the nutritional value of adzuki beans and they're amazingly good for you!  I'll definitely buy more and make this again on multiple occasions.  Thank you for sharing!

This soup is delicious!!  I made it per recipe, and it made   LOTS of soup!  With just the two of us we polished it off in 3 days.  I plan on making this often.  A lot of chopping, but well worth it!  (especially because when I cook my hubby cleans) ;)  A new favorite!

I was skeptical when I didn't like the smell or the look of it cooking but wanted to try my adzuki beans.  Wonderful combination, rich and hearty. I put the onions in but they got too mushy so I removed them before serving.

Very tasty. The sweet potato tastes great with the squash and chicken. I don't like escarole so used a bag of fresh spinach instead. Didn't add beans either and it was still yummy. Also, I used bone-in thighs (more flavor) and boiled for just half an hour, then cut it up and added when suggested.

Very tasty. I had escarole and chicken that I needed to use out of the refrigerator so I came across this recipe. I am giving this 5 stars because the broth in the soup is a very good blend of flavors. I had to make a few minor substitutions because of what I had on hand. I kept to the orginal intent of the soup and was very pleased. I will use this recipe often. My tyme and rosemary were not ground. The next time I will use my spice grinder so that I am not eating little "sticks".

A very versatile and easy to follow recipe which yielded delicious results that all the family enjoyed. I omitted the escarole, which I did not have, and added some chopped mushrooms and yellow pepper. This meal is a great way of using up leftover vegetables from the fridge. The fact that it is a healthy, nutritious and low calorie meal is a bonus. I intend to make this again in the near future.

I just didn't like this.  I liked the adzuki beans which I was a first-timer with, but I had to keep adding water and the rice didn't turn out right.  And I didn't like the escarole in it but normally I like escarole.  I will not make this again.

I agree about sauteeing the onions and garlic in oil first. Then adding the chicken. I made the beans separately since I didn't want the chicken to dry out. Overall, it was a pretty tasty, hearty dish. But certainly not something I would make for guests or expect to be delicious.

I was really unimpressed by this recipe. It was perfectly ok, but nothing special. Granted I couldn't find the adzuki beans at my market, so maybe that's the secret ingredient....but I found the soup pretty bland all-in-all.

This was a great healthy recipe!  My 9 yr. old even enjoyed it.  I changed these ingredients:  6 Chix, 1 onion only,  2 pressed cloves of garlic, omit sage & rosemary & escarole.  Added a Garden Veg. spice about 1 tbsp.  We will eat this again.  Thx for the recipe- I was wondering what to do with my Adzuki beans!

This is not a good recipe. Too much wild rice. Dry beans need to be cooked longer but I used rinsed canned beans. The combination of wild rice and beans reduced the broth to almost none existing and reduce the chicken flavor to also none existing. This soup lacks good flavor. I have too many excellent soup recipes and will not cook this soup again. Don't waste your time and money on this one. I don't understand how anyone could rate this recipe as excellent.

This was so delicious! I couldn't get the escarole today so used our garden-grown Italian Lacinato Kale. And we didn't have wild rice so I used a mix of Forbidden rice and Volcano rice. We used fresh rosemary. We added 2 cups of chicken broth when we put the vegetables in. The flavors were amazing and one bowl filled us up. It's a very hearty dish and comes out almost stew-like. So yummy and healthy!
