Tried this last night with a huge piece of trout. I didn't have enough honey, so I used just a little light agave and tried a different dry rub in different sections since it was so large: a tropical spice blend, a mesquite bbq blend, a bourbon & brown sugar, and Old Bay seasoning on the last 1/4.  All turned out fantastic

Decided to give this one a go since I was limited on both ingredients and time. Turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise! I normally don't like honey-based sauces, but this wasn't overpoweringly sweet. It was a nice balance between sweet and smokey. I used a local Asian BBQ rub in place of the mesquite seasoning since they were pretty comparable and it turned out fine. Also, I used sea salt in place of seasoned salt. Careful with over-baking; 15 minutes might be too long depending on thickness. 11 minutes was more than enough for my fillets.

This is my favorite fish recipe to date! I didn’t have a pound of trout but I still used the same measurements with the seasonings. It came out just a tad salty for my 3 filets so I think next time I’ll reduce a bit for my small family. Everyone still really loves this. It was the perfect blend of sweet, salty, and savory. This recipe made it to my recipe box for keeps!

Delicious!  I had 2 large filets and since some in my family don't care for spicy food, I left one more plain with just butter, salt, pepper, lemon, parsley and did this recipe for the other.  What a hit!  I used chipotle pepper for the mesquite.  The honey/spicy thing that happens is a unique and wonderful thing for the trout!

Did not have mesquite seasoning. I used a spicy chili lime seasoning and kicked it up a notch with Smoked Spanish Paprika and Ancho Chili seasoning all mixed with natural white honey. Squeezed some fresh lemon over it and sprinkled with chopped spring onions to serve. The result was awesome.

Had a package of steelhead trout filets, and no idea what to do. Was a bit skeptical of honey and mesquite, but this was easy and delish. I simply quick-thawed the filets in cold water, sprayed foil with Pam, drizzled each with honey and sprinkled w/ McCormack mesquite seasoning, and just a touch of seasoned salt. Baked as directed, with a little garlic bread, and served. The combo of seasonings and sweet perfectly complements this fish!

Oh was this ever wonderful. I made it twice. Once I didn't have Mesquite so I used Old Bay. Then I made it the second time with Mesquite and my husband said although the first time was terrific this is even better than last time LOL. I did put all the rub on first and the Honey on last. What a home run this is.

I didn't have mesquite but I did have a smoky BBQ rub that had the salt, pepper, mesquite and honey all in it. Tasted great! 
My only other comment, is don't put the honey and seasoning on until right before you are putting it in the oven.  The honey will run off the fish if it sits too long...

Delicious! I used a local cranberry honey with Stubs Hickery Liquid Smoke, fresh cracked black pepper, and Tabasco Brand Spiced Sea Salt. The combination of the honey, Tabasco sea salt and pepper made for a well-balanced taste. Best part is it's very easy to make and cleans up quickly.

I've made this twice, with steelhead trout and with Alaskan salmon. My husband and I both loved it. When the honey melts, it tends to run off the fish so use a small enough pan. Watch it carefully so the honey doesn't burn (although it does get dark and carmelized - yum) and be sure to not overlook the fish. It should be just flakey, not dry.

I used a lemon-pepper mixture with the honey. Very tasty. And once in a while I'll add a Cajun or carabean jerk rub to it. Again, all were very good

I made this in the smoker with mesquite and apple wood instead of the oven so I did it for 35 minutes at 250 degrees.  Everyone was very impressed. I'll have to make this again.

no changes made, it tasted wonderful.  I did have to lengthen cook time, because I use a convection oven to cook.  I don't have a stove, so it worked real well.  I had cooked it for about 25 min

It was really tasty :) We had added Mrs. Dash and also a few splashes  of  New Lemonade/Ginger Canada Dry soda  to be sure to clean out all the honey out of the jar and poured it over the fish with some parsley & chives. Lined the pan with parchment paper .  It worked great for easy clean up. 450 degrees for 10 minutes turned off the oven and let it stay in the oven until dinner time ( approx  45 minutes) .  Nice and flakey and moist .

Tasty dish. Next time I will season the trout first, then add the honey. Think that will flavour the fish a bit more.

I used this recipe with Kirkland mesquite BBQ rub as another reviewer did. Following their advice about it being too salty, I left out the seasoning salt all together. Both the wife and I thought it was still a little salty, but overall we didn't like the flavor at all.

I have now made this one twice, once with the trout and once with salmon. the trout could not get any better.  There was argument over who got the leftovers (my 9-year-old daughter won both yes).  I will say this: Keep with the trout. the salmon was good, but the filet was too thick to really absorb the flavor.  if I try it again with salmon, I'll try steaks and set it up at least an hour before cooking.

Made it tonight. Used a local "Everglades" seasoning instead of mesquite, lemon pepper, cracked pepper & used a little olive oil & pepper on the cooking sheet to help crisp & season the skin. Was a hit with the whole family. 

Definitely doing this again.

I used Costco Mesquite seasoning and followed the recipe and it was way too salty for me. The steelhead was delicious after I scraped the seasoning off. I would cut the seasoning salt in half, and use a different brand of Mesquite seasoning and cut that to 1 TBS.

Good. I felt the seasoning/saltiness was a little overpowering, but I usually limit my salt, so it may have just been me. My family disagreed that it was too salty. I would try this again, easy and tasty, but would change the seasoning a bit.

Definitely  a keeper!  Will make again for sure. Think this would be good on salmon as well.
