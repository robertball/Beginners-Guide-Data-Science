Tasted great and much quicker than my recipe, but I believe I'll stick with our Family recipe which, while very labor intensive, makes super thin and super delicate lefses...you are supposed to be able to read newspaper headlines through them when done right. 

BTW, my Grandpa Amundson ate his lefse wrapped around a hunk of lutefisk, and in Norway where they call this style potetkake, they wrap them around hotdogs. We prefer ours with butter and a sprinkling of white sugar.

This is a great recipe for lefse. I am very Scandinavian, Erickson's and Millers are the family names.  Lefse should only be served with either butter, or butter and sugar.  Never any odd types of toppings.  I love the ease of this recipe.  Also they should be light golden brown, very similar in color to a tortilla.  Never burnt or dark dark anywhere.

Well.. this is something new to me and my family. It looks like naan bread ( we eat a lot of these in Malaysia) and the texture was a bit like it but with potato taste. We had it with sardine in tomato sauce. Curry will do fine aswell. Overall, will make it again. (View picture)

I love this easy recipe - and doesn't make a zillion like my Norwegian grandmother's recipe! Your specific instructions are the best I've seen. I'll use this when I don't want to make so many. My family isn't as fond of these as I am!

I grew up with lefse (mum's side is from Norway) and we ate it anytime there were enough leftover potatoes to make it. This recipe is almost identical to my mums, except she didn't use sugar. Always seemed to make a huge mess, but they are as fun to eat as they are yummy!

Thank You.  I am not Norwegian, nor have I ever made lefse. Following your recipe I made lefse that made my husband "flash-back" to when he was little and was at Grandma Halvorson's.  Easy to follow, clear instructions.  Thanks again.

I liked this a lot, but don't know if it is worth the extra effort (compared to regular pancakes/crÃªpes).  I'd make it again for some Scandinavia-themed thing though!
