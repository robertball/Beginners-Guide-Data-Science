This recipe is easy and the cinnamon gives it a perfect taste. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and it's great.

THANK YOU! This tastes incredible and with perfect consistency. After making the pizzelles I sifted cinnamon sugar in with powdered sugar and lightly coated. WONDERFUL.

Loved the cinnamon flavor. Don't know why everyone wanted to halve the recipe, I doubled it! The flavor gets better after being stored.

I don't really care for the traditional anise pizzelles, but these cinnamon ones are really good. I used butter instead of margarine, and I halved the recipe. It's perfect as is, but, next time, I might try sprinkling them with a powdered sugar & cinnamon mixture that another reviewer recommended.

I donâ€™t know how each of the 9 reviewers overlooked the fact that the recipe calls for 3 Tablespoons of baking soda instead of teaspoons. I tried the first two pizzelle and they were terribly bitter. I remember thinking the amount of baking soda seemed like a lot but the reviews were all stellar so I trusted the recipe. Fortunately I only made 1/3 batch of batter so I was able to remedy this by making remaining 2/3 batch without any baking soda and combining both sets of batter.
