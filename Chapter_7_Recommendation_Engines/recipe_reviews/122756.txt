OMG! Do the awesome peanut butter recipes disguised as "kid friendly" recipes never end on here? I guess I can get away with eating these as long as I have my niece over to eat them with me... I tried to lighten these up as much as possible with skim milk and fat free pudding mix, but until they come up with a fat free peanut butter I'm in BIG trouble because I just can't seem to get enought of the stuff even if it's reduced fat! I have to say these little treats were really good frozen or not....

These are so good!! Rich peanutbutter and chocolate pudding frozen into a sandwich - what could be better. I use 1 cup of P.B. with no problems and no other changes. I try and make mine as thick as I can, about 1/2 inch thick. I place sandwiches on cookie sheet, then cover and freeze. When frozen I then store in a freezer bag. These are so satisfying and a good snack (may need to let them soften for about 5 minutes to make them easy to bite into). For a change I use chocolate graham crackers. The recipe is forgiving and you can use sugar free / fat free products if that is your preference.

What a great little recipe.  I've never made anything like this for the last 50 years... but it was recommended in the Recipe Exchange so I made them and my picky hubby loved them.  I used the sf/ff chocolate pudding with ff milk and the reduced fat PB, very tasty for a quick treat.  It made 17 sandwiches that I individually wrapped in Saran Wrap and then placed on a cookie sheet and set in the freezer.  I then placed the sandwiches in a zip-lock so it is easy to store and grab a quick, mostly guilt free little treat.  Thanks Joanne for a great recipe.

Oh my goodness!  My mom used to make these all the time and I actually made them last week, I am so thrilled to see them here! You definitely don't need a mixer for these, just whisk your milk and PB together well and then whisk in the pudding and let it chill for 5-10min while you break up the grahams. Then after filling I lay them in a single layer to freeze for a few hours then stack them in a gallon size ziploc bag. So easy. These make awesome summertime snacks and kids WILL love them!  Also try other pudding flavors, I just tried banana pudding and it was fantastic! You can't go wrong with PB and banana! Oh, and your kids will thank you if you are generous with the filling. :D

This is an easy recipe.  Out of a whole box of graham crackers, I used 2 of the packs.   It is messy when assembling (pudding oozes on the edges and I only used 1 Tablespoon).  A previous reviewer stated the mixture was better before being frozen and I have to agree.  I wish I had  placed the pudding mixture in individual dishes and sprinkled the graham crackers on top.  Don't see these in our future.  Sorry!

I so wanted these to turn out better, but I have 5 kids and 1 husband and I made 15 of these for an after dinner dessert and I still have 13 of them 3 days later. I guess my family does not like frozen pudding. They are super easy to make though.

I actually was surprised how much I liked these. When I made the PB/pudding mixture, I was sure I wouldn't like the finished product because the peanut butter seemed an off flavor for me, but once it was frozen it was great! After it was frozen, the peanut butter accenting flavor reminded me of the peanuts you get on sundaes or dipped ice cream cones. The only downside, and this is not at all a fault with the recipe (hence 5 stars), is that more than half my box of graham crackers were broken. That'll teach me not to buy graham crackers at a famous chain that ends with "mart", eh! (I'm mentioning the broken cracker thing only because it adversely affected my yield. Most recipes calling for graham crackers don't need them to be in perfect condition, so it didn't occur to me to buy double the crackers, but if I had been making these for company I'd have been outta luck!) Thanks for the recipe, I'm going to try with Nutella sometime, mmm.

What a unique and fun little snack/treat!  I made these for my boys and my nephew...came across a box of graham wafers that needed to be used/eaten!  I used fat free chocolate pudding, reduced fat graham wafers and had some natural crunchy peanut butter.  They went over very well (had to try one myself!!).  What's not to love about chocolate and pb...MMMM!!  Will make these again and try some different pudding flavours!  Thanks for a great idea!

Love these and love having them in the freezer. What a good snack, and the perfect size when you need a small sweet bite.

My mom used to make these when I was little, and I found the recipe to make for my kids!  These are addicting.  The graham crackers get kind of mushy in the freezer, like the cookie on an ice cream sandwich.  Yum!

These were a big hit at a family picnic!  I didn't have enough peanut butter, but they were tasty without it.  After the picnic, when I asked about leftovers, I was told there weren't any (there were, the hostess hid them in her freezer)!

I was quite surprised how good these were for being so simple.  I let them thaw out a few minutes and it was like eating an ice cream sandwich, albeit a peanut butter flavored one.  I used sugar-free instant pudding and they turned out great.

These were ok frozen, but we had a very hard time stopping ourselves from eating the pudding/PB mix before making the wiches. Now THAT rocked! But once frozen, they lost some appeal to us because the pudding was too hard with the crunchy crackers. The frozen pudding reminded us of a fudgesicle. I didn't have enough grahams so I used Nilla Wafers. I liked the size of the wafers better than half a graham sandwich. Those would probably taste yummy with banana pudding.

These are pretty tasty! I just whisked together the milk and peanut butter, then added the pudding.  I wrapped them individually in tin foil and threw them into the freezer, now that they are frozen, I will put them all in a plastic storage bag.  I will see if the kids eat these up, that will determine if I make them again.
