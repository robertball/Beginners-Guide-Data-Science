Made as is, except esed regular muffin size rather than mini - yielded one dozen.  Cooked at 325 degrees for 25 minutes.  Kids love the flavor and the portability!

I used ground turkey that I spiced up to fake breakfast sausage. I did cut the cheeses back by half and I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream only because I don't keep heavy cream on hand. I did add a few spices (onion powder, garlic powder, Frank's hot sauce, chives). We all loved these. It's like a handheld omelette! I'm glad I cut the cheeses back, if I hadn't I think it might have been too greasy.

I did not like the addition of the instant potato flakes.  It made the quiche too dense.  I would have liked it better if it was less dense.   I did make it in a pie pan instead of individual muffins, but I won't be making it again.  There are better quiche recipes.

These came out perfect. My mini muffin pan was only for 24 and the egg mix was just enough. I didn't have instant potato flakes, so omitted them.  Not missed. They rose like souffles in oven. I'm going to play with this for future renditions with additional herbs, etc, but it is definitely a winner.   Easy party app without a lot of fuss.

I make these all the time - so handy to have the in the freezer for a quick grab (micro) and go breakfast or lunch. I've used many combinations of fillings including, sausage, bacon, hot sausage, peppers (sweet, hot, jalepeno) mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus tips, onions (really whatever I have on hand). I mix up the cheese depending on the filling and what I have in the fridge (cheddar, swiss, gruyere, parmesan, feta, pepper jack, you name it) I also add hot sauce, spices, herbs (whatever makes sense with the other ingredients). 

My Tip:  If using vegetables that are frozen or watery by nature cook them first to get all the water out so they don't seep into the eggs. The veggies won't cook during the baking process!  

I use my LARGE Wilton cupcake pans and for 8 eggs I get 6 "muffin size" eggs cups.  (about half cup of egg to each) One makes a nice meal. I usually make them up on a Sunday, cool, freeze and have them handy all week!

To make this REALLY easy - use the eggs that come in a carton (egg whites) - cuts some calories and gives the same result as whole fresh eggs.

This recipe is very flexible and easy to prepare. I cut it in half and used four, 7oz ramiquins which were sprayed prior to filling, and it was excellent. I did omit the potato flakes as we are on a low carb diet. This is a keeper for future preparations.

Tasty and easy! I used full size muffin cups and agree with 325 for 25 minutes. I also cut the cheese  and sausage in half like other members suggested. I added saut√©ed mushrooms too.

I love the ease of this recipe. Instead of potato flakes I used Quinoa flakes and it turned out moist and not to dense. I used regular size muffin pans.

Yum. Yum and Yum! This was a wonderful Sunday morning breakfast treat. Easy to make and I have plenty left to freeze for the rest of the week. I'll cut back on the salt next time as the sausage was salty enough by itself. Definitely a keeper!

I made this in a regular sized muffin pan.  Very flavorful. Make sure to spray well with cooking spray. I went light on the first batch and had a horrible time getting them out of the pan. Can't wait to try this again with diced ham, will probably add diced sweet peppers as well

My family loves these!  It makes a dozen in a  regular- sized muffin pan, and the three of us could eat them all in one sitting.  I use 1/3 cup potato flakes and not even half the cheese; about 1/2 cup total.  Since I rarely have heavy whipping cream, I have used evaporated milk or half and half; either one works fine.  I have used bacon and ham, whatever I have on hand.  I have to bake them longer, for about 45 min.

The only change I made was to use a different sausage because that was all I had.  It was so easy and tasty. I work full time and I wanted something I could make ahead of time to eat at my desk . This was perfect!!! Like  she said you can change it up but the basic recipe was great. I already shared it with my boss and another co-worker.  Highly recommend for an easy ready to go breakfast.

Made no changes, but next time I will probably use finely grated cheddar. It was a little hard to contain all the ingredients in each mini muffin cup. Delicious though and pretty on a serving platter.

I made it for dinner tonight. Kids and hubby loved it. I altered it a little. Instead of Swiss cheese I used Colby Monterey Jack. In one pan I added baby bella mushrooms and in the other I added orange bell peppers. I also added chives to it.

Great recipe! I just made two batches to take to work tomorrow, and both hubby and I sampled them. He commented we should make some to keep here at home, too. Evaporated milk works great in a pinch in place of heavy cream. I did decrease the amount of cheese and used a half pound of sausage for each batch. Didn't use any extra salt and pepper, and baked at 325 for 25 minutes, since I used the medium size muffin cups. Got exactly two dozen quiches, total. Thank you for the recipe and thanks to the other reviewers for the helpful comments!

I do meal prep on the weekends for quick easy meals on the go. These mini quiches are a snap to make, and so versatile! The only changes I made is I replaced the dehydrated mashed potato flakes with Green Giant califlower rice medley, that I defrosted in the microwave,and hot breakfast sausage.  The writer of these mini quiches states that these can be made anyway you'd like,and it is true since I used a regular muffin pan with each one lined with foil muffin cups. Next time I make these I will drain the sausage grease as I forgot to do as the recipe states and I will add less cheese next time,as I agree with one of the reviews that the amount of cheese in these can make them a little on the greasy side,yet they tasted really good good and I plan on varying ingredients to my liking.

These turned out really well. Made them for Christmas brunch and there were no left-overs. Used bacon instead of sausage. Also used regular size muffin tin - and baked for 30 mins. Next time I will cut back on baking time by a couple of minutes. Very easy recipe.

just making these now, what a pain they were.  too much filling and not enough egg.  And once you put the potatoe into the egg it turns into a gloppy mess that's hard to pour into the muffin tins.  Hopefully they taste better.  But I wont be making these again just for the fact that they are very messy to work with.

Good base recipe for the ingredients I had in the fridge. I like the individual portion size of making them this way, and didn't want a crust, to omit a few calories. I am going to vacuum seal the leftovers for a quick, on-the-go breakfast for my husband.

I liked this recipe:  I needed warm, savory finger foods for a party for 12-14 people, and this attracted my attention.  Everyone really liked them at the party, and I made extras for breakfast the next morning so we didn't have to cook.  The potato flakes give it a little more density and perhaps helps them to hold together when eating them with the fingers.  You can certainly adapt and add to this recipe if you like.  It's especially a good starting point for party food.

Delicious. Made them with the  kids. It was easy and everyone loved them. You can substitute the ingredients. We used bacon.
