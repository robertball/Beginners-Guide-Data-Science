Tried this tonight for dinner because of it's simplicity and the fact that it included all flavors that my family love. It was easy and delicious. I used chicken tenders instead of pounding out chicken breasts and added a dash of lemon pepper seasoning to the chicken while browning. I threw the rice in the rice cooker prior to starting. Even my children ate everything plated instead of the typical separate "piles" of food. Delish!

Yum! I added mushrooms and an extra clove of garlic to the spinach mix. I put a bit extra goat cheese in it was so light flavorful and I will make it again! I did have to add salt.

This was a hit with the whole family. Very simple very tasty. Used walnuts instead of pine nuts since that was what I had on hand. Will be making this again!
