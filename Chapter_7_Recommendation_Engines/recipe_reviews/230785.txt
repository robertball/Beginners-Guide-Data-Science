My family has made this for many many years. In fact it's my fav meal. I like to make this in the crock pot. What I do is boil chicken breast and then put them whole in the crock pot and use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. Use the remaining ingredients listed in this recipe (I use basil only though). I will also add some baby carrots and fresh button mushrooms and let it cook for about 3-4 hrs on low or until you can shred the chicken easily. The "soup" becomes rich and super yummy. My fav toppings are celery, green onion, tomatoes, cheese, chow mien noodles, and a few pineapple chunks. Sooooo good!!

Very easy and delicious! Had my own chicken chunks (which made it easier). Made up the gravy (this really is what makes the recipe yummy). Then you add whatever you prefer on top. Personally I used what the recipe called for. It was wonderful. Thanks for posting "J".

Oh, folks! This is the best! But the thing that takes this over the top is a nice, light, fluffy, iced cinnamon roll! --- I've made a version of this for years! We call it Javanese. I was taught to use leftover turkey and turkey gravy instead of chicken & mushroom soup.  Families I know who use this as an 'after Thanksgiving' meal enjoy it more than the big feast!!!  We personally like to toast the coconut, and we never used chow mein noodles, and I think I'll continue to pass on them (since they are fried), but I'm sure they would taste really good in this dish.  Really, you can't go wrong with this type of dish..... YUM!

Very good.  I made it as written.  The basil & broth were different than my mother's "ad-lib" version.  I think I like this recipe better than my mother's!  Shhh...

I thought the ingredients were odd but my husband said they worked will together. This will be an option other than fried rice to use up veggies, rice and cooked chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

Did I do something wrong? I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was awful. Extremely bland. The toppings were good choices but anyone can chop a few veggies. This was really a disappointment compared to other Hawaiian haystacks I’ve had in the past. I have no idea why this was so highly rated.

It's a lot of work to cut up raw chicken, but the dish was very good.  Perhaps next time I will use precooked leftover chicken or rotisserie chicken. I really loved this fun idea for serving.  Not everyone likes the same "toppings", so I did put some of them on the side.  The cream sauce was excellent.  It must be served right away to keep the rice from getting soggy.  The second batch I added some sour cream in place of the broth, which made it a little thicker.

My son asked for this and while I thought it looked absolutely gross, it turned out great. I already am going to make it again. I just changed a few things to fit our personal taste, but the recipe was a great way to start.

I made this tonight and I enjoyed all the veggies and toppings. I didn't like the creamy sauce, though, so I'd like to experiment with something else.

Made this recipe EXACTLY as written.  Never had anything like this, so I can't compare.  I hated it , hubby liked it, so 3 stars.
I found the chicken mixture heavy and tasting like paste. None of the flavors mingled!  I like the idea. If I ever make it again:  I will use fresh mushrooms, a pineapple chicken base, and make the chicken a little more tangy.

We had a luau and I added this to the menu.  Careful because it heaps very high with all the layers!   Everyone thought it was very yummy.  Surprisingly flavourful even though there were so few spices used!

I didn't have the coconut so i couldn't use that and it was still good.  I also used peanuts instead of almonds.  I will definitely make this again it was so easy and my family loved it!

Good basic recipe. I used the amount of chicken stated in recipe, but used twice as much cream of mushroom soup and broth for extra moisture and gravy. I think I will try one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken next time.
