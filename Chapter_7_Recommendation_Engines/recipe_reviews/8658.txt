Three stars as written since it is clearly lacking in much seasoning, however, with a little tweaking this is easily a five star dish. I sauteed the mushrooms and onion first (I used shallots and added a couple shots of Worcestershire sauce) then removed that from the pan and set it aside while I cooked the chicken (I used turkey cutlets) which I had dredged in flour before sauteeing.  Once nicely browned I removed the meat and deglazed the pan with all those wonderful browned bits with chicken broth and white wine. I let that reduce to about half its volume, then swirled in a few pats of butter.  I served the cutlets over fresh sauteed spinach, topped them with the mushroom/shallot mixture, then poured that luscious sauce over it all.  Loved it.

Will definitely make this again. Was very please with how quick & easy it was to make.   
Used bottled crushed garlic on chicken and in sauce and used frozen mushrooms(all I had). Will use a larger "sweet"
onion and fresh wild mushrooms next time. Also added a couple of generous glugs of a dry white wine during cooking and before serving also added a bit more butter and let sauce reduce. 
Served with Fettuccine Florentine, mixed spring greens and garlic rolls.

This recipe was SOoooo good.  I went heavy on the spices since I read a couple people thought it was bland. Also,  I was a little scared by how the "sauce" looked... sort of like pizza grease.  SO,  I added about 1/2 C. cream to the sauce,  and it was a beautiful thing.  Served over Bowties. :)  Thanks for the recipe,  its a keeper!

Great recipe - however I did tweak it a little bit. I followed the general flow of the recipe but I added: lightly floured the chicken breasts before saute - then sprinkled the paprika, salt and pepper on top while cooking. Once the breasts were cooked, and the mushrooms and shallots (replaced onions) were soft, I removed the chicken and set aside. I deglazed the pan with a little more butter and then my key ingredient - one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. I added 3 tbsp on water and cooked for 3 minutes. Viola. Lovely recipe - a keeper for sure!

I thought this dish was excellent as is. When people add this, take out that, it's not the same recipe so how can you rate it...especially rate it low. It becomes a new recipe when you do all that.

Very good!
I used fresh minced garlic in place of the powder based on the advice of other reviewers.
All the flavours from the different ingredients blend so well together!
My boyfriend is easily tired of chicken but he loved this.

This was a enjoyable dish. I did make a couple of modifications based on other comments. I used about 2 1/2 tsp of paprika and I added about 1/3 cup of cream at the end.  I will make this dish again. However,  the next time I will add more cream (1/2-2/3 cup) to make more of a sauce. 

I served with spinach and buttered whole wheat pasta.

Very tasty! I cut down the butter by using butter flavored cooking spray to start the chicken, then added butter when doing the vegetable.  It still made a sauce. I tried using a Ziploc bag to coat the chicken, but found too much of the spices landed on the first piece. Definitely will just sprinkle it next time.  I sliced the leftover chicken and used it for a salad the next day. Delicious!

Very tasty dish. Is easy to make and pleasing to the eye.  I served with Quinoa as the side and a simple tossed salad. Will make this a regular on our table.

This was delicious, and just what I was craving. I served it over egg noodles and it tasted like Hungarian comfort food.  I used way more spice than called for (I always do, I like highly flavored food), and I added white wine to the sauce when I flipped the chicken.  After the chicken was cooked through I removed it from the pan and let the mushrooms and onions cook in the uncovered pan for another 10 minutes to let the sauce reduce.
YUM!

I served this over angel hair pasta which I very lightly buttered. The mushrooms were so good! But I did sprinkle some onion powder in with them so they wouldn't taste as buttery. I liberally sprinkled the chicken with the spices, so no problem with blandness. Used extra mushrooms too.
Served with hot, crispy whole wheat rolls.

Excellent, though I used a little less butter than called for. Very moist. My daughter came in while I was cooking and said, "Mom, it smells like a restaurant in here!"

This recipes was AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!  (And easy to boot!)  I followed other reviews advice and prepared the chicken with a bit moe seasoning than called for.  I used quite a bit more pepper, salt, paprika, and used minced garlic (instead of granulated...trust me it is WORTH IT to make this change!)  I basically prepared the chicken exactly as directed, but I used an entire package of sliced mushrooms and half of a large sweet yellow onion in rings.  I cooked everything a per directions.  I did use approximately 3/4 of a stick of Smart Balance Butter Blends as opposed to 1/4 cup of butter and it worked well.  Rather than leaving this recipe as it was written, I decided to try to take it to the "Next level!"  As the mushrooms and onions were finishing, I added 1/4 cup of crumbled bacon.  To save time, I used the Hormel (bagged) crumbled bacon.  I finished the dish once everything had cooked down/reduced with 1 and 1/2 cups of half and half and let it return to a boil.  Then I removed it from the heat and Voila!  Dinner was done!  I highly recommend serving this with mashed potatoes or noodles.  My husband gave it an 8.9 out of 10 and asked if I would make it again soon.  Overall it was a grand success!

We've enjoyed this chicken dish several times now and it is equally good served over steamed rice or with roasted potatoes & a side salad. The mushrooms and sauce are delicious and the chicken breasts always come out moist & tender. I always use fresh minced garlic instead of the powder & add it to the skillet when adding the onions & mushrooms. This dish is always a pleaser! Thanks for the recipe! :)

One of the best chicken dishes ive ever sat down to!  I recommend when it tells you to simmer it, add some chicken broth to it and it will give you a great add of flavor to the dish.

I loved the recipe. I didn't find it bland at all because I used finely ground white pepper instead of black pepper. I usually cook with it to hide the pepper from my kid, but you have to be careful because it's strong. I did everything else according to the recipe and served it over bow tie noodles with fresh broccoli. My husband thinks it's worthy of becoming part of my standard lineup.

I don't like to rate a recipe on changes that I made because that isn't fair, so this rating is what the recipe would have been without my changes.  To reduce the fat content, I used a butter flavored pan spray, a tiny bit of real butter, and white wine. Based on reviews, I doubled the paprika.  I cooked minced garlic (from a jar), mushrooms (from a jar) and onion for about 3 or 4 minutes.  I removed them with a slotted spoon, added a bit more white wine and cooked the chicken for 10 minutes.  When I turned the chicken, I put the mushroom mixture back in on top of the chicken and finished cooking.  DH and I really liked it.  I served it with quinoa (which I fix with chicken broth to give it more protein and because it tastes better that way - quinoa is much tastier and healthier than rice!) and sliced fresh tomatoes from a local hydroponic farm.  Thanks Marlana for a good recipe.

Woww...it taste so delicious!!  I definately will make this again and again.  I made some changes to this recipe, i.e. 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp salt, lots of black pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder (but will try using fresh garlic next time), 1 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 tbsp butter (to prevent burn) and 1/2 big onion (chopped), 3 skinless & boneless chicken breast (cut half the thickness to 2 pieces) and 1 lb fresh button mushroom.

The only real change was that I baked it.  Still seasoned both sides of the chicken, maybe used a bit more paprika than stated, but I just guessed on all seasonings.  Then topped the chicken with onion and mushroom.  Melted a tablespoon of butter and drizzled over top then added some thin slices of butter around the chicken (approximately another tbsp, so the onions/mushrooms not on the chicken had some good flavor)  Baked about an hour at 350 (thicker breasts).  Served with whole grain wheat pilaf and a salad.  Certainly a keeper and will definitely make again.  I think a little white wine may be a good addition as well.

This is too plain and too bland. I only made 2 chicken breasts and the seasoning that it calls for (for 4) is way too little for 2 breasts. I decided to be liberal with all the seasonings. I added white wine to the pan at the end so that I could have more of a sauce. Next time I will add lots of fresh garlic, and maybe half and half or cream. I served this over spaghetti. The concept is great, you just need to bump up the seasonings BIG TIME! The cooking time is way too long as well. You don't want to overcook your chicken. It will taste dry regardless of how much sauce you have. If you pounded your breasts thin as it says, 5 minutes each side should be good enough. It was certainly good enough for mine. Watch the time!!

I just threw every thing in a baking dish and baked on 375 for 35 minutes. It came out GREAT. Everyone really liked it.

I made this last night. The aroma while it was cooking was wonderful. Chicken was moist and tender.  I didn't have mushrooms so I left them out. I cooked the onion in the butter to begin with and added 1/2 tsp minced garlic instead of the powder. Everyone liked it I will make it again.

My fiance and I LOVED this recipe.  I added minced garlic to the recipe and was very liberal with the spices.  I will definitely cook again!

This was suprisingly flavourful, especially considering how easy it was to prepare.  I don't like to cook with butter because of the added calories and how easily it scorches, so I used about a half a cup of chicken broth with just a tiny pat of butter.  I'll definitely be making this dish again regularly.

I made this last night when my g/f came over.  Because she is on carb free diet, I served it over a bed of steamed baby spinach. I had only 1 whole breast so I cut it in wide strips.  I also used a mix of 2/3 sweet paprika and 1/3 smoked paprika.  She gave it a 5 star thumbs up!

Quick and excellent!  Even my reluctant to eat it 11 year old said, "This isn't so bad!" (lol)  I didn't measure the spices and just sprinkled them on both sides of my un-pounded chicken.  I also added about 1 TBSP of jar garlic to the butter as it melted.  Not sure how much what I changed effected the outcome, but our meal was great!  I served it over a bed of garlic mashed red potatoes.  This will become one of our "regular" meals!

I did this a little different.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic in about a tablespoon of butter, then added a tblsp of olive oil and a tsp of balsamic vinegar at the end.  Then I put chicken breast tenders in a baking dish, seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika, and covered with the mushroom mixture.  Then I baked it in an oven at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.  Decreased the fat a little (though it was added to the mashed potatoes instead...).  it still needs a little something as seasoning, I think.  I'm not sure what, though.

Used 1 clove garlic minced in addition to the pinch of garlic powder on the chicken. Also added a couple of splashes of white wine. Very good will make again.

So simple and absolutely delicious! It smelled wonderful and tasted just as good~ the only change I made was instead of the spices, I just used Lawry's seasoned salt.  Shortened up the cooking time a bit as well. Hubby raved that this was fabulous!  P.S. Served atop mashed potatoes and a side of roasted asparagus.

I picked this recipe because I was in a hurry and this looked quick and I had all the ingredients.  I didn't expect much from it though, it looked too basic.  We really liked it!  I was surprised how good it was. I give it 4 stars because my butter actually got a little burnt, rather than carmelized.  I will make this again though!

This one is 5 stars all around... delicious, easy to prepare, fairly quick, inexpensive, and easy to find/have on hand ingredients!!  YUM!  I followed the recipe to the T, except I didn't measure spices, just coated heavily, and it was perfect!  Will make again and again!

Great dish and a different way to cook chicken.  Used fresh garlic cloves and a little more paprika than called for in the recipie.  Also, I simmered the chicken covered on low for about 20 minutes before adding the sliced onions and the chicken was easy to tear apart for smaller, bite-sized pieces.  Seemed to give the chicken even more flavor as each piece was able to soak up the butter sauce.  Yummy!

I've just started cooking for myself regularly and found this to be a nice, easy, tasty meal.  Personally I'd go a little light on the garlic powder though because it can be a little overpowering.

SOOOO GOOD! I first dipped the chicken breasts into a battered egg, then into some flour to coat.  I then added the paprika, garlic and S&P liberally (I tried to lightly rub it in without taking off all the flour coating and then when they were in the pan, sprinkled a little more on each side).  Cooked per normal and served with Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice. Not bland at all...I just wish I would have made more.  And it cooked in so little time!  Hmmmm good.

This was very good! I used canned mushrooms and it was still delish! I did add butter and half and half at the end and simmered it to make a super-yummy creamy sauce. Hubby said this is a keeper!

I made this in two separate skillets, in one, I used 'Regular' Paprika, and in the other, I used Hungarian Paprika...  will be using only Hungarian Paprika from now on, we all enjoyed it the most.  Great served over noodles of any kind, with cool tomato quarters, cucumber slices, strips of Red & Yellow Peppers on the side.  EeYum!  Thanks!

just made this last night according to recipe & it was totally awesome! My husband even ate 1/2 of my piece & just couldn't get enough. I only used 2 chicken breasts, but put the same amount of onion/mushroom combo & that gave us more "goodies"! A definite keeper :)

Good solid recipe, but I did follow the top reviewer's tips.  Next time I would chop the onions; the rings were a bit too much.  I deglazed with chicken broth only, then thickened a bit with cornstarch/cold water.

I've made a lot of recipes from Allrecipes and this one ranks high on the list!  This was very good!  And it was fast and simple and that's important to me at the end of a long work day.  A lot of people seemed to complain about blandness, but mine was far from bland.  I seasoned it to what we like and everyone can do this as well.  Some people like a lot of garlic, some not so much.  I salted the breasts on each side, sprinkled with paprika and also sprinkled a garlic/herb blend (from McCormick) that included pepper.  I did this when it was in the pan, as opposed to doing it beforehand.  Other than that, I did add some half and half (would love cream but trying to cut the calories).  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe called for.  And it was very, very tender and yummy!  The mushrooms and onions complimented it very well!  I had leftovers at the office the next day and it was just as excellent.  Definately makes it in my recipe rotation and thanks for sharing it!

I used minced garlic instead of powder heated in the butter first and added the mushrooms in last with some soy sauce and balsalmic vinegar and let it simmer. Very tasty.

I'm one of the AR people who are overly enthusiastic about recipes--- giving most 5 stars.  This one, however, was extremely lacking.  Not much flavor and a weird, greasy taste.

This was absolutely delicious!  Very easy to make.  I took some reviewers tips and added minced garlic to the butter and then some white cooking wine.  I willl definitely make this again!

Very nice and easy recipe!  I made the following changes: Added one green bell peppper; sauteed onions, mushrooms, and green pepper separately (otherwise they become a little soggy), and added them 3 minutes before the chicken was ready.

I thought this was SO yummy!! Made some changes as others recommended: 1.Added a ton of pepper, garlic salt and paprika and then added more when I added the mushrooms. 2.Before adding vegetables I addded 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup water and 1 bouillon cube to the skillet to make a gravy. 3.Once the mushrooms cooked down I took the chicken out and added 2/3 cup of milk brought to a boil- added 1/2 a pound of cooked fettucine and then served. LOVE THIS RECIPE PREMISE- VERY EASY!!

Excellent.  For people who think its too bland, make sure your spices are not too old.  I also used some very good hot Hungarian paprika.  Next time I plan to use some cream with a little brandy in it for the sauce.

This was really good. Didn't measure the seasoning,just put it on to my liking.Used a little more paprika than it called for. I used 1/2 olive oil,1/2 butter for the sauce. I was just a little disappointed because I would of liked more sauce than it made. I would make this again soon.

I thought this was excellent!  I'm used to a Chicken Paprikash with cream, but this is a good way to have that good paprika flavor without the fat and calories!  I will definitely make again, but I will try to make more juice, perhaps by adding about 1/2 cup of chicken broth!  Need lots of good juice to top the egg noodles or spatzle I serve with it! YUM!

This is super simple,and quite delicious. Very kid-friendly, mine all loved it.
It's important to add more spices - at lest 3 tsp. paprika and plenty of garlic powder. I also used canned mushrooms rather than fresh, and olive oil instead of butter, and it was still great. Serve over rice.

This recipe is sooo good...I did slightly flour the chicken before adding the seasonings...Hungarian paprika has a rather strong flavor so I used the Hungarian variety (the sweet, not the hot)...I also used a large MAUI onion, and added about 1/3 cup white wine.  It was a big hit with my family, and leftovers were wonderful, too! I also used  1 tsp.granulated garlic.

My Hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe, but we both agree that another whole onion in it would of made it better.  We also added just a little salt at the end. We served it with vermicelli, and just loved it.

Outstanding!  So easy and the most tasty chicken I have had in along time. I was very generous with the seasonings and use crimimi mushrooms. This is going to be a regular.

This turned out tasting pretty good.  I went a little heavier on the paprika and used some olive oil in lieu of all the butter.  Made the fiancee happy on her birthday.  The mushrooms and onions were awesome!

Best chicken breast recipe! The meat came out so tender and rich in flavor. I believe covering while cooking helped force the flavor of sauce into the meat. I followed the recipe exactly except 1) substituted crushed garlic for garlic sauce; 2) added a pinch of cooking wine; and 3) added a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. I chose not to coat the chicken in flour and was glad I didn't--the slightly burnt surface was to die for! Great recipe overall, thanks Marlana!

My husband loved this!  I used 8 chicken thighs as I had no chicken breasts in the freezer and was generous with the California garlic powder.  Very easy to prepare in my electric skillet in an effort to keep the kitchen cooler.  Will definitely be putting this recipe in our meal rotation.

This is the second time I have made this. The first time I followed the recipe but to me it was a bit bland and needed a punch. This time I used 2 cloves of garlic minced, 2 shallots minced, half an onion cut up, I also put flour in a zip bag and seasoned it with smoked paprika, salt and pepper. I dredged my chicken in the flour and browned in some butter and olive oil. I put the chicken in a baking pan once they were browned and put my shallot, onion and garlic in the pan with a bit more butter till soften, added my mushrooms and let it cook down. Then when the mixture was cooked down I sprinkled about 3 tablespoons of my seasoned flour over the mixture and cooked it a couple of minutes. I added a half of a cup of dry white wine and let reduce. Then I added approximately 2 cups of chicken broth until it was thickened and added 2 teaspoons of fresh thyme and poured over my chicken. I placed it in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes. I covered the baking pan with foil. It was delicious. My family loved the new rendition. Thanks for a great starter recipe that you can make to your own tastes.

This was good. I would have given it 4 stars, but I amended the recipe a bit, so I decided that I should amend my rating as well.  I omitted the mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand. I added more garlic powder and fresh diced garlic. I sauted the onions and garlic in a pan first until soft and golden brown.  I browned the seasoned chicken cutlets in the pan with the browned onions/garlic and then added a can of cream of potato soup.  I sauted it all for about 3 minutes and added a 1/4 cup of half and half and then put it all in a glass dish, mixed in a pack of brown gravy mix and covered in foil and baked on 350 for 20 minutes. This was yummy!!! We will definitely make again.

This was so delicious! I did think the sauce didnt make much of a sauce so next time I will use cream or white wine at the end.  Also, I will kick up the seasoning next time. But all in all a tasty dish that everyone loved!

My husband mentioned to me twice that this was a keeper recipe...guess he liked it! I prepared it exactly as written but used about a 1/2 tesp of garlic, and it was very easy. Our home grown Walla Walla Sweet onions were key. Yes, the juices at the end were thin, and I suppose lightly flouring the chicken before cooking them would eliminate that. But the mixture of flavors was excellent. Thanks for sharing~

Yum! I made this for dinner tonight with a few tweaks. I used olive oil in place of the butter and added celery. I didn't measure the seasonings, but it came out really well!

I'm only giving this 4 out of 5 stars because I had to tweak it a bit. I added a little bit of white wine, minced garlic, and extra paprika after I turned the chicken but I tend to like my sauces a little thicker and creamier, so I added some cream cheese (about 1/4 cup) at the very end. Loved it! I'll definitely make this again.

This was an amazing recipe! Although when I first started cooking, I had my doubts. I used chicken breast tenderloin and did not measure the spices. I use garlic powder, paprike and pepper liberally and then a dash of salt. I put the onions in with the chicken at the beginning and cooked, covered, for 6 minutes. i then turned the chicken, added shitake mushrooms, and cooked for an additional 5 minutes. It was incredibly good and I will definitely be making this again.

After reading the previous reviews I added extra spices extra paprika, salt, blk pp, fresh garlic, garlic salt and cayenne. Even after all of that my dish still tasted it was soaked in butter and I couldnt taste anything else.

This was quick and easy :) I followed some of the other reviews pound out chicken covered with paprika, cayenne pepper for a nice kick, and sprinkled a little salt, pepper, and galic powder. Then coated with a THIN layer of flour seasoned with black pepper and cooked in an electric skillet at 300 degrees skin down for 8 mins then flipped added mushrooms and onions and cooked for 7 mins. Removed chicken added more butter to deglaze and saute mushrooms and onions. Scrapped all the burned stuff out and added cream of Mushroom and 3 tablespoons of water cooked at 250 for 5 mins....served over chicken. Juicy, tender, spicy and DELICIOUS!!!! Will make again! Thanks!

I was tempted to follow reviewer's suggestions and add soup or cook the mushrooms & onions separately. I may experiment with these things later but I think it's important to try the recipe as is first. It was delicious and I will make it again for sure!

This was okay. Will use less paprika if I make again and a little adobo or accent for a hint more flavoring. But, quick, easy convenient meal for a busy person on the go.

The idea of this recipe was better than the final taste.  I thought it didn't a little more flavor.  Next time I will use a salad dressing instead of butter to give it a little something, but the cooking method went really well!

Tasted fantastic! I found that I could "cheat" a little and use frozen chicken breasts and canned mushrooms for this. It would be probably be a slightly different flavor with fresh, but those are hard to get in my area (well, good ones anyway). Very easy to make, too! My son could even handle most of the steps!

How wonderful! There are only a few minor changes I made based on other reviews: 1. There were too much of the onions/mushrooms.  I only used two chicken breasts, and a quarter of the total amount of vegetables called for was still a lot.  2. I put the veggies and chicken in a bowl and tossed with the paprika, salt and pepper, plus Tony's seasoning and parsley. 3. I cooked the veggies to soften them, then I sprinkled each side of the chicken with flour and cooked as directed, re-adding the veggies during the last half. 4. Finally I took it all out, added a little butter and cream, but everything back in, and voila! Excellence! Served with rice and spinach and it was fantastic. And the best part is that the few ingredients needed means I can make it as a last-minute dinner option when needed. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good and easy. I seasoned 6 thinly sliced chicken breast pieces very generously with the spices and sauteed them in butter and olive oil until they were a lovely golden brown. The mushrooms and onions were a great addition. I would have liked for there to be more of a "gravy". Next time I will add some chicken broth/white wine as other reviewers did. Served with brown rice and broccoli.

This a fairly good.  We did like it, but felt it was missing something. It would be much better if you added sour cream and/or milk to the sauce to make a paprika cream sauce. I, too used minced galric in place of the garlic salt which has a much fresher taste.  The onions and mushrooms were divine.

This recipe is very close to being Chicken Paprikash.  The difference is, at the end you would add sour cream to thicken it up and help with the greasy/creamy issue.  Very yummy.

This was so incredibly good!  I only made a few  small changes....added a couple of dashes of worcestershire while sauteeing the onion and mushroom, added Lawry's season salt, and used jarred chopped garlic instead of garlic powder.  This will definitely be added to my regular rotation!

I made this recipe pretty much as written but wasn't overly impressed. The taste of the butter overwhelmed everything else, even with doubling the amount of paprika and using a tablespoon of minced garlic. It was much too greasy for me with not enough flavor to justify my eating it. I would need to play around with the ingredients and add some things to make it seem right.

My boyfriend and I both agree that this recipe is "good." It's not great, and that's with the few changes I made. I don't really measure spices, so I used the garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. I definitely used a lot more than the recipe called for, and it probably could have used more. I would not suggest cooking the chicken covered on both sides for 10 minutes. It would have been way overcooked. I used two onions, and I added a splash of white wine. I had no problems with the chicken being dry. I do, however, think that the juice I had left over would have been too runny for a pasta (I served it with rice). Perhaps for pasta you might want to add a bit of whipping cream or milk. Overall, this was better than just plain chicken, but it didn't have the wow factor.

With the exception of using minced garlic (opting out garlic powder), I followed the recipe to a T. My only problems was the cooking time for the chicken (I had doubts about cooking it 10 mins on each side, should have followed my gut instincts). The chicken came out dry and tough.

I made this last night for my family and it was DELICIOUS. I served it with whole wheat egg noodles and corn. Everyone loved it. My dad said he wanted to stop eating it, but couldn't because it was so good.  All the flavors come together and the taste was just wonderful. I will definitely be making this again. Fantastic recipe.

This chicken recipe is really good. I added fresh garlic, the onions, paprika, salt, pepper and a couple Tbsp of olive oil and kept in the fridge for a few hours before preparing it to get more flavor. I used only a couple Tbsp of butter instead of 1/4 cup, some white wine and baby bella mushrooms (that's what I had at home). It turned out delicious.

I was skeptical that the onions and mushrooms would cook through using the directions in this recipe, but they turned out great (the best part of the dish, actually!).  There was just enough 'sauce' to serve over our pasta side.

Although I added double amount of paprika, it tastes Just Great.  Only the chicken gets too dry without being marinated.

The flavor was great, and mellow enough for even the pickiest kids, but best of all it is so easy!  I made this on New Year's Day.  I was not in the serious cooking mode - but this was as easy as making sandwiches for everyone.  I will definitely remember this one for busy nights.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  When adding the mushrooms and onions, I give them a light sweep of more garlic powder, as well as sprinkle the entire dish pretty liberally with parsley and pepper.  These additions really boost the flavor factor, and make for a healthy, delicious meal.

I think that it needed more paprika, but it was still awesome.  I liked the way the onions and mushroom's complimented the dish and though fattening, the butter sauce really gave the chicken flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice recipe. I used 1/2 lb Portabella and 1/2 lb white mushrooms, used real Garlic, diced zucchini and added white wine.  I decided to put it with Gnocchi as the carbohydrate element to the meal.  It was REALLY good the next day for lunch too.

Pretty freakin good!!  We added more paprika by about a tea spoon or so and used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. I also dredged the chicken in some of the liquid from the jar of minced garlic before applying the paprika mixture. Good with seasoned mashed potatos( we used basil, oregeno, more garlic, and a little seasoned salt).

I should qualify my rating by saying this just wasn't for us.  We like food with flavor.  If you enjoy bland food, you would like this dish.  I used the spices very liberally and it still tasted extremely mild.

This recipe sounded wonderful, but to me, tasted a bit bland.  I think that next time I will maybe add some more zip to this...
(I rated the kid friendly rating like I did because I don't have kids or friends with kids, and don't know what they would think of it!  Sorry!)

I originally gave this recipe three stars.  My mother made it again last night:  it was absolutely delicous!  What  a wonderful, wonderful little meal.
I'm not sure what I did wrong the first time;  she said she followed the recipe exactly last night.  
Wonderful, tender, not too spicy, not too bland.
I was most impressed!

Made this tonight following recepie exactly, except used fresh squeezed garlic rubbed on chicken prior to salt, pepper and paprika.  This was absolutely delishious.  The sauce was the right consistency and full of flavor.  I did use papriks liberally on the chicken as I was concerned it would not be browned enough being cooked with the cover on, but that was a needless worry it browned just fine.  My huband who usually complains a bit to have chicken "again" pratically licked his plate.  A definite winner and I wouldn't change a thing other than I used fresh garlic mostly becuase I did not have garlic powder.  I served it with brocoli and red potatoes.

Butterflied two breasts and pounded them, mixed the seasonings with flour and dipped them and pan fried as recipe states. I cut the onions in half instead of leaving as rings because I thought they'd cook a little better. Husband gave it thumbs up. Quick and easy enough for a mid-week supper.

This was really good.  Followed the recipe but after 20 min I removed the chicken (set aside, covered) added 1 tsp flour and let the mushrooms and onions simmer another 5 min.  Will definitely make again!

Good recipe.  I like others doubled up on the spices.  And I added a little white wine and cream to the sauce.  Served on whole grain pasta with broccoli.  I'll make this again.

5 Stars with my simple changes -- saute mushrooms and onions first in pan with some butter and Worcestershire sauce. Remove.  -- bread chicken with sage spice. Saute in pan with butter. Remove and then add 1 c chicken broth and some red wine -- reduce to 1/2 and add a bit of flour to thicken. Lay chicken on plate, put sauteed mushrooms and onions on top and then then pour the yummy sauce on top!

The mushroom sauce is amazing and decadent. Worth the indulgence of butter. I would recommend maybe cooking it over a little bit lower heat. On my gas stove on medium for the 10 minutes on each side the chicken was bit overdone, but still delicious!

Tried this today, and it was great. I served it with garlic mash potatoes. The chicken came out juicy and full of flavor. YUM!

I loved it...I followed the recipe except I added fresh garlic, sliced thin (in addition to the powder, which I went very lightly on), and used canned mushrooms.  My family loved it too..next time I'll use fresh mushrooms.  Mmmm!

I really didn't find this as great as some of the other reviewers. I followed some of the suggested changes- lots of extra seasoning, added cream to the sauce, and this was still bland and the sauce was very thin. We ate it, but I won't make it again.

I'll give this a 4 for ease, taste was maybe 3.  Very easy recipe but nothing to really get excited over.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe I'll try the advice of some reviewers and try it with a cream sauce and see if that makes any difference.

Four stars for taste, but 20 minutes total cooking time was way too much. I'm surprised no one else thought so. My chicken was overdone. I'm going to pare down the cooking time to first, 2 minutes on one side, then turning, and 2 minutes (or until tender),

Just made this for lunch, I like it but lack of some spices and not so saucy. I followed exactly the directions and mine was not very saucy but it's still good. We have it with spaghetti and mash potato.   Definitely will do it again with additional butter and spices as other comments, and will butter the spaghetti. :D

I made it last night for my girlfriend and she loved it.  I thought the sauce was a little bland (needed just a bit more spice), the only variation I made was when all that was left was the sauce I added a little milk.  I also layed it on some angel hair pasta with a side of steamed baby snow peas.  Great Dish easy to make and fun to cook.

Simple, quick, and yet quite tasty. The flavors meld together quite well, so that it's not just "paprika" but an overall flavorful dish.

I enjoyed this but I didn't use mushrooms ( don't like them ) but I used a seasoning blend of red bell peppers, onions and celery. I have may have been too liberal with the paprika, I did hear mix reviews that I got it too hot but others thought it was fine! I'm sorry Cowboy. But I also wanted to say that I had leftover potato and zucchini bake for a side that I got from this very site!

This dish was very good.  Much more exciting than plain ol' chicken breast.  The only changes I made was to add some minced garlic and a splash of milk to the sauce while it was cooking down.  I served it on top of mashed potatoes, and will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe!  Very easy to do, I've also cut my chicken brest into 1-1/2 inch strips, i've also used red oinons it also add nice color to your plate. If any one knows what side veggies to use that will complement this please let me know.

Had leftover cooked chicken to use - so just sauteed the onion and mushrooms until caramelized, then added the paprika and garlic powder, s & p,  the cooked chicken and some chardonnay.  Simmered until the juices reduced a bit to a sauce and then served over angel hair pasta.  I would definitely make this again, either following the recipe's directions or my way depending on whether I'm using cooked or uncooked chicken.

My family enjoyed a lot. I did add some white wine and a little heavy cream to the butter sauce and added a little flour to thicken it up. I also did not cook the chicken as long as stated. I just watched until juices were clear and the chicken came out nice and tender. Will make again!

I am always on the lookout for quick, easy and most important tasty chicken recipes.  This one fit all categories.  My husband and I both loved it.  Next time I will add more onions (just because I love onions).  Excellent recipe.

My husband gave this recipe two thumbs up! I dredged the chicken in flour before seasoning, and only used about 2 tbsp butter to cut down on fat. Splashed some white wine over chicken while cooking, and added less than 3 tbsp half and half cream to the sauce before serving. Coating the chicken in flour before really made the sauce thicken up. Thanks!

Dry and bland. Ending up mixing it in with a salad because I couldn't eat it on its own.

This is a delicious recipe.  I used chicken tenderloins and added a little garlic, beef broth and a cup of sour cream.  Yummy!!

I am officially a mushroom lover.  I remember not liking them as a kid, but I used them anyway, thinking I should stick with the recipe.  The flavor they added was great.  I also added a half cup of cream to make sure I had enough sauce.  The sauce turned out delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great flavor and color. The mushrooms were a great touch. We did have to add a bit of cornstarch to get the sauce thicker. Also, next time I think we may add some corn or other vegetables as the sauce was so good. Maybe serve it on rice.

Delicious, easy and will certainly make again. If chicken is pounded really thin, it cooks faster. I only did two breasts and they filled the pan. Doing four, make sure you use a very large pan! You will also have to compensate by making sure the mushrooms are in long enough to get properly browned. I almost always cut the butter a bit with veg.oil. I did add more than a pinch of garlic pwdr and probably more than a tsp of paprika. I just coated til I thought it looked good. I served it with steamed/buttered & seasoned cabbage and onion (Jamaican style).Thanks Mariana

Either grits or polenta makes a good side dish instead of pasta, if you already have enough pasta dishes. Incidentally, both grits and polenta are much easier to prepate in the microwave by running on high for 10 minutes then stirring and repeating cycle to desired consistancy.

This was just okay.  I think it would be better if the sauce was thickened.  I was very liberal with the spices since others said it was somewhat bland. I also added some red pepper to kick it up a little.  I probably would not make it again.

I made this last night and it was good and mushrooms aren't my favortie thing. 

I added Adobo to the chicken to flavor it, and a flew splashes of Sherry cooking wine.  I also added a bit more Adobo on the mushrooms towards the end and the chicken and mushrooms were very flavorful.

This was exceptionally easy and quick to make.  I followed the exact recipe as published and was very pleased with the results. In fact, surprisingly pleased.  I think next time I'll add just a splash of wine though.

This recipe was very good, but seemed like it was missing a little something.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (may have had something to do with it) and instead of paprika (which I didn't have on hand) I used Emeril's Essence seasoning (which is made of mostly paprika anyway).  I would make this again, but I like my food a bit spicier.

Fantastic! The onion and mushrooms still had a bit of firmness. The sauce awesome. I was a bit skeptical reading some of the reviews of being too bland - liberally seasoned the chicken breasts like the recipe called for. Well done!

I actually used the bag mix of frozen mushrooms from Trader Joe’s and Smoked Paprika! Next time I will use avocado oil instead of bitter for a healthier fat. I also had leftover sautéed shallots and I threw them in too. It was delicious. And, yes, I am a “wing it” cook! This I will repeat!

Absolutely loved it.  I would suggest only one change:  I feel that 1/2" breasts only need to be cooked for 5 mins. on each covered.  They will be cooked through yet retain their tender juiciness.  Then, remove cover as directed for last 5 mins.  The sauce is amazing.  I will make again and serve to guests, not just family.

Very good, chicken remained moist.  (I used unsalted butter for this recipe since mushrooms are high in sodium) 

I put additional pepper, paprika, garlic powder and 1 TBSP of unsalted butter when adding the onions and mushrooms.  Served this dish with asparagus.

Excellent! I did make a few minor changes.  Did not use butter.  Sauteed in olive oil.  Sauteed onion & real garlic, added mushrooms after a couple minutes.  Removed from pan.  Cooked chicken breasts.  Removed from pan.  Added chicken broth, red pepper flakes and a little bit of white wine.  brought to low boil.  thickened with cornstarch.  Put mushroom/onion mix and chicken  back in and warmed.

3 stars per the recipe.  The methodology is good, it just needs a kick in the pants with flavor.  Next time I'm going to follow the other suggestions for flavor enhancing.

Made as written, very good but next time will use more butter and spices would also add a little crushed red pepper. It was good don't get me wrong it was just in need of more seasoning.

Loved it but it would be a good idea to add some additional spices. Also, sauté shallots (used instead of onions).

I would have only given it 4.5 stars if that was an option. It wasn't quite fancy enough to be 5 stars. I try to follow recipes the first time I make a dish - next time I will double the onions and mushrooms and tossing in some white wine would be good the next time I have some on hand. I also didn't measure out my spices but was fairly liberal with them when I sprinkled it on because my family loves spicy food.  I served it with skin-on mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. Both the husband and picky son liked the flavor of the chicken.

Great starting out mildly spiced chicken recipe with room to enjoy some of your favorites. Chicken and mushrooms! All you need is less yellow onion and more green onion. Don't be afraid of your inner roots and add a teaspoon of turmeric. I also added dry parsley half way so it didn't lose its flavor. Serve on some jasmine rice and top with some lime zest. Have fun!

Sooooo delicious!  I probably flavored it more than called for, as I just dusted both sides pretty evenly with all 4 seasonings.  I also gave the chicken a quick brine after flattening, and adjusted my cooking temp and time, following advice from TheKitchn.com on how to make moist, tender chicken breasts every time.  On medium, I cooked the breasts for one minute without moving, then flipped them over.  Then I added my onions & mushrooms, turned it on LOW, put a tight lid on and walked away for 10 minutes and I DIDN'T PEEK (the tutorial says it's a method that requires trust).  When the timer went off, I turned off the heat and walked away for another 10 minutes (again, NO PEEKING).  After that I removed the breasts to a resting plate tented with foil, put the lid back on the pan, and cooked the veggies for another 5 minutes on medium, just to soften and sweeten up the onions a bit.  WOW.  Served with baked potato and steamed broccoli.

I made this recipe without modifications and it was absolutely delicious.  My wife really enjoyed it and let me know it was a keeper.  I served the chicken and sauce over brown rice and accompanied it with sauteed brussels sprouts--a very good meal.

This was SOOOOO GOOD!!  The only thing different I did was to season the chicken a little more liberally.  Otherwise I followed per instructions and it has become an instant favorite of mine and the hubs!  I am making it again tonight and we are both actually giddy in anticipation of the meal!  Thank you!

It had no flavor and bad texture. It was probably operator error. Maybe cook slower in a lower temp.

This was good! Reading it I loved the simplicity of the ingredients. For my tastes it needed more paprika. So I upped it to 1 teaspoon per chicken breast(especially after you pound them out there is more surface area to cover on both sides, you want every bite flavourful) . Also sprinkled each breast with a dusting of flour.. To help thicken the sauce. Added 3 garlic cloves thinly sliced with the onions. 
I cooked mine on low covered on the time suggested. I felt medium on my stove covered would over cook the chicken. Turned out perfectly moist. I can definitely see how a glug of white wine would work wonderfully in here as well... And to serve along side. Served with brown rice and a salad.

Ridiculously simple and very, very tasty. Especially served over pasta. Only changes I made were to be a little more liberal with the spices and adding some white wine to the sauce in the last 5 minutes.

Excellent!!  Made a few changes.  Before putting chicken in, I dredged it with flour.  Then cooked it about 6 minutes on each side and removed the chicken.  I then used a splash of red wine to deglaze the pan, added the mushrooms and onions and cooked about 5 minutes.  I put the chick back in, stirred to coat the chicken, covered, and reduced to low for another 5 minutes.  Then I served it over rice.

Made this tonight it was really good.  We don't really like pounded chicken so I made this with boneless breasts and thighs, it was a huge hit. Definitely going into the rotation.

I made this along with stuffed Italian peppers with a breadcrumb stuffing so I made extra sauce for the chicken and put it over the peppers- it was yummy and easy.

So simple to make! This is a snap to put together. I cut up my chicken breast before cooking them. I served this over egg noodles. I also put out a little bowl of sour cream to top the dish as an option. I had two helpings. One with a bit of sour cream mixed in with the sauce, and one without. Was good either way. Easy, quick, inexpensive and tasty! Thanks for sharing.

This my first review and I took the time to write it, because it is the easiest, time saving, and delicious meal that I have  cooked in a while. It was ready in 30 min and I served it with couscous. I just needed an idea,so I could use some extra mushrooms that I had  and I ended up having a keeper recipe! Thx for sharing it!

This was awesome! A new favorite chicken recipe in my house. What I like is that all the ingredients are always handy in my kitchen, no special trip to the store necessary. I was generous with the spices (didn't measure) but other than that I made it as recipe states and enjoyed it. Thanks!

My husband and I both thought this was pretty delicious!  And really, with the amount of butter, it's not too bad for you.  We both love mushrooms and onions and they really make this a tasty dish!  I prepared it as written.

My husband loved it.  I changed a few things based on the previews review.  I used minced garlic (almost the whole head) and used 1.5 cups of half & half once the mushrooms were reduced.  The half and half was brought to boil for the meal to finish being cooked.

We enjoyed it, but weren't wowed with it.  It's an okay recipe to keep on hand since the ingredients are usually in-house.  It was also fast and easy to make.

It needed more spice (added more paprika) and even added fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder.  I used peanut oil instead of the butter.

Very healthy and easy recipe!  I added 2 cloves of garlic (add 1 if you aren't garlic lovers like us) and a little dried parsley.  It was great!  Be careful not to overcook chicken though.  I'd say 20 minutes is too long to cook the chicken.  Next time I will brown both sides (3 minutes per side) and then add the mushrooms, onion and garlic.

Made this tonight and got rave reviews from the family! Followed the recipe as written, but used minced garlic cloves, fresh herbs, adobo, and olive oil in place of the butter.  I also cut the chicken into pieces instead of cooking whole (to keep the meat moist while cooking down the mushrooms). This was a great low calorie high protein dish! Served with multi-grain pasta and fresh salad. Really loved it! Will post pics next time I make it! Thank you so much for sharing!

Yum!! This dish was delicious!! I of course had to triple the recipe for my big brood.. and we loved it!! I almost made myself sick...because it was so good! I did all the prep work ahead of time.. cooked the chicken in batches, returned all chicken to the pan, topped with mushrooms and onions and served it with rice! This one is definitely a keeper!

Delicious. I sauteed the onions and some sliced shitake mushrooms in 2T of butter until soft then removed to a bowl.  Added another T of butter and continued the recipe as directed.  This gave me nearly caramelized onions on completion and was really delicious.

I may have completely changed the recipe, but I really liked how it came out!  I also dredged the chicken in flour before browning.  I sauteed the onion and garlic then removed it from the pan before browning the chicken.  After browning the chicken, I put the onion, garlic, mushrooms, spinach and a can of diced tomatoes (garlic kind) on top.  I also added about a half a cup of cream.  I served it over penne noodles.

I came across this recipe when I was in a mental melt-down about what to cook for dinner.  I worked in  most of the suggestions added by naples34102 and got raves from the family.  It came together easily and quickly and looked great on the bed of sauteed spinach.  This one definitely goes into the rotation.  There's nothing exotic in it, but it tastes great and is pretty enough to serve for company.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect. I think I could have used less butter but it definitely wouldn't have been as flavorful, perhaps that what some of the users stating the flavor was lacking did wrong. I thought the taste was delicious, and it was great because these are pantry staples for me. I made some steamed brussels sprouts on the side and ended up swishing them around in the leftover sauce on my plate when I was done.  Thanks for an awesome, easy recipe!

The chicken needs more flavor, especially since I did not use butter to brown them as recommended. The spices need to be more than the amounts given. This was a rather easy recipe and the taste was good.  I only added a Tbsp butter to caramelize the onions and the mushrooms separately and it turned out great.  Some Parmesan made quite a tasty addition to replace the creaminess of the butter.

I used mild Hungarian paprika and, like many others, was very liberal with the seasonings.  I also added a scoop of sour cream.  Next time I would use spicy Hungarian paprika.

I thought this needed some sort of marinade. The chicken didn't have a lot of flavor, and the overpowering flavor was onion. Maybe there are some tweeks one could make to improve this, but I probably won't try again.

Wow, This was fantastic. Not figure friendly but worth the extra calories.  I added a splash of sweet vermouth in the last 5 minutes but it would be just as wonderful without it.

Thanks for the redcipe!!!

Very good!  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and then put them in a baking pan with a little chicken stock(to steam the mushrooms) and then baked it.  Topped with cheese of course!!

Tried recipe as written. I thought it was ok. My husband and brother loved it they said it tasted like a restaurant dish. Kids did not like at all, which is to be expected because of the onions. Would make again for husband.

This really hit the spot for me.  I love all ingredientes involved!  I didn't have a meat tenderizer thing so I just spread out the breast as best as I could.  I also cut the butter in half (to 2 tablespoons) and the recipe worked just fine.  Next time I will probably just use a couple tablespoons of Olive Oil.

This was a great Sunday night dinner. Following some other suggestions, I added about a half cup of white wine, some half and half, and a pinch of flour, resulting a creamy, delicious sauce. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I used the kind in the jar since it was what I had on hand. I'm always looking for different chicken recipes and this one is most definitly a keeper!

This chicken was quite bland without the addition of 1/2 cup white wine. I would also add some cream & flour next time to thicken up the sauce. Fresh garlic makes the flavor better. Also, cooking the mushrooms and onions together first, then adding them back in - makes much more sense to me.

I loved this recipe but i did change a few things. I cubed the chicken added more paprika, cooked it set it aside and then cooked to rest of the ingredients with more paprika. I added some cream to the sauce which I think made it what it was. Delicious! We served it over rice.

This recipe was good and easy. I didn't not pound out the chicken (I think it is juicer kept in its normal shape)  I also didn't add the onions. I like them no one else in the family unit does though. I served it with cous cous and it was good.  Oh, and I upped the quantities of the spices.  I didn't see how you could liberally season 4 pieces of the chicken with the quantities stated. Thanks for the recipe.

I took the advice of other cooks, and I added way more spice then the recipe called for (though I usually don't measure out my spices), and I also added a little white wine. It was very good.

Just OK.  Flavour was pretty good, but chicken was very dry (a shame - considering the amount of butter!)
I might revamp this recipe a bit, cooking the chicken for a shorter amount of time, adding more vegetables (zucchini perhaps?), and incorporating into a pasta dish.

Great chicken dish, very easy to make and I found it to be flavorful. Used chicken cutlets since they were on sale, and used seasonings than recipe called for.

Excellent.  I sprinkled the seasonings instead of measuring and didn't use fresh mushrooms.  I didn't have a lot of 'sauce'; not sure why.  I would like to try thickening the pan drippings into a gravy next time...I miss having gravy since I don't fry ham or pork chops or cube steak anymore.

Excellent!!! I didn't pound the chicken breast but took the advice of another and simmered the chicken breast on low. I also added a little bit more butter and and more of the spices to the mushrooms and onions. Served it over long grain and wild rice! YUMMY!

This is so delicious! We eat it served over brown rice.  It is easy, and my whole family loves it.  It is a bit hard to fit the chicken into one skillet (even a large one), so sometimes I add an extra piece or two of chicken and use two skillets. For that, I increase the butter just a little and divide the veggies up between the skillets.

This recipe was okay, taste was very bland.  Very quick and easy to prepare for a night when you are short on time.

I have to agree with others...this is rather bland.  I used a good quality paprika from Penzey's too, and upped the paprika and garlic powder.  I even added a dash of wine and it was still bland.  I probably won't bother making it again.

A tasty dish with a lot of flavor! I was very generous with the paprika and that certainly added a kick. I might add more garlic next time, though. I cut down on the butter (used the whipped stuff)because I'm not a big sauce fan, and the chicken still came out very moist.

I thought this was ok, my husband seemed to like it. I used a lot of paprika hoping it wouldn't be bland and made more of a sauce by adding a cup of chicken broth, some cornstach and some plain yogurt to make more creamy. Ended up mixing in bowtie pasta. Good but probably won't make again - I tend to try new recipes a lot but hardly ever repeat.

Very good! I recommend using hot paprika for a little kick. I also used half the mushrooms (even though I love them) and chicken tenderloins (from Costco). Sprinkle the spices liberally instead of measuring.

This is pretty OK. I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but my husband loved it.  I do wish there was more sauce to put over noodles, but  otherwise tasty.

For ease of preparation and tenderness of the chicken I would give this recipe 5 stars, but unfortunately the lack of flavor detracts from the totality.
