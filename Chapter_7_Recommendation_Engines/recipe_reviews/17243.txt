This was wonderful, my husband and I couldn't get enough of it!!  Though I skipped the alphabet pasta and barley, I instead added potatoes.  Also I used tomato sauce and tomato paste instead of the vegetable juice.. it came out great.  Also added some of my own veggies.  This will definately be a keeper.  Thanks soo much for sharing!!

This soup is incredible, a real keeper.  I used frozen vegetables instead of canned. I didn't have beef broth so only used chicken broth. Will definately make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I am not a big fan of vegetable soup, usually I find it bland.  I was wanting something besides chips to go with sandwiches.  Not only was this soup easy, but it suprisingly tasted great!! Even my kids wanted more!!  Thanks for a FIRST RATE RECIPE!!!  I will definitely make again and probably won't tweak this one a bit.

I served this wonderful soup to 31 guests over the Christmas holidays.  Everyone raved!  Perfect for a cold winter day.  I added some fresh vegetables (carrots, zuchinni) and sauteed them with the celery and onions.  I then added frozen rather than canned vegetables. I am going to try this in the slow cooker next time!  Thanks.

This is perfect!  I added some stew meat and also used frozen veggies since we prefer them. Also used the spicy v-8 juice. We will be making this often in the crockpot   It freezes well also. Thanks!

Great recipe!  I added sliced mini carrots, 1 clove minced garlic.  I also used a little over a cup of Bob's Vegetable Soup mix, a dried soup containing the alpha pasta, barley, and assorted dried beans.  Cook time for Vege II and Bob's were approx the same.  I still added frozen green beans and a can of corn, but had to add extra V-8 to thin to soup texture.  Bob's thickened more than expected.  Altogether an excellent soup.  Next time I'll double recipe and put some in freezer in pint freezer bags for a quick soup for one or more people.

Sensational!  I used the juice and some left over meat from my pot roast for the beef broth.  I skipped the celery since my mixed vegetables had celery.  I broke up little pieces of angel hair pasta instead of the alphabet pasta.  I've never used canned vegetables for soup before.  So simple!

The first time I made this recipe, it tasted like my Grandfather's vegetable soup...which was homey and comforting, but I was looking for a version with a bit less sodium, so I could enjoy it more often. As other reviewers have done, I used all low sodium products when available and used frozen mixed veggies versus canned. I also chopped up a carrot to round out the mirepoix (fancy name for carrots, celery and onions) and deglazed it all with red wine before adding the rest of the ingredients to the mix (giving it a bit more depth). I also added potatoes as well as using the pasta and barley. Thank you Paula for sharing your recipe; it has great flexiblity while maintaining a wonderful finished product!

Yummm... My favorite part about this soup is it's flexability; you can add and take away according to your preferences or what's in the cupboard.  I triple the fresh veggies and omit the frozen/canned ones.  All five of my kids love it (with crackers and a little shredded cheddar) - and that's hard to pull off.  Not to mention that the leftovers are divine, so make sure that you make some for tomorrow's lunch as well!

This is so versatile! I took advice from other reviewers and used the Hot and Spicy V8 juice. I also added garlic, potatoes, and used frozen veggies instead of canned. I didn't measure anything but the broths so my soup came out super chunky, even though I didn't use barley. I went a little crazy buying low sodium ingredients so I made up for it with seasonings like crushed red pepper. That mixed with the spiciness of the V8 will make this even better for cold weather meals.

I've made this 4 times now. This is the best Vegetable Soup ever. I make fresh bread each time I make the Soup. I use 4 cans on chicken stock is my only change to the recipe.

I liked this a lot.  Super simple.  A good way to eat healthy and clean out your pantry.  I played with the recipe as did others, putting in what I liked and had.  Topped it off with fresh grated parm and am eating it as I write this.  Thank you.

I'm giving this soup an average rating because, while it was alright, I've had better vegetable soups. I did substitute frozen vegetables for the canned ones called for.

This soup is great, but I made a few changes.  I omitted the barley and doubled the pasta and used frozen mixed veggies in place of the canned ones.  Everybody loved it.

Wonderful! I substituted potato for the barley and pasta, and added chopped up carrots. For the canned mixed veggies, I added one can of green beans. I also just threw in some chopped fresh basil I had around.  This is a great, basic, if tomato-y vegetable soup.

This is the first time I've made vegetable soup without meat, and it turned out surprisingly well.  I was concerned that this would be bland, but the V-8 juice really kicked up the flavor.  I had a few small red-skinned potatoes, so I threw them in along with about a teaspoon of beef base and a good shake of garlic powder.  I typically like frozen vegetables better than canned, so next time, I'll use frozen mixed vegetables.  And there WILL be a next time...good soup.

This soup is very tasty! The first time I made it, it was a bit salty, so then I opted for low-sodium ingredients when possible and it came out perfect!

We love this soup in our house - I have probably made it 15 times!  I add minced garlic and some Worchestershire Sauce but other than that, I follow the recipe and it is delicious.  I make a pot of it on Sunday and eat it all week for lunch!

This is rather "tomatoey" but still very good.  Needs some work in the spice department though. It was kinda bland, even though I used spicy V-8. I would make it again.

So easy to make, yet it has the "all day simmering" taste.  Healthy and delicious.

Tastes just like canned vegetable soup (which is great since I have a food intolerance to MSG, and really miss it). Some in our party thought it was "bland". But I don't care this gets 5 stars in my opinion!!

This went over very well with my family.  I only had one bowl for myself and it's nearly gone already!  For the beef broth, I used leftover au jus from French Dip Sandwiches available at the allrecipes website.  I'm not a huge vegetable soup fan, but this one is great.

Was skeptical about this soup--sounded way too easy.It is easy and it is good! Entire family liked it which in itself is an amazing thing. Changed nothing and added nothing--good recipe that I will make again

This soup is great! Im vegetarian so I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken/beef, but my non-vegetarian boyfriend couldn't tell the difference!
It tastes even BETTER the next day so left-overs are ideal!

I like to cook the alphabets off in a different pot then add them to the bowl with the soup that way they dont get all spongy and stay al dente.  also a lot of comments say frozen veggies.  In our supermarkets there is a soup mix blend whichalso incliudes diced potatoes which some are saying they include instead of barley  I use the mix and the barley its great!

This is my favorite vegetable soup.  I also add 2 gloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons of old bay seasoning and 1 lb of crab meat.  I didn't have barley this time so I doubled the pasta. These few tweaks make it taste more like Maryland Crab soup.  Today is the perfect day for this soup cause its rainy and gloomy here in PA.

True to everyone else who reviewed this, I made a few changes. I used spicy v-8 (soup was not spicy at all, even with the addition), 3 cups of precooked barley, a little more pasta--not much, a bag of frozen country vegetables, frozen peas, fresh steamed carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower, and a package of frozen spinach. It is much thicker than regular vegetable soup and absolutely wonderful!!

Great recipe.  I added some chopped cabbage and a diced potato to cook with the broth and barley mixture.  I omitted the pasta.  I used one bag of frozen corn and one bag of mixed frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables.  This soup freezes well for later use.

I absolutely love this recipe!!!! I have made this recipe so many times and it always comes out excellent!  I have made it exactly like the recipe except using spicy tomato-vegetable juice cocktail (V8) just for a little more flavor.  I have also made this recipe with frozen vegetables because we had a ton at the time.  No matter what this recipe is one of my favorites!! I can't eat canned soup anymore!!!

I made this two nights ago, a loaded up soup sounded really good.  I chose this recipe based on the outstanding reviews.  I made it per the recipe and everyone ate it up.  My 7 yr old daughter asked for seconds.  I am working through the leftovers and can't get enough.  It is added to my recipe box to make time and time again.  Thank you for a delicious foolproof soup.  I absolutely love it.

This is a great base recipe for veg soup.  I used garlic flavored olive oil to start, with onion, celery & carrot plus more garlic in the starting saute.  Used 2c. each of beef & veg broth I had in fridge; other liquid was 1 15 oz. can crushed tomatoes and 2 cans water.  Broke up dry spaghetti for the pasta.  A 16 oz. bag of frozen mixed veg, oregano, basil, black pepper, salt, .75 t. sugar.  Excellent to pack for work lunches!

Absolutely delicious!!  Of course I had to "kick it up" a bit to make it my own.  I added some fresh garlic and some tender sirloin to make it more hearty.  Next time, I may kick in some thyme and parsley.

Honestly, I wasn't thrilled with this soup.  It was easy to make, but I thought that it tasted too much like a canned vegetable soup when it was done. I figure if it is going to taste like canned soup when I am done, I might as well save myself the trouble and just open the can of soup.  The nutritional value of the canned veg and broth probably did not add much more than the can soup would have anyway.  And it would have worked out to be more expensive than canned soup.  I absolutely didn't like the second day leftovers. Sorry to disappoint. I guess that is the trouble with people rating the soup on the changes they made instead of the actual recipe.

I added 2C water to make it a little more brothy.  I also eliminated the pasta/barley and used 2 1lb bags of frozen mixed vegetables.  Added a bit or basil and oregano, just on a whim.  Tasted great with some delicious crusty bread!

Thanks to this recipe I can now make soup that doesn't taste like veggies in water.  I do use frozen veggies instead of canned, so add a little more beef broth to make up for the liquid.  Also, I pre-cook stew meat until tender and add that at the last.  Feeds a crowd!!

This was the best vegetable soup I've ever tasted! And sooo easy. Was a big hit with family and friends.
