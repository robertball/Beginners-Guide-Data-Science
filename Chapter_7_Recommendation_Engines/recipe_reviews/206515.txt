Very good.  However, squash has so much water in it already, I would never dilute the flavor by boiling.  Simply saute the onions in the butter, add the squash, put a lid on it until its own liquid is released and continue simmering until desired tenderness.

Cooked the onion with the squash.  I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  This is really rich so the second time I made it I halved the butter that's mixed into the topping.  Everybody asks for this recipe.

Good.  First squash casserole recipe I've seen without cheese.  Next time will boil the squash for a shorter period of time and use a lot less butter for the topping.  Baked this in convection oven at 325 for 45 minutes.

I also used seasoned breadcrumbs because that was all I had, and I also did 3 yellow squash and 3 zucchini. I really think this is such a great recipe that even having to make a couple of changes didn't change how great it turned out! Will deffinately be making this again! Now back to the yummy goodness!!!

This was fantastic!  I did tweak it just a tad for our own tastes.  We grew our own squash and used that.  I used plain whole wheat bread crumbs and added about 1 tbs. Italian seasoning to it.  To the chopped onion I also added 4 small cloves of garlic that I pressed through a garlic press.  Then, for the top coating of bread crumbs I substituted crushed up Ritz crackers in place of bread crumbs for a little different, crunchy flavor.  This also makes great leftovers.  Will be making this again!

Great non-cheese casserole! I sliced instead of chunk-ed. I don't ever boil the squash for a casserole. I like for it to still maintain some of its firmness and this cuts out extra steps. That's the only thing that I did differently... Like someone posted earlier, you wouldn't pre-boil potatoes for a potato casserole, so I never understood the step of pre-boiling squash. Also, summer squashes can be and are eaten raw in salads and with dips, so I recommend skipping boiling. The recipe will still turn out perfect!

This is a great recipe!  Instead of dry bread crumbs I used progresso garlic & herb bread crumbs and it gave it a little kick!

A wonderful side dish but a seasoning boost is needed to get it there rather than relying solely on salt and pepper. Personal taste preferences and spiciness of other dishes influence how to season it. Many reviewers used seasoned bread crumbs which is a good idea. Next time, might try a little nutritional yeast for a subtle nutty cheesy flavor. We cut the butter in half and used panko bread crumbs which produced a topping with a crunchy texture. Really liked the firm texture of this dish as some squash casseroles can be watery but not this one. Found the oven temp and baking time to be spot on. Will make again. Melissa, thanks for sharing!

Wow! This is amazing! I wanted to eat it while I was mixing it because it smelled so good...lol. I have made this twice in the last couple of days and it has been great both times. It reminds me of Thanksgiving...yum!

The first time I followed recipe as is = great!

The second time, I only boiled squash about 8 minutes (we thought it was a bit too mushy the first time), made this in a 13x9 glass dish and put extra (homemade) bread crumbs on top, cooked about 35 min = super great & quicker!

This is a keeper for sure!! Thanks for sharing!

I never eat squash but I grew some in my garden so I gave this recipie a shot....WOW am I glad I did.  This was so good I am on my 3rd batch this month.  I did not have any bread crumbs so I browned some baguettes I had and chopped them in the food processer instead and added jalapenos also from the garden mmmmm mmmm good.

Very, VERY good. I made w/ a mix of 'calabaza' squash (like a pale zucchini) and frozen yellow squash. Would be good for a veggie potluck, swapping the butter for seasoned olive oil.  Whole family liked it, even the veg-reluctant among us.

Not bad, but quite bland and boring. I'd rather eat just boiled (or steamed) squash with butter than bother with this recipe. I'll stick with the fabulous Yellow Squash Casserole recipe when I want something along this line.

Delicious, easy, and cheap to make.  Great for a potluck.  Don't peel the squash and use both yellow squash and zucchini for more color variation.  I used 4 squash in the recipe, but probably could use more.  Probably could use less butter.

We enjoyed this last night with some pork loin and steamed asparagus.  Easy to put together and great flavor overall.  I used seasoned bread crumbs.

This was great- I used a white onion I had already chopped that was in the fridge- very mild and I think that was awesome.  I also didn't use additional butter on the topping- baked at 375 for 1/2 hour and then I turned off the oven and left it in there while I got the rest of the dinner ready.  Easy, very delicious and a nice way to use the always abundant summer squash!

Just got to try this recipe after making - friend and I sampled and love it! Cooking for family BBQ and wanted to do something easy with vegetables - especially as have some picky vegetable eaters in the family now. After reading the reviews, decided to mix summer squash and zucchini cubed into bite size pieces then just slightly sautéed in pan (not boiled) with some of the butter called for to soften and release some of the natural water and flavor and added a little extra onion too. Poured every thing into casserole dish and mashed with back of spoon a bit when combining with egg / bread crumb mixture. The sugar was omitted and since have gluten allergy in family, used gluten free bread crumbs (Italian seasoning) but also added a dash of garlic and a little extra black pepper - yummy! Did mix gluten free bread crumbs with melted butter to pour over and did need a bit more to give a 'crust' to the top but was wondering if a slight sprinkling of parmesan on top of the crust would give another dimension to the flavor. Will have to try that and yes, this recipe is a keeper!   Just an addition, made this recipe again yesterday with squash and zucchini from last years garden that I had blanched and frozen. I let the vegetables thaw a bit and made the recipe as before - just as good without having to do any thing further to the squashes! Makes this even easier for me.

I can HONESTLY say what a really good recipe. I made this last week and YUMMY! I would recommend not using as much onions. I used about 1 TBS. I will make this oever and over again. I wonder what this would taste like with Butternut Squash. I have never eat butternut squash but I am really curious what it would taste like in this recipe! Great recipe, thanks for sharing. Its a KEEPER!

I echo what other reviewers have said.  I was skeptical about this recipe, thinking it might be bland.  I tried it anyway b/c my husband doesn't like cheese and I was craving squash casserole.  It was so good!  Some recipes have a wow factor and this, IMO, isn't a wow kinda dish...I mean, it's squash.  The simplicity of taste and ease of making is what earned it 5 stars from me.  Also, I think this would taste great as a main dish, if lump crab meat or oysters where added.

I also chose this recipe because it didn't have cheese or cans of soup in it. Squash is tasty and healthy on its own, and doesn't need to be covered in cheese! That being said, I wasn't super impressed with this. The crumbs, butter, and eggs didn't add a ton of flavour - just a heaviness that I could do without. Next time I'm just going to put the squash, onions, and some pepper in my baking dish and keep it even more simple.

I enjoyed this. I cut the squash into a smaller dice, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 inch, and did not cook it beforehand. I just mixed the diced raw squash with the other filling ingredients, and covered the top with crushed Ritz crackers/melted butter. I covered it with foil for the first half hour, then uncovered it for the final half hour, and the crumb topping was perfectly browned. I will definitely make this again in the future.

This was very good and a nice, different dish for a vegetable side dish.  I added about 1 1/2 cups milk  and another egg to give it a little more of a custard-like consistency.    As we're really trying to lose weight, I didn't top it with the bread crumbs and butter, and it was still delicious.  I also didn't add the melted butter to the mixture.

This is absolutely delicious!  The family couldn't stop eating it.  Followed recipe almost exactly due to what I had available.  The changes I made were using 3 small zucchini and 2 small yellow squash, seasoned breadcrumbs and for the topping 1 tablespoon of butter instead of 1/4 cup.  Everything else was the same.  Will make again.  Thank you for sharing!

Really, really good.  It didn't get five stars because the texture was odd.  A little thicker than I wanted, and pasty looking.  The flavor was awesome. though.  I will definitely make again, only next time use flour instead of bread crumbs in it.  Also, for the topping, I mixed the bread crumbs with melted butter, and it required way more crumbs than 1/4 cup to make it crispy and crumbly.

Wow!  Loved this!  I used Italian bread crumbs, but followed exactly other than that.  Even my VERY picky soldier gobbled this up.

Nice homey flavor and a good way to sneak veggies and protein into my kids.  I boiled the squash for about 12 minutes and they were quite mushy, next time I will reduce boil time.  I also added the onion in with the squash for the last 5 minutes of boil to tenderize and mellow the onion flavor for my picky eater.  I substituted 1/2 sleeve of crushed ritz mixed with butter in place of the extra breadcrumb. This would make a nice Thanksgiving dish.

I altered the recipe by adding zuccini and grated carrots OH and Cheese and crackers instead of bread crumbs. So I can't really rate this recipe though I used all the measurements and other ingredients as called for. I love it! Very good! Will make again for sure. ONly next time I will follow this recipe exactly!

Halved this one for just the two of us and it was FANTASTIC!  As suggested by others I cut down on the butter on top.  I used fresh candy apple sweet onions and fresh yellow squash from one of our local farmer's markets.  Not having time, room, or energy for a garden I find the farmer's markets a huge plus to our meals.  Only thing I may do different next time is skip the sugar.  I just didn't see the use.  (Maybe it's because the onions we use are sweet enough.)

Delicious! I steamed the squash in a steamer basket (less water to drain), added butter all at once with the bread crumb mixture instead of drizzling on top; used panko breadcrumbs; cooked in microwave for about 10 minutes, then put in oven for about 20 to finish it off since I was in a hurry.

We LOVED this. The egg and bread crumb mixture really makes this dish stand out. I added shredded mexican blend cheese on top with the bread crumbs. I covered the dish with foil and cooked 25 minutes at 400 degrees, then uncovered it for about 7 minutes. My picky boyfriend told me I can make this whenever I want. Thanks so much!!

I made this tonight and it was wonderful.  I followed other reviewers comments and cut down on the butter.  I used the 1/4 cup in squash but only drizzled small amount on top.  I also added some parmisan cheese to top.  Had no regular bread crumbs so used Panko instead.  Also added about 1/2 tsp ground sage.  Could use more salt, but I may have had a little more than 3 pounds squash.  We loved it.  Thanks for the recipe I saved this one!

4 stars and very tasty as written.  It is quite rich and  doesn't need all the butter called for.  I agree with other reviewers that the squash should be 'sweated' with a little of the butter and the onion and not boiled.  
It is also a very forgiving recipe.  I have used a mixture of zucchini and yellow squash.  You could also add add cubes of ham to make this a main dish, or bacon bits to make it a little fancier for a company meal.

This recipe is identical to one I have from the old Dixie House restaurant in Dallas, which I've been making for nearly 30 years. When I make this recipe, I cut the squash into bite-sized pieces, so it isn't overly chunky. I like it best with plain bread crumbs in the squash, and no butter or crumbs on top; though sometimes, for a change of pace, I'll put some grated Cheddar or Colby cheese on top.

I love this recipe, I also didn't remain consistent with original recipe but very close.  Microwaving squash for 2 min intervals with onion, garlic powder (lazy day) salt and pepper till soft, added marg this time then fresh processed bread crumbs.  Mixed in egg, topped with more crumbs and butter.

Made this dish for the first time today and took it to lunch with my family, and everyone loved it! There were no leftovers. Very simple and easy to make. I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and was generous with them on top. I did not cut back on the butter and it still turned out delicious!

This was really good. I used garlic herb breadcrumbs, half the butter and no sugar. Also, I sauteed the onions first as my family doesn't like crunchy onions and wanted to make sure they were soft.

My husband absolutely LOVED this recipe. I have a "family recipe book" that I generally only write exceptional recipes in to refer back to for future meals. After hubby cleared his mouth of spoonfulls of this delish, he said, "Omg you HAVE to write this one in THE BOOK now!" The only thing that I done differently that the recipe doesn't call for is: I used red onion and Italian bread crumbs (since that's all I had on hand). One one....SCRUMPTIOUS!

I used panko crumbs and zucchini (I ran out of squash in my garden and had a lot of zucchini).  I also boiled the squash/zucchini with some crushed garlic for flavor and mixed the top panko crumbs with some Parmesan.

The result was a very light and yummy dish.  Very nice for a summer dinner.

This is a great recipe!  I did not have an onion, so I pressed two garlic wedges and hoped for the best.  It was great!  Also- did not have breadcrumbs so I had to use crushed triscuits (for the topping) and Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix (herb?) from a bag that I crushed up.  YUMMO!!!

This was absolutely delicious!  My husband and I both gave it 5 stars.  I did use cracker crumbs because that is what I had available, but otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I liked it because you can taste the summer freshness of the squash.  It isn't masked by cheese, sour cream, soup, etc.  I will definitely make this again!  YUM!

This is the easiest and the best tasting squash recipe I have ever made.  I made it for a potluck at church and everyone is asking for the recipe now!  It doesn't look that good but it taste tremendous!

Unbelievably tasty.  I made it without any tweaks- except I seeded the squash first.

This may be the best squash recipe I've ever tried.  Very, very good.  I liked the fact that it doesn't have cheese in it too.  Definitely a keeper!
I've made this a couple of times, once using ritz crackers and once using bread crumbs.  Definately better witht e buttery cracker flavor.

Great Recipe! I used panko bread crumbs since that's all I had. Also, I doubled the amount . I just felt it wasn't enough for  so much squash. It was delicious and crunchy! I did cut the sugar since panko has it in it already. I will be making it again, for sure!

I am giving it a 5 per my boyfriend. I personally do not eat squash but he adored this recipe. The only thing he changed was to put rings of pepperoncini on the top before baking.

I used this recipe as a primer based on the reviews and added to it more veggies and chickpeas to make it a meal and it was stupid delicious. 

Sautéed onion, celery, carrot, garlic in part butter, part olive oil. Added in the summer squash and some zucchini that I had left over and sautéed that a few minutes too, seasoning all of it well with salt and pepper. Sprinkled on some all purpose vegetable seasoning, added 1/2 tsp of vegetable stock concentrate and 1/3 cup water plus a little more butter  and covered to steam for about 5 minutes. Threw it all in a bowl and mashed until it still was about 1/2 chunks. Added in the egg and bread rubs with the addition of Bragg’s Nutritional yeast seasoning 1:3 parts. Put it all in the baking dish and put a can of ringed and drained chickpeas on top and then covered with the bread crumbs plus more nutritional yeast. Sprinkled olive oil on top instead of butter and baked as directed.

I cut the squash and onions in rings and sautéed them until just fork tender and I did not mash them up .  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  DELICOUS!  Next time I will make it with yellow & zucchini squash.

Because some said it was too watery, I drained it a second time after mashing.  I omitted the sugar as I don't need more sugar in my diet.  To get my spouse and kids to try it I added somed cooked bacon.  Wonderful!

I wish I'd trusted my instinct to not add sugar, but I hate it when people don't follow a recipe exactly and then complain.  Anyway, in my opinion, there's no place for sugar in a recipe like this.  I didn't even add a full tablespoon, and it was still too sweet.  My kids thought it tasted like creamed corn (which they don't like).  I'm actually pretty bummed out that all my fresh garden squash went into this recipe, and now no one will eat it.  I'd make it again, but I would definitely omit the sugar entirely.

I used plain panko bread crumbs for the topping and seasoned bread crumbs for the middle.  I did not boil the squash, instead stir fried it with the onion and it wasn't limp.   Good, yummy stuff here.

Really yummy. Barely boiled the squash and put a raw zucchini to add color! Added Parmesan cheese on top and grilled chicken after. I don't care about presentation so it looked interesting after being mixed up!

Delicious! And finally a squash dish without cheese. I also halved the topping butter and next time I think I'll add in some fresh corn cut off the cob (after cooking the cobs with the squash).

I cubed my squash and put it in a corning-ware dish with a few tablespoons of water, covered and cooked in microwave for eight minutes.  I opted not to mash the squash.  Make sure you really grease your baking dish!!  My husband, who's not a fan of any squash, declared this the best squash recipe I've ever made!  I will make this again and again.  A great way to use abundant summer squash and something different than the usual sautéed squash with onions.

I used corn bread stuffing mix and only I egg.  I also used the squash broth to moisten the mixture.  Personally, I'm not one to measure much (been cooking for a long time) so I  just know when it looks right.  The flavoring from the stuffing mix really made a good side dish.  I served this with baked pork chops and freshly snapped green beans cooked with bacon.  Yum!

Turned out good, but my pan is slightly oversized and resulted in a really thin casserole.  I may try a 9 x 9 next time.

Good but needs additional flavor and not so much butter. Think ritz crackers would be better than bread crumbs. I will be experimenting with this.

Delicious! I usually make my squash casserole with a cheese (like asiago), but decided to try this one instead.  I was not disappointed - will make again. I just realized on re-reading this recipe that I did not add the 1/2 cup breadcrumbs to the squash - I only sprinkled italian breadcrumbs and butter over the top.  I didn't miss the other  breadcrumbs.

My boyfriend has always talked about baked squash so I decided to make it for him using this recipe.  He (and I) really liked it!  I would make this again.

I'm only giving it a low rating because of the bread crumbs. It would have been much better with buttery crackers.

This was delicious.Lower in claories than most because of no cheese. Could even be lower if you used EggBeater. I used panko bread crumbs, could have added fresh basil, I did not add sugar, not sure why you would, I agree with others, could use less butter, but it is very tasty with the amt used. I'll be making this again

Delicious! Easy to make. Tastes like Boston Market squash casserole! Will make this for Thanksgiving! I make with zucchini or yellow squash, or combo of both... I am actually going to try this with eggplant next time! Our new favorite side dish!

I followed recommendations of several others by sauteing the onion with added 1/4 c. diced bell pepper and squash.  I beat eggs in a mixing bowl and then added seasonings and 1/4 c.  cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs for crunchier texture, mixing well.  I added vegetable mixture to the mixing bowl and stirred well before pouring into greased baking dish.  I topped with 1/2 c. shredded cheddar and monterrey jack cheese and then an additional 1/2 c. cracker crumbs.  Finally I drizzled 1/4 c. melted butter over cracker crumbs and baked the dish at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes.  It was a big hit with my family and I'll be making it again.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

I made this, using panko instead of bread crumbs (because I didn't have any bread crumbs), and it came out great. The only thing I'd recommend, if it isn't self-evident, is that you should drain the squash before mixing it with everything.

I only changed one thing.

I added closer to a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs before baking it.

I made this tonight with our first-ever homegrown yellow squash and I'm so glad I picked this one! I followed your recipe with one change and one addition: I sauteed the squash and onion and added a jalapeno. Thank you so much for the simplest but yummy (as you said all-forgiving) yellow squash casserole. It adds the flavor needed but the squash is still the star!

I cut the recipe down by half and omitted some of the butter and all of the sugar. I decided to sauté  the squash and onion in butter vs boiling agreeing with reviewers that it would be dryer. Continuing with the smashing with a potato masher....I only had spicy bread crumbs. Maybe I'm not a huge fan of the orangish blob, it tasted okay but not too pretty. It was just okay for a change.

Made this for a side dish. It turned out to be a big hit at our 4th of July party.   I added flavored breast crumbs and parmesan cheese to the top.  I was asked for the recipe.  It went very well with the smoked pork tenderloins and smoked beans.

Sauteed (with lid on) squash with 2 onions instead of boiling.  
Added about 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan to bread crumbs for top.  
Seasoned with garlic pepper.  
Yum!

I was kind of disappointed in this. It didn't have as much flavor as I expected to. I'm a new cook by all means and was just trying to go exactly by the recipe and I was hoping for something a little different.

Oh my gosh, so good!!  Don't boil the squash! Steam, drain. Smash, drain.  Boiling ANY veggie by submerging it in water leaks out all the beneficial nutrients.  I also added minced garlic to the egg mixture, just to give it a more complex flavor.  
Instead of dumping a quarter cup of butter on top, I used a spoon to drizzle it across the top, which allowed me to use far less than the 1/4 cup prescribed.  
I turned out delicious!

I made this dish and split the goods with my daughter and mom.  It is delicious and I'm not a squash fan   My daughter said it tastes even better the next day. At the time I'm writing review, my mom hadn't tasted it yet.  The only problem was I only had 3 yellow squashes to use(1 pound). So I cut all ingredients in half but still kept dish in the oven  for an hour.  Also I used the prepackaged finely cut seasoned Italian bread crumbs.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (which is unusual for me..LOL).  The only thing I did differently was add parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs on the top.  Squash is watery, so I would suggest after mashing slightly to put them in the colander again and let them sit for a few minutes.  I made this for Easter dinner.  My family are my favorite guinea pigs!  They all loved it!

Super easy and delicious!  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used crushed Ritz crackers instead.  The man said it's a keeper :)

I made this as written except that I did use Italian bread crumbs for additional flavor. It was a hit with my family for sure! I will make it again but will add some sharp cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon on top, a personal preference but is what I am used to that I missed on this one. (I guess that would be a different casserole then LOL.)

I substituted maybe 2 tablespoon of margarine split for the butter.  Also I used some honey instead of the white sugar.  Came out great although I think I overcooked it a little.

I cut this down to 1/3 of the recipe since I was cooking for one.  I added a bit of diced green pepper, and instead of bread crumbs on top, I sprinkled on some parmesan cheese.  I microwaved on high for 4 minutes.  It turned out great!

We made this exactly as the recipe is written and liked it a lot.  It is a little on the bland side, so I may try seasoned bread crumbs next time, or try adding some cheese to the top.  This is definitely a recipe that could be tweaked a lot of different ways and still be tasty.

To make this gluten free I used corn meal in place of the bread crumbs.  I only used them mixed in before baking, not sprinkled on top.

Everybody in the family loved this, which is a surprise for us! I was worried that this recipe would take longer because it asks to boil the squash after cutting it but it’s very quick. Definitely will make this again!

This is incredibly easy and delicious!  I just ate leftovers cold and they were amazing.  Definitely remind me of bread stuffing and I can't even explain why. I did cut the recipe in half, didn't peel a very large homegrown yellow squash and used panko bread crumbs.

No sugar needed.  I’d set the boiled squash aside and drain off the liquids well before putting in to the mixture.

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half, use crushed pork rinds for the flour and Pyure for the sugar to cut back on carbs. It was delicious and I will be making it a lot!! It was perfect with my Pork tenderloin.  Yummy!

So my mom brought us about 6 lbs of yellow squash and I had never cooked It before in my life! I looked up yellow squash recipes and saw that this used 3 lbs, perfect! That’s half my batch so I Followed this recipe but substituted bread for unsalted crackers and added a sprinkle of fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Omg! Loved It! Thanks mom!

Really enjoyed!  The second time I made it, I put some chicken tenders(unbreaded) in.  They had been frozen so I defrosted and even semi cooked in microwave.  Used Ritz crumbs and even added a 1/3 cup of low fat Cheddar cheese on my half batch (before adding butter & crumbs). Excellent comfort food meal.  Tasted more decadent than it was!

This dish was surprisingly good. I added more  onions, pepper, and sourdough breadcrumbs which made the casserole absolutely tasty. I would give it a ten if i could!!

Made according to the recipe. I want to go Gordon Ramsey on it but I have better manners than that. Not my idea of tasty but I’m sure others will disagree.

Took other commenters advice and just cooks the squash with onions, garlic, and seasonings to taste. Cooked covered then cooked off the liquid. Mixed with eggs, adds cheese, as well as using a favorite crushed, baked chip instead of traditional crumbs. Came out great! Also made a zoodle version which was equally great.

Read the reviews.  
I sautéd the onion, added the squash, both  summer and zucchini, seasoned to taste.
Cooked until the squash was tender.
In a bowl, I added Panko bread crumbs, the eggs, and a bit of cayenne pepper.  I dumped in the squash, once it was tender, added a bit of butter, I DID NOT mash it up, I mixed it together and dumped it into a baking dish and topped with bread crumbs, no butter.   Baked at 375 for an hour.
I didn't boil the squash at all.  I sautéd it with the onions once the onions were tender.

I followed recommendation of another reviewer to sauté onion & squash instead of boiling the squash. This added more taste.

I loved this! I accidentally added way too much sugar(1/2 cup), so it was more like eating candy, but it was still delicious. My only recommendation would be to add the bread crumbs to the mixture and not top the dish with them. Very yummy! We used fresh squash from the garden.

I made this recipe as directed and it was delicious.  I was afraid my Italian boyfriend would not like it, as it didn't have any tomatoes or garlic in it, but he loved it so much he ate a good third of it in one sitting.

This dish was absolutely delicious. But I did make a few changes. I cooked the onions with the squash. I added cheddar cheese with mixture. And I topped it off with Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I love it. Thank you!

Very happy with it. Used "Italian flavored" Bread Crumbs (because that is what I had on hand &) the extra herbs gave it a nice savory flavor.  The butter made it rich (in nice way).
Tip - grease bottom of pan (I didn't & it stuck).
LOL - even the scraped off parts were VERY tasty.
Thanks for posting/sharing it.

I used this recipe as a starting place but did alter it quite a bit in order to make it just a little bit healthier. I sautéed the onion first, adding one finely minced clove of garlic. Then I added the squash and sautéed until the cubes of squash were firm-tender.  In a large bowl, combined the squash mixture with 1/4 c crumbled Ritz crackers, 1/8 c melted butter, the two eggs, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper (we like pepper). Drizzled top with 1/8 c melted butter and 1/4 c crumbled Ritz crackers. Then I baked as directed. It was a home run! Next time I will first grease the casserole dish a bit.

Ok, I had an abundance of ball squash and needed to do something with it, so I used it in this recipe.  For half the recipe I made  as it was it written except I fried the onion .  The other half I added another egg and 1 teaspoon of a spice blend containing paprika, roasted garlic, and oregano. I also added two slices of cooked bacon crumbed.  Both turned out great, but I liked the one with all the add ins best.  I will be using this recipe a lot...even thinking about planting more squash!

Third time to make. First time I followed the recipe exactly except I used a little red pepper. Third time I unleashed the creative side. Added jalapeño, a bit of bacon, and a few other things. It is a hit no matter what you do to it. It's a very good starting point type of recipe that each family can work on to create an heirloom dish.

Easy to fix , the taste was out of this world. I did add garlic and used a whole onion. I didn't add any cheese as we love cheese but cheese doesn't love us, also I didn't add any sugar. It really came out great. Thanks for the yummy recipe

I  had some summer squash I needed to use and, with barbeque night approaching, this recipe for the bill. I prepared it as directed. I found it to be quite tasty. It's a very simple dish with good flavor and texture that reminds me of grandma's southern cooking. I'm glad to have this recipe for future use.

So I tried this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a decent meal but not really memorable. The second time I jazzed it up a bit. I ground up some Ritz and club crackers instead of using bread crumbs. I also put an extra 1/4 cup of crumbs in the mixture to help thicken it and make it less soupy.  I used a tablespoon of chili powder instead of black pepper and I used garlic salt. The end result was a fluffy, flavorful casserole that my husband and I both really enjoyed. I will be adding this modified recipe to my list or regulars.

I brought this to a family gathering and everyone loved it!   I chopped the squash in thick slices rather than cubing it, seemed easier.   Next time I will mix 1-2 Tablespoons of melted butter with the bread crumbs for the topping...1/4 cup butter was a little greasy.

This turned out really well, however, I made several changes/substitutions.  I used cornmeal instead of bread crumbs, and added a good bit of frozen, chopped spinach. I omitted the sugar entirely, and I seasoned with some cayenne pepper. I garnished the top with hot paprika & lightly drizzled honey. The squash was SO watery after boiling and mashing (even after draining twice), plus I added the spinach, making it more liquid, I got worried it would turn out too soupy. I diced up a small potato and mixed it in. It came out perfect! Very savory & a tad spicy and not soupy whatsoever. I would definitely make this again. The cornmeal and spice gave it that extra southern kick and you don't even notice the potato.

Very good recipe, but I like other reviews sauteed the squash with the onions rather than boiling it and seasoned bread crumbs. Also, I added 2 cups of leftover grilled chicken to make it a main dish meal. Sprinkle some shredded cheese of choice when it comes out of the oven!

Changed a few things. The techniques on this seemed like they needed tweaking to me. I added bacon and cooked the bacon and onion together in a skillet and added sliced squash when they were about half done. Only cooked until squash was barely done. I probably used more like 4 cups squash and 1 cup onion. I used fontina cheese and addded about .5 cup half&half to egg. I left out the sugar. (ugh!) I used 1.5 sticks of Ritz instead of bread crumbs and used half in the filling, half on top. I tossed the squash/bacon/onion mixture with the crushed ritz, then shredded cheese and poured in a casserole. Poured egg/cream mixture over this and mixed together. Topped with another sprinkle of cheese, but then did traditional ritz/melted butter topping on top of that so it would brown up correctly. It was excellent!

Seriously, can I give this recipe more than 5 stars! I could hug whoever created this recipe. I have 2 yellow crookneck squash plants and a house full of picky eaters. I grew up loving squash in the summer, but was hesitant that my 3 kids would like it. They ate the ENTIRE thing. I went back for seconds and it was GONE. Nuff said.

Very Good! Some recipes I've seen also add a packet of yeast to imitate the bread roll aroma, and also produce a more bread casserole height in this recipe for rising.  It is a favorite and is very similar to what used to be served at The Black-Eyed Pea restaurants in Dallas, Tx before they closed the chain.

This is my new "go to" squash recipe.  I used to think cheese and bacon made squash better.  I was wrong!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

My picky, 72 year old mom loved this. ..I made it, with a small change in recipe. ..I didn't have the bread crumbs, but I had some instant stuffing mix, so I pulsed it in my processor for a second and used that instead.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Excellent recipe!  I made a few modifications.  I put the onions in the saucepan with the squash.  I also used 1 C. of cheddar-jack cheese in place of the 1/2 C. of breadcrumbs.  I then used 1/3 C. of bread crumbs on the top instead of 1/4 cup.  Mmmm!

As others said, this is a great basic recipe you can doctor to your tastes.  I cut the recipe in half, then sauted the onion in 1/2 the butter.  Per other reviewers, I added Italian herb seasoning to the whole wheat breadcrumbs mixed with the squash, boiled a llittle less time.  Then made an oops that turned out, without thinking added in 3 TBSP of green chiles I had to use up.  Topped with the remaining butter and breadcrumbs (almost too much butter as others stated) and grated fresh Parmesan on top.  The Parmesan plus breadcrumbs made a crunchy topping, and the chiles added heat without affecting the flavor of the herbs.  Really, really good.  I intended it to be my side for the next 3 nights, and will have trouble not eating the whole thing.

!!FANTASTIC!!  Only changes I made:  Substituted frozen  yellow squash in place of fresh, Publix's Fourcheese Mexican blend fancy shredded cheese (both mixed in & sprinkled on top), Progresso's Panko Crispy Italian Style bread crumbs, 1 Cup of onions, 6+ Tablespoons sugar, butter on top.  The family couldn't and I do mean "COULD NOT" get enough!!!  Thought they were going to lick the casserole dish. Yum! Yum!

I have made this several times. I left out the Parmesan cheese since I'm allergic to milk and it was great. I've made it with just  yellow squash and I've made it with zucchini too. Both were good.

I made this tonight for the first time and love it! I did make two alterations. I used half yellow squash and half zucchini. I also substituted Italian seasoned Panko for the plain bread crumbs. Delicious! I paired it with pork chops.

So yummy!  Even squash haters like this. I usually add some fresh carrots sliced into 1/4 inch pieces when boiling the squash. Normally I wouldn't boil summer squash, but for this dish it actually improves the texture of the finished dish. A little fresh thyme leaves or fresh chopped basil are nice additions.

This is a great way to mix up how to serve yellow squash. This would probably even be appealing to people who think they don't like squash. I love the crispy top layer! (When preparing it, I wasn't sure how all that topping stuff was going to turn out...it turned out golden-brown and delicious.)

Good way to use up the squash from your garden. . . . As others have mentioned, the recipe is very bland as written, so adding salt and seasoning to suit your particular taste is highly recommended. Other than that, this is a good recipe. . . . I made this for my husband (who is the cook in the house and does NOT like zucchini), and he really liked this dish. (Go figure!) . . . I made the recipe as directed only adding the necessary salt and seasoning to taste as well as a few pressed garlic cloves since we love garlic. Cook time and oven temp worked well. I used both yellow and green zucchini from the garden (about 4 total) and used seasoned bread crumbs since that's all we had on hand.  . . . I will definitely make this again and, as others have suggested, perhaps I'll try using some type of buttery cracker on top instead of bread crumbs.

I added a little (3 slices) of premade (real) bacon crumbles to the top for a little extra flavor and crunchiness.  Very good and will make again.  Goes good with slow cooker pork butt.

I love steamed/sauteed squash, so as this is so rich, I will propably only make it as a treat.  So good though! Added in some spices (garlic, thyme), used Splenda, and reduced the butter.

I added sauteed garlic, used Italian style Panko and seasoned the squash with Italian seasoning. This added a lot of flavor to an otherwise rather bland recipe. It was a hit at a family gathering!  will make this again.

I really like this, and so did most of my family :) I agree with an earlier review that it's nice to find a bake/casserole without cheese, seeing as we have an allergy in our family. Thanks for a simple and yummy recipe!
