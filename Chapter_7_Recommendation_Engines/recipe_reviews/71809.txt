I almost didn't look twice at this recipe after reading a one-star review. But then I realized that the chicken stock in my pantry is made only from FORWARD-SCRATCHING CHICKENS. Now I can make this recipe without causing regret!

Seeing "lucky" in the recipe's name attracted me.  I made this stew on New Year's Day and it was a hit!  I used the bones from a honey baked ham and upped the Cajun seasonings...the sweet and spicy flavors worked beautifully together. I served it with brown rice, to keep a resolution.  Very good! Thank you for a lovely recipe!

I'm not a huge fan of the taste of ham hocks. Although I did use them in the recipe. I did not cut them up and put in the stew, I added cubed ham chunks instead. I love spicy food, but thought the 1teas of cayenne this recipe called for was a bit much and over powered the other flavors. I added fresh garlic as well. Hope this helps.

This was great!  Made it Jan 1st along with Black Eyed Pea Gumbo (which was very bland) and this was really good.  I used regular cabbage instead of Napa which was great and I am not a big cabbage eater.  Used cubed ham and didn't have Cajun seasoning so I added some chili powder, onion and garlic powder, cayenne, salt, pepper, basil and oregano instead.  I didn't serve over rice but that would be good!  We loved the flavor.  Oh...and I left out the Water Chestnuts.  Didn't have them, but didn't think they would have gone well in this dish anyway.

I made this stew according to the recipe. The only change I made was using canned black-eyed peas, rather than frozen ones.

I thought this was very good and the whole family approved. I added more Cajun seasoning~ for extra kick and used bacon instead of ham hocks.

What happened to the Water Chestnuts that were listed in the ingredients but not mentioned in the instructions??  Did anyone add them? I haven't made this yet but guess I will leave them out...

I'm giving it a 5 because it was so easy and everyone in my home loved it. What a simple way to incorporate all New Years food. I don't even like cabbage but this was delcious..I barely tasted it. I used 1 lb. boneless ham steak (cubed)and canned beans. I recommend doubling the ham..I did the second time and enjoyed this recipe so much more. Here in Texas we LOVE spicy food...you can kick it up a notch if you'd like to with a little extra cayenne. Husband loves this recipe...great MAN food and heats up very well. Thank you for sharing.

Zesty!  Made this on New Years Day for luck (so far so good). 
I used regular cabbage because my store didn't have Napa, I eliminated the water chestnuts because they weren't in the directions, I used ham steak as other recommended and cut it up (don't know if they used the ham hocks also, but I didn't!), used canned black-eyed peas, and served it with Quinoa!
I only made the changes because it's what I had and it was still great.  I will definitely make it throughout the year as well as on New Years.

We really enjoyed this. I made it in the crockpot so we could leave for the day. Sauteed onions first obviously. We used chorizo instead of ham and used more cabbage. Forgot to make rice and liked it soupy. Did serve with quinoa second time around. Was also able to freeze what was left.

This is a keeper for me. It was nice to have a stew recipe for a cold New Year's Day. I added 2 packages of Carving Board ham along with the ham hocks and it was enough meat. There isn't enough meat with only the ham hocks. I also added 2 more cups of chicken stock.  This is excellent.

Well, this rating is a compromise between my husband and I.  He gives the recipe 4.5 stars and I would give it a 2.5 at best.  For me, this is just so boring.  Made exactly as written for the second year in a row and it's still a snoozer.  Very bland.  On a positive note, it tastes very healthy and light.

As for the water chesnuts, I haven't added them in years and haven't missed them either. The ham I always add in extra ham. 
Can't have a New Years day without this lucky bringing dish. This is my favorite recipe for ringing it in. Do not let that cabbage scare you or your picky eater. Napa cabbage is extremely mild and if you shred it small enough, no one would ever know it was there. I prefer noticeable but if you have a picky eater, by all means hide the cabbage but don't leave it out! Everyone enjoys this dish, from my "no green in my food" teen, to my vegetarian adult daughter (she gets a ham free version cooked in a small pot to the side.) ENJOY!

Love this stew! I made it last New Year's day with rave reviews and plan on having it again this year. 

A couple of tweeks: I used pre-cooked and cut ham cubes instead of the hock. and I used Bok Choy instead of Napa. Still tasted great!

Good stuff! Add some extra ham as the ham hocks are mostly for flavoring and not much meat. With the kids eating it I know it will bring us luck!

Lucky New Years Black Eyed Pea Stew Haiku: "Made this four years now. Why have I not reviewed it?? So very yummy!" Can't believe that I've neither reviewed this recipe, nor made it any other time of the year, other than on New Year's Day because we LOVE it. I'd give it 4.5 stars as written (which I have prepared and eaten), and 5 stars (and more) w/ some little changes. Green cabbage instead of Napa, 3-4 slices chopped bacon (saute the onion and garlic in a little of the bacon grease), no water chestnuts, canned black eyed peas. We serve ours either over basmati or mashed potatoes, but always w/ a few splashes of chipotle tabasco sauce.

3 stars as written.  Needs more depth of flavor- add carrots and celery with onions, add additional ham. 1/2 the rice or will be too thick.  Will make again with these changes (we need all the new year good luck we can get :-)

This was a pretty good combined dish.  It was hearty and comforting, but I didn't particularly like the cabbage in with the peas, it lost all of it's flavor.  I would make this again on a cold winter day though.

I made about 3 cups of rice and a pound of black eyed peas in the pressure cooker before hand and then put all of the ingredients with the cabbage back in the cooker for about 5-6 minutes under pressure...quick release.  Everything was delicious.  Spice and salt it like you like it.  Makes a lot this way.  I'll have plenty for the week and hopefully lots of luck!

Not impressed, not much to it. It was bland other than the heat. Paula Dean has a great recipe with white northern beans, perhaps I'll substitute those for the black eyed peas and add half collard greens half cabbage, just for the lucky bit.

I made this dish to use up green cabbage and ham hocks left over from other recipes. It's good, but not amazing, and I doubt I'd make it again unless I had more leftover ingredients I didn't want to go to waste. This is a bean and cabbage stew... not sure what I was expecting.

Delicious! Yes I will make it again, soon! I used black-eyed peas no green. It is called stew so the pic shows green peas in it but I made it exactly with the ingredients listed.

Perfect! I had just bought a pound of smoked Basmati rice; it was so good with this stew. I used three cloves of garlic instead of two, and green cabbage instead of napa (what was in my fridge). Loved it! Sometimes, black-eyed peas can be a little trying. . .not this recipe.

This recipe was a hit with my group. I added a lot more cabbage and peas and less moisture to make it more stew like. I also used butter to saute my onions and a little bit of sherry to deglaze with which really kicked up the flavor. I also suggest using smoked hammocks if you can get them as this adds more flavor as well.

I made this recipe for my husband who loves black eyed peas.  I was skeptical.  I did also soak my peas overnight, and this is where I changed the recipe.  I found that my peas were too soft so I added two cans of black eyed peas to thicken the stew.  It became perfect.  I also served it over a basmati vegetable mix from Trader Joe's.  it has veggies and both basmati rice and wild rice.  It was just so good, and I am not a huge fane of black eyed peas, but this recipe is a keeper and one I will make often.  Just very yummy in my tummy.  My family gave it a 5 thumbs up.  (5 of us)definitely will make this again.

I fixed this dish on New Year's day for my girlfriend and myself.  She could not stop raving about how good it was. (Brownie points for me)  My family tradition was to have black eyed peas (for luck) and cabbage (for money) for the coming year on new years day.  This recipe accomplished both.  I too was confused about the water chestnuts, so I chopped them up and used them as garnish.  Added a nice texture.  Served with cheddar biscuits, excellent addition.  I will definitely not wait until next new years day to make this again.

This was tasty but I think I'll add cubed ham next time instead of the ham hocks.

Great recipe and so flexible.  I used ham hocks and added additional ham.  I also used 2 cans of black-eye peas and regular cabbage.  My husband who would grudgingly eat one black-eyed pea on New Years, had many more today in this stew and pronounced it "pretty good".  Now, that's an accolade!

I always have Blackeye Peas and greens on New Years Day. I saw this recipe the last week of the year and loved the idea of having the peas and the greens together in a stew. This is the first time I have ever cooked with Nappa cabbage. It is so good, we have had it several times since and it's only Feb. I use diced ham instead off the Ham hock and have cooked it with and without the water chestnuts- it's great both ways. Yum yum....

Amazing!  I substituted the ham hock with smoke turkey and it was delicious!  This will be a staple in my house.

This was great! I only made a couple changes, two cans of black eyed peas and half a head of cabbage. I also sautéed some extra cabbage and onion to add to the stew for extra crunch. Very easily doubled to leave leftovers. Made with rice the first day and the second day it was so hearty, the rice wasn't needed. Will definitely make again!

I made this for New Years and everyone loved it. I used the ham bone from our Christmas ham which still had a lot of meat on it. I didn't have any Cajun seasoning so used about 2 tsp. of Frank's Red Hot sauce which gave it a great flavor. I also added a bit of bacon grease to sauté the onion and cabbage and give it that bacon smoky flavor. Instead of rice I used some wide egg noodles added at the end of the cooking time and I served the stew with cornbread. I'm not giving 5 stars for my changes but because this is a great recipe that you can add to or take away whatever you like. This recipe is so much easier and more convenient than cooking everything separately. Such a delicious recipe that's a great start to the New Year! Thank you so much for sharing!
