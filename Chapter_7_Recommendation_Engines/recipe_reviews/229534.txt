This was my first time cooking using a leek and I will say I was pleasantly surprised.  One thing I would change is using a season with less salt as this recipe only says "season" and the bacon is salty. Also I baked this at 350 for 30-35 mins.

This was delicious. Thanks!  Based on the reviews I set the temperature to 350 and the timer for 30 minutes and then 5 more. Used a Pillsbury pie crust.

Had to raise the temperature to 350 and cook for an additional 35 minutes.
