I'll admit that I was looking for a dish to use up some random vegetables in the fridge and this one fit the bill!  The only real changes I made were to use ALL the vegetables I had (onions, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, and a green bell pepper.)  Other than that, I had to use all fish sauce since I was fresh out of oyster.  I also used fresh garlic, sauteed with the veggies, instead of garlic powder.  I'm fairly sad I was out of eggs, because I think they would be a great addition to this dish.  Luckily, I have plans to make it again, so I'll let ya know!  This was great and I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch...if they make it that long.

This was really good! Normally I modify the ingredients of a dish after cooking, but this one is good just as it is. I did add a few tablespoons of water late in the cooking process because things were drying out, but I probably could have avoided that with better timing. Really tasty, I had seconds.

Of course I changed it up ...the sauce I double the recipes and added 1/2 teaspoon onion powder ... I cooked chicken with onion, garlic,celery,carrot with an splash of orange juice together and set aside...my fresh veggies (pea pods, broccoli,spinach) and water chestnuts all on the side and I cooked up a pound of fettuccine pasta....I had 4 people eating a three different times...to accommodate .... In a saut√© pan I scrambled up an egg once cooked added1/2 c sauce, veg, pasta and meat mixture then served... Everyone Loved it! This is a keeper!

Delicious! We luv Chinese at my house but take out is always so greasy - problem solved with this sauce! I don't exactly follow the veggie part, I just use whatever I have on hand. Typically it's red & yellow peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, onions, and broccoli, and just out of personal preference, I always use fresh garlic & ginger instead of powder. I've made this probably a dozen times and it comes out perfect every time. Thanks for sharing!

This was a quick easy dinner using items I had on hand.  I used veggies that I had: green beans, carrots, celery, onion & mushrooms.  I also used low sodium soy, teriyaki sauce & eel sauce because that's what I had.  Still a great quick weekday meal.

Very delicious!  It looks a little dry at first, but that sauce packs a lot of punch!  I thought I would need extra sauce, but I am so glad I didn't try to change it before tasting it!  So good!

9-4-2018 ~Following the recipe loosely, I ended up with something very satifsfying.  I used a variety of vegetables, basically what I found in the fridge: red bell pepper, zucchini, onion, broccoli and bean sprouts, but a recipe like this isn't fussy.  Use whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand or what you prefer.  I didn't use the garlic powder, since fresh was superior and already called for.  I didn't use ginger because I'm not a fan of it,  nor sugar because I didn't see the need for it, let alone as much as directed. The fish, soy and oyster sauces are integral to the recipe in my opinion, and should not be omitted. (My photo may look "off" because I used those fake noodles you find in the produce department, good for the most part because you save a ton of carbs and 
calories)

Yoooo!!!!!  This recipe was on time....delicious!  I did not have any oyster sauce and it still came out fantastic.  I used fresh green beans, cabbage, baby bella mushrooms and onions came out awesome.  It's going to be a long time before I order Lo Mein from the Chinese restaurant again.

This is my all time go to dish.  I make it with chicken or beef or seafood.  The only adjustment I make is triple the sauce, as we like ours saucy and the vegetables vary upon what's in the fridge.

I made double the sauce which you definitely need it.  Instead i used fresh garlic  8 cloves and I didn't have enough fresh ginger to do the full amount from dry to fresh conversions so I just did 2TBs fresh ginger and then 1/2 a tsp powdered ginger. I also used white mushrooms and added 2 sliced carrots,  2 celery stocks and about 1/2 cup snap peas and i subbed 2 green onions for the yellow onion. Then I added about a 1/4 chopped peanuts.  If your a big fan of veggies like my family its just nice to add a little more to the dish. Also if your looking of a great dish to pair with this one then i'd recommend the: Grilled Peanut Chicken recipe. The two dishes compliment each other nicely. Happy cooking and thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Very flavorful dish and I used sauce I've never used before so that was an experience fairly easy after the chopping (I don't have any fancy equipment in my kitchen), but I DO NOT recommend heating the shrimp first but adding them in the last 2-3 minutes.

so freaking good! i made this for my family with ingredients i basically had on  hand. the only small add-ins i made were cooking the shrimp and vegetable separately and then mixing them together and adding chicken broth to the sauce. i will undoubtedly make this dish again. thank you very much for the submission.

Wow! This was a great recipe.   The sauce is phenomenal.  Such a wonderful recipe because you can make it to individual taste.  We made both shrimp and steak Lo Mein.  We varied the veggies to suit each person and just made smaller portions.  Thanks for a great recipe, we'll never order Lo Mein take out again.

I used the sauce components of this recipe, sans the noodles anad veggies, as the brown sauce for cashew chicken. Delicious! From now on, this will be my go-to standard recipe for chinese brown sauce.

My husband and I thought this was good as written. Next time, because I'm a fan of broccoli, I'll add more. I'm not a fan of sugar in otherwise savory dishes, so next time I'll also try cutting the sugar at least in half.

So good! I used whatever veggies I had (no mushrooms or broccoli but I had carrots, celery and shredded some cabbage). The sauce is the showstopper though! I didn't have fish sauce, but I had anchovies. So I added the oil from that and chopped up the anchovies and added them at the end. No regrets!!

I didn‚Äôt have any fish sauce so I substituted chicken broth. It was very tasty nonetheless. The only other changes were cutting back on the spaghetti to 6 oz, and using 1/2 pound shrimp instead of 1 pound. Despite cutting down on these ingredients, there was still enough for 3 large or 4 normal servings. I can‚Äôt imagine how the recipe contributor considered the original recipe as TWO servings. Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar to 1 Tablespoon.

I used leftover pork chops (cubed) to make this dish.  I didn't have oyster.sauce, but I did use the soy and fish sauce.  I doubled the sauce for this recipe and it was delish.  My husband and I had it for dinner and I had the rest of it for breakfast the next day.

I took the advice of others and added the shrimp late/at the end. I also grated some fresh ginger and I added a few splashes of soy sauce at the end and stirred it a bit more. Turned out great!

I do the veg version. No shrimp. I add like 3 onions and a bell pepper so that the sauce can increase. I agree that it will be a bit dry if you don't do that. Only used soy sauce but still came out great. Added a little bit of water to soy sauce at the end. Eggs are also nice. Healthy and yummy!

So good! I doubled the recipe because I prefer to have leftovers. I didn't have fish sauce but just used extra soy sauce instead. Delicious!! Really loved it and will make it many more times in the future.

I doubled the sauce and still found it dry.  Had to add some chicken broth and more soy sauce.  Did not have fish sauce so substituted worceshire.   Not sure if that makes a difference.  Did everything else as stated   Just OK as made.

This was an excellent dish.  The entire family enjoyed it.  I used different vegetables (carrot, celery, onion, mushrooms) and a seafood mix.  Very good. Will make this again and again with different combos.

Good, quick meal. I used actual rice noodles. My warning would be for the amount of soy sauce you use. I am not a big salt user and this recipe was way too salty. Luckily I was making it for my boyfriend, lol. I would suggest only using half the soy sauce could for, then adding more to taste at the end.

Outstanding! The sauce defiantly makes this dish. I doubled the recipe and tripled the sauce. Added one yellow pepper, one red pepper, celery, green onion, carrots and mushrooms. Will definitely make this again.

Super easy. I used my cast iron wok for the first time on this one , and it came out great.

Throughout cooking process, I used medium-high to high heat to keep the liquid to a minimum.

For step 1, I swapped the spaghetti noodle for instant Ramen noodle. Ramen noodle held up good to me.

For step 2, I used a store-bought teriyaki sauce instead of the homemade sauce.

After adding sauce at the end, I cooked a little longer than 2 min, to let the sauce absorb and kinda caramelize a bit.

Do yourself a favor and double the sauce. We no longer do take out Lo Mein. When shrimp is on sale we make this. If it is not on sale we use this with flank steak. In addition I add 2 packs of frozen Asian vegetables

Very good. I already had all the ingredients except fish sauce. I made a few changes. I used green onion instead of yellow. I substituted a little extra soy sauce for the fish sauce, steamed the broccoli before adding it, and didn't use the eggs.  I used canned mushrooms, too. The fam loved it, thank you.

I used low sodium soy sauce and lowest sodium oyster sauce I could find.  I had fish sauce at home which I now see is super high in sodium.  Anyway, I thought it was too salty.  I will look to see if I can find lower sodium fish sauce.  
otherwise flavor was good and I also used a bunch of additional veggies- snow peas, peppers, broccoli, ect.

Great dish, but I thought it needed more flavor, so will be doubling the sauce portion of the recipe next time.  Otherwise, you can alter the choice of vegetables to suit your taste.

Not bad, though 8oz spaghetti seemed a little too much for this recipe.  Would add almost twice the veggies next time.  Good though.

This was great! I would say you could use just about any veggies (and twice as much!) and have this taste great. I used green & yellow string beans, carrots, and peas, all from frozen. I didn't change the recipe otherwise and my husband and toddler both loved it. Will make again! So much less greasy than take-out.

I made this for dinner last night, I omitted the ginger, fish sauce, and eggs. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and carrots instead of mushrooms and added a tiny dash of cayenne. It tasted even better when I reheated it today for lunch.

This was awesome and my family loved it!! I used mixed frozen veggies instead of what the ingredients state. I also used a long stem onion instead of yellow onion. I added more soy sauce and less brown sugar to take away some of the sweetness! ! Again the family loves it, I will definitely make It again!

very nice dish!
I did however use rice noodles instead of spaghetti...
and i cooked too many noodles, which soaked up a lot of the sauce. my fault tho, not the recipe. 
next time i'll use a little less ginger, I will be cooking this again!!!

PERFECT!! I added extra veggies because I had them on hand. Will make again for sure.
