Wonderful!  I found an orange cake mix at my store, but chose the white cake mix instead, because the orange stripes that the jello makes are pretty when served (you wouldn't see them if the cake were orange).  I added 1 tsp. orange extract to the batter for orange flavor (would definitely do again!).  I like the taste of Dream Whip better than the frozen whipped topping, so I whipped up the pudding mix, same amount of milk, and 1 envelope of Dream Whip.  I used 3/4 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 tsp. orange extract (thought the original amounts might be too overpowering).  The results were fantastic!  I used a nice garnish - sliced a small orange thin, then cut each slice halfway, twisted, and placed them on top.  Pretty!  Will definitely make this cake again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this cake!! I make it all the time, and i put 1 package of dream whip in my cake mix, and my cake comes out the perfect texture everytime.  Before I discovered dream whip my cakes were always moist but still crumbly (like a normal cake), but if you are using a white cake with this recipe and want the orange stripes to show perfectly, then use dream whip because it keeps your cake still very moist, but makes it a little firmer and dense (but not dry at all)so when you cut into it, it looks pretty and smooth and no crumbs.

What a wonderful dessert this is! I decided to make cupcakes instead of a cake (easier to transport and share). To the batter I added 1 tsp of orange extract for flavoring and also to try to mask that artificial "cake mix" taste that cake box mixes tend to leave as an aftertaste in my mouth. I made 20 cupcakes altogether. It took 23 minutes to bake. I poked holes into the cupcakes while it was still hot using toothpicks, then drizzled the orange gelatin over. I let it cool completely, 1 hour. To the pudding mix I added 1 tsp orange extract, omitting the vanilla extract, plus I added some orange zest. I folded in half of the cool whipped topping and spread around the cupcakes. It was just the right amount of frosting for each cupcake.  I placed the cupcakes into the refrigerator to chill. The results were fantastic! A light, refreshing delicious ORANGE-Y cupcake. Yum! These tasted just like orange dreamsicles I remember as a little girl. The cake itself is moist and the whipped pudding on top of the cupcake is light and creamy orange-y. I can see the specks of orange zest throughout the frosting and I really liked the stripe design on the inside of the cupcakes. Although I don't know if anyone else noticed the strips in the cupcakes as they were gobbled up so fast! All I was told is that it tasted good-like orange shebert. This recipe is easy to follow and leaves room to try a variety of other flavors in place of orange. A keeper for use again!

I made two of these, one with the cool whip topping as the recipe calls for, and also a cream-cheese dreamsicle icing.  Both taste JUST like the dreamsicle ice cream treat.  The cream cheese icing is as follows:  cream 1/2 of an 8-oz cream cheese block with 1 1/2 Tablespoons chilled butter until fluffy.  Mix in two cups sifted confectioners sugar.   Mix in 2 Tablespoons vanilla extract and 1 Tablespoon orange extract.  This icing is much thinner than the cool whip topping but tastes the same.

This cake is cool and creamy with a slight tang....delicious! It is not nearly too sweet as one person said, sorry you must have done something wrong.  By the way, I also tried it with cherry chip cake mix and cherry jello....OH MY GOODNESS!!!

I used a white cake mix and added 1 tsp orange extract to the mix.  I also used 1 package orange jello instead of orange extract in the frosting.  Prepare 1 day ahead of time and chill.  Prepared this for a birthday party and got many many compliments on how good it was.

Great recipe!  I used yellow cake mix and 1 tsp orange extract and it was even better the second day.  I will definitely make again.  A great frosting recipe for a all sorts of recipes.  Any flavoring could be added instead of the orange.

This cake came out moist and delicious, and didn't taste like a "cake mix" cake.  I left out the orange flavoring in the frosting though and just used vanilla extract instead.  Edit 9/18/15:  Still making this cake, almost 10 years after I left this review.  I use a chop stick to make the holes now(perfect size.)  This cake works with many different flavors, just by switching out the jello and/or cake mix flavor.  I've tried strawberry (not so great) and lime (excellent.)  The orange may still be my favorite though.

This cake was awesome!!!  Everyone loved it and I have had multiple requests to make it again.  Shared the recipe with a friend and it was a big hit at her party too.  I did follow the advice of the other reviewers and used the Duncan Hines Butter White cake with 1 1/2 tsp of orange extract in the batter.  The frosting is wonderful.  This cake is not to sweet at all.  Making another for Father's day but going to try with lemon.

I couldn't find orange cake at my local store so I added  1 tbsp of orange extract to my white cake mix and an envelope of dream whip as others suggested. I heated the water that was suggested on the cake box then added one packet of orange jello mix to it. When it was cool I added to the eggs and oil. This turns the cake mix orange and added more orange flavor. I also zested some orange into the batter. After I put the icing on it I sliced up some fresh orange and put it on top of it, it turned out wonderful! I had many compliaments on this cake! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I make this a lot during the summer. I call it Creamsicle Cake. The extract isn't really needed in the "frosting".  If you don't have either and want your "frosting" more orange-y, you can add a half packet of orange unsweetened drink mix (think Kool-Aid) and have it come out close. I stud the top of the cake with mandarin oranges.

This didn't do much for me or anyone in my family.  It was just okay.  The flavor was good, but it wasn't that moist.  I probably won't make this one again.

Easy to make and refreshing to taste!  I made this on a beach trip from which my family just returned.  Everyone loved it because it wasn't too heavy - a perfect summer dessert.  Even my nephews, ages 6 and 9 liked it!  I added some sliced oranges to the top to dress up the presentation.  I'd definitely make it again.  Next time, I'm trying it with strawberry instead.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Finding an orange cake mix (in any brand) was mission impossible in my town.  SO - I used vanilla cake mix and added 2 TBLS OJ concentrate to it.  Still, pretty good cake (although I believe it would be better if the correct cake mix had been used). The whipped "frosting" truly reminded me of a dreamcicle! Thanks!

This cake is delicious and gets moister the longer it sits...One thing this recipe fails to mention is that the cake should be refrigerated as soon as the gelatin is poured over it. Also, it needs to stay refrigerated due to the whipped topping.

This was the hit of our Memorial Day cookout. Light, cool, and creamy, it's perfect. And it's not really that sweet. I think I'll try cupcakes the next time too. (And the orange cake mix IS hard to find. If you have Meijer grocery stores, they're the only ones that sell the DH orange cake mix around here.)

This was just "okay" for us.  I did use a white cake mix instead of orange, but don't think that the orange would have really helped.  The gelatin part just seemed to make the cake "wet" in places.  The topping was actually very good, and I ended up scraping most of it off and eating it with a spoon.  It was like a citrus mousse.  Wouldn't make the cake again, but may make the topping and eat it out of a bowl!

VERY GOOD except for the gloppy icing. The recipe was follwed exactly and the icing turned out too thin and too much like pudding. I had to leave it off and made a butter cream icing with orange extract. Then it was perfectly delicious.

Loved this cake!  I made this yesterday for my nieces 13th birthday party.  I took the advice of others and used Dnucan Hines Classic White cake mix.  I added 1&1/2 teaspoons orange extract to the batter.  I used a bamboo skewer to poke the holes with.  It was a very cool and refreshing summer dessert.  Will definantly make this again.

this cake was so good and very easy to make...Target didn't have an orange cake mix so I used a white cake mix and added two tablespoons of orange flavoring (if I do it this way again I would use 3 tablespoons) otherwise I made just as described...next time I may top with chocolate shavings we love that orange and chocolate taste...but as is the whole family gave it a great review

My mother-in-law made this for my birthday at my request.  Ever since, I've made this cake SO many times.  I'm usually anti-box cake, but it's just irresistible!  However, I have yet to have found an orange box cake.  I substitute a while cake mix and add a couple of teaspoons of orange extract to the mix.  If I use vanilla pudding I always substitute french vanilla instead, but I've topped it with Jello's cheesecake pudding and it's SOOO good.  You really can't go wrong with this cake if you like dreamcicles.  It really is easy to make.

This was well-received by the family- will make again, but with a couple of changes:  orange extract in the batter (1 and 1/2 tsps) and smaller and more holes so more "stripes" will appear throughout the cake.  Used a plain white cake mix and that worked great.  *Loved* the frosting!

I've made a lemon version (called Luscious Lemonade Cake) using lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, lemon extract and lemon jello.  Just as the name implies, it is absolutely luscious!!!   I'm anxious to try this orange version -- it has to be as good!!!!  I've found that the lemon one is best if made the day before.  Yummmm!!!!  I think I'll make this tonight.

Tastes just like a creamsicle!  I used skim milk and "lite" whipped topping and it tasted great.  Very easy to make as well!

I could not find Orange Cake mix so I substitued Betty Crocker "White Moist Cake Mix" I added zest of one orange & 1&1/2 teaspoons of orange flavoring to the cake mix.It was great. I brought it to a club function & had many people asking me for the recipe (even men).
I have since found the Orange Cake Mix & made it both ways but prefer the white cake mix the best.

I made this cake the first time following the orange recipe. The next time I used lemon in place of the orange. Talk about good, everyone loved both flavors. I wouldn't change a thing!

Great recipe. I used white cake mix with 1 tsp orange extract to batter. It turned out pretty with the orange and white. Thanks for a great recipe!

well, I first was going to rate it on sound alone due to the fact I couldn't find an orange cake mix after searching many places. In reading other reviews I read someone found it at meijers and i just called them and they said they carry it so Im off to Meijers to get the cake mix. Thank you for reviews, it really pays to read them, and that goes with about anything you are researching on the computer. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Does this cake have to be refrigerated?  If I take it to a barbecue, or an outdoor function, will the icing be yukky?  It sounds DELICIOUS!

I made this cake for a graduation party and there were several people who commented on how good it was. It was one of the few cakes that was completely gone by the end of the party. I really liked the frosting on this cake as it wasn't the typical type of frosting you usually get, that has so much sugar in it it's gritty. Would love to make it again, provided I can find another orange cake mix.

Thought it was a good recipe but I wasn't that excited about it.  Everyone at the dinner thought it was pretty good also.  I don't think I would make it again because I think I could find something better.

This cake is fabulous! My whole family loved it. Very light and moist. Not too sweet but just right. Can be adapted to many different flavors. Will be making this all summer long. It was gone in one day!

This is absolutely delicious! It is so cool and creamy. My husband and I couldn't 
stop eating it. The topping keeps it from being too sweet like a traditional frosting would
be.

I have made this recipe for years with just a little variation. If you can't find orange cake mix use vanilla, I always have plus I make jello by pacakage directions. You can also use strawberry cake mix,strawberry jello and strawberry extract. This is real tasty too.

I made thsi cake for a dessert party.  It was a big hit.  I used the white cake mix and a small bamboo skewer to poke the holes.  I think i might use something sligtly bigger next time but one of my new favs!

This cake was great! I made a few changes: I used Vanilla cake instead of Orange, and i just used simple buttercream icing instead of the one given in the recipe.  I put this cake in the refrigerator for about 2 hours until it was completely cool- it gave the cake a creamy texture and it really tasted like a Dreamsicle ice cream bar! Will definitely make again!!!

Nice change from other cakes. I followed the recipe, and the cake turned out great. The next day the cake was just as good. Over night in the refrigerator the cake was fine. Orange flavor was perfect. Would make again.

This cake had a nice flavor to it but it wasn't what I was expecting. I made this in a bundt pan and it came out nicely. The frosting came out wrong for me but that was my fault. This is a nice jello cake.

Pretty good, but I didnt like the cool whip icing.  Too fluffy.  I think next time I will use dream Whip so I can control the consistency.  I bet this would be good in any flavor.  Thanks.

As another reviewer suggested, I added orange zest and extract to a white cake mix since I can't find an orange cake mix anywhere - it was divine! I also garnished the top of each slice with 1/6 slice of orange and my guests asked where I bought such a lovely cake. I said, "Ha HA - I made it, thanks to Bea on Allrecipes.com!" THANK YOU!

I made this cake this weekend after Mother Nature dumped another 3 feet of snow on us, adding the the two feet already on the ground.  I thought we needed a taste of summer, and this was just the thing.  Everyone loved it.  I couldn't find the orange cake mix, so I used the white with the added orange zest and orange extract suggested by another cook.  What a cake!! Absolutely wonderful.  Will make this again for sure, AND if we ever get to summer, it will be a wonderful summertime dessert.  Thanks!

Loved the orange flavors.  I used the white cake mix and added 1 tsp of orange extract and 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter.  Thanks for the recipe!  I am adding this one in my favorites collection!  They went over very well at work!

If you can find orange cake mix (I had to try 5 different grocery stores before I lucked out, now I stock up), this cake is a crowd pleaser. Another one I made for my daughter's graduation party. It looks beautiful and tastes even better. Thanks, Bea!

Made this for a party and everyone LOVED it.  Didn't have orange extract so I only used the vanilla and it turned out fine.  Would be good with many different flavors - strawberry, cherry, pineapple, etc. Tried it with lemon and it was FANTASTIC!

I didn't have the orange extract and thought I could substitute it with orange juice.  The cake was good, just needed more orange flavor for me.

I really liked this cake, especially the frosting.  However, I don't think that Orange Jello really added much flavor to the orange cake mix.  Next time I may use a white cake mix instead and add a little orange extract as well as the Jello for a colorful presentation.  I would also like to make this as a layer cake so I could enjoy even more of the delicious frosting.  Update 8/2/04: There is a new "Signature Dessert" mix called Orange Dreamsicle, which appears to be quite similar.  I am curious to see how it will compare to this semi-homemade version.

This cake was so moist, so delicious, and so very simple to make.  I used vanilla cake mix since I was not able to find the orange and I think it turned out just perfect!  I will most definitely be making this refreshing treat a lot during the summer.

Just made this cake for a 4th of July party -- delicious, refreshing and easy to prepare.  Used yellow cake mix, teaspoon orange extract and orange zest.  Make this the day before -- it keeps beautifully.

This is an easy recipe and people LOVE this cake.  Every time I go to a BBQ or we have a pot luck at work, everyone insists that I bring the "orange cake".  Its a real crowd pleaser!  They ask me to make it no matter what time of year it is!  Thank you for this great recipe!

Icing was a little much, but can be adjusted the next time to use less. Not real sweet, but appealing flavors.

I substituted with sugar free pudding and sugar free jell-0. Although mine did not have the color this one has where the holes are, the cake was much more orange in color and flavor with the orange cake mix I used.
I did not know this has been around for a long time. Used to be known as "Poke Cake".

This is a very good recipe as written. I like it better by doubling the orange jello and using a white cake with orange extract. It's a very pretty cake that way and the flavor is great.

OMGoodness this was awesome! I am a chocolate person but my sons love Creamsicles so I made this for them. I couldn't find an orange cake mix so I used a yellow cake mix and substituted orange juice for the water. I don't like cool whip so I used real whip cream instead. I didn't have orange extract but had orange oil for candy making, used a few drops and it has a really fresh orange flavour. I also added a can of mandarin oranges drained and chopped up to the jello mixture.

I made this cake using 1/2 recipe of the "Thirty Minute Yellow Cake" recipe (also on A/R) baked in a 9 inch round dish (because I would eat a whole 13X9 all by myself if I made the big one :)  I used the whole 4 size serving box of sugar free Orange Jello as directed for the full recipe, and I "frosted" it with the recipe listed here, except I used sugar free french vanilla pudding, skim milk and only about 1 cup of cool whip lite, orange extract, no vanilla (I figured french vanilla had enough and it did).  OH MY GOSH, this was SOOOOO good, I couldn't even believe the version I made was reduced calorie and fat.  I am betting that this will be a new classic for me, I LOVE IT!

Good, cool cake.  If I were to make it again I'd put a can of mandarin oranges in the mix before baking it to give it a more 'orangey' flavor.  I also like the fact that it's refrigerated and it is still good with ice cream.

Absolutely delish! My grocery store didn't have orange cake mix so I went with lemon! It got wonderful reviews--and I'm thinking lemon cake mix with raspberry jello and some raspberry topping would be really good, too!

nice but next time think will use Grand Marnier in the cake and topping. Poke holes in cake and drizzle over and maybe whip into heavy cream and spread over cooled cake.

I also had trouble finding an orange cake mix.  I used a lemon cake instead and made this for Easter.  Everyone raved about the cake.  Coming from a family of chocolate lovers that was strong praise.

This cake was very tasty and simple to make. We love jello cake at our house, so it was a hit.

Very unique and delicious recipe!  The only thing I did differently was: I used french vanilla cake mix because I couldn't find orange, which actually worked out better - it gave the cake a 'marbled' effect when the jello was added. I baked it in a 13 x 9 cake pan. All in all, it was very delicious, we almost ate the whole thing in one weekend! The only reason why I couldn't give this recipe five stars is because the frosting left something to be desired. It lacked flavor and was too airy, which contrasted poorly with the dense texture of the cake. Next time I may try adding more pudding and less whipped cream, but I'll certainly be making this again!

I served this cake at my husband's 30th birthday party.  After the first mouthful I was apologizing to my guests.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This was sickeningly sweet.  I threw the rest of it out.  I love creamsicles but this did not do them justice.  Luckily I also had a chocolate cake made!

Excellent recipe.  Used white cake because I wanted the orange streaks. Was going to add dream whip to the cake mix, but I forgot.  Really didn’t need it.  Will definitely make again!

Nailed it! I couldn’t find orange cake so I took the suggestion of white cake and 1 tsp of orange extract. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious and tasted like the orange dreamsicle

I made it with what I had on hand... a lemon cake mix rather than an orange. I added a little lemon extract to the mix as well. I added orange zest to the topping & I did use the orange jello like the recipe called for.  Yummy!

This is the second time I have made this recipe! The first time I followed it exactly and loved it! The second time I decided to use my new kitchen aid and make homemade whipped cream to mix with the pudding. While the cake was in the oven, I mixed a small container of heavy whipping cream, a dash or so of vanilla, and a large sprinkle of stevia sweetener! I left it in my kitchen aid of med-high for several minutes until fluffy and then added the vanilla pudding/milk mixture. IT WAS FABULOUS!!

This was delicious! I did alter it a tad...I used a white cake mix and I added extra orange extract to the frosting. Use a nice big tool to make the pokes...when you get a bite of the Jello it is divine. This is very light...great after a heavy meal. Or perfect if you want a big piece (or two). I am going to make this again, subbing the orange for raspberry!

Made as per directions except used real whip cream instead of frozen  whipped topping. This is a family favorite.   Works great using a fork to poke holes instead of a wooden spoon.

Best cake ever. I used a white cake mix and added an envelope of Dream Whip to it. Something now I will always do to any box mix. Happen to have some orange cream ice cream sprinkles, that I put on top.

Made this cake for Father's day and everyone loved it. I used a lemon cake mix because I couldn't find an orange one. I also added some orange rind into the mix and used the orange jello. My son-in-law was especially fond of it and ate 1/2 of a 9 X 13 all by himself. Will make it again using different cake and jello flavors. Will also try making the cake from scatch as prefer them.

Quick, easy and tasty for a church potluck. I followed the directions only I used lemon cake mix with lemon jello and also substituted lemon extract for the orange extract in the topping. Yum! I will try the orange version in the future. I love that the icing incorporates vanilla pudding also and is not just plain cool whip like many other "poke" cakes.

I made this my oldest son's birthday back in August.  It was an okay recipe.  I wouldn't totally rave about it, but it tasted about how I expected.  Like others have said I had to use white cake because I couldn't find an orange cake mix.  Will probably make it again but most likely will add more orange flavoring.

We live in a town of about 25,000 people, and have 4 grocery stores, but none had an orange cake mix, so substitued a lemon cake mix. It was the closest thing I could find. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Very good and moist. Definitely a keeper!!!

We all enjoyed this cake.  I have tried both Cool Whip and Dream Whip.  I liked both.

The Jello really didn't do anything for me in this cake. If I make this again, I will skip the Jello. I used suggestions of others here and added a little orange oil to a white cake mix, as well as using Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip.

This was good, not really what I expected.  I agree with the others that it is impossible to find orange cake mix.  I used a white cake mix and some orange extract & zest.  I topped it with Manderian orange pieces, and it was very pretty, it just didn't have enough orange flavor for me.

Wonderful!  I made it into cupcakes and then froze them.  Wow, the neighborhood kids are beating the door down for them.  My 13-year old snatched one as he ran out the door to school (sugar high at 7 a.m.!)

Cool, refreshing, a touch of heaven in your mouth! One of the best cakes I have ever eaten. I added just a little extra orange extract though.  Wonderful for dessert on a hot summer evening.

Takes a little time, but when all the kids say "yum! Tastes just like a dreamsicle popsicle, more please!" you'll know it was worth it. Not just for kids, very refreshing for the adults too.

I made this cake for a dessert after a barbecue - it was a hit! It's so light that everyone "had room," and even my dad, who's not big on sweets, loved it! Probably just my area, but had to go to 3 different stores to find orange cake mix.

Loving Dreamsicle's/50-50 bars as a kid, I was quite anxious to give this recipe a try.  I was NOT disappointed!  Not only is this cake yummy, the flavors seem to enhance with time.  For that reason I would make it the day before instead of letting it sit for one hour prior to serving.  Very refreshing and a wonderful summer dessert.

This cake is wonderful. It is light 
adn refreshing. A true taste of summer
but perfect for year around.
