Absolutely delicous. I made no changes or substitutions. The kids had seconds and ate everything that was left in the pan. They could not stop talking about how good it was! Next time, I'll try this with raisins or chopped apples and see if I can't pull it off.

This was delicious. I am only making enough for one so I cut the measurements a little under half. I also am half asleep & used oatmeal before my mind caught up with the fact it said cream of wheat. It was still delicious I just drained off some of the liquid. Update - I made with cream of wheat the next morning. Excellent. Thanks!

I usually use more evaporated millk to water, and just use vanilla, butter, and sugar.  So this was an interesting and yummy change of pace.  4 stars because it didn't knock my socks off, but we liked it a lot. Thanks for giving me the chance to switch things up a bit!

I liked this recipe.  I didn't give it 5 stars since it is not fantastic enough to win over non-cream of wheat eaters.  My kids didn't like it.  But, I'll make it again for myself!  Thanks!

This was good, but I doubled the vanilla and added a bit more of the spices. I added some pecans, which gave it a nice crunch. Also, I think brown sugar would be better than white sugar in this. All in all, I liked it.

I love this version of farina! I eat cream of wheat often, so I cook this recipe once or twice a week. The only thing I changed is instead of butter, I use organic extra virgin coconut oil. When I reheat the cereal, I use evaporated milk to make it creamier. I top the cereal with sliced almonds and dried cranberries.

I loved this recipe, but half of my family didn't.  That's the only reason I put 4 stars.  I did double the recipe because I have a large family and found that I didn't need as much water.  You only need 6 cups instead of 8 when doubling.  Other than that, it has a wonderful taste.
