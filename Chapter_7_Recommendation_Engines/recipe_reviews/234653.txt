Easy, fast and tasty Christmas Eve fondue. We used water instead of wine for the kids. Dipped ham, pineapple, olive rosemary bread, figs, walnuts, pear, apple, lightly steamed broccoli and cauliflower

This is a perfect cheese fondue recipe and more economic than the traditional swiss recipes. I used 5 year old Balderson Cheddar and a little more wine. I served it in preheated stoneware bowls set beside each oil pot (shared by 2 ppl).  Even if this cheese sauce cools it does not solidify like the swiss recipes. It will be our go-to recipe for cheese fondue from here on in.

Easy to make and great fondue recipe for kids.  I didnt have wine so I used milk to thin it and extra of the other ingredients to get rid of the 'can' taste.  This will be my go-to recipe for low-carb eating (no cornstarch or flour)

This was easy and turned out pretty good. I did feel that the cheese soup overpowered the other ingredients just a bit. I think next time I would add a little more Worcestershire and mustard to tame the "can" taste. The consistency was excellent and held up well when it started to cool so that was a huge bonus.

I made this recipe tonight and we all really liked it.  It served 3 of us nicely so you may want to double it for more people.  I served it with ham chunks, granny smith apples,  pretzel bread, carrots and boiled potatoes. Yummy!
