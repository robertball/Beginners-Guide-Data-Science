First bite in and my husband said, "Now this is the way to eat a baked potato". These turned out really good. The directions are a bit confusing when it comes to cutting the potato. "Through a long side"? I read that as lengthwise but that didn't seem right to me. I cut them hassleback style so that I could get a good "fan" on them. Whichever way you choose to cut them, don't skip the onions. They are magical. Excellent recipe!

I lay a wooden spoon on each side of the potato so I don't cut it too far down. Great recipe

I made these on the grill according to the recipe. They were good and not too difficult to make. Be careful when slicing that you don't cut so far as to make the break apart while cooking. I used russet potatoes but would have preferred Yukon Gold due to the inherent bitterness of the russet potato  skin.

Be aware that the butter disappears into the potato. I suggest adding plenty of Vidalia onions on top before wrapping them in foil.

After cooking these on the grill, I researched Hasselback potato recipes and found several alternative recipes. I will bake them in the oven the next time I make them to see if they really do come out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside like a french fry as described.

I have been doing this for years. Only thing is, I just use a whole potato not sliced and I use diced shallots instead of the onion used here. and minced garlic along with salt and pepper and the butter. Wrap them twice with heavy duty foil so they steam in butter and won't leak much.

When I made it, very little of the butter stayed in the potato.  I think if the potato was sliced only across the top, the butter might have stayed in better.

The onions didn't look caramelized like in the photo and we couldn't taste onion flavor in the potato.
