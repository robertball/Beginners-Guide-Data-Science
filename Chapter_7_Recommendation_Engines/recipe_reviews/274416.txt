fun to make, amazing flavour even as just the batter and could make a great dip too. I'm not a salt person so didn't any more and will try to make this with less salty cheese etc. and needs more in a way to not let the cheesecake flop. water try underneath. will be making this again ;)

switched out the Swiss for Sharp Cheddar, used 1/4 cp precooked crumbled bacon, and 3 Tablespoons minced red pepper.
