When reading the ingredients, with the exception of the rice wine vinegar, this sounded really good.  Because I had limited time I quartered the potatoes instead of keeping them whole.  This allowed them to get nice and tender in the short period of time I had. These were good, not great.  They browned nicely, but in spite of the bacon and the rosemary, which generally contribute great flavor, they just didn’t have a lot of, how shall I say it…spunk.

Super easy recipe! I used the rice vinegar the first time and red wine vinegar the second time and I prefered the red wine vinegar (personal preference). Will definitely use this method to roast potatoes on a hot day...so much better than preheating your oven at 425.

These were really good but I thought they would be great. I used a tri colored mixture of fingerling potatoes. Did not deviate from instructions I just expected more of the bacon flavor. Maybe I will try with a different bacon because I will make them again.

We loved these potatoes.  I did have to blot out some of the bacon grease - there was a LOT of grease, but that might have just been the bacon I used.  I could not find the little purple potatoes so I use red and white ones.  The splash of rice vinegar is a nice touch.

I used frozen creamer potatoes packaged by The Little Potato Company, but I think this recipe would work equally well with any baby or new potato variety.

I made no changes and I was skeptical while I was cooking these that the bacon wouldn't burn. But it didn't burn and they were delicious!

Just used the recipe for temp & timing and used just bacon fat I had saved and used different spices. Turned out great!

Went with idea of it. Used 2 slices of bacon instead of 4 and was plenty. Forgot the vinegar and left out rosemary. Will try again with halved baby potatoes and red wine vinegar.

Fabulous and easy. You can do this with Yukon Gold's that are cut into small potato size. Not as pretty, but tastes great! Remarkable, thanks again Chef John!

Definitely will make again!  I had bacon pre made so I added cooked bacon after 10 minutes and cooked with a TBSP of bacon grease to start with.  After it was done, I added 1 TBSP of Mirin rice wine (all I had on hand) and used dried rosemary.  This is quite honestly one of the best things I've ever made.

Sooo good! The potatoes are perfect---a combo of crispy, bacon-y goodness on the outside and soft, buttery awesomeness on the inside. Can't. stop. eating them.

I tried this recipe last night so yummy. Didn't have rice vinegar but it was still delicious. My daughter isn't usually a fan of potatoes but she had seconds. And that's all ways a great sign that it's delicious

I used purple potatoes. I too was a first time user of rice vinegar. I will use this recipe again.
