This was fantastic - made with almond crusted tilapia and the bean salad was a great side dish!  The Italian dressing and lemon really gives it a nice flavor, along with the cilantro.  I made this recipe exactly as indicated - will definitely be making this again!

I  really like this recipe. I must include that I made it the first time without onions since I did not have any available and it turned out great. The second time I made sure to include the large, red onion and it was a bit too strong for my husband and I. I will continue to use this recipe, but will not be including the onions next time.

5.4.16   I used a lime instead of a lemon (what I had on hand) and Bernstein’s Light Cheese Fantastico dressing (a very light dressing that tastes like Italian with parmesan, romano & provolone cheeses added) which I buy at Costco instead of Italian dressing.  Tasted it, thought it was a little weak in flavor, so I about another Tbsp of dressing, and some Sriracha® Hot Chili Sauce which gave it that little zing I was looking for.  Very nice bean salad.
