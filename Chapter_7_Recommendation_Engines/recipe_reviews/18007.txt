Delicious...I cooked in a 10" bundt pan and that worked well!  This is a nice alternative to cake.

This was excellent, made it for brunch and it was praised a lot. 
Now, I tinkered a lot with the recipe as I did not have time to choose something else for the meal and was out of ingredients,YET this tasted GREAT.In case someone's in a circumstance like mine: THIS WORKS. Out of all purpose flour, I substituted 50% whole wheat flour. Also, halved this recipe as I wanted to make less. Added only one Tbs lemon juice and mixed everything with hand. Baked it in a 9"x 5" bread loaf pan.Inspite of all this, this looked great and tasted like a wonderful coffee cake. Thanks a lot for this lovely recipe Paul.

I really disliked the texture of this bread. And the egg taste was very strong. Everyone in my family felt the same.

This bread tasted just like sponge cake.
