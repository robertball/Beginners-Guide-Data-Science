My family loves this!  The recipe I have is actually a slow cooker recipe and the ingredients are doubled as follows:  1/2 C butter, 2 pkgs dry italin dressing, 1 C white wine, 2 Cans golden mushroom soup, 8 oz tub cream cheese w/chives & onion.

Place chicken in slow cooker, pour melted ingredients over chicken, cover and cook on low for 4 to 5 hours.

I serve over penne pasta.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used some of the suggestions on the other reviews.  I used a 10oz. can of chicken broth instead of the wine.  Since we don't like mushrooms I substituted cream of chicken with herbs this was a good choice.  I also cut chicken into strips, seasoned well and cooked on stove.  I then put chicken in the pan and poured the sauce over and baked for 30 min just so flavors could blend.  It could be eaten right away.  I used rigatoni pasta instead of angel.  This was absolutely delicious!!!  Will make many times!

This chicken was SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!  I added olives, green onions, and mushrooms and used plain cream cheese, doubled the sauce, and served it over penne pasta and fresh broccoli(yummmm, definitely try it with broccoli).  It was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever tasted or made!!  It would also be pretty simple to lower the fat in this recipe.  I'm new to cooking and didn't let the cream cheese soften before putting it in the sauce- definitely a mistake!!  It took more than half an hour to get the sauce smooth, but that was my fault.

First, I read about 300 of this recipes reviews so that I had a clear picture of what was wrong with it. 

I used an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, 2 cans of soup, one packet of Italian dressing mix, 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup milk, I didn't use butter, just mixed the seasoning packet into the soup while it was warming. I also added a can of mushrooms. One full pound of pasta serves 8, so it would be okay to not use a full pound with 6 breasts. I cut my breasts into strips and poured the sauce over and baked for about 40 minutes at 350, perfect. Everyone liked this recipe, including me, but we must be tough coz the family gave this 4 stars so that is how I rated it as well. We will be making this again.

Wonderful easy dish that translates well to a slow cooker.  Used 1 package of Garlic Herb Italian Dressig mix as that's all I had.  Cut back on the butter to 1/8 cup.  Added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1 8oz package of mushrooms.  Sauce was a little thinner that I anticipated, but nothing a nice golden roux couldn't correct!.  This is a great recipe to make ahead or freeze:  Prepare recipe as directed. Transfer to a 13- x 9-inch baking dish, and let cool completely. Can be frozen up to three months. Thaw before reheating. To reheat, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake at 325° for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 minutes or until thoroughly heated.  Easy, uncomplicated, simple ingredients that will tantilize your tastebuds upon the first bite.

I have made this a dozen imes and given this recipe away to many people - all who have loved it.  This recipe also *very easily* adapts to the slow cooker!!  Just mix together your ingresdients, place the chicken in the cooker and pour the seasoning mix over the top.  If you don't have crm. cheese with chives, make your own from block cream cheese and fresh or dried chives.
Try it in the slow cooker (crock pot) - you won't be disappointed!

This is my favorite recipe from this site so far!!! Wonderful hardly describes the taste!! After trying it once or twice following the recipe, I added fresh sliced mushrooms and stirred/cooked them with the chicken/sauce. Approx 5-8 minutes prior to being done, I cooked frozen finely chopped broccoli and sprinkled it in the top.  Everyone loved it...even my 5 yr old!!  In addition, I passed this recipe on to my mom...who is "the best cook in the world" and who thinks that great tasting food cannot be that easy to prepare, and she loved it!!  Her and I both have this recipe is classified "for guests." (Although I make it often as it is sooooo easy to prepare) Thank you!!!!

This was a good recipe, and different than the norm.  I used chicken broth as a subsitute for the wine.  My daughter (5) who HATES cream of mushroom soup, and can usually tell whenever I use it but she LOVED this.  She said "mom-I like this cheese sauce" (lol), and she ate seconds!!  My husband LOVED it, and couldn't stop saying how well it tasted.  I thought it was good, but not 5 star quality.  The chicken was really tender, but the long cooking time seems to take away a lot of the sauce--there didn't seem to be enough.  The second time I made this I added a whole can of chicken broth, which made a BIG difference in the amount it made.

Excellent recipe.. It is so simple and tasty.   Only changes:  doubled the sauce; used two packages of chicken tenderloins cut into bite sized pieces.  Seasoned the chicken (on both sides) with a little greek seasoning (don't overdo it), garlic powder, and black pepper before placing into the 9x13 pan (prepared with cooking spray).  I sauteed one half of a large sweet onion (sliced thin) in the melted butter in a saucepan until golden, and then added the remaining sauce ingredients.  I used an 8oz tub of cream cheese spread with onion and garlic, not just a block of plain cream cheese.  I've never seen a block of cream cheese with chives, just in the tub containers.   Highly recommend you use GOLDEN mushroom soup to give it the rich color and flavor, not regular Cream of Mushroom soup.  I used the two full packets of "Zesty" Italian dressing packets - no need to cut back, we did not find it too salty.  Recommend a good white wine with no chicken broth substitutions.. this is the only way you will truly appreciate the outstanding flavors of the recipe as posted.  I don't think chicken broth would ever yield the best flavor in this recipe.  A good Sauvignon Blanc enhances the flavor of this dish.   For lots of sauce to cover the pasta, I kept it covered with foil for the first 20-30 mins to retain the liquid, then removed the foil for the last half of cooking time.   My family loved this dish and asked that we put it in our family favorites recipe box.

This recipe has been around a long time in various versions and can be made much easier & faster. There is no need to bake the chicken. I cut up boneless skinless chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. I sprinkle the pack of Italian dressing seasoning over them in the pan and saute until no longer pink. I deglaze the pan with a little white wine (1/4 cup) and add the golden mushroom soup and cream cheese. I thin out the sauce with chicken broth, add veggies if I want and serve over linguine. I do away with the butter and all the other steps. It's much faster and dirties fewer pans.

This dish was wonderful. My husband said it was definitely "restuarant quality" which is a great rating for him. I am serving it to my entire family this weekend. I also doubled the sauce recipe.

What a simple & delicious dish for a quick preparation meal!  As per all the recipes that I try out, I make AS IS at least the first time around.  This one really needs no change.  I would disagree with people that substituted anything for the wine; it really adds a nice aroma and taste.  Use a wine that you would drink with the meal.  A cheap wine could ruin this one.  I have to admit that I had never used/heard of golden mushroom soup.  Although it gives and interesting color, it is exactly what the recipe needs.  Do not substitute for cream of mushroom soup!  I used Philadelphia Chives and Onion cream cheese as I did not find the chive-only kind.  I would keep it next time around.  If anything I would agree that one could cut down the butter in half (i.e. 1/8 cup of butter).  I only used half a pound of the angel hair though, and it was just fine.  This is more a question of portion control that how the recipe would have turned out.

On another note, I see several people cutting their chicken since they don't find that the sauce makes it into the chicken breast.  Just for calibration, a "normal" chicken breast is between 4 to 6 oz.  If you buy the "mammoth" breast that are sold (at around ~12 oz each), they are so thick that the flavor doesn't get through.  At six chicken breasts, you should be buying 1 1/2 to 2 1/4 pounds.  Do either one of two things: buy six "healthy" portion of 4-6 oz each or buy three mammoth ones and just cut/butterfly along its thick side.

This is great! I increased the sauce by using 8 oz cream cheese and 15 oz can of chicken broth, no wine. (I did not double the dressing mix or the mushroom soup). I sauteed a carton of sliced mushrooms and some garlic in the butter at the beginning. I precooked the chicken breasts, cut them in bite sized pieces and added to the sauce. Used fetticini pasta, I think angel hair is too thin for this rich, thick sauce.

Great recipe!!!  I sauteed chopped green onions, fresh mushrooms, and garlic with the butter.  I also used Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup, Chicken broth, and also included the white wine...Yummm!!!  I used Fat Free Dry Hidden Valley Italian dressing mix, and it wasn't salty at all.  I cut my chicken into strips, and made everything right on the stove top which reduces the time.  I think some green and red peppers would make it even better, and maybe a pinch of cayenne pepper for some kick...Angel hair pasta goes great!!! I made 1/2 lb. pasta with 4 chicken breats and there was plenty of sauce.  My family loved this recipe!!!  Thanks!!!

This is an awesome dish! I've made it twice - once with ziti and once with angel hair...best with angel hair. I sauteed my chicken in bite-size pieces, removed from pan and then made the sauce...doubled the butter, cream cheese and soup and added sliced fresh mushrooms...mixed in the chicken and simmered slowly for 15-20 minutes..serve over pasta and DELICIOUS! DH loves it! 1st time I doubled the dry dressing and it was too much - one packet is plenty.  Don't let the color of this dish throw you off - it tastes wonderful! Thanks, Marian!!

The Staff at PastaRecipe has modified the ingredients in this recipe to read: 1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style dressing mix (replacing "1 (4.7 ounce) package").  The old measure may explain some of the saltiness reviews below.  Give it a try and see what you think!

This recipe is very good.  I agree with other's that it's a tad salty but still delicious.  I used bowtie pasta and ended up having some pasta and sauce leftover.  I ate them the next day and it tasted even better.  I'll make this one again.

Based on all the fairly positive reviews of this recipe, I was optomistic that this would be a great tasting dish.  Unfortunately, it was quite bad.  The taste was bland and to be honest, it just didn't even look very tasty.  I would avoid this recipes and look elsewhere.

I decided to give this recipe 5 stars because of how easy it is to prepare and how flavorful it is despite my following suggestions:  This dish is very salty.  Next time I plan on using low sodium soup and a little less of the dressing mix.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  This recipe is very easy to vary.  Try Marsala wine.  Add veggies.  Would be great with shrimp instead of chicken.  This recipe is a keeper or my family.

I found this recipe on a blog several months ago as a slower cooker recipe with fresh mushrooms - happy to see it here!    It is FABULOUS!  To make this a slower cooker recipe, simply follow the sauce directions.  Layer 6-12 oz fresh shitake and button mushrooms, chicken breasts, then sauce in the slow cooker.  Cook on low for 5 hours.  Serve over rice or pasta.  Enjoy!

MMMMMMMMM, I just got done licking my plate!  I made this recipe tonight for dinner and it was AWESOME!!!  I followed the advice of the other reviews and doubled the sauce recipe, but did not double the amount of italian dressing.  Instead of baking the chicken breasts, I just used 3 chicken breasts, cut into pieces and sauteed with some fresh mushrooms.  I threw the cooked chicken pieces in with the rest of the sauce and served it over the angel hair pasta.  In order to cut some of the fat in this recipe, I used lite cream cheese and only 2 tbsp of butter instead of the 1/4 cup.  Also to the sauce, I added about 1/2 cup of sliced olives and a small jar of drained artichoke hearts.  It was sooooo good, very tasty, and not heavy and fattening.  Thank you so much for this recipe, it will now go in my special book of favorite recipes!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it for just about everybody and the responses have been great!  The only thing I would suggest is doubling the sauce because it doesn't make very much to spoon over the chicken and pasta.

I highly recommend this recipe.  I used four chicken breasts instead of six, and had plenty of sauce for this amount.  Be sure to buy the Condensed Golden Mushroom Soup and not Cream of Mushroom.  Campbell's makes the Golden -- it just took some searching for it. I used Philly's soft cream cheese with chives and onions and it worked just fine.  I also recommend using a good white wine. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I cooked it the first time by following recipe. The second time I made it for company. I added extra mushrooms, and sprinkled the top with parsley & parmesean cheese. Served it over the top of whole wheat linguine (which I tossed in olive oil and a little chunk of butter). Also served it with a tossed salad and some asiago cheese bread. Company loved it. Definite keeper!

This recipe tasted like I went out for dinner....the sauce is excellent...I added more wine and sauted mushrooms.....family loved this....I used thin spaghetti the first night and we had the leftovers over white rice.  I also cut my chicken into strips and sauted in olive oil and garlic. I add the cooked chicken and mushrooms to the sauce and poured that over the spaghetti...I like it better this way....this is a complete meal with a salad....great recipe!!

I make this ALL the time! It is my FAVORITE recipe!! Except I always throw it in the crockpot, and add to the pasta when its done. 3-4 hours on high, 5-7 hours on low. It always comes out perfect! I use chicken broth instead of white wine, I think it gives a nice flavor. You do not need to use golden mushroom soup- regular cream of mushroom actually tastes better, and is easier to find. Reheats beautifully. SUPER yummy!!

This recipe is okay as written.  But with tweaking it can be great.  The first time I made this I grilled the chicken, prepared the sauce in a saucepan simmering for about 15 minutes and left out the wine and added 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  I served the sauce over 1/2 lb penne pasta with the chicken chopped.  I found the sauce to be a little too salty (and I like salt!) The second time I made this I was making it for a family of 5 that I cook for so I decided to change the recipe up a little more to try and improve upon it, first I used 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, 4 ounces regular cream cheese, 4 ounces chive and onion cream cheese, 1 cup milk, two cans of the soup and only one packet of the Italian salad dressing mix.  The consistency and saltiness were much improved!  I served the sauce over 1 lb penne pasta with cooked shrimp.  It received rave reviews and I was asked for the recipe!  Thanks!

The white wine is a must! A lot of reviewers state they replace it with chicken broth- don't. The wine keeps the "processed" food flavor in check; without the wine the sauce tastes like something that you made with can of soup, which you did, but don't really need anyone to know that. Double the sauce ingrediants, except the italian dry mix. Very good with the white wine, poor with chicken broth substitute.

Tried and true, for years this has been one of the best recipes I’ve found on this site. It is sooo easy and incredibly tasty! Plus it passes the “picky eaters” test – even kids like it. When you feel that the sauce needs a little extra kick lemon pepper seasoning will do it. Definitely double the sauce as everyone fights over it otherwise.

I love this recipe!!!  I make this using the crockpot, about 5-6 hours on low.  I prepare everything the night before and refrigerate and then come home at lunch to put it on.  By dinner time it's AWESOME!!  I serve this with rice, wide egg noodles or angel hair.  YUMMY!!

This is gross!  I wouldn't serve it to my dog, much less dinner guests.  It is way too salty and the colder it gets on your plate, the worse it is. Do not attempt to try this.

Oh my! What a delicious dish for something different! Hubby and I were impressed!  I took others' advice and doubled the sauce by adding an entire can of chicken broth (as a substitute for the wine), fresh mushrooms, 8 oz of reduced fat chives and onion cream cheese, and a little extra butter.  We had plenty of sauce leftover.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was tender served over the pasta with the delicious sauce. I think next time I may try using chicken breast strips rather than whole breasts.  Easy, easy, and no one would know it.  We had salad with Italian dressing and garlic rolls with it.  This is a new household favorite, and will be the next meal I make for company.:-)

I have been using this recipe since '02 and it is still a hit! I always add sliced mushrooms and extra wine (always double the recipe to increase the amount of sauce to pour on pasta), then to make it really pretty, top it with sliced green onions and chopped tomato, side with some homemade garlic bread. Delicious! Still one of my favorite recipes off this site after all these years!

I've made this recipe 3 times in the last 6 months and have gotten thumbs up from my family each time. I grilled the chicken off on my indoor grill and cooked it on top of the stove. I've used regular mushroom soup instead of the golden. My wife gave me the best compliment one can get. I took her out for her birthday and she ordered lobster spaghetti. After a few bites I asked her how she liked it and she said "It's ok, but it would even be better if they used your recipe for the Angel Chicken Pasta sauce." So with that in mind I made it last night and used shrimp instead of chicken. It turned out excelent and my wife is still telling me how good it was.

This was very good. My food-snob Italian husband even liked it. i doubled the sauce and made it in the crockpot with thin strips of chicken. I added 8oz. sliced mushrooms and 1 drained and squeezed can of artichokes in water. It doesn't need garlic salt. Use 1/2 tsp of garlic pwder instead or it will be too salty. I couldn't find onion and chive cream cheese so i added 2T minced onion and 1/4 c chopped chives. We served it over angel hair pasta with grated romano and chopped fresh parsley on the side. We made a garden salad and Zucchini Puffs apps from this site and had garlic bread as well. It was a restaurant quality dinner.

Wow this is good!  You can use any type of pasta you prefer.  I've done with both penne and rigatoni and it was good with both.  I substituted dry sherry since we are not white wine drinkers.  I used neufacthel cream cheese to cut some fat and reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp.  I cut my boneless breasts into bite size pieces before adding to sauce mixture and also added some chopped fresh mushrooms.  I like to do this in a dutch oven.  Once the sauce is cooked, I mix in the cooked penne and sprinkle with some grated parmesan.  I found this to be enough sauce for a full box of penne (1 lb.)  It is fantastic!

WOW!  Is the response I got from my husband when I made this.  He is not one to like eating the same things over and over again, but he said this would certainly be an exception!  I have made this twice, and it just seems to get better every time.  Add mushrooms to the recipe for something really special!

I have been using Allrecipes for years, but this is the first time I've ever written a review.  This recipe is fantabulous!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly except that I tripled the sauce to the same amount of meat, because several reviewers recommended doubling it, plus I wanted to have extra seperate from the chicken for the vegetarians in the family.  The only complaint is that there weren't any leftovers!  Definitely a five star dish as is! The reason I am rating/reviewing now is because I have now adapted the recipe and it is still amazing.  When I'm in a rush I use ground chicken or turkey and simply brown and add to the sauce mixture (like a traditional meat sauce).  I've substituted broth for the wine when necessary (though the wine is MUCH better) and cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, or cream of celery for the soup.  While each substitution has changed the flavor some, the dish is still a hit.  I now keep Italian style dressing mix in my cupboard, just so this recipe can be a staple or fall back quickie dinner in our house.  The only recommendation I would make is to always add sauted onions and mushrooms to the dish no matter what.   Definitely a keeper whether made as is or with substitutions based on your families tastes!!! Five stars all the way!

Followed the recipe exactly as given (with the exception of substituting cream of chicken for mushroom soup due to food allergies)... Pros: This is very easy/inexpensive to make with minimal mess/clean-up, the chicken comes out very juicy and the sauce has a great flavor and texture.  It goes great with the angel-hair pasta. Cons: The next time I make it I am going to cut back on the butter...probably by a third.  There was just too much butter in the sauce.  When it was ready to serve there were little slicks of butter that didn't blend in with the sauce.  It is very easy for this dish to get overly-salty, so I suggest using the "healthy request" version (or some lower-sodium equivalent) of the soup.  I might also look for a lower-sodium version of the Italian soup mix next time.  It would probably be easy to also cut down on the fat content by using reduced fat cream cheese or Neufchâtel cheese and less butter.   This went over well with a very picky SO, so it is definitely a keeper!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it many times and changed it many times for fun.  My favorite variation: First saute 8-16 ounces of mushrooms. Cut chicken breasts into fourths. Mix into the sauce and bake in a lasagne dish uncovered for about 30-35 minutes.  Stir halfway, since chicken lets out juices.  Serve with penne pasta and roasted asparagus.  YUM!

Amazing, and i'm not always big on cream sauces. i took the advice of others and doubled the sauce, but not the seasoning packet to avoid saltyness. However, i did add more garlic and parsley so that i wasn't missing out on flavor (from not doubling the seasoning packet.) I added a bunch of sliced fresh mushrooms to the sauce before putting it in the oven as well because my roommates and i are mushroom lovers! -plenty- of sauce ended up being left over, maybe next time i'll 1 1/2 it instead of double. :) thanks Marian!

Too perfect!! I'm usually not a fan of cream cheese and italian dressing, but this was perfect! Perfectly tender, and the small pasta helped spread the flavour! I'm making it again, as I speak!

Delicious!  I've made it several times, even for company.  I used six boneless breasts and doubled everything else (except the Italian dressing mix) for lots of sauce, then cooked it in a 9x13 stoneware dish for almost 2 hours...talk about tender and yummy!  We are not salt people so I was afraid of the saltiness of the recipe but it was fine for us.  Our company loved it and went home with the recipe.  Quick, easy and delicious!

I have made this about 3 times now.  The first time I used regular condensed mushroom soup and spaghetti noodles and regular italian dressing mix--it turned out okay.  The second time I used the golden mushroom soup and fettucini noodles and mild italian dressing mix--AWESOME.  I can't believe the difference it made.  I think the change in soup made the biggest difference.  I am making this on Mother's Day for 11 people, if that tells you anything!!!!!

This recipe also works well with left-over chicken. I made the sauce (doubled), made a pound of mostaccioli rigatti,cooked al dente, and tossed the works together in a 13x9 glass pan (sprayed). Baked it at 350 for 35 minutes with a dusting of parmesan on top and it was great.

This dish was full of flavor! You MUST use a GOOD bottle of white (I used Chardonnay) wine. I believe that the failed attempts on here was due to the type of wine they used. I seared my chicken breasts (8 total) in very little olive oil, garlic and scallions. Placed them in my crock pot on low, then I heated 1/2 cup of butter in the same pan that I used for the chicken, added (1 pkg. .9 oz of Country Itailian Style mix), slowly added 1-1/2 cups of Chardonnay and stirred until smooth, added 3 cans (10.75 oz each) of the "Golden Mushroom Soup" (do not substitute!) mixed well then slowly added 8 oz. of cream cheese with chives (continue stirring over medium heat), then another 4 ozs of regular cream cheese to that (continue to stir until smooth).  Sauce was extremely thick so I added 2 dollops of sour cream to thin out a bit, heated through then poured over the chicken breasts in my crock pot.  Cooked on low 5-6 hours (chicken was moist and shredded easily), then I sauted 8 ozs. of fresh mushrooms and added to the crockpot the last 15 minutes as I cooked the angel hair pasta.  Served over pasta with asparagus on the side (or mixed in) and garlic bread.  Very rich and very good.  My husband (loves thick sauces), as this is extremely thick, and my 7 year old LOVED it! My 12 year old tasted it (has no choice) and hated it!  (He's going through a phase!) and I thought it was very good.  I would definitely make again, but personally thin it out with some cream.  Very rich!

Love it!  We mix together the sauce ingredients on the stove top, then pour them over the chicken breasts in the crock pot.  Cooked on low for 4 hours, the chicken is as tender as can be!

Scrumptious and lick the plate worthy. I only used 4 chicken breasts, plain cream cheese, fresh chives and spaghetti instead of angel hair but otherwise I made the recipe as is. The sauce alone is worth 5 stars. It'd be good by itself over pasta or rice. 

I made this with the green beans and pancetta recipe on this site and some of the pancetta and shallots got mixed in with the pasta and sauce. It was so good and gave me the idea to make this again by sauteeing shallots and pancetta first before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I'm also going to try it over linguine. Again, the chicken is not even necessary! DELICIOUSNESS x100.

Loved it!  I doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the seasoning, and added a small can of mushrooms on top.  Used chicken broth instead of wine.  You should most definately double the sauce!!  I also cut each breast into 4 big chunks to ensure it cooks through, and is easier to serve.  It's amazing leftover too..the sauce thickens.  I agree with another reviewer that said she wants to drink the sauce!  I freakin' love this recipe!

This is the BOMB!!!!! Restaurant quality for sure.  Used this exactly as written, but with only 3 chicken breast.  Wouldn't change a thing. If using 6 breast double the sauce. Broccoli as side.

This is a great tasting recipe! I added sauteed fresh garlic, green onions, and mushrooms. For the sauce I doubled the cream chesse (used plain), 3/4 cup of white wine, 3/4 cup of chicken broth, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, and 1 package of the dry Italian dressing.

Served over angel hair pasta with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Yummy!

Tastes good, but I'm glad I followed the advice of others, especially reducing the salt!  Suggestions I found helpful: 1) double the sauce, but DON'T double the dressing mix.  2) My family & I don't love the taste of wine, so I added only 1/4 cup, and used 3/4 cup milk plus a bit of water.  3) Adding mushrooms and maybe some red/green peppers would give it a 'fresher' taste  4) I think I will try this again, minus the cream cheese, but with more milk to make it healthier, less rich 5) Use margarine instead of butter, reduce the amount by maybe even half 6) I barely salted the pasta, which really helped reduce the saltiness of the recipe.  7) Reduce the baking time to about 30 minutes at 400*, cut chicken breasts in half or even strips.  Recipe worth trying again to get it right!  Thank you, Marian!

Sorry to go against the grain on this one,but I followed the recipe exactly and we did not like it at all. The chicken was tender so I guess that was okay. We really did not care for the flavor of the sauce. The ingredients were somewhat random and did not create a harmonious flavor. I actually didn't feel well after eating this. Sorry.

This was very good. Definitely a keeper. I am making it for the second time tomorrow to take to work. Someone said that they would double the sauce next time and i agree. Also I made it on the stove instead of in the oven (it takes alot less time this way)using frozen chicken breasts I just browned them from the frozen state and added all ingredients once the chicken was lightly browned. It does not take long, for the chicken to cook though... just keep covered after the browning process. This time I am going to add fresh sliced mushrooms and some garlic. You could also cut the meat or slice it into pieces if you would like rather than have a whole piece for each serving. It was great.. thanks to the creator! !

I will make this again, but I will use half the Italian salad seasoning, and up the cream cheese with chives to 6 to 8 ounces, and I may add some milk or half and half, as well. I thought I had read enough reviews, but I'll go back and read some more and see what other changes I can make to lighten this up a bit.

The only change I made was to use a sweet wine instead of white wine. I used a moscato. Gives the sauce a hint of sweetness. I also used cream of chicken instead of mushroom

I made this last night and we really loved it.  I did replace the golden mushroom soup with regular (reduced fat) mushroom soup and I will do that again next time as well.  Also covered the pan after the first 15 minutes or so as the top was crusting without a cover.  Pulled it off towards the end and stirred everything up.  This was creamy and wonderful and the chicken fell apart.  Also, I used three half chicken breasts as there were only two of us, but left the sauce ingredients the same.  Plenty for the two of us and leftovers to reheat tomorrow night.  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome dish.  To save time, melt the butter in a saucepan then add the seasoning, soup and wine or stock on low heat while you are boiling your pasta.  Use a whole rotisserie chicken and pull off the chicken meat in bite-sized pieces and set aside.  When the noodles are almost finished, stir in the cream cheese into your sauce and melt down until smooth.  Toss the sauce, chicken (& mushrooms if desired--small can) with the noodles and serve.  Good with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese!

I have made this recipe too many times to count!  Take it from a mom of six kiddos that this is a crowd pleaser!!  I do make a couple very minor adjustments to make this easier for me.  First, I keep the same amount of chicken breast halves, but triple the sauce. I cube the chicken and sautee in a bit of olive oil.  While the chicken is cooking, I make the sauce as written except for a triple batch I only use 2 packets of the italian dressing mix.  When the sauce and the chicken is almost cooked through I pour the sauce over the chicken and simmer on low for 20-30 minutes and the chicken will be very tender.  I layer on a very big platter with the angel hair on the bottom, steamed chopped broccoli in the middle, and the chicken mixture poured over the top.  This recipe is fantastic!!  I'll try with the crockpot next time.  Thanks Marion for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe for a working mom. I make the sauce the night before and put it in the fridge. Then I cut up the chicken into chunks (more toddler friendly and cooks faster) and sprinkle w/ poultry seasoning. Then when I get home I sautee the chicken and then pour the sauce in and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. While that's going I cook the pasta. (I serve it over penne pasta which is easier for little fingers to pick up.) My husband LOVES this recipe, as does my toddler.

I really liked this! I accidently added double the amount of cream cheese called for in the recipe, but followed everything else to the letter. 
The sauce is rich and decadent, but was too thick and would have been even if I hadn't doubled the cc. 

Next time.... 1) I will double the sauce ingredients except for the butter and italian dressing mix. 

2) Use low fat cream cheese (Neufchatel) and add fresh chives. 

3) Cube and fry the chicken in the butter and italian dressing mix adding 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms the last couple minutes of cooking time.

4) After the chicken is cooked I'll stir in the rest of the sauce ingredients and heat through on the stovetop as opposed to the oven. Baking in my opinion is a time consuming, extra dish dirtying unnecessary step. This way everything will be limited to one pot. Easier cleanup and alot faster too! 

My family and I also didn't care for the angel hair pasta. It didn't "fit" this dish. Egg noodles or rice would be much better suited for the sauce.

Excellent.  At first, I follewed the recipe exactly, but after the sauce was heated and ready to pour over the chicken, I tasted it and thought the wine flavor was too strong.  To dilute it a bit, I added 1/2 can of regular cream of mushroom soup, another 2 oz. of cream cheese, a little Italian seasoning (maybe a teaspoon), another tablespoon of butter, and about 1/3 cup of chicken broth.  Also, the only cream cheese I could find with chives was cream cheese with onion and chives, that seemed to work just fine.  I also decided to cut the chicken breasts into into large strips instead of keeping them whole.  Served it with an Italian-style salad.  The result was absolutely fantastic!  My wife and I couldn't believe how good it was.  I will make it many more times.

This was a tasty dish.  The kids & I liked it, hubby well...he's not fond of "cream of chicken sauces" to begin with, so he had plain noodles with the chicken.  My 11 year old son said "that was REALLY good" as he took the last bite.  I used cream of chicken soup because my daughter doesn't like mushrooms I think that I will use bowtie pasta next time & broth vs. the wine (I tasted sweetness from the wine).  I also didn't pick up on any overly saltiness, I used good seasons Italian dressing mix.  Thanks Marian!

Fabulous Recipe.  We did not find it salty at all.
I sauteed green onions and mushrooms in the butter before adding rest of ingredients. Poured over chicken cutlets and only bake for 35-40 minutes as cutlets are thin.

This was just okay.  I doubt I'll be making it the same way again.  I didn't use a crock pot, like so many other reviews, I just did it the way the recipe calls for.  The sauce tasted amazing before I added it to the chicken.  Once I cooked it, the moisture from the chicken diluted the sauce and it didn't taste very good.  I would like to try this in a crock pot, but I think the same thing will happen.  If I make this again, it'll be just the noodles and sauce.  I'll cook the chicken  separately.

I just tried this recipe and served it to my parents yesterday.  They loved it.  My dad actually asked for a soup spoon so he would not waste any of the delicious sauce! The recipe gets bonus points for being so easy and quick to put together. Since it was my first try, I followed the recipe, except I used fettuccine noodles instead of angel hair.  I'm sure it wouldn't matter what noodles you used, it would still be great.  I don't think this recipe needs much tweaking.  It's hard to go wrong with a dish that calls for a half-stick of butter and cream cheese!

I'll give it 4 stars for flavor as it's quite good but must deduct one for the fact that the sauce barely covers one plateful of pasta, nevermind a 9x13 pan. The sauce should at least be doubled, if not tripled.

I put the chicken, dressing mix, wine, cream of mushroom, and cream cheese into the crock pot on low for about 5-6 hours. About 4 hours in to it, lifted the lid and stirred it with a fork. The chicken came apart and shredded, so the sauce mixed in well and gave it LOTS of flavor! Put it atop the pasta. Delicious and hassle free!!!

This was very well received by both my picky 9 year old and my husband.  My little one actually finished her dinner before anyone else which is an amazing thing in our house :-)  I did use chicken broth (about 10 oz.) instead of the wine only because I had no dry white in the house.  I will be putting this in the "family favorites" and will be making this again.

I was only making for 2 so I only used 2 chicken breasts instead of 6.  Except for the butter I did not reduce the sauce portion ingredients however because I wanted enough to serve with pasta. I did reduced the butter to 2 tsps as I found the extra butter is not needed to make this sauce rich in taste. Make sure your Italian dressing mix is fresh or it can impart a stale taste that isn't very pleasant. I also used half wine half chicken broth for the liquid and ended up thinning this with a little more broth before pouring over cooked pasta. Use unsalted butter and low sodium soup to counter the saltiness of the dressing mix and you can get away with using lite cream cheese to cut some of the fat, the recipe will not suffer.   I initially browned the cubed chicken breasts in the 2 tsp butter then reserved them while I made the sauce in the same pan and added cut broccoli and some chopped red pepper a couple minutes before serving. When the sauce was done I added the chicken back in and then tossed the whole lot with 2 servings of cooked pasta.   Enjoyed this very much and will make again.

After making this recipe for over 2 years, it's time to give credit where it's due. First of all, the creative combination blends very well. Second, when you don't have everything on hand, this is also versatile. I've subbed a bottle of italian for the seasoning packet and wine before; I usually don't have chive cream cheese on hand and reg. cr. cheese works fine, I just add some onion powder and dried chives although I'm not sure it's necessary; I have also made this with regular cr. of mushroom (golden IS better though); I typically use chicken broth instead of wine without really any difference in flavor. However much you want to switch things around to your liking, it still comes out great--but it still deserves 5 stars as is. Thanks for sharing!

Seriously??? It doesn't get any easier and tastier. I make this for guests all the time and everyone loves it.  I did make some changes.  I do 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. wine, 1/2 c. chicken broth, 2 cans condensed golden mushroom soup, 8 ounces cream cheese.  I have made this in the oven using chicken tenders (I think about a pound.  I almost always cut my chicken breasts into chunks put it in the slow cooker do the soup as the recipe calls for, pour it over the CB and then set my slow cooker for 8 hours slow.  LOVE IT!

I am giving this 5 Stars, as I never would have thought of combining these ingredients for the sauce.  We loved the sauce.  That said, I think it needs a more full-bodied pasta than the angel hair. Fettuccini works well. I have made this recipe twice. The first time, it was delicious, but needed more sauce.  The second time,  I sliced four chicken breasts into 4 slices (like fingers),added mushrooms and chopped broccoli and attempted to thin down the sauce with 1/2 cup skim milk. The "thinning down" took away from the flavor of the sauce, so next time I will double the sauce instead of thinning it down.  Of course, this will also double the calories, so this will be an "occasional meal".  All in all, I am pleased with this recipe, but tweaking it a bit. It is a keeper. I can see myself making this a third and a fourth time. It was truly good!

This is delicious! I only used 3 chicken breasts and browned them first. I did'nt double the sauce and it was plenty with only the 3 breasts. Used about 3/4 of the Italian Seasoning and cream of mushroom instead of golden. Also cut the white wine with chicken broth (1/4 cup of each). The sauce seemed too thick so added a little milk, don't add too much though, just a splash because as it cooks in the oven the juices from the chicken will really thin the sauce out. I used feticinni (I know that isn't spelled right!) instead of angel hair. You could cube the chicken, that would be good also. The whole family just LOVED this!!! Definately a keeper! Yummy!!!

This was wonderful! The changes I made were: I doubled the golden mushroom soup, the cream cheese and the wine. I agree with other reviewers, to use a whole envelope of italian dressing you really have to double the other sauce ingredients. I also believe it is necessary to double the sauce ingredients anyway. I cut the chicken breasts into bite size pieces after baking and I served it with fettucini noodles. OH...and I put an 8 oz pkg of sliced mushrooms over the ckn breasts and then topped it all with the sauce for baking. Delish!

I found this really tasty and easy to make. I used 4 chicken breasts(cut into bite size pieces) instead of six and kept the ingredients for the sauce the same. My husband thought the sauce was a little rich, but he enjoyed the taste of the chicken. We had it over angel hair pasta. I will make this again.

Well, I'm altering my review.  I got courageous and tried this again (I liked it the first time - a couple of years ago-, but my hubby & kids didn't).  Anyway, I made this last night for my in-laws, and EVERYONE raved over it!  I doubled the sauce and added a little milk to thin the sauce just a bit.  My mother-in-law requested the recipe.  My father-in-law had thirds!  My son ate & ate!  Hubby took left-overs for lunch today.  To make it a little healthier, I used low fat cream cheese, and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  It's back in the rotation!

This was a big hit in my house! I cubed my chicken and fried in pan with 1/2cup butter since I was doubling the sauce. Used 3/4 package dressing mix. Added it gradually so it wouldn't be too salty.Used 1 can golden mushroom and 1 can regular cream of mushroom soup. Omitted the wine and used 8 oz pkg. reg.cream cheese(no chives). Cooked it all in same pan with chicken. No baking.Really good and so easy. Thanks Marian!

This is now one of our favorate dinners!  I tried to reduce the calories a bit, so I used light cream cheese and fat free mushroom soup.  Next time I'm going to reduce the butter.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms, very yummy!  I only used 3 pcs of chicken and there was just enough sauce.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I thought this was great! I made it a bit low fat by switching butter to olive oil and only using half the amount.  I also used a low-fat chive cream cheese spread.  I mixed the sauce in with the pasta to keep it from sticking.  Only problem:  it could have used more sauce.

This was delicious!!! It was so easy to make and my in-laws asked me why I went to so much trouble!  They loved it and my husband loved the sauce.  Even my picky teenager liked it.  I doubled the sauce and next time I will triple the sauce because it was not enough for 1 lb. of spaghetti.  I used 1/2 pkg. of dressing mix and it was not salty at all and I added minced garlic to the butter and sauteed.  Great recipe!

Tasted great! Thank you for the recipe. I made it exactly as directed. Next time, I think I'll add about a cup of milk to the sauce though. We prefer a less thick sauce. I'll also add a package of fresh white button sliced mushrooms too. I will also try adding 2 packages of the dry italian seasoning mix because we prefer a zestier& stronger flavor.

Super yummy dish. This was perfect as written except for making more of this superb tasting sauce as others have also suggested. Chicken tenderloins were used and they came out extremely moist and tender. I think the condensed golden mushroom soup really complements this dish. I wish we had doubled the recipe as there was little leftover. This will definitely become a repeat dish. Marian, on this one, you rock girl!

Not so great.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  So I can fairly rate this.  The chicken was dry I think 1 hour is too long.  The sauce tasted like condensed soup with italian seasoning, the pasta was heavy because of the sauce.  I think with the other ideas in the reviews this recipe could be saved but as it is I wouldn't make it again.  I really think recipes should be reviewed as they are written.  If you are changing it you can't fairly rate it.

Everyone gobbled it up and asked for more! Made my own dry Italian dressing mix and now know to absolutely skip the salt in it. There was plenty in the soup. A definite keeper!

I made according to directions, and we all thought the dish was bland. Not BAD, just sort of boring, and the seasonings didn't seem like they went together very well. A couple sprinkles of grated parmesan cheese at the table spiffed it up all right, but I think I'd make something else next time. Sorry.

This was definitely good.  My hubby is not a fan of cream cheese in general, but I used the regular 1/3 less fat kind.  Since other reviews said it was kind of salty, I only used about half of the Italian seasoning packet and the only other change I made was to use cream of chicken and I just put everything in the crockpot, making sure to stir it all together as it melted and spooned it over the chicken breasts (which were frozen).  It was done in 4 hrs on low.  Thanks for another easy and good recipe!

I.Love.This!!!  I highly recommend doubling the sauce, with the exception of the Italian dressing (I use a whole pack and a little less than half of a second - too salty if I use 2 whole packs).  I've made with both white wine, and with a chicken broth substituted for the wine, and either way is magnificent.  Easy meal that my entire family loves, and I've recommended it to several people.  And don't sweat it if you can't find cream cheese with chives; I've made it with regular cream cheese and the taste was still delicious.

Yum. I used the italian dressing mix recipe from this site instead of the packet (but omitted the salt). I also sauteed a package of fresh mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic before making the rest of the sauce. Served over whole wheat couscous instead of the angel hair. Thanks for the recipe:)

Dont be fooled by the 4 and one half stars nor be fooled by the number of reviews.    Tried this recipe the other night, following the exact recipe.  Tasted like school cafeteria lunch.  Had an artificial flavor and was super thick and pasty.  Me and my family were very disappointed.

Make this in the slow cooker!  It's so easy and good.  No need to melt everything together first, just throw all the ingredients in the crock pot and whisk till smooth, throw in chicken and cook on low for 4-5 hours.  I have even cooked the spaghetti ahead of time and mixed it in at the end and let it warm back up.  My kids love this.

This was delicious.  Our 3 year old even liked it.  I reduced the butter by 1/2, added fresh mushrooms into the butter and seasoning mix then added 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of dry white wine.  I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it worked well too.  I seasoned the chicken with a little lemon pepper and thyme, cut into strips and baked at 340 for 45 minutes.   I steamed some chopped broccoli to put on top.  I used whole wheat pasta as well.  We will make this again! Yum!

In a hurry, I picked up two rotisserie chickens at the grocery and just made a double batch of the sauce and stirred in the shredded chicken.  Served over Penne.  

I used whipped cream cheese and fully let it come to room temp so it blended pretty quickly.  Took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.  Quite good.  I would consider giving it 5 stars if the recipe was from scratch instead of using the mushroom soup/italian seasoning but it certainly is quick and tasty.

3 stars for now.  I used half the chicken as we are a family of 3, used half the butter (I used margarine) but kept the rest of the sauce the same.  I actually thought the sauce was a bit bland and was really surprised!  Some reviews thought it was too salty..perhaps they used cooking wine instead of just wine (I am totally not a wine fan but used it and there was no wine flavor in the finished dish so don't be afraid to use it).  Maybe it was their dressing mix (I used the regular Italian Good Seasons) Maybe next time I will use another packet of Italian seasoning and hope it won't overkill..and maybe the whole 8oz container of cream cheese instead of just half, I'll have to play around with it because there is potential!

This was just ok.  Not spectacular and that is why it is getting 3 stars.  I had high hopes for it with such great reviews.

Added 1C chopped Mushroom, 2 cloves Garlic, a frozen bag of 3 pepper & onion blend, upped the wine to 1C, and used a full 8oz of Cream Cheese. Sauteed the Mushrooms, veggies, Garlic & Chicken for a few minutes before add the rest of the ingrd's and then stuck it in the oven until the noodles were ready. Seriously - this was heaven on a plate!

My husband and my picky 3 year old loved it - wine and all!  A few things I will experiment with next time... cutting up the chicken into bite size pieces and pan searing it with some salt and pepper (or other spices) before baking together to give the chicken some flavor.   We liked it with angel hair pasta but will likely double the sauce.  As for veggie add ins to try, I'm thinking mushrooms, red pepper, chopped fresh spinach, zucchini.  It's a fantastic recipe just as is. I was a shade shy of a full 1/2 cup wine so I added a bit of chicken broth to top it off.  The taste with the wine and golden mushroom soup is what sets this recipe apart, so for all the people who sub the wine entirely with broth and use a different type of soup, that completely changes the flavor of the recipe - keep that in mind when reading the reviews with changes others have made.  Granted it likely still tastes very good, it is not the same as this recipe. IMHO, stick to the recipe first, it's great as is - then change as you see fit.

I NEVER leave bad reviews, but I'm just amazed that this one got so many good ones.  I know how to cook...this wasn't a case of someone who doesn't know what their doing just messing up a recipe.  The ingredients are good together...I'm SO going to try making the sauce and stuffing mushrooms with it, but this sauce is so incredibily thick and rich it made it hard to take bites of the pasta.  I think the concept is good, but next time I am going to add 1/2 a can of water or chicken stock to the recipe and maybe make it with penne to hold all the sauce.  I really wanted this to be good, but it just wasn't a recipe for me!

I've made this a couple of times now and I finally figured out the way our family likes it best. 

We prefer cream of mushroom soup over the golden mushroom (and I don't usually like recipes with cream of mushroom). I used a 13oz package of whole wheat spaghetti, liked it much better than the angel hair. I also add a little extra unsalted butter (not much), and I use the whole 8oz tub of cream cheese with chives. 

A couple of things, the cream cheese should be room temp when you mix in. Also, I tried using reduced fat cream cheese and it really wasn't as good; sometimes you can't notice, but this isn't one of those dishes. Go all out and enjoy!!!!

This recipe is fabulous!  First time I made it, I followed it to the letter.  It was very tasty and my husband said we could add this to our regular meal rotation.  The next time I made it, I substituted cream of chicken for the mushroom soup(family has a thing about mushrooms) and I also added a second envelope of the Italian dressing, this time zesty Italian (so now I had one regular and one zesty).  I also replaced the angel hair with penne pasta.  The flavor just jumped right off the plate and now my husband has moved this recipe to the top of our list!

YUMM-O!!  I so loved this dish.  I read other reviews before preparing, and decided to go with linguine instead of angel hair....I am glad I did, because the angel hair would not be a substantial enough pasta for this wonderful sauce!  I didn't think it was to salty at all...It was just fantastic.

I cooked this for my family this evening and they all enjoyed it. I thought it was wonderful,especially for being so easy! I will surely serve this again. Next time I will definately pound the meat beforehand, and maybe flour is lightly and sautee it in some light olive oil first.

This was a really good recipe...I had to improvise though as I was missing certain ingredients.  I used a precooked 3lb chicken--deboning it.  I chopped some white onion and sauteed it in 2 tbsp of butter.  Then added 4 oz of plain cream cheese, italian seasoning, and the wine.  I used cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of milk.  Instead of angel hair pasta I used 12 oz of bowtie. I combined the meat and pasta and then poured the sauce over everything.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes and added 3/4 cup shredded mozzerella cheese over the top in the last five minutes.   VERY yummy and not salty.

So good!  I used Piesporter (my favorite white wine).  This recipe is so easy.  The chicken was juicy and tender.  I only used four pieces and I thought it was the perfect number for the amount of sauce.  Anymore chicken and the recipe would have to be doubled.

Don't know if it was just us or the recipe but this just wasn't really for us. The chicken came out dry, the sauce was very bland and there was definitely not enough sauce for all the pasta so the pasta was very dry and flavorless as well. And I even added some milk to the sauce after removing the chicken to try and thin it out some. Oh well, I guess some things just aren't for everyone.

Oh my, this was tasty!  My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it.  I took others' suggestions and sauteed my chicken with some garlic and onion powder before baking.  I also cut my chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking and added fresh mushrooms and diced red onion to the sauce. I also doubled the sauce as others suggested since we like our pasta dishes saucy.  This is defintely restaurant quality!

I followed this recipe to an absolute tee.  There are good points and bad points to this recipe. The good news is the fact that this is so easy to prepare and tastes delicious.  The bad news is the fact that there is hardly enough sauce for 3 people, let alone 6 like the recipe states. So, you make a whole package of pasta only to use a quarter of it. I was a little nervous to even put the sauce on the pasta because it had cooked down so much that it appeared that the only thing left was a pool of butter over the chicken.  I love butter but this seemed like an overkill.  Once I spooned some sauce over the pasta, I tasted what all the fuss is about.  It's a delicious pasta/chicken dish.  I just don't know if a whole stick of butter is necessary.  If I ever prepare this again, I would cut the butter significantly and add a healthier component.  I love fatty foods but this dish, once out of the oven, made me cringe a little.

OMG! ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!  After reading other reviews I too doubled the sauce and was glad I did.  My whole family LOVED it. Even my oldest son who is so picky. He looked up after his first bite and said "Guess what, I have a new Favorite dish Mom" Would definetly make again and again. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, only I sliced the chicken breasts before baking. My husband raved about how great he thought it was. He said that it was the best chicken pasta I've ever made. I enjoyed it as well. There are defintely some strong flavors in this recipe, but they are very well matched. The only change I would make for next time would be to lightly saute' the chicken before baking it to make for a prettier presentation because the chicken has no color when served.

Although I am a definite food lover and very seldom dislike anything that I try, this dish was just average for me.  It was very easy to make and after completely preparing the dish, the flavor was just decent.  I was a bit hesitant as I was adding several of the ingredients, but made the dish exactly as the recipe stated.  The italian dressing packet and the wine made this dish, although the end result was a bit bland. I did as others suggested and cut the chicken breasts into strips to bake and I think that helped out with cooking time and gave the chicken more flavor than leaving them whole.  There is quite a bit of sauce, but I only prepared two chicken breasts and there was very little sauce left over after using it on the pasta for two of us.  I can't figure out if I did something wrong.  I think this dish is worth trying and I also think I'll give it another shot to see if there is something I can do to make it more flavorful next time around.

I made this last night and my husband and I both thought it was just ok.  I usually resist using recipes that call for ready-made ingredients such as dry dressing mix and canned soup because those products usually have such high salt content.  But with the "Hall of Fame" section of allrecipes.com giving it such high reviews, I was curious about the combination of ingredients that make up this sauce.  Not too salty as some reviewers said because allrecipes.com staff altered the quantity of the dry dressing mix originally called for.  We had enough sauce, but doubling it would allow one to be able to be more generous with it per serving.  I only used 4 chicken breasts, rather than 6. I won't make it again due to the sodium content in the pre-packaged ingredients and it certainly is not Hall of Fame worthy.

This recipe is definitely a keeper, even with a couple of changes.  First, I only used three large chicken breasts, but sliced them in half, like butterfly cuts, and there was plenty of chicken.  Also, I don't use wine or sherry in anything, so, to us, it was fine without it. I also used just plain cream cheese, but added about 1/4 tsp. onion granules, and just couldn't resist putting in 1/2 cup sour cream which really made the sauce creamy.  Even with my changes, we really enjoyed this dish.  One word though...don't over cook your angel hair or you will have a plate of "mushy stuff".

The first time I made this I thought it was yummy but my husband thought it was too heavy (probably due to the cream cheese).  The second time I made it, I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers, and it was still good.  I only used 1/8 cup butter, substituted light sour cream for the cream cheese, sprinkled in some chives and also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  I served it with brown rice, which was nice with the sauce too.  I'm still going to tweak the recipe.  Next time I'm going to substitute sherry for the white wine and see which one we prefer.

My first recipe to try from Allrecipies.com.  Wonderful!  My 4 year old also loves it. I've made it several times and notice that the wine I choose does change the flavor quite a bit.  A riesling is our favorite. Thanks!

I'm not sure what the big deal with this is- it certainly isn't the worst thing in the world, but I just don't get all the rave reviews.

I made this for my husband and his frien and they LOVED it.  I'm only 20 and new to cooking but it came out perfect.  Both men said it tasted like something from a nice restaurant and my husband was amazed.  He said I was really becoming a great cook.  I know he was proud of me and his friend started lamenting that he didn't have a wife like me, or any wife at all for that matter.  I will make this again and again especially when I want to impress. Thank you for this awesome recipe.

The recipe was okay.  A bit too salty for me. I will add 3/4 of the italian seasoning next time.  I substituted cheese ravioli for the pasta.  Recipe did not specify whether to bake covered or uncovered.

Great recipe! I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and made it on the stove. I would recommend frying the chicken in olive oil with garlic and onion, and then removing it. Then make the sauce in the pan. I also added mushrooms and broccoli cuts. The stovetop method is quicker. My husband absolutely LOVED it.

This was pretty good.  Wasn't "restaurant quality" like some of the reviewers said.  My 3-year-old didn't like it much, and my husband said it was "okay" which unusual for him.  He likes everything.  I liked it, but due to mixed reviews, not sure if we'll make it again.

Flavor was a bit pungent, but very nice. I combined the white wine and dressing mix and used as a marinade for the chicken a few hours prior, then poured the marinade into the mixture.

This was the first recipe I tried from Allrecipes.com (back in 05/01) and I have been making it ever since. I've made it for my family on a trip back to ND and they loved it also, they request I make it every time I visit. I have made it with the wine and substituted chicken broth or water for the wine and it comes out every time. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and add them to the sauce and serve over pasta. It also works well cook in a slow cooker.

This was really Yummy! I took a suggestion from Erin's review (7/10/2012) and made this on the stove in a deep skillet. I sprinkled them with just enough Italian Seasoning Mix (from this site by Debby) and saute'd until no longer pink. I deglazed the pan with the white wine and added the golden mushroom soup and cream cheese and then thinned out the sauce with chicken broth. I made this just with enough chicken for 2 but made sauce enough for 4 people to cover the pasta. This was awesome and will definitely make many more times. Thanks Marian (and the others).

11 people in my house for 12 days means we run out of dinner ideas quickly. I tried this recipe after reading everyone's oh-so-helpful reviews. Takeaways--faster cooking--I sliced my chicken into strips, placed it in a bowl, drizzled olive oil, Italian seasoning,  garlic and onion powder, and some old bay seasoning just for good measure. Stir fried the chicken on medium low while I pureed all the sauce ingredients (used chicken stock in lieu of white wine) in my Vitamix. Stir fried fresh broccoli in olive oil and dash of sea salt. Placed chicken in a 9x11 (since I doubled I used two pans), added broccoli and sliced mushrooms (not cooked--wanted the sauce to soak into them) and smothered them in the sauce. Cooked for 20 minutes at 325 while I boiled the pound of pasta.  I also doubled nearly everything so that it could feed more--we had a small portion leftover for the lucky soul who gets it tomorrow. Three hours later and people are still raving about it. Success! Thank you!

This recipe is the best! It is so easy.  I tweaked it a bit by adding Parmesan cheese, butter and garlic powder to the pasta after it was cooked.  I just tossed it up a bit prior to putting the chicken and sauce on it.  The sauce is so incredibly delicious! Fattening yes, but definitely a favorite which we will serve company, or just when we are bored. This is a very yummy recipe and completely different from anything I've ever made. Delish!

Loved it, super easy but I did use two cans of the golden mushroom soup,  I don't particularly like the mushroom slices in the soup so I cut them up really fine, still have the taste but don't have the big chunks of mushroom.  Also, shredding or dicing the chicken and mixing it with the sauce and pasta is more kid friendly.

I wouldn't say I loved it but I wouldn't say I hated it either. It was okay. Not sure if I would make it again though. It was still a bit salty even though I doubled the recipe with only one dressing packet.

This is a wonderful dish. I changed very little on this recipe, I used original cream cheese and I served over farfalle pasta. I ganished the dish with basil for presentation. The whole meal turned out awesome, from brushette to ceasar salad, and sreamed asparagus. I served my wife and my two boys(8 and 4) and they loved it too. Even though I changed the recipe a little, I've rated it as a 5 star dish, because of flavor and ease of prep\cook.

I sauteed a bunch of fresh mushrooms in butter and added those before baking, on top of the chicken and under the gooey sauce.  I thinned the sauce with a small can of chicken stock.  The minute the family walked through the door they all started oohing and aahing about the smells in my kitchen, and they dove into dinner with equally happy noises accompanying dinner's consumption.  It is a recipe winner that does not taste like "a packet of this and a can of that!"

First of all, I am stunned at how flippin good this is. I did not change a thing and used ALL ingredients as listed. Wait, I did use boneless skinless thighs(heck they were on a major sale). Anyway, I put everything in the slow cooker and to my surprise, perfection! Don't read the negative reviews. Put this in your slow cooker, have a glass of wine and enjoy the ooh's and ahh's from your family.

Oh my goodness!  This was absolutely amazing!  I have to admit I didn't have golden mushroom soup or cream cheese with chives so I used regular cream of mushroom soup and plain cream cheese.  I could have tossed in some dried chives but forgot.  I only had 1/4 cup of white wine, so I used 1/4 cup of chicken bullion too.  It smelled wonderful and tasted even better!  I only had five chicken breasts put it in a 7x10 pan and when it was done I cut up the chicken and left it soak while I cooked pasta.  I had to use shells, but pasta all tastes the same. :)  I cooked 8 servings and after the first two servings we just dumped the rest in the pot and stirred it together.  My incredibly picky son loved it, as did my husband and I!  I'll definitely make it again.  Next time, I'll try adding more mushrooms and broccoli (the picky son won't be here).  Seriously, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this.  Some reviewers have said it was too salty and I did when I tasted it, but the pasta evens that out.  All in all, this was a real keeper.  I didn't double the sauce, but I probably will next time because I believe you can't have enough of this sauce!  I can't say enough about it!  I'm going to have to keep the fixings on hand!

I followed everything to a T. very good. I need to make something quick for supper and I cut up the chicken breast in to quarter size pieces fried on the stove then added the remaining ingredients and let it simmer for about 1/2 hr. it was a little thick so I will add either sour cream or milk next time or maybe bake it when I have the time. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was aaaammmmazing!! I substituted chicken broth for the wine and used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  We also grilled the chicken instead of baking it all!  Yummy!

Very good! the only thing I would change would be to use just water and not chicken broth (subbed for wine). It was on the edge of being too salty.  I cut the butter in half. Next time I probably won't even use the butter.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I tried to half it for two people but there was not enough sauce. My suggestion would be to make the full amount of sauce no matter how many pieces of chicken you are using. I also used regular mushroom soup because I already had it on hand. I normally steer clear of recipes made with canned soup, but this one is really, really good.

This is a great recipe, however I made some substitutions because I was planning on feeding it to my children.  Instead of wine, I used water.  I also added 5 fresh cloves of garlic, chopped.  I reduced the amount of seasoning mix to taste.  I also used plain, reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup.  Very tasty and delicious!

Fairly good and not to complecated.  I thought it requested way to much pasta.  I could have done with half.  Great meal with some garlic bread sticks and salad.

I loved it.  The 8 yr old liked it, but the 7 yr old was eh about it and the 2 yr old ate it without complaint, which is a good sign.  Will add this to our list of go to dinners.  It was easy and tasty.  The only change I made was used Cream of Mushroom rather golden mushroom.

I have been making this for several years, but I use colossal shrimp and double (or triple) the sauce!  We are having it for Christmas dinner!!  Make the sauce in a large saute pan, then add the shrimp, heat til shrimp is done.  To serve I place the pasta on a large serving platter, then pour sauce with shrimp over the pasta.  It's wonderful with filet mignon, surf and turf.  Salad, bread...done!!  Not your typical Christmas dinner, but it's ready in no time and everyone loves it!!

This was pretty good. I did have to change it just a bit. I used chicken broth instead of wine, and since I didn't have cream cheese with chives I just used cream cheese and dried chives. Added garlic and onion powder. Doubled the sauce, and thinned it out with a little bit of half and half. When the chicken was almost done I topped each breast with some shredded mozzarella. Thanks for the recipe.

I hate to have to write this, especially since this recipe has such a great rating, but I did not care for this recipe.  I was hesitant to make this given the ingredients, and I'm sorry I didn't go with my gut feeling.  The flavor was not good at all, and the texture of the sauce was terrible.  It was so thick that it just made a clumpy mess of the spaghetti.  The flavor was artificial, like a processed meal from a box, the only thing you can taste is condensed soup.  
If you are used to eating from scratch, homemade meals you probably want to avoid this recipe.  This was a total miss for us.

Wonderful flavor! It could have used more sauce and the chicken was a bit overdone for our taste. Next time I will double the sauce and make in the crockpot as other reviewers suggested for tender chicken.

Great recipe! My husband and I liked this recipe very much.  I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the sauce recipe. But I only used a pack and half of the dry italian seasoning. I also used penne pasta instead.  This recipe is a keeper.  Next, I'm going to season my chicken a little bit but overall great recipe!

This is a good pasta recipe. However, there was not nearly enough sauce. It turned out like pasta with plain chicken thrown on top. Next time I will triple the amount of sauce.

Just so so... I followed exactly and it wasn't very good... the ratings were very misleading. It was a bit heavy and artificial tasting, I think it was the golden mushroom soup.

This had pretty good flavor.  I think it would be worth making simply because of how fast and easy it is (it goes faster if you just broil it and keep adding sauce... the sauce sticks better and it cooks faster this way).

This was a great dinner recipe. I bypassed baking and cooked chicken in a pan to make the process quicker. I added sun dried tomatoes into the sauce and a little lemon juice. I used italian seasoning (didn't have the dressing packet handy) then poured the sauce over the chicken and brought to a boil. Served over noodles. Yummy!

This was amazingly superb! Even my picky eater kids ate it.  I was a little worried about the different flavors of the Italian dressing mix, mixing with the white wine and the cream cheese and the soup all mixing together... and tasting good, but it did!!  I didn't have cream cheese with chives, just regular cream cheese and it turned out fabulous!  First time I 'baked' chicken breast that did NOT turn out dry!!  Will be making this again and again!!  :D

Another Keeper! Thank you Marian. This was so flavorful and very easy. If I'm in a hurry, I will cook it on the stove and it's just as good. As long as we are given a great combination of ingredients, like yours, it's easy to adapt to our own families tastes, to what ingredients we have on hand and how many we are cooking for. When I double the recipe, I use the original amount of the dressing mix and wine. I then add 1/2 cup of chicken broth. My only and very minor complaint would be that it needs a little color to make it more appetizing, so I sprinkled a bit of fresh parsly on top.

I thought it was ok - I made exactly as written.  I didn't think there was enough sauce for a pound of pasta - probably 1/2 pound pasta would be good.  Though it did fill up 7 people quite well.  I wouldn't make it again.

I was surprised to see this recipe baked in the oven!  I've used this recipe out of a Better Homes & Gardens Slow Cooker recipe book for some time now.    I just throw frozen chicken breasts in my slow cooker and pour the sauce over them (agree - double it).  Cook it on low for 8 hours.  A real joy to come home to only having to boil water for the pasta.  If you use one of the slow cooker liners, clean up is a breeze, too.

This is good. I used regular cream cheese. I was out of wine (I know, horrors!) and added about 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard because I felt it would need a kick in place of the wine. It worked well. Family liked. I served with rice. Made a second time with the garlic chives cream cheese and doubled sauce ingredients except the dry mix. Next time I would use half wine and half broth. Cook less time so chicken doesn't try out and sauce doesn't get too thick.

So so good! The BEST chicken pasta ever! My other half absolutely loved this and has asked me to cook it again! Only substituted the italian dressing mix because I couldn't get it and just used mixed italian herbs (though halved the amount). Will soooo make again and again!

Love it because it is easy and doesn't taste like a cheapo dinner.  However, I agree with the others in that the dish tastes salty...

This is super creamy and had good flavor. I didn't realize that the golden mushroom soup had tomato (and my husband is allergic) so I can't make it for us anymore but he did truly enjoy it when I made it last year. Served over less pasta but left everything else the same.

I just made this recipe for my in laws, and I really liked it. It is rather rich though, so serving it with lots of veggies would probably be a good idea. I made mine in the crockpot for 3 hours on low, and it was nice and tender when I took it out. Very good recipe.

I've been making this dish for years now.  The print-out I have of this recipe dates to 2003!  This is easily the best chicken recipe on this site, I don't know why I haven't reviewed it yet.  No changes are necessary, follow as is!!!  I've made this for company, for a friend recovering from surgery, and for just for the two of us.  Everyone asks me for the recipe.  Try this, you will love it!

Absolutely delicious. I did double the sauce and added chopped green onions and frozen broccoli. I covered it with foil til almost done so the sauce would not dry out. Served it over angel hair pasta. This is definetly going to be one of my favorites. 11/3/09 This is my favorite recipe on here. I make it at least twice a month. I now make it in the crock pot, I use frozen skinless, boneless chicken tenderloins, put them in the crock pot, double the sauce, mixing all the other ingreds. together and pour over chicken, I turn it on high for about 2 hours and then turn it to low for 4 hours. It is delicious over angel hair pasta or served with mashed potatoes and putting the sauce over the chicken and potatoes.

5 stars!  Easy and enjoyed by everyone in the family.  Perfect weeknight dinner.  I subbed chicken broth for wine (personal preference) and increased the broth, cream cheese and butter to 8 servings.  Served over fettucine - delicious.  Thanks!  Update:  I didn't have the dry Italian dressing mix.  I keep some Paula's (Deen) House Seasoning on hand, and found that about 1 1/2 T (or to taste) was a perfect substitute for the dressing mix!  Paula's House Seasoning:  1/4 C. salt, 1 Tablespoon black pepper, 1 Tablespoon garlic powder, and 1 tsp. onion powder.

It's not often that I make a recipe off here that I think is as good as other reviewers reviewed it. But this.... this was different. It was DELICIOUS!  It was so creamy and had just the right amount of seasoning.  I did double the sauce (except for the seasoning packet).  It made a ton, so for only 2 of us I might half the recipe next time.  But trust me, I WILL be making this again (and again and again!)

Really good recipe. I grilled chicken breast first and then added the sauce and heated through in the oven. As others suggested, I doubled the sauce and am glad that I did. I also added fresh mushrooms to the sauce. Fantastic tasting! I had fettucine on hand, so that is what we used. I will make this again, soon!

Based on other's reviews I modified this recipe slightly to suit my individual tastes.  I cut the chicken into smaller chunks and sauteed it on the stove in olive oil with some garlic (probably 3 grated cloves).  I set it in the casserole dish when it was nearly cooked through and then started the sauce using the butter and browned bits in the same skillet.  I doubled the wine to 1 cup and the cream cheese (mine had chives and onions) to 8 ounces (all the other ingredients remained the same).  When it was heated through I poured over the chicken and baked for about 15-20 minutes.  WOW.  This was absolutely delicious and I already can't wait to make it again.  I think next time I will add some veggies - zucchini, squash, spinach.  The possibilities are endless.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was good for a really quick family meal.  All of it (except pasta) went in the crockpot at lunchtime, was done for dinner!   I only used three chicken breast halves,(to serve four of us) but made the sauce as written for six. I'm glad I did, it needed the extra sauce.

Doubled the sauce but used only 1 packet of italian seasoning mix as others recommended.  I used 1/2 c. of chicken broth (low sodium) and 1/2 c. of white wine.

I sauteed sliced baby bellas, sundried tomatoes (packed without oil) and thawed chopped broccoli in olive oil with 1 crushed garlic clove then added to the sauce before baking.  

Served over penne pasta.  Deelish!

Love this recipe! Cooked this at the beach once and couldn't find some ingredients so i had to be creative. It turned out the best I had ever made it!! I used Fettuccini pasta which really I loved vs. the angel hair, then I couldn't find the Italian salad dressing mix so I had to use the Italian Spritz dressing I brought from home. I sprayed it about 20 times and also I used Light regular cream cheese with no chives. I'm telling you it was so rich and creamy but not too salty!! It was so fantastic. The girls I was at the beach with had eaten it before when I cooked and they absolutely thought this was the best!! We used Yellow Tail Chardonnay and then everything else was the same. I think too that I really cut out alot of calories and sodium, so we all felt better about eating it at the beach!! :)

The first time I made this recipe was 2 years ago. Everytime I make it everyone loves it. I never use wine in recipes, I replace it with broth. I also add mushrooms, red onion, and red peppers.  We like the veggies.

This recipe tasted good, but there was so much sodium from the indgredients I could taste it. I could taste that the ingredients were packaged. Yes, the recipe was easy. And for the amount of time spent it was not bad. But I don't think I would serve this for guests. I could impress them more with something else.

Fabulous!  Easy, easy, easy meal!  My boyfriend and I loved it!  I doubled the sauce - except for the dry italian mix (just used one of those).  It was the perfect amount for the 6 chicken breasts and 1 lb of penne pasta.  I also subbed chicken broth for the wine.  While the pasta was cooking, I sauteed some mushrooms in butter and served that on top.  It was delicious - definitley restaurant quality!  The sauce has such a wonderful flavor, and the color, due to the golden mushroom soup, is very appealing.  I will make this again and again!

This is a great recipe.  I prepared the sauce and then put everything in the crock pot to slowly cook all day.  It came out delicious.  However, I double the sauce because there never seems to be enough for the chicken and pasta.

You could use chicken broth or vegetable broth to substitute for wine, and in this recipe milk or even water would probably work too.

I know the last thing this recipe needs is another review, but I couldn't help myself.  This is absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce but only used one package of the Italian dressing mix.  I also used 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  It's a meal the whole family loves.

For those wanting a Golden Mushroom Soup alternative, add a small can of tomato paste to your cream of mushroom soup; it's essentially the same thing. This has been our FAVORITE company meal for years! We usually serve peas (and of course salad and rolls) with it, then add the leftover peas to the noodles and sauce for another meal (I usually double everything except the dry dressing mix).  It's the BEST recipe on this SITE!

Really yummy!  I made this with the following changes:  I used chicken breast with the rib attached and cooked it all day in the crock pot!  Be sure and fish out the bones from the chicken before you serve though.  The chicken just falls apart.  I doubled the sauce and served over pasta.  I have made this for company and everyone just loves it.

Wonderful recipe!  However I did use different suggestions from other reviewers and made a few changes.  I doubled the sauce recipe (necessary), used cream of chicken soup instead of the golden mushroom soup, chicken broth instead of the wine, and italian seasoning instead of the salad dressing mix. I only had rotini pasta, so I used it instead of angelhair pasta.  I cubed the chicken and reduced the baking time to 45 minutes.  It turned out perfect!  Thank you very much for this recipe!  I will use it again and again!

This recipe is GREAT - thanks for posting! I substitute chicken broth for the white wine when I make it - comes out wonderfully. Also, this dish can be made and served like spaghetti, instead of cooking it casserole style. Just prepare the sauce, pasta, and then brown the chicken breasts/tenders in a skillet. Delicious. I made it on vacation over the 4th, and the family loved it.

Scratching my head I shout: YOU PEOPLE MUST LOVE DEHYDRATED GARLIC!  Wow, I can't believe this recipe made it into a cookbook with all these rave reviews.  What a letdown.  I will be the first to sacrifice some flavor for a quick and easy recipe but this one needed major doctoring.  Before I made this one, I read several pages of reviews because if more than one reviewer says the sauce it too thick or whatever, I will modify my version as they did.  Like others had said, the cream cheese specified was not available at the stores so I subbed regular with fresh chives. Also many reviewers said it was too salty.  Still others said they could taste the wine too much.  I could be wrong about this but I think you are supposed to boil wine to get the alcohol to evaporate (the instructions say not to boil it).  With this in mind I thought I would reduce the amount of dressing mix and wine.  When I tasted this I was so disappointed.  It tasted very salty and like I had put too much garlic powder in it.  Keep in mind I love salty food!  After dinner we all went to brush our teeth to get the fake garlic flavor out of our mouths.  I tried to fix it by adding milk and water and it did help somewhat.  Next time I'd use another type of soup, use just a little of the dressing mix or just use real garlic (since that's all the dressing really added), add milk or chicken broth and maybe parmesan cheese.   Sorry but 2 stars is for ease of preparation mostly.

My family did not like this recipe.  the sauce was not creamy, in fact it got sort of dry the longer it sat.  It tasted like dry herbs, which is not an appealing flavor to me.  It was also very salty, I am guessing due to the dry Italian dressing mix.  I will not make this again; I can't imagine any of the previous suggestions helping this one to taste better to us!

This is really easy.  I think that the chicken breasts could be cooked in a skillet and the sauce cooked in a pan and then just add them together.  I think that would be faster and the sauce would stay thicker.

So yummy! The only change I made was in using whole grain wide egg noodles. The sauce is  very creamy. A wide noodle or large size pasta is needed to handle the thickness of the sauce. A definite keeper!

This was excellent and my whole family loved it. I made a lot of revisions based on previous reviews: 2 TB butter, 1 can chicken broth instead of wine, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup soy milk (that's all I had), 8 oz sliced mushrooms. I was going to serve this with a spinach salad, but I found that the dish looked flat and beige so I cooked the spinach in the sauce before adding the chicken (I sauteed the chicken in bite-sized pieces with the mushrooms, took it out of the pan, made the sauce, and then put the chicken and mushrooms back in). I used only 3 pieces of chicken breast (2.2 lb total) and that was plenty for 4 people. I was told the sauce was too liquidy, so next time I won't use the milk. I might add some paprika as well. All told, this is a great recipe to work with and make your own!

I really like this recipe, and I don't care for mushrooms at all.  My friends rave about this dinner whenever I make it for them, and I definitely recommend it to everyone.  I usually make it with bowtie noodles (because they're my favorite) and would recommend making more sauce to use with the pasta.

This recipe is somewhat overrated, although it is rather simple to make.  It isn't a meal that I would use regularly.

I used onion soup mix instead of italian seasons, only because I thought I had some and didn't.  I had to add milk to the sauce because it was so salty.  I used real white wine instead of cooking wine and I doubled the sauce like prior reviews suggested.  It made for plenty of extra sauce.  The hubby and kids loved it and asked me to make it again.

Try it with fettucine. I think the sauce would be less overpowering with a thicker pasta.

Whenever I ask my husband what he wants for dinner he says Angel Chicken Pasta--even if we just had it the night before!  I use chopped green onions and regular cream cheese instead of chivey cream cheese.  I usually add mushrooms too--just because I'm a shroom fiend.

We loved this recipe, had it for New Years Eve. I doubled the cream cheese and wine added fresh mushrooms and chopped green onions instead of chives. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I served this to guests tonight.  Everyone liked it.  I did not use wine, but used 1/2 cup chicken broth using 'better than bullion'.  I found this made the dish a hint too salty.  I will just use water next time.  Delicious!

I love this! It's a favorite in our house. I do agree that it's pretty salty, but I think I've solved that for us. I use unsalted butter, low sodium soup, and substitute low sodium broth for the wine. That helps alot, and I also use wheat pasta (tastes the same), and don't salt the water. It balances out to a scrumptious blend! Great recipe Marian!!

This was great but I "tweaked" so much based on other reviewers' suggestions, I'm not even sure it's the same recipe!  I made as directed but added one can of low-sodium chicken broth, one can of mushrooms, some garlic, and the juice of one lemon.  I used Ranch dressing mix as it was what I had on hand but only used half the packet.  I think this fixed some of the other problems people complained about (gooey, bland, salty, not enough sauce) because we loved it.

Update... 5 years later :-)... Made it with Shrimp.  Delish!!  My family loved it.  I actually forgot that I had made this years ago.  It's a little rich for me but my family can't get enough.  I just made it in the pot and added cooked shrimp at the end.  I also sauteed sliced baby portabella mushrooms in a little butter and white wine and added that as well.  Wow!!  Excellent.  Loved how easy it was to make .After reading some of the reviews... these are the changes that i made... i doubled the sauce with all ingredients except the dry dressing mix (I used only the one package.) I added slices of uncooked mushroom to the sauce.  I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces and therfore reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes.  Chicken came out very tender and juicy. I used rotelle pasta.  When both the chicken and pasta were done I combined together in serving bowl.  Added salt and pepper to taste.  Next time i make this I will add a little roasted red pepper for color.  Thanks Marian

Outstanding and easy!  I've made this twice in the last week (the first was a test run before we served it for company!).  First time I served it over rice, second over egg noodles.  I doubled+ the sauce -- can't have enough of a good thing!  However, I only used one pakage of the dressing mix, even when doubled (used garlic and herb salad mix 2nd time, liked that better).  Also used Philadephia Whipped Cream Cheese with chive -- melted very smoothly and quickly!!  This is a great recipe that I will make again and again!  Thanks!

It was very easy to prepare, but was too salty and processed for our liking.  If you like condensed soup casseroles, you'll love this.  If you don't, steer clear.

I'm a cook at a treatment center for teenage girls.  The majority of the girls liked this and all of the staff loved it.  I did double the sauce recipe and it worked out pretty well.  I ended up with a bit of left over sauce, but I think it wouldn't have been enough if I had done the amount given in the recipe.  My husband's fairly picky about sauces and he loved this dish.  It wasn't hard to multiply (I made it for 24 people.) It was a great break from alfredo and marinera sauces.

Fantastic! My kids even love this one.  I am a huge CROCK POT fan so I always cook this in the crock pot. I also double the recipe every time and freeze the extra so I don't waste 1/2 tub of cream cheese.  I use frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot on high for 1 hour and then turn it to low and cook it 5-6 hours on low.  Also is delicious over white rice.

My husband and I  didn't care for this at all.  It seems to have a really "packaged" taste, which isn't surprising considering the canned soup, dressing mix and processed cream cheese, all in the same recipe.  Won't make it again.

Delicious!  My entire family loved this recipe,which surprised me because of the wine.  My children are 12 and 8 and they raved over it.  I pounded the chicken first, which made it so tender.  It was like butter.  You must double the sauce.  I didn't double the wine or the salad dressing mix - just everything else, because I was concerned about the salt content. I also let the soup and wine boil so that some of the wine would cook off.  This is a dish that is restaurant taste and quality.  LOVED IT!

This was reallly great! My husband loved it! The only thing I did different was I added a whole container of sliced mushrooms on top of the chicken, then put the sauce on top and baked. My husband commented that he really loved the mushrooms with the sauce and I did too. I think it also helped that I used a nice dry chardonay/ pino grigio blended white wine.

This is the kind of dish you would find in a little cafe in Italy or in a French bistro. You really don't need to change a thing here. This dish is fantasticly flavorful and extremely easy. Don't feel like you must double the sauce as some have suggested; there is enough sauce to coat each serving.  If you want a change from the mundane tomato-based sauce, this is for you!!

I swear this is the best dish I have ever cooked! I loved it! I was amazed at the flavor, and it was so simple to make.  You might want to double the sauce part of the recipe for 6 chicken breasts though.  I had just enough sauce for 3.  This is a great recipe, thanks!

Absolutely delicious. My husband, who doesn't normally go wild for chicken, FREAKED when he had his first few bites. Even our picky company were moaning their heads off! I just love the sauce. I think this is even better over a bed of whipped mashed potatoes.Don't listen to the bad reviewers, even if it MIGHT be this good isn't it worth trying?!

this is one of my favorite dishes and great for when you have company over with a bottle of wine and crusty french or garlic bread. I use chicken tenders as opposed to breasts. Yummy- thank you.

Used one cup of wine, two cans of soup (cream of wild mushroom as couldn't find golden) and double the cream cheese.  Served over spaghetti as that's all I had in the house and the crowd went wild! My pickiest eater said it's a 10 star recipe, not just 5! Thanks.

I have made this several times and it is always well received.  My boyfriend wasn't crazy about it -- he said he could taste too much white wine -- but he is VERY much a meat and potatoes man.  It's been a hit a dinner parties.  I use chicken breast tenders rather than halves, and cube them up.  I also toss the angel hair with the cooked chicken pieces and sauce.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful..but I would definitely double the salsa next time so that there is extra to pour on top of the pasta.  (The sauce is delicious!)

I will make this dish again.  It will not be a regular because it calls for quite a few ingredients I don't carry on my shelves often.  It tasted cheesy, and full of flavor.  The chicken tasted moist.  I wish there was just a tad bit more of the sauce to pour over the noodles, though.

This looked good on paper but the sauce was too thick, extremely bland, and gooey in a bad way. The chicken came out nice and tender but that's just the nature of chicken. I can't believe so many people raved about it!!

The sauce is good, although salty if use the entire pack of italian dressing mix.  The chicken comes out much better (not dry) when you cook it in a slow cooker for 4 to 5 hours instead of in the oven.

This was delicious.  Only Substitution I made was 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of the wine.  Everyone in my family loved it.

very easy and good.  I baked it and then froze it, then baked again, and it was still delicious.  I doubled the sauce and found it to be the perfect amount for the pasta.

Very good!  I doubled everything except for the italian dressing and butter.  It tasted the same as the first time I made it, when I went according to the recipe.  This way there was a lot of extra sauce for leftovers.

This was a delicious recipe... VERY rich. I would make it again, BUT- I would cut the wine in half.. the flavor was very prominent, and I will put very little sauce over the individual servings next time, because it is so rich. A little goes a long way.. don't spoil this recipe by putting too much sauce over your pasta.. start with VERY little.. then add more. Other than that, it was delicious, and I will make again. My husband said it tasted like something you would eat at a fancy restaurant. (but he said the wine was too strong) Thanks again!

This recipe was delicous! Even my fiance ate it and you have no idea how hard it is to find something that he will eat! I thought the sauce was very creamy, there just wasn't enough! Next time i make it I will double the sauce ingredients. I also only used two chicken breast without halving them. Chicken came out very moist. Substiuted wine for chicken broth. Don't think it made much of a difference.

This was good! I made it for my dinner guests and they liked it. I doubled the recipe and used cream of mushroom soup and only one packet of italian seasoning due to the reviews. I also added fresh mushrooms. The wine gave it great flavor. Oh and just to add...my dog liked it!

I rated this recipe highly quite a few years ago.  Thinking it would be a safe bet I made it again tonight.  Oh boy, my tastes and cooking must have evolved.  This tasted like a conglomeration of processed, over-seasoned, over-rich flavors.  That may be the appeal for some tastes, but not ours.  My family wanted nothing to do with it and I will definitely not be making it again.

The doubled the sauce as recommended by so many reviews. The sauce was very salty and I did not add salt to the water when I boiled the pasta. I recommend not using wine and use milk instead to lessen the salty flavor, only use one envelope of Italian dressing mix and use low sodium soup. My dish was completely cooked in the oven after 30 minutes. This dish is really delicious and I recommend it.

I will double this recipe from now on!  I didn't bake sauce and chicken togehter.  I baked the boneless chicken in a hot 425 degree oven for 25 minutes and just prepared the sauce in a pan.  I wanted to guaratee tender and moist meat. My nine year old went wild for this dish.  Took leftovers to work the next day and shared with five other people.  All five asked for the recipe and said it was awesome! I'd like to have more quick-easy-impressive recipes like this. TRY THIS ONE FOR SURE!

I have been making this since 1987.  I got the recipe from a co-worker because I was cooking dinner for a date.  My recipe doesn't call for cream cheese with chives. Just use plain cream cheese.  Make extra sauce and serve with egg noodles or white rice.  Put a green vegetable in the side. (Looks great) Maybe a tossed salad too!  This is a really good recipe!

Tasty but very salty. I never realized that Italian dressing mix was so high in sodium. That combined with undiluted soup was too much. Next time I will use the butter to make a white sauce to dilute the soup, or maybe just add some evaporated milk. My husband loved the sauce but he doesn't worry about sodium, ever! You could eliminate/reduce the butter...it was floating on top.

We liked it and this will be part of my monthly recipe rotation. I followed the advice of others and used cream of chicken as my family doesn't like cream of mushroom. I didn't have a packet of italian seasoning mix on hand so I used dried basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. I used 1/4 C white wine and 1/4 C water and a chicken bullion cube. It's a good recipe. I look forward to tweaking it some more to make it something my family will ask for.

I doubled the sauce per the reviews and began to worry when adding the golden mushroom soup (decided to only add one can and not two per the reviews because it was so THICK, added a little water), to the butter and Italian seasonings/white wine mixture, and then the cream cheese mixture, it just seemed like a mess of  thick yucky sauce.  Went with it anyway and poured it over my salted/peppered chicken, baked for a full hour, (covered with foil for first 40 min), still skeptical, wondered if I'd completely wasted the ingrediants, and low and behold my kids liked it, so giving it a rating of four.  Initially thought this was a complete miss!  Guess I MIGHT make this again...seemed like a miss match of ingredients that went over quite and surprisingly well at this household!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe fairly close except I doubled the sauce and used Rotini pasta and plain cream cheese. The 6 chicken breasts I had were very large so I cut them each into 3 pieces. I don't drink wine so had to make a special purchase. I bought two single serve bottles of white wine at $1 each. And because I doubled the sauce I used both of them. With the larger breasts cut into smaller pieces I used two baking dishes. In the end, I thought the dish looked pale, probably due to not having golden mushroom soup. A little browning of the chicken would have helped. However, not browning the chicken made this a super easy dinner to throw together. My family loved it and I'll make this again.

I first made this recipe more than 12 or more years ago, whenever it was first on the site.  It has been a huge hit for all these years, and I've served it to mixed crowds of people, all to RAVE reviews!  Whomever the reviewer was who said it was bland, clearly missed something - 2500 plus reviews with a 5 star rating must be doing something right.  The original recipe, as is, is very, very flavorful.  Make sure to get a wine you enjoy drinking.  Also note, this can be made with pork chops, which is what I'm going to do tomorrow.  Also note: the person who wrote this recipe PERFECTLY TIMED the pasta portion - it ends up all being done at the exact same time, which is a huge triumph!

This was just ok for us.  The sauce was not what I expected.  It reminded me more of a hearty dish like chicken paprikash than what I think of in chicken pasta.   The sauce was too thick for angel hair pasta, maybe with a thicker pasta I would have found it better.  The taste was ok, but a bit too rich and salty for my taste.

I only used three large chicken breasts but kept the full amount of sauce, which I thought was a good call. I sliced the breasts into strips about 1" thick, placed them in a foiled-lined 13x9 pan and gave them a sprinkle of garlic powder and black pepper. For the sauce, I started with about 1 cup of chicken broth, but added about the same amount of white wine to get the right consistency. I also used Neufchatel cream cheese and also added about a tblsp of dried chives and more garlic powder, onion powder and pepper, and served over wide egg noodles. A very good dish with a lot of possibilities; I like where someone suggested even using shrimp. Thanks Marian!

This recipe is soooo good! And it's fast! However DO NOT use the hidden valley Italian dressing mix. I strayed from the one I normally use and went for hidden valley and it tasted terrible! Nothing like it usually does.

I cooked this recipe the other night, and honestly my husband and I didn't think it was that great. My sister on the other hand loved it! Maybe just different tastes? But I probably won't be making it again.

This recipe is amazing! Our family loved it, even my 2 year old cleared her plate!  I looked at some reviews and made a few adjustments.  I melted the butter in the pot and added 2 Tbl of flour. I then added the dressing and a Whole can of chicken broth instead of the wine.  I then added the cream cheese and added mushrooms.  I decided to grill the chicken partially then finished it in the oven covered with sauce and Parmesan.  Delish!!

Instead of chicken I used shrimp. I skipped the oven step since shrimp do not take as long as chicken. My kids loved it! We dug in before hubby got home.

I can only rate this as three stars because of the HIGH amount of Sodium in the recipe.  In the entire recipe there are 4160 mgrams of Sodium or approximately 700 per serving.  That relates to about 30% of the RDA.

I looked at using regular Cream of Mushroom soup but that would raise the Sodium by 280 mgrams.  Using plain cream cheese and adding my own chives would lower the Sodium by about 100 mgram.

I used Philly soft cream cheese with chives and onion, Good Seasons zesty Italian dressing, and Campbell's golden mushroom soup.

The flavor probably would have been superb if it was not for all the salty flavor masking it.

I was nervous to try this recipe. The combination of ingredients and mixed reviews almost made me decide not to try it. I am so glad I did. The sauce was thicker than we normally like so I added 1 cup of chicken broth. No other changes were made. My husband said after two bites he really liked the sauce. It was creamy, mild yet flavorful and we both thought it had just the right amount of cream cheese. I will make this again!

I'd recommend doubling the sauce and only cooking as much noodles as you need at serving time. Leftovers are good, but better with fresh noodles.

This is a favourite for my family and is always a hit for "give-away" meals for a family with a new baby etc. Don't be shy to experiment with this recipe! I have tried several different variations to suit what I have on hand, all with yummy results. I always use light cream cheese and will switch up the flavours(herb and garlic works great), I use low sodium mushroom soup and have tried different dressing flavours (ranch, dill ... although still good, italian is the best). I find using a whole package of dressing mix to be too salty for our taste and so I only use half. Also, if I don't have an open bottle of wine, water works ok. Serve with roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, or pasta. They all work!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because of the ease of preparation. My husband and four kids love it, but it I can't say it is very special.  On the other hand, it is a go to recipe because it is easy and fool proof.  I love that the baking time allows an opportunity to make a salad and I seem to almost always have the ingredients on hand. I like to add sauteed mushrooms to the sauce, but the recipe stands alone without it as well.  Most of the time, the sauce seems a little thick to me after baking, so I tend to add chicken stock. Hope this helps!

The first 20+ recipes I tried from this site my gf and I have thoroughly enjoyed or loved. This one unfortunately ended that streak. To be fair I marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce but thoroughly washed all of it off the outside of the chicken before putting the sauce on top. Also took a small taste of the sauce before putting it on the chicken and didn't like it. I was excited given the outstanding reviews but to each his/her own. Since I was able to finish the plate 2 stars instead of 1.

This is just entirety too salty. Followed the recipe exactly, and had to throw it away. Even if it had tasted good, there was not enough sauce for the pasta.

I decided to make a pasta dinner for Sunday night and the first thing that saw on this site was Angle Chicken Pasta. I thought it would delicious and easy to make. So I made this for my family of 10, I had to double the recipe. But It turned out amazing and everyone just loved it! The taste was so good and the chicken was perfect. It's a keeper.

I prepared this exactly as directed except I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts as that was all I had, so I reduced the bake time to 45 minutes.  I really liked the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the chicken, but it seemed that serving it over angel hair pasta was not the best suggestion.  The sauce was very thick and when poured over the angel hair, it turned into one big sticky ball of pasta.  I will make this again, but next time serve it over either penne or rigatoni, or even rice.  Great flavor and very easy to make!

Loved this!! The flavorful sauce reminded me of something I would order in a fancy Italian restaurant! I will surely make again! Thanks for sharing!! PS. It was just as good with whole wheat spaghetti (hubby doesn't like angel hair). I would however like to know how to get the cream cheese to melt down completely. I had it at room temp when I added it, but still left with chunks.

This dish has circulated throughout my family, (daughter, nieces, sister, brother) and everyone has loved it with the exception of one person who does not consume alcohol, thus, used broth I believe. I think the wine is key in pulling all of the interesting flavors together. It is my belief that those who stated this was inedible must have deviated from the specific ingredients and instructions. I have made it countless times to rave reviews and actually crave it every now and then. I too, after eating it just once, have doubled the sauce each time thereafter...that is one good sauce! I look forward to trying it next in the slow cooker.

Delicious! I have made this twice now, within the last week. First time I made it,  I used the white wine. 2nd time, I subbed chicken stock for the white wine. *WAS NOT AS FLAVORFUL* I would highly suggest against subbing on the white wine. Plus, you can drink the rest!

This is soooo good.  I made a few modifications...as others, instead of white wine I use chicken broth.  I also use cream of chicken with herbs instead of the golden mushrom soup.  I cut up the chicken breasts in bite size pieces, season them, and cook them on the stovetop with butter prior to mixing it in with everything.  I put the chicken in a 9x13 dish, then cover it with everything else.  Since the chicken has already been cooked, I only keep it in the oven for about 30-35 minutes.  Last step is pouring the finished product over the cooked pasta.  Everyone loves it!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

This meal was delicious.  I misread the soup ingredient and used cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom soup.  Not surprisingly, adding a bunch of fat and salt didn't hinder the taste of the meal!  I'll definitely be making this again - it was easy and tasty.

This was just ok.  Not sure that I really enjoyed the golden mushroom soup this way.  I've had it in other recipes and liked it, but this one just didn't really do it for me.  We ate it, but I'm not sure I'd make again.  Chicken was very moist though.

Both my husband & I LOVED this! I too used chicken broth instead of white wine like other reviewers had mentioned, ( just because I didn't have any white wine on hand,) used about 2/3 of the can and it made plenty of sauce. I did only use three large chicken breasts instead of 6 though, and I cut them into strips before cooking so that they'd cook faster. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I made this pretty much as directed, with the exception that I cubed the chicken and added some sliced mushrooms and asparagus. Big hit at the party. I was a little skeptical at first, it seemed a little it'd come out a little too salty but the guests loved it.

I've never been one to leave a review on anything from this website... but this recipe was amazing! I used the slow cooker. I followed the recipe, but doubled all liquids ( i didnt have white wine on hand so i used chicken broth)... i pre-mixed/melted all ingredients in a sauce pan and seared the chicken breast in EVOO ( just until lightly browned on both sides). Then i placed the chicken in the crock and poured melted sauce over the top. Slow cooked on high for 3.5 hours...served over penne pasta. AMAZING!

Quick and easy. I cut the chicken in strips and sauteed in a little oil and garlic, salt and pepper. Set that aside and then made the sauce as written. Mixed it all together at the end and served it with a bunch of steamed veggies. Yum!

What a wonderful recipe! I didn't change much as this recipe really doesn't need changing in my opinion. Although some of the reviews I read had great suggestions. I have a little one so to make things easier I threw everything in a crock pot using the exact measurements as the original recipe. I also used chicken broth instead of wine because I don't think our children would appreciate the flavor. (They would eat hamburger helper every night if it was up to them) Then I pulled the chicken out once it was tender and shredded it and put it back in the sauce for about another hour. We ate it over penne but I would like to try it on mashed potatoes next time. Thanks for another dinner staple!

The only thing I would change is doubling the sauce. With that much chicken and pasta, you definately need enough sauce! I did add mushrooms and used chicken broth instead of the wine. 
Tip: make sure you are using the Golden Mushroom soup and not Cream of Mushroom soup, it would definately make a difference in the outcome.

tastes more expensive than the ingredients that are used to make it. because i almost never buy cream cheese with chives; i just add chopped green onion to regular cream cheese.

I've made this twice now and it was wonderful both times. The first I made the sauce exactly as written, but with only two chicken breasts. There was plenty of sauce left over to have it over noodles the next night and it was awesome. The second time I made it was for company, who loved it too. Made it with 4 chicken breasts this time and it was just the right amount of sauce, so I'm not sure I would feel this was enough sauce for 6 chicken breasts. The sauce was thinner the second time too -- I'm not sure if that was due to more liquids from the additional chicken breasts or perhaps I cooked it at too high a temp on the stove....

I couldn't find golden mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom soup with garlic.  I also didn't use any cream cheese.  I combined all of the ingredients in a slow cooker for about 6 hours on low and it turned out great! However, I think that this would be a lot better on rice instead of pasta.

This was good and easy to make..the sauce is super flavorful..and I agree with another's post that it almost tastes like a cheese sauce but there's no cheese! Definitely a go to recipe for when chicken breasts are on sale!

I love this recipe!  I have a dairy allergy - and this is easily made using dairy free butter and cream cheese mixed with dried chives.  If I'm in more of a hurry, I season the chicken with salt and pepper, then saute in a pan instead of baking.  I also add 8 oz of sliced mushrooms and saute with the chicken.  Mix it all together and YUM!  Goes great with a side of veggies!

I just browned the chicken breast on the stove top, added the sauce and simmered for 20 min.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1 chopped green onion.

After trying this recipe as it is written and then going back and trying it again, I agree with many of the previous reviewers; MORE SAUCE!  Also, don't omit the wine or substitute with chicken broth (as has been suggested); wine gives the sauce a wonderful tang that you can't get without it.  I do recommend slicing the chicken into strips and doubling (at least) the sauce recipe (don't double the cream cheese though).  I like to brown the chicken breasts a little in a pan with butter first before I put it in a baking dish.  The slow cooker idea is a hit as well!

I helped my friend make this for a little "girls night" (wine and a chick flick!). I wasn't so sure about the condensed soup and dry dressing...I prefer to make my sauces from scratch with cream and seasonings. BUT this chicken was SO so yummy. Chicken was tender and the sauce..I kept dipping my bread in it and wanted to like my plate clean! I think it would be really great with some broccoli thrown in. Definitely make this!

probably not the healthiest, but it's amazing :)  The first time I made this, I didn't know what "golden mushroom soup" was, so I used regular.  The second time I did use it.  My whole family prefer this made with regular mushroom soup.  And I double the sauce, except I stick with just one package of the Italian seasonings.

Amazing!  A family fave and the ultimate dish for company.  As everyone else has, I read the reviews and made a few changes as follows:  I used 1/2 cup of butter, 1 pkg seasoning, 1/2 cup white cooking wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1 can cream of golden mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken, 8 oz cream cheese with chives......what flavor!!!!!  I cut up the chicken breasts and used the slow cooker for 3-4 hours.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it had made more sauce. I didn't make as much chicken as the recipe called for either (didn't have enough, and it was just my fiance and I) and there still wasn't enough sauce to really coat the amount of noodles. However, it did taste wonderful. My fiance raved about it. I will make it again, and double the sauce next time.

This was delicious!  My entire family loved it.  I did make a few substitutions....I used 1 cup chicken broth in place of the wine, 2 tbsp unsalted butter and 8 oz. regular cream cheese.  I made the sauce as directed but then put frozen chicken breasts in my slow cooker and poured the sauce on top.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and then turned it off until ready to serve.  I served over spaghetti noodles.  Delish!

Very easy & delicious!  I didn't have any italian dressing mix, so I marinated the chicken in italian dressing for a bit, then substituted chicken broth for the wine & cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom.  I also doubled the sauce & it was a huge hit with the family!

Was SOOOOOOO amazing!!! My hubby LOVED it!!! I was unable to find cream cheese with chives, so I used cream cheese with chives and onion. I used a bag of frozen chicken breast tenderloins, and put everything in the crockpot for 6 hours. The chicken was so moist and delicious... oh, and i didnt put the pasta in the crockpot... :O) i made that later

I ended up making this all on the stove top because it was too hot to turn the oven on. I browned the chicken in the melted butter then added the rest of the stuff. I turned down to low and covered the pan and cooked for 20 mins. Then removed the lid and cooked for another 20 stirring often. I broke up the chicken pieces with my spoon. Good flavor! I was worried about using the dry dressing mix thinking it would be too salty. Well it wasn't. Oh and DO NOT SKIP THE WINE. It added a great flavor. This recipe tightened up fast after adding the pasta so I don't recommend this sitting around too long as it turned into one sticky glob.

very yummy...altered as some reviewers suggested, using a whole 8 oz pkg of cream cheese (plus a little) a whole stick of butter, 3 cloves garlic, chicken broth to replace wine, and a pkg of sliced portabello mushroom. (using only one pkg of dressing).  I salted the chicken before browning, will NOT do that next time.  Because some other reviewers claimed it was bland, it does not need any extra salt. (I am a salter)  oh yeah, this all went into crock pot on low for 7 hours...so great, i cannot wait for the leftovers

This was okay. I didn't expect it to taste like stroganoff. I REALLY don't like stroganoff so I couldn't enjoy it. My boyfriend who LOVES stroganoff liked it and said he would want me to make it again.

HINT: Keep the noodles in water until you are ready to serve them, this will keep them from becoming congealed and dried out.  They become a gooey mess of noodles if you try to make it fancy and put them in a separate bowl.  Just serve them straight from the boiling water and you won't have any problems with the noodles getting all clumpy like mine did.  Chicken recipe turned out perfect!

A huge hit with my family.  I used Italian herbs and spices (basil, rosemary, garlic) along with salt & pepper instead of the salad dressing mix because I didn't have that on hand.  I also just cooked it on the stove instead of baking because I needed it ready sooner.  DELICIOUS!!!

I was very leery of this recipe at first because I have made a similar crockpot version that turned out to be a big gooey mess.  But, I decided to try it anyway.  I'm so glad I did!  The flavor was great, as was the consistency.  I did make a few minor changes:  I cut two and a half chicken breasts into strips and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and cooked in a skillet with some butter.  I kept the sauce proportions the same and added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  I didn't have the golden soup so I used cream of chicken.  When the chicken was cooked I put the strips into a glass casserole dish and poured the sauce over - baked at 350 for about 15 minutes.  I served the dish over wide egg noodles - keeping the sauce amounts the same, there was just the right amount to use as a sauce over the pasta.  One more thing...a lot of reviewers have said to omit the white wine.  DON"T DO IT!  The white wine is what makes this dish so good and flavorful.

Loved this - and boyfriend raved about it. In fact, even though he is normally a big meat eater, he loved the sauce so much he said he would have enjoyed it just as much if I left out the chicken. The only change I made was to first lightly pound the breasts and to then cook at 375 for 30 minutes instead of 325 for an hour. The chicken came out perfect - tender and juicy. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti as I didn't have angel hair pasta. Very easy and very yummy.

I have made this recipe with and without the chicken!  It is even delicious without the chicken and just as a pasta sauce for the angel hair.  I always double the sauce and use half as much butter.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious! Doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested. Next time might only use 1.5 packets of the Italian dressing, I thought it was a little zingy though my guests said they thought it might be too bland if I was to cut it down. Also cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces and threw in a container of baby bella mushrooms. The chicken was pretty tender, but next time will try the slow cooker. I used bow tie pasta to carry all that sauce - may add a cup/can of broth next time to loosen it a bit. Perfect with steamed broccoli on the side!

Made exactly as directed except doubled the sauce.  Suprisingly good, not too salty.  I may try to lighten it up next time.  Only one of my kids didn't like it.

This was really good. I made it exactly as written the only change being doubling the sauce and cutting up the chicken in to bite sized bits. My only complaint is that it was super salty. I didn't add any extra salt so the salt must have come from the golden mushroom soup. I would recommend searching for some low sodium golden mushroom soup and then adding salt later if you feel it needs it. If I make this again next time, I will also add some broccoli and fresh chopped tomatoes, maybe even mushrooms. Peas would be a good addition as well.

I liked the sauce this recipe made. I am not sure if I used too much wine or not a great quality of wine, but the taste was over powering. I would scale back a little on that part. I really liked the alfredo like sauce using the dry dressing mix. I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I planned to make this while I was visiting my son and his family in another city.  When preparing to start it was noticed that all the chicken was gone, but they had shrimp, so I subbed with the shrimp.  It turned out great even with the last minute substitution.  Lovely!  Special yet simple to prepare.

My family loves this dish.  Right now I've got an extra full house - all 12 in my family clean their plates!  Not an easy feat.  I serve it over gemelli pasta for a heartier meal and add Italian seasoniong, garlic powder, and some rosemary before baking.   Absolutely Delish!

The sauce is wonderful and versatile. I used 1 can of mushroom soup, 8 ounces of light cream cheese 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup water and I cut the butter in half. I also added sauteed mushrooms and onions. I'll use the sauce with shrimp and vegetables...so good!

I make this as written, and it is delicious. I don't like wine, but it's very subtle. I do think that the sauce should be doubled, because a lot of it is absorbed and/or dried up when baked. This may not be a problem when using a slow cooker, but again, I followed the given directions. Thanks for sharing! :)

Oh my goodness, yum!  Follow the directions exactly, though.  I added a little chicken broth (based on reviews) because the sauce seemed too thick before baking, but it got thinner during the baking process.  Will make many times again, but will probably double the sauce (because I love sauce!).  Will also try it in the crock pot per other reviews.  Thank you!

I cut the chicken into pieces and saute it in butter. Then I add the rest of the sauce ingredients into the pan and cook. This way, it is a much faster recipe. It takes about 20 minutes beginning to end.

This recipe is foolproof. I've made it several times, each time missing one ingredient or another, and it's always great anyway! Last night I made it basically as written, but didn't have a packet of dry dressing mix. I just added in a variety of dry ingredients, some wine, 8 oz of lite cream cheese and 2 cans of soup. TASTED GREAT ANYWAY!

A simple and easy dish.  We all liked it.  Don't let it cook down too far, though, or the sauce will be too thick and salty.

This is a very good sauce! I did make some changes though. I cubed my chicken up and then lightly breaded it and cooked in olive oil so there was no need to bake the chicken and sauce. I also doubled the cream cheese and added mushrooms. I won't use angle hair pasta next time it is by far my least favorite pasta, maybe linguine or something else. All in all a very good sauce recipe.

I made this in the crock pot. I doubled the ingredients and the end result was really good. The only complaint I had was that it was a little salty (probably from the extra packet of mix I added), so I will only add 1 instead of 2 next time. I also used chicken stock instead of the wine. This recipe was really good and I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic recipe!  Sliced the chicken and sauteed with olive oil for 2-3 minutes before cooking in the oven.  Exchanged a can of chicken broth for the wine, sauteed mushrooms and garlic with the chicken.  Boiled frozen broccoli a few minutes before finishing in the oven, poured broccoli over the pasta and the chicken and sauce over the top- was FANTASTIC!

I made this using shrimp and it was very good!  I just added the shrimp to the sauce at the end until it was heated through.  I've also made it as written with chicken and it is delicious that way as well.  I love how the sauce tastes.  Sometimes I add mushrooms to it which tastes great.

This is probably one of the most tasty ways to prepare chicken that I've ever had, and it smells SO GOOD while it's cooking! The substitutions I made were as follows: I replaced 1/2 c. white wine with 1/2 c. whole milk; I used plain cream cheese; I replaced the cream of golden mushroom with plain cream of chicken; I reduced the chicken breasts to 3 but used the sauce recipe as written; and my chicken breasts were not thawed when I put them in, but they were really thin & flat. I will absolutely make this again!

This wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be after reading most of the reviews.  I made this recipe to the "T".  I didn't make any changes because I wanted to review the recipe as it's written.  The flavor really wasn't there for me.  It kind of fell flat - no layers of flavor or anything different from just condensed soup and noodles.  Which is kind of disappointing considering all the good reviews.

When reading the ingredients, I did think at first the combination was kind of bizarro sounding, but it turned out pretty good. A tiny bit on the rich side, which sometimes doesn't go over too well with my boys, but they both thought it was good too. Thanks!!!

This dish is great.  My husband loves it!  We like to have a lot of the sauce to pour over the noodles so I add more wine, soup, and cream cheese.  I also sub the chicken out for shrimp and it's wonderful.

Pretty darned good stuff!  I gave it 4 stars because I modified it a bit.  I use about half the chicken and double everything for the sauce (except for the Good Seasons Italian Dressing - I only use 1 1/2 packs to cut down on the saltiness).  I saute the chicken breasts and then cut them up, add to the sauce, and bake for about half an hour.  I also use Penne pasta because I think this sauce is too thick and rich for Angel Hair.  The recipe is a keeper though.

I almost rated this a three and I've never done that before. This recipe should taste so much better based on the amount of fat and calories in it. I used 1/8 cup of butter and I'm glad I did because butter was floating on top when I took it out of the oven (gross) I also cut up the chicken to reduce cooking time to 35 minutes and added sauteed mushrooms and chopped broccoli. At first, I was so excited to try this recipe, but would probably never make it again. I can think of much better ways to use cream cheese and wine!

Very good. I use cream of mushroom soup and I can never find cream cheese with chives, so I just use plain and add green onions. Nice and creamy, great with a glass of Chard.

I was skeptical when my husband decided to try this recipe. Now it is one of my favorites. We substitute chicken broth for the wine and make only 3 chicken breasts because we love the sauce so much.

This is very good, it would be good on pasta alone too. I also substituted the wine with broth.

What a great new addition to my chicken recipes!  I added sauteed garlic and fresh spinach. I also doubled the sauce but I used light cream cheese and only 1/4 c. butter, just to make it a little bit lighter. I seared the chicken breasts in a frying pan before baking.  Thanks to the reviewers for all their tips to make this recipe truly outstanding.

I made this tonight and Wow..was it amazing.  Both my husband and toddler ate it up and they are both very picky eaters.  My husband even felt he was in some kind of great Italian restaurant eating the pasta and said I should definetly make it for guests next time!  Only thing I will do next time is double the sauce.  I also followed another review on here and sauteéd the chicken until almost done, set it aside, made the sauce then put it all in the oven for 30 minutes....chicken came out soooo tender.  So delicious!

This dish was disappointing much to my surprise.  It got such good ratings but my husband and I found it to be marginal at best.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Guess it's just not our taste.

This was really good. I did substitute half of the wine for chicken broth because the rest of my family doesn't care for wine. Turned out great!

This was truly fantastic, lemme tell you what I did to make it SO incredibly good...in a big frying pan on a stove I cooked 4 frozen chicken breasts until done with onion powder, garlic salt and pepper.  Took them out, cut up into bite-size pieces and set aside, in the same pan combined all of the sauce ingredients (starting with butter), subbing 1 1/2 cups chicken broth for the wine and adding an add'l can of Campbell's Chicken and Mushroom soup and the whole 8 oz tub of cream cheese with chives. Meanwhile I boiled the noodles (after reading all the reviews I decided on fetuccine as I realized this makes a thick sauce I didn't think angel hair would stand up to), adding a bunch of fresh chopped broccoli to the boiling noodles the last 3 minutes of cooking time. Drained the noodles/broccoli and combined everything in the original frying pan, stirred well, and served. Holy Mother of God was this ever good, the whole shebang took less than 45 minutes, it feeds a crowd, and I can tell it will make to-die-for leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  This is a keeper recipe for sure, thank you SO much for sharing!

Great recipe. I usually double the sauce. I've found it can also be adapted to make a great lasagna. I just boil the chicken so that I can shred it, then I mix it in with the sauce and use it to make a white lasagna. It's great because you can make it ahead of time and freeze it, and just whip it out when you don't have time to cook.

YUMMM! I did make a few changes like others.  First cube the chicken, it cooks faster! I put fresh ground pepper on the chicken before pouring the mixture over. I used chicken broth in place of the wine like others suggested because I don't like wine in my food. Then I added a can of extra mushrooms to the dish before puting it in the oven you could also use fresh if their on hand.  I also cooked the dish covered with tin foil until the last ten minutes to keep the chicken moist and it was nice and moist!  Also I used thick egg noodles because I am not big fan of angel pasta.  Last but not least I added steamed broccoli to the finished product and it was a great touch for color and texture.  Over all me and my boyfriend loved the dish next time i may use half the pack of italian dressing because it was a bit salty.  Other than that it was excellent with these modifications!

I was very surprised with this recipe. All the while I was cooking it, I was worried I wouldn't like the sauce. But, it turned out perfectly. Although, in my opinion, I think this sauce is more of a gravy, than a pasta sauce. So, I served my chicken over rice and it was just as delicious!

I used whole wheat linguine noodles and threw in fresh steamed broccoli.  I doubled the recipe. I felt the sauce was too thick. And I also used chicken broth instead of wine b/c i don't like wine.
Overall good recipe. My husband that doesnt like pasta actually finished his plate

I like this dish, it has a unique taste and is flavorful.  I made the mistake of tasting this sauce before it baked with the chicken and I really didn't like it... trust me and just wait until the dish is finished.  Since I'd already gone that far I figured I'd go ahead and finish and I was pleasantly surprised.  Great served with Creamy Cheese Bread from this site, it also has the italian mix.  Thanks!

I thought the sauce had grate taste but the chicken was so so!  I made a few changes: doubled the cream cheese and liquid, using 1/2 wine and 1/2 broth.  I added mushrooms, leeks, green onions, garlic and cherry tomatoes.  I would definitely use the veggies; otherwise it would be pretty bland.  I left half the sauce on the stove to serve with the pasta and put the other half over the chicken.  For some reason the sauce in the oven got WAY too thin.  It was just OKAY for me.

This recipe requires very little prep time and takes minimal effort - a perfect combination! I made this a few months ago and my husband and I really enjoyed it (even though we're both pretty picky eaters). Having been craving it for the past few days, I found time to cook and made it again tonight. It's in the oven right now and smells heavenly! The only thing I changed was leaving out the chives. Our local 'supermarket' doesn't seem to carry the cream cheese with chives, and I'm not very partial to them anyway. I can't wait until it's done!! Yum!

2019-
I make this so often it's crazy. The kids love it too! I have adapted it to work in the slow cooker - heat the sauce ingredients in the cooker and then stir them well before adding the chicken. My cooker can get it done in about 3 hours on high but based on the one you use, time can vary. After the chicken is cooked through I shred it and serve over the noodles. It's always a huge hit!

My man loved it! Added fresh garlic and mushrooms to the sauce...didn't have any white wine, so like others I used chicken broth. Also, I cut the chicken into chunks to reduce cooking time to 45 min. We'll be having it again!!

This was pretty good.  I agree with it being a little on the salty side though.  I will have to read the other reviews, make some alterations and hopefully make it into a 5 star recipe.

This pasta dish was very simple to make and delicious to boot!  I did follow the advice of others: double the sauce, cut the chicken to bite size pieces and add a package of frozen broccoli(thawed before hand).  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Changed the recipe per others and my own comments.  Used chicken tenders cut into smaller pieces.  Heavily seasoned them with mrs. dash, onion powder, garlic powder and sauteed in olive oil until slightly brown (did not cook through)  Removed.  Added 1/2 lb sliced onion to pan along with sliced green scallon.  Sauteed in chicken broth.  Combined warmed regular cream of mushroom soup with dressing mix, butter and 6 oz plain cream cheese.  Stirred until melted.  Added more chicken broth and ch8ives and whipped until no lumps.  Preboiled penne until done.  Added to skillet with sauce.  Added chicken.  Covered to continue to cook.  Sauce was right consistency and chicken plump and juicy.  Didn't bake in oven at all.  Excellent.  Not too salty because of increase of other ingredients.

Great recipe, very rich and tasty, while easy to make.  I put everything in the crockpot for 4 hrs on high.  After reading other reviews, I also doubled the sauce, except for the Italian salad dressing mix.  The golden mushroom soup and wine is a delicious combination.

My husband and I thought this was good, but not great.  As per other reviewers (and myself after trying the sauce in the pan) disliking the salt, I diluted the sauce by adding 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup broth and adding some cornstarch to thicken.  I thought it was good though, but maybe thats because I drank the rest of the bottle of wine!!!  :)  My husband thought I should not have diluted it, as he is older and likes more flavor.

Yummy : ) This one is a keeper. My changes were: Broth instead of wine, regular cream cheese, and I added grated parmesan. Easy and whole family enjoyed.

This recipe was outstanding.. I have made it several times and changed a couple things this time around. Instead of baking the chicken this time, we put it on the grill to save on time.  I then transferred the chicken to a baking dish and poured the sauce over the chicken and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  I also added fresh sauteed mushrooms to the sauce. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious! I used Neufchâtel cream cheese, which is  lower in fat, a lot softer, but tastes pretty much the same as regular cream cheese. I used a splash more white wine than listed, added some chopped sun dried tomatoes in oil, freshly minced garlic while making the sauce, and in the end, stirred in fresh basil leaves. I couldn't find any golden mushroom soup, so I just used regular mushroom soup.

This should get 5 stars.  I have made this over and over and get RAVE reviews from everyone! I do add a little more wine and mushrooms.  But so fool proof! If your stuck and need to come up with something this is the recipe!!!

The Italian dressing gave it an unique flavor, which was quite good. Will make with my preferences of: chicken cut-up in bite size, the sauce doubled, add mixed veggies, substituting 1/2 the wine w/chicken broth, & cooked on low for a few hours in my slow cooker (adding the veggies the last hour only) Then,over a penne & rotini pasta mix. I think that would be closer to the 5 star recipe. Thank you for the new recipe idea!

I did not enjoy this recipe. I found that the wine overwhelmed the dish--and really that's the only flavor I could taste. If I attempt this dish again, I'd omit the wine and perhaps change the dressing mix to another flavor.

Very good. I served it with penne pasta. Don't salt the pasta water. The sauce is salty enough. I will use this recipe again. It was so easy. Perfect for a quick weekday dinner. Thanks!

Made this for Fathers Day and it was a  huge hit with the family.  Next time I will double the sauce and use penne pasta instead of angel hair.  I'm already thinking pork chops with this sauce. It would be good on rice too.

This was really, really good.  We used penne pasta instead of the angel hair and it was fantastic.  I definitely will double the sauce next time though.  I thought using half the chicken would make enough of a difference, but it still didn't make enough sauce.  It was great though!

This recipe is fabulous!!  One of my favs, I made a couple of changes after making it several times.  I dice up Roma tomatoes, a bit of chives (instead of the cream cheese with chives, only because I grow herbs so its just as easy to run outside and chop)and mushrooms.  The sauce is so good with the added veggies, you don't even need the chicken.  Sometimes I make it with, sometimes without, depends on my mood.  Try it, you will pass this recipe on, everyone loves it!

This was very good.  I used 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup wine, 1 package Italian Seasoning, 1 can of the golden mushroom soup, and 6 ounces low fat cream chz as well as a container of sliced mushrooms.  I had plenty of sauce with this combination.  I also didn't find it salty-could be those that did used salted butter?  This is very rich and went well with a salad with a lite vinaigrette!

I feel terrible that we didn't like this dish more!  I've had this recipe on file for years waiting for my store to stock Golden Mushroom Soup.  I finally was rewarded last week and I immediately tried this recipe.  I found it extremely salty but otherwise quite bland.  I also thought that Angel Hair Pasta was not the right pasta for this heavy sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and probably won't try it again.

After reading pages of great reviews, I decided to try this tonight & I'm so happy I did...Changes- I used chicken broth instead of wine & reg cream of mushroom soup cause I couldn't find the goldens. Out of 4 people, my picky 6 yr old was the only one who didn't like it (he hates everything though). Although it was yummy, the next time we will try a thicker pasta, like penne instead of the angel hair. Mmmm!!

This was good.  I also doubled the sauce and used chicken broth in lieu of wine.. cut the chicken breast in bite size pieces and added some steamed broccoli and carrots into the sauce as well.  The family loved it with spinach noodles!

My husband and I were looking for pasta but with a different sauce than the traditional tomato or alfredo.  This was so good and light.  You can substitute the butter for Smart Balance Light and you'd never know the difference.  We also used the Barilla Plus thin spaghetti.  The only thing we didn't like was that it was very salty. Next time, we'll probably reduce the Golden Mushroom soup to half.  That's where a lot of the sodium came from.

An all time favorite. Tried it years ago, an have been making it regularly since. Everyone has commented on its great aroma and taste. And it is so easy, especially when you are preparing for a large crowd of people and don't want to be slaving in the kitchen up until the last moment. Wasn't surprised to see it as a top recipe!

This recipe was fabulous!  At first I was skeptical about the italian dressing but once it hit the hot butter the house smelled amazing!  I used chicken tenders instead of whole breasts and I thought they were perfect.  I also didn't use as much chicken and there was just the right about of sauce.  I would probably double the amount of sauce if I was making it for very many people.  I served this over egg noodles since that was the only pasta I had on hand.  Awesome recipe!

This is absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any white wine so I used chicken broth.  It was so flavorful.  It is easy to make and I had very little dishes to clean up.  We will definitely put this in our dinner rotation.  I will try it in the crock pot the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

we didn't have the dressing mix or cream cheese with chives on hand. I threw in some oregano and sour cream instead. This was eaten up quicker than chocolate cake. My daughter, who only eats noodles butter and cheese, wolfed it down and asked for 3rds. I am only giving it 4 stars cause I didn't use all the ingredients in the recipe. but it was definately 5 stars.

I made quite a few modifications to this recipe, as did many other reviewers and my family LOVED it!!!  
I sauteed cubed chicken in olive oil with a small amount of seasoning then removed from pan.  Made a sauce using butter, added some shredded carrots & sauteed a little, 1/2 pkt italian dressing mix, cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 c chicken broth & plain cream cheese.  Stired till all smooth & warm, then added chicken back in and simmered covered for around 10 min until chicken was cooked thru.  Then I boiled some fresh broccoli crowns in boiling water for a few minutes (my familyl likes mushy broccoli and my kids eat their veggies better if they are really cooked and hidden in the food!), then cooked the angel hair pasta about 4 min till al-dente.  Drained and tossed together with sauce.  My husband loved it and my 2 picky toddlers inhaled it!  Will make this again and again!
Thanks for sharing this recipe and thanks to all the other reviewers for sharing their modifications.

This recipe is awesome!  Easily adapted to the slow cooker.  I sauteed some green onions and lots of sliced mushrooms in the butter and italian dressing mix before adding the other ingredients.  I also used plain cream cheese.  The outcome was awesome.  I will make this again and again! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

Very good.  The entire family liked it.  I was in a time crunch, so I used chicken cutlets and browned them in the butter/seasoning, then pulled them out and finished making the sauce.  Then I baked for 30 minutes.  Served with the angel hair pasta and thought it was wonderful.

This is really delicious.  The only change I made was that I chopped up the chicken into pieces so it would cook faster & I mixed it in with the pasta and sauce.  Turned out wonderfully b/c then every bite was covered with sauce!  Freezes really well, too.

This recipe was great. We all loved it. I don't know what those other people were talking about when they gave it a bad review.... maybe they just don't know how to cook...... :)

this recipe tastes good, but at 1200 mgs of sodium per serving, it is WAY too salty.  to cut down on sodium, I doubled the sauce by adding a can of 50% less sodium chicken broth. I first added a little flour to the butter to thicken up the broth, then mixed in the golden mushroom soup and rest of ingredients.    also only added HALF of the seasoning packet...it really doesn't need more.

I loved this! I pretty much followed the reviews of everyone else ex.. cut up ck and browned , doubled the sauce used 1/2 wine and 1/2 ck broth, left butter the same (probably could have used less tho)added green onion and some mushrooms , garlic powder and s&p. I also used wide egg noodles. I thought after all the changes tho, that it tasted alot like a Chicken stroganoff.. I think next time I will try the breasts over fettucine.. soo good tho! 
thank you!

My husband loved this.  It was almost as creamy as an alfredo sauce but with much more flavor.  I pounded the chicken because I like thin chicken.  I also didn't have cream cheese with chives so I used regular cream cheese and added green onions.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was EXCELLANT! If I could give it 10 stars I would.  I cut up the chiken in chunks, floured the chicken and browned it in butter.  I then doubled the sauce and poured over the chicken and cooked it for about thirty minutes.  I should have tripled the sauce.  I served it with noodles to 9 hungry people who ate every bit and licked the pan clean.  I have been asked by each of the 9 people to please cook it again immediately.  It was sooooo good that I WANT to cook it again already.  It was easy and delicious.

My Mom kept telling me to make this recipe but I was hesitant.  What an amazing recipe!  I cooked mine in the crockpot for about 3 hours and it was so easy and delicious. My husband said it was the best dish ever. I didn't change a thing.

I'm giving this one 5 stars for my husband and roommate.  I feel that it is well deserving of 4-1/2 but that it should be made with at thicker pasta than angel hair.  The sauce was delicious, but just too think for angel hair.  I added slices of onion and mushroom before covering the baking dish with sauce.  Great recipe with modifications!

Great recipe.  Husband loved it, I thought it was pretty good.  Added some artichoke hearts for a little extra something and served over penne pasta, which was perfect for the thickness of the sauce.

Following suggestions, I doubled the soup and cream cheese and cooked together in pan instead of baking.  If I make it again, I won't change anything (excpet, maybe, to add fresh mushrooms).  There seemed to be too much sauce and was almost too rich for me.  My boyfriend said he liked it, but he only had one serving, which is unusual.  He also suggested something besides angel hair.  It will be awhile before I try this again.

Excellent! Doubled the sauce, but only put half of the white wine it called for, tasted great and expensive.  An easy recipe that would impress.

This is incredible easy and so delicious. The last time I made this for a family get together, a couple of my nieces were like, "Ew, I don't eat chicken" and later they were asking for seconds. Especially the sauce. This is always a winner!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used Linguine because I hate angel hair. I was not that impressed and neither was my family. We all ate it but probably will not make again.  I do think its necessary to double the sauce and maybe quickly brown the chicken before it goes in the oven so it will have a better appearance.

This was surprisingly very good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used my favorite Pinot Grigiot and it turned out fantastic!  My main problem was that the sauce was a little bit too thick considering that angel hair pasta was to be used.  Next time I make this I will most likely use linguine instead and add a little chicken stock to get the sauce to my preferred consistency.
My almost-3 year old son even ate this willingly...THAT is an accomplishment!
Great recipe! Give it a try!

My family and I 'liked' this recipe, and we all decided on 3 stars.  I'm really surprised because it has a 5star rating from so many reviewers so I expected another 5star quality meal.  I followed the recipe exactly, but maybe the sauce just did not meet to our tastes.  I felt that the golden mushroom soup was too strong, and mixing that with white wine did not improve on it.  I probably won't be making this again, but if I did I would use chicken thighs instead of breast meat, or if I used breasts I would lower the cooking time so the breasts would be a little more tender.  For those who are more keen on casseroles and thick-sauce flavored dishes, this would probably work for you!

Very good dish and relatively simple to make. Served to dinner guests who loved it! I will make this again but I did double the recipe for the sauce. The sauce is thick and rich like alfredo so I think I'll use linguine noodles instead. Tastes similar to chicken marsala because of the wine.

Yummm!!

I couldn't find golden mushroom soup (pity!) and just used the normal type; halved the recipe; left half the 'sauce' to bake with the chicken and cooked the other half over the stovetop with zucchini, carrots, red and yellow peppers; finally combining the baked + cooked together onto the pasta.

Mmmm!! Had it completely licked off the plate =)

If it's possible to give 6 stars I would!  I was hesitant to make this b/c alot of the reviews said it was too salty.  The truth is that if you taste the sauce when you first combine the ingredients together, it will be salty.  Give time for the juices from the chicken to mix with the sauce and you'll be amazed at how good this recipe is.  So easy to put together as well.  Make sure to use a good quality white wine too.

This was a very good dish...elegant but simple to make.  Added asparagus and home baked bread.  Everyone gave a 4 star.

Only cooked for 30 minutes as experience has taught me our oven cooks chicken breasts in about 30 minutes.

It's a keeper!

Hmmm... I don't know what is was about this recipe but something was off.  My 3 year old loved it, my husband said that it had potential, and I don't really know what I thought about it. First of all, I can say that you need to use bigger pasta- even if its only spaghetti, I would use linguine because the sauce is pretty heavy and the angel-hair doesnt have a chance.  Also, the wine taste was pretty srong so maybe use only a 1/4 cup and substitute chicken broth for the rest or even milk. It was different and I didn't dislike it but I really wouldn't say 5 stars.  It has easiness on its side though. I would try again I guess with modifications.  For now.. 3 1/2.

Very tasty!  I use chicken broth instead of the wine and place chicken in crockpot, combine rest of ingredients in saucepan and cook till blended and then pour over chicken.  Cook on low for 4-5 hours.  Serve over noodles.  Very tasty this way!!

Very easy and tasty change of pace. I lightly dusted the chicken with cajun spices and browned in a few drops of olive oil, then baked with indirect heat on the grill. Serve with home made egg noodles.. Awsome!

This recipe was out of this world.  My husband said I out did myself.  That always makes a cook feel good! :-) I didn't have any wine so I substituted it with chicken broth.  This meal makes you feel like you are eating at a nice italian restaurant!!  Thanks!

ok, this is really good.  I have made this several times and really like it.  I have made it with cream of mushroom and golden mushroom soups...the golden mushroom is by far better.  Also like other reviewers I suggest doubling the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe

Very good and the chicken comes out nice and tender. I used reduced fat cream cheese the first time I made it and did not like the result as much as when I used regular cream cheese. I always just add dried chives or fresh if I have them, instead of using the flavored cream cheese. Anyway, next time around I'm going to make this in the crock pot as others have suggested. Thanks for submitting this "keeper"!

This was a very good recipe, but very salty.  Next time I make it, I will use unsalted butter to cut the salt back a little.  Very easy to make and very tasty!!  Thanks.....

I made this quickie style because I didn't have 60 minutes.  Put all the makings of the sauce in a sauce pan and added 1 1/2 cups skim milk.  Heated through.  Cooked 6 frozen boneless skinless breasts in the micro til done.  Chopped chicken and added to the sauce.  Meanwhile boiled the pound of angel hair.  Placed angel hair on pretty platter and poured the sauce and chicken over top and sprinkled with fresh chopped green onion.  Done in 20 minutes!! And looked so pretty too!  Thanks!

I've been making this dish for years but have modified it both in cooking directions and to add more sauce.  I sprinkle the Italian dressing mix over the chicken and brown it in a small mix of butter and oil.  Meanwhile, mix 3 cans of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup Sherry Cooking Wine and the entire round dish of WHIPPED cream cheese w/chives.  Pour all into a baking dish and bake at 350 for 45 minutes.  Great with noodles. Family and friend favorite for at least 15 years!

WOW! This is really good and I am not a huge fan of recipes that use condensed soup.  I quadruple this recipe. I know sounds a bit much but read on!  There are 4 envelopes in the dressing box and 4 servings of wine in the bottle and some for me to enjoy while I make this.  I divide the giant batch into 4 resealable freezer bags, freeze, and viola! There's four dinners ready to go from freezer to the oven and oh so easy for my hubby to throw in when I'm running late for dinner.  I partially thaw the sauce bag in the microwave, place my chicken in a casserole dish, pour sauce over chicken and follow as directed.  I also gave this premade delectable to a good friend for her b-day along with pasta, a lovely bowl, of course the recipe, and a few other fun things.  She loved it and I'm sure you will too! The best part is that it freezes well and bakes up as "good eats"...

Next time don't cook the chicken as long.  Forgot to double the soup.  Added mushrooms and lots of white wine.

I just made this dish for dinner and my family loved it.  I made a variation of it, by cooking the chicken (tenderloins) on a frying pan with some olive oil and Mrs. Dash seasoning.  I cut them into smaller pieces and added some whole mushrooms.  I made the sauce with just half the italian seasoning and regular cream cheese and poured it over.  I didn't even put it in the oven-- quick and simple.  Very good recipe. My husband gets so excited when I tell him we're having this dish for dinner-- he doesn't get sick of it!

This is my favorite dinner to cook, both for family and for guests. It's easy, and everyone I make it for loves it - I have been asked to share the recipe every time. It goes wonderfully with fresh steamed vegetables; I like zucchini and green beans.

My only tip - and this is a big one - make 1-1/2 times the sauce, or even double it. My family much prefers this meal when there is enough sauce to cover both the chicken and all of the pasta once the chicken is gone.

My family loved this recipe.  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce- used low sodium broth instead of white wine, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 Italian seasoning packet and 2 cans of soup.  It is a very good family dish.  It is quite salty- We like that about it, but you may not.  Best of all, it's divine as a leftover dish.  Even after I ran out of chicken, I was heating up the noodles and sauce.  Yum!

This was great. I did listen to the other reviewers and change the ingredient amounts a bit: cut up chicken breasts into strips, package of italian dressing mix. 8 oz cream cheese with chives and onions, 1 stick of butter, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, 3/4 c. of chicken broth(instead of wine). I also cooked it for an extra half hour (I am picky about meat being really well-done) 
It was excellent and we had lots and lots of leftovers! It was not salty at all. Even my 6 and 2 yr old enjoyed it! Thank you for the great recipe!

I love this recipe and so does my family.  I agree it is a bit salty, but to solve that you just add a cubed raw potato to the sauce and let it cook until it is tender - takes out all the saltiness.  I added green onions and fresh mushrooms.  I've also made it with shrimp - YUM.  Enjoy !!

I LOVED this!  I made it with whole wheat angel hair instead, and I thought it went very well together.  Even my super-picky boyfriend who never likes anything said, "I feel like I am eating out in a fancy restaurant."  The flavors were fabulous, it was SO easy to make, and definitely was not too salty.  I only used four chicken breasts so we would have some sauce left over for the pasta.  Delicious!!

I tried this recipe twice.  First time a bit salty but great flavor.  The second time I used plain cream cheese (that's all I had) but added a tablespoon or so of minces shallots.  I also added 1 package of frozen spinach thawed and water squeezed out. IT WAS GREAT!  I think the spinach increased the sauce as well as decreased the level of saltiness.

My whole family enjoyed this. I added fresh sliced mushrooms, capers and artichoke hearts, and it was quite the hit. The sauce was awesome, and even the 2 year old ate it without complaining! This is going to be in the family recipe box!

I would give this ten stars if I could.  The only thing I would change is to double the sauce so that there is plenty for the pasta.

I wish I could give it a zero, it was edible but thats all I can say! How could over 700 people give this rave reviews, I thought surely it had to be great, WRONG! It was a waste of $15 in ingredients. It was very bland, the flavors didnt go together, it was like something off the sid of the soup can, nothing more. And how are people serving this over pasta? When you make it you will see it is definetly something for over white rice. It was something like a chicken stroganoff?

I made this recipe for the first time, tonight.  It was really good, I followed others suggestions and doubled the sauce, (only using one packet of Ranch, though, as suggested.)  I didn't brown or season the chicken first, mostly because I was hoping it would turn out great without having too, but I was wrong.  For me, the chicken tasted like bland chicken with sauce on it.  It was tender, but I would at least season it really good before adding it to the pan.  I used a Pinot Grigio for the wine and it didn't taste strongly at all.  My 3 year old gobbled it up!
Thanks for the recipe!

crock pot method is the way I make it.  Throw eveything in the pot in the morning, and when I get home....it's magnificent!  Chicken is frozen and i have yet to mix the sauce before I pour it over.  Plus, it makes more sauce than the oven method.

I didn't like it one little bit and I am glad to see that there a few out there who agree. It was bland, the sauce was thick and it was missing something. Never ever again.
01/09/05- I made the mistake and attempted it again. This time I added diced tomatoes, chili peppers and red peppers and it was still awful. I believe I have learnt my lesson and I have thrown the recipe away. 2 THUMBS DOWN. IF YOU DON'T LIKE CREAM SAUCES, SKIP THIS ONE.

Quick and super easy, sure to please. I did not saute the chicken before hand and everyone still commented on how tender and juicy the chicken was. I did double the sauce and cooked the chicken for 20 minutes longer than stated. Will definitely use this again!

Disappointed but with changes this could be better. First of all, I do think you need to double the sauce. Secondly, I prefer to just grill or pan fry my chicken and serve on a bed of pasta and then pour the sauce over from the stove - no need to bake. Also, I think it is important to season the chicken with some pepper and garlic, and any spices to your liking, to liven it up a bit. I definitely think that the sauce needs some broth or liquid in it to thin it down a bit. Baking this all together made it too thick for my liking. It is very salty, but that is what you get when you use the Italian seasoning packets.

This is one of my family's favorites.  The only changes that I have made is to adapt it to my slow cooker - it makes an easy recipe even easier!  To make it in the slow cooker I cut up and saute the chicken first, put it in the cooker with all the other ingredients and add 1 can of chicken broth/stock (this helps it to make tons of sauce).  I then let it cook for about 5 hours on low and voila...great dinner!

I've used this recipe regularly now, with a simple modification that leaves no room for error. I toss the chicken on the grill, then slice/shred it up and add it to the sauce. Serve it over the pasta like a spaghetti sauce. This version works well for leftovers!

This was VERY easy to make and very tasty.  The sauce tasted salty while I was heating it, but it was perfect after the dish was cooked.  I used nice fat Perdue boneless breast halves cut in quarters and the chicken was tender & juicy.

I prepared this recipe exactly according to instructions and found there was plenty of sauce and then some so I was confused by the comments of others who did not end up with enough sauce; also, the salt content was fine, in fact, the soup made it so that it required no additional salt; it is important to remember with this recipe that you use GOLDEN MUSHROOM SOUP and NOT Cream of Mushroom...might explain some user's comment about "blandness"....

This is wonderful and so easy. Everyone in my family loves this. It sort of tastes like stroganoff except with chicken. The sauce is so good that I recommend doubling it, so there's plenty to spoon over the chicken and coat the noodles. Very, very good - suitable for company!

This is an excellent dish. I've cooked it twice....once according to the recipe, and the second time I had to use a pkg. of Ranch dressing in place of the Italian seasoning. The Ranch dressing seems to compliment the cream cheese w/chives better. I personally think the Ranch dressing is better, but either way is a winner!

This is probably my favorite chicken & pasta recipe. It's very easy, but so impressive. 

The only ingredients exchange I make--when I can't find exact ingredients--is cream of mushroom for golden mushroom soup and plain cream cheese plus a sprinkling of chives for cream cheese with chives. I also use  sauted boneless chicken strips when I don't have as much time; combine with the sauce and you're done.

Yummy! This recipe was so easy to make and low mainenance, which is a definate bonus with 4 kids! I butterflied the chicken to cut down on the baking time, and served it topped with grated romano. I am quite surprised by how many people in these reviews have replaced the wine....that is one of the main ingredients that make this dish delicious!

It was instantly a family favorite. I have made a few alterations, I chunk the chicken so it's easier to eat, I use chicken broth instead of wine, I add a can of mushrooms (or fresh) & sometimes I use the "zesty" Italian dressing packet. I've even used "garden vegetables" cream cheese instead of chive & onion. As the cookbook stated it indeed  seems like a restuarant quality meal, good enough to serve company (keep the chicken breast whole though for prettier presentation). Everyone I've ever served it to has LOVED it.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now and have changed it a little bit to serve to company.
I use pasta twists instead of the angle hair,always double the sauce, and add steamed vegtables when mixing sauce with pasta.  I also cut chicken into bit size pieces, and sometimes I will do half wine and half broth. My guests have really liked this one dish dinner.

This chicken is so delicious!  Actually, it's the sauce that makes it so good.  Sometimes I just make the sauce to put over pasta.

This was very good. Next time I probably won't put as much wine in, or I'll water it down. I don't like a recipe that I can tell has wine in it and that was the only flaw I saw with this recipe. My husband had thirds, which is definitely a good sign. Left-overs were also very good. Thanks for sharing!

This pasta was delicious!!  I did change/add a few things though.  I cut up the chicken into bite size chunks and seasoned with a little  garlick salt and pepper. Then when I was melting the butter and adding the italian seasoning ect.  I also added one small can of sliced mushrooms, some green onion (didn't have chive cream cheese, so I used regular and added green onion), and some sliced black olives. Then, I continued with the recipe as directed except that I used chicken broth in place of the wine. After the angel hair pasta was done and the chiken sauce was done, I just combined it all together and put it into a HUGE (this makes a lot)serving bowl, and it was beautiful with a little fresh parsely garnish on top. I served a fresh tossed salad and some bagette bread on the side.  My family of four had enough left overs for lunch the next day.  And let me tell you!!! It tasted even better than the day before!! This is HEAVENLY!!  Thanks so much Marian.
P.S. I made this lowfat by using 98% fat free mushroom soup, low fat cream cheese, and the "I Can't Believe It's not Butter" Spray in place of the butter.  It was still wonderful.  I didn't miss a single fat gram or any flavor!!

This recipe was okay - the cream cheese did not really mix well with the other sauce ingredients-even after softening cream cheese in the micro.  The result looked like an orange sauce cottage cheese.  After working with the sauce to blend it better, it turned out fine.  Angel hair pasta is the best type of pasta for this dish.  Although it was pretty good, it was exactly a big hit at my house.

great EASY recipe,  Like other reviews, I sliced the chicken in strips which shortened cook time. I would next time use no-salt butter. I doubled the sauce and used 1/2 the wine (my kids don't like any wine flavor) I placed raw fresh broccoli tops over it then added the sauce.

I have been making this for 4 years,now. I had to print out another copy. It was getting really worn. I use Philadelia Brand Onion and Chive Cream Cheese. I also cut the chicken into slivers and use the Good Seasons Zesty Italian mix. This is a staple, at our house.  We love it!

I made this last night. It was a hit.  I used the idea of adding fresh mushrooms, green onions, and garlic.  I sauteed them in butter.  Then I sliced the chicken breasts and cooked them on the stovetop as well.  That really speeds things up.  It was quick and different.  Will add to my favorites list!

This is a great recipe. I use Tofutti Cream Cheese for less fat, I lessen the amount of Italian dressing since its a little salty. Over-all its a fast and easy recipe.  Delicious too!

YUM!  Okay, so I totally went against tradition and did not read the reviews until AFTER I went to the store.  I knew from reading the reviews that I would need to double the sauce recipe, but I didn't have an extra Italian dressing or another can of soup.  Here's what I did.  I marinated the chicken breasts in fat free Italian dressing.  Then I doubled the butter and wine, used 8 oz of fat free cream cheese, added the 1 Italian seasoning packet and the can of soup and 1 envelope of Lipton's Garlic Mushroom.  WE ATE IT ALL!  YUMMY!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious - the cream cheese really gives the sauce a nice smoothness!  I have made it twice, and found the flavours a little overpowering the first time, so I left out the Italian Seasoning, and instead just minced a clove of garlic into the sauce for a lighter flavour.  Very yummy, and easy too!

Delicious!  My hubby LOVED this and really raved about it.  It is very flavorful -- not sure if it's the white wine, the Italian seasonings or the cream cheese that gives it that "punch", but it does have a little "kick" to it.  My hubby and I even made sandwiches the next day w/ the left overs (we doubled the chicken) and they were excellent.  I really enjoyed the pasta too.  I haven't found that many really good chicken and pasta dishes, so this was a nice change and will become a regular at our dinner table.

Update 1/26/08:  I finally made this recipe a second time and took it down to 4 stars instead of 5.  This time I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested and added one pound sliced fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Well, there was too much sauce and it was salty from the seasoning packets and the condensed soup, just overpowering.  Honestly, that sauce is strong-flavored so you don't need to double it, really.  A little goes a long way.  If you double your sauce, I would NOT double the amount of the Italian seasoning.  Perhaps, that was my problem.  Next time, I won't double the sauce, I will add the fresh mushrooms again, and will use a bigger pasta.

My original review from years ago:  Really very good.  Tastes like chicken paprikash without the zing.  I was skeptical of using canned soup and dried Italian dressing mix, but I tried the recipe because of its rave reviews.  We were not disappointed!  Served over river rice the second night and that was also fantastic.

Wow! This recipe is quite tasty and powerful!  I did this with few modifications:  I decided to fry the chicken covered with italian bread crumbs, in pan with butter.  When they were lightly browned, I set them aside in the 9 x 11 baking pan.  I double the ingredients except wine and italian dry seasoning to make more sauce.  I also added mushrooms at the beginning when I was making the sauce.   

It turned out great and the chicken was awesome.  However, I must give this four star because for two reasons:  The sauce was too rich for my taste and it wasn't quite restaurant quality.  I know I am too picky but I would make this recipe again!

Fantastic. My husband and I both loved it. The chicken turned out so moist and the sauce was wonderful. To make it quicker sometime, I may cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and saute. I highly recommend this.

This received rave reviews at my house from my husband and two kids.  I prepared according to the directions, although I only had 4 chicken breast halves--we had just enough sauce.  If I used the six breast halves called for in the recipe, I think I would probably double the sauce (it is rich and thick).

I just loved this recipe!  My sister made it first and I thought it tasted like restaurant food!  I like to pre-cute the chicken into chunks, add it to the sauce, then bake it.  *TIP - If you like mushrooms, saute some fresh pre-sliced mushrooms in 2TBS of the same white wine you use for the recipe and 1TBS of butter.  Add the mushrooms  to the sauce before pouring over the chicken.  Yummm!!!

This recipe was pretty good, a little too salty for me.  I think the sauce would be much better with a little less of the dressing mix or with more liquid.  Lots of potential, so I'll try it again with some changes.

Oh my Goodness!  This is a wonderful recipe.  YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  Thank you so much for adding this recipe to this site...it is a great recipe.  The only change I made- was that I halved the amount of chicken because I am not a big chicken eater and enjoy the sauce more.  I am so glad I did...the sauce is AMAZING!!! Thank You for a wonderful recipe.  YUM! :)

Awesome!  I cooked the chicken on the stove and diced it up then made the pasta sauce seperately--this left a lot of extra sauce for the pasta I just mixed the chicken into the sauce and threw it over the pasta--definitely easier when you don't have as much time. This is now our favorite pasta recipe and my boyfriend even saved the leftovers and re-heated them for lunch which is unheard of!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce ingredients except for the dressing mix.  However, I also made a few other tiny changes.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so I used cream of broccoli condensed soup instead.  In addition, when I put the meal together I put steamed broccoli ontop of the angel hair pasta and then topped it with the chicken and lots of sauce.  This was truly delicious and received rave reviews from my boyfriend.

This was wonderful.  My hubby and kids loved it.  We doubled the sauce batch, but next time I will add only one salad dress mix pouch, and replace with my own seasonings.  We served this over rice instead of pasta.  Loved the flavor the white wine gave the sauce.  Made excellent leftovers for the most flavorful chicken sandwiches. Thanks!

I have to say, I was not very impressed with this recipe.  It definitley wasn't the worst thing I'd ever had but I won't ever make it again.  The leftovers just sat in my fridge and I had to throw them out...and I live in a house of 4 poor starving college girls!

I have 6 kids and one husband and I really like recipes that are easy to prepare and this one sure was. Out of the 6 kids only one didn't care for this dish, the rest really liked it. my husband thought it was quite good. I have been testing new recipes on my family that I have found on this site nearly every day for the last 3 weeks and they are eager for me to cook some of their OLD favorites but I am having way too much fun!

I really enjoyed this dish. The sauce is very flavorful, and the chicken comes out very tender. I made a few minor changes, I thinned the sauce out with some milk, and used about 2 TB. butter as 1/4 cup seemed unecessary. It is a bit salty, but over the angel hair the sauce was perfect. Even my boyfriend loved it, and its difficult to get him to like chicken.

I revised this recipe toward a Mediterranean flair by adding a can of artichoke hearts chopped, along with the juice, and about a dozen kalamata olives, sliced. I also pound the chicken breasts a bit. They're SOOO tender. It's great over rice!

Delicious!! Made this with Italian Herb chicken broth instead of white wine and it was great.  A little to spicy for my toddler had to make her a seperate meal.  Next time will stick to the regular chicken broth so the whole family can eat it. Will make again.

Wonderful recipe. Used egg noodles instead of angel hair. The sauce was definitely the highlight of the meal. Trying to figure if it would be better with shrimp.

I really loved this recipe. It is often hard to find things that the kids will eat without complaining, but with this dish,they all but licked the plate. Next time I will make more sauce with it and less noodles, but that is all that I would adjust. I loved the flavor of the different ingredients. I prepared it exactly by the recipe and the chicken was so tender. It was also quick and easy, pop it in the oven and wait! Loved it!

It's surprising that something so simple could taste so good!  I added mushrooms to the butter and italian dressing before adding the wine and soup.  I also added some strips of red pepper right before serving.  Delicious!
The other night when I made this again I also added some cream of mushroom soup.  It worked out really well and we had a litle more sauce to dip some bread in later.

This recipe was really good. I've made it twice. I substitued chicken broth for the wine, i didn't have any chives so i omitted that, and i used Italian dressing instead of the dry mix. I also doubled the sauce mixture and used chicken tenders. Very very good!

I was surprised at how great this was - after reading about the blandness of the chicken, I put a fresh basil leaf, fresh rosemary sprig, fresh thyme and cracked pepper on each piece of chicken before pouring the sauce over it.  WONDERFUL!

This was really good.  I also doubled the sauce, added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and used linguine (hate angel hair pasta). Next time though, I think I'll cut up the chicken and saute that too (as others suggested).

I tasted the sauce before baking it with the chicken and was nervous about the pungent taste. However, the flavors mix well during baking and came out delicious.

We really liked this dish.  I cubed chicken breasts first, then made the sauce in a large skillet -- added the chicken into the skillet and baked it like that. The sauce was too thick for us, so I added 1/2 a can of chicken broth.  Next time I'm going to try low-fat cream cheese and bowtie-shaped pasta.  It was great.

This is VERY good!!! Definitely a keeper.  Like other reviews, it was a bit on the salty side, but the next time I make it, I will use unsalted butter instead. (The cream cheese and seasoning contributes enough sodium).  Thanks, Marian!!

I'm a pathetic cook but this turned out awesome. I couldn't believe how easy it was to make! The sauce is pretty heavy though, so pair it with a crisp green salad and some Chardonnay. I also recommend melting the cream cheese before mixing it in with the sauce - it will blend better. Looking forward to making it for my boyfriend - he'll love it!

This is really good.  I used the entire package of cream cheese with chives, only four chicken breast, and 10 ounces of pasta.  The proportions were just right.

I too couldn't wait to try this recipe because all the reviews were so favorable. It was way to sour for our tastes and as it cooked - the smell in the house was AWFUL! The wine and italian mix combination was definately NOT a hit for us.

We loved this recipes. We added steamed brocolli & doubled the sauce. Extra sauce is a must! Next time I would brown chicken. Also think this would be great without chicken, just plain or with sauted veggies.

2/12/11  - Update.  I think I reviewed this about 10 years ago.  I make ths several times a year.  Just served it for a special Valentine's Day dinner.  Added mushrooms and doubled the sauce.  Still as wonderful as ever.  

Definitely a keeper.  I feel like I'm eating in a gourmet restaurant when I serve this.  I will make it next time I have guests for dinner.

A delicious dish - delicate flavors - beautiful presentation with fresh chive sprinkled on top.  I was worried before I put it in to bake - but it was fantastic. MUST double the sauce.  Cream cheese with chive has been discontinued - used cream cheese and 2 tbl dried chive.  Bellisimo!

This is delicious!  The sauce has such a good flavor.  My husband and I both loved it and will definitely make this again soon.  I might even try just putting the sauce over pasta and skip the chicken for a meatless meal.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It's our new favorite!

A wonderful dish! My whole family loved it.  I lightly floured and browned the chicken first, and then made the sauce in the same pan. I also left out the wine. Be sure to double the recipie. We were glad we had leftovers.  A MUST TRY!

I will make this again, it was. comedy of errors getting this meal to the table.  Went to store, the Italian seasoning never made it out of the shopping cart.  Ran to the neighborhood store, bought it and stuck it in jacket pocket.  Time to make the sauce it couldn’t be found.  I made do with some dry Italian Seasonings.  The family liked it, I suspect it I had the dry salad dressing it would have had more flavor.  I’m rarely happy with the way things turn out.  Makes my wife mad when I pout about the results.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I’ve made it many times and now make these changes.  I layer baby Bella mushrooms on the bottom of the dish first. Then put rinsed chicken tenders on top and  sprinkle with black pepper.  Cook 40 minutes at 325.  I double the sauce using low sodium soup and add a finely chopped garlic clove.  Use wine in the sauce for better depth of flavor and we prefer mini bow tie pasta. This recipe is a keeper!

Even my kids will eat this one!  We serve over rice instead of pasta, and I use chicken broth instead of wine.  I also make this in the slow cooker - I just mix the ingredients together as directed and then pour over the chicken and cook it on low for 7 hours.  Turns out great every time!

Made in slow cooker for 5 hrs on low.  Very tasty and the meat was tender.  
Mixed all ingredients in slow cooker first then added 4 chicken breasts.  
Changes from other reviews, the sauce sounded thick so I added one cup of milk.  Perfect!  Also added 1/2 teaspoon each of dried oregano and basil.

Sauce was a little salty but if you add a few tablespoons of water is mellows it out. The sauce really was the best part of the recipe. I would definitely cook it again.

I actually make this using halibut (I live in Juneau, AK), and it is one of my FAVORITE halibut recipes.  The fish turns out amazing, and the sauce is great on pasta or rice.  Other than substituting the protein, I follow the recipe as written.  Love it!

I loved this recipe but with a few MAJOR changes. First you have GOT to try it with jalapeno cream cheese for just a bit of spice. I agree with one suggestion to remember to soften the cheese so I just sat it near the skillet while I browned the following vegetables. I also sauteed a small onion, a diced red, green, orange pepper and some mushrooms. ALSO don't forget to dice some garlic and brown that as well. While that was browning I cooked some broccoli in the microwave and added it with the (double) the dressing mix and double the soup. I cubed my chicken and it was ready in 20 minutes. SO GOOD! I had invented a dish with everything you needed including a many good vegetables and a bit of spice. You should definitely try this one and put your own spin on it!

My family loves this! I made the sauce on the stovetop and added in shredded chicken and mushrooms. I serve it over orzo pasta and my daughter and husband mix it all together and add fresh cracked pepper. Tasty and so easy!

I made this without the cream cheese and a can of cream of mushroom soup as that is all I had. I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and sauteed it in a skillet with some onion and the butter. I made the sauce and just poured it over the chicken and pasta. It was a quick, tasty and easy meal. Next time, I'll add chopped broccoli or peas and mushrooms. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent pasta sauce. I used chicken broth (no wine), plain whipped cream cheese (all I had), regular cream of mushroom, butter and italian packet. I also added sauteed fresh mushrooms. I followed the directions and baked in the oven. I'm actually not a big chicken fan, and I just poured the sauce & mushrooms over angel hair, leaving the chicken breasts for hubby. It was delicious!! This is a great go-to pasta sauce. Next time I'll just combine the sauce ingredients on the stove, simmer till smooth, and pour over pasta. No chicken or long baking needed for me!

Delicious!  Very rich and creamy sauce.  Not exactly health food but if you want a slightly more sophisticated chicken breast dish this is a great choice.  The family loved it.

Serve it with sauteed asparagus - everyone loves it.  I added the cooked pasta to the slow cooker before serving - this way the pasta is all coated in the sauce.  Yum!

This is delicious, I followed the recipe only extra thing i did was season my chicken with a little salt and poultry herb mix before covering it in the sauce. I would have given 5 stars but i think double the sauce is necessary for the amount of pasta. My kids (5yr twins and 1yr) loved it my husband went back for more, and asked if he could take the rest for lunch. We are a family of 5 and this was a perfect amount, if the baby was older my husband wouldn't have anything to take for lunch.

i liked it. Hubby was not thrilled. He said he thought the rigatoni and the sauce together were too heavy. He only likes thin spaghetti.  Followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh Italian herb mix vs dried. Cut three chicken breasts in slices (instead of six) but kept the sauce ingredients the same. Cooked on the stove rather than in the oven. Added in broccoli florets. The sauce was very thick. I probably should have thinned it out with pasta water or chicken broth. Maybe I'll give it one more try with chicken thighs in the slow cooker.

The sauce was delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  I used a moscato because that's all I had on hand, and it was really good.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken baked in the sauce ... I think next time I will grill the chicken, slice or dice it, and serve it with the sauce over the noodles.

My family got so excited over this recipe!  They thought they was eating Olive Garden or some 5 star restaurant.  I used regular Cream of Mushroom soup.  I used two cans.  I used about 3/4 Cup of the white wine and I must have used about 6 oz of cream cheese.  We skipped the chives.  I cut up the chicken into bite sizes/chunks.  I added some canned mushrooms.  They just thought it was the best thing ever.  I plan on serving it to my guest at the next party I have.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Loved this... Haven't cooked much with can soup but was surprised how good this was.  Tasted when done and though it was a little strong but when put on noodles it was great

Absolutely delicious. We double the sauce and use either chicken breast or thighs depending on what we have. Also, as other reviewers have suggested, if the breasts are too big slice/butterfly them before cooking.

I made this dish and maybe I added a little more wine but the result was amazing, the man raved and even went for seconds until he could not move, I was worried it would be too salty but once it baked it was perfect. We used whole wheat pasta also and there was no difference, the ONLY thing I might change next time is to double the sauce so when I have leftovers there is enough to cover the pasta ratio.. Thank you this one is a keeper.

We really liked it. The only problem for me was that the sauce was way too heavy despite I doubled the wine. It was too thick for the pasta. Should I add more wine?

I love this recipe so much.  It was actually one of the first recipes I ever made and it's a go-to for an easy dinner.  I usually double the recipe for leftovers.  However, my mom recently started Weight Watchers and obviously a recipe with a stick of butter and a package of cream cheese is not diet-friendly.  So I tried making it differently - replaced the butter with chicken broth and use 1/2 neufchatel cheese 1/2 plain nonfat greek yogurt.  It tasted very similar.  I think the chicken was maybe a touch drier without the addition of the butter, but it was still moist.  I'm going to try again using a little more chicken broth next time, as I feel like I usually get more sauce out of it, but otherwise I was happy with the changes.  I make two 8x13 pans and we (family of 4) can polish off one pan for dinner, so I calculated the WW points doubling the recipe with my changes and using 8 servings.  4 points per serving (not including a side, usually use rice).  The recipe as written, doubled and 8 servings, would normally be 8 points per serving, not including sides.

Have made this twice now and we love it!  I try to always make as written but in this case I left out the butter only because we never have it in the house.  Everything else I left the same but after reading reviews, did double the sauce recipe and added fresh mushrooms when I went to bake it.  My husband said it was like going to Olive Garden!  The sauce is kind of rich so you may not need as much as you think but then again he wanted extra so guess it just depends upon your taste.  I am trying to cook more and keep trying new things and this was just excellent and EASY!!!!!  This recipe would be a great "company for dinner" recipe but also just a quick weeknight dinner as well.  I used just the store brand of the Italian seasoning, a less expensive cooking white wine and then Philly brand of the chive/onion cream cheese and it turned out incredible!  Thanks for the recipe!

I like how easy this is to put together. I followed the sauce exactly but only had 3 chicken breasts. There was lots of sauce. In Canada our Italian dressing mix comes in 42 gram packages. For this recipe you need 1/2 of a package. Make sure to have the sauce quite hot before you add the cream cheese which you may want to cut into small pieces if you are using a brick. My cream cheese didn't quite get dissolved so there were chunks but it was still delicious. I think I'll try this in the slow cooker as others have suggested. Thanks for a yummy easy recipe. UPDATE. I didn’t have any golden mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom and added 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce and 2 tbsp ketchup to it. This was an acceptable alternative in a pinch.

UNBELIEVABLE! 4 star because did not stick to exact recipe. But only changed amount not ingredients. Did as others suggested - used 2 lbs tenders, cubed, and doubled sauce. Cooked 4 hours on low in crock pot. By far one of the best recipes on here!!!! Husband said it tasted like a true French sauce. 14 year old son just kept saying "this is A-mazing!". Don't replace chx broth for wine!! Use the wine!! It makes it astounding! I think this would make a great sauce for shell fish. Very decadent, but not too thick. Will make again. Tomorrow probably. Hehe.

My husband and I decided to make this on a whim one night and we thought it was delicious! We didn't add or change much of anything, I added slightly more white wine; who doesn't like more wine? We did use only 3 chicken breasts, since it's just us, and and kept the same measurements for the sauce as if there were 6 chicken breasts - we're saucy people. We also used Good Seasons Zesty Italian dry salad dressing mix - it was perfect. I plan to actually make this again tonight and bought some chives to chop and have on top.

When I removed it from the oven there was grease standing on top. As far as the taste I thought it was ok, my husband however gave it the kiss of death when he said " It was edible " so I will not be makeing it again.

I love this recipe!  I am a vegetarian, so it is very easy for me to make this for myself and other people.  I make an extra batch of the sauce and put it over my pasta, then serve the meat eaters :) the chicken over their pasta.  It is my go-to when I'm having friends over for dinner!

This was FANTASTIC! I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic into the butter and I also added a little extra white wine. I also added 1/4 C heavy cream. My husband loved this. I asked him to rate it and he said definitely a 5 star! Thank you Marian for such a great recipe!

Loved this, but I have made a minor change. I use 1 cup of wine and almost a full 8 oz of the cream cheese. This has been a huge hit for my family and friends.

I loved this recipe,but I did make a few changes. First I doubled the ingredients as followed: 1/2 cup butter, 2 cans of condensed golden mushroom soup, 8oz of cream cheese with green onions, 2 packets of dry Italian dressing mix, and 1 cup of white wine. Second, I cut the chicken into strips, poured the sauce over it, and baked it for 40 minutes at 350°F. Other than that I just stuck to the recipe.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  Oven wasn't working...so... I sauteed chicken (bite-sized pieces), sliced mushrooms, and Italian seasoning in skillet. Then combined other ingredients in a separate pot. I had planned on dumping chicken into sauce ... but the chicken tasted so good with the Italian seasoning, I was afraid to put it in the sauce.  As a result, we ended up with the sauteed chicken and had the sauce on top of Angel hair spaghetti...sauce was delicious!    Next time I'll try the regular recipe .. or do it in a crock pot .. like chicken stroganoff recipe.

This did not go over well with my family at all.   Bland - no zip in the flavor of chicken - actually just seemed to "bog" down the whole pasta thing anyway.  Won't be making this again.

I had never used Golden Mushroom soup until I came upon this recipe, and now I keep a can of it on hand at all times.  The flavours in this soup are sinful.  I would recommend adding 1/2 cup of chicken broth as suggested by other members.  Also, to soften the cream cheese before adding it to the sauce as it does take forever to blend otherwise.  I didn't have the cream cheese with chives so I added some fresh chopped chives and it was delicious.  This is such an easy dish to make and is always well received.  It is excellent for leftovers too.  I am so glad I found this recipe because it is SO good!!

I tried this last night for dinner, I did cut up the chicken after it baked and added steamed Asparagus cut in to bite size pieces and My family devoured this dish and also asked " Can you please make this again sometime?"  That there is the best review ever. Thinking of trying with a Fish like Cod, or Shrimp or Scallops. Wonderful, Glad I seen this video for that Awesome Idea! Highly recommend and SO EASY!

Very good flavors.  Not enough sauce, though.  If you're just serving chicken it's fine, but if you're serving over pasta, double the sauce.  You'll be glad you did.

This was a good recipe. I used the full 8 oz cream cheese, and one can of golden mushroom, one can of cream of mush.  I regretted dicing up the chicken, as I think it would have been a nicer presentation left whole or in strips.  It was very easy and good.  I would make this again.  Thanks!

I had to adapt this to fit what ingredients I did have in my kitchen.  I used regular cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of fat free italian dressing, plain (1/3 less fat) cream cheese - but I had chives so I chopped some up and added them.  I went with only 2 tablespoons of butter to reduce fat more and stuck with the wine.  I loved it, Grumpy thought it needed stronger flavor (so  next time I will make sure to have the seasoning packet mix.)  I also used chicken tenders and sauteed fresh mushrooms to add more mushroom to the mix.

This was incredible! Such a good flavor. I did have to substitute the wine with apple juice because I didn't have any on hand. I also had cream cheese in hand so I just added regular cream cheese, added chives and a bit of onion and garlic powder. I will make again and see how much greater it can get with the wine. My favorite new recipe for sure!

I felt like this recipe was sort of bland.  I followed the recipe exactly as directed.  If made again I think I would have to increase the dry Italian style salad dressing mix and possibly the wine.  It was easy to make however.

This is one of the worst dishes I have ever made.  The Italian dressing flavors were just strange alongside the mushrooms.  It was EXTREMELY salty.  I have no idea why a soup with a base of beef stock was used in a chicken dish.  The sauce was also way too thick to pair with angel hair pasta.  In more than a year of regular cooking, this is the first time my boyfriend has given me negative feedback on a dish.

We all loved this! Next time I think I'll add the the whole container of cream cheese with chives.
Add the whole pound of lightly drained angel hair, the extra water helps loosen the crock pot cooked sauce.

I stayed as close to the original as I could, given my ingredients. Have made this twice now, once with regular cream of mushroom, and once with golden mushroom, and a splash of Italian salad dressing instead of the dry mix. BUT, it was delicious and my family loved it. Added some sliced onions and mushrooms, and served with linguine. I will cut the wine next time, a bit too strong. However, we all loved it.

I was surprised at how easy and delicious this meal was. My changes were that I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms. The next time I will halve an onion pole to pole and slice and add to the mixture for an added layer of flavor and chop some fresh parsley to sprinkle on top when serving for some added freshness. Great starter recipe.

this was actually a great recipe - made as written.  what I learned I'll do next time is just bake the chicken on its own and top it with the sauce over the chicken and pasta.  I wouldn't cook the sauce with the chicken as mine came out very thin - with that said - the left overs were amazing and the sauce thickened up (I did add another can of cream of celery soup the night I baked it after it came out of the oven)

This was good, but not great.  I'm so sorry.  It wasn't worth the hour plus to get it on the table.  I followed instructions to a T so it's not as if I made changes or anything.  I can't say I'll make this one again.  I hate writing less than 5 star reviews because I know each of these recipes has a great story behind it.  I do appreciate the post, though, as we are big chicken eaters and it was nice to do something a little different.

I absolutely love this recipe and have been making it for years!  I make it at least once per month.  I use 2 cans of the golden mushroom soup, one 8 oz. container of the cream cheese, and one stick of butter, just for extra sauce.  Instead of the white wine I use chicken broth, only because I always have it on hand. So delicious!!

Great taste, very easy.  I did not think it was too salty.  Adding it to my bag of fast weeknight meals.  The kids ate it up.

I just got done making this recipe and I absolutely loved it. My whole family enjoyed it as much as I did. I followed the recipe completely except for when she said to put salt in with the pasta, because of the reviews saying it was too salty. One word to describe this recipe would simply be fantastic.

The sauce that this recipe makes is excellent! It is a bit rich, but it's still really good. My only complaint is that it's a little tough to eat when you cook the chicken breast halves in their whole form. I think the next time I make this I will cut the raw chicken into pieces and cook it in the sauce to make it easier to eat. Overall, this is a great recipe though. My family (there are only 3 of us) ate the entire batch in one sitting. Definitely adding this to my list of "keeper" recipes :)

This is GREAT!! I actually used an 8-oz package of cream cheese (one of those little tubs), not realizing I was using way too much.  I also added sliced portobello mushrooms that I sauteed in a little butter & olive oil before starting the rest of the sauce, left sit in a bowl, and sprinkled on top of the chicken breasts before pouring the sauce over.  I also added some minced garlic.  I baked it the full hour, but after about a half hour the smell was driving my husband and I crazy.  Definitely will be making again!

I've been eyeing this recipe for months now and finally made it tonight and I'm dumbfounded. Hasn't anybody tried any of the other amazing recipes on this site? I generally agree with other reviewers when a recipe has such high marks, but I found this to be very bland. For the amount of fat and starch, this heavy dish was not worth the calories. Even my easy-to-please fiance said it wasn't the best and was only "okay." Deleting this one from my recipe box! :(

Amazing!  My family loved this and asks for it quite often.  I do use the chicken stock/broth in place of the white wine, but other than that the recipe is unchanged.  I will continue to make this, and thanks to the recipe I have impressed my friends.  Thank you.

I made some tweaks to the recipe according to the previous reviews and my own personal tastes. First of all, I tried to use lower fat ingredients when I could (Fat-free cream of mushroom, reduced fat cream cheese) 

I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and heated a bit of oil and sautéed them for about 3-5 minute on each side, just to get a golden color and a little crispiness. Then I removed the chicken and prepared the sauce in the pan after de-glazing with chicken broth. I added just chicken broth instead of wine and increased it to about 2 1/2 cups because the sauce seemed really thick. (We personally don't like thick sauces and the "stick to your ribs" feeling). I added the chicken back and simmered for twenty minutes. It tasted great! 

Side note, the italian dressing mix smells and tastes a bit like the mix to make those pasta side salads so if you are a fan of those, you will love this meal.

I fix this in the slow cooker and it's AWESOME!! I put all the ingredients in except the noodles and let it cook all day. A few minutes before eating I cook angel hair pasta on the stove and dinner's ready. It's a hit!

I halved this recipe for my fiance and I, and we loved it. I used more wine than it called for (3/4 c. in total) because I found the sauce to be overly thick. It was very tasty and as others have said, could easily translate to a slow-cooker recipe. I'll definitely make this again because it was quick and easy and had a lovely flavor without being too heavy like some cream sauces.

I am very leary of trying new recipes when having guests, but this dish received such rave reviews that I prepared it for a small luncheon. It received rave reviews from every guest.  This is an easy and exceptionally good dish. As suggested by many others, I did make a few changes to the original recipe.

I used 4 boneless chicken breast cut into pieces, 1 plus 1/2 packets of Good Season Italian dressing mix, 1 cup plus a bit more  low salt chicken broth, 2 cans mushroom soup, 2 tubs cream cheese with chives, and  sliced fresh mushroooms.

 Soften the cream cheese, mix all ingredients, and cook on low in the crock pot for 5 hours. Serve over pasta.

This recipe lacks color. I added  chopped steamed brocolli just before serving and next time will consider adding thinly sliced red pepper to the crock.

I highly recommend this recipe!

Several cooks complained about the salty taste of the original recipe.  I am happy to have only used 1 1/2 packets of dressing as I think that the recipe would be too salty. I also used low salt chicken broth.

YUM!!! It is too thick. I used the chicken broth method (10 oz of chicken broth instead of wine) and it was still a bit thick (I like mine a little thin, so as it cools while we eat it doesn't get "sticky"). Even with the chicken broth, had to thin with milk even a little more. Still delicious... would work well in a crockpot, or with breaded or grilled chicken.  Maybe even add, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms!  YUM!

I made this recipe as directed. Flavor wise- the sauce was a 5 star keeper. But.... I did have a few complaints from family and I both- 1- it looks bland- no color;2- not enough sauce;3- needs some veggies; 4- either chicken was behind done and tough or other pieces were not done at all (actually I can't really blame the recipe on this- this was probably user error) 
Anyway, I made it a second time, doubled the sauce and Placed everything in the crockpot. I added a package of sliced mushrooms. Cooked on low for 5 hours. I steamed broccoli (awesome with the cheese sauce)and added that and after serving it on plates, I cooked up some red pepper slices to through on top. Looked much better. :-)

Loved this recipe. iIused only 4 boneless chicken cutlets for my husband and I.  I sliced one large baking potato (with skin on) and layered it in the same dish with the chicken. I interspersed about a half of a sliced onion with the potato. Poured the sauce over everything. Absolutely delicious! It's a keeper!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but my sauce was literally like water! I followed the recipe to a "t" except substituting the wine for chicken broth. It smelled delicious and the chicken was good but the sauce.. Not so much.

Amazing! I followed other reviews and doubled everything but the cream cheese and dressing packet. I added 12 oz sliced mushrooms and used fettuccine in place of angel hair. Comes out wonderfully! Also good in the crock pot but the sauce gets a bit thin.

This was really tasty.  I was a little skeptical from the smell, but it was a great combination of flavors.  The chicken was also very tender from cooking in the sauce for an hour.  Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this meal.  My family said it was good and something different.  I always, always make the recipes as written with no changes the first time I try one and this was really good as is.  This will definately be on my menu again in the future with a few personal preferrences and when time is short I will do it again just the way the recipe has it because I found this very easy to make.  Thank you Marian.

OMG, this was DELICIOUS.  I cut the chicken into strips and whenever I make a pasta and chicken dish, the chicken is finished and not the pasta but this was the opposite even for my son who is not "thrilled" about pasta.  The sauce is so good, you don't need the chiken.

Next time, I may just try sauteeing the chicken in some seasoning, making the sauce and cooking the pasta and then putting all the "parts" together and serve.  Will make extra sauce next time.

My family really enjoyed this meal....very easy to prepare.  I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers (i.e. cut chicken into strips, broccoli, bow tie pasta, mushrooms, garlic, extra wine, Adobo seasoning on the chicken).  It was ALL good... we'll definitely add this to our list of "do agains!"

LOVED it!  Followed the directions exactly, as I think anyone should do, and was not disappointed.  I would probably double the amount of sauce, since it's soooo good.  Will definitely make this again and wouldn't change a thing.

Wow! This was a huge hit! I thought I made more than enough for leftovers for lunch the next day, but there are barely two servings left! We are not huge fans of mushrooms, so we used cream of chicken soup, and I didn't have any white wine, so I used 1/4 cup of red wine and 1/4 cup of water. I tasted it before and after I added the wine/water mix, and it did make a difference. I used regular cream cheese and added my own dehydrated chives. I used gigantic frozen chicken breasts, and threw it all in a 9x13 baking dish and it still only took 1 hour to cook!
Thanks for the great recipe! My family has asked that this become a staple dish for dinner! I would love to try the crock pot version that another reviewer suggested, what an easy way to cook it!

I thought this was great. I enjoyed the hint of wine taste in the background. My two young kids ate it up. I also saw the same recipe for the slow cooker on this site. I really don't think that would make a difference. Preparing it on the stove top and in the oven works just fine.

FABULOUS!!! I only used 3 chicken breasts but kept quantity of sauce the same. Also only made 1/2 lb of pasta. I did 1/4 cup wine + 1/4 cup broth...I think you can mis-match this in any way. Very very good. Highly recommended and easy to make

I have been making this for years and everyone requests it and loves it. I have used cream of mushroom instead of golden mushroom and that gives it a creamier flavor. The golden mushroom is a richer flavor. The kids seem to like the creamy version better and adults the golden.

Overall we were disappointed.  Followed the recipe to a T - made it in the crock pot, doubled the sauce to make sure there was enough.  I wonder how many people actually use Golden mushroom soup vs cream of mushroom?  Golden has a very distinct flavor, and I think lends itself more to beef dishes.  The sauce was very salty, and I love salt, I salt everything more than I should.  It's very rare that anything is too salty for me.  I had to add some half n half to temper the salt.  I used Good Seasons brand Italian dressing, so if you use that, either don't use it all or be sure to get low sodium soup!  The flavor of the sauce was very strong.  It did not need to be doubled.  When I saved the leftovers, I only added enough sauce to slightly color the pasta and it was better, although I still didn't care for the golden soup in this recipe.  If I were to make it again, I would use cream of mushroom soup and half of the dressing packet.

Great easy recipe! I threw everything in my slow cooker for a little over 4 hours on low and it was awesome. I used chicken stock instead of white wine and also added some pepper flakes for a little kick. Toward the end, I added some fresh mushrooms. In the future I would add more fresh veggies, then double the sause. I just squicked by this time with the sauce...

Very good and couldn't be any easier to do!  I baked the chicken at 350 for 40 minutes and the chicken was very tender.  My four and eight year old daughters loved the sauce.  I used chicken broth instead of wine and 8 oz cream cheese with onion and chives.  We had a side of peas and garlic bread to complete the meal.

VERY YUMMY and SUPER EASY TO MAKE!!!! I threw everything in the crock pot and it came out great! I followed the recipe as is. I did add fresh grilled veggies such as red bell peppers and zucchini. The red bell peppers gave it a nice taste when all mixed together on plate! Will definitely make again!

A little too heavy and salty for my liking. I think I will try sodium free mushroom soup and add milk next time. Good flavor but just a little too rich.

Well, this receipe was just ok.  It came out too salty for my taste, and I followed the receipe exactly.  I mean, I can see why people love it, but it was just ok for me. I tasted the sauce while cooking in the oven, and I decided to add about 1/2 cup of milk to alleviate the saltiness.

Great recipe!
I used a 1/2c of lemon juice instead of the wine, because I didn't have any. I added a small can of mushrooms. I also used cream cheese with chives & onions. Turned out delicious!
Next time I'm going to season & cut up the chicken prior to cooking and also try the crock pot method.
I only cooked 1/2lb of the spaghetti & it was plenty for my family of 4 and there was plenty of sauce for it.

Outstanding recipe!!! I made this for myself last night.  Instead of using wine like other reviews I used chicken broth.  Overall excellent. The only thing I would recommend doubling up on thre recipe for extra sauce, as I didn't have a lot of extra sauce to use.

I was so excited to try this and it just didn't work for us.  The sauce turned out really runny and not much flavor.   My son wouldn't eat it and he eats anything.  Had to make something else.

This wasn't my favorite dish that I've ever made from AllRecipes ... but in all honesty I'm not a huge fan of chicken and pasta dishes, I tried it because I was looking for something different to do with chicken. But I did not stick to the OPs directions, I veered off into my own little cooking world, so I won't downgrade the recipe for mistakes I may have made. And also, I see this sauce as an excellent base for other dishes to try: ham and peas with penne using cream of chicken soup...shrimp and scallops with asparagus using cream of celery soup...it's all good!

I couldn't find Golden mushroom so I used cream of mushroom (2 cans) and 2 T tomato paste. Combined that with 8 oz cream cheese, 1 T chives, 1 packet Italian dressing mix, 14 oz chicken broth. Heated through till smooth. In a large electric skillet I sauteed the cubed chicken with a little olive oil for about 5 minutes, then added onions and garlic, cook for another 5 minutes. Added a little white wine and cooked a little longer before adding the sauce, then cooked a bit longer while the pasta cooked. Thought the chicken would break down and become tender but it was rubbery. The flavor of the sauce was very good.

This is a GREAT dish!  The only changes I made were:  Doubled the sauce (all except the salad dressing mix) and used fettuccine noodles.  I baked the chicken in the sauce, took the chicken out of the sauce after baking and sliced it into nice thin pieces.  I mixed the noodles & sauce together & put the sliced chicken on top to serve it.  It stayed in the oven on warm a few minutes while I got the rest of the meal together.  Looked awesome and tasted even better.  Planning to make it for an entire varsity boys swim team & they are gonna love it!  (Will be multiplying the sauce by 6 and noodles by 4!) Great company dish!

Just finished dinner and have to say this was extremely flavorful. Sauce was similiar to what you would find at a nice restaurant. My son and I loved it. My 11 year old daughter didn't care too much for it. (she's too picky anyway)

Easy and very flavorful. I used shredded, cooked chicken that I had cooked earlier and froze instead of the breasts. Mixed the chicken into the saucepan & let simmer for about 15 minutes - skipped the oven altogether. Just cooked the noodles & poured the chicken sauce over top. Oh & I didn't have any wine on hand, chicken stock worked fine. I will definately make this again.

This was soooo good the sauce was great but the chicken was even better. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the amount of sauce is not enough for the amount of pasta and chicken and because the butter floated up to the top while baking. Maybe thats because I didn't use "real" butter. Next time I will try it without any butter and I will double the sauce recipe. I also used chicken broth instead of wine.

All I have to say is yuuuuuummm!!  This was so delicious my husband finished his bowl in about 3 minutes flat.  However, mine was a little dry, there wasnt enough sauce.  It may be because of bigger chicken breasts, Im not sure so tomorrow I will make some more sauce for it but this was amazing!!  I made it with a double tomato bruschetta recipe i found on here and it was all delicious!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the sauce (but not Italian seasoning) since I like a lot of sauce on my pasta.  I cut the butter, and did this in the crock pot.  It was super easy, but a bit bland at first (which made me wish I had doubled all ingredients, including the Italian dressing packet - the salt content may just depend what brand you get!).  I did have to doctor it up quite a bit with some Italian seasoning, a bunch of garlic powder, pepper, etc. before serving.  Sprinkled fresh grated parmesan, parsley, and smoked paprika on top.  It ended up quite creamy and good!  In the end I had to alter the original recipe quite a bit (hence 4 and not 5 stars) until it was ready to serve, but knew I would need more sauce...

I made this tonight for a guest and it was out of this world!  I nearly doubled the sauce recipe for 6 breasts and served it with bow tie pasta.  Yummy yummy!  It's perfect when you're expecting guests because while it's baking you can clean up.

this is a great recipe and it can be modified as to what you have on hand. I cut up 2 large boneless chichen breasts in large chunks.Used plain mushroom soup,fresh chives with the cream cheese that I had to finish up,dried italian spice mix from this site(no need to buy packaged).Added couple sprigs of fresh oregano as I still had some.Put in crock pot and cooked on low for 4 hours or so.I did follow the rest of recipe. When done added some sliced GREEN olives and fresh parsley cut up.Mixed with penne pasta(about 3 cups UNCOOKED) and we loved it.Husband said this is a keeper .THANKS!!!

This sauce is really tasty, but I did add about a 1/2 C. of milk to thin it down a little bit.  My problem is, I actually think the sauce is TOO GOOD FOR CHICKEN!  Next time, I will try sauteed shrimp or scallops.  I did add broccoli, and will probably add mushrooms for my husband.  It is another great sauce to play with.

I must say, this was very good. Although, there was just something about the sauce. It was super thick and I doubled it (which I am glad I took the advice of other reviewers). There wouldn't have been enough sauce if I didn't double it. That's just my opinion. I liked it though, don't get me wrong, I just wouldn't quite give it 5 stars. My husband loved it too. I will make again but maybe with some adjustments to thin it just a bit.

This was very very tasty!  I melted the butter in the microwave, them mixed in the soup, wine and dressing packet, and heated that up, then added the cream cheese in chunks and heated again until melted, and whisked smooth.  Poured over three chicken breasts, and baked for an hour as directed.  I would have given it five starts, but even with half the chicken, there was still not enough sauce to adequately coat the pasta.  Next time, I'll double the sauce and add freshly minced garlic too.  Also, I think it would be just fine with half the butter.  But overall, this was yummy yummy yummy.

This was sooo good, my husband thought so too. Definitely not for the weak of heart, as it's full of fat....but good as a treat. I agree that doubling the sauce is a must, and the chicken turned out so moist and flavorful, is also great for leftovers....definitely will make this again

My family loved this!  UPDATE: I made this is the crock pot using 1 stick of butter, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 cup white wine, 2 packets of dry Italian dressing mix, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup and one bag of frozen, skinless, boneless chicken breast. I cooked on high for about 4 hours, then removed the chicken and diced it. Whisked the sauce and returned the chicken and a box of cooked bow tie pasta. Delicious!

This was well received by my family.  I did however cook it in the slow cooker on high for 4.5 hours and it was perfect. I will be making this often.

I didn't think it was the best pasta dish ever, but it was pretty good. The chicken was good and it went well with the angel hair.

This is such a great tasting dish!  When I made it for the first time I was surprised at how authenticly italian it tasted; it reminded me of my favorite dishes at Macaroni Grill restaurant.  I made it for my husband and he LOVES it; he recently requested it again.  Shared it with a friend and she makes it all the time when entertaining.  A great dish to impress friends.  A+!

Can be a bit salty but otherwise good.  I ended up using the entire 8oz of cream cheese (not just half of it) to cut the salt and that seemed to do the trick.

Great recipe!  I thought the sauce was a tad salty so I added 1/2 extra can of soup and that seemed to do the trick.  I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and garlic pepper and then seared before putting it in the baking dish.  Served with linquine and mushrooms sauted in canola oil and sprinkled with parmesan just before serving.  Will definitely be making this again soon and will likely try the crock pot method.  Thanks!

This is delicious! I did saute my chicken tenders in olive oil and used salt and pepper and lightly browned both sides and then put it in my pan and poured the sauce on top and covered my pan with foil. So yummy! I served mine over penne pasta! So perfect with a salad and garlic bread!

This was awesome!!! My husband and kids were very impressed! I used cream of chicken with herb instead of cream of mushroom. The sauce was absolutely mouth watering! I could have just put the sauce by itself in a bowl and licked it out like a cat! One tip though. You will not need a whole box of pasta only half.

Really delicious!!  so easy to make, it's a fast weeknight meal, but taste so darn good.  again, probably not super figure friendly but once in awhile it's fine.  i'm sure you could sub lo fat or fat free cream cheese but i never do cause i'm a nut for the full flavor of dishes!!  that's simply my take though!  will make this again..oh and i used some left over rotisserie chicken i had from costco which helped with time on this as well.

My family loves this recipe.  We've made it even easier by turning it into a crockpot recipe.  I omit 2 T of butter, add baby bella mushrooms, and use cream of chicken/mushroom soup.  I cut chicken into strips, place in crockpot with mushrooms.  Cook sauce as directed and pour over chicken mushroom mixture.  Cook on low for 5-6 hours.  i've even used frozen breasts and they cook just fine.

Yum!  I had guests and wanted to try something new.  I took others suggestions and only used one package of italian seasoning, doubled the golden mushroom soup, cream cheese, wine and butter to make more sauce.  Also added a can of drained mushrooms and cooked in the slow cooker for 5 hours. Served over angel hair pasta with side of sauteed veggies. I received rave reviews!  Will absolutely make many more times!

WOW!!!  The family was a little skeptical when they saw the ingredients on the counter but were blown over when they ate it!  The only thing I did different was to cook my chicken in the skillet seasoned with some roasted garlic/herb seasoning and set it aside.  I mixed the sauce as directed and poured it over the precooked chicken breasts and then baked it for about 20 minutes.  Served it with steamed asparagas and Barefoot Chardonay. I took a plate of the leftovers to my neighbor and he devoured it asking for the recipe!  Will definately make this again!

The texture of this recipe turned out well for me but I was not a big fan of the flavor and it was a little too rich. This recipe has gotten so many good reviews so I'm sure that this is a tasty dish; it just wasn't for me.

Fabulous. I made this recipe in the crock pot and everyone loved it. It took me 3 minutes to throw the ingredients in the crock pot and I left it on low for 8 hours while at work.  No preparation required. Thanks.

Really good!!  Really easy and quick so great for a weeknight meal.  I skipped the chicken and just went with veggies so no need to bake in the oven.  I used a frozen package of broccoli/mushroom mix.  I felt like it wasn't enough sauce so I ended up doubling the recipe, but since I didn't have a 2nd can of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of chicken and it still tasted great!  I just mixed ingredients as instructed on stovetop and cooked until the frozen veggies were done.  Towards the end, I added grated parm cheese until mixed and then topped over rotini.  Awesome!

This recipe was amazing and so easy to make.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly but I wanted to double the sauce and only had one can of mushroom soup, so I used 1 mushroom and the other was cream of chicken.  I also forgot the white wine.  The results were still absolutely delicious!!!  I made extra so we could have leftovers but didn't have any left.  I will definitely be making this again and again, only next time I will do a better job following the directions and also make more of it.   Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this was a very good dish, i did make double the sauce and it turned out perfect.  we like plenty of sauce. :)  we also did add a can of mushrooms also.  The man of the house raved and said might be best dish yet.  could not find cream cheese with chives at the store but did find cream cheese with ONION and chives.  again great recipe, did not give 5 stars for i cant say it is MY favorite dish :) but i will definitely make it again with no changes, i don't really see how it could get much better, and why change a good thing.  It is very much worth trying this recipe and it was SO EASY. i cooked in the crockpot, just mixed sauce ingredients and threw in the chicken! also used bowtie pasta for a little change.  enjoy.

This is a fantastic recipe! I would give it more stars if I could. Everyone always asks for the recipe, and I have to make it every two weeks for the hubby.  Use linguine instead of angel hair, it holds the sauce better.

I have made this recipe many times and it is delicious!  Very easy to make and it turns out rich and creamy.  I usually use about 3/4 pound of angel hair pasta, as there is not enough sauce for a whole pound.

I used the suggestion to add chicken broth instead of wine... not the greatest. It just seems very rich and buttery without having much taste.

this was a decent base for a sauce.  i did not serve with pasta (extra calories).  I give it kudos for how easy this dish is.  would i make again?? maybe maybe not.

I made this meal on the stove top, doubled the sauce - should have only used one packet of the seasoning - and used bow tied pasta. It was a little too salty but otherwise ok.

As much as I wanted to love this, I did not-- it was alright, but lacked something.  I did make it without the wine (DH does not like wine cooked in his food) and although I think it would have been better with wine instead of broth, I still don't think that would have been enough to make me love this.  If I were rating it based only on what I think of it, I would have given it 3 stars.  Hubby had a great time helping me make it, though, and he really, really likes it so I'm giving it one more star.

Very delicious! The creamy sauce that the chicken bakes in makes it very tender and moist! Good comfort food!  The ONLY thing I would alter, is to add maybe a small amount more of seasoning.  It had a very good flavor but could've used a teensy bit more.  Other than that, perfect! This one will definatley be added to our menu rotation :o)

Even though I changed this some, it still deserves 5 stars, for the idea atleast.  After I read alot of reviews, this is what I did and it was great.  The whole family said a definate keeper.  1/2 cup butter, 1 pkg dressing mix, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 can cr of mushroom, 1 can cr of chicken, 2 small cans mushrooms.  I warmed this up on the stove, then poured it over strips of chicken breasts in the crockpot.  Then stirred it together and cooked for about 5 hours. Then stirred in 1 8 oz pkg cr cheese and 1/4 c parsley while the bow-tie pasta was cooking.  It was kind of runny but made enough sauce for the pasta.  Very good and also the next day.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1 can of cream of chicken & 1 can of cream of celery soup & used chicken broth instead of the wine.  I also added 1/2 packet of dry ranch dressing mix.  One of my kids had a friend over & he had 3 helpings.  My oldest son who is extremely picky requested this for supper tonight.  Wonderful recipe.  It is nice to have something else to cook besides fried chicken & mashed potatoes & gravy.

My family really enjoyed this. None of us are a fan of mushrooms, yet the soup seemed to give it just the right flavor. I will make this one again and again.

My sister in law served this one evening (she substituted apple juice for the wine) when I was visiting and I asked her for the recipe.  I make it exactly according to the directions except that I double all of the sauce ingredients and put it in a slow cooker.  Fabulous to come home to an almost fully cooked meal after work.  I don't save it just for guests either.

So Delicious! I did use regular Cream of Mushroom Soup & I used regular Cream Cheese and added about 1/4 cup green onions. Also I sliced chicken into strips before placing into the baking dish! Overall a great dinner!

This so easy and turns out great..I used left over rotisserie chicken and just made the sauce on a pot.  I used chicken broth instead of wine and cream of chicken soup just for my personal taste.  This is really good and easy.  I added broccoli which was a nice addition as well!!  thanks for the recipe will definitely have this many times!!

This was good I made my own Italian Dressing mix and I think I may have added to much to the sauce but it still tasted good. I did everything on the stovetop since I had bread in the oven and it worked perfectly, Thanks!

Very good! I doubled the recipe, and it made plenty! A wonderful alternative to chicken carbonara. Only thing I may change in the future is to use a bulkier pasta. Angel hair overcooks too easily.

This delicious recipe is to die for! Made it last night with leftovers for tonight[just two of us]. I did up the oven temperature to 375;325 just seemed to take too long. Turned out perfectly. Too, we prefer fettuccine pasta. Shared with a co-worker and she wanted the delicious recipe.  Thanks, Marian for sharing.

Amazing. I was unable to use Golden Mushroom soup because our grocer only had one badly dented can. Used Cream of Mushroom instead and I loved it, my DH loved it (he normally dislikes my cooking). I did double the sauce, delish!

It's very tasty, but it tastes a little lowbrow.  Sort of salty and a little bit like buffet food or something.  I'd recommend cutting up the chicken a bit before baking to have more chicken surfaces covered with sauce.  I'd also recommend using the wine as suggested instead of replacing with broth.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I (like most others) have modified it a bit. I use 2 cans Golden COM soup, 1/2 c wine, 1/2 c chicken broth, almost the whole package(8oz) cream cheese, and a can (4oz) of mushrooms. This cuts way down on the saltiness and gives plenty of sauce for the noodles. I also grill the chicken and slice on top of the pasta...no oven required!

I only gave this 4 stars because I haven't tried making it as-is.  I substitute chicken broth for the wine and it's delicious!  I also cut the chicken into chunks instead of leaving it whole, but that doesn't really affect the flavor.  I always make a double batch of this, and we always finish the pan!

Great recipe. After reading some of the reviews I decided to season and saute my chicken breasts in olive oil and minced garlic and then cut into strips.  I also added fresh portabello mushrooms, 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chicken broth to the sauce. I used bow tie pasta, added olive oil and garlic to the pasta water, just before the paste was ala denta, I added broccoli.......delish.  GREAT RECIPE!  My daughter said this recipe was "ON POINT!"  Will make again.  DOUBLE THE SAUCE, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.

Wow, this meal was absolutely delicious.  I added a bit of salt to the recipe, but overall, there was nothing I could have done to make it taste any better.  The flavor of the white wine, cream cheese, & Italian dressing mix combined with the butter is the best part!

would rate a 3 1/2.  Easy enough to make, but was very rich and kind of bland-most likely would not make again

It turned out great with some changes. I was making it just for my 2 parents and here are the ingredients I used: 2 skinless, boneless chicken breast  1/4 cup butter 20 g package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix just under 1/2 cup ginger ale + a bit of water 1 can cream of mushroom soup 4 ounces fat free herb & garlic cream cheese 1/2 pound penne pasta  They loved it and it was easy. I cut the chicken in strips before putting it in a baking dish, added broccoli and chopped red peppers to the sauce while in the pot, then poured it all over, covered with tin foil and baked for 55 minutes. Oh and before putting the chicken in the baking dish, I sprinked down garlic & italian seasoning. Put some pepper on the breasts too. Thanks for a fab recipe!!

Mmmmmmmmmm... My boyfriend LOVED this recipe. I'm not a huge fan of the creamy dressing like this on pasta.  But he couldn't get enough of it.  Make it!!  :)

I have now made this recipe twice and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I make it in the crockpot, using all of the ingredients listed with these exceptions:  I only use 1/2 a pack of seasoning (to lessen the saltiness) and I also add 1/2 cup of water to thin the sauce slightly.  I also use bowtie pasta instead of angel hair but I have tried both.

This was pretty good.  My whole family loved it.  I actually just cut up the chicken and did everything on the stovetop.  The sauce is really excellent.  The only change I made was I added extra milk to make the wine flavor a little less, as our kids wouldn't have ate it if I didn't do that :).  Overall a great meal.

Very good. I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce, added fresh sliced mushrooms, and cooked in the slow cooker on low for 5 hours. I think the mushrooms are a must. I actually wish I had added more than I did, which was one bag.

Next time I will double the sauce and not add all the seaoning.  It was too salty.  My family of 5 all liked it so I gave it a 5 star.  Tried it again with shrimp like another poster mentioned it was the worst thing all 5 of us have ever tasted!!  DO NOT USE SHRIMP, USE CHICKEN!!!

Fabulous.  This was easy to make and no adjustments are necessary. I added mushrooms into the dish just because I had some on hand, but it tastes great either way.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was definitely too salty, and I really like salty food.  However, the flavor was great (why I gave it 4 stars).  When I make this again, I will definitely only use half of the dressing packet, or add some 1/2 and 1/2 to the sauce to tone it down- but that might take away from the creamy texture of the sauce.  Definitely DONT make this if you don't like salty food.  The chicken turned out really juicy.

We liked the taste of the sauce.  This recipe calls for no seasoning on the chicken and oddly enough I didn't miss it and it seemed fine without it.  The sauce definately carries this dish.  My only complaint is I think 1 lb. of angel hair pasta was way more than necessary and I think this would be more suited to going on top of some egg noodles. Nice dish and I will make again.

We really enjoyed this, but I think it's a little heavy on the wine. I wish I would have replaced some of it with chicken broth. I did add a splash of milk and sliced, fresh mushrooms to the sauce. I was in the mood for bite-sized food, so I cut my chicken up and spread the pieces on the bottom of the baking dish, then poured the sauce over as directed. It was really creamy and very rich, which I loved. My fiance really liked it, but he said it was just a little too rich for his tastes. Thanks :)

My Boyfriend absolutely LOVED this recipe. I thought it could use a little more flavor. I added some peas to it and I think it helped give it the flavor I was looking for. I've made it twice already and I'm sure I will make it again.

I followed the persons directions for the slow cooker version and I have made it several times. This pasta is delicious. I have had extended family over for dinner and this was a hit! Everyone loves it, even the kiddos! Its fairly easy to make and it tastes soooo good. I usually serve over penne pasta and garnish with parmesan and crushed red pepper. I serve it with breadsticks and salad. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Suuuuper easy, which makes it an immediate favorite.  I used grated cheddar coupled with sour cream, as I wanted some tang.  It turned out a little less creamy (I'm assuming) but really flavorful - rich, but not as heavy.  Sauteed asparagus on the side and this is a winner.

This was delicious!!!  I made this for the first time last night.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and added just a little bit of water to make it a little thinner.  My husband was back for more in minutes before he even finished what was on his first plate.  Very easy to make too!!!  Can't wait to make it again.

I doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the Italian Dressing, still only used one of those, and this made plenty of sauce.  I also used Penne instead of Angel Hair, but otherwise stuck with the recipe.  I found it a tad too salty, will probably make it with water instead of the wine next time to cut the sodium content.  It was still really good.

Great.  I made this low fat.  I did not use any butter, but instead used 1/2 c heated chicken broth and 1/2 packet of butter buds in place of it.  I used reduced fat (ww) cream cheese and only used 3 oz instead of 4.  I also cooked some onion & mushroom in the broth/butter buds before adding the rest.  Came out great.  Hubby and his friend both loved it.  Served w/steamed broccoli & slice of whole wheat bread.

My family loves this one.  I've made some changes to make it tastier.

I melt the butter with the Italian seasoning mixed in, and put in baby bella mushrooms right away to simmer and soak in the flavor.  The original recipe doesn't make nearly enough sauce, so I add two cans of the soup and 8 oz of whipped cream cheese.  This makes the sauce much creamier and it covers all the chicken well plus leaves plenty of sauce to drape over the angel hair pasta.  One of my husband's favorites!

This is a great recipe.  I made this as suggested by other viewers and did this in the crockpot.  I put all ingredients in the crockpot, cut up my chicken and cooked on low for 6 hours. TURNED OUT PERFECT.  I did use chicken broth instead of the white wine because that is what I had on hand.  Will make again for sure.

This is an easy recipe to make in the crock pot which is what I did.  I mixed all the ingredients except for the chicken in the crock pot and once everything was well mixed, I added the chicken which I diced up.  I added a little bit of onion.  I cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  I only used 2 chicken breasts but left the other ingredients at the original amounts to have more sauce which did work out well to put more sauce over the pasta or rice.  I would use the recipe "Italian dressing mix" from here instead of the packet from the store which is loaded with salt and fillers.  It will give it more punch and flavor.  I served it over rice to use up rice and chicken stock.  My husband said it had a lot of flavor and it was good.  We had broccoli along with it as well.  I think it'd be better over pasta as the recipe calls for.  Might add garlic next time.

The taste took some getting used to, but all in all it was a good dish.  I replaced the wine with white grape juice, cut the chicken breasts in cubes and cooked it in the crockpot.  Very easy and filling.

Love this recipe. Very good comfort food.  I use the variation listed in the reviews using the slow cooker, except I half it, and it's enough to feed my family with leftovers.

This came out pretty good. I basically used LynnG's review as my recipe because I wanted to make it in my slow cooker. I used 1/2 C butter, 2 pkgs dry italian dressing, 1 C cooking white wine, 2 Cans mushroom soup, and 8 oz tub of cream cheese.I mixed them all in the slow cooker, coated the chicken with the mixture and cooked on low for about 8 hours. I served over fettucine noodles.  Next time I will probably use less soup because the sauce tasted a little too mushroomy for my taste.

I was a bit disappointed in the recipe.  I made it for a small dinner party and it was edible but definitely tasted like it was made from processed foods.  I should have realized that when looking at the ingredients.  It was not bad, just not company/dinner party worthy.

After I made the sauce it just wasn't right, too tangy & harsh. I added 1/2 cup chicken stock & 1/2 cup heavy cream. I used fresh chives & 1/2 tsp. black pepper. These additions mellowed it out nicely.

This was a really good recipe. Followed ingredients exactly, but used chicken breast tenderloins cut into small strips. Also decided to cook it in the slow cooker after reading some of the other reviews! Tasted great!

This is incredible. I used a homemade dry italian dressing mix and fresh chives. Those were the only changes I made. There were no leftovers. I'd make this again and again.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  It is shocking how these ingredients make up such an incredible flavor.  Make sure to pound your chicken breasts before baking to ensure they turn out tender and yummy!

This is probably my husbands favorite dish ever. He even steals the pan ( I grill the chicken and slice it up and then throw it in the sauce for a few minutes before tossing with angel hair pasta) and tries to eat it straight out of it! So good. Its much quicker than baking, and you don't lose any of the sauce. So yummy!!!!!

This is great! I made mine on top of the stove, and served over cooked pasta. Per other reviews, I added (sauteed) mushrooms, and 3 or 4 chopped green onions. I had some grilled chicken tenders (boneless, skinless) that I need to use from my freezer, so I 
chopped the chicken into bite sizes first, then combined everything on top of the stove. By the time the pasta was done, so was the sauce. Can't wait to eat it again tomorrow (we made a double batch) Also will try in the crock pot soon. Also used chicken stock instead of wine, and reduced fat cream cheese.

I'm not sure about this recipe. I thought it had a good taste to it but I thought the sauce of kind of thick. I also didn't like it with the angel hair pasta...once the sauce got on the noodles they tasted kind of mushy.

My families all time favorite recipe. I make this for company and serve it with green beans, salad and rolls. It gets rave reviews every time. I double the sauce and cut up the chicken into bite size pieces. I add chopped red pepper and extra mushrooms to the sauce before I pour it over the chicken. Ummmmm!

Easy and yum! I used 1 lb. of chicken tenders that I cut into chunks and browned in a mix of butter and olive oil. Then I added the Italian dressing, plus a sprinkle of cayenne. Degalzed with the wine before adding 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup. I let this all simmer for awhile, adding more wine when the mixture got too thick. After about 20 minutes, I added the cream cheese, then a bit more wine, before mixing with the pasta. My boyfriend who prefers pasta with just butter and canned "parmesan" cheese loved this!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. I liked it but didn't love it. I doubled the recipe except for the italian dressing--only added one package of that. I left the butter out and I cut the chicken into pieces. I threw it all in the crockpot and added the cream cheese at the end of the cooking. I will definitely make it again because it is so easy and such a favorite with the husband.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the dish although I thought it was a tad salty. I substituted chicken broth for the wine(didn't have any on hand), and maybe that was the reason it was just a tad salty. Overall, an easy to prepare enjoyable dish that I would probably make again.

3 1/2 stars. I was hoping this would be as good as all the hype. It was pretty good, though The sauce was definately not enough; the noodles were dry. I had to make a second batch of sauce and pour it in afterwards. It seems it would be much cheaper and faster to pour in a jar of store-bought fettucine sauce, and it tastes just as good.

Great meal!  I'm not a mushroom fan either, but I figured if it's calling for a specific soup like Golden Mushroom, there must be a reason...I thought it added a distinct flavor as opposed to the cream soups suggested by others.  And, the mushrooms were TINY, you barely even knew they were there.

This has become my favorite recipe!! I absolutely love it. The only substitution I make is for the white wine. I use a can of Chicken Broth instead. This has been my go to meal when we have guests over dinner and everyone loves it and always asks me for the recipe.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe in my opinion!  Plus, my family loved it...my 2-year-old daughter ate an adult-sized portion of it and loved every bite.  I made the sauce on the stove and then put 2 large chicken breasts in the crock pot and poured the sauce over them and cooked on low for about 4 1/2 hours.  I made a few minor changes: I used chicken broth (an entire 14.5 oz. can) instead of white wine, and used the whole 8 oz. block of cream cheese.  For some reason the cream cheese never did completely melt--it kind of curdled a little bit.  So after the chicken was done cooking, I poured the sauce into the blender and pureed it for a few seconds.  I used almost a whole 16 oz. box of penne, and that was great with it.  It served 3 adults and 2 kids with one good-sized portion leftover.  This will definitely be one of my regular recipes from now on.  So good!

Wonderful Dish.  I used precooked chicken, cut up into bite sized pieces and broth instead of wine.  Made the sauce while pasta was boiling, then mixed together pasta, chicken and sauce and put into 9x13 pan and sprinkled grated italian blend cheese on top.  Put in oven long enough to melt cheese.......YUMMY

Followed several tips---used chicken broth instead of wine, cut chicken into chunks, I also added fresh spinach when baking, I only made 2 chicken breast, but the full amount of sauce, was delicious!!!

this is a great recipe. the sauce is wonderful, just make double of it to make your dish really delicious! i also added green and red pepper, onion, and baby bellas (just cook them beforehand in a skillet, then add to sauce before putting on chicken). also, cook a little broccoli with the pasta (maybe 4 minutes before pastas done) for an added crisp. so good!

I love this recipe and I put mine in the crock pot for about 4-5 hours on high! Adjust the wine because too much can make it taste just like wine. You must use golden mushroom soup, it makes the dish totally different then any other soup. Also double the sauce and pour over pasta!!!!

This recipe is wonderful!!  The flavors blend so well.  And the best thing is, I make this in the crock pot.  I throw all the ingredients in, put on low for 4-5 hours, and it is the easiest and most delicious dinner ever!  Just make some pasta, and dinner is ready.  I highly suggest it!

When I made this, I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce (except for the italian dressing). Also, I sauted mushrooms and garlic before making the sauce, then combined them. After baking I don't think it was too gravy-like, like some of the others did. Very good, will make again!

This dish was pretty good. Better than I thought it would be. I did as others recommended and added mushrooms and green onions. I only used four chicken breasts but made the same amount of sauce. It was just right.

Amazingly delicious! I doubled the sauce recipe and served this dish to my husband, three kids, and sister-in-law.  Everyone loved it. The kids raved about it. My 12-year-old daughter, who usually picks at her food, finished before everyone else and took seconds.  She never does that.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  It's a keeper.

This was just ok. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce which I'm glad I did for coverage, but the taste overall was nothing I was impressed with. I likely won't make this again. Sorry for the poor review, the taste just wasn't for me. Felt like it was missing something.

My family really liked this recipe.  It was tasty, and very easy to make.  I give it 4 stars for the fact that I had to do a lot of doctoring:the sauce was too thick, too salty, the angel hair wasn't sturdy enough for this thick sauce, the breasts were dry.  Dark chicken would have been better.

This recipe is divine and one I use as a company dish when I have guests.  I have a few modifications from the original.  I sauté the chicken in the butter until it’s golden on all sides; I use an entire eight ounce container of cream cheese with chives; and I use less pasta than the recipe calls for as I prefer more sauce.

I have a toddler, so we cut the chicken up into small cubes beforehand, and use penne pasta instead of angel hair.  (It's easier to make it "finger food" that way.)  Like a previous poster, we double the wine and golden mushroom soup so it's not as salty.  I also use one 8 oz container of the whipped chive cream cheese.  The whipped version seems to melt better. My husband, my son and I all love this recipe.  It's our favorite off this site so far.

I know this was highly rated, but wow! Better than expected! I added some mushrooms and doubled the sauce and pasta and tossed the two together. I also added fresh green onions and regular cream creese. A great and easy dish for impressing company. Even my son was asking for more!

Thought it was a GREAT dish! Only change was to add fresh sliced mushrooms and a 'dollop' of cream cheese. Very, very tasty.  Made dish again - followed recipe except for sauteeing fresh mushrooms, green onion, & brocoli (as suggested by another). When serving, angel hair pasta on plate followed by sauteed veggies, followed by chicken breast ending with incredible sauce - flavour, flavour, flavour!!! Nothing but compliments..

Family favorite! This is a regular at our house! I tried Pan searing the chicken breasts before baking, turned out nicely.  I use chicken tenderloins sometimes too! Very easy to prepare. My 2 year old will even eat it!

I am not sure what went wrong but I was very disappointed in this and don't plan to ever make it again. I am not sure if it is the wine I used- Pinot Grigio- but it had a very strong wine taste. I would suggest to use Chicken broth instead. I was glad I did add the broccoli and mushrooms and it would be bland with out it. Had much better meals then this.

This was my first time trying this recipe. I thought it was pretty good, but a little bland for my taste. My husband loved it though! He took it to work and gave some to a friend and they were so impressed on how good it was. Next time I think I'll add more flavor and cut the chicken up into smaller pieces so that they'll be softer. I also recommened to cover it in foil while baking it, it makes the chicken so much softer. :) Thanks for the recipe its a keeper :)

Oh I had high hopes for this one, but I just didn't love it. I could not get past the look of it, it just looks gross.... and doesn't smell that great. It tasted ok, but I would suggest 1/2 a packet of the dressing mix or double the recipe with 1 packet of dressing.... but it needed more sauce to cover the pasta, which by the way, was disgusting to eat with this sauce, it just wasn't right. I think another reviewer was right about saying rice would be better with this than the suggested pasta. I think I'm being very kind in giving it 4 stars. I will say, my husband ate the leftovers and he said it was pretty good. I was just waiting to be wowed I guess and wasn't.

Delicious! I made this recipe w/ 3 minor adjustments. I only used 3 skinless, boneless chicken breast cut into strips (with all other ingredient amounts the same), sprinkled them lightly w/ greek seasoning, and I served it over egg noodles. So much flavor! I'm sharing this recipe w/ my mother who's making it today for dinner.

Double the sauce, except for the dressing mix.  I substituted chicken broth for the white wine.  Everyone in my family LOVED this dish.  It will go into the rotation for sure.  A KEEPER!!

Great chicken recipe.  I often eat chicken therefore I am always looking for new ideas.  This recipe is great because you can adjust the ingredients to make it a little different.  I have changed the cream soup (cream of chicken, cream of vegetable, etc), the cream cheese (herb and garlic, onion and chive, etc), the dry dressing and the pasta.  I also always double the sauce … it’s sooooo good.   Definitely try this recipe.

This is such a wonderful recipe!  I tend to make the same things over and over, and almost always try recipes that have cream cheese in it (my weakness!)  It was so wonderful to taste flavors that I hadn't had tasted before.  This made such a delicious creamy sauce--which was even better the next day!  My husband's only complaint was the taste of the wine (he doesn't like "winey" flavors), but my three kids and I loved it, so he'll just have to deal with it because I'll be making this many times.  :)

Delicious --
Slight changes:
1) sauteed chicken in olive oil prior to putting in oven
2) used chicken broth instead of wine
3) used Rotini pasta

Cooked in oven for twenty minutes

I just made this dish for the second time tonight and it is definitely a keeper.  I do make it a little different to save some time.  Since it is just me and my husband, I butterfly 2 chicken breasts so they cook faster and season them with grill seasoning and saute them until they are done.  Then I remove them and let them cool a bit before I slice them up.  Then I make the sauce as directed in the pan the chicken was in and scrape up all the bits at the bottom with the grill seasonings.  I think the grill seasoning really gives it more depth in flavor.  I use chicken broth instead of wine, and I use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom (just personal preference) and I use dried chives because they are always on hand.  Then I stir the chicken back in a couple minutes before the pasta is done to heat them through.  I recommend using a more sturdy noodle than angel hair, thick spaghetti worked really well.  My husband had 3 bowls!!  And we have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was sooooooo good, tasted like something I would order at an Italian restaurant. With the cream of mushroom soup and cream cheese, the sauce was too thick for me...i added water 1/2c. at a time until it got to the consistency I wanted. Also, if you are going to double the sauce like I did, DO NOT double the Italian seasoning (IT IS VERRRRRY SALTY) in fact I would even cut down on the amount it calls for because before I started adding the water it was too salty and thick, then it got JUST RIGHT!! and oh soooooo yummy!! I added fresh mushrooms and red bell pepper. My husband thought it was delicious and he's not a pasta guy. Thanks!!

This recipe was VERY tasty! I do agree with others when they say to double the sauce. I felt there was too much chicken and noodles and not enough sauce. And dont judge the sauce before you bake it. It DOESNOT taste the same! But I will definately make this again with some adjustments.

Don't judge the sauce before you bake it. I tried it just after heating it up and was not pleased, but after baking it tasted great. And smelled heavenly while it was in the oven! My husband really loved it and he doesn't get enthusiastic about food. I love it also because it's so easy to prepare.

Fantastic! This was easy to throw together and everyone loved it. The sauce was full of flavor and the chicken was nice and tendar. This tastes like a fancy dish that you would have had to spend a lot of time making, but it's not; it's really easy. Make this for dinner guests and they will be very impressed.

I've used this recipe several times and my husband and both my kids eat this.  There's been a couple times where I just used the sauce and poured over the noodles out of laziness. I've used other meats, fish and shrimp are relly good combos if you do not feel like chicken.  Also one thing that I have done that, mu husband really like is while the meat isin the oven, I stir in a can of tomatos into the hot noodles and add dried basil and oregano.

Very nice flavored dish. My wife in particular loved it. I made it last night, and she is already requesting it again for tonight (she wants to put it over rice this time). 

Great recipe, Thanks!

WOW! This was absolutely amazing. My husband could not get enough, he gobbled it right down and even ended up finishing my plate for me! I used only 3 chicken breasts (which left the perfect amount of sauce for 1/2 pkg of pasta). I used fresh chives, fettucini instead of angel hair and added fresh mushrooms. I will be making this again for sure! Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

AMAZING!!! I doubled the amount of wine (it made the sauce just a bit thinner, personal preference). I also sauteed onions, mushrooms, and garlic and added it to the sauce mixture. Chicken turned out tender and wonderful. I have also served it with rice. Will definatly make it again. Thank you!

I followed other reviewers when doing this by doubling the sauce recipe. I also didn't like the idea of baking it so I sauteed the onions and chicken breast (cut into managable chunks). I like things spicy so I added 2 tbs of crushed red pepper to this and lots of spinach. The spinach makes it taste great and gives it color. After the chicken was done, I added the sauce from a separate saucepan.

This deserves five stars for flavor alone! However, the ratio of pasta to sauce was a bit off. I had to double the sauce for 1 pound of angel hair. Also, I like to add fresh chives to really make the flavor "POP"! I've made this one several times now and have passed it on to my daughter, who loves it as well.

I thought it was really good, cheap and easy to make. You need to double the sauce and I will use penne or linguine next time. I liked the mushroom suggestion as well! :)

My family liked it, but I wasn't crazy about it.  My husband said it reminded him of beef stroganoff.  I personally thought the less sauce to noodle ratio the better.

Very good.  Reminded us of Chicken Tonight Country French which we can't seem to find at the store anymore.  I agree with others that you need to double the sauce.  We used chicken tenders instead of breasts.

Great recipe!  I doubled the soup and warmed in a pan.  I cut the chicken into strips, poured the soup over top  and only had to cook for 30 minutes before it was done.  Turned out great!  Thanks!

We absolutely love this recipe.  I make it all the time especially for guests and they always rave about it.  Instead of cooking the chicken breast whole we cut them into bite size pieces. This cuts the cooking time down to about 25 minutes. I also substitute white grape or apple juice for the wine.  Definetly a favorite!

Terrific meal!  I used plain cream cheese, added black olives, minced garlic, and mushrooms in addition to other ingredients. Softened cream cheese needs to be mixed well with melted butter or it tends to separate.  I put chicken breasts in crockpot, covered with sauce, and it only took 2-3 hours on HIGH.  The sauce was a little thin, so I may add more cream cheese next time.  We ate it with fettucini and steamed broccoli.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for something easy, fast and used ingredients that I already had in the kitchen. This fit the bill perfectly. I wasn't 100% sure that it was going to be all that great - but it was actually really yummy. I did make a few changes to fit my needs and preferences. I substituted a can of low sodium chicken broth for the wine, used 2 cans of golden mushrrom soup and used fat free plain cream cheese (I hate chives). I tossed everything in my crock pot and let the sauce start heating up some while I sliced the chicken breasts into strips. I let that all slow cook for about 5 hours. I cooked a lb of penne pasta (unsalted water), and added that to the crock pot and mixed it all up. I also steamed some chopped broccoli and heaped a serving on top of my pasta and mixed that into my pasta separately(since bf doesn't like veggies). It was a good dinner and leftovers (3 days worth of leftovers for us, lol) were good also. This is a good lazy day dinner - I'll use it again.

Our family LOVES this recipe!  I definitely agree this is a dish I'd share with friends and family.  I usually double the recipe, but instead of two cream of mushroom's, I use one and use a cream of chicken for the other.  I also use a can of chicken stock instead of white wine.  We serve with a side of steamed veggies.  Simply divine!

This was off.  I like all the flavors individually, but together was too much, I think.  It also does not look appetizing when it is done, which really doesn't help.  We were able to eat it, but barely.

I made this recipe for guests the other day and was so proud!  It actually seemed that I could cook well!  I used cream of mushroom soup with garlic and used cream cheese with chives and onions.  It was fantastic.  I do recommend making a little more sauce than the recipe calls for to go over the pasta.

I had this the other night and it was wonderful!  The store was out of golden cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic.  Plus, I added a yellow pepper and tomatoes.  I want to make it again, tonight!

This was pretty good. I didn't love it but it made a decent meal. I probably won't make it that often due to the high sodium content.

Hubby and I absolutely loved this.  Mine came out a bit thicker than I like so I added some milk.  I used fettucine noodles and I used shrimp instead of chicken and then added a little parmesan cheese.  Could have just about passed for an alfredo sauce but no more worries about it being grainy.

This recipe was good but I know it could be better.  This was a fault of my own.  I wish I had listened to other reviewers who doubled the sauce.  I didn't double the sauce and should have.  It would have been more creamier (especially for leftovers).  Also, I didn't have a full packet of the italian seasoning (it was maybe 1/4 or 1/2 packet that I had left).  Because of that is the reason why I think it tasted a little on the bland side.  I'm sure if I had more of the italian seasoning, it would have tasted more flavorful.  I also cut the chicken up in cubes AFTER it was done in the oven, and that made it easier for my little girls to enjoy it.  I agree that angel hair pasta seems too 'thin' for this type of recipe, so I used fetuccine.  I do plan on making this again, using the proper amt. of italian seasonings AND doubling the sauce for sure. I really hope it will taste much better then.  :)

This was very good! Although I was VERY leary of this recipe.  So I saw the huge reviews on this one and was kinda so-so about it.  And yah - the ingredients look odd, but it really is GOOD!  I would do as others state and add some fresh mushrooms (sliced) and let them cook while it all bakes.  I added a clove of garlic just because we love garlic.  No seasoning is neccessary.  The Italian Dressing mix is enough.  I didnt use a tub of cream cheese, I just cut off enough off an 8 oz. block and bought FRESH chives and it was better than the tub I would think.  Its not a cheap meal, but sooooo easy.  And so VERY FEW ingredients, its wonderful.  Not a 5* b/c I consider this a great base recipe.  Add other things to groove on the likes of your own family.  Yum!!!  My step-son and hubby said shrimp would taste great in this.  It would almost be like a Shrimp Alfredo they said.  Bake the sauce for a bit maybe, then chunk in shrimp at the last minute.  Oh Oh- use chicken AND shrimp.....SUPER YUM!!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was delicious!  A little too salty, so next time I will cut down on the italian dressing.  I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, so next time I may try cream of chicken soup.  But, this is definitely going into our rotation, either as is, or with a couple of minor changes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good!  I used regular mushroom soup and added a tbsp. or so of tomato paste.  I had to use cream cheese with chives AND onions, because it's the only one I could find.  Served it with fettucini.  It looked a little funny, and I was skeptical, but it's great!

The sauce was delicious!!  To cut the time I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken and added it to the sauce and heated through.  Then I used rice instead of the pasta.  It was great!!!

Of all the recipes I have tried on allrecipes.com, this is my absolute favorite to date.  I have passed this recipe on to many friends and subsequently become a hero.  The golden mushroom soup gives it a rich, restaurant quality taste.  Kids, husbands, families, boyfriends and pets, all sure to enjoy!  Better than five stars!

This is absolutely wonderful!!! I found the recipe while teaching my gramma how to use her internet one summer, about 8 yrs ago. I made it for my family when I went home and now I am always getting requests to make it. After I moved, I get called and asked...Hey whats the recipe to that chicken you make.  ANd when family comes to visit I get....when are you gonna make the chicken.  I have given the recipe to many family members and friends and it is definitely a hit everywhere I have ever made it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

Great recipe!  We loved this meal.  I had no white wine, so substituted chicken broth in its place and it turned out spectacular.  There were no leftovers.  We will definately make this again.

This was so easy, but it tasted very good and looked elegant.  I didn't change anything.  I did use only 4 chicken breasts which was the perfect amount for the sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

I have not tried this yet (but gave it a 5 based on expectation and did not know how to respond to a member except through a rating-new to this), but was referred to it from the baked pork chops I recipe.  Quick note to Ms. Johnson about not being able to buy wine.  For the pork chop recipe above, that also called for wine, I used a white cooking wine gotten at the grocery store(no age requirement for that-lol).  I use it in anything that calls for wine.  It has been successful so far, so hopefully it would work for this recipe as well.  Good luck.  I can't wait to try this recipe!

Easy, and delicious - what more could I want?  The only changes I made were that I used low-fat butter, which worked fine, and whole wheat rotini.  Great dish, will be making it again many times.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe.  I changed it by adding thin sliced chicken breasts which I hoped would offset the minimal amount of sauce other reviewers had commented about - but it didn't.  The next time I make this I will double the sauce.  Oh, and I also added fresh slices of baby bella mushrooms.  Delicious!

incredible! very easy, fool-proof recipe with ingredients that are usually on hand.  Of course, this isn't low-fat, but it is worth the extra calories for special occasions! It would be 6 stars if I could.

Wow, this was really good! My friends loved it and so did my 4yr old daughter who is slighlty picky. I used cork screw pasta being that the sause is soo thick and it was all I had on hand at the time. I'm gonna try it in the slow cooker next time and bring it to work... my co-workers are gonna love this!!

This was ok. I followed the recipe exactly and had plenty of sauce since I used only 3 chicken breast. I didnt think it was as great as alot of the other reviews however. My husband didnt care for it, so I probably wont make again. It was worth a try though!! Thanks!!

This was an excellent recipe.  My husband likes grilled chicken rather than baked so I prepared the sauce adding cream to the mixture.  (The sauce was a little too thick.)  I served the thinned sauce over the noodles and then sliced the grilled chicken and served on top.  Fantastic!

Heavenly!  This would be just as good without the chicken and eaten all by it's self.  I used regular cream cheese (didn't have the kind with the chives) and added a few shakes of dehydrated onion and some parsley flakes for color.  Yum-o!

Yummo! Cubed and sauteed my chicken breasts first. Removed them, and sauteen 4 crushed garlic cloves (I add garlic to everything!!) and half a small diced onion. Then added the rest of the ingredients including chicken and simmered. Stirred in pasta after cooked. No need to bake this, still delish!! :)

This recipe was a big hit! My husband loved it along with my 3 picky children.  I changed just a couple of things.  I only used 3/4 of the package of dried italian dressing mix.  I could not find cream cheese with chives so I sauted fresh chives and also fresh baby bella mushrooms in the butter then added the other ingredients.  I also used 1 cup+ wine(or chicken broth) because I felt the sauce was too thick.  I don't think the sauce needs doubled at all, there was plenty of sauce.  Will definetly make again!

Not that this recipe needs another opinion, but I'd been waiting to try it for awhile and was thoroughly impressed.  It's SO simple!  I usual try overly complicated recipes and found this one very refreshing.  I couldn't find golden mushroom and am not sure of the difference it would have made, but it's great w/ cream of mushroom (all of the comments about the thickness of the sauce I'm sure are a result of using the later).  I used unsalted butter as well and didn't find it too salty in the least.

This was wonderful!!  I used 1/2 the Italian seasoning (per other reviews), but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I did cut up the chicken once it was cooked and added it to the pasta, but I would only recommend doing that if you make double the sauce.  Next time I will serve the chicken breasts alongside the pasta and cube any leftovers...  Don't pass this recipe by!

You must try this recipe - it is great.  I doubled up on the sauce and use bowtie noodles because the angel hair didn't seem substantial enough.  My husband loved this meal as well.  It had a lot of flavor.

I made this as written with the addition of a  few sliced mushrooms. It was not only delicious, but easy for a weeknight meal with pasta and salad. I would give it more stars if I could.

This was okay, but nothing special.  I will give it another try and I think I'll add some crumled bacon and peas.  I used chicken tenders and cut them into bite size pieces.  I sauteed it in a skillet,added the sauce and finished cooking it on the stove top.  Added fresh mushrooms as others suggested.  Definetly worth a try.

I thought this was excellent. I doubled the sauce and served it w/ angel hair pasta. Also served a salad. I would definitely double the sauce each time only using 1 packet of Italian dressing mix, but doubling the cream cheese and soup. I also added 2 cans of sliced mushrooms.

This recipe is great! I served it with garlic bread and a salad with the same kind of Italian dressing as the one in the recipe. If you like mushrooms...i would say go ahead and add more...maybe even 2 small cans. I added one and it could have used a second.

Great . . .BUT . . . there is entirely too much sauce.  Most measurements should be scaled back a bit, or make more chicken and pasta and leave the sauce measurements as listed.  I added sliced roasted red pepper, button mushrooms, minced garlic clove, and pinot grigio.  Was fantastic.  Also used reduced fat cream cheese and healthy request cream of chicken soup with lower fat and sodium.  Perfect combo, esp. if you're adding fresh mushrooms.  Much better with that fresh flavor than canned mushroom soup flavor.

I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but it seems everyone else is, so the 5 rating.  Know that golden mushroom soup is completly different from cream of mushroom soup.  In addition to doubling the soup, I cut the chicken into cubes, coated them in flower and cooked them in olive oil, rather than baking it.

Very tastey! The only addition I made was that I sauteed some sliced fresh mushrooms in the butter before I added the italian seasoning mix. The left overs the next day were even better! Yummy.

This was so good!  I made some changes based on other reviews...cut the chicken into chunks, floured it and browned in olive oil.  I double the wine, cream cheese, and soup, but kept the Italian dressing and the butter the same.  And I served it over fettucine.  Definitely a keeper!!

I hate to be a naysayer, but I just thought this recipe was terrible.  The cream cheese completely overpowered the flavor and left an unpleasant aftertaste, the chicken was tough and chewy, and there was hardly enough sauce to go with all that pasta.  Sorry, but among all the five star recipes that deserve their ratings, I just don't think this one belongs.

WOW!! My family loves, loves, loves this recipe. People at our jobs, in addition to our roommates job keep asking what we were eating. I did season the chicken (thighs) with regular seasoning and then browned them in olive oil. I took other reviewers advice and also replaced the white wine with low sodium chicken broth. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

I thought this was very good! If left as is, it would be way too salty! So I ended up adding milk to the sauce like others have suggested. I also doubled the sauce, and couldn't imagine not doing so. I used half chicken broth, half white wine so it wouldn't taste too wine-ish.

Next time, I think i will also try using cream of mushroom soup just to see if it tastes any better...who knows!

This recipe was absolutely amazing!!  Not to mention it was amazingly simple too.  I took the advice of others and tossed everything in my slow cooker for a few hours.  How could it get any easier??  Next time I will throw in black olives along with the mushrooms I also added.  The olives will be a great match to the italian dressing flavor.  I agree, this has to be one of the best recipes I've used off this webiste.  I will definitely make this many times to come!!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

This was really good and easy. 
 I didn't use wine I used chicken broth and it was just a good. 
 My husband the picky eater said to put it in our menu rotation so it must be good.

Yummm! This dish was wonderful. Great served alone with the pasta or add additional vegetables like broccoli. I would recommend seasoning your chicken when you put it in the baking dish, then covering with sauce. Very easy to make and makes great left overs as well.

This was so good.  I couldn't find golden mushroom soup so I used low fat cream of mushroom and added a splash of fat free milk.  I also used the light cream cheese.  I served over linguni. My hubby loved it and it was easy to make.  Will make this one again for sure.

This was delicious. I made it with korean style spicy beef and some stir fry vegetables. Worked very fine and husband loved it.

This meal was so good.  I added some olive oil to the butter just because.  I also fried some onions in butter and through that in the sauce too.  Instead of the angel hair pasta I used bow tie noodles which was awesome.  I also mixed everything together which made it not salty at all, but perfect.  The chicken was probably the most moist chicken I've ever made.

Absolutely delicious! I'm a VERY amatuer cook, still learning and experimenting, and this was so easy to make yet it was a hit with everyone who ate it, including my boyfriend who is a private chef! Will definately make it again!

This was great. I used chicken stock instead of wine and used egg fettucine noodles, this was a perfect meal. I didn't have to add any other seasonings. Thanks for a great recipe.

excellent recipe, super easy to make and very easy clean up.  I found the wine taste a little strong, but i used a cheap dry white, i think it would go great with a delicate reisling. I didn't change any of the recipe and I found it to be just fine, not too salty and not over powering italian dressing taste. I passed this on to several friends and everyone has loved it.

I ended up forgetting about the pasta and just ate the chicken with the sauce poured on top.  We really enjoyed it and I am already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I can see why it is so popular because it was easy and the sauce was delicious.  It kinda reminded me of the sauce my mom makes for beef stroganoff.  Very good!

Try it and get addicted.  Even better if you pound the breast thin and cook less time.  Easy recipe to change to suit taste.  Made it over 10 times and less butter is FINE, better actually.

This recipe was good.  I had to double the sauce though, as there wasn't enough to properly coat the angel hair.  I thought it would be better because of the 5 star rating.  It was good enough to make again though.  

* Make sure you use really good white wine, it makes a difference.

The flavor was decent-the consistency I didn't care for. Gloppy. Heavy. I agree with the Noodle-Roni comparison.

First of all, if you dont like italian dressing, or cream of mushroom....you WILL NOT like this.  I just think it is personal preference! I read most of the reviews and they all said it was "soo good", so I thought well maybe the flavors combine to something really good. Yeah, I was wrong, because it just did not satisfy my taste buds at all.  I am surprised I ate it. My husband thought it was Okay. However, I am pretty sure I will never make this dish again.

This recipe was very good and very easy to make.  It makes a great weeknight dinner.  I substituted whole wheat noodles for the angel hair pasta, but other wise followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe.  My oven wasn't working so I cooked the chicken on the stove and cut up and added to the sauce.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was very salty, I may try to alter that some way in the future.  It was great the next day too!

AMAZING! I made a few changes that may help those lacking ingredients like I did.  Instead of wine, I used beer. I used veggie cream cheese and then sprinkled with chives. I only had plain condensed mushroom soup and I reduced the baking time by 20 min's. This was more than enough time for the meat too cook and also left it tender.  I was nervous about the changes but this dish was perfect!  I look forward to cooking this over and over again with new alterations each time! A++++++

I rated this recipe a while ago and have made it several times since and through trail and error I have found a process that suits my taste best. Low sodium chicken broth instead of white wine. I have changed my opinion since and it is now one of my favorite all time recipes.

I dont understand the rave reviews for this dish....it tasted like something out of a box.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut the butter in half. I also only used half a package of salad dressing and the flavor was still overwhelming. Chef Boyardee would be just as good.

Awesome recipe.  I made this for my girlfriend as a surprise and it was a total hit -- especially for someone like me who rarely cooks.  I scaled the recipe for 4 servings, and then used it to cover 3 chicken breasts and it was the perfect amount of sauce.

I have made this twice now and absolutely love it. Everyone in the house says it is their favorite. I put provel cheese over the chicken before I put the soup mixture on. I also added a mix of vegetables to it (peppers, snow peas, brocolli, etc.) This will be a regular!!

This was very easy to make, it did not take 30 minutes, only took about 10 minutes.  But, I didn't think it was worth 5 stars for taste.  It does taste good but kind of like Mac-N-Cheese tastes good......  I did not think it was too salty like a lot of other people said.  I made it accoring to the recipe except I used 3 T. of butter vs. 1/4 C.  I might make again because it was so easy to prepare.  Also, I cooked mine at 350* for 40 minutes, not sure why you would want to cook it at 325* for an hour???

While this recipe is certainly quick and easy, the amount of fat in there is over the top.  The baking time for the chicken is also extremely long, practically guaranteeing a dried up piece of chicken swimming in a sea of fat.  All in all, I'd rework this recipe completely to address these 2 problems.

I just made this and even my picky kids liked it.  It was excellent.  East to make, very tasty.  I could not find cream cheese with chives already in it so I added them seperately but it was great.  My husband said cook it again!!

Very good stuff!  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe.  The next time, however, I made some changes.  I used egg noodles instead of the pasta, which was too sticky.  Rice would be good too, but never again would I use pasta with this sauce which turned out like goo.  I used my slow-cooker and doubled the sauce and used lots and lots of chicken ... enough leftovers for days, which warmed up well and kept me out of the kitchen.  Don't bother buying cream cheese with chives.  Just use regular cream cheese and add some chives.

I would give this recipe 3 stars but am giving it 4 because I think with a few adjustments this could be very good.  I liked the flavor of the sauce but it turned out a little thick, especially after it sat for a few minutes.  The chicken was kind of dry as well.  I will try it again cooking it for about 35 minutes at 350 which should remedy the dryness.  To thin out the sauce I would add a little more white wine and/or reduce the cream cheese to 3 oz.  I don't think I'll put the whole package of Italian dressing in either, it was a little too salty for my taste (and I like things salty!). UPDATE - made this again with these changes: used only 3 oz cream cheese, added 1/3 cup chicken broth so the sauce wasn't so thick, reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp and only added 1 tsp of the italian dressing mix.  Turned out very well, easy and tasty dish.

This is amazing! I only made one change, though, as it was so rich the first time I made it - I skip the cream cheese and just add about 1/3 cup of milk to make the sauce smooth. It still has the same wonderful flavor, but without the heavy feel. I've also made it with bite-sized chunks of chicken and have sauteed the chicken first so the bake time was shorter. Thanks for a perfect company dish!!!

This is a very delicious recipe. I added green onion and mushrooms to the recipe. I used bow tie pasta instead of angel hair and I mixed it in with the chicken and sauce. Very tasty

This was so yummy.  Instead of breasts, I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cubed and browned them until cooked.  I sauteed them with sliced mushrooms as well.  Then when I finished the sauce, I added the chicken and mushrooms back into the pan and just simmmerd everything while the pasta cooked.  I'm not fond of angel hair, so I used fusili instead. I'm glad I did, because the pasta caught all that delicious sauce.

Surprisingly great!  I did not think that it would have that much flavor, but the Italian really gave it something else!  My spouse hates mushrooms, however she was fine with the "fungus" in this recipe.  I did not change anything other than the fact that I used 1/3 less fat plain cream cheese instead of the cream cheese with chives and it still turned out very well.  Thanx for a great recipe!

AWESOME!!  I had some Rondele garlic & herb spread in my fridge that I substituted for the cream cheese & chives.  I was worried that there would be too many spices...  but no, it turned out great!!  Next time I might try putting Marsala wine and adding more mushrooms.  YUMMM!!

Fantastic dish! My family loves this!  The chicken gets too dry (I think) if you cook it for an hour.  I cut my chicken into strips and bake for 30 min at 350.

This is a very heavy, but awesome meal! I served this over mashed potatoes instead of pasta, and a small salad.  Would be great on a cold night, a little to heavy for summer.

I gave this 5 stars but dh and the kids outnumbered me with 4 stars--First of all it was extremely easy to prepare which is 5 stars in my book automatically...the kids thought it was a little "tart" tasting (maybe a different wine may have helped that, I used a pinot grigio) dh thought it needed more sauce and would have liked it better if the chicken was in smaller pieces and if it were all mixed together like a cassarole.--picky picky!

This was excellent.Mmm.  I served the chicken with egg noodles which we like better than angel pasta, other than that, I didn't alter the recipe.  I will definately make this again just as it is.  Thanks Marion for the recipe.

Very awesome recipe.  The "pasta" part need not be part of the recipe.  This is more of a chicken bake.  Very important to half the italian seasoning or do whatever you want in order to not make it not so salty.  I used the wine measurement as stated but also needed to lean it out.  I used milk but otherwise would like to try chicken broth next time.  Thanks

Wow, this was soooo delicious!  I changed a few things (mostly amounts) as others' suggested: 1/2 pkg. Italian dressing mix, 3/4 c. chicken broth, 2 cans soup, and 8 oz. cream cheese.  YUMMY.  I'm thinking you could also use rice here instead of pasta.  Now I'd like to try shrimp.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic!  A rare recipe that I probably wouldn't have thought up on my own, kudos to the creator.  Contrary to other reviewers, I thought it was great as written and wasn't too salty.  The only thing I might do next time is add a bit of milk to stretch the sauce a little further.

How can so many people like this??  The bottom line for me was that the flavor was downright weird.  I think it was the wine, possibly substituting chicken broth would be better.  But I'll be honest, I won't be trying it again.

We really loved this!  Because I read alot of reviews about the saltiness I used unsalted butter, 1/2 of the italian dressing mix, and instead of using wine I used 3/4 C of low sodium chicken broth.  I also sauteed some red peppers, garlic, scallions, and mushrooms and added them to the sauce before pouring over the chicken.  I also doubled the soup and cream cheese to make more sauce.  Sooo good!  I would season the chicken before puring the sauce on top too!  Add whatever spices and veggies you like and you will really enjoy this one!

I loved this, but took tips from reviews.  I used 0.6 oz Good Seasons italian dressing mix, 1/2 c. butter, 3/4 c. low sodium chicken broth, 2 cans of Golden mushroom soup, and 8 oz. cream cheese with chives and onions.  I sprinkled paprika on chicken  before adding sauce, cut chicken into strips, and added tabasco and chopped green onion.  Excellent with your favorite angel hair.

Fantastic recipe--reminiscent of "Country French Chicken Tonight" which I love and have been searching years for a recipe!  I tweaked the recipe a bit to curb the saltiness other reviews warned of--used unsalted butter, less of the seasoning pack, and added about 1/4 cup skim milk.  After baking, I thickened the sauce to my liking with cornstarch.  Wonderful recipe--thanks so much!

I've made this recipe many times and my husband and children love it. It is a bit salty but unfortunately my family likes that. Maybe unsalted butter and low salt soup would help. I'll be making this for years to come.
PS double the sauce, it's great!

After extensive experimenting, I have finally found a way around the saltiness. Instead of an envelope of dressing mix, I used the Italian Dressing Mix recipe found on this site, adding as much or as little as I wanted. I used unsalted butter, and good quality Marsala wine instead of white wine. Avoid using cooking wines, as they only add to the saltiness. (If it's not good enough to drink, don't use it.) I also added some half and half, as that also helps tone down the salt, and I always let it simmer, as I don't use the oven for this recipe. If it's still too salty, use some Italian seasoning instead of dressing mix. The sauce will turn out much better this way. I made the sauce by itself, and served it with thin spaghetti and Garlic Chicken from this site. Yum!

Loved it!  My husband, who can be picky when it comes to trying something new, said this is definitely a keeper!  I only used 3 chicken breast but made the full amount of sauce because we like to have extra sauce on our pasta.  It was great!  My only suggestion is to cut back on the butter.  The sauce was a little greasy and some of the butter settled on top.

Like previous reviewers have said, it is a little thick, but my husband ate every drop and told me "its a keeper", his highest form of praise.  I liked it, he loved it.  I made all the sauce for 2 breasts in the 13 x 9 pan.  Next time I will use a smaller pan and hopefully the sauce will stay a little thinner.

This recipe is horrible. Run while you can.  It wasn't too salty...it was just bland.  The butter started to separate from the sauce--this was the most disappointing part of the recipe, and the sauce was too thin at the end of the cooking time.  
It isn't all that cheap to make if the cream cheese, butter, wine, chicken isn't on sale.  I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

This recipe had such mixed reviews.  I thought it was pretty good overall.  Somewhat "processed" tasting, yes, but what do we expect with canned soup, dressing mix, etc?  Which is better to feed our families: canned, processed soups, or heavy cream that is in other sauces?  I don't know...  It WAS salty, would recommend cutting down the dressing mix some.  All in all, pretty good and very easy!

This dish is so easy to make and one that my boys actually get excited to eat.  The chicken comes out so moist and with such a nice flavor.  Very filling.  Left-overs heat up well.

Absolutely fabulous!  I just made it for my husband's birthday and he had 3 huge helpings.  "The best chicken dish you've ever made."  Our kids (even the pickiest one) loved the meal.  The sauce is the best part (I will make extra next time).  The recipe is incredibly easy, stress free and devine.  It is a perfect company dish.  We used fettuccini pasta because we like thicker noodles.  This will be a well used addition to my cook book.

Easy and delicious.  I used unsalted butter, and used 4 chicken breasts with a regular amount of sauce.  Perfect!  Ignore the reviews about this being bland -- it had lots of great flavor.

This recipe is a must try.  I have made it about five times in the past couple of months because my family loves it so much.  Only a few suggestions to make it even better- saute some red onion and fresh mushrooms with the butter in the beginning (I dont use as much butter as this recipe calls for) and double the sauce part of the recipe as others have suggested.  I also use the chicken tenders or the thin sliced chicken you can buy at the store to make the chicken more tasty.  You must try this, I promise it will be a favorite!!

Very good and easy to make.  The only thing I would fix about it is to try and find a soup or dressing mix that had less sodium.  It was little on the salty side but had a very good flavor.

I thought this was an easy and rich way to make a cream sauce.  I only used the ingredients for the sauce and I sauteed the chicken rather than baking it.Then I just put the chix on a bed of pasta and poured the sauce over with garnish of chopped parsley.  I liked this.  I didn't have golden mushroom soup so I subbed a cup of chix and beef bullion combined(cubes) and found it worked well.

Fantastic!  The best meal I've made in awhile.  My parents loved it, and even with the sauce doubled, we finished it off.  I used Rosemount Estates Riesling as the wine, which was perfect.  Another benefit of this recipe:  the wonderful smell it left in my kitchen!

This was really good!  I only used 4 chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was perfect.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Then I browned them in a skillet.  I put everything in a baking dish and and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Great recipe!

Wow, I thought I rated this recipe when I first made it a couple of years ago....well let me just say it deserves the 5 star reviews it's gotten.  It's quite delicious and one of those recipes where you read the ingredients and think "I just have to make this"!!  I have found it to be a little salty, so all I do is add milk to my taste and it cuts the salt and adds creaminess. YUM!! Make this!!!

While this was better than some "soup" recipes, I found it to be salty. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't that special either. I cannot imagine serving this to dinner guests. My daughter did eat it but son didn't.

Easy AND delicious!  I was very skeptical that the raw chicken would cook in an hour at that temp under the sauce, but it did and it was FANTASTIC!  I used 5 or 6 chicken breasts (boneless) was sure to season both sides of the chicken (seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper, paprika, minced onion), substituted chicken broth for the wine, used cream of chicken/mushroom soup (because that is what I had on hand) and I put a couple cans of mushrooms on top of the chicken before the sauce.  We tried it on top of whole wheat angel hair pasta (which tasted the same as the white pasta). Oh, I also used fat free cream cheese, smart balance light butter and fat free italian dressing powder.  I coudn't believe how creamy and delicious it was.  If you like alfredo type sauce, try this for a reduced fat/calorie alternative.  I suppose you could add some cheese to the sauce, but it was just right for us as is.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was just terrible.  I tried it twice because I had a hard time believing that 753 people could be wrong.  Maybe it's the butter and cream cheese combination that everyone loves.  It was too salty, and it felt like I was eating a pound of lard.  Sorry!

This was very easy and pretty good. However, I didn't find it to be amazingly delicious. I will probably make again, but am not in any rush to do so.

Doubled the sauce ingredients except the italian dressing, as recommended by some.  My family went nuts! Loved it! It will be prepared over and over.

MmmMMmm this smelled as great as it tasted. I think the wine was important to the good flavor. I browned some chicken breast pieces on the stove, poured the sauce over the pieces in a 9 X 13 pan, then baked for 30 minutes. Served with broccoli. I'd definately make again; perhaps would add garlic to the chicken as I browned it.

I made this on a hot day, it was very good but in my opinion it's not something to eat on a hot day.  I will have to wait until it gets cooler out to make it again.  It was very good and I know it'll be even better on a cool day.

This is one of our favorites. I tend to double the sauce, but less than double the italian seasoning. If using wine, be sure to use a dry white...once I used a sweeter white, and it really threw the taste off. Also, instead of chicken breasts, I use ground chicken. The ground chicken seems to mix in better with the sauce, and it makes it easy to cook all in one pan on the stovetop.

Like other reviewers, I found this to be salty. I doubled the sauce and used 3 pounds of chicken. Some people thought the sauce was not enough. Maybe because they used 6 breasts, and not 6 breast halves like the author suggests(that would be 3 breasts). The sauce was enough for me. I will make it again, but next time, only one teaspoon of butter, and use regular cheese cream and add dried onions and chives to it, and maybe 3/4 of the packet. I think this will cut back on the salt. Be careful not to overcook the pasta, it cooks rather quickly (5 minutes is good).

This was great!  I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the butter, which I thought might make it too greasy, and only added one packet of salad dressing mix.  I also sliced the chicken into thin strips and prepared the whole meal on the stovetop instead of in the oven.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!!  I will certainly make this again!!

This was so good.  I totally agree that you should double the sauce (it is just that good).  I used chicken broth instead of wine & could only find onion and chive cream cheese, still the best dish I have made.

This was a great dish & simple to make.  I used plain cream cheese & threw some chopped fresh scallions in instead of cream cheese with chives.  The sauce is rich so it's great with pasta or rice as a side.  One little hint make sure you cover this while cooking.

This was very popular, but I definitely agree with doubling the sauce. I only made two breasts and half a pound of pasta and ended up with just enough sauce to go around.

Since my husband is supposed to be watching his sodium intake, I was really nervous about using this recipe after reading all the reviews that said it was too salty.  So I decided to eliminate the salad dressing mix all together, and instead just added some garlic powder, minced onion and a bit of italian seasoning.  Even with the change, this dish was extremely good!  I will definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe last night.  Boy, it was a hit.  My husband loved it and my 11 year old daughter loved it, too.  I used a lot of chicken strips instead of chicken breast so cooking time is much shorter.  Turned out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

The jury is still out on this recipe.  I read previous reviews and have to agree that angel hair pasta is not the way to go when making this.  My family ate it but it was not overly thrilled by it.  I really do not know that I would make this again.

This was GREAT!!!  It was so fast and easy I couldn't believe I had made something so fantastic.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I added a little heavy cream and 2% milk to add some liquid.  I can't wait to try it with the wine.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

wao! How good this is. I did, however, use the sauce for half the amount of chicken and made half a pound of pasta. Otherwise the sauce would not have been enough.

This was great. Cream cheese with chives isn't available in our area, so we used regular cream cheese and added some dried chives. I also used a burgandy wine instead of white and it was fabulous. I doubled the sauce mix the 2nd time because it was so popular on the pasta. Be sure to add some butter to your pasta after returning to the pot - otherwise you'll have a giant tangled mess.

OUT OF THIS WORLD!  My family loved this.  I doubled the sauce so we could have lots of leftovers.  I also served it with rice instead of noodles because I had some left over from the night before.  I will definatley make this again.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I might would do differently is pound the chicken breasts a little thinner to make sure they cooked through. Had to use cream cheese with chives and onion,could not find just chives. would I make this recipe again?? Most Definately!

This recipe is only average and possibly less.  I would never serve this to company.  However, it is simple and easy to prepare.  The flavors do not blend well together.  I will not be making this again.

This was an unusual one, but when all was said and done, it was really good.  Be sure all ingredients for the sauce are blended together.  It took about 15 minutes of periodic stirring to incorporate the flavors while on the stove (if you're like me, you'll notice the initial strong/over powering wine flavor, that goes away once the sauce is cooked down).  The only draw back (and reason behind the 4-star rating) is the amount of oil the cheese and Italian dressing mix produces.  Pools of orange colored oil formed while cooking in the oven.  Luckily, I had already planned to refrigerate the dish and served it the next day.  So, when it came out of the fridge, I was able to easily scrape off the excess oil.  Despite that, I would make this recipe again.

This was awesome! I used chicken tenders and doubled the sauce amount, then and added bread crumbs on top.  I sprayed the bread crumbs lightly with olive oil and then baked. My guests loved it. They all had two helpings. I will make this one many more times!

Wow! This was great. I've already made it twice this month. If you are short on time, cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and simmer in the sauce for 20 minutes on med-low heat, instead of baking. Yummy!

Terrific recipe!  Also works well with "light" alternatives to butter and cream cheese.  Only change I would make is doubling the sauce ingredients.

I thought this recipe was very very tasty.  I made enough for a double serving and froze the remaining.  I also did not have any wine, so I used diluted apple juice instead.  It was very tasty!

After reading the reviews, I also used chicken broth in place of the wine.  I cut up the chicken and browned it in the skillet.  Then I made the sauce ingredients in the that same skillet and cooked it on the stove.  It saved about 30 minutes.  This was wonderful.  My husband who hates cream cheese loved it even more than I.  This is a keeper!!!

Fantastic!  This was one of the best-tasting chicken pasta recipes I've ever made.  It is so easy, and my whole family loved it - especially the kids!  The first time I tried it I used cream of mushroom soup (since I didn't have any golden mushroom), and it was okay, but it is definitely better with the golden mushroom soup.  And if you can't find the cream cheese with chives, you can use regular cream cheese and add fresh chives.  Definitely double the sauce, and you can even use more chicken, to make sure you have leftovers - it's just as good the next day!

This is a very tasty dish and easy to prepare.  My boyfriend loved it.. I thought it tasted a bit salty... and I didn't add any salt!   Next time I might use a reduced sodium soup or cut back a bit on the dressing mix.

This is the most awesome tasting and easy recipe! I don't eat chicken (vegetarian), but whenever I serve it at dinner parties or just to my husband, everyone absolutely raves about it. I've sampled the sauce and it's really the perfect pasta sauce. I suggest buy the best organic chicken you can find. According to my husband it makes this already wonderful recipe even better. Be sure to double the sauce - you'll be glad you did.

This is not something I would serve for company, as the submitter suggests. It's a very easy dinner suitable for the family, though. We thought it was pretty good, but I found the canned soup sort of canceled out the flavors of the other ingredients; also it was a bit salty.

No one in my family liked this. The chicken was tough because instead of searing it before hand to lock in juices it is boiled in the sauce. The sauce itself is oddly flavored and the contrasting ingrediants did not mix well. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I was surprised to not be blown away by this recipe, based on the other reviews.  I found it a little bland, but perhaps that could be because I used regular cream cheese since chive flavor wasn't available.  I also added some fresh sliced mushrooms, which was a good choice, but I would have grilled the chicken first, I think, to brown it a bit before baking.

This was an excellent dish. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used regular cream of mushroom, not golden. I did not think that the wine taste was overwelming at all! I used Ste. Genevieve white. My 2 year old ate both the pasta and the chicken, and my husband who hates spagetti noodles even commented on how good it was! I'll make again soon!

This was absolutely gorgeous! Made it for a friend of mine, I live in England and found it hard to get the salad seasoning and used Italian seasoning instead but will use half the amount of it next time. Who says it's supposed to serve 6!!!

Great recipe. I have made this a few times now. The best response I got is when I added Cayenne pepper. I use the power and just sprinkly it on.  You can make it as spicey as you like. I like it with just a little kick.

Well now I see why this recipe is in the hall of fame!!! It tasted like something I'd order at a restaurant. I am still a beginner cook and found this to be so easy to make. I also used chicken tenderloins as someone else suggested. I couldn't find golden mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom. I covered the chicken with aluminum foil for half of the cooking time. I might double the sauce next time if I am cooking for more than just the two of us. My husband said this ones a keeper! Try this if you haven't yet, you will be pleased!

Out of 5 stars we give this one a 10+. Very good, creamy - I sliced each chicken breast into 3rds and it cooked up a bit under an hour. Excellent!

YUM, YUM...I made this recipe for company and it was a HUGE hit.  When I asked my husband how many stars he would give this he said 8.  I reminded him it was on a scale of five and he replied, "I know, 8 stars!"

This is really simple and yummy. I've made it several times and have discovered that I like it better if I use only half of the dressing packet (less salty). Also, if I'm in a hurry, I simply put the chicken breasts into the saucepan with the sauce and cook them on the stovetop in just a few minutes (as opposed to an hour in the oven). You sacrifice a bit of tenderness this way, but it's a fine shortcut. Still delicious.

After reading the recipe I was concerned it might taste like a "from a box" dinner. I was wrong. This dish was easy to put together and very tasty. I did cut the chicken up before I added the sauce, hoping it would cook faster but it only took off 5 or 10 minutes of the cooking time. It was, however, easy to eat that way. I will make this again many times.

I made this on the stovetop. I sauteed chicken tenderloins in olive oil, made the sauce and allowed it to simmer while I boiled the noodles. Then I tossed it all together.
I thought it was a little bland, and I really didnt care for the smell that the wine gave to it. Next time, I will substitute chicken broth for the wine and spice it up a little maybe w/ some cajun seasoning. My hubby loved it as is, but I have to tweak, I'm sure it can be better.

i LOVE this recipe!  my family always jokes about how much we love to use cream cheese in everything, so i was excited to try this recipe on them.  it does have the richness of cream cheese, which my family loves, but may be too much for some.  this has become one of our classic recipes that my husband always asks for when planning menus.  love it love it love it!!!

I have been making this recipe for three years now and we love it!  A very flavorful dish that is friendlier to my waistline than fettucini alfredo.  (Although still far from low fat)  You have to try this recipe at least once!

Excellent!  I used the Golden soup.  Next time, I will double the ingredients EXCEPT FOR the Italian dressing.  It was very salty but not so much that I did not still like it.  Also recommend cutting the breasts into small cutlets.  I served it with steamed broccoli on the side.

My husband loved this recipe!  I wasn't sure at first, but the more I ate, the more I loved it too.  It will go in my cookbook and that is a big complement since I only keep the really good ones.  Might cut back on the wine just a little though.

I found this recipe to be very salty but otherwise bland.  Cooked entirely on stovetop, I sauteed the chicken in olive oil, onions, garlic and lemon pepper and set aside.   Mixed ingredients to make sauce (except wine)--added red pepper, milk to cut saltiness, frozen peas and mixed in the sauteeed chiken.  Simmered for 15 minutes.  My whole family LOVED IT!!

I didn't like the taste of this at all. The taste of the wine and the cream cheese didn't taste good together. I had bought cheaper wine though, so if I ever tried this again I would buy more expensive wine next time to see if that made a difference.

An absolutely fabulous recipe.  In the past few years that I have made this from off of this site I have NEVER served it to anyone without them requesting the recipe.  It is soooooo good and it great as leftovers too.

Very good! I'm still not sure what made me try this recipe as it isn't the type of dish I normally go for, but I'm very glad I did. Even my 18 month old daughhter and 4 year old nephew enjoyed it, and that's tough to do in the same meal! :) When I make it again, I plan to cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking. Definitely a keeper, thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent.  I would make two small changes.  I would double, maybe even triple, the sauce next time.  I would also tenderdize the chicken (it was tender but would be even better if tenderized.)

The ingredients all sounded pretty good for this recipe, but we found it to be just OK.  I made it according to directions - only changed Angel Hair to Linguine and added broccoli.  The sauce was very thick when made according to directions.  Not enough sauce for the amt. of pasta.  Maybe it is because I used linguine??  OK recipe - I doubt I'll make again.

This is very good.  It is rare that I find a recipe that everyone in my family likes.  I did have to tell my husband not to salt it (he just shakes salt on everything and tastes it after) It is a touch on the salty side.  Very rich, and very easy to make.  My extremely picky 8 year old said this deserves more than 5 stars.  Im giving it five stars based on the fact that everyone was happy and we have no leftovers.  Its not my perfect dish, but I will definately make it again.

I actually made this recipe with my mom two months ago for my brother's birthday. The best! Everyone at dinner that night loved this! We did add some fresh mushrooms and served over steamed chopped broccoli and a side of french bread. Have made this several times since and its now one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes! My mom now has much more faith in my cooking ability! Thanks Marian!

Very awsome sauce...I did double as suggested in previous reviews. I cooked cut up chicken on the stovetop, added fresh mushrooms and added this all to the sauce.  Also used cream of mushroom instead of golden. My family LOVED this!

Excellent recipe!  This is definitely 5 stars because it's an easy meal that tastes like it came from cooking ALL day long.  Next time I will be doubling the sauce, as we loved it so much, we just didn't have enough.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good.  I used chicken broth rather than white wine since I didn't have any at home.  I thought it was just a little salty though - probably from the Italian dressing packet.  Will make again though.

This tasted Great!!! I cut the chicken into smaller pieces, then mixed it with the sause and baked it. I used thin spaghetti noodles instead of angel hair. I am definately going to use this again.

This is a great recipe.  Quick to fix and very good.  I made this one time with Cream of Mushroom soup and then with Golden Mushroom soup and I prefer the Cream of Mushroom.

We did not care for this at all.  It was much to salty.  (Although I have to say our family is not one for the cream soup recipies maybe thats why).

I baked this and made a few minor adjustments to account for what I had in my cupboard.  I used Reduced Fat Cream of Chicken soup and Gnocchi instead of mushroom soup andangel hair pasta.  This was an excellent combination, however it was TOO SALTY.  Maybe it was the package of italian seasoning? I'm not sure.  Next time, I would add only half the soup and half the seasoning, I think.  Broccoli would also be a nice addition.

This was okay.  I only used 4 chicken breasts (it's just me & my husband), and the amount of sauce was perfect.  I don't think I'll be making it again; I expected something a lot better for all of the calorie & salt content.  But for those of you who are trying it for the first time, I would recommend adding mushrooms to the sauce prior to baking and using low-sodium soup.

This pasta was excellent. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked it covered with foil for 40 minutes, then uncovered for another 20 to retain as much of the sauce as possible. Next time I will add fresh mushrooms and maybe even red peppers. Wonderful!

Loved this recipe.  Looking at the ingredients, I would have never thought to mix that combination.  Great taste.  I skipped the wine, but I don't think it made much of a difference.  This is a great recipe for dinner guests or just any night of the week.  My 2 year old finished his whole plate.  Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe was quite good, but I did modify it a little.  Instead of raw chicken, I used a roasted deli chicken that I had frozen in pieces - just poured the sauce over frozen pieces and baked.  Came out very tender!  Now, I didn't use the 1/4 cup of butter, because I figured that the sauce was rich enough with the cream cheese.  Perhaps it tastes even better with butter, (I don't know!), but it is very good even without.  I used a whole cup of wine, and baked it with a foil cover so that I would not lose all the sauce as some people mentioned happens. I would probably uncover it for the last 15 minutes or so, just to get some browning action next time.
 I didn't have cream cheese with chives, but I had some Marscapone so I used that and added some green onions chopped up.  I think that it would go equally well over rice as pasta and will make this again, as my husband liked it very much.

I used diced tomatoes instead of mushrooms and mushroom soup. It turned out really good, except i recommend less pasta for the amount of sauce.

I LOVE this dish!! I made it twice in the last week, my boyfriend keeps requesting I make and can't seem to get enough of it...I added tons of fresh crimini mushrooms in the baking pan. If the sauce became to salty, I just kept adding water, until it tasted just right, it came out perfect both times. Excellent recipe! Thank you!

I'm sorry to say that I didn't like this recipe.  I was disappointed since there were so many great reviews.  I took the suggestions of others and sauteed the mushrooms and chicken first and then baking everything for 40 minutes.  I used fettucini instead of angel hair pasta.  I thought that it was too heavy and thick and didn't look pretty at all.  The other people at the party liked it, but it sure wasn't the hit I was hoping for.

This is great!  I grilled the chicken first, as suggested by others to avoid using the oven in the summer.  I also had plain cream cheese and added fresh chives and a little onion powder to the sauce.  I'm making it again tonight with orzo instead of angel hair.  This is a GREAT recipe.

This was wonderful.  I am not a chicken lover, but ate every bite because the sauce was so good.  This would be a wonderful dish to serve for guests- great presentation and would appear as though it took a long time!

This is my absolute favorite recipe!!! Double the sauce and prepare to have a dish so wonderful it could be served at Olive Garden! I am dying to try it with seafood sometime instead of chicken!

I loved this.  However, next time I will grill the chicken and make more sauce.  The chicken was a little bland, but the sauce was yummy.

My husband now has a NEW favorite dinner. I substituted cubed chicken breast and apple juice rather than wine. It was ready immediately (no baking) and the kids loved it!

This is a wonderful dish! My husband requested that this become "a regular" at our 
dinner table! I added freshly grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley as a garnish
to this dish.

I will definitely make this again and again. Very easy recipe!

I tried this recipe for my family on Mother's Day.  It was quite the hit, even with the kids.  They're all picky eaters and all 3 said they loved it! I think I'll double the sauce recipe for bread dipping next time.  I also added sauteed muschrooms on the side for the adults.

I doubled the sauce ingredients like so many suggested. I didn't have salad dressing mix so I substituted 3 teaspoons Italian spice blend. Used regular cream cheese and 3 teaspoons freeze dried chives. My husband and I loved it and it wasn't too salty. A keeper!

My husband and I almost fell over when we took the first bite.  I don't know who created this recipe, but it will stay in my book forever!  This is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever tasted.  I even made it two nights in a row once!

Very good.  As others suggested, I doubled up on the sauce, but did not find this dish salty at all.  I only wished I would have added more salt to the pasta.  I also used bow tie pasta.  After cleaning his plate, my husband said, "This is good."  That is rare.  My two year old also loved it.  I will fix this again and again.

I will definately make this recipe again but will find a way to cut down on the salt.  Even my children said it was way to salty
and they think they need to add salt to everything.  If there are any suggestions out there as to how to cut salt without flavor, please let me know!

I thought baking 1 hour to be too long. It dried the sauce. I will shorten the baking next time. I loved the taste though. It is so easy to make too.

This is a terrific chicken dish!  I often take this dish to new moms, and it is very welcome.  I cut down the butter to 1/8 cup, use the reduced-fat cream cheese and fresh chopped chives, and use only 3/4 of the dressing mix.  These steps make it lower in fat and less salty.  Delicious!

Tasty Recipe.  I thought the sauce was slightly salty.  I added more wine to the sauce before cooking in the oven hoping to curb the saltiness; I seemed to help alittle and did not make the sauce too thin.  I would make this again and probably add some portebella mushrooms.

This recipe has made its way around my entire family and everyone is raving about it.  We add sauteed sliced mushrooms to the chicken.  I think doubling the sauce recipe is a great idea so you have plenty.  This is definatley a "keeper".   Thanks for sharing.

this recipe is WONDERFUL! Made it for large group of high schooler and everyone liked it.  I cut the chicken up in bite size pieces, which made it very easy to serve to a large group, and didn't take as much chicken.

This was awesome!  I remembered the comments about there not being enough sauce, so I only used 2 chicken breasts, 2 1/2 oz of angel hair and did the rest as is.  It was the perfect amount for two people.  Fabulous recipe, will definitely be making it again!!

This has a wonderful, unexpected taste to it.  I do agree with other reviewers to sautee the chicken first- it has more flavor.  I also double the sauce because we put it over spaghetti, and there doesn't seem to be enough suace unless I do.

My husband and I cooked this recipe for dinner together. So you know it must be pretty easy. The sauce is totally delicious.  We don't like mushrooms so I substituted Cream of Chicken soup for the mushroom soup. It was great.

This chicken dish is wonderful! My husband raved about it and it really does make great leftovers. I took a previous recommendation to make extra sauce and was glad because it's wonderful and you want more.

One of my favorite recipes from this site! I gave my step son a gift that included this recipe (with my mods)a nonstick frying pan with all the dry ingredients as well as a gift card to Publix for the other stuff. He made it for a dinner party and needed minimal assistance. My changes include cubing the chicken and pan frying it, then adding the sauce ingredients, doubled. The sauce is delicious and we really enjoy the leftovers. My husband always asks for this when he gets to choose dinner. EXCELLENT recipe, thanks!

This recipe is so popular with my family, even my children, that I make it every week. When I have company for dinner they always ask for seconds. I double the sauce recipe because we like a lot of sauce. I also add small sliced pieces of red bell pepper to the sauce before baking. I also add some white pepper to the sauce. Yummmmmmmm!

A super easy recipe to make.  Appearance wise, not an "attractive" dish. Used boneless, skinless breasts. Husband and son loved it. I don't eat pasta, but the chicken and sauce was good. Will make more sauce next time.

Really easy and really good.  The sauce on the pasta was a little bland, so I would put a little salt in it.

I only used four chicken breast and barely had enough sauce.  If I use more chicken in the future, I will double the sauce.  It was yummy!!!!

My husband and I loved this dish. We decided it was the best I had ever made yet! I made mine with unsalted butter and low fat cream cheese, and added portabella mushrooms that were sliced on top. I think that without the mushrooms it wouldn't have looked as "restauranty". I will definetely make this quick dish again!

Unbelievably easy, unbelievably good!  Even my very picky kids loved it!  I used lite cream cheese and cooked the dish for my daughter's birthday.  It was a hit.  I'll be making this again SOON!!!

This was a huge hit in my house, there wasn't ANY left over! I think the seasonings are perfect, but if you loathe salt, try a reduced sodium version. Personally, I think it was perfect the way it is! I will definetly make it again!

by far, the BEST recipe I've ever made for chicken!  A fantastic mixture of flavors.  The sauce is incredible - the most rich and flavorful I've ever tasted.  Very highly recommended.  Well worth the effort to prepare this dish.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!  I can't wait to make it again!

You can't help but be skeptical from the ingredients, but my husband and I loved it.  I actually only used 4 breasts and thought the amount of sauce was perfect... also served it over rice.  Can't wait to make it again!!!

This dish was amazing.  I am a teenager who made this for my family and they thought it tasted great.  It was very simple to make, and although it takes some waiting while it cooks in the over, it is definately worth the wait. A suggestion is adding regular italian dressing instead of the powder-it tates the same, and it's more likely you'll have it around the house.  Also, use fresh chives and regular cream cheese-it tastes great!

I was skeptical to try this recipe after reading the ingredients.  But after reading the rave reviews I had to try it.  I also doubled the sauce and loved it.  I will probably make just the sauce next time, I ended up with too much chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very tasty.  My only suggestion would be browning (and possibly cutting into chunks) the chicken before baking.

Used fettuchini instead of angel hair and used Vermouth instead of white wine.  Both worked wonderfully.  Tons of compliments with none left over.

This recipe is great!  I used cooking sherry instead of wine - what a wonderful flavor - and added some broccoli and shredded carrots for color.  Try substituting shrimp in the place of chicken, very tasty.  This recipe is a "KEEPER."  Thanks for sharing.

I like the flavor of this dish.  I agree that the original recipe is way too salty.  I think that wherever sodium can be cut, do so.  I used low-sodium mushroom soup on my first try, yet it's still not enough.  I'll try reducing the amount of dressing mix next time.

I also doubled the sauce, using 1 can of mushroom and one can of chicken for the soups because I'm not a big mushroom fan.  Even with low fat soups and cream cheese it was excellent.  Most things I make with wine taste too wine-y but this didn't, very good.

I thought this would be a great dish to celebrate my first dinner in my new apartment. It was great! I used water instead of the wine, but it was still good. I think maybe sauteed onions would make a great addition and/or bacon??

Thanks to everyones suggestions I doubled the sauce recipe,added mushrooms and browned the chicken [I would not bother browning again]
It was quite good-but SALTY -better the next day -when the pasta absorbed some of the salt-used penne-it reheated better

Tried this recipe for company.  I received rave reviews.  Even my very picky 14 year old asked for seconds.  We had it for leftovers the next night and he wanted seconds again.  Made double sauce as was suggested by others.  Will make it again!!

This was a great recipe for adult company. I will use it again and again. Soon into the cooking time it received compliments for how good it smelled from two rooms away. I do not think that  this chicken  would be as appealing to  younger children  as adults and teens but I will be in a situation to test that claim in about a week and may change my mind.

This dish is WAAAYYYYY TOO salty.  I was really disappointed in this meal after reading so many favorable reviews, and I agree with all of those who warned against its saltiness. Taking the advice of some of the earlier reviews, I doubled the sauce recipe and added some fresh sliced mushrooms, but even using only one package of the salad dressing for the doubled recipe, and all low sodium or "lite" products, the sauce was still WAAAYYYY TOO salty. The chicken does come out tender and moist, and the sauce has a pleasant buttery wine taste, if you can get by the intense salty flavor.  I couldn't.  Not a good dish to make if you are watching your blood pressure.  I would neither make this again, nor recommend it to anyone.

I had company over the first time I fixed this and they loved it.  My husband thought it was too potent (probably the wine).  Next time I may add a little less wine.  I thought it had a wonderful flavor.

Fantastic! I loved it and it was incredibly easy! The flavor is great, the chicken was very tender and I can't believe it was that simple to make. I'm serving it twice in one week since we liked it so much.

Excellent recipe - we loved it.  We doubled everything so we could have leftovers.  We browned the chicken and then baked it with the sauce for about 1/2 hour.  Will definitely make again - especially for company!

They put the sauce on the steamed broccoli as well as the pasta and chicken.
I agree about doubling the sauce!

This dish was absolutely delicious.  I think it is one of the best things that I have ever put into my mouth.  It was so easy and quick to make too which made it even better. And I did make enough for leftovers.  Can't wait until tomorrow.

I made this dish for my family last night. I thought it was great, my husband and 2 children thought it was just "good." I was disappointed in their reactions! I used chicken tenders instead of whole breasts. Overall a good recipe.

Very easy to make and good flavor. My husband loved it. Next time I would look for reduced-fat, reduced-sodium ingredients for the soup and the cream cheese.

This is very good.  I suggest like most of the over people to double the sauce.  Also add of mushrooms, onions, and bell pepper if you like.  Everyone loved it and it was very easy.

This recipe really turned out great.  My boyfriend and my dad both loved it and it was really easy to make.  I think the sauce definitely needs to be doubled, though.  I had just enough even after I doubled it and I only made 4 chicken breasts.  Very delicious and I will be making this again and again. :)

Good and easy recipe, especially for adults.  Kids may rather have the sauce and chicken on the side.  A little rich...you may want to use other ingredients to cut down on the fat content of the sauce.

Don't worry if when you first cook your sauce, you think it smells and tastes horrible.  I did, but once it had baked for an hour with the chicken, the wine flavor had mellowed and it was very good.  The chicken was moist and tender.  Be careful that you don't overcook your angel hair pasta, (it gets very mushy if you do). i made this for a murder mystery dinner party and everyone seemed to like it.

This is my favorite dish to serve guests. It's always received with rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I double the sauce recipe and thin it down with up to 1 cup more of wine (I use a fruity White Grenache).

I live in an international community and we often house students for sports.  This recipe is an easy and delicious meal and has been a hit for all.  The aroma from the italian dressing is wonderful also and whets the appetite!

The sauce is delicious, but I find it is better served with the pasta or something else on the side rather than on top of the angel hair pasta.

Great recipe, as my niece puts it "it taste like restaurant food".  I would never substitute chicken broth for the wine as I've read many reviewers have stated, it's not the same recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used four chicken breasts and cut them in half so the sauce was plenty.  It had an excellent flavor prepared exactly as the recipe states and I am looking forward to making this for company.  It is definately a notch above the average.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  I didn't think it was too salty, but if you're going to double the sauce recipe, use 1 1/2 packets (.6) of italian dressing.  I also browned the chicken in seasoned flour and baked, uncovered, at 330 degrees for 35 minutes.  The chicken was so tender that you didn't even need a knife!

Excellent recipe and great for dinner guests.  I have made it several times and remarks were made that this recipe is NOT too salty.  I did double the sauce the last time I made it.  I sauteed chopped onions and sliced mushrooms in the melted butter.  I served this with the Strawberry and Spinach Salad. AWESOME MEAL!

I used the milk and it was still too
salty. Next time I'm going to cut back
on the Italian seasoning too. This was
really good and easy but not a "top 10"
Will be making again.

This is a delicious recipe!  I baked it at 350 instead of 325 and for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The chicken was so tender and it had a sort of stroganoff taste to it.  And it freezes well.  I'll definitely make this again!

I sliced the chicken into strips, dipped it into a seasoned flour mixture and browned
it.  I added mushrooms, onions and celery to the pan
and sauteed them.  I poured the sauce over
the chicken mixture then baked it 35 minutes.  I also had trouble
finding the cream cheese with chives so I used cream cheese with chives and onion.  Tasted great!

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I think next time I might grill the chicken, cut it into strips and toss it with the sauce and noodles.  My husband said that it is definitely a keeper!

When I made the sauce, I tasted it.  It was too salty.  So I added water until it was just right.  It turned out to be very delicious!!!  My sister tried it and never believed that I cooked it.  She thought I got it from a restaurant.  She even asked me for the recipe so she can try it herself.

Best recipe I have found on AllRecipes yet! I have made this myself three times and shared it with family and friends. It is delicious! I even used some of the sauce on steamed broccoli -- yum! I had trouble finding the cream cheese with chives, so I just used plain and added two good tablespoons of chopped fresh chives.

I had some leftover baked chicken which I cut up and put into the sauce on the stove. I doubled all the ingredients except the italian dressing seasoning. A big hit with the kids and a great way to utilize the leftover chicken. Will definately add to my recipe box.

Makes great sauce, but I think that if I cooked it again I would dice and sautee the chicken rather than bake it.

This was incredibly easy.  My husband and I both really enjoyed the meal.  I served it with pasta, and we had left overs that just were all around yummy.  I did make extra sauce, as we like lots of sauce.

A couple more ideas for using this recipe that I've tried.  One is that with leftover chicken, I chop it up and put it in the gravy and we put that over the noodles.  I have also taken chicken strips, dredged them in a seasoned flour mixture, then using the butter from the sauce, I've browned the strips. I then add the rest of the sauce ingredients (usually doubled).  This has been a good way to serve it for company - stretches the chicken without losing any of the yummy flavor.  I've also added a cup of chicken broth to the sauce to cut down on the richness.  I'm glad everyone likes it so well.  Marian

My husband said it's a keeper.  I doubled the sauce though, and was probably just about enough for the three of us (I used only 3 breasts).  It was different, and it had a nice taste.  I'll most likely make this again.  Only thing is, I used chives and onion cream cheese because I couldn't find chives only cream cheese. I dunno if others have run into the same problem.

Pretty good! I made a few changes based on our family's tastes: 
-I used spaghetti instead of angel hair,
-I made only 3/4 lb of pasta but only used about 1/2 lb (we like our pasta saucy), 
-I cut up the chicken breasts into chunks,
-When it was done baking, I removed the chicken, out the sauce in a skillet and sprinkled 2 tbsp of flour and cooked until thickened.

So good and really easy. I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut up the chicken into 1 inch piece.  I made it with the angel hair and it was good, but then made it with Parmesan Asparagus Basmati Rice and it was even better!! This will be a staple for us!

Delicious even though I had to make due with regular soup, it would have been even better with the golden mushroom soup.  Sauce came together very easily. Key is to premeasure the ingredients and have them in the order you will be using them.  Chicken was not dried out but slightly bland.  Next time I will poke into the chicken so the sauce can get into the breast while cooking.

I loved this! So quick and easy! I used Yellowtail Chardonnay for the wine (good cooking wine). This was much better than expected and loved by all! Even my picky granddaughter!

We have made this recipe for  close to 10 years now.  It is always a family favorite and often requested as a favorite birthday meal.  The only adjustment to the recipe that we make is that we double the sauce portion.  Big hit!

I wanted to try something different for my family dinner and I saw this recipe and found it easy to make.  The family really loved it! The only changes I made was that I added slices of jalapenos to the mixture just to add some heat.  I didn't include the angel hair pasta but accompany the chicken with white rice.  I will definitely be make it more often.

This recipe is great as is!!  I just recommend doubling the sauce or cutting the amount of chicken in 1/2 for a better sauce to chicken ratio.  The cream of golden mushroom and white wine truly make this recipe special and I don't recommend subbing those out.  I always add fresh mushroom before putting it in the oven... so delicious!  My kids love it too.

wow! amazing dish!! I made this last night, with only minor changes, I used chicken stock vs. white wine, and penne pasta instead of angel hair pasta. and I also added fresh mushrooms.
Next time, I might add spinach.
and maybe add more cream cheese, the sauce was a little thin. but the flavor was awesome!! A must try!!

I substituted heavy whipping cream and fresh chives, since I didn’t have any cream cheese. The chicken breasts I’d bought were unexpectedly huge - each was significantly bigger & as wide as my fist. I only cooked one; so, I ended up doubling the ingredients for the sauce. The sauce wasn’t thick/heavy, since I used heavy cream. But, given that angel hair pasta is a more delicate pasta, I prefer a lighter sauce.

The first one was undoubtedly better than the 2nd - where I used the recipe’s portions. I did my usual herb and butter pasta; so, that likely enhanced the flavor. 

I had some doubts about the sauce after I’d mixed and tasted it  But, I took a leap of faith. Everyone loved it; so, I’ll definitely use this recipe in the future.

This was a hit in our house! We have some picky eaters & it's hard to find a dinner that all 7 of us like. I did use chicken broth instead of wine (I didn't have any) & used regular cream cheese because of the picky ones not liking chives but this is a definite staple in the house now. Thank you!

Big success - I followed the recipe but did double the sauce.  I used wine and I did just use one  1 ounce package of simply organic garlic vinaigrette because that is what I had in the pantry.   That garlic gave it a great flavor.

Made exactly as recipe directed: delicious! If you're looking for an easy, go-to recipe, this is it. The richness of the sauce makes it seem like it took hours. My parents and in-laws love it when I make this...I get requests for it frequently. Since I have small kids, I think I will occasionally use the penne or rigatoni noodles to keep down the messiness. I have also cooked this in the slow cooker with great results. This is one you could easily add veggies, like mushrooms, or tweak it with a different flavor, like parmesan cheese, for a nice change. A keeper for sure!

Couldn't find the golden mushroom,  so I used cream of chicken. Used regular cream cheese with dried chives. Also sauteed a shallot, green onions and minced garlic and browned the bite sized chicken in a Pan,  while the sauce simmered. Transfered everything into a baking dish and baked for 20 minutes. Served with wheat spaghetti and broccoli. Delish!

The sauce is rich and   out of this world good. I  followed the recipe to a tee, but I backed down from a  5 rating because of the baking time. Again I followed the recipe and baked 60 minutes. The chicken was way too over cooked. It looked good but it was tough.

Loved this! I made it exactly as the recipe said to see what I thought before making any changes. I thought it was delicious as it! If someone wants to substitute things I think they are looking for a different kind of recipe. If that's you, go for it. My chicken turned out very tender and flavorful. Big fan!

This has become a family favorite. I double the sauce because it is always in demand for extra helpings of pasta. I make more angel hair available on the side. Adding a few tablespoons of dried chives will work if you only have regular cream cheese.

Very easy,yet delicious dinner to throw together. I generally don't keep cream cheese with chives, so normally add the chives separately, but still very good.

We absolutely LOVED this!!! And believe it or not, I froze half of the batch and the result was just as good!! I emptied it into a oven safe dish, added 2 tbsp of water, covered it with foil and cooked it at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes. Yum!

I made this, though not exactly like it says. I used double the cream cheese, 1 can of golden mushroom soup, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. No butter, used chicken broth instead. I forgot to add the Italian dressing mix . I sliced the chicken breast into strips and baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. My husband who is very picky, loved it. Who would have thunk it.

very easy and the chicken turned out so moist.  I salted the chicken breast out of habit and that was a mistake.  it made it a little too salty but still delicious.

This is a staple in my home. We make this often, even my 7 year old loves it. The only changes we have done. Double the recipe if you like a lot of sauce. We also cut up the chicken before serving. Any pasta works, and once you make it keep extras of the ingredients on hand for the days you end up craving it

I followed the directions exactly. We had a huge amount of noodles leftover, and no more chicken. Would double the chicken next time, might try to make it in a new way to use shredded chicken instead! My family and I use a scale of 1-10, and the ratings were: 6, 7, and 8. Will save to make again.

I've always used ground chicken to make this recipe as a meat sauce.  I also added fresh mushrooms and made it in a slow cooker.  The mushrooms I put in about 30 min before serving.  Everybody loved it.

This recipe is very simple to make and the sauce is very delicious.  I followed this recipe and made substitutions with the sauce: I used 1 packet of seasoning, 1 can of golden mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sauvingon blanc wine,  doubled the butter (used 1 stick), added 1 Tbsp garlic, added 1 can chicken broth, and used entire brick of cream cheese.  The Golden Mushroom soup and wine were what made the flavor so amazing (in my opinion).   I lightly sauteed my chicken first in butter and olive oil with salt/pepper, then finished in oven baking.  Added sauce over angel hair pasta and finished chicken.  This one is a keeper!

This dish was very easy to make and was a smash hit for all. I always double sauce when I serve over pasta. My family made certain they got every drop. Really, really tasty and rich.

I've made it many times as is.  It is 5 star.

Over time because my health needs have changed and I need to add more vegetables to my diet, I've added the following (all saute'd prior to adding to the sauce) - 1 8-ounce container of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 a head of small green cabbage, 1 small head of broccoli chopped up, and the full 0.75 ounce container of chives chopped.  I also add 1 cup of cream to the sauce to cut the saltiness.

I make the sauce first (without adding the mushrooms), put the sauce and frozen chicken breasts into my Instapot with a 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  It takes about 10 minutes on high pressure with a natural release.  You need to make sure the chicken has sauce beneath it in the Instapot so that the chicken doesn't burn.  If the chicken isn't cooked thru, put it back into the Instapot and add 3 minutes.  Then I shred the chicken in my KitchenAid mixer with the bread paddle.  Sauce and shredded chicken then get added to the cabbage, mushroom,  and broccoli mixture I saute'd.

I doubled the sauce as others recommended and I will always make it like that.  I think he pasta would be a bit dry otherwise.  IT was delicious.  We love mushrooms so I sliced them and through them in the sauce right after the butter melted.  A new family favorite!

I tried making this again thinking I did something wrong the first time and it looked so good in the video I decided to give it another shot. It wasn't a good dish and I don't recommend it. It was bland and makes a lot, so my husband and I had to eat it for a few days. 

Follow other people's suggestions to make it good or just don't make it.

Made this a couple times. Didn’t like how the chicken breasts looked so pale after putting it into the oven so my second time making it I grilled the chicken on the outside and cut into bite sized pieces and mixed into the pasta. I used a rotini noodle and it grabbed up the sauce nicely and made a nice casserole style dish. Definitely going to make this again maybe as it is in the recipe but browning the breasts first so it looks a little nicer when serving.

Made in crock pot- great flavor and super easy-we make this all the time!  You can use cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup for a creamier taste. Also omitting the butter seems to make this less oily and taste didn't change for me so that's how I make it now-it was a happy accident haha

After a long day of running errands, I found this recipe for an easy dinner.  Made exactly as written but used cr. of m-room with garlic because that's what I had on hand.  Quartered  two yukon potatoes (instead of rice or pasta), threw everything in  one dish and baked for one hour.  I loved the medley of flavors and our chicken breasts weren't boring for a change.  Will make again!

Oh my......... this is so yummy and will be made again!  If I could give  this dish ten stars, i would!   My chicken breasts were huge, so i cut them into smaller pieces.  I didn't have any wine, so substituted chicken broth.... I'm sure the wine will add an extra layer of flavor when I make this again.  I followed the advice of other commenters and doubled the sauce recipe.  I also added fresh mushrooms, thyme and cayenne pepper.  Thanks Marian  for a wonderful meal that  was enjoyed by everyone with lots of rave reviews  = )

Loved this recipe! I used a mix of Italian herbs instead of the Italian dressing mix to cut down on the salt and I didn't have wine so I substituted with chicken broth. Will make again.

Made this last night.  Picture looks nice and ingredients sound like it would be really delicious but we thought it was rather  bland.. Something missing.  Will not be making again.

Really enjoyed this.  Didn't have the dry Italian dressing, so used bottled sweet Italian and it worked just fine.  Enjoy.

I made this in my new crockpot with a sauté element. I heated up the sauce ingredients on 350 and then added the chicken and set on low for 5 hours. It turned out moist and very tender, easily shredded and combined with the angel hair pasta. I added steamed asparagus and a loaf of Portuguese sweet bread (also found on this site), and we were set. The family loved it and we will be making it again soon!

One of my very favorite, quick and easy chicken dishes. I always read reviews before I make a recipe. I made this one as written (ingredient wise). I think it's perfect just the way it is. You need to be sure you're using the correct cream cheese here, that's what sets it apart. I read a review of someone using regular cream cheese which would give the dish a different taste all together. I enjoy serving this over pasta or mashed potatoes. Perfect!

I have made this a few times. It's very easy and impressive. I double everything except the pasta and reduce the chicken to 3 or 4 breasts, each cut in half.  I add minced garlic to the butter and before I pour the sauce over the chicken, I add 8 ounces of sliced baby bella mushrooms, which cook in the oven in the sauce.  I have made it both with chicken broth and with white cooking wine.  The sauce tastes so much better with the wine and I'm a non-drinker!

This was deeeeelicious. I was missing a couple of ingredients so I substituted canned mushrooms mixed with cream of chicken soup instead of the condensed mushroom soup. I also didn't have dry Italian salad dressing mix so I made my own with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, parsley & celery salt. I covered with foil paper during baking so it would be juicer to make sure there was enough sauce for the pasta. It was just right. A definite keeper. I'm eager to try it in the slow cooker.

Love this recipe, BUT I made this all on the stove— Semi-cooked the chicken first with butter then removed the chicken and made the sauce in the same pan. Used chicken broth instead of wine and used cream of mushroom only because I couldn’t find golden mushroom soup. I added the chicken back into the pan with the boiling sauce to soak in the flavor from the sauce. Super easy, quick, and delicious! Next time, before I add the ingredients for the sauce in the pan, I’ll sauté garlic and chopped onion to give it a much better flavor.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using 1/2 can of chicken broth in place of the white wine and I only had cream of chicken soup on hand.  No one in my family will normally touch cream cheese (of any sort) or cream of "...", however everyone is asking for more of this and everyone had seconds!  I cooked it in my convection oven so I cooked it for about 35-40minutes.  I will definitely make again!

I chg'd the measurements to 4 servings and then used the basics of this recipe in the crock pot with a pork loin roast.  It was amazing!  I cooked (from frozen) the pork loin in the golden mushroom soup w/ 1 cup water until it was at about 135 degrees.  I prepared the remaining ingredients for the sauce per recipe instructions and added it to the soup already in the crockpot.  I let the pork cook until it was 170 degrees.  I placed pork slices atop the angel hair pasta and poured sauce over top.  My 16 yr old son gave it a thumbs up. Will definitely make this one again.

Made recipe as is. I liked how quick and easy the dish went together, but the golden mushroom soup was too powerful and all you could taste was canned, condensed soup. Won't make it again.

I made this dish with 3 chicken breast yet still made same amount of sauce.  It turned out great for us.  We liked having the extra sauce for the noodles and dipping the chicken in.  If I ever made all six breasts, I would double the sauces portion but that is me.  I like it saucy.  :-)

OH MY FREAKING GOSH!!! This sauce is so flippin good!!!! Definitely do not replace the wine with chicken stock because the wine makes this sauce. I think next time we’re going to try it with double the sauce and use crab meat instead of chicken.

My 13 yr old gave this a 10 and my other 2 gave it a 7. I gave it a 7.5. It was very good but not outstanding.  I only had a smaller amount of chicken for the 4 of us. (1lb 8oz) so for the last 15 minutes I added in some cold cooked cut up lefterover chicken. It made the sauce better.  For the sauce I first fried some onion and garlic with the butter.  Then I added plain whipped cream cheese with the green part of a green onion which is like chives.  One can of soup and a tad more of the wine. It was great! Since I didn't have as much chicken I think I should have cut down on the cooking time. It was still moist but I hate over cooked chicken.  Over all a great meal and all 3 boys ate it which is always a plus.

Uniquely delicious. I would say an odd combo of ingredients to make the sauce to go over the chicken, but it smelled and tasted good. I personally wouldn’t of chosen angel hair pasta because once it sits too long even with adding olive oil it just clumped together. Maybe bow ties or regular spaghetti would be better for next time. Otherwise we served it with broccoli as a aide. Husband liked it a lot he ate 2nd helping. Definitely enough sauce for everyone. Sent recipe to father in law. We make it first and if it turns out good we send Home recipe.

I added one onion and a package of fresh mushrooms.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, pepper, cayenne pepper and thyme to the chicken before I added the sauce to it.  It was great.

Absolutely Amazing! Used plain cream cheese, added to sauce  8 oz fresh sautéed mushrooms in very little olive oil  and 2 fresh green onions sprouts.  The wine I used was a Chardonnay. Doubled the sauce  for the Veggie fans that had the pasta with sauce only. 100% a keeper!

Delicious!  made in the slow cooker just because the weather is mil and we have the ac turned off.  worked great that way.  was out of white wine so i used white wine vinegar.  i cut back the amount. just added splashes and tasted until i got just the right amount of tang without overpowering vinegar flavor.

I made it for dinner last night for my hubby. Was I supposed to use Italian dressing (7 ounces)?  He told me the Italian dressing was a bit strong so I assume I should have used the dry Italian dressing.  It was still very good with the dressing in my opinion.  :)

Loved the sauce and chicken was so tender. I did add more mushrooms. As another reviewer mentioned this is definitely a company worthy recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I am a sauce person, and this sauce was very good. I cut the chicken into strips and sauteed some mushrooms that we added on after it came out of the oven. Hubby didn't care for the sauce, but he's not a fan of wine sauces. We will definitely make this again, perhaps substituting chicken stock for the wine next time. A good recipe!

I'd suggest reducing the soup to limit the sodium content.  Otherwise this dish is wonderful.

I did as one person posted and doubled ingredients and cooked on slow for 5 hours in crockpot.  I had white zin., so that's what I used.  This was so DELICIOUS!!  Will definitely make again :)

I improvised to save some time and a trip to the grocery store but I don't feel it sacrificed taste in any way. I used a rotisserie chicken cut into pieces and a can of cream of chicken instead of mushroom and added the chicken after the sauce was prepared. This completely eliminated the oven portion. Also substituted for the Italian seasoning packet by following another Allrecipes suggestion using a .7 oz equivalent.  For those reviews that said it didn't have flavor, this may solve for that.  I also didn't use the chives (simply forgot) and didn't miss it. Toss in some frozen broccoli and meal in under 30 min. My son loved it. Would absolutely make again.

I did not make any changes and, just as advertised, it was delicious as is.  However, I have friends who made it and used parts of a whole chicken (or more chicken breasts or other parts, etc.), and then doubled the sauce and said it worked, also.

My daughter is the pickiest eater imaginable!  Not only did she love this, but she made it entirely on her own.  We're teaching her to cook, and this was a great starter recipe.  We didn't make any major changes to the sauce, but did sprinkle some dill weed over the chicken before covering with the sauce.  Great weeknight recipe!

This is great, so much flavor! This is my new favorite way to make chicken breasts. However, I only used 3 breasts and had just enough sauce for them, if I were making 6 I would at least double the sauce recipe.

I made this and it was great. I did add salt to the finished product but that is simply personal preference. I love angel hair and that is wonderful but it is also great with brown rice as a substitute for a more hearty carbohydrate.

Added a few cloves of garlic to the sauce.

Next time:
Add more wine to sauce to make it thinner
Dice tomatoes to put on top of sauce

Made exactly as recipe stated, with the only difference, we had it with mashed potatoes instead of pasta.  I think that was a better option.  The gravy is a little on the thick side, so as gravy over mashed potatoes, it was great.  The only thing I will do next time is half the amount of the Italian dressing mix...too salty.. Simple and delicious!

I made this using the whole 8oz of flavored cream cheese. I don't drink so I used red wine vinegar. Last of all I didn't have a packet of Italian dressing,    so I sub it out for Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and a little sugar. Oh yeah I put a half can of cream of mushroom, because I made eight breast halves and the golden mushroom wasn't enough sauce. This all worked great. It was a delicious meal.

Delicious and easy. Important to get GOLDEN mushroom soup -- I was about to grab cream of mushroom at the store and the flavor would've been much less interesting. Didn't use chive cream cheese, just used normal. Try to get the cream cheese to room temperature before stirring into the sauce. Added some heavy cream to stretch the sauce further; chicken broth would work too. 1lb of pasta is sort of overkill but nice for leftovers.

I love this recipe, it's my go-to one when I'm stuck on what to make for dinner! My husband even begs me to make this every time I ask him what he wants. Instead of wine, I use chicken broth and it still tastes fantastic!

Very good and easy to prepare but leans slightly towards the salty side (however I don't like salt so that's probably just my opinion).  I made this as is as should you,  except I used the whipped cream cheese and chive in a tub - (be sure to measure only 4oz tho!).  I would absolutely NOT substitute the wine. I think that is what made the dish special and got rid of the canned soup taste.  Adding  more canned soup like chicken broth just sounds way to salty and bland.    I do see this being more of serving to company  dish then just preparing it for weeknight supper so I will make it again next time I entertain.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was a snap to put together and I could do other things while it was baking away. I found the sauce mild but flavorful and very creamy. The only change I made to the recipe is I used skin-off, bone-in chicken thighs because that is what I prefer. I will definitely keep this recipe in my cooking rotation.

I made it twice. Once with Spaghetti and once with Rigatoni  both came out great. The only change I made was I cut up the chicken rather than whole breast. When served I added a little red pepper.

I made this for Valentine's Day and I will be making it again and again!!!  IT IS DELICIOUS!!!  And so easy.  It is a little bland in color but what it lacks in color, it makes up for in flavor!!!  I did add a little more than called for when making the sauce because my chicken breasts were so big I wanted to make sure I had enough sauce.  It was perfect.  Grandbabies loved it too!

So flavorful! This is a restaurant quality dish. I used thighs and chicken broth because it's what I had and cooked in the crockpot. The leftovers were fabulous. I will make this again and again.

This was great! Everyone loved it. I only had to change two things. I do not eat mushrooms, so I used celery soup (from this site) and I used chicken broth instead of wine and made it in the slow cooker. I will be making this often. Thank you for another great recipe.

I used (4) Medium to Large Chicken Breasts. I cut them in Strips. I doubled the butter, white wine, condensed golden mushroom soup, and Philly cream cheese with chives and onion. I did not double the dry Italian dressing. Chicken was perfect and tender and the sauce was totally delicious. Excellent recipe. Thank you!

Loved it and so did our dinner guest but a little salty and didn't put any salt in it so don't know if it was the soup or the dressing mix but will check that out the next time.  Would definitely do this one again.

This was excellent. Very tasty!  I added mushrooms to the sauce while preparing to give more body to it.  It added to the overall quality and flavor of the dish.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a big-time winner at our house. My husband likes a lot of sauce with his pasta, so I used 3 chicken breasts and kept everything else the same. Absolutely delicious! This one goes in the keeper file!

Made it exactly as listed except for plain cream cheese (didn't have the flavored kind). The only white wine I had in the house was a Pinot Grigio, so used that.  Overall, it was good. I liked it, but didn't *love* it. My mother on the other hand *loved* it. My dad and I both thought it was a bit bland. It definitely needs a little something more to spice it up.

Amazing.  I pounded the chicken then dredged through egg and then Italian-seasoning breadcrumbs.  Sautéed chicken in frying pan, then baked for 30 minutes.  It keeps the chicken nice and moist.

Delicious pasta. Perfect creaminess in the sauce with great flavour. I often 
do this when we have dinner guests and they always love it!

I made this for the three of us still at home and used fresh chicken breasts which were HUGE so I only cooked two and HOLY COW! So Good! my picky daughter even ate seconds.  doesn't call for salt or pepper but you should salt and pepper your breasts before adding the sauce. And salt the noodle water it makes a difference. So easy but I would call this an intermediate recipe though as I could see how a beginner may have trouble but if you are a beginner and want to try you CAN DO IT!

Amazing chicken dish. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I also swapped out the wine for chicken broth, I personally don't like wine. And wow.. it was delicious! My husband says it's a must do recipe again.

1.) I thought the chicken was dry and should have been cooked less.  Maybe as much as 15-20 minutes.  2.) I felt the sauce lacked some oomph.  Yes, it was nice, but it just seemed bland.  3.) And most importantly,  would I make this dish again?  Probably not.  It was just 'okay', and therein lies the key point of the review.

My house hates mushrooms so I use cream of chicken with herbs, and I'd rather drink wine than cook with it, I substitute with chicken bullion, like others I double everything but the chicken. I've made this in a crcok pot and in the oven, birth equally amazing. This is straight amazballs over mashed potatoes and a fresh hot loaf of French bread...get you some.

I made this in the crockpot without any adjustments and it turned out great. I used half chicken thighs and half chicken breasts.  Will be making this again.  My teens loved it. 
One commented it was bland.  We eat all types of ethnics foods: vietnamese, indian, thai, middle eastern, south american, polynesian etc on travel and local restaraunts and this was flavorful just not intense like some cuisines. .Tastes as you would expect for the ingredients.

Whole family loved it, even the very picky grandchildren. I made it exactly as written. It was very quick to prep. Only think that would make it better would be lowering the sodium content, but that would change the taste.

Like many here before me...I used 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup white wine,  2 cans golden mushroom soup, a pkg of sliced mushrooms.  Also, sauteed 1 onion & 2 pieces of garlic in the butter.  Added the mushrooms. Deglazed w/ wine, then added cream cheese & juice  of one lemon.  Cooked only using cooktop...saw no advantage to baking.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Considering how easy this is...it deserves 4 stars just for ease of cooking.

Made it exactly as recipe indicates.  Not super overpowering with spices, but was good and had good flavor.  My picky daughter said, "Not my favorite, but wouldn't mind if you made it again."  So in our house, that's a good review.  Other than the baking time, it was quite fast, and if you wanted to quicken the overall  cooking time, you could cook the chicken on the stove-top and add it to the sauce.  Will make again.

Everyone liked this one a lot. Reminded me a little of chicken paprikash, so it has my vote! I was weary about how salty the dish would be with the full packet of seasoning and the canned soup, but it wasn't too salty at all! Easy and quick meal for sure! I'll try this one in the crock pot next.

I told my husband when I was putting this together that this would either be wonderful or inedible.  After one bite we both agreed--it was wonderful--restaurant- quality.  Only change I made was to add garlic powder to the sauce mixture.  Will be making this one again!   Could easily be done in a slow cooker.

I'm not a cook, I bake. So when I venture into making meals it's a risky business. But this recipe intrigued me so I gave it a try. I really liked it but then I like anything that's cooked and not nuked from a box. I thought at first the sauce was way too salty but in the end, it was just right. I attribute this to the salad dressing mix - I don't usually use that stuff so didn't know what to expect. It's an easy way to add spices. My store didn't have golden cream of mushroom soup so I used Cream of Mushroom and Chicken. I also added 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms. It seemed like a good idea. I didn't use the cream cheese with chives because I don't like onions or chives. I just used plain cream cheese. Oh, and I used 4 chicken breast halves instead of 6 - mine were really thick and rather than thaw out another package, I went with the 4. It turned out pretty darn good. It made a lot though so I'm going to freeze some of it to enjoy later. I really enjoyed the excuse of opening a bottle of wine for this recipe. In fact, I'm still enjoying it.

Inexpensive and quick Is a win. Didn't have any white wine on hand so sub'd it with a can of chicken broth. Added in finely chopped sautéed garlic & onion with fresh pepper. Also threw in black olives, parmesean & covered with cooked broccoli. Everyone liked it and will make again.

Turned out pretty good!!  I forgot to get the Italian dressing packet so used some Italian seasoning I had at home, used penne pasta instead of angel hair, and used chicken thighs because that is what I always use. Good flavor and really didn't take that long at all to make.

This was disappointing. Gloppy, tasteless. I'm shocked at the reviews. I made it because of the great reviews. 
Followed the recipe exactly. Tasted like a quick, cream of mushroom soup recipe.

Made it exactly like the recipe except I used regular cream cheese. It was a litlle too salty for me.  Next time I will add a dash of sugar to cut the saltiness.

My family loves this  dish! It is delicious and the best part is, it's easy to make!  We always double the recipe so we have leftovers!!!  My husband doesn't like mushrooms so I substitute Cream of Chicken with Herbs instead of Golden Mushroom!

Excellent dish. Followed the recipe. Next time I'll add chicken stock because my sauce was a bit thick. If that doesn't work, I'll double the sauce. Cut the chicken in super thin strips. I cooked the chicken in a skillet, removed the chicken, then made the sauce in the same skillet. yeah baby! Baked it for 25 minutes only.

Our house absolutely loves this meal! Of course we are sauce people so I tend to double those ingredients. I also add onions, garlic and mushrooms. I have found others that didn't like it when they made it themselves and then realized they've used Cream of Mushroom soup not Golden Mushroom soup. So if you're going to make this please make sure you use the correct one. It will make a world of difference!

I doubled the ingredients as suggested by another reviewer and cooked it in my crockpot as suggested, thickening the sauce with a roux , then served it over penne pasta.

The flavors worked really well together; the only critique I have is that it was way too salty - probably because of all the processed food ingredients.

It was very good. My  boyfriend loved it. I didn't have a package of Italian dressing so I followed a recipe for one, probably adding a little more than this recipe calls for. it reads delicious anyway.

This was a very good recipe. I did make some changes. My husband is on a low sodium diet so instead of using the package of Italian salad dressing mix I just sprinkled Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning on the chicken breasts. I also used heart healthy cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom. I added a 7 ounce can of no salt added sliced mushrooms drained and about 8 ounces of cream cheese. I used 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup sherry. The flavor was very rich and delicious. I served over linguine because that's what I had. I definitely will keep this in my rotation of chicken meals.

I made this last night for dinner and did make some changes based on the reviews. I sauteed garlic with the butter and then added the wine to let it cook down a bit. I used one pkg of country herb dressing, two cans of soup and one small tub (8oz) of the chive and onion cream cheese. All things considered it was tasty but was still very salty. I added about a 1/4 tsp of sugar to try and cut the saltyness (is that the right spelling? lol) and it helped a bit but not much. Overall very good but next time I will use low sodium everything and see if that helps.

I love this recipe!!  Just the sauce alone is amazing!!  I'm considering making it without the chicken and simply serving the sauce over the angel hair pasta!  So YUMMY!!  It's definitely one of my favorites!!

This was delicious.   I took the advice of many of the reviewers and doubled the sauce ingredients  (did not double butter and seasoning packet).  It wasn't too salty.  The wine is a must as it added a good flavor.  I used chardonnay. I used 4oz chicken breasts and they were very tender, not dry as some stated.  This will definitely go into the regular rotation.   Maybe next time I will try it in the crock pot.

My family liked this. Though we might do two packets of dry Italian dressing.  Was a little low on the spices for flavoring.  And we are thinking of using rice next time.

I love this recipe and everyone I make it for loves it too. 
A few times I have substituted the wine for chicken broth, it turns out delicious every time.  If you let your cream cheese sit out of the fridge to soften up a bit, It will be easier to blend into the soup and wine.

I just made this for supper this evening and it was excellent. The only thing I had to change was the Italian dressing mix, as I couldn't find it at 3 different grocery stores. So I used Ranch mix and it still turned out great.

I really liked this recipe but did follow other suggestions. I cooked/browned the chicken first. I did not have the Italian seasoning so I used ranch with adding garlic and it came out really good. I made the sauce in a separate pot and when the chicken was done, poured the sauce over it.  Family loved this and will make again.

Between the soup and the spice packet this recipe is way too salty. The consistency is also more goo than sauce.  I doubled the cream cheese and added 1 cup heavy cream to cut the saltiness and thin out the consistency. Even with these modifications it was still salty. If you are going to make this start with HALF the spice packet (or use a low sodium one) and then add more to taste.

I've been making this for years now. everyone who has tried it has absolutely loved it. I use chicken broth instead of the wine and original cream cheese. I add some cayenne pepper to my chicken when seasoning, for a little kick. I also quickly sear the chicken in a skillet prior to baking. While baking I keep it covered. Every time it's come out delicious!

I would give it 4 stars, but my family really didn't like it. (They gave it 2 stars.)  I doubled the sauce, and I was glad I did so.  I didn't put 2 full packets of Italian dressing into the sauce:  instead, I added 1 packet for my doubled sauce recipe.  Then, once all the other ingredients were in the sauce, I added more dressing mix "to taste" (1.5 packets).  This worked, and I could control the salt.

My all time favorite chicken recipe for so many reasons!  I always have ingredients on hand, takes minutes to put together.  Tastes fabulous every time.  I make the recipe as listed and I wouldn't change a thing!  Restaurant quality, definitely can be used for a fancy dinner!

My husband thought it was bland but I liked it.  Next time I will use Pinot Grigio instead of white cooking whine.  Also, I will pound the chicken breasts to 1/2", flour, cut in half, fry to 50% done and then finish the recipe as stated.

Omit the cream cheese....not needed. I've made this dish several times. It's a home run with kids & adults. Only I packet of Italian dressing is needed. The flavor doesn't lack...just perfect! Easy after work meal.

Pretty good, made some changes: melted the butter in a big wok, added 4 cloves garlic, then added strips of chicken breast with some black pepper, red pepper flakes, and a touch of italian seasoning.  Then I added the can of mushroom soup, cream cheese, and one cup of chicken broth. Also added some fresh lemon juice and zest of half a lemon. Stuck this all in the oven on 325.  While the sauce/chicken was in the oven I boiled some rotini along with frozen veggies (broccoli, carrot and cauliflower--california mix). Drained the veggies and pasta, and tossed the chicken and sauce with the pasta/veggies.

My family said this recipe is their new favorite! I sautéd some onions and spinach in the butter and then used 1 can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom. I also used 8 Oz of cream cheese. It was amazing. I broiled the chicken on the side with lemon pepper seasoning since my youngest doesn't like chicken.

I did not care for this recipe. You basically make a soup and put chicken into it in the oven. Even with the addition of minced garlic and ginger soy sauce this was just incredibly bland, the chicken was dry.

Too much Italian dressing. I even doubled the soup and cream cheese to 1 pkg dressing. I agree with others, the wine and Italian dressing were not a good combination.

I really liked this chicken recipe. I absolutely cannot stand cream of mushroom soup so i used cream of chicken instead but made no other substitutions. My chicken was way overcooked at one hour of cooking. I recommend that you check your chicken at about 40-45 min. I did that the second time i made this and checked with a instant read therm. You really need to do this or you may end up with dry, chewy chicken. The sauce is really delicious and i have served this over rice also and very good that way too. A keeper recipe. Just don't overcook the chicken.

OMG, this tasted like a dish from a nice Italian Restaurant. I did do some things differently. I sauteed fresh mushrooms, Shrimp, onion and garlic in butter then put them in the baking dish and made the sauce. Used two cans of Golden Mushroom soup, and 8 oz of the cheese, half plain and half chives and onion. Used a  cup of wine. Do NOT substitute for chicken broth, as this did make it .I covered it in foil for the first 40 minutes. I also put some fresh steamed Broccoli on top. Served with some baked Baguette bread. It was  fabulous! I think the shrimp made it awesome!

Ok, I used white grape juice instead of the wine as I don't do al-cohol, I used cream of mushroom soup since I couldn't find the one mentioned in the ingredients, and I used Penne pasta since I like it more. Kept tasting the sauce along the way to make sure it's good and it turned out great! Not as thick as I would've wanted but it was still amazing!

Sauce has potential. Prepared as is except didn't have chives in it.  The only chives with sour cream I saw was 'whipped' or with onions.

I am eating this all week. I substituted the wine for an equal amount of chicken broth. Great taste. I'm new to this, however, and I'm not sure how to get juicier chicken breasts. Covering with foil wasn't too helpful for that endeavor.

I made it once as written, and again with some fresh mushrooms sautéed in the butter with 1/2 Sauvignon blanc and 1/2 chicken broth. I loved them both, my wife and daughter liked the 1/2 wine and 1/2 broth version more, but still raved about both. Great, easy recipe.

I made the sauce as written, but only had 3 chicken breasts.  I cut them into strips so I could reduce the cooking time down to 40 minutes to appease a hungry 2 year old.  lol.  There were a few reviews that said it was too salty, but I did not think so.  I had white cooking wine that I used.  I'm sure it would taste even better with a higher quality wine.  But overall it was good, and even my grandson ate it...he's 2 and extremely picky.  It isn't as exciting as I thought it would be, but definitely better than I expected.  I also did not think it was bland as one review stated.  The chicken by itself is, but short of injecting flavor into the breasts, you will have that.  The sauce is great as it is in my opinion.

Very good. The chicken was moist and it had great flavour. The only thing that I would do different is put a little less white wine in it.  Only because my kids could taste the wine flavour.  But great for adults. I also browned the chicken first in a pan.  That way it doesn't look like boiled chicken.

We've been making this for years. It's a favorite. I've never used butter and we always eat it over rice.

My entire family loved this recipe. The only thing I would do differently next time is add a jar of mushrooms. Delicious!

I love the taste of this recipe, but I did have to alter it. I use 8oz of cream cheese instead of just 4. I also use 2 cans of soup. One cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken. I also double the wine, but still only use one packet of Italian dressing. I add my own seasonings to it as well. (Wild Tree Garlic Galore) Cover when cooking and it creates enough sauce to properly coat the noodles that you'll serve it with.

I normally don't rate a recipe because so many others already have ....but this is the Best Recipe I have made from  here.  Only change was using vegetable cream cheese as it was all I had.  Yes will definitely make again.

This came out great and family enjoyed it.  I added a small can of mushroom since we are a fungus loving family.  I also made mine with pork chops although I'm sure its even better with chicken.  Instead of 1 hr in the oven, I did mine at 200 for 3 hours in a covered roasting pan.  Pork chops were tender and everybody wanted 2nds.

This recipe was a huge hit!  We have mushrooms allergies so I used cream of chicken and broth instead of wine.  The only problem was not enough sauce. I'll double it next time.

This is a good recipe... However I prefer it to be in the slow cooker over a few hours and served over rice pilaf instead of pasta. It definitely is a go to meal in our house!

I've made this 2 times now and love it! So does my family! I have not changed any part of the recipe except for using 3 whole chicken breasts instead of 6 halves, only because I live by myself. Very good and tasty recipe!

Great recipe, although you don't need to add the butter. Mix one can of soup, 1/3 c milk, 1/2 cup wine, and only half the packet of Italian dressing mix. It's a lighter and lower sodium version. Still plenty salty and tastes great!

I made the recipe as directed. We loved it. It was a little salty I would probably use unsalted butter or low sodium soup next time. I doubled the sauce recipe b/c of other reviews. I will continue to double the sauce each time I make it.

This was a great recipe! It tastes like pasta roni but the GOOD KIND! Not processed that you could only take two bites out of. 

Reading the reviews and from watching the video, it looked like there wasn't enough sauce. Since I was only using 3 breasts I kept the original sauce measurements so that it would double itself.

The additions I made which tasted absolutely fantastic was sautéing a little sweet onion, fresh mushroom and 1 minced garlic. I then put that mixture as a bed before laying the chicken (I didn't mix it into the sauce because I didn't want to alter the taste). When I made the actual sauce mixture I also added aditional 2 garlic cloves to that. 

Besides that I think it was fantastic and will make it again!

This was delicious. Just to add extra flavor and because we really like the taste, I sautéed an onion and 3 cloves of garlic in the melted butter, then added the rest of the ingredients. The chicken was perfectly cooked and was very moist and tender after being baked in the sauce for an hour. This recipe got thumbs up all around and I will definitely be making this again.

This was really good and so easy to make.  The sauce was nice and thick and full of flavor.  I made the recipe using Cream of Chicken soup, since we don't care for mushrooms and chicken broth instead of wine, only because we didn't have any.  We'll be making this again for sure.

Wow! There are few things beyond chicken nuggets and hotdogs that I get my 7 year old to eat. But she LOVED this one. I used cream of chicken soup instead of wine and my sour cream didn't have chives (I didn't feel like arguing with the picky 7 year old). Still, though, it was delicious! Oh, and I add complete seasoning to everything so, naturally, I added it. I just tossed in a little during the making of the sauce. Otherwise, I wouldn't change anything else... Fantastic! 5 stars. I think this one is going to be a regular.

Delicious!!! Substitute the wine with chicken broth, and keep the cream cheese plain instead of with chives! Easy and delicious! My husband couldn't wait for it to be finished because it smells so good while cooking! This will definitely become a staple in our home.

Absolutely will make again

Put a very small amount of Better Than Bouillon base and about 2 tb of Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry. I would also marinate sliced fresh mushrooms in the sherry if I added those. Make sure you don't overcook the breasts.

We love this. Easy and fast. I have made this several times since I found this recipe and will make it again this week. The online change that I have made is to add 2 cloves of  minced garlic.

I love this dish! It's good as is, but of course, I fiddled around with it based on reviews/my own taste. 

I always use chicken broth instead of white wine. I made it with the wine once and just didn't like it as much. That's just me.

What I do now is double the sauce and throw it in the slow cooker. I also add a bag of frozen broccoli. SO GOOD.  

Chicken in the bottom of slow cooker, pour half the sauce on top, then pour in bag of broccoli, then top with the remaining sauce and cook on low for about 8 hours. Heavenly!

Wonderful!  I make this recipe exactly as penned and it is a keeper!  My family eats the leftovers for breakfast.  I made it once without the wine (used broth instead) and my husband said it was not nearly as good.

This was really yummy. The sauce was a bit thin, I think next time I will thicken with cornstarch at the end. Also, I shredded the chicken and added it back to see if that would help as I was making this on retreat. Served over angel hair pasta with a side of broccoli.

So Good!  This is the kind of recipe that you make and less than a week goes by before you start thinking about making/eating it again.  Yummy. (I made per the recipe (no substitutions) with a boxed moscato).  Update.. months later.  I have made on the stovetop with a skillet and chicken strips.  Excellent flavor combo!!!

This recipe was to die for!!!  I have 6 kids ages 9 and under and they all LOVED it!  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't think it had nearly enough sauce.  From now on I'm going to triple the sauce.  I made extra sauce for the leftovers and used chicken broth instead of white wine because I made it a fast way and didn't want to worry about the alcohol not being all the way cooked out.  It tasted just as great with the chicken broth substitute!

I love this recipe!!! Everything look so good, I didn't use Angel Hair, I used Rotelle pasta because a lot of people here in my household don't eat angel hair but other then that everything came out great, I'll post a picture as soon as I start serving. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe

I was a little skeptical at first because of the list of ingredients but decided to try it. This is one of my husbands favorite meals! It's super easy to make and is really flavorful! We both don't like mushrooms but find we love this!

I've been making this recipe for years! The only thing I do different is use chicken broth in place of the white wine and it is always a hit no matter who I am cooking for.

I doubled the sauce as many suggested and followed the directions exactly. Not good. The color threw me off, the pic looks like a golden brown sauce and mine was orange. I wasn't impressed with this at all.

Made as is = 4, it tasted good but seemed to need something. I made it with a side of corn on the cob and pan seared green beans. Now going back and reading other reviews I can see potential to get this recipe to a 5. I ended up cutting my chicken into strips for my leftovers to give the chicken more flavor. I like the idea of maybe using cream of chicken instead and next time adding broccoli but not all my kids like green beans so they did eat them this way. I also have to say that all 3 kids loved and devoured this dish. My hubby and I both thought it needed something, if only seasoning the chicken first and pan searing. Deffinetly a keeper!!

Delicious sauce!! I changed it some just because I don't like the cream soups. So I didn't use the cream soup instead I substituted using chicken broth.  I just tasted the sauce and adjusted with salt and pepper to my taste. The chicken comes out moist. I made with mashed potatoes and serve the sauce as a gravy. It is delicious.

Nothing spectacular about this.  It was very heavy. I think with a slightly thinner sauce and perhaps added broccoli, this could be better.

I love this recipie. I marinated the chicken breast in a cup of white wine and covered them in creole seasoning, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. I let it sit in the fridge for 3 hours. It kept the dish from being bland. Other than the marinade, I followed the directions exactly.

Cut breast into strips and used chicken broth instead of wine. Really was pretty good. Thank you for recipe.

This recipe is amazingly great! I cook for 6 daily, always enjoying a "this is so good" response. I didn't have a chive cream cheese on hand so I added some chopped fresh on the sauce. I also cooked it a bit longer, 75 minutes. Absolutely love it & will be a new fav!  Sides of scalloped potatoes & green beans...delicious!

It was awful...we all ate it because we were hungry, but I won't make it again (and I will often make a disappointing recipe a second time if it has a lot of rave reviews from other cooks on this site--the thinking being that maybe I screwed up somehow?)   I am a pasta LOVER, and it takes a lot for me  to turn my nose up at a pasta dish, but this was really terrible...and nobody in our family of 6 non-picky eaters would touch the leftovers!

I was really happy with this recipe. I followed the recipe this first time and it turned out well. I think the 60 minute cook time may be high for chicken breasts. Mine were a little dry. Since you are pouring the sauce over raw chicken, though, it may be necessary to get the sauce hot enough to kill the cooties. The recipe did not specify covered or uncovered so I opted for uncovered. I used some leftover champagne that I had frozen for the wine and it was a great flavor. Pros:  good sauce, I had plenty of sauce, chicken was tasty, prep was minimal. Cons:  lots of processed ingredients, chicken a tiny bit overcooked, long cook time. I think next time I will try cutting up the chicken into bite sized pieces and use the skillet preparation method and see if the chicken stays juicier, but may lose some flavor in the chicken if I don't cook as long. Plus more time standing over the stove instead of letting it cook itself in the oven. I think I will also add a touch of cream to maybe cut a tiny bit of the "condensed soup" texture. A big batch of sautéed fresh mushrooms would also freshen this up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was my night to make dinner yesterday. I recieved nothing but high praise for this main dish! The only thing I did differently from the main recipe was use onion and chive cream cheese.

Very easy to make and reheats well for lunch the next day!  This was my first time trying this recipe, and will make again.  The wine "taste" did not completely cook away, so will substitute with homemade chicken stock or a half stock/half wine blend next time for my husband's benefit.  My 5 year old has the typical picky eater visual abhorrence of mushrooms so I poured the soup into a bowl to pick out the few mushrooms pieces before adding to the sauce, worked well and she gobbled it up.  Served with some shaved Parmesan cheese on top and some steamed green beans on the side!

Pampered chef covered baker and microwave version:  I have saved this recipe-it was great. I made this a one dish meal by using my pampered chef covered baker-cooked  chicken, removed from the pan-cooked the pasta next in the covered baker- then added everything else- clean up was a breeze-I did use the entire block of cream cheese- didn't hurt the flavor.  Salad and crusty bread- delish-and minimal clean-up!

I followed this recipe exactly as written except I only used 2 chicken breasts and 2 portions of pasta because there were only 2 of us. I kept the sauce ingredients the same because I didn't want to have a partial can of soup left over and thought I could use the leftover sauce for something else. Only thing is, there was no leftover sauce. I don't think there would be enough sauce for 6 chicken breasts. The sauce was just OK tasting. It was very salty. I have looked at this recipe in the past but didn't make it because it didn't sound very healthy to me. Don't get me wrong - I have no problem eating something baked in cream cheese as long as it is worth it. Unfortunately, this was not worth it. I won't make again. I would've given less stars but the recipe was easy and the chicken was very moist.

I'm not sure what golden mushroom soup is.  Apparently it is not available in the St. Louis area.  I used cream of mushroom.  And I only had Marsala wine.  This is terrific.  Loved it.  So easy too!

Yum! Loved this dish but made a few changes. I used chicken broth instead of wine. 1 tablespoon of olive oil in place of the butter and I used low fat cream cheese. The sauce seemed a bit thick and salty so I added about 1/4 cup of water. Used 4 whole chicken breast and about after 30 min of cooking decided to turn up my oven to 350. We had plenty of extra sauce! Will make this again.

Fantastic recipe! I doubled the sauce and used the slow cooker. I only had 5 chicken breasts for 6 people, so I cooked the chicken for 5 hours, took it out, shredded it, then put the shredded chicken back in the pot for another hour. Served it over fettucini. Delicious!

We tried this recipe last night and it was awesome!  This was quick, easy and delicious.  I added cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and minced garlic.  I served it on top of rice noodles with jalapenos.  Highly recommend this to anyone who loves baked chicken.  I will make again no doubt about it.  ;)

Very tasty!  My son (13) said he could taste the wine, so I would suggest using broth instead for the kiddos.  I did cut the chicken into large bite cubes and added broccoli, sundried toms, and a light sprinkle of mizithra/romano shredded cheese to the broccoli before cooking.  Love it!

Not as good as I had hoped.  Lots left behind on plates, except for my husband's, who generally eats anything.  I think it was too salty and the wine flavor was a bit strong for me.  I'm not sure I'll make this again, but if I do I will try to find a low-sodium soup and only use about 1/4 cup of wine, and maybe use less of the powdered dressing.  My husband suggested  the leftover chicken & sauce would be good over rice.

Love this and how easy it was to make.  I used cream of mushroom instead of golden but that was the only change I made.  Next time I might cut back on the dressing because it was a bit salty but my whole family liked this one.

THis is a great recipe.  I added onion, garlic and mushrooms and i feel like those HAVE to be in it.  The mushrooms were our favorite part.  They really soaked up the flavor.  I also think 4 chicken breasts is plenty. That gives you a great sauce/meat ratio.

We tweaked it a bit, we added portabella mushrooms a little bit of bacon. We used more cream cheese to make it a little more creamy. Served with broccoli wonderful combination. Over all an AMAZING meal my family really enjoyed it!!

I used this as a guideline since I only had some of the ingredients. I used golden mushroom and mushroom garlic soups plus a can of chicken broth (no wine). Only had onion soup mix, so I used that and added some garlic powder, oregano,rosemary, marjoram, and  2/3 of a brick of cream cheese. I cut up the chicken since I have kids, and it cooked faster.

My husband loved this and has already requested it again. I thought it was pretty good as well. I did read a review that it didn't have much flavor so I put a little extra italian seasoning which I think helped a little.

I made this tonight and it was terrible. Edible, but completely lacking in flavor. I followed the recipe just as it was written. Very disappointing. I certainly would not make it for company. The chicken comes out very plain, despite all the spice from the dressing mix. I actually ended up just eating the pasta. Worst part is it takes over an hour to make! Don't waste your time!

I hate when people give a recipe a bad review after subbing ingredients and changing it up, so that's not my intent here & why I'm choosing 3 stars.  I just want to warn others NOT to substitute Cream of Mushroom soup for the Golden Mushroom soup. I didn't have Golden in pantry so I used Cream of Mushroom soup & it was not good. However, I don't know if it would have been any better with the Golden Mushroom. I think the odd flavor was coming from the dry salad dressing mix, but not sure.

tried this tonight as I was looking for some comfort food... I loved the taste but it was way TOO SALTY!! Surprised there aren't any reviews stating that.. I never use salt on my food so maybe that's why... I will try it again but will use a low sodium soup and maybe half the package of salad dressing in an attempt to lower the salty taste.. the taste otherwise was nice...  not a bad one but not a WOW for me either... 

I will try it again!

This was very, very good.  So simple and easy to throw together.  My store was out of the cream cheese with chives, so I used the Italian seasoning cream cheese.  I also used cream of chicken soup, rather than the cream of mushroom soup.

This is one of our favorites - with a few things we do differently.  I use white rice instead of pasta.  I also use just plain cream of mushroom and plain cream cheese.  It's fantastic.  Be sure to drink the rest of the white wine you opened for the recipe at dinner. ;)

Absolutely loved this! Used Chablis cooking wine instead of just plain white and cream of mushroom and gave it an extra kick. Served with homemade garlic bread and it was a huge hit :) Will make this again for sure!

I thought this recipe was pretty good...my guests really liked it! I did change it a bit though...I was making for company and wanted it to be a little fancier so instead of chicken I used shrimp and bay scallops. Made the sauce like it said and put it with lingiuni.

The sauce is delicious. It is one of my boyfriend's favorites. Recipe is great as is. I added spinach, just to squeeze in a veggie with dinner, and it turned out great. Next time I will add fresh mushrooms.

This was excellent, smelled wonderful baking too!  So easy to pull together - I threw in some sliced mushrooms because we love them and added the wine instead of broth.  Plenty of sauce for all the chicken and I served it over brown rice.  Yum!

This was good, and EASY.  I halved the chicken and used the same amount of ingredients for the sauce except for the dressing mix. Only used half.  I also used fresh chives to top dish and used regular cream cheese instead of the chive flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty but a tad too salty even for me! I will probably be using reduced sodium condensed mushroom cans next time around. I'll definitely be making this again! Using angel hair pasta as opposed to other types of pasta is key to this dish as well so make sure you use the right pasta.

This is a very good recipe. ONLY thing I changed was I made my own dry Italian Dressing Mix (Debby's) from Allrecipes.com. I used about a tbsp. instead of buying a package. My family has asked for Angel Chicken Pasta twice this week. Well, that means a definite keeper!!!! Leftovers are great. Beautiful presentation and a tasty chicken dish. Thanks for the recipe, Marian.

It was a little bland, but that's probably my fault for buying regular cream cheese instead of the chive variety.  I seasoned the chicken when I put it in the baking dish, and against before serving.  I also added a pack of mushrooms and served it over penne instead of angel hair.  I thought it was decent. My kids inhaled it.  Very easy and fairy inexpensive.

I make this recipe all the time in the slow cooker.  Absolutely wonderful and EASY!  I double the sauce recipes, dump it all in the slow cooker (except the cream cheese) and let it cook all day.  The chicken shreds up nice and easy by the time I'm home from work.  We add the cream cheese at the end while the noodles are cooking on the stove.

Excellent!  Made this when I had friends over for dinner and it was a huge hit.  I added broccoli and kalamata olives and served with cibatta bread, olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.  Delicious!

It was very tasty! Husband who is a picky eater loved it. I have to say though less pasta or more sauce as I only used 3 chicken breasts and there isn't enough sauce except for those 3 couldn't have used 6. Otherwise great!

The sauce is good, would need to at least double the sauce for the amount of noodles in our opinion.  Needs something, just can't figure out what it is.

I was so disappointed in this recipe!  With all the rave reviews, I thought surely this was a great pasta recipe.  I followed the recipe - only doubled the sauce - and, even though it smelled GREAT while cooking on the stovetop, the end result was quite mediocre.  My husband thought it tasted alright, but all I could taste was a heavy, soup flavored sauce with some italian seasoning.  The calories included in this dish didn't make me feel any better - what a waste!  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

This recipe was delicious! The only things we changed were we used chicken broth instead of wine, and regular cream cheese, as we had none with chives. As some of the other reviewers pointed out, the sauce does seem to disappear because of the long cooking time. We make it with three chicken breasts, and it works perfectly. Neither of us are big eaters, and this would never work out as six servings. We have made this recipe several times and prefer it served over rice. Try it! You won't regret it!

Easy to make and tasted great.  I doubled the sauce and added some mushrooms.  I cut the chicken into small slices and cooked in the sauce on the stove top instead of the oven as another suggested.  The chicken turned out a bit dry.  I think next time I will pan fry the chicken and then cook in sauce for just a little bit so that it won't be too dry.  Placed sauce and chicken over pasta and served with some broccoli.

I always read the reviews before making a recipe. Many reviews of this pasta suggested doubling the sauce. I did this, assuming they meant double ALL ingredients in the sauce. Make sure you do not double the Italian Seasoning packet!! The flavor of this dish was so good, just way too much seasoning. The next time I make this, I will double the sauce, except use only ONE Italian Seasoning packet. I also used fresh chives, and topped with chopped broccoli. I made sure to slice the chicken in thin strips, and baked for 50 instead of 60 minutes. Can't wait to make it again.

I followed the recipe as shown except I cut the chicken breast into strips and served with penne pasta.  It was so easy to make and was so delicious. My two kids (6 & 8), my husband and myself all loved it and I will most definitely be making it again.  Thanks for a great, fast and easy recipe!

This was not that great, but it's probably just a matter of taste. I made the recipe exact except doubled the sauce based on reviews and served over penne instead of angel hair. Ater I had started cooking I saw the review with chicken broth instead of wine and a cream of chicken with herb soup instead of the golden mushroom, that may have been more for us.

How fortunate I am to have found this recipe! If I had this dish in a restaurant I'd be wishing I could figure out how to make it. I followed it exactly except that I doubled the sauce. I wouldn't change a thing; it was wonderful... and so easy. Next time I'll try it in the crock pot. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best ever!!!! I made this last week and I never eat left overs and I ate this for 3 days I will make it again this week as I am having company. I used chardonay wine in it and I also doubled the sauce as I like things saucey. Next time I will use penne verses the angel hair and I did throw some cheese on the top just before pulling it out of the oven but it really didnt' need it. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!!

I made this for dinner following the recipe exactly. I doubt anyone could improve on it. It was fantastic. Hubby couldn't stop raving. It was enough for six so I was able to freeze two meals for us. This is definitely my choice for our next dinner guests. Thanks for the post.

Great flavor that would taste great over rice too.  My husband said this was a keeper!  I only used 4 chicken breasts and about 8 oz linguini and the amount of sauce was just right.  If you use more meat and/or more pasta, I recommend you make more sauce.  Plus, a little of this sauce goes a long way.

Very tasty and super easy to make.  We thought the proportion of sauce to chicken was best with 4 chicken breasts.  I used about 10 oz. of chicken broth instead of white wine and didn't use the butter at all, but otherwise kept the ingredients the same as in the recipe.  Would be great with rice too.  Will definitely add this to our list of favorite chicken dishes!

Just made this tonight. Very tasty! You definitely should double the sauce. I cut the chicken into strips, used 1 can golden mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken soup. Added 2 pkg of Italian dressing mix, i small can of mushrooms and used a $10.00 bottle of chardonay for the 1 c. of wine. I did add about 1/2 c. milk to the sauce as it was pretty thick. As the sauce sits, it will thicken up a bit anyway. Baked for 1 hr and 15 min. Very tasty and will definitely make again.

This is delicious and very easy.  I suggest adding thin sliced green onion for just a tad more flavor.

I served this today and have had to run copies of the recipe off for both my daughters to take home . Don't change  a thing, it's perfect, very tender and moist chicken and the sauce is delicious. A plus is that it is so very simple to make.

don't know what I did wrong but not one person in my family liked this sauce! Luckily everyone tasted the sauce before we put it on the chicken or pasta. Would have been alot of food to throw away.

My family loved this! The only change I made was to use the Italian cooking cream cheese and add the freeze dried chives. I doubled the recipe and used my crock pot for cooking after I made the sauce on the stove. It was amazing!!

The golden mushroom soup made me nervous, because of the reviews, so I used cream of mushroon and cream of chicken.  I also substituted Philadelphia cooking creme for the cream cheese.  What a delicious sauce!  I would eat that over noodles, pasta, potatoes...It was great!

Man was I disappointed.  It tasted like a really good frozen lunch I would take to work.  Sure, good for being prepackaged, but I took all the time to make this!! :(  It needed something MORE.  Disappointing.

This is amazing!  I have made the similar version on the site crock pot style and that one is delicious as well, but I would almost argue that this one is even better!  It was a little salty for me but that is to personal preference, so I'll just cut back the dressing mix a bit.  We used three chicken breasts and cut the butter in half and used the extra sauce to coat the pasta better.  Amazing and will be adding this as one of my staple comfort recipes!

Very good and easy dish. I made this with chicken broth since I had no white wine on hand, but next time I would like to try it with the white wine. Also some reviewers stated that they threw in some mushrooms, which I will definitely do next time, some sliced cremini mushrooms would be PERFECT! The only other thing I would recommend is to pick up a loaf of french bread on the way home to sop up the yummy sauce. :) Will make again.

I just tried this recipe last night and it was phenomenal! Even my picky 3 year old loved it. The only thing I did differently was used chicken broth instead of white wine, and I served with egg noodles instead of pasta. Oh, and I added mushrooms, too. Very delicious and will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe as did the rest of the family!! It was wiped out! I did use Philly Cooking cream cheese in the Italian Herbs and Cheese and cook my chicken in a skillet before hand to cut down on baking time. Absolutely Wonderful

I love the idea of this dish, but you really really do need to double the sauce or it doesn't turn out right. I think the recipe should be amended.

Sauce is very good.  I added a bit more butter because it all melted to the pan too quickly.  I also added most of the sour cream and chives to get more sauce.  I only had to cook it for 45 minutes also.  The sauce tastes great and the chicken turns out soft.  You don't need to tweak this recipe...it tastes great the way it is made.

I followed the directions (though I doubled the sauce because we are sauce lovers) and my family really enjoyed this recipe. I think next time I will add mushrooms though. I used white wine and it was terrific. Though I must mention this is a white wine I use for every recipe and I know my family loves it. I would be careful if you are using a wine that you've never cooked with because you may not like the taste that it gives the dish. I will definitely be using this recipe again! Thank you for a quick and tasty dinner recipe!

My "picky" kid devoured it. Made in slow cooker, and just adjusted ingredients to taste. Absolutely delicious

A solid and tasty recipe, but my family and I found it a bit salty for our tastes. It might have been because I substituted chicken broth for the wine (which is what most reviewers recommended), but I added a bit of water in the end and it turned out great. Thanks for this quick and yummy recipe though!!! My mother loved it.

I doubled everything in the sauce except the dressing mix and used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.  Very good and so easy just to pour everything over the chicken and bake!

This was really good and super easy (and cheap, always nice)!  I added some mushrooms and substituted chicken broth for the wine.  I cut the chicken up in pieces and browned in some olive oil and Italian seasoning, then tossed it in the skillet with the sauce.  I didn't bake it in the oven, just let it simmer for a while on the stove to save time.  I thinned the sauce down with a little cream before serving over whole-wheat thin spaghetti.  My husband and I both decided this was a keeper!

My husband came home eating M&Ms, his fave.
I was eating this and gave him a bite.
He put the M&Ms AWAY and grabbed a full bowl of it!
I made the crockpot version with small shells.

I didn't care for this dish too much. I'm glad it was simple, but the white wine overpowered the rest of the flavors. It was a bit too rich and that did not mix in well. I'm giving it more than one star because my boyfriend really liked it. If you like a strong white wine and/or mushroom taste, this is for you! It's just personally not my favorite :P

I made this last night for hubby and son and I have to say that it was terrific and easy!  It made the house smell yummy.  I used the mushroom soup with roasted garlic and plain cream cheese and everything else as the recipe states.  I think it was just as good as something from a restaurant.  There were no leftovers either.

This is so good!  I just used one pound of chicken tenders instead of the 6 breasts - they were probably equal to three breasts - chicken broth instead of the wine, and added 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also baked it in an 8x8 pan. It was absolutely delicious.  The sauce is wonderful and creamy.  Thank you!

My husband gave this a 5 which is rare. I did have to make a few substitutions. I used 2 pounds chicken breast tenders cut into one inch pieces with kitchen shears, 1 stick butter, 1 package Lipton Savory Herb and Garlic dry soup mix, 1 cup white cooking wine (I know, gross right? But I didn't have any of the good stuff - came out great anyway), 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can golden mushroom soup and 1 8oz. block of softened cream cheese with a sprinkling of dried chives. I also sauteed 5 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and one small chopped sweet onion in 2 tbsp of the butter and 1 tbs olive oil before adding the chicken which I lightly browned on one side before adding all the rest of the ingredients. To lessen the dirty dishes, I cooked it all in a large covered skillet on the stove. I used a full pound of farfalle which I boiled separately while the chicken mixture was simmering and tossed the al dente pasta with the sauce in the skillet before serving. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect consistency. I will try this again when I actually have 2 cans of golden mushroom and the dry Italian dressing mix so I can taste the original as well. But with the minor substitutions we made and the doubling of the sauce ingredients, this provided 6 dinner size servings and was really really good. Thanks!

very good.  followed recipe, but doubled the sauce ingredients, and it was the perfect amount.  this is a salty dish, but not overly salty.  thanks for the easy but yummy dish. (the chicken and sauce would also be good over white rice if you are not a pasta lover)

I have to tell you first that I did have to modify it since we had no golden mushroom soup and I was afraid to try a cream soup with this.  So what I did was poach the chicken first and cut it in to cubes and then i made the sauce leaving out the soup and wine and using  a 14 oz can of chicken broth to substitute both.  all the rest i did the same and it actually turned out really good considering!! it was creamy and rich and i did add a touch of parmesan for bite.  I can't wait to try it the original way!!

Very yummy comfort food kind of dinner.  Easy to prepare and delicious to eat.  To speed up cooking, I cut uncooked chicken into chunks and baked in the sauce.  I didn't have Golden Mushroom soup so I used Cream of mushroom.  I like a recipe that has easy substitutions!  Thanks!

Really good.  I used all light ingredients and added sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Also added about a 1/2 c. water in addition to the wine to make more sauce (and make it a bit less salty).

This was absolutely amazing. I found it by starting out with only chicken and pasta and amazingly enough had almost everything I needed. I didn't have the wine so I just skipped it but it turned out so great, my husband finally believes I can cook now!

I make this dish once every couple of months and my family loves it especially my 9 year old picky little girl.  I do add a little more wine maybe 2/3 or a whole cup just because of the long bake time. This is delish and comes out great everytime.

YUMMY!  I accidently used a 1/2 cup of butter, but it turned out soooo good.  Definitely a keeper.

This has become a favorite of mine!  My fiance and I have made it at least once a month since we found this recipe.  We've only ever used plain cream cheese and have tried different thicknesses in the pasta but it is ALWAYS delicious!

I made this tonight for my family, and thought it was too salty.  Maybe it would have been better with plain cream cheese, or less cream cheese and milk to help add creaminess without saltiness.  The salt would have been even higher if I'd used salted butter.   It was easy to prepare, so I may make something like it again, modified for my family's taste.

My family loves this dish.  I use cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom and have used chicken breasts, tenders and even canned chicken when I was in a big hurry.  Love it.

INCREDIBLE.  This is one of the most delicious pasta dishes I have ever tasted.  This is definitely worthy of a 5 star restaraunt.    I will be making this again and I have dubbed this dish as a new favorite.  I did take out the white wine though because I didnt have any.

My family loves this recipe!  I suggest you double the sauce so everyone has enough.  Also, the sauce serves best if it has cooled slightly after coming out of the oven (otherwise, it's very runny).

This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have Golden Mushroom soup so I used regular and added about 2 tablespoons Lipton Onion soup mix.  Didn't have cream cheese with chives so I used 8 oz regular cream cheese.  I don't eat pasta, but served this with English peas.  OMG, the gravy over the peas is like having creamed peas!  I melted the butter in the microwave then stirred in the other ingredients.  I cubed the cream cheese into the hot mixture and stirred until melted.  I cooked this in the crockpot for about six hours on low.  It was a hit!!!

I have to give this 5 stars even though I changed it slightly. Instead of using the condensed golden mushroom, I used cream of mushroom & skipped the cream cheese altogether. It turned out so good that my dinner guests wanted the recipe. Thanks so much! I will definitely make it again when I have company over for dinner.

Cooked in slow cooker. Hubby & I really envjoyed it. Cooked chicken slightly  in olive oil first on stove top. Doubled sauce using 1 can of Golden Mushroom Soup and 1 can of Mushroom Soup, Garlic, Wine and rest of ingredients. Do not use additional salt. Ingredients salty enough.  Served over Whole Wheat Angel Pasta

This sauce is REALLY rich so I substituted the butter with chicken stock.  And after adding the wine BUT before adding the cream of mushroom, I cooked off the alcohol. To save time, I salt and peppered the chicken, browned it in olive oil (using a spray) and finished cooking it in the sauce on the stove.

This is a FIVE star recipe. But since I changed the wine to chicken broth It wouldnt be fair for me to give it a 5 after changing one of the ingredients. I have had this cooking in my crock pot on low for about 5 hours. Just had to give it a taste! WOW it  is deliscious!!  I have a few girlfriends coming over so I wanted something  simple but  tasty. And I definately made the right choice!!!  When I first made the sauce it was a little to salty (probably from the broth) but after cooking for a few hours the chicken juices  thinned it out just enough to balance the salt.  Is a keeper for sure!!!

I couldn't find packaged dry italian dressing mix, so used a recipe on here to make my own. With that, it was FANTASTIC!! Next time I'm going to try breading and cooking the chicken separately, them topping with this sauce as I think that'd be great texture.

This was very good! I substituted chicken broth for the wine and cream of chicken soup for the mushroom soup due to personal preferences. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very good. Very tasty! It will definitely be a regular in my house. My 5, 3 and 1 year olds loved it!!!

This was amazing & so easy!  I did add a cup of sliced mushrooms and a chopped onion. Like other reviewers, I sauted that with the chicken and garlic and then finished it up on the stove as I didn't want to turn the oven on.  I'm giving this recipe to my kids as I think they'll love it too!

Wow.  This was so simple and the chicken was like butter it was so soft!  My husband liked it as well.  I ate it with a salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and the balsamic vinegar complemented the meal nicely.  I will make this again!

My 1 year old loved it.  I also thought it was good but not spectacular.  However, I changed a couple things.  I used the slow cooker, added broccoli and substituted the wine with chicken stock.  Served it over basmati rice for my son and egg noodles for me.

I enjoyed this dish but I also felt that it was somewhat salty.  Next time I would be more selective about the Italian dressing mix that I add to minimize salt, and probably just use regular cream cheese.  I also added tons of fresh mushrooms which gave the sauce a little more volume.  I think on its own it may have come out a little runny.  All in all it was a good dish.  I will definitely make it again.

Delicious and so easy to make! Meat is so tender, juicy and flavorful! I made some changes (added less wine, some chicken broth, sauteed onions and sweet peppers, plain cream cheese, additional Italian seasoning, cut chicken in stripes) and it still turned out great!

SO EASY!  Perfect recipe to make with a little one running around.  It took maybe 10 minutes to prep and then just baked until dinner time!  SO EASY and delicious!

This pasta turned out great! I tweaked it to our liking...fat free creme cheese, cream of chicken soup instead of the condensed mushroom, penne pasta, and I added some fresh broccoli to the sauce as it was cooking. It's a great recipe that's easy to adapt.

Delicious!  I threw this in the crock pot as others suggested and cooked for about 5 hours.  I used 8oz of the cream cheese and 2 packets of Italian dressing mix.  The whole family enjoyed, even my husband who doesn't like anything but marinara sauce for Italian.  Will definitely make this again!

This dish was easy and company worthy! I missed the italian dressing mix for my store list so I added my own herbs that I had on hand. I doubled the soup , herbs and wine. We were glad for the extra sauce. I also sautted fresh mushrooms and onion for those who like them. Nice touch. This is a keeper! Thanks!

OMG! I have never written a review.  This was awesome.  I did not tweak except to double the sauce, because my family loves extra sauce.  I'm glad I did because they LOVED it.

This recipe was pretty easy to make.  I used 1C chicken broth after reading other reviews.  Also I used plain cream cheese.  I agree with some others that it was slightly salty and very rich.  However it was good, and I will make it again, next time using less seasoning and more noodles.

This was a restaurant quality meal that was so, so easy to prepare!    I followed the given recipe for the sauce very closely, the only difference was I used a pound of chicken tenders rather than breast halves.    Just FYI, I used Woodbridge chardonnay for the white wine.   I used half of the amount of pasta the recipe called for.    I absolutely could not believe how good this was and how easy it was to prepare.

Family LOVED it.  I expected it to need more spice, but it was pretty good as is.  I used both wine (1/2 cup) and chicken broth (1/2 cup).  Browned the chicken on the stove first with butter & S&P.  Added fresh mushrooms while chicken was browning.  Placed chicken in pan, then covered with heated soup mixture and cooked in oven for a few minutes.  Added extra pepper to the soup mix.  When done, added pasta & mixed.  Will try adding some broccoli next time.  A keeper!

Yum!!  In the interest of time, I browned the chicken in just 2 T. of butter.  Then I removed the chicken from the pan and added remaining ingredients, plus 1/2 C. of hot water (the sauce seemed too thick to me).  Returned  the chicken to the pan and simmered, covered, about 20 minutes while I cooked the pasta.  Will be making this again!

I think this dish has great potential, but it was way to rich for my tastes. I made it in the crock pot like other reviewers suggested, but I think next time I might use a little less cream cheese and butter and maybe add a little chicken broth to thin out the sauce.

I made this meal for my family/friends last night and we all thought it was really good but agreed that a better choice of pasta would be either cheese tortellini or mini cheese ravioli for this type of sauce.  I also doubled the sauce and cut the chicken in bite size pieces.    Verygood though I will make again with the tortellini or ravioli.

This meal was great! I changed it a little based on what I had on hand. Instead of wine, I used 1 can of chicken broth and instead of golden mushroom soup, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. This was absolutely excellent. I also seasoned my chicken breast with Lawry's season salt, Lawry's seasoned pepper, and Lawry's garlic powder! It added an excellent taste to the chicken, everything went perfect! Next time I am going to add grated parmesan cheese and parsley to top it off! Yummm!

This recipe was a huge hit, and I was totally surprised by it. I had family over for dinner, very picky eaters. I was nervous about making something new to feed them but decided to take a chance and I am glad I did. I used chicken tenders because that is what I had, I also used a whole 8 ounce brick of cream cheese and omitted the butter. This was a nice rich and complex meal. I am so glad I decided to take a chance on it.

More like 4 1/2 stars! This was a delicious dish!!! I pretty much followed the recipe, but doubled the sauce (but left the italian dressing mix at 1 and 1/4) and added about 1/2 cup of milk so it wasn't extremely thick. I sauteed some fresh baby portabella mushrooms and steamed some broccoli and it put it on top of the chicken in the backing dish. (The broccoli was a GREAT touch..)  I didn't have chive cream cheese, so I made my own. I heated my soups, wine, cream cheese and milk concoction and then added it to the 'shroom, broccoli, chicken mix.  I cooked everything at 350 for 45 minutes and it came out perfect!  It was a little soupy, but I'd rather have too much sauce then not enough!!  I served it over bowtie pasta.  Fiance LOVED it.. will be making again very soon!

I had to try this recipe because of the high rating, but I have to say, I was a little disappointed.  I made the dish according to the recipe, in addition to lightly seasoning the chicken with garlic.  for the amount of bake time and calories, I expected so much more than the flavor a boxed dinner.  I will try the leftovers and see if the flavors improve, then maybe revise my review.

I thought this was really good. It was a bit thick to serve over angel hair, but had great flavor. I subbed a few things, like regular cream cheese and used various spices/herbs instead of the dressing mix, but it turned out great. I also added some sauteed mushrooms and they were so good. Thanks!

Like many others here, I doubled the amount of sauce, but I kept the same amount of chicken and pasta.  I added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms, and a diced red bell pepper.    I also cooked mine in a saucepan on the stove.  I keep a carton of milk nearby, because as the sauce simmers, it gets really thick, so I add a splash of milk every few minutes to keep it thinned down.  (1/2-1 cup total maybe.)  That really helps with the saltiness.

I made this witht he full recipe for only 3 Chicken breast, which gave me more sauce for the pasta.  Very good, and a good basis for experimentation with added ingrediaents.

Doubled the sauce, but other than that made it just like it said.  Turned out great and everyone loved it. Will for sure make this again. Might try different noodles next time. Nobody really like the angel hair pasta, clumped together too much.

Yum, Yum, Yum is about all I can say!  I didn't have wine, so as others said, used a 10.75 oz can of chicken broth.  I only had plain cream cheese, so no chives.  I served it over bow tie pasta and all I could hear was yummmm!!!  DH said it was a bit rich, so maybe I'll use a little less cream cheese next time - for him, I thought it was perfect as is!!!  NOTE:  I did use the Golden Mushroom soup, I don't believe it would be as good using the regular mushroom soup.

A delicious, rich dish! Like some other reviewers, we omitted the white wine and used 1 cup of chicken broth and doubled the cream cheese (8oz). This dish looks and tastes like something you would find in a restaurant. We served it with a Caesar salad, garlic bread, and Chardonnay.

Wonderful.  The only thing is is that it is a little bland.  It could use a little salt. But other than that it is a great recipe.

Fantastic recipe. The only change I made was to use chicken tenderloins in place of the breasts. Otherwise this is a definite keeper! Thank you for this easy to make meal!

This is really good comfort food. I adapted this for a quick dinner and cooked the whole thing on the stove. I used three chicken breasts cut up in small pieces, but the same amount of everything else for the sauce. I also used a whole package of mushrooms that I sauteed first in a tablespoon of butter with half of a small onion. (This is all the butter I used.) Served over pasta... Really good.

I doubled the sauce, and used  rotisserie chicken from the deli to save time.  It was really good, but not the best I have had.  I also added roasted red peppers for some color and "zing".

Very simple and tasty.  I like to make up a little extra sauce because the pasta soaks it up.

Definately double the sauce.  Also season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Add garlic...yummy.  I will say that the color is bland bland bland.  For appeal I added sauteeed sliced portabella mushrooms and red pepper before serving.

I doubled all of the sauce ingredients except for the dressing packet. I also sauteed a small onion, 3 garlic cloves, and a small container of baby portabellos and added them to the sauce. Served over whole wheat pasta. This recipe reminded me of a tastier tuna noodle casserole. I liked it (didn't love it), but gave it 4 stars because my meat-and-potatoes boyfriend loved it. The leftovers were also better than the first day.

We LOVE this recipe! I wish I could give it more stars. It is so delicious. The secret is the italian dressing packet, I never even though of using that before, but I love it. I use chicken stock instead of wine and the recipe turns out fabulous every time. Thanks!

This was good but very rich.  I doubled the sauce using one can of golden mushroom soup and one can of cream of mushroom chicken soup.  To the sauce I added chives since my cream cheese was plain.  I placed the chicken on the bottom of the pan and topped with sliced mushrooms.  Then I poured the sauce over the top and baked.  When it was done, I served it over bow-tie pasta.  Also to speed up the melting time of the cream cheese, I warmed it slightly in my microwave on the melt butter setting.

Very good.  I was looking for a shrimp pasta recipe, but feel limited when I add the shrimp for looking, so I just put in pasta and found this one.  VERY good with shrimp too.  I just did the sauce on the stove and added the shrimp towards the end.  Use cream of mushroom because it was all we had and reg cream cheese with added chives (again, all we had).  Could use a tad more liquid (either in wine or broth form), but still VERY good.  Added some chopped tomatoes and some mozzarella cut up on top, a sprinkling of parmesan.

This recipe was great.. I like to try new recipes and my family loved this one. I made it with penne noodles and it was great. I would recomend that you double the sauce because the receipe doesn't make enough sauce, but other than that it was perfect!!!!

Very good & well received by my suspicious & picky family.  I used chicken broth instead of wine & cream of chicken instead of golden mushroom, plus added dried chives to plain cream cheese.  A different way to have chicken & pasta with a creamy sauce.

Excellent and easy! I used Marscapone Italian cream cheese in lieu of regular cream cheese and it came out very creamy (and seemed less salty). Also used fresh chives, fresh mushrooms and no butter. I did serve it over scortched & lightly buttered penne with the cashew/ginger asparagus recipe on this site. Great meal! Thanks for the recipe.

One of our favorites the only thing I add is a package of mushrooms that I saute before adding to the sauce.  Easy to make ahead & I add 15-20 min to cooking time coming out of the fridge.

I must have died and gone to heaven.... My husband found this recipe and made it for me on the weekend. Its a good thing he doubled the recipe because some of my teenagers friends showed up just in time for dinner. Everyone loved the dish. The chicken was moist and the sauce was heavenly. I now understand why it is called angel chicken pasta.

This was really yummy.  I used half white wine/ half chicken broth. I added some parsley and since I did not have golden mushroom soup I used cream of chicken, turned out wonderful.  I also added some mushrooms and some summer squash from my garden.

Absolutely awesome! We loved it. I used "thin cut" chicken breasts, so only cooked them in the oven for 30 minutes. I used fresh chives and regular cream cheese (instead of  the chive cream cheese), and I doubled the sauce recipe and used 2 casserole dishes so I could single layer the thin-cut breasts.   Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish surprised me. I admit that while preparing the sauce, I kept thinking that there was no way it would turn out right...I would go back and look at the recipe again and again to make sure I was following all the right steps. Because I didn't trust the way the sauce "looked", I only used half of it. The husband, kids, and a guest all gave compliments on the dish and over-all flavor. Next time, just for personal preference, I will use 4 packs of the .07 oz dry italian dressing mix, and add 1 tbsp vegetable oil to the sauce while cooking.

Had left over rotisserie chicken, so I made everything on the stove top.  Very quick and easy.  Done in 30 minutes!  Taste was really good.  Would make this again, with extra sauce!  I am editing my review and bumping it up to a 5 star, as I found myself making this 3 times since my original review above.  It's addicting!  For the ease of preparation, taste, and because I changed very little, this is one of my favorite recipes on this site!  Thank you Marian!

It was OK, found it to be salty.  Second time I made it turned out much better after several changes.  Use 1packet of Italian dressing, 8 oz cream cheese, 2cups chicken broth, 1 can of golden mushroom, 1 can crm of mushroom, couple of cans of mushrooms, cook chicken in a pan with olive oil and garlic.  Once sauce is done mix with chicken and noodles.  I would also add more chicken.  This way came out a lot better than the first.

I followed the advice of other reviewer's and doubled the sauce.  I also used the recommended 1/2 C wine and 1/2 C chicken broth, plus almost all of the 8oz chive cream cheese.  It was a hit.  I grilled the chicken to about 3/4 done on our indoor grill after seasoning and then sliced it and added it into the sauce on the stovetop where it simmered covered for the 10 or so minutes it took to cook the pasta.  Very good flavor and quite easy.  Will make again.

A bit rich, but VERY yummy! I made just a few additions by adding a can of diced tomatoes and a few shakes of Tabasco (just personal preference).  Calculated the recipe for a serving of 8, although I only made it with 6 breasts and cubed the chicken.  Wanted to be sure I had enough sauce based on some other reviews saying not enough. Covered for 1/2 the cooking time then uncovered for second 1/2. And used Penne Rigata pasta.  When I eat the leftovers, I may try it with brown rice...this seems like a dish you can eat with either.  Definitely a keeper!

This was good but not great.  We'll make it again because it was so simple to put together.  We added spinach to ours for a splash of color.

My kids, 3.5 & 5, couldn't get enough! We all loved it.  I did make a few changes.  Instead of 1/2 c. white wine I used 1/4 c white wine & 1/4 c. chicken broth.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic.  Terrific!

I was really looking foward to this recipe since it got soo many good reviews. It just didn't do much for us. It seemed like too much pasta and not enough sauce, and not enough spices. I might try again with less pasta, and no condensed soup..but who knows!

I read all the great reviews, and I thought I'd give this a try.  I ate a little bit, but my husband and son took one bite each and didn't like it at all.  It just had a funky taste to it.

My whole family LOVED this recipe!    I followed some of the other reviews by ommiting the white wine and using 10oz chicken broth instead.  I also used 1 can of the condensed golden mushroom soup as well as the equivlant of 1 can cream of chicken (I make my own cream of chicken soup).  I didn't have Angel hair pasta so I used linguini (sp?) instead.  The chicken I cubed (like the picture). Everything else I followed to a T.   I plan on making this dinner a LOT for my family!!!  It deserves the 5 stars in my house because I was able to easily adapt it to my family.

This was very good. I substituted chicken broth for the white wine. I cut the chicken breasts into pieces and cooked for 40 min in an 8x8" baking dish. The entire packet of italian dressing seasoning was a little much. The next time I make this I will double the recipe (except for the italian dressing).

Love this recipe! Chicken had great flavor. I did cut the chicken into cubes before putting in oven and instead of white wine added 1 can of chicken stock, and fresh mushrooms. Excellent!

SO AMAZING!!!  And so easy.  :-)  I made this last night for my husband and my parents.  It was great!  I was going to serve a salad with it, but I ran out of time, but then I remembered that I had a bag of fresh veggies that you would use in a stir fry!  So I mixed that in with it.  It was perfect!!  Just what it needed.  Thank you so much for sharing this!!

I was surprised how good this came out. I would suggest browning the chicken a little bit in a sautee pan before baking, but I like my chicken a little more well done. I added fresh broccoli and my husband and I really enjoyed it! Will definitely make again.

I have made this afew time and it always comes out fabulous.  I sometime replace the white wine with chicken broth just cuz I don't have any wine on hand, but it still turns out fine.  I have also added fresh mushrooms which just adds to the GREAT flavors in this dish!!

My friend made this recipe for dinner last night and I asked her what the recipe was and then searched and found it on allrecipes.  I thought this was delicious. My husband and daughter loved it as well.  Will definitely try at my house!

This tasted too artifically flavored if you ask me!  I have made and tasted much better pasta dishes.  This reminded me of something you would buy prepared from a grocery store.

I liked this dish better than my family did, but overall it was just OK. The sauce tasted pretty good, but cooking the chicken this way leaves it rather bland, both in taste as well as texture. Perhaps browning the chicken first, or not cooking it at all in the sauce, would improve this dish. Adding a steamed vegetable, like broccoli, at the end improves it as well.

Very delicious. Picky husband and picky kids loved it. I,too, doubled the sauce recipe, but kept the italian dressing at one envelope and used chicken broth instead of wine. PERFECTO!!

This chicken was amazing!  Few changes...used chicken broth instead of white wine, and doubled the butter, chicken broth, and mushroom soup, and kept the italian dressing mix the same.  When I first melted the butter, I sauteed fresh mushrooms and added minced garlic.  After that, I followed the directions exactly, although I cut the chicken into cubes.  But we thought this was the best recipe we've made from this website!  Definitely plan on making this many times to come.

So good!  My husband said this is one of the best meals ever.  I thought it was a little salty at first, but then realized I had put too much sauce on my portion, and the leftovers were just perfect.  We loved how tender the chicken was, and it was so easy to make.  I did substitute low sodium chicken broth for the wine, but that was it.  Thanks for such a great, easy recipe.  Next time I will try with the slow cooker!

Amazing Recipe! I usually cut up my chicken before I bake it. I double the sauce and use 1 can of plain cream of mushroom and 1 can of golden instead of 2 cans of golden. We can't get enough of it! Yum!

WOW! This chicken was soooo good! I could have ate the sauce like soup! Be careful to not make too many noodles, I thinned out alot of the flavor. Would have been great with mashed or baked potato to enjoy full flavor of the sauce.

I made this tonite with a few changes...cut up 2 lbs of  breast tenderloins and sauteed in olive oil, after seasoning with seasoned salt. Made the sauce separately with chicken broth instead of white wine, and cream of chicken soup instead of golden mushroom (this was all I had on hand). Added the sauce to the chicken and simmered for 30 mins, then put over bow tie pasta and added peas. I asked my husband for the rating and he gave it 4 stars....but my picky 4 year old loved it, and it is going into my box to keep. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

i had very high hopes for this recipe duue to 1,700 reviews and 4 and a half stars. I followed recepie exactly and i ended up throwing all the sauce out and making something else with the chicken. I have never tried golden mushroom soup. I tasted it before i added other ingredients and didnt like it, but thiught once i added everyting else i may like the flavor. That wasnt the case. Mabye i would prefer it with cream of mushroom soup. i wouldnt recommend this to any one who doesnt like golden mushroom soup or has never tried it.

I have to admit, when I saw the ingredients for this recipe I was very skeptical.  However, I took a chance because of the great reviews and I was pleasantly surprised!  This has to be the best chicken/pasta dish I have ever had. Definitely something you can make for company because it looks elegant and also tastes like something you would get at a nice restaurant. I have made this about a dozen times now, usually served with cubed new potatoes baked with a bit of Italian dressing from a bottle.  Try it, you'll like it!

My husband and son liked this recipe.  I was not crazy about it though.  I doubled the sauce recipe, but used only one pkg of italian dressing. I also substituted chicken broth for the wine, using an entire can, like one other reviewer suggested.

Great even with milk free substitutes. My husband and I loved this recipe. Now our two year old has a milk allergy so I used milk free margarine and tofutti cream cheese. It came out awesome. I did still double the sauce as others recommended. My children loved it.

This recipe was really great and easy to fix. My husband said it moved to #1 on his list and asked me to cook it next week too. Since it was only the two of us, I only used three chicken breasts but the same amount of sauce the recipe called for. We used all the sauce up just the two of us.

This sauce is very thick & rich. It tasted okay at first and then  became overpowering. I'm not the biggest cream cheese fan so maybe that was the problem, just too thick for me.

This was a great meal. We did tweak the recipe a little bit. We substituted water for the white wine and added 1/4 cup Spanish black olives to the sauce. Next time I think we will add fresh mushrooms. We didn't have any on hand otherwise would have tried that addition as well. We cut the chicken into thin strips, seasoned and cooked them in a skillet, then baked with the sauce for 30 minutes instead of the 60 given. This will be a recipe we continue to use for many years. It is so easy and we usually have all of the ingredients on hand, even in Asia! Gave it 4 stars because we have had dishes we prefer better, but this is still an excellent and filling meal!

Have also tried this with plain cream of mushroom soup and prefer that to the golden variety.

I decided to try this because of all the reviews and still a very high rating.  I made it for a Christmas party, and it was raved over.  Very, very good recipe.

I did not care for this recipe.  I think it was the dry Italian seasoning.  It had an awful twang to it.

This was very hearty and yummy. Kind of like a thick and creamy carbonara. The chicken was very moist after cooking for 35 minutes. And you definitely need to double the sauce.

Fantastic! Works well with neufchatel also. Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces for easier serving and faster cooking. Double the sauce, and add frozen broccoli.

Mediocre at best. My bf liked this (which is surprising because he doesn't care for cream cheese, cream soups or mushrooms), but he is willing to try anything at least once. I don't like mushrooms either, but can tolerate cream of mushroom soup (go figure!). Taking the advice of another reviewer, I looked for cream of chicken with herbs soup at my local supermarket, but they were all out (bummer!). I ended up subbing cream of chicken with mushroom soup instead. For the cream cheese, I purchased an 8 oz. tub of spreadable chive & onion cream cheese (which worked fine - I "scooped" out a quarter of it for the sauce since I made half the recipe). Thought this had a very distinctive winey taste (which I didn't care for) and my sauce was quite "watery" right out of the oven. Served over my grocer's generic brand creamy herb noodles with French-style green beans and garlic bread on the side. Certainly not "bad", but not WOW and definitely not worthy of making it on my regular menu rotation. Thanks for sharing though!

Great tasting recipe that I return to often. As others have recommended, I double the sauce. I also add green olives & serve on penne pasta.

Pretty good. I cooked 3 huge breast halves with the same amount of sauce and 1/2 lb of angel hair. I substituted a can of cream of asparagus soup, since the golden mushroom is made with beef stock, and it came out too salty! I didn't even use the entire can. I'm sure without the soup, it isn't that salty and my boyfriend really liked it, so 4 stars it is. I probably won't make again though.

Delicious recipe. I've made this without the wine. I substituted chicken broth instead and used cream of chicken soup because I hate mushrooms. I also made it with a flavored cream cheese (sour cream and chives, etc.)

The only thing I change is to only use a half stick of butter; and when I have them I add fresh mushrooms. Easily five stars for my family which includes two young kids. So easy and so yummy!!! Great to make for company - it's always a hit.

Many reviews suggested doubling the sauce--I didn't, but I only used 2 lg. chicken breast halves.  Per other reviews, I cut up the chicken in lg bite size pieces.  I through it all in the crock pot on low for 3 hours.  Great on penne pasta.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is EXCELLENT... my husband and children love it and ask for it all the time!  The sauce has such great flavor and the chicken is very tender.  I serve it over egg noodles most of the time.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone!

Similar to the sauce in recipe called Baked Pork Chops I..... only I liked that one better.  I thought this was going to be more cheesy, it was not good on pasta in my opinion.  I might make it again only serve it with mashed potatoes and eliminate the butter which does nothing but add calories and fat, and use milk to thin if needed.   This might be better with some onions in it or mushrooms.  It needs tweaking for sure.  Maybe double the cream cheese?  I'll experiment with it.

This was good it had a really great sauce that you could just have on pasta and it would taste great!

This is my favorite. I love it so much just the way it is - and it also works w/o wine if you don't have it around. Mmmmmm. Thank you for this one.

I made this for a small dinner party and everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe and it made a lot of food too!  The sauce was perfect!  The only substitution I did was use campanelli pasta which I think made it all the better!

I made this pretty much as written and although it was good, it to me wasn't worth 5 stars and I probably won't make it again. My DH didn't finish his so he must have not been impressed either.

Very, very tasty.  My whole family loved it. I will double the sauce recipe the next time.  It was a little on the salty side so maybe use low sodium soup if available.  And adding some veggies would really top it off. I will be making this one again and again.

This was excellent tasting & so easy to prepare. My husband loved it and claimed it was the best pasta he'd ever had. I've read a few reviews- and I have to say do NOT leave out the wine! It gives it such a rich kick! It's essential to the wow factor of this pasta dish. 

My only issue was that the chicken turned out overcooked the first time so I reduced the cooking time a little. This sauce tastes great with any pasta of your choice, we chose rigatoni! I also added green onions and mushrooms. Mmm thanks so much for a quick, delicious meal that will be served in our home for years to come!

Very good. Strained the mushrooms out of the soup, since we are not big fans of mushrooms... 

I've been cooking recipes from AllRecipe for years and this is arguably one of the best tasting meals you can make with such little effort.

Stellar! One of the best recipes I have found on this site so far.  I followed other reviewers advise and doubled the sauce without doubling the dressing mix, used chicken broth instead of wine, and because we don't care for breast of chicken I used thighs instead.  We absolutely loved it, and the leftovers were great as well. Definitely  a keeper.  I will make this again.

We'll make this one again! I love the smell and taste of wine in cooking...so flavorful! I didn't have cream cheese with chives so I used regular and it didn't seem to matter. I don't really think this recipe needs modifications, I thought it was quite good as is. I may try mushrooms next time just because I like them and it would work in this dish.

We took the cream cheese out since we are not a fan, and used chicken broth as recommended instead of the wine. Also added a pack of mushroom and was AMAZING! Don't be shy with the mushrooms, they taste wonderful!!

Just okay on this one.  I substituted white grape juice for the wine.  While this was good, it wasn't "WOW" and I don't think deserves anything better than a 3.

This pasta was awesome, I will make over and over again!  I used thin cut chicken breasts and it was ready in just 30 minutes!  My hubby mentioned if I added sauteed onions/peppers if would taste very similar to his favorite dish at Olive Garden.  I will also add a clove of garlic.  Very very good!!! *Note* Been making recipe a few times now...just sauteed some spinach with garlic and added to the mix....hummy!!!

Excellent. A few changes: I doubled the sauce with some tweaking... 1/2 C butter, 1 packet of italian seasoning, 1/2 C wine, 1/2 C broth, 2 cans golden mushroom sauce, 8oz container cream cheese w/chives. I cut the breasts in 1/2, and only cooked for about 35-40 minutes. Chicken came out moist and tender. It's a keeper.

This one is definately a keeper.  So easy to make too.  I did add baby portabella (pre cut) into the sauce just before baking.  They came out great and added a wonderful flavor to the meal.  My mother thought the taste of this was absolutely gourmet!

It was great, I changed it a little, I had already cooked the chicken the day before so I cut it into bite-sized pieces and put it in the sauce on the stove.  I just basically warmed the chicken in the sauce on the stove and then served the sauce-chicken mixture over buttered angel hair pasta.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe! I've modified a bit based on other members' reviews : Cut the chicken up and sauteed/browned it in the pan before putting them in the dish with the sauce; I also cut the baking time in half since the chicken was almost cooked; Added mushroom & broccoli in the last 10 mins but came out half-cooked.  Next time, I will: try with chicken stock instead of wine, cook the broccoli and mushroom half-way! Great recipe though... everyone loved it!

I really enjoyed this meal and would give it a four star, however the rest of my family give it a three star.  Made it just as recipe calls for, except sliced the breast in half and reduced the cooking time to 35 minutes in the oven.

I'm begrudgingly rating this one a 2 because my husband actually sort of liked this.  If you don't care for cream cheese, I would leave this one alone.  The chive flavor was overpowering, and the whole dish tasted like a block of cream cheese.  I dipped my finger in the sauce and from that one taste I decided to throw something else in the oven.  My husband, however, said that while it wasn't good, it wasn't horrible (he does like cream cheese).

I really really like this recipe, but i did think that it was time intensive. I will follow the advice of others by pan frying in small pieces next time so it will be faster. I also used mushrooms and doubled the sauce as others suggested. It looked like it was missing something, i would add peas for a spash of color next time. My daughter, who is 7, loved it!!! This is a keeper. Thanks.

All the glowing reviews about this recipe are true! It's delicious. I always double the sauce (using only one packet of seasoning though) so that we can use it on other things too. I've experimented using the white wine (sauvignon blanc) and chicken broth, they both taste really good but I kind of prefer the chicken broth. Either way it's really yummy and super easy!

Easy and yummy! I didn't even have golden mushroom soup and substituted cream of mushroom, and it was still good. The changes I'll make next time: the chicken was dry, so I'll start checking at 45 min instead of waiting the entire hour; and I'll add garlic to the sauce. Give this one a try.

I altered this a little, to use what I had on hand. I used regular cream of mushroom soup, and regular cream cheese with a litle "Onion Onion" seasoning by Tastefully Simple thrown in, everything else I followed for the sauce. I also used wheat spaghetti instead of angel hair pasta. It was SO yummy!! We really liked the way the flavor of the wheat pasta blended with the flavors in the sauce - perfectly creamy and great taste! I cut the chicken in the 9x13 pan and then tossed it all (with the pasta and sauce) before serving. Next time I will add mushrooms and probably some steamed broccoli.

I made this tonight for my husband because we wanted something new to try and we absolutely loved it.  I doubled the sauce, but I only used 1 1/2 packets of dressing mix and I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  Will make again.

Loved it! Doubled the sauce (though I still didn't used the whole seasoning packet) I used 1 can of the golden mushroom and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (because that's what I had). Also threw in some peas... yum :-D

This was absolutely delicious.  And completely foolproof.  My husband kept telling me how good it was....I told him he was overdoing it after the millionth compliment =) The only thing i will do next time is double the sauce.  I meant to this time, but forgot to buy an extra packet of italian dressing mix.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

YUM! For some reason my sauce was a little thick, I used 3 chicken breasts and there was enough sauce for the chicken, but found that it didn't coat all the noodles. I used penne noodles instead of angel hair pasta. I recommend doubling the sauce recipe, other than that the flavors were FANTASTIC! Thanks!

This recipe was good but not great. It was very easy and is great for a quick week day meal. My husband and I both thought it needed a bit more flavor or texture. Maybe next time I will try adding some fresh tomatoes, mushrooms and green onions. Thanks

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I guess I should have known from the ingredients, but it was way to rich and I just didn't care that much for the flavors.

Delicious.  I cooked this for my family and when they ask for seconds--that means it is really good.  However 4 stars because made as written, i thought it a bit salty.  I would agree to double the sauce or use only half of the dry dressing mix.  I only used a generous dollop of chive cream cheese and that was plenty.  AND, i used shrimp instead of chicken, added fresh mushrooms, and then spinach to the sauce pot 2-3 minute before serving--for my husband's personal taste preference. Incidentally, i didn't realize until i was ready to cook that it took 60 minutes in the oven; i just heated i through and served over the pasta.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe; the sauce seems very versatile !!

This looked like it would be a great recipe, but it was so bad I threw it out. It might have been the wine I used because it over powered the sauce. I also didn't use the cream cheese with chives. I just used plain cream cheese. And my chicken turned out really dry. To be fair, I'm going to make this again using chives and omitting the wine and using chicken broth instead. I'm convinced this is a great recipe. I'll be back to rereview it.

Wow!  This was SO easy and SO delicious.  Even my picky 5 yr old daughter loved it.  IMPORTANT - be sure you get the Campbells Golden Mushroom Condensed Soup - NOT cream of mushroom.  I think some of the 'bad' reviews saying it was bland must have used the wrong soup - there was NOTHING bland about this dish.  I made a small modification with the wine.  I only used a 1/4 cup of while wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Also, I used regular cream cheese and added my own dried chives.  Enjoy!   Its a a definite keeper.

This recipe was very good.  I sauteed the chicken with season salt in olive oil first.  Didn't have mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken and also substituted chicken broth for the wine.  Very tasty!!

We too love this recipe. We have made it many times! I originally chose it to make a special dinner for my husband, who in turn loved it. The only thing he was concerned with, once I told him the ingredients, was the cooking wine. So, we searched online, and i discovered alternatives to the wine. We chose to use sparkling white grape juice instead. Another option that we considered was gingerale. The sparkling white grape juice worked just as well as the white wine! There was a slightly different taste, but my husband loved the sparkling white grape juice more!  Also, another thing that we have tried... at times, we have only had regular cream of mushroom soup. We just add 2 beef bullion cubes to the mixture once we stir in the soup. This is an excellent recipe worth having and sharing over and over! Thanks so much!

My entire family loves this recipe.  I've made it several times, and it is in my "rotation".  I can't get over how easy and tasty it is.  Whenever I need to make a quick dinner, I know I can always make this and everyone will be happy.    I usually serve it over rice instead of the pasta and it is so good.

I really wanted to like this - and I thought it would be great with over 10000+ positive reviews - but, it was nothing special - edible, but tasted processed and "tinny" from the soup.  Sorry, I won't be making it again.

I really enjoyed this dish. My husband thought the wine was a little strong but other than that he found it OK.

4 as written. 5 with the following changes:

- doubled sauce (except italian seasoning packet)
- used chicken broth instead of wine
- added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder to sauce
- added 2 tablespoons of sugar to sauce
- used egg noodles (or rice) instead of angel hair
- add mushrooms to sauce when cooking
- add cooked broccoli to sauce at end

My boyfriend and I ate it all up.

I agree with the previuos review.. it was missing something. Not bad... smelled good, just was a bit bland. 
**UPDATE- I don't remember what I did the first time, but I tried this again and it came out great! I poached the chicken with salt and garlic, then shredded it. Added chopped fresh broccoli (I think I'll try spinach next time) and used chicken broth instead of wine. Served over bowtie pasta. Will def make again!

Yum, yum, yum!!! I made this for friends Saturday night and we all thought it was great. I doubled the sauce and was so glad I did. Thanks for a great new way to serve chicken.

This was my first recipe from allrecipes.com and I was not disappointed!! One of the best chicken dishes I have ever made. My husband loved it but asked that next time I double the sauce. I agree that this would be a good idea.

I made this chicken and pasta with a white wine called Souther White, made in NC, and I believe the sweetness of the wine made this recipe outstanding.  The next time I make it though, I will try a different type of pasta.  Angel hair is so tempremental.

This recipe is sooo yummy! I used lowfat cream cheese but otherwise kept it the same. Probably one of my favorite recipes on this site. I get random cravings for it all the time!

On accident, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of golden.  This wound up tasting excellent, even with the screw up.  I got rave reviews from everyone and many requests to make it again.

Used what i had on hand, substituted chicken~jalepeno sausage for chicken, and regular cream of mushroom soup (1/2 of the can)~added a teaspoon of cajun seasoning, and some sliced black olives. I used bowtie pasta instead.  To give it a little more of an italian flare,  I added one can of diced italian tomatoes, and it was fantastic :)>

This might be one of my overall favorite recipes on here, thanks to the ease and flavor. Definitely something I would serve to guests!  I did reduce the butter to 2 tbsp., and I used reduced fat garden vegetable cream cheese (that's what I had).  If serving 3, I think there is enough sauce, if serving more, I would double the sauce (but not the Italian seasoning packet, too salty).  Try it and I'll bet you'll love it as much as we did!

I made this in the crockpot - it smelled great and I will make it this way next time.  But this is what I will do differently:  Not cut up the chicken/use whole breasts, add some additional seasoning (garlic, parsley, etc) and use a different pasta.  I used fresh angelhair and it kind of turned to mush.  Next time I'd use dry rotini or bowtie pasta.  Also, I'd add fresh broccoli to the crockpot the last 10 or 15 minutes.

This recipe is a keeper.  Instead of chicken breasts I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and doubled the sauce.  I did end up having sauce left over but froze it and will just make a smaller portion of this meal next time.

I usually tone down the saltiness of the sauce with a little added chicken broth.  It also thins out the sauce which tends to be a little thick. Other than that I think it is a wonderful recipe.  Thank you.

Pantry was a bit bare today, but I found that I had most of the ingredients for this recipe.  Wanting to make this a bit more healthy I substitued with reduced fat cream cheese, 2/3 can 98% fat free Cream of Celery, only used 2 Tbls butter, used beer (Coors light) instead of wine (the Hubs hates the taste of white wine in sauces), and served over fiber enriched penne pasta.  I cut my three giant chicken breast into wide 2 inch stripes to decrease the cooking time.  
I must admit that I was skeptical, but the outcome was a very tasty dish. 

Next time (after I've gone shopping), I'll add some fresh mushrooms, maybe peas or brocolli.  AND I really think the addition of beer (however a cheap one) provided a nice ballance to tone down the tanginess of the sauce.  I imagine a white wine could contribute to a tangy sauce in a way that we may not like.

I made with only 3 very large breast halves. Served over flavored box with cheese Brocolli! Yum! Next I will try only 1/2 a pkg of salad mix. A bit salty.

OMG this was fabulous! Only changes I did were fresh mushrooms, added garlic and used chives and plain cream cheese, cause I didn't have the flavored. Excellent! Don't change a thing.

This was as easy as all the cooks stated--and as yummy. I did add some chicken broth to round out the sauce, as well as some asparagus tips and baby bella shrooms (because I had them), but it is great "as is". Even some picky-eater kids were on board. A definite staple. It reminds me of a New England best-kept secret called "Alpine Chicken".

Wonderful but precook chicken a little first, cuts baking time in half. I also added broccoli, onion, garlic powder cayanne pepper and some fresh basil. Definitely double the sauce.

Perfect recipe!  Simple to prepare, yet tastes like I've slaved all day!  This is not a recipe I make regulary, as it isn't too healthy.  I do try to make it a little healthier by using organic cream cheese(still not perfect), fresh chives from my kitchen herb garden and spelt angel hair. 
Great for special occassions, and company! Everyone always loves this recipe!  Thanks!

This was a really good meal.  I added mushrooms, green peppers, tomatoes, and onions to the sauce right before putting it in to the oven and it came out amazing!  The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little oily coming out of the oven.

This is the best.  I gave my sister the recipe and she also makes it all the time.  I do like to double the sauce and add a can of mushrooms.  But it is sooooo good.

This is fantastic. We make this often, it's really rich and certainly not low-fat, but it's great for company. It's super tasty, and really easy. Just be careful to plan properly, an hour in the oven is a long time to wait! Have some appetizers while waiting.

This dish is DELISH! I altered a little and here is what I did. I pan seared the chicken breast with salt and pepper until browned slightly and put in slow-cooker. I did the sauce with low sodium cream of chicken soup and the rest as directed. I added the mixture to the slow-cooker and let it simmer all day. I removed the chicken to set aside and put mixture in a saucepan and added some whipping cream and a little sherry to make it real "saucy" and then added it to chicken on top of whole wheat angel hair and WOW! Thanks for a great recipe!

From the mouth of my ultra picky 13 year old "Oh my mom!  This is amazing!"  That just about says it all.  I did use Cream of Celery soup instead of Cream of Mushroom because the kids wouldn't eat mushrooms.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a t and it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

A wonderful dinner party dish.  Most work can be done ahead of time so you can enjoy yourself with guests. I served with a baguette and really nice asparagus with sea salt. Delicious meal.

This was awesome.  My husband finished his plate and told me it was a keeper which means I will be making it again.  I think it would have also been good over white rice, but the pasta was good with it. LOVED IT...!

This was great!!! I doubled the sauce like others suggested and also threw in some mushrooms. Didn't have any good wine, so I used chicken broth instead. The family loved it. Will make again and again.

My husband and I liked this recipe and I will add it to my recipe box.  I doubled the sauce because a lot of reviewers said to do this and I like a lot of sauce, but I had enough left over to feed an army.  Instead of wine I used reduced sodium, fat free chicken broth.  I used one can chicken soup, and one can mushroom, as well and chive and onion cream cheese.  I didn't think it was too salty, but it's probably not that easy on your waste line. Next time I'm going to try it with fat free or reduced fat cream cheese and maybe add fresh chives, mushrooms, garlic, and onions, for a fresher taste. It tasted great with broccoli and rolls though.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I doubled the sauce (I did use 2 packs of italian dressing mix, unlike some other reviewers).  Then, I mixed the sauce with some fetuccini and some chicken bits. It was delicious!!!  **Note:  The first time I made this I did not double the sauce.  It was the perfect amount for 2 people - no leftovers.

This was to DIE for!  It was so amazing.  I only added one can of mushroom soup because that's all I had and added 1.5 cups of chicken broth instead of wine.  I also added fresh mushrooms and served with noodles. My husband LOVED it and he's picky.  Thank you so much!

it was OK. I followed other suggestions and increased the sauce.  I did make it in the slow cooker- which i guess might have made a difference.  I just didn't really like the flavor. Also was a little to salty for my liking.

This gets 5 stars for ease and the number of people in my group that enjoy it and 4.5 for taste. It really is simple to put together. Dress it up with some garlic sauteed asparagus and you have an "adult" meal. Serve it with a side of peas and the kids will eat it up. Can't go wrong with this one! Also easy to modify with reduced fat ingredients with little to no change in flavor. Have fun playing with this one!

Delicious ! I brought this to a pasta/wine party and it was a hit.
I used regular cream cheese and fresh chives, and garnished with sauteed broccolini with garlic. This pasta is a creamed colored dish so the fresh chives and broccolini really dressed it up !

I have prepared this dish for 2 people, 70 people and numbers in between. It is a wonderful dish to make for a crowd and then I usually serve it with rice instead of pasta. It always gets rave reviews and I am frequently asked for the recipe. I make the sauce ahead of time and follow the recipe as it is stated except I use plain cream cheese.

My family loved this recipe!  Make sure that you double the sauce.  I usually keep the noodles separate and the meat mixture separate....this way the noodles don't suck up all of the sauce.  My friends at work also tried it and their families love it!

I made this recipe several times and it's definitely one of my favorites on this site. It's quite easy to prepare! 
You can change the soup to cream of chicken, brocoli, celery, etc. 
Wine can be substituted with chicken broth.
I usually use margarine instead of butter, 1 package of Italian salad dressing, 1 cup of white wine, 2 cans of soup and 1 package of onion and chives cream cheese. Depending on the texture I want, I add chicken broth. 
I often prepare the sauce and put it on top of the chicken in a crock pot, on low for 5-6 hours. Turns out great every time! If you leave it longer, the chicken falls apart, which is great served over pasta.

This is a family favorite.  I use four chicken breasts and double the rest of the ingredients.  To shorten the cooking time, I filet the chicken breasts.  And for a change, I've used potato and onion pierogies instead of angel hair pasta.

We did not like this much. It had a strange flavor to it. I don't know if it was the dressing mix or too much wine. We are not wine drinkers so maybe that's what it a strange tangy taste.

Great recipe.  Can be a little "stong" on the flavor side, if you like it like that then its fabulous...but for people who like a bland diet, try something else.  I make this at least once a month for my clan though!

This is one of the better chicken recipes I've tried in a while.  The lower heat/long cook time makes the chicken moist and tender-- soft enough to cut with a fork. Definitely a keeper!

Easy, great homestyle flavor. I couldn't find the golden mushroom soup, so I used a roasted garlic & mushroom variety. Loved it. A great weeknight dinner. Pretty affordable, too, which is a bonus.

WOW!  Absolutely delicious! I didn't have golden mushroom soup and used cream of mushroom and used the full 8oz of chive and onion cream cheese. Served with angel hair pasta and sauce was perfect, not too thick.  My family loved it and I will try this in the crockpot next time!

I followed the directions exactly and as suggested doubled the sauce.  We were not impressed.  The white wine was too over powering and it was too salty.  I won't be making this again.

Really good but really salty!  I cut down on the salt by adding more cream cheese and thinning the sauce with low sodium chicken broth (I like thinner sauce with angel hair anyway).

My daughter is a vegetarian, so I baked some of the sauce over some tofu slices.  (Her sauce was thinned with water, not broth, I couldn't tell the difference.)

Great with broccoli on the side!

We loved this... kids too!  I think the sauce could be used for many different dishes.  In fact next time I make it I'm going make extra sauce to freeze and have on hand to throw on chicken/pasta/veggies for a quick meal.  This was very easy to make.

GREAT DINNER - This is similar to the "Chicken Jerusalem" recipe on this site..I wanted to double the recipe and had only one can of cream of golden mush soup, so for my second can, I used a cream of asparagus.  It's definately worth it to double because it tastes even better the next night over some steamed rice!  This is a keeper!

I liked this, but after reading all these rave reviews, I was a little disappointed.  I guess I was expecting something a little more spectacular considering someone wrote it was the best recipe on this site...my husband enjoyed it though.  You definitely need to double the sauce, so that was a helpful tip.  I added broccoli which I would highly reccommend to give it some crunch.  I'll probably make it again, but its not the best on this site by any means.

My husband and I really liked this dish. I cubed the chicken, sauteed it, then added to the sauce for about 15 minutes. The kids weren't so crazy about it- oh well.

This is my favorite recipe I found on this site. Not only is it a great meal to serve to guest's it makes for incredible left-over's. You definitely have to double the sauce for the noodles. This meal is not for people that do not enjoy cream sauces. Everyone else should definitely give it a shot!

I loved this recipe as did my very, very picky husband.  I doubled the sauce as others recommended.  I did not have wine or the packaged dry salad dressing mix so I used chicken stock and Mrs Dash seasoning instead.  I also added three small cloves of garlic, chopped of course.  I cut the chicken into large chunks and cooked it all in the crockpot.  Came out wonderful.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is so rich that I wouldn't want to make it regularly.

This dish was alright for me.  I made it for a dinner party of 12 and it went over quite well.  However, I would suggest that unless you truly like the taste of wine you either don't make this dish OR don't add extra.  Also, I followed the suggestion of making extra sauce for the noodles....that is a must!

This recipe was WONDERFUL! Even my picky boyfriend loved the sauce! The chicked came out super tender and juicy. I only changed one thing...I used low-sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom. Absolutely wonderful dish!

This was good, but not as good as I expected it to be. Other reviews had me really excited about this dish. If you love cream cheese with chives then you will love this. To me that is all I could taste. My daughter really liked it and requests it often.

So good!  I actually substituted grilled pork chops instead of chicken since I was in a hurry and my picky kids ate it up.  I did have to add a little milk to the sauce to make it less thick.

My whole family loves this recipe! The only thing I do differently is double the sauce ingredients & serve with rice since my kids like rice better than noodles.  Wonderfully easy & tastes great.

This wasn't awful but it wsn't as great as I thought it would be based on the other reviews. My husband & I actually thought it was pretty bland. I probably will not make this again. Sorry.

My boyfriend loved this, so he gave it 4 stars. I thought it was way too salty (and I love salt). Next time I will only add 1/2 the packet of seasoning.

I made an account just to rave about THIS recipe! It was wonderful - I did double the sauce, italian dressing included, and added some chopped tomatoes. The chicken turned out perfectly moist. Everyone LOVED it, including all 4 kids present (ages 7, 6, 4, 2). My husband said "this is the best thing you've made in a long time"!

Pretty good.  It has a nice flavor.  It is certainly a do-over at our house, but I don't think we liked it as much as others on this site.

I thought this was very good, as did my husband. I used chicken broth instead of wine since I'm nursing and don't have any wine in the house. Turned out great. Very rich, a little goes a long way!

This recipe was good except the chicken ended up way over-cooked.  The sauce, however, was delicious.  I'm sure you can get away with cooking the chicken about 40 minutes or so and be fine...

Um, something was a little off. Maybe next time I will not use as much wine and or Italian dressing mix. Just add as I do along. Also I used whole wheat pasta and fat free cream cheese to make it a little lighter. I did have to thin the sauce out w/ a bit of whole milk it was a bit gloppy otherwise. I also poached the chicken breasts before assembling in the casserole. It cut the cooking time in half

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. The only changes I made was that I used low sodium chicken broth instead of wine and chive and onion cream cheese since I could not locate the chive cream cheese. I will make this dish again.

This recipe just doesn't work for our family.  When we made it as is, it was much too salty.  When I cut back on the dressing mix, it wasn't very flavourful.  It has a nice flavour when made according to the recipe, but far too salty for our palates.

Used 1/2 the amount of chicken, otherwise made as written.  Excellent.  A tad salty.  I recommend not adding salt to your pasta water.  Will definitely make again.

This was really good. I was kinda soso about this recipe, but it turned out really good. I only used 3 really big chicken breast and I cut them into pieces. I like a lot of sauce so I only used half of the noodles. Next time will add mushrooms. This is a keeper!!

This pasta was very tasty and very easy to make.  Based on some previous reviews, I didn't want to double the sauce so I just used less chicken and pasta to make it more saucy.  However, that made the meal way too salty for our taste.  Next time I will try it with the correct amount of pasta or use less italian seasoning.

This recipe was awesome, except it was way too salty! I added raw cubed potatoes to it, and that worked out well. Next time I will only use half of the dressing. Other than that it was wonderful! Great recipe!

It turned out pretty good, not enough sauce to really coat the pasta so it ended up clumping together. very good though other than that. VERY filling.

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  I seasoned the chicken before adding the sauce.  I used a small sprinkle of kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and a pinch of freshly ground pepper.  It is very tasty and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS - Restaurant quality flavor.  I used regular cream cheese and cream of chicken soup because that is what I had and it was still fantastic.  Cant wait to have this again.

Exactly as everyone said earlier - a delicious dish.  Served it for company and got rave reviews.  Seconds were requested by a few - one even had seconds on just the past and sauce.  One thing though - I goofed and left the dry Italian dressing in my grocery cart - I panicked when I realized and quickly replaced it with dry Onion Soup Mix packet.  Was a little worried about the salt factor but it turned out PERFECT - so another option if you don't have the dressing on hand.  Will definitely make again.

This dish turned out really well.  My honey especially liked it and said to add it to the permanant file.  I did make a couple of minor changes. I used light chive onion cream cheese, light margarine, and just plain cream of mushroom soup because that is what I had.  I also added some leftover fresh mushrooms I had and served with a sald.  It turns out really creamy and I had plently of sauce for 4 chicken breast with 3/4 pound of pasta.  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome recipe!!! I cooked and diced my chicken first, made this with chicken broth instead of the wine, (didn't have any)doubled everything for the sauce, used fettucini instead, and it was TASTY! Thanks for the excellent recipe. It looks great, too.

This was just okay, it tasted a little bland once everything was mixed together. I guess I should have used more of the sauce.

EXCELLENT!!  I made this for a dinner party and lighted it up a bit for my health consious friend.  I doubled the sauce and used 7 chicken breasts.  I used low fat, low sodium cream of mushroom soup, Smart Beat spread (instead of butter), whipped chive cream cheese, and left out the wine since I didn't have any.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  It was phenominal lite...can't imagine the full version...definately a keeper!!

I made this and was bummed when I realized I forgot to add the cream cheese!  I followed the recipe exactly, though I only used 4 breasts.  Even though I forgot the cc, it turned out excellent!  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!
Also, it was extremely fast and EASY to make!  Can't ask for more than that...easy and YUMMY!  YAY!

YUM!  This was also a little less heavy with a side of broccoli which was a nice balance of flavors.  We also used whole grain pasta and it was great.

I don't have much experience in cooking, which may have affected the result, but the chicken came out somewhat plain.  I think I should sliced the chicken breasts.  The sauce with angel hair pasta came out great though.  It tastes fine and was easy to make, but it was probably the least liked at my dinner party.

I'm a student so basically i depend on my mom's cooking, but i tried cooking and this was my first dish. It turned out great and very very yummmy! It was fairly simple. The only thing I would have added was fresh cut mushrooms. Everything else was great. Simple and Delicious, all in one package :]

Made this for the first time tonight - my boyfriend and I both thought it was delicious - "add it to the rotation!" was my boyfriend's quote.  My only modifications - I didn't use the entire Italian dressing seasoning packet.  Next time, I'll try with penne pasta - I did think the sauce was a little too rich for angel hair.

Excellent recipe! Such a unique combination of flavors, but it works. This has become my husband's favorite chicken dishes. I serve it over rice, rather than pasta and I also add a can of sliced mushrooms (drained) to the sauce before pouring over the chicken.

This was well enjoyed at my home! I doubled (approx) the wine, and added my own seasonings as well (garlic and rosemary on this first batch), and it was devoured. (I also used cream of M, cause it had it on hand.) Usually in our house, the pup gets to enjoy leftover chicken dishes (they don't reheat real well in the micro) but I tried to give him the last breast of this dish, and was not allowed! I'll def be making again.

I sauteed the chicken, then made the sauce and spooned it over the chicken and pasta. It was extremely salty. I don't know if I used too much condensed soup, or if the seasoning packet was extra salty, but I had to add a lot of water to make it edible. I will try it again, but baking it in the oven. Perhaps that will help.

I love this meal.  I make it for friends when they are sick or extremely busy.  Everyone loves it.  It is very adaptable to the crock pot as well.  Just leave out the pasta.  You can also substitute cream of mushroom.

I love the rich, velvety sauce that comes out of this recipe.  I *always* double the soup and wine to make more -- I like enough to pour over the pasta.  I also usually skip the dry seasoning mix and toss in some of my own favorite herbs.  This is a regular in our rotation.

I made this last night after reading all the reviews. I found that using a really good white wine (I used a Reisling) made all the difference. I'm going to try this with pork chops next.

This is one of my favorite dishes!  It's so easy to make and turns out great every time!  I usually serve it over fettucine and I have added fresh mushrooms, but it's great without them too.  You can also prepare this and put it in the crock pot.  Smells so good when it's cooking too!

This was yummy, but rich.  I doubled the sauce... not totally necessary, but nice for leftovers.  I also used fat free chicken broth in place of the wine.  I couldn't find golden mushroom soup anywhere so I just used normal cream of mushroom.  I really liked it with the angel hair pasta.  Also, I cut up the chicken into pieces after it was done in the oven.

Made this tonight for dinner - very good!  I used chicken tenders and bow tie pasta because that is what I had on hand but followed all other ingredients/directions to the letter.  Very good flavor!  My husband didn't particularly care for the wine flavor but I thought it was great.  Mabye next time I'll try using chicken broth instead of wine and see how it turns out.  I will be making this again.

AMAZING!!! The bad part is that we've moved to the middle east and cant' find the soup...any suggestions? Tried regualr mushroom soup and doesn't taste nearly as good.
EDIT: Thank you DawnJ for the suggestion about altering mushroom soup to taste like the golden one. I'm going to try it this week.

I thought this was just ok.  Maybe it was too salty from the canned soups....I'm not sure why I didn't love this.  It was easy, but I probably won't make it again.

This receipe was very good.  I recommend not preparing so much pasta.  I had 3/4 of what was cooked left over and not enough sauce for seconds.

The golden mushroom soup makes all the difference!  This is wonderful served over angel hair pasta, egg noodles, or even rice.  A great meal for a weeknight or for a special occasion.

The entire family thought this was fantastic - including a picky 5 year old.  I doubled the sauce as I tossed the pasta with it, and there was not enough with the amount called for in the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  The only thing I did different was use chicken broth in place of wine and I used regular cream cheese.  Even my picky 11 year old son cleaned his entire plate and my husband has requested I make this once a week.  Thank you for this recipe!!

This was yummy!  I didn't change a thing and my family enjoyed it.  I think for next time I will try a few mods, mostly trying to lighten it up a bit.  Healthy Choice soup, lighter cream cheese.  And I might try cutting up my chicken into strips or chunks.  But a keeper and I will make again!

This was outstanding. I was a little skeptical of the ingrediants and how they would blend, but it was a keeper! This will become a weeknight regular, thanks!

I'm rating this a three because it was just not that good. I didn't care for the Angel hair pasta. I think I should have tried Fettucini. I doubled the sauce I used half wine and half chicken broth. I added fresh mushrooms and I mixed it like spaghetti. I'll try it again because the sauce was okay.

Very tasty but I am one of the ones who thought it was way too salty.  Will make it again because it was well liked but will double the sauce part while leaving the Italian salad dressing mix at 1 pkg.  Cutting the chicken breasts into cubes sounds like a good idea so will try that next time.

This dish was wayyy too salty for my taste.  Probably would have been fine otherwise, but I won't make this again.  Sorry.

A great place to start!  I followed the directions to the "T" and found that it was lacking so I doctored it up...fresh mushrooms, fresh broccoli, roasted red pepper, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic.  It turned out great except the extra "doctoring" dried out the chicken a bit.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

My family loved this recipe. I used low fat cream cheese and low sodium cream of mushroom soup, and my only problem with this recipe was it does seem a bit salty even with all the low sodium changes I made to it. I will definitely make it again, and it was still excellent reheated up to 2 days later.

I cubed the chicken breastand used the whole 8 oz pkg of cream cheese because I thought the 1/2 cup wine would over power the dish. I also added a little bit of milk. I served over wide egg noodles. My husband and daughter ate 2 helpings. I will make this again. Very easy, quick dish.

This is a really great dish - my family loves it.  I cut up the chicken into chunks and saute them and add it to the sauce.  I also substitute the white whine for 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Also, if you can't find golden mushroom soup, regular ol' cream of mushroom tastes great, too.  Very tasty.

Very easy! Family loved it. I did add about 1/4 cup of 2% milk and some cracked black pepper after it was cooked and served cooked spinach on the side. Also I used olive oil to the noodle while cooking.  Thanks for recipe.

After reading several pages of reviews, I kind of winged it and mine turned out great!  I cut up the chicken and slightly browned it in a little bit of olive oil and soy sauce for flavor. In the saucepan, I used almost a full stick of butter, 1 pkg Good Seasons Italian drsg mix, 1.5 cans of golden mushroom soup, 1/2 cup white cooking wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and about 6-7 oz of cream cheese with chives and onions (all I could find). I added a little bit of milk  because it did taste a bit salty to me before the milk.  I just kept stirring it all together on med. heat until it was smooth.  I poured it over the chicken in 9 x13 baking dish and cooked about 45 minutes.  My husband and I loved it on the angel hair pasta!!  Great flavor, not too salty.  I will definately make this again!!!

This was good, but not as great as the raves I read.  I cubed and floured the chicken and browned it in some olive oil, before putting it in the crockpot and pouring the sauce over it for three hours on low.  The chicken was moist and I did enjoy the flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I used cooking wine as I do not keep other types of alcohol in my home.  I also have to double the sauce recipe as I never have enough sauce.  I guess my family really likes the sauce.

Add me to the growing list of fans of this recipe!  Loved the flavor, it was very rich, yet the dish was simple to prepare.  I doubled the sauce and was glad that I did.  Next time I think I'll add mushrooms.  I added frozen, chopped broccoli but I'm not sure how well that went with the flavor, might try carrots next time.  Yum, yum, yum!  Thank you!!!

I made this last night and it was sooo good!  I changed it up a little bit by cutting up the chicken and browning it in a little olive oil - it cut the cooking time down.  Also I doubled the sauce and served it over rice instead on pasta since my husband is not much of a fan of pasta - I will make it again!!

Yummy. My picky 4 year old loved it. Did not add cream cheese 2nd time I made it to cut out on some fat and tasted delicious. Add more wine for a little more of a marsala taste.

Excellent!  I did make a few changes:  cut up chicken breasts and browned in olive oil, omitted salad dressing mix and used Italian seasoning instead, used regular cream cheese and substituted chicken broth for the white wine.  I also sauteed some onions, peppers and mushrooms to add to the sauce.  I then mixed all the ingredients for the sauce together in a bowl (I softened the cream cheese in the microwave) and put everything together in the crockpot and cooked on low about 6 hours.  I used rigatoni instead of angel hair.  Delicious.  I recommend using the soup called for in the recipe - completely different than cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks.

I made this exactly as suggested, and boy was it delicious!  Even my picky 2-year-old loved it.  This is definitely a keeper at our house.  It is super easy to make.  I disagree with the reviewers that said angel hair pasta isn't substantial enough to go with the sauce - we loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this last night because I wanted something quick to put together and I liked all the ingredients and because of the great reviews.  But I have to give it a 3 because it was just OK.  I had plenty of sauce, maybe because I baked it in a smaller dish.  I think I'll have mashed potatoes with the leftovers because it was more like a gravy than a cream sauce for pasta.

this was a very good recipe. The sauce was sooo easy to prepare. Next time I would cook and cube the chicken and add to the sauce in the pan. Took a little while to cook the chicken in the oven.

Somehow my Italian dressing packet disappeared, so I used some Italian seasoning and low-fat Italian dressing I had on hand.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese.  I substituted chicken broth for the wine.  All in all, it was an excellent dish.

I've been making a dish similar to this for years, though the one I made used regualr cream of mushroom rather than the golden mushroom.  Gave this a try and liked it so much better.  I used regualr cream cheese and added fresh chives from the garden.  Love the sauce tossed with whole wheat penne.  Yum.

this was a great meal. my husband and i are both vegan so we used butter, cream cheese, and chicken substitutes and it tasted amazing. the sauce was really creamy and thick, which is hard for us to find sauces like that that we can eat. a really good recipe, we will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good.  I'm a beginner cook, and added a whole stick of butter which is double the amount it's supposed to have (OOPS!!) so I ended up having to put in more wine, a can of cream of mushroom soup in addition to the golden mushroom soup, and 8 oz. of the cream cheese with chives.  So essentially I doubled the sauce, which was needed.  I couldn't imagine making this dish without doubling the amount of sauce.  I used linguine noodles.  I sauteed the chicken that I cut up in pieces (in a frying pan on stovetop) in olive oil to brown them.  I added chopped fresh garlic to the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients for the sauce.  Overall this turned out pretty tasty even with my goof with too much butter (I spooned most of it out when it settled on the top.)  I don't know if I'll ever be a great cook but this website really helps me out.  Thanks for the recipe Marian!

Very nice, fast, kids loved it! Doubled the cream cheese, added a bit of cream and onion soup mix (maybe 1/4 packet), and 1/2 cup chicken broth, enough to feed all 6 of us. Also used heavier pasta, the sauce held up well.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  After reading through the reviews and then trying the recipe myself, I have to say that I couldn't imagine this recipe would be nearly as good if you didn't use the white wine.  The wine pretty much makes the dish and gives it an excellent and very distinct flavor.

This was great.  I went to three stores and could not find cream cheese w/chives.  They use to sell it, so don't know what is going on.  I bought green onions diced up the greens and mixed with the cream cheese.  I use wine if on hand if not extra broth.  If your sauce is to thin in a bowl mix a litte water and corn starch.  Whisk together then add to pan.  It will thicken it up. We don't like angel haired pasta so we use linguine or whatever.  It's a personal preference.  Thanks for the post.  This is great.

Well I hate to go against the grain on this one but I found that this was just ok.  I didn't like that the sauce was so runny.  To be fair, I did use a can of chicken broth instead of the half a cup of wine it called for so it was a bit more liquid but I was hoping for a thicker sauce.  I also think that the chicken should've been cut up into the sauce.  I did try this the next day as leftovers and I actually enjoyed it a lot more the second time around.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I only found 'whipped' cream cheese with chives. Not knowing how if might affect the consistency, I simply bought cream cheese with chives and onion. I also used unsalted butter since many reviews commented on the salty taste. Definitely a keeper!!!

Points for ease and kudos from my family, I enjoyed the taste but nearly drank a gallon of water that night to counter the salt, too much for me.

I made this last night for dinner - HUGE hit!  My husband gave it an A++.  I used noodles, instead of angel hair pasta, though - just a personal preference.  The noodles grabbed onto the delicious sauce really well.

I wouldn't serve this to company, although I'd make it for my toddlers again, substituting a pasta kids can eat with less mess. It is a VERY basic, rather bland, chicken with soup-sauce recipe. Easy & comforting, but certainly not a 5 star recipe (which I'd save for special recipes that are unique and, well, really great!).

This was very good!  I didn't change much of the recipe--I just used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese...that's it!  Good flavor--even the kids liked it (I was actually worried that the kids would not care for the "wine" flavor, which I thought was pretty strong.  Maybe I'll try a different wine next time!).  Next time I might cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  Thanks for a winner!

This is a great recipe.  Easy and delicious. I did add red bell peppers and fresh mushrooms, I think the water cooked off of the vegetables cut back on the saltiness I read about in other reviews.

Sorry, I agree w/other reviewers - too heavy and gloppy consistency. I had to cut the italian seas. mix down to half and add twice the amount of cream cheese to tone it down a little.

This is the best recipe I have tried from Allrecipes, so far.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.  It's not just that it is very tasty, but it is one of simplest dinners I have ever made.  This is important with a new baby to take care of.  The only change I made was, I used chicken tenders instead of breasts, because I prefer smaller pieces of chicken.  My husband is not a huge fan of chicken, but went on and on about this.  You must try this recipe!!!!  I am going to make it all the time now!

This was pretty good. I'm not wild about creamy pasta dishes but I did like this one. I only had fettuccine noodles on hand,  next time I'll try it with the angel hair pasta.

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for 2 yrs and I'm finally getting around to preparing it.  What was I waiting for? I also used regular cream cheese and fresh chives.  My husband really enjoyed this dish!

This was good but not wonderful. I didn't add all the soup mix for fear it would be too salty.  It just needed something I can't put my finger on...

A wonderful dish to make for company.  The flavors really meld together for this delicious pasta meal.  Will make this regularly for my family.  Beware...don't overcook the chicken especially if you cut it into strips before baking.

This is my all-time favorite recipe! Its so easy to make, has such a delicious and rich flavor. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. It pretty much prepares and cooks itself! My boyfriend and I both LOVE IT! He even had me prepare it for his mom and his sister who were visiting for Thanksgiving.

This recipe was interesting, and a fun change from my usual cooking. My husband (and parents) loved it, and would like it again....  but I probably won't make it again, simply because there were too many ingredients I don't keep on hand (cream cheese with chives, dressing mix, white wine, etc). I also try to avoid so many processed ingredients.

Super Easy Recipe!  And my kids really liked it.  The sauce was a little thick as I heated it up, so I added a little water (perhaps 1/2 soup can full) to thin it out.  A definite repeat!

This recipe was very good. Next time i will use a little less wine, or try a different kind because it tasted a little bitter. Other than that it was great!

I was a little nervous while cooking this because all I could smell was the wine, but it really turned out to be fabulous!  My husband hates mushrooms, but he loved this recipe.  Will make again and will serve to company.  Thanks for a great recipe.

After all the great reviews, I thought that this one would be a winner.  Not for us.  My family didn't come back for seconds.  I followed the recipe to a "T"  Just wasn't for us!  Sorry!

This recipe didn't thrill me much. Reminded me of the way I make my swiss chicken except with noodles. I didn't taste the seasoning dressing package much at all and the cream cheese had a hard time dissolving into the sauce. I added fresh mushrooms to this dish along with parsley on the top to finish it off. I am not sure if I will make this again or not.

This was pretty good, but a little too rich for my liking.  My husband liked it better than me.  Many reviews raved over the sauce which was good, but again, a little to rich for me.  Overall it was very easy to make and was good, don't know if I will make it again, though.

This is definately an all time favorite.  Everyone I've ever made it for loves it.  The sauce is very rich and you only need a little to go a long way.  I use white cooking wine.

This was just okay. The chicken did turn out moist, but the sauce just wasn't that flavorfull. I mixed the sauce with the pasta and by the end of dinner is was quite sticky. I will probably try it again with a different pasta and more flavoring.

This was delicious and so easy to make.  A few changes: used 1/2 pkge of the Italian dressing, 2 cans of chicken broth instead of white white, and 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  This gave me enough for my chicken and to pour of steamed white rice!  Didn't serve the paste....steamed brocoli instead.

This is very similar to a recipe my mom made. I think this recipe is even a little better. Very good, I will make this a again. Easy to make, and a very warm and comforting meal. The angel hair pasta is perfect becuase it soaks up the sauce. I'm sure this would be a great recipe with boneless skinless chicken thighs too. I followed the recipe exactly.

My husband said this was a 5 star meal. I too enjoyed it.  I cut the Italian dressing in half like previous suggestions, doubled the sauce, and used cooking wine but cut that in half too.  Was extremely easy to make.  Thank you

This was a HUGE hit at our house.  The flavors were so strong and intense.  Next time I will not use as much pasta and I would like to double the amount of sauce poured over the chicken.  
Delicious!

We loved this recipe just as listed!  And, I have a very picky family.  My husband, 5yo and 1yo ate it and loved it.  I like the suggestion of adding mushrooms and cutting back on the butter and using low sodium soup.

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe

Delicious!  I made this last night, sauteed sliced mushrooms and added a 1/2 cup of frozen peas. Because of the warnings of it being too salty, I used no salt butter, reduced sodium soup and no salt in the water for the fettucini.  It came out perfect not too saltly.  If you use cooking wine, as I did keep in mind it has added salt.

this was ok.i doubled the sauce.i liked it with the chicken but not with the pasta.the taste just wasnt for me.i might try 1 can of the soup and more cream cheese and wine.i think it was the condensed soup taste that killed it for me.i used fresh mushrooms too.there are better dishes out there.boyfriend liked it but he will eat just about anything i make for him.

I was not terribly impressed with this recipe. From the other reviews out there, I expected this dish to be heavenly. It was good, and I gave it 4 stars, mainly because it was VERY easy and it made the house smell great while cooking. I would definitely cut down on the Italian dressing mix- I used about 2 tablespoons and that was more than enough. Also, there was not enough sauce, so if I make it again will have to double the sauce.

This recipe has real potential! Boyfriend found the unchanged recipe sauce too thick, I found it too salty. I made the sauce as is, then poured 3/4ths of it over the chicken baking in the oven (which doesn't dry out if you only cook it for 30 minutes or so at 400 degrees). I thinned out the remaining sauce with half a soup can of water and about 1/4th cup milk, and tossed that with the pasta before adding the chicken. After trying fettucine pasta, I tried making this with bow-tie pasta; I think the sauce sticks to bow-tie better. It gets better as leftovers.:) Next time, in addition to adding roasted red peppers and maybe artichokes, I'll try the trick recommended by an earlier reviewer of cubing a raw potato into the sauce while it's simmering to soak up the salt. I guess you just spoon the potato out after it cooks in the sauce. What an intriguing idea! Thanks for the recipe, Marian!

I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce part. Too salty with two packets of Italian dressing, may try with one next time, also may be good served over rice too!! Otherwise, loved the receipe as did my husband who doesn't like to try many new dishes.

This recipe really lived up to the ratings, but I wish the sauce recipe was doubled in the original recipe because the pasta really soaks it up.  I tossed my pasta and sauce together.  And the taste is so good and not overwhelming, so it would have been nice to have extra sauce.  Next time I will definitley double it.  It's so easy and good that it's a real keeper in my dinner rotation!

Great recipe! I doubled the chicken, butterflied and browned it with some seasoning, used about 1 1/2 cups wine and a 14 oz can of low-sodium chicken broth, then left the rest of the recipe as-is. It was perfect that way, with plenty of sauce for the pasta.

Very easy dish, but it tastses complicated! Be sure to spoon some of the sauce over the noodles first, before laying the breast on top. I have served this twice so far, and each time it is gobbled up!

I made this for a family gathering and it was well received.  I tried a few bites and thought it tasted very good, but this is not a recipe for people who need to limit sodium.(Reviewers who doubled the amount of sauce, doubled the sodium content, as well).

I can't stop making this dish!  The sauce is such a tasty alternative to a tomato sauce.  There's really no tweaking necessary for the ingredients, but I'm playing with the quantities.  Tonight I'm doubling the sauce because last time I tried tossing it with the pasta instead of serving it on top (to keep the pasta moister for the leftovers) and a lot of the flavor was lost.  I also tried cutting the chicken into cubes to facilitate the tossing, but I don't think I'll do that again.  I'm going to have some of the leftover sauce with rice for lunch!

I know this recipe has gotten a ton of 5 ratings, but I don't know if I'd make it again.  It deserves 10 stars for how easy it is, and everyone ate it and no one complained, but nothing that special for me.  Maybe it would help if the chicken was seared before putting in baking dish.  For a recipe that is really easy and doesn't mess up a ton of dishes in the kitchen, this is great, but from a taste standpoint, it is just okay in my opinion.

This dish surprised me! It sounded like an ordinary chicken dish, but when you put all the ingredients together, the taste was very good! I used wheat pasta instead of regular pasta. I wish I doubled the recipe for leftovers! Excellent!

Excellent recipe - my family begged me to make this again!  It was so simple, and tasted (and smelled) extremely elegant!!!  The wine and the chive cream cheese added that special something - I am impressed, and this recipe is a keeper (Note:  it's good enough for company, too)!!!!

I'm glad I tried this recipe and overall, I did like it, but I felt like something was missing. Artichoke hearts and/or fresh mushrooms might be a good addition.  It's one to experiment with.

I thought this must be a good recipe because of all the great reviews, but what a wierd combonation of ingredients.  So I tried it...pretty good.  Kids really liked it, but hubby and I thought it could use something to "kick it up a notch."

I was nervous to try this since there were so many mixed reviews. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it turned out great! Thanks for an easy and yummy dish!

This is a wonderful and simple dish.  I altered a few things out of neccessity.  I didn't have white wine so I used broth and I sauteed the chicken with some garlic, onion, and basil because it was too hot to turn on the oven.
Personally I thought it was a bit too salty but my fiance loved it that way.  Next time I will try it with low-sodium broth, soup and unsalted butter.

Very good, but also very rich. I could only eat a small portion. I was not able to find golden mushroom soup, so I used cream of mushroom instead. I will make again with the correct soup, but this is a great meal. Very easy!

I saw this recipe months ago but wasn't sure it was something we'd like. Golden mushroom soup, Italian seasonings and white wine didn't really sound like a good combination to me.  But when I came across it again and saw how many good reviews it had, I decided to give it a try.  I'm so happy I did!  Not only is the dish delicious, it's also very easy.  I love that you just pour the sauce over the chicken and pop it in the oven.  The sauce is amazing and the chicken was so tender.  I did follow other suggestions and doubled the sauce so that we could keep eating it with noodles once the chicken is gone.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I'll be passing this one along to friends!

Excellent!!  Entire family loves this.  My daughters favorite meal.  The only changes I make are to double the sauce, use broth instead of wine and regular cream cheese no chives. Love it!!  Thanks Marian!!

The best! I've had this recipe in my box forever and hadn't yet tried it. I was kicking myself for not trying it sooner! My only complaint is that beacuse the sauce was so tasty, there was not enough of it!

This is such an amazing recipe! I wonder how Marian came up with it, I would never think of adding these ingredients together. This is also great on fettuccini, and just as good with regular cream cheese and less butter if you are trying to be healthy. I have made this at least ten times. It's perfect with some nice asparagus or broccoli on the side, perfection! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made a lot of changes so I don't know if I should review, but i will. I used cream of chicken and celery, all I had. I also doubled the sauce and had to use regular cream cheese. Very good though, will make again with correct ingredients.

I read all the raves about this and tried it. I was expecting something great, and all I found was something quite normal and bland. I'm sure this is fine for family dining, but for guests, I wouldn't really recommend this.

I've been making this recipe for years. . .even before it had 922 reviews!  I always double the sauce since it is very tasty.  I love fresh mushrooms in it as well.  A snap to make but tastes like you've gone to chef school!

Wow!! This dish is way too good, my family loved it. I did alter the recipe a little after listening to other reviewers. I added double the sour cream and double the mushroom soup, also added some mushroom. I kept the wine instead of using chicken broth as others have suggested and actually added in a bit more wine just because my family loves wine in food. But yeah I'm definately making this again, DELICIOUS!

It's okay, but I don't think I'll make it again.  Just wasn't too crazy about the sauce.  Pretty salty and definitely tasted like it was made from a seasoning packet.

Soooo tasty -- reminds me of chicken marsala a bit (which I love).  Fairly easy to whip together, & the result is right up there with an Olive Garden meal.  We had one guest with us when I served it, & he couldn't stop raving about "the sauce, oh my goodness, that SAUCE."

I wouldn't change a thing, except doubling or tripling the sauce; it's absolutely delicious and goes too fast!  This is perfect as is (except I couldn't find cream cheese with chives, so I just used plain cream cheese and added some onions).

Also, this works very well as a crock pot recipe.

Easy, elegant and delicious.  Who could ask for more?  It is a bit salty, but that can be cut down by the amount of sauce one puts on their pasta.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this dish numerous times, everyone loves it. I made it with shrimp instead of chicken and cooked for 30-35 minutes instead of an hour and this was excellent also. A perfect side dish with this is broccoli or asparagus. Thank you for posting this recipe I will always use this.

Very easy and delicious! Mine came out a little salty, but that was probably due to the brand of dressing mix and white wine I used. I baked the chicken @ 350 for 20 minutes. Chicken comes out moist and tender while cutting down cook time.

EXCELLENT!!!My entire family loves this recipe and always wants me too make it for almost every occasion. Two good side dishes for this is fresh broccolli or fresh asparagus. I have also used shrimp instead of chicken if you do this cook it for less amount of time. I will continue to use this recipe. Thanks

I didn't read the reviews as I normally do before making this and I should have, I figured with over 800 reviews and 5 stars I was safe. Totally agree it was WAY too salty and "packaged" tasting. If I made it again, I would use unsalted butter and less of the seasoning packet. I also would add some more mushrooms. I also used cheap chardonnay (we are beer drinkers so it was all I had) and cream cheese with chives and onions, so I don't know if those made a difference. My hubby liked it and said he'd eat the rest for lunch tomorrow 'cause I certainly didn't want it. I probably won't make it again.

Hmmm..salt, salt, and some more salt. The taste was pretty good overall, but next time I will do it on the stovetop and maybe add half the Italian dressing seasoning. It needs milk. I also added fresh mushrooms which was nice.

I gave this four stars because my roommate raved about it and he doesn't even like salty food.  I agreed with many reviewers it was very salty and the sauce was far too thick and gummy, but the flavor was great.  Is it possible that the submitter left out the step of adding the can of water with the soup?  I saw that some reviewers claimed the sauce was runny--I don't see how that's possible without having added the additional can of water.  I will definitely try the recipe again with maybe 1/2 a can of water or some low sodium chicken broth.  Definitely deserves a second try!!!

I really, really wanted to love this recipe, but unfortunately did not.  It was edible, but as other reviewers said too salty and processed tasting. I did reduce the Italian packet to per suggestion. However, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because my picky guy LOVED it, ate two heaping plates of it, and raved about it.  He puts salt on EVERYTHING, so I wasn't surprised that he liked it.  It really depends on your taste buds, I think.  You will either love this recipe and want it for every meal or not like it very much at all.

I was not impressed at all by this recipe. As others previoulsy stated, it tasted like a packaged meal. It was gummy and a waste of a nice glass of vino.

This recipe is very generic and tastes like it is a prepackaged out of a box type of meal. Maybe because all the inredients are... I was not impressed, and will never make it again. My husband was not a fan either.

We did not like this recipe at all, felt it was very bland and the sauce was runny.  The only thing I changed was used chicken broth in place of the wine.  We had quite a bit of leftovers as no one ate much, so when I re-warm it I will add some onions and other spices to try and kick it up a bit.

This is so easy to make, but it tastes like you went to alot of trouble!  My kids loved it and now its one of our regular meals. I used a low fat creme cheese the 2nd time I made it and no one could tell. I highly recommend this.

If you like salt, you'll love this recipe.  It had a lot of flavor, but was way to salty for us.  My son who is addicted to salt and vinegar potato chips, couldn't even eat this. I did double the sauce and only added one packet of the salad dressing mix and it was still too salty. I almost made it for company but decided to try it first, glad I did. I must say the chicken was very tender and moist and the basic recipe has potential. I may try again with 1/2 dressing packet, plain cream cheese, unsalted butter and fresh chives.

This chicken was awesome.  The sauce is so yummy I had to fight myself not to eat it up before I poured it on the chicken!  I used tenders instead of breasts because its easier for my kiddos and it only took about 30 minutes.  My husband took the leftovers to work and his coworkers ate it all before he could get to it!  This is so easy its hard to believe it came out so tasty.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will be using this one over and over.

I really did not like this recipe and was disappointed since it had such rave reviews.  I thought it was too salty and processed.  I even made it a second time with some of my own variations, but was still terribly disappointed.  Definitely will not attempt to make again.

For some reason....this just didnt click for us.  It was good, but not great.  Maybe its me, and I did something wrong, but it was to salty and....I dunno....I guess boring comes to mind.  DH didnt like it.  I'm just dissapointed after all the great reviews, maybe if it was not built up so much, I would have been more impressed.

The hubby loved this one.  I only used 4 chicken breasts instead of the 6 and chopped them up after they were cooked.  I also used regular cream of mushroom soup because that is what I had.  The flavor was great!

I love to cook, but I usually end up preparing children's meals to please my 9 and 3 year old.  WELL I prepared this and everyone LOVED IT!! My husband and I felt like we were having an ADULT meal for a change.  Also, it was so easy to prepare.

OK.  I really hate giving this recipe only 4 stars, but I was a little disappointed.  I've had this in my recipe box for weeks and have been so excited to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference was that I used light cream cheese w/chives.  I tasted the sauce before I put it in the oven and was really nervous because the flavor was very strong.  The flavor lighted up after cooking along with the sauce thinning, but it was still very salty.  I only cooked for 40 min and the butter was beginning to separate.  Next time I won't use all of the Italian packet.  I think that's what made it so salty.  I may also try chicken broth instead of wine as others suggested and less butter.  I also think fettucini noodles would work well with such a thick sauce.  The flavor was great, just too salty for me.  Too many changes to make to give 5 stars.

Update:  I changed this to 5 stars, after using chicken broth instead of wine and store brand Italian dressing, this is perfect.  I think my previous combination of wine and name brand seasoning were just too salty.  I love this dish!  If you don't like it the first time, you made need to try a different seasoning packet.

Absolutely delicious!  Prepared as directed but added sliced fresh mushrooms, however, the dish would have been just as good without them.  Great flavors, especially with the Angel Hair Pasta.

Made this for Valentines Day.  So easy and very rich.  Only minor change was adding fresh mushrooms and fresh chives.  I used reduced fat CC and lowfat butter.  Still came out very rich and creamy.  Served over thin spaghetti.  I made 4 chicken breasts and the full sauce amount (6 servings) and had a ton of leftover sauce.  Would have been fine reducing the sauce proportions, as well.

This dish is wonderful!!  It has a complex flavor...as if you've worked really hard to create it.  I did add fresh sliced portabella mushrooms on top of the chicken and then poured the sauce on top of it all.  WOW

Outsanding chicken recipe.  The chicken is moist and the rich sauce adds to its flavor.  Very easy to make.

This is truly my family's favorite. I don't share this recipe with many people because I want to cook it for them and receive all the credit. (although I do end up giving it to them.)  Truly the best chicken recipe--even my 'chicken nugget' eater likes it!

I made this for a women's group I hosted.  I followed the recipe exactly (just doubled it) and it was such a hit!!  Very easy to make too.  Many people asked me for the recipe.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but the sauce was so good, especially over pasta!

Very good.  I made a lighter version.  First, I doubled the sauce.  I used "I Can't believe its not butter light", low fat cream cheese, fresh scallions and half chicken broth, half wine.  It came out very good.  Be sure to use golden mushroom - not cream of mushroom.  Its very filling too!

Hey girl you rock! This recipe was excellent, thanks so much for sharing.
I used Marsala wine instead of white wine for an added zing. Turned out great....

This was great.  Quick to prepare, and I used rice instead of the pasta.  Would have liked a little more zing, but will definitely make this dish again.

This dish is fabulous - one time it turned out great, another time the butter separated during baking.  May prepare the chicken separately and just keep the sauce to serve on top.  Love the flavor, though.  Would definitely prepare for company!

(edit - made this a couple nights ago.  I sauted the chicken first, then made the sauce and just added the chicken back in to heat.  Cut the salad dressing packet in half as others suggested.  It was fabulous!!!)

Great flavor and easy to make. The sauce seemed a little too thin though. I used the low-fat cream cheese in the recipe to reduce the calories. Maybe that's why the sauce was too thin.

A great chicken recipe!  The sauce is wonderful!  I will use this sauce in other recipes because it is so good!  Definitely a keeper.  I made only 3 chicken breasts but still used the whole sauce recipe since we like to smother our chicken.  I would probably make more sauce than called for if making all 7 chicken breasts.  Thanks for a great new recipe!

I made this chicken for my husband and he really liked it. I cut the chicken breast into smaller pieces.  He really enjoyed the mushroom flavor (make sure to use Golden Mushroom soup and NOT cream of mushroom.)It is a very easy recipe to make.

I made this once befor and wasnt paying attention and used a ranch packet instead of the italian and it still turned out good. I sometimes replace chicken broth for the wine because the taste is really strong in this recipe. My five year old says this is his Favorite! If I can get everyone in this house to like a recipe it deserves five stars.

I love this receipe!!! I have made it many times and I found that using 1/2 the package of dressing dosen't make it as salty and I also add pepper and use fresh chives. This is one of my family's favorites.

This was the first recipe I made out of my new cookbook, tried and true favorites. The flavor was wonderful, and I am not a big mushroom fan (and neither is my husband who raved about it). I didn't have cream cheese with chives on hand, but the ordinary cream cheese worked just fine. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I modified this recipe by first seasoning 4 chicken breasts, cutting them into chunks and then browning them.  I also sauteed some chopped red onions and sliced muchrooms.  I put the chicken and veggies into the crockpot and added all the sauce ingredients plus a can of chicken broth.  I cooked it on low for about 6 hours and then served it over pasta.  I must not have mixed the sauce ingredients well because it was very clumpy looking and unappetizing.  It improved once I whisked it for awhile before I served it.  I thought it was just okay, nothing special.  It tasted processed to me.  My husband, four year old and two year old all thought it was fabulous.  They practically licked their plates. I just couldn't bring myself to give it 5 stars, although they certainly would have.

Strangely enough, my family really enjoyed this but I found it lacking in taste. I would definately double the sauce with all but the Italian dressing. I doubt that I'll make it again unless they request it (POSSIBLE!)

We've also tried this with shrimp and scallops and it's even better!  My husband says it beats Aussie Chicken hands down!

Yum, Yum & Yum again...I also doubled the sauce, only using 1 packet of the salad dressing. I didn't brown the chicken first but did season well before putting it in the pan. My kids went nuts over this one!!! Thanx SO much for a fab chicken recipe!!!

This was really good. The only problem I had with it was that the sauce over the chicken was a bit too salty for my liking. Over the noodles it was fine. Strange, isn't it? I think next time I will either cut the dressing mix down a bit, or use low sodium mushroom soup to see if it will make a difference, but other than that, it was pretty tasty!

We just finished having this for dinner.  It is a delicious dish and very easy to prepare.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used water instead of wine. I didn't add two packets of the Italian seasoning, just one, because I know it is salty.   I think I will add some broccoli to it next time.

This recipe is amazing!  It's not too hard to make.  Just make the sauce, pop everything in the oven, and forget about it.  Everything comes out great.  It tastes like it should be served at a nice Italian restaurant.

Almost the easiest and best recipe to prepare.  I double the sauce exactly as the recipe goes.  put most of the sauce over the chicken, then to keep the pasta from being dry (leftovers) I toss the angel hair pasta with the remainder of the sauce.  Perfect every time.  LOVE this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!  So does my husband and his friends.

Very easy! Used low fat cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 the dry italian dressing and 1/4 cup of wine with 1/4 c of chicken broth, also low-fat cream cheese and half the butter. Everyone raved!

This really is too salty if you use the whole package of dry italian-style salad dressing mix, but if you just sprinkle a little to taste, it is really a great recipe.  This is one of my husband's favorites, and he is very picky.

Very good.  I did thin out the sauce with extra broth before pouring it over the chicken to bake.  But, don't make it too thin, because the baking process does thin it out some on its own.

Delicious!  This is one of the best recipes I have made from Allrecipes.  I made it with chicken but next time I will try shrimp (maybe even fish).  I suggest doubling the sauce - I only made 12 oz pasta and there was just enough sauce so the pasta wasn't sticky.  My family also gave RAVE reviews.

I definitely don't think this is an all-star recipe.  It's good for something different every now and then, but it's not a "gotta have it" recipe by any means.  The one recommendation I would make is that the cooking time is way too long.  It does not take an hour to cook chicken breasts... they come out tough.  I'd recommend cutting this time in half.

My family really liked this recipe.  It will be a new favorite chicken recipe.  My daughter doesn't even like mushrooms and she raved about it.  I didn't do anything different to the recipe (other than doubling all the sauce ingredients).  It was perfect!  Thanks so much Marion for the recipe and thanks to all who sent in reviews.  I rely on the reviews to pick my recipes.  EXCELLENT  Eloise

I found this recipe to just be so-so.  I'm not sure really why everyone seemed to love it so much.   I guess I was expecting a cream sauce and this really wasn't one.  Something was missing, and the family didn't like it.  Probably won't make again anytime soon.

My husband loved this sauce.  I am going to try it with shrimp next time.  I sauted the chicken, like someone suggested but will not next time.  The popping grease made a huge mess and the lovely brown color dissappeared after baking anyway.  I strongly recommend doubling the sauce.  I doubled everything but the butter and the salad dressing mix. I believe you must use the golden mushroom soup mix and season your chicken.  The sauce was delicious.  Even better the second day.  I also added heavy cream to mellow wine flavor.  My father in law does not drink wine but next time I will leave it alone.

We just enjoyed this delicious dish for Sunday dinner.  It was wonderful!  Took the advice of a previous poster and made it in the crockpot (4-5 hours on low).  First, I sauteed the chicken in half the butter, then added with all the remaining ingredients to the crockpot.  Also added a can of chicken broth (we like lots of sauce) and a packet of chicken gravy mix (the broth made it too watery... the gravy mix addition resulted in the perfect consistency).  My husband of 11 years said this was his new favorite meal!  Served with Roquefort Pear Salad (from this website) and it was the perfect meal.  Thanks, Marian, for this great recipe!  Will make again and again!

Excellent dish! I did saute my chicken in olive oil first though and I doubled the ingredients for the sauce except for the dressing mix. I  used one can of golden mushroom soup and one can of reg. cream of mushroom. The golden mushroom definately added the color it needed or else it would look quite plain and not very yummy to eat. YUM YUM! My family loved it...

This was great!!!  Be sure to double the sauce, it goes quick it's so yummy!  I browned the chicken in a frying pan, then added a splash of wine to loosen all the tasty bits, then made the sauce in that pan.  I will make this for my family again!

Our family loved this recipe.  The sauce was incredible and you could cut the chicken with a fork.  I did double the sauce portion, but I don't think it was necessary.  We had a ton of sauce left.  I also browned the chicken breasts first with some leftover bacon grease and added garlic.  This one's a keeper!

Superb! I see why this one deserves top honors. The flavor is wonderful.. I used cream of chicken soup instead of golden mushroom, although I might try the mushroom soup next time after reading the other reviews. I will also double the sauce because it is sooo good! I could easily see this becoming part of our dinner rotation. Thank you Marian!

I did not have the right wine and it still was sooo good. I think it needs more sauce though as mine was pretty dry. Loved it! Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was great and very easy to make. Next time I will saute the ckicken before placing it in the oven. It think this will give the dish a better look and add more flavor to the chicken. Will be making this recipe again. Thanx Marian

I don't know whether we did something wrong when making it - all the other reviews are so good - we thought this was terrible!  Instead of cooking the breasts whole, we cut them into bite sized pieces, and all we could taste was the Italian seasoning.  Perhaps it was the brand that was used (Clubhouse) - who knows, but we definitely will not make again.  The only reason this recipe did not get one star is because the chicken did turn out very moist.

This was SO good!  I usually have a really hard time getting juicy chicken breasts out of a recipe, but you could cut these with your fork and the taste was TDF! (to die for)

Definately would make it again. My kids and husband devoured it.  I used thin cut chicken breast.  Doing it this way, it served less people - about 3-4 servings, but gave us more sauce which came out perfect.  I prepped it the night before by doing everything up until putting the chicken dish in the oven.  I left it in the fridge and put it in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes (remember I used the thin cut) and cooked the pasta the next day.  Doing it this way, it was easy to throw together after I got home from work.

I didnt think I liked it the night I made it but the left overs were fantastic which is why I gave it 4 stars. I guess sitting overnight gave the flavors time to meld so I had a great lunch! Thanks!

Awesome - loved by all!  Do take heed of everyone's suggestion and double the sauce recipe.  Serve with a medium-dry Chardonnay and a lighter vegetable side dish.  The sauce is very rich, so you wouldn't want to serve this with anything else heavy.

I finally made this recipe tonight.  It is very good.  I made the recipe as listed and thought the sauce was too thick.  I added 1/2 c of milk and it was fine.  I thought there was enough sauce for the pasta and chicken.  When I tasted the sauce alone I thought it would be too much, but once on the pasta and chicken it was perfect.  You must use golden mushroom soup.  It has beef stock and tomato paste in it.  I just don't see how using regular cream of mushroom soup would work.  Also,  I don't like mushrooms but I like this.

OH MY!!! This was one of the best recipes I've tried. I usually don't like white pasta sauce but this one had just the right amount of flavor. To top that off my husband loved it and request that I make it again next week. I did make some modifications: I use cream of chicken mushroom soup and I doubled the recipe for additional sauce. I also added parmesan cheese to the baked sauce the last 20 minutes of baking. Also I seasoned my chicken and seared it in a little bit of olive oil on top of the stove. The sauce is sort of salty but I did not add any salt to my noodles as I boiled them. Next time I may add a little cream to cut the salt.  I also used linguine noodles instead of the noodles the recipe called for. Great!

Wonderful recipe! I made a lot of changes; doubled the cream cheese, used chicken broth, two chicken breasts and shredded them after cooking time, 1/2 pound penne pasta.  Perfect amount of food for our family of four with leftovers.

Yes, this really is as good as everyone says. So good, so easy and you can really play with the recipe and come up with all kinds of good variations. I once substituted shrimp for the chicken and it was great too.

Wow!!!  This was good.....I didn't have white wine but I had sherry on hand so I used that instead it turned out well.  The only thing I added was 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  I will make this again and try it with white wine.

Just made this recipe for a family dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  We doubled the sauce as suggested by others but didn't up the amount of italian dressing mix and we also substituted chicken broth for the extra wine.  The sauce came out very flavorful and was just wonderful.  However, my husband and others were less impressed with the chicken which just needs something extra.  We will probably grill the chicken next time and then serve the sauce and pasta over it.  All in all a wonderfully different recipe and we will definately make it again.

I liked this, but it was a little salty. My boyfriend thought it was a strange mix of flavors, but enjoyed it anyway. Next time I will add a little milk or cream to it to mellow it out.

This was awesome!!! At first the ingredients scared me, but to my suprise, it was wonderful. The only thing I would change is to make double the sauce or make sure you toss the pasta after you pour it on top.

It amazes me how people put recipes down on this site after stating how they have changed it or obviously screwed it up. Follow the recipe, people! Pay attention to the details.

This dish is very good. I rarely give 5 stars, so take no offense to that. This is a very good, easy to prepare meal. My husband & nephew both loved it. I will make it again. A lot.

Changes? I made only 2 minor ones, one by choice. Those being I doubled the sauce, and in doing so I realized I only had 1 packet of italian dressing. So I only used one. It didn't matter. It was still excellent. Great tasting comfort food.

Thanks Marian. This one is a keeper.

I only gave this recipe three stars since it seemed to be somewhat lacking.  After reading the reviews, I think I was looking for something a little more flavorful.  My boyfriend claimed that it was good, but tasted like "chicken and macaroni and cheese".  My son, who is somewhat of a finicky eater, refused to finish his portion.

I used fresh mushrooms as some of the other reviewers suggested but kept the original recipe exactly as it detailed.  The color, texture and flavor of this dish wasn't particularly to my liking though.

This is a great "date" dish!  Every time I've made it, the guys just rave about it!  (One guy even asked to take home the leftovers!)  I like to add some sauteed red onions and mushrooms, but otherwise wouldn't change  thing!  THANKS MARIAN!!!

Wonderful. I served these to a group of 9, and received many more compliments than I felt comfortable accepting! It looks like it's more work than it actually is. Delicious.

I thought it was tasty, but my husband (who does not like cream sauces) asked me not to make it again.

my hubby loved it! I changed it a bit. I boiled my chicken on the stove and then cut it into strips. I added some fresh mushroons and finely diced onion. I also prepared 1 lb of penne pasta and then mixed it all and baked it for 20 minutes. it was awesome.

FAB-U-LOUS!!!!!!!  THIS IS THE BEST CHICKEN RECIPE I HAVE TRIED SO FAR.  I DID NOT HAVE 6 BREAST HALVES, SO I ADDED A LARGE CAN OF SLICED MUSHROOMS.  THE SAUCE IS SO LUSCIOUS, I DIDN'T MISS THE EXTRA CHICKEN.  TOPPED IT WITH PARMESAN, AND LIKE MY HUBBY SAID - "THIS IS A RESTAURANT QUALITY DISH."  THANKS SO MUCH!

I substituted chicken tenders for breasts and chicken broth for white wine.  Everything cooked up nicely in 30 minutes.  Will make again.

i'm so sad to have become a dissenter among all these rave reviews! i must say that my husband liked it much much more than i did (he'd give it 5 stars)...but i'd have to agree wiht one reviewer who said it was too rich and with anohter who said the color isn't very appetizing. husband kept saying it tasted like shrimp neuburg and i have no idea what that is (i wasn't brought up on american food), so i'll look it up after this post. regardless, it is a good dish, and i could see myself makign it for guests cuz i think it's an 'all american' dish, just not to my liking. we had it with penne pasta and i think it went well with it. oh! i forgot to say that this dish was SUPERSALTY!!! i guess i'll use unsalted butter next time i make it. i must also admit that the wine in the dish smelled glorious!

I thought this dish had strange flavor...not sure if I liked it or hated it.  The color was not appealing and I didn't think the flavors combined well either.  Don't think I'll try again.

It's awesome.  I would use about 1/2 - 3/4 of the italian dressing mix, but other than, that it was excellent.  We even use rice in place of the pasta.

Wonderful recipe! Easy, wonderful again...a tip? do not use the canned soup, use real mushroom, it will top an already fine recipe.

I made this dish for 6 of my friends and it was just enough. I would definatly double the sauce, at least for purposes of left overs. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom, it rocked!  My friend Steven, who never finishs his meal, ate every bite and went for seconds! I will most definatly make this again! You should try it!

This has become a staple at our house, although I double the amount of sauce.  It is my boyfriend's favorite.  He doesn't even mind picking out the extra mushrooms I like to add.

I hate to be the dissenting vote, but the dry Italian-style dressing mix made it so salty my throat hurt,and the combination of flavours simply did not appeal to anyone in my family. Will not make again.

Pretty good! The sauce came out a little too thick, but the flavor was good... But how could it not be considering the ingredients? Butter, cream cheese, golden mushroom soup... good stuff.

Definately double the recipe.  Make sure to make sauce slow so you don't reduce it.  To say it is awesome is an understatement.  Had enough leftovers for the next meal.  Reviews stated that it might need salt, I didn't think so at all.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious. I used 4 chicken breasts, cut in half and there was plenty of sauce. I also sprinkled the top with cayenne pepper before baking and added chopped green onions. I would definately make this one again!

Very nice! I made this tonight for dinner and we both very much enjoyed it. This is what I did: I added the garlic while sauting the chicken and added a little salt and some seasoned pepper. (I wanted more flavor added to the chicken.) I also added red onion and asparagus to the veggies. (I would have LOVED to added some fresh mushrooms but didn't have any on hand.) I probably added a little more FRESHLY GRATED parmesan than the recipe called for... ~ 1/2 cup and garnished with some too. It was very flavorful. It does not make an alfredo sauce... it's a pasta prima vera! YUM! Thank you!

Good!  Chicken was moist and tender, sauce was good.  Next time I make this I will use Golden Mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom soup which is all I had this time.

I, too, doubled the sauce so there would be plenty--and I'm glad I did.  My husband really liked this dish and had seconds.....then later in the evening asked if there were any leftovers because he wanted more.  I cut the chicken breasts in strips which worked very nicely.  I will definitely make this again.

Oh man was this yummy!  I actually served over rice because that is what I had at the moment.  Here's another thought on this:if you wanted to spice it up a little, when making the sauce, just add some cajun seasoning.  Really enjoyed this!

My family and I didn't like this dish at all.  The flavors don't go well together.  I made it just as the recipe stated except I doubled the sauce as other viewers suggested.  I will NOT make this again.

Fantastic. I doubled the butter, wine, canned soup and cream cheese, added about a teaspoon of cayenne (or to your taste), and a can of sliced olives over the top before popping into the oven. Really amazing. DO make sure the cream cheese is softened, OR start the sauce with the cream cheese, melt it first over low heat, add the soup, then the rest of the ingredients (melt the butter in microwave before adding), and it comes out a lot smoother. Also, I have tried the chicken broth instead of white wine, and it came out distractingly salty. Definitely go low sodium with the broth if used.

This was wonderful!! I used chicken broth instead of wine. After reading other reviews,I added a little more of all the ingredients so I would have plenty of sauce. My husband wasn't fond of the way the chicken turned out, so I will grill next time and then cover in the sauce. This was wonderful!!

I tried this more because of the great ratings for it - I thought the combo of ingredients sounded odd.  It really was great, though. Give it a try.

this was ok....but i could still taste the distinctive "canned mushroom" soup taste.  my hubby liked it more than i did.  i'd just give it an "ok"...not a failure by any means. i followed the recipe except i used plain cream cheese and added dried chives and used plain condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the "golden".  maybe that made the difference?

This recipe has a delicious flavor, but I agree with other reviewers that the sauce should be doubled at least.  I made a few changes based on reading other reviews.  I used chicken tenders to cut down on time in the oven, chicken broth instead of wine, and penne instead of angel hair.  I cut back on the chicken, so I thought I didn't need to double the sauce but I was wrong.  I will definitely make this again, but I will make extra sauce.

Really like this!!  We don't drink, so I used broth instead of wine as some others.  I thought I had the dressing mix, but didn't so put in 3/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp Italian seasoning. I will double the sauce if I make as much pasta next time.  Delicious!!

Thought it was just ok.  Kind of salty.  It did taste like a restaurant's etouffee that I've eaten before, this just had chicken instead of crawfish.

Based on the reviews, I thought this was going to be great...it was all right. It was very rich, but the sauce had a tangy taste that I didn't like. I must be in the minority!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I would make would to be to make double the sauce.  The pasta was a little to dry for me.  Otherwise, it was spectacular!

My husband loved this, but I thought that it was just ok.  It was a little to cream cheesy for me.  However, I doubled the sauce and used one cream cheese with chives and one regular so that may have something to do with it.  I also didn't like the Angel Hair Pasta with it, it just seemed mushy to me.  I'll try it again with the right cream cheese and penne pasta.

This recipe was very easy, and my husband and guests ate it willingly enough. But we all agreed that the sauce was too salty (even my husband, who salts EVERYTHING!), and that it wasn't very special. I doubled the sauce recipe but used only the one packet of Italian dressing mix. I may try this again without the dressing mix and see if we like it better.

This was really good.  I added more wine than the recipe called for. This would be great with scallops or another seafood in place of the chicken.  I served this over linguine with a side salad with balsamic dressing. My guest really liked it and had 2 servings. This is a very rich sauce so serve a light desert or salad with it.

I made this for my boyfriend and I last night, and both of us really enjoyed it. I used milk instead of white wine, and regular cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden kind which I couldn't find.  When I make it again, I'll be sure to double the sauce recipe. :)

Wow!! This was a great recipe! It was so easy to make! I was worried about not liking this, because I do not like mushrooms, but boy was I wrong!! I could not taste the mushrooms at all! I bought the Tyson frozen chicken strips and just used half of the bag. Then I doubled the sauce recipe and just used half of the sauce. I saved the other half of the sauce and used it along with the rest of the chicken for another meal.

WOW! This meal was incredible. I have very picky children and they loved it as well. They cleaned their plates for once. It doesnt look that good but tastes sooooo good. This will definetely be a favorite and be cooked quite often.

My daughter really liked this one.  As everyone else said in previous reviews, double on the sauce or do what I did, add about a 1/4 c. half and half or light cream.  The extra cream tones down the salt factor as well.

Not only did I enjoy this recipe, it was a hit with the folks I served it to!  Next time, though, I'll double the recipe (except chicken) to have more sauce to spread over the pasta.

I made this for company.  The adults enjoyed it and so did the 6 kids.  I would cut the breasts into smaller pieces to make it easier to serve.  Very good flavor and leftovers were delicious!

This recipe was okay in my opinion. It had a semi-off flavor due to the unique mix of ingredients. Overall, the adults in the family thought it was just okay while the children didn't like it at all.

This was awesome! So easy too! I did make a few adjustments though. I didn't have cream cheese and chives so i used regular. I used chicken tender strips and cut them into half and then half again.I used chicken broth as others stated, about 3/4 cup just to make it go a little further and to thin it out a bit without losing any flavor. I baked this for about a half hour maybe a little more. Everyone liked it even the kids!! I thought the strips made it easier for them to eat this. I also used penne instead of angel hair. I will definitley make a double batch next time. This was great!

The recipe was easy enough, but I didn't go bonkers over the flavor. It wasn't bad tasting, it just didn't taste like anything in particular. I will make it again (due to the positive comments) but I think I will add sun-dried tomatoes or roasted garlic. Something for a distinct flavor.

Very good. Everybody liked it. I doubled the sauce but found I didn't need to.  Strong wine taste.  Next time I will use chicken broth with a dash of sherry.  Overall a nice dish for very little effort.  I will make this again.

This was very good! I also made a few changes. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and cooked it on the stove as opposed to the oven. I increased the sauce by using 1 can of golden mushroom and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom. I also added green onions and mushrooms. As another reviewer suggested, I used chicken broth (1 cup) instead of the white wine. Next time I think I'd try the wine. I would definitely make this again. Thanks!

This recipe was okay - definitely not restaurant quality. I followed all the advice - doubling sauce, easing up on the italian dressing, using chicken broth instead, cutting chicken into pieces...My guests loved it but I could still taste something I didn't like (liquor?)and it must be in the golden mushroom soup. Chicken was super moist though. I'll give it 4 stars because my guests enjoyed it so much (I would have rated it 3 stars).

This recipe went over very well with everyone! I cut the chicken into smaller pieces, added chopped broccoli, parmesan cheese, and tossed it all together in a large bowl. I used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of white wine.

I thought this made a really tasty, easy meal.  I used only  12oz. angel hair pasta and used a pound of chicken tenderloins cut into pieces.  There was plenty of chicken for the recipe and plenty of sauce as well.  It even tasted great the next day as leftovers!

We had this for dinner and my family loved it. We do not drink alcohol so I substituted water for the wine and it worked well. Next time I will double the sauce. It really was not enough for the chicken breasts.

Everyone in the family loves this dish! My only suggestions are: make 1 1/2 batches of the sauce so that there's plenty for the pasta and check the chicken at 40 minutes or it may get over cooked. Fantastic!!!

Flavors were very good. Presentation was not great. Maybe next time i will use a thicker pasta such as fettucine and maybe slice up the chicken to lay on top for better presentation. Flavor was very good though. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this several times, and shared the recipe with family.  Always a hit.  Substitutions I have made are light butter, light cream cheese with chives, and sometimes golden mushroom dijon soup.  I also think it's really good with capers added toward the end.

Yuck, I didn't enjoy this dinner at all.  Maybe it was just me, because the rest of the familysaid they liked it, but I just thought the taste was too strong.  There were some really strong flavors going on here that just overpowered me.  I'm thinking it was the golden mushroom soup, which I never used before and won't use again.  I don't recommend this one.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I used bowtie pasta instead of angel hair pasta and I cut the chicken up into bite size piecess also.  I've made this several times and will most likely make it again.

This is worth all the hype, it is definitely a 5 star recipe!  I used 3 chicken brests and sliced them in half so I had 6.  I also only used 8 oz. of pasta and it was more than enough.  Next time I will probably double the sauce because it was so good!  A must make.

Wonderful! So easy and delicious. My husband raved and my two year old actually ate! I followed the recipe exactly but used only four chicken breasts. Just enough sauce for the chicken and my husband took the leftover chicken for lunch today. Thanks!

I was really excited to try this recipe, but was pretty disappointed.  I don't like the taste of processed foods and I thought the sauce tasted like it came from a jar... It was edible, but would not make it again.

Thank you so much for this recipe. My whole family loved it. I kept the ingredients the same but I fixed it just a little differently because I was in a hurry. I cooked 2 boneless chicken breasts in the microwave and then cut them up and added them too the sauce. Then I put the mixture in the oven for 30 minutes instead of an hour. It turned out great. Thanks!

Very tasty.  I did not have golden mushroom soup so I substituted chicken broth.  I also cut up the breasts and sauteed them in a little butter in order to reduce the baking time from 60 to 30 minutes.  The sauce is excellent and should be doubled for six breasts and pasta.  My family really enjoed this pasta dish so its a keeper.

My family LOVES this, including my picky 15 year old son.  This is real comfort food.  I make it with regular cream of mushroom soup as I am allergic to sulfites and can't eat the golden mushroom soup as it has wine in it.  Even better reheated the next day!

All I can say is YUM!  Didn't have any wine in the house, so used more milk as someone else suggested, worked great.  This dish is fabuolous with steamed broccoli spears on the side.

Yum!  Both my husband and I enjoyed this meal!  I accidently doubled the butter, so I had to scoop up as much as I could from the top.  Whoops!  I served it with cheddar bay biscuits (also from this site).  I would recommend this!

This was absolutely wonderful!  My whole family loved it.  I forgot the italian dressing powder so used 1/2 cup pre-made dressing and it was great!  The best part is the smell while it's cooking!

I made a few changes to this dish.  First, I used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom and low fat cream cheese instead of the full fat version.  I also skipped the wine and used water.  Second, I made the whole thing on the stovetop by cutting the chicken into bite sized pieces and cooking it in a saute pan, then I removed it and made the sauce.  After all of the sauce ingredients were combined, I added the chicken and cooked together while I boiled the water and cooked the pasta.

I thought this was very good.  My husband thought it was ok but he really does not care for creamy sauces.  There was plenty of sauce, but I only used two breasts since it was just my husband and I eating.  I think if I had used four breasts there still would have been enough sauce but using six would probably have needed more.  My husband also found the dish to be a bit salty, but I thought it was fine.  Overall, this is a good dish.  It was not resturant quality, but still very good.

A "10" out of 5.This was very, very good.I used chicken breast tenders, because I accidently thawed them, and they came out great!I made this with bow tie pasta, and my hesband took the leftovers (cold!) and ate them at work. SO full of FLAVOR!Absolutly no bland, dry chicken here! This is one I would pull out to impress MY mom.

I was very optomistic about this recipe since it had so many great reviews, but was sadly disappointed.  It was probably my falt since what we didn't like about it was that the chicken came out too dry.  The sauce was very tasty though.  I substitued cream of mushroom soup for the golden and fettuccini for the noodles.  I'll probably try making this again either on the stovetop, as some of the other reveiws mentioned, or with a shorter cook time.

This turned out very good and was requested 3 nights in a row. I'm not quite old enough to buy wine so i subbed chicken broth. Also I used cream of mushroom instead of golden. Kind of bland looking. Tasted very resaurant-y.

I made this last night.  It was pretty good.  I used unsalted butter, but it was still a touch salty.  I will make it again, but next time, I will grill and cut up the chicken, and serve it over egg noodles instead of pasta.  I would recommend these changes to others, because the chicken itself was a little bland in the sauce.  But overall, it was good--a lot like a chicken stroganov.

This was so great, it's a keeper. My kids are usually very picky eaters and they loved this one. They were leery about the mushrooms, but they couldn't tell where they were in the recipe. It was melt in your mouth good. Will make this a weekly meal. Didn't get any leftovers cuz we ate it all in one sitting. The only difference was I used bone in chicken breasts cuz I was out of boneless, but it still worked wonderfully, just cooked it a little longer than what it called for. Used bread to sope up the juices. It was so good!

This is a wonderful and simple recipe. I used plain cream cheese with 3 fresh, chopped green onions instead. I also used sherry instead of white wine and it still tastes great. The chicken is very tender.

REALLY REALLY good chicken recipe.  I used sherry ( 1/2 cup ) instead of wine.  Also used vermecelli pasta ( as my store didnt have angel hair ) and topped it with sauteed mushrooms.  Such little work for so much praise. A keeper.

I added 12oz of fresh mushrooms to this and marinated the chicken in Italian dressing the night before and it was a hit!  Great for guests!

We enjoyed this chicken dish very much.  My husband said, "you have to make this one a regular", meaning he wants it again!  I added fresh mushrooms about 20 min. prior to the chicken being ready since I am a mushroom lover.  Easy to prepare and very creamy and filling.  Thanks!  Dayna

We didn't have wine in the house so I took another's suggestion of using chicken,I also doubled the sauce with one packet of italian seasoning and 1/8 cup of italian dressing, I also didn't have cream cheese with chives but reg cream cheese.  It wasn't salty at all. Don't be afraid to stray, it turned out great for us. May this sound strange, for left overs I added jalepenos (which I love on everything).

I added a pint of heavy cream into the sauce to make it creamier and make more volume.  Also sliced some fresh mushrooms into it.  It was GREAT.  My husband absolutely loved it.

I made the sauce the night before, and let the chicken defrost overnight. Then the next day all i had to do was spoon the sauce over the chicken and put it in the oven for an hour. That's it.  I used chicken broth instead of the white wine. One of the people at the dineer sounded like Bill Murray on the movie What About Bob? there were "mmm's" and "this is really good" all around the table. I have to admit, I didn't think it would be as good as it was. It was really good.  The smell is strong, but the taste is just right.  Super easy and delicious. Especially if you are coming home from work. Pop it in the oven while you are changing out of work clothes and relaxing, and then it'll be done.

This is a very flavorful dish and I was surprised how well the flavors went together. To reduce saltiness a bit, you could use less of the dressing mix. Also, my sauce was pretty thick, so I will think it up a little next time. Otherwise very tasty. Be sure to serve with a colorful salad or side because it doesn't look the best by itself.

Made this twice, and I really don't like it.  There is too much going on with the ingredients, and the result is no one flavor dominated - its a cacaphony of too many flavors.  I will not be making this again - not even worth experimenting with.

I tend not to cook with my crockpot as it has not always yielded the results I want.  My daughter told me about this recipe and I tried it.  It is wonderful.  No crockpot taste at all.

I really like the concept behind this recipe but I had to make some changes for my husbands distaste for mushrooms. I used cream of chicken soup and doubled soup, cream cheese, and added some additional butter. This helped to lessen the salty taste and gave plenty of sauce for the pasta. I also used a cup of water instead of the wine. This makes a lot!

I made this last night and everyone loved it. The sauce has a strogonoff-type flavor. Since my family doesn't eat much salt, I used unsalted butter and only half the italian dressing package even though I doubled all other sauce ingredients. With my modifications, the sauce was still a bit salty, but nothing over powering. Next time I'll try to add ingredients that are fat reduced, just to make it a little healthier. Overall a wonderful recipe.

A great recipe!!!
I sustituted the wine with apple Juice
I added 1 cup chicken broth
& added thinly sliced cooked vegetables al-dente(Broccli, roasted red peppers & cauliflour) right at the end before serving.
My husband & 1 year old love it!!! 
It's a great way to sneak in vegetables!!

I was looking for a new chicken recipe and was happy to see this recipe.  It seemed easy enough, and from the ingredients it sounded real tasty.  I read through most of the reviews, and some people mentioned salty and winey, and doubling the sauce part.  I doubled the ingredients for the sauce part, but concerned about it being to salty or winey, I used the original amount of italian mix and wine. 2 out of 3 of my kids loved it,the other is just plain picky about food in general and my husband and I loved it.  My husband said "Put a star next to that recipe, that was delicious."  Even with altering the sauce ingredients, it still had great flavor, and I didn't feel that it was too salty.  I recommend it!  Oh and I used fettucine instead of angel hair, never had much luck with angel hair pasta.

I found this recipe about a month 1/2 ago and have made it six times already! It tastes like something you would order off a 5 star resturant menu. I did find that using cream of mushroom instead of golden mushroom tasted better.  The recipe has already been passed to family and friends endless times, its everyones favorite!

This was a good easy recipe, but I did not find it as amazing as some of the reviews did.  I agree that it was too salty. I used white "cooking" wine though, that has salt added to it.  We have a similar recipe in my family made with c/o  mushroom soup and onion soup mix and white wine that is easier and tastes even better.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times and my husband and kids love it.  I usually omit the white wine and use regular italian dressing to make up for the liquid, I find when using dry italian it becomes a little too salty.  The recipe is just as good with lower fat cream cheese (Neaufchatel) and even better when fresh chives are added.

This was a VERY good past recipe. Easy and quick. I did cut down on the Italian seasoning per the recommendation of so may others and it was just right! My husband and son devoured it. I'll definitely make it again.

I found this recipe quick and easy to make.  We didn't have any cream cheese with chives at our local grocery store, so I improvised by putting in fresh chives when adding the cream cheese.  Next time I make it, I would think about adding fresh mushrooms as well.  Whoever, put this recipe on-line the first time, thank you.

I thought this recipe, as it was, was a little too rich for pasta.  I added some chicken broth so it wasn't quite so thick.  It was incredibly flavourful and a recipe I'm sure I will continue to make.

This was fairly easy to make.  I used fresh chives and Neufchatel cheese.  It was really good and the kids liked it pretty well.  We will probably eat it without the pasta in the future, although I liked the sauce on the pasta (the rest of the family thought the pasta wasn't necessary).  I'll make it again.

This was delicious and SOOOO EASY!!!  I made some changes though...used 1/2 the meat, ziti instead of spaghetti, cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom.  And to dilute the saltiness, I added some cream, milk and water...and into the oven.  After it was all done, my sauce came out watery.  So I added cornstarch to thicken it up.  

Still, a great and easy dish...will make again and again!!!

I wasnt sure I was going to like this when I was just making the sauce.  A strange mix of ingredients.  But, this turned out to be very good, although I think some steamed broccoli would add some good color and texture to the recipe.

This recipe was very easy and looked like you spent alot of time.  My kids loved it, especially served over angel hair pasta.  Instead of butter, I substituted chicken broth (to lower fat content), I also used half light cream cheese and half fat free. The wine I replaced with alchohol free wine.  None of the substitutions seemed to change the taste.  It was delicious!

I so wanted to love this recipe.  All the reviews raved about it, so I was planning for the best chicken dish I've made yet.  I am sorry but I really did not enjoy this.  It was filmy and way too salty.  We ate it but I will never make it again.

What a delicious recipe!  I didn't have enough chicken, so I used a combination of chicken and boneless pork and that was wonderful!

I hate to be the first one to give this a bad review.  But, I thought the taste was horrible.  My family agrees.  We doubled the sauce, I followed the recipe with the exeption of adding in 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms.  My husband & I both had about 8 bites, and that was enough.  We just didn't care for it at all.  I hate that I've wasted 6 chicken breasts.  Happy cooking!

I made this recipe with bowtie pasta and honestly cannot say that I've ever had better, however, I mistakenly used 1 stick of butter instead of a half stick, wow...rich and wonderful!

I have altered this using what I have...like plain cream cheese, healthy request cream of chicken soup and A LOT less butter and the recipe is excellent!!!  I also use half of the amount of noodles because I like alot of sauce.  I have recommended this recipe to several people with excellent reviews!!  Try it and you will see!

Unanimously a winner! Lots of different flavors that go well together. Cubed chicken and added peas and fresh mushrooms. Doubled sauce and served over rotini pasta. Yum!! Thanks Marian!

Me and my husband really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very easy to put together.  I did double the sauce, added fresh mushrooms and put it over Bow Tie pasta, it was delicious. Very tasty, the chicken was tender. A great dish. Just one question while baking a film formed on top, I was wondering if there was a way to prevent that from happening?  I would definitely make this one again!

I had to substitue chicken mushroom soup for the golden mushroom soup, and I subbed fresh chives and cream cheese for the cream cheese with chives - it was still great!  I would recommend making more sauce than called for and not cooking the chicken so long.

We did have problems finding cream cheese with chives so we used low-fat cream cheese and added chives.  After it was done we cut up the chicken and served over rice.  It was wonderful!!

This dish was very good, I might try using 1/2 the soup next time, the sauce was too thick for my tastes.  I used chicken strips instead and cooked them seperatly in a pan while the sauce was cooking and then brought it all together.  That made this dish MUCH quicker!

The finish product is very good and tasty espcially if you use spring onions along with the chives.The only downside of the recipe would be with the measurments givin it was barely enough to feed my family of three. Even thought it says it feeds six. I would have to see that. I will be making this recipe again.

This was very good.  My kids balked at the mushroom soup, and if it weren't for them, I would have added fresh mushrooms.  I'll definitely have this again.

This is a regular at our house.  Do not use reduced fat cream cheese.  I tried twice, and the sauce came out oily and runny.  Thanks for a great recipe, Marian!

I was initially disappointed with this recipe.  However, I found it was much better the next day.  In fact, it was very tasty the next day and I will make this again.  Next time, I think I'll try reducing the butter a bit.

This dish is FOOLPROOF.  Great for a beginner.  I was concerned about the saltiness some reviewers commented on so I added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water and a little more wine.
 I think it needed an herb or spice though.  I cant figure out what..Maybe lemon juice or fresh chives on top.  I cooked it for a shorter time at a higher temp. and the chicken came out lovely and moist.  My family found it "cheesy" but ate it.  This is not gourmet fare but a perfectly fine easy dish.

I cut the chicken breast in half, breaded with flower mixture and browned in a skillet.  Then, place chicken and sauce in the oven for 35 minutes.  Substituted half chicken broth, half milk for wine and doubled sauce recipe.  It tasted great but wasn't quite as good as I expected.

My family really likes this recipe.  For more of a mushroom taste I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce while it was cooking and also doubled the recipe for the sauce so there would be more on the pasta and chiken.

I thought I would be "smart" since I like cream cheese & I added 8 oz instead of 4. Way too rich for me, but otherwise it would've been delicious.

I have made this several times and enjoyed it myself but was disappointed that when I made it for guests they had little to say after seeing all the great reviews! I also think when leftovers are reheated it becomes too salty.

This recipe was a hit with my teenagers. They absolutely loved the sauce, and yet it had a complex enough taste that would go well at a dinner party. Instead of pasta, I served it over white rice.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe!  I doubled the sauce and broiled the chicken seperatly with just a dash of salt and pepper...served it on the side with the pasta and sauce.  I will most certainly make this again!

The sauce was great, but the chicken was rather tough.
