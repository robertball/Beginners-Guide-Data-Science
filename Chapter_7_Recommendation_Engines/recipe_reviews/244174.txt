The layer of strawberries on the bottom not only adds some sweetness, it keeps the oatmeal moist.  I didn't have any dried orange peel, so I just added orange zest to the oat mixture.  I think vanilla/almond milk would make this even tastier, and I even had some in the fridge (darn it!).  This had just the right amount of sweetness for me, and the juicy blueberries just pop in your mouth.  A great, tasty breakfast and a filling one, too. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

We absolutely loved this breakfast!  I put it together last night and took it out of the refrigerator this morning while the oven was heating.   I didn't have strawberries, so used blueberries both on the bottom and top.  It did need to cook the full 28 minutes.  Delicious!

Very good choice for breakfast.  This will keep well for a few days.  I mix the fruit right into the oatmeal, and it stays moist and tasty.

Made this for my son.  I used bananas rather than blueberries(didn't have them).  I also used more oatmeal because I didn't have oat bran.  Both he and his sister loved it.  It was gone before I knew it. Now I have oat bran and will try it that way. Definitely a keeper and easy to change to get variety. Awesome!

might be worth another shot. needs to cook way longer. maybe a little less milk and more vanilla? maybe the oat bran is really important, too.
