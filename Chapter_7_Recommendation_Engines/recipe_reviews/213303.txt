This is a great recipe! I didn't have cream of chicken, but I had cream of mushroom. I added a half cup of chicken stock instead of water, and it did the trick. I also added fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. It tastes delicious and oh-so-easy!

Very good and very easy to make. Even with the 98% fat free cream and reduced fat parmesan cheese I used..it was still a very flavorful and filling meal.

Easy to make, however, I found the recipe to be very bland.  I added chicken, however, I would real minced garlic when cooking the chicken and add more salt and pepper once the sauce is combined.  Goes well with garlic toast.

This was pretty tasty! The only changes I made were to use fresh veggies (carrots, broccoli, zucchini) that I briefly blanched then added at the very end. We also sauteed a couple of chicken breasts and added to the sauce. Easy, quick and yummy!

Had good flavor but too much on veggies and could use some chopped chicken.  Fresh veggies would be better also.

Very easy and tasty! my fiance went for seconds, which is always a good sign! I did add about a pound of fresh shrimp and about a 1/2 tbsp of crushed red pepper to add a lil kick to the sauce. Came out very tasty!

This was a super easy and fast. I made it with Rotini noodles and blackened chicken. I was looking for a replacement for the big bag of premade garlic chicken by birds eye and this fit the bill.

very tasty! a little salty for my liking, which could not be helped because it was from the canned soup.  I added milk to help take away a bit of the saltiness.   I used broccoli, carrots, and peppers.  I also added chopped up bacon & chicken.

Nice quick & easy recipe to have for those days when there's not much time on hand!
