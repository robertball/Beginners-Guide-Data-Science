OH MY GOODNESS!  I cut the recipe in half as I only had one loaf pan.  I will be buying another!  As Hubby cannot have nuts any more, I replaced the walnuts with raisins that I plumped.  He also requested icing on top; so, I used the recipe from Clone of a Cinnabon.  Absolutely delicious.  5 STARS ALL THE WAY!  Thank you MN Nice for sharing your recipe!!

This cinnamon bread is excellent. I followed the recipe ingredients but made rolls instead of a loaf and added raisins. I LOVE the filling so I doubled the ingredients to satisfy my sweet tooth and I'm glad I did because to my liking there was barely enough to cover both rectangles. I added 1 cup Thomson raisins, soaked for 30 min. in 1/4 cup brandy with a 1/4 tsp sugar sprinkled over them (kills the bitterness)  stirring a few times to coat them evenly. The dough is great to work with and not sticky at all. When I sprinkled the raisins over the sugar mix I put a sheet of wax paper to cover it  and ran the rolling pin over it lightly a few times to press the mixture into the dough (makes rolling it up easier and less filling leaks out). I rolled it up from the long end and sliced it into 1" pieces and popped them into Pam-sprayed muffin tins. I always brush my rolls with soft butter and sprinkle a little brown sugar over them, about 1/8 tsp on each (to keep some yummy, gooey syrup on the tops). It only took 15 min to turn golden with syrup spread over the tops.Even though I doubled the filling very little of it leaked out. I lifted each to a rack and while still warm I drizzled the tops with basic milk/icing sugar  glaze. When they cooled I drizzled a 2nd layer of glaze over the tops as it will not soak into the roll and disappear.  Then I ate 4 of them! My goodness, this beautiful bread makes accidental rolls a great mistake. Thank you MN Nice for sharing.

Stellar!  I didn't have walnuts, and kids don't like them anyway.  I just used the cinnamon/sugar mixture and it was still fantastic.

I know I have a winning recipe on my hands when my husband and 3 year old start snacking on it as soon as its cool enough to handle and immediatly ask me to make it again soon. This bread turned out so well, just like a cinnamon roll in loaf form. I don't have a bread machine so I did have to adjust the directions for use in my stand mixer. I combined the white sugar and warm milk in my mixer bowl and added the yeast to proof. Once proofed I mixed in the eggs and softened butter until the butter was broken up into chunks and the eggs were mixed in. I then added the flour/salt that had already been mixed to combine. I let the dough hook do all the kneading and when finished I lightly oiled the bowl and the top of the dough, covered with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled. From that point on I followed the recipe except for doubling the sugar/cinnamon part of the filling. I made one loaf with walnuts and one without since my husband isn't crazy about them. We can't wait to try this bread toasted tomorrow morning. The only change I'll make next time is to brush the dough with an egg wash before baking so it comes out nice and glossy. Highly recommend!

Excellent!  I could tell from the recipe that there would not be enough filling without the walnuts, and since I planned to omit them, I, too, doubled the cinnamon/sugar mixture. When baked and thickly sliced, the texture of this bread is smooth and soft, the sticky, cinnamon-spicy sweetness oozes out and it creates the perfect ratio of bread to filling.  The kids slathered their slices in homemade apple butter a friend gave us for Christmas, but even plain, this stuff is heavenly!

Awesome recipe for cinnamon swirl bread. Besides being fun to make  these loaves were absolutely delicious! I opted to use raisins instead of nuts. I shall use nuts next time, as I will definitely be making this bread on a regular basis! Thank You for such a wonderful recipe! Yummy stuff!

I've tried this recipe twice and being a very novice breadmaker, I love the end result!  I did not have bread flour, so used all purpose flour and did have to let it rise for close to 90 minutes before it had risen enough to almost fill the pan.  Very happy with it and my kids love it!!

I will definitely make this again! Like other reviewers, I doubled the filling (butter, brown sugar, cinnamon). I put pecans in one loaf and raisins in the other loaf. I also rolled it up like the picture (starting from both sides and meeting in the middle.) I baked on a cool day so it took my loaves 1 hr to double in size before baking. Delicious!!

This made two wonderful loaves of goodness. Next time I will roll the dough tighter, as my bread was rather holey, but this did not affect the flavor or the amount of time it took for the bread to be devoured! A definite keeper!

This is good.  I coulding get the bread to go in 9x14 rectangles, so the swirl was more like a blobs but the two loafs did go fast.  Will make again.

My family and I thought this was awesome!!! I did double the cinnamon and sugar and nuts and it turned out perfect!!! Also I would let it raise for more than 30 minutes probably close to an hour before baking.... Otherwise super awesome!!!!

Loved this recipe. It took my dough 1 1/2 hours to rise and I thought maybe it still needed more time or maybe a little more yeast next time. And I didn't have 2 loaf pans so I just rolled the whole dough ball out into a large flat rectangle, spread about 1/2 cup a butter all over it and sprinkled the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture all over it (which I doubled without the nuts). Then I rolled it up. It was a huge log that fit in my 9x13 pan (seam side down). I just pinched the ends a little to help keep the filling in.  It came out looking like a cinnamon bun when sliced. It was amazing! Next time I will add more yeast and maybe make a cinnamon bun icing to drizzle on each piece when served. Definitely will do again.

MY ADAPTIONS AND CHANGES: I put in the bread machine for the dough cycle. Then after rolling it out and spreading the filling, I let it rise covered in greased plastic wrap on the preheated oven for 1 hour.
I left out the nuts and DOUBLED the filling as someone suggested. I also used 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. I use 2 tsp. of yeast as 1 1/2 tsp. didn't rise enough. I also increased the cinnamon in the filling. So my filling is 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, 4 T. margarine, 6 teaspoons of cinnamon. No added sugar in the dough. But I make a confectioner's sugar icing to drizzle on it cooled. 1 1/2 c. of it, 4 T. margarine, which I use instead of butter, 1 tsp. of milk, the vanilla extract is optional.

Perfect just as written!!! I didn't have walnuts and so did not use them but wow!!! I let my first batch rise for 30 minutes in the pan and couldnt tell if it had doubled completely but when I went to bake them they came right up out of the pan... I will make this many times over.. Don't cut them before they are cooled or the swirl will drip and make a sticky mess... just saying.. we couldn't wait to taste the bread... Ha ha.. also I tried it like the picture and with a simple roll and the one like the picture definitely held up better, the swirl didn't hold its shape...

I feel bad for low-rating this recipe, because I did change it...I doubled the filling as others suggested, and used 1tsp of bread machine yeast as that was the conversion for instant yeast vs. active dry yeast. I'm not sure where I went wrong, but my dough didn't rise and I basically ended up with 2 cinnamon roll logs. They didn't taste terrible, but it would've been nice if they had some more air in them.

Loved this bread!  My husband and kids loved it too.   I left the walnuts out because my kids don't like them.  I did double the cinnamon and sugar mixture as others suggested and I'm glad that I did.  I plan on making this often.

This bread is a pain in the butt to make because of all the waiting for the bread machine, waiting for it to rise, etc, but it is DIVINE! My husband begs me to make this all the time. At least the recipe makes two loaves!

This recipe was awesome and super easy! I didn't have walnuts so I skipped that, but I did double the cinnamon/sugar filling which I would highly recommend doing. It came out perfect..... Very happy and will make many times again in the future I'm sure! :)

I make this all the time.  Just add some raisins sometimes.  It is so easy :)  It takes about two hours for mine to double in pan.  That could be because I do not use bread flour and I keep my house as an icebox but it is so worth it.  About 20 minutes worth of work for a wonderful treat.  The bread machine is the best thing ever

Yummy, soft, perfect cinnamon bread... and easy too!  I love this recipe and will be making it again soon.  I followed it exactly, just had to let it rise in the pan an extra hour longer (my house was a bit cool).  I love making fresh bread, but had never used the machine for the dough.  This is the way to do it.  So much less work!  Next time, I'll add raisins as cinnamon raisin is a family favorite!

Really liked this.  Used raisins instead of walnuts, based on preference.

I've made this a few times now and it comes out great every time.  I love being able to use the bread machine to get most of the work done - it makes it a breeze.  The flavor of this bread is terrific.  The first time I doubled the sugar, butter and cinnamon as some recommended, but this made it too sweet and too sloppy.  After that, I've just doubled the cinnamon because I love the flavor of cinnamon and like it really prominent in the bread.  I don't use the walnuts out of personal preference and in recognition that the weight of the nuts will weigh the bread down.  It comes out light, fluffy and is especially good when warm.  If there are leftovers, try warming them up for a few seconds in the microwave.  Yum!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

It was delicious!  My family ate 1 whole loaf as soon as it came out of the oven!  Will definitely make it again!  I did add extra brown sugar and cinnamon for the swirl--yummy!

I made a dairy free version of this due to family allergies.  Substituted the milk with soy milk and the butter with Earth Balance spread.  I doubled the mix like others did and it came oozing out of the seems.  Next time I will need to get those closed better.  Tasted great!

This recipe for cinnamon bread is awesome! Really taste good! 
I made cinnamon rolls, instead of cinnamon swirl bread and brushed it with caster sugar dissolved in water! Perfectly good!
So yummy!

Loved it.  I only had store bought cinnamon sugar, so I just spread that on the dough along with the walnuts, left out the brown sugar.  Let it rise about one hour.  I like to proof my yeast separately, so I combined milk, eggs , and sugar and warmed in microwave to lukewarm.  Then added the yeast,  let it rest for ten minutes.  Dump it in bread machine added the flour and lastly the salt.  The dough was very easy to work with.

This bread was SO good!  It was like eating a fresh cinnamon roll!  My kids devoured one loaf as soon as it was cool enough to cut!
We didn't add nuts because I didn't have any, and it was still delicious!  Plan on making it again and again in the future!

Very good.  I always roll out way too much with cinnamon bread and tend to get more loaves out of the recipes I try.  This time it worked perfectly since I got 2 loaves and a batch of cinnamon rolls--perfect because I was making this at the request of a coworker who asked for one or the other--and I gave her both!  She loved both, and I topped the cinnamon rolls with the frosting recipe from Clone of a Cinnabon--easy, quick (just remember to soften everything first!), and without milk (very important since I had no milk in the house).  I did use the normal amount of yeast I use for similar ratios as I bake all the time, so I used 2 1/4 teaspoons, and I needed more flour (about 1/2  a cup) to get the dough to the correct consistency.  That, of course, can vary due to humidity but a good reminder to check during the cycle if you are using a bread machine.  I gave one loaf to my coworker early (it was for her goodbye breakfast) and she ate half before noon.  I'd say she loved it.  :)  thanks for the recipe!

So so delicious. If you don't have/like walnuts, double the cinnamon-sugar mixture to fill the bread.  Delicious with coffee in the morning.

This is the recipe I used for the first time ever making bread in my new bread machine I got for Christmas. Followed the recipe and turned out wonderful! I have a big sweet tooth so I'm going to double the filling next time. I'm DEFINITELY making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Exceptional recipe. Light, moist, flavorful. The recipe makes enough dough for two standard 8x4 loaves. I made one with walnuts; the other without. I brushed each loaf with butter before baking.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. Definitely my new go-to!

Only four stars because I didn't think it had enough filling.  I doubled the white sugar in the dough and then I doubled all the ingredients for the filling. Could have even had more I think.  Next time I'll add raisins!

AMAZING!  This is a great recipe!  First loaf is half gone and it only came out of the oven 20 min ago. I followed the recipe except I used twice the butter in the filling and  twice the cinnamon. I added raisins to the second loaf. Wonderful taste, thank you for the recipe!

First try was okay. All of the filling melted out of the bottom. Trying again with half the amount of ingredients to just make 1 loaf. Halved the butter and doubled the filling to see if that fixes the issue. Added a pinch of nutmeg and used fresh ground cinnamon from sticks. Tasted less spicy and more mellow.

I have a bread maker but opted out of using it for this recipe. Still turned out great! I have a friend who dislikes cinnamon bread but somehow ate 4 slices of this batch. Lol. I followed the tips of doubling the cinnamon sugar filling and loved it. Will make again and again!!!

I prefer not to have hard textures in my breads, so I omitted the walnuts. The loaves turned out amazingly! I have made this 3 times in a week, because a loaf never lasts a full day. It is literally that damned good.

O.M.G. this is a great recipe! Im always looking for quality recipes I can use with my bread machine and this one just blew my old recipe out of the water. The only thing I did different was made 2 batches of the cinnamon sugar, 1 I added crushed walnuts to and the other got raisin to please those who like nuts and those who dont. My loaves also got a nice thick cream cheese drizzle that my family loves.  I couldnt buy a single small loaf for what it cost to make these so I will definitely be making over and over again.

No changes, followed the recipe.
I made the bread in the morning and sons  consumed it before dinner time. 
It's a bread I'll be making again.
Thanks

I loved this so much! this turned out so good. the only thing I did diffrent was throw some extra brown surger on the top once in the pan. my next batch I'm thing about buttering it then also rolling it in brown surger. will for sa ure make this again! it made it a little sticky but gave it more of a cinnamon and surger taste. cant wait to make more!

Love this! This is fantastic bread! I'vr cut down on our sugar consumption, so I just substituted coconut sugar for the brown sugar & it was great! I also made a coconut sugar & maple syrup glaze which satisfied my husband's sugar craving. Great recipe!

Made this bread and it disappeared the same day! not too sweet and had a great texture. my family loved it! I  did have to make 1 change and swap out nuts and replace them with raisins due to nut allergy, but next time I'll just make a double batch so we can have both

The texture of this bread is phenomenal. I followed the directions exactly. This is awesome recipe. I will definitely be making this a lot. The only thing that I had a problem with is once I put the dough in the pans, my dough didn't rise as it was supposed to. I went ahead and baked it anyways and it was delicious. My cinnamon did ooze out the side of the bread. Amazing recipe!

This is, hands down, the most sought after thing I bake! My family loves it. I cannot keep the bread in supply fast enough. I make it exactly as it says. I have drizzled cinnamon bun icing on the slices as well.

This is the best thing I've made using my bread machine! My two sons and husband devoured one loaf almost immediately. I bulked up the filling by about 25% and omitted the nuts and it was perfect (would have been 5 star with no changes). The bread part was perfectly moist and springy, absolutely delicious. This will be in regular rotation.

Fantastic on the first try!  I did take some other reviewer's suggestion and doubled the cinnamon/sugar filling, which in my opinion made it all that much better.  Will absolutely be making this again.

This was quite good. I was looking for a recipe to replace buying cinnamon-raisin bread & this wasn't it. It is almost like a desert like bread that tasted really good. I found it better on the 2nd day.

Made it just as written with plumped raisins instead of nuts and it is just stupid good! Iced the tops with the "Clone of Cinnabon Icing" and it is truly off the chain! My wife who is on a strict paleo diet almost ate an entire loaf by herself! Whaaat?? Make it! You'll be so happy! Well, and everyone else too. :-)

OMG so yummy! Halved the recipe for one loaf and used my Quisinart with dough hook. Warmed milk, added the sugar and 1 tsp of yeast (used AP flour). Proofed 10 mins, mixed in the egg and butter and slowly added the flour/salt. Mixed on med speed for about  5 mins until the dough was smooth. Put it in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic and let it double, about 1 hr. Did the rest as written, letting it rise again in the loaf pan about 45 mins. I see why some would double the filling so next time, I'll add a bit more cinnamon and brown sugar but double would be too much for me. Also brushed the dough with egg for even browning but that's just my preference. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I would definitely make it again. My Rolling technique wasn't that great but it still tasted yummy. I didn't have any nuts, so I ended up just adding some cranberries in it. I like using the decorating sugar on top, and gives it a nice crunchy taste.

Instead of cutting the recipe in half, I made one bread and one set of cinnamon rolls. They cook just a few minutes short of 30 minutes. I love that I get a double batch out of this recipe. Thanks

This is an delicious bread. I followed suggestions and doubled the filling. I also  used raisins instead of walnuts. We ate one bread in a day. I froze the other one.  Don't leave them in the pan too long or it can stick. Will definetly be making this again !!

Because my bread machine is only a 1.5 lb not a 2lb loaf. I cut the dough in half after rolling it out and split it into two large loaf pans. Consequently I let them rise to a regular height and then baked. The loaf turned out delectably light and flakey, but when sliced it was so airy that it wouldnt stay together enough to put into the toaster. My family still loved it though! Just made another loaf today & added a little vital wheat gluten to see what happens. It was a lot harder to roll out because of the increased elasticity, but I only rolled it out to fit in my smaller but longer skinny loaf pan & its rising beautifully. Going to pop it in the oven now :)
**Turned out awesome & golden brown! Love this recipe!

Light and fluffy!
I added a little vanilla to the milk, melted butter and eggs.  Once bread machine finished the "dough" I made one loaf and 8 cinnamon buns.   Did not add any nuts due to allergies. 
Will defiantly make again.

Just made this last week for the first time & it was a huge success!!!  We love it, making it again today. I did need to leave it longer to fully rise & doubled the brown sugar filling because hubby has a real sweet tooth ?? I also discovered that if it gets a bit stale after a couple days you can pop it in the toaster then butter it ??

My girls and I make this all the time. Either 2 loaves or we roll them small into buns\mini rolls. A less sweet alternative to cinnabons and great for breakfast.... if they make it. It's our regular.

Left out walnuts and ended up using dark brown sugar from neighbor since I was out of light - Fantastic. Tried to cover the top after 15 min so it wouldn't be too dark but seemed like it wasn't done cooking after 30 minutes so I did uncover and bake an additional 5 minutes or so. Top was brown but taste was perfect.

This is so good, I always make two loaves like the directions say and they are gone within a few hours.  The bread turns out nice an chewy which is how we like it, and the crust is nice too.  I add more walnuts and sugar cinnamon mix and it is divine with morning coffee.

I made this today, it did sink in the middle as it cooled
But it was delicious and easy to make.  I doubled filling as well.

Deeeeelish. Best recipe I've come across in a few years! The only adjustment that I made was more butter and cinnamon/sugar/walnuts and I used cinnamon and sugar on top of the loaf. Bread is fluffy, tastes delicious and was pretty easy to make! One more bonus, it makes your entire house smell like a bakery....yum. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this without using a bread machine. I warmed the milk and dissolved the yeast in it. Next, I added the wet ingredients, followed by the dry ingredients.( I had to add a little more flour.) After kneading the dough, I put it in a warm oven to rise for an hour. It was wonderful. My entire family loved it.

I gave this recipe a try. It was simple enough. I noticed that the dough was very sticky while kneading in the machine and I added about three tablespoons of flour one tablespoon at a time until the consistency was better. I followed the recipe for the filling as written.  The color was excellent . After it baked I added a little butter to the crust.  I didn't feel like it required  any powdered sugar.  It was delicious with softened butter and would probably be better with cream cheese.   A recipe definitely worth trying.  I will be making this again.

I had several breads to bake today, and thought, this would help me get one of the sweet ones I needed accomplished as my bread machine handled everything. The dough was wonderful when the cycle was complete and really helped me with my day, saving much time, that is. Wonderful and Delicious recipe. The only thing I changed was instead of adding the powdered sugar (sprinkled) to the top, I thought a glaze would do better as it would stick to the bread, unlike the sugar which would fall every time I moved and or cut the bread. This is definitely a keeper!
