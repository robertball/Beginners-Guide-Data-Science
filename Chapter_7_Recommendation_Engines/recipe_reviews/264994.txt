I love me some wings and this one didn't disappoint. They are a little bit more work due to the extra step but it is well worth it. They get that nice grilled flavor while releasing some of their juices which makes the sauce stay on them in round two. This is an excellent recipe/method and one worth trying.

Love this recipe!! I make another round of the sauce and after the wings have come off the grill the second time, I toss them in the sauce again. So delicious!! Thanks!!
