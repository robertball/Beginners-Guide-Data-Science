This chutney/salsa was fabulous!  Perfect complement to the curried meat.  My kids won't touch fish with a ten foot pole so we substituted it with butterflied chicken breast.  Equally fabulous!  Make sure you get a quality curry paste!  I will use the chutney/salsa for other dishes as well.  I would even use it as a salsa for tortilla chips.

Yay - another great way to do salmon! I used white nectarines and black plums with the blueberries and cut out the red onion because I don't care for it raw. I also added about 1/2 cup of coconut milk to the curry paste and lime juice - mostly because I needed to use it. Excellent! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Good and interesting recipe. But curry taste was a little overpowering.

MINE WAS NOT GOOD! I USED THAI RED CURRY PASTE AND DID NOT REMOVE MARINADE. MAYBE THIS WAS THE WRONG TYPE OF CURRY, MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE REMOVED CURRY PASTE. I MAKE FRUIT SALSAS ALL THE TIME WITH FRESH JALAPENOS BUT DIDN'T HAVE ANY AND COULD NOT FIND MY CAYANNE. I USED HABANERO AND IT WAS A LITTLE WARM BUT IT DID HELP COVER THE TASTE OF THE FISH. I WOULD RATE THIS "0" STARS IF YOUR SYSTEM WOULD LET ME.

Delicious!  I think a curried mango pineapple chutney would pair very well with this and add that extra hint of sweetness I thought this needed.  I made a side of saag paneer and it was a beautiful compliment to the curried salmon.

I thought it was good with the raw onion.
