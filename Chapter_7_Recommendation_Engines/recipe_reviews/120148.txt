This was an awesome recipe. The only thing I did different was bake the brown/wild rice instead of cooking it on the stovetop. I took 1 1/2 cups of a brown rice/wild rice mixture and put it in a 8x8 baking dish. Preheat oven to 375. Bring 2 1/2 cups water or chicken broth to a boil on the stovetop and add to the rice in the baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 60 minutes. The rice will come out perfect every time! Then I added the almonds and used dried cranberries. It was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

I registered here just to rate this recipe! This side dish stole the whole show! The disk looks lovely and the texture and taste are wonderful! It was even good cold the next day right out of the fridge.

 
Brown rice and wild are so much better for you than white rice, but I'll admit I like white rice better. So my husband and I usually eat brown rice but I can't say we ever absolutely loved it. I was very happy to find a recipe for a healthier dressed up rice that makes us want to eat it every day!


I didn't have any golden raisins on hand so I used the regular variety. I also cut all the butter from the recipe substituting a little more chicken stock, and just used a sparse amount to saut√© the almonds. Next time I'll prolly use a little EVOO to do that.

I would definitely recommend this side dish!

This side dish is loaded with flavor.  The sweetness from the raisins and crunch from the almonds went well with the honey baked ham I served for Christmas dinner.  No need to use two saucepans for the wild and brown rice, though.  Just put all the liquid in one pan, add the wild rice, then 20 minutes later add the brown.  I made it about an hour before serving, so undercooked it slightly, left it on the warming burner and in an hour all liquid was absorbed.  Delicious!

Very nice, but could use a little more spice or kick. I cut the butter use in half, and it still turned out nice. I would suggest roasting the almonds instead of sauteing them to save on fat grams.

I've been eating brown rice for 25 years because it's good for me. With this recipe, now I'll eat brown rice because I like it! The broth, almonds, raisins, and parsley combine to give this pilaf a great taste, and the crunch of the almonds and chewiness of the raisins lend a lot of textural interest. I had no slivered almonds, so I used whole, rough chopped; will probably do that again for the extra texture. I give 5 stars for this contribution, because it's also a snap to make. Thanks for sharing, Mark!

Easy to make and tasted yummy.   I'd follow the original instruction on the package on how to cook the wild rice.  My wild rice could be aready mixed with some bron rice....  The original instuction used the only 1/2 of broth to cook.  So the rice turned out too soft with this recipe's broth amount.  I wasted the first one and made the 2nd time with the original instruction for the wild rice.  Then followed the rest of this recipe.  It turned out pretty good!

The only change I made was to add extra golden raisins -- an excellent suggestion from another reviewer.  I was a little worried about this recipe because it seemed a little soupy, but I poured it into a casserole dish and took it on a camping trip.  It stayed overnight in the RV fridge and the next day at dinner I warmed it through in the oven.  It was PERFECT.  Fluffy and light, with lots of flavor (and I was glad I added those extra raisins!).  This is a terrific make-ahead side dish.  THANKS!

I have made this several times and everytime it STEALS the show! This rice is addictive! You wouldn't think you'd like it, given the raisins and almonds...but as my sister said when she tasted it (and gobbled it up):

"It tastes like happy!"

I made this for supper tonight and it is delicious!! I just made it in my rice cooker. I just threw 1 cup of brown/wild rice mix, 2 1/2 cups chicken broth and some chopped mushrooms into the cooker and hit go and 30 minutes later perfect rice! I then added the almonds (which I roasted in the oven sprinkled with some cinnamon). I didn't use any butter and I omitted the raisins and it was fabulous :)

This worked out surprisingly well for us, given that Hubs doesn't like wild rice and I don't care for brown.   Mixing it up seemed to do the trick. I wasn't keen on the idea of the golden raisins, so I just stuck with the almonds.  Overall, this had a kind of nutty flavor that worked out well with "Marinated Scallops Wrapped in Bacon,"  and "Spring Asparagus Salad," both recipes also from this website.

This was delicious.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I love wild rice and the sweetness of the cranberries and the toasted almonds was a great addition.

Very nice side dish!  My first experience with wild rice and I was impressed.  Will be making this again  and I may try with cranberries to make it even prettier!  Thanks for sharing.

This is ridiculously delicious recipe! We couldn't find wild rice at our grocery store, but did find a mix that had brown rice and wild rice in one bag. We ended up cooking the mix according to the instructions on the package...except that we used chicken broth instead of water. We sauteed the almonds in a bit of olive oil and then tossed the drained golden raisins, almonds and parsley into the cooked rice when it was done. I left out the salt and pepper inadvertently, but thought it tasted great without. Everyone wants this recipe!

I just loved this! I went looking for the wild rice at the store and could not find a package of just wild rice! I ended up purchasing a gourmet blend of wild and whole grain brown rice. Since I didn't want to make 10 servings, I just used 1 cup of the gourmet rice mix and 2 cups of the chicken broth. I sauteed a small onion in a Tbs. of butter and then added it to the rice to cook with it~ It wasn't necessary to add any more butter to the rice at this point. I soaked 1/2 cup of chopped Craisins and some chopped raisins together with 1/2 cup of chicken broth and added it to the rice after it finished cooking. I browned 1/2 cup  slivered almonds in about 1/2 Tbs. butter and then let them drain on a paper towel before adding to the rice. I almost forgot the parsley, but something told me to taste a little with a bite of the rice. When I did, I decided not to add it to the rest as I thought that the uncooked parsley tasted too strong. This may be the reason why some people are turned off by this recipe. I was very happy with the end result of this recipe and I do recommend you try it, but give the parsley a taste test before including it to your final dish!

Everyone absolutely loved this dish! I added a finely chopped small apple to the almonds while sauteing them in the butter, and I think it added a little extra moisture. Its a pretty flexible recipe I think, next time I want to try pecans instead (or together with) the almonds.

Took this to my bible study group and it was a big hit.  As someone suggested, I cooked a 1.5 c 1/2 & 1/2 brown and wild rice combo in the oven at 375 for an hour.  I also substituted craisins for the golden raisins.  It went great with the rotisserie chicken main course.

As others have said -- this is a spectacular side.  I made this last weekend for an annual gathering of my partner's best friends from childhood.  It was a huge hit...slight variations made here were sour cherries and craisons.  I served it with a pork loin roast with an apple-butter crust and roasted root vegetables. I love to send dinner guests home with leftovers and even though I made the 10 serving size (for 5 people), not too much to go around for seconds!  Add this to the menus -- its easy and quite delish!

YUM!  This is a delicious recipe!  I did make a few changes...the grocery store I went to did not have plain wild rice so I used to a boxed premade version of long grain brown and wild rice.  It already had chicken seasoning in it, so I omitted the broth and just used the amount of water the box states instead.  I also sauteed onions and mushrooms first, then added the rice mix, raisins, and water.  Stirred in the almonds and parsley before serving.  Was ready in 30 minutes preparing it this way and is seriously good!  Looking forward to serving it for Christmas Eve dinner tonight!

I made this rice as a side dish to beef tenderloin during Christmas dinner.  It was a hit and accompanied the beef very well.  I cut down on the butter and used dried cranberries instead of raisins for color.  It turned out perfect.  Will definitely make this again!

Very easy and very elegant dish suitable for company.  I served it with Procuitto wrapped chicken breasts stuffed with herbed goat cheese on the BBQ.  It was great.

Taking this as a side dish to our gourmet club dinner tonight.  It is so pretty! Used craisins rather than golden raisins. Added 1/2 c each of finely chopped celery and carrots.  It definitely passed the taste test at home! Will also use for Christmas dinner.

This is a great dish!  I wouldn't have thought to cook the different kinds of rice for different times, but that worked out well.  I didn't use raisins, but I added some chopped green onions and mushrooms to the simmering rice and it was quite yummy.  One thing to be careful of is browning the almonds too much (i.e. don't get distracted on facebook while they're cooking), but they weren't burnt.  I paired this with some breaded orange chicken breasts, and it made a great combination, as well as yummy leftovers for the next few days!

This was good but kind of bland. I added garlic & onion salt and that helped. 
But the next day, I took the leftover rice and mixed it with leftover broccoli and chicken. I sauteed some celery and onion and microwaved a few slices of bacon. I mixed all of it together with a can of cream of mushroom soup and some milk and it was deeeeelishhh!

very delicious!! I was looking for a recipe like this because we love a version that a  Greek restaurant serves and this is very close. 
I  only made a few changes to get the rice they way they serve it. Iused fresh dill instead of parsley, regular raisins, olive oil instead of butter, and added feta cheese. YUMMMY!

This is seriously delicious and elegant and a new staple for me. Add extra golden raisins, they make the dish.

This was amazing!  My husband is not usually a fan of brown/wild rice, but he said "This is company good!".  Personally, I could eat this for breakfast.

This was amazing! Just finished preparing for romantic evening dinner, along with salmon fillets. I did change a couple of things, so I could use what was at hand. Instead of the golden raisins, I had a dried fruit combo from Trader Joe's called "Super Cranberry and Pomegranate Blend", which included dried raspberries, cherries and black currants. Along with that just 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley from our garden and toasted, chopped pecans instead of the almonds. This is the best wild rice dish I have ever tasted! Can't wait to try it again with the wild duck breasts in my freezer.

I had high hopes based on the other reviews.  I think the recipe is a good base, however we found it lacking in flavor, even with the broth, parsley, etc.  I had to add salt three times and we are generally a low salt family.

The brown and wild rice can be cooked together, and I'm not sure it needs all the butter.  Next time I will put in less butter with the rice and use more to brown the almonds, I love the browned butter/almond flavor.  I did not use the raisins because I was serving it with fish.  The fish was baked with chopped tomato, onion, cilantro, and lime juice.  The rice was fabulous mixed with the fish dish.

This is a delightful dish to use as a side to any dinner serving some kind of poultry. In fact, you can stuff this stuff into a bird and make a rice-stuffing and it won't ONLY turn out great, but it will flavor the bird and keep it moist and tender. This dish is healthy and full of fiber and things that make your body happy, including your tongue!

Other than cutting the recipe in half for two of us and limiting the amount of butter, I followed the recipe.  This was the response from my dining partner:  "I hope there's a lot left."  Caution - carefully watch the almonds.  They scorch easily and if they get too dark brown, it's gross. (been there done that)

Sweet rice with a very crunchy texture from the almonds. Maybe next time I'd use less almonds. We used the wild rice/brown rice combo because we could not find any wild rice that was plain. Was a good side dish to our honey chicken.

I don't know what I'm missing, but my husband and I did not like this AT ALL.  The only change I made was to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins.  It is also a bit pricey for a side dish once you purchase the wild rice, almonds, and, in my case, dried cranberies, so I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone on a budget.  It makes quite a lot, and it was all wasted because we just did not like it enough to eat it.

The chewy texture of this rice was good but it could have used a flavor other than nutty.  I'll make it again but I'll make a few changes.

I just feel the need to chime here - after all the great reviews, I had to try this dish.  But it was a disappointment for me and my boyfriend.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't bad, but it just lacked "oomph".  It was kind of boring, and a waste of wild rice.

WONDERFUL RECIPE FOR WILD RICE...I TOASTED THE ALMONDS FOR AN ADDITIONAL CRUNCH AND SPRINKLED THEM ON TOP. IT WAS EVEN TASTIER THE NEXT DAY AS THE RAISINS ADDED A MORE SUBTLE FLAVOR!

Very easy to make. I thought it needed a bit more sweetness than the raisins alone imparted. Originally, I added a tablespoon of sugar and that helped a bit. I will reheat the leftover tonight with cooked Granny Smith apple slices caramelized with butter and sugar. I think that will achieve the taste and texture I am looking for.

pretty good.  makes a lot.  I doubled the almonds, because they are yummy!  doesn't call for too much butter, but I think it could be left out completely and still taste really good. (just to be really healthy)

WOW super awesome... a great tasting recipe... i didn't have golden raisins so i used normal and it turned out great... I also cut back on the butter by about half and it was still plenty moist... might have been better with more butter... but i didn't personally miss it... another idea to make it a true Wisconsin dish is throw in dried cranberries instead of raisins... great recipe though everyone loved it...

Yes it tastes great but what I love most about this recipe is that it is so flexible. I've made it 4 times now and each time changed how I made it and they all turned out fabulous. I've used 2 different rice blends, it seems it works with almost anything. I've used a little or a lot of nuts and both ways are great. I've also baked in in a casserole when my oven was on anyway and used the stove top when I didn't want to heat up my oven. Both were great. So have fun and enjoy!

This recipe was pretty good.  It was missing something, but I'm not sure what.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  What I learned was you can cook the brown and wild rice together in one pot and it doesn't need that much butter.  My family did like the rice, so I gave it 4 stars, but I'll only make it again if I can come up with something to add to it.  I do think it would be great as a stuffing.

Loved this recipe!  Used a Wild Rice mix from Costco and currants instead of raisins (because that's what I had).  Also, cooked the rice in a rice cooker to make it easy.  Add some chicken and it's a meal.

Amazing! I made this for Christmas dinner along with a rosemary apricot pork tenderloin.  While everyone enjoyed the pork, this rice was the clear masterpiece of the evening.  I also added some dried cranberries that I had left over from the pork recipes.

I bought a brown/wild rice blend (wild rice is EXPENSIVE!), and followed the directions on the bag in cooking it, which means I didn't need the full 5 1/2 cups of broth.  It turned out great - served it with cranberry chicken at a dinner party, and people could not stop talking about it.  Next time I will add some more golden raisins and some green onion/shallot.    As far as leftovers are concerned, follow the other tips here and add a little broth or water to it before heating, otherwise it gets really dried out.  Overall, though - a great side dish!!!

Excellent (with substitutions) I don't like raisins so I used cranraisins.  This really gave the rice a punch of flavor.  I also spiced up my  broth for the rice.  The dish took longer than quoted due to the rice cooking times.  Cook both rices to correct consistancy.  My brown rice came out a bit mushy, but everyone LOVED the rice at my dinner party.  It was great as a left over too.  I even ate it cold on a spring mix salad.  It was super!

Superb.  I made two alterations: I substituted craisins for the raisins, and then as I prepared it, I thought it needed one more ingredient for another flavor, texture, and color.  I diced a Pink Lady apple and added it at the end, and that was the perfect touch.  My husband kept saying " good rice" as he took more and more.

Great recipe! Loved it, but had to use organic raisins because that was all I had in the house. I will try with golden raisins next time and it may be better with those because they are plumper. Husband hates raisins and still ate this:)

This recipe makes a lot!  I could have easily halved the recipe for a dinner party of six.  I used half golden raisins and half dried cranberries.  It added a little more color to the presentation.  Our company loved the rice.  My husband was so impressed when he realized it was a "from scratch" recipe.  Kids weren't so crazy about it, but that's because they don't care for nuts and berries...they would prefer Rice A Roni. :)

This dish is delicious!!!  I brought it to a Thanksgiving potluck and my friends are still raving about it.  So yummy.  I made it the night before and heated it up in the microwave on a low setting - you can add more chicken broth, if reheating dries it out.  The only change I made was to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins (because I forgot to buy them), but other than that, I made it as-is and it was fantastic.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  I'll be making it again soon.

Excellent recipe.  Exchanged the brown rice for basmati rice. Did not use as much butter as it called for.  Sprayed pan to brown almonds.  The excess broth from the wild rice, I saved for another recipe.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was not very good.  I thought the taste of the raisins with the chicken broth was not that great.  My husband didn't think it was that bad but nothing to rave about.  Would not make again.

This recipe is fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was eliminate the butter for the dish, and instead used a tiny bit of oil to help toast the almonds.  Oh, and since broth has quite a bit of salt already, I didn't add any further salt.  Thanks for sharing!  It is now on my weekly side dish list.

I found this recipe when looking for a dish to take to a Thanksgiving feast.  It was the hit of the day, and I've made it many times since, BUT I made substitutions from the beginning. I replaced golden raisins with dried cranberries and they are awesome. The color is fabulous and the flavor just a little tangy. I also replaced almonds with pine-nuts because it was Thanksgiving and I wanted to stick with new world foods. Acting on the new world foods principle,  I frequently replace the brown rice with quinoa, but also like the brown rice version. Everyone loves this dish.

We love this recipe at my house. It goes perfectly with salmon and is great for leftovers. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I think the recipe as is has too much butter, you can cut it by at least 2 TBS. The chicken broth is optional, I just use water. I also add mushrooms and saute with the almonds.

I expected more flavor. Chicken flavored rice again. Even the toasted almonds couldn't elevate this beyond Rice-a-Roni. I will keep this as a starting point. Maybe cranberries instead of raisins, maybe some bulk sausage. Don't know, but I won't give up.

Very tasty, but will increase the golden raisins by 50% next time I make it- they tended to get lost among all the nutty goodness!

This dish is outstanding!  I've never been much of a brown rice fan, but this rice has converted me.  The first time I made it, I followed it as is using 1/2 the recipe.  The second time I made it for a dinner party using the full 10 serving recipe, I sauteed finely chopped celery and carrots (about 1/2 cup each) and used vegetable boullion, and it was incredible.

I'm not a big rice lover, I'm just trying to eat healthier, I cut the butter down, also used half applesauce in place and this was delicious.  Even better than the unhealthy stuff I 'thought' I was gonna be missing!!!  THANKS!

I doubled the recipe and served this as a side dish for a large dinner party.  I prepared it a few hours in advance and kept it warm in a crock pot.  It turned out wonderful and I got many compliments.  I will be making this again!

This was very good. I did exchange cranberries for raisins. However, i think i added too much nut...BF didn't like all the nuts. I thought it was still good. Guess that's what i get for not measuring the nuts.

This is a great recipe.  I will definitely have this again.  I made one serving and kept to the recipe as much as possible, except I did not use wild rice and I used 1/4 cup of brown rice.  I had this with ‚ÄúBroiled Tilapia Parmesan‚Äù and a garden salad.

This has got to be the best side dish ever!  I could eat this as a meal by itself.  Used craisins instead of the raisins and it was beautiful!
