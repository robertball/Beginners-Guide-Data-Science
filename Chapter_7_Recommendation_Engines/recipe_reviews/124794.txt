I really wanted to like this recipe...the idea of honey vs. sugar was really appealing to me! I don't know if I did something wrong, but when the cookies actually baked, something happened to the rice krispies (there are a LOT of rice krispies in this dough!!!) that made them absorb the moisture and turn really hard and chewy, to the point of being inedible (somewhat akin to stale hard candy). My kids (major cookie lovers!) each took two bites, then spent the next few minutes picking rock-hard krispies out of their teeth and ended up throwing the rest out. I had to agree with them, and tossed the remainder of the dough after one batch because no one wouldn't go near another one - a first for me with home baked cookies! I had high hopes because the dough itself before baking tasted FABULOUS (usually a sign of a good cookie recipe!), but the krispies just didn't hold up with the baking process for us. I hope others have better luck than we did with the end result, because the concept of the recipe is great!

We loved these cookies, they were just delightful. I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used chopped dates( an unlikely substitution, but it was lovely!) I also added a box of vanilla pudding powder which added a nice flavor. The rice crispies did go a little hard, but I didn't mind that to be honest. I'm always looking for recipes that call for honey instead of refined sugar, and this recipe did not disappoint!

I liked this recipe.  I love the butterscotch taste but the coconut and lots of rice krispies made it kind of chewy.  I made these for the county fair last year and got a blue ribbon.

I really wanted to like these. I used oil instead of butter and that may have been a mistake but all I could taste was honey after they were baked and they were a weird orange color. I think I'll try it again but with sugar because the other elements were great.

A delightful and delicious cookie!  They remind me of "Skywalker Crunchies" that my brother used to make all the time when we were growing up.  The honey provides such a different taste (in a good way) and mixes beautifully with the coconut and butterscotch chips.  I used 3 cups of rice crispies and that was perfect.  Yum!

I think I figured out the trick to this.  My first pan browned very quickly on the bottom so I switched to an insulated baking sheet.  (I have an oven thermometer so I know it wasn't the temperature.)  I also doubled the amount of dough per cookie and flattened them with my (clean, I promise!) fingers before baking.  They turned out great.  I love the honey flavor to the dough.  I'm trying to figure out what other stir-ins might be good with it to make another version.  I do really like the coconut and butterscotch version too.  The rice krispies were chewier before they cooled.  They do stick in your  teeth a little :) but not to the point of being a big deal.  the first batch was for a bake sale.  I'm making another batch for cub scouts tonight.  I may reduce the amount of rice krispies a little this time and see how that is but I like them.  These are very good and a nice change of pace from the usual.  Thanks for sharing them.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a recipe that used honey.  I don't think I will make this again and if I do, I think they would do better baked in one pan as bars rather than individual cookies.

I used white chocolate instead of butterscotch and used unsweetened coconut and these came out delightful! I brought them to work and they went fast.

These cookies have great flavor. They are more of a biscuit like cookie, not a traditional cookie, so if that is something you like then definitely make these. I did not find them too chewy at all and I think the flavor combinations really compliment each other. We will probably make these again.
