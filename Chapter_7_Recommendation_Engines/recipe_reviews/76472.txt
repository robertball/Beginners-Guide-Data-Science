This recipe ended up in my RB on a lark. I suggested it when we were praying Hurricane Earl would not touch our friends on the East Coast. I decided to give it a whirl for my Labor Day ribs. OMG!! The family inhaled them!!! The sauce as written was just way too much, so I did as one reviewer suggested and just dumped all the ingreds in a bowl on a smaller scale. This sauce is Sweet N Tangy!! After you start eating the ribs with this sauce, it gets gradually hotter. It ROCKS!!  My new favorite sauce:) Can not Thank You enough CarolinaDarlin:):) I wish I could Breathe this sauce instead of air. LOL

I made this recipe to put on a smoked Boston Butt.  I think it tastes great, maybe a little less sugar next time. Great thickness and not too much tomato flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Good base recipe but tweak a little and IMHO better.  I use half cup of dark brown sugar instead of any white sugar.  1 tsp worchestire sauce and then follow the rest of directions.

I made some pulled pork that was a little plain and I was looking for a quick fix so I tried this.  The quantity is WAY more than I needed so I just squirted a little ketchup in a bowl and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't put in the butter because the quantity was so small and I didn't have any hot sauce plus I don't like things too spicy.  I didn't even cook the sauce because I was in a hurry but the ketchup/vinegar/sugar/pepper flakes combo was just what I was looking for.  I'm sure it tastes even better if you follow the recipe.

A good sauce, but not technically North Carolina Sauce. Western NC sauces are more thin, like a dipping sauce, and rarely have this much sugar and Eastern NC sauce has NO tomato products (the originators thought tomato was poisonous!). As a NC native, I think this is closer to a St. Louis glaze.

Made this sauce but did change the 1 cup of white sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I like the taste of brown sugar over white.  I did ribs in the oven using this sauce, turned out very good.
