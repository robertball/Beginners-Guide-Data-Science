I found this recipe at the last minute and couldn't find the Mascarpone cheese. I used 8 oz. of cream cheese instead and it was absolutely delicious!!  Very thick and rich!!

Fantastic dish. . . The sauce is rich and has a perfectly sweet and subtle taste that compliments this seafood pasta dish. I added diced onion to the vegetables and upped the amount of asparagus and mushrooms, which is recommended. And if possible, add some shredded salmon on top of the pasta before placing the scallops and sauce on top as is seen in my photo for this recipe. It was a delicious idea that worked magnificently. . .

YOM YOM! I made lots of changes to this recipe out of practicality/$$. I halved it because I was trying to use up 4 oz of mascarpone. I subbed bay scallops in for regular (cheaper and better IMO). I subbed broccoli for asparagus (cheaper and also delicious). I subbed rotini noodles for shells because I had those on hand. Excellent recipe!

WOW WOW WOW!  This was amazing!  My store was out of mascarpone cheese so I used 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 heavy cream, and 3tbsp sour cream... it makes more sauce and I highly suggest it!  I used 2 garlic cloves instead of one and used Farfalle pasta instead.  Amazing and delicious!  Top with some parmesan cheese and you are good to go!  SUCH a tasty meal!  I also tried a reviewer's suggestion and added some flaked salmon on top!  PERFECTION!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was very good and simple to make.  I did add extra garlic,asparagus, and mascarpone cheese, and topped it with freshly grated romano (parmesan would work too; any salty, grated cheese) and smoked salmon to contrast with the sweetness of the scallops and sauce.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  What an interesting way to use mascarpone.  I made the recipe exactly as written except found that 16 oz. of pasta seemed like way too much.  I probably only put about 10 oz. in and we felt that was just right.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  Absolutely delicious!  After reading some reviews I used 8oz of cream cheese instead & made a little less pasta.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was great!

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  GREAT way to make a more stable "creamy" sauce.  Only change I made was using fresh onions instead of powder, and adding some shrimp!

I was really looking forward to making this.  We had 6 gorgeous bacon wrapped scallops, and that made the prep different, as we had to spend a bit more time browning the bacon around them.   All in all, it was tasty, just wasn't knock us out of the park for the investment.

Superb. All of the ingredients blend together so well. I prepared this as written with two minor alterations. I cooked the scallops in the butter sauce prior to cooking the asparagus and mushrooms as I didn't have a pan large enough to add the scallops after the veggies and hope to brown them. Just not enough room in my pans. And, it turned out very well. Also, I cut back about a third on the pasta. I will say that the mascarpone cheese is a MUST for the full effect of the blend. You really must try all you can to find some. It comes out very buttery and the recipe's main ingredients are each naturally complemented by butter. Without a doubt the best scallop dish I've ever had.

Another flexible recipe. I used Shitake mushrooms, chopped sweet onion, extra garlic and dried parsley. Fat free milk worked fine.  A little parmesan and a hand full of sharp cheddar made a great sauce. Mascarpone goes with prawns as well.  I decreased the whole wheat spiral pasta to about 10 oz. Impress company with this elegant meal.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. I used 4oz of mascarpone, because that was all I had. No salt or onion powder. Put in shrimp, turkey bacon and asparagus. I liked the flavour that the turkey bacon added. I would make this again.

This turned out very well. The reason I'm only giving 4 stars rather than 5 is because it called for way to much pasta! I only added half the amount of pasta and still it was a bit to much for me.  I used 1/2 pound scallops and added shrimp to make up the difference.  The sauce was very good. Only thing I would do different is cut back a bit more on pasta and add a few more vegetables such as red peppers, broccoli etc.

This was really rich and delicious.  Even though I used a very large sautee pan, the scallops would not have fit with the asparagus and mushrooms, so I set aside and cooked the scallops by themselves.  And I know in Italian cooking, you're not supposed to add parmesan to seafood dishes, but I thought it needed it.  Also sprinkled a little fresh parsley... and served with sauteed spinach w/ garlic & onion.  It looked and tasted great!

I had all the ingredients handy except the mascarpone, so I used Fontina instead. Also left out the mushrooms. I found that the asparagus took more than twice as long as the recipe suggested. Regardless, I give 5 stars because it was REALLY good! I'm eating some leftovers as I type this!

This is excellent.  I could not get mascarpone cheese and mixed the following as recommended by a recipe elsewhere on this site - mix 1-8 oz cream cheese with 1/4 c. heavy cream and 2T butter.  This works well in place of the mascarpone.  I also added a diced onion with the mushrooms and left out the onion powder.  I used broccoli instead of asparagus due to the time of year.  This is really good!

Sooo...GOOD! Sinfully rich. We all need a treat like this ones in a while. I suggest eating a salad for lunch if you're planning to make this recipe for dinner though  ;)

So delicious, pretty fast, and very easy!

I doubled the amount of parsley and added parmesean to the sauce, as someone suggested.  I also used cream cheese instead of mascarpone.  

The sauce was so amazing that even our toddler devoured an entire bowl, including the asparagus!  He ate the asparagus!! Woo hoo!

I would definitely make this for company and will certainly make it again at home!

This was good as written, but not quite worth the 38 grams of fat per serving.  It was too rich for me but my husband liked it a lot.

I loved this recipe, the basic concept is a truly nice dish...The marscarpone comes in an 8 oz. tub by the way in case you are searching the isles for a block of cheese. I substituted whole grain, whole wheat medium shells, added more parsley and about a 1/2 cup of garlic and went heavy on adding the fresh parmesan. I truly loved this dish.

This was really good. I ended up going with the 8oz package of mascarpone, about four (maybe more) tablespoons of sour cream and a good 1/4-1/2 cup of heavy cream to make the sauce. This was SO delicious.

Also, in addition to the asparagus, I made tiny little broccoli pieces and added those as well. 

I will make this again and again...BIG HIT! Oh oh, and I used two pounds of baby scallops because I find regular scallops to be too big for a meal like this and very expensive.

Loved this recipe. The flavor was great, but could maybe use a little bit more kick. I added a bit of cilantro which really added another dimension, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Changes for next time: less pasta if not a different kind and more spice (as I said)...and I might add something else like another type of seafood. Still, this straight recipe is certainly a keeper and I will be trying it again!

Wow, what a decadent tasting meal! Did not have mascarpone, so following advice of others, I had to wing it on the sauce. I used sour cream, 1/2 and 1/2 and milk. When that was mixed and simmering, I added the parmesan cheese right into that and melted it. Hubby won't eat mushrooms so excluded those. Used 1/2 bag of egg noodle dumplings and that was the perfect amount of pasta. This was so great! My husband wouldn't eat the asparagus, so I got doubles on that. ;) Thanks Andy for a great recipe.

I gave this recipe a 4 instead of 5 only because the sauce was bland. I added a pinch of nutmeg, salt and a few hot pepper flakes to it. It helped.  I'm wondering; has anyone tried adding a splash of white wine to it? I really thought that was all that would be needed but I was concerned it would curdle it.  I added a little flax seed meal to the sauce as well, but that's only b/c I knew you wouldn't be able to taste it. (Hey, I do what I have to do to counteract the junk food my husband puts in is system! ha)  I substituted whole wheat pasta for the white. Again, the hubs didn't know the difference, although I could tell.   Safeway had a great sale on colossal shrimp so I cut them up the size of scallops.   I'd love to know if anyone has cut back on the butter and how it tasted.  The dish was delicious and I wouldn't want to lose the flavor that the butter gives it.  I will make this again! Thank you for sharing it.

Really delicious.  Next time I will cook the scallops in a separate pan (my pan was crowded and I don't think it was hot enough when I added them) just for ease of preparation.  Great recipe.

This was pretty good, my only complaint being that it called for way, way too much pasta.  I hardly got a chance to taste anything else.

Quite tasty... only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm not a huge fan of scallops but my husband is a fish monger and brought home a bunch of broken scallops that they couldn't sell.  So this is what I ended up making with them and it was good.  My oldest son absolutely loved it!

Yum Yum Yum! Scallops Mascarpone is wonderful...I usually have trouble making homemade white sauces because they are not creamy...I can say that this was super creamy and delicious. I added a little parmesan cheese in with the sauce to give it a little zing. And a tiny bit of flour to thicken it a little. My fiance told me that this was THE BEST white sauce for pasta he has ever had. Thank you Andy for this delicious recipe! It is going in my handwritten recipe book, where only the best of the best go! Yum!

Yum!  Made a few alterations for convenience, like using ready-minced garlic, dried parsley, fresh baby bella mushrooms, fresh chopped onion, fresh bell peppers instead of asparasgus, and cream cheese instead of marscarpone.  Also added a little parmesan.  
A winner!

I had an almost full tub of mascarpone hence why I made this recipe. I always read the reviews before making any dish on this great site. Most people loved this and didn't change a thing so I jumped right in. I thought while making it, it was going to be a little flat in the flavour department but it really didn't disappoint! We loved it!  Only change was adding onion instead of onion power and reduced the amount of pasta as suggested by many reviewers and made it with angel hair pasta. Will make again and again!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I liked the recipe however I will try it with low-fat cream cheese next time being as the calorie and fat content of the mascarpone cheese is  very high.  I I think the splash of white wine in the sauce would also make it little more flavorful.
I served it with homemade pasta and it was delicious.

Wow was this tasty !!! Easy to make too. The only changes I made were using Tilapia instead of scallops (not a fan) and changed out the asparagus to red and yellow peppers. Scrumptious !!!

I had some mascarpone to use up after making a tiramisu, but I only had 4 ounces. Plus, I figured it's such a high fat cheese, this dish could use a little lightening. So in addition to the 4oz. mascarpone, I used an ounce of fat free cream cheese, an ounce of light sour cream, and a quarter cup of fat free half and half. I used skim milk as well. And I was sad when I realized I was out of scallops, so I used 1/2 lb small shrimp with great success. And I love asparagus, but didn't have any so I substituted with a cup of steamed and shredded broccoli. 
I cut down the butter significantly as well, using only 1 tablespoon (margarine) in which to simmer the shrimp. I didn't use oil at all. I only had garlic powder on hand, but had fresh basil and parsley that I used, and I also ground up 2 tsp dried rosemary into the sauce. 
Even with the lightened ingredients, this was very rich and delicious. I don't typically keep mascarpone on hand, but I will be making this again, but I'll use reduced fat cream cheese in place of the mascarpone, probably with the proportions being 3 ounces reduced fat cream cheese, 2 ounces fat free cream cheese, and the same amounts of light sour cream and half and half. And I'll have to try this with scallops too, as I like them better than shrimp in general. I may need to use the oil for searing as instructed, but we'll see. Also, this is suited for just 8 ounces of pasta (I used whole wheat penne as I had no shells... bowties would have been fun too!).

This recipe is delicious.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I added onions instead and they were wonderful with the asparagus.  I also had to use cream cheese instead of mascarpone.  I added about 1/2 cup of shredded parmesean cheese to that mixture too.  It was so creamy and delicious, I will definitely try this one again.

With such high reviews, I had high expectations. I found the sauce to be quite bland and not worth the extraordinarily high fat content so I ended up just having carmelized scallops on their own which was wonderful. This sauce is like an unflavorful version of fettuccine... Not recommended.

Yummy!!! I just made this, but used light cream cheese instead of Mascarpone (1/3 of the price) and added red pepper to the mix, organic white mushrooms and shitake mushrooms and lots of garlic (@ 4-5 cloves)...added health benefits and enhanced taste - Be careful not to overcook the scallops though, as I did a little (6 min max) - I also used extra virgin coconut oil instead of the olive oil as it is by far a healthier choice for cooking - you should avoid cooking with olive oil, and many others, as it becomes toxic when heated - grapeseed oil is another healthy oil that is safe for cooking/frying.    My kids and husband love it (who are all picky eaters)!

WONDERFUL! I have been trying to think of a way to cook a bag of frozen scallops had on hand and this was absolutely delicious! Have made it twice already... First time with sauteed red onion, red pepper, pinon nuts, mushrooms and olives (instead of asparagus) and the second time with broccoli and cream cheese instead of mascarpone.  I'm just not a big fan of asparagus. Both times was very very good, excellent for special occasions or company. Will be making this often!

This is a great recipe for scallops.  I cook the scallops in butter and evoo first to get a nice color on them and then add them in with everything else at the end.  In addition to marscarpone, I also add some cream cheese to the sauce for a little extra flavor, and I use fresh broccoli instead of asparagus (just because it's what I've had on hand each time I've made this).  I'm a novice with scallops and I'm really glad I found this recipe because now I can make a meal out of them and not just an appetizer!  Thanks!

Wow!  Absolutely delicious.  I did make some modifications - I doubled the recipe but instead of using 16oz of mascarpone, I used 8oz mascarpone + 8oz neufchatel cream cheese.  I also used shrimp and 2 cloves of crushed fresh garlic and left out the asparagus.  Served it with garlic spinach on the side and it was gobbled up.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I used corn peas and carrots and cream cheese with cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have the cheese they asked for it was just fine. Next time I'll try to brown scallop better.

I liked this recipe a lot, but had to add a few seasonings to spice things up just a bit.  It needs a little more kick than it had with just the garlic and onion powder.

This was so delicious - we used shittake mushrooms and they ended up being the best part of the dish. Like other reviewers we found that there was no way the scallops were going to fit in the same pan with the veggies so we cooked them separately with no consequences.

Very good recipe, nice way to integrate some less common ingredients into the weekly menu. We topped with parmesean cheese.  Could have used a little more sauce, next time I'll increase the cheese and milk to get more sauce going.

Wow! This was great. Loved the asparagus in this as well.  Next time I'd substitute cream cheese for the mascarpone.  And I served it over a bed of brown rice medley for better carbs.  The family loved it.

I really liked this recipe. I had never made scallops before and was a bit weary but it turned out great. I tend to always have leftovers for my husband to take with him to work for lunch and he did state that this was not good the next day so be sure to make just enough.

Made to recipe and it came out terrific. Added an extra bunch of asparagus, made  two boxes of pasta and added just the right amount to recipe (w/plain pasta leftover for the kids-they're not old enough to appreciate a good scallop!). Stood and watched scallops cook-nothing worse than them being overcooked.Will definately make it again and will try and figure out how to cut out some of the butter without sacrificing the flavor. Enjoy!

What a great recipe! Would have never guessed it had Mascarpone Cheese in it! Made a few changes seeing I didnt have fresh parsley I just used dried basil and 3 cloves of garlic. I used bay scallops (the small ones) so they werent overwhelling in the dish. Then used heavy cream instead of milk. Kinda glad because I think it would have been too runny with milk. The taste is lite and full of flavor! Will make this a lot!

So easy and sooooo good! I added a little extra cheese to make the sauce a bit thicker. We loved it!

Yummy!  I would not have thought to put scallops in a creamy sauce, but this is excellent.  I used half the amount of butter and subbed 4ounces of cream cheese for the mascarpone.

Delicious!! very rich, great with warm crusty bread. I did not combine the sauce and noodles, personal preference. This could easily have been made with cream cheese as well, we also added a few more cloves of garlic, cuz we're garlic lovers! Everyone in the family ate it, so will definitely be making again!

Firstly,  skip the bay scallops...go with sea scallops...pretty much holds true for any recipe...!  Secondly, do cook the scallops separately from the veggies to get that nice golden brown sear.  Don't overcook the asparagus!  Very nice recipe...impress the guests!

This is great!  I even forgot to do the sauce separately and I added the sauce ingredients straight to the scallop pan.  It turned out fine.

This recipe is a keeper! The mushrooms and asparagus work great with the scallops and sauce. Creamy and very rich tasting. Would be good with shrimp or lobster instead of the scallops as well

I can't fairly rate the dish because I barely followed the recipe, but I have to hit stars to submit my comments. I made the butter/ olive oil, parsley and garlic, no onion powder. I added chopped kale, with no mushrooms or asparagus, added the bay scallops, covered, simmered, stirred till done. The cream sauce was milk, cream cheese, butter and sherry. It was DELICIOUS =)

Great flavor! I made a substitution with the pasta. Since I need whole wheat pasta, I used macaroni. I had it on hand. I also added about a 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan. Needed to use up my supply and thought it would go well. It did! One other change was made in the cooking order. A pound of scallops would be difficult to brown with the mushroom and asparagus in the way. After adding the garlic and parsley, I browned the scallops, removed them from the pan, THEN I threw in the veg and shroom. I put the scallops back in for the last couple of minutes before finishing with the cream sauce and pasta.

I made this and substituted spinach for asparagus because that's what I had that needed to be used. overall turned out great! very yummy. it's on the richer side due to the mascarpone so I definitely recommend using milk not cream. you could even add a little chicken stock to thin it out if needed. I would also use more garlic than is called for, and even sprinkle a little garlic salt in too if it still needs more flavor. overall great!

Followed the recipe for the most part. Used bow tie pasta and whole milk to be specific. Found the Mascarpone cheese at Trader Joes. Scallops came fresh from the ocean the day before :) Could have used more onion powder. Also cooked the scallops separately. Found the dish to be creamy delicious, and definitely hearty.

4 stars instead of 5 only because the 6 T. of butter called for is excessive, especially with additional butter in the sauce. I used just 2 T olive oil and 1 T butter, which was plenty and still flavorful.

Otherwise, this is a FABULOUS recipe!! It's easy to prepare, and it is a great mix of color and texture. The idea of using mascarpone cheese in a sauce was new to me, and is what caught my eye. It makes a creamy sauce that is rich, yet light -- brilliant! This recipe is a keeper -- it would be wonderful to make with other seafood, or even chicken or ham. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Andy!

I made this for my husbands birthday. I'd never made scallops before, but the recipe was super easy, and he LOVED it!.
If you have a Trader Joes in your area, I highly recommend using their Fresh cut & ready Diced Onions, Garlic & Shallots instead of just garlic. I also used the larger Sea Scallops, not bay scallops. I'm sure it would have been delish either way.
This recipe will definitely get be used again at our house.

This recipe was just ok. Like everyone else I made adjustments also with the masacapone I also added 4oz cream cheese, a little more onion power. I also added a tsp of garlic powder and a tbs old bay. Lastly I decided to use orzo pasta and omit the parsley just because I didn't have any.

Had some scallops in the freezer and needed a recipe. I was not disappointed in the slightest! My husband had three helpings.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (except I used veggie rotini), because that's what I do when I first try one out.  Tonight I'm making it again because my husband is asking for it and the only thing I plan on changing is adding a little more garlic and maybe dicing fresh onion instead of using the powder. Olive Garden eat your heart out, this recipe is fantastic!!

A new household favorite.  Looking forward to making it again.  The recipe is so versatile that you could add other veggies or meats (but I do LOVE the scallops and asparagus).  I cook gluten free, so made it with gf angle hair pasta.

I doubled the garlic, added some extra garlic powder and onion powerder. It was delicious, but I didn't put enough salt and, as other users have commented, some shredded salmon on top would have made this a perfect meal.

This was fabulous.  I made a few changes: Neufchatel cheese instead of mascarapone, at least 3 cloves of garlic, added green onion, and used bay scallops to save some cash (recipe didn't specify but I think it's for sea scallops).  I cooked veggies in a big skillet, added scallops the last couple minutes to cook, then added cheese/milk to skillet to melt and blend (tah dah - one pan not counting pasta :).  Tossed it all over the cooked shells and ate it up.  Will totally make again -think it would be tasty with a splash of white wine in the sauce and maybe lemon zest.  Might even change the veggies - I really like the versatility of this dish.

Terrific as written,  Quick, easy, and delicious.
Also, you can make lots of changes and it's still delicious.  Here are the changes I made tonight, mostly because of what I had on hand:

Goat cheese (instead of mascarpone);
Angel hair pasta;
Seared 3 small Tilapia (along with the Scallops);
Chopped Onion (instead of Onion Powder); 
5 Cloves Garlic (instead of just one); 
Fresh Cilantro (instead of Fresh Parsley);
No Salt added; used Unsalted Butter.

This was very tasty, but also VERY rich.  A glass of red wine with it is recommended for the arteries sake!  The changes I made were-I used the lower fat cream cheese instead of mascarpone and added a red bell pepper and used 3/4 of a box of pasta.  I'm going to reduce the amount of cream cheese next time and use more olive oil, maybe a little chichen broth so it isn't so heavy.

I guess I have to give it 4 as I substituted the fresh basil that I had for the Parsley.  Other than that I made it as directed (except using much less pasta)  and it was very very good -- I have no idea about actual fat vs. alfredo but I think this was a lot lower fat and just as tasty.  When I make it again I will use even less pasta and double the asparagus.

I took the suggestion of substituting cream cheese for Mascarpone. I used frozen broccoli, canned mushrooms, 1 tsp of dried parsley, and whatever pasta I could find in the pantry.  It still turned out delicious... even got a thumbs up from my picky 11 yr old son.

This was absolutely wonderful! I made enough for 6 and with only 3 of us, nothing was left. I kept the asparagus on the side. I added bacon (with the grease) and left out most of the oil to cook the scallops. One suggestion would be to whisk the sauce up to incorporate some air so it can get a little thicker.

I thought this dish was only ok.  I made it for a dinner party and was a little disappointed.  I love scallops and the vegetables were great, but I thought putting a sauce over the scallops kind of ruined them, and overall the dish was bland.

This recipe was fantastic!  My picky eating kids even liked it.  There is nothing bland about this recipe. I love the fact that I can enjoy the flavors of the food and not some heavy overbearing sauce.  I will definitely make this next week.

I really wanted to make this, but had no mascarpone cheese, so I used 4 oz. half/half and 4 oz. sour cream instead.  I don't know how it would have tasted with the mascarpone, but it was excellent even with these substitutions.  One note though:  I did add fresh grated parmesan on the plate & my husband & I both felt that made a huge addition to the overall flavor.  I will make again using real mascarpone!

Not bad, but kind of blah. Only change I made was that I used a lb of frozen broccoli instead of aspargus. Overall it just tasted bland, I think it would be better with a different kind of cheese, or maybe add cheddar or something swith a sharper taste (i dont know cheeses and have no idea if that would taste good or not so do it at your own risk)

Definetly restaurant quality.  I used shrimp and left over linguini and sauted a half cup of finely sliced onions with the garlic/butter/ parsley at the beginning and added some broccoli. I also had about 1 1/2 c. of the cheese, so added milk until I got the consistency I wanted.  Excellent recipe
