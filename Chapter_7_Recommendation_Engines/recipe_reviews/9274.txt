I used to love fruitcake until I lost all my teeth to nerve damage in my mouth (never had a cavity in my life either).  Every recipe for fruitcake has walnuts or pecans or hard citron. This recipe has no citron,great, but wow it has alot of nuts. Any idea of how to adapt the recipe so that even I can eat it?

The 'batter' was extremely dry and I had to use liquid to get it to mix. Is this right? I thought that maybe fresh dates would be juicier, but the only dates I could find were Sunkist in a package. 8 cups of nut halves seemed too much as well. But we'll see; it's in the oven and still has an hour to go.
