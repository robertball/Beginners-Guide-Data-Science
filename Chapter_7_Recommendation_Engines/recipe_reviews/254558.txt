I make this all the time, I just don't add vanilla or cinnamon unless I'm making it with milk and drinking it hot.  It's very hydrating and refreshing!

Made this and my 9 month old baby LOVES it, as do we! Sweetened with a handful of dates instead of sugar. Does anyone know how long this will keep in the refrigerator?

I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings but followed the directions otherwise. I just didn't care for this beverage.

Not my favorite; it was watery where I hoped for a little creamier.  It was received with politeness but nobody requested more at our cookout in high temperatures.  I guess it wasnâ€™t so refreshing as I had hoped for.

This is very refreshing and easy to make. I did add some ground cinnamon and a little extra vanilla. Best served on ice!

I made this after trying the recipe for Lola's Horchata, which is stellar. Rather than adding the sugar, though, I used raw honey instead for this recipe because I hated to cancel out the benefits of the oats with all that white sugar. The result was something very close to the flavor of Cheerios, so we call this Cheeriata. :) I want to try this recipe exactly as is at some point, but I'm about at my sugar limit after all that horchata lately. If you're going to use honey, remember that honey is sweeter than sugar so you don't need as much. I also added a little bit of flax seeds with the oats when I blended them. I'm so glad y'all posted this recipe because I'd have been too scared to try it without knowing it was "a thing."

I thought this was good--I liked the hints of cinnamon and vanilla. I had to strain it two more times for me to like the consistency.

I love this recipe! my God mother used to make it growing up. I always found it refreshing but after doing some research h I  learned that people do it for weight loss! one cup a few minutes before eating helps u feel full. so its a refreshing drink that can also help u lose weight! also I like to add a splash of milk after pouring myself a cup . tastes like an horchata :)

If you follow the recipe, it is great. Just like I remember. Grew up in Costa Rica and for years could not figure out how they did it. Now I know thanks
