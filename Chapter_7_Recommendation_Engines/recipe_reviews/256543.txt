These were great! The only problem I had is that it was hard to fill the potato while in its raw state. There isn't a lot of give. I ended up adding more butter and bacon once they were cooked. Delicious!

Delicious, everyone loved it! I used olive oil instead of butter, trying to make a little more heart healthy.
