Disclaimer, This is my recipe. I  just wanted to pass on some tips.  First off.  Stick to the recipe, please don't alter it, then rate it, as its no longer mine. 

Do not over work the dough, flatten out gently, dust lightly with flour, (will be sticky) pat gently and then fold again, repeat, you should only do it 4-5 times max, any more and your dough will comes out flat, dense, and chewy.  

If they don't turn out like that, you more than likely overworked the dough, or need fresh baking powder/soda  

These rise about an inch on avg.

Remember the key is, handle the dough as lightly and as little as possible.  

A Tip:  To make buttermilk just add a 1 tbs of white vinegar to a cup of milk. Let sit for 5 minutes, and you now have buttermilk.  

To keep the lard/butter from clumping, grate directly over the flour moving it around as you grate and give a little stir if you see it clumping. 

BTW Grandma always sifted her flour, I did not,  

I've eaten a lot of country food. This is the best biscuits I've ever had.  If yours don't turn out delicious, please try again, as something went wrong.  It's worth it.  Btw- These biscuits should be soft in the middle and have a very light crunch on the top. Grandma's words about biscuits, it largely comes down to feel and texture of the biscuit when it is kneaded perfectly with the right moisture to flour ratio and that comes only with a little practice. Enjoy! WARNING: this is NOT health food,   Please judge solely on taste.

I have made these biscuits twice now - both times within ONE week! Originally, I am Southern-raised from NC, now living in CA, and I had been looking for some good old-fashioned Southern buttermilk biscuits to make for myself since they are basically nowhere to be found in Northern California. I stumbled across this recipe and couldn't wait to try it! I made a few substitutions - namely, instead of lard, I used 100% vegetable shortening. The first time, I made these exactly as the recipe stated. I was pleased overall with the consistency and the texture of them - just as the recipe described - but I felt it was missing something for my personal taste - namely, I thought the taste was a bit too... floury. I wanted more of a melt-in-your-mouth buttery flavor. The second time I made these, I used way more butter than shortening, in fact, I nearly doubled the amount of butter that I put into them (hey, I'm from the South - I enjoy my buttery buttermilk biscuits!) and they turned out phenomenally! In retrospect, I realized that I should have perhaps bought and used butter-flavored shortening instead of flavorless, but that's what recipes are for - trial and error. I highly recommend using mostly butter in them, however, because the flavor is so moist, decadent, and reminds you of home. I froze my butter and shortening beforehand and just used a cheese grater to grate the desired quantities into the recipe. I highly recommend doing that, as well - the biscuits come out so fluffy.

Because I don't have lard, I used vegetable shortening (Crisco). I saw the submitter's suggestion to add two teaspoons of baking powder which is good because if I hadn't seen that, I don't think they'd have turned out as well. The bacon drippings was genius--it added just a hint of bacon flavor that really made these biscuits good! We all loved these and there are no leftovers. Next time, I might omit the lard and just use bacon drippings. That was a money idea. Thanks, Greg!

I've been trying to make homemade southern buttermilk biscuits for years and they never turn out well, no matter what recipe I try.  These turned out perfect and my husband is devouring them and moaning with happiness as I write this!  Thank you, thank you for this wonderful recipe and the tips on making great biscuits.  This is life changing in our home!

Holy Cow! Best biscuits I've had in twenty years.  These really are southern style.  No, its not health food, or gluten free, or made with canola oil, but man if you love authentic southern style biscuits, these are it!!  I'm scratching my head at some of these reviews though, they rave about the flavor, then complain about the ingredients used.  Which is downright silly and a bit unfair to the submitter since it clearly list the ingredient, the fat content, the calorie count and everything else.   This is truly southern style, in the south we use lard, and lots of butter and salt. If you want healthy biscuits, I suggest people do a search for HEALTHY/GLUTEN Free Biscuits.  Grandma Mary would be proud of these.  One thing I noticed though, make sure that butter and lard are frozen hard, else its going to stick to the grater.  I'm going to go scoop up a bunch of  tbs of lard and keep it in my freezer now.  This is now a new Sunday Brunch tradition.  I wish I could give this 10 stars, they really are that good.  Thanks Greg!! I've been looking for this recipe for 20 years!!  After using this site for the last 6 months in a lurking state, I felt so compelled to rate these biscuits, I had to sign up to let people know, this is the biscuit recipe your looking for and they really are easy and fool proof if you follow the recipe.

Really good southern buttermilk biscuits.  They aren't quite my grandmothers (what I am searching for) but the closest thus far.  I'm certain with a few changes I will finally be able to replicate Maw's! Thanks Greg!

I loved these biscuits.  Mine usually come out "ok-ish", nothing special. These, however, made me feel like i've finally found THE recipe! They are so light inside but with a ever so light cruntch on the top. Thanks for this great recipe!!

Really, really delicious! I didn't have lard and ended up using vegetable shortening - I have a feeling they would have been even better with the lard, but they were great with the shortening, too. Thanks for the recipe!

I was home late from grocery shopping and didn't have much time to  prepare or cook before my husband had to leave for work. I made these biscuits to go with sausage gravy. I have NEVER made homemade biscuits before, and while making these, I fully expected them to be a disaster. I had no bacon drippings and no lard. I used vegetable shortening, which I had not had time to freeze before adding it to the flour mixture. I just plopped it right in there. The butter was only refrigerated, which I still grated, and I couldn't be bothered to roll the dough out and cut it out into circular portions. All I did was rip the dough up and plop it right on the baking sheet. Despite all of this, they STILL came out completely delicious! Of course, the next time I make them, I will do it all the right way, but I do have to say, this is an amazing recipe if those biscuits can still come out almost perfect despite royally screwing up the recipe. 5 stars, thank you!!

We loved these! The only change I made was to use butter-flavored shortening in place of lard since that's what I had on hand. Everything else I followed exactly as written. Excellent recipe! The first time I've made buttermilk biscuits from scratch and this recipe is wonderful. I am sure they are even better using lard! Thanks, I will make these again.

This recipe is simply amazing.   This is that perfect recipe I have been looking for!  Light, soft, flaky biscuits the whole family loved. 
  My only change was adding sausage drippings as these were for sausage and biscuits.  
Instead of using a biscuit cutter, I shaped the dough into a big rectangle and cut it into equal squares with a pizza cutter.

These were yummy. I was a bit taken back when I decided to use this recipe only for the fact of actually buying a tub of lard vs shortening. But I did purchase the lard, followed the recipe to a T. And to my delight or at least to my family's delight, they enjoyed these biscuits very much. They thought I went to the local Chicken and biscuit fast food chain and purchased them, but when I told them...they weren't open at the hour I decided to make them. I'll make this again. I couldn't find my biscuit cutter so I used a drinking glass and it did the same thing. And brushed the tops with butter when they were almost ready to come out of the oven. Thanks.

This one's a keeper!


My husband called me this morning before coming home from work to request biscuits and gravy for breakfast. I haven't made biscuits from scratch in over 40 years. The last time I made them, they came out like rocks so I used canned biscuits from then on. Sausage gravy, I make all the time without a recipe and no problem but no biscuits in the fridge...oops.

Found this recipe, cut it in half (just the 2 of us). No lard and not enough time to freeze butter or fry bacon. Used all butter cut into flour mixture. Worked the mixture quickly bringing dough just together. Continued the rest exactly as Greg's tips suggested except, 1" is about the length of my fingertip to the first joint and I rolled out the dough about 1/2". To keep the amount of working time to a minimum, I stacked them 2 high and patted them down slightly. I don't think I needed to do that because what I ended up with was 4 beautifully browned, very tall, deliciously tender, best tasting biscuits I've ever eaten.


I have a convection oven like one of the other reviewers and 12 minutes is about right. Please, do not overwork the dough or add too much flour. If it's still slightly sticky when you scrape it out of the bowl onto your floured surface, no problem. Just follow Greg's hints and you can't go wrong.

I've made this recipe many times now, and sorry, Greg, but I've altered the process and ingredients somewhat, but these still get a 5. I'm way to lazy to freeze fats and grate them, and I can't have saturated fats or salt, so I adjusted the recipe and no one has noticed a difference yet. I whisk the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl, omitting the salt, and then add in 2 Tbs olive oil and 2 1/2 Tbs Olivio margarine. Cut that in, and add in a bit more buttermilk, maybe 2 Tbs to 1/4 C more than the recipe says, depending on the dryness of the flour. Greg is right about not overworking the dough, and for me, the extra liquid makes that possible. It's still my favorite biscuit recipe, and an easy five stars.  Also, I've forced myself to cut straight down without twisting, and these rise high, have a tender crumb, and stay moist if there are leftovers.  That's not often!

I did not have any lard and used butter and they came out just fine. I also experimented with making them into and angel biscuit to serve with strawberries and whipped cream...used butter instead of bacon grease for that (so now it is all butter) and added 1 tsp of yeast to the buttermilk/let it rise for an hour before baking. Awesome dessert biscuit! As posted along the way..the real secret is minimal handling of the dough.

Very good biscuits for breakfast with strawberry jam on top.  Once cut, I froze mine before baking, so I can take one or two out and bake at anytime.  Tip:  let thaw briefly before baking.

Thanks for sharing! I skip the lard and use cold bacon grease instead. These biscuits always turn out delicious and tender.

I made them with kefir instead of buttermilk, and sausage drippings instead of bacon drippings.  I then served them with the gravy from the Drop Biscuits and Gravy recipe.  My kids loved them.  Not health food, but delicious winter fare.

These are awesome! I have been searching for a good southern biscuit recipe and this is it.  Have made them several times, although I haven't bothered to freeze the butter or lard (ok I used vegetable shortening instead of lard)  and it worked great.  I'm sure the lard would have tasted even better but couldn't bring myself to add it.  Maybe for the holiday's I will.

Great bisquits! I used a Silpat mat instead of lard on the pan and I used 4 T of butter and no lard in the mix.

The best recipe I have found.  I have tried many times to make biscuits  that taste like my mother-in-laws.  My husband said these taste like the ones he had as a kid.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will make again.

Awesome! Loved these. They were flaky and full of flavor. A nice crunch the outside as well. These were my first attempt at Buttermilk biscuits and it will be a keeper! (I didn't add the bacon drippings since I didn't have any on hand)

Wonderful tasting biscuits! Next time I will have to let the butter and Crisco freeze a bit longer as mine was still soft. My biscuits didn't rise well. I don't feel that it was due to the butter and lard not being frozen. Though, I'll admit, I've made SEVERAL different biscuit recipes and NONE of them had risen well! But these had a wonderful flavor and I won't be giving up on these...will try them again next weekend! Thank you!

My biscuits turned out perfect and I did not even add the bacon grease, they were so wonderful.  If I added more butter and less lard, I think I would get a KFC biscuit and we would tear those suckers up!  I don't think I will ever buy prepared packaged biscuits ever again.  I will have to triple my recipe for my family next time.  Thank you so much for helping me accomplish what I feel every southern lady should know how to make from scratch!

Grating frozen fat is such a great idea! Unfortunately I live in a country where I have never seen lard or even shortening. So I had to use more butter in place. It was still good, much better than my normal biscuit recipe. But I just wanted to let people know that it probably still much better with the lard, I just didn't have a choice.

Taste wise, this is a great recipe ... 

As indicated, it produces a very sticky dough ... which can be a bit messy and difficult to work with.  To cope with that, I generally jump to the chase and add 2 tablespoons of flour in the beginning ... with no apparent negative taste effects.

Don't use a rolling pin or overwork the dough ... and don't overcook.  It depends on the oven, but I bake these for 12-15 minutes at 450 ... a bit longer at 425.

Wow!  These are the lightest fluffiest biscuits I have had in a long time.  I didn't have lard so I used all butter.  The butter was not frozen but I did add it to the flour mixture right from the fridge.  I also added 1 tbs of sugar (full recipe).  I made the biscuits quite thick and I was only able to make 6 full size biscuits.  I did have a little dough leftover which made a small biscuit.  The biscuits onlyneed about 11 minutes to cook.  Don't skip the buttermilk, I think it really makes the difference.

I used 1 stick (8 tbsp) frozen butter instead of 4 tbsp frozen lard and butter, and I increased salt to 1 teaspoon instead of the 3/4 tsp the recipe called for; the biscuits tasted really good.  The only thing is that, next time, I will roll out to 1" thickness, otherwise these are really flat biscuits.

These really are fantastic biscuits.  They have become a Sunday morning favorite in my house, with bacon and gravy made from the drippings.  I use crisco(instead of lard) because I keep that on hand and it works great.  The biscuits are always tender on the inside with a light crunch on top like Greg said.  The grating is genius and keeps the handling of the dough to a minimum.  Making the buttermilk, for anyone doubting whether it works, it absolutely does and does not effect the biscuits at all. Nice job Greg and thanks for the recipe!

So bad for you! So good though. I wouldn't eat these all the time but for a once in awhile treat...I miss Southern cooking. Makes me nostalgic. (: I have to take one star off because I can't eat like this anymore.

Was crunchy texture that wasn't bad but the taste was more of a lard taste and not good.  Family didn't care for it.  Very messy to work with sticky dough as well.  Rather have air buns.

This was my first time making biscuits like this and they turned out great.  I had a very hard time shredding frozen butter and lard...it ended up in my bowl in big clumps, so I would just chill and chop next time, then integrate until it reaches the oatmeal texture needed.  The layers were perfect!

Perfect as is - just need to remember to put the butter and shortening in the freezer (biscuits burn if you forget).  Reminded my of my grandmother's recipe.  Love the flavor and texture of this biscuit!

The first time that I made this recipe I had to make them for my family again later that night and then yet again the next morning. They beg for these!! I had never made biscuits from scratch before but this recipe was PERFECT. I am born and raised deep south and trust me, these are the real thing. My biscuits rise at least one inch and often much more. Great with some good white gravy or butter and jam. THANK YOU GREG! AWESOME! You have made me a kitchen hero.

Ooohh these were so good and fluffy!  I thought at first the bacon grease was just too much but then they just grow on you.  I made them too thin because I got about 12 biscuits but my husband ate about 5 and said they were the best he'd ever had!

Fantastic recipe! I have to admit, my biscuit making history up to this point only included adventures with Bisquick and box recipes, and they were never very good at all. I always thought of "from scratch" biscuits as something I probably would never be good at making. This recipe has put all of those thoughts behind me. I have made them twice since finding the recipe yesterday. My grocery doesn't carry lard, so I used all butter both times, and left out the bacon grease the first time. Both times they came out terrific, the best biscuits I think I have ever had. My family gobbled them up literally in minutes, both times, and they are already asking when we can have them again. Thank you so much for posting this, it is definitely THE only biscuit recipe I will ever need.

Mine accidentally sealed on the edges even though I was careful not to twist, but they're still super yummy! I subbed veg. shortening for lard, and butter for the bacon drippings since we don't eat meat. I skipped the frozen stuff part and just melted it all in the microwave and poured it in. I also used lemon juice and milk for buttermilk, and they STILL turned out good, despite all my attempts to destroy them! lol

OMG Fantastic! Unfortunately I did not have any bacon, but I am definitely going to make these again when I get some. I've been trying to find the perfect "Hardees Biscuit Recipe" for years. My daughter in law just tried one and said these are even better!

To guarantee a flaky and layered biscuit, I pat out , cut and pan a first layer, Pat out the remainder. cut and butter a set of toppers for the first layer. Add the second cut, butter side down on the first layer. They bake up great with a two layer biscuit that always divides where you want it to. This dough works great. For a slightly drier biscuit that really soaks up the gravy, work the dough less. For butter and jam or jelly. work it a bit more to develop the gluten in the flour.

No changes, it's perfect as it is.
This is how I make them although I use bacon grease  instead of lard because that's how my grandmother taught me to make them.  

But  cutting in the frozen fats, handling the dough as little as possible and cutting  straight down rather than  back and forth is what makes these perfect.

Wonderful tasting.Finally a biscuit that doesn't just taste like flour. I cut the recipe in half 'cause there is just me here. It was wonderful. I will be making these quite often. And instead of a greater I used a potato peeler and it worked fine. Thank you Greg.

Fiver stars because it is a tasty, tender biscuit with a light crisp to the outside despite my issues:  my son hid my cheese grater, so I had to use a circular shredder thing and thawed much of all of it in the process.  It came out as a lump, so I whacked it around with a whisk (cooler temp than my hands) to distribute.  This was considerably more than 2 stirs.  Used sausage grease instead of bacon as I used the last of the bacon grease to season my skillets & was making sausage gravy anyway.  I did not handle it much once I added the liquid, but rolled it to 1/2" (having made too many pie crusts & tortillas lately) They baked up double (about the height as those little store can ones)  So, five stars for an good product after many errors.  That said, they could be better brushed with melted butter straight out of the oven to amplify the butter taste.

I made this glutten free without changing anything except the type of flour and added xanthum gum and they were just AMAZING - my kids scarfed them up with honey!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I think it was perfect as is and could be altered to make a dessert just by adding a little sugar!

I have tried these twice, the first time was flat and a little tough. The key is not to knead to much as the second time I was more careful about it and they came out perfect! Great as next day biscuits for sausage and gravy!

I followed directions exactly as written, but for whatever reason the overall taste just was not there for me.  Tasted very plain: next time I will use more butter (will say they were very fluffy).  Not giving up on them; so look for my 4 starts to hopefully turn into 5.  May just be a matter of taste too.

I had to use only unsalted butter because I didn't hard any lard or bacon, but used the same measurements, they still came out soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside, I made them for breakfast for a friend, out took only.about 20 minutes from making the dough & baking them. I will make these again. I barely worked the dough I think that's key to making them fluffy.

I made these for the first time last night.  I was looking for a biscuit recipe to make creamed chicken over biscuits.  Followed the recipe as written - bought the lard and made the buttermilk with vinegar as suggested.  I had to use a glass to cut them out, and I tended to turn the glass as I cut the biscuits (old cookie cutter habit).  And apparently I can't judge what an inch is either.  My husband looked at them and said, "that's more like a half inch dear!"  Too late to rework the dough to fix that....  They still turned out fantastic.  When our 17yr old got home and tried them he said they tasted like KFC biscuits.  Grating the lard and butter was ingenious.  Greg, thanks for the recipe.  You should make a video and put it up on YouTube to demonstrate how easy it is to make these.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first attempt at buttermilk biscuits and these turned out pretty great.  I think I either worked the dough too much or not enough as they didn't turn out as flaky as I would like but that was definitely due to me not the recipe.  The only change I made was to use butter in place of the lard and bacon drippings.  I will be trying these again very soon, thanks for a great recipe!  Edit - Made again 11/17 with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour, did not have as much luck, maybe it needed more baking soda or powder, not sure.  Still were good though.

Great recipe! Makes tall fluffy biscuits. I made them as is and then I made some herbed ones to go with a stew. I added 1-2 tbsp. rosemary, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp sage. 2 cloves toasted garlic in olive oil as a sub for the bacon grease. And I also added bits of chopped string cheese which made for little gooey cheese strands when you pull the biscuit apart. Solid recipe!

I've made these biscuits 4-5 times and they are great every time!  My Aunt Grace who hailed from Burnsville, NC made the best biscuits I've had the pleasure of eating.  These are a close second....but it's been 30 yrs since I've had my Aunt Grace's biscuits, so it could just be fond memories of spending time in the Smokey Mountains.  Either way...these are great biscuits!

First time making biscuits from scratch.  I thought all was lost after mixing the buttermilk and bacon drippings. What a gooey mess. But, things starting coming together after dusting with flour and folding.  I got 8 biscuits out of the recipe and that was rolling them out about 1/2" thick. Bake until dark golden. They really are awesome.

This recipe is very good. However, I would say that the most important thing is if you are going to use a cheese grater, make sure that your butter and lard (or shortening) is frozen HARD AS A ROCK. Otherwise, it will be a mess to grate. I recently made another recipe that required to freeze the butter, and if you have the strength to work with frozen butter, this recipe will be perfectly done with a pastry mixer. This saved the day for me while making this recipe. I followed the rest of the instructions to a T. It is vital "to knead" the dough the least amount of times. Don't over handle the dough and make sure your butter and lard are frozen hard. They came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. By the way, you can make them less crispy just watch them as they start to brown. Edit: I also used the home made buttermilk as suggested by the author, excellent!

Won’t make these again. Dry and NOT fluffy. I minimally handled the dough, even by rolling into a rectangle and cutting squares with a floured knife so the dough would not have to be re-rolled to use the entire batch. Try something else.

These were nice. Lard isn't easily accessible here so I just used double the butter. Instead of circles I cut these rectangular. This made a tasty biscuit and my 5 year old who is such a picky eater kept asking for another, so that's a win in my books.

These turned out like little pillows....just beautiful...thank you for the recipe of which I did 99% original recipe it is just I used bacon fat instead of lard as I didn't have any, and also chopped fats up into flour in the food processor I just didn't over blend.   I mixed the milk in by hand as directed but when I began folding I added more butter...a quick smear on one side of the fold - like one does in flake pastry - ...and I believe that helped.  I didn't use a biscuit cutter either I just used a knife..but only cut down as that makes total sense, again like flaky pastry.  Made about 12 and I've only 2 left...made them yesterday, My husband couldn't stop eating them and I had to smack his hand to get the few I gobbled down. :-)

These are the best biscuits that I have made in many years-if not EVER!!! We absolutely loved them! I live in the South, where lard is pretty easy to find, but I just couldn't bring myself to buy any, so I subbed cold shortening. I also used a little bit more butter than 2 Tbsp  because of my preference for really buttery biscuits. However, the flavor that really amazingly stood out to me was the small (seemingly) miniscule tsp of bacon fat! The flavor imparted by that small amount permeated the entire biscuit! My only disappointment was that I only got 7 out of the recipe! Although these biscuits are quite an indulgence, this is my absolute go-to biscuit recipe going forward. I can't thank you enough for sharing this family gem with us Greg! Many blessings.

Nice biscuits interesting technique that works well  and is fast! Two alterations: I used tenderflake & butter   Also as suggested increased the baking powder. 
Overall a nice product, pleased to serve. 
Thanks for the technique. 

Updated:
I have applied a somewhat different technique. Once the mixture is turned onto the rolling surface: I press it into a 1 inch rectangle. Then with a pastry scraper, I cut the rectangle in 4.  Next you pile the squares (tuck loose flour and scraped between layers) and press the mass down gently into a 6X9 rectangle one inch thick and then cut into 6 squares. I baked mine in a Well greased muffin pan. Buttery and crisp on the outside and tender layers inside. Mmmm

Uncanny! Finally, I found a biscuit recipe that I will make again and again.  My prior "go to" recipe used self-rising flour and lard or Crisco.  Really good biscuit, but it always crumbled.  A pat of hard butter or a sausage patty made them fall completely apart.  Not this recipe, they came out perfect, light, moist and did not crumble (amazing!).  Only change I made was outing the lard/Crisco for butter.  Adding bacon fat was a nice touch, thanks Gregg.

These were great! OK I did not follow the recipe to the letter. I did not freeze my butter and lard. They were just cold from the refrigerator. So I just cut them up into little cubes and used a pastry knife to cut them into the flour. My bacon fat was also cold so I cut that in as well. But the biscuits came out wonderful. Tall and fluffy and oh so good.  This is the way I will make all my biscuits from here on.

Don't change nuthin!!! At least until you have made this recipe at least twice. Made them for the crew in the oil patch and they loved them. They put jelly, bacon and ham in them, wrap them in a paper towel, put them in their pocket and keep them until they get a break. That is high praise indeed around here.

We were spending the night in the mountains with our kids and I promised biscuits and gravy for breakfast. Took everything with us -  put the dry ingredients in a plastic bag and kept in the freezer along with the butter. Didn't have lard. Added the bacon grease and buttermilk to a jar. In the morning, cut up the frozen butter, mixed w/flour, added buttermilk. Patted the dough out, used my bench scrapper to fold so the dough stayed cold. Did the final pat out on parchment, cut with the bench scraper, transferred to a sheet pan and baked. You don't need gravy or butter. Tender on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside. This is the recipe I've been looking for. YUUMMMM!!

Experience tells me to handle the dough as little as possible. So I do not fold it so many times, if at all, and I pat it out into a round rather than taking a rolling pin to it. Love that little taste of bacon you added. I do not do the grating...too much work. Just cut little chunks of the cold fat and do the rest with the pastry blender. Would you tell me where you get good lard? The product in the grocery stores now is so processed it bears little resemblance to the real lard Grandma put in her biscuits every morning. The good old days.

My first time attempting to make biscuits from scratch (I've made them with Bisquick once before) and as you might have guessed, I obviously overworked the dough because these turned out flat. I also used Crisco Shortning because I've no idea where to even get lard these days (could not find it at the store). That being said, hubby's mom must've overworked her dough too because he loved these and said they were just like mom's. Now I'm torn between continuing to overwork the dough so they'll be "just like mom's" or try it the way it SHOULD be. :-/ Thanks Greg!

It just so happened I was learning how to render down fat for lard, suet, and cracklins, so making homemade biscuits seemed like the natural thing to do (this is only my second time). The recipe was very easy.  I was glad to be able to use my fresh lard.  I didn't have any sour cream, so I used a sour cream replacement. The only thing I did wrong was "twist" my glass when I cut (thanks for the new info).   They didn't rise as they should have, but they were flaky.  My husband thought they were great; and that's all that matters.

I didn't have lard. Everything I have read about lard was that it was difficult to find decent quality lard. Since I don't know decent from bad I'll never use lard in recipe's. I used butter flavored Crisco shortening in place of lard and followed the recipe otherwise. Biscuits seem as if they would be easy and I've not had a lot of success baking them. These  were the best biscuits I have made. I'll use this recipe again in the future. Thanks for sharing Greg.

These biscuits are perfect.  Exactly what they should be! Biscuits are all basically the same recipe- the difference with these is that the method is foolproof.  If it's hot in the kitchen when I make these, I throw the flour mixture in the fridge for a few minutes to cool it off before adding the buttermilk.  My oven is hinky, so I do these around 400º, and just keep them in until nicely browned. Good job, Man!  This recipe rocks.

Made with 1 tablespoon bacon grease in place of 1 tablespoon butter/. Very tasty but didn't raise as much as I'd like.

This a very good biscuit recipe. I cut it in half because I like 'em fresh and don't have a lot of freezer room. I did add 1 tbsp of sugar and I didn't roll out, only patted into a square and then cut with a knife. They came out wonderful. Thanks for this delicious recipe.

I was looking for a true southern biscuit made with lard and buttermilk. This is the best I've tried. They baked up high, light, flaky inside and a nice crisp to the outside. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the frozen butter and lard, mine were refrigerated, and I didn't have any bacon drippings. Next time I will make sure I have some on hand, though I can't really imagine them tasting any better.

A bit on the salty side, but tasty. Good place to start when trying your hand at making biscuits.

I have not tried this recipe.  I am sure it tastes great but my hubby and I are on a cholesterol restricted diet and with all the lard, butter and bacon fat in this recipe, I don't think I will be making these.

So much milk, it was biscuit soup!  I had to reconfigure big-time!
