This is delicious! Warm and smooth-yum! And, yes, the memories associated with the taste and smell make it even better.  Mine are also of my Grandma and my Mom standing in the kitchen, conversing in Belgian, cooking up a storm!  Nostalgia is so good for the soul!  Susan-Mpls

I thought this was pretty good. Don't make this expecting a taste or texture of instant pudding. This is homemade and it is the way it is supposed to be. I made this for an Allrecipes challenge for recipes without faces (pictures). I specifically went out and bought the PET milk and even bought margarine to follow it exactly. Pudding is one of those things, that slight changes can fail a recipe. So, even though, I had acceptable subtitutes I didn't use them. For the eggs I used 3 medium sized. I don't like a real eggy tasting pudding. I used a good medium sized thick bottom pot and started the boil at 7. I was worried, as that temperature is prone to making pudding burn. However, I whisked it well and it was fine. As soon as it started a slow boil, after about 4 minutes, I turned it down to 3. It was already plenty thick so I just let it simmer, while whisking, for 5 minutes. The cinnamon on top was a nice touch. I don't care much for pudding, but was happy this actually turned out. It did only make about 4 small servings though.

Yum! Made it this way for me and butterscotch for my husband. Switched white sugar for brown sugar. Both were delicious!

This is exactly like how my grandma made it and it brought me back to my childhood.  I used butter instead of margarine and I doubled the vanilla for a richer taste.

So good that I had to make it twice in the 1st night.  I took it off the stove and stepped away for a minute and none was left for me, so I kindly made a whole batch for me, myself, & I (shout out to De La Soul on that one).

This is a great recipe. I love pudding made with evaporated milk. I made it , put coconut in it and made a pie. It is fantastic.

OK...now add some bananas and some vanilla wafers, and you have banana pudding.  I make this all the time (except I use cornstarch instead of flour and it's not the exact recipe that I use, but the basis is the same).  I learned it from my granny (she told me three ingredients) and tweaked it to my liking.

Delicious!...and easy. First "from scratch" pudding and it turned out perfect. I liked it better without the cinnamon.
