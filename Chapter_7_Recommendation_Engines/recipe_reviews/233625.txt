I followed another user's recommendations and cut butter and flour down.  Also used fresh raspberries (did not add any sugar to them).  These turned out wonderful!  I love simple recipes :-)

I wanted a fast and easy dessert to take to an informal dinner with friends. This turned out fabulously and was really simple to throw together. I also cut the flour to 2 cups and the butter to 1 cup, as others had recommend. I used pecans instead, due to a walnut allergy. Everyone loved them... An excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

This recipe is one of the easiest and most delicious and the kids LOVE them. I have made hundreds of things off of this site and this is the first review I have ever done, But it deserves one. I just follow the recipe whenever I can but use what ever jam I have on hand. (raspberries generally dont grow well here so whatever I have preserved I use). I have even made these with coconut oil and left out the coconut flakes and that is wonderful as well. These are called something else but another reason I use this one instead is I like the name. lol try them you will love them! add more of these great little funny named things I will eat them and let you know!

I used fresh raspberries, strawberries, and fresh tart cherries.  Heated them over stove and mushed them.  Used apples sauce instead of butter,   whole wheat flour, and 1/4 the sugar.  Loved it, my kids couldn't get enough!

Very fast and easy. Used unsalted butter and added 1 tsp salt. Took others' advice on decreasing to 1 cup butter and 1 cup sugar.  Baked at 375 for 25 minutes for more toasty nuts and brownness.  Original time and temp seemed almost like cookie dough consistency.

Very sweet, very heavy.  Will try again with the following changes:  all fresh fruit rather than jam and cut the brown sugar in half.  Will serve as dessert with light whipped cream or frozen yogurt, to balance the heaviness.

This was a very easy recipe to follow, and the mazurkas were a huge hit with my family and with my husband's crew!

While visiting my friend, she made this, all measurements  as is--minus the walnuts since her hubby can't have them, then added a layer of fresh-picked red raspberries--and it was positively, wonderfully delicious!!  Spooned it up, warm out of the oven, topped with vanilla ice cream & ENJOYED!!!

I've made this 3 times and got complimented each time! I used fresh berries the first two times and thawed berries the last. With the thawed berries, the sweet raspberry juice penetrated the lower layer, making ever bite raspberry sweet! Yum!

It was very good. Used fresh raspberries instead of spread. What a nice distinct flavour. Yum.

Made this recipe with a few modifications.  Only used 2 c. flour, substituted pecans for walnuts (because that is what I had on hand), and reduced butter to 1 c.  Also, used fresh wild raspberries (no sugar or other ingredients) instead of jam as the filling.  This was quick, easy, and delicious---a definite keeper!

This was not a good recipe. It was WAY to sweet (and I have a sweet tooth!) Also when I went to cut them they didn't cut. I put them on a plate for my friends at ballet but by the time we got to eat them they had all gotten smushed together. My friends just took a chunk of sweet uncooked oat meal with coconut and preserves. I will not make this again.

This recipe turned out very well. I followed it exactly. The key is to mix the dry ingredients very well before adding the butter. Also, make sure that it is totally cooled off before cutting into bars. They were stored in the refrigerator and stayed great for days.
