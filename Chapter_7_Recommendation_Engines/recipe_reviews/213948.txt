I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHEN I MADE THESE, SOUNDED A LITTLE STRANGE, BUT I LOVE TO TRY NEW THINGS. AT FIRST THE "SYRUP" WAS VERY WATERY, SO I REDUCED  IT DOWN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE I PROCEDED WITH THE RECIPE. UNBELIEVABLE! WE NEVER MADE IT TO DINNER, ATE  A DOZEN! WILL DEFIINATELY MAKE AGAIN. SHERI

Had a very mild flavor, I was expecting it to be sweeter- but this may be how they do it!! I prefer heavier desserts!
