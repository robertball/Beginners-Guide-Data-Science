I really enjoyed this burrito...it was a nice change of pace and one I'll make again.  I was able to cut the calories down to 465 per burrito by omitting the oil (I cooked the bacon first, then cooked the eggs in the same pan using the drippings), using low carb whole wheat tortillas, low fat cheese and low fat sour cream.  I made the rest exactly as written and didn't add any extras. I thought the flavor was really good. Next time I will add some jalapeños for a little spice.  I really liked having the beans in there for texture. A great high-protein breakfast!

The dish itself is interesting. You couldn't really taste the bacon. In my opinion the bacon had no real flavor anyway and it was relatively....chewy.

I made a few tweaks to this to make it more diet friendly.  I used eggbeaters instead of eggs and also just sprayed the skillet with non-stick spray instead of using three tablespoons of oil that the recipe called for.  I also used low-carb tortillas.  I thought this made a great tasting breakfast!

My family liked it! We had breakfast for dinner tonight, and this came together fairly quick. I skipped the avocado - but other than that, followed the recipe. I'm looking forward to having one again for breakfast tomorrow.

We absolutely LOVED these burritos!! I used mild salsa in place of pica de gallo since it's what I had on hand. I could eat these every day they were so good! Definately give these a try.

I just made this. I added chipotle salsa for added flavor. It worked great. The cilantro is what makes the burrito.  Be sure to season the eggs well and this recipe will be a healthy keeper. Its definitely different. The turkey bacon needs to be nice and crisp for that yummy crunch.

This was just ok for us. The beans were a bit overpowering and we don't care for avocado or sour cream so we omitted those. Loved the turkey bacon! Will definitely use that again.

We had breakfast for lunch today.  The fillings are certainly yours for the choosing, but I followed the recipe, except for omitting the oil and garnishing with my pickled jalapeno peppers.  I've made many breakfast burritos, but this was my first with turkey bacon, and for us, it was just O.K.

These were fine, though not something I'd probably make again. I did make some tweaks because we don't care for avocado or cilantro.   Mr. LTH liked them well enough and I ate one, despite not being a fan of eggs or breakfast for dinner.  The plus side to this recipe was that it made me try turkey bacon and I discovered it's not bad, not bad at all.  In fact, I'd prefer these with the bacon left in strips, rather than mixed in the eggs.  This would be a 4 star recipe for taste, but the recipe is so vaguely written (particularly the egg step), it earns 3 stars.  THANKS for the recipe!

I tweaked this recipe considerably, but did it for two reasons: to make something my husband would eat and to save calories. My husband doesn't care for avocado or cilantro, so I omitted both those. To save on a few calories, I omitted the oil, used fewer eggs, used 2% sharp cheddar cheese, and used a low carb tortilla. Frankly, I don't think my changes hurt this recipe one bit. It was delicious and something I would make again.

This recipe is just okay. The flavors didn't add up very well but the Butterball turkey bacon was nice with the eggs. I love the idea of this as a wrap and the avocado paired well but the beans throw it off. Maybe just meat, cheese, egg, sour cream, and salsa? Also would go great with Mexican rice inside.

I think this is a good basic recipe that could use some improvement.  The idea behind it is fabulous.  However, the instructions regarding the eggs (are they suppose to be scrambled?) don't really make sense.  I assumed the eggs were being scrambled, and I added 1/4 cup of water to them so they wouldn't be rubbery.  Also, I think two cans of chili beans could be used for this and could be cooked into the eggs after the eggs are done cooking.  I would also melt the cheese into the eggs while they're cooking.  American cheese would've been a great choice for this.  I have a few ideas to make this better and wrote about it in my blog. A person could make this over 50 different ways, and I think that using your own ideas and adding ingredients you love (vegetables, cheeses, etc.) would make it your own.  It makes so much that once you have it the way you want it, the burritos would be easy to wrap up and take on the go.

This was delicious!! I whisked my eggs with a little water and cooked them scrambled style, adding the cheese along with the bacon directly to the eggs. I used vegetarian chili instead of "seasoned beans" and I thought this was a wonderful breakfast, especially with the sour cream and salsa. Yumm!! Very hearty and filling.

I really liked this.  I'm sure with avocado I would have loved it but I didn't have avocado.  I love cilantro so that is probably what makes this recipe for me.  I added a little homeamade tomatillo salsa instead of regular salsa because I like more kick and I used homemade tortillas.

For us, this was just ok.  We love breakfast burritos and this was certainly different from what we are used to. I'm rating this a 3 because, I think it is a great basic recipe and you can do so many things with it as one other reviewer mentioned.  I chose not to put the3 beans in as I didn't have any on hand and we really aren't fans of them.  I followed the recipe to the T without the oil.  I used a non stick pan to prepare them which eliminates the need for oil.  Next time I would add in some shredded cheese to the eggs while they are setting up as well as in the burrito itself (what can I say???  I LOVE CHEESE)  
I would give this recipe a try and suggest you make it your own. After all, it is a good basic recipe and you can definitely take this as far as your imagination will go!  I also think that the prep time on this is not something I would consider if I was going to use it as a grab-and-go type of breakfast.  For me, I would like to be able to eat this at the table as it can be a bit messy to eat in the car. #TurkeyTuesday
