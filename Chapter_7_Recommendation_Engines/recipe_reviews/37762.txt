Very easy but lacks flavor.  The secret to fried rice is using day old rice so it doesn't get very sticky or mushy.

It was quick and easy, but the taste just wasn't there.  All I could taste were the vegetables.

This was very easy and fast. The flavor and texture did not appeal to me. I will not make this again.

"This receipe seems to have no flavor to it..." no offense to Kraft, but to add some flavor to it, I would add on clove of minced garlic, and scrambled eggs to the fried rice...this is the way my mother and I cook it, and everyone seems to like it...

YUCK!  No flavor.  Bland taste.  Very easy--made with ingredients I had on hand.

Has the potential to be a great, fast & easy side dish, with more flavor/seasonings.........but I don't know what!

Was a great side dish.  Might reduce the rice and use more mixed veggies.

Not much flavor at all. Had to add stir-fry sauce to give it enough flavor to eat. Next time it would be easier and taste better to just use a bottle of stir-fry sauce added to the pan.

I'm a Mom and my kids loved this fried rice. My husband and I also enjoyed it but not as much as the kids. I will make it again because it was quick and easy.

For more flavor, I suggest adding two cloves of minced garlic (fry in a bit of oil before adding vegetable mixture), nixing the chicken bouillon and substituting at least half the water for chicken broth. Use salt and pepper to taste at the end.

SO fast and easy, but I was a little dissapointed. I used brown rice, so I know that changed the flavor, but this just simply didn't have the texture. Much better  if reheated on the stove the next day, with a few added spices.

Excellent recipe. I don't like frozen veggies, so I substituted canned mixed veggie instead.

It was so wonderful and so easy to make! A full bag of vegetables might be too much, so next time I'll only use a half of a bag.
