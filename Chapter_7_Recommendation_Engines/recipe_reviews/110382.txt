Even though I let the grape leaves get too close to the broiler and scorched them a bit my husband told me to give this recipe 5 stars and since he ate two servings I guess that comes out to ten ! The leaves keep the fish moist and give it body. Served with lemon dill rice and broiled fresh asparagus. Perfect combo.

I like the fish, but the sauce was extremely intense, I dilluted it with water. This goes great with the healthy garden salad; also a finalist.

Was looking for a way to use the rest of some jarred grape leaves and found this recipe - made it exactly as stated and it was delicious!

You know it's good when the 6 year old loves the little "berries" (capers) and the 11 year old gobbles it up. Truly an easy, restaurant quality dish.
