I made this for lunch and my kids ate it fine.  I enjoyed it as well but next time I would either add more carrots or use less water to make it a bit thicker.  Maybe add some squash. As well maybe play with some spices, I do like the fact that it doesn't call for salt. Overall it was fast and easy and I will probably make it again.

I was a little worried that this would turn out watery it didn't. I used World's Greatest Vegetable Broth from this site as a base and followed recipe exactly. My husband's friend said this was the best soup he's ever had. Will be making again thanks.

Considering how simple this soup is to make, I thought it was great. All I needed to add was salt and pepper.

The addition of Worcesteshire Sauce means that this dish is not strictly Vegetarian - the sauce contains anchovies.  Those who are allergic to fish beware!!

it’s even better with red lentils.  i usually fry together, until the onion’s really soft, half an onion, a clove of garlic, chopped (which i remove before adding the liquid), a teaspoon of grated ginger if i have it, cracked coriander seeds, a teaspoon of coriander poweder, or cumin, or garam masala, then add about a litre of stock, 5 or 6 carrots, a glass of red lentils, then let it all simmer together for about 20mins to half an hour.  I liquidise it with a handful of fresh coriander then serve it with or without yoghurt and more fresh coriander.  my niece loves it as much as she loves my tiramisu and friends ask for it when we invite them to dinner.

I just find the other reviews amazing. This is the worst soup I've ever made! I love coriander/cilantro but...this cilantro overpowered the entire pot - couldn't taste the carrot nor onion nor broth.  I ended up adding about 1/1/2 cups of squash to get rid of the soapy taste of the cilantro. I added salt - pepper - still soapy.  I even grated some cheese over the top. I was really looking forward to this... but...

What a lovely soup!  I was not sure how this would turn out with only 4 ingredients, but wow - I am glad I tried it!  I made basmati rice for my family and some of us had the soup over the rice for a really wonderful meal.  Thanks VCollo!  Great recipe!

I think the previous reviewer has confused this with the 'Carrot and Coriander Soup' recipe. I made it yesterday, and it was SO delicious! I made this one today, and it wasn't nearly as good.

This soup was delicious and super easy to put together.  My family finished off the entire pot of soup today.  I'll be making it again tomorrow!

As other reviewers, I was a bit concerned if I can get a really good soup using only these four ingredients. But it turned out great! The only changes I made was using three more carrots (because I like more creamy soups), chicken broth and adding some ground turmeric and dash of red pepper (I like them spicy too) to the pureed soup. Some fresh lemon juice also gives it a nice twist.

A little hot.  Very good if this is what you are looking for.  I was looking for a creamier soup.

I thought this soup was really tasty to say it only has 4 ingredients in it. I did use 6 carrots instead of 4 as some of the other reviews said it was a bit watery and it was just the right consistency. Will definitely be making again.

This is a wonderful winter-warmer soup; the sweetness of carrots with the spicy tang of coriander.  We finished the batch in about two meals!  But I have one small problem with it; the colour.  After adding the coriander and stirring, the soup started to turn a rather unpleasant olive-drab tone and looked worse when poured into bowls.  It's a really tasty soup, but can anyone recommend anything I can do to improve its appearance?

It turned out bitter. I did use fresh coriander. Not sure where I went wrong...
