This was excellent. I served this open faced and topped with a little shredded cheese. The meat was very tangy and had a great sloppy joe flavor without being too spicy. This was not bland either. We enjoyed our meal. Thanks for sharing this, it's a keeper!

Hmmm, I was about to give this a 3-star (just okay) rating, but then again I did wolf it all down in two meals, so I guess it was pretty good in my book, and I'll give it 4 stars after all.
Like previous reviews have said, this is basically Sloppy Joes with a bit of a tang.
I only had small hamburger buns, so this made 8 buns' worth, plus a few more spoonfuls.
I made it exactly as the recipe states, and it came out pretty saucy. (The main picture on the recipe page seems to show it as being a lot drier.) If I made this again, I probably would cook it longer in order to get rid of a lot of liquid in the sauce. The sauce was pretty sweet to me, maybe a little too sweet.
Also, celery is one of my least favorite vegetables (I find it boring and tasteless, not awful). Since I'd never really cooked with it, I thought I'd made a mistake when I brought "Celery Hearts" home, but then I learned that they're just the innermost ribs of the celery, so they were probably okay for this recipe. I was surprised that all the cooking left the chopped celery still crunchy. I'd personally skip that ingredient next time.

Good meal, especially with a house full of teen boys. They inhaled them. I did leave out the sugar & used less ketchup because of it's sugar content. My husband has diabetes, but we all loved them on a good whole wheat bun.

This was really easy to make, and pretty tasty.  Not an overly exciting dish, but with the ease of prep and ingredients on hand, deserves 5 stars from me.  Didn't change a thing with the recipe.  My husband ate it as a sloppy joe, and I ate mine over egg noodles.  Great leftovers, too!

Loved this recipe did add a couple of things. We like foods hot and spicy but with flavor and so with some tobasco and crushed red pepper this did the trick. It is also extremely good for a big gathering as a hotdog sauce.

Very tasty!  I had used some of my leftover homemade gravy (or meat sauce for some), which is very thick, instead of a jar of tomato sauce, so I didn't have to let it simmer for the 20 minutes.  I also had to substitute the white vinegar for red wine because I didn't have any on hand.  It turned out very good and will definitely be making again.

This was very very good! I used 97% fat free ground turkey.  This was easy and the family really liked it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was pretty good. It is basically a sloppy joe but with some zing to it. I will definately make again but I think I will try it with noodles or rice.

I made two sloppy joe recipes, both from this site, so I choose which ingredients to use from both recipes. I used frozen chopped green pepper and left out the celery. Used brown sugar and red wine vinegar (I added the vinegar at the end of cooking). Served on hamburger buns. I would use this recipe again for sloppy joes.

Delicious!  I left out the celery because my husband doesn't like celery but I think it would be just as good with it.  It was excellent with tortilla chips also!  May try a different variation and add jalape√±os, corn and black beans.

very good sauce. my husband called it a winner. Though we both like our meat sauce with a tad bit tomatoe base...i may double the tomatoe sauce next time, but, im not sure if that will ruin the tanginess of the sauce which i do like.

This was excellent. I substituted vegan mayo and vegan chicken and the flavor was incredible. I highly recommended this dish.

This is more like Sloppy Joe's. I like it. I double the recipe so I can put some in the freezer to have in a hurry. Watch out for the calories!

I didn't like this recipe. I just tasted like Ketchup.  My boyfriend asked me what were the seven ingredients/flavor and after I had told him, he said that all ingredients besides the ketchup itself, are what combine to make ketchup!  No wonder it tasted so strong like it!  I won't make this one again (but I don't like ketchup).  No one said they liked it either.

My husband and i loved this recipe. The only thing was that 1 lb of hamburger didn't make 6 sandwiches for hungry people. Next time we will double the batch.

I really liked this recipe. My husband didnt really care for it but I chalk it up to the fact that he is really quite picky. I like the way that the flavors really did meld together. I will probably make it again but most likely wont be in my regular rotation.

I would definitely call these a gourmet version of a sloppy joe. My family usually turns their noses up to a standard joe but I had some ground beef I needed to use and I had the ingredients on hand. I am so glad I gave these a try! Very easy to make and pleasing to everyone. Thank you for a new twist on an old not so favorite!

Nice quick meal.  My youngest son and I really enjoyed.  My husband thought it was okay.  I would probably add brown sugar instead of white next time (personal preference) but otherwise we enjoyed.  Thanks
