Simple and tasty! The footnotes mention to add any additional toppings you like. I added olives and mushrooms for me and because I was feeding my meat loving husband, I added Italian sausage for him. I used escarole and also another lettuce I have growing in my Aero Garden. This came together in a flash and it is one I will definitely make again.
