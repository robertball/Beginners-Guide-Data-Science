I really and truely loved this recipe. I didn't add much black pepper at all and glad I didn't, the veggies blended together added that peppery taste needed. The one thing that was slightly different only because at last minute realized I didn't have whole tomates but rather crushed w/basil already in the 28 ounce can I had...and based on that, my batch was beautifully seasoned. Sooo if the recipe is slightly bland..just add a few dashes of dried oregano. My Ninja food processor is a champ and I measured with all ingredients and the size of batch it makes, to be about 72 ounces total. I love it. This makes a super easy recipe, fast with little prep work, delish & go to recipe, if you're not sure what to have for a quick lunch. I couldn't be more pleased with my results.

I made it as directed. It was very easy and a great way to use up fresh garden vegetables, but it tasted too strongly of the bell pepper and neither I nor my husband liked it. We couldn't finish our bowls.

Followed as directed. Mine was too onion-y, but I recognize that might have been a function of the onion I used. I liked the food processor suggestion, except that this recipe is too big to do it in the processor without switching out contents, so you should 1/2 to 3/4 it for that. Even though I wasn't crazy about it as gazpacho, it did end up being a fantastic base for a chicken mole type simmer sauce, so I might come back around to it for that reason.

I made this recipe all summer using fresh tomatoes (2 lbs) and a squirt of Siracha. Crispy and crunchy and filling, delicious!

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have orange or yellow peppers, so I just used red and green. I added oregano and jalapeno. I also used 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, and used the juice from that, then blended everything together with my immersible blender. Super yum!

Strong bell pepper taste. Next time I make, I will use only one or two peppers. Used fresh tomatoes for canned & juice. Came out really great. Took about 15-20 minutes to make.

This was so simple to make, and very zesty!  I prefer fresh, whole, tomatoes as opposed to canned, but either way, this is very good!

Very good recipe. I love gazpacho and this was my first attempt at making it myself. The finished product was outstanding. I added a few romas, extra garlic, Creole seasonings, and a dash of curry.

I love gazpacho, and this is one of my favorite recipes. Easy, filling and healthful. I use whatever canned tomatoes I have on hand, whether flavored by basil, onion, or fire-roasted.

Very good. I'll definitely make this again. Next time I'll add a few more tomatoes, and some lemon wedges for garnish and flavor when serving.
