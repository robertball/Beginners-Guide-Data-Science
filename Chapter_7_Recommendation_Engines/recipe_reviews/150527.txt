When my son won the Eagle Brand contest at the Alabama National Fair, the amount of cranberry sauce was 1 cup.  The rules said that the recipe could be edited, so they changed it to read 1 can of whole berry cranberry sauce.  He tried that before even submitting the recipe, but the family did not like the mushy consistency.  This recipe needs to read 1 cup of whole berry cranberry sauce!

I made this recipe exactly as indicated with the exception of a yellow cake mix rather than spice cake mix.  The filling is what was so odd.  They're ok at best but I will probably not make these again.

I made these acc. to the commenter who said this was her recipe and to only use 1 c. cranberry sauce.  I was very disappointed.  They have almost no flavor to them.  I won't be trying it again.

This is an Eagle Brand recipe (can be found on their web site) and it does call for 16 oz. cranberry sauce.  For the best tasting, moistest bars, the 16 oz. can is what is needed. These are super good!
