this was a great recipe..but i made so many changes that it evolved into a recipe of my own creation.  first i omitted step 1 and the baking soda. next, i put in smoked turkey necks and seasoning(old bay and tony chacherre's creole seasoning) and the greens at the same time. next i piled on the greens(i conbined collard and mustard)!! i let them cook down for an hour and then put in the extra greens that didn't fit at first. i stirred every hour or so and added seasoning to taste. i cooked for 5hrs the night before and then 3hrs the day of thanksgiving, by doing that the seasonings had asorbed really well and the greens were tender and flavorful!! hope this helps a little.

Very good recipe.  I used smoked turkey legs and instead of boiling the meat on the stove first, I threw everything into the crockpot.  I put in 2 cups of chicken broth and cooked on low for 6 hours.

This is great.  I made this with frozen collard greens and skipped first step. Super flavor, not very hot even with jalapenos.

While the taste was still banging, it was not a good fit for me.   I used vinegar instead of baking soda. I would also recommending passing up the cooking before putting into the slow cooker.

For those of us who love greens year-round, the slow cooker is the perfect stove-top antidote during A/C season. These simple ingredients produced a complex, layered taste: spicy, savory, smoky. (I've used fresh garlic and jalapenos) A+ for ease of preparation and taste.

Kimmy, is the one with the right idea for these greens. WOW! These are the best greens I've made!  Replacing the ham with smoked neck bones, 2 different seasonings, & adding as you go is the way. I used crushed red pepper instead of j-peppers..delicious.  Making it again tonight.

I used this recipe for the slow cooker method and I used the Kickin' Greens for the actual recipe. I used bacon grease vs. olive oil and sauted the onion and garlic then added two pounds of collard greens. I used a dandoodle (VA/NC seasoned meat), water not chicken broth, and red pepper flakes. After 45 minutes on the stove, the greens were bitter so I added 1T. brown sugar and 1 T. apple cider vinegar. I transferred the greens to a slow cooker and let it sit in the fridge overnight with the dandoodle which provides the seasonings. I cooked the greens on low for 4-6 hours and kept adding brown sugar to eliminate the bitterness. Overall, I probably added 1/4 c. brown sugar and 2 T. apple cider vinegar for the 2lbs. of fresh collard greens. My BIL uses honey vs. brown sugar. Definitely a keeper! Delicious and this slow cooker method does not make the greens turn to mush but I prefer the fresh onions and garlic of the kickin' collard green recipe.

My changes: I microwaved a 2-lb bag of pre-cut and pre-washed fresh collards in 2 batches for 5 minutes each with 1/4 c chicken broth each -- just so they'd fit in the crock pot. I omitted the soda and salt, and used a leftover meaty ham bone and sliced the meat off in huge chunks. I also added 1/2 coarsely chopped onion, 1/4 cup vinegar, 1 tsp red pepper flakes (instead of the jalapenos), and 2 fresh minced garlic cloves (instead of the garlic powder). I used 6 cups fat-free no-added-salt chicken stock (in total) since I like the liquid to cover the greens. Tossed this with the olive oil in the crockpot. Thanks TROMTE, Kimmy, and denisett!

This recipe is wonderful.   My daughter never had any interest in collards, now - when I ask her if she has any special request for holiday meals....
Crock Pot Collards
I think it's the jalepeno peppers that make the difference.

Very good recipe. I always use a ham steak (bone-in) and it comes out great. It's good to see the Baking Soda. I'm from the south and my mother taught me that the Baking Soda will take out any bitter in the greens. My greens always come out smokey and sweet. If cooking on top of the stove, use a 1/2 tsp of Baking Soda the last 15-20 minutes of cooking.

Thank you for your recipe post this is the best way to cook collards.  It was easy and I was not stuck in the house for a whole day and I actually cooked them longer for more tenderness.

I only ate greens at my grandmother's as a child. She served them with vinegar on the side. So I never learned about the baking soda! Also grandma didn't eat spicey food so I never had collards with jalapeños. Wow! This was soooo good. I like it hot and it just gets better and better over time. I used bacon ends because that was all I had. Now I know what those giant crockpots are made for because those greens really take up a lot of space until they shrink down. I am going to get a bigger slow cooker for next time so I can make even more!

I used kale and home grown turnip greens, smoked turkey leg and leftover smoked chicken leg, and chicken broth.  There's a spice now called Roadkill Grill in a grinder.  A few twists and no need for jalepenos or black pepper!  Great recipe!

Very good way to prepare greens.  My mother has fixed greens all her life and I grew up enjoying them.  As children, my brother and I cleaned lots of greens.  As an adult I shied away from fixing greens because of the work involved -- I know about pre-washed greens but they cut them too fine for my taste.  
  Anyway, I liked Kimmy's ideas for this recipe -- omitted the baking soda (our family never used that), used smoked turkey.  Although 8 hours at the slow cooker's low setting was suggested, I found 5 1/2 plenty.  (It was about 11pm and I decided to check the greens before setting my clock to wake me at 2:30am so I could empty the greens from the cooker -- I'm glad I did, they were quite ready).  At 5 1/2 hours in my slow cooker the greens were very soft -- I could have stopped 1/2 hour earlier and been fine.  I've read that different slow cookers have different temperatures; mine is by Bella and at the low setting, the greens were doing a low simmer -- pretty hot.
  After cooking, I tasted the greens and found they needed more seasoning.  (I cooked two large bunches of collards and a small bunch of mustards).  When I put them in the slow cooker I'd added 4 cups of liquid - water and chicken broth mixed together, Tony Chachere's seasoning, a little brown sugar, 1/2 an onion, 4 small garlic cloves, a couple of small pickled jalapenos with a little of the liquid, a few red pepper flakes, and a smoked turkey drumstick - cut up.  
  I had not added salt, they needed plenty --

I use the baking soda in mine also.  Just like in cooking beans -- it helps out with the "gas" factor.

Haven't tried it yet, but I shall -- with one minor change:  since we do not eat pork I'll substitute the ham shanks with either smoked turkey pieces, or a cured, smoked beef tongue.  (I cooked some collards for a New Year's party that I catered many years ago.  Used the whole tongue and was able to slice it up to serve as an extra side dish.  Got raves for both the greens and the meat...!)

I used chicken broth and water.  I also fried 5 pieces of bacon and got it really crispy and added that to the pot and a small amount of bacon drippings too.

My mother in law made this for Thanksgiving and it was a success. The only modification was no salt since the ham hock gave it plenty. We also cooked on high for about 1.5-2 hours before turning to low and it only need an hour or so after that. My 3 year old daughter ate greens for the first time which was totally amazing; she loved it!

These were excellent. I used a fresh serrano pepper seeded and sliced in chunks for my heat. I also used the smoke turkey necks, no ham hocks available near me. I did follow suggestions. I heated my turkey necks in a little olive oil and red pepper flakes just until I could smell the smoke of turkey ( just so they would be warm and ready to infuse flavor). I put them in  first and added the rest. I did not use the baking soda or vinegar until the end. About 2 hours before they were done I tasted. To see how bitter. I then added white wine vinegar( that is what I had on hand). It made an astounding difference ! I had no idea vinegar could really cut bitterness. I di season with salt about 30 minutes before seeing. just so it didn't get overwhelming. I will definitely be making greens more often now that I know how easy and tasty mine can be. no more restaurant for me!

First time I made greens was with this recipe. It received the seal of approval from some hard core southerners!

These were very GOOD BETTER ON DAY TWO.  Didn’t use peppers used a small can of roasted green chili’s all I had.  Used s good pinch of Cheyenne.  I’ve always wanted to make these and found my go-to recipe on the first try.
