Ok i've got to come to the rescue of the original poster here... this *is* a tasty way to make rice pudding (albeit time-consuming). I have a similar recipe (thanks to the Modern Family Cookbook, published in 1953). There is a trick to making this recipe work... and that is a large (as in wide, not deep!) baking pan, so the mixture is quite shallow, with lots of surface area to allow evaporation to take place. I made mine in a large lasagne pan once, that was a bit of overkill and it dried out too fast... i had to add extra milk, believe it or not! A 9x14 pan works fine. If you use a narrower-but-deeper casserole dish, you'll experience the "rice soup" problem. Here's my recipe, basically identical to the original poster's:

1/3c uncooked rice
4 c milk, scalded
1/4 c sugar
2 tbsp butter
1/4 tsp salt

Cook at 300 degrees for 1.5 hours, stirring every 15 minutes with a fork, turning under the brown top and scraping the edges down.

This recipe is WAY off on the rice:milk ratio but I added an addition 2 cups of rice, 1 egg and a pinch of cornstarch and the recipe turned out awesome!!!  I made one dish with raisins and one without with my other additions and my family is as happy as can be with their dessert this evening!  Thanks Alicia, it's great!!

I made this recipe to see for myself if it would work. After the arduous task of stirring every 20 minutes for 2 hours, and then letting it set for 30 minutes, the pudding was still soup. Finally, determined to eat dessert, I whisked in 2 eggs, and cooked it on the stovetop the old fashioned way. It thickened right up in about 5 minutes. Then it tasted great! I recommend using the stovetop method for easier rice pudding.

This is really close to the recipe my grandma makes... instead of milk she uses evaporated milk.  It is time consuming but I've found it turns out much better than the rice pudding recipes I've tried that have a "quick" cook time.  I have a 2.5 qt casserole dish that is oblong and it works perfectly for this recipe.  Sometimes I add a small dash of nutmeg to it too.

This was perfect.  Perhaps others are using the wrong kind of rice?  I use 1/3 cup of short grain rice and 1/2 cup sugar, add the raisins after I remove it from the oven.  It turns out thick like custard, I usually have to bake this for 2.5 hours.  Similar recipe in the Calif. Culinary book says to bake for 3 hours. Wonderful, thank you.

This recipe is fine, very good and very simple, but you must use short grain rice.  Long grain rice is different and won't thicken the mixture.  Give it about 3 hours to bake also.

rice pudding is a typical desert in Egypt, my country, however none of the recipes i found on this wonderful site say how to do it the oriental way which is so easy.  all u have to do is rince 1/4 of a cup of rice in cold water , keep rincing changing the water until clear.  on the stove, combine rice with 4 cups of milk, and the amount of sugar that you judge appropriate, i usually use 1/4 of a cup, and a tsp of vanilla extact. simmer on low heat until the rice is coocked, then ad 1tbsp of cornflour or any other thickning agent used in the us, i dont know what is usually used,the cornflour should be previously dilueted in 5 tbs of milk so as to avoid clumping. once the cornflour is added, bring to a boil stirring until the mixture thickens and ad 2 tbs of rose water or orange blossom water, reduce quantity to a few drops if using rose essence. laddle into individual serving bowl. when cool, sprinkle with ground cinamon, grated coconut, raisins , ground almonds.... this is a typical egyptian rice pudding usually eaten during celebrations.

I'm baking this one right now, but I know it's the recipe I've been looking for....simple, and all it takes is time! I used a bit more rice (a half cup total) and more sugar, but it's the same as the one I used to make when I was married.  Delicious!

This rice pudding recipe is pretty much just like the one I've been using for many years thanks to an old Homemaker's magazine.  However, I use 500 ml of whole milk (half a quart?) and Italian style Arborio rice and cook it over the stove top on low (covered lid and stir occassionally) for about an hour.  It thickens more as it cools.  I add the vanilla about 5 minutes after it's cooked and sprinkle the cinnamon on top after putting in bowls.  I've noticed many egg based recipes and frankly don't feel it necessary to try these as this recipe is tops for ease, taste and creaminess.  Just make sure you use the Italian rice.  I get tremendous feedback from others with claims that it's creamier and tastier than the Cozy Shack brand.  Sometimes I add a dollop of whip cream on top of my bowl for extra indulgence!

I think you need to add more rice. 1/3 of a cup is not enough. My guess is it should be 2 1/3 maybe. I would like to know because I just prepared it and it is way too liquidy. I'm going to add some instant rice and see if it will be eatable.

Wonderful! I did use short grain rice and I usually cover it the first half hour.  The recipe works great with different combinations of canned milk or cream.  My favorite is using vanilla soy milk.  It turns out very creamy and is a great lactose free treat.

This recipe is WAY off .... much too much milk, or not enough rice.  Please revise and send to all of us who have made it and goofed up on it.

This recipe did not work for me. I made it as written and when it didn't thicken up and the rice still crunchy after the the time was up, I followed the other reviewers advice to try and fix it. It did thicken up but the rice never soften upped and I was unable to serve this dish.

I was looking for an easy recipe for rice pudding because I had finished up the store bought one that I was supposed to share with hubby. I was skeptical about this recipe. I did add about 1/2 cup more rice halfway through. The end result was perfect and delicious. This is a keeper.

The flavor was *very* tasty, I thought. But I don't know what went wrong. It was rice soup, not rice pudding. It didn't thicken up much at all. If I do it again, I will probably half the milk. I followed the directions exactly, but a quart of milk left it too soupy.

This recipe takes way too long.  I ended up having to bake it for 3 hours.  You are better off starting with cooked rice!  It tasted very good but it was not really worth the wait.  If you have time to kill then you may like this rice pudding.

Somebody needs to remove this recipe or revise it.  Too many of us are making soup without reading all the reviews first.  My 14-year old son wanted rice pudding, so I told him to look on this site for an easy recipe.  He wasted countless hours last night re-doing it because he thought he measured wrong the first time.  What a waste!!!

I was suspicious that the recipe did not call for enough rice or had too much milk.  It was soup rather than pudding.  The flavor was good but a waste of time and ingredients with these amounts.

I used Arborio Rice in this because that was what I had on hand. Based on many other reviewers I cut the milk in half. This worked out great and was done after 2 hours. It definitely did not make enough for 4 servings. I would say two servings and that is being generous in my house!
