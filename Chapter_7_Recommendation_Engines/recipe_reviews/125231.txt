Like others, I used fresh onions and garlic.  I sauteed the onion, garlic, and mushrooms, then added the green beans and continued to sautee for a minute.  Next, I added 1 cup water and stirred occassionally until the water had evaporated.  At this time it was done (saved a dirty dish).  I also topped with parmesean - more for presentaion than flavor.  I found this tasty enough.  It was easy, and I will make again.

Super! Changes I made:  Added more mushrooms, used a 1/2 lb container (I think this close to 2 cups sliced).  Used fresh garlic (2 cloves), or 1 to 2 tsp of prepared minced garlic from jar.  Sauteed this with the butter and mushrooms.  Added fresh grated parmesan to the top.  This was the only thing completely gone from the Thanksgiving menu.

Just made this recipe tonight for dinner. Its an excellent dress-up to the traditional side dish. I did as the others and sauteed onion and minced garlic with the mushrooms. I also used olive oil in replace of butter as this is a healthier alternative. My family raved over the dish. This will be copied and put in our family menu rotation!!! Thanks!!

Thought these were good, but I did do things slightly different.  Used less butter, chose to saute some onions and garlic along with the mushrooms (instead of using the powders later), threw in a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes and topped it off with fresh parmesan cheese.  I did taste them prior to the cheese, and I thought it added a lot of needed flavor.  They were good, thank you.

I used one clove of garlic and a half a cup of diced onion instead of the powders, and it was delicious! I had some cheese on hand, but I thought it was yummy enough already! I would definitely make this again!

Very nice dish, but waaaay too much butter; I reduced the amount and it still seemed like fat with a side of vegetables.  Will try halving the butter next time.

A really quick and delicious recipe.  I used fresh minced onion and garlic sauteed in a light garlic olive oil and just eyeballed the mushrooms.  I was informed that it was sooo much better than "that casserole thing".  I'm going to have to double it next time.  My SL had three helpings!  Thanks for a new family favourite.

These were good.  Couldn't bring myself to use garlic powder so instead used a clove and sauteed some onion with it...like another reviewer I added some parmesan cheese also. I too thought it needed some flavor as well.  Thanks for the post.

I'm sure this would be good with the onion and garlic powders, but since I had it to use, I substituted fresh minced garlic and shallots.  Since I had both asparagus and green beans in the fridge, I made a medley of both. Quite good!

Excellent! I made the dish yesterday. My husband hates onions - so I used onion powder, and I used fresh garlic in with the sauteed mushrooms. I had fresh Parmesan cheese on hand. It really does add the final BLUE RIBBON touch!

These green beans are quick, easy and full of flavor. I used 1 clove of fresh garlic and about a quarter cup of red onion.  I skipped the onion and garlic powder and just used salt and pepper.  I also used the slender frozen green beans from Trader Joes.

These green beans were fantastic! My husband and I loved them, in fact he stated that, "These are the best green beans ever!". I love how the sauted mushrooms and butter mixed with the garlic and onion powder creates a really nice sauce for the beans. I get bored with plain old vegetable side dishes, so when I find one that makes eating them more interesting I make them often. This will be made quite often, especially since it is so easy! Thanks for posting this recipe, Adeline!

We really enjoyed this, even though it was a bit too much butter. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used fresh onion and garlic. Very simple, tasty and elegant-looking. Cutting back on the butter will make it healthy, too - a bonus since I definitely plan on making this again.

Instead of garlic and onion powders, I used fresh chopped sweet onion and fresh minced garlic. I sauteed them in the butter with the mushrooms before adding in the green beans. Though my husband and two kids were kind of blase about this dish, I loved it and plan on making it again no matter what they think. ;)

I have been trying a lot of green bean recipes on this site, trying to find one I love.  I finally did!  These green beans are so delicious!  I did make some changes to make them more fresh and healthy (although I think they would still be excellent as written).  I used about 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1 clove minced garlic instead of the powders - I just sauteed them up with the mushrooms.  Instead of 6 Tbsp. butter, I used only 3 Tbsp. Smart Balance butter blend.  Some freshly ground black pepper finished off the dish beautifully.  I'm so glad to have found this recipe!

These are a great preparation for green beans.  I used fresh crimini mushrooms.  Instead of using powder garlic, I used fresh garlic, which I always prefer.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think some crispy bacon would be a fabulous addition to this as well

We're not big mushroom fans in our house, so we subbed in some pecans to add some extra flavor. I would have liked to follow some other suggestions and use diced onion and minced garlic instead of the powders, but I didn't have time. It wasn't an issue, because the beans tasted good with the powders anyway.

Very delicious. I used more mushrooms and added onion. I also substituted the butter with olive oil. Instead of using a separate pan for the green beans, I sautéd the mushrooms, onions and garlic then added the green beans. Sautéd for a minute then added a cup of water and cooked until the water evaporated as someone else suggested.

This was good, although I felt like the recipe called for too much butter.  The mushrooms add great flavor to this dish!

So good! I used nice thick cut mushrooms and it was mouth-watering good. I used fresh garlic and butter. I am always looking for new ways to make green beans.

I did the same thing.  Used fresh onions and garlic but I also added lemmon pepper, red pepper, dried basil and added parmesean cheese.  I also boiled the green beans in Hawaiian Sea Salt which gave it more flavor.  To kick it up a notch add more pepper.  Very tasty.  You can also add lemon juice.

Very good recipe.  Used frozen green beans, elephant garlic and olive oil.  Turned out very well.  If using frozen green beans they really only need to be blanched in the boiling water before adding to garlic and onions.

I loved this recipe! I added some fresh garlic to it and a dash of garlic salt. I used frozen green beans, not fresh. The only thing I would do different, is add a little bit more mushrooms.

I should have read the other reviewers' comments.  I love butter, but there was way too much on these beans, and I used more than the pound called for.

My children loved these. Of course for my kids I had to omit the mushrooms. I used yellow beans and they tasted just as good as green beans would have. I also used fresh minced garlic and fresh onions. This recipe missed a star because it calls for powder not fresh.

I thought there was WAY too much onion and garlic taste....... I had to drain it in a colander it was so strong! I should have used fresh instead of powder. Also, used half butter and half olive oil.  I doubled the mushrooms to 1 cup and added the green beans last.

Took these beans to a dinner party tonight.  The meal was lovely, but the star of the show was my green beans!  I used whole fresh green beans, canned mushrooms, butter and olive oil and finely diced garlic.  Although I didn't use any of the powdered seasonings, I am still giving this recipe  5 stars because of the great idea.  Everyone's comments made me a 5 star guest with this delicious side.

I made this for Christmas dinner as a side dish and it was a huge hit.  It was the only dish with nothing left.  Even the kids liked it (of course, they didn't eat the mushrooms).  I also used fresh garlic and onion slices and sauteed them in a butter/olive oil mixture.  The beans stayed nice and green and it was a nice presentation.  I did use the fresh beans you steam in the bag that you can find in the produce section.  Great recipe, I'll definitely use again!

These were perfect for my taste.  I used fresh, un-cut beans, and I used crushed garlic (purchased in frozen cubes)  but otherwise did not alter the recipe.  The result was a very fancy looking, bright green (we leave the vegies crisp) side dish. Loved it.

I have roasted a chicken the night I made this and used about 2.5 T of the chicken grease instead of the butter.  Seemed like a lot of butter.  The green beans were AWESOME!!  I will definitely make it again.

My husband, who normally doesn't eat his green beans, really liked these.  I made them with frozen green beans from my moms garden.  I will probably add the onions and fresh garlic next time, but this was super fast and easy...and really good.

First I want to thank you very much. I have been looking for this recipe for over 10years. From the first time i had it at a church dinner. Not knowing what was in it.. I've tried to recall the garlic and butter mix, but never got it right.. Thank you So very much!!! All the ingredients I used where fresh. I did not use the mushrooms. It became a big hit in my house. Thanks

Loved these!   Gave them 4 stars only because I did not follow the recipe as stated.   Instead, I did as others, and used fresh onions and garlic and sauteed the mushrooms, used "steam fresh" green beans made in microwave, mixed together and served.   Got rave reviews from all.  Made this way I give it a 5 star rating.

This was a great recipe!  It was easy to prepare, my 7 yr old daughter even helped!  The taste was so good.  My husband told me he didn't like the main dish I prepared that night, but I should make this recipe again and again!  I will however use less butter next time.

I have made these for Thanksgiving two year in a row now.  Everyone loves them. This year I did use some fresh minced garlic along with a little powder.  I also used a little less butter than called for.  Yummy and so easy!

In the rush of getting the Thanksgiving dinner on the table, I don't know if I misread this recipe, but it was way too garlicy and fake tasting.  I should have gone with the suggestions of sauteing garlic and onion instead of the powders, but I was trying to save time, and unfortunately this was not a hit.
