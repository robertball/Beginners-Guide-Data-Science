I prefer to saute the mushrooms in a little olive oil instead of boiling them.  Just make sure the bottoms are totally dry before placing in oven or they get soggy.

I needed a treat with Gruyere for a class, so I tried these.  They are quite good if a little bland - I'll make them again but will salt the filling next time.  Also, I sauteed the filling on medium for a few minutes to soften up the onion and garlic, as I didn't think they'd be good crunchy.  Good recipe and fun to make!

Like another reviewer, I prefer to sautee my mushrooms rather than boiling them, and I have made this with Provolone cheese instead of Gruyere. I also eyeball the amount of lemon juice and herbs I add - we aren't big parsley fans, so I use a lot more chives. Nice recipe. Thanks!

We thought these were just okay. We've had better stuffed mushrooms before. Probably won't make again. Sorry!
