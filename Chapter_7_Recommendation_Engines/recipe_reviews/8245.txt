OMG, this cake is awesome.  It sort of makes my tongue tingle!  I received rave reviews from co-workers and neighbors for this cake.  Yes, I might add a few more cherries next time because the cake is so dense and can feed so many people that it can handle another dozen cherries.  I must say that this is not a recipe for children due to the alcohol, but I still gave it a 5 star rating because it deserves it.  Thank you so much, Holly, for sharing this recipe.  It will be a part of every Christmas from now on.

The cake is real dense and moist. I recommend more cherries and dates in this recipe. The cake tastes wonderful and perhaps a nice chantilly cream would be excellent with it. It definately needs more fruit. The taste is wonderful and for a first time fruit cake this is a good start.

I have been making this fruitcake since the mid 1980's and it has never failed to get rave reviews.  I have used mini loaf pans and given them as gifts.  This is a favorite.

This is a very moist fruit cake. A dear friend of my late mother gave mom this cake recipe. So that kids can enjoy the cake with the adults, use grape juice, cranberry juice for a dark fruit cake, or light grape juice or apple juice for a light fruit cake. Reduce the 1lb of chopped pecans to 1.5 -2 cups chopped pecans. use more candied fruit, (fruitcake mix,, pineapple, cherries) and soak it in 3 cups fruit juice instead of 2 cups juice. also reduce both sugars to 1.5 cups each====4 cups sugar makes the cake toooooo sweet. Also, if you don't have a 10inch cake pan (bunt is ttoooooo small for this cake) for this cake, use 2 10 inch bunt cake pans or 2-3 loaf cake pan. the 10 in tube cake pans are very hard to find unless you go to a specialty shop or mail order

This recipe is nearly the same as one my mother made every year...more than 50 yrs ago. Her cake was virtually nuts, currants or raisins with batter to hold it all together. She used cheese cloth and stored the cake in a large pan. Every few days she'd sprinkle bourbon on the cake and onto a quartered apple that rested at the bottom of the cake in the center hole. after replacing the cheesecloth she sprinkled bourbon again over the whole thing and resealed the pan. It rested in the laundry room which wasn't heated. Please use a pan or kettle that can be securely closed up and the cake will be moist and delicious and yes, dense with nuts, raisins and good bourbon flavor. She always served the thin slices with a homemade hard sauce..it was great, but not necessary.

Fruitcake~Gross, you say, until you taste this one.  It is awesome! The outer cake is firm but not hard and the inner cake is moist and so delicious.  Have won over many fruitcake scoffers with this recipe.  I did add candied pineapple and cranberries and chopped the fruit so it wasn't huge hunks.  Am ready to make more and convert more fruitcake haters!

This recipe is a very fond memory of my childhood growing up in Dallas. As a child, this cake was one of the things that got me excited about the holidays! My mom lost the recipe a few years ago & to my delight, I found it here. I highly recommend it!!! The cherries & raisons soaked in bourbon are the BEST!

Being a bonified Kentucky Gal,  Ky Bourbon Pecan Cake was a very anticipated treat of the Christmas season.  Mom always made them...I say them because she made several to give as gifts...the weekend after Thanksgiving and they soaked in bourbon until served Christmas through New Years. It's not your regular fruitcake because it only has pecans, red candied cherries and raisins, not all that other yucky candied fruit that, in my opinion, gives fruitcake a bad rap.   When made this way, it WILL change your mind on how delicious a GOOD fruitcake can be. Be generous in the soaking and use really good bourbon, not the cheapstuff because you WILL taste it. I'm making mine this weekend!

I made this cake for Christmas and my family really liked it.  I thought it was good too but maybe had too many pecans.  It was also a bit too large for one bundt pan, but I put a cookie sheet under it in case it spilled over in the oven.  It didn't but almost did and that part got crunchy.

This is a fabulous fruitcake ! The bourbon flavor comes through without overwhelming the tastebuds. I added an extra cup of cherries and will add even more and more nuts next year.

I hate fruit cake, but this cake is awesome!  My husband's mom made this cake every year when he was growing up, and he said it tastes just like hers.  The first time I made it, it spilled all over the bottom of my oven; now I use two pans.  I have made it the past two years for Christmas.  I bake it around Thanksgiving, wrap it in bourbon-soaked cheesecloth, and once a week, I brush bourbon on it.  It is wonderful!

I have made this cake for many years and love it, however I make 2 changes. I use all raisins, half dark and half light. I also use only 2 cups of flour and it makes perfect amount for bundt pan and the cake is very light, unlike some of the other reviews which claim it is too crusty  and heavy.

I have been making this cake for years, first with my Grandma and then my Mom. We always made it at Christmas and gave them away as gifts. A lot of work, and a mixer won't do after a point, You need to do it by hand. A wonderful cake indeed.

I will be making this again.  I made it in two pans-one a tube pan half full and the other was a large bread pan.  Wrapped it in old flour bag cloths and soaked it in more bourbon.  Wonderful.  We waited two weeks to try them.  They are gone.  I gave one to my mother who always makes a plain white fruit cake that is very good but I think this beat it hands down.  Bought more fruit and will be making them again this week.  :)

This recipe has been in our family for years!  We don't soak the cakes in additional bourbon though.  The recipe was published as "Tom Buchanan's Whiskey Cake" -perhaps a reference to the character in the Great Gatsby?  I never understood all the holiday fruit cake jokes because our family made this..then I learned it was more properly called a bourbon or whiskey cake!!   My mother still gets requests every year!

This recipe was a huge waste of money for me. I did everything right to the letter, bought an expensive bundt pan, and ended up with a tasteless, dry, fruitless brick that we threw out. Just awful.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because perhaps I did something wrong, but this just didn't work out well for me.  I think it was overcooked, as the outside is VERY hard and can't really be eaten.  It is miles short on fruit, although I did add extra.  I can hardly taste the alcohol, if at all.  The middle is not bad, but overall a major disappointment for all the work, expense, and waiting.
