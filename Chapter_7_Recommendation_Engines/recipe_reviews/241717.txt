Yummy.   I followed the recipe exactly and although*I* like it, I think it may be a little too much onion for some .... start with less and taste it, you can always add more ... personally I thought it was really good.  I'm going to use this as my "base dressing" in the future and add some dill, bleu cheese or garlic just to change it up.
